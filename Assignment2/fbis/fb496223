  [Text] Knesset Member [MK] Ari'el Sharon says that the 
Likud needs a new leadership, and that an alternative -- of 
which he intends to be a member -- must be created for the 
failed opposition. 
  Interviewed by Qol Yisra'el, Sharon said the struggle was 
being spearheaded by the Council of Jewish Settlements in 
Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza rather than by the Likud, which has 
failed miserably. Sharon said the Likud should get a new 
leadership, capable of waging a democratic and legal struggle in 
the face of danger. 
  Reacting to Sharon's remarks, MK Me'ir Shitrit said that 
most 
Likud voters apparently want peace, and that is why so few of 
them take part in anti-peace demonstrations. He called on 
Sharon to appear before the Likud Central Committee and try to 
muster 75 percent required for the election of a new leadership. 
Shitrit said he will not lend a hand to the ouster of Binyamin 
Netanyahu, who would be called upon to quit the leadership only 
if he fails in the elections. MK Shitrit proposed to Netanyahu 
to consolidate a leadership of five or six people, including 
Ari'el Sharon, to make the Likud leadership's work more 
effective.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Elections Now"] </F>
  [Text] It was a mistake to bet on Yasir 'Arafat from the 
very beginning. 'Arafat's almost 30 years of experience in 
control of Fatah and the PLO attest not only to his talent for 
survival but also to the guilefulness that renders him 
untrustworthy. He has not undergone the necessary and hoped-for 
metamorphosis from the leader of a national liberation movement, 
operating partially in exile and even clandestinely, to a 
statesman. He has failed to rise to the greatness of the hour 
and is returning not to the Gaza Strip and Jericho, but back to 
his old tricks. 
  'Arafat, however, is not the PLO or the Palestinian people. 
It was he who signed the Cairo agreement with Yitzhaq Rabin but 
the relations between the two peoples and their respective 
political entities cannot depend on the nature of changing 
leaders, who are mere mortals subject to political transitions. 
'Arafat's inflammatory sermon in Johannesburg is a serious 
matter not because it addressed the question of Jerusalem -- 
Israel is indeed obligated to discuss all the issues, including 
East Jerusalem and the settlements, in the negotiations over the 
permanent arrangement, even if the Palestinian yarn spinner made 
up a "letter from Rabin" for the benefit of his audience -- but 
because the hallowed words of peace can no longer be voiced by a 
person who calls for jihad. If the sermon was some kind of 
tactical move designed to mobilize support for 'Arafat's 
policies then it is a mistake because there are also skeptics 
among the Israeli public and these kinds of tricks discourage 
them from supporting the political process. If it is an 
indication of 'Arafat's substantive position, along the lines of 
the "phased" doctrine, then it proves that 'Arafat is deluding 
himself that Israel is so weakened that its withdrawal will not 
stop at the Green Line. Whichever way, 'Arafat, personally, is 
no longer a credible partner for negotiations. 
  In the Declaration of Principles, Israel pledged to hold 
elections in the territories within three months of implementing 
the first stage of withdrawal in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. 
This stage has now been completed and the countdown for 
elections should begin. Contrary to his earlier eagerness to 
incorporate this clause into the agreement (in order to use it 
to include East Jerusalem), 'Arafat now seeks to rule the 
territories without elections. Israel shares this interest to 
the extent that it is a partner to 'Arafat's concern over the 
rise of Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and similar 
organizations; however, Israel's partnership with 'Arafat does 
not involve supporting him against the PLO's middle generation, 
which is poised to fight for its inclusion in the territories' 
leadership. 
  Israel must insist on the implementation of the clause on 
elections in the territories following sufficient preparations 
that should last not three but six months. Israel should make 
the continuation of the process conditional on the holding of 
elections with the participation of all parties whose declared 
goal is to make peace with Israel, without the threat of any 
jihads. In other words, not Hamas, not the Islamic Jihad, not 
the rejectionist fronts, and perhaps not even 'Arafat. Israel 
must negotiate with the authorized representatives of the 
Palestinian people but not with those who stick the agreement in 
their pocket and then threaten a ruthless war to achieve the 
rest of their objectives, a war over everything.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "For India's Sake"] </F>
  [Text] The feeble and amateurish denial by the Prime 
Minister's Office [PMO] that it influenced the postponement of 
the first `user trial' of the battlefield support missile, 
Prithvi, is not going to cut much ice in a country recoiling at 
the rapid pace of encroachment on its security and sovereignty. 
From the pedestrian to the policy-making level the mood is 
extremely sceptical of official denials that fail to stand up to 
scrutiny, even for 24 hours. The fact of the matter is that the 
Prithvi was to be tried by the Army for the first time, and for 
which enormous logistical preparations had been made months in 
advance. At the last moment the test was postponed to an 
unscheduled date. Simple logic prompts the deduction that 
something is amiss, especially given the PMO's penchant for 
overruling those professionally charged with fulfilling their 
assigned roles. So is the country to blame for smelling a rat 
when the stench is overwhelming. 
  The attitude of the political authorities to the indigenous 
defence programmes is niggardly in its funding and inconsistent 
in its policy. But if despite these constraints, Indian 
scientists are able to craft weapon systems that rankle some, it 
is testimony to the nation's potential. The scientists are 
inspired by a vision of India as a proud, respected and secure 
nation whose sovereignty is not up for barter. Tragically, this 
vision is sadly lacking among those who are taking decisions on 
behalf of the people of India. Why accuse Washington of 
imperiousness when India's future is being compromised by those 
who perceive it to be a poor third-world country unworthy of 
aspiring to the top league? This third-best mindset has 
contributed to policies that declare India is up for grabs if 
some President Clinton or Lee Hamilton so wills. Postponing the 
Prithvi trials is yet another manifestation of this servility, 
and whatever be the proffered excuses they are not likely to 
seem otherwise to someone either in Washington or Warangal. 
  The US knows what India is capable of achieving and is bent 
on ensuring that this is not realised. Applying pressure, 
overtly or covertly, leads Washington to believe that India can 
be checked. The Indian sees that lesson, and a more significant 
one as well. The soldiers who were to begin their 
familiarisation with the Prithvi and the scientists who 
developed it will now be convinced that when the chips are down 
the Government will also go down, on its knees. Delhi's 
inconsistency with the trials schedule is not simply a matter of 
changing dates. It sends an ominous signal that the country 
will succumb even at the cost of its security and sovereignty. 
After all, if there can be compromises over trial dates there 
is nothing to ensure that induction will not suffer the same 
fate. Testing is training, and greater the training the closer 
India is to perfection. In effect, it is a simple question of 
the vision for India. Prithvi, Agni et al, are metaphors for 
pride and respect. They have been made by, and for India. They 
are also essential in India's quest for an honourable place 
under the sun. But that presupposes a similar quest by those 
deciding the destiny of India.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Burnt-out Case"] </F>
  [Text] India must be an extremely rich country to be able 
to afford that curiously labelled `technology demonstrator' 
programme Agni, and then jettison it on a flight of whimsy. 
Countries with far greater affluence and a more experienced 
technical base have not been able to take that step. If they 
have invested countless man-hours and valuable resources, it has 
been with the sole aim of cashing in on the returns. And returns 
in the business of missiles is national security. A long-range 
missile means that the country which possesses it is capable of 
striking at enemy targets which are outside the range of its 
aircraft. As such, when countries develop missile systems, or 
demonstrate the technology as the Government of India would like 
the world to believe, they take the next logical step of 
deploying them. To contemplate any other step is tantamount to 
squandering the investment and, worse, taking a casual view of 
national security. But if the Narasimha Rao Government is to be 
believed, India is a land where money grows on trees and threats 
are the stuff of comic books. 
  The dilly-dallying on the Agni programme came to a rest with 
the Minister of State for Defence contradicting himself, the 
Project Director, scientists within the DRDO [Defense Research 
Development Organization] and above all else the Government's 
own threat scenarios. Agni is not going to fly any more because 
the funds to make it soar will not be made available. It is 
really as simple as turning the tap, and which the Government 
has finally admitted to having done to the Agni. The Agni saga 
now resembles a child's boredom with a toy, with the Government 
having satiated its attraction for high-technology gadgetry. It 
is a different matter that the boredom was occasioned by 
external pressure. And on that score the people of India have 
been doubly cheated. First by the wastage, and then by auxiliary 
considerations influencing decisions on the nation's security. 
Agni was developed for a purpose which in simple terms meant a 
platform for an Indian long-range missile system. The 
technologies demonstrated by Agni, to paraphrase the 
Government's curious expression, have little application for any 
other role but long-range missiles. They are now going to waste. 
  If some inspired regime in Washington considers India's 
missile programme akin to that of some third-world scoundrel the 
task of explaining the reality lies with Delhi. However, if 
Delhi itself has a pauperised vision why find faults elsewhere? 
By extinguishing Agni India has once again demonstrated that its 
vision rarely stretches beyond the Indus or, at least, the 
Khyber Pass. The continuation of the Prithvi programme, as a 
swap for Agni, is an indication of this abbreviated sense of 
security. Prithvi cannot make the Himalayas cease to exist, as 
the Agni can. And as the only nation with an ocean named after 
it, India's interests stretch at least that far. Servicing those 
interests obligates calls for purposeful leadership. But when 
the rulers run shy of greatness, it is nationhood that gets 
short-changed.

<F P=106> [By Ranjit Kumar] </F>
  [Text] India has achieved remarkable success in the 
production of high-quality fuel used in nuclear power plants. 
Due to its success in this field, India will no longer be 
dependent on the developed countries regarding nuclear energy. 
This has enabled India to join a select band of countries. 
India has successfully tried mixed uranium oxide as fuel for 
the Tarapur atomic power plant. It is worth mentioning that the 
United States refused to supply fuel for this plant and later 
prevented France from supplying fuel as well. The reason given 
was that India has not signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty. Indian scientists, however, have now developed an 
alternative to the U.S. fuel enriched uranium. Now India is 
ready to use indigenously developed fuel at Tarapur. 
  India has produced mixed uranium oxide fuel at the Advance 
Fuel Fabrication Center. A laboratory has also been set up to 
maintain the quality of mixed uranium oxide fuel. A plan has 
been prepared for plutonium reprocessing at the 200-megawatt 
pressurized heavy water reactor in Trombay. All practical 
aspects regarding the use of the alternative mixed uranium oxide 
as a fuel at Tarapur have been studied. Thus, in the nuclear 
power program, India has not only joined a select band of 
countries on the strength of its research, but additional 
successes achieved in the field of fuel fabrication has made it 
a world leader in some respects. 
  According to the annual report of the Department of Atomic 
Energy, India is successfully running the fast breeder test 
reactor at Kalpakkam. This marks the beginning of the second 
phase of the Indian nuclear energy program. The fuel fabricated 
for this fast breeder reactor is known as mixed 
uranium-plutonium carbide. The fuel is the total result of 
Indian efforts. This is the first time this fuel has been used 
in a fast breeder reactor. The Department of Atomic Energy is 
now preparing a blueprint for a 500-megawatt fast breeder test 
reactor using mixed uranium-plutonium carbide as a fuel. 
  India is now set to enter the ambitious third phase of its 
nuclear energy program. Under the third phase, fuel based on 
uranium-233 has been successfully fabricated. Encouraged by 
this success the Department of Atomic Energy has started working 
on the advanced heavy water reactor. This heavy water reactor 
will use thorium as fuel. The Kalpakkam fast breeder test 
reactor using indigenously fabricated carbide fuel has produced 
10.25 megawatt of electricity on trial basis. The research and 
development work at the Bhabha Atomic Research Center keeps in 
view the future needs of the country's nuclear energy program. 
The outcome of the center's research has greatly boosted hopes 
of increasing nuclear power production. The Bhabha research 
program includes development of the 500-megawatt pressurized 
heavy water reactor and thorium- based reactor. The fabrication 
of fuel at the nuclear power plants itself is considered as a 
significant success in the direction of producing power from 
nuclear energy. This step will help India achieve a credible 
self-reliance in the field of nuclear energy. India can now 
escape from the pressures like the one applied by the United 
States for signing the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in return 
for the fuel for Tarapur.

  [Text] Tehran, May 19 (AFP)--Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar 
Velayati will pay the first visit to Cairo by a senior Iranian 
official since the 1979 Islamic revolution when he attends a 
meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) later this month, the 
TEHRAN TIMES said Thursday. Iran and Egypt broke ties after the 
revolution and maintain diplomatic contact at interest section 
level. 
  The paper said Velayati, who is due to leave for Cairo on 
May 
30, could meet his Egyptian counterpart 'Amr Musa, but they 
"would not" discuss improving bilateral ties. 
  The Iranian minister will be accompanied by a high-level 
political and economic delegation including a member of 
parliament's foreign affairs subcommittee, Jalal Sadatian, the 
English-language daily said. 
  Since the revolution Tehran has been represented at 
international conferences in Cairo through low-ranking 
officials. The two governments have on several occasions 
expressed a desire to improve ties, but no breakthrough has yet 
been made due to the opposition from Islamic hardliners in Iran. 
The news of a meeting last September between Velayati and Musa 
in the sidelines of UN General Assembly triggered criticism from 
radicals.

  [Text] London, May 20, IRNA -- Britain's soured diplomatic 
relations with Iran has continued to have repercussions on trade 
between the two countries, which has fallen by 30 percent during 
the first quarter of 1994 compared with the same period last 
year. The latest official figures show the UK's total trade 
with Iran in March was only pnds 54 million, a third down on the 
corresponding month in 1993. Predictions are that the amount 
could slump even further following the discovery of a bug in 
Iran's London Embassy. 
  Most of the drop in business between the two countries is 
due 
to Tehran buying only pnds 32 m worth of goods from Britain 
during March, 40 percent less than last year. Iran's exports 
for the month, although pnds 4 m down, were actually the highest 
since May 1993. 
  London's relations with Iran have been sour since the 
Islamic 
revolution in 1979, and trade has remained at only a fraction of 
what was Britain's largest market in the Middle East. 
  In 1989, ties were finally severed by Tehran following the 
worldwide controversy over the publication of Salman Rushdie's 
blasphemous book, `The Satanic Verses,' and were not renewed 
until the British Government clarified its position on the issue. 
  Subsequent expectations of relations to reach ambassadorial 
level have not since been fulfilled and instead, there has been 
renewed concern that Iran's Majles may again be led to break 
ties, unless the matter of bugging of Tehran's London mission is 
resolved.

  [Text] Tehran, May 19, IRNA -- President Akbar 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani while inaugurating Iran's first plant 
manufacturing optic fiber and solar cells Thursday, said the 
Islamic Republic relied less on foreign currencies during its 
reconstruction era. 
  "The world's situation is such that we can prepare all our 
needed goods from various countries, even from those which are 
enemies of the Islamic revolution," the president said during 
his 3-hour visit to the plant which is affiliated to the 
Ministry of Post, Telephone and Telegraph. Addressing the staff 
of the plant, the president said that all doors were open for 
reconstruction of the country and that "our vigilant people are 
ready to bear hardships to insure the prosperity of their 
children in the future." He pointed to the significance of 
solar energy and energies generated by wind and sea, saying that 
all these types of energy could be generated inside the country. 
"Such energies may not be economical at present but we should 
lay the foundation of this," he added. 
  Referring to the government's investments in martyr Raja'i 
and martyr 'Abbaspur hydroelectric power stations, he said "the 
energy generated by the two power plants is cheap, sustainable 
and safe... fortunately we ourselves build such dams, using 
domestic resources." 
  He said that the optic fiber and solar cells plant, the 
first 
of its kind in Iran, was of great importance in area of using 
solar energy. He said that it was very important that small 
solar power plants be installed in mountainous and rugged rural 
regions where setting up of power transmission lines would be 
uneconomical. 
  President Hashemi-Rafsanjani said though solar energy might 
be more expensive than other types of energies, its advantages 
over other sorts of energies necessiated its use.

  [Text] London, May 19, IRNA -- The London office of the 
Persian daily ETTELA'AT announced Thursday that it had 
successfully issued its special international edition in New 
York for the first time this week. 
  The international edition was launched initially in London 
two months ago as a weekly to cater for the Iranian community in 
the UK and elsewhere in Europe. Its 12-page format includes a 
section in English and was said to have proved very popular. 
  The paper is edited in Tehran and beamed for publication by 
satellite to London as well as New York, which will assist the 
speed of publication throughout America. 
  Plans were said by ETTELA'AT to be well advanced for a 
special daily international edition, which could start as early 
as next week and like the weekly version, will differ in content 
to the Persian afternoon edition available in Tehran. 
  The London office spoke favorably about the successful 
launch 
of Iran's first newspaper to be printed abroad since the Islamic 
revolution, which is available from newsagents, Iranian shops or 
through subscription.

  [Text] Islamabad, May 18 -- As President Farooq Ahmed 
Leghari embarked on a two-week "unofficial", but "working" visit 
to the United States, official circles here on Wednesday 
expressed cautious optimism on improvement of bilateral 
relations between Washington and Islamabad. 
  "The delivery of F-16s to Pakistan and the issue of 
non-intrusive inspection of our nuclear facilities by the United 
States, will possibly come under review during President Farooq 
Leghari's deliberations with the Clinton Administration," 
Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali told newsmen. 
  In the light of India's refusal to the US proposals on its 
nuclear non-proliferation Sardar Asif was asked to clarify 
Pakistan's position on its acceptance of nuclear "non-intrusive" 
inspection. He said: "If the US proposals are acceptable to 
Pakistan and are totally in line with our nuclear policy, we 
will accept them." 
  Would Pakistan then be accepting them unilaterally, given 
the 
fact that India had already rejected all such American 
proposals? The Foreign Minister was unable to give a 
satisfactory reply. 
  Conceding that the "United States through its non-intrusive 
technical means was satisfied that Pakistan had not as yet 
produced nuclear weapons," the Foreign Minister listed recent 
positive developments which indicated a renewed US understanding 
of Pakistan's stated position on its nuclear programme, which 
was now more "even-handed." 
  "The fact that the United States has not asked us to roll 
back our nuclear programme, but to cap it instead, and its 
viewing of the non-proliferation issue in the context of 
regional security," puts Pakistan on a "high moral ground", as 
opposed to India, who has bluntly refused the US proposals on 
capping and verifiable physical or nonphysical inspection of its 
nuclear sites, he said. 
  The Foreign Minister was confident about Pakistan would not 
only get the 38 F-16s but also succeed in resolving the nuclear 
issue with the United States by the end of this year. "But, our 
view on receipt of F-16s and capping of our nuclear programme is 
very clear: the two have nothing to do with each other," Sardar 
Asif pointed out. 
  On the downside of US-Pakistan relations, Sardar Asif, 
reacting sharply to the American State Department spokesman, 
Mike McCurry's statement on alleged official Pakistani support 
to the Kashmiri Mujahideen and that Pakistan could be put on the 
terrorist list any time, said: "We are extremely surprised that 
a senior official should make such an allegation against 
Pakistan. It leads us to believe that these kinds of statements 
are made perhaps to please Mr Narasimha Rao." 
  Sardar Asif said the Western world was bending backwards to 
please the Indian Prime Minister. "Selling cokes appears more 
important than solving the human rights problems," he remarked 
in reply to a question about the West disregarding India's human 
rights violations in lieu of economic trade-offs. 
  Sardar Asif, who leaves for Afghanistan on May 24 carrying 
peace proposals for the Afghan leaders, told newsmen that apart 
from re-opening the Pakistan mission in Kabul in the building 
the British government has partly handed over, he will discuss 
the possibility of opening another mission in Herat with General 
Ismail Khan. 
  The foreign minister will float the idea for an Afghanistan 
peace making fund, because when normality is restored, 
Afghanistan will need a lot of money for reconstruction.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali said that 
Pakistan is ready to consider any proposal, which is aimed at 
verifying without interference, that its nuclear program is not 
weapons-oriented. Talking to newsmen at the Foreign Office in 
Islamabad yesterday, he said that Pakistan has repeatedly made 
it clear that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes and 
the United States has accepted the Pakistani position. He said 
that Pakistan will not relinquish its principled stand on the 
nuclear issue, but is ready to consider any proposal aimed at 
nonintrusive verification. 
  The foreign minister said that although Pakistan does have 
the capability to manufacture a nuclear weapon, a political 
decision has been taken that it will not be manufactured. He 
said the decision has nothing to do with the United States or 
anyone else. 
  Answering a question, the foreign minister said that 
Pakistan 
is not engaged in any secret diplomacy with the United States 
and it will not compromise on the nuclear issue. He regretted 
that India rejected every aspect of the U.S. proposal on making 
South Asia a nuclear-free zone.

Salamah Ni'mat: "Damascus: Differences Still Wide; Christopher 
To Return at the End of the Month"] 
  [Excerpt] Washington, Damascus, Amman, Tunis, occupied 
Jerusalem, AL-HAYAH -- The Syrian presidential palace stressed 
at the end of President Hafiz al-Asad's talks with U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher yesterday that 
"differences are still wide" between Syria and Israel over the 
peace process. 
  Christopher departed Damascus for Cairo yesterday afternoon 
where he met with President Husni Mubarak and Egyptian Foreign 
Minister 'Amr Musa. He briefed them on the results of his talks 
with Syrian and Israeli officials. 
  An Egyptian Foreign Ministry spokesman told AL-HAYAH that 
the 
talks focused primarily on the Syrian-Israeli track, which is 
receiving the United States' attention to stress that what it is 
seeking is indeed a comprehensive peace. 
  In Damascus, Christopher held a round of talks with 
President 
al-Asad. 
  In a statement to AL-HAYAH U.S. sources expected Secretary 
Christopher to return to the region at the end of the month to 
resume his role in conveying ideas between the two sides and 
bring their views on a peace solution closer, as Israel 
continues to give precedence to normalization questions, 
confidence-building measures, and security arrangements over the 
withdrawal question. While Syria stresses that the peace process 
begins when Israel is committed to full withdrawal from the 
Golan. Then it would discuss with Israel the question of equal 
security arrangements, relations, and other questions. 
  Al-Asad met with Christopher in the presence of Foreign 
Minister Faruq al-Shar' and Dennis Ross, U.S. coordinator of the 
peace process. Presidential spokesman Jubran Kuriyah announced 
after the meeting, which lasted four hours, that al-Asad had 
been handed a message from President Bill Clinton, "stressing 
the U.S. keenness to continue its efforts to achieve a 
fundamental breakthrough in the peace process. While the Syrian 
president renewed his demand that Israel withdraw from the 
occupied Golan Heights to the 4 June [1967] lines." 
  Kuriyah pointed out that al-Asad "expressed his appreciation 
for U.S. efforts, stressing Syria's keenness to continue the 
peace process to achieve a just and comprehensive solution to 
the Arab-Israeli dispute in accordance with the resolutions of 
international legitimacy and the land for peace principle." 
  He added that "Christopher briefed al-Asad on the results of 
his talks in Israel which demonstrated that the differences are 
still wide because the Israeli stand is far from the foundations 
and requirements of the peace process launched at the Madrid 
conference" in 1991. The presidential spokesman added that the 
Syrian president renewed his country's "position on and 
commitment to the foundations of the peace process based on the 
Security Council resolutions, which commit Israel to full 
withdrawal to the 4 June 1967 lines in order to achieve a just 
and comprehensive solution in the region." Syrian sources have 
said that when Christopher comes to Damascus carrying "Israel's 
agreement to full withdrawal to the 4 June borders, he will have 
brought a key for the launch of a process" toward achieving 
progress in the peace negotiations. While al-Asad stressed the 
existence of "wide differences" between Syria and Israel, 
Israeli radio yesterday spoke about Syria's "flexibility" in its 
peace stands. [passage omitted]

  Discussion dealt with the Arab situation and the ALO 
activities. 
  Khaddam also received at 1300 (Jacob Kleinberger), Swiss 
secretary of state for foreign affairs. The meeting was 
attended by Swiss ambassador in Damascus Kurt Wyss. Talks dealt 
with the situation in the region, the international situation, 
and latest developments in the peace process. 
  Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' received (Kleinberger) this 
morning. The meeting was attended by Yusuf Shakkur, assistant 
to the foreign minister; Muwaffaq Nassar, director of the 
Western Europe Desk; (Martin Schbkhar), director of the Middle 
East Department at the Swiss Foreign Ministry; and the Swiss 
ambassador in Damascus. 
  Talks centered on the latest developments in the peace 
process in light of the results of the Geneva summit between 
Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton, and the latest tours 
of U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in the region. 
  The foreign minister said the Israeli proposals conveyed by 
Secretary Christopher during his latest visit did not help 
achieve progress because they were based on premeditated Israeli 
intentions not to fully withdraw from the territories that were 
occupied in 1967. 
  (Kleinberger) expressed the Swiss Government's position in 
support of the peace process on the basis of implementing 
Security Council resolutions and the principle of land for peace. 
  The Swiss secretary of state for foreign affairs arrived in 
Damascus yesterday afternoon.

<F P=106> [Report by Raghidah Dirgham and Ibrahim Humaydi: "Israel </F>
Proposes Comprehensive Deal `Assuming' Full Withdrawal in Five 
Years"] 
  [Excerpts] New York, Damascus, occupied Jerusalem -- U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher yesterday evening conveyed 
to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres the outcome of his talks in Damascus with 
President Hafiz al-Asad and Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' on 
peace between the two sides and ways of reactivating direct 
bilateral negotiations. 
  While Syrian sources spoke of the negotiations' entering "a 
new and fundamental phase dealing with minute details," 
well-informed sources in New York told AL-HAYAH that Christopher 
had carried to the Syrian leadership a new Israeli offer which 
represents "an integrated deal" that covers all the elements 
concerning the Syrian-Israeli relationship, beginning with 
security through to details of a specific timetable for 
withdrawal from the Golan, as well as Hizballah's future in 
southern Lebanon. 
  The sources added that the new Israeli offer stipulates a 
phased withdrawal to be completed in five years, not eight years 
as mentioned in the first offer. The Israeli proposal "assumes" 
"full" withdrawal from the Golan, linking this with the other 
elements in the deal, first and foremost security, not only with 
regard to the Golan but in southern Lebanon as well, since 
disarming Hizballah represents one of the deal's elements. 
  U.S. and Israeli diplomatic sources expect "difficult and 
protracted negotiations" with the Syrians. They point out that, 
if the Syrians and the Israelis want to reach an agreement, this 
agreement should be reached within a year, that is before 
Israeli elections begin. [passage omitted] 
  In Damascus, well-informed sources expect Christopher to 
return to the Syrian capital to convey Israel's position on the 
Syrian plan and to resume his role in bringing views closer. 
They told AL-HAYAH that Damascus is still awaiting the 
"password" from the Israelis. "We are still awaiting the word 
`full' withdrawal from the Golan. When they agree to it, all 
possibilities will open to discuss all the other questions that 
follow that." [passage omitted] 
  Syrian sources have said that the peace process has entered 
"a new and fundamental phase" with Christopher's conveying of 
the two sides' views of peace. They added that Christopher's 
decision to return to Damascus "means that there are extensive 
U.S. efforts aimed at steps to help the parties to move closer 
to one another and make progress on the long road toward peace." 
They went on to say that Damascus "welcomes the U.S. endeavors 
and hopes that the U.S. secretary's tour will result in a 
fundamental and constructive breakthrough, in order to advance 
the peace process and consolidate the constants of a peaceful 
solution." The sources reemphasized that "the condition needed 
to make Christopher's mission a success is Israel's response to 
full withdrawal from the Golan." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Press review] </F>
  [Text] Under the headline "Requirements For Peace," 
AL-THAWRAH says: From the outcome of U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher's talks in the region, it became apparent 
that the gap in viewpoints on peace and means to achieve it is 
very large because the Israeli position is very far from the 
foundations and requirements of the peace process launched in 
the Madrid conference. 
  The paper notes that the Israeli position on the peace 
process and its objectives is characterized by a disdain for the 
peace process, avoidance of its objective -- comprehensive peace 
-- and an attempt to replace it with the objective of partial 
solutions. 
  The paper adds: In contrast, the Syrian position on the 
peace process and its objective is characterized by concern for 
the peace process and full accord with the Madrid formula and 
the resolutions of international legitimacy. This position was 
reaffirmed by President Hafiz al-Asad when he received the U.S. 
secretary of state the day before yesterday. 
  AL-THAWRAH says: In light of the obvious contradiction 
between the Syrian and Israeli positions, one important fact 
emerges: The peace which Israel seeks to achieve is different 
from that which the world and the Arabs want for the region. 
  The paper stresses: The kind of peace the world agrees upon 
and for which the Arabs entered into talks in Madrid and 
Washington is the kind of peace based on justice and 
comprehensiveness and the kind of peace that returns to the 
Arabs their rights and occupied territories in full. 
  Concluding its editorial, AL-THAWRAH says: Because the 
Israeli position is still far from the foundations and 
requirements of the peace process, the U.S. sponsor must build a 
new direction for his efforts, based on providing all that is 
necessary to force Israel to accept the requirements of the 
peace process, on top of which is complete, unconditional 
withdrawal. 
  On the same subject, AL-THAWRAH says: The outcome of 
Christopher's talks in Israel has revealed the big gap between 
Israeli and Syrian positions on peace because Israel is very far 
from the foundations and requirements of the peace process, 
which started in the Madrid conference. 
  The paper adds: Syria has stressed, and still stresses, 
concern for the continuation of the peace process and a 
commitment to continue to make efforts to push this process 
forward. It has also responded, and still responds, positively 
to U.S. efforts in that regard. Syria, at the same time, 
adheres to the resolutions of legitimacy and the UN Security 
Council which obliges Israel to withdraw completely to the 4 
June 1967 borders as the condition without which the just and 
comprehensive peace in the region cannot be attained. 
  Concluding its editorial, the paper stresses the need for 
Washington's assuming the role of the unbiased, fair, and 
effective partner by forcing Israel to submit to international 
legitimacy and its resolutions. 
  Under the headline "No Peace Without Land," AL-BA'TH says in 
its editorial today that the U.S. initiative, which is based on 
the land-for-peace formula, constituted the foundation on which 
the Madrid Middle East peace conference was based. Resolutions 
242 and 338 were considered the legal instruments that make the 
Israeli occupation of the Arab territories null, rejected, and 
impermissible, the paper says. 
  The paper notes that all those interested in world peace 
have 
acknowledged the importance of Syria's positive role in the 
peace process since its acceptance to attend the Madrid 
conference. They considered that acceptance to be the most 
important in creating a new reality based on just and 
comprehensive peace in the Middle East. 
  AL-BA'TH says: When the rounds of Washington bilateral talks 
started, the Arabs felt that Israel was refusing to give 
specific pledges to implement international legitimacy and that 
its maneuvers constituted an extortion of the state sponsoring 
the talks. With the start of every round of talks, Israel 
wanted new weapons and fresh financial grants. Every round was 
also preceded by a flagrant Israeli attack against Lebanon or a 
massacre of the Palestinian people on their soil. 
  The paper stresses: From day one in the Madrid conference, 
Israel knew that withdrawal from all of the Golan Heights is an 
indispensable condition for establishing peace with Syria. It 
must also be stressed that Israeli occupation of every inch of 
the Arab territories must end on the basis of the initiative on 
which the Madrid conference was based. 
  AL-BA'TH concludes by saying: If Israel is serious about 
achieving peace, then the Arabs have responded favorably to 
Madrid and Washington talks because they are advocates of peace 
and because peace is their objective.

    [Editorial report] The following review of the 10 May issue 
of Cairo AL-SHA'B summarizes articles that are Islamic in nature. 
<H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>
  1. Lawyer Tortured to Death 
  2. Islamists Win Lawyers Election. 
  3. Anti-Islamic Quarters Behind Yemen's War 
  4. 4 May Day of Mourning for Palestine 
  5. Ban on Islamic Writer Blamed on President 
  6. Roots of Violence in Dayrut Analyzed 
  7. Mufti's Fatwa on Child Care Criticized 
  8. Security Men Kill Student in Asyut 
<H5>  LAWYER TORTURED TO DEATH </H5>
  An approximately 1,500-word report by Khalid Yunus on pages 
1 
and 7 describes the "state of anger and furor" that gripped 
lawyers following the death of lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani 
during "torture" at a State Security Intelligence office 
following his arrest on 26 April. An emergency meeting of the 
Lawyers Association Council on 7 May decided to report the 
incident to the public attorney to order an autopsy on Madani's 
body to determine the cause of death. In addition, the council 
decided to "stage a sit-in at the association's headquarters 
until an inquiry is opened and the names of the culprits 
announced, to hold a funeral march for the martyr from the 
association's building, to declare a one-day public strike at 
every state court, and to pay a sum to the martyr's family in 
compensation." A statement by the council warned that the crime 
will not go unpunished. The Egyptian Human Rights Organization 
has issued a statement expressing concern and regret at the 
circumstances surrounding the death of its member, Madani. The 
statement feared that the death could have been the result of 
"torture" following his arrest. The organization gave its 
account of how Madani was arrested at his office and of the 
"illegal and repressive measures" used during the arrest. The 
deceased, the statement noted, was blindfolded by security men 
and taken to an unknown destination. After noting that his 
colleagues confirmed that Madani had been in "good health," the 
statement referred to its request to the public attorney on 7 
May to set up an independent medical team to conduct an autopsy 
on Madani's body. 
<H5>  ISLAMISTS WIN LAWYERS ELECTION </H5>
  An approximately 100-word unattributed report on page one 
reports the victory of named Islamic candidates in elections to 
fill half the seats of the Lawyers Association Council in 
al-Jizah on 8 May. The turnout is said to have been over 75 
percent. 
<H5>  ANTI-ISLAMIC QUARTERS BEHIND YEMEN'S WAR </H5>
  Chief Editor Majdi Ahmad Husayn, in a 2,500-word article on 
page 3 entitled "The Desert Storm Reaches Yemen," views the war 
in Yemen. Noting that the Gulf war was a "link in a chain to 
rechart the map of the Arab region to confront the Islamic tide, 
Husayn adds that the "Western camp and its advocates in the 
region continue to reshape the region and finish off the 
Arab-Islamic front that has rejected the foreign military 
presence." After reviewing aspects of what is seen as a Western 
onslaught on Islamic movements in Tunis, Algeria, Lebanon, and 
Sudan, Husayn says: "Yemen is now paying the price of its 
independence," because, the writer adds, it seems that the 
United States "accepts nothing short of obedience, blind 
obedience." After tracing the course of Yemen's unity and the 
Islamists' participation in power through the alliance between 
the General People's Congress and the Reform Party, Husayn 
claims that as a result, Yemen became an "aberration" of the 
U.S. order imposed on the region, in view of Yemen's 
independence and the Islamists' participation in power, which 
could lead them to win by a majority in any election and thus 
rule the country singlehanded. As a result, he adds, the 
Marxists of the south were encouraged by some Gulf quarters and 
the United States to stiffen their position, even if it led to a 
separation from the north. He adds: Dividing Yemen into two 
states is the West's "ultimate goal." 
  Muslim Brotherhood Deputy Guide Mustafa Mashhur echoes the 
same theme in part of his approximately 2,000-word article on 
page 5. He asks: "What promoted south Yemen to conclude unity 
with north Yemen four years ago? And why is it adopting this 
stance today, a stance that could bring unity to an end?" He 
adds: "We know there are quarters that want to fragment the 
Arab and Islamic world and preclude any unity. These quarters 
move other hands to stir sedition among the Arab peoples, as was 
the case in Somalia, where thousands were killed and hundreds of 
thousands were displaced." 

<H5>    4 MAY DAY OF MOURNING FOR PALESTINE </H5>
  Writer Muhammad Abu-al-Futuh, in an approximately 1,200-word 
article on page 4 entitled "A Day of Mourning by Arabism And 
Islam for Palestine", writes on the self-rule agreement signed 
between the PLO and Israel in Cairo on 4 May. He notes that the 
4 May agreement is not the choice of the Islamic people, who 
believe that Palestine is Islamic and who have faith that jihad 
is the way to liberate and restore it. He adds: "We must 
realize that our enemy knows for certain that the threat to its 
usurpation of Palestine comes from the pan-Arab current as well 
as the rising Islamic tide, and that is why it is lying in wait 
against these two forces." 
  Muslim Brotherhood Deputy Guide Mustafa Mashhur shares 
Abu-al-Futuh's views in his article on page 5. He notes that 
the Gaza-Jericho agreement has been depicted as a "historic 
victory" for the PLO, whereas in fact it is an utter "disgrace, 
shame, and humiliation." He points out that the record of the 
"Zionist enemy" is replete with incidents against peace, so how 
could there be peace between it and the Palestinian people? He 
concludes by urging the current Muslim generations not to be 
duped by the peace "festivals" aimed at giving legitimacy to the 
"humiliating defeat" in this agreement. Palestine, he adds, 
will remain alive in the hearts of every Muslim until it is 
fully liberated and the al-Aqsa Mosque rescued from captivity. 
<H5>  BAN ON ISLAMIC WRITER BLAMED ON PRESIDENT </H5>
  In an approximately 600-word article on page 12, Muslim 
Brotherhood member and writer Muhammad 'Abd-al-Quddus notes that 
Islamic writer Fahmy Huwaydi's weekly articles in AL-AHRAM are 
still banned. After noting that the ban shames the newspaper 
itself and discredits the regime's claims that it does not ban 
any writer or opinion, 'Abd-al-Quddus points out that a review 
of some of the banned articles he has seen shows that the ban is 
sheer injustice. One of the articles, he says, speaks about the 
application of Islamic Shari'ah in Kuwait, in which the writer 
cautioned against any hasty implementation of Islamic rulings 
since this could be harmful to Islam. Another banned article, 
'Abd-al-Quddus adds, notes the defeat of secularism in Turkey on 
its home grounds at the hands of the Islamists. Defending 
Huwaydi, the writer notes that the prominent Islamic writer is 
accused of being extremist, but his views in defense of the 
Copts and democracy attest to the contrary. He adds: "I believe 
that banning his articles is not the responsibility of the chief 
editor alone, since the owner of the newspaper has greater 
responsibility--and by the owner I mean the head of state, who 
owns AL-AHRAM as well as other government papers and who makes 
appointments there." He notes that it is clear that "the 
president of the republic does not encourage any talk about the 
application of shari'ah in our country; in fact, the contrary is 
definitely true. The prevailing tendency under the current 
regime is to try to separate religion and the state." In 
conclusion, the writer gives the following advice to the 
president: "Beware of those who seek to deify you. They are 
the ones responsible for 'Abd-al-Nasir and al-Sadat's drift. 
Remember your first years in power, when you were very 
sensitive to anything that could tarnish your image among the 
people, rejected hypocrisy, and viewed your birthday as a 
personal occasion and not an opportunity to glorify yourself." 
  Touching on the same topic, writer Midhat Abu-al-Fadl notes 
in his approximately 1,500-word article on page 8 that there is 
a "coordinated media campaign seeking to exclude moderate 
Islamists from public work or to harass them, if possible. This 
campaign is now focusing on the well-known Islamic writer Fahmi 
Huwaydi." He notes that the secularists in charge of this 
campaign use all means, legitimate and otherwise, to attain 
their goals, which shows that to the secularists freedom of 
opinion is nothing but a slogan. He cites as an example an 
article by writer Dr. 'Abd-al-'Azim Ramadan published in the 
magazine UKTUBAR on 1 May, in which Ramadan accused Huwaydi of 
defending terrorism. After refuting Ramadan's claims, 
Abu-al-Fadl says that Ramadan is inciting the authorities 
against a man whose only fault is using his right of freedom of 
speech. 

<H5>    ROOTS OF VIOLENCE IN DAYRUT ANALYZED </H5>
  An approximately 3,000-word report by Jamal Imbabi on page 6 
views the situation in the city of Dayrut, with its violence 
between security forces and Islamic groups. The writer 
interviews several officials and citizens, who give opinions of 
the roots of violence in the city, which is situated 60 km north 
of Asyut. Former People's Assembly deputy Ahmad 'Abd-al-Rahim 
believes that the ruling National Democratic Party has kept 
itself busy with partisan affairs and left the way open to the 
Islamic militants to build clinics, schools, and Koranic 
recitation centers and to organize religious seminars. In the 
absence of a state role, these groups helped the poor and 
assisted students. Thanks to the political vacuum, many 
accepted their beliefs, 'Abd-al-Rahim adds. Another former 
People's Assembly member, Husam al-Kilani, attributes the spread 
of these groups and the rise in violence to unemployment and a 
deterioration in the standards of living. Teacher Ibrahim Zayid 
blames the violence on police brutality and mistreatment of 
people. The writer notes that despite the relative calm in the 
city of Dayrut, security sources say that 13 senior members of 
the group are still at large. According to the chief of 
intelligence in Dayrut, once they are captured, 80 percent of 
violence in the city will end, since it will be very hard for 
the group to find similar experienced people. 
<H5>  MUFTI'S FATWA ON CHILD CARE CRITICIZED </H5>
  A 200-word report by 'Amir 'Abd-al-Mun'im on page 7 
criticizes Shaykh Sayyid Tantawi, mufti of the republic, for 
passing what the writer terms a "strange" fatwa, or religious 
ruling. The mufti ruled that it is permissible for the state 
"to enact a law withholding medical care and educational 
benefits from the family's third child as part of its family 
planning campaign." According to the mufti, "The officials in 
charge may restrict what is permissible if the ruler and 
officials see a need for this after consulting with the experts, 
so long as the restriction serves the nation's interests." 
<H5>  SECURITY MEN KILL STUDENT IN ASYUT </H5>
  An unattributed report on page 7 notes that State Security 
Intelligence men shot Amin Shafiq Hammam, a student in al-Azhar 
University branch in Asyut, after having kidnapped him from his 
room in the university dormitory on 25 April. A statement by 
al-Azhar University students in Asyut notes that Hammam was 
taken in a car to al-Walidiyah neighborhood, where shots were 
heard. Next day, the students were surprised to read in the 
papers that Hammam had been killed in a clash with security 
forces and that he was found to be in possession of weapons and 
explosives.

<F P=106> [Article by Jalal Duwaydar: "Solidarity To Abort Foreign </F>
Funding of Terrorism"] 
  [Text] There may be a gray cloud over Egyptian-Kuwaiti 
relations as a result of some irresponsible behavior by certain 
groups or societies, either through good intentions or bad, on 
the pretext that they are working for the Islamic call, even if 
this conflicts with the values, principles, and tolerance of the 
religion. No one can actually claim that the official Kuwaiti 
organs are responsible for this behavior or that they know of it. 
  Our brilliant Kuwaiti colleague, Ahmad al-Jarallah, writer 
for AL-SIYASAH newspaper, wrote an article about this issue, 
which has been republished by AKHBAR AL-YAWM. He linked the 
fact that President Mubarak did not visit Kuwait on his journey 
home from China to the material and propaganda support the 
terrorist movements are getting from certain religious societies. 
  Perhaps al-Jarallah's analysis is correct, or perhaps it 
exaggerates. But there is no doubt that he supports his view 
well by referring to the incident in which a Kuwaiti citizen who 
has close links with a famous Kuwaiti Islamic society arrived in 
Cairo with thousands of dollars that he was going to spend in a 
suspicious way. He claimed that the money was to be used to 
publish some books. 
  We must praise the successes of the Egyptian security 
forces, 
which have recently taken matters into their own hands. They 
have succeeded in forestalling numerous terrorist acts, and in 
following and tracking down the leaders of this terrorism and 
the people who plan and support it inside and outside Egypt. 
Undoubtedly this is an important and necessary accomplishment 
to confront this criminal scheme. The objective of this scheme 
was to shake the stability and security of Egypt and cause 
seriously hurt the Egyptian people. 
  The fact that the security organs found large amounts of 
foreign currency in some terrorist dens has raised questions 
about its sources. 
  It was also natural that there is a growing conviction that 
there is foreign funding to buy weapons, pay agents, and spend 
set up and carry out terrorist crimes. 
  It is no secret to anyone that in some Arab countries that 
hide behind the cloak of Islam, the religion of justice, some 
groups and societies are soliciting funds from their citizens on 
the pretext of helping Bosnia or Afghanistan, since Islam is a 
just religion. But these funds are actually being used to 
support and bolster terrorists directly or indirectly. 
  In Kuwait, when meeting with Egyptian Tourism Minister Dr. 
Mamduh al-Biltaji and his delegation at the beginning of this 
week, Kuwaiti Amir Shaykh Jabir al-Ahmad focussed on the firm 
Egyptian-Kuwaiti relations. 
  He said that under no circumstances could his country forget 
the kindness of Egypt and the Egyptians during the liberation 
war, and in fact for scores of years even before that, before 
God granted it its oil wealth. 
  He said that Egyptian teachers, engineers, doctors, and 
workers have contributed toward the education and medical 
treatment of Kuwaiti citizens. This means that Kuwait's 
progress and development go back to their efforts. 
  The amir of Kuwait added that Egypt is the heart of the Arab 
nation and that what befalls it, befalls the whole Arab nation. 
The amir of Kuwait pointed out that terrorism and extremism 
have nothing to do with the true religion; extremism is a 
phenomenon in all religions. He affirmed that Islam has 
absolutely nothing to do with such behavior. 
  As for the heir apparent of Kuwait, Sa'd al-'Abdallah, he 
spoke with great zeal about the strong fraternal relations 
between Egypt and Kuwait. When discussion turned to the Kuwaiti 
citizens' enthusiasm for visiting Egypt, he said in very clear 
terms that the Kuwaiti Government cannot and will not allow any 
Kuwaiti citizen to misbehave in Egypt or to commit any act that 
harms its security and stability. He affirmed that the Kuwaiti 
Government, which he heads, is ready to take the strictest 
measures possible against any Kuwaiti citizen who entertains 
ideas of this kind or violates the law. 
  Actually, what the amir and heir apparent of Kuwait said in 
my presence confirm the importance of Arab and Islamic 
solidarity in containing the phenomenon of terrorism, whose 
objective is to weaken the Arabs and harm Islam, which is being 
subjected to a slander campaign by being linked to murderers, 
criminals, and saboteurs. 
  During the big party given by Khalid al-Marzuq, the great 
lover of Egypt and owner of AL-ANBA' newspaper, which was 
attended by high Kuwaiti officials in honor of Egypt and the 
Egyptian delegation led by Mamduh al-Biltaji, the issue of the 
Kuwaiti citizen arrested in Cairo with thousands of dollars was 
brought up. Investigators claim that he was supposed to hand it 
over to some terrorist elements. This came out at the party in a 
chat Dr. al-Biltaji had with Shaykh Khalid Sultan, head of the 
Kuwaiti society to which the arrested Kuwaiti citizen belongs. 
Shaykh Sultan tried to deny that this Kuwaiti had any ties with 
Egyptian terrorists. He affirmed to Dr. al-Biltaji his respect 
for Egypt and concern for its security and stability. 
  It has become well-known that terrorist operations, which 
Islam is being falsely accused of, are only a continuation of 
the campaign to attack and destroy the unity and solidarity of 
the Arab and Islamic nation in confronting international changes. 
  Perhaps the most important proof of this is that the current 
image that terrorism is blatant arose after the foolish Iraqi 
invasion of Kuwait. Also, terrorism is not at all free of 
responsibility for sedition in fraternal Yemen, which is 
currently going through a bloody and terrible war, the victims 
of which are the Yemeni people themselves.

  [Text] Aden, Yemen, May 19 (AFP)--Northern forces of 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih tried to lay siege to this key 
port-city on Thursday [19 May], as the United Nations prepared 
to send vital aid to trapped Somali refugees. 
  Artillery battles were raging a few dozens kilometers 
(miles) 
of Aden, bastion of southern leader Vice President 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid, an AFP correspondent said. 
  Salih, quoted Thursday by the northern-run agency SABA', 
said 
his forces had scored "one victory after another against the 
separatist forces," in a reference to the southerners. 
  Aden, a port-city of half a million, was "almost surrounded" 
following two weeks of civil war, a northern spokesman in the 
capital Sanaa earlier told AFP. 
  But he said the objective was not to enter the city, so as 
"to avoid war on the streets, but to put it under blockade, to 
bomb military targets," in order to force al-Bid and his aides 
"to surrender or quit the country." 
  Southerners have insisted Aden was well defended and they 
can 
keep the northerners at bay. Fighting was still going on for 
control of the key air base of al-'Anad, north of here. 
  Meanwhile, the United Nations said it was to send a food 
convoy to a camp in southern Yemen where thousands of Somali 
refugees who fled their own civil war are trapped in crossfire. 
  Rolf Guldberg, UN High Commissioner for Refugees 
representative in Sanaa, told AFP the Somalis were in an "active 
war zone" and the convoy could only leave once fighting subsided. 
  The refugees were either still in the al-Qud camp on a beach 
near Zinjibar, 50 kilometers (32 miles) northeast of Aden, or 
were sheltering at a nearby village, he said. 
  The region has been the scene of fierce fighting and 
hundreds 
of the Somalis have reportedly been killed in crossfire, while 
the plight of the remainder was grim. 
  The current republic of Yemen was created on May 22, 1990, 
with the merger of the former conservative North and Marxist 
South states. 
  Al-Bid on Wednesday hinted for the first time that the 
two-week old war could cause the south to break away. 
  "After all these massacres and these sacrifices, I don't 
know 
how we are going to live together again," al-Bid told the 
London-based Saudi Middle East Broadcasting Television. 
  "I don't know what direction we will finally take but I can 
tell you that it was 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih who has proclaimed 
secession in declaring war." 
  Neither side nor the International Committee of the Red 
Cross 
have so far issued a casualty toll. 
  But ICRC official in Sanaa Arnold Luethold told AFP his 
organisation had counted a large number of POWs on both sides.

Kurdistan has announced that his movement carried out military 
operations yesterday, during which it regained Tappah Kurrah, 
(Muhammad Abad), (Kumalar), Anab, Bakrawah, Sirah, and Halabjah 
from the forces of the Patriot Union of Kurdistan [PUK], at the 
same time killing a number of PUK troops.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by Lothar </F>
Menne; place and date not given: "End of Hunting Season"] 
  [Text] [Menne] Foreign Minister, when we met one year 
ago, you developed almost Messianic visions of a pacified "New 
Middle East," but you made no mention of the fact that you had 
been negotiating with the PLO in Oslo for months... 
  [Peres] ...and what would have become of the secret 
negotiations if I had told people like you about them under seal 
of strictest secrecy? 
  [Menne] Will you tell us instead what you currently have in 
the diplomatic pipeline? 
  [Peres] We are currently negotiating on another peace 
agreement with the Palestinians. Then we will test what can be 
achieved with the Syrians, but we have a dual problem there: 
Not only are the positions of the two parties opposed, but 
above all, we are not in direct negotiation. Everything goes 
via the United States. 
  [Menne] Do you still attach importance to an agreement with 
Syria? 
  [Peres] Yes, because there is no real solution for any 
country in the Middle East before we have achieved an economic 
and political agreement for the whole region. 
  [Menne] The United States continues to play an essential 
role in Middle East diplomacy. Can Russia, for its part, take 
on a role? 
  [Peres] Well, Russia's role is more a symbolic one today: 
The Russians have to ensure that the Middle East is on their 
agenda, but this will not mean for a long time yet that Russia 
is on the agenda of the Middle East. They simply want to 
maintain the image of the great Russia. 
  [Menne] Some questions about the personal side of the 
political development. What was the happiest day of your 
political life? 
  [Peres] The day on which the state of Israel was born. 
  [Menne] What did you feel when you heard about the massacre 
in Hebron? 
  [Peres] I was shaken to the marrow of my bones, I was 
ashamed and shocked. 
  [Menne] And do you fear for the peace process? 
  [Peres] No. 
  [Menne] What was your reaction when Yasir 'Arafat first 
refused to initial the maps of the Jericho territory during the 
signing of the autonomy agreement in Cairo? 
  [Peres] I fancied I was a doctor whose patient had just 
fallen and who had to find the right treatment very quickly. 
  [Menne] How did you feel when you saw the pictures of the 
Palestinian policemen marching into Jericho? 
  [Peres] These were very satisfying pictures for me. I did 
not feel any regret, on the contrary: I hope that the 
Palestinians will quickly develop a successful administration. 
  [Menne] You have worked for Israel all your life. Does it 
hurt that some of your compatriots are now calling you a traitor? 
  [Peres] No, I can live with it. I have only pity for these 
people. 
  [Menne] As defense minister, you dealt primarily with 
military tasks. You are regarded as the "father" of the Israeli 
nuclear reactor in Dimona. Now you are working on a peace 
solution. Has reality changed or have you changed? 
  [Peres] The basic conditions have changed. During the first 
45 years, Israel's security was the main problem. Now it holds 
true that we only find security if we have peace. The "lever of 
deterrence" of Dimona directly influenced the peace agreement 
with Israel. I am still working for the same objectives, only 
the means have changed. In former times, the country needed 
above all weapons, today it needs wisdom. If one wants to 
achieve peace, wars have to be made impossible. 
  [Menne] What can still endanger the peace process now? 
  [Peres] Actually, only something idiotic or unpredictable. 
I believe that the current of history is leading the people 
away from war. Seen from the historical point of view, we have 
come to the end of the hunting season -- what is important 
cannot be hunted any longer and what can still be hunted is no 
longer important. 
  [Menne] That is to say, you think that the peace process is 
irreversible? 
  [Peres] Certainly. The process was not initiated under 
pressure from other countries or by threats of war, but by a 
national process of will, like almost all great achievements of 
the past decade. A communist caused the end of communism, a 
white South African the end of apartheid, a Peronist the end of 
Peronism. And Israel initiated the termination of the Middle 
East conflict. 
  [Menne] What will happen next? 
  [Peres] The next step is the development of the New Middle 
East. In concrete terms, this means for the Israelis and 
Palestinians that the two national footbridges grow together 
into a bridge in the next five years. After the election in the 
autumn, we will negotiate on the extension of the autonomy 
settlement. 
  [Menne] What will become of the Jewish settlers in the 
occupied territories? 
  [Peres] Everything will depend on the relations between 
Palestinians and Israelis. If 500 Jewish settlers live among 
190,000 Arabs in Hebron, this will be no problem if the 
relations are good. However, if they are bad, the situation 
will be unbearable. 
  [Menne] That is to say, the psychological barriers between 
Israelis and Palestinians first have to be reduced? 
  [Peres] Exactly. As it was also possible between Germans 
and French, Germans and Poles. We must not forget that on both 
sides the third or fourth generation has already grown up now 
with completely consolidated hostile images; everyone imputes 
the most devilish intentions to the other from the start. It 
will take some time until both sides understand that they are a 
community of fate. 
  [Menne] Is it not the prerequisite for such a peace process 
that the Palestinians get their own state? 
  [Peres] There is, of course, a completely legitimate 
national consciousness, which also needs a political form of 
expression. And the autonomy settlement grants them everything 
that makes up a state, except for defense and foreign politics. 
However, there will be all symbols of independence, from 
passports to stamps. Over the long term, I prefer the model of 
a confederation -- politically between Jordanians and 
Palestinians, economically between Israelis, Jordanians, and 
Palestinians, which can be approximately compared to the Benelux 
structure. In the near future, however, we still have to be 
very careful with Israel's security interests. 
  [Menne] How is the New Middle East supposed to look in 
concrete terms? 
  [Peres] Like the European Community. Borders would only be 
defined in demographic and cultural terms, but they would not be 
permitted to impede the movements of people, ideas, and goods. 
What television can do must also be possible for streets, 
railroads, and aircraft. The most important objective must be 
the general raising of the standard of living because if someone 
has a low income and a television set, he will compare his 
situation with that of a European and feel envy, bitterness, and 
rage; in this way, fundamentalist movements are created. 
  [Menne] Will the economy play a greater role than politics 
in the creation of the New Middle East? 
  [Peres] We should introduce economics in politics, instead 
of politicizing economies. Many Arabs still see their economy 
in an old-fashioned way as a national economy, which, however, 
no longer exists because markets are more important than nations 
and because one cannot place flags on one's children's breakfast 
table. "Cannons instead of socks, tanks instead of shoes," it 
was said in Israel in the fifties, today I hear more and more 
frequently: "Better a bank than a tank." We have to create a 
regional community with a common market. 
  [Menne] And who is supposed to pay for it? 
  [Peres] For one thing, this does not cost a penny, we would 
only have to restrict some crazy expenses. In the last decade, 
the Middle East spent billions of dollars on arms, the Syrian 
armament budget devours almost half of the GDP, in Israel it is 
only 26 percent. These are enormous sums, of which a reasonable 
part might flow into economic development. Only very rich 
countries can afford expensive armies and costly dictatorships. 
  [Menne] What can Israel offer to its neighbors? 
  [Peres] Above all technology and science. Only think of the 
rapid spreading of the desert in the Middle East -- we have very 
precise experiences with techniques that can check and force 
back this desertification of the region. Our neighbors can 
immediately benefit from it. 
  [Menne] And what can the Arab countries offer to Israel? 
  [Peres] We can economically survive without our neighbors; 
our exports are well developed. But politically it is very 
problematic for Israel to exist as an island of affluence in a 
sea of poverty. Therefore, the Arabs can give the most important 
thing to us: peace.

  [Excerpts] Paris, May 19 (AFP) -- Israeli Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres announced here Thursday [19 May] that talks would 
soon be held on transferring power in five key areas to 
Palestinian authorities throughout the West Bank. 
  Speaking after a meeting with President Francois Mitterrand, 
Peres said he believed that, in the near future, Israeli and 
Palestinian leaders would discuss "the transfer of power in 
certain sectors into the hands of Palestinian authorities on the 
West Bank." 
  Peres, who arrived in the French capital Thursday for a 
24-hour visit after talks in Oslo with Palestine Liberation 
Organisation leader Yasir 'Arafat, cited health, education, 
tourism, and fiscal and social matters as the sectors in 
question. 
  The Israeli army, which finished its withdrawal overnight 
Tuesday from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho, 
still occupies some West Bank regions. 
  The first part of bilateral negotiations had been concluded 
successfully, Peres said. 
  The Israelis "have left Gaza and Jericho and this is the 
first time that the Palestinian people have made real, 
territorial gains," he added. 
  Questioned on 'Arafat's recent call for a Moslem holy war -- 
or jihad -- to liberate Jerusalem, Peres said that he hoped the 
comment did not presage a return to PLO militancy. 
  "The past cannot be changed but I hope that it will not be 
repeated in the future," Peres said. 
  "'Arafat made a mistake that he has tried to correct, but 
despite this the negotiations must continue." [passage omitted] 
  Peres and 'Arafat announced earlier Thursday after meeting 
in 
Oslo that they had agreed on an agenda for the next round of 
talks on the West Bank territories. 
  Those talks would probably take place in Cairo, Peres said, 
adding that further negotiations about the extension of 
Palestinian autonomy would be held in Washington at a date to be 
arranged.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Bhupal Inder Saini] </F>
  [Text] The positive ambience created by Mr. Narasimha Rao's 
first meeting with President Clinton should go a long way in 
launching India and the United States on a new partnership of 
peace and development. Expectedly, the focus of the White House 
talks was on India's economic reforms and the opportunities they 
offer for strengthening Indo-American economic ties. There are 
differences, no doubt, in the two countries' approach to issues 
like nuclear nonproliferation, missile technology control and 
human rights. But as President Clinton himself put it, they 
have to be viewed in the totality of circumstances. Being 
friends does not mean one must see eye to eye on every matter. 
  A major gain of the summit meeting was the resolve by the 
two 
countries to continue discussion on issues of which India and 
the United States hold different views. As the prime minister 
put it while talking to the Indian and ethnic media personnel, 
the only way to resolve differences is to talk to and understand 
each other. So far as Indo-U.S. relations are concerned, this 
dialogue has not been as emphatic as it promises to be now. 
  Significantly, President Clinton acknowledged that with the 
economic reforms now under way, India is destined to emerge as 
one of the biggest free markets of the world. Both he and Mr. 
Narasimha Rao recognized that with the expansion of its economy, 
India would be able to contribute more meaningfully to the 
shaping of the world, both politically and economically. 
  Another positive outcome of last night's talks in Washington 
is the decision to have regular consultations at the Foreign 
Office level. Such continuous dialogue will help the two 
countries to identify and remove the irritants and 
misunderstandings hindering a closer relationship. 
  The United States' recognition that India is poised to play 
a 
more significant role in world affairs is likely to put the 
relations between the two countries on a sound and realistic 
footing. It is also an acknowledgment by the only superpower in 
the world today that India as a potential major economic power 
cannot be wished away.

  [Excerpts] The unifying Friday prayers were held throughout 
the country simultaneously today. In Tehran, the prayers were 
led by Hojjat ol-Eslam val Moslemin Hashemi-Rafsanjani. [passage 
omitted] 
  In his second sermon, the president of the Islamic Republic 
of Iran pointed to the restrictions placed by the Saudi 
government on the holding of the disavowal of infidels ceremony. 
He said: The Saudis could have acted more sensibly and not 
caused differences between the two important countries of the 
region. Today, Islamic unity is a principle as important for us 
as the disavowal of infidels principle. He added: Considering 
the crisis points in various parts of the world, and with the 
wise leadership of the honorable leader of the Islamic 
revolution [Khamene'i], another crisis was averted over this 
matter. 
  The president advised the Saudis to think harder and to take 
on more correct methods in future years. He said: We hope that 
in the future, a program on the hajj acceptable to both 
countries will be formulated which will take into account the 
views of both sides. [passage omitted]

  [Text] A Foreign Office spokesman said that there has been 
no change in Pakistan's principled policy on the nuclear issue. 
Clarifying a statement by Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad 
Ali, the spokesman said that the press has attributed an 
incorrect statement to him. The foreign minister said that the 
United States proposed that if Pakistan agreed on a verifiable 
restriction [bandish] on its nuclear program, then there will be 
a one time exemption from the Pressler Amendment. 
  The foreign minister categorically reaffirmed the Pakistani 
stand that Pakistan was ready to consider all proposals on 
declaring South Asia a nuclear-free zone provided these 
proposals were just and nondiscriminatory. The spokesman said 
that the nuclear issue is an extremely sensitive one and a 
national consensus on it is very essential. He expressed the 
hope that the press will keep national interests in view and 
refrain from out of context presentations of statements on this 
most important issue.

    [Editorial report] The following review of the 10 May issue 
of Cairo 'AQIDATI summarizes articles that are Islamic in nature. 
<H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>
  1. Al-Azhar and Ulema Support Organizing Religious Rulings 
  2. Ulema and Preachers Conference Convenes After 'Id 
  3. Al-Mansurah University Organizes Course for Prayer

  8. Writer Slams Western Indifference to Bosnian Tragedy 
<H5>  AL-AZHAR AND ULEMA SUPPORT ORGANIZING RELIGIOUS RULINGS </H5>
  A 2,000-word report on pages 1 and 10 by Musa Hal and Tariq 
'Abdallah notes that the Islamic ulema and al-Azhar Mosque have 
expressed their support for a call outlined in 'AQIDATI's board 
chairman Samir Rajab's column "Rightfully, I say" published in 
the 3 May issue to enact a law unifying fatwas [religious 
rulings]. The report says that the ulema stressed that passing 
religious rulings is a "serious task" that must not be left to 
irresponsible and unqualified people. The ulema say that 
al-Azhar Mosque and the Islamic Research Council are the only 
parties qualified to pass religious rulings so that the Muslims 
may unify their stance and eliminate their differences. The 
report cites named ulemas' views on the issue. 
<H5>  ULEMA AND PREACHERS CONFERENCE CONVENES AFTER 'ID </H5>
  A 150-word unattributed report on page 2 notes that the 
second general conference of ulemas and mosque preachers will 
convene under Awqaf Minister Muhammad Mahjub after 'Id al-Adha. 
The three-day conference will discuss numerous important issues 
affecting the Islamic and Arab nations through research papers 
prepared by senior ulemas. It will also discuss the tasks of 
preachers during the current stage. 
<H5>  AL-MANSURAH UNIVERSITY ORGANIZES COURSE FOR PRAYER LEADERS </H5>
  A 1,200-word report by Khalid al-Kilani on page 3 states 
that 
after a request from the Awqaf Ministry, al-Mansurah University 
has arranged an advanced course for prayer leaders and preachers 
in al-Daqahliyah Governorate to qualify them for the job. A 
named prayer leader said that the course opened the 
participants' minds to new horizons and linked them to their 
"political and legal society." They learned how economic 
wars--which affect the Islamic world, particularly Egypt--are 
launched. The head of the Legal Studies and Consultations 
Center, Dr. Muhsin al-Bih, said these courses will broaden the 
role of universities in serving society. He notes that the 
center drafted a program outlining the "state's general policy" 
in all fields so that the prayer leaders will benefit from their 
activities. 
<H5>  WRITER PRAISES BANNING SATELLITE DISHES IN GOVERNORATES </H5>
  In a 700-word column "With All Frankness" on page 6, Basyuni 
al-Halawani praises the Dumyat and al-Daqahliyah governors' 
decision to ban the use of satellite dishes in cafes and clubs 
to protect ethics and prevent perversion. He says that 
satellite programs carry dissolute films representing foreign 
values and behavior into our Islamic society. He says this 
deluge of films is designed to extricate what has remained of 
our Islamic roots, values, and traditions. He notes that 
several Arab and Islamic countries have made "courageous 
decisions" banning the use of satellite dishes. 
<H5>  WRITER VIEWS BOOK ON ISLAMIC RESISTANCE TO WEST'S DOMINATION </H5>
  In his 800-word "Islamic Views" column entitled "The Western 
Challenge to the Islamic World" on page 7, Islamic Writer Dr. 
Muhammad 'Imarah discusses a book by Jewish writer Martin 
Kramer, who reviews Muslim ways of resisting the Western 
invasion of the Islamic world. He notes that Kramer lists all 
the conferences that the Muslim leaders have held on this 
subject, stressing that they have all failed. Kramer concludes 
by saying that the Muslims never agree on anything. 'Imarah 
admits that Kramer is right that the Muslims have consistently 
differed in all their conferences, but he notes that this is 
only half the truth because he fails to say why they differed. 
'Imarah asks if the Muslims differ because they believe in 
Islam. 
<H5>  WRITER CRITICIZES FOREIGN-FUNDED RESEARCH </H5>
  In a 650-word column, Majdi Salim reviews development of the 
colonialists' attempts to dominate other countries. He notes 
that the colonialists now have "local ideological and cultural 
agents." He says that the West's attempts to dominate the 
Islamic countries have local advocates. Under the claims of 
"freedom and civilization," they introduce the West's defects. 
The "most dangerous" thing they are doing is their public 
activities and research on social, economic, and cultural 
aspects of Egyptian society funded by foreigners. This research 
must be checked, he concludes. 
<H5>  WORLD ISLAMIC COUNCIL APPEALS TO YEMENIS TO STOP BLOODSHED </H5>
  A 150-word report by Jamal Salim on page 20 notes that the 
World Islamic Council for Relief and Call has issued a statement 
appealing to the Yemeni parties to exercise self-restraint and 
immediately stop "the bloodshed of Muslims." The report notes 
that the council appealed to the Arab and Islamic heads of state 
to act promptly to contain the crisis and initiate a fraternal 
dialogue between the two parties. The statement "condemns the 
enemies of Yemeni unity who instigated the sedition." 
<H5>  WRITER SLAMS WESTERN INDIFFERENCE TO BOSNIAN TRAGEDY </H5>
  A 300-word column by 'Adil Dayf on page 21 notes President 
Clinton's defense of U.S. vacillation on dealing with the crisis 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the West's inaction. He says that 
this reflects the magnitude of the tragedy of the Muslims in 
Bosnia and Western "plotting and indifference." He says that 
the new world order is "plotting" against the Muslims and is 
"rewarding" the Serbs for their crimes against Muslims.

    [Editorial report] The following review of the 13 May issue 
of Cairo AL-SHA'B summarizes articles that are Islamic in nature. 
<H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>
  1. Anger Over Lawyer's Death 
  2. Eyewitness Account of Detention, Torture 
  3. Islamic Writer Banned From AL-AHRAM 
  4. Sudanese Minister Interviewed 
  5. A Muslim Brotherhood Version of Pluralism 
<H5>  ANGER OVER LAWYER'S DEATH </H5>
  Expressions of anger by the Bar Association and other 
quarters over the death of lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani while in 
police custody is featured in more than one article. A 
front-page banner headline reads "Madani's Death Marks a Climax 
in Government Terror." A 300-word front-page report by Ashraf 
Khalil and Khali Yunus describe a gathering at the Bar 
Association on 12 May and a planned demonstration on 17 May. 
The report notes that: "The Arab Bar Association issued a 
statement denouncing the crime and stressing its full solidarity 
with the colleagues at the Egyptian Bar Association." 
  A 600-word letter by the New York-based human rights group 
Middle East Watch to President Mubarak appears on pages 1 and 7. 
The letter calls on President Mubarak "to take immediate action 
to reveal the cause of death of 'Abd-al-Harith Madani and ensure 
that those responsible for the incident will receive the 
harshest punishment under the law." 
  A 3,000-word report by 'Amir 'Abd-al-Mun'im, Ashraf Khalil, 
Khalid Yunus, and Tariq 'Abd-al-Hamid on page 3 describes a 
rally held at the Bar Association in Cairo on 10 May to denounce 
Madani's death. Various prominent lawyers, including a member 
of the People's Assembly, Kamal Khalid, speak on the occasion, 
denouncing "police brutality" and "human rights abuses." 
  Labor Party Secretary General 'Adil Husayn, in a 
wide-ranging 
5,000-word commentary on page 5, finds an epic dimension in the 
lawyers' anger: "Let the upcoming strike by the lawyers be a 
roaring expression of our pent-up anger. Let all other sections 
of society come to the lawyers' support. Heads of professional 
associations and of parties should march with the lawyers in 
protest. 
  "Yes, we have to answer a challenge with a challenge. They 
[the government] wanted to intimidate us, but we, God willing, 
will turn this into an epic that will lead us to restore human 
rights in this country." 
<H5>  EYEWITNESS ACCOUNT OF DETENTION, TORTURE </H5>
  An unattributed 350-word report on page 3 cites a former 
detainee recounting his experience while in police custody. The 
former detainee, Midhat Khalil Jalal, was also "the last witness 
who saw martyr 'Abd-al-Harith Madani before his death." 
  Jalal says that he was arrested on 26 April 1994 on charges 
of distributing leaflets "warning of sectarian strife" in the 
al-Haram neighborhood of Cairo. He adds: "Two days later, I was 
taken to the State Security Intelligence building on Jabir 
Ibn-Hayyan Street. There, I was blindfolded. An officer came 
into the room who asked me a lot of such questions as: What 
group do you belong to? What books do you read? What mosques 
do you go to? When he did not like my answers he gave me a good 
beating, shouting insults I had never heard before. He also 
said that detention would do me good." 
  Jalal then says that he was taken to an overcrowded cell, 
where on the night of 26 April [contradiction with the dates 
mentioned above is as published] he met lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith 
Madani. He says that Madani "stayed with us in the cell for one 
hour. We asked him why he was arrested and he said: I do not 
know. He was self-composed. An hour later he was taken away. 
We did not see him any more. Later I heard news of his death 
on radio London [the BBC]." 
  Describing torture in the "terror cell," Jalal says: "Every 
time the cell's door opened, we would die of fear, particularly 
at 1200 and 2300, the times of the `torture shifts' when some of 
us would be led away after being blindfolded to a room on top of 
the cell. The detainee would be suspended at the door and a 
bout of terrible torture would begin, including electric shock 
and whipping. When the victim fell silent we would know that he 
had fainted. He would return in a terrible state, not even able 
to drink water. 
  "I helped one of the detainees drink water because his hand 
`was too stiff' from frequent `hanging' at the door. The bodies 
of the victims were full of bruises and cuts. I was released on 
Friday, 29 April, but before that one of the officers told me 
that if I was ever seen again in the mosque to which I go, I 
would be thrown into jail for life." 

<H5>    ISLAMIC WRITER BANNED FROM AL-AHRAM </H5>
  As part of his lengthy and versatile page-5 commentary, 
'Adil 
Husayn denounces the banning of Islamic writer Fahmi Huwaydi 
from the semi-official newspaper AL-AHRAM. He writes: 
  "Who decided to ban the distinguished writer Fahmi Huwaydi 
from writing in AL-AHRAM? Fahmi Huwaydi is an internationally 
acclaimed writer and to prevent him from writing is to deal a 
savage blow to the country's modest scope of free expression. 
  "The ban was preceded and accompanied by a campaign in pro- 
government newspapers attacking everything Huwaydi writes. The 
campaign targeted not only Huwaydi but anyone writing about 
Islam without exception. The campaign did not spare al-Azhar 
ulema and the worst insults were leveled at the Awqaf minister 
himself." 
  Having thoroughly denounced what he sees as a 
government-blessed press campaign against Islamists, Husayn sees 
the campaign from an international perspective: "Some may 
imagine that questioning and attacking Islam is a form of free 
expression. But what we are faced with today is much more 
serious than a view expressed in a number of articles or books. 
We are facing a premeditated and unabashed onslaught by the 
forces of international arrogance, including Zionism, against 
the Muslim people. What is being published in Egypt is a mere 
translation of what is being written abroad. Hundreds of 
millions of dollars are being spent to finance such writings. 
We are not facing just a number of deviant individuals but a 
diabolical foreign scheme that some of our writers, knowingly or 
unknowingly, are colluding with." 
<H5>  SUDANESE MINISTER INTERVIEWED </H5>
  A 2,500-word report on an interview with 'Ali 'Uthman Taha, 
Sudanese Minister of Social Planning, by Qutb al-'Arabi in 
Khartoum appears on page 8. The date of the interview is not 
given. 
  Early in his report, al-'Arabi informs us that the Social 
Planning Ministry is "a ministry created to carry out the task 
of social changes based on an Islamic foundation." 
  The Sudanese minister is cited as saying that the "stability 
of the domestic regime is no longer in question," that 
"opposition at home and abroad is weakening," and that "military 
resistance" is waning. 
  The minister argues that the Islamic regime is gaining 
popularity and elaborates on several steps that the government 
is pondering to fortify the Islamic character of the state. "As 
for popular response to the Islamic propositions of the 
Salvation Government, Minister Taha said: The popular movement 
response to Islamic slogans outstripped the actual political 
reach. The political regime is still taking gradual steps but 
various sectors of society, including the general public, social 
organizations, tribes, intellectuals, and popular figures, are 
all joining the Islamic trend with a zest hard to accommodate 
within the framework of the national conference or popular 
committees. The response is massive, the prospect promising, 
and the urge strong." 
  As examples of government efforts to encourage piety, the 
minister mentions that the cabinet is examining proposals to 
start the working day with the dawn prayer and to train 
professionals, such as doctors and engineers, to spread the word 
of Islam within their professions. 

<H5>    A MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD VERSION OF PLURALISM </H5>
  A 2,000-word essay entitled "Muslim Brotherhood: A Brief 
Word on Consultation [shura] in Islam" and signed "the Muslim 
Brothers" appears on page 13. In a language that is part 
theology and part modern political jargon, the essay provides 
the group's view of government. It fails to point out whether 
this view is a recapitulation or a revision of the group's 
position and does not clarify whether it is part of any 
political initiative. 
  The essay opens with a Koranic verse often cited to indicate 
the democratic nature of Islam: "Those who hearken to their 
Lord, and establish regular prayer; who conduct their affairs by 
mutual consultation; who spend out of what we bestow on them for 
sustenance." This verse, the essay tells us, means that "the 
people are the source of powers." 
  The essay then briefs us on the lives of the early Caliphs, 
who, it argues, came to power through "selection by the general 
Muslim public." Since then, the Muslim people have had many 
rulers, some good and many bad, but "never has the Islamic 
shari'ah been abandoned, neither as a faith, nor a reference nor 
a constitution." 
  Islamic rule, good or bad, only ended with the crusades: 
"Never has a ruler or an Islamic people adopted a reference 
other than shari'ah until the Islamic people were visited by the 
imperialism of the crusaders. The crusaders invaded them, ruled 
them, and imposed their laws and principles on them. A 
procession of agents, following on the footsteps of the 
crusaders, then came to power." 
  From this, the essay concludes that Muslim rulers should be 
selected by the people from among the capable and devout: "The 
people have the right to select, with their good judgment, those 
whose piety, probity, knowledge, and efficiency are commensurate 
to the tasks of office." 
  Also, the state needs to have a constitution based on the 
Koran. "We believe--although the Koran and the teachings of the 
prophet are the supreme constitution of Muslims and that whoever 
or whatever challenges them is wrong--that the nation should 
have a written constitution. The nation should formulate and 
agree upon that constitution, which should be inspired by the 
texts of the lofty shari'ah." 
  The essay proposes that a parliament is needed to implement 
the constitution. The constitution, it says, should "contain 
enough principles and guarantees to protect public and private 
freedoms of all people--Muslims and non-Muslims alike--and make 
the government a consultation affair [shura] based on the power 
of the people. The constitution should define the rulers' 
responsibility before the people. It should state a way of 
questioning and correcting the rulers peaceably and successfully 
if they go wrong and change them if needs be. This requires the 
presence of a representative council with effective legislative 
and control powers, a council embodying the true will of the 
people as expressed through fair and free elections. The 
resolutions of such a council should be binding." 
  Having expounded its view on the constitution and the 
parliament, the Brotherhood's essay proposes limited-term 
presidency: "We are also of the opinion that--considering that 
the president of the state is just an elected official--the 
presidency must be for a limited term and must not be renewed 
except for a limited period to avoid despotism." 
  After giving a mix of theological and common-sense 
arguments, 
the essay recommends a pluralism that resides within the 
confines of shari'ah: "We, therefore, believe in the plurality 
of parties in Islamic society and that the authority need not 
place restrictions on the formation and activity of political 
groups or parties. Every group should be left free to advocate 
its views and expose its method... [ellipsis as published] So 
long as Islamic shari'ah is the ultimate constitution and the 
law is applied by an independent and protected judiciary, away 
from the influence of any authority or side, and so long as the 
judiciary is intellectually, scientifically, and theologically 
capable, this should be sufficient to guarantee the probity of 
society and its commitment to the right path." 
  The essay concludes: "We also see that the acceptance of the 
multi-party system in the Islamic society, in the way that we 
just stated, involves the acceptance of the fact that power may 
change hands among political groups and parties through periodic 
elections. May God be blessed first and foremost. God's prayers 
be upon Prophet Muhammad and his scions and disciples."

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Ahmad al-Tibi, adviser to PLO </F>
Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, by Mikha'el Tuchfeld; place not given -- 
live] 
  [Text] [Tuchfeld] Today we heard additional comments made 
by 'Arafat in Johannesburg, this time referring to an agreement 
Muhammad made with the Quiraish Tribe and later violated. Does 
this mean that Islam permits people to sign agreements and then, 
when the circumstances change, to violate them? 
  [Al-Tibi] What you are saying now and what you have been 
broadcasting since noon today is totally despicable. You 
interviewed a self-appointed expert with a political bias, a 
pseudo-orientalist who has distorted both Islam and the facts, 
claiming that Muhammad was the one who violated the agreement 
with the Quiraish Tribe. 
  I accompanied 'Arafat to Johannesburg. Upon entering the 
mosque, he was immediately surrounded by radical fundamentalists 
who charged that he had signed an agreement with Israel while 
the latter violated it daily by murdering Palestinians, 
confiscating land, etc. In this mosque, 'Arafat said -- and you 
broadcast his remarks -- that if one side violates the 
agreement, the other side can violate it, as happened in the 
agreement between Muhammad and the Quiraish. Now, what was this 
agreement between Muhammad and the Quiraish, which was distorted 
by that self-appointed orientalist, Moshe Sharon? 
  [Tuchfeld] A nonbelligerency agreement. 
  [Al-Tibi] The agreement was called Hudaybah Sulh 
[reconciliation]. In this agreement, which dictated tough terms 
to Muhammad, the latter undertook to forgo the pilgrimage to 
Mecca. He accepted this dictate, and he also agreed not to 
accept any Quiraish member who wanted to become a Muslim and to 
send him away. An important clause in the agreement stated that 
if one side harms a member of the other side, the agreement is 
thereby annulled. This clause, incidentally, was inserted at 
the Quiraish's request. After two years, the Quiraish Tribe 
massacred the followers of the Prophet Muhammad, thereby 
violating the agreement. It was the Quiraish Tribe that 
violated the agreement, as every elementary school student 
knows. Now you come here and do something totally 
unacceptable.... 
  [Tuchfeld, interrupting] It is not unacceptable, because 
Yasir 'Arafat's comments require clarification, and Professor 
Moshe Sharon is a renowned orientalist. Now, returning to 
'Arafat's call for jihad, he later explained it as a religious 
jihad for peace. Not only Moshe Sharon, however, but other 
orientalists claim that there is no such thing in Islam. 
  [Al-Tibi] I will not let this go unanswered. I agree with 
you that 'Arafat referred to the agreement between Muhammad and 
the Quiraish, but you were accomplices to an act of distortion. 
Since noon today, you have been broadcasting that Yasir 'Arafat 
meant.... 
  [Tuchfeld, interrupting] Now we are giving you the 
opportunity to clarify what he said, so why do you not use the 
short time you have to explain things? 
  [Al-Tibi] Mikha'el, 'Arafat's comments should not have been 
elucidated by a right-wing orientalist whom you pulled straight 
out of a Gush Emunim conference. I can sympathize with your 
sensitivity to the word jihad, because it has a militant 
connotation for Jews, seeing that Arabs have always used it in 
this sense. Yasir 'Arafat explained what he meant, but many 
Israelis did not accept his explanation, while some did. 
Someone is now trying to make unjustifiable use of this second 
version of the tape. Incidentally, tapes are a special Israeli 
political genre which I think we should not exploit in reference 
to agreements between two nations.... 
  [Tuchfeld, interrupting] Dr. al-Tibi, this is why we are 
giving you the opportunity to explain 'Arafat's remarks, and 
what you are claiming is that when one side violates an 
agreement, the other side is entitled to launch a jihad. 
  [Al-Tibi] Absolutely not. Nobody said this, and now you are 
again distorting what was said. Yitzhaq Rabin and Shim'on Peres 
themselves said that if Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] 
comes to power after the elections, the agreement is null and 
void. Now, if somebody thinks of violating an agreement as a 
result of political elections, what should be the fate of the 
agreement in the case of an IDF [Israel Defense Forces] massacre 
of Palestinians or a Palestinian massacre of Israelis? I think 
in that case the agreement will be totally worthless. We are 
dealing here with an agreement that must be honored. Yasir 
'Arafat signed this agreement. Perhaps criticism regarding the 
insensitive use of the jihad concept was justified, but this is 
not the case concerning the new version and this theater of the 
absurd which you are all participating in.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Rabin Bent on Escalation"] </F>
  [Text] Some Israeli circles insist on fabricating a crisis 
over the Palestinian president's statements despite the calm 
positive clarification he made. 
  As the saying goes, "anyone who thinks that a leopard can 
change his spots is mistaken." Anyone who imagines that Israeli 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin would willingly agree to a 
comprehensive peace without receiving the price in the form of 
applause by the Israeli political hawks, is mistaken. 
  Rabin yesterday again sought escalation despite Yasir 
'Arafat's clarification of what he meant by the call for jihad 
for Jerusalem. Rabin refused to tone down the false fury, 
perhaps because he wanted to make the maximum gain of cheap 
popularity in the hawks camp which is basically opposed to any 
just peace. 
  There is no need to recall that Rabin's past positions on 
such issues as security and the intifadah were closer to the 
Likud's position than they were to several of his colleagues in 
the cabinet he now heads, but it is necessary and proper to say 
a few frank words on the matter. 
  The Palestinian president may have underestimated the 
dimensions of the deliberate "political interpretation" of the 
word jihad in the Western media but he has on all occasions 
demonstrated full practical commitment to the agreements he 
signed. 
  Furthermore, the place where the statement causing the 
crisis 
was made was not a place in an area of charged religious 
sentiments, to warrant its interpretation as an instigative 
statement. 
  The parties really interested in defending the peace 
process, 
be they Arab, American, or Israeli, have refused to dwell on 
that fabricated issue, preferring instead to enhance the process 
by reaffirming the principle of withdrawal, guarantee of 
security, and clear understanding on future steps toward a just 
and comprehensive peace. 
  These parties with positive intentions are aware of the 
danger of playing with fire for "local consumption" particularly 
at a time of major blessed Islamic occasions. It would be 
better for those trying to eschew the phased withdrawal process 
and the move toward full withdrawal to abandon their dangerous 
adventure because the alternative would be a return to the 
bloody option which would spare nobody.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Jihad Duty Binding on All"] </F>
  [Text] The Israeli leadership might be able to alter 
Palestine's geographical boundaries and introduce amendments to 
its demographic map by absorbing large numbers of emigrants. 
But this leadership -- no matter how powerful materially -- 
cannot change the Palestinian people's beliefs, the foundations 
of their faith, and their absolute belief in their legitimate 
rights. 
  We are reemphasizing these constants because of the clamor 
provoked by the Yitzhaq Rabin government over a speech 
Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat delivered during a meeting 
with South African Muslims in a Johannesburg mosque. In the 
speech he demanded the Muslims' jihad for the sake of liberating 
Jerusalem and restoring it as a capital for the Islamic nation 
as a whole. 
  Maybe the Palestinian president was forced -- under Israeli 
and U.S. pressures -- to offer clarifications which include 
justifications, not backtrackings. But what applies to him as a 
politician engaging in a difficult and complicated peace process 
whose balances are not equal does not necessarily apply to the 
Palestinian Arab people's sons, who are actually exercising 
jihad in the occupied territories daily. 
  When they confront settlers in Hebron and take revenge for 
their victims within hours in heroic fedayeen operations, it is 
the highest kind of jihad. When they cling to the land, refuse 
to bargain over it, and prefer to stay in detention centers 
rather than pledge to abandon their right to resist, it means 
that numerous troubles are ahead of Israel if it insists on its 
repressive policies, refuses to withdraw from the occupied Arab 
territories, and continues its settlement policies. 
  The jihad remains a duty for every Arab and Muslim as long 
as 
the holy land is occupied and as long as al-Aqsa Mosque is 
shackled. And if the United States succeeded in omitting the 
"jihad" from the resolutions adopted by the Dakar Islamic 
summit, it will not succeed in imposing this ban on the peoples 
after the rulers. 
  So the Israeli clamor in question reveals the Rabin 
government's bad intentions with regard to Jerusalem and its 
future -- the fundamental issue which has been deferred to the 
negotiations of the final phase, which are supposed to begin in 
three years at the latest. 
  The Palestinian president was right when he appealed to all 
Muslims throughout the world to perform their duty to liberate 
Jerusalem. 
  Suffice it to say that this people have continued the jihad 
for 70 years to safeguard the Arab Islamic identity of this old 
city. They fiercely resisted all temptations to emigration and 
naturalization and as a result they have lost thousands of 
martyrs. 
  All the propaganda festivals held for Jerusalem here and 
there do not have a fraction of the effect caused by an Iraqi 
missile fired on Israel. Jerusalem does not need prayers and 
speeches, but, rather, actions and sacrifices. 
  It is shameful and suspicious at the same time for us not to 
hear a single call for jihad for the sake of Jerusalem. And if 
this call is announced, it tends to emanate from a besieged, 
suffocated, starved state. As for the Arab and Islamic states 
that are overstuffed with money, missiles, aircraft, and all 
types of weapons, they pretend to forget Jerusalem and the 
people of Jerusalem. They do not want to do anything about it. 
And if they do, their actions are not in the Palestinian 
people's interests and do not help to recover their rights in 
the framework of the simplest possible forms of sympathy and 
solidarity.

  [Text] The Palestinian police force is not in control of 
the situation in the Gaza Strip and has even ceased trying to 
handle traffic. Our correspondent Nisim Qeynan has learned from 
Arab sources that armed and unmasked Hamas [Islamic Resistance 
Movement] members have been roaming around the Gaza Strip 
undisturbed since yesterday. 
  Nabil Sha'th, head of the PLO delegation, arrived in the 
strip from Egypt last night for a 24-hour visit. He is holding 
talks with Palestinian police commanders and others on the 
functioning of the police force in the autonomy, as well as on 
different matters.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Colonel Haj Isma'il, commander of </F>
the Palestinian police forces in Jericho, in Jericho, by Ramadan 
Husayn, in Cairo; date not given; from the "Dialogue From Afar" 
program -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Husayn] What are the Palestinian police's tasks 
in Jericho in general, particularly today on 'Id al-Adha? 
  [Isma'il] [passage omitted] As for the civilian tasks of the 
police, since they arrived, the police assumed their duties in a 
normal way in the area. In Jericho, they assumed their full 
duties to ensure security and safety and maintain order. Things 
here are proceeding normally and the police are running the 
affairs according to their program. 
  [Husayn] You are aware that many settlers reside in the 
Jericho area and will be subject to Palestinian police 
protection. Do you think they might cause any trouble for the 
Palestinian police forces? 
  [Isma'il] Since the beginning we have been working hard to 
avoid trouble with the settlers and with religious people in 
particular. As you know, they have a small synagogue here in 
Jericho, and agreements stipulate that religious people can 
visit the synagogue once a week or at any time they like on the 
condition that they be unarmed. They still enter the synagogue 
with their arms and refuse to abide by the agreement, causing 
trouble and problems for us; and they pass through the city, 
too. We are trying hard to overcome the problems with the 
Israeli side through the liaison committee. We are still 
suffering from this problem because the religious settlers are 
persisting in these acts in a provocative way. 
  [Husayn] Regarding Palestinian people visiting Jerusalem, 
Israel imposes a special system according to which advance 
permits must be obtained. Does this apply to the Jericho 
residents, or has the situation changed? 
  [Isma'il] The Israeli stand on Jericho residents visiting 
Jerusalem has not changed; we have a problem here. We discussed 
the matter with the Israeli side but the Israeli stance has not 
changed. They insist that any one wanting to visit Jerusalem 
must have a permit, but we told them that Jerusalem is part of 
the Palestinian land. We will visit Jerusalem soon, God 
willing, and we are working hard to lift the blockade and 
rescind the Israelis' measures concerning Jerusalem. 
  [Husayn] Another question, regarding preparations to receive 
President Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] in Jericho, the 
headquarters of the transitional self-rule authority. 
  [Isma'il] Here in Jericho we are anxiously waiting for his 
arrival. All our people in the West bank and Gaza Strip (?look 
forward) to President Yasir 'Arafat's arrival. We are preparing 
for his arrival but the date is left for the president to decide 
on. [passage omitted] 
  [Husayn] Concerning the supervision of traffic to and from 
Jericho over the Allenby Bridge and the crossing between Jericho 
and Gaza Strip, what is the position of the Palestinian police 
forces? 
  [Isma'il] The Israeli side is preparing the necessary 
installations for the three crossings, in accordance with the 
agreement, and will soon complete building the terminals. After 
that we will begin to implement all the measures concerning 
traffic at the crossings according to the provisions of the 
agreement. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Jibril al-Rujub, official in charge of </F>
Preventive Security in the West Bank, by correspondent Basim 
Abu-Sumayyah; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Abu-Sumayyah] Mr. Jibril 
al-Rujub, there is another challenge. This is the Israeli 
presence, specifically the presence of settlements on 
Palestinian soil. This constitutes a constant factor for 
friction. How will you address this issue? 
  [Al-Rujub] I spoke about intrinsic challenges. But 
concerning objective challenges, there is certainly the issue of 
settlements and settlers. I believe that there can be no 
stability, security, tranquility, and the Palestinian national 
authority will not be able to impose its national presence in an 
ethical manner so long as there are settlers and settlements. 
There is a challenge of another type, that of Jerusalem, the 
question of East Jerusalem should be settled in a manner that 
fulfills the minimum level of our aspirations. By this, I mean 
the withdrawal from East Jerusalem. 
  [Abu-Sumayyah] Mr. Jibril, since we are speaking about 
Jerusalem, is there actually a secret Israeli commitment to 
President 'Arafat on the future of Jerusalem? 
  [Al-Rujub] I do not know. What I know is that there is a 
U.S. pledge to continue tackling East Jerusalem as occupied. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Abu-Sumayyah] How do you assess the implementation of the 
agreement on the ground over the past period? 
  [Al-Rujub] From the Palestinian side, I believe there are 
some difficulties. However, we should overcome them. We in the 
PLO are not a major power. We work within our limited 
resources. In spite of this, we managed to transport our 
forces. We managed to take over the duties of the police force 
and to impose a minimum of political respect. I view this as an 
achievement when compared with the means we have. We must not 
forget the economic siege the PLO has been experiencing since 
the Gulf war. [passage omitted] 
  [Abu-Sumayyah] Are there negotiations for releasing more 
Palestinian detainees, is there a timetable for this, or what 
about the question of the detainees in general? 
  [Al-Rujub] With respect to the detainees, there is a 
two-point agreement. The first point is to release 5,000 
prisoner during a record time, and a committee will be formed 
from the two sides to discuss the vehicle for releasing the 
rest. The upshot of this means that all the prisoners and 
detainees will be released without any consideration to their 
affiliation, and the reasons for which they were arrested. This 
is because we in the PLO look at ourselves as negotiators and 
speakers on behalf of the entire Palestinian people with all 
their political and social sectors. From this premise, we 
signed the agreement in the name of all the Palestinian people. 
That's why we consider that we are responsible for releasing 
all who have resisted occupation, and those who have exercised 
their natural right in confronting an illegal occupation of our 
land. After releasing them and implementing the Palestinian 
national authority, we will be responsible for making this 
citizen respect the agreements signed by the Palestinian 
National Authority, or try to topple them in a democratic manner 
through the Palestinian arena. We do not accept, in any way 
whatsoever, the principle of classification or discrimination by 
saying this one belongs to this faction and that to another 
faction. We reject this. We also refuse to consider the 
reasons that led this or that to be detained as a cause for 
keeping him there because we have fought, and many of our people 
were killed and punished by Israel. What is the meaning then 
that our fighters and strugglers remain in prison while those 
who fought us and killed us from their side enjoy happiness and 
freedom? 
  [Abu-Sumayyah] Will the Palestinian authority allow freedom 
of expression and the press and the pluralism of parties? 
  [Al-Rujub] From my position within the PLO as a member of 
the 
Palestine National Council, of the PLO's higher military 
council, and as the official in charge of preventive security 
and within the limits of my prerogatives and my position as a 
Palestinian nationalist, I promise that we will give the 
opposition forces the natural right and the right that is 
acknowledged by all laws to express their opinion in a 
civilized, democratic, and ethical manner without physical and 
verbal violence. 
  [Abu-Sumayyah] As well as political and press freedom? 
  [Al-Rujub] The freedom of the press and expression, the 
right 
to demonstrate and to criticize, and to hold seminars praising 
or criticizing the sound or wrong performance of the national 
authority. 
  [Abu-Sumayyah] Will there be Palestinian military censorship 
on the press? 
  [Al-Rujub] The censorship will not differ from that 
exercised 
by the most democratic states in the world. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Remarks by Jibril al-Rujub, official in charge of </F>
Palestinian Preventive Security in the West Bank, in Jericho on 
22 May -- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] I dare say that the reception 
my colleagues and I were accorded at the headquarters of the 
Preventive Security was a virtual plebiscite on the popularity 
of Fatah, the PLO, and Yasir 'Arafat and his political program. 
This is a great thing in which I take pride and which 
encourages me and my colleagues to stick to our political and 
organizational program. What has been achieved thus far is just 
one step on the road to the establishment of our independent 
Palestinian state.

patrols by the Palestinians and the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] 
would begin today. He noted that the main mission of the 
Palestinian police right now is to launch an investigation into 
yesterday's attack. We are very concerned, Sha'th said, because 
the Palestinians are responsible for whatever happens within the 
autonomous areas. He was speaking with reporters in Gaza after 
meeting Deputy Chief of Staff Amnon Shahaq and the head of the

  [Text] Joint Palestinian-Israeli patrols began operating 
today in the areas of Khan Yunus and Gaza city. According to 
the agreement, the patrols will travel on three routes along the 
Netzarim, Morag, and Qatif Bloc roads. 
  Each patrol will include two jeeps. A Palestinian officer 
and three policemen will ride in one vehicle, whereas the other 
jeep will carry an Israeli Border Police officer and three 
soldiers. 
  Our Army affairs correspondent Karmela Menashe reports that 
the length of each route five to seven kilometers and the units 
patrolling it will be responsible for maintaining security in 
the area. There will also be a joint Palestinian-Israeli foot 
patrol in the vicinity of the Erez checkpoint and at the 
entrance to the Gaza Strip.

  [Excerpts] The Israeli occupation Army has today decided to 
prevent the Palestinian citizens in the Gaza Strip from entering 
the rest of occupied Palestine. [passage omitted] 
  More details from our correspondent in the occupied 
territories: 
  [Begin unidentified correspondent recording] The first 
challenge faced by the Israeli-Palestinian agreement has been 
represented by two armed attacks in the Gaza Strip on Israeli 
soldiers. [passage omitted] 
  Radwan Abu 'Ayyash, chief of the Palestinian radio and 
television authority, commented on the operations by saying: 
  [Abu 'Ayyash] Naturally, such incidents have a negative 
affect on the peace process, but they could also be a necessary 
incentive for putting an end to the occupation and putting an 
end to these consecutive waves of violence, be it by this or 
that side. This requires us to work relentlessly and without 
weariness to achieve a comprehensive and just settlement for the 
Palestinian people, and security for all the inhabitants of the 
region.

<F P=106> [Interview with Furayh Abu-Middayn, member of the </F>
Palestinian National Authority, by As'ad 'Attar in Gaza; date 
not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Abu-Middayn] There is an agreement in place. We 
are not negotiating new terms. We are implementing the Cairo 
agreement. However, the Palestinian police are coming up 
against obstacles not of their own making, but that originate in 
the donor nations that made decisions and signed pacts with the 
Palestinians calling for the police force to be outfitted with 
all the necessary materiel -- cars, communications equipment, 
and transport. We have yet to take delivery of all the promised 
cars. Some of the cars that have to be sent to certain 
locations have no radios. We cannot send a soldier on an 
assignment without communications. We cannot send a civilian 
instead of a military vehicle. The donor nations have yet to 
honor the commitments they have given to the Palestinians. It 
is the major stumbling block to the Palestinian movement and 
deployment in the Gaza strip. We are not negotiating new terms. 
We will implement the agreement in place. 
  ['Attar] But the police have already started their duties. 
  [Abu-Middayn] Today, joint patrols were in action. The 
Palestinians maintain a presence in all designated road 
junctions, where the settlers are allowed to travel under 
Israeli military escort. The Palestinians are present in all 
the localities indicated on the maps that were signed in Cairo. 
  ['Attar] Have security checkpoints been set up close to the 
Erez roadblock? 
  [Abu-Middayn] There is a Palestinian security checkpoint 
there. There is one in the Military Police area and on the Gaza 
coast near Netzarim. The checkpoints shown on the map are now 
all in place. 
  ['Attar] And what about disarming civilians who still 
possess firearms? 
  [Abu-Middayn] It would be more to the point to talk about 
controlling the use of weapons rather than disarming civilians. 
Civilians need to apply for a license before they can carry 
firearms. The acquisition of weapons should be barred if no 
reasonable, plausible grounds can be advanced by applicants, 
especially since a considerable number of weapons have found 
their way into the hands of criminals, who used them in hold-ups 
and robberies. We are addressing this issue, which we do not 
take lightly. It is an issue that must be controlled. We will 
institute a ban on firing in the air as is customary on happy 
and festive occasions. The security authorities will take care 
of that. This issue figures high on the list of our priorities. 
This is because weapons have been alarmingly readily available 
in the past year. 
  ['Attar] The Israeli-Palestinian committees convened today. 
Have new security arrangements been worked out? 
  [Abu-Middayn] Every day brings new developments. But I have 
not left my office today. God willing, I will have the details 
this afternoon. 
  ['Attar] Thank you, Attorney Furayh Abu-Middayn. 
  [Abu-Middayn] Thank you.

  [Text] Brother President Yasir 'Arafat, president of the 
state of Palestine and chairman of the PLO Executive Committee, 
this evening received Mr. John McCarthy, U.S. ambassador to 
Tunisia. 
  During the meeting, President 'Arafat received from his 
excellency the U.S. ambassador an important message from Mr. 
Warren Christopher, the U.S. secretary of state, pertaining to 
the incident that led to the killing of two Israeli soldiers in 
the Arez area at the northern exit of Gaza Sector yesterday 
morning, and the gravity such incident poses to the peace 
process. 
  The message also concerns the invitation of Norway, in its 
capacity as president of the Liaison Committee of Donators to 
hold an urgent meeting on this coming Monday, 23 May, in 
Washington. 
  Secretary Christopher stressed in his message the United 
States' support for this meeting and its success in order to 
begin the process of development to consolidate peace. 
  It is worth noting that the aim of the perpetrators was not 
only to confront the Israelis who withdrew from Gaza two days 
ago, but also to confront the Palestinian national security and 
its direct responsibilities in the Gaza Sector and to its 
population according to the signed agreement.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by Fatah's Revoulutionary Council at the </F>
end of its 12th ordinary session on 16 and 17 May] 
  [Excerpts] The national liberation movement, Fatah, since 
its establishment, has faced great challenges and has 
consistently overcome them, and is able, through practice and 
the right political standce to adopt a set of principles and a 
program which serves the Palestinian people. Our movement 
revolted against the reality of the 1967 defeat and adopted the 
slogans of the masses to achieve the goals of the masses in 
returning and establishing an independent Palestinian state, 
with Holy Jerusalem as its capital. 
  It is normal that global difficulties affected the regional 
situation, which made our march a difficult and bitter one, 
marked with huge sacrifices. Our march was able to resist 
because of the huge sacrifices made by the Mujahid people and 
its struggling forces, despite the fact that its achievements 
were vulnerable to all means and attempts to dominate and even 
destroy them. 
  Therefore, starting from our conviction for a just and 
comprehensive peace, the movement took part in the peace process 
approved by the Palestinian National Council, prior to our 
delegation leaving for Madrid, putting before our eyes the 
objectives of our Palestinian people and with determination to 
establish its presence in the midst of these international 
changes. [sentence as heard] 
  The accord which was recently signed in Cairo is a natural 
outcome to the struggle of our people and its heavy sacrifices 
in the shadow of these accelerating international changes. 
  The Fatah Movement is confident that our people, wherever 
they are, will stand in a single rank in the battle of 
construction and building, the battle of building their 
independent state as they have always stood during all stages of 
the national struggle, one consequence of which is what we have 
achieved on the ground in the homeland. 
  Therefore, the unity of our people is the genuine guarantee 
for the success of Palestinian authority and a safe way toward 
the realization of an independent Palestinian state, with holy 
Jerusalem as its capital. 
  Therefore, we in the Fatah Movement call upon the Arab 
brothers and all friends to stand by us at this fateful moment, 
to back us in the building of our state as it is a Pan-Arab 
objective, and to firmly establish a just and comprehensive 
peace in our area, with all the consequences this will have on 
the entire Arab situation. We call for mutual assistance and 
solidarity in order to underpin the joint Arab position in the 
clash of civilizations in the area. 
  We in Fatah have waged our sincere and loyal struggle and 
our 
solid realistic practices for many years. Throughout the long 
dialogue with our brothers in the other factions -- even before 
their emergence -- it has taken us a long time to convince them 
of our work and what we are struggling for. We are now facing 
the political battle and creating a new policy in the area in 
the shadow of the new international order, the facts and 
[?settings] of which rule the entire area. 
  We are confident that our dialogue with all brothers is to 
clarify positions, facts, and variables, and to teach everyone 
of their national and Pan-Arab responsibilities, as we did 
during the jihad and the armed struggle after the great 
achievement at the eternal al-Karamah battle, during which the 
Fatah Movement offered the best of its youth and cadres. 
  We are facing a new era that is taking shape on the ground 
and requires every effort and perseverance from everyone. It 
requires from us -- after realization of the beginning of the 
return with the arrival of the Palestinian security forces in 
the homeland -- the rebuilding of the homeland, the 
infrastructure, and the creation of work opportunities for our 
struggling masses. 
  One of the main points of strength on which we depend is the 
strength of the starting point -- the revolution -- its 
achievements and influence on world opinion, the effectiveness 
of the blessed Intifadhah, the determination of our Palestinian 
people inside the occupied homeland and outside to accomplish 
their national objectives, their adherence to unity and 
cohesion, and denying the enemies all chances of creating 
division and conflicts within their ranks, and attempts to 
create alternatives to their leadership. 
  These points of strength will themselves firmly establish 
the 
Palestinian people on the map of the Middle East and the world. 
However, this by far falls short of their ambitions or rights 
and below the requirements of justice. However, it is the 
beginning from which we start to work toward the elimination of 
the Zionist occupation of our land and to realize our legitimate 
rights, according to the resolutions of the United Nations. 
  The clash between cultures and the competition between 
civilizations is a legitimate matter, and it is the real test 
for our relations with Israel. We can score some points in this 
area. 
  The world is going through a phase which totally rejects 
the policy of no peace, no war. We, as a movement, are required 
to take our people out of the tunnel of the Cold War in order to 
establish them on the political and geographic map of the region 
and the world. The phase of moving to a homeland requires a 
definition of the bases and the concept of this move, and of 
Fatah's role in the phase which would follow the move to the 
homeland. It also requires a definition of Fatah's view of the 
principles and provisions of carrying out national duties in 
order to build a Palestinian state and a Palestinian society 
within the history and civilization of the Palestinian people. 
This course is based on its affiliation spiritually, 
nationally, and organically to its Arab nation, and on its just 
rights to a homeland and free choices of its right to return and 
to self-determination. 
  The Fatah Movement values the great stand taken by the 
Egyptian president, Government, and people in supporting the 
peace process and hosting the talks on its territory. Fatah 
also appreciates the stand of the brotherly Jordanian king, 
Government, and people, marked by their persistent support for 
the Palestinian issues, the latest of which was facilitating the 
crossing of our forces to our dear land. 
  Also, the stand of the brothers in the Gulf, at the 
forefront 
of whom are the brothers in Saudi Arabia, led by His Majesty 
King Fahd, custodian of the two holy places, who are 
transporting our forces from where they are stationed to the 
homeland. In addition, there is also the stand of the brothers 
in Algeria, Libya, Sudan, Iraq, Mauritania, Lebanon, and Syria, 
who are hosting their Palestinian brothers. 
  We also send salutations to the sincere brotherly stand of 
fraternal Tunisia and its president Zine El Abidine, Zine El 
Arab [as heard], its government, and its fraternal people, for 
providing all requirements of success for the work and activity 
of the Palestinian Liberation Organization and its institutions, 
and for its strong support to the Palestinian positions in the 
peace process. [passage omitted] 
  We besiege God to guide our steps on the road to building 
our 
independent state on our national soil. It is a revolution 
until victory.

  [Text] The Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine has 
criticized the statement released by the 'Arafat leadership in 
reaction to the heroic commando attack at the Erez checkpoint in 
the northern Gaza Strip. The Islamic Jihad Movement's statement 
called 'Arafat's reaction another example of capitulation to the 
Zionist will and dictates. The statement regretted that the new 
authority should have reacted the way it did against an 
operation carried out by the Jihad Movement, when it cannot bar 
armed settlers from the self-rule areas. We reject this skewed 
logic, as do our people, who yesterday were jubilant over the 
heroic operation. 
  Our jihad will continue and we will keep our weapons as long 
as the occupation remains, the Jihad Movement's statement 
emphasized. 
  Meanwhile, the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, has 
issued 
a statement to mark the advent of the blessed 'Id al-Adha. As 
we celebrate the 'Id, advocates of negotiation and lovers of 
normalization with the Zionist entity try to convince us that 
the 27,000 sq. km that is Palestine has now shrunk to 400 sq. 
km, where they plan to set up an authority to provide for the 
security of the Zionist settlers and guard the interests of the 
shabby leadership. 
  The Hamas statement called for remembering the martyrs, 
detainees, and wounded, who put their lives on the line for the 
sake of the homeland. The statement also appealed for help to 
be extended to the poor among our people, whose ranks have been 
swollen by the Zionist closure of the occupied territories.

  [Text] The Islamic Jihad Movement for the Liberation of 
Palestine, the Aqsa detachments, has welcomed Israel's 
withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and the handing over of civil 
administration departments to the National Palestinian Authority. 
  In a statement issued today, the movement considered the 
withdrawal as a first step towards confirming our Palestinian 
people's right to liberation and the establishment of its 
independent state, with Jerusalem as its capital. 
  The movement hails the stand of our Palestinian people under 
the occupation, including all its sections, political forces, 
and national and social figures, for the welcome and cooperation 
they have given to the members of the Palestinian police forces, 
who came to protect them, establish security among them, and 
work towards the building of their national authority. 
  The movement holds the Israeli side and its political, 
military, and security leadership fully responsible for the 
recent massacre perpetrated by Israeli settlers and Israeli 
forces on 16 May against our people in Hebron and for the 
assault against women performing prayers at a mosque in the Bab 
al-Shaykh quarter. 
  The movement considers that all military attacks carried out 
by Palestinian mujahidin against the Israeli army and the armed 
settlers are caused by the Israeli occupation, the arming of 
Israeli settlers, and the maintaining of the settlements. 
  The movement therefore stresses the need to disarm the 
settlers, dismantle the settlements in the occupied territories, 
and start negotiations regarding the final phase as a means to 
prevent the stepping up of conflict and to preserve the peace 
process.

  [Text] The Palestinian Association for Human Rights today 
appealed to the amir of the State of Kuwait for an immediate 
pardon to 10 Palestinian students who were sentenced to death by 
the Kuwait State Security Court on 12 June last year. 
  The association requests the amir of Kuwait to respond to 
the 
appeal of the families and kinfolk of those sentenced to pardon 
their sons during these holy months and on the occasion of the 
blessed 'Id al-Adha. 
  It is worth mentioning that the appeal court will issue its 
ruling about the sentences against the students on 30 May in 
response to the appeal submitted by the convicted students.

  [Text] Khartoum, 20 May (MENA) -- Egyptian Ambassador in 
Khartoum Dr. Hasan Jad-al-Haqq has expressed his sorrow and deep 
regrets for the Sudanese authority's confiscation of 
Egyptian-owned homes and the expulsion of the Egyptian employees 
living in them. He said he hoped this conduct will not lead to 
undesirable consequences between the two Muslim neighbors. 
  In a statement to a MENA correspondent in Khartoum on his 
reaction to recent developments, Dr. Jad-al-Haqq said he finds 
no justification for the Sudanese conduct on such holy days. 
  Dr. Jad-al-Haqq added that he received a telephone call from 
Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa on the surprising Sudanese conduct, 
and the minister hoped things will not go too far. 
  The ambassador added that he asked Minister Musa to postpone 
the dispatch of an aircraft to transport Egyptian nationals from 
Sudan. He requested a chance to see whether his contacts with 
senior Sudanese officials and key figures, particularly Dr. 
Hasan al-Turabi, would succeed in solving this crisis, which 
might ruin relations between the two countries. 
  Dr. Jad-al-Haqq expressed the hope that the Sudanese will be 
reasonable and refrain from this conduct, which should never 
happen in a Muslim or non-Muslim state no matter what. 
  The ambassador questioned why officials in the Sudanese 
Government did not follow the traditional procedure of notifying 
him of their plans in advance.

  [Text] Cairo, 23 May (MENA) -- AL-AHRAM has stated the 
difficulty of the situation in Yemen as well as that of the Arab 
and international positions regarding the ongoing conflict 
there. The paper notes that it is hard for the world to adopt a 
clear-cut position on the latest developments in Yemen before 
the Arabs themselves do so, particularly following the breakaway 
of the south. 
  In its commentary today, the paper points out that 
intervention in Yemen will be difficult without knowing whether 
the world community will treat south Yemen as a separate and 
independent state, which makes it eligible to defend itself, and 
thus help it do so. The paper notes that the Arab world will 
have great difficulty defining its stance on the serious crisis 
in Yemen, although the Arabs' main concern is to end the 
ferocious fighting in Yemen. 
  AL-AHRAM adds that it will not be easy for the Arab states 
to 
agree on recognizing the new state in Yemen unless this leads to 
an end to the fighting. But such recognition may lead to an 
escalation in the fighting in Yemen. The paper concludes by 
saying that while it has not yet come out into the open, there 
is division among the Arabs over the current events in Yemen. 
Again, the paper adds, the Arab world will find itself facing a 
major crisis and another ill-omened fate.

  [Text] Asyut, Egypt, May 22 (AFP) -- The outlawed militant 
Islamic group the al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah has urged young people 
to join the holy war to topple President Husni Mubarak's secular 
government. 
  The appeal for jihad, or holy war, was made in a statement 
distributed after prayers marking Saturday's [21 May] feast of 
'Id al-Adha in the southern Egyptian provinces of Bani Suwayf, 
al-Minya and Asyut. A high police presence in Asyut meant the 
statement was not as widely distributed. 
  "You young people of Islam, what are you waiting for to join 
the march of the jihad, which will never cease," the leaflet 
asked. "The blood (of Islamists) is still flowing in prisons," 
it added referring to the death of the "martyr" 'Abd-al-Harith 
Madani, an Islamic defence lawyer who died in police custody. 
  Initial autopsy reports said he had died from being 
tortured, 
but a later statement from the Interior Ministry said he had 
suffered an asthma attack. 
  The al-Jama'ah has waged a two-year campaign to overthrow 
the 
government in which nearly 400 people have been killed. 
  The al-Jama'ah also denounced the Israel-PLO autonomy accord 
which launched Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and West 
Bank town of Jericho. In another statement it said the accord 
signed on May 4 in Cairo aimed to "wipe out the Islamic movement 
and give up the Al-Aqsa Mosque" in Jerusalem, one of the holiest 
sites in Islam. 
  The Muslim Brotherhood, tolerated as a religious 
organisation, also denounced the self-rule deal accusing PLO 
leader Yasir 'Arafat of giving in while praising the radical 
Hamas movement, saying "as long as people fight back, there is 
hope."

  [Excerpt] In a commentary on the situation in Yemen, JANA's 
Arab Affairs editor said that the collapse of the union in Yemen 
was undoubtedly the work of a reactionary and imperialist 
conspiracy. It is well known that the reactionary and 
imperialist forces, with the blatant hostility they harbor for 
Arab unity, have put a veto on the unity of the Arab nation and 
any unionist achievement between any two or more Arab countries. 
Our contemporary history is full of recent living examples, the 
abortion of the union between Egypt and Syria in 1958, embodied 
in the Arab united republic. Reactionary and imperialist 
schemes were behind the collapse of this union after only three 
years of its foundation. These schemes have also aborted the 
experience of the Arab-African union between Libya and Morocco; 
and there they are today carrying out their scheme against 
Yemen's union and is held responsible for the collapse of this 
four-year old union. [passage omitted]

  [Text] A military source made the following statement this 
morning: 
  At 0200 today, an Israeli enemy commando force, using two 
helicopters, kidnapped resistance official al-Haj Mustafa 
al-Dirani from his house in Qasr Naba village. The Israeli 
force used the road separating Kasrawan and al-Biqa' to carry 
out its action. 
  It should be recalled that Israeli helicopters were 
monitored 
flying at high altitude last night. The Lebanese army and 
Syrian forces were placed on alert. Patrols pursued the Israeli 
commando force in Qasr Naba and al-Furzul. Ground defenses 
opened fired at the helicopters as they were retreating toward 
the sea. 
  This operation is part of the enemy's piracy and continued 
violations of international laws and norms.

  [Text] Shaykh Muhammad Mahdi Shams al-Din, chairman of the 
Higher Islamic Shiite Council, has strongly condemned the 
Israeli act of piracy against the Qasr Naba village in al-Biqa' 
and the abduction of al-Haj Mustafa al-Dirani. He said this act 
reflects the true face of Zionist terrorism. 
  Shaykh Shams al-Din said: Israel committed this unjustified 
aggression at a time when Lebanon is regaining its stability and 
rebuilding its institutions. He stressed that the Israeli act 
represents a blatant violation of Lebanon's sovereignty and 
territorial integrity as well as all international norms and 
laws. This step, Shaykh Shams al-Din said, exposes Israel's 
false claims during the negotiations and its schemes against 
Lebanon and its independence. 
  In his statement, Shaykh Shams al-Din said: We urge the 
United Nations, the Security Council, and the human rights 
organizations to act promptly to end such bestial attacks and 
insure the release of al-Haj al-Dirani.

  [Text] On the occasion of the blessed 'Id al-Adha, 
spiritual leaders delivered several sermons today. They 
explained the significance of the 'Id and stressed the need for 
unity and adherence to national principles. 
  Shaykh 'Abd-al-Amir Qabalan, deputy chairman of the Higher 
Shiite Islamic Council and chief Ja'farite mufti, called for 
national unity to confront conspiracies. He stressed the 
importance of resistance as long as the Israeli occupation 
continues. He said: The south and Western al-Biqa' continue to 
be the chief concern, and suffering is growing as a result of 
the Israeli acts of aggression, which burn the land, threaten 
the infrastructure, and displace the people. This is a recording 
of an excerpt from Mufti Qabalan's speech: 
  [Begin recording] What kind of solutions does Israel want? 
It wants us to surrender. It is asking us for the Israeli 
corporal [navigator Ron Arad], so why do we not ask it for 
Shaykh 'Abd-al-Karim 'Ubayd? It is asking us for the corpses of 
the Israeli soldiers, so why do we not ask it for our live 
detainees in its prisons? It is demanding that we stop 
resistance, so why do we not demand that it withdraw from the 
south and Western al-Biqa'? Israel wants everything, and if it 
wants to give something it does so through a dispenser, drop by 
drop. Therefore, we tell the kin and brothers that we have to 
demonstrate solidarity and deal with each other honestly, 
sincerely, amicably, and respectfully. We tell them to avoid 
hatred and tension. Israel does not differentiate between a 
fighter and a non-fighter, between the inhabitants of the border 
strip and the inhabitants of al-Biqa', or between northerners 
and southerners. It views every Arab and Muslim as an enemy 
that must be annihilated. [end recording]

  [Text] Hizballah has issued a statement on the crime 
involving the kidnapping of Hajj Mustafa al-Dirani. The 
statement said: With the dawning of the blessed 'Id al-Adha and 
while the Muslims were celebrating the feast of sacrifice, 
official international and Zionist terrorism was chasing the 
Lebanese inside their villages and homes within the view and 
hearing of the world public and was committing against them acts 
of piracy and kidnapping. This proves the criminal nature of 
the Jews, who do not hesitate to commit the ugliest crimes, 
violate the most sacred values, kill women and children, and 
kidnap peaceful civilians. 
  Today the Zionist entity committed a new crime added to its 
list of abominable crimes and aggressive acts, including the 
acts of kidnapping and piracy with which its history is replete. 
  The statement added: This ugly crime is the clearest picture 
and the most eloquent expression of the official terrorism 
exercised by the Zionist entity backed by the global arrogant 
forces, above all the United States. 
  The crime was committed after an official decision was 
issued 
by the enemy government, which pursues terrorism as a firm 
policy in dealing with the peoples of this region. This proves 
the criminal nature of the Zionist entity and the occupying 
Jews, who are supported by the global arrogant forces. 
  The statement continued: This crime has proved that there is 
no place in Lebanon safe from the Zionist danger, which is 
threatening everyone. This means we must consider all of 
Lebanon as a confrontational area in which our people must 
maintain constant resistance against the Jewish threat.

Israeli piracy, saying: Israeli aggressive acts are being 
repeated every day against Lebanon without the United States or 
Europe raising their voices against Israel and asking it to stop 
its aggression against peaceful people. 
  Israel says the resistance is the cause of its operations. 
However, we ask Israel: If the resistance is the cause, why 
don't you confront the resistance fighters in their positions? 
  He added: The enemy derives its freedom from our weakness 
and differences. It also derives its freedom from the support 
of global arrogant forces.

Mustafa al-Dirani, a Lebanese national resistance official, from 
his house in Qasr Naba and carting him off to occupied Palestine. 
  His eminence said it is high time for the Arab nation to 
wake 
up, unify its ranks, and curb Israel's continued acts of piracy. 
He said that the unity of objectives, thoughts, stances, and 
decisions; the rallying of all potentials and energies; and 
joint planning to attain the objective of our nation to salvage 
its honor and regain its rights and glory represent the sole way 
toward salvation. 
  Shaykh Qabban add: This is a frank call for confronting 
Israel's designs, which is lying in wait for our Arab nation.

no region in Lebanon is safe from the Israeli danger. He said 
the people must remain united to confront Israel and support

Israeli terrorism is nothing new and the latest operation in 
Qasr Naba proves that Israel is still the same and its talk of 
peace is a worthless illusion.

<F P=106> [Report by Tariq Abu-Hamdan: "Eastern Sector"] </F>
  [Excerpts] According to reports being disseminated by 
Lahdist militia circles, the Israeli army will probably carry 
out a limited withdrawal from the areas of Hasbayya and Jazzin 
and retreat to the area controlled by the militia during the 
reign of former militia Commander Sa'd Haddad and that was 
called "Free Lebanon" before the Israeli invasion in 1982. 
  Pro-Israel militia men report that the occupation army 
intends to withdraw from Hasbayya and Jazzin, where the Israeli 
army has been the target of fierce resistance attacks. This 
step will enable the Israeli army to keep away from the 
Hizballah-controlled combat line extending between Iqlim 
al-Tuffah and Western al-Biqa'. The Israeli army will create a 
3-8 km wide buffer zone that will separate the expected Israel 
withdrawal point and the resistance positions. Israel's 
objective behind this step is to cancel the combat line, explore 
whether the Lebanese Army can fill the vacuum should withdrawal 
occur, and control security in the area. It will also 
demonstrate Israel's good intentions during the upcoming 
peaceful negotiations and exploit it on the international level. 
  Observers believe that the Israeli occupation army's 
withdrawal from Kawkaba, which overlooks the western al-Biqa' 
and the liberated area in Hasbayya, is a basic step toward the 
Israeli withdrawal from the areas of Hasbayya and Jazzin and 
toward placing them under the full control of the Lahdist 
militia. The Lahdist militia has become more convinced that the 
Israeli occupation army is using it as a buffer to protect its 
presence inside the Lebanese territory. The observers also 
believe that the Israeli army views the militia as a burden 
restricting its freedom of options in the ongoing negotiations, 
especially as the militia cannot be legitimized or accepted on 
the Lebanese official and popular stance. Lebanon cannot even 
bargain over this militia's being a traitor and collaborating 
with the enemy. Accordingly, this issue plays a major role in 
the continuing desertion of many militia members. 
  Security sources affirm that the Lebanese army is fully 
prepared to fill any vacuum that might occur because of a sudden 
Israeli withdrawal. [passage omitted] 
  The security sources do not rule out that Israel might 
effect 
its partial withdrawal during the next three months, especially 
if a tangible progress is made on the issue of negotiations 
concerning what is called "Hasbayya and Jazzin First." Could 
this Israeli option be accepted by Lebanon?

  [Text] A spokesman of our country's Foreign Ministry 
condemned the Zionist enemy's aggressionist and terrorist action 
in kidnapping the leader of the Lebanese Believers' Resistance 
Movement, calling it a violation of the independence and 
territorial integrity of Lebanon. 
  He said: The reaction of America and other protectors of the 
Zionist regime clearly shows the level of adherence of those 
countries to international laws and the fight against state 
terrorism. 
  He added: The kidnapping of Mr. Mustapha al-Dirani by the 
Zionist regime's commandos and other terrorist actions of that 
regime inside and outside occupied Palestine and within the 
sovereign bounds of other countries demonstrate the true meaning 
of the peace and coexistence between the Zionist regime and Arab 
countries which America pursues. 
  He added: This is a warning to those who think by 
surrendering to the wishes of the Zionist regime peace and 
security would be maintained in the region.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] A spokesman for the Zionist entity's army has 
announced that Israeli commandos have kidnapped Mustafa 
al-Dirani, a leader of the Islamic resistance, from his house in 
the village of Qasr Naba in Lebanon's al-Biqa' Valley. 
Kidnapping and government terrorism are the main 
characteristics of the Zionist entity and the declared policies 
of Tel Aviv's Government. 
  Israel's brutal government lives in fear of the Muslims' 
power and the ability of the Islamic resistance front in Lebanon 
and occupied Palestine. The blows dealt by the Islamic 
resistance keep Israel in a constant state of nervousness. 
Therefore, it crushes all international values and norms and 
rushes to announce its responsibility for kidnappings, killings, 
and the most horrible crimes. 
  Israel has not minded perpetrating massacres, killing 
Palestinians and breaking their bones and demolishing their 
houses, and raiding south Lebanon and destroying residential 
areas in Iqlim al-Tuffah. After all, the usurper state of 
Israel was founded on the ideology of killing, terrorism, and 
crime. This is how it has managed to establish itself in the 
heart of the Islamic world for some length of time. 
  The Muslim Lebanese people, who are facing the Zionists in 
the first line of battle, have a long and enlightened history of 
confrontation with the Zionist entity. Over 13 years of direct 
Zionist intervention in Lebanon, interference by other 
international arrogant forces, and attempts by political 
Maronite forces to divide Lebanon, the revolutionary Muslims 
have played an important role in foiling all these conspiracies. 
The massacres of Sabra and Shatila, and the destructive war 
ignited by Michel 'Awn are still remembered. Those were links in 
a conspiracy designed to annihilate the Lebanese Muslims, 
restrict their freedom, and deny them their rights. 
  But it was the revolutionary Muslims who ended the theory of 
Israel's steel arm in southern Lebanon. They stood up against 
the despotic tendencies of Michel 'Awn's Maronite Army. They 
forced that Army, which paved the way for the Zionist aggression 
against Lebanon and the arrival of Israelis at the door of 
Beirut, to surrender. The Lebanese people foiled the schemes of 
Western espionage against Muslims. Their continued presence on 
the political stage, therefore, is the guarantee of Lebanon's 
independence and steadfastness in the face of Western schemes of 
partition and Zionist schemes of sedition. 
  The name of the Islamic resistance front is associated with 
the confrontation and repulsion of the Zionist aggressors. The 
Islamic resistance in southern Lebanon is the only defensive 
line against usurper Israel. Had the resistance not been there, 
the Zionists would have realized their dreams. Lebanon's entity 
is preserved through the jihad of the valiant Islamic resistance 
front. The Zionists perpetrate acts of terrorism and kidnapping 
because of their impotence and helplessness in the face of the 
Islamic resistance in southern Lebanon.

<F P=106> [Commentary prepared by the News Research and Commentaries </F>
Group] 
  [Text] Most of the attention in the Middle East remains 
focused on the illegal acts in east Lebanon by the regime 
occupying Jerusalem. Three days ago this regime's commandos 
kidnapped Mustafa al-Dirani, an official in Lebanon's Islamic 
Resistance, and took him to occupied Palestine. Al-Dirani is 
now being questioned and tortured by Israeli agents and, in 
their comments, Zionist officials have described this terrorist 
act as a sign of the Israeli army's capability, saying that the 
reason behind the kidnapping was to find out where one of its 
pilots whose plane crashed in Lebanon eight years ago is being 
held. 
  The Israeli aggressors have always resorted to terrorist 
means and have abducted or martyred people and 'ulema in south 
Lebanon. Among these acts, reference can be made to the 
abduction of Shaykh 'Ubayd, a Muslim leader, and the martyring 
of Sayyid 'Abbas al-Musawi, the Lebanese Hizballah leader, and 
members of his family. But naturally, attacks on defenseless 
villages, armed attacks on homes where only women and children 
are being housed, and the killing of unarmed men actually show 
the weakness, not the military might, of the regime occupying 
Jerusalem. 
  Another fundamental point is the silence by world forums on 
this flagrant violation of international regulations and the 
abduction of people from another country. In addition to 
trampling on the sovereignty of Lebanon, this act basically 
shows how Israel ignores international regulations and turns a 
blind eye to principles that it has apparently endorsed. 
Undoubtedly, a serious stance by the United Nations and support 
by free countries can lead to an effective condemnation of 
Israel and its mentors. At the same time, it should be expected 
that the most crushing answer to this feeble act come from 
combatant Muslims whose valorous deeds have always inflicted the 
greatest and strongest blows on the Zionist regime.

  [Text] Tehran, May 23, IRNA -- Three Iranian dailies Monday 
commented on the kidnapping of the leader of `the faithful 
resistance group of Lebanon', Mustafa al-Dirani and condemned 
the silence of international bodies on the tragedy. Reports 
indicate that Zionist forces kidnapped al-Dirani from his 
residence in eastern Lebanon early Saturday and took him away to 
the occupied terrritories. In its editorial, the Persian daily 
`JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI' termed the act as the most explicit form of 
state terrorism displaying the inhuman nature of the Zionist 
regime once again. However, said the daily, such crimes by the 
Zionists have always been connived and even supported by the 
west and international community thus encouraging the criminals 
to further expand such heinous actions. 
  All evidences indicate that what has happened and is 
happening in Lebanon is precisely a planned conspiracy, said the 
editorial adding, "the Lebanese government on the one hand 
disarms the anti-Israeli forces and renders them defenseless 
against the aggressions of the occupiers and on the other leaves 
the Zionists free to intrude the Lebanese territory". The daily 
considered it possible that the Zionist regime carried out its 
operation in coordination with Maronite communities and the 
so-called security forces of Lebanon. 
  Under the circumstances, said the paper, no one is secure 
even in his own house as long as the occupying Zionists continue 
their heinous actions with impunity. The final solution is, 
therefore, the elimination of the Zionist regime, it added. The 
paper also said that the events of the past few months cast 
doubt on the sincerity of the Lebanese officials towards the 
resistance of southern Lebanon notwithstanding their occasional 
support. 
  The contemporary history of Lebanon has taught the people 
that they can defeat the brutal Zionists in their land if they 
keep an eye on the infiltrated mercenaries of Tel Aviv in every 
corner of the country. The editorial stressed that fighting 
against the occupiers is not possible without identifying 
lackeys. 
  Commenting on the same subject, another Persian daily 
`ABRAR' 
criticized international bodies for keeping mum towards the 
abduction saying that they did not even condemn the explicit 
Zionist encroachment upon the Lebanese sovereignty. It said 
that the advantages the Zionost regime reaped from this 
operation and its ensuing propaganda against Iran and other 
progressive Muslim and nationalist forces in the Middle East 
deserve contemplation. 
  The paper stressed that the Americans seemingly have no 
problem in mending fences even with some of the anti-Zionist and 
Muslim forces in the region. However, this is not the case with 
Iran, it added. The editorial warned that if Damascus joins the 
reconciliation trend of the so-called peace talks in the Middle 
East, the western mass media and certain regional governments 
will launch a propaganda to label Iran as a country who 
endangers the security of the region. Washington envisages that 
Iran would take a passive stance vis-a-vis the developments in 
the Middle East once Damascus joins the reconciliation trend, 
wrote the paper. The daily called for the mobilization of all 
diplomatic potentials to avoid landing in such a situation and 
called for adopting a strategy based on national security and 
interests. 
  The English daily `TEHRAN TIMES' referred to the statements 
made by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin that the kidnapping 
had been carried out under the direct supervision of his 
government and asked what powers are behind the terrorist regime 
whose chief of government shamelessly proclaim he had issued 
orders for the operation. "The most interesting aspect of the 
situation, if it is at all possible to find an interesting 
aspect in this criminal act, is the new definitions the western 
statesmen offer for some of the political terms, and then use 
the vast network of the mass media they have at their disposal 
to publicise those illogical definitions." According to the new 
political terminology devised by the Americans, said the paper, 
a nation that is fighting for the freedom of its land is a 
terrorist nation, whereas a government that openly occupies 
territories from other nations and kidnaps people is an 
anti-terrorist government. "The Zionist regime's justifications 
for engaging in terrorist acts is indicative of its irrational 
aggressive attitude," stressed the editorial. 
  Turning to the Zionist regime's claims that Arad was 
captured 
when his plane was downed in southern lebanon during a 
bombardment mission, it said that Hizballah should put the 
airman on trial as a war criminal and punish him indeed if they 
have him in their captivity. "The trial of this war criminal 
will be a good lesson for other Israeli pilots who commit the 
inhuman act of slaughtering women and children in southern 
Lebanon," concluded the daily.

<F P=106> [Second Friday sermon by President Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani </F>
in Tehran on 20 May -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] In the name of God, the merciful, the 
compassionate. [passage omitted] 
  Another issue is the issue of hajj. Unfortunately, this year 
with the immaturity shown by the Saudi regime, our society was 
deprived of its holy objectives in this political and religious 
rite of Islam [disavowal of infidels ceremony]. The Saudis 
addressed the issue very badly. They could have solved the 
problem much more sensibly and not caused differences between 
the two important countries of the region. They could have 
taken more of our pilgrims. The ceremonies could have taken 
place in a way so as not to cause any problems for them. We had 
informed them that we did not wish to disturb anyone and that we 
intended to hold religious ceremonies. However, we have to wait 
to see under what conditions they took this immature step, we 
have to wait to understand its roots. 
  Of course, today Islamic unity and the unity of Muslims is 
very important for us as a principle alongside the principle of 
disavowal. We attach as much importance to friendship as we do 
to disavowal. These two go together. To prevent a new crisis 
and with the agreement of the esteemed leader [Khamene'i], we 
prevented the occurrence of a new sedition in Arabia. 
  We do not think it is appropriate under the current 
conditions in the world of Islam ...[sentence incomplete as 
heard] The world of Islam has many crisis points: Afghanistan, 
Tajikistan, Nagorno-Karabakh, Bosnia, Palestine, Somalia, Iraq 
-- and recently, unfortunately, Yemen in which a senseless, 
wrong-headed civil war has been started and in which Muslims are 
being sacrificed for the selfishness and ambitions of various 
individuals and factions. The blood of the people is being 
shed, the wealth of the poor people of this region is being 
burned. We have so many crisis points. The leader of the 
revolution wisely prevented another crisis taking shape. 
  However, the Saudis should think harder about this issue. A 
task that does not cause them any disruption and which can be 
correctly undertaken with the agreement of both sides 
...[sentence incomplete as heard]. A hajj that means hajj to a 
Shiite can take place. We hope that the situation they created 
this year will act as a lesson to them so that it is not 
repeated next year. [passage omitted] 
  We hope that we can have a program acceptable to both sides 
for next year's hajj in which both our views and the views of 
the Saudis are catered for, and through which the Saudis' 
concerns will be alleviated. [passage omitted] 
  Finally I would like to refer to my recent visit to Gilan 
Province. If I deliver a sermon after such visits I usually 
refer to them and explain a few issues. People are quite aware 
and I only mention a few points. Many things became clearer to 
us during that visit. Indeed we saw Gilan Province full of 
epic, solidly on the [revolution] scene, faithful to the 
revolution and supportive of our imam [Khomeyni] and our leader 
[Khamene'i]. [passage omitted] 
  Anywhere we went masses of people gathered -- in Rasht and 
other provinces -- which was even beyond our expectations. 
Usually the end of the crowd could not be seen. People were so 
happy and cheerful which made one wonder about the amazing 
negative propaganda bombardment that our people are subjected 
to. Various podiums within the country, media and foreign radios 
usually enlarge problems. They speak of high prices, inflation, 
economic and political problems, and other small talk. They 
speak of ordinary incidents as huge incidents causing 
insecurity. And such a great deal of propaganda bombardment has 
not had the slightest effect on the people. That is very 
strange. Why are our people so aware? Of course that awareness 
does not exist only in Gilan Province. [passage omitted] 
  I think that our people see the realities of life and 
juxtapose them against this misleading propaganda and slogans 
and realize how much the revolution has done for them. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] 'Arafat, May 21, IRNA -- Head of the Iranian hajj 
pilgrims, Hojjat ol-Eslam Mohammad Mohammadi Reyshahri said here 
Friday [20 May] that U.S. is trying to target Iran for fear of 
the globalization of Islam. 
  Reyshahri, who was addressing a large group of hajj 
pilgrims, 
said whether the enemies like it or not, they should know that 
the Almighty's promise is true and Islam will eventually fill 
the earth. 
  He referred to prayer as a strong weapon against the enemies 
and said today is a day that one should pray for deliverance 
from the enemy, especially for the immediate annihilation of the 
U.S. and its mercenaries. 
  Reyshahri added: "To whom (other than God) should we 
complain 
that we cannot disavow polytheists and cannot chant death to the 
criminal U.S. which commits crimes against Islam and Muslims?" 
  He censured those responsible for banning holding of the 
rally against disbelievers and said "pilgrims intended to voice 
their disavowal of polytheists at the ka'ba but were not allowed. 
  "We would complain to Imam Mahdi (may God hasten his 
reappearance) to take our revenge." 
  Reyshahri said the pilgrims' silence made people in even the 
remotest parts of the world aware of the real facts. 
  Saudi authorities last Monday forced the Iranian pilgrims to 
cancel the scheduled rally despite earlier promises to allow its 
holding.

  [Text] Tehran, May 21, IRNA -- The students and staff of 
the Qom Theological Centre felicitated the leader of the Islamic 
revolution, Ayatollah Seyyed 'Ali Khamene'i here Saturday [21 
May] on the occasion of 'Id-ul-Adha and deplored the unislamic 
attitude of Saudi rulers. 
  "Although Muslims feel bitter about the Saudi regime's 
banning of the disavowal of polytheists rally, as was evident in 
your valuable remarks, it is a matter of regret that a 
government which styles itself as servant of holy shrines 
obstructs such rally at the centre of monotheism and 
revelation," read the message. 
  It hoped the Saudi regime would realize its folly of 
following the dictates of Zionism and arrogant powers, 
especially the criminal U.S., and next year would allow pilgrims 
to stage the disavowal of polytheists rally which is a basic 
part of the "Abrahmic Hajj".

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] Following more than two weeks of fierce fighting 
between the forces of north and south Yemen, the secretary 
general of Yemen Socialist Party, 'Ali Salim al-Bid, announced 
the formation of an independent state in South Yemen today, May 
21. 
  In the wake of the announcement, al-Bid said: The new 
country 
will be one according to the present constitution in the north. 
He added: Elections will be held in the country within a period 
of one year. The news related to the establishment of the 
Democratic Republic of Yemen has been published at a time when 
the Yemeni Government in Sanaa called for the implementation of 
a three-day cease-fire in the civil war in that country late 
Friday [20 May]. 
  Meanwhile incoming reports say that the southern forces have 
withdrawn from the strategic al-Anad base which has fallen to 
the northern forces. Though according to informed sources the 
forces of the north are advancing toward Aden, the capital of 
the south, but the resistance being put up by the southern 
forces will not make it so easy for the northern forces to 
capture Aden, the main headquarters of the Socialist Party. 
  At any rate, Yemen's present situation and its redivision 
speak of the fact that with the passage of four years since the 
unification of the two northern and southern sectors, in May 
1990, the trend adopted by the Yemeni leaders had neither been 
logical nor in line with the basic principle of unity. The 
Socialist Party's concern over its limited role in running the 
country's affairs and the resulting dissension over the division 
of power, which surfaced openly after the parliamentary 
elections in April last year, laid the foundation for the 
present deep differences. This is so because, despite the 
reunification of the northern and southern sectors, as the 
Congress Party and the Socialist Party were considered opponents 
in the past due to their different ideologies, the tension 
between them deepened following the weakening of the Socialist 
Party after the parliamentary elections -- so much so that 
al-Bid stopped taking part in political activities 10 months 
ago. In this connection he offered an 18-point plan for running 
the country on the basis of a federal system calling for a far 
more serious role for the Socialist Party. However considering 
it as being a threat against the unity, the Yemeni president 
rejected the plan. This led to the deepening of differences and 
the fear that the Yemeni crisis may assume regional proportions. 
So certain regional countries mediated in the matter and a 
reconciliation accord was signed in Amman, but these efforts did 
not yield any result. According to political analysts, the two 
rival parties had assumed that with the failure of political 
efforts military means could have proved effective in reducing 
the tension or that it would at least secure the interests of 
one of the two sides. But it is war, bloodshed, and the loss of 
natural and financial resources that Yemen is currently 
witnessing. Further, in view of the fact that unity had been 
the goal of the nation and even the state officials, the outcome 
of the independence announced by the southerners as the final 
solution to the deep ongoing crisis will not encompass the 
national will and may plunge Yemen in yet deeper turmoil.

  [Text] Tehran, May 22, IRNA -- A morning daily here Sunday 
[22 May] said that recent developments in Yemen are alarming and 
would jeopardize stability in the region. 
  "Remaining passive observers, regional countries did little 
to stop the crisis, except to make formal bids for unsuccessful 
mediation between former communist South Yemen and former 
conservative North Yemen, which merged in 1990," wrote the daily 
`TEHRAN TIMES.' 
  The two Yemen, said the editorial, were different culturally 
and economically and it was natural that it would have taken 
time for them to be one. Therefore, Yemenis needed moral 
support and economic assistance which they could not receive for 
pure political reasons and because of drastic global changes, 
the article said. 
  "Most observers believe that Yemenis are punished by the 
United States and its allies in the region because of Sanaa's 
support of Saddam Husayn during the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 
August 1990." Naturally, Iran is concerned with events in Yemen 
and recently offered to mediate. "Iran is the only country in 
the region which remains neutral so that Tehran's moves might 
bear fruit." 
  The daily concluded by calling on leaders of Yemen to listen 
to voice of reason and invest all sources at their disposal for 
the reconstruction of their country. "The Yemeni people need 
bread and butter and jobs which can be provided through 
development projects, not bullets."

  [Text] Tehran, May 22, IRNA -- The U.S. is trying by all 
possible means to hinder the expansion of relations between Iran 
and Turkmenistan, an informed source told IRNA Sunday [22 May]. 
  He said that the U.S., using its influence on oil and gas 
consortium in Turkmenistan, was doing its best to obstruct the 
construction of a pipeline for export of Turkmen gas via Iran 
and Turkey. The source, who asked not to be named, said the 
orders issued by President Niyazov on setting up of a gas 
pipeline to Europe via Iran and Turkey were generally ignored by 
those at the lower part of that country's chain of command 
manily due to obstacles put by Washington. 
  The U.S. has so far created numerous problems for 
Iran-Turkmenistan joint project by exercising its influence. 
The Turkmen minister of oil and gas is said to be one of 
critics of President Niyazov's views, having close links with 
the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. People such as the Turkmen 
minister of oil and gas have recently come out with new 
proposals that the proposed pipeline pass through Azerbaijan and 
Georgia instead of Iran and Turkey. 
  The source said that the Islamic Republic has informed 
President Niyazov through various channels of its 
dissatisfaction with Washington's attempts to block expansion of 
ties between Iran and Turkmenistan.

<F P=106> [Commentary by M. Paydar: "The Karabakh Crisis and the Need </F>
for Vigilance"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The role of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran in the Nagorno-Karabakh crisis is wrapped in 
ambiguity. Iran, which has always been involved in the Karabakh 
crisis and has exerted many efforts to find a solution to the 
war, has unfortunately remained silent on the outcome of the 
Bishkek conference and on the possible dispatch of military 
forces to the region. Unfortunately none of the sides--the 
Russians, the Azeris, and the Armenians--were ready to grant 
Tehran a role in the recent talks and they treated Iran more 
marginally than was apparent. 
  At any rate, a country should know its own limits and how it 
can influence those around it. It is not logical for our 
country's political cadre and Foreign Ministry officials to be 
satisfied merely with some remarks by an Azeri or Armenian 
official on the importance of Iran's role in the region while 
being excluded from the scene with no hurt feelings. A new 
situation is in the making in the Caucasus region, and the 
geopolitical situation of the region will soon undergo more 
changes. Our diplomats' silence will not solve any problems. 
What is the use of assessing a situation after it is over? 
This call for vigilance is being issued today. We hope that 
the nation's officials will be more responsible in dealing with 
press reaction on political issues.

  [Text] Tehran, May 22 (AFP) -- An Iranian delegation is to 
visit Iraq on June 11 to discuss the fate of POWs from the 
1980-1988 war, Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati said. 
  Velayati, quoted on Sunday by ETELLA'AT newspaper, said the 
visit was initially scheduled to take place next week, but that 
it had been postponed at the request of Baghdad. The minister 
did not say whether or not he would be heading the delegation. 
  Tehran radio said on May 4 that Velayati was preparing a 
trip 
to Iraq to discuss bilateral ties and the fate of thousands of 
prisoners of war from both countries. If the visit takes place, 
it would be the first by Velayati to Iraq since the 1991 Gulf 
War, when U.S.-led forces drove Iraqi troops from Kuwait. 
  The POW issue is the main obstacle to improved relations 
between the two neighbors. Tehran says Iraq is still holding 
8,000 of its citizens, military and civilian, including soldiers 
captured almost 20 years ago in border skirmishes. But Iraq has 
denied holding any and claims 20,000 of its own troops are being 
held in Iran. 
  Iran said last week that Iraq had freed three Iranian 
prisoners, the first such release in two years. Iran has 
unilaterally released hundreds of Iraqi POWs during the past two 
years.

    [Editorial report] London ITV Television Network in English 
at 1830 GMT on 19 May in its "3-D" program carries at 15-minute 
report entitled "Saddam's Secret Bomb," showing exclusive video 
footage of Iraq's bomb factories -- revealing the whole truth 
about Iraq's nuclear program, raising questions about the role 
of the British Government, and international monitoring agencies. 
  The program opens with shots of a Scud missile landing on an 
allied base during the Gulf war and a parade of Iraqi weaponry, 
followed by comments from David Kay, the UN investigator who 
uncovered Iraq'secret weapons program after the Gulf war. Kay 
says: "They were probably 36-months away from having deliverable 
type of weapons that would have fit either their own Scud 
missiles or extended range Scuds, or in their high performance 
aircraft in small numbers. If the war had not intervened -- as 
we sit here today in mid-1994, they would have at least have had 
crude nuclear devices, and probably their first deliverable 
packages would have coming on line." 
  Over extensive shots of Iraqi nuclear sites scattered 
throughout Iraq, and shots of various items of equipment Kay 
then says: "The major building where they were going to 
manufacture nuclear weapons, actually cast the uranium metal, 
cut it into shapes, put the high explosive around it, is one 
that could well have produced twenty nuclear weapons a year no 
problem. It was quite frankly better than most of the American 
facilities that do the same thing. A lot of the equipment was 
still there in crates, and it was really something that any lab 
in the West would be happy to have." 
  The report then shows exclusive video taken by the Iraqi's 
prior to the Gulf war, showing extensive shots of its 
(?Calutron) plant which used huge magnetic coils to extract the 
nuclear material, followed by comments from U.S Senate 
investigator Ken Timmerman who says: "We were on the verge of a 
nuclear catastrophe in Iraq and nobody was really aware of what 
was going on. One of the problems with nuclear proliferation is 
that you can never know with certainty exactly how far away a 
country such as Iraq is from the bomb. Our intelligence 
community does not know and they cannot know. The Iraqi's had a 
fantastic international procurement network. They were buying 
companies all over the world, but the very heart of it was in 
London, they would set up dummy companies to purchase on the 
open market high technology, machine-tools, nuclear materials, 
everything that they needed for their nuclear weapons program." 
  The report goes on to show footage of Iraqi factories at 
al-Tuwaitha, al-Atheer, and Badr, a list of British companies 
who unwittingly supplied equipment to Iraq, unaware it would be 
diverted to its secret bomb program, and a MI6 document warning 
of Iraq's nuclear capability. John Gordon, former head of the 
British Foreign Office Nuclear Department, then says: "I think 
Britain broke her obligations as a nuclear weapons state under 
the Non-Proliferation Treaty, because under Article One we are 
enjoined and we agree in no way directly or indirectly to help 
other countries acquire nuclear weapons, and in selling 
machine-tool equipment which we knew might well be used for 
making centrifuges for the illicit nuclear weapon enrichment 
program, it seemed to me we were quite clearly in breach of this 
obligation." 
  Over footage of UN inspections of the Iraqi bomb sites, 
Kimmerman concludes by saying: "A nuclear India, a nuclear 
Pakistan, a potentially nuclear Iran, potentially nuclear Iraq, 
a nuclear North Korea, perhaps South Korea, perhaps Japan as 
well armed with nuclear weapons. What is going to keep them 
from using those weapons? There are no security arrangements 
that could prevent the next war from being nuclear. There are 
other countries that are seeking nuclear weapons and they are 
doing the same things that the Iraqi's did, the same type of 
procurement, and we in our greed are making the same mistakes."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "'Id-al-Adha and the Extraordinary Challenges"] </F>
  [Text] His Majesty King Husayn's visit to fraternal Syria 
yesterday, on the eve of the first day of the blessed 'Id 
al-Adha, is another effort that can be added to his majesty's 
work to reactivate Arab solidarity and bolster coordination and 
consultation between the two fraternal countries regarding all 
issues of joint interest, particularly the latest developments 
in the peace process. The two sides agreed on the need to adopt 
a unified Arab stand toward the peace talks and against the 
continuous Israeli procrastination in responding to the 
requirements of a just, lasting, and comprehensive peace 
acceptable to coming generations. 
  Israel has again proved its evasive policy toward the peace 
process by foiling U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's 
recent tour of the region as part of its attempts to conclude 
separate deals with each Arab party. This requires a unified 
Arab stand based on true and serious coordination. Perhaps, the 
Amman- Damascus line is the basic pillar of this path. 
  In the current difficult circumstances, our Arab nation 
needs, at least, a minimum level of solidarity to heal wounds 
and to turn a new leaf in order to confront huge challenges. 
These challenges are embodied by the peace process, the bloody 
and regrettable fighting among the brothers in Yemen which has 
been going on for more than two weeks, the unjust embargo 
clamped on fraternal Iraq which has lost all its justifications, 
and the embargo on fraternal Libya. Many other issues and 
problems affecting Arabs and Muslims also require a courageous 
stand. 
  The blessed 'Id al-Adha is the best opportunity to reexamine 
inter-Arab relations, to show tolerance, to heal wounds, and to 
proceed toward a better future that restores the nation to its 
position and pride. While calling for making 'Id al-Adha a true 
'Id for the entire nation so it can close ranks, we would like 
to remember that His Majesty King Husayn has always been 
persistent in his initiatives and efforts to settle and discard 
Arab differences and return life to fraternal relations.

  [Text] Jordan today reiterated its support for Yemeni 
legitimacy and the unity of the Yemeni people, refusing, at the 
same time, to clearly condemn Aden's decision yesterday to 
establish an independent state in the south. 
  Government-run Jordanian radio and television have been 
reporting, without comment, the views of northerners and 
southerners. However, official Jordanian media have recently 
referred to the southerners as the separatist forces, the 
description used by the northerners, who are referred to as the 
government forces.

Damascus at 1230 today. [passage omitted]

al-Asad and His Majesty King Husayn held a meeting, which was 
attended on the Syrian side by Vice President 'Abd-al-Halim 
Khaddam, Vice President Muhammad Zuhayr Mashariqah, Prime 
Minister Mahmud al-Zu'bi, Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar', and

attended by the two sides' delegations, as well as Rashid 
Akhtarini, deputy prime minister for services affairs, Dr. 
Muhammad Harbah, minister of interior affairs, and Dr. Muhammad

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Gentlemen: On the eve of the blessed 'Id al-Adha, 
President Hafiz al-Asad and King Husayn held a comprehensive 
evaluation of the developments in the peace process and the 
obstacles Israel has placed in the way of a just and 
comprehensive solution to the crisis in the region. The two 
Arab leaders agreed to continue bilateral consultations and 
coordination on positions. 
  If we recall the recent past, we see that Jordan was 
subjected to intense pressure to sign a separate agreement with 
Israel. Jordan refused such an agreement and emphasized the 
continuation of its coordination with the brothers, especially 
Syria. 
  Jordanian officials revealed that Israel wants to sign a 
peace agreement with Jordan without withdrawing from the 
occupied Jordanian territories in return. 
  Likewise, sisterly Lebanon was subjected to similar 
pressure. 
Israel escalated its aggressions against southern villages, 
towns, and cities to the extent of displacing tens of thousands 
of Lebanese citizens and threatening an all-out sweep. 
  As usual, Israel used the pretext of national resistance, 
but 
the main reason was Lebanon's refusal to sign a separate 
agreement and its insistence on the implementation of Security 
Council Resolution 425, which requires Israel to unconditionally 
withdraw its forces from all of south Lebanon. 
  The same is true with Syria. After more than two and a half 
years of the Washington talks, several shuttle tours by the U.S. 
secretary of state, the summit meeting between Presidents 
al-Asad and Clinton, and several statements by Israeli officials 
on their intentions to advance the peace process on the 
Syrian-Israeli track, it became clear that the Tel Aviv rulers 
reject full withdrawal from the Golan and the return to the 4 
June 1967 borders. At the same time, these rulers demand the 
normalization of relations. 
  When we compare Israel's behavior on the three Arab 
tracks--the Syrian, Jordanian, and Lebanese--we find one thing: 
the Tel Aviv rulers have not abandoned their expansionist 
demands in the Arab territories, and they are far from the 
substance of the U.S. initiative, the principles of the Madrid 
conference, and the UN resolutions, which call for exchanging 
land for peace and withdrawal to the 4 June 1967 borders. 
  Israel succeeded in singling out the Palestinian side and 
drawing it into the position Israel had planned. Israel kept 
its ugly occupation and its sway over the capabilities of the 
Palestinian people, but it failed to penetrate any of the three 
Arab tracks--the Syrian, Jordanian, and Lebanese. Syria, 
Jordan, and Lebanon clearly announced that separate agreements 
are unequivocally rejected, and that peace depends on Israel's 
full withdrawal and the return of all occupied territories. 
  It is important that Arab coordination continues to reach 
the 
highest levels because Israel is searching for even a tiny crack 
in order to propagate its suspicious and distorted solutions, 
especially since the Gaza-Jericho agreement is facing more 
difficulties everyday, and is daily confronting new obstacles, 
the latest of which is Israel's demand that the Palestinian 
police chase and arrest the men of the intifadah in order to 
hand them over. This simply means employing the Palestinian 
police to protect the occupation forces in accordance with this 
ill-auguring agreement. 
  A quick look at the situation in the occupied territories 
after the Gaza-Jericho agreement and its implementation is 
enough to clearly show that just peace and occupation cannot 
coexist and that the realization of peace is dependent on the 
elimination of occupation. Hence, Syria firmly adheres to the 
demand of Israel's full withdrawal from every inch of the 
occupied Golan, and coordinates its position with those of its 
Arab brothers so that the Israeli withdrawal will be from all 
occupied territories, and subsequently, peace will be just, 
comprehensive, and real.

<F P=106> [Speech by President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih at the al-Shuhada' </F>
Mosque in Sanaa--live] 
  [Text] Brother citizens, sons of our great Yemeni people, I 
congratulate you in my own name and on behalf of the brothers in 
the political leadership, represented by the Presidential 
Council, the House of Representatives, and the Council of 
Ministers, on the blessed 'Id al-Adha, and the fourth 
anniversary of Yemeni unity, which was declared on 22 May 1990. 
  I send our heartfelt congratulations from al-Shuhada' Mosque 
in the capital Sanaa to all the sons of our people and to the 
valiant personnel of the Armed Forces and the security forces 
while we are receiving two 'ids. The third 'id is the day of 
victory being achieved while martyrs fall on all military fronts 
and along all axes in a triumph for the will of our great Yemeni 
people against the forces of apostasy and secession. 
  At a late hour last night, we received the news, which we do 
not find strange, that the traitor, rebel, and deviant 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid has declared secession. He declared this in his 
own name, and forged facts by saying this was also in the name 
of the parliamentary bloc of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], 
the Democratic Republic of Yemen. He returned to the hateful 
past before 22 May 1990. He claimed he was for unity, and that 
the YSP is a unionist party, and that it will continue to be a 
unionist party. We know full well that they have nothing to do 
with unity. They sought unity unwillingly after the collapse of 
the socialist bloc, and after realizing that the sons of the 
eastern and southern governorates were suffering as a result of 
tyrannical totalitarian rule for 25 years, deteriorating 
conditions, the continuous power struggle, and the massacres 
that took place. I can recall that in 1981, when I went to 
Aden, when I also visited the Hadhramaut Governorate, fighting 
was at its peak in all the Republic's governorates, particularly 
in the central areas. I left here, Sanaa, for Aden, to ask the 
then leadership to restore Yemeni unity. At that time, 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid was in Hadhramaut. He was dismissed from the YSP 
leadership, its political bureau, the central committee, and the 
Yemeni people's presidium, as a result of his violation of the 
[word indistinct] law. We held talks in Hadhramaut, in the 
Saywun District. He said: Why have you come, brother 
president? I told him we came to request the restoration of 
Yemen's unity. He was the same man who came to receive us. He 
said: We cannot accept unity. You are a regime. We are 
another regime. You are a state. We are another state. We 
said we are one people who have the same language and who 
embrace the same Islamic religion. There are no sects or 
minorities in our Yemeni society. This is something I know about 
that retarded secessionist 'Ali Salim al-Bid. 
  When unity came and the Yemeni Republic was proclaimed and 
its flag was hoisted all over Yemen, and they were about to fall 
after the Socialist bloc collapsed, we signed the unity 
agreement and shared power with them. They took fifty percent 
of all basic components of power. We said this was the price of 
unity. We really shared power with them. The homeland started 
to suffer from this clique during the presence of the Socialist 
party in power. The party did not come to unity of its own 
volition. We are very well aware how they came to unity. 
  From the day it took power in the capital, Sanaa, this party 
began to weave one plot after another in the capital. It did 
not come to participate in and uphold its national 
responsibilities to build the state of law and order. It began 
its new plot by instigating parochialism, sectarianism, 
tribalism, and racism among the sons of Yemen, having stifled 
the voices of the good men, the strugglers and the 
revolutionaries in the southern and eastern governorates, and 
after bloody liquidations throughout the rule of that Socialist 
Party. It wiped out scientists, shaykhs, social figures, 
political and cultural figures. We know this very well. Our 
people are well-aware who the Socialist Party destroyed. There 
were mass graveyards. 
  The party arrived in the north, but our brothers in the 
north 
did not know the extent of the deception and treachery of the 
renegade leadership of the Socialist Party. They said they 
wanted to establish the state of law and order, that they had a 
civilized plan. The civilized plan began by sabotaging the 
national economy, plundering the nation's wealth on all levels, 
and destroying establishments with the hammer of Engineer Haydar 
al-'Attas, chairman of the Council of Ministers in the Yemeni 
Republic. This economic and financial destruction began. They 
used people's wealth and property for their own purposes. The 
people were witnessing and hearing. The people thought that, 
well, they may be indigent, let them take some money and be 
satisfied, and then begin construction. But they intended to 
destroy the national economy and spread corruption and anarchy 
in all state organizations. They disturbed security and 
displayed armed presence which disturbed every citizens. They 
said that they wanted a state of law and order. 
  You are aware that the highest-level leaderships have only 2 
to 3 guards, perhaps up to ten. Being exponents of a civilized 
plan, they wanted to end the armed manifestations. But, you 
always found that each member of the party leadership -- at 
least 15 individuals -- had from 100 to 150 armed men and from 
one to four vehicles, with armed men opening the doors of their 
vehicles, disturbing citizens, and driving with unbelievable 
speed in the streets. This is the civilized plan under the 
Socialist Party leadership. 
  How did the crisis begin and why? While we were performing 
'Id al-Adha prayers in al-Jabbanah on this day last year, the 
so-called al-Bid arrived. He was in an abnormal situation. 
Why? Because he did not attend or participate, along with the 
chairman of the presidential council, in the new government's 
swearing-in ceremony, the coalition government of the General 
People's Congress, the Reform Grouping, and the Socialist Party 
the previous evening. The people wondered why al-Bid had begun 
to fabricate the crisis. He said nobody invited him to the oath 
ceremony. The Constitution of the Republic of Yemen says the 
government shall take the constitutional oath in front of the 
chairman of the presidential council. During that period, he 
was not treated like the second-in-command or a presidential 
council member; we actually treated him as another undeclared 
president. Plotting began then. He began his suspect contacts 
to fragment and destroy the homeland.. 
  They destroyed the southern part of the homeland and the 
eastern governorates, as part of a scheme to destroy all the 
gains we managed to achieve in the northern governorates, by 
inciting all sectarian and regional feelings whenever possible. 
This was best proven by the weapons and hardware the security 
organizations seized in various parts of the Republic, including 
Sanaa. Weapons were stockpiled in more than 20 ladies' beauty 
salons, with the aim of destroying the capital. These included 
RPG's, mines, TNT bombs, and rockets. This is the cultural 
project of the Socialist Party leadership. The Socialist Party 
continued this policy and escalated the crisis day after day. 
  The dialogue committee was formed. We gave him more than 75 
percent of this committee's political speech for his cultural 
project. This document was signed in Amman as requested by the 
Socialist Party. I spoke to many brother politicians following 
'Ali Salim al-Bid's return to Aden. I told them this is an 
undeclared secession. Al-Bid's return to Aden was part of an 
undeclared secession plan. 
  Many politicians from the various political organizations 
and 
parties and a large number of Yemeni Socialist Party members 
said this party was established and brought up to be unionist 
and can never be secessionist; it is a unionist party. We told 
them undeclared secession is being practiced on the ground. 
Actually, he practiced and escalated one crisis after another. 
He sought not only to fragment the country into two parts, but 
to fragment Yemen into several countries. 'Ali Salim al-Bid's 
speeches returned through the news media to address the Yemeni 
people. This is 'Ali Salim al-Bid. 
  Late last night, he declared the name of the Democratic 
Republic of Yemen. Who gave him this right? What is its 
legality? This decision has no legality at all. This is an 
invalid decision made by a sick person suffering from 
schizophrenia. This decision is null and void. It was based 
mostly on the claim that most of the members of the 
parliamentary bloc of the southeastern governorates are in the 
capital, Sanaa. We, as well as our Armed Forces and Yemeni 
people, will never accept this secessionist decision and we will 
offer sons, our brothers, friends, and comrades-in-arms as 
martyrs, not for the sake of triumphing over the Socialist 
Party, but for the sake of triumphing for the will of this 
nation and preserving Yemeni unity. Politically, we will offer 
all we can on both the national and international levels to 
avert the continuation of war. 
  However, we announced a cease-fire at midnight to give the 
misguided ones of the Socialist Party leadership the opportunity 
to join constitutional legitimacy. 
  On this religious occasion and the national occasion we 
will celebrate tomorrow, that is, the fourth anniversary of the 
establishment of the Republic of Yemen, I repeat today that this 
anniversary and this unity will continue, God willing, 
regardless of price and circumstances. Our future policy will 
focus on removing the traces of financial and administrative 
abuse, corruption, and what we inherited from the behavior of 
the secessionist YSP leadership. We will rebuild and 
restructure the state on modern and developed bases. We will 
move in the direction of comprehensive development and toward 
the completion of the basic development structures and expansion 
of public services. Development has been frozen since the 
advent of Haydar al-'Attas and his assumption of the post of 
prime minister. He did nothing but loot the state budget. 
Every minister and official among them came only to loot all 
that existed in ministries and institutions. They did so 
deliberately in order to destroy institutions and the state's 
pillars. They wanted to destroy everything accomplished in the 
north so the situation would be similar to what they had done in 
the southern and eastern governorates. 
  The southern and eastern governorates were looking forward 
with hope and confidence to the Republic of Yemen, the state of 
unity, to security and stability, and to fulfilling the needs of 
their regions. However, the YSP leadership deliberately froze 
everything so the citizen or [word indistinct] can rise. This 
was done deliberately by the YSP leadership. 
  'Ali Salim withdrew. If he were a brave leader he would be 
in the beloved capital, Aden, and hold out before fighters. He, 
however, withdrew like a coward to Hadhramaut. He thinks he is 
the guardian of the southern and eastern governorates. I know 
what he means by his withdrawal to Hadhramaut. He does not want 
the south, but wants to establish the great Hadhramaut state. 
He thinks he is the guardian of Hadhramaut. Hadhramaut is more 
unionist than the sons of the capital, Sanaa. Hadhramaut is 
unionist down to the bone. Hadhramaut will not accept the 
trusteeship of the YSP and 'Ali Salim al-Bid. 
  The southern and eastern governorates are not with the YSP 
leadership. They, however, used to be under the iron fist of 
the YSP, which it practiced through strong administration and 
army and security forces, and not through good manners, 
integrity, and sacrifices for this nation. All it is offering 
them is devastation and destruction. By this announcement, the 
YSP thinks it will get their support. It will only get a loud 
cry from all unionists in the Yemeni homeland and unionists in 
the Arab and Islamic world that this is treason. What al-Bid 
did yesterday evening was greater than any other treason. 
  The Middle East Broadcasting Center [MBC] radio broadcast 
the news report before it was declared by 'Ali Salim al-Bid, as 
if it took the news report from 'Ali Salim al-Bid's pocket. It 
is an agreed upon and prearranged issue. The MBC radio carried 
the report before 'Ali Salim al-Bid said he would announce 
secession. He believes secession is legitimate and that it will 
be implemented. We will continue with our decision. We will 
not disavow it, that is, the 72-hour cease-fire. After 72 
hours, if al-Bid does not surrender and hand himself over to the 
nearest police station to face a just trial, fighting and 
shelling will continue against the secessionist elements 
supporting al-Bid and his gang, but not against the masses of 
our people in the eastern and southern governorates, for these 
are our sons, brothers, and children. We have no differences 
with any citizen. The existing war is not a war between north 
and south, but a war between the Yemeni Arab and Muslim people 
and an apostate, deviationist clique in the YSP leadership. 
  We would like to correct some concepts by some brothers in 
the Arab homeland. Regrettably, some biased news media describe 
the fighting raging as a war between the north and the south. 
It is a war between the one, united Yemeni people and a gang in 
the YSP leadership. The war will continue until victory, God 
willing, and until our Yemeni homeland is purged of this wicked 
gang. 
  'Ali Salim al-Bid and some YSP leaders believe the bloodshed 
is for secession. No, this blood is shed for the sake of 
entrenching and strengthening unity. Blood is not being shed to 
split Yemen, but to safeguard unity and to deepen its roots. 
  Dear free citizens, inside and outside the homeland: We must 
stand as one rank to support the heroic fighters and mujahidin 
on all axes, who are fighting on a 1,100-km long front, and who 
sacrifice their lives for the sake of security, stability, and 
prosperity, not for the sake of a party or parties, one person, 
or individual, or sides. At the same time, the misguided ones 
do not know who they are sacrificing their lives for. They are 
sacrificing their lives for the sake of a small gang in the YSP. 
  We are cerebrating the fourth anniversary of Yemeni unity. 
Our political program will be completely different from the 
previous program in which we were partners with the YSP, and 
through which we used to flatter some YSP leaders. We will 
restore tranquility to Yemeni society, entrench stability and 
security, achieve comprehensive and integrated development, and 
promote our country's relations with our neighbors, with the 
Arab world, and with the foreign world, within the framework of 
mutual interest and noninterference in our internal affairs and 
our political decision. This is because the YSP, since it was 
established, has been accustomed to being in someone else's 
arms. Some of the the YSP leaders were in the arms of British 
intelligence. They were raised on this. They were established 
by British intelligence. After Britain left south Yemen, the 
south of the homeland, the YSP moved into the arms of Soviet 
intelligence. Now, it is looking for another intelligence 
agency because it cannot live outside the arms of intelligence. 
It has no national decision at all. This is the YSP, the 
advocate of the civilized project, particularly the advocate of 
the state of law and order. 
  Congratulations to the masses of our people on these two 
occasions; the religious occasion, and the unity day occasion. 
Heartfelt congratulations to you and to the heroic mujahidin 
fighters on every mountain and plain. 
  To the heroes of the Armed Forces and Security, I say be 
confident that unity will survive. I wish you success and 
congratulate you on two national occasions, the national day and 
the 'Id al-Adha. 
  May God's peace and blessing be upon you.

<F P=106> [News conference by Presidential Council Chairman Lieutenant </F>
General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih with domestic and international 
correspondents and an unidentified moderator in Sanaa on 21 
May--recorded] 
  [Text] [Salih] First of all I would like to welcome the 
national, Arab, and international press. On behalf of the 
Yemeni people, we congratulate you on the occasion of the 
blessed 'Id al-Adha and the fourth anniversary of the Yemeni 
Republic. These days, our country is living through a 
regrettable war launched by certain separatist elements, led by 
the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] headed by traitor 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid, who returned to the black history before 22 May 1990 
when he announced late last night the official secession from 
the Yemeni body. He announced secession for his personal 
objectives and for the objectives of certain influential 
elements in the party. We would like to reassure our people, 
the good people and unionists in the world, and the masses of 
our Arab nation that unity continues and exists, and is backed 
by wide popular support all over united Yemen. Separation [word 
indistinct] only concerns individuals and a clique that includes 
certain elements in the YSP leadership. I welcome the press and 
the news agencies again, and I am ready to answer all questions. 
  [Sulayman Nimr, AL-HAYAH and BBC] Your Excellency the 
President, now after 'Ali Salim al-Bid and the YSP have 
announced their separation from the united Yemen, does this mean 
that the cease-fire will end? Will this mean that you will 
continue the battle to end the current situation in Aden? 
  [Salih] Yesterday we announced a decision by the 
presidential 
council, the speakership of the House of Representatives, and 
the council of ministers--in response to the demand of the 
unionist elements within the YSP and Arab and international 
efforts to end the war--to provide a chance for the rebels, led 
by the party, to surrender themselves to justice and to give a 
chance for those who were deceived in the Armed Forces and who 
were left under the authority of the YSP to return to legitimacy 
and to the army of unity, the army of unity and democracy, the 
army of the constitutional legitimacy. We issued this decree to 
cease fire for 72 hours, three days, in order to give them a 
chance. This decision was met with support from our brothers in 
the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the Arab Republic of Egypt, and the 
United States. However, YSP-led separatist elements did not 
respond to this decision and they continued the war on various 
fronts. This decision or decree stated that if those who hold 
sway over the YSP do not stop, the response will be firm. They 
did not stop. Regrettably, the battles continue. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Your Excellency the 
President: The entire Arab world is one body and Yemen is a 
part of it. President Husni Mubarak held numerous unpublicized 
contacts to close Arab ranks. [Words indistinct] Egypt's role 
and what is expected from it? 
  [Salih] Egypt is exerting itself and Brother President 
Mubarak urged the parties to cease fighting. We responded to 
the cease-fire call. The leadership held [word indistinct] and 
made a decision. We cannot do without Egypt's role; We have a 
soft spot for Egypt. Egypt has exerted itself to bring an end to 
the hostilities. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] [Words indistinct] Yemeni 
masses 
for civilian life to continue, and democracy, and political 
pluralism? [words indistinct] Yemeni expatriates around the 
world about what is actually happening in Yemen, and what is the 
future of Yemen [words indistinct]? 
  [Salih] First of all, the bulk of the Republic's territory 
is under the control of the army of constitutional legality, 
even the areas where the military has no presence are absolutely 
committed to Yemeni unity. We reassure our people, our Arab 
masses, and expatriates that, God willing, the secessionists 
will be defeated or arrested and brought to justice. They may 
seek to flee the country. 
  Yemen will see an extensive development program following 
the 
frustrations experienced by the Yemeni people in the southern 
and eastern governorates while under the control of the YSP when 
they and ourselves shared power after the proclamation of the 
Republic of Yemen. Then, instability, insecurity and lax 
bureaucracy and financial and administrative corruption were the 
order of the day. That was a deliberate policy on the part of 
the secessionist YSP leadership. The future of Yemen, God 
willing, promises to be one of security, stability, democracy, 
political party pluralism, and modern institutions. God 
willing, local government will be improved and there will be a 
greater degree of decentralization -- financial and 
administrative. Local governments will enjoy greater and wider 
powers throughout Yemen. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Many happy returns of the 'Id. 
I would like to begin by saying that, despite the political 
leadership's high credibility and the fact that news 
correspondents have been given the liberty to move directly to 
the field of action, reports carried by some agencies and radio 
stations do not reflect what is taking place in the Yemeni 
arena. [Words indistinct] credibility. What would Your 
Excellency the President like to tell these correspondents so 
that they will measure up to the trust placed in them by the 
political leadership that has allowed them freedom of movement? 
The second part of my question: We are not surprised by the 
secession. The secession was declared on the very day the 
merger was proclaimed. Evidence is found in the stockpiles of 
[word indistinct] divisionist weapons. This is not strange, 
coming from the gang that plotted secession from day one. But 
what is the link between the timing of the official declaration 
of secession and the remarkable successes scored by our Armed 
Forces, the forces of constitutional legality? Thank you, Your 
Excellency the President. 
  [Salih] Thank you. I mean [word indistinct] the beginning 
of the question. First, with regard to the world news agencies, 
press, and television stations, as well as the Arab and foreign 
television stations, we in fact regret the biased role played by 
some papers, news agencies, and television stations. 
  Perhaps, some foreign television stations take reports from 
some Arab television stations and newspapers, so the former 
stations did not follow up on the facts themselves in order to 
find out the actual situation. We, however, do not pay 
attention to certain distortions of positions and to the lack of 
credibility by some media. We pay attention to what takes place 
on the ground. We do not pay attention to what is said by 
certain radio stations, journalists, or television stations. We 
pay attention to our presence on the ground, to tightly 
controlling the Republic's territory, and to repulsing and 
expelling the secessionist elements. 
  [Correspondent] Your Excellency the President: The second 
part of the question is: What is the link between timing the 
official declaration of secession [word indistinct] moments, and 
[word indistinct] the great victories achieved by our Armed 
Forces, which are defending unity and legitimacy? 
  [Salih] The link is that victories were achieved on the 
ground. Thus, there was no room for al-Bid and the 
secessionists' clique but to officially declare secession 
because al-Bid is unable to confront the army of the people, 
unity, and legitimacy. He has officially declared secession at 
a time when he has actually seceded, but in an undeclared 
manner, since he returned from Washington to Aden. We, however, 
were not surprised by this issue because he had seceded in the 
first place. Moreover, he unwillingly joined unity, and he did 
not like unity. Representative of the YSP, al-Bid's political 
rhetoric said that it is the party of unionists. He, however, 
lost credibility regarding his party, himself, his homeland, and 
the Arab and foreign world. 
  They say that the YSP was established on unionist bases. How 
could this be true now that secession has been declared? Thus, 
where is this credibility? 
  [Unidentified moderator] May we give an opportunity to 
non-Arabs, please? 
  [Salih] Go ahead. 
  [Moderator in English] Come, non-Arabic speaking 
correspondents. 
  [Unidentified correspondent, in English] We already have 
indications that some Arab countries, and perhaps others as 
well, are prepared to give support to the declaration of 
independence by Mr. al-Bid. How worried are you about this, and 
what effect will it have on your objection so far to any form of 
negotiations [words indistinct] with Mr. (?al-Bid)? 
  [Salih] First of all, any Arab country or any friendly state 
that attempts to sympathize with this secessionist decision will 
be counted in the camp of the enemies of the people of Yemen. 
This is also considered flagrant interference in Yemeni affairs. 
  [Unidentified correspondent, in English] [words indistinct] 
So, after this truce, which will last for three days or so, do 
you intend to go only to Aden, to take over Aden or [words 
indistinct] 
  [Salih] We are now tightening the ring around Aden, the 
economic and commercial capital. After tightening the ring 
around Aden, our intention was not to enter the capital with the 
Army. But with 'Ali Salim al-Bid's announcement of secession 
and declaration that Aden is the capital of his party, we will 
have to enter Aden by any means necessary. Afterward, the Army 
will chase the remainder of the party's leadership in 
al-Mukalla. Thus, al-Bid will have to flee either to Oman or to 
(?al-Sharawrah) toward Saudi Arabia to join his secessionist 
colleagues living abroad. In fact, he and his colleagues have 
sent their children and families abroad as well as the fortunes 
they have accumulated from here and abroad. He will be forced 
to go after the funds he has deposited in banks abroad, funds he 
received as price for the crisis, and with which he ignited the 
war. He will run after the funds he managed to amass during 
this period. He has no cause, and if he did have a cause, he 
would have stood fast in Aden and would not have left Aden. As 
he left Aden for al-Mukalla, so will he leave al-Mukalla for 
outside Yemen. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] President Mubarak [word 
indistinct] the cease-fire during the 'Id. You responded to 
this. Al-Bid announced that he accepts the cease-fire but after 
that he announced secession? 
  [Salih] [Words indistinct] cease-fire announcement [words 
indistinct] but immediately after the cease-fire announcement, 
he proclaimed the secession. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, [words 
indistinct] 'Ali Salim al-Bid [words indistinct] 
  [Salih] For the second time, any recognition of this means 
that this country will be the direct enemy of the Yemeni people. 
  [Unidentified correspondent, in English] In light of the 
declaration of the separatist state, do you intend to continue 
the war in the next three days [words indistinct]? 
  [Salih] We said [words indistinct] cease-fire but the [words 
indistinct] did not stop fighting. This [words indistinct] 
forces us to pursue military operations. [words indistinct] for 
the information of the press, several of the units loyal to the 
YSP announced [word indistinct] yesterday after the secession 
decision [words indistinct] announced their loyalty to 
legitimacy. This was the ('Affan) Brigade, one of the most 
important brigades, the [word indistinct] Brigade, the Hunayshan 
Brigade, and the [word indistinct] Brigade announced their 
allegiance to legitimacy. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] [Words indistinct] regarding 
other political reactions [words indistinct] the YSP members 
[words indistinct]. What is their stand on the [words 
indistinct]? 
  [Salih] [Words indistinct] in the Yemeni arena, they 
condemned this decision. We demand condemnation [words 
indistinct]. They have conveyed to us their condemnation over 
the phone. Other parties [words indistinct] should condemn this 
secessionist decision through the press and electronic media. 
Most YSP leaders in Yemen, not only in the north, but in Yemen 
as a whole, support unity. Most of them have made their stands 
known. Perhaps statements will be issued by the YSP 
organizations in some governorates of the Republic. Some YSP 
leaders have submitted their resignations en masse. I have 
received their party cards and resignation letters from various 
governorates of the Republic. [words indistinct] this excellent 
unionist stand. Only 'Ali Salim al-Bid and those who stand to 
benefit from this situation among the leaders of the YSP have 
remained. Eventually, he will be left alone. 
  [Unidentified correspondent, in English] [Words indistinct] 
much longer [words indistinct]? 
  [Salih] This is up to the commanders in the field to decide. 
Our hope is that the battle will be decided within hours or 
days. However, we are facing the YSP war machine that once 
belonged to a member of the socialist bloc. After the 
declaration of the republic, particularly after the beginning of 
the crisis nine months ago, the YSP received double the quantity 
of the weapons that it inherited from the socialist bloc. We 
are facing difficulty, but we have taken approximately 80 
percent of their equipment. This includes what has been hit, 
surrendered, or seized. During the past 12 hours, we have 
received information that a number of strategic Tupolev planes 
are transporting a cargo at the al-Riyan airport in Hadhramaut, 
(?each carrying two tanks). There is also a vessel carrying a 
number of vehicles, ammunition, artillery, and tanks to the 
al-Mukalla port. From this premise, we warn all countries 
involved in this affair and that seek to prolong this battle. 
We warn against weapons sales, and the arrival of vessels to 
ports that fall under the control of the party, and aircraft 
that pass through Yemeni airspace, we warn against their 
arrival, and this will be viewed as blatant interference. This 
will prolong the battle. We warn all the friendly and fraternal 
countries against becoming involved in this matter to support 
this secessionist party as this will be viewed as blatant 
interference in Yemeni affairs. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] What role are regional 
countries 
playing in the Yemeni crisis? 
  [Salih] [Words indistinct] weapons from arms dealers. Arms 
sales are funded by the YSP, which has large amounts of money. 
Thanks again to the press and newsmen. Many happy returns.

our Yemeni people were experiencing in all sectors. [passage

  [Text] Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah this 
morning received his excellency the Russian Federation's 
ambassador. The ambassador stressed that the Russian Federation 
has supported Yemeni unity since its proclamation, for it 
embodies the ambitions of all Yemeni political and social forces 
and translates their aspirations for consolidating democratic 
values and (?professional) liberties. He said that the Russian 
Federation believed and continues to believe that constructive 
dialogue and political advancement within the framework of 
political pluralism is the ideal approach for bolstering Yemen's 
sovereignty and its international reputation. He said this 
approach is the best solution to all social and economic 
problems facing Yemen. He said that not on any level has Moscow 
considered the possibility of recognizing the new state in 
southern Yemen.

  [Text] The Yemeni Unionist Grouping Party has announced 
its rejection of the criminal al-Bid's proclamation of 
secession, calling it a catastrophe for the homeland. Brother 
'Umar al-Jawi, secretary general of the party, in a statement 
carried by AFP, termed al-Bid's secessionist decision a 
dangerous and catastrophic move. 
  Meanwhile, the Democratic Nasirite Party, the National 
Democratic Front, and the Socialist Nationalist Party, today 
came out strongly against the traitor al-Bid's declaration of 
secession. They emphasized that a rabid, bloody gang within the 
ranks of the Socialist Party afflicted with megalomania has no 
business determining the fate of the Yemeni people. They 
described this gang as a spiteful group with a black history of 
scheming against our people. 
  A joint statement issued by the three parties today said 
they, along with all the worthy and good Yemeni citizens, stand 
for keeping the Yemeni unity intact and take the side of its 
defenders. They place themselves, the statement added, at the 
disposal of the unionist leadership to defend the gains of the 
homeland -- unity and democracy. 
  Yemeni unity was made possible by the will of the entire 
people of the country and their sacrifices and struggles. The 
statement said the people will adhere to their unity for all 
time and urged all the honest and good forces to chase the 
secessionist gang and keep it from realizing a separatist scheme 
funded from across the border -- not even on a single inch of 
Yemeni territory. The three parties called on unionists and 
good citizens to give every support to the unionist leadership 
to safeguard this splendid, historic achievement. 
  Meanwhile, the three parties have cabled the brother 
chairman 
and members of the Presidential Council about their strong 
condemnation of al-Bid's secessionist move. Along with all our 
Yemeni people, the cable read, we are on your side as a symbol 
of unity and democracy and national sovereignty and legality.

  [Text] Djibouti, 21 May -- Radio Aden has broadcast a 
communique in which it called on countries of the world to 
recognize the republic declared in south Yemen today. 
  The communique included a call to sisterly and friendly 
states to recognize this republic declared by the 
secretary-general of the Yemeni Socialist Party, 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid, early today. 
  The radio, which is heard here, reiterated the announcement 
by al-Bid of the establishment of a provisional assembly for 
national salvation composed of 111 members which will undertake 
the task of selecting a chairman for the assembly, the chairman 
and the members of the presidential council, the formation of a 
provisional government and the declaration of the democratic 
republic of Yemen and the drawing of a permanent constitution 
for the country in accordance with the Document of Pledge and 
accord. 
  The radio said that the representatives of the people in the 
republic announced today that they will hold their meetings 
tomorrow, Sunday 22 May, at the headquarters of the house of 
representatives in Aden. 
  The secession communique announced by al-Bid noted that Aden 
would be the capital of the new republic whose religion would be 
Islam and in which the sole source of legislation would be 
Islamic shari'ah. The communique said that the new republic 
would be a part of the Arab Muslim nation, its political system 
would be based on political pluralism, and its constitution 
would be the same as the constitution of the Republic of Yemen.

<F P=106> ["Text" of statement issued by members of the Yemeni </F>
Socialist Party Central Committee; place and date not given] 
  [Text] Several leaders of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] 
Central Committee have issued a statement condemning the 
declaration of secession made by traitor al-Bid and stressing 
that this declaration is a retreat from our people's greatest 
and most important options of unity, democracy, and party and 
political pluralism. Following is the text of the statement: 
  We, along with our people, were surprised by the declaration 
of secession made by the secessionist elements in the YSP 
leadership. We, along with our people, realize that the YSP's 
elements, cadres, and many of its leaders reject, absolutely and 
in principle, this declaration, which does not express our 
party's spirit, principles, and lengthy struggle designed to 
effect both the September and October Yemeni revolutions and the 
Yemeni unity on great 22 May 1990. 
  The declaration of secession is a retreat from our people's 
greatest and most important options of unity, democracy, and 
party and political pluralism. We, as leading elements in the 
YSP and its Central Committee, condemn the declaration of 
secession. We also believe that abidance by the constitution 
and a return to dialogue are the only possible means to end the 
impasse facing our people as a result of the declaration of 
secession. 
  As leading elements in the YSP, we will hold further 
consultations with our party colleagues in order to take a final 
and decisive position on our relationship with the YSP. 
  This statement was signed by brothers 'Abd-al-Bari Tahir, 
'Abdallah Hamid al-'Ulufi, and 'Abdallah Baydar, members of the 
YSP Central Committee.

  [Text] The Executive Committee of the League of the Sons 
of Yemen Party has stated its commitment to all national 
constants -- national unity, democracy, and constitutional 
legality. 
  In a statement released today, the committee called the 
traitor al-Bid's declaration of secession a step without any 
basis in legality. In this move, al-Bid only speaks for himself 
and his renegade circle, which includes certain leaders of the 
Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]. The traitor al-Bid's measures are 
illegal, and the actions taken by him and his coterie amount to 
national treason, the statement added. 
  'Abd-al-Rahman al-Jifri [member of the League of the Sons of 
the Yemen Party who has allied himself with al-Bid] has brought 
about his dismissal from the party, having turned his back on 
the party's principles, rules, and bylaws. The statement 
emphasized that whoever fails to safeguard his citizenship in 
our united Yemen forfeits his membership in the League of the 
Sons of Yemen Party. The statement called on the party leaders 
and rank and file in all the Republic of Yemen's governorates to 
abide by the letter and spirit of the party's bylaws and to 
implement its executive committee instructions. 
  Meanwhile, the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, the Nasirite 
Popular Unionist Organization, the Yemeni Unionist Grouping 
Party, the Right Party, the Democratic Nasirite Party, the 
National Democratic Front, the Social Nationalist Party, the 
Leading Committee of the Fattah Corrective Stream inside the 
YSP, the Yemeni Socialist Party faction in the (?al-Maqwin) 
Governorate, the secretariat of the YSP in the Ibb Governorate, 
the Yemeni Human Rights Organization, the Yemeni Council for 
Peace and Solidarity, and the Disabled Society, have all 
denounced this criminal move on the part of the traitor al-Bid. 
They emphasized that this proclamation runs counter to the will 
of the people. They appealed to national public opinion and 
regional and world organizations to work to expose the plans 
seeking to discredit the homeland. They made plain that, far 
from mirroring the will of the YSP's rank and file, the decision 
only represents the secessionist gang led by al-Bid. 
  They emphasized that this secessionist step is illegal and 
that it violates the Republic of Yemen's Constitution on which 
the entire people of Yemen are agreed. They urged all popular 
forces to put up vigorous resistance to this band in the 
interest of safeguarding the homeland's unity, sovereignty, and 
territorial integrity. 
  The statement warned that any recognition of the 
secessionist 
regime by any country would amount to interference in the 
Republic of Yemen's domestic affairs and a blatant violation of 
international law.

  [Text] The Yemeni Renaissance Movement has declared its 
categorical and vigorous rejection of the historical crime of 
secession committed by the secessionist gang in the Yemeni 
Socialist Party [YSP]. The movement called the move high 
treason against God, the homeland, and the people. 
  In a statement it issued today, the Renaissance Movement 
emphasized that it supports the legal leadership as it defends 
Yemen's unity, and urged the unionists inside the YSP -- the top 
and lower echelons alike -- to speak out against this step and 
join a national effort to thwart that evil plan.

  [Text] Sanaa, May 20 (GNA) -- A Yemeni official source has 
denied reports from Aden saying that 1500 government soldiers 
had surrendered to secessionists in Karish fighting front. 
  The source said in statements aired by the Yemeni news 
Agency 
SABA' that there was no fighting in Karish area and that the 
fighting was raging in al-'Alam area, 20 km from Aden and near 
'Ataq, provincial capital of Shabwah. 
  The source reiterated that "al-'Anad base was in full 
control 
of government forces and that many of its troops had surrendered 
and some fled towards al-Hawtah, capital of Lahij Province." 
  South Yemeni television recently broadcast some pictures 
showing their forces control of al-'Anad base. 
  The source said "some targets in Aden, including its air 
base 
had become in reach of government forces shells and rockets. 
  The source said, "government forces had seized 60 modern 
tanks which rebels abandoned in the area between al-Hautah and 
al-'Anad."

  [Text] We have just received the following. A responsible 
source has stated the following: 
  In an attempt to cover up its shelling of residential 
quarters and hospitals in the capital, Sanaa, Ta'izz, 
al-Hudaydah, al-Rahidah, and other cities with Scud missiles -- 
whose use in wartime against civilians and civilian 
installations is prohibited -- the gang of apostasy and 
secession within the leadership of the Socialist Party has 
claimed that the two missiles that fell yesterday evening on 
Aden airport, which houses military targets and from which the 
warplanes under the control of the secessionist gangs take off 
daily to bomb the civilians and the members of our Armed Forces, 
hit the homes of citizens and caused damage to them, injuring 
some of their inhabitants. 
  We doubt such a false claim could fool anyone. And this will 
also not justify the ugly, heinous crimes of this gang, which 
will not be forgotten by our people. 
  Since this criminal gang ignited the fighting in Yemen, the 
forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy have abided by the 
orders of the brother chairman, Lieutenant General 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih, to ensure the safety of civilians and their 
property, no matter what crimes the secessionist gang commits 
against secure cities and defenseless civilians. The source 
said the Armed Forces do not possess Scud missiles, which the 
secessionists claimed that the forces protecting unity and 
legitimacy used in operations to hit Aden airport.

  [Excerpts] With God's assistance, and the determination of 
the heroic fighters defending our people's right to a free and

  Our heroic fighters, who are daily joined by hundreds and 
thousands of volunteers, have rushed to resist and abort all 
desperate attempts carried out by the hostile forces on all 
fronts. In the direction of Kharaz Bab al-Mandab, our Armed 
Forces, with effective and decisive support from our heroic 
eagles of the air, today engaged the hostile forces of the 
al-Ahmar gang and prevented them from occupying (al-Tahbub). 
They inflicted killing blows on these forces, forcing them to 
either retreat or surrender after sustaining heavy losses in 
lives and equipment. 
  In the direction of Harish al-Rahidah, our forces resisted 
with bravery and daring all desperate attempts made by the 
hostile forces to advance, and inflicted painful blows on them, 
which forced them to retreat and withdraw. Our brave forces 
there demonstratated that al-'Anad is truly obstinate. 
  In the Abyan sector, our forces continued to inflict strong, 
effective blows on the hostile forces, and made them suffer 
heavy losses. They also seized more military machinery and 
equipment.

  [Text] A responsible military source in the Defense 
Ministry has stated the following: 
  The forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy have 
continued their progress in the coastal region and accomplished 
the tasks assigned to them. These forces were able to reach 
Ra's 'Imran, west of the Salah-al-Din military camp in 
(al-Furayka') on schedule. 
  On the Lahij-Abyan axis, the Armed Forces units continued 
their progress, completing the operation of mopping up of all 
pockets of secessionist dens in Lahij Governorate. The forces 
of unity and constitutional legitimacy were able to capture 
three tanks and three artillery pieces in the northeastern areas 
of al-Hawtah. The forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy 
on this axis were a able to join hands with the other fighting 
forces on the Abyan axis. They established a new dimension for 
their advancing movement. The forces of unity and 
constitutional legitimacy were able to capture two T-62 tanks 
west of al-Harur and an armed cache containing large quantities 
of ammunition and military equipment. 
  On the Shabwah axis, the forces of unity and constitutional 
legitimacy have continued their advance toward the governorate's 
capital, Aden, realizing great successes in carrying out their 
duties. Our advancing forces toward the al-Mahfid, were able to 
continue their advance toward (al-Nakabah) and were able to 
destroy the first and second defense lines established by the 
elements of apostasy and secession in the (al-Nabbabah) area. 
They restored three tanks to the tanks of the forces of unity 
and constitutional legitimacy. 
  Continuing the implementation of their military missions to 
confront the gangs of rebellion and secession and their 
collapsing military dens, our heroes from the pilots of the Air 
Force carried out a number of combat missions, hitting all 
hostile targets. They destroyed two gunboats off the Abyan 
coast and a third off Ra's 'Imran coast. All planes returned 
safely to base. 
  Our air defenses were able to confront counterattacks by the 
air force of the forces of apostasy and secession, downing a 
MiG-21 plane within the Lahij-Abyan operations. They also 
downed a helicopter the day before yesterday on the Abyan-Aden 
axis. This axis is witnessing increasing activity of the forces 
of unity and constitutional legitimacy. In this axis, units of 
our Armed Forces are continuing their brave advance, defeating 
the forces of apostasy and secession, and destroying several 
vehicles and pieces of equipment after knocking them out.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the Ministry of Defense of the </F>
"Democratic Republic of Yemen" on 21 May; place not given] 
  [Text] Our heroic armed forces were surprised at 0600 this 
morning, 21 May 1994, the first day of the blessed 'Id al-Adha, 
by the continuing, barbaric shelling of the forces of the war 
General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih along the battlefronts, Abyan, 
Karish and Kharaz, in spite of the propaganda issued by the war 
general that he had given his instructions to cease fire 
effective noon Friday, 20 May, in response to the appeals 
addressed to him by a number of national figures, Arab leaders, 
and friendly countries. It is regrettable that the announcement 
was no more than empty (?words) to mislead the public. It also 
mislead those Arab leaders and some friendly countries who 
called for the cease-fire out of respect for these sacred days 
and to prevent further bloodshed of our innocent sons and brave 
armed forces who found themselves in a position where they had 
to defend themselves, the homeland, and the citizens on 
battlefields. They are now resisting with rare courage the 
forces of the war general 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih which direct 
blows against them and inflict on them horrible loss of life and 
equipment. These forces have begun to be defeated and are now 
fleeing in different directions leaving behind them hundreds of 
corpses and considerable war materiel, some pieces destroyed but 
others still serviceable. The Ministry of Defense and the 
armed forces wish to confirm their support for our people's sons 
in the southern and eastern governorates on the declaration of 
the Democratic Republic of Yemen announced by the militant 
patriotic leader 'Ali Salim al-Bid. They are ready to make 
sacrifices and protect the sacred land of this dear homeland 
with all that is precious against anyone who conceives of 
trifling with its security and stability. God give us success, 
he is our best friend and supporter.

  [Text] A responsible military source in the Democratic 
Republic of Yemen has said that the information being leaked by 
the news media of the bloody al-Ahmar gang in Sanaa which keeps 
(?misleading) Arab and international public opinion that the 
gang's forces have reached up to within view of the city of 
Aden, are untrue. The source said that it was not strange for 
the trumpets of this gang to continue the course of lies, 
misleading reports and deceptions with the objective of 
falsifying the realities at the battle fronts and concealing its 
defeats and its enormous human and material losses. 
  The responsible military source in the Democratic Republic 
of 
Yemen recalled the obvious and scandalous contradictions in the 
statements issued by the dictator 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, head of 
the ruling gang in Sanaa, in his press conference held this 
morning when he pointed out that his forces had destroyed 80 
percent of the weapons and machinery of our steadfast armed 
forces. At the same time, he admitted his inability to 
determine the outcome of the battle quickly because of what he 
called the existence of a huge military arsenal belonging to our 
forces. The responsible military source ridiculed the 
misleading information given by the ruler of Sanaa that three 
brigades in Shabwah had surrendered. The military source 
pointed out that had this claim been true then the forces of the 
ruling gang would have occupied Shabwah in its entirety where 
the brigades which the war general claimed had surrendered to 
him were based. He is seeking imaginary gains which have been 
difficult for him to achieve in the battlefields due to the 
steadfastness of our armed forces and the masses of the people 
which supported them and out of their conviction in the justice 
of their right to life. 
  The responsible military source in the Democratic Republic 
of 
Yemen has reiterated that the misleading media reports of the 
dictator, the dictator of Sanaa, are tantamount to confused 
dreams and that the road to Aden is a very long and thorny one. 
It will be the graveyard of the new invaders before their 
delusions can touch proud Aden.

  [Text] Aden, Yemen, May 22 (AFP) -- A missile believed to 
have been fired by north Yemen forces slammed into an eastern 
district of Aden early Sunday killing two people and wounding 
three others, rescue workers said. 
  The missile fell on a house in the Khormaksar district 
causing widespread damage and cutting electricity supplies to 
the area. 
  All the casualties were from the same family, ambulance 
crews 
said. 
  The attack was the first missile strike on Aden since the 
proclamation 24 hours ago of an independent state in the south 
in what used to be the Marxist republic of South Yemen. 
  Two Scud missiles fell on the port city overnight Thursday 
as 
fighting raged between the northern troops of President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih and southern troops backing former 
vice-president 'Ali Salim al-Bid. 
  The attack came two hours after a five-man presidential 
council was officially named to head the southern independent 
state proclaimed overnight Friday by al-Bid, the leader of the 
Yemeni Socialist Party, the reformed ex-ruling party in South 
Yemen. 
  The north and south, which united four years ago Sunday, 
have 
been embroiled in a civil war since May 4.

<F P=106> [Interview with Brigadier General 'Abd-al-Malik 'Ali </F>
al-Sayyani, chief of the Armed Forces General Staff, by 
correspondent Mahmud al-Warraq; place and date not given-- 
recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Al-Warraq] Let us talk about 
the military situation at the front. 
  [Al-Sayyani] As you know, the fighting is proceeding well 
and 
is moving toward a resolution in favor of the constitutionally 
legitimate authorities. The forces have made noticeable 
progress on various lines along an approximately 1,000-km-long 
front, breaking the secession barrier forever; and they are now 
near Aden City and are tightening the blockade of the city. 
Forces in the east are at the gates of 'Ataq city, seeking to 
gain final control over Shabwah Governorate. Other forces also 
are advancing toward their targets steadily. 
  [Al-Warraq] What about the other side's claims? 
  [Al-Sayyani] The actual situation on the battlefield answers 
their claims and falsifications. 
  [Al-Warraq] If you were to address your forces, what would 
you say? 
  [Al-Sayyani] God willing, victory is close. We will defeat 
the forces of apostasy and secession that are trying to harm the 
brightest aspect of our Arab situation, Yemeni unity, and they 
will not be allowed to achieve their aims. 
  [Al-Warraq] How long will this take? 
  [Al-Sayyani] The time will be decided by the battle and the 
field situation. [passage omitted]

  [Text] A responsible military source at the Defense 
Ministry has stated the following: 
  As the masses of our Yemeni people were rejoicing at the 
announcement issued by the joint meeting of the presidential 
council, the speaker of the House of Representatives, and the 
Council of Ministers to consider the day of the blessed 'Id 
al-Adha, the fourth national anniversary of the restoration of 
unity and the establishment of the Republic of Yemen, and the 
days that follows [21-23 May] as days for peace during which 
military operations against the rebellious secessionist gang in 
the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] leadership will be suspended in 
honor and appreciation of both the meaning of these two 
occasions and the sanctity of religious rituals and also in 
response to the calls by the unionists and a number of Arab 
leaders to give a new opportunity to the misled and helpless 
ones to return to the path of justice, unity, democracy, and 
constitutional legitimacy and to declare their rejection and 
confrontation of the secessionist conspiracy; and as our valiant 
Armed Forces, the forces of unity and legitimacy, were abiding 
by both that announcement and the instructions of the higher 
political and military commands to suspend all military acts, 
they were surprised by the flagrant hostile escalation by the 
forces of rebellion and secession, who opened fire with a 
variety of weapons and launched air raids in criminal acts 
coordinated with the treacherous, invalid crime of secession 
only two hours after the chance for peace was announced. 
  This prompted all Armed Forces units to implement what was 
stipulated in the announcement -- that military breaches by the 
gang of rebellion and secession will be replied to. They took 
measures to confront these hostile acts, thus the military 
confrontation continued even after the last veil fell off the 
faces of secessionists led by the rebellious traitor al-Bid. 
  The heroes in our Armed Forces' air defense units managed to 
down one aircraft belonging to the gang of rebellion and 
secession in Habil al-Jabr on the Lahij-Abyan axis. Our Armed 
Forces units acting on that axis also seized 15 tanks, four 
BM-21 Katyusha vehicles, 15 vehicles and BTR armored personnel 
carriers, five fuel and water (?pickups). They also seized 
warehouses containing large quantities of military ammunition 
and hardware. 
  At dawn yesterday, and only a few hours after the futile 
secessionist announcement and the emergence of the truth about 
the allegations and lies of the forces of rebellion and 
secession in the YSP leadership, several military brigades under 
the hegemony of the secessionist gang announced they were 
joining the ranks of the unity and constitutional legitimacy and 
their rejection of the destructive, treacherous calls for 
secession. The commander, as well as some officers, NCO's, and 
soldiers from the 22d Brigade announced their rejection of the 
crime of secession and that they were returning to the trench of 
defending unity, democracy, and constitutional legitimacy. 
  On the Shabwah axis, the heroes of our valiant Armed Forces 
were able to confront attacks by the secessionist, rebellious 
forces and inflicted heavy losses on them. In the name of God, 
the merciful, the compassionate: If ye will aid [the cause of] 
God, He will aid you, and plant your feet firmly. [koranic 
verse]

One missile fell on the populated areas of Khawr Maksar killing 
whole families. Many citizens in the populated Sa'adah area 
were seriously wounded. Only two days ago, the city of Aden was 
subjected to similar barbaric attacks in that same area. Aden

  [Excerpt] A responsible military source at the armed forces 
command in the Democratic Republic of Yemen has denied what has 
been reported by the French news agency. The agency, quoting a 
military spokesman in Sanaa, said that the forces of the 
al-Ahmar gang shot down a southern aircraft over the Abyan area. 
The source also denied that the northern forces had seized any 
equipment or war materiel in this governorate. The source said 
that the forces of the adventurous al-Ahmar gang in the 
Governorate of Abyan were not in a position to shoot down 
aircraft or seize any other military equipment. What was 
reported was no more than cheap media reporting and feverish 
psychological warfare. [passage omitted]

  [Text] A responsible military source at the command of the 
armed forces of the Democratic Republic of Yemen has said that 
the forces of the adventurous al-Ahmar gang not only failed to 
adhere to the cease-fire announced on evening of 20 May, but had 
in fact escalated the fighting on all fronts. It unleashed 
large forces in all directions. More serious than this, it used 
rockets in its criminal acts. 
  Last night, the inhabitants of the quiet and peaceful city 
of 
Aden, which was celebrating the declaration of the Democratic 
Republic of Yemen and the blessed 'Id al-Adha, were surprised by 
a rocket which fell in a heavily populated area killing and 
wounding peaceful women and children. Meanwhile, the air 
defense forces of the Democratic Republic of Yemen succeeded in 
shooting down a similar rocket in the air. 
  The responsible source confirmed that this was a criminal 
act 
and was part of the series of the terrible crimes of the family 
of al-Ahmar, under the leadership of war general 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih. 
  The armed forces of the Democratic Republic of Yemen reserve 
for themselves the right to retaliate forcefully against these 
stupid and crazy acts of the bloody al-Ahmar gang.

  [Text] Sanaa, May 22 (AFP)--Northern forces on Sunday 
captured the southern military base at 'Ataq, the capital of the 
oil- producing province of Shabwah, a military spokesman said 
here. 
  "All of the base's facilities are in the hands of the legal 
(northern) forces," the spokesman told the north's official 
SABA' news agency. 
  The northern forces, loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih, 
also shot down a southern MiG 21 fighter plane above Shabwah and 
"seized large quantities of weapons and munitions in storage 
areas in the province." 
  "Shabwah's citizens actively contributed to the success of 
the legal forces," the spokesman said. 
  In Lahaj Province to the west of Aden and Abyan Province to 
the east, northern forces "cleaned up several pockets of 
resistance," the spokesman said. 
  "Large quantities of weapons were seized" during these 
operations, including an abandoned helicopter, he said. The 
north's air force has continued "to carry out its missions, 
hitting targets with precision." 
  The claims could not be independently verified. 
  Before the war broke out on May 5 the areas of Shabwah and 
Masilah produced 140,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd), 
accounting for almost all of the south's output. Another 
195,000 bpd is produced in the northern Ma'rib region.

  [Text] A responsible source at the Defense Ministry has 
stated the following: 
  With the help of Almighty God, and the courage and 
dedication 
of the heroes in the Armed Forces, the heroic fighters in the 
forces of unity and the protectors of constitutional legitimacy, 
have continued to fulfill the combat duties assigned to them in 
confronting the forces of rebellion and secession on all axes 
and sectors. In the eastern, Shabwah axis, the valiant Armed 
Forces units managed to capture the military base and the 
central axis command headquarters in the city of 'Ataq, the 
capital of the governorate. Thus, the Shabwah Governorate, with 
all its districts and all its military installations, is now in 
the hands of constitutional legitimacy. A Mig-21 was downed in 
the ('Aqibat 'Arad) and a large quantity of weapons, vehicles, 
and military equipment, including all military depots in the 
governorate, was seized. 
  The loyal brother citizens and their courageous stand 
alongside the forces of constitutional legitimacy played a key 
role in these major achievements. The people greeted the Armed 
Forces with open hearts and feelings of happiness in all 
districts, expressing their absolute support for unity and 
constitutional legitimacy, and taking part in action alongside 
their great national Army, which is capable of defeating the 
secessionists and their supporters. 
  On the Abyan-Lahij axis, the forces of unity and 
constitutional legitimacy continued their heroic and brave 
tasks. They purged a number of defeated secessionist pockets, 
making real advances and inflicting on the forces of apostasy 
and secession major losses in hardware, weapons, and vehicles. 
  The units of the forces of unity and constitutional 
legitimacy also managed to seize large quantities of arms and 
military hardware, including a helicopter that was lying intact 
after its crew had fled. The forces of unity and constitutional 
legitimacy are continuing to execute their combat tasks. 
  In the same direction, the pilot heroes of the Armed Forces 
have continued to accomplish the tasks assigned to them. They 
hit these targets with great success and accurate effectiveness. 
The secessionist traitors will reap the harvest of their 
actions. 
  In their name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. If ye 
will aid the cause of God, he will aid you and plant your feet 
firmly. [koranic verse]

  [Excerpts] Kuwait, 23 May (KUNA) -- Radio Sanaa has 
reported that northern troops have managed to control Shabwah 
Governorate and its districts which are rich with oil and that 
they are advancing to the southern part, which declared 
secession from Yemen last Saturday. Radio Sanaa, which is 
received here, quoted a military source as saying that the 
northern troops in the eastern Shabwah axis have captured the 
military base and the central axis command headquarters in the 
city of 'Ataq, the capital of the province, with all its 
districts and all its military installations. These reports, 
which are considered an important development that would deprive 
the southern part of its important military and economic 
resources, have not been confirmed. [passage omitted] 
  The military source said that northern troops have seized a 
large quantity of weapons, ammunition, and military depots in 
Shabwah Governorate. [passage omitted] 
  A southern military spokesman today denied reports that 
'Ataq 
military base, the capital of Shabwah Province, has fallen to 
northern forces. Aden radio, received here, quoted the 
spokesman as saying that northern troops are not in control of 
Shabwah Province, and that the news announced by Sanaa is 
totally unfounded. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Aden, May 23 (AFP)--A southern military spokesman 
denied Monday that northern Yemeni forces had captured a key 
base at 'Ataq, capital of the oil-producing province of Shabwah. 
  The claim by forces loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih 
was "totally unfounded, the spokesman told television in Aden, 
capital of the breakaway state headed by southern leader 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid. 
  A military spokesman in the capital Sanaa told the official 
SABA' news agency on Sunday that the 'Ataq base had fallen to 
government troops. 
  Northern forces also said they had been in control of 
another 
southern military base at al-'Anad since Friday and had now 
surrounded the southern stronghold of Aden. 
  'Ataq lies 130 kilometers (78 miles) east of Aden.

issues 
and situations.

  [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
chairman of the Presidential Council and supreme commander of 
the Armed Forces, yesterday, Saturday, chaired a joint meeting 
of the Presidential Council, the Speakership Council of the 
House of Representatives, and the Council of Ministers. The 
conferees discussed the latest developments in the secessionist 
plot engineered and executed by the rebellious separatists in 
the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] leadership against unity, 
democracy, and Constitutional legitimacy in the country. The 
conferees also discussed the blatant and escalating treasonous 
stand of the so- called 'Ali Salim al-Bid -- the war criminal 
and enemy of unity, democracy, and Constitutional institutions 
-- who has finally revealed his real nature and the reality of 
his destructive intentions and illegitimate ambitions. These 
were revealed in his secessionist declaration, which is based 
solely on his grudge against the people and his plot against 
their unity. 
  Only two hours after the people rejoiced over the 
declaration 
of the three-day peace made yesterday by the joint meeting of 
the Presidential Council, the Speakership Council of the House 
of Representatives, and the Council of Ministers on the occasion 
of the blessed 'Id al-Adha and the fourth anniversary of the 
Republic of Yemen, in response to the call of the YSP unionists 
and a number of Arab leaders, and to give the misled and 
helpless people an opportunity to declare their clear principled 
stand against the secessionists and in support of unity and 
Constitutional legitimacy; following a review of the treacherous 
stands adopted by secessionist elements that were accompanied by 
premeditated violations of the call for peace and continued 
attacks by the secessionist gang on the units of our Armed 
Forces, the forces of unity protecting Constitutional 
legitimacy; and in light of the steps and events that would 
result, the conferees adopted a group of sovereign and 
Constitutional decisions aimed at protecting unity and democracy 
and pooling all efforts in the holy national war. 
  The joint meeting of the Presidential Council, the 
Speakership Council of the House of Representatives, and the 
Council of Ministers issued the following statement: 
  In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. In 
light of these very delicate and important circumstances through 
which our Yemeni homeland is passing; in the course of 
confrontation against the challenges facing the national 
constants on which society is based and to which the Republic of 
Yemen adheres, particularly the Constitutional principles and 
the dear national achievements of the people -- the dearest of 
which are unity and democracy -- the joint meeting firmly 
reiterates that the Yemeni people, particularly the Armed 
Forces, the Security Forces, and all Constitutional 
institutions, will confront all serious plots aimed at 
encroaching on their unity or tampering with their national 
choice. 
  Our Yemeni people, who offered great sacrifices to achieve 
unity, are always ready to offer more sacrifices to safeguard 
this great historic achievement. Our lofty Yemeni people, who 
foiled the attempts to create a new secessionist reality in the 
homeland, under the slogan of the fabricated crisis raised by 
traitor 'Ali Salim al- Bid, can also bury his miserable 
secessionist declaration, which was born dead and which came as 
the rebellious secessionists were dying. They will face their 
destiny, thanks to the steadfastness of our Yemeni people and 
their rallying around their legitimate leadership and their 
brave Armed Forces. 
  This declaration is considered by every Constitutional, 
legal, and political criteria as high treason. It will not go 
unpunished. It is considered a violation of the Constitution of 
the Republic of Yemen and a departure from the collective will 
of the people who declared their unionist word on 22 May 1990 
when they said yes to the Constitution of the Republic of Yemen, 
to unity, and to democracy, in the public referendum of 15 May 
1991. 
  While we underline these facts, we urge all sons of our 
struggling people to rally behind the ranks of eternal unity and 
stand in the trenches to defend and preserve that unity. We 
urge them to sacrifice everything they hold dear and to pool all 
available resources and energies to ensure that popular efforts 
are coordinated with military operations to ensure results as 
soon as possible and at the least possible cost. 
  We are confident that our people and all their political, 
social, and cultural forces -- including the ulema, thinkers, 
shayks, intellectuals, merchants, workers, students, youth, men, 
and women -- will set the most splendid examples in this eternal 
national confrontation of a serious threat to their single 
existence, their independent political entity, and their shining 
civilized fate. 
  In this regard, and because we appreciate and value all the 
previous positions of the fraternal and friendly states with our 
people, and their unity and democratic march, we are certain 
that they will not continue to deal with the gang of rebellion 
and secession, especially after its secessionist trend was 
confirmed in practice. Consequently, any kind of dealing by any 
party with the traitor 'Ali Salim al-Bid and his declaration of 
secession is considered an act against the Yemeni people and 
flagrant and rejected intervention in the Republic of Yemen's 
internal affairs. All Constitutional authorities in our country 
have the right to deal with such an act in the appropriate 
manner. 
  In a spirit of sincere brotherhood and with the feelings of 
noble tolerance that live in the hearts of all Yemenis; and with 
a substantive, deep view of the requirements of logic and a deep 
faith in the one country and in the loyalty and tolerance of all 
of its children, we urge all unionists in the Socialist Party, 
all those deceived by the rebellious secessionists, and all 
those living under the tyranny of these criminal, secessionist 
gangs to take swift, clear, and decisive positions on the side 
of the people, their unity and Constitutional legitimacy, and 
its institutions, which are based on the will of the people and 
which were established according to the people's free and 
democratic choice. 
  Out of concern for them and out of respect for the principle 
of participation, we urge them to shoulder the national 
responsibilities and reject any further killings, and to help 
break the circle of destruction of the people's resources and 
energies, for which the adventurous secessionists show no 
concern. Al-Bid's statement confirms their destructive and 
bloody intention. Here, we stress with all confidence and 
growing ability that our Yemeni people, and all their united 
forces and segments, particularly in the Armed Forces and the 
security agencies, are able to (?raise higher) the word of the 
people, which stems from the words of God, and to champion the 
people's free will to protect unity, preserve Constitutional 
legitimacy, and protect security and stability under the lofty 
banners of the Republic of Yemen.

  [Text] Sanaa, May 21 (AFP)--Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih called off a ceasefire on Saturday and vowed that his 
northern forces would capture the key port city of Aden after 
his southern rivals declared an independent state. 
  Salih told a press conference at the presidential palace 
that 
fighting had raged on after southern forces ignored a three-day 
truce the north declared late Friday. 
  Southern troops were still fighting so "there is no 
ceasefire," he said. 
  "We already said we were adhering to the ceasefire but the 
separatist forces initiated fighting on all war fronts this 
morning, so fighting is going on." 
  The president added: "We are now putting a military ring 
around Aden," the former capital of Marxist South Yemen, which 
united with conservative North Yemen four years ago. 
  "After putting this ring around Aden our intention was not 
to 
enter the city. However, after the announcement of separation 
by the south we are obliged to enter the city at all costs." 
  He added: "Then the armed forces will continue to pursue the 
separatists in al-Mukalla," a port east of Aden where his 
southern rival Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid reportedly moved 
his base earlier this week. 
  The northerners have been battling to reach Aden all week, 
but had earlier said they would only blockade the city but not 
enter it, and promised not to harm the civilian population of 
more than 500,000. 
  The north had announced the ceasefire for the Moslem feast 
of 
'Id al-Adha (sacrifice), which starts on Saturday. 
  Asked how long the war, now in its third week, would last, 
Salih said: "This decision can be made only by commanders in the 
field. We hope it would end as soon as possible." 
  "We are facing the war machine of a former state which was a 
member of the socialist bloc, armed to the teeth," he said. 
  But he added that Bid's army had lost 80 percent of its 
equipment since the start of the conflict on May 5. He charged 
that two Tupolev transport planes had arrived at al-Mukalla 
airport and another ship was unloading military hardware at the 
city's port. 
  "These aircraft and ships will be considered as the enemy," 
he warned. 
  He said a number of southern units had "declared loyalty to 
the legitimate authority after they heard the declaration of 
separation," especially the powerful 'Abbas brigade in the oil- 
producing province of Shabwaho. 
  Several members of al-Bid's Yemen Socialist Party had also 
assured him of their loyalty. 
  "Al-Bid has no cause," he said. "If he had a cause he would 
have stayed in Aden, now he has escaped to al-Mukalla. 
  "Al-Bid will eventually have to run away to Oman or Saudi 
Arabia. He will eventually have to join his separatist 
colleagues living abroad. In fact, he has already sent away his 
family." 
  Asked about possible support from other Arab countries for 
al- Bid, Salih said: "Any Arab country or friendly state which 
may try to sympathise with this position puts itself in the rank 
of the enemies of the Yemeni people." 
  "This would represent a flagrant interference in Yemen's 
internal affairs," he said.

  [Text] Lieutenant General brother 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
chairman of the Presidential Council, last night held telephone 
contacts with Saudi King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, custodian of 
the two holy mosques; His Highness Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al 
Nuhayyan, president of the fraternal United Arab Emirates; 
struggler Yasir 'Arafat, president of the fraternal State of 
Palestine; Hafiz al- Asad, president of the fraternal Syrian 
Arab Republic; and Liamine Zeroual, president of the fraternal 
Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria. 
  During these contacts, the leaders exchanged congratulations 
on the blessed 'Id al-Adha. Our country's relations with each 
of these leaders' country were also discussed. 
  The brother president briefed his brother leaders on the 
current developments in the Yemeni arena in light of traitor 
['Ali Salim] al-Bid's action against his Yemeni homeland and the 
Arab nation of announcing secession, which only represents 
himself and the small gang of the [Yemeni] Socialist party [YSP] 
that conspires against the Yemeni homeland, unity, people, and 
their democratic approach. 
  The president said that all the sons of our people in all 
the 
Yemeni governorates reject this crime and adhere to unity and 
democracy. They will continue to strongly defend and protect 
them from all plots and plotters, and to sacrifice all that is 
dear for their sake. He also said the masses of our Arab nation 
also reject this crime because they view the Yemeni unity as an 
important step on the road to achieving the pan-Arab objective 
of establishing comprehensive unity among the sons of the Arab 
nation. 
  The president expressed appreciation for the stands of the 
Arab brothers who have always been concerned about Yemeni unity 
and about supporting the Yemeni people's march under the banner 
of the Republic of Yemen, whose fourth anniversary is being 
celebrated by our people. 
  Another telephone contact was held last night between 
Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the 
Presidential Council, and his brother Colonel Mu'ammar 
al-Qadhdhafi, leader of the 1 September Revolution in Libya. 
  They exchanged congratulations on the blessed 'Id al-Adha 
and 
the current developments in our country in light of the crime of 
secession committed by traitor al-Bid. 
  The Libyan leader said he was very upset because of the 
current serious developments which threaten the march of the 
Yemeni unity. He also reiterated his support for the Yemeni 
unity and that of the Libyan people's support for the Yemeni 
people to safeguard the Yemeni unity, considering it a pan-Arab 
gain for the Arab nation and an advanced step on the road of 
achieving the comprehensive unity.

  [Text] The Leading Committee of the Fattah Corrective 
Stream [al-lajnatu al-qiyadiyatu litayyar fattah al-tashihi] in 
the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] has sent a cable to Lieutenant 
General brother 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the 
Presidential Council, on the occasion of the blessed 'Id al-Adha 
and the fourth anniversary of the Republic of Yemen. The cable 
stressed that the committee adheres to the unity of Yemen in 
that it rehabilitates the history of the country. It stated its 
rejection of the secessionist step taken by the traitor 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid and his secessionist gang, and called for purging 
the country of this rotten band. The cable said that far from 
echoing the grass roots opinion in the YSP, the decision only 
speaks for the secessionist gang led by al-Bid. The Leading 
Committee of the Fattah Corrective Stream in the YSP appealed to 
the brother chairman and members of the Presidential Council to 
take a determined stand against this separatist step which aims 
to take the Yemeni people back to the era of division and to 
kill democracy. 
  The committee emphasized that it is taking the side of 
constitutional legality and its courageous forces as they stand 
up to the gang of apostasy and secession inside the YSP.

  [Text] The brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid, secretary general of 
the Yemeni Socialist Party's [YSP] Central Committee, addressed 
a speech to the masses of the Yemeni people on the occasion of 
the blessed 'Id al-Adha in which he stressed that Yemen was 
facing oppression, tyranny, and an unjust war. 
  He said that a catastrophe has befallen Yemen and we have 
done everything we could to avoid it, but the tyrants have 
decided to impose it on us. If they have succeeded in imposing 
the war on us, they will not, and they cannot, impose surrender 
on us by their whims, desires, and shortsightedness. 
  The brother 'Ali Salih al-Bid pointed out that on the 
occasion of the blessed 'Id al-Adha, on the day when the 
pilgrims stand on Mount Arafat, we appeal to God, the Great and 
Almighty. We stand with our heads held high. We refuse tyranny 
and oppression and we refuse to surrender. 
  He said that nothing other than what God has ordained would 
befall us. We would face the injustice, irrespective of the 
hands. [sentence as heard] Our belief would increase and we 
would overstep this ordeal and show resistance similar to that 
shown on the battlefield. Though the criminal gang has 
dispatched all its forces to destroy the towns and besiege Aden, 
it did not succeed in achieving anything. If they managed to 
enter some areas, they have entered them as invaders and 
occupiers. 
  The brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid expressed his confidence that 
the masses of our people could respond to the occupation and 
invasion, in the same manner as they confronted the Middle East 
base before independence in Aden. 
  He called upon our courageous soldiers and brave strugglers 
to make a single stance and to adhere closely to God and the 
homeland and to the principles of the September and October 
revolutions which we have absorbed. May God, the Great and 
Almighty, enforce the right and defeat the rabble tyrants who 
refuse to accept a cease-fire even during these sacred days and 
on the day of the standing on Mount Arafat.

  [Excerpt] Damascus, 22 May (MENA)--Former south Yemeni 
President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad received a telephone call from 
'Ali Salim al-Bid, secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist 
Party, who urged him to return to Aden and assume the post of 
the first vice president of the Democratic Republic of Yemen, 
which was announced in south Yemen yesterday. 
  'Ali Nasir Muhammad expressed his total rejection of the 
idea 
of secession and asked al-Bid to change his mind about 
establishing a state in south Yemen and to search for a solution 
within the framework of Yemeni unity. 
  In a statement to the MENA correspondent in Damascus, 'Ali 
Nasir Muhammad said he was ready to play a new mediation role to 
solve the crisis within this framework and to return to Yemen 
within 48 hours. However, the decision to secede and the 
subsequent developments have prevented him from conducting this 
mediation. 
  'Ali Nasir Muhammad warned that the secession decision will 
not solve Yemen's problem but will complicate it further, lead 
to a series of new conflicts, and partition Yemen into small 
entities and states. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Political Bureau of the Yemeni Socialist Party 
[YSP] has issued a statement on the occasion of the blessed 'Id 
al-Adha feast. The statement pointed out [words indistinct] 
Arab and Islamic peoples were celebrating with joy and high 
hopes and Muslims everywhere were exchanging greetings on this 
occasion. Yet the war criminal 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih was 
determined to send 'Id greetings in his own special way: instead 
of peace and security, he killed the children's joy. 
  The statement added that 'Ali 'Abdullah Salih has stubbornly 
challenged the national, Arab, and international will to stop 
the war. Thus, he has confirmed his satanic inclinations and 
his desire to destroy everything beautiful. 
  The statement also said that a number of towns and villages 
in the southern governorates have been the target of random and 
barbaric shelling. War criminal 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih has pushed 
thousands of innocent people from certain areas into the 
crematoria of death. He ordered soldiers to kill each other and 
tanks and airplanes to destroy installations in villages and 
towns. He has also robbed the country's wealth and has filled 
the prisons with innocent people. 
  The Political Bureau expressed appreciation for the Arab 
leaders' stances and for their desire to end the fighting in 
Yemen. It also held 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and the al-Ahmar 
family responsible for (?continuing) the war. 
  The Political Bureau hailed the heroic achievements of our 
armed forces against the attacks. It also greeted people in all 
the republic's governorates on the occasion of the advent of the 
blessed 'Id al-Adha feast.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Excerpt] The command of God has been delivered, so don't 
be too persistent. This is what we tell the gang of apostasy 
and secession. This is because the announcement of secession 
made by the traitor 'Ali Salim al-Bid is evidence that his hour 
and that of his gang has come and that God's command will be 
implemented at the hands of his honest slaves of the sons of 
Yemen in the battles of honor and sacrifice and on the axes of 
combat. When the time comes for the implementation of God's 
command, this cannot be delayed or prevented. This is 
especially true since God does not reward the actions of the 
corrupt and He is always watchful of the traitors. 
  'Ali Salim al-Bid and his traitorous collaborators have 
asked 
for it. They have dug their own graves. They have preferred 
blindness to guidance and violated their commitment and pledge 
to God, so He led them astray, blinded them, and promised them 
severe punishment. 
  They have thought their weapons would save them from God and 
the people. But God surprised them and threw panic into their 
hearts and made the unionists stand firm. Thus, all the people 
are now fighting the battle against al-Bid and his gang. The 
gang is now closer to falling in the abyss and very near its end. 
  Have they not heard the marching of the forces of legitimacy 
and unity when these forces continued to capture locations, 
hardware, and various weapons? Have they not learned that the 
forces which they had controlled are daily joining the forces of 
legitimacy in all positions? Have they not heard that the 
nationalist parties and popular bodies and organizations have 
all condemned their grave traitorous act? Have they not heard 
the unionists within the Yemeni Socialist Party condemn this 
malicious secessionist crime and disown this malevolent 
traitorous action? Have they not seen the world ridicule their 
traitorous action? 
  Indeed, they have heard and seen all of this. We shall leave 
them in their trespasses, to wander in distraction. [Koranic 
verse] They are embarking on an adventure and are shooting 
their arrows right and left. Therefore, what they have done so 
far, and what they will do, are no more than random acts 
committed in the dark. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Nairobi, 20 May (SUNA) -- Deputy speaker of the 
Transitional National Assembly (TNA) Angelo Beda, Bahr al-Jabal 
State's Wali [Governor] Mrs. Agnes Lokudu and director of the 
peace department at the Foreign Ministry Mathiang Malwal have 
held here on Friday [20 May] a news conference on the 
resolutions of Juba political forum for peace forces. 
  Beda said that over 350 of the southern leaderships, besides 
representatives of international press and some ambassadors 
accredited to Khartoum, had participated in the forum, 
describing the forum as a "real gathering" to hear the voice of 
southern citizens, who confirmed their insistence on the unity 
of Sudanese soil and called for ending the war. 
  He added that the existing government is the only one that 
sat to negotiate seriously with the rebels' movement to end the 
southern Sudan war by presenting the Federal Government system 
as a comprehensive solution. 
  Mrs. Agnes Lokudu said that the forum asserted that the 
southern leaderships are aware of the Sudanese people's 
interests and not toys in the hands of government, as termed by 
the rebels' government and some hostile (?mass) media.

  [Excerpts] On the occasion of the onset of the blessed 'Id 
al-Adha, brother President Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] went to 
the Hammam Lanouf martyrs cemetery in Tunis where he said a 
prayer for the souls of the martyrs amid a huge gathering of 
Palestinians cadres. 
  Brother President Abu-'Ammar delivered a brief speech in 
which he said: In the name of God, the compassionate, the 
merciful. [passage omitted] Dear brother Abu-Iyad [Salah 
Khalaf], Abu al-Hawl, Abu-Muhammad, Abu-Jihad [Brigadier General 
Muhammad], 'Atif, Abu-'Ali Iyad, Hamad ['Abd-al-Karim], Ghassan 
Kanafani, Abu al-Walid, Majid Abu-Sharar, Abu-al-Mundhir; 
brothers and beloved martyrs. While you rest in you paradise, 
the members of the Palestinian police force have entered 
Palestinian soil, the first liberated Palestinian land where the 
Palestinian flag is flying, and where we are going to set up the 
first Palestinian authority. 
  We are very aware of the significance of what we have 
achieved. We have not achieved everything that we wanted, but 
this is a step on the path of achieving what we want; a step 
toward the establishment of a Palestinian state whose capital 
will be Jerusalem. Some people see this as a long-term goal, 
but we see it as a short term one; we know we are right. 
  Once again brother martyrs, I would like to say that the 
promise that is between us will remain the same. We realize 
that the road to Jerusalem is a difficult and long one, but we 
will fly the flag of Palestine, the flag of the Arab nation, on 
the walls, churches, and mosques of Jerusalem. [passage omitted] 
  While we bid farewell today to sisterly Tunisia that stood 
by 
us and hosted this Palestinian work, this revolution, and 
leadership, we would like to express to our brother Zine el 
Abidine, to his hospitable people, and wise government our 
heartfelt thanks. We say to them we are in this path, the path 
of the Arab nation. We, the Palestinian people, represent this 
front, the Arab front on the sacred land, the first of the two 
qiblahs and the third of the holy places. We are an integral 
part of our Arab nation, we are an extension of this Arab land 
and this nation. The Arab columns who today enter Gaza and 
Jericho will tomorrow enter Nablus, Hebron, Tulkaram, Bethlehem, 
Ramallah, and every Palestinian territory. We have a date 
there, brothers. 
  The international resolution sought to undermine this 
revolution and the PLO, however, this blessed intifadah managed 
to put our people on the political map of the region. This 
result firmly puts our people on the political and geographic 
map, and consequently on the Middle East map. This baby 
requires all of us to work for him and with him, so that this 
baby will be able to grow and mature. 
  Once again, let met reiterate to you that our promise will 
remain the same promise and the pledge the same pledge. Let us 
stand together as one until the liberation of Jerusalem.

  In remarks, carried by the Qatari News Agency, during a 
visit 
today to the martyrs cemetery in the Hammam al-Shatt District 
near the Tunisian capital to mark the blessed 'Id al-Adha, 
'Arafat said what has been achieved thus far is something like a 
newborn that needs all the care and attention it can get until 
it is able to hoist the Palestinian flag over Jerusalem. Our 
Palestinian people are an integral part of the Arab nation, 
'Arafat stated. 
  Brother Abu-'Ammar thanked the Tunisian Republic for the 
support it has given to the Palestinian people and cause and for 
playing host to their leaders.

  [Excerpt] The Foreign Ministry issued a statement noting 
that yesterday at noon, it received a report from the Egyptian 
embassy in Khartoum saying that Sudanese security forces had 
expropriated three houses owned by Egyptian military attaches. 
One was occupied by the assistant air force attache, and the 
other two by embassy staff. 
  According to the report, the Sudanese security forces seized 
the residence of the Egyptian chairman of the joint irrigation 
authority of the Nile River water, in addition to 30 other 
residences owned by the Egyptian Irrigation Authority that were 
occupied by large numbers of Egyptian irrigation mission 
personnel and their families. The Sudanese security forces 
prevented these employees and their families from entering their 
homes. 
  At the same time, the Foreign Ministry statement adds, the 
Sudanese security forces expropriated the building of the 
Egyptian sports club in Khartoum. 
  In view of these measures, the Foreign Ministry immediately 
summoned the Sudanese charge d'affairs in Cairo to strongly 
protest the unacceptable and unjustified conduct which primarily 
targets Egyptian individuals and families residing in Sudan.

<F P=106> [By Selim Yassine] </F>
  [Text] Qasr Naba, Lebanon, May 21 (AFP)--Israeli commandos 
met with no resistance as they kidnapped a Moslem fundamentalist 
guerrilla chief in a slick pre-dawn raid on his home on Saturday 
[21 May], his brother said. 
  "There were around 25 men all dressed in Israeli military 
uniform," said Subhi al-Dirani, the brother of Mustafa al-Dirani 
who was snatched by the helicopter-borne commandos from his home 
in Syrian-controlled eastern Lebanon. 
"They did not meet with any resistance when they grabbed Mustafa 
in front of his family," and no one was hurt, he said. 
  Mustafa al-Dirani, 46, is held responsible by Israel for the 
capture of airman Ron Arad whose plane was shot down over south 
Lebanon in 1986. The abduction is seen as a bargaining chip in 
the release of the pilot. 
  "No one in the village heard the helicopters which brought 
the commandos. 
The soldiers stormed the house out of nowhere and immediately 
went into the bedroom where my brother and his wife were 
sleeping," Subhi al-Dirani said. 
  "They handcuffed me with cuffs made in England and pointed 
their guns at my father, my sister-in-law and her three 
children, grabbed my brother and fled on foot. The whole thing 
lasted 10 minutes," the 26-year-old added. 
  He said the commandos spoke in Hebrew with each other "but 
they spoke to us in Arabic." 
  Lebanese army troops threw a security cordon around the Niha 
hills, which overlook Qasr Naba, five kilometers (three miles) 
away where the two helicopters used by the commandos had landed. 
  Witnesses said the commandos drove by jeep from the hill to 
al-Dirani's house, which is located on the edge of the village, 
and drove back to the waiting choppers. Some villagers said 
they had seen an exchange of light signals before the operation, 
suggesting that the commandos had accomplices inside the village 
who gave them the all clear.

  [Text] Aden, Yemen, May 21 (AFP) -- Aden authorities 
proclaimed early Saturday an independent state in South Yemen, 
16 days after becoming embroiled in a civil war with northern 
government forces. 
  Announcing the secession from the north after one of the 
bloodiest days of fighting since the conflict began, the south's 
leader 'Ali Salim al-Bid said in a televised address: "I 
proclaim the creation of the Yemeni Democratic Republic as an 
independent state with its capital in Aden." 
  The declaration came just a day before the fourth 
anniversary 
of the unification of North and South Yemen and hours after the 
north called a three-day ceasefire. 
  The two sides, locked in a political crisis since August 
1993, have been at war since May 4. 
  Al-Bid said the decision to break away resulted from 
attempts 
by his bitter northern rival, President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, to 
"destroy the south" by means of war, and his refusal to 
countenance dialogue on the basis of a bilateral reconciliation 
document signed February 20 in Amman. 
  He said the new state, which he called on "friendly" 
countries to recognize in line with international norms, would 
be governed by the same constitution as that in force in the 
north. 
  It would base its legislative system on Islamic Shari'ah 
law, 
he added. 
  He also announced the formation of a Council of National 
Salvation comprising elected southern deputies, representatives 
of political parties and religious figures, which will choose a 
Presidential Council and an interim government, adding that 
multi-party elections would be held within a year. 
  Al-Bid, Salih's sacked vice president and the leader of 
South 
Yemen prior to unification, said the new state was committed to 
respecting "political and public freedoms, human rights and 
freedom of expression and of the press," and would maintain a 
liberal economic system. 
  The announcement prompted spontaneous celebratory gunfire 
throughout the southern port city, correspondents said. 
  It was also backed early Saturday by 'Abd-al-Rahman 
Al-Jifri, 
leader of the opposition Sons of Yemen movement, who told AFP 
the union "could not continue under (the Sanaa) regime," which 
had sought to control it "by use of force". 
  Salih's General People's Congress and Al-Bid's Yemen 
Socialist Party had formed a fragile governing coalition after 
April 1993 elections. 
  The declaration came after a day of bitter fighting amid 
increasing pressure from Arab leaders for an end to hostilities. 
  Hours earlier the government in Sanaa called a three-day 
ceasefire as of Saturday 00:00 a.m. (Friday 2100 GMT), the SABA' 
news agency said. 
  Northern leaders presented the truce as offering "a last 
chance to the (southern) separatists ... to end their 
rebellion, adhere to the constitution and place their troops 
under the command of the head of state" in Sanaa. 
  Earlier in the day Salih seemingly ignored appeals from 
Egyptian President Husni Mubarak and Palestine Liberation 
Organisation leader Yasir 'Arafat to lay down arms for the 'Id 
Al-Adha feast, which starts Saturday. 
  But in Mukallah, 700 kilometers (450 miles) east of Aden, 
Al-Bid ruled out any form of surrender and vowed "not to give up 
a single inch of our territory in the south." 
  In a radio speech he said Salih was "trying to get his hands 
on Aden and the oil-rich eastern provinces and we are not going 
to let him have either Aden or the oil." 
  A spokesman for the southern forces here said 1,500 northern 
troops had been killed Friday in the Kharaz region west of Aden 
while trying to advance on the city. 
  The death toll, which was not confirmed by the north, was 
the 
largest daily loss announced since the fighting broke out. 
  Earlier Friday northern forces claimed to have made further 
progress in advancing on Aden. 
  The southern army had also retaken control of the key 
Al-'Anad airbase 60 kilometres (35 miles) north of Aden, the 
spokesman said, although earlier in the day Sanaa said its 
forces controlled the airbase. 
  Despite unification in 1990, the north and south have 
persisted in retaining separate security forces, civil services 
and bureaucracies.

  [Text] We have just received the following from the central 
news desk: 
  Yemen President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih has announced his 
compliance with President Husni Mubarak's appeal to end the 
fighting in Yemen. President Salih affirmed to President Mubarak 
that a decision to end the fighting will be made in the coming 
hours. This was said in a telephone call that President Mubarak 
received from Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih a few 
moments ago. During the telephone call, President Mubarak 
stressed the need to make a decision to end the fighting among 
all parties and along all fronts. He emphasized that the Yemeni 
dispute can be resolved through dialogue, understanding, and 
amity. President Mubarak stressed that the fighting will not 
decisively settle the current crisis and noted the need to 
safeguard Yemen's unity and the interests of the Yemeni people. 
  Meanwhile, President Mubarak has received a telephone call 
from 'Ali Salim al-Bid, in which he underlined his commitment 
and compliance with Yemen [as heard].

  [Text] Last night, an IDF [Israel Defense Forces] force 
operating deep in Lebanon's al-Biqa' region captured and brought 
to Israel Mustafa al-Dirani, the head of a radical terrorist 
organization which took navigator Ron Arad captive in 1986. 
Al-Dirani heads an organization called the Believer's 
Resistance. An IDF spokesman reported that all our forces 
returned safely to base. 
  A REUTERS reporter in al-Biqa' reported that an IDF force 
flew by helicopter to al-Dirani's village of (al-Qassanabah), 
which is located 10 kilometers from Zahlah. The commando force 
kidnapped al-Dirani from his home. 
  IDF representatives have informed the Arad family about the 
operation.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by </F>
'Ido Baum; place not given; from the weekly "In the Current 
Situation" program -- live] 
  [Text] [Baum] Good morning, Foreign Minister Peres. 
  [Peres] Good morning. 
  [Baum] Let us start with the clean and daring operation by 
the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]. What can you say about it? 
  [Peres] I certainly think the IDF is worthy of all praise 
for this very daring and accurate operation which snatched an 
extremely dangerous individual from the place he used as a 
staging point for a great number of attacks. This proves that 
the IDF is as powerful and effective as ever. In addition, this 
shows that we have not forgotten Ron Arad for one moment, on all 
levels. Israeli officials raise this issue, whether directly or 
indirectly, at almost every diplomatic meeting. This time, the 
IDF's long arm reached out. One must remember that Lebanon is a 
lawless country and there is no other way for us to protect our 
interests to the best of our capabilities. 
  [Baum] The families of the Israeli POW's and MIA's have 
indeed leveled many complaints against the government recently, 
especially for not presenting the issue of the POW's and MIA's 
as a condition in the talks with the PLO. Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres, is kidnapping these leaders really the only 
option? 
  [Peres] It is not the only way, but it is one of them. We 
have also been engaged in diplomatic efforts constantly and on 
an almost daily basis with regard to the issue of the POW's and 
MIA's. We have left no stone unturned in an effort to discover 
some traces or find out what happened to these people. 
  [Baum] What is the next, now that we are holding this 
individual? 
  [Peres] First of all, we want to find out who he turned Ron 
Arad over to. It is clear that he held Ron Arad prisoner for a 
reasonably long period. Our problem is to get an address. Who 
is holding Ron Arad and where? This operation was one of the 
milestones on the way to that address. 
  [Baum] After the assassination of 'Abbas al-Musawi [former 
Hizballah leader], katyushas were fired at Israel's northern 
settlements? Should these settlements prepare for such an 
attack now? 
  [Peres] I hope not. 
  [Baum] Thank you, Foreign Minister Peres.

<F P=106> [News conference by Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin with </F>
domestic correspondents at the Dan Hotel in Tel Aviv -- live] 
  [Text] [Rabin] Two events have taken place: one on 
Friday [20 May] and one on Saturday. On Friday, there was a 
murderous event in which two IDF [Israel Defense Forces] 
soldiers were killed at the Erez checkpoint after the IDF's 
redeployment -- an event we will not be able to ignore. 
Therefore, the exit from Gaza has been closed until units of 
the Palestinian police are stationed 200-300 meters from the 
passages used by the Palestinians. The Palestinian police will 
be responsible for making sure that nobody crosses its 
checkpoint bearing weapons. 
  Moreover, the test of the Palestinians today is their 
takeover of Gaza and Jericho and their ability to demonstrate 
full control over those areas. If they do not prove it, it will 
be hard for us to continue to carry out the additional stages in 
the implementation of the Declaration of Principles we signed. 
  Last night, the IDF carried out an operation -- an operation 
which the IDF, the State of Israel, and lovers of freedom and 
the fight against terror can be proud of. The operation was 
unanimously approved by all the members of the inner cabinet in 
a meeting on 19 May. Its purpose was to bring here the man who 
today heads a terrorist organization operating against us in the 
security zone -- the Believers Resistance -- and who held Ron 
Arad for at least two years and who, I hope, will definitely be 
able to give us information about the period during which he 
held him and perhaps about his condition later on. 
  The operation was conducted on the basis of our 
responsibility for the MIA's and the POW's. This time, the 
reasons I had for submitting my recommendation to the inner 
cabinet were not the same as those I had at the time when I 
recommended to the inner cabinet to bring Shaykh 'Ubayd to 
Israel. At that time, I had hoped that Shaykh 'Ubayd would 
serve as a bargaining chip in the negotiations. I no longer have 
any illusions that anybody can be used as a bargaining chip in 
the negotiations -- certainly not Mustafa al-Dirani. Our goal 
was to further exhaust the chances of obtaining information 
about what happened in the past and the current fate of Ron 
Arad. This operation was also part of our fight against 
Lebanese terrorism directed at the security zone. 
  I would like to express my deep appreciation to the IDF, the 
intelligence community, the special units, the Air Force, the 
Intelligence Corps, and others who participated in an operation 
that once again proves the IDF's greatness as the Army 
responsible for the defense of Israel. To my regret, in the 
last six and a half years, the IDF has been carrying out 
policing duties and has been used as an Army imposing Israel's 
rule on another people. It has been carrying out tough policing 
duties which were unavoidable, escorting convoys, guarding 
roads, escorting school buses -- missions which could not supply 
a full answer in the face of a people's uprising. 
  I would like to seize this occasion to point out that some 
right-wing extremists claim that the blood that is being shed is 
being shed for peace. There can be no grosser lie. The blood 
being shed is because of our rule over another foreign people. 
Peace is the only chance -- not a certainty -- of ever 
attaining an end to this bloodshed or definitely a significant 
reduction of it. As long as the occupation rule continues and 
as long as there is growing resistance to it by extreme 
elements, the murderers of Israelis and murderers of peace -- 
Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and the Islamic Jihad -- we 
will have to pay a bloody price. The IDF and the security 
branches will do their best to reduce it, but the bloody price 
is the price of ruling over another people that is rebelling 
against our rule -- and this point must be understood. I am 
sorry that the IDF bears the tough mission of policing a large, 
rebelling population that is causing fatalities among civilians 
and soldiers. I hope that as the peace process continues, the 
IDF will go back to being a defense army rather than an army 
ruling over another people. 
  [Jerusalem Israel Television Channel 1's political 
correspondent Gadi Sukenik] Mr. Rabin, with all due respect to 
those who executed the operation, of course, could not such an 
operation have been carried out during the seven years that Ron 
Arad has been in captivity and to this day in order to extract 
information from people such as al-Dirani? To this day, is 
there any certainty that Ron Arad is alive? 
  [Rabin] As far as certainties go, I have no clear-cut proof 
that he is alive, and there is definitely no clear-cut proof 
that he is not alive. In the IDF, an MIA is any soldier or 
officer who is considered to be alive as long as it has not been 
proven otherwise. 
  As for the second part of your question, we have taken 
people 
in the past. This operation could have been carried out a few 
months ago, but it was put off because of intelligence 
considerations and chances of obtaining information. It was 
designed to be carried out in a specific area -- in that area 
where the operation took place. Therefore, the timing chosen was 
the first possible time after another channel and hope of 
obtaining information through other means were blocked. 
  [Jerusalem New Channel 2 Television's Dov Gilhar] Mr. Rabin, 
what is the next stage? Assuming that Mustafa al-Dirani 
confirms that he handed Ron Arad over to the Iranians, is it now 
a question of international pressure on Tehran? What are the 
next moves? 
  [Rabin] At the moment, I do not want to say what we will 
find out in the course of his interrogation. Furthermore, I 
should say that the unit, which carried out the operation 
admirably -- I would like to congratulate the chief of staff, 
the General Staff, the chief of intelligence, the Air Force 
commander, and particularly the soldiers who carried out the 
mission and the pilots who flew them -- also brought with it a 
considerable amount of written material which will certainly 
throw light on some points. When I presented my recommendation 
to the inner cabinet two days ago and asked it to approve the 
operation, I said that we must exhaust any lead and any way that 
will offer us more information. I cannot assure you that we 
will get conclusive information about the whereabouts and 
condition of Ron Arad today. I can assure you that such 
operations will also be carried out in the future, if they are 
necessary and if possible, because we bear responsibility for 
all the MIA's and POW's whose fate has not yet been conclusively 
determined by Israel and the IDF. 
  [Unidentified Tel Aviv IDF Radio correspondent] Mr. Prime 
Minister, this daring operation notwithstanding, did you take 
into account the possibility that the decision to carry it out 
could lead to a flare-up or perhaps a new war with Hizballah 
along the northern border? 
  [Rabin] We took everything into consideration. I 
recommended it, and it was planned by the IDF. When it was 
ready, I presented it to the inner cabinet with the realization 
that we must take risks for the sake of the heavy responsibility 
we bear for the fate of the POW's and MIA's. The problem is not 
to put up bumper stickers [calling for Arad's release] but to do 
the things that give us a better chance of getting more 
information, even if they entail risks and uncertainties. 
  [Unidentified Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el correspondent] Might 
this operation not affect the U.S. secretary of state's efforts 
to resume the peace talks? 
  [Rabin] I do not see why. After he returned from Damascus, 
I asked the secretary of state what he had brought back as a 
result of President Clinton's appeal to President al-Asad in 
Geneva to take action to provide information, through the 
Americans, about the MIA's and the POW's -- not just about Ron 
Arad, but about all of them; about those about whom we have no 
information, particularly Ron Arad and the MIA's from the 
al-Sultan Ya'qub battle: Baumel, Katz, and Feldman. The U.S. 
President again sent Dennis Ross to another meeting in Damascus, 
and we in fact received no additional information. The U.S. 
congressional delegation that visited Syria did not produce any 
trace of new information. Therefore, Syria has no right 
whatsoever to complain about it. It was not carried out on its 
soil. It is true, however, that it was carried out in an area 
controlled by the Syrian Army and where Syrian troops are 
deployed.

<F P=106> [News conference by Lieutenant General Ehud Baraq, chief of </F>
staff, and Major General Uri Sagi, chief of the Intelligence 
Branch, with domestic correspondents at the Defense Ministry in 
Tel Aviv -- live] 
  [Text] [Baraq] Last night, after 0200 [2300 GMT], an IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces] unit executed an operation in Qasr Naba 
in al-Biqa', not far from Zahlah. As you can see on the map, 
here is Beirut, here is Damascus, here is the Damascus-Beirut 
highway and Zahlah, (Rayyaq), and Qasr Naba to the north of it. 
This mountain range is called Mount Lebanon. Its altitude is 
the same as Mount Hermon, and it has steep cliffs at the bottom 
of which lie a number of villages. The force brought Mustafa 
al-Dirani, the leader of the Believers Resistance, on whose 
deeds Chief of Intelligence Uri Sagi will later elaborate, back 
from there. 
  The operation was conducted on very rough and steep terrain. 
The village is located at the bottom of a cliff, and the area 
is difficult for vehicles of any kind to traverse and for 
aircraft to land. The unit achieved absolute surprise, and 
within a few minutes, the operation in the building itself was 
over. A considerable number of weapons were found in the 
building, including a loaded gun at Mustafa al-Dirani's bedside, 
which he had no time to use, just as others had no such 
opportunity as a result of the element of surprise. Numerous 
documents of all kinds -- not just written ones -- were found. 
The unit, which was instructed to avoid hurting any other 
members of the family or other civilians in the village to the 
extent possible, even if they opened fire, succeeded in 
fulfilling this mission. 
  During the operation and while the unit was making its 
retreat, fire was opened from the adjacent apartment, inhabited 
by al-Dirani's brother. The fact that the village was awakened 
by the operation called for certain changes in the unit's exit 
from the village. They made their exit while shooting for the 
most part without taking aim. One of the officers was slightly 
injured in the thigh, apparently by a bullet or shrapnel. 
During the evacuation flight, a few rounds of antiaircraft fire 
may have been directed at the helicopters or at the roar of the 
helicopters near the Lebanese coast, north of Beirut. 
  The objectives of the operation were fully attained. 
Al-Dirani is in our hands, and we believe his interrogation 
will contribute to shedding light on the situation with regard 
to Ron Arad's whereabouts and perhaps to understanding what must 
be done to deal with Ron Arad's case in the future. No human 
lives were lost. The operation and its outcome contribute to 
some extent to the IDF's deterrent power and are an expression 
of our moral debt to Ron and to the principle of the IDF's modus 
operandi, whereby everything that can be done to bring back 
every POW and ascertain the fate of every MIA will be done, even 
at the expense of risky operations. 
  The operation was planned for many weeks, in fact months, 
and 
it relied on operational and intelligence abilities -- not just 
in the field -- which we have accumulated over the years. It 
was executed with the highest level of professional acumen and 
precision and while adapting to what materialized in the field. 
In such operations, a thin thread separates success from 
failure and its cost. I am glad that it ended the way it did. 
  I can only express my appreciation to the executing unit, a 
very select IDF unit; to the Air Force squadrons, particularly 
the Saar gunship helicopter squadrons, the cargo and other 
aircraft; to the intelligence community: to the Intelligence 
Branch and to its chief, Uri Sagi, whose unique contribution to 
this operation and its outcome goes beyond the formal duties of 
a chief of intelligence; and, of course, to the decisionmakers: 
to the inner cabinet, which decided on the operation based on 
our recommendation, and first and foremost to the prime minister 
and defense minister, who supported the planning of the 
operation and backed it all the way through. 
  I will now leave the floor to Uri. Later, if you want to 
pose some questions, we will be willing to answer a few of them. 
  [Sagi] Mustafa al-Dirani is the head of the Believers 
Resistance, a splinter group of the Amal organization. He 
headed Amal's terrorist apparatus until 1988 and, as part of his 
duties, was responsible for a large number of attacks on IDF 
soldiers, from the time of the Peace for Galilee Operation and 
until he retired from Amal in 1988. He is the founder of the 
Believers Resistance, an independent faction which has now 
merged with Hizballah. While it was an independent body, 
however, it carried out numerous attacks against IDF and SLA 
[South Lebanese Army] soldiers in south Lebanon. His 
involvement in holding Ron Arad hostage has long been known, at 
least to the intelligence community. We possess reliable 
information -- which applied prior to the operation and has been 
largely confirmed with al-Dirani's transfer to Israel -- to the 
effect that Ron Arad was taken prisoner and held by Mustafa 
al-Dirani for a period of over two years and that he even 
conducted negotiations about him which may give us a lead as to 
the future and perhaps even the fate of Ron Arad. 
  Undoubtedly, the investigation is at its height. Both the 
investigation and the findings brought back by the unit will 
apparently provide us with some answers -- I hope soon -- to 
questions we could not answer prior to the operation. As said, 
the operation did not lead to any exceptional reactions that 
were not foreseen or predicted. Like the chief of staff, I can 
also tell you that no civilians or other people who were not 
meant to be hurt or be brought to Israeli territory were hurt. 
The repercussions of the operation will yet be examined, but 
there is no doubt that the fact that Mustafa al-Dirani is here 
may shed a great deal of light on the main question: Will we 
have more detailed intelligence about Ron Arad's fate? 
  [Jerusalem Israel Television Channel 1's Alon Ben-David] Mr. 
Chief of Staff, the prime minister said a few minutes ago that 
al-Dirani's abduction was not meant to provide us with a 
bargaining chip for Ron Arad's release. Before we set out on 
this operation, did we have any information to the effect that 
this abduction will bring Ron Arad's return to Israel somewhat 
closer? 
  [Baraq] In my opinion, the main thing to be obtained is a 
better understanding on our part -- as a result of what will 
emerge from the investigation and of a thorough analysis of the 
papers and other documents we seized there -- as to what exactly 
happened to Ron Arad. It is the confirmed end of a thread 
leading to somebody who held him in his hands and apparently 
handed him over to the Iranians. Information and a better 
understanding may surface later as to how to act in the future 
in order to secure Ron Arad's return to Israel. 
  [Jerusalem New Channel 2 Television's Roni Daniyel] Mr. 
Chief of Staff, could you be more specific about the method of 
operation in the village last night? 
  [Baraq] I think it would not be right to detail the methods 
of operation on television. I cannot swear to you that this 
will be the last time we will have to use these operational 
tools, which are very important and sensitive and contribute a 
great deal to the IDF's abilities. I cannot tell you that this 
is the last time we will use them. Therefore, the better we 
manage to conceal and cloud the details of the operation, the 
better it will be. 
  [Daniyel] Mr. Chief of Intelligence, could you elaborate 
on what we learned about Ron Arad that we did not know before? 
Lebanese reports say that cassettes and documents were seized 
from his home. 
  [Sagi] I would consider it rash and perhaps even wrong to 
elaborate at this point on the additional findings, coming as 
they do on the heels of quite a considerable amount of 
information we had before we carried out the operation. I 
believe it would be correct to say that in addition to our 
assessment prior to the operation, we are certain about the 
responsibility for Ron Arad's fate during his captivity with 
Amal and later on when he was under the charge of Mustafa 
al-Dirani and the Believers Resistance. We apparently have and 
we will yet attain additional information about the ensuing 
period. In other words, in my opinion, in 1989 Ron Arad was 
handed over to other organizations. I believe it would not be 
right to elaborate on this point because of the intelligence 
sensitivity of the matter and the need to investigate further 
and confirm the findings in our possession. As noted, the 
nature of the operation shows that the information obtained 
through al-Dirani's capture and from other findings can really 
and considerably improve our knowledge. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el's Army affairs correspondent Karmela 
Menashe] Mustafa al-Dirani held Ron Arad as far back as six 
years ago. Did the operation not come too late? 
  [Sagi] I, of course, do not define the timing of operations. 
On this issue, I am subject to the chief of staff's decision 
and, to the best of my knowledge, he is subject to the decision 
of the defense minister and the government. Whenever the 
operational opportunity and intelligence need arise, I think 
there is a proper way to make our recommendation to the 
authoritative levels. If and when conditions enable it, the 
needs justify it, and the operation is approved, then it is 
carried out. I must say -- fortunately, these are secret 
matters -- this is not the first such operation and, I believe, 
neither will it be the last. 
  [Baraq] I would like to add that this operation had been 
prepared once before and was quite close to execution, but as a 
result of considerations related to the covert efforts for the 
release of Ron Arad, we decided not to execute it and to put it 
off for several months. Now the time looked right for its 
execution, and the operation was carried out. 
  [Unidentified Tel Aviv IDF Radio correspondent] Mr. Chief of 
Staff, did you take into consideration the possibility of a 
confrontation with the Syrians in the course of the operation? 
  [Baraq] The area in which the operation was carried out is 
controlled by the Syrian Army. Syrian troops are deployed in 
this area, which lies within the range of Syrian antiaircraft 
and ground missiles. Nevertheless, we built the operation in 
such a way as to reduce these risks to a minimum. I am glad 
that no such confrontation occurred and believe there is no 
reason for this issue -- fighting for information and for ways 
to secure the release of an Israeli POW -- to lead to any 
substantial friction with the Syrians.

  [Text] Israeli President Ezer Weizman has stated that the 
kidnapping of Mustafa al-Dirani demonstrates that Israel is 
doing its best for the sake of one of its soldiers. Israel will 
even step up its efforts in defense of the border area where 
army, security, and civilian personnel are deployed, Weizman 
added. He said: We will never abandon them because Israel is 
concerned with the security of this area and the fate of its 
inhabitants. 
  At the end of a visit to the border area to convey 
congratulations on 'Id al-Adha, President Weizman met the press. 
Present were the South Lebanese Army's [SLA] General Lahd, some 
of the area's key figures, Deputy Chief of Staff Amnon Shahaq, 
the commander of the northern sector, and the commander of the 
Liaison Force. Weizman said that peace in the Middle East rests 
with Syria and there is a link connecting Damascus, Beirut, and 
Amman on this issue. Weizman stressed that conducting 
unilateral talks with Lebanon depends on the Syrian president. 
I hope President Hafiz al-Asad will understand that the time is 
ripe for him to change his views concerning peace, he added. 
  Before leaving the border area, Weizman held a 30-minute 
closed meeting with Gen. Lahd.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu </F>
by 'Ido Baum; place not given; from the weekly "In the Current 
Situation" program -- live] 
  [Text] [Baum] Good morning Knesset Member Binyamin 
Netanyahu, head of the opposition. 
  [Netanyahu] Good morning. 
  [Baum] What is your reaction to last night's operation? 
  [Netanyahu] Well, you know I make no secret of my criticism 
of the government but in this case they, as well as the IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces] commanders and soldiers, all deserve 
hearty praise for apparently carrying out what the late Hayim 
Bar-Lev [former chief of staff and minister who died last week] 
used to call a strong, swift, and elegant operation. I take my 
hat off to them. 
  [Baum] Some opposition members have claimed that the 
government is not doing enough to bring back the POW's and the 
MIA's. Perhaps the correct way to go about this is to really 
take direct action against Hizballah and not demand information 
from the PLO which apparently does not have any. 
  [Netanyahu] The steps taken should be comprehensive. The 
PLO definitely has information because 'Arafat gave the prime 
minister half of Ron Arad's dog tag. Therefore, we can demand 
valuable information from 'Arafat such as who handed him the dog 
tag and who holds its second half. However, I still think that 
we can exert certain pressure -- from which the government is 
refraining -- with regard to the mass release of prisoners, an 
issue I regard as problematic in the first place. If we are 
already going ahead with such a step then we definitely could at 
least extract more information and clues to help us locate our 
people. With regard to last night's operation, which may arouse 
international criticism, it is important to explain that Israel 
has the full right not only to follow the supreme Jewish 
doctrine of ransoming prisoners thus reassuring every IDF 
soldier that he will never be abandoned if taken prisoner by the 
enemy, but also to act against the kidnappers and to capture 
them whether for bargaining purposes or to extract information. 
This is something the IDF has done in the past not only in the 
case of Shaykh 'Ubayd [kidnapped from Lebanon in 1989]. This 
policy was also reflected in the kidnapping, or, more rightly, 
the capture of the five senior Syrian general staff officers 
while Syria was holding our pilots and POW's and refused to 
release them as part of a prisoner exchange as mandated by the 
Geneva Conventions. We have carried out such operations. I 
myself participated in two unsuccessful missions. My brother, 
Yoni, directly commanded the operation in which the Syrian 
officers were captured and four or five months later our 
prisoners were returned as part of a prisoner exchange. 
Therefore, Israel has all the right to act whether for 
information or bargaining purposes as part of its efforts to 
bring back our POW's and MIA's. 
  [Baum] Shaykh 'Ubayd was kidnapped when the unity government 
was in power with Yitzhaq Shamir as prime minister and Yitzhaq 
Rabin as defense minister. So far, however, his kidnapping has 
not helped especially. The POW's and MIA's have not been 
returned. The question is whether or not the risks entailed in 
such an operation outweigh the possible benefits? Are these 
operations justified? 
  [Netanyahu] First of all, there are no guarantees. I do not 
deny the fact that there is no way of knowing. When we 
kidnapped those Syrian officers no one could state with 
certainty that the outcome would be positive or that there would 
be no negative ramifications. This danger always exists, in 
this case as well. However, I definitely have full confidence in 
the government's decision on this matter because every country 
has the right to act against an organization of murderers and 
kidnappers which has information, and perhaps even more, in 
order to achieve the basic, humanitarian goal of bringing its 
prisoners back home. That is acceptable within all 
international frameworks and we must insist on this matter, not 
only on the international but also on the domestic level. 
Whatever the price, it is more important that every IDF soldier 
sent to the battlefield knows with full certainty that Israel 
will do the maximum to bring him back home. 
  [Baum] Thank you, opposition leader Binyamin Netanyahu.

  [Text] Likud Knesset Member Ari'el Sharon congratulated 
the Army and defense minister [for the operation in which 
Mustafa al-Dirani was abducted]. He hoped it would be the start 
of energetic action by which Israel would amass a bank of 
prisoners that eventually would ease the release of Ron Arad and 
the missing IDF [Israel Defense Forces] men. 
  The Tzomet party congratulated the IDF. Tzomet Chairman 
Refa'el Eytan said it was the only method the Arabs understood, 
and such actions should be continued with determination and 
cunning. 
  The chairman of the Meretz faction in the Knesset, Ran 
Kohen, 
praised the Army for its precise and perfect execution of the 
abduction. Normally he disapproves of carrying off people, but 
this time it was justified in view of the callousness and 
wickedness of the jailers of Israeli prisoners. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1400 GMT on 21 May

"The Moledet faction praised the IDF for the perfect execution

  [Text] This morning the cabinet heard a thorough briefing 
on the abduction of Mustafa al-Dirani, and the ministers praised 
the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and the chief of staff on the 
operation. Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz adds that the 
ministers heard briefings on the situation in Gaza and Jericho, 
mainly by the coordinator of government activities in the 
territories. It was reported that unless funds are received in 
these areas, chiefly for the Palestinian police, the situation 
there will deteriorate. 
  Prime Minister Rabin reiterated his criticism of 'Arafat's 
call for a jihad to free Jerusalem, and once again rejected 
'Arafat's explanation. Foreign Minister Peres was more moderate 
in his remarks on the issue. The cabinet is currently dealing 
with the housing problem. 
  [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 0920 GMT on 22 May carries 
a 
similar report, live from the Prime Minister's Office by 
political correspondent Udi Segal, which adds: "Ministers 
Shetrit and Tzaban noted the genocide taking place in Rwanda. 
The cabinet decided to express its shock in view of the murders 
in Africa. Foreign Minister Peres said he would examine the 
possibility of providing humanitarian aid to Rwanda."]

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Udi Segal] </F>
  [Text] Israel hopes that last night's operation will shed 
a little light on the fate of captive navigator Ron Arad. 
According to Israeli intelligence data, the last person known 
with certainty to have held Arad prisoner was Mustafa al-Dirani. 
  In the assessment of Israeli officials, al-Dirani turned the 
navigator over to the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in exchange 
for money. The captive navigator's fate has been unknown ever 
since and no information has been received on this matter. In 
this sense, the aim of last night's kidnapping operation was to 
glean more information that could help reveal Ron Arad's 
location. Al-Dirani was captured by a commando force for 
interrogation purposes and in the future he could conceivably 
serve as a bargaining chip. 
  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin decided to approve the 
operation 
with the recommendation of Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq, the head 
of the Shin Bet, and other senior security officials. On 
Thursday [19 May], the matter was brought before the Ministerial 
Committee on National Security Affairs. The ministers were 
asked to maintain total secrecy. Not all the cabinet ministers 
knew about the operation, even after it had taken place this 
morning. 
  A senior political source said that if al-Dirani's 
interrogation corroborated the information Israel already 
possessed according to which Ron Arad had been turned over to 
the Revolutionary Guards, Iran would no longer be able to deny 
any connection to this affair. 
  Approximately one month ago, in the framework of a 
conference 
in Bucharest, I asked Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar 
Velayati why Iran continued to hold navigator Ron Arad prisoner? 
  [Begin recording] [Segal, in English] Why is your country, 
Iran, still holding the Israeli POW Ron Arad? 
  [Velayati, in English] I do not know how much this is 
related to the present discussion that we have, but I 
catagorically deny that there is any prisoner from Israel in 
Iran. 
  Jerusalem says that last night's operation proves to the 
Israeli people and all the families that the IDF [Israel Defense 
Forces] and the government continue their efforts. The soldiers 
risked their lives and carried out a raid against a tough target 
hundreds of kilometers from Israel in a difficult area under 
Syrian control north of the Beirut-Damascus road. Officials in 
Jerusalem said that this proved that Israel was doing everything 
to help its soldiers held captive behind enemy lines.

  [Text] The cabinet was given a detailed report on the 
commando operation [to abduct Mustafa al-Dirani], the reasons 
for it, and its planning. Speaking on behalf of the cabinet, 
Prime Minister Rabin praised the defense forces and the chief of 
staff. On another issue, security officials told the cabinet 
the Palestinian police force and administration face serious 
problems in establishing their authority. Jack Katzenell 
reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Katzenell] Now that the euphoria 
surrounding the arrival of the Palestinian police is over, the 
new leadership has to cope with the drab reality of raising 
funds to pay salaries, a security official told the cabinet. 
There is a shortage of trained personnel, weapons, food, 
vehicles, and above all money to pay the salaries, the official 
said. Nabil Sha'th brought a few hundred thousands dollars when 
he made a brief visit to the Gaza Strip last week. Arab mayors 
have been holding fund-raising drives, and Israel is paying the 
salaries of 37,000 Civil Administration employees up to the end 
of this month. But Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said the 
money contributed so far by the donor countries is much less 
than what they promised. In the ruling council for the 
autonomy, portfolios have not yet been distributed, and this is 
making it more difficult to organize the new administration. 
The Palestinian police have called on the population not to 
carry arms in the streets. In some parts of the Gaza Strip the 
police have begun planning the collection of weapons from the 
population. But Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] has warned 
that it will not hand in its weapons, and the Popular Front of 
George Habash says it will not give up its weapons so long as 
Israeli soldiers or settlers are present anywhere in the 
territories. 
  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin again warned that Israel 
expects 
the Palestinian police to make sure that armed terrorists do not 
enter Israel. So long as the security problem is not solved the 
total closure of the Gaza Strip will continue, Rabin warned. 
  Minister of Commerce and Industry Mikha Harish said clearly 
the PLO has an interest in showing that it can impose order in 
Gaza and Jericho, and Israel is prepared to wait for a while: 
  [Harish] This process will be tested in a few weeks. If 
there is going to be a serious progress in a few weeks then we 
know that we are in the right track. 
  [Katzenell] If not? 
  [Harish] If not, then the agreement is collapsing, and they 
are aware of that. 
  [Katzenell] The cabinet was told that the Fatah Hawks and 
other local Palestinians who were on the wanted list are 
disappointed, because they have not been incorporated in the new 
police force or administration. Former policemen who resigned 
at the beginning of the intifadah have not been reenlisted, and 
feel they have been discriminated against relative to the 
newcomers from the diaspora. [end recording]

  [Text] The address at the Johannesburg mosque by PLO 
Chairman Yasir 'Arafat causes doubt regarding his intention to 
keep the agreement with Israel. A tape of his address contains 
remarks in which he says that the fate of the agreement signed 
with Israel will be similar to that of the agreement Prophet 
Muhammad signed with the Quiraish Tribe. Professor Moshe 
Sharon, an expert on the history of Islam, explains that 
Muhammad signed a nonbelligerency agreement with the tribe which 
was in control of Mecca. But two years later he violated the 
agreement, conquered Mecca, and killed the leaders of the tribe. 
The segment of the tape was given to our correspondent Gil 
Litman. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1005 GMT on 22 May 
carries a similar report by Gil Litman that includes the 
following recorded passage in English from the address by 
'Arafat: "And I am sure, sooner or later, we will pray in 
Jerusalem together. This agreement, I am not considering it 
more than the agreement which had been signed between our 
Prophet Muhammad and Quiraish." Prof. Sharon says in the report 
that "this set a legal Muslim precedent, according to which you 
sign an agreement with the enemy when it suits you, and you 
violate it when you can. That is to say: Any agreement between 
Muslims and non-Muslims can be violated when it is convenient 
for the Muslim party." 
  [Quoting further from the recording, Litman says that 
'Arafat 
made the following remark: "There is no permanent state named 
Israel."]

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Shim'on Schiffer] </F>
  [Excerpts] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin is demanding that 
Yasir 'Arafat again pledge, in writing, to keep the agreement 
the parties signed in Cairo and meet all the undertakings he 
assumed in the Declaration of Principles and the agreement 
between Israel and the PLO on their mutual recognition . 
  Rabin instructed Deputy Chief of Staff Amnon Shahaq to 
contact Nabil Sha'th in Cairo and ask that 'Arafat clarify the 
remarks he made in Johannesburg several days ago. 'Arafat had 
said that he does not intend to honor the agreement, following 
the example of Prophet Muhammad in the agreement he made with 
the Quiraish Tribe. 
  'Arafat's remarks were aired on Qol Yisra'el yesterday and 
caused great anger at the prime minister's bureau. [passage 
omitted] 
  Coming out of yesterday's cabinet session, Israeli ministers 
expressed concern over the situation in the Palestinian 
self-administration. 
  Minister Amnon Rubinstein expressed the hope that the PLO 
leader will find the time to deal with the important issues and 
will stop his globe-trotting in order to deal with the self-rule. 
  Minister Yosi Sarid spoke in the Palestinians' behalf, 
saying 
that one cannot expect them to seize control of the security 
situation in the Gaza Strip, especially in view of the fact that 
Israel did not manage to control the events there in its 27 
years of rule. 
  [Tel Aviv MA'ARIV in Hebrew on 23 May carries a report on 
page 2 by Hemi Shalev and Shefi Gabay, adding: "Israel has 
decided to freeze the next stage of the peace talks with the 
Palestinians until the situation in the Gaza Strip stabilizes 
and until there is proof that the Palestinians are able to 
handle security matters in the areas under their control. This 
was reported by senior political sources in Jerusalem last 
night." The report adds, however, that government officials 
"are impressed by the Palestinian commanders' seriousness and by 
what appears to be an attempt on their part to deal with the 
centers of terror."] 
  After the session, cabinet ministers added that Prime 
Minister Rabin's remark that the murder of Israelis in the 
territories is the result of the Israeli occupation is a very 
extreme utterance and has never been said before by any Israeli 
prime minister. 
  In other words, the ministers were amazed by the remark and 
said they would never even consider making such a sweeping 
statement. 
  Minister Shim'on Shetrit said that the Israelis who are 
still 
being hurt by Palestinians are neither the victims of peace nor 
the victims of Israel's rule over a foreign nation; rather, they 
are the victims of the PLO's and 'Arafat's failure to fulfill 
their commitments and the agreement they had signed.

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin says he will demand 
from Yasir 'Arafat to reaffirm in writing his commitment to the 
peace agreement signed earlier this month. 'Oded Ben-'Ami, the 
prime minister's spokesman, said that 'Arafat's speech in 
Johannesburg casts doubts on his sincerity with regard to the 
peace agreement. Ben-'Ami noted that Israel will put off the 
negotiations on the second stage of the agreement with the 
Palestinians until the PLO consolidates its rule in Gaza and 
Jericho. 
  In response, PLO member Jamil al-Tarifi said that any delay 
in the implementation of the next stage of the autonomy will 
constitute a deviation from the agreement.

  [Text] Environment Minister Yosi Sarid has warned that if 
Yasir 'Arafat does not retract his remarks on honoring 
agreements, Israel will not abide by the accord. Sarid, who has 
been closely involved in the autonomy negotiations, says that 
'Arafat's statements in the Johannesburg mosque earlier this 
month on signing agreements has created a crisis of confidence. 
The PLO leader, Sarid said, must declare his statements there 
null and void and reaffirm his total commitment to the peace 
process, in particular his support for a determined and open 
fight against terror. The environment minister was interviewed 
by Qol Yisra'el reporter Shulamit Schmerling during a visit to 
Haifa.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Ed for the Prosecution"] </F>
  [Text] The resignation of U.S. Ambassador to Israel Edward 
Djerejian is an expression of no confidence resounding like a 
slap in the faces of President Bill Clinton and Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher. The Clinton administration's foreign 
policy is currently under attack from all directions, mainly the 
Republican direction. Key officials of the previous 
administration -- President Bush, Defense Secretary Cheney, and 
Secretary of State Baker -- restrained themselves for several 
months. Nevertheless, with Clinton entering his second year in 
office and with the election season approaching -- congressional 
elections this year and presidential elections soon -- these 
former officials placed themselves at the spearhead of the 
onslaught on Clinton's and Christopher's hesitant and stuttering 
international conduct, from Korea, to Haiti, to Bosnia. 
  Djerejian's notice that he is abandoning his post only four 
months after assuming it is a double blow. First, because he 
did not opt for a fat salary but is going to work for 
Christopher's negative image -- James Baker. Second, because 
his resignation makes one of the few areas in the world that 
Clinton and his aides portray as an American success -- the 
Arab-Israeli peace process -- look like a failure. 
  The intrigues among the members of the team that was 
supposed 
to help Clinton and Christopher promote the process have been 
clearly visible for a long time. Djerejian, a former ambassador 
in Damascus and a Baker loyalist ever since he served as White 
House deputy spokesman for foreign affairs in the Reagan 
administration, was sidetracked despite the fact that 
Christopher kept him on as assistant secretary of state for 
Middle Eastern affairs. Dennis Ross, another aide to Baker 
during Bush's presidential campaign and at the State Department, 
survived and became closer to Christopher, at the expense of 
Djerejian and his no-less-competent successor Robert Pelletreau. 
Pelletreau decided to settle for and focus on the other half of 
his area of responsibility -- the Persian Gulf. Djerejian, who 
spent only four months in office here, decided that, since 
Christopher and Ross compartmentalized him out of the 
Israel-Syria track -- the main track of the process and his area 
of expertise -- there was no point in him staying on here. 
  The resignation is regrettable because the Americans would 
have done better to give up on Christopher and his "peace team" 
than on Djerejian. The continuing weakness of the Tel Aviv 
Embassy started after the important years of Sam Lewis and Tom 
Pickering. The Bush administration sent the two Williams -- 
Brown and Harrop -- here. Clinton sent Brown as acting 
ambassador once again, and eventually sent Djerejian, but did 
not use him properly. Djerejian joins a list of senior defense 
and foreign affairs officials from the Clinton administration 
who resigned or were fired with a loud slam of the door: Deputy 
Secretary of State Wharton, Defense Secretary Aspin, defense 
secretary designate Inman, and Presidential Envoy to Haiti 
Pezzullo. 
  The general impression is one of a crumbling administration. 
It is an U.S. problem, but it is also a global and mainly a 
regional problem because without U.S. encouragement, the peace 
process will be delayed for several more crucial months. It 
seems that Djerejian chose not to be on the failing team. This, 
however, is not necessarily the end of his involvement in 
foreign affairs in general and Israel-Arab affairs in 
particular: Should the Republicans return to power and Baker 
get a say on policies and appointments, it is reasonable to 
assume that Djerejian may return to a yet higher position at the 
State Department or on the National Security Council.

CSO 

  [Text] Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Division. The 
Majles met yesterday chaired by Dr. Rowhani, and the deputies 
from the cities of Khaf, Ahar, Marivan, Ahvaz, Shadegan, and 
Lanjan gave speeches. At yesterday's session the general form of 
the motion to consolidate the industrial ministries into one 
ministry was approved almost unanimously by the deputies. 
Summaries of the remarks of some supporters and opponents for 
this motion were printed in yesterday's newspaper. We now direct 
the attention of our esteemed readers to the detailed 
proceedings. 
<H5>  Habibollah Habibi, Deputy From Khaf And Rashtkhar </H5>
  Social justice and economic and judicial security must be 
secured for all the people. 
  The first preagenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles 
session was Habibi, deputy from Khaf and Rashtkhar. He offered 
congratulations on the new year and said: It is obedience to the 
guidance from the vice regent of the Muslims that allows us to 
hold our heads up high in the world today and has made our 
foreign policy so decisive and uncompromising towards any type 
of imperialism. We have become known throughout the world was an 
anti-imperialist center. 
  He also said: Our combative and proud nation, with its firm 
beliefs in the principles of the revolution, is today a refuge 
for all the arisen nations. 
  From the most remote part of Africa to the heart of Europe, 
from the tormented people of Bosnia to the combatants of Muru 
[as published], from the brave combatants of Palestine and 
Lebanon to the anti-imperialist factions in South America, the 
eyes of all are fixed on Iran, this Islamic center. 
  Continuing, the speaker added: The exalted leader's 
decisiveness, not only in foreign policy but also in every 
detail of domestic policy, must guide the entire nation, 
especially the officials and government leaders. Social justice 
and economic and judicial security must be secured for all the 
people. 
  He discussed the fact that in many areas of life and 
society, 
we have not been successful carrying out a proper and correct 
plan. He said: Excessive price increases, improper economic 
inflation, and the rising price of foreign exchange are the 
topics of the day in every circle. 
He also discussed the fact that officials should bring about 
financial ease and security. He said: Today great strides have 
been taken to bring about domestic security, protect land and 
water borders and reinforce military and police forces, and our 
land is no longer vulnerable. The power of the military and 
mobilization forces, which still come from the heart of the 
revolution, will defeat any kind of aggression from any 
aggressor. 
  Continuing, the speaker said: Many steps have been taken to 
maintain security in the eastern and southern parts of Khorasan, 
but if economic and judicial security and decisiveness do not 
exist in political and social matters and if the people are 
worried, all that effort to maintain security cannot have the 
desired results. 
  Habibi discussed the fact that unfortunately his electoral 
district has not benefited well from the implementation of this 
plan. He said: Regrettably I must say that in some sectors we 
have begun to fall behind and stop progressing. An example is a 
great task such as the Khaf Sangan iron mines, with reserves of 
322 million tons and an average assay of 50 percent. These mines 
were visited during a recent trip to the province of Khorasan by 
the president of the republic, who issued the necessary orders 
to equip them and get them started. Unfortunately, however, due 
to the lack of sufficient credits the mines are not operating 
and 250 workers are idle, adding to the region's unemployment. 
In view of the cultural poverty and the fact that the area 
borders on the Muslim country of Afghanistan, there is a 
pronounced need for cultural and educational programs, 
especially in education and training, culture and Islamic 
guidance, and this should receive special attention from the 
officials. 
  Continuing, he added: Sufficient attention is not being 
given 
to road-building programs. Late in the month of Esfand [20 
February - 19 March], eight people lost their lives on the road 
from Torbat-e Heydariyeh to Rashtkhar because floods had washed 
away the bridge over the river. I ask the Ministry of Roads and 
Transportation, the Ministry of Education and Training, the 
Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance, and the Ministry of 
Mines and Metals to give more attention to these important 
matters. 
  The speaker also said: In view of the size and population of 
the province of Khorasan, especially the sacred city of Mashhad, 
which receives 12 million pilgrims per year, the distribution of 
national and province credits is unjust compared to the nation's 
other provinces. 
  In conclusion he then said: I thank and praise the 
management 
and other province officials for doing what they could to draw 
credits in the year 1372 [21 March 1993 - 20 March 1994], and I 
ask the Ministry of the Interior to take serious and rapid 
measures to divide the province, which is the desire of the 
province's deputies. 
<H5>  Valiollah Ahmadi Zadsaray, Deputy From Ahar </H5>
  The next speaker was Zadsaray, deputy from Ahar. He offered 
congratulations on the new year and said: Since the beginning of 
the triumph of the Islamic revolution, the Great Satan, 
world-devouring America, has not relented for an instant in its 
hostility to Islam and the revolution, and has plotted openly 
and secretly against Islam and our Islamic nation. It has used 
military attacks and economic embargos to cause problems for the 
Islamic Republic of Iran, and its intention is to destroy the 
revolution, but through the strength of divine power and the 
prophetic guidance of the late Imam and the exalted leader, it 
has been frustrated and has had its hopes dashed every day. 
  Continuing, Zadsaray thanked the minister of agriculture for 
visiting the projects under way in the deprived areas of Ahar 
and Hashtgerd, he thanked the president of the republic for 
financial assistance starting the Free Islamic University, he 
thanked the deputy minister of the interior for development for 
visiting Ahar and Haris, and he thanked the governor-general of 
East Azarbaijan for dealing with the problems of the people from 
his electoral district. 
<H5>  Mohammad 'Ali Karimi, Deputy From Marivan </H5>
  To move ahead in our work this year, we deputies and 
executive officials must act in accordance with the exalted 
leader's orders. 
  The next speaker was Karimi, deputy from Marivan. In his 
speech he discussed the plots by world imperialism against the 
Islamic Republic of Iran. He said: It is incumbent upon those of 
us who want to have the Islam of Mohammad to use our effort and 
power in any way possible to frustrate the filthy plots of world 
imperialism, especially world-devouring America and usurper 
Israel, and to make them regret their shameful acts forever. 
  He asked the government to think about a solution for the 
vulnerable classes so they will no longer be subjected to the 
pressures of life, inflation and high prices and so they will be 
able more easily to obtain what they need. 
  He added: It is incumbent upon us deputies to make more 
effort in this area and to take positive and effective steps to 
make life easier for the ever-present-on-the-scene people. To 
move ahead in our work this year, we deputies and executive 
officials must act in accordance with the exalted leader's 
orders. In his New Year's message he said: In the year 1373 [21 
March 1994-20 March 1995], let there be a work ethic and social 
order. 
  At all times and under all circumstances, the Council of 
Ministers and the nation's executive officials must think of the 
peace of mind and the lives of the people, and they must guide 
the nation's economy in view of the fact that our country is 
like most developing nations. 
  The deputy from Marivan thanked the president of the 
republic 
for his attention to Sunni brothers and clergymen, and he also 
praised the governor-general of Kordestan for attending to the 
demands of the area's people. 
  Continuing, Karimi issued memos to the minister of roads and 
transportation, the minister of petroleum, the minister of labor 
and social affairs, the minister of culture and higher 
education, and the minister of housing and urban construction 
concerning asphalting the roads from Marivan to Sanandaj and 
Marivan to Saqz, providing gas service to Marivan, creating 
employment for unemployed people, establishing the Payam-e Nur 
University, whose preliminary steps have been taken, and 
beginning the project to build the Marivan hospital. 
  He also asked for help and cooperation from the minister of 
agriculture; the minister of the reconstruction crusade; and the 
minister of energy concerning the timely transfer of 
agricultural entities to farmers, putting the destroyed wells of 
Marivan back into operation, and providing electrical power to 
the rural areas. He asked for help and cooperation from the 
minister of the interior; the minister of education and 
training; the minister of health care, treatment and medical 
education; the minister or economic and social affairs; and the 
chief of the Central Bank in alleviating the problem of idleness 
among the residents of the border strip rural areas; issuing 
authorization to conduct development and service projects; 
paying unpaid wartime overtime wages to teachers; dealing with 
the malfunctions and the situation at Allahu Akbar Hospital; and 
providing low-profit interest-free loans to the exalted families 
of martyrs, wounded war veterans, and former prisoners of war to 
procure housing. 
<H5>  Seyyed Mohammad Reza Movalizade, Deputy From Ahvaz </H5>
  Human rights are not observed in any country as much as they 
are observed in the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
  The fourth pregenda speaker was Movalizadeh, deputy from 
Ahvaz. He discussed the anniversary of cutting political 
relations with America. He said: Applying the valuable guidance 
from the leader of the revolution concerning attention to the 
work ethic and social order will undoubtedly play an important 
role in creating change in the activities of our agents and 
reforming as much as possible the social relations in our 
growing society. 
  He commemorated the martyrdom anniversary of the basiji 
artist Avini. He said: Based on existing statistics, the 
government was successful in many areas during the First 
Five-Year Plan. It is hoped that during the Second Five-Year 
Plan the problems will be overcome in such areas as employment, 
providing housing for low-income people, reforming the 
administrative structure and increasing nonoil exports. 
  There is no doubt that collecting taxes from the prosperous 
classes is strong leverage for redistributing wealth in society 
and creating social justice. It is completely clear that whoever 
has more income should pay more taxes. Doing this requires 
decisiveness, avoiding condescension and caution, and a 
revolutionary spirit. In this regard I ask the minister of 
economic and financial affairs to make every effort to reform 
the nation's tax system. 
  Continuing, he said: Approving the general form of the 
Consumer Rights Protection Bill should open the door to serious 
economic support for the deprived and vulnerable classes. Those 
who sell at high prices must fear the sharp sword of the law, 
and no one must permit himself to fan the flames of unreasonable 
and unregulated inflation. Today our society has a sharp thirst 
for government decisiveness dealing with the economic 
terrorists. I ask the Government of Saudi Arabia to scrupulously 
observe the provisions of the treaty signed with the Islamic 
Republic of Iran in the year 1370 [21 March 1991-20 March 1992], 
and not to increase the burden of its sin any further by 
sabotaging implementation of this divine duty. Human rights are 
not observed in any country as much as they are observed in the 
Islamic Republic of Iran. 
  Continuing, Movalizade noted: It is most regrettable that 
the 
secretary-general of the United Nations has forgotten the 
credibility of his position and has become a listless, dependent 
tool of criminal America. With his weak approaches to 
international problems, every day he brings this organization 
closer to collapse and destruction. 
  He said the Government of Armenia is the main cause of the 
crash of the Iranian aircraft. He said: This country must offer 
the international organizations an explanation and an apology 
for committing these crimes and it must pay the necessary 
reparations. 
  Noting that nothing new was said at the 50th meeting of the 
Gulf Cooperation Council, he said: In the face of the repetition 
of the vain claims of the past, we must state once more that 
according to reputable international documents and evidence, the 
three Iranian islands are undeniably part of the soil of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran, and that we will act whenever and 
wherever necessary to protect and guard every inch of our sacred 
soil, just as we did during the eight-year defense against the 
invasion of the Ba'thist occupiers. 
  He added: The Government of Turkey must realize that it 
cannot suppress the rightful demands of Muslims with threats and 
fear, which were expressed in the mayoral elections. The period 
of leaning to the West and the spread of secular thinking in the 
Islamic lands has long since come to an end. 
  The deputy from Ahvaz expressed thanks for the efforts of 
the 
health care and treatment workers of the province of Khuzestan 
and he asked the minister of health care and treatment to help 
as much as possible to make use of the experience of these dear 
retired people. 
  In conclusion he asked the minister of roads and 
transportation to deal with the province's malfunctioning roads. 
<H5>  'Isa Moqadamizad, Deputy From Shadegan </H5>
  Moqadamizad was another preagenda speaker. During his speech 
he offered congratulations on the new year. He said: Every day 
we see the publication of various and numerous magazines and 
publications by the executive organizations, and if the matter 
is studied carefully, it will be seen that their readers are 
very few. The result is nothing other than wasting of the public 
treasury. I ask the president of the republic to give the 
required order in this regard. 
  Continuing, he said: Unfortunately in some offices and 
institutions sabotage, working too little and bribery are on the 
increase every day, and this kind of illicit behavior will make 
the sacrificing people pessimistic, anxious and uncomfortable. I 
ask that the violators be dealt with seriously and decisively. 
  He then said: In view of the lack of water in the province 
of 
Khorasan, the effects of drought such as the lack of feed and 
the drying of fields are evident in most of the province's 
municipalities. The minister of the interior and the minister of 
the reconstruction crusade must take the necessary steps to 
compensate for these losses. 
  The deputy from Shadegan then offered thanks for the visit 
from the President's Council of Payam-e Nur University with 
regard to the establishment of this university in Shadegan. 
<H5>  Mohsen Kuhkan, Deputy From Lanjan (Zarrinshahr) and Mobarakeh </H5>
  I remind the Ministry of Post and Telegraph that any 
violation of Majles legislation will meet with a legal response 
from the Majles. 
  The final preagenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles 
session was Kuhkan, deputy from Lanjan (Zarrinshahr) and 
Mobarakeh. During his speech he said: These days coincide with 
the anniversary of cutting relations with world-devouring 
America, this oppressive government, which is the greatest 
supporter of terrorism, and is indeed itself a terrorist 
government, a government that uses human rights as a pretext to 
commit the greatest crimes against the rights of the oppressed 
and against human societies such as the Muslims of Palestine, 
Bosnia and Herzegovina and other parts of the world. 
  Continuing, Kuhkan issued memos to the nation's executive 
officials. He said: At the beginning of the year 1373 the 
exalted leader called for a "work ethic" and "social order." The 
nation's executive officials must answer that call by exercising 
more supervision, implementing policies of encouragement and 
punishment, and expediting administrative reform in the country 
in such a way that it reduces the size of the administrative 
organizations and reinforces the spirit of commitment and taking 
the part of the people. 
  The speaker also said: Just as the exalted leader said 
concerning the Five-Year Plan and the 1372 [21 March 1993-20 
March 1994] Budget Bill, privatizing is not a goal, although we 
are emphasizing doing it quickly, properly and strongly, unless 
the nation's executive managers are careful to have the 
resources used in this way and the facilities transferred serve 
the purpose of encouraging and starting work, rather than, God 
forbid, having a large unrestricted portion of the Muslim 
treasury be siphoned into the pockets of a few people. 
  Kuhkan said our own forces have done very good things to 
help 
the Islamic nation rebuild and achieve self-sufficiency. He 
said: These positive measures must be mentioned and those 
involved must be thanked and praised. 
  He reminded the management of some industrial centers in the 
municipalities of Lanjan and Mobarakeh, who have not given 
enough attention to helping the adjoining area. He said: Just as 
the president of the republic emphasized in his trip of 1371 [21 
March 1992-20 March 1993], these centers should help solve some 
of the problems in the municipalities. I expect measures to be 
taken quickly to secure the views of the president of the 
republic and the people of the region. 
  Continuing, Kuhkan added: For some time in the province of 
Esfahan we have seen trips abroad being made by people who 
themselves should be advising others to be careful about the 
economic affairs of Muslims. I hope these trips were not purely 
for recreation and God forbid that the sponsors for some of the 
trips were not the region's industrial centers and management. 
  At the end of his speech the deputy from Zarrinshahr and 
Mobarakeh said: Just as the deputies know, in the 1373 budget 
law we have given authorization according to the law to some 
executive organizations to raise prices on some services and 
goods. It is appropriate that I remind the Ministry of Post and 
Telegraph that Majles legislation concerning postal expenses 
limits increases to 50 percent of the rates for the year 1372, 
and no more. Concerning telephone communications, as far as I 
know, each telephone signal is no more than three minutes, but 
it seems that two and one-half minutes has been calculated for 
the year 1373. On the one hand the base price for an increase of 
2, 3, and 4 rials [R] as given in Paragraph J, Note 25 is R10, 
and what has been announced is more than that. What the Majles 
has approved and enacted and what has also been approved by the 
Guardian Council must be the basis of the work and it must be 
precisely implemented. The slightest violation of Majles 
legislation will definitely meet with a legal response from the 
Majles and the deputies. 
<H5>  Legislation </H5>
<H5>  Deputy From Minab's Question to Former Minister of the </H5>
Interior 
  The first item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles 
session was the report from the Articles 88 and 90 Commission 
concerning the deputy from Minab's question to the former 
minister of the interior on the procedures for the research and 
expert work that has been done to build the Minab River flood 
wall. 
  The commission's view concerning the aforementioned 
question: 
  In view of the fact that in his answer to the respected 
deputy from Minab the respected former minister of the interior 
said that the expert work on the aforementioned project was done 
by the Satiran Company, and on the other hand that the 
aforementioned company announced that it was not present at any 
stage of the project's study, planning, supervision or 
construction, and also in view of the report from the inspector 
sent there who announced that the planning was not done by the 
Satiran Company and that the Luzan Company, which the former 
minister of the interior said was the project's executor, has no 
background in this area, the commission therefore finds the 
answer unsatisfactory. 
<H5>  Motion To Consolidate Ministries of Industry </H5>
  The second item on the agenda was the report from the first 
consultation of the Joint Administrative and Employment Affairs 
and Industries and Mines Commission Concerning the Motion To 
Consolidate the Ministries of Industry, the Ministry of Heavy 
Industries, and the Ministry of Mines and Metals and to form a 
Ministry of Industries and Mines. 
  After a talk by Mr. Rashidi, representative of the joint 
commission, supporters and opponents of the motion spoke, most 
of whose remarks were published in yesterday's issue. As the 
session continued, Qabal Qashqavi spoke in opposition to the 
consolidation. He said: So far we have not had and do not have 
any problem with the structure of industry and we have had no 
motions or bills to solve this problem. In my view the position 
and responsibilities of industry in our country have been 
specified and there has been no overlap anywhere. 
  He then said: In the Second Five-Year Plan let us authorize 
responsibilities and specify complexes that the government 
should create, and after those responsibilities are carried out, 
let us create an administrative structure. 
  Qashqavi also added: Between you and me, is the discussion 
of 
transfers a discussion about consolidation and nonconsolidation, 
or is it a discussion about motivations and other issues? Even 
if you do not have the motivation of privatization, the 
consolidation still will not succeed. 
  Ramazanpur was the next supporter of consolidating the 
ministries of industry. During his speech he said: When we 
discuss the performance of an industrial ministry, we must 
determine its role in elevating the level of manpower, 
developing technology and developing the country. It is entirely 
regrettable that I must say that based on the report from the 
Statistics Organization, 97.5 percent of our work force lacks 
specialist credentials. We want to fight world imperialism 
through economic development. Can this development grow with 
this manpower composition in industry? 
  He then said: Today our nation is determined to be 
independent. What products do we produce right now? The nation's 
customs statistics are nothing at all to be proud of for any 
Iranian. In the year 1371 we had about $29 billion in registered 
import orders. We must look to see where we are. What is the 
level of our industrial exports? The ministers of industry must 
answer that question. He then said: The more we delay this 
motion, the more problems we will have with the fate of the 
Councils Law. Approval of this motion is therefore a national 
necessity. 
  Sadatian was another of the bill's opponents. After the 
recess he said in his remarks: In this regard one must consider 
the government's executive capability. Today does the government 
itself have enough executive ability to carry out this 
consolidation, or will it excuse itself? The year 1373 is a 
difficult year for us in terms of oil revenues. Why do we want 
to create an executive problem for ourselves this year? 
  He added: I myself am in favor of reforming the nation's 
administrative structure. What we are saying is that at a time 
when the government is not ready to do this, if we want to 
impose that task, we will only impose added pressure and 
disruption. 
  Then Ahmad Nateq-Nuri spoke in favor of the aforementioned 
bill. He said: The Majles is doing this precisely for the 
purpose of carrying out infrastructure work. Between the First 
and Second Five-Year Plans, when we have an interval of time, if 
this is not the time to do this, then when will be the right 
time? This is precisely the time when we should reform the 
nation's administrative structure and base the Second Five-Year 
Plan on that. 
  He added: The three ministers themselves said this task 
should be done at the end of the First Five-Year Plan. 
Therefore, now is the best time to do this. Now the Hapco 
Company [as published], which belongs to the Ministry of Heavy 
Industries, builds the heavy machinery, and on the other hand 
the Ministry of Industries imports these machines, which are 
piled up at Bandar 'Abbas. We want to stand on our own feet in 
industry. We also proposed that all offices outside the country 
be centralized. 
  The final opponent was Mr. Luruzadeh. During his talk on 
this 
subject he said: Consolidation of the industrial ministries will 
mean centralized policy making. My question, however, is when 
will one minister be able to make policy? If it works the way 
things have been going and the prevailing system remains in use, 
each person will carry out his own special responsibilities 
wherever he is placed. If the government and the Majles set 
customs duties, taxes and commercial profits fees in such a way 
that the domestic sector can compete with foreigners, it 
certainly will not be economical for that gentleman to import 
earth grading machinery. 
  We are not opposed to the term consolidation, but there 
needs 
to be a basis for this. 
  Ansari also spoke as the final supporter. He said: When are 
we going to lay the groundwork for consolidation? This 
groundwork was laid during the First Five-Year Plan. To discuss 
research for industrial development, we need three tools 
(manpower, knowledge, and technology). We will have knowledge 
and technology when we are able to invest in research. Dividing 
these three ministries works against this goal. We have not been 
able to work well in the area of industrial research. 
<H5>  Government's View of Consolidation </H5>
  Mohajerani, the government's representative, said: first of 
all, the question of reforming the structure of the government 
is not something anyone opposes. The question is, how, when, 
under what conditions, with what goals, and using what procedure? 
  To consolidate we need criteria and standards which must be 
fully evaluated, so no problem will be created. 
  Continuing, he added: The question of the work of mines, 
metals, geology, exploration and extracting copper and steel is 
one thing, the question of the work of light and heavy industry 
is something else. Of course, all of these come under the 
general heading of industry, just as soccer, volleyball, and 
basketball all involve the use of a ball. With the common 
element of a ball, one cannot combine all these games and 
proceed easily. That is, in practice boundaries must be kept in 
mind. 
  He also said: For consolidation, one must pay attention to 
appropriate growth and the necessary readiness. With regard to 
mines, metals and heavy industry, because they are younger and 
their structures are easier to reform, this work has been done, 
and the organizational positions at the province centers have 
been minimized. 
  Continuing, the government's representative also said: Among 
the things talked about in the government was the fact that 
consolidation does not mean we can consolidate these ministries 
with a bill, but let us not get into the issue of quality 
concerning this task. The goal is not to perpetuate the status 
quo under the same conditions and with increasing numbers of 
deputy ministers. The goal is a single organizational structure. 
  He said: Until these industries are transferred to the 
private sector, it will not be possible to bring this entire 
complex into one organizational structure. That is, the entire 
body of the ministries must also be reformed. The government 
representative discussed the fact that transferring parts of the 
ministries to the nongovernment sector has not had the necessary 
success. He said: Some countries who have fewer ministries or 
more ministries are worth studying with regard to government 
management of industry. 
  He then added: We know from experience that as soon as the 
subject of consolidation arises, there is a kind of insecurity, 
and in any case a state of disturbance develops in these staffs 
and we will have a state of near shutdown in the most sensitive 
sector. We are in such a hurry to consolidate that we do not 
want to wait until the Second Five-Year Plan is approved to 
understand the extent of consolidation and then begin. 
  As the government, we do not consider it in our interest to 
discuss consolidation in this way before the Second Five-Year 
Plan. 
  The commission representative noted that the views of the 
opposition deputies and the government representative can be 
summarized in several points: One is that we should wait for the 
Second Five-Year Plan. The second is that the intermediate 
industries may become dominant. The third is that there is no 
cooperation and unity and that this is a precipitous plan. 
  The commission representative said that the government has 
become small and lean and that for some time since the division 
of these ministries there has been the problem of which ministry 
to put an industry in. He said: That is, these industries have 
been so mixed together and fused into one that they have not 
been able to separate them. 
  He discussed the fact that the joint commission has voted 
unanimously for this proposal. He said: The Administrative and 
Employment Affairs Commission, which is now working on the 
government's enormous organizations, is 100 percent in favor of 
this consolidation. 
  He discussed the points of overlap. It is very strange if we 
say there is no unity and cooperation among these ministries. 
They were one, and because of the interests of the revolution 
they were separated for a time. Now they are to be consolidated, 
and there was really nothing about them to be separated. 
  Then a secret vote was taken by paper ballot with 171 votes 
in favor, 18 votes opposed, and 10 abstentions. Five deputies 
also did not vote, and in the end the general form of the Bill 
to Consolidate the Ministries of Industry was approved. 
<H5>  Bill Forming General and Revolutionary Courts </H5>
  The final item on the agenda was the report from the second 
consultation of the Judicial Affairs Commission concerning the 
Bill To Form General and Revolutionary Courts, continued 
consideration of whose details was postponed to the next session.

CSO 

  [Text] Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Division. The 
Majles met in open session yesterday chaired by Dr. Rowhani and 
the deputies from the cities of Ardel, Tabriz, Qa'enat, Gonabad, 
and Qa'em Shahr and Savadkuh gave preagenda speeches. Then the 
Majles went into consultation, and we direct the attention of 
our esteemed readers to the detailed proceedings. 
<H5>  'Ali Yusefpur, Deputy From Ardel </H5>
  Excessive increases in products have unfortunately weakened 
the Postal Company. 
  The first preagenda speaker was Yusefpur, deputy from Ardel. 
During his speech he discussed the slaughter of Muslims by 
Western and especially American agents. He said: The 
international organizations, especially the United Nations, have 
closed their eyes to these vast crimes, and as time passes they 
are watching the destruction of the Muslim nation of Bosnia. In 
occupied Palestine, Egypt, and Algeria, although they are 
slaughtering the Muslims, unfortunately there is no sign of 
condemnation of the regimes dependent on the aforementioned 
countries. In Iran, however, when a few narcotics smugglers are 
condemned to death, these international organizations scream to 
high heaven. 
  He added: Since its inception, the United Nations has served 
the goals of the Western world-devourers, and during the tenure 
of Butrus-Ghali the credibility of this organization has 
completely disappeared among the oppressed nations. 
  Mr. Butrus-Ghali, you will live in infamy for closing your 
eyes this way to the slaughter of Muslims. 
  The speaker then discussed the Second Five-Year Plan. He 
said: Although the government has tried to consider the views of 
the exalted leader in the Plan Bill, the Majles deputies must 
put these policies at the top of their agenda. They must create 
work and expert groups until it is possible to approve the 
aforementioned policies in the form of an organized and workable 
plan. 
  Continuing, the deputy from Ardel discussed the paragraphs 
in 
the aforementioned plan. He said: It may be said with confidence 
and certainty that the government was very successful under the 
First Five-Year Plan in doing infrastructure work, but in my 
view, although some work was done under the First Five-Year Plan 
to privatize the government companies and reduce the size of the 
government's administrative structure, the work was not done 
quickly, and it did not produce change. 
  The very heavy vote by the deputies to consolidate the 
ministries of industry is a part of the demand by the Majles 
deputies to expedite administrative change, and God willing the 
government leaders will work to move ahead faster on this 
important matter. 
  He added: We want administrative structural reform on the 
Majles agenda in the form of a bill. Since the relevant 
organizations have taken no significant action since the 
completion of the First Five-Year Plan, the Majles deputies are 
obliged to present a bill on this matter. Clear and direct 
planning must be done in the Second Five-Year Plan in such a way 
that reform of the nation's administrative structure will 
proceed more quickly, and that privatization will be achieved in 
such a way that it is in the interest of the sacred government 
of the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
  Yusefpur then emphasized: In the last year or two some 
profiteering and opportunist individuals, with the support of 
naive individuals, have undertaken to represent American 
products, even as the Western nations are subjecting Iran to an 
embargo on advanced industrial products and while in France, 
which considers itself the cradle of freedoms in the West, they 
will not tolerate head coverings on school girls and are 
expelling them. 
  Then in revolution Iran a few profiteers and opportunists 
and 
a few naive people supporting them are permitting Coca-Cola, the 
products from General Electric and those of several other 
companies to be widely distributed. Gentlemen, don't you realize 
that Coca-Cola is the symbol of America and that they are trying 
to put up advertisements for this product on every street and in 
every quarter? If the producers of this product are telling the 
truth, why are they seeking only to produce and distribute 
consumer goods? If there is no hidden agenda behind what they 
are doing, if it is true as they say that their contract is with 
Ireland, then let them produce this beverage with Iran's name. 
  Just as the heroic Hezbollah did not allow MacDonald's 
sandwiches to be produced in Tehran, they will go to any lengths 
to prevent the production of Coca-Cola and other American 
products. 
  He discussed the provisions of the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 
March 1995] budget designed to resist high prices for government 
goods and services. He said: Unfortunately the Postal Company 
has made excessive increases in the prices of postal products. 
When the cost of mailing publications and books inside and 
outside the country has increased tenfold, how can the cultural 
institutions continue to operate? 
<H5>  Fatemeh Homayun-Moqadam, Deputy From Tabriz </H5>
  Unlike our country, in most of the European nations, women 
staff employees have no security. 
  The next speaker was Ms. Homayuni-Moqadam [as published], 
deputy from Tabriz. In her speech she said: In view of the 
hostility of the imperialist nations towards Islam and divine 
law, once again the Human Rights Commission has expressed 
unacceptable views concerning the rights of women in Iran. In 
general since the triumph of the Islamic revolution, women in 
Iran have achieved full human dignity under the commands of 
Islam, and this is unequaled in all the nations of the world. 
  She added: Statistics show that millions of girls are 
studying in the elementary schools and high schools and that 
hundreds of girl students and thousands of Iranian women are 
studying and doing research at high specialist levels, and these 
numbers are several times the figures prior to the revolution. 
The growth of our women in specialist medical fields, 
especially the women surgeons and midwives, is something to be 
proud of. At the same time, in most countries women work as 
nurses while male physicians treat women's ailments. To make up 
for the shortcomings of the past, the Majles must require the 
government to bring women physicians up to a sufficient level of 
quality in the gynecological surgery fields, and it must also 
require the Ministry of Health Care and Treatment to reserve at 
least 25 percent of its admissions for assistants in the 
surgery, neurology, urology, and other fields for women. 
  Ms. Moqadam then said: After the triumph of the Islamic 
revolution, a small number of the women, who had no social base 
because of not wearing the veil, served as slaves for 
imperialist plans. Now however, millions of Iranian women are 
involved in various political affairs. 
  While in some countries women's rights are one-half the 
rights of men, in our country there is no such difference 
between the rights of men and women in any office or factory. 
  In addition, women have special provisions to take time off 
and they can even ask to serve half-time with an appropriate 
salary. 
  In most of the European nations, women staff employees have 
no security, but it can be said with confidence that in our 
country no one feels insecure in any office. 
<H5>  Hoseyn Amini, Deputy From Qa'enat </H5>
  The important thing for the country to do to reduce its 
economic problems is to increase production and reduce 
consumption. 
  The next speaker was Amini, deputy from Qa'enat. During his 
speech he said: The First Five-Year Plan is ending at a time 
when economic and production projects have begun to move and 
investment has been done. 
  Continuing, he then added: The addition of 16,000 hospital 
beds and 6,000 health clinics; providing running water to more 
than 5,310 rural areas; increasing the capacities of factories; 
putting 80,000 new classes into operation and increasing the 
number of university students at the journeyman level and higher 
from 447,000 to 1.03 million; adding 5,200 megawatts to existing 
power plant capacities and providing electrical power to more 
than 6,000 rural areas; building 727 urban telephone centers, 
adding more than 1.7 million telephone numbers, adding 3,420 
rural telephone centers; and increasing the number of gas 
service lines from 750,000 to 1.9 million. In agriculture, 
increasing wheat production from 7 to 10.8 million tons; in 
industry, annual increases of 39.6 percent for steel, 25.2 
percent for copper, 16.6 percent for aluminum, 26.3 percent for 
heavy vehicles, 30 percent for light vehicles, 28 percent for 
road-building machinery, 42 percent for agricultural machinery, 
11.4 percent for tires, 17.4 percent for vegetable shortening, 
and 14.2 percent for other goods that there is no opportunity to 
discuss, are some of the results of the First Five-Year Plan. 
And it is necessary to praise and thank the president of the 
republic, the toiling government and all the insiders and 
executive officers. 
  Amini discussed the fact that one of the most important 
tasks 
for the Majles this year is to study and approve the Second 
Five-Year Plan. He said: It is hoped that using the experiences 
of the First Five-Year Plan and its strengths and weaknesses and 
with a realistic view, steps will be taken to solve existing 
problems, develop economic and cultural cooperation and 
prosperity, and to strengthen and perpetuate the government's 
political positions against foreigners. 
  Continuing, the speaker then discussed points that must be 
considered while studying and approving the Second Five-Year 
Plan. He said: These points include taking into account the 
guidance from the exalted leader concerning social justice and 
giving serious support to the oppressed classes, attention to 
the problems of the people, especially those who have 
sacrificed, preventing waste and extravagance in spending, 
employment and alleviating deprivation, attention to 
agriculture, policy making to improve quality, develop domestic 
production and increase exports, supervision of the 
implementation of programs, reinforcing the defense foundation, 
and continuation of the foreign policy based on glory, wisdom 
and interests. 
  In the same regard the speaker added: The important thing 
for 
the country to do to reduce its economic problems is to increase 
production and reduce consumption. In setting the needed laws 
and regulations in the Second Five-Year Plan, serious support 
must be given to production, and the existing obstacles to 
productive investment must be removed. A mechanism must be 
chosen that will divert loose money from the service sector and 
dependent and brokerage activity into production, and the 
banking system must serve the production system more than it 
does. 
  Concerning industry, he then added: The nation's industrial 
strategy must be specified and the basic point must be accepted 
that the most important issue is to make existing industries 
sound. This restoration to soundness means creating circles of 
communication between the domestic industrial sectors and 
between industries, basic industries and production activities. 
  He discussed the fact that investment must be diverted for 
several years to industries that are active producing raw 
materials, intermediate materials and conversion materials, and, 
to the extent possible, machinery and equipment for existing 
industries. He said: We must estimate revenue sources 
realistically, rather than in accordance with predetermined 
expenses. 
  Amini discussed tax reform and reducing dependence on oil 
revenues. He said: It is necessary to make basic changes in the 
tax system in the Second Five-Year Plan. The tax system must be 
made vigorous, effective, and in accordance with the goal of 
social justice, in such a way that it will give direction to 
economic activities. Instead of putting pressure on low-income 
people and small businessmen, it can collect the government's 
due from those who have enormous and sometimes inflated incomes. 
Currently taxes are not appropriate for the incomes of 
individuals, and those with huge incomes are shaking off the tax 
burden in various ways. 
  The deputy from Qa'enat discussed the need for serious 
attention to employment and preventing emigration, especially in 
the deprived areas. He said: Consideration must be given to 
expediting work in the education and training and research 
sectors and to developing technical and professional training, 
and the necessary attention must be given to the small 
agricultural conversion industries. 
  In conclusion, he discussed the problems in his electoral 
district. He issued memos concerning the distribution of 
national and province credits to the Plan and Budget 
Organization, to the Ministry of Petroleum concerning expediting 
gas delivery in the south of Khorasan, to the Ministry of 
Commerce concerning the purchase, packaging and export of 
saffron and barberry, and to the Ministry of Agriculture 
concerning the creation of a research station. He asked the 
president of the republic to issue the necessary orders to help 
the region's farmers, who have been hurt by the recent cold 
weather. 
<H5>  Mehdi Mehdizadeh, Deputy From Gonabad </H5>
  Limited resources and the correct economic viewpoint dictate 
that we economize on consumption. 
  The next speaker was Mehdizadeh, deputy from Gonabad. During 
his speech he discussed the drought in large parts of our 
country. He said: The deprived farmers in parts of Khorasan, 
where irreparable losses have recently been incurred because of 
the severe cold, whose orchards have been completely destroyed, 
have increasing problems, and if their situation is not dealt 
with soon and if their losses are not compensated, they will 
abandon their homes and farms and go elsewhere. 
  The speaker then discussed the situation of the people of 
Bosnia in the city of Gorazde. He said: This city, which has 
been declared secure from Serb attacks, has come to this state 
under UN supervision and with the direct cooperation of the 
Russians and with the cooperation of so-called civilized Western 
nations, including America. This is not the first time the 
aggressor has shown a happy face. Such an approach has been 
taken elsewhere before, including Palestine. We condemn these 
crimes, and we hope the Muslims will learn from this situation 
and awaken. 
  He said the Security Council should call the aggressor Serbs 
to account for their war crimes. Continuing, he said: Our 
country is in a good situation in terms of economic resources, 
but they are being used improperly in most cases. In many cases, 
not only have investments not been profitable in various 
sectors, they have not even recovered the capital. In many 
factories the abundance of various machines has filled up the 
space, yet the level of their profitable utilization is quite 
low. Most foreign specialists who have visited our factories are 
surprised to see that a factory, and an advanced one at that, 
produces simple products in limited numbers. He also said: 
Limited resources and the correct economic viewpoint dictate 
that we economize on consumption. It is clear that economizing 
does not mean reducing the level and quality of life. With 
proper economizing fewer resources are used, while the proper 
quality is retained. Many economists consider the reason for 
stagnation and inflation to be the low level of utilization. 
  Continuing, he said: Utilization means getting the most and 
at the same time the best use possible from the usable elements 
that have a role in the production of an item or the provision 
of a service, and the utilization coefficient is an indicator of 
this use. Today the economic growth of any society depends on 
the rate of the growth of utilization in that society. In the 
long run the importance of utilization in economic growth is 
much greater than the participation of the elements of capital 
and labor, and for this reason every country must try to make 
progress in utilization, in order to be able to expand its 
production with less consumption. This is the secret of success 
for any country. It is necessary to note that the rate of 
utilization in our country is low compared to that of other 
countries in many areas, and this must be corrected. 
  The speaker then discussed the population increase and the 
excessive use of natural resources. He said: The rapid 
population growth in the last 35 years has always been ahead of 
projects and plans, and it has disrupted their implementation 
and progress. During this period the nation's population has 
tripled, and it will reach 100 to 120 million in the next 25 to 
30 years. Those 40 million new members of society will need 8 
million homes, 1.5 million new educational units and many other 
things. Already one person is born every 17 seconds. At this 
rate, a new classroom will be needed every 15 minutes, every day 
16 new schools will be needed, and every year 25,000 classrooms 
will have to be built, yet the existing situation is very far 
from what is desired. 
  He also added: Fighting excessive population growth demands 
national and universal resolve; it is not the responsibility of 
an organization or a ministry. 
  He discussed forests and pastures. He said: Every year in 
our 
country 1 million hectares of pasture becomes desert, so that 
since the year 1341 [21 March 1962-20 March 1963] half our 
forests and pastures have been destroyed, and this process 
continues with the population increase and the lack of 
sufficient attention. 
  Continuing, the speaker said: In our country, due to 
insufficient precipitation and improper use of existing water 
resources, water has become vital. Most of the canals and wells 
have dried up due to the drop in water tables and many farms and 
rural areas are being destroyed. Rivers and coastal areas have 
become polluted, and due to the lack of plant cover, instead of 
being a blessing, in many cases rainfall causes flooding which 
destroys farms and towns. 
  Pressurized irrigation techniques, which produce a very high 
yield compared to traditional methods, have not come into 
general use, and in the cities excessive water use has created a 
problem for agriculture. Water, which is obtained at high cost 
using subsidies without being put to the best use, usually 
evaporates or soaks into the ground after being contaminated 
with chemicals and bacteria. 
  In addition to polluting the soil and converting 
agricultural 
land for residential use, population increases cause the 
destruction and erosion of productive soil because of excessive 
pressure on agricultural lands. In our country more than 1 
percent of agricultural lands and about 1.5 to 2 million cubic 
meters of soil is destroyed every year. The failure to prevent 
soil erosion could bring us to a bad end such as the one in 
Ethiopia, which has lost most of its productive soil. There, 
even in years with heavy rainfall the people are unable to fill 
their stomachs, and every year a large number of people die of 
starvation. 
<H5>  Asgari Faqih, Deputy From Qa'em Shahr </H5>
  Asgari Faqih, deputy from Qa'em Shahr, was the final 
preagenda speaker. During his speech he said: The role of the 
masses in social change is a powerful and undeniable factor, but 
that alone cannot bring about basic and fundamental change. 
Other factors must be added to complete the role of the people. 
  He added: Our people, despite all the rancor and 
mercilessness, have remained loyal to the shari'ah and the 
leader, and they have held on to this loyalty at the cost of 
their lives. They have faced one problem after another, but they 
have not bowed down and they have not surrendered to domination 
by the wicked who rule the world. 
  He also added: This strong relationship and the cooperation 
between the people, religion and their leader, is highly sacred 
because of its vital role in reviving and preserving genuine 
human qualities and its conformity with pure human essence and 
orthodox religion. 
  Continuing, he thanked the people of the province of 
Mazandaran for taking part in the funeral rites for 110 martyrs. 
He said: The call for obedience to the leader and continuing on 
the path of the martyrs and the cry of death to America and 
Zionism rang out in the sky of the area, and during these days 
the people said farewell to their martyrs. 
  He then thanked the Karbala 25 Army and the Martyr 
Foundation 
for holding the funeral rites for the martyrs. He asked the 
president of the republic for help and cooperation to carry out 
basic projects and employ the area's material and spiritual 
capabilities, and he asked the minister of roads and 
transportation to convert the Tehran-Firuzkuh-Qa'em Shahr road 
to the North Tehran highway. 
  In conclusion, the deputy from Qa'em Shahr asked the 
relevant 
officials to expand and rebuild Mazandaran's textile factories, 
to develop the activities of the Central Alborz Rock Coal 
Factory, to create war and conversion industry factories, to 
remove the obstacles to the building of industrial villages and 
to create textile and mining colleges.

CSO 

  [Text] Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Division. The 
Majles met in open session yesterday chaired by Dr. Rowhani, and 
the deputies from the cities of Langrud, Jahrom, Ahvaz, and 
Sanqar and Kolia'i gave speeches. Then the Majles took up its 
agenda, and we direct the attention of our esteemed readers to 
the detailed proceedings. 
<H5>  Legislation </H5>
<H5>  Law Transferring Health Monitors in Elementary Schools to </H5>
Educational Units in the Ministry of Education and Training 
  The first item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles 
session was the report from the Health Care Commission's second 
consultation on the Motion To Amend Article 1 of the Law 
Transferring Health Monitors in Elementary Schools to 
Educational Units in the Ministry of Education and Training, 
enacted 9/12/1370 [3 December 1991], of which Article 1 was 
approved by the deputies. 
  Article 1: The text of Article 1 of the Law Transferring 
Health Monitors in Elementary Schools to Educational Units in 
the Ministry of Education and Training enacted 9/12/1370 is 
amended as follows, a note entitled Note 4 is appended, and its 
existing Note 4 is changed to Note 5. 
  All health monitors in elementary schools who were trained 
in 
the supreme health care schools under the Ministry of Health 
Care, Treatment and Medical Education are transferred to the 
Ministry of Education and Training. 
  Note 4: As before, the responsibility for health care in the 
schools (planning, policy making, manpower training and 
implementation) in the framework of the nation's health care and 
treatment network is the responsibility of the Ministry of 
Health Care, Treatment and Medical Education. 
<H5>  Bill Exempting Islamic Republic Shipping From Paying Taxes </H5>
To Buy Ships 
  The second item on the agenda was the report from the first 
consultation of the Economic, Financial and Cooperative Affairs 
Commission concerning the Bill Exempting the Islamic Republic of 
Iran Shipping Company From Paying Taxes on the Portion of Its 
Profits Allocated To Buy Ships. A member of the Economic Affairs 
Commission discussed the reasons for rejecting this bill. He 
said: If every organization is going to avoid paying taxes, how 
can we expect others to pay them? If taxes are not collected, 
how are going to implement development projects? Implementation 
of these projects depends on collecting taxes. 
  He then added: On the one hand we want to free ourselves 
from 
dependence, and on the other hand we want to have tax 
exemptions. These two things do not go together. If tax 
exemptions are made every day, the government will not be able 
to carry out its responsibilities. 
  One of the bill's supporters said: If we exempt them, they 
will be able to buy a ship every year. Since ships are very 
important and vital for us, they must therefore be tax exempt 
for this purpose. 
  After talks by supporters and opponents, the general form of 
the aforementioned bill was put to a vote and approved. 
<H5>  Parviz Siqali, Deputy From Langrud </H5>
  A recent imperialist plot is to make the people disappointed 
in their past performance 
  The first preagenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles 
session was Siqali, deputy from Langrud. He observed the 
martyrdom anniversary of the acting commander of the Gilan 16 
Qods Army. He discussed the Great Satan's plot to reduce the 
price of oil and the appropriate procedures adopted by the 
president of the republic to deal with the crisis of the severe 
drop in oil prices. Continuing, he added: If the price of a 
barrel of oil increased to $30 instead of $12, and if we had a 
foreign exchange surplus instead of a foreign exchange deficit, 
we would repay our foreign debts on time and a positive answer 
would be given to the rightful demands of the Majles deputies 
and others. If the price of a dollar were less than 100 tomans, 
would we have the same views and judgments we have today? 
Clearly the answer is no. We all know that the price of oil is 
an international issue, and that Iran's role in OPEC is not 
constructive. 
  He also said: The recent imperialist plots were planned in 
calculated frameworks, and in difficult economic circumstances, 
psychological and spiritual pressure will be applied in the 
following areas: 
  (1) Disappointing the people in their performance; 
  (2) Portraying the dimensions of Islam as ineffective and 
not 
world-inclusive in the management of a country; 
  (3) Portraying the government as weak in terms of its stated 
goals, and in short it will seek to draw the conclusion that the 
slogans of the splendid period of the Islamic revolution have 
not been realized. 
  Siqali said that nothing more than this is to be expected 
from foreign enemies, and if they change their position on the 
course of the Islamic revolution one must be skeptical. He said: 
How must one deal with domestic enemies, who consider themselves 
Muslims following the leader's path, but in practice act in 
secret hypocritical opposition to God, his Prophet, the vice 
regent of the Muslims and the sacred government of the Islamic 
Republic? 
  The speaker discussed the fact that the Imam of the Age's 
(may God hasten his joyful advent) nameless soldiers clearly 
know them better than anyone, and they know well that they are 
busy every day collecting the assets of the people and the 
government, putting unworthy people in the nation's sensitive 
and key positions, and having vulgar gatherings at night for 
debauchery. Continuing, he said: They call collecting countless 
coins and hundreds of millions of tomans the giving of gifts, 
and today the taking of bribes is rampant in Islamic society; 
large and small acts of embezzlement are seen in the offices, 
the government companies, the banks and other places. Sometimes 
it is reported in the high-circulation newspapers. The people 
are asking the officials how these people must be dealt with, 
and what level of divine punishment should be applied to them. 
  Siqali then discussed the fact that the province of Gilan 
has 
been forgotten, and the people are asking the deputies, what 
national development projects have been carried out in this 
province since the Islamic revolution, other than the during the 
earthquake issue, which opened the eyes of many ministers. In 
this same regard he added: More than 85 percent of the villages 
in Gilan do not have drinking water and its cities are no better 
off. The rural roads are not suitable and about 60 percent of 
the province's villages do not have the benefit of electrical 
power. 
  Continuing, he said: The communications networks are in the 
worst condition. The Qazvin-Rasht road has taken the lives of 
many travelers and has become known today as a killing ground. 
At the same time, this province does not have a railroad. The 
famous Rasht airport is an airport in name only. On the shores 
of the Caspian Sea the passenger and freight shipping lines do 
not have coastal cities or multipurpose ports, and nothing has 
been done about them in the planning for province development. 
  At the end of his speech, the deputy from Langrud discussed 
the fact that based on the report from the Fisheries Company, 
revenues from caviar exports were about $100 million. If the 
dollar is worth 200 tumans this year, revenues from the sale of 
caviar are about 20 tumans billion, yet net fishermen, with high 
costs of living, live by the skin of their teeth or drown. In 
the year 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] three people drowned 
under very suspicious circumstances. At the first opportunity I 
told the governor-general of Gilan, the minister of the 
reconstruction crusade and the minister of the interior that the 
reason for the drownings is still shrouded in ambiguity. 
<H5>  Mohammad Mehdi Shoja'ifard, Deputy From Jahrom </H5>
  Today, thanks to this government, the Imam's Aid Committee 
even pays the educational expenses of college students it covers. 
  The second preagenda speaker was Shoja'ifard, deputy from 
Jahrom. During his speech he said: It makes the nation more 
optimistic when we compare the nation's various affairs before 
and after the revolution with other countries. 
  He discussed the nation's economic situation. He said: 
Before 
the revolution, 85 to 90 percent of the people had economic 
problems, yet today, thanks to the Islamic government and 
through the efforts of the officials and the president of the 
republic, more than 80 percent of the people have no basic 
economic problems. 
  Before the revolution, did the poor receive a million rials 
in any city from the Imam's Aid Committee, as they did in 
Jahrom? Where was it possible for a student to study easily is 
he so desired? The speaker continued: Today, thanks to this 
government, the Imam's Aid Committee even pays the educational 
expenses of the college students it covers. I want the Voice and 
Vision organization to cover this subject. Compare the security 
issues. Today in America itself, which is proclaiming the new 
world order, this nation's students are being searched in the 
junior high schools. 
  Shoja'ifard thanked the minister of the interior for dealing 
with the nation's security problems. He noted: Currently when 
most of the nations of the world want to keep themselves among 
the people, they announce in some way that they have relations 
with the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
  Continuing, the deputy from Jahrom discussed the Palestine 
issue. He said: We declare that emigration to Israel should not 
take place, for it will be regretted. 
  In conclusion, he said: In view of the fact that the Majles 
has guaranteed the purchase of the date crop, 15,000 tons of 
dates are now rotting in Jahrom. I also further advise Mr. 
Rafiqdust that he must pay more attention to wounded war 
veterans and not lay this burden on the government. If he gives 
one-third of the foundation's revenues to the wounded war 
veterans, that is sufficient. 
<H5>  'Ali Maturi, Deputy From Ahvaz </H5>
  Are we adhering to the religious and lawful principle of 
supervision in the way that we should? 
  The next speaker was Maturi, deputy from Ahvaz. In his 
speech 
he said: Along with the astonishing and undeniable glory that 
has come to us and the ray of hope that has come into the heart 
of each and every believer and oppressed person in the world, 
are we adhering to the religious and lawful principle of 
supervision in the way that we should? Or have we contented 
ourselves with a few investigations and interpellations? To 
understand the intellectual and moral poisons in order to 
develop a work ethic and social order, which was discussed by 
the exalted leader and could be the cure for all our social and 
economic problems, have we made the same effort that we have 
made to solve the traffic problem or the poisons caused by 
automobile exhaust and factory smoke in the city of Tehran, with 
all the investments, discussions, debates, observations and 
media reports, which are also themselves quite necessary? 
  He added: Have we given careful attention to what the 
exalted 
leader has said, with his divine insight, in his message to the 
new chief of the Voice and Vision organization? Have we 
presented that to society as a cultural and political message? 
Truly, this illuminating and path-finding message, along with 
the fateful messages of the late Imam, should be revived as 
standard equipment for the journeys of society's cultural and 
educational thinkers, artists and officials. If we apply the 
contents of these messages, we will no longer be confused about 
how to deal with videos and satellites. 
  The deputy from Ahvaz discussed the enemy plot to diminish 
the importance of our involvement in international affairs, 
especially the World Haj Conference. He said: We must think 
about how to answer these clever plots. Today the international 
battlefield is a political and cultural battlefield, and the 
world is clever and deceitful. 
  Our enemy controls all the resources and even all the 
international organizations. In this commercial fair we must 
purvey our values with clarity, sincerity and faith, and in this 
regard we must adopt the best procedures and the soundest paths. 
  Maturi then discussed the problems in his electoral 
district. 
He said: Apparently the project to develop sugarcane and the 
ancillary industries was intended to develop Khuzestan and solve 
the problems of unemployment and national production. 
Unfortunately, however, it must be said that not only has the 
area's unemployment problem not been solved, but in effect it 
has also multiplied the problem by several hundred times, and by 
taking over working lands instead of unused lands and making 
refugees of farmers, it has sent them to the cities and to false 
employment. I ask the respected Majles supervisors and also the 
minister of agriculture to supervise the course of this great 
national project more carefully. 
  He asked the minister of the reconstruction crusade and the 
officials of the nation's Deprived Regions Office to look 
realistically at the numerous problems in the deprived villages 
of Ahvaz, and to look kindly upon these deprived villages with 
serious help, especially with regard to solving the drinking 
water problem. 
  He added: Cutting the reconstruction budget for the 
municipality of Ahvaz is great oppression, which has been 
visited upon the noble people in the years since the war. I 
earnestly implore Mr. Mirzadeh to put an end to this undesirable 
situation. 
  Several times I have asked the governor-general of Khuzestan 
and the minister of the interior to make the village of 
Jamidiyeh into a district. 
  In conclusion, he thanked the chief of the Physical Training 
Organization for stabilizing the current situation in Khuzestan, 
and he thanked the Soccer Federation for guiding the South Ahvaz 
team to the Asian Cup games. 
<H5>  Barat'ali Mohammadifar, Deputy From Sanqar and Koliya'i </H5>
  Unfortunately as yet no conclusive result has been announced 
on the research and investigation in the province of Kermanshah. 
  The final preagenda speaker was Mohammadifar, deputy from 
Sanqar and Koliya'i. During his talk he expressed severe regret 
at the statement from the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Pilgrimage 
prohibiting the distribution of any kind of books or photographs 
during the Haj rites, and reducing the number of visitors to the 
house of God. He said: The Muslims of the world have a question 
to ask of a government that considers itself the servant of the 
shrines. According to what criteria of religious law are Islamic 
books and books on the Haj rites prohibited in Saudi Arabia 
during the days of the rites of Abraham's Haj? 
  Mohammadifar said that the declaration of this prohibition 
by 
the Government of Saudi Arabia is a violation of a clear verse 
from the Koran and it is a violation of a tradition of the 
Prophet (peace be upon him). He said: We hope that the 
Government of Saudi Arabia will come to its senses and not carry 
out orders that violate the commands of Islam and the Koran. 
  He then discussed the research and investigation in the 
province of Kermanshah, which the Majles has been studying for 
almost two years, and whose report has been published for the 
public's information by the Majles. He said: Unfortunately a 
definitive conclusion has not yet been announced on this for the 
martyr-nurturing people of the province of Kermanshah. In view 
of the repeated letters that have been written and the protests 
the people of the province have sent to the province deputies 
and even to the Article 90 Commission concerning the lack of a 
careful report and a trial of the violators, we ask the chief of 
the Article 90 Commission to prepare this report as soon as 
possible and send it to the respected chief of the judiciary so 
the violators can be tried and punished. In conclusion, the 
deputy from Sanqar and Kolia'i thanked the government and the 
chief of the Deprived Areas Office for declaring his electoral 
district a deprived municipality and he thanked the chief of the 
Plan and Budget Organization for allocating a significant budget 
to build the Sanqar road. 
<H5>  revolution Courts Have Right To Hear Cases on the Return of </H5>
Confiscated Assets 
  Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Division. The 
judiciary 
and the courts are dealing harshly with the narcotics issue, and 
the American government's claim that drugs are being transported 
through Iran is completely without basis. 
  Ayatollah Moqteda'i, chief of the National Supreme Court, 
announced the above. He added: More than 40 tons of morphine was 
confiscated in the years 1360-1372 [21 March 1981-20 March 
1994], yet there is absolutely no domestic consumption of 
morphine. Smugglers were transporting this cargo for 
distribution in Europe and America. 
  The chief of the National Supreme Court, speaking yesterday 
morning at a gathering of media correspondents, continued: 
Recently baseless and purposeful statements have been made by 
American leaders that the Gvernment of Iran is smuggling 
narcotics across the country. Now, after approval from the 
Interests Discernment Council, the revolution courts system is 
dealing harshly with the issue of narcotics and narcotics 
smuggling. 
  He added: Fatal blows have been dealt to narcotics smugglers 
and smugglers by the revolution courts and the police forces. 
The statistics on prisoners, 60 percent of whom are in prison 
for narcotics crimes, are good testimony to this. 
  At the beginning of his talk Ayatollah Moqteda'i discussed 
the duty of the National Supreme Court, the appeals procedure in 
the branch court and its procedures for dealing with 
deficiencies, reversals, and upheld verdicts. He then discussed 
statistics. He said: In the year 1372, 39,000 cases reached the 
branch courts, of which 38,850 were heard and closed. There were 
also 12,912 open cases at the beginning of the year 1373 [21 
March 1994], which are being heard in the branch court. All 
these existing cases are from the second half of the year 1372. 
  Elsewhere in his talk, the chief of the National Supreme 
Court discussed the establishment of a Supervisory Unit in the 
court. He said: For judges whose verdicts come to the court, we 
have prepared a case folder to see how often a judge's verdicts 
are reversed and how often they are upheld. This is itself a 
criterion for understanding judges and their benefits and 
promotions so judges can be evaluated for quantity and quality. 
In this regard all files that have more than 250 reversals are 
collected. We print them and make them available to the judges. 
  He discussed the investigation of special cases. He said: 
Rapid investigation of special cases such as murder, kidnapping, 
armed robbery, and other things has shown that there are few of 
these kinds of crimes and this type of investigation has had a 
useful effect reducing the crimes. 
  He then discussed the public, revolution and general courts, 
whose details have recently been approved by the Majles. He 
said: The system of general courts has many distinctions, 
including the two main goals of the courts, which are rapid 
investigation and arriving at truth and reality. Of course there 
are also problems, which are gradually being corrected. 
  Continuing, he compared the current judicial system with the 
system intended for the general courts. He said the current 
system, with public and revolution prosecutors, has weaknesses, 
and the approval of the general courts system will solve the 
current problems in the judiciary. 
  Ayatollah Moqteda'i said one of the duties of the National 
Supreme Court is to create unity in judicial procedures by 
forming a General National Supreme Court Council. He said: If 
there is conflict between two level-one legal courts or two 
level-two penal courts in dealing with a law, the general 
council will convene to deal with the conflict. The majority 
opinion of the meeting will have the force of law as a unified 
judicial procedure. 
  Continuing, he noted: In the year 1372 there were 26 
meetings 
of the general council and 74 cases were discussed and closed. 
There were 11 unified judicial procedure cases, and the rest 
were penal or legal demands. 
  He discussed three instances of unified judicial procedures 
in the year 1372. He added: One of them had to do with cases 
where the revolution courts ordered confiscation of property, 
and individuals came to the legal courts with documents, letters 
of guarantee, checks or other documents and demanded the return 
of their confiscated assets. With a unified procedure, the court 
gave the verdict: Since these cases were heard by the revolution 
courts and the confiscation order was given, the return of the 
assets and claims in this regard must be also be heard in the 
revolution courts. 
  Another case had to do with crimes of smuggling goods, where 
individuals evaded customs regulations and the courts gave 
discounts. This led to the spread of smuggling of goods and no 
fines were collected for the smuggled goods. The National 
Supreme Court gave a unified procedures verdict that fines on 
smuggled goods cannot be discounted. It announced that this is 
crime subject to government fines and that these must be 
collected under the law. On the other hand, nongovernment fines 
may be changed in accordance with the opinion of the religious 
magistrate. 
  The third case had to do with security crimes. The question 
was whether this crime is private, public or both. The court's 
view was that security crimes are both private and public, and 
even if the private plaintiff declines to prosecute, the court 
will not decline because of the public aspect. 
  At the end of his speech, Ayatollah Moqteda'i discussed the 
case of Jalal al-Din Farsi. He said: After a protest from the 
Tehran Public Prosecutor, Mr. Farsi's case came to the court and 
was referred to Branch Court 11. After a careful study of the 
case the problems with the verdict were considered. Of course, 
these basic problems did not overturn the verdict. That is, the 
judges of the court believed that it was manslaughter, but there 
were defects in the quality of the argumentation and the 
evidence, and they raised an objection during the full defense. 
The charge of manslaughter was upheld, however, and it was sent 
to the penal court that issued the verdict to be returned after 
removal of the defects.

CSO 

  [Text] Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Division. The 
Majles met yesterday in open session, chaired by Dr. Rowhani, 
and the deputies from the cities of Dezful, Qazvin, and Bonab 
gave speeches. Then Dr. Rowhani discussed the recent crimes and 
aggression by the Serbs in Gorazde and the silence of the 
international organizations. These remarks were discussed in 
yesterday's issue. Continuing, the Majles then went into 
consultation. We direct the attention of our dear readers to the 
detailed proceedings. 
<H5>  'Ali Reza Sadra, Deputy From Dezful </H5>
  Despite the imperialist plots, the next century is the 
century of Islamic revolution. 
  The first preagenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles 
session was Sadra, deputy from Dezful. During his speech he 
commemorated the anniversary last week of the severing of 
relations with America. He said: The world's hidden circles of 
power, consisting of the secret Zionist societies and the secret 
circles of international Freemasonry, have dreamed a very 
dangerous dream in the course of their imperialism and 
domination, the dream of the new world order and international 
order for the nations of the world in the 21st century. 
  Continuing, he added: The new plot is the world in the power 
vacuum since the Cold War, under the pretext of avoiding 
divergence and conflict and apparently with the strategy of 
world alliance and unity, instead of international solidarity, 
following the realization of world economic, political and 
cultural dependence and military security. 
  The speaker said the new world order is to be achieved 
through the establishment of a world empire and a racist, 
centralized secular dictatorship with world-devouring America as 
leader and center. He said: If it (the new world order) is 
achieved, not only will the oppressed nations, and especially 
the Islamic nations, not achieve their minimum legitimate 
rights, but the international gap between wealth and poverty 
among the nations will grow and become much deeper. 
  He also said: The most important of these preliminaries are 
the changes and various international and regional measures such 
as NAFTA, GATT, Middle East compromise, the Unied Nations and 
changes in the structure of the Security Council and human 
rights aimed at achieving world interests and domination. 
  Sadra also added: The major factor disturbing the dreams of 
the leaders of world imperialism, creating difficulties for the 
realization of the plot of world dictatorship and threatening it 
more every day, is the ever-expanding Islamic movement, and its 
pillar of inspiration and motivation is Islamic, revolution Iran. 
  The deputy from Dezful discussed the fact that even now the 
world of Islam must be planned as a center of power in the new 
world order, for it is a unified, multi-polar, stable system. He 
said: However, the fierce approach world imperialism is taking 
towards the prominent manifestations of the Islamic movement is 
an illustration of its weakness and impotence, and it unmasks 
the evil plots and the savage face of the Satanic powers led by 
America. 
  He discussed the fact that despite these plots, the coming 
century is the century of the Islamic revolution. Continuing, he 
said: As the center of the Islamic revolution, the Islamic 
Republic of Iran is the center of power and guidance for the 
roaring waves of Islamic movements and it is reviving Islam in 
midst of the ignorance of the 20th and 21st centuries. 
  He then said: Preserving and reinforcing this authority and 
refuge, which is one of the most important necessities of the 
age and for the current generation, depends more than anything 
else on preserving awareness and unity and absolute obedience to 
the exalted leader. 
  Continuing, the speaker added: Now that the Majles has the 
study of the Second Five-Year Plan on its agenda, it is 
necessary that more attention than ever be given to the 
following, so that with the completion of the First Five-Year 
Plan's infrastructure projects and putting them into operation, 
we will see the emergence of a prosperous and constructive 
economy: we must adopt a policy of economizing, production and 
effort, removing oil from the commercial balance, putting the 
economic levers into the hands of native, sacrificing forces who 
lack the necessary resources, emphasis on agricultural 
conversion industries and agriculture, and avoiding excess and 
assembly industries. 
  Continuing, the deputy from Dezful said: It is appropriate 
that attention be given to Khuzestan, with its unique regional 
position in the country, the Persian Gulf and among the oil-rich 
nations of the region, which has seen the greatest damage from 
imperialism and the imposed war. In addition to the oil and gas 
reserves, it has potential and abundant actual talents in 
agriculture, date orchards, medicinal herbs, animal husbandry, 
fisheries and other areas. Finally there are great water 
resources, of which more than three billion cubic meters leaves 
the country annually, and with the water crisis in the region, 
each water source is great wealth, sometimes at the level of oil 
revenues. 
  At the end of his speech, Sadra asked the president of the 
republic to support the Khuzestan Development and Investment 
Company. He praised Martyr Delvari, the commander from 
Tangestan, and he praised the leader of this movement, Ayatollah 
Dezfuli, whose role has gone unrecognized. 
<H5>  Seyyed Fatah Mortezavi, Deputy From Qazvin </H5>
  The great nation of Iran expects the Mr. Hashemi's 
government 
to put the market in order and to deal decisively with violators. 
  The second preagenda speaker was Mortezavi, deputy from 
Qazvin. During his speech he commemorated Army Day and discussed 
society's economic problems. He said: The problem of high prices 
will be solved either when for some reason demand is reduced or 
a balance develops between supply and demand. This will not be 
possible without increasing the supply of goods to the level of 
demand through increased production. 
  He added: Praise God the government of Mr. Hashemi has had 
great success moving in this direction. It has smoothed the path 
and overcome the basic difficulties. 
  He then discussed the chaos reigning in the market. He said: 
The great nation of Iran recognizes Mr. Hashemi as the 
number-two figure in the revolution, the powerful hand of 
leadership and the management authority. For this reason they 
expect his government to put the market in order and to deal 
decisively with violators. Unfortunately, this will not be 
possible until this chaos no longer exists and each person stops 
doing whatever he wants to do, as long as they do not arrest the 
public bloodsuckers and leeches, and until they stop making 
oppressed people pessimistic about the revolution. 
  Mortezavi then discussed the Council of Ministers' approval 
of province status for Qazvin and the sending of that measure to 
the Majles. He said: The Qazvin area has been carefully studied 
several times by the Ministry of Agriculture's Office of 
Divisions, and its conversion to a new province is recognized as 
one of the prominent outcomes of the Agricultural Divisions Law 
Enacted in the year 1362 [21 March 1983-20 March 1984]. This is 
a law on the basis of which more than 43 municipalities, 145 
districts, and about 2,000 villages were formed. 
  He added: The establishment of the new province was desired 
for many years by the people of Qazvin, and they conveyed this 
wish in various ways to the officials of the Islamic republic. 
An example was the welcoming ceremonies for the president of the 
republic in the year 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993] and his 
very positive and appropriate response to the request from the 
people. Another example was the unprecedented welcome for the 
speaker of the Majles last year in the month of Mehr [23 
September-22 October]. 
  As they welcomed him as the chief of the legislative power 
and one of the chiefs of the three powers in government work, he 
gave a positive response to their request. They thanked and 
praised him, and their thanks to him was thanks to all those 
working in the government and working to approve the bill. 
Concerning the bill's financial burden, my esteemed colleagues 
know that the government's budget is either for current expenses 
or development, and each of these cases it is either national or 
provincial. Whether the new province is established or not, the 
national and province development budgets are each spent based 
on the relevant law and regulations, and they have nothing to do 
with whether a place becomes a province or not. The same is true 
of the current expense budget. 
  Most of the current expense budget is spent on education and 
training, health care and treatment and defense matters, and 
whether or not Qazvin becomes a province will not change this. 
Yes, if Qazvin becomes a province center, only a few ministries 
and organizations, which do not have separate organizations in 
Qazvin will need a little budget and some changes, because a 
significant number of the offices are now managed as independent 
general offices from the province center, or they are managed in 
such a way that they are higher than an ordinary office and 
their officials are deputy general managers. 
  He added: It is the opinion of the experts that making 
Qazvin 
a province center will effectively promote the growth and 
development of Qazvin and consequently the growth and 
development of the nation. It is a region where significant 
investment has been done in industry and where more than 1,000 
industrial units are active, ranking it third among the nation's 
provinces. 
  Agriculturally it has more than 240,000 hectares of prime 
and 
second degree land in the Qazvin Plain alone. The establishment 
of the Qazvin Plain Development Organization in the years before 
the Islamic revolution is an indication of the extraordinary 
potential of this region, which can provide consumer goods for 
millions of people. Therefore, establishing the province of 
Qazvin means having appropriate and skilled management able to 
take effective steps for the growth and development of the 
nation and the region. Currently the management in the region 
lacks what is needed to solve the region's problems and 
difficulties and the existing installations are not suitable for 
the volume of work. 
  The deputy from Qazvin noted: After approval by the Council 
of Ministers, the people of the region held numerous gatherings 
to offer thanks and praise, and even now their eyes are fixed on 
the votes of the Majles deputies, who are the pick of the 
nation, and they are counting the moments until voting time. 
With the wisdom and insight that we know the deputies have, we 
hope they will make more than one million people happy with 
their votes and solve this problem of several years standing. 
  He asked the minister of petroleum for help providing gas 
service to the cities of Eqbaliyeh and Zibashahr, he asked the 
minister of roads and transportation for help with the creation 
of suitable rural roads in the deprived districts of al-Mowt, 
Rudbar-e Shahrestan, and Tarom-e Safali, and he issued a memo to 
the minister of health care, treatment and medical education 
asking for the establishment of hospitals in the cities of 
Elvand and Abik. 
<H5>  Rasul Sadiqi, Deputy From Bonab </H5>
  Imperialism, in clinging to humanitarian issues such as 
human 
rights, constantly seeks to weaken independent and Islamic 
nations. 
  The final preagenda speaker was Sadiqi, deputy from Bonab. 
In 
his talk he discussed the beginning of the Second Five-Year Plan 
and the 8-percent growth under the First Five-Year Plan. He 
said: It is the nature of such growth, despite significant 
organization, that it is expensive in some areas in order to 
achieve the desired production, in such a way that society's 
vulnerable classes have faced many problems. 
  He added: To stop the pressures on the vulnerable classes 
caused by growth under the plan through inflation without 
adjusting the plan's 8-percent growth rate, which is a basic 
rate, special attention must be given to establishing more 
effective parameters to control the problems in society. 
  On the one hand we must make efforts to build national 
resolve, using the abilities of all the sincere, believing and 
specialist forces and emphasizing the valuable guidance of the 
exalted leader in his New Year's message concerning the work 
ethic and social order in the building of our Islamic nation. 
  Continuing, the speaker said: The current issues in the 
Muslim world illustrate the truth that world imperialism, in 
clinging to humanitarian issues such as human rights, constantly 
seeks to weaken independent and Islamic nations, and it will 
give up dominating these nations only if they assert their own 
authority. 
  Sadiqi then discussed the crimes of the Serbs in Gorazde. He 
said: This damaged city is falling before the eyes of the people 
of the world under the harshest methods such as attacks on the 
lives and property of the people, and this illustrates the claim 
that there seems to be no longer any sign of human beings and 
humanity in the heart of so-called civilization, and that the 
human rights of the international organizations is merely a 
weapon to silence the cries of the freedom-seeking nations. 
  He issued a memo to the newspapers, especially some local 
newspapers. He said: In view of the emergence of nationalist 
issues in the world and the processes arising from it, 
especially in the nations neighboring us, they must exercise 
special awareness. Instead of dealing with spiritual and 
cultural issues, they are sowing discord among Muslims by 
reinforcing personal ethnic prejudice and indirectly promoting 
the ideas of undesirable elements, the supporters of the 
Hojjatiyehs and the Khalq-e Mosalman, and spreading lies. 
Sometimes this causes problems in the districts and 
municipalities. This trend is very dangerous, and I call upon 
the Ministry of Guidance to deal seriously with such cases. 
  The deputy from Bonab thanked the government and the Majles 
for compiling and implementing the First Five-Year Plan. He 
said: A comparison of the parameters, problems, and approaches 
taken in various affairs at the beginning and at the end of the 
Five-Year Plan shows the nation's success and progress in 
various areas, so that the people of Bonab and Malekan are 
waiting for a visit from the president of the republic to open 
and put into operation several important and vital projects. 
<H5>  Legislation </H5>
<H5>  International Air Agreement on Goods Traveling Between Iran </H5>
and Greece 
  The first item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles 
session was the report from the Housing and Urban Construction 
Commission concerning the Bill on the International Air 
Transportation and Shipping Agreement on Goods and Passengers 
Traveling Between the Governments of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran and Greece (returned from the Council of Guardians), and 
this amendment was passed for the purpose of gaining the 
approval of the Guardian Council. 
  Amendment: If the two parties to the agreement are unable to 
resolve differences under paragraphs 1 and 2 above, they may 
refer the dispute to a three-person arbitration court, adhering 
to the relevant laws and regulations. 
<H5>  Forests and Pastures Preservation and Utilization Law </H5>
  The second item on the agenda was the report from the 
Agriculture Commission concerning the Motion To Amend Article 34 
of the Forests and Pastures Preservation and Utilization Law, 
enacted 3/14/1354 [4 June 1975] and append several notes to it 
(returned from the Guardian Council), for which the above 
amendment was approved by the Majles. 
  Amendment to Article 34: As of the date of this law's 
enactment, the Ministry of the Reconstruction Crusade is 
required within three years to [text missing] the northern 
forests and plains and treeless nationalized pastures, which 
were converted to orchards or irrigated farms or put to use for 
projects to produce livestock and aquatic animals and other 
nonagricultural projects by the end of the year 1365 [20 March 
1987] after the approval of the Proposed Law on Procedures for 
Transferring and Revitalizing Lands in the Government of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran and without obtaining legal and 
religious authorization to take possession... 
<H5>  Law on Teachers, Physicians, and Paramedicals Performing </H5>
Compulsory Service 
  The third item on the agenda was the report on the first 
consultation of the Defense Affairs Commission concerning the 
Bill To Amend the Law on Teachers, Physicians, and Paramedicals 
Performing Compulsory Service, the general form of which was 
approved by the deputies. 
  It is worth mentioning that in the amendment to this law the 
phrase "National Technical and Professional Education 
Organization" was added to the aforementioned law approved 
7/25/1369 [17 October 1990]. 
<H5>  Authorization Ministry of Defense to Form Development and </H5>
Service Companies 
  The next item on the agenda was the report from the first 
consultation of the Defense Commission concerning the Bill 
Authorizing the Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics 
To Form Development and Service Companies, which was approved. 
  Article 1 states: The Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces 
Logistics is authorized, provided it retains its combat 
capability and defense readiness, to form development and 
service companies after approval from the Armed Forces General 
Staff. 
<H5>  Urgent Motion Prohibiting Use of Western Names </H5>
  The next item on the agenda was the Prohibition on Employing 
Western Names, Titles and Expressions, presented as an urgent 
motion. 
  Discussing the motion's urgent status, 'Ali Yusefpur said: 
This motion was presented following the emphasis from the 
exalted leader on using Persian words and also following the 
publication of the thoughts of His Holiness the Imam (peace be 
upon him) in this regard. Unfortunately in the last few years on 
the streets of Tehran foreign names have been appearing in 
abundance on public streets, in newspapers, and in stores. Even 
on signs, the Western words are big but the Persian words are 
small. Should an Islamic nation, which is the center of the 
Islamic revolution and should be setting an example, really be 
intoxicating its students with words in the Latin alphabet? 
Already the words blouse, shirt, and others are being printed in 
the stores as foreign words. Isn't this selling oneself? Why 
should some parks be named with foreign names? Unfortunately one 
of the officials sent a New Year's card to the deputies offering 
the greetings in Latin characters. The greeting is so alienated 
that the official uses the foreign term for Majles deputy. 
Therefore, to prevent the use of these terms, we presented this 
bill to the Majles as an urgent motion. 
  After talks by opponents and supporters, the bill's urgent 
status was put to a vote, was not approved, and was rejected. 
<H5>  Motion on Regulations for Foreign Vehicles </H5>
  Likewise, the proposed Law on Regulations for Foreign 
Vehicles was presented by the deputies as an urgent motion, and 
its urgent status was approved by the deputies. 
  One of the signatories to this motion said in a speech: 
Since 
the nations who have signed the treaty on trucks have set 
special regulations, we must also set regulations in this 
regard. The regulations must not be onesided. In those countries 
trucks operate in limited numbers, but the trucks native to the 
country operate with cheap fuel, without difficulty and without 
limitations. 
  He also noted: We are wasting 50 million tumans per day in 
this regard.

  [Excerpts] The Majles met in open session yesterday and the 
deputies from Noshahr and Chalus, Hashtrud, Barkhar, Mimeh and 
Tehran gave speeches. Likewise at this session more than 180 
deputies condemned the siege of Gorazde by the Serbian criminals 
and the deathly silence of the UN and some Western nations in 
the face of these crimes. We direct the attention of our 
esteemed readers to the detailed proceedings. 
<H5>  Farjollah Afrazideh, Deputy From Noshahr and Chalus </H5>
  The Majles should spend half its time supervising the 
implementation of laws. 
  The first preagenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles 
session was Afrazideh, deputy from Noshahr and Chalus. 
  [Passages omitted on criticism of UN and Russian role in 
Bosnia.] 
  Afrazideh discussed the public's liking for the president of 
the republic and the nation's reconstruction after the war and 
the earthquake, which is not such an easy task. He said: In 
these conditions of economic adjustment, only the capable hand 
of the president of the republic can put the country in order. 
The general public knows that inflation and high prices are not 
just in countries, but throughout the world. 
  He then said: One thing which must not be forgotten, 
however, 
is that there is no correspondence between incomes and the cost 
of living in our country. The wage-earning and low-income 
classes in society are particularly severely beset, and their 
living expenses are absolutely not being met. Even more 
overwhelmed than these two groups are those who have no jobs 
with which to meet their living expenses. 
  This is especially true in the municipality of Noshahr as a 
result of the unpredictably harsh environmental conditions which 
are completely unreasonable by any standard. There are not many 
factories to employ all these people with high school diplomas 
and less and with bachelor's degrees. They are unemployed, and 
one of the big problems we deputies have is the many requests 
from these young people for jobs. If some basic thinking is not 
done to employ them, the country will be afflicted with 
thousands of kinds of corruption and affliction. 
  Continuing, the deputy for Noshahr and Chalus said: One of 
the nation's important problems is that the government has given 
the flatterers a free hand so that anyone can suck the blood of 
the poor and oppressed people to fill his pockets as much as he 
wants and through any means. Not the least thing has been done 
to control prices. 
  Up until the end of the year 1372 [20 March 1994] a kilogram 
of sugar or sugar cubes was 70 tumans and a package of number 16 
nails was 350 tumans. The people are asking us, how is it that 
in the year 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995], with foreign 
exchange rate fluctuations overnight the price of a kilogram of 
sugar or sugar cubes increases to 140 tumans and a package of 
No. 16 nails goes up to 1,100 tumans, yet there are thousands of 
tons of sugar, sugar cubes and nails in the warehouses? Without 
any trouble, their owners instantly added billions of rials to 
their wealth and no one said a word to them. 
  He added: My recommendation is first of all that in cases 
like this the president of the republic order the assets of 
these profiteers and economic terrorists confiscated through the 
judicial system, as an object lesson to others so that no one 
will dare overcharge society's deprived and oppressed people 
this way. Second, the government should use all its power to 
control rates in some way so that goods will be sold at the same 
price throughout the country. Right now, 50 stores will have 50 
different prices on the same street. 
  He continued: 
  In short, one cannot run a country with sermons, advice and 
`my dear, my dear.' 
  Continuing, the speaker condemned the cronyism, flattery, 
superficiality, and hypocrisy that have become prevalent in our 
society and also find receptive audiences. He said: The existing 
situation must be conveyed to the hearing of officials. 
Inappropriate optimism and saying that everything is good will 
only tempt and deceive the officials and it will have dangerous 
consequences. 
  He criticized the programs of the Vision of the Islamic 
Republic and recommended that the programs feature scholars from 
Qom Seminary like Ayatollah Mesbah Yazdi, Javadi-Amoli, 
Makarom-Shirazi and other scholars, and, from the universities, 
people like Dr. Javad Larijani and other great people as hosts, 
and that basic and important religious questions and answers be 
raised. 
  The deputy from Noshahr and Chalus said: Although the Fourth 
Majles has taken positive steps in several areas, this is not 
enough. In my view, instead of spending all this time on laws, 
the Majles should spend half its time supervising the 
implementation of laws and see how much waste, dissipation, and 
embezzlement of the public treasury exists in the government 
organizations. 
  In conclusion, the speaker called for laws that will solve 
the important problems of society. As an example he mentioned 
passing the "Where Did You Get It?" law so that those people can 
be legally prosecuted who committed many crimes during the 
revolution, through trickery, deception, and aligning themselves 
with this or that faction, and their assets can be confiscated 
in the interest of the deprived and the oppressed. 
<H5>  Ghaffar Esma'il, Deputy From Hashtrud </H5>
  The people expect the government to deal decisively with 
violators and to precisely control prices. 
  The next speaker was Esma'il, deputy from Hashtrud. During 
his speech he discussed the secret collusion by NATO officials. 
He said: The fear of an independent Islamic nation in Europe has 
led those in the Security Council and their NATO allies to stoop 
to any disgrace. The situation has become so shameful that 
peacekeepers were taken hostage by the Serbs and nothing changed. 
  He praised the consolidation of the ministries of industry 
and expressed the hope that the existing malaise in the nation's 
industry will end and that it will be the basic focal point for 
alleviating the economic problems of the government and the 
people. The exalted leader's 13-point publication must be the 
focus of the Second Five-Year Plan. In must be considered in the 
framework of statistics and figures, and a comprehensive plan 
must be compiled using the experience of the First Five-Year 
Plan and its strengths and weaknesses. 
  He added: Paying subsidies in the existing way is not just. 
Those who are better off benefit that much more from the 
subsidies on some goods, and the proper procedure should be the 
opposite. Rural people are deprived of the subsidies given to 
those living in the cities. The procedure adopted in the Second 
Five-Year Plan must be such that the most deprived people in 
society enjoy the most subsidies and those who are prosperous 
will pay the real price of basic goods and the subsidies on 
energy and fuel. 
  The deputy from Hashtrud emphasized: An unavoidable 
necessity 
is to review the method of collecting taxes and adopt proper 
procedures for creating reliable sources of revenue for the 
government and prevent inflated revenues. It is also necessary 
to invest in the education and training sector in training 
committed and skilled manpower, and developing education and 
training centers in the agricultural sector, which are the main 
focal points of economic development. 
  Despite the high added-value in the agricultural sector 
compared to the other sectors and its vast resources, we still 
do not market enough products in this sector for domestic 
consumption. Yet the least investment of all the sectors is 
required to create employment in this sector, because by 
allocating to agriculture only 8 percent of all the nation's 
infrastructure investment, it will account for about 24 percent 
of the nation's gross revenues and 28 percent of its employment. 
  Continuing, Esma'ili said: The revolution people expect the 
government to deal decisively with violators and the financially 
corrupt, and to precisely control prices. I thank the president 
of the republic for seeking to stabilize prices and for taking 
steps in this area. The people and the Majles will clearly 
support these measures. 
  I ask the economic council to expedite implementation of 
pricing legislation. Clearly, one of the major factors in high 
prices is the lack of conformity of supply to demand. For more 
supply there must be more production and less consumption. 
  Continuing, he discussed the solution to high prices. He 
said: To accomplish this there must be a proper public 
consumption and distribution model, and there must be a culture 
of work and a work ethic, which is one of the basic and crucial 
principles of our dear leader's guidance. The culture of work 
and economizing must be planted as a value in the hearts and 
minds of each of the people like a fruitful sapling. The people 
must understand its importance and its reward as something akin 
to going to the war fronts. Instead of thinking about their 
personal interests and earning incomes from brokerage and false 
employment, which is one of the major factors in inflation, they 
must think about national interests and work. 
  Esma'ili then emphasized the problem of unemployment in the 
country. He said: In this sensitive time of manpower adjustment, 
privatization, factory closures, and high inflation, and the 
fact that our workers are seeking work in other countries, the 
general interest of the country requires that Afghan workers be 
returned to their own country so that in addition to not 
creating numerous forms of corruption, they will not snatch the 
few existing jobs from Iranian workers. In this situation with 
high prices, Iranian workers must not be left with nowhere to 
turn. 
  He then thanked the minister of agriculture for his visit to 
the exalted leader's projects in Hashtrud, and he praised the 
minister of energy's attention to providing water service to the 
region, and he praised the chief of the Plan and Budget 
Organization and the minister of roads and transportation for 
creating the Hashtrud beltline road. 
<H5>  Mohammad Reza Naseri-Dowlatabadi, Deputy From Barkhar And </H5>
Mimeh 
  Is it in our interest, in the name of economic prosperity 
and 
without regard for the struggles of the people, that we should 
impose the pressures of inflation and high prices on the 
vulnerable classes? 
  The next preagenda speaker was Naseri-Dowlatabadi, deputy 
from Barkhar and Mimeh. During his speech he said: Today 
humanity is aligned against free thinking, especially that of 
the Muslim nations. These international criminals are attacking 
the Muslims of the world, especially in Bosnia and Herzegovina 
and Palestine. No clear position is taken against the racists, 
and, despite the signing of the nongenocide treaty, genocide and 
mass killings continue. This adds another black page to the 
record of the world's lying monopolizing human rights 
organizations. It is not clear how they will answer history for 
the crimes at al-Khalil and Gorazde in Bosnia. Today the human 
rights war is being waged against those who generally seek to 
act independently in the world. 
  The speaker discussed the anniversary of the martyrdom of 
Martyr Motahari and the arrival of Teacher Day, and he mentioned 
the cultural invasion. He said: First of all, I am astonished 
and dismayed that a nation with this cultural background is 
unable to stand up against the enemy cultural invasion by using 
the potent and effective tools that are embedded in the heart of 
its Islamic culture. Why should a country be worried about a 
cultural invasion that has this vast education and training and 
higher education system, which embraces 20 million people? This 
means that one in every three Iranians is directly involved with 
education, teaching, and training. 
  In the same regard he added: Isn't it time for our 
researchers to study and determine the reason for this bitter 
truth that our education and training and higher education 
officials and planners are unable to create the necessary 
incentives for our elementary school children, high-school 
adolescents, and university youth? If the educational 
organizations do not move positively based on the psychological 
needs of the young generation, we will move farther from our 
goal. 
  Continuing, Naseri said: Is it in our interest, in the name 
of economic prosperity and without regard for the capability of 
the people to struggle, that we should impose the pressures of 
inflation and high prices on society's vulnerable classes? 
  Continuing, he discussed Worker Week. He said: The necessary 
leverage must be provided to support this class, and basic steps 
must be taken to solve their problems. If this is not possible, 
one must live simply, as they do, to increase their tolerance 
for poverty. 
  The speaker discussed the exalted leader's New Year's 
message. He said: A look at the government offices, which are a 
government family of several million, and at the useful work 
hours, puts us in a state of uncertainty and anxiety. We must 
study what volume of personnel foreign offices and companies use 
to produce several times more than what we produce. Don't hidden 
unemployment, corruption and administrative bribery damage the 
spirit of the revolution and threaten its future? 
  The deputy from Barkhar and Mimeh discussed the fact that 
America's fate will be no different than that of the Soviet 
Union. He discussed the water conference in Oman, attended by 
the Zionist regime's experts. He said: Although the 
aforementioned conference is apparently about water, its goals 
are in line with imperialist efforts to establish peace between 
the Arabs and Israel. Experts predict that an arms conference 
will soon be held in Qatar, attended by Israel and several 
Islamic nations. The existing situation shows that Israel, more 
than ever since its inception, is coming closer to the world of 
Islam and the borders of the Islamic heartland. 
  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs must therefore do the 
necessary planning and adopt a systematic policy to thwart the 
negative effects of this inauspicious alliance in the history of 
the struggles of Muslim combatants. 
  Continuing, Naseri said: I recommend that in the matter of 
eliminating social subsidies we seek the views of the people, to 
make it possible for them better to participate in their own 
destiny. 
  I also ask the respected president of the republic and the 
Council of Ministers to provide the necessary tools to obtain 
the views of the Majles in adhering to the principle of 
economizing, which is the message of hope in the 1373 budget. It 
is the duty of the Majles to use its legal resources to support 
the government. 
  Some of the executive officials must avoid useless 
extravagance and pointless gratuities from the public treasury, 
using government resources and printing advertisements of 
congratulation and condolence with the government's general 
budget. The continuation of what has been happening in recent 
years and the waste is a cause for serious concern. If the 
important principle of economizing is observed by the government 
leaders, the people will also be inclined to economize, for "the 
people follow the religion of their rulers." 
  In conclusion he thanked the management in his electoral 
precinct and the executive, military and police officials, 
especially the office of the governor and the traffic control 
forces in his electoral district for securing and watching the 
exit and entry routes during the New Year's holidays. He issued 
memos to the minister of power concerning the completion of the 
Barkhar water canal project, to the minister of petroleum 
concerning gas service, to the minister of agriculture 
concerning agricultural self-sufficiency and to the minister of 
the reconstruction crusade about rebuilding and asphalting the 
Barkhar and Mimeh rural connective roads, and he asked that the 
above problems be dealt with. 
<H5>  Sa'id Raja'i-Khorasani, Deputy From Tehran </H5>
  We should be trying to prevent waste and extravagance. 
  The final preagenda speaker was Raja'i Khorasani. In his 
speech he offered congratulations on the birth anniversary of 
His Holiness Imam Reza (peace be upon him), and he discussed the 
regrettable situation in the city of Gorazde. He said: The 
criminal West, on various pretexts, brought about the occupation 
of Gorazde, and it really refused to use the military leverage 
it had available, and we strongly condemn this inadequacy that 
we see in the Western nations, especially in the Security 
Council. 
  He added: We must not forget that in this regard the sins of 
the Russians are no less than those of the Westerners and the 
Americans. I remember when the Security Council's forces took 
formal action against one or two Serbian tanks, the Russians 
immediately expressed concern, asking why this was done without 
their knowledge. 
  The deputy from Tehran then discussed the problem of high 
prices in the country. He said: I must ask the officials not to 
present pointless analyses about high prices. It is not quite 
correct to say that the small percentage of our budget and 
public treasury being used for subsidies is not reaching the 
right people. Is this because a small percentage of our people 
are quite wealthy and do not deserve these subsidies? 
  If we look at the masses of the people in our country, we 
see 
that everyone is suffering from the high prices, and these small 
subsidies that are being given do not require all this debt 
infliction. We should be trying to prevent waste and 
extravagance. If the officials are telling the truth, let them 
look at how economical the development projects have been that 
were carried out. Weren't some of them carried out at two or 
three times what they should have cost? 
  Dr. Raja'i-Khorasani then noted: If there is really a proper 
policy in effect concerning self-sufficiency, it should be 
pursued. We must give the good news as soon as possible that the 
production line for these experimental models, which were built 
have gone into operation. We must try to end our need as soon as 
possible for items being purchased, for which some very 
inadvisable things have been done. 
<H5>  Legislation </H5>
  The first item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles 
session was the single-consultation Bill on the Government of 
the Islamic Republic of Iran's Membership in the Islamic 
Insurance Investments and Export Credits Company and the 
Purchase of 5,000 Shares of the Aforementioned Company Valued at 
5 Million Islamic Dinars, of which Article 1 was approved by the 
deputies. 
  Article 1: The government is authorized to join the Islamic 
Insurance Investments and Export Credits Company affiliated with 
the Islamic Development Bank and to be a charter subscriber to 
5,000 of its shares, valued at 1,000 dinars each, or $130 
million, and to add to the company's future investments with the 
approval of the Council of Ministers. 
  The second item on the agenda was the report from the second 
consultation of the Administrative and Employment Affairs 
Commission on the Bill Exempting Nursing Retirees From the Age 
Requirements for Retirement Given in Note 1, Article 2 of the 
National Retirement and Compulsory Service Law Regulations 
Amendment Law, of which Article 1 was approved. 
  Article 1: Nursing Retirees, on the condition that they have 
at least 20 years service in the aforementioned employment, are 
exempt from the age requirements given in Note 1, Article 2, of 
the National Retirement and Compulsory Service Law Regulations 
Amendment Law, enacted 12/13/1368 [3 March 1990]. 
  The third item on the agenda was the report from the Housing 
and Urban Construction Commission concerning the Bill 
Authorizing the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran To 
Join the International Maritime Rescue Convention, and this bill 
was approved by the Majles. 
  The next item on the agenda was the report from the first

Commission concerning the Bill Amending Article 8 of the Iran 
Handicraft Industries Organization Charter, the general form of

Budget Organization and the minister of the reconstruction 
crusade, respectively, are added to the general assembly of the 
Iran Handicraft Industries Organization. 
  The final item on the agenda was the report from the first

<H5>  Letter From More Than 180 Majles Deputies Condemning the </H5>
Siege of Gorazde by the Serbs 
  Once again one of the greatest human tragedies has taken 
place in the heart of so-called civilized Europe, and oppressed 
Gorazde in Bosnia and Herzegovina is burning in a ring of fire 
and blood as the result of the crimes of the aggressor Serbs. 
The oppressed cries for mercy from innocent children, 
defenseless women and besieged men can be heard through the 
vicious flames and Serbian crimes. 
  For two years the Serbs, armed to the teeth and with a clear 
green light from the Unied Nations and criminal America, with 
the support of the Russians and with the deathly silence and 
implicit approval of most of the European governments, have 
besieged this oppressed city. Periodically, using a heavy 
arsenal of firepower and even chemical weapons, they have 
flattened and bloodied its defenseless residents. 
  The United Nations, which claims to support peace and 
security for this city, made a false claim of creating a safety 
zone, giving the oppressed people of this city a false sense of 
security, yet on the other hand it completely insists on 
continuing the arms embargo against the oppressed Muslims of 
Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the face of all these clear crimes by 
the criminal Serbs and the clear violation of international 
regulations, it has adopted an approving silence and it will not 
even condemn these crimes verbally. With this encouragement, the 
criminals have continued with their crimes. 
  The UN Security Council has opposed the proposal by Islamic 
nations, including the Islamic Republic of Iran, that they join 
the UN peace-keeping forces, and in practice they have given the 
bloodthirsty Serbs a free hand to commit any kind of crime. 
  The tragedy in Gorazde is clear evidence of shame for the 
United Nations and the Western governments claiming to support 
human rights, and it is a blot of shame on the history of 
humanity, which took place and in the proximity of the European 
neighbors of Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
  We Majles deputies announce our regret at the occurrence of 
such a human tragedy. We condemn the United Nations, the 
secretary-general, and the governments supporting and 
encouraging the Serbs for their approving silence in the face of 
all these crimes. In obedience to the orders of the exalted 
leader, we declare our full readiness to give any kind of aid 
and assistance to the oppressed and defenseless people of 
Gorazde in Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
  Signed by 180 deputies

  [Excerpts] Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Division. 
The Majles met yesterday chaired by Dr. Rowhani, and the 
deputies from the cities of Ardebil, Kuhdasht, Saravan, and 
Tehran gave speeches. 
  Then the deputy speaker of the Majles gave a speech in which 
he offered congratulations on the birth of His Holiness Reza 
(peace be upon him) and condemned the recent crimes by the Serbs 
in Gorazde. The full text of his speech was printed in the 
previous issue. Then the Majles took up its agenda. 
  We direct the attention of our esteemed readers to the 
detailed proceedings. 
<H5>  Legislation </H5>
<H5>  Bill Forming Rural Water and Sewage Companies </H5>
  The first item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles 
session was continued consideration of the report from the 
Administrative and Employment Affairs Commission's first 
consultation on the Bill Forming Rural Water and Sewage 
Companies, the general form of which was approved with 118 votes 
in favor, 59 opposing votes, and 30 abstentions. 
  Based on this bill, the Ministry of the Reconstruction 
Crusade is authorized to create a company in each province for 
the purpose of utilizing, developing, and recreating the 
installations for procuring drinking water in the rural areas 
(including purification plants, transfer lines, storage tanks, 
control systems and other things) and hygienically flushing 
sewage. 
  Note 2 in this bill also provides that the credits needed in 
these companies to carry out the duties given in this law will 
be procured by collecting service fees from consumers and, if 
necessary, through government aid. 
  The points for discussion in the bill's rejection by the 
Administrative and Employment Affairs Commission include the 
following: 
  1 - The structure of the rural water and sewage companies 
conforms to a great extent to the structure of the urban water 
and sewage companies, yet in the existing conditions there 
should be major structural differences. 
  2 - The bill presented provides for the formation of an 
urban 
water and sewage company in Tehran with company centers in the 
provinces and company centers in the cities, which will create 
major organizations. 
  3 - The above organizational hierarchy will need many 
specialists and experienced personnel, which do not exist now in 
the rural water division of the Ministry of the Reconstruction 
Crusade, and if it is possible to hire them it will be costly. 
  4 - In the bill presented, the rural water and sewage 
companies will be responsible only for operating rural water and 
sewage services, and thus in effect the Ministry of the 
Reconstruction Crusade's rural water division will remain intact. 
  5 - In practice the rural areas adjacent to the cities in 
most areas are connected with the urban water delivery networks, 
and many rural areas will connect to the urban networks on the 
same basis. 
  Likewise, the rural areas adjacent to the pipelines 
transferring water to the cities will benefit from this 
privilege. 
  The large rural areas have gradually acquired mayoral 
offices 
and have applied to be connected to the service territories of 
the urban water and sewage companies. Thus few rural areas will 
be covered by rural water and sewage companies. 
<H5>  International Rural Traffic Convention [as published] </H5>
  The second item on the agenda was the report from the 
Housing 
and Urban Construction Commission concerning the Bill Adding 
Iran to the International Maritime Traffic Convention, enacted 
by the International Maritime Organization in 1344 [21 March 
1965-20 March 1966], or 1365 [21 March 1986-20 March 1987] in 
the Christian Era, and this bill was approved by the deputies. 
<H5>  Conditions for Choosing Ministry of Justice Judges </H5>
  The third item on the agenda was the report from the first 
consultation of the Judicial and Legislative Affairs Commission 
concerning the Bill To Amend Note 5 of the Law Appending Five 
Notes to the Law on Conditions for Choosing Ministry of Justice 
Judges, enacted in 1363 [21 March 1984-20 March 1985], continued 
consideration of which was postponed to the next session. 
  Based on Note 5 of this law, the chief of the judicial power 
may also select women who have the qualifications for Ministry 
of Justice judges approved 2/14/1361 [4 May 1982] and they may 
be hired as judges serving as consultants to the court of 
administrative justice, the special civil courts, judicial 
aides, investigators, workers in legal research offices, 
compiling judicial laws, managing the supervision of minors, and 
practicing in legal and other offices with judicial positions. 
<H5>  No'i Aqdam, Deputy From Ardebil </H5>
  The Second Five-Year Plan is the only opportunity the Fourth 
Majles will have to implement precisely Article 48 of the 
Constitution. 
  The first preagenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles 
session was No'i Aqdam, deputy from Ardebil. During his speech 
he said one of the tasks of the Majles last year was to study 
and approve the Second Five-Year Plan. He said: In view of this 
opportunity, it is necessary for the Majles specialist 
commissions to study the strengths and weakness of the First 
Five-Year Plan with the cooperation of the experts so they will 
have the awareness necessary in compiling the Second Five-Year 
Plan to emphasize the strengths and cover the weaknesses. 
  He discussed the failure to implement Article 48 of the 
Constitution. He said: This article states that there must be no 
discrimination in the utilization of natural resources, the use 
of national revenues in the provinces, and in the distribution 
of economic activities among the nation's various regions and 
provinces. Every region that has the need and the ability to 
grow should have the necessary investment and resources 
available to do so. Unfortunately, there are many indications on 
the basis of which one may claim that in the 15 years of the 
Islamic revolution there has been in some way discrimination and 
injustice in the distribution of national projects and in 
allocating credits for the nation's various provinces. 
  No'i Aqdam discussed the public expectation that 
discrimination will be eliminated in the distribution of 
treasury funds and that social justice will be carefully 
observed. He said: The Second Five-Year Plan is the only 
opportunity the Fourth Majles will have to precisely implement 
Article 48 of the Constitution. 
  Continuing, he thanked the president of the republic and the 
Council of Ministers for starting the province of Ardebil. With 
regard to the note below Article 1 in the Law Establishing the 
Province of Ardebil, he asked for the division of the resources 
between the provinces of East Azarbaijan and Ardebil. 
  Continuing, No'i Aqdam asked the Administrative and 
Employment Affairs Organization and the Ministry of Education 
and Training to help with changing the Ardebil Office of 
Education and Training to two districts and he asked the Majles 
and the government for help determining the employment status of 
60,000 salaried teachers and instructors. 
  The deputy then discussed the anxiety of the students at the 
nation's teacher-training centers and colleges concerning 
employment issues. He said: The government knows that before 
these dear ones were accepted they were promised special 
privileges such as being definitely hired, being exempt from the 
compulsory service system, and room and board. In return for 
these privileges they promised that as graduates they would meet 
the education and training needs for at least five years in the 
region where they were accepted as part of the quota. It appears 
that making these dear ones anxious and disturbed about their 
future and their destiny will solve nothing at this time, and 
hiring and employing them is one of the commitments accepted by 
the Ministry of Education and training. 
<H5>  'Ali Emamirad, Deputy From Kuhdasht </H5>
  Isn't the genocide in Bosnia and Herzegovina for the crime 
of 
believing in Islam by the American-led infidel world a violation 
of human rights? 
  The next speaker was Emamirad, deputy from Kuhdasht. During 
his speech he said: The rightful expectation of the people of 
Lorestan is that all the executive officials at the center and 
in the province will implement the orders from the president of 
the republic in the shortest time possible concerning the 
alleviation of deprivation, industrializing the province, making 
the best use of existing water by building dams and pumps for 
the purpose of obtaining energy and developing agriculture, and 
in general developing the province and making it progress to 
make up for the backwardness. 
  The speaker discussed the unprecedented welcome for the 
president of the republic by the people of Lorestan and the 
municipality of Kuhdasht. He commemorated Army Day and 
emphasized the tendentious report from Galindo Pohl concerning 
human rights violations in Iran. He said: We ask the lying and 
mercenary people who prepared this report, on what principle do 
you justify making a report without any evidence or 
documentation? Isn't this like a puppet show? Aren't the 
genocide in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the killing of defenseless 
deprived people in Somalia and the slaughter of the people of 
Palestine for being free and believing in Islam and thousands of 
other disgraceful crimes all over the world by the American-led 
infidel world violations of human rights? 
  Continuing, he added: The dear policymakers in educational 
affairs must realize that as long as they consider spending 
money on cultural and educational affairs to be an expense and 
not an investment, as long as they consider the focal point for 
development to be agriculture, industry and other things and not 
committed, specialist and skilled manpower, we must not expect 
to see growth and progress in society and in the country. 
  At the end of his speech he said: Past experience has proved 
that the nations who have climbed the latter of advancement and 
reached their goals are the ones who first made major and 
fundamental investments in this area. 
<H5>  Rezazehi, Deputy From Saravan </H5>
  One of the major reasons young people in the border areas 
are 
turning to narcotics is the failure to create employment and 
sound recreation. 
  The next speaker was Rezazehi, deputy from Saravan. During 
his speech he condemned the crimes of the Serbs in the city of 
Gorazde and he discussed the deprivation in the province of 
Sistan va Baluchestan. He discussed alleviating deprivation and 
helping with development in the Saravan area. He said: One of 
the major reasons the young people in the deprived border areas 
are turning to narcotics is the failure to create employment and 
sound recreation and the lack of educational and sports 
facilities. For this reason I ask Ministry of Guidance and the 
Physical Training Organization to procure credits and build 
cultural and sports complexes such as libraries, gyms, and 
cultural space in this region. 
  Continuing, the speaker added: Saravan has luminous talents 
in the areas of knowledge and scholarship. Unfortunately, due to 
the lack of resources and educational space and the remoteness 
of the universities, these talents have not had the opportunity 
to flourish, and this has led to a shortage of specialist 
personnel. 
  The deputy from Saravan thanked the officials from the Free 
University for establishing the Saravan Free University and he 
asked for its development. Rezazehi asked the minister of roads 
to provide more credits to build and maintain the Saravan roads. 
  In conclusion, the deputy from Saravan asked the minister of 
roads and transportation to help build an airport in Saravan, 
and he asked the minister of the reconstruction crusade to help 
with the construction of a flood wall and earth dams. 
<H5>  Maryam Behruzi, Deputy From Tehran </H5>
  In the last 10 years, in the shelter of the Islamic 
government, Iran has created good successes for women. 
  Ms. Behruzi, deputy from Tehran, was the final preagenda 
speaker. [passages omitted on U.S. and other countries' 
aggressive positions throughout the world.] 
  The deputy from Tehran discussed the situation of women's 
rights in Iran. She said: Today a subject of discussion in 
international gatherings is the issue of women's rights, 
equality between men and women, the elimination of any kind of 
discrimination, developing the economic, social, and cultural 
situation of women, women holding political and management 
positions, raising the position of women, eliminating 
oppression, aggression and violence against women, family 
issues, children's rights, and the welfare and health of elderly 
women. 
  She added: All these issues were discussed at the recent 
meeting of the Union of Women Parliamentary Deputies, due to the 
approach of the Fourth International Congress of Women. In the 
last decade the presence of women in political, management, 
academic, and social positions has increased significantly, but 
despite all these things, today women have not reached the level 
that is specific to Islam, either in terms of their human 
personality, social rights, self-possession or laws that include 
them. Despite the evil discrimination against women by the 
imperialist powers, I announce with full confidence that Iran, 
in the shelter of the Islamic government and in the light of its 
exalted values and enlightened viewpoint concerning women, is 
one of the few nations that have had good successes for women in 
the last 10 years. 
  Continuing her remarks, Ms. Behruzi noted: While the number 
of women parliamentary representatives has decreased from 13 
percent to 11 percent in the world, the number of women deputies 
in the Majles has doubled in the last 10 years. 
  She added: In the Western nations 65 percent of the people 
live outside the family, and the other 35 percent who have 
formed families are not that attached to the family. This is 
truly disastrous. In Iran the family is the most important 
pillar of society, and attachment to the family is considered 
the most valuable social ethic. 
  The speaker said granting maternity pay in the country is 
one 
of the most progressive laws. She discussed the hostility to 
women in the European nations. She said: In Islamic Iran, where 
the valuable teachings of Islam and Islamic culture are 
employed, first of all such an issue does not exist as a social 
problem, and second, thanks to the Islamic revolution and the 
worthy services of the Imam's (peace be upon him) Aid Committee, 
the problem of needy women and children has also been solved. 
  She harshly condemned the silence of the United Nations 
before the slaughter of the defenseless people of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina. She added: Unfortunately the European nations are 
selfishly pursuing their own objectives at the price of killing 
the people near them. On the other hand we see that the Security 
Council, on the pretext that some Islamic nations are not 
neutral, has banned their peacekeeping forces from Bosnia and 
Herzegovina. 
  In conclusion Ms. Behruzi said: The deputies have shown 
their 
awareness and their principled approach by approving 
infrastructure and fateful laws. It is expected that before the 
international conference on women in 1995, serious steps will be 
taken to amend and approve the remaining laws pertaining to the 
rights of women and the family. In this regard. priority goes to 
approving the Women and Family Affairs Commission in order to 
have a powerful center for creating legal relations in the 
law-making dimension.

  [Excerpt] Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Division. 
The Majles met yesterday morning chaired by Hojjat ol-Eslam 
val-Moslemin Nateq-Nuri and the deputies from the cities of 
Salmas, Tehran, Minab and Mashhad gave speeches. Then the 
speaker of the Majles gave a speech in which he condemned the 
crimes of the bloodthirsty Serbs against the defenseless Muslims 
of Bosnia and Hercegovina, which was printed in yesterday's 
issue. Then the Majles took up its agenda, the details of which 
are printed below. 
<H5>  Fathollah Reza'i, Deputy From Salmas </H5>
  The members of the Council of Ministers, by increasing the 
rates for mail, telephone service, water and electrical power, 
are themselves taking a step down the road to increasing high 
prices. 
  Reza'i, deputy from Salmas, was the first preagenda speaker 
at yesterday's open Majles session. In his speech he 
commemorated the martyrdom anniversary of Professor Motahari and 
offered congratulations on Teacher Day and Worker Day. He said: 
Every moment and everywhere in the world where the cries to 
heaven of freedom-loving people are to be heard, as in the 
Muslim nations of Sudan, Somalia, and in free countries such as 
Nicaragua and Panama, the unworthy and inadequate UN 
policymakers, in collaboration with the world's plundering 
nations led by criminal America, are busy mercilessly 
suppressing and killing the freedom seekers in those countries. 
  He discussed the slaughter of the Muslims of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina by the criminal Serbs, and in other parts of the 
world. He said: Unfortunately the Muslim nations, with their 
silence, are consenting to these crimes. Only the Islamic 
Republic of Iran, with the prophetic leadership of its exalted 
leader, has responded positively to the cries of the Muslims of 
Bosnia and Herzegovina and other freedom-seeking people, and is 
revealing their oppression in a world full of infidelity and 
atheism. 
  He added: In this wide world, has anyone ever asked the 
secretary-general whether human rights are invoked only to 
defend murderers and international smugglers? 
  In visits to the camps for Azeri refugees run by the Red 
Crescent in Parsabad, I saw for myself the depth of the plot. 
According to the existing statistics, more than 1 million 
defenseless people are refugees from their own countries. The 
Red Crescent has more than 53,000 of these people in its care in 
Azerbaijan, where it is treating them with Islamic concern and 
kindness. 
  Continuing, the deputy from Salmas expressed thanks for Dr. 
Vahid Dastjerdi's management of the Red Crescent. With regard to 
the problems and difficulties in his electoral district, he 
mentioned the importance of the geographic position of the 
Salmas Plain, and noted that preliminary studies on the 
possibility of doing a water exploration project in the Salmas 
Plain were done in the years 1348-1351 [21 March 1969-20 March 
1973] by engineers from the former Yugoslavia. Studies on the 
reservoir dam, the power plant, the diversionary dam and the 
irrigation and drainage network were completed through the end 
of phases I and II. In the year 1357 [21 March 1978-20 March 
1979] construction began on the plain's irrigation and drainage 
network, and the work stopped after nine months. 
  He issued memoranda to the officials in charge concerning 
the 
creation of a labor market and confronting and resisting the 
cultural invasion caused by the country's strategic, political, 
and cultural composition and by its geographic social 
composition. 
  He mentioned unemployment as one of the problems of the 
people of the region and noted: The activation of tens of 
television channels in the region has caused individuals to be 
pierced by the sharp spear of the West's cultural invasion. I 
implore cultural officials to take basic steps to create sound 
recreational areas. 
  Reza'i discussed the spoilage of some agricultural crops due 
to the lack of conversion industries in the region. He asked 
officials to take steps to provide guaranteed purchases of 
agricultural crops. 
  Increasing and multiplying inflation and high prices for 
various goods and items needed by the public have placed the 
oppressed nation in the grip of a vise. The members of the 
Council of Ministers must come to the aid of this nation. They 
must not increase the high prices themselves by raising the 
rates for mail, telephone service, water and electrical power 
instead of anchoring inflation and solving the problems of high 
prices. 
  He asked for help from the minister of health care, 
treatment 
and medical education to open the Salmas hospital, and from the 
minister of education and training to solve the problem and 
determine the status of residential areas in the vicinity of 
educational areas, and to pay the profit differentials on loans. 
<H5>  'Ali Movahedi-Saveji, Deputy From Tehran </H5>
  The government has not made the proper decisions concerning 
the control of prices of goods and materials and dealing with 
those who sell at high prices. 
  The second preagenda speaker was Movahedi-Saveji, deputy 
from 
Tehran. In his speech he discussed the events of Ordibehesht [21 
April-21 May]. He said: Although the enemies of the revolution, 
especially in the current century, have set out to destroy the 
Muslims, now in Palestine, Kashmir, Bosnia and Herzegovina and 
in other nations and regions we see that world imperialism and 
domestic despots are attacking Muslims with propaganda, 
pressure, and severe torture in order to suppress their faith, 
their desire for Islam, and their religion. 
  He then added: There are two factors in the glory, 
greatness, 
and progress of Islam and the Muslims. As long as these two 
factors exist among the Muslims, no danger or enemy can destroy 
them. One is awareness, and the other is jihad and struggle for 
faith and belief. 
  Although in Bosnia and Herzegovina we are witnessing the 
most 
savage aggression, crimes, and genocide against the Muslim 
people of that region, ultimately Islam will cast its shadow in 
that region and throughout the world and the Muslims will be 
victorious. 
  The deputy from Tehran then discussed domestic issues. He 
said: While I fully support the government, its work has been 
naive and insufficient in some areas. 
  One of these issues is the struggle against selling at high 
prices. It would be possible to set prices in the proper way for 
all goods and materials and there could be a system and control. 
I myself go to the square and to the market to buy what I need 
to live. You also know that there is no problem with shortages 
of goods and materials. The problem is the government's failure 
to control and supervise the prices of goods. 
  He emphasized: Unfortunately, sellers have been left to 
their 
own devices. A piece of fruit has a certain price in the main 
square in Tehran, but the prices in stores are up to double that 
amount. This is a question of weak management. It is a problem 
of lack of leadership, making the proper decisions concerning 
prices and dealing with the criminals who sell at high prices. 
We know of individuals who have put tens of millions of tumans 
in their pockets in less than five years with just a little 
fruit stand, and have bought 40- to 50-million-tuman homes right 
here in Tehran. 
  I strongly protest the economic policies, and especially the 
issue of price controls. I say to the government, even if you 
intended to test to see if the prices had found their true 
levels, enough is enough, because the test itself has failed. 
<H5>  Seyyed 'Ali Mirkhalil, Deputy From Minab </H5>
  Basic thinking must be done concerning inflation and high 
prices. 
  The third preagenda speaker was Mirkhalil, deputy from 
Minab. 
During his speech he discussed the fact that we must stand up 
against all the plots without ceremony. He said: We know that 
America is plotting. It has opened a second front, where it is 
making mischief in the country with paid and unpaid agents. 
However, with God's grace, America has gotten nothing but shame 
and defamation. 
  He said: With America's disgraceful defeats in Somalia and 
Haiti, the oppressed people must realize that American 
invincibility is nothing but a myth. 
  He then said: It is clear that the government has done less 
in Minab, Rudan, and Jasek than it has done in other parts of 
the country. These areas have the least amounts of piped water, 
electrical power, suitable rural roads, schools, treatment 
centers, and health clinics. The number of rural areas with 
electrical power can be counted on the fingers of one hand, and 
a great many villages are completely without electrical power, 
water, rahnema'i schools, or treatment centers. 
  The speaker added: God knows what happens to children and 
indigent patients, with the air and water pollution and the 
distance of up to 10 hours from the hospital. Are we willing to 
spend even one day in that deprived villager's place, where 
patients die from the heat and on impassable roads? The 
government must not be satisfied merely with getting reports 
from the relevant organizations, making trips in the winter and 
on New Year's, stopping at Qeshm Island and then going back to 
Tehran. They should come in the summer and see Jasek and the 
desert, where water is supplied by tanker trucks. 
  This is surprising. What happened to these people's share of 
all that government iron, construction materials, housing loans, 
and other credits that were distributed? According to the people 
themselves in these rural areas, no official has been there and 
nothing has been done to solve their problems. 
  Do some officials even know how to pronounce the names of 
these villages? He thanked the speaker of the Majles for voting 
to provide electrical power to 100 rural areas. He said: The 
work of the reconstruction crusade in providing electrical power 
to 100 rural areas will be reminiscent of the splendid 
operations of the dear crusaders at the war fronts, and that 
will keep alive the atmosphere at the fronts. I ask the deputies 
and the Ministry of the Reconstruction Crusade to help with the 
full implementation of our electrical power service project. 
  He noted that the government must make every effort to 
establish the security expected by the people. He said: The 
existing situation does not provide the security that is 
expected and satisfactory for the people. I ask the minister of 
the interior either to provide the region's security himself or 
to assign responsibility for the area's security to the 
revolution guards. Security is not a development project that 
can be done next year if not done this year. If an innocent 
person is killed due to naivete and if the Ministry of the 
Interior does not make a decision to reinforce the region's 
security management, won't the minister of the interior have to 
answer to God and the people? 
  He then discussed the nation's economic problems. He 
emphasized: Basic thinking must be done about inflation and high 
prices. We must get out of this current price situation and give 
attention to the principle of price control. If the government 
does not put the brakes on this speeding machine of high prices, 
is it clear what it will do to the low-income people? 
  The government must do more to employ the local manpower 
that 
is knowledgeable, able and concerned, and in some cases it must 
refrain from treating them unkindly. Mirkhalil called for an 
investigation into the reasons for the region's deprivation and 
unemployment, and he noted: The sea is a divine blessing. The 
government must invest to make maximum use of this blessing and 
to eliminate unemployment and false occupations. 
  Among the problems in his electoral district he cited the 
lack of water in the area, the failure to dredge existing 
estuaries, the lack of a university, the unusability of the road 
from Jasek to Bashagerd and the lack of a hospital, and he asked 
for solutions. 
<H5>  Qadiseh 'Alavi, Deputy From Mashhad </H5>
  The Muslim nation of Iran is completely prepared to support 
and help the Muslims of Bosnia. 
  The final preagenda speaker was Ms. 'Alavi, deputy from 
Mashhad. She offered congratulations on the birth of Imam Reza 
(peace be upon him), and she discussed the willing response from 
the public to the leader's call for support of the Muslim people 
of Bosnia and Herzegovina. She said: At this time endless 
oppression is supported by the United Nations, and wickedness 
and bloodletting have reached the point where the Serbs are 
attacking safe zones. [passages omitted on Serbian activities] 
  He called on the exalted leader to issue an order forming an 
Islamic United Nations. The question, remains, how long will 
Iran remain a member of this lying, deceptive organization, 
which so far has done nothing to defend Muslims and the real 
rights of humanity? Of what benefit is it to Muslims when this 
organization's secretary-general stands by while children are 
killed in the wombs of their mothers and women and children are 
being attacked, when Gorazde, which was a safe zone, is 
transformed into a killing ground for innocent women and 
children, while he just watches and lowers his lip? What is the 
benefit of cooperating and continuing relations with elements 
whose state of mind is obvious and whose character is weak? 
  What policy have the government leaders of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran adopted in this regard? 
  I ask the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, what is the need for 
us to remain in an organization whose secretary-general's hands 
are stained with the blood of thousands of innocent Muslims? 
Isn't it time for the Muslim nations to protest all this 
injustice and oppression by forming a free United Nations and 
getting out of the yoke of imperialism and exploitation? The 
Muslim nation of Iran is entirely ready to rush to the aid of 
the Muslim nations of Bosnia and Gorazde, and the women of our 
Islamic society are certainly waiting for the exalted leader's 
order to support the people of Bosnia. 
  Ms. 'Alavi said: The women deputies in the Majles, 
representing all of society and especially the women, have 
declared and are declaring that they have any kind of readiness 
necessary to answer the divine call from the exalted leader of 
the Islamic revolution to support the tormented people of 
Bosnia, and especially the women and children of Gorazde. 
  In conclusion, she discussed the attempted assassination of 
the temporary Friday Imam of Mashhad, and she issued a memo in 
this regard to the relevant officials. 
<H5>  Legislation </H5>
<H5>  Amendment of Law on Conditions for Choosing Judges </H5>
  The first item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles 
session was continued consideration of the report from the first 
consultation of the Judicial and Legislative Affairs Commission 
concerning the Bill on Note 5 of the Law Appending Five Notes to 
the Law on Conditions for Choosing Judges. 
  This bill provides that "the chief of the judicial power may 
select women who have the qualifications for Ministry of Justice 
judges approved 2/14/1361 [4 May 1982] and they may be hired as 
judges to serve as counselors to the court of administrative 
justice, the special civil courts, examining magistrate, 
assistant public prosecutor, managing the supervision of minors, 
and practicing in legal and other offices with judicial 
positions." 
  After this bill was discussed and studied by the deputies, 
Mr. Nateq-Nuri spoke in support of the principle of the bill. He 
said: The question being discussed in this bill is legal 
counsel, not judicial practice. Counsel has not been prohibited 
in Islam. We must not indulge in the limited thinking that we 
should even prohibit counseling by women. In the special civil 
court, where most of the family issues are discussed, the women 
have many problems, which they cannot explain to men. The best 
help for them is women who know the law. 
  The speaker of the Majles then said: What is the problem 
with 
doing this? Aren't mobilization members serving as court 
bailiffs? If the mobilization sisters encounter a situation, 
they notify the judicial power and they pursue it. Thus the same 
research judge (consultant) will also serve the purpose at the 
same place. What is the problem with this? What is the meaning 
of all these slogans and talk in defense of women at the podium, 
if we reject this bill? Is rejection of this bill a defense of 
women's rights? 
  Mr. Nateq-Nuri discussed the fact that if this bill provides 
for judicial activity for women, the Guardian Council will 
reject it. He said: In view of the fact that the bill's second 
consultation is before us, some of the problems can be resolved 
in the details. 
  Among the points for discussion on this bill is its 
rejection 
by the Judicial Affairs Commission. The commission expert 
mentioned the reasons for rejecting the bill. During a speech he 
said: Because the Law Eliminating the Positions of Examining 
Magistrate and Assistant Public Prosecutor has only recently 
been passed in the Majles, the new position called "research 
judge" has been created in which women can serve and the 
position of counselor in the special civil courts has also been 
eliminated, therefore, a bill cannot now be brought to the 
Majles that violates a recently enacted law. Therefore, 
opposition to this bill is not opposition to the work of women 
graduates in judicial law, it is due to the elimination of the 
jobs of examining magistrate and assistant public public 
prosecutor. 
  Then the general form of the bill was put to a vote and 
approved. 
<H5>  Amended Izmir Protocol </H5>
  The second item on the agenda was the report from the 
Foreign 
Policy Commission concerning the Amended Izmir Treaty Protocol 
Bill, which was approved by the deputies. 
  Article 1: The Amended Izmir Treaty Protocol between the 
governments of Iran, Pakistan, and Turkey, dated 21 Esfand 1355 
[11 March 1977], as an amendment to the Amended Izmir Treaty 
Protocol dated 28 Khordad 1369 [18 June 1980], consisting of 18 
paragraphs and including new members of ECO (the republics of 
Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, 
Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan) and other aspects implemented, which 
was signed by the Governments of the Islamic Republic of Iran, 
the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, and the Republic of Turkey in 
Islamabad on 7 Azar 1371, corresponding to 28 November 1992, is 
approved as a supplement and authorization is given to add it. 
<H5>  Amendment to Majles Internal Guidelines </H5>
  The next item on the agenda was the report from the second 
consultation of the Internal Guidelines Commission concerning 
the Motion To Append One Note to Article 146 and One Note to 
Article 148 of the Majles Internal Guidelines, of which Article 
1 was approved. 
<H5>  Article 1 </H5>
  1 - The following note is appended to Article 146 of the 
Majles Internal Guidelines:

  [Text] Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Division. The 
Majles met in open session yesterday chaired by Mr. Nateq-Nuri, 
and the deputies from the cities of Tehran, Torbat-e Jam, 
Shahr-e Kord, and Damavand and Firuzkuh gave speeches. Then the 
Majles took up its agenda, and we direct the attention of our 
esteemed readers to the detailed proceedings. 
<H5>  'Abbas'ali 'Amid-Zanjani, Deputy From Tehran </H5>
  Eighty percent of the nation's problems have to do with the 
weak and naive performance of duties. 
  The first preagenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles 
session was 'Amid-Zanjani, deputy from Tehran. During his speech 
he discussed the martyrdom anniversary of Master Motahari, and 
he discussed a statement from His Holiness the Imam (peace be 
upon him) concerning the mission of making the universities 
Islamic. He said: We hope that in this opportunity for the 
nation's higher education, all those working in science, 
research, and education will seek to achieve this sacred goal 
more quickly. 
  He then said: Those who are desperately working behind the 
scenes of these activities to create fear and ultimately to 
revive harshness in the country must realize that harshness in 
this Islamic nation, in these circumstances with the 
establishment of the government and the deepening of the 
revolution, benefits no one, and the ones most subject to it 
will be those who have started it. 
  The deputy from Tehran discussed the Voice and Vision of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran Supervision Council. He said: The 
Majles selected deputies for membership in this council, and Mr. 
Hoseyni and I were appointed to serve in this capacity. We know 
that the Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
Supervision Council replaced the Voice and Vision of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran Supervisory Council in the revision of the 
Constitution, and that this council's responsibilities have been 
precisely specified in the law approved by the Interests 
Discernment Council. After a short delay, the Constitutional 
Revision Council was formed for various reasons, and has so far 
taken great strides to organize itself to perform the council's 
lawful duties. 
  He added: These include compiling the relevant guidelines 
and 
creating appropriate organizations for carrying out the 
responsibilities of constitutional revision and supervising the 
Voice and Vision Organization of the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
  In this regard, programs have been selected as models and 
have been evaluated by expert and experienced people. These 
programs include programs for the New Year's celebration and for 
children. In this regard I must say that the previous management 
took steps to achieve the goals set by the organization. There 
were malfunctions, and the new management appointed by order of 
the exalted leader took very great and constructive steps. 
  Continuing his remarks, 'Amid-Zanjani discussed the arrival 
of the time for the Mecca pilgrimage rites. He said: We hope 
this year the obligations and rites of the pilgrimage will be 
performed to achieve the goals of Abraham's pilgrimage, that the 
Government of Saudi Arabia, which claims to be guarding the 
shrines and to be serving the pilgrims, will act on this claim 
sincerely, that it will not obstruct the performance of rites, 
which are a part of the essence of Abraham's pilgrimage (purging 
polytheists), and that this year's pilgrims, like those in 
previous years, will be able to perform their pilgrimage 
obligations as commanded by Koran and Islamic law. 
  He discussed the issue of the work ethic. He said: The 
revival of this great Islamic tradition, the call for which we 
are hearing from society's leader, is really a call that was 
issued with deep forcefulness in the first days by the Prophet 
of Islam. 
  In any case, this is a cultural slogan which, if 
implemented, 
can solve many of our problems, even the economic and social 
ones. Perhaps 80 percent of the nation's problems have to do 
with this very problem of weak and naive performance of duties. 
  The speaker then addressed the deputies. He said: In Article 
72 of the Constitution we see that the Majles and the deputies 
are prohibited from enacting bills and motions that are in 
conflict with the criteria of the pure religious laws of Islam. 
The meaning of the above article is that the Majles cannot enact 
anything it sees as being in conflict with religious law. Some 
people think this is the duty of the Guardian Council and that 
it is only the Guardian Council that must concern itself with 
whether something is contrary to religious law or not. This is a 
great mistake. The Constitution has prohibited the Majles and 
the deputies from approving any laws or bills that are in any 
way in conflict with the criteria of Islam. Therefore, each 
deputy must take the steps necessary to determine which motion 
or bill is in violation of Islamic criteria and which is not. 
  It is no excuse for any deputy not to know what is in 
violation of the criteria of Islam. 
<H5>  Mohammad Hoseyni, Deputy From Torbat-e Jam </H5>
  Through obedience to the commands from the exalted leader 
concerning the work ethic and social order, a civilization 
worthy of the Islamic Republic of Iran must be established. 
  The next speaker was Mohammad Hoseyni, deputy from Torbat-e 
Jam. During his speech he said: One of the problems and 
afflictions besetting many developing nations is the lack of 
suitable and enduring economic policies to put economic issues 
in order. These nations use short-term and unstable policies to 
deal with their economic problems. 
  In the same regard he said: Improved economic polices could 
increase the average return on economic projects by 50 to 100 
percent. Therefore, putting the economic issues in order needs 
stabilization of government policies, and it is hoped that this 
will be achieved in the Second Five-Year Plan. The speaker then 
discussed the fact that exports are one of the most vital 
economic sectors in any nation. He said: To stabilize their 
economies, governments try to increase their national exports 
and to free themselves from having a single product. It is clear 
that the respected government is trying to liberate the economy 
from single-product exports. 
  He added: It is hoped that the government will give special 
attention to this important sector, that it will create 
industrial planning centers for exports, activate the export 
guarantee fund, activate the Nonoil Export Development 
Committee, create an exports information bank, create a 
permanent exhibition of export goods, establish regulations and 
criteria for the marketing of goods at export exhibitions, 
establish an export development institute, strengthen private 
export companies, establish a market development fund, and 
finally that it will revise the export organizations, in order 
to be able to achieve greater growth in the Second Five-Year 
Plan, meaning more than $23 billion. 
  Continuing, he said: The Third World nations, especially the 
Islamic nations and the Islamic Republic of Iran, must give 
special attention to the production, conversion, preservation, 
and sound distribution of foodstuffs. In this regard, in 
studying the Second Five-Year Plan the Majles must give the 
necessary attention to the production of food and to the related 
food industries. 
  The deputy from Torbat-e Jam discussed the efforts of the 
enemies of Islam to exaggerate problems and weakness by 
depicting public lack of confidence in the government. He said: 
This matter magnifies the duty of the officials and especially 
the deputies to explain the issues to the people. 
  He noted: Although failed efforts in the last few months by 
those who have submitted to imperialism, such as the dastardly 
attacks against the president of the republic and the temporary 
Friday imam of Mashhad, are proof that the enemy has been 
unsuccessful in this effort and has turned again to physical 
assassination. It is necessary, however, by explaining the 
government's luminous achievements in the First Five-Year Plan, 
to disappoint the enemy more than ever. 
  Hoseyni then discussed World Worker Day and offered 
congratulations to workers on this day. He expressed the hope 
that through obedience to the commands of the exalted leader, 
who has emphasized the two basic elements of the work ethic and 
social order, it will be possible to establish a civilization 
worthy of Islam and the Government of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran in the current century. 
  Continuing, the speaker said: Information from the Iran 
Statistics Center shows that the national literacy rate in the 
country for those six years of age and older in the year 1365 
[21 March 1986-20 March 1987] was 61.8 percent, and in the year 
1370 [21 March 1991-20 March 1992] this figure reached 74.1 
percent. At the same time, the result of a research project 
shows that 95 percent of the population in the compulsory 
education ages between six and 10 years were studying in the 
schools in the year 1370. It is necessary to offer 
congratulations on Teacher Week and Teacher Day to all those 
working in education and training, especially the esteemed 
teachers, for the unstinting efforts of teachers, managers, the 
administrative-educational cadre and others, and foremost among 
them it is necessary to praise and thank the committed and 
learned minister, the resourceful manager of the nation's 
education and training. 
  The deputy from Torbat-e Jam offered condolences on the 
martyrdom anniversary of Martyr Motahari and he issued memos to 
officials on the problems in his electoral district, as follows: 
to the minister of commerce on expediting the wheat storage and 
silo project, to the minister of roads and transportation to 
expedite widening the road from Fariman to Torbat-e Jam and 
Taybad, to the minister of the interior to expedite appointment 
of the governor of Taybad. 
  At the end of his speech the speaker also praised and 
thanked 
the minister of culture and higher education for ordering the 
creation of the government university, the minister of petroleum 
for expediting the gas delivery project, and the Khorasan 
general manager of industry and agriculture for giving special 
attention to Torbat-e Jam. 
<H5>  'Ali Mobini Dehkerdi, Deputy From Shahr-e Kord </H5>
  The Islamic government has presented a new way to manage a 
society and it has rejected and rejects imperialism and 
domination. 
  The next speaker was Mobini Dehkadeh'i [as published], 
deputy 
from Shahr-e Kord. During his speech he offered congratulations 
on Labor and Worker Week and Teacher Week. He added: In these 
sensitive times we commemorate the greatness of the position, 
rank and status of the martyr of the pen and Islamic thought, 
the great thinker and trainer of youth in the seminary and the 
university, Martyr Motahari, because this theologian and Islamic 
philosopher is the best model for officials, teachers, 
educators, ministry of education employees and professors. 
  He asked insiders to encourage society to study the works of 
Martyr Motahari. He said: The generosity of a human being and 
his wisdom, greatness and pride is found in the light of the 
life-giving orthodoxy of Islam. The Islamic government has 
presented a new road and path for the management of society and 
it rejects any kind of imperialism, exploitation, expansionism, 
domination or acceptance of domination. The martyr-nurturing, 
loyal, and sacrificing nation of Iran is proud to be the leading 
government of the world's oppressed, believers, pious, free, 
free-thinking and God-seeking people. 
  The speaker also said: Iran has begun an extensive and aware 
effort to cut its economic, cultural, social, and scientific 
dependence on oppressive nations, and to teach the world's 
thinkers and intellectuals that it is effective to live 
independently with self-reliance, belief in self and rejecting 
the selling of self through careful implementation of the 
commands of the Koran and the traditions of the esteemed Prophet 
of Islam. He then added: The world devourers, with the support 
of world imperialism, have trampled the primary human rights of 
societies and nations. With arrogance, vanity, hate, genocide, 
shamelessness, and heedlessness in the heart of Europe, they are 
secretly and openly trying to deprive the rich civilization of 
Islam in Bosnia and Herzegovina of the support of Islamic 
government. The Serbian genocide against Muslims, burning, and 
the aggression in Gorazde must be analyzed in this same 
connection. 
  The speaker discussed the defeat of imperialist policymakers 
in their efforts to resist and control Islam. He discussed the 
enactment of the Second Five-Year Plan in the year 1373 [21 
March 1994-20 March 1995] and then evaluated the First Five-Year 
Plan. He said: One of the important ways to anchor inflation and 
high prices and to support the oppressed classes in society is 
serious struggle against economic, government, and private 
monopolies, preventing collusion in the marketing of the goods 
needed by society, supervising the domestic market and setting 
prices justly. It is clear that the people must not pay the 
price of the inability of managers and their waste and 
extravagance in the form of existing monopolies. 
  He also added: The importance of transferring economic and 
executive activities to loans and privatization is possible 
through the creation of an organization independent of 
government organizations under the supervision of the Policy 
Council with representatives from the nation's three government 
powers, the judicial, the executive and the legislative. 
[sentence as published] Preventing social polarization, 
providing for public participation in production matters, 
aligning economic adjustment with the banking facilities given, 
transferring government resources and equipment to the people, 
and increasing the utilization coefficient requires more 
activity than has so far been carried out, so that the 
government can carry out its basic responsibilities with more 
peace of mind. 
  Continuing, the speaker said: Having administration that is 
strong and not subject to doubt in the reform of the nation's 
administrative and executive structure is one of the country's 
clear requirements today. Serious struggle against giant 
government, meeting the minimum needs of government employees, 
reducing the volume of the government and organizing the 
nation's revenues and expenditures are possible through serious 
and sincere cooperation between the government and the Majles. 
  The deputy from Shahr-e Kord then discussed the important 
role of the Voice and Vision organization and the media in 
promoting the culture of working, trying, and economizing. He 
said: A great religious and national duty is to establish 
Islamic values in society and to eliminate Western values 
expressed through the use of clothing, garments, industrial 
products and consumer goods. 
  Mobini Dehkerdi then cited strengthening and promoting the 
spirit of lawfulness among the nation's officials and the people 
and focusing on the Five-Year Plan instead of individual, 
organizational, and sector concerns in society as areas worthy 
of consideration in the nation's situation today. He said: An 
undeniable principle for achieving a nonoil economy is the 
adoption of clear and firm polices to reduce dependence in the 
government's annual budget on oil revenues during the Second 
Five-Year Plan, in such a way that it will be achieved by the 
end of the plan, with the development of nonoil exports and 
improved tax revenues based on the criterion of the incomes of 
society's classes. 
<H5>  Seyyed Ahmad Rasuli-Nezhad, Deputy From Damavand and Firuzkuh </H5>
  The Ministry of Roads and Transportation has raised the 
rates 
for train, aircraft, minibus and urban bus fares on its own 
initiative. 
  The final preagenda speaker was Rasuli-Nezhad, deputy from 
Firuzkuh. In his speech he severely condemned the killing and 
slaughter of the Muslims of Bosnia and Herzegovina. He said: The 
Security Council's lackeys react to everything that is against 
the interest of its permanent members. How do you justify the 
way it has dealt with the killing of Muslims at al-Khalil by the 
Zionists and the slaughter in Bosnia and Herzegovina at the 
hands of the bloodthirsty Serbs? 
  He said: It seems that this council issues a resolution 
every 
time the interests and security of the bullies, superpowers, 
world imperialists and their agents are threatened, and issues 
an order to put down the threat. What answer is the unworthy UN 
secretary-general giving to nations for all these crimes and and 
oppression? 
  He then discussed the problems in his electoral district. He 
said: Since the time the current minister took over, not only 
has the Ministry of Roads and Transportation failed to act on 
the decisions that have been made and to remove the burden from 
the shoulders of the people, it has created many problems and 
severe dissatisfaction for the people. This includes raising the 
tolls on freeways and highways without providing additional 
services and acceptable quality. 
  Heavy vehicles, which cause much loss of life and property, 
are allowed to use the freeways solely to obtain more revenue. 
  He added: Other examples are the heavy and sudden price 
increases for tickets for passenger trains, aircraft, and 
recently for minibuses and urban buses. In the last example, how 
is it that the respected minister of roads and transportation 
and its general managers throughout the country undertook on 
their own initiative to increase fares, without the slightest 
consultation with province executive officials, especially the 
governors-general, the governors, and the district governors? 
  This was done on the pretext that the gentlemen doing the 
driving wanted this fare increase for the New Year's holidays so 
they could provide appropriate and worthy service to the 
respected travelers. To prevent protests from officials and the 
people, they announced a specific date for implementing this 
program in a set of guidelines, so that this aspect of the 
situation might be tolerable. It was completely surprising and 
regrettable, however, that after the end of the announced period 
they issued another guidelines statement saying that the rates 
announced in the previous guidelines will remain in force, 
setting off a wave of public unhappiness. They themselves are 
sitting in warm and comfortable seats, coming and going in the 
latest fancy vehicles, their women and children at ease. It 
appears that they have not thought for an instant about the 
women and children of the people, the passengers and these 
toiling, low-income, oppressed people. 
  Mr. Torkan, we in the Damavand and Firuzkuh area did not 
have 
any problem transporting passengers during the New Year's 
holidays for you to come and raise prices. Is it fair for 
travelers from Damavand taking this short trip to Tehran and 
back to pay such a fare? Is it fair for an oppressed person from 
Firuzkuh, a city in the province of Tehran, to pay the heavy 
1,600-rial official fare you announced just to take the short 
trip to Tehran and back? Perhaps it is not your concern whether 
the people have the money or not, people who must stand for 
hours lined up without shelter in the burning summer sun and in 
the unbearable winter cold to obtain transportation at this 
heavy fare. 
  In this same regard the speaker added: Mr. minister, do you 
feel the pain of these people? I sharply protest this willful 
initiative by the Ministry of Roads and Transportation, which 
has severely disturbed the people in my electoral district. I 
ask that the previous rates be announced and implemented. If 
this is not done, in accordance with my lawful duty, I will 
present a question to the minister in charge at an open Majles 
session, or I will take any other legal step within the realm of 
my responsibilities in order to pursue the matter to its 
conclusion. 
  Continuing, Rasuli-Nezhad said: It is surprising, in view of 
the fact that we are in the planting season and in the second 
month of the current year, that it is still not known on what 
date the budget for the current year will be sent to the offices 
of the governors-general and the executive organizations. This 
is especially surprising in my electoral district, where the 
planting season is limited and the cold season is long. 
  The deputy from Damavand and Firuzkuh added: The sudden 
increase in the rate for consumer electrical power has made the 
people anxious and unhappy and has caused a substantial shutdown 
at workshops and small factories. 
  He discussed manpower adjustment. He said: We must first 
think about creating employment and work, and then think about 
adjustment. 
  The speaker then discussed the numerous and repeated press 
conferences by the members of the Council of Ministers and he 
asked the president of the republic to remind them that not only 
do these appearances not solve any problems, they create 
problems and headaches for the nation and the government. 
  At the end of his speech Rasuli-Nezhad said: In view of the 
fact that a number of people live on the poverty line and are in 
need of their evening bread, the preparation of an album on the 
first round of women's games in the Islamic nations at 25 tumans 
was a completely improper thing to do, and should be pursued and 
dealt with. 
<H5>  Legislation </H5>
<H5>  Amendment to the Airline Organization Law </H5>
  The first item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles 
session was continued consideration of the report from the 
second consultation of the Roads and Transportation Commission 
concerning the Motion To Amend Articles From the Law 
Establishing the Airline Organization of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran, which was approved by the deputies. 
  Article 1: Article 5, Note 2 of the law is amended as 
follows: 
  Article 5: The National Aircraft Organization is the only 
authority authorized to sign agreements and authorizations 
between the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran and other 
nations. The right to make flights to transport persons and 
things to make use of the rights given in contracts, agreements 
and authorizations for the operation of air services between the 
government of the Islamic Republic of Iran and other nations is 
assigned to the Aircraft Company of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran. If the Aircraft Company of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
fails to announce that is ready to provide airline services 
within a maximum of six months, the National Aircraft 
Organization is authorized to give authorization to operate the 
flights to other government airline companies. 
  Note 2: Iranian airline institutions, with the exception of 
the National Airline Organization of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran, which operate under the relevant regulations and conduct 
flight operations, as well as other Iranian airline 
institutions, which may be established in the future adhering to 
the Flight Law with the necessary letter of authorization, may 
engage in passenger and freight transportation or any other type 
of commercial flight without weight restrictions with passenger 
or freight aircraft (as determined by the Supreme National 
Airline Council). The executive director of the Airline Company 
of the Islamic Republic of Iran will be appointed as a voting 
member of the Supreme National Airline Council mentioned in 
Article 6 of the Amendment to the National Airline Law. 
  Article 2: Note 2, Article 11 is amended as follows: 
  Note 2: The National Airline Organization and the government 
airline companies are included in all the activities given in 
Article 11 of the aforementioned law. 
  Article 3: Article 7 is amended as follows: 
  Article 7: As of the date of this law's enactment, the 
general representative (agence general) for the 
foreign airline institutions in Iran and likewise for aircraft 
technical services (repairs) will be the National Aircraft 
Organization of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Passenger land 
support services, the deplaning of passengers, and the unloading 
and loading of aircraft at the nation's airports for domestic 
flights, with the exception of the aforementioned company and 
the companies affiliated with the National Aircraft 
Organization, are assigned to the National Aircraft 
Organization, and the Airline Company of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran will perform these tasks in the case of foreign aircraft. 
If shortcomings and malfunctions are felt in the performance of 
these duties, the National Aircraft Organization can assign the 
tasks by prior announcement to real and legal persons and 
entities, whether government or nongovernment. With the approval 
of this law, all other conflicting laws are null and void. 
<H5>  Amendment to the International Railway Transportation and </H5>
Shipping Convention 
  Another item on the agenda was the report from the Housing 
and Urban Construction Commission concerning the Bill Amending 
Articles From the International Railway Transportation and 
Shipping Convention, of which Article 1 was approved by the 
deputies. 
  Article 1: The amended protocol dated 30 December 1990 (29 
Azar 1369) to the International Railway Transportation and 
Shipping Convention dated 9 May 1980 (19 Ordibehesht 1359) 
enacted by the Second General Assembly of the United Nations for 
international rail transportation and shipping, is approved. 
<H5>  Amendment to the Iran Communications Company Law </H5>
  The next item on the agenda was the report from the 
Administrative and Employment Affairs Commission concerning the 
Bill Amending Article 7 of the Law Establishing the Iran 
Communications Company (returned from the Guardian Council), for 
which the amendment to Article 7 was deleted in order to secure 
the approval of the Guardian Council. 
  It is worth mentioning that this amendment states that the 
Iran Communications Company may issue agreements in principle 
for the creations of specialist communications companies. 
  Rashidi, expert for the Administrative and Employment 
Affairs 
Commission, said concerning this: The Guardian Council issued 
the opinion that the creation of such organizations in the 
Communications Company entails a financial burden and that this 
violates the Constitution. After receiving this opinion, the 
commission invited the minister of post and telegraph, and he 
dispensed in some way with this proposal from the Communications 
Company. Therefore the commission voted for the deletion of this 
amendment. 
<H5>  Bill Giving Minister of Roads and Transportation Membership </H5>
on the Iran Supreme Architecture Council 
  The fifth item on the agenda was the report from the 
Administrative Affairs Commission concerning the Bill Giving the 
Minister of Roads and Transportation Membership on the Iran 
Supreme Urban Construction and Architecture Council (returned 
from the Guardian Council), and the aforementioned minister's 
membership was deleted and rejected in order to secure the 
approval of the Guardian Council. 
<H5>  Bill Forming Rural Development Homes </H5>
  The next item on the agenda was the Bill Forming Rural 
Development Homes. Mr. Rashidi, expert for the Administrative 
and Employment Affairs Commission, said concerning this: This 
bill, intended to improve the economic, social, and development 
situation in rural areas, seeks to maintain, preserve, and 
develop investment, which is made for rural people. 
  After speeches by two people opposing and supporting the 
bill, continued consideration was postponed to the next session. 
<H5>  Selection of Majles Deputies To Supervise Implementation of </H5>
the 1373 Budget Notes 
  Another item on the agenda was the selection of Majles 
deputies to supervise implementation of the notes of the 1373 
National Budget Law, as follows: 
  1 - Mr. Jalali, with 149 votes, and Mobini Dehkerdi, with 
148 
votes, will supervise distribution of credits and the procedure

votes from the commission, and Mr. Moqteda'i, with 99 votes from 
the commission, will supervise proper implementation of Note 13. 
This note pertains to the performance of missions outside the 
country by government agents, workers, and companies. 
  The selection of the rest of the deputies to supervise 
implementation of the 1373 notes was postponed to the next 
session. 
<H5>  Condemnation of the Attempted Assassination of the Mashhad </H5>
Temporary Friday Imam by 167 Deputies 
  In a a letter read at yesterday's open Majles session, 167 
deputies condemned the attempted assassination of the Mashhad 
Temporary Friday Imam. The text of the letter is as follows: 
  To His Holiness Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Mr. 'Aba'i, 
Mashhad temporary Friday Imam 
  The report of the attempted assassination of that great man 
severly affected all the forces of the Islamic revolution. You 
are one of the true children of the Islam of Mohammad (peace be 
upon him), one of the students from the school of Imam Sadeq 
(peace be upon him), a prominent figure at the seminary, and one 
of the true and long-time companions of His Holiness the Imam 
(peace be upon him) and the exalted leader. We thank God that 
through the grace of His Holiness Baqiyatollah al-A'zam (may God 
hasten his joyful advent) and special grace from His Holiness 
'Ali ibn Musa al-Reza (peace be upon him), you were spared this 
danger to continue service to Islam and the Muslims.

  [Excerpts] We begin with a meeting of the Council of 
Ministers at the presidential offices today. Mr. Liamine 
Zeroual, the head of state, chaired the meeting. In accordance 
with the agenda, at the beginning of its proceedings the council 
listened to a report by Prime Minister Mokdad Sifi on all the 
activities of his government since it was appointed. 
  In light of the report presented by the minister delegate 
for 
the budget, the Council of Ministers then studied and approved 
the Supplementary Budget Act 1994. The Supplementary Budget Act 
aims to implement austerity measures in public expenditure in 
order to reduce the total deficit in the state's finances; to 
provide additional financial resources to restructure and clean 
up public enterprises; to restructure banks; to limit the 
effects of the structural reform program on deprived social 
groups; to establish new tax measures aimed at promoting 
investment in conformity with and in transition to a market 
economy, on one hand, and at achieving economic revival so that 
national development can take off again, on the other. [passage 
omitted] 
  In his contribution to the Council of Ministers' discussion, 
the head of state insisted on the need to formulate a program 
for social protection, as well as undertaking work aimed at 
achieving economic effectiveness, because, as he explained, we 
must succeed not only on the economic level but also on the 
social level. [passage omitted] 
  In reviewing Algeria's foreign activities in the economic 
field, the head of state gave directives on the setting up of a 
joint ministerial committee to be headed by the prime minister. 
This committee will follow up the implementation of the 
agreement signed with the IMF. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Mohamed Salah Dembri by </F>
correspondent Noureddine Bouziane; place and date not given; 
from the "Afrique Midi" program --recorded] 
  [Text] [Dembri] The political dialogue in Algeria is 
progressing steadily and as expected. That is, all the 
political and social forces of the country have been consulted 
and have been associated with this effort aimed at setting up 
transitional institutions to reach a national consensus on the 
resumption of the electoral process of course, and to build the 
new Algerian society. I do not think it is appropriate to speak 
of government versus opposition. I think this concept is 
completely false. There is a state and a government that are 
trying to organize, to the best of their ability, the 
transitional period, and a political elite that has its own 
interpretations, something that is normal in a democratic 
regime. The aim is to achieve this consensus around the key 
points included in the transitional platform, which should 
guarantee the continuity of the Algerian state, the continuity 
of the republican order, the defense of individual rights and 
freedom, as well as respect for the elements constituting our 
national character and the rejection of violence as a means of 
obtaining power and keeping it. 
  The democratic process has never been interrupted in 
Algeria. 
This is in fact why we can still see parties pursuing their 
activities freely. The press is also free. We should not 
forget that not long ago in Europe, these problems of transition 
were experienced by at least two countries. In Spain, the 
Moncloa Pact had to be signed to manage the transition toward a 
multiparty system and the emergence of a republican state. In 
Portugal, it took no fewer than four transitional governments, 
if I remember correctly, to form a constitutional government. 
The issue here is the transition from a system of partisan 
democracy to a democratic multyparty system. 
  [Bouziane] Minister, how do you assess the relationship 
between Algeria and France? 
  [Dembri] Good on the whole. We are pleased at this moment to 
see that there is a great understanding of the Algerian 
situation on the part of French political circles. Some 
worst-case scenarios are entertained by some editorials of the 
French press, but on the whole, it is obvious that putting the 
problems of Algeria within the Mediterranean framework at the 
moment is, beyond the confines of any relationship, good for 
joint development. This joint development will force us to look 
at the problems of the future in terms of solutions that we 
should find together to everything that concerns the economy and 
movement of persons and property, etc. 
  [Bouziane] At the diplomatic level, Minister, we have 
recently noticed Algerian diplomatic activity particularly 
concerning Mali, with the signing of the National Pact, and 
Niger. What is the future of a settlement of the Tuareg problem 
in these two countries? 
  [Dembri] Listen, we are doing what a neighboring country 
should do: aspiring to build a prosperous community. At the two 
levels of cooperation and security, we have built a 
Sahelian-Saharan community, which we hope to see integrated and 
homogenous. 
  [Bouziane] Does this mean that Algeria will soon organize 
direct negotiations between the Niger Government and the Niger 
Tuaregs? 
  [Dembri] This does not matter. There are three mediators in 
this conflict. There is the Burkinabe mediator, the French 
mediator, and the Algerian mediator. The meetings -- and a few 
of these will be held -- should take place on a rotational basis 
in the different countries involved. A meeting has already been 
held in Ouagadougou. Our mediators recently met the two parties 
to these negotiations. A meeting is secheduled to take place in 
Paris, I suppose, on 15 June, and we will try of course to 
contribute positively, as always, because we have to guarantee 
peace, security, and development in all this Sahelian-Saharan 
region.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Mokdad Sifi by Hans-Helmut </F>
Kohl in Algiers; date not given: "Dialogue With All Those Who 
Renounce the Use of Force"] 
  [Text] The new Algerian Government is trying to get the 
political and economic crisis in the country under control with 
two recipes: On the one hand, dialogue should be sought "with 
all those who renounce the use of force." On the other hand, the 
social reason behind the conflict should be tackled with a new 
effort. In Algiers, FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU journalist 
Hans-Helmut Kohl conducted the following interview with Prime 
Minister Mokdad Sifi, who has been in office since 11 April. 
  [Kohl] People in Europe are following the developments in 
Algeria with great concern -- also as far as safety is 
concerned. Foreigners are being killed, threatened, and are 
leaving the country. What do you want to do and what can you do 
about this? 
  [Sifi] This government is observing two guidelines. First, 
we have to eliminate violence. These acts of violence must 
stop, and we are making great efforts for this. I think that 
the population and objective observers have already noticed a 
significant improvement. The struggle to eliminate violence 
will continue. On the other hand, there are political, 
economic, and social reasons for this evil in our society. 
  The intensive struggle against violence goes hand in hand 
with a policy that consists of addressing all parties and all 
sections and groups of the population. Not everything that the 
population feels is expressed by the parties. There are social 
groups such as the trade unions, employers, and cultural 
associations that are of significance by themselves. All these 
people have been invited to a dialogue so that we can find out 
together how we can return to stability. As far as the economy 
is concerned, we have revised a program for improving the 
infrastructure, even though this is only a small part of what is 
necessary. 
  [Kohl] Let us stay with politics. You have invited 
everybody to participate in the dialogue. What will you do if 
your invitation is not accepted and how far are you ready to 
take this dialogue? Does it also include the FIS, the Islamic 
Salvation Front? 
  [Sifi] We should understand one thing: The FIS has been 
dissolved by a Supreme Court ruling in accordance with the laws 
of this country. Now there are movements that support the 
social model that was also pursued by the FIS. They think that 
their idea is the best. These people may come, but all others 
who renounce violence may come, too. 
  [Kohl] Are there any contacts between the government or the 
state president and the arrested FIS leaders Madani and Benhadj? 
  [Sifi] The state president has made mediating efforts. 
Everything has taken place on the basis of the platform that was 
worked out in the High State Council with the participation of 
many people. There were others who were not included. The 
conference emphasized that the path was open for everybody else, 
too. It laid down the framework and the objective. The 
framework includes all those who renounce violence and respect 
the Constitution. Our objective is to achieve economic and 
political stability as a precondition for elections. We want to 
achieve this as quickly as possible. The platform agreed on a 
period of three years. Should stability be achieved before 
that, nothing will prevent us from holding the elections earlier. 
  [Kohl] Will these elections then no longer be held under the 
majority voting system but under the proportional representation 
system, because the majority voting system benefited the FIS? 
  [Sifi] That is the problem. The direction that we are going 
will depend on the dialogue. The electoral law is part of it. 
  [Kohl] Are you going to give a precise date for the 
elections? 
  [Sifi] Perhaps not everybody is content. We will see who 
will not come. The train will go on. We have to give those who 
have not yet boarded the train time to reflect. For this 
purpose we have established the National Transition Council 
(CNT), which will constitute itself soon. Recently we 
instituted the National Economic and Social Council (CNES). All 
the issues can be discussed in the CNES and the CNT. 
  [Kohl] Are you playing to stay in power for awhile? 
  [Sifi] I will go even further. What other solution can you 
offer, what alternative, what is to be done? If you know 
something better, why not, even though in my opinion there is 
nothing better way than to assemble the people so that we do not 
lose even more time. 
  [Kohl] Still, there are groups who will not participate. 
  [Sifi] Then things will be done without them. These 
organizations are important, but people are more important. The 
people want peace. 
  [Kohl] You have offered dialogue with a time limit? 
  [Sifi] Of course there are limits. 
  [Kohl] The accusation has been voiced in Algeria, for 
example in the newspapers, that Germany was supporting 
fundamentalists, who were not only granted asylum but are even 
allowed to demand murders. How do you see the position of the 
German authorities? 
  [Sifi] Germany is a sovereign country. It has the right to 
do whatever it wants. People in Germany are worried about what 
is going on in Algeria. We would like to give the German 
authorities and the German public the possibility to have direct 
access to our country so that they do not have to rely on 
information provided by international media or all kinds of 
experts on Algeria. I think that we can trust that the Germans 
will finally find out the truth about our country. Germany and 
Algeria have shared interests. Personally, I am convinced that 
the Germans will change their opinion not only when they become 
more open toward the Algerian Government but when they come here 
to see for themselves. Still, I have the impression that German 
public opinion does not yet have a true assessment of the 
situation here. I can feel that in your questions, too. 
Dialogue, particularly in the way it is understood in Germany, 
is not dialogue between the government, on the one hand, and a 
party, on the other. 
  [Kohl] Yet, this is what it is seen as -- as dialogue 
between the government and the FIS. 
  [Sifi] No. The government does not back one party or turn 
against another. We do not have any preferences. 
  [Kohl] In your view do political statements in Germany 
disturb this process? 
  [Sifi] Exactly. They have prevented Algeria overcoming the 
crisis. 
  [Kohl] So do you think that Germany should behave 
differently? 
  [Sifi] Yes, absolutely. If the German public were better 
informed of the true intentions of the Algerian Government, they 
would be convinced of our path and would be more accommodating. 
  [Kohl] Let us now turn to the economy: Does your government 
accept the crucial term privatization? What industries will be 
privatized, when and under what conditions? 
  [Sifi] Here, as in politics, your approach seems to biased. 
You never see the whole but only one aspect, which can be a 
conclusion but sometimes also the driving force for a certain 
development. [sentence as published] Privatization as a simple 
term, a slogan, is of no value for us. What we are interested 
in is the efficiency of our economy. If the state has to 
withdraw from one sphere or another -- I prefer this formulation 
-- why not? In Germany there are also public employers. Why do 
you not privatize these? 
  [Kohl] We are just about to privatize our airline. 
  [Sifi] Very well. Ask the British, and they will tell you 
that the Germans are not privatizing enough, and they will add 
that the French are lagging even further behind. Everything is 
relative. I am not telling the Germans, French, and British 
anything. They all have their national economies, and everybody 
is trying to be as efficient as possible. When we became 
independent we had nothing -- nothing in the private or public 
sector. So, something had to be done, and since there was no 
private economy, the state had to take things into its hands. 
This was necessary. It turned out that the state was unable to 
handle everything. So autonomy has to be created in ever more 
sectors. We have started, and we will continue. 
  [Kohl] Give me an example. 
  [Sifi] Well, take the tourist industry. The state is not 
going to invest in any new developments. We are not doing 
anything at all in this sector any more. And what we must and 
will do is to open up to private national and foreign capital. 
Where we need technological partnership we are ready to open 
up. I am thinking of cement plants, which need foreign partners. 
  [Kohl] What about the petrochemical industry? 
  [Sifi] Do not rush us. We have not analyzed it in detail. 
It is not enough to proclaim the slogan and let nothing follow. 
We must be able to evaluate all the possibilities. We must not 
begin with the simplest things but with what is possible. Time 
will come. Now we are not thinking of privatizing the 
petrochemical industry, which does not mean that we will not do 
so in 10, 15, or 100 years from now -- I do not know. What I do 
know is that we are anxious to optimize our economic activities. 
  [Kohl] To attract foreign capital you have to guarantee 
profits. 
  [Sifi] That is obvious. We can attract foreign capital in 
all the sectors if there are shared interests. Yet, without 
assessing the possibilities I cannot say that I will simply do 
it in one or the other industry. That is not the appropriate 
thing for a head of government to do. There have to be vital 
Algerian interests for any opening up. 
  [Kohl] Your recent agreement with the IMF will make the 
problems even worse. Do you think that you will be able to 
explain this policy to your population? And do you have enough 
time for it? 
  [Sifi] So far, the people have lost confidence in the 
government because they were promised a lot. We have explained 
the consequences of the agreement, both the negative and the 
positive. We have drawn up a program to prevent the shock 
therapy that we can witness elsewhere. We will improve the 
social network and make sure that the distribution of and access 
to goods will improve. At the moment, there is a huge gap 
between the real and the official prices. If we increase the 
official prices by 50 percent and, at the same time, improve the 
distribution of and access to the goods, then we would still 
remain beneath the current real prices. 
  [Kohl] How will you solve the housing shortage? 
  [Sifi] At the moment we are short of 1.2 million apartments, 
based on the statistical assumption of seven people per 
apartment. If we wanted five people to share each apartment, we 
would need 2 million apartments. This is where we did a bad job 
in the past. Now we are trying hard to complete 600,000 
unfinished apartments. This will change the concrete living 
conditions, which will become noticeable in all the cities. 
Moreover, we will permit all Algerians to buy a piece of land, 
which was impossible in the past. And the administrative bodies 
must change their way of working. They used to take decisions 
but there was nobody there to implement them. 
  [Kohl] As a result of the attacks is it difficult for you to 
keep people who work for the state because they are the targets 
of such attacks? 
  [Sifi] Quite a few have left, but most of them have stayed 
on. One thing is certain, namely that we can do a much better 
job with the same means. 
  [Kohl] Do you not interpret it as criticism that people 
describe you as a technocrat? 
  [Sifi] On the contrary, I am proud of it. I say it is 
better to be a good technocrat than a bad politician.

  [Text] The minister of finance's tour, which has taken him 
to a number of Western capitals, seems to have made some 
progress towards gaining more financial support for the 
country's plan for economic revival. 
  After Washington, Mr. Benbitour is expected to arrive in 
Tokyo later to meet with Japanese financial circles. Here are 
more details with Bachir Hedibek: 
  [Hedibek] Finance Minister Ahmed Benbitour yesterday ended 
his tour which had taken him to Washington, after visiting Paris 
and Brussels. During his visit, the Algerian minister of 
finance met the U.S. deputy secretary of the treasury in charge 
of finance, the president of the world bank, and the IMF general 
secretary. 
  Mr. Benbitour affirmed from Washington that he had received 
Western financial circles' full support for the government's 
program for economic revival and that they were fully prepared 
to give all the necessary aid to secure the success of the 
program, particularly the flexibility of debt rescheduling and 
the release of new loans. 
  Concerning the debt rescheduling, Mr. Benbitour pointed out 
that the aim was that Algeria should receive a percentage of 
loans to build an acceptable level of money reserves in order to 
avoid a fresh request for debt rescheduling in the future. 
Algerian demands received great understanding and support from 
American financial circles, he added. 
  Mr. Benbitour pointed out that furthermore, he had dwellled 
upon the program of loans for supporting the Algerian 
institutions and the Algerian monetary and banking system, 
estimated at 175 million dollars from the World Bank and 150 
million dollars for the Export- Import Bank of Japan, with the 
director of the World Bank. 
  The minister had guarantees that the abovementioned loans 
would be released as soon as possible and that a new plan with 
the World Bank would be drawn up. 
  His meeting with IMF director general Mr. Camdessus was an 
opportunity to deal with the development of the situation 
following the dispatch of Algeria's letter of intent to the Fund. 
  The Algerian file, including the program for economic 
revival 
will be the subject of a serious examination by the IMF board, 
which is due to meet on 27 May. 
  Also, the Paris Club will be holding a meeting later this 
month to examine the rescheduling of Algeria's foreign debts. 
  Always in Paris, the French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe has 
also disclosed that Washington and Tokyo had agreed to 
reschedule Algeria's debts.

  [Text] Within the framework of his visit to Paris, 
Brussels, and Washington which had the aim of explaining 
Algeria's economic and financial programs to officials in these 
states [as heard], Minister of Finance Ahmed Benbitour yesterday 
ended his talks in London with British officials after a two-day 
visit to Britain. 
  In a statement to the Algerian news agency after his visit 
to 
London, he said that he had found great understanding and an 
excellent appreciation of the economic and financial situation 
in Algeria among those he spoke to in Britain. Abdelhamid 
Boughra has the details. 
  [Boughra] Mr. Benbitour said that his visit to the British 
capital had had four aims. He stressed that he had gone to 
London to obtain support for the Algerian government's program 
when it is discussed by the IMF board of directors on 27 May. 
He also said that he had asked for Britain to support the 
Algerian case at the Paris Club within the framework of the 
rescheduling of Algeria's debts on 31 May and 1 June. Mr. 
Benbitour said that the third aim was to obtain British support 
in multilateral financial institutions, while the fourth was his 
discussions with British officials on ways and means of 
developing bilateral financial relations and trade exchanges. 
  His talks with British officials centered on the situation 
in 
Algeria and the challenges which getting out of the crisis pose 
for the region and Europe. The minister indicated that the 
British have promised to provide support in multilateral 
financial institutions and to study the possibility of 
developing technical assistance and encouraging trade exchanges. 
Mr. Benbitour said that his talks with the British energy 
minister dealt with the possibility of cooperation between 
Sonatrach and British Petroleum.

<F P=106> ["Text" of statement by the General People's Committee for </F>
Unity; place and date not given] 
  [Text] The realization of unity by fraternal Yemen and its 
return to its original status as an united country had great 
effects on all the sons of the Arab nation as an important event 
in the modern history of the Arabs. This was emphasized by 
Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, the leader of the great al-Fatih 
revolution, as soon as Yemeni unity was announced. He was aware 
of the importance of the achievement and of the dangers which 
threatened it from imperialist and reactionary forces, lying in 
wait for the Arab nation. 
  The Great Jamahiriyah's General People's Committee for 
Unity, 
proceeding from the sacrosanct unionist ideals of the great 
al-Fatih revolution and in consecration of the unionist longing 
of the Libyan Arab people, announced in the document proclaiming 
the people's authority, to continue the struggle until 
comprehensive Arab unity is achieved and, in response to the 
leading role of the leader of the great al-Fatih revolution and 
his continuous drive to achieve Yemeni unity, reaffirms the need 
for efforts to be exerted to stop the bloodletting and for 
recourse to be had to wisdom and dialogue. Based upon unionist 
legality and the pledge and concord document, efforts should be 
made to save Yemeni unity, which should be valued as a pan-Arab 
achievement that must not be abandoned. 
  The General People's Committee for Unity, proceeding from 
its 
pan-Arab commitments and in implementation of the basic people's 
congresses' resolutions, reaffirms the following: 
  1. Efforts should be exerted to preserve the unity of Yemen, 
which was the product of the will of the Arab people in Yemen, 
as a historic achievement of the Arab nation's modern era. 
  2. The unity of Yemen and its historical borders should be 
preserved as an inalienable geographical and historical unit, 
which is an integral part of the pan-Arab entity. 
  3. An appeal should be made for an end to the fighting and 
the resumption by brothers, in both Aden and Sanaa, of dialogue, 
leading to an understanding based upon the terms of the 
constitution of the unified state and the pledge and concord 
document. All unionist people in fraternal Yemen shoud be urged 
to work for such an aim in order to prevent imperialist and 
reactionary forces -- the enemies of the Arab nation -- from 
making capital out of this situation. 
  The General People's Committee for Unity, while urging the 
above, calls upon all the sons of the Arab nation to exert 
efforts in order to allow united Yemen to remain in its true 
position in the movement of comprehensive confrontation, which 
is being waged by the masses of the Arab nation against 
imperialist schemes aimed at destroying the Arab nation, 
plundering its resources, and undermining its sovereignty.

<F P=106> [Speech by Libyan leader Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi to </F>
the chairman and secretaries of the Jamahiriyah cleanup 
committees on 18 May; place not given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] As I have already told you the Cleanup Bill is a 
very important law. Its importance lies not only in the fact 
that it is a deterrence which will bring about justice and 
prevent any deviation and corruption. Its real importance lies 
in the fact that it is an affirmation of the democratic system, 
the people's authority, and a real application of the jamahiri 
theory. It will also help the society to correct itself if and 
when it deviates. If the political power is a dictatorship, 
like most political systems in today's world, society's fight 
against deviation and its will to correct itself can only be 
expressed through violence, that is, a revolution against the 
political system. [passage omitted] 
  And here lies the importance of the Cleanup Bill: Now the 
Libyan people can, when it feels that there is a deviation or 
even a corruption, meet at the basic people's congresses and 
issue the necessary legislation which will eliminate any 
deviation and correct any direction. 
  We should meet democratically and calmly at our basic 
people's committees in a comfortable manner and issue the 
necessary laws and decisions which will correct any deviation, 
regardless of its seriousness. And that is what has actually 
taken place: The Libyan people felt that there have been 
deviations by individuals, which could be far reaching, and 
decided that such a matter warranted the intervention of the 
people's authority to carry out a correction. The Libyan people 
passed, through the people's congresses, the Cleanup Bill, which 
has given rise to the cleanup committees. 
  As far as I am concerned I think that such a step was a 
historical and a very important one in the application of the 
theory. Without democracy and without the law we will be at the 
mercy of adventures; democracy will be jeopardized and all our 
gains will be threatened by undemocratic and illegal initiatives 
by some selfish individuals which will lead to further serious 
deviations. 
  Therefore, to protect freedom and gains, the democratic 
project must be a legal one. It is only a democratic one if it 
is based on the people's authority. The law must be issued by a 
people's authority. And this is what actually has taken place. 
  The Cleanup Bill is an opportune law. It is here because 
every citizen has felt the need to enact such a bill. 
  It is for the first time that a bill has stipulated that 
public property is sacred, protected, and safe, and that no-one 
should harm it or exploit it illegally. This new legal doctrine 
did not exist before; only private property used to sacred. The 
latter was, however, a right concept which has been abused. 
[passage omitted] 
  Public property, the property of the whole people, was not 
sacred until this moment... [pauses] ... until this bill is 
enacted. No one used to talk about public property. Public 
property used to be ownerless, a matter which opened the doors 
for theft and the appetite of thieves. 
  Now the Libyan people can dot the i's and cross the t's by 
meeting at the people's congresses and enacting this law with 
its free will and stating that public property is sacred and 
protected. It must not be exploited and should only be used in 
accordance with the stipulations of the law. This used to be 
said about private property which used to belong to 
entrepreneurs, profit takers, usury takers, and greedy people. 
  Once the Cleanup Bill is enacted, everyone should thereafter 
bear in mind that public property, which belongs to the whole 
people, is sacred. Anyone who harms it should have his hand 
amputated in accordance with the law because he is a thief. 
[passage omitted containing indistinct portion] 
  If there is one thing that the Libyan people have done which 
confirms the authority of the people, preserves achievements, 
supports freedom, and bars the way to any conspiracies and 
deviations, it is the Cleanup Bill. This is a democratic 
achievement. 
  Of course this law considers illegal gain to be theft and 
theft means cutting off the hand. Hands will indeed be cut off 
after this law is implemented. As they used to say, those who 
lived in the town before you, if someone weak committed theft, 
they would apply the hadd punishment [loss of hand] to him. 
  But if a nobleman committed theft, they would let him go. 
No. Those whose hands will be cut off will be noblemen and 
those who are not noblemen. All people are alike whether noble 
or not. Establish your building on justice so that the building 
does not fall down on you. No-one should think that he is above 
the law which prescribes the amputation of the hand. Any 
citizen of the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriyah will 
be affected by this law. [passage omitted] 
  Of course this law is a very serious law. It reaffirms the 
true people's authority. It also reaffirms that corrections are 
being made in accordance with the laws in force. It is a very 
serious one, however, because it encompasses everything [words 
indistinct] and applies to everyone. [passage omitted] 
  This law is double-edged: if you register the things you 
have 
stolen you will be brought to account, and if you do not 
register them you will be brought to account twice, a double 
theft: First, you stole and second you hid what you stole, and 
this is considered as second theft. [passage omitted] 
  Had it not been for this bill there would have been a 
revolution against a revolution. However, thanks to this bill 
and to the Libyan people's free will there is a revolution 
inside a revolution. 
  Because the matter is so serious, we are trying to give 
some respite to the Libyans, who did not expect this law to be 
enacted, did not think that anyone would make them accountable, 
and did not think that their hands would be cut off one day. 
[words indistinct]. I would like to say here that before we 
[word indistinct] and we start cutting off the hands of those 
thieves, who have been fiddling with public property, we should 
try to give them a warning. God says no one should be punished 
before a warning has been sent to him. We are giving them a 
good respite which is also a warning that hands will actually be 
cut off. 
  This warning and good omen I am giving will last for the 
period of launching the cleanup committees and announcing its 
officials. This time we will alert people but after that the 
cleanup bill and the cleanup committees will be in force 
constantly. There will be no warning, what is permitted is 
clear and what is prohibited is clear. [passage omitted] 
  Whoever takes the initiative and registers anything he has 
hidden will not be subjected to [words indistinct] by the 
cleanup committees. So if someone takes the initiative and 
immediately registers everything he possesses, he can be assured 
and should not fear anything. Some people might tell you, now 
that you have registered your possessions you will have to talk 
to Mu'ammar al- Qadhdhafi later. Do not worry, go on and 
register, say indeed I have three farms of which only one is 
registered and I want to register all of them. When you 
register the three of them and you are questioned afterwards by 
the cleanup committees and the people's court on the way and in 
which you had acquired the three farms, there will be two 
possibilities. Either you acquired them in a legitimate in 
which case they will remain yours, or if you acquired them in an 
illegal way, then the farms will be taken from you without your 
hand being amputated provided your are abiding by the [words 
indistinct]. [passage omitted] 
  If they discover goods with you which you have not declared, 
then you will be considered as a thief and your hand will be cut 
off. You will lose the goods and your hand will be cut off as 
well. But if you go straightaway, declare your goods, say that 
you have hidden things, a hidden factory, farm or home, or 
hidden money or animals and you say: I want to register them now 
and ask me how I got them. In this case, even if you had 
acquired things in an illegitimate manner, your hand will not be 
cut off, and I am responsible for this. They will bring you to 
account, and perhaps they will recover the goods from you 
without hand cutting. This is if you take the initiative of 
declaring everything you own. This is number one, and let he 
who listens tell whoever is not listening. He who takes the 
initiative of paying the due excise duties and taxes which he 
was avoiding will not be asked questions and will be cleared of 
accusation. [passage omitted] 
  All the Libyans who know [words indistinct] lazy, [word 
indistinct], making evasive tactics. As of today, he will 
considered as [word indistinct] of a revolution, so as to be 
able to escape from the accusation of theft and [words 
indistinct]. This is number two. Number three concerns 
applicants for a licence [to trade]. Anyone engaged in any 
activity without a license, and [word indistinct] the cleanup 
committees, is regarded as a thief because he engages in an 
activity which brings him an income, but he does not pay excise 
duty or tax, and anyone not paying excise duties and taxes is 
considered as a thief and the retribution is the severing of a 
hand. This includes those selling in the streets and [words 
indistinct], let alone other actitivities. Those called 
suitcase traders or middlemen need a license. What I am saying 
is this: Anyone engaged in an activity which he deems useful, 
including charlatans who claim to make amulets to cure people 
from being possessed by the devil, should have a licence for 
which he pays tax. [passage omitted] 
  Anyone who is engaged in a trade at home or in the street 
without a license, anyone transporting goods likely to be bought 
or sold on a vehicle, any economic activity, small or big, 
without a licence will lead to those engaged in them being 
considered as thieves, in accordance with the law [words 
indistinct], and his hand will be cut off. To be saved from the 
severing of his hand he should from today obtain a license. 
[passage omitted] 
  In the end, whoever takes the initiative and confesses to 
carrying out an activity forbidden by the cleanup law, do we 
forgive him or not? [passage omitted] 
  If they confess before the cleanup committees reach them, we 
will pardon all the people who are currently selling dollars and 
dinars in the black market. [passage omitted] 
  But if someone continues to deal in the black market, or in 
smuggling or things which we do not currently know about -- but 
he knows them -- but if we find them, it will be considered a 
case of theft and his hand will be amputated. [passage omitted] 
  Someone might come and say: Before you arrest me and 
amputate 
my hand, you should know that I have been doing this job [words 
indistinct]. This will then be a [word indistinct] confession, 
he will be considered a wise, responsible man who repented; this 
repentance will [word indistinct] what preceded it and as a 
consequence this person will not be questioned by the cleanup 
committees. Apart from this case, this law is like a sword. 
[passage omitted] 
  The secretary of the General People's Committee for Justice 
says it will be preferable to allow a deadline sufficient to 
give people the chance to repent, t6o give back their ill-gotten 
possessions and settle their situations. [Addressing officials 
at the meeting] So, issue an announcement and allow the deadline 
you consider to be reasonable and sufficient. Very good and all 
the best of success.

  [Text] Tripoli, Al Maa [May] 21, JAMAHIRIYAH NEWS AGENCY -- 
The leader of the revolution sent the following letter to the 
African militant Nelson Mandela, the laureat of al-Qadhdhafi 
international prize for human rights, on the occasion of the 
victory of the people of South Africa: 
  "To His Excellency Nelson Mandela, the president of the 
Republic of South Africa, greetings, words are unable to express 
this historic victory of a people who fought injustice, 
falsification, tyranny, murder, torture, humiliation and disdain 
for 300 years. But this people did not capitulate or recognize 
under torture that the land of blacks belonged to whites paying 
for that with blood and tears which resulted at the end in the 
declaration of freedom and independence of the people of South 
Africa. On this historic occasion, we must stand solemnly in 
tribute and respect for the martyrs of Soweto, martyr Steve Biko 
and Mahatma Ghandi whose name was linked to the cause of the 
South African people. Also revolutionaries everywhere and all 
peoples confronting [word indistinct] colonialism respectfully 
salute hero Nelson Mandela, the [words indistinct] immensely 
patient man. The struggle and victory of our people in south of 
black Africa draws the historic way for the struggle and 
expected victory for our people in usurped Palestine. Nothing 
muddled the clear skies of South Africa lit with candles of the 
bodies of the victims of racism and lamps run with the blood 
spilled for freedom and cleaned with the tears of millions who 
were tortured for the sake of their right to live in their 
homeland except the presence of the racist terrorist Zionist 
delegation which befouled purified South Africa. It seems that 
the Zionists were so guilt ridden that they allowed themselves 
to attend the delight of people during their celebration of 
victory over international racism. Did the Zionist forget their 
unholy alliance with the Pretoria regime and their support for 
it against you "and the exchange of expertise in torture and 
racism?". Weren't the Israelis the natural ally of the racist 
regime of South Africa. Didn't the Israelis take part with 
whites in tens of years of genocide and torture against blacks. 
Glory for you personally and your great people and martyrs 
[word indistinct] on the collapsing Zionist racism and white 
racism. Yours brotherly, Mu'ammar al- Qadhdhafi [no closing 
quotation mark as received].

  [Text] The Arabic service of the BBC, which is subordinate 
to the British intelligence MI6, broadcast what it called a live 
coverage of confrontations which took place in Cairo between the 
security forces and the lawyers' bar association. It also 
broadcast hostile statements against the Egyptian Government. 
  JANA Arab affairs editor commented on this flagrant 
intervention in Egypt's internal affairs and said: Through its 
Arabic-speaking service, which is subordinate to the English 
intelligence MI6, England continues the vilification campaign on 
the Arab countries seizing any opportunity and exploiting any 
internal incident to give vent to its anger and grudge on the 
Arab regimes. 
  The editor expressed extreme astonishment at the Arab 
governments' silence over this continued audacity exercised by 
the English radio and other Western racist media which makes 
daily subject-matter of the news, commentaries, and analyses 
which harm the ruling Arab regimes. 
  It seems that the BBC is reassured of the non-existence of a 
deterrent in the shadow of the Western governments' 
encouragement and the silence of the Arab regimes, while the 
situation changes completely when a news item is reported by 
Arab mass media. 
  The editor concluded his comment by saying that the logic of 
things would be that we, the Arabs, accept what is being issued 
by us against one another as being an internal Arab affair, and 
entirely refuse the West's intervention and allegations.

  [Text] Here are some Palestinian reactions to Rabin's 
demand that Yasir 'Arafat reaffirm in writing his commitment to 
the peace process. 
  Palestinian Council Member Furayh Abu-Middayn says that 
crises were expected to crop up in the course of the 
negotiations, but if Israel seeks to limit the autonomy to the 
Gaza boundaries, it should say so candidly, rather than continue 
to come up with new pretexts. 
  Sa'ib 'Urayqat said the real danger to the peace process 
does 
not lie in Yasir 'Arafat's remarks, but rather in Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin's actions. 
  Jamil al-Tarifi, head of the Supreme Civilian Coordination 
Committee, told Qol Yisra'el correspondent Mark Weiss that 
Israel has posed preconditions for the resumption of 
negotiations that the PLO repudiates.

<F P=106> [Report by Roni Shaqed] </F>
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Yesterday, without any 
secrecy, the establishment of the Palestinian Preventive 
Security Service [PPSS] was officially announced. Jibril 
al-Rujub, head of the PPSS in the West bank, announced: "Today, 
we officially started functioning as a security service." Later 
he added that this was only the official announcement. "In 
fact," he said, "we have been operating for several months." 
[passage omitted] 
  Al-Rujub made another, quite official statement: "The PPSS 
was established to provide for the security of Palestinian 
civilians and to defend their freedom." 
  Explaining the PPSS policy, he stressed: "There will be no 
cooperation between the Palestinian intelligence services and 
the Israeli security services. We signed the Gaza and Jericho 
agreement, which speaks of security coordination, and there will 
be coordination." [passage omitted] 
  The second principle guiding the PPSS, according to 
al-Rujub, 
will be to safeguard democracy: "We will disqualify no 
democratic struggle and will not rule out any opposition that 
operates democratically. It is every man's right to express his 
opinion, but we will allow no one to impose his stands and will 
on anybody else. If, for example, some body or group should call 
for a strike, they are free to do so. If, however, they use 
terror to impose a strike, we will not let them do so." 
  The third principle governing the PPSS is the territorial 
scope of its operations throughout the territories, "including 
East Jerusalem, because it is occupied territory." 
  Al-Rujub further said that the first goal of the PPSS will 
be 
to settle accounts with Palestinian collaborators. His remarks 
on this issue sounded a bit apologetic: "Unlike other nations 
under occupation, the phenomenon of collaborators here was not 
that terrible. It is a dangerous matter, and we must deal with 
it." Al-Rujub promised that they will deal with the matter 
while examining each case on an individual basis. "We will 
treat each person in accordance with the gravity of his crime. 
As of today, we will not allow collaborators among us," he 
said. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Mikhal Sela'] </F>
  [Text] The Palestinian center at East Jerusalem's Orient 
House will remain the center of all political and diplomatic 
activities. As has been the custom to date, all diplomatic and 
political meetings with official Palestinian figures will 
continue being arranged through the responsible Orient House 
figures. This arrangement is not an organizational procedure 
but rather a measure designed to emphasize Jerusalem's place in 
the Palestinians' political doctrine and to reiterate the need 
to discuss the status of Jerusalem in due time. 
  Remarks in this spirit were made yesterday by Faysal 
al-Husayni at a special meeting with Jerusalem-based foreign 
consuls held at Orient House. 
  Al-Husayni told the consuls who attended the meeting that 
according to the Palestinian procedures, all of their activities 
or those of official envoys from their countries will be 
arranged through the Palestinian center in East Jerusalem. 
Formal contacts will be always held in Jerusalem. Visits to 
the self-rule territory will be coordinated through and with the 
Jerusalem office. 
  DAVAR has been informed by al-Husayni's office that the 
consuls voiced their approval of the arrangement.

<F P=106> [Article by Tzvi Gilat: "Here and There in the Land of </F>
Autonomy"] 
  [Text] Sufyan Abu-Zayidah and Hisham 'Abd-al-Razzaq were 
invited to a symposium at a Tel Aviv theater earlier this week. 
'Amira Hess, an HA'ARETZ reporter who was also slated to 
participate in the symposium, proposed to meet them in Tel Aviv 
before the event. The problem was that Abu-Zayidah and 
'Abd-al-Razzaq, with approximately 30 years in prison between 
them, do not visit Tel Aviv very often. Where should they meet? 
"You decide," they said. "No, you two decide," Hess replied. 
There is one place in Tel Aviv every Gazan knows. That is 
where they go to collect bodies; where taxi drivers take them to 
introduce them to foremen of construction sites; where the 
authorities throw them when they are caught without a permit to 
stay in Israel. "Let's meet at Abu-Kabir [site of a forensic 
institute and a lockup facility]," the two men proposed. 
  At the very same time, thousands of Gaza Strip residents 
were 
anxiously waiting along the roads leading to the Rafah border 
checkpoint for the first contingents of the Palestinian police. 
Abu-Zayidah and 'Abd-al-Razzaq did not have to work hard to 
convince their Tel Aviv audience of the need for a strong police 
force. A few minutes after they began taking questions from the 
audience, five youths who had up to that moment taken cover 
behind "Peace Now" T-shirts and "There Is A Mandate for Peace" 
stickers, leapt up and shouted: Sufyan, go back to Gaza, you 
murderer. A scuffle ensued and the police were summoned to see 
the rioters out. An Israeli police officer, who looked 
exhausted, had to stay until the end of the symposium to make 
sure that the two Palestinian leaders would be permitted to 
speak without interruption. 
  "I understand you," Abu-Zayidah bitterly told the right-wing 
rioters. "It is hard for you. A lot of Palestinians also find 
this peace hard to swallow. Even though there is peace, your 
soldiers still shoot us every day in Gaza and Dayr al-Balah. 
So, some people find it hard. But, it will not help them, just 
as it will not avail you. There will be peace." 
  The Gaza Strip is changing from day to day, sprucing up, 
erasing the soot, dust, and agony of the occupation. It is 
still not the ideal place to live, but its quality is improving. 
People are thinking about tomorrow, not just about today, and 
this is having an effect. 
  In recent weeks, thick ropes have been stretched on the 
roads 
in the streets of Jabalyah. This is the local version of road 
humps to force drivers to slow down. As is known, it has been a 
long time since Gaza has observed any traffic rules. There, a 
child opens his front door and he is already in the middle of 
the road. There have been cases when a child ran after a friend 
and found himself run over by a car. So, they are stretching 
ropes. 
  Construction work can be seen in every corner. Housing 
projects are being built. Carpet dealer Hamis al-Halawi, not a 
well-liked man in Gaza -- he owns a four-story clothing and 
carpet store -- covered the whole building with a huge Palestine 
flag, just as the Habima Theater in Tel Aviv was once covered 
with the Israeli flag. 
  'Abd-al-Qadr al-Husayni Street in the Rimal neighborhood 
already looks like a government ministry compound: offices of 
the Engineers Association, the Development Society, the Family 
Planning Society, the Trade Union Federation. "Did Hayim Ramon 
win? We will have to meet him. So far we have discussed 
workers' rights with Haberfeld." 
  New huts for bathers are being built on the seashore. Until 
the intifadah, Gazans used to go to the beach in Ashqelon. Since 
the intifadah the seashore is associated with the "Seashore 
Outpost" and the "Ansar-2 camp," two notorious sites on the 
waterfront. Swimming was no fun then. Things are different now. 
  Peddlers expose their wares in the middle of the street. 
Many Gazans feel the goods, with a view to renovating their 
homes. New graffiti has been sprayed on the wall outside Dr. 
Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi's home: "We Will Build Our State With Our 
Own Two Hands," and "Palestine Opens Its Arms to the Arriving 
Policemen." Now the graffiti is aesthetic, pretty, and 
colorful. They can stand in front of the wall with their spray 
cans and paint uninterruptedly, not like it used to be. 
  Thousands of people still subsist on flour and water. A 
demonstration was staged last week in front of the UNRWA [UN 
Relief and Works Agency] offices demanding an increase in the 
rations. Local doctors are worried about the growing incidence 
of malnutrition which weakens the body's immune system, 
particularly in children. All these are attendant consequences 
of the prolonged closure. Gaza is awash in cheap Israeli canned 
food. The reason: its expiry date is long overdue. However, 
when people are hungry they eat cans of corn that should not be 
used after November 1993. Most cans are marked "kosher for 
Pesah." 
  On empty stomachs, children, women, and the elderly stand 
for 
three days along the roads awaiting the arrival of the 
Palestinian police. They want to see with their eyes and touch 
with their hands the Palestinian weapons. Against this 
backdrop, clashes erupt between them and the soldiers guarding 
the roads. These are truly the hardest hours of the end. The 
soldiers also stand in the blazing sun for hours, they are also 
thirsty, and they also want to see how all this ends. So, the 
joy of getting out is accompanied by the music of rubber 
bullets, the smell of tear gas, and a bitterness which will turn 
into sweeping elation as soon as the first Blazer van donated by 
the Americans arrives. 
  The Car Licensing Bureau is crowded. Ten meters away, in the 
police station, some 20 Israeli policemen are locked behind the 
fences, waiting for the transfer of powers. But, in the Car 
Licensing Bureau it is business as usual. Earlier in the week 
there was a clash with soldiers. To settle the dispute, 
Palestinian policemen were summoned. Their uniforms are blue, 
exactly as those of the Israelis, but without a flak jacket; 
they do not yet bear arms, only a tag with the word "police" in 
Arabic on their sleeves. In the meantime, this will do as a 
source of authority. 
  What will happen in the future in the Car Licensing Bureau? 
"Nothing," says a local driver waiting to renew his driving 
license. "All the testers are Palestinian, our own men. 
Therefore, all the hustlers will go on with their business. 
For 100 shekels they will make your car pass its annual test, 
even if you don't own a car. Just like in your bureau, in Holon." 
  Until the previous closure, Nabil worked in Israel as "a 
professional meat griller." He had no permit to enter Israel 
because of trouble with the income tax authorities. He used to 
own a sewing workshop in Gaza. The income tax authorities asked 
him to pay 60,000 shekels, but they failed to reach an agreement. 
  He managed. He registered the property in his mother's 
name, and the owner of the grilled meat joint snuck him into 
Israel without a magnetic card. After the closure this became 
more dangerous. So, he bought himself an old Peugeot and went 
into partnership with another guy in a taxi company. The 
current media interest in Gaza earns him a good living, and his 
business is flourishing. There are local Gazans who would 
rather hire a taxi than drag all the way to Palestine Square. 
  He dreams that once the Israeli authorities get out perhaps 
he will finally be allowed to install a radio in his taxi, just 
like in Israel. So far this has been forbidden for security 
reasons. Your income tax authorities will tear you to pieces, I 
say to him. Nabil is not worried. He is confident they will 
reach an agreement. I am even prepared to pay 5,000 shekels and 
close the case, he says. 
  Last Tuesday he was worried about what would happen the next 
day if Israel Electric Corporation made good on its threat to 
cut off power due to Gaza's outstanding debt. Our neighborhood 
had no electricity for almost a month. No problem. Now that 
there is no curfew, we can unplug the refrigerator and buy fresh 
produce every day. The problem is with the television. We 
cannot go through the day without the news. He will apparently 
use the battery in his car. 
  A Bedouin family in Rimal is busy building a fence around 
their house. They ran away from Beersheba in 1948. Some of 
their relatives still live in Tel Sheva'. In Rimal they are a 
clan of several dozen. Now they are worried. Land in Rimal is 
expensive, and the Palestinian authorities may now demand they 
evacuate the area because they built on "state land." The best 
is to hoard weapons and be ready for what lies in store. 
  "We are from Bet Dagan. My grandfather had a large orange 
orchard there, which still exists. When I was 12, our entire 
family in Gaza went on a trip to Israel. We also went to my 
grandfather's orchard in Bet Dagan. To this day, my mother 
talks about that orchard. When they escaped to Gaza in 1948 
they had a lot of money. My mother told my father: Let's buy a 
plot of land here, let's build a home. But my father told her: 
What for? We will be back in Bet Dagan in a week. 
  "I worked in a grilled meat joint in Holon. Every summer I 
would go to the orchard in Bet Dagan, steal a few oranges, take 
them to my mother in Gaza, and tell her: These are from 
grandpa's orchard." 
  I ask him: "So what, do you dream of going back to Bet 
Dagan?" 
  He replies: "My mother does. I no longer do, there is no 
chance. But we have at home Turkish papers of our deed on the 
orchard. Now I take very good care of them. In another three 
years they will start talking about the right of return. 
Perhaps they will talk with us about compensation." 
  Within a few days -- they have been talking about "a few 
days" for a long time now -- 'Arafat must present the list of 
the 24 members of the autonomy council. These will make up the 
government of Gaza and Jericho, and if it works out, they will 
also get powers over the rest of the West Bank. Then, according 
to plans, there will be elections. The elections were scheduled 
to be held in July, when the talk was that Israel would hand 
over Gaza in December. December went by, so will July, and 
nobody believes elections will be held before December '94, and 
'Arafat has not yet finished compiling the list. 
  "That's how 'Arafat works," a local political activist 
says. "You are only now getting to know him. But we know that 
'Arafat will issue the list at the 11th hour, and even that will 
not be the final list. He has one list in his left pocket and 
another in his right pocket; one in his attache case, another in 
the drawer, three others in the closet, and 200 men are walking 
around the territories, each one of them with a list 'Arafat 
sent him by fax, and all the lists are hot air." 
  Ilyas Frayj from Bethlehem agreed to be included in the 
list. 
So did Dr. Zakariya al-Agha from Gaza. 'Arafat wants them in 
because he is sure of their allegiance. Dr. Furayh Abu-Middayn 
also acceded. He is more acceptable to the locals. "In the end 
we will give him the same job like that woman you have, the one 
with the teased hairdo, Miryam Ben-Porat." 
  "We will take a look at the list and decide accordingly," 
journalist Tawfiq Abu-Husa, a Fatah leader in the Gaza Strip 
says. "If it looks good to us, we will work with them. If not, 
we will tell 'Arafat: With all due respect, you are the 
president, you compile the lists, but tell us one thing: When 
will the elections be held?" 
  In the meantime, local leaders resort to tactics. Dr. Hanan 
'Ashrawi is out of the picture. Sa'ib 'Urayqat decided now, of 
all times, to go to London to collect material about a future 
election. 'Arafat should get the hint. Faysal al-Husayni 
protests. People in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip are busy 
building the infrastructure for political parties. Fatah is 
becoming a party. PFLP [Palestinian Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine] and DFLP [Democratic Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine] activists are launching propaganda campaigns 
criticizing the agreement. Everything is politics. 
  Fatah men take the newly-arrived generals to visit the 
refugee camps. "They are completely detached from the reality 
in the field," one activist says, "and it is very important that 
they know what the people think so that we do not reach a 
situation where they, our own police, are perceived as foreign 
rulers, just as the Israelis. General Ziyad al-Atrash, the 
former commander of the Palestinian force in Algiers, is already 
visiting the camps, talking to people, and feeling great among 
them. There are others who have not yet managed to make 
contact. They will have a problem." 
  In the midst of all this, some people are making their 
electoral calculations. Some 7,000 Palestinian policemen, along 
with their families, will be arriving from the Arab countries. 
A cautious estimate puts their total number at 50,000. 
According to another cautious estimate, about half of them are 
eligible voters. This is significant. 
  People in Nabulus, Ramallah, and Janin are closely watching 
what is and what will be happening in Gaza. They are the next 
in line. Apparently, the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] also 
understands that. The whole way from Petah Tiqva to Nabulus I 
did not see even one IDF patrol on the road. Author David 
Grossman's book "The Yellow Wind" has turned into the "yellow 
line." A yellow line crosses the length of Nabulus so that a 
settler from Elon More should not, God forbid, make a wrong turn 
in the road. I did not see even one car with yellow license 
plates [Israeli-owned] on the road. Driving through Nabulus' 
main street, people looked at my Israeli vehicle with 
astonishment. Who is that nut? 
  "What troubles me," a Gush Emunim settler told me, "is that 
what Rabin said about the IDF being primarily committed to 
protect the inhabitants within the Green Line is slowly sinking 
in. The IDF sees to Ethiopians who come from Gundar, and to us 
it doesn't? Just like everybody else, I am sure that terror 
attacks here will now increase. So, to cover his ass the chief 
of staff says he expects this. But what about practical 
measures? I want the IDF to obligate us to drive in convoys 
escorted by security guards to ensure our safety." 
  "But then you will say that the IDF restricts your 
movements," I tell him. "Whoever wants to say that, let him. 
However, this is what the IDF must do; it must understand that 
it is also responsible for our security." 
  Jericho is said to have been one of the calmest spots during 
the intifadah. Anybody driving through Jericho understands why: 
water, greenery, the climate. Those who own land, deal with 
the land and not with firebombs. 
  Hardly any incident was registered in 'Ayn al-Bayda', 
halfway 
between Tubas and Nabulus, during the intifadah. It is a 
beautiful spot. Streams flow by the road, there is a lot of 
greenery, and a developed industry of carpets made of the 
abundant reeds growing in the area. 
  Plastic chairs can be seen on every roof; a sign that people 
sit in the terrace in the evenings, breathing fresh air, and 
relaxing. Usually, in such places there are not many PLO flags. 
In local joints, 'Arafat's picture hangs next to the popular 
poster of the crying child. "Allah willing," says Ahmad Tubasi, 
"soon we will also have autonomy." What do you mean by soon? 
He replies: Elections, a state, whatever. 
  He has never been and may never be in Gaza. He will soon go 
visit Jericho, and so probably will other people from Ramallah 
and Nabulus, "to see what a Palestinian state is. In the 
meantime, we have our home, our fields. If there is no state, 
we will also manage; we will go visit the state." 
  The Jericho bypass road is another story. A narrow and bumpy 
road which prolongs the way to Jerusalem by another 15 minutes. 
You fantasize about lunch in some garden restaurant in the 
city, but have to make do with a hot dog and mustard in a 
roadside diner. 
  All traffic has been diverted to the Jericho bypass for a 
week now. There is no access to Jerusalem until the 
Palestinians are done taking over. On Monday, singer Ari'el 
Zilber will perform at the diner. Perhaps he will cheer up the 
residents of Ma'ale Efrayim and Patza'el. About 50 reservists 
were lying on the lawn outside the diner this week. They did 
not feel like going anywhere. "Come on guys," the officer 
exhorted them, "get going." "Come off it," the unit's clown 
answered, "it is a pity we did not leave them the gasoline too." 
Then I see a long and endless row of dozens of jeeps by the 
roadside. Carrying only the radio equipment, the soldiers are 
on their way to their base near Jerusalem. The Jericho exodus. 
  Passage to and from Jericho has been blocked for a week. 
Locals crowd the square waiting for the arrival of the police. 
The media and other foreigners wait outside. Assertive border 
policemen prohibit the entry. Journalists covering the 
territories threaten to appeal to the High Court of Justice. As 
far as the IDF is concerned, they can go on threatening. Who is 
allowed to enter Jericho? Locals, inhabitants of the 
territories, and tourists. If the tourists have an Israeli 
driver with the proper papers, they will be allowed in. Israeli 
Arabs will not. So, why does the car with yellow license plates 
ahead of me enter? These are Arabs from East Jerusalem, the 
border policeman tells me, they own houses in Jericho. 
  If people do not see this as a sign of what is yet to come 
-- 
the question of Jerusalem, who will vote and who will be elected 
in the territories -- then they know nothing about signs. 
  The American Colony Hotel is still the base of the foreign 
media in the territories. There I meet Ziyad Abu-Ziyad, a 
Palestinian representative to the talks with Israel. Abu-Ziyad 
does not want an official job, but he pulls strings and walks 
around with a cellular phone. He can dial 'Arafat whenever he 
wants, and get an answer. 
  He, just like me, does not believe the interim arrangement 
in 
the Gaza Strip and the West Bank will last long. "The 
Gaza-Jericho agreement should be allowed to work for a short 
time, but the question of the settlements will come up 
immediately afterward. The settlements are connected with 
everything. Do they want us to take over health affairs in the 
West Bank? The question of the settlements contaminating the 
environment with their sewage water will immediately come up. 
Do they want us to take over education? There are places in the 
territories where the Army forces schools to open at 0700 so 
that there are no children on the roads when the settlers drive 
to work. If they want to talk with us about elections, 
according to the agreement the IDF must withdraw its troops from 
populated areas. How can it do that when it must also guard the 
access roads to the settlements? In my opinion, the whole 
process will be accelerated." 
  "Not everything is up to 'Arafat," a local Gazan activist 
tells me. "Our goal now is to show that what we are talking 
about here is a state. You may say whatever you want, but we 
will do what we understand. 'Arafat may also say whatever he 
wants, but he should bear in mind that in the last seven years 
we got used to rebelling. Nobody will force us to do something 
we do not agree to."

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Furayh Abu-Middayn, member of the </F>
Palestinian National Authority, by Radio Monte Carlo 
correspondent Salim Badawi; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Abu-Middayn] The transfer of power has actually 
taken place. It is over now. The only pending issues are those 
issues related to daily life, such as travel permits, permits to 
enter Israel, bringing food from inside Israel, maintaining 
electrical current and telephone lines, and other issues. 
However, the administrative apparatus, which includes 6,400 
employees, is running like a watch in the Gaza Strip. Military 
positions are under our control. Their reconstruction is under 
way to make them fit the coming stage. The problem is that we 
are starting at zero. It is true that we have an administrative 
apparatus, but so far the donor countries have not sent enough 
money to turn the wheel of daily economic life. 
  [Badawi] Yes, there must obstacles. How are you facing these 
obstacles? Can you specify some of them? 
  [Abu-Middayn] First of all, the major obstacle is now the 
arrival of university students in the West Bank at their places 
of study. This issue has not been resolved completely. The 
second problem is that for the last 27 years Israel made 
everything in the Gaza Strip, the electrical current, 
telephones, and even the milk cup, dependent on the Israeli 
economy, in a programmed and systematic manner. Therefore, we 
cannot get rid of this overnight. This is a very difficult 
problem to resolve. Based on this, I can give you an example 
about bread and how to get flour from inside Israel. The 
merchant first must get a permit. This needs time. So, once 
again, the permits are a major point. The agreements signed in 
Paris and elsewhere are not implemented on the ground. 
  [Badawi] So, how do you coordinate with the Israelis, 
particularly on daily life issues, as you said? 
  [Abu-Middayn] There is a liaison committee formed of five of 
our colleagues. They spend four hours a day on this. We believe 
that immediately after the 'Id al-Adha, there will be a daily 
plan of work with the Israeli side concerning our joint affairs. 
However, internally, we have full independence these days. We 
feel that decisions are being made. So, the heaviest burden is 
being shouldered by the National Authority members. They were 
quickly chosen for this post in the Gaza Strip. There are only 
three members, Dr. Zakariya al-Agha, Dr. Riyad al-Za'nun, and 
Furayh Abu-Middayn. We were forced to make preliminary 
decisions on the ground even before official procedures such as 
oath-taking or the completion of the Palestinian National 
Authority. As you know, it includes 24 members, and not all 
have been named. However, we are now compelled to take urgent 
measures and to make decisions on the ground on a daily and 
hourly basis. 
  [Badawi] As you said, there is intermingling between the 
administration of daily affairs and long-term planning 
concerning the self-rule areas. 
  [Abu-Middayn] This is true. We are trying to create new 
facts and mechanisms on the ground. We are waiting for 
financing, for the Marshall plan, so to say. There is the $1.2 
billion the World Bank should give to us to begin immediate 
financing. There is also the EC and another $750 million. The 
truth is that we must build an infrastructure. This is the most 
important problem facing us on the ground. The roads, schools, 
hospitals, and even the armies brought from outside all need 
houses and other services. 
  [Badawi] What kind of infrastructures are now available to 
you in Gaza and Jericho? 
  [Abu-Middayn] We have only highly qualified cadres, but no 
money. This is the problem. The vehicle is lubricated, the 
driver is in it, and it is waiting to be filled with gas, if we 
can say that. We need to pump a huge amount of money. 
Approximately 60,000-70,000 jobs must be created. This is 
because Israel has closed 60,000 jobs inside Israel. There is a 
manpower problem in Israel. Unemployment has reached 60-65 
percent. This is the most serious problem. Unemployment in the 
Gaza Strip has reached the zero point or the red line. I am 
sorry to have deviated from your question, but the truth is that 
the Arab and Israeli blockades have integrated against us in the 
Gaza Strip. You know that the Gaza Strip is like an island in 
the sea. It is surrounded by Israel and the sea. 
  [Badawi] Can we say that your projects are ready and the 
only 
thing missing is money? 
  [Abu-Middayn] Yes. I hope the donor countries will fulfill 
their obligations. We do not want to be another Yeltsin or 
another Russia with just more and more promises, especially 
since we are not asking for a favor, but this is the Middle East 
equation, namely, that without Palestine there will neither be 
economic or security stability. 
  [Badawi] Mr. Furayh Abu-Middayn: How are the people inside 
taking the new situation? 
  [Abu-Middayn] They are looking to the future with a mixture 
of hope and apprehension. They are glad to be rid of the 
khaki-clad occupation troops that ruled over them for 27 years 
and sent 220,000 of them to prison. This nightmare is over. 
However, the discussions of bread and butter issues will begin 
in a week or two. This is what the Palestinian people inside 
look to with fervent hope. We are up to the challenge. But the 
world has obligated us to this agreement, such as it is. 
[sentence as heard] However, this is not the Palestinian peace 
we are looking for. But we will create from this limited 
achievement something for the future. The international 
community must, however, remember that for over two and half 
years of negotiations it has pressed the Palestinians [words 
indistinct] and (?then we will see what happens later). Even the 
Europeans [word indistinct], even those who have made the 
nuclear option available to Israel took this position. The 
Palestinians are, therefore, rightly apprehensive about the 
future and that the international bodies will not deliver on the 
promises they have made to the Palestinian people over the past 
few years. 
  [Badawi] As you know, in addition to the day-to-day problems 
you are facing, there is the fundamental issue of the settlers. 
This week some of them went with their weapons to pray in 
Jericho. Do the Palestinian police have a contingency plan to 
contain and handle any future friction; are they armed with the 
necessary powers to do that? 
  [Abu-Middayn] Let me put it this way. Land mines have been 
left behind -- three settlements in the Gaza Strip and the 
synagogue in Jericho. These are flashpoints that bring to mind 
what happened in Hebron. Yesterday, a settler close to Netzarim 
was fired on. Today, they carried out provocations on the street 
that goes past this settlement. We have pointed this out to the 
Israelis and tried to convince them that, if only for their own 
safety, these three settlements must be dismantled. Some 550 
soldiers are posted to provide protection for 150 settlers. The 
settlement problem in the Gaza Strip... [pauses], I want to 
break the glad news to you that 50 to 60 percent of the settlers 
are bracing to leave the strip. I have been reliably informed 
that they are putting in claims for compensation in return for 
moving behind the green line. The security settlements you are 
asking about are problematic, whether we are talking about the 
Jericho synagogue or the three Gaza settlements. These are 
flashpoints. The settlers travel on Arab roads in the Gaza 
Strip under Army escort. But this is a daily friction that I 
fear may erupt into a bloody incident. The Israeli Government 
must, therefore, consider the removal of these three outposts. 
We may be able to work out a solution in the future. 
  [Badawi, interrupting] In the meantime... 
  [Abu-Middayn] But the settlement activity is the real 
obstacle. 
  [Badawi] In the meantime, how will you handle the potential 
for friction? 
  [Abu-Middayn] The Palestinian police have plans for such an 
eventuality. None of the settlers may leave their settlement 
without obtaining a prior permit. But, if an armed settler 
attacked a Palestinian, no one must expect him to be treated 
with patience. I am not issuing threats, but bullets will be 
returned in kind. 
  [Badawi] But this situation will cause problems for you with 
the Palestinians themselves, especially seeing that three 
Palestinian factions active inside the occupied land are 
refusing to surrender their weapons. How do you acquiesce to 
settlers carrying arms and deny this right to the Palestinians? 
  [Abu-Middayn] Last week, those who wagered on a Palestinian 
bloodbath or a fratricidal conflict were disabused of their 
illusions. Brothers in the opposition factions were out on the 
streets firing in the air in jubilation alongside the 
Palestinian army. Everyone saw this on television screens. The 
problem of Palestinian fighting Palestinian does not exist. 
  [Badawi] Yes, but three Palestinian organizations declared 
from Damascus that they refuse to hand over their weapons in the 
occupied territories. 
  [Abu-Middayn] Sir, they have not been asked to hand over 
their weapons. The handover of weapons has not been asked for. 
What is wanted is to rationalize weapons because control over 
weapons was lost in a certain phase. 
  There are 20,000 weapons in Gaza. Perhaps, 20 percent or 
less of these weapons are in the hands of organizations and 80 
percent of them are in the hands of ordinary citizens. I am 
concerned with the loose weapons present in the hands of 
ordinary citizens; these weapons have reached some criminal 
cells. These are the weapons that should be controlled. If 
anyone wants a weapon to protect himself or for other reasons, 
we can reach agreement and there can be a plan for licensing 
weapons or something similar in this regard. We, however, do not 
seek to arm the Palestinian people, the arms are a support for 
the Palestinians. These weapons [word indistinct] are a support 
for the Palestinian army's weapons, and they are not against 
this army. 
  [Badawi] There are other possibilities that cannot be 
subtracted from the practical theories, such as what happened in 
Hebron this week. To what extent would this be reflected on the 
situation in the self-rule areas? 
  [Abu-Middayn] I previously said so, and the Israeli side 
complained about a statement I made [words indistinct]. If what 
happened in Hebron took place at a time when we had 6,000-7,000 
soldiers in Gaza, the real massacre would have occurred in Gaza 
and not in Hebron. This is because the reply would have been 
harsh and violent because the Israeli Army is very strong. 
However, no one can [words indistinct]. 
  If a Gazan takes to the street, would we open fire on him? 
Definitely not. Thus, the Israelis, and not the Palestinian 
side, should take this into account. Knowing that 30 people 
were massacred at a mosque on a Friday in the month of Ramadan, 
we cannot say that we in Gaza would not make a violent reply. 
These issues are submitted to the Israeli side, which should 
study them because peace is more important than 400 extremists. 
I do not like to use the word extremist because, to me, each 
settler is an extremist. Thus, there are 120,000 extremists in 
the West Bank and Gaza; they are the settlers. Hence, the 
Israeli Government should have its own calculations. We did not 
carry out any action whatsoever. However, in case of 
self-defense and in order to defend dignity, there could be a 
bloodbath. 
  [Badawi] It can thus be said that construction work has 
begun, though it may be stumbling due to lack of the necessary 
funds. On the political level, however, do you have any idea 
about when the whole team of the National Authority Council will 
be joining you, or...? 
  [Abu-Middayn, interrupting] Very soon. I believe that by 
Saturday, the first day of 'Id al-Adha, President 'Arafat will 
have declared all the names. You know that the responsibility 
is heavy, and some brothers are reluctant to join the 
Palestinian National Authority. In other words, you know that 
there is fear of assuming responsibility at historic moments. 
This matter needs time to contemplate. I, however, believe 
there are dozens of people ready to accept this challenge. 
  [Badawi] Mr. Furayh Abu-Middayn: On the legal level, what 
laws and jurisdiction are you now implementing to resolve the 
differences you may face at times? 
  [Abu-Middayn] This is an important question. Palestinian 
law has existed since the British mandate. Egypt, during former 
President Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir's rule, kept this law until the 
time of Israeli occupation. The Gaza Strip's situation remained 
as a fully independent legal issue which used to bear the name 
of Palestine and there was a Palestinian constitution. The 
judicial system exists, and there are three levels of 
jurisdiction. The legal body exists but it was paralyzed in the 
past seven years after the policemen resigned. 
  Immediately following 'Id al-Adha, we will start work in the 
judicial field. The courts are ready but there are also 
criminal cases like thefts, murders, and others. Prisons will 
probably be ready within 48 hours to receive of course, 
smugglers, thieves, and others. We had hoped that we would have 
prisons. To cut things short, I would like to tell you that the 
first case is a surprising case. The first person we 
apprehended was a man who had stolen things from the Palestinian 
military administration. These things were the keys to Gaza 
prison. That's why we released him without any thought because 
stealing the prison keys had its meanings and historical 
dimensions after this long time. It will be the first time in 
our history that a Palestinian will sit in this place. We hope 
that we will be up to the responsibility. There must be a 
judicial system that is not factional, and that is independent, 
honest, and qualified. This is an essential equation and this 
is the sole guarantee. The military forces should be headed by 
a sound and independent legal body. The first thing we should 
do is to respect the law. 
  [Badawi] So far, how do you assess the response of the 
citizens to the police, the Palestinian force? 
  [Abu-Middayn] Let me tell you something. Murders, and the 
car thefts have decreased. Look at the cooperation on the 
streets. People from all walks of life visit police stations, 
and inform about violations. The man on the street in the Gaza 
Strip now even tries to avoid traffic violations. One week ago, 
things were different. One has started to feel that the streets 
are under control. There is a solid relationship between the 
Palestinian police and the people. A murder case took place two 
days ago and the investigation concerning it is proceeding 
normally and routinely. There is an understanding to activate 
the role of the law so that we may reach the next stage. How 
can we hold elections and exercise democracy without law and the 
prevalence of the law? 
  [Badawi] With respect to elections now, the talk is that 
they 
will be held in October, next fall. 
  [Abu-Middayn] Next fall because first of all the law should 
prevail. Otherwise, why hold elections? First, the issue of 
the elections should be seriously studied. We are doing our 
best in this respect. But, elections for a legislative council 
are not permitted at this stage. But municipal elections, rural 
council elections will, probably, be the first elections with 
which we will start. Then we will move to a higher stage. I 
believe that the Palestinian people are dutybound to set an 
example among these many Arab regimes which are fighting, 
particularly what we witness in Yemen. We are pained to see 
this taking place. 
  [Badawi] Mr. Furayh Abu-Middayn, thank you.

  [Text] One of the leaders of Fatah in the Gaza Strip, 
Furayh Abu-Middayn, said that there are no plans at this stage 
to disarm armed groups such as the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam. 
Speaking to reporter Mark Weiss this morning, Abu-Middayn said 
the main problem is that money and equipment promised to the 
Palestinian police force has still not arrived. 
  [Begin recording] [Abu-Middayn] Well, we are controlling 
very good, I am sure, but you know, communications and 
investors, all these facilities which the donors promised to 
send us -- particularly the Americans -- we did not receive it 
until now. This is a problem for security because we have no 
equipment, no sophisticated equipment for communications. We 
need cars, we need everything. There are a lot of promises, but 
nobody sends anything. This is the real problem for the 
Palestinians, but we are ready, our soldiers are there, our 
policemen are there, and everything is running like a watch. 
  [Weiss] When do you think the Palestinian police will be 
able to stop attacks against Israeli soldiers? 
  [Abu-Middayn] Look, as security will be within one week, it 
will be 100 percent perfect, but as you know, the real challenge 
for the Palestinians is they have not got any money even for 
next week. [sentence as heard] This is the real problem. 
  [Weiss] When do you expect the Palestinian police to move to 
disarm groups such as 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam? 
  [Abu-Middayn] You should ask Mr. 'Arafat or the military 
commanders. I have no answer for this question. 
  [Weiss] So far, there are no plans to move against these 
groups? 
  [Abu-Middayn] No, until now we have no plans. [end

<F P=106> [Report by Muhammad 'Ali al-Qulaybi: "Palestinian Ambassador </F>
to Jordan Tells AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: Palestinian Authority Council 
To Be Completed After 'Id al-Adha; Differences Between 'Arafat 
and Qaddumi Regarding the Return"] 
  [Text] Tunis -- Al-Tayyib 'Abd-al-Rahim, Palestinian 
ambassador to Jordan and Fatah Central Committee member, has 
stated that formation of the Palestinian Authority Council for 
Gaza and Jericho will be completed after the blessed 'Id al-Adha 
and will hold its first meeting in Cairo and subsequent meetings 
inside the occupied territory. 
  In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT in Tunis, 'Abd-al-Rahim 
said that Fatah's Revolutionary Council approved the autonomy 
agreement signed by Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and 
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin on Wednesday 4 May in Cairo. 
  He added that the Council unanimously decided to return to 
Gaza and Jericho and to form committees to pass instructions and 
duties to the cadres to enter the homeland as soon as possible 
in accordance with a preconceived plan. 
  'Abd-al-Rahim denied divisions and differences of opinion 
between members of the Revolutionary Council which, he said, is 
a framework within which views and ideas interact, issues are 
discussed, and decisions are made on the basis of agreement and 
reconciliation. 
  He pointed out that there were two trends in the Council: 
One 
led by Faruq Qaddumi (Abu-al-Lutf), head of the Political 
Department, who wants the return to be gradual at all levels 
from the command to the lowest organization level. The other 
trend, led by President Yasir 'Arafat, believes that the entry 
of Fatah and PLO cadres into Gaza and Jericho should be done in 
full strength and weight because the situation is ripe for that 
and because the process of building the autonomy authority in 
Gaza and Jericho requires the pooling of all efforts and 
resources to ensure success of that experiment and, therefore, 
pave the way for PLO success in future steps aimed at setting up 
an independent Palestinian state with holy Jerusalem as its 
capital. 
  Al-Tayyib 'Abd-al-Rahim, who is also a member of Fatah's 
Revolutionary Council, confirmed that all the Council's members 
have expressed support for the decision to return to Gaza and 
Jericho in accordance with a specific plan and instructions for 
all cadres, and that 10 special committees have started their 
task of placing the cadres in their appropriate place within the 
national authority. These committees represent all the 
political, economic, security, educational, and other sectors 
under national authority powers. 
  The Fatah Central Committee member said that all Palestinian 
qualified patriots would participate in the process of building 
the Palestinian entity, and that the process would not be 
confined to qualified people from the factions because "the 
Palestinian authority belongs to all the Palestinian people and 
not just one group." 
  'Abd-al-Rahim said that he might be assigned the duties of 
the presidency's general secretariat.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Jericho Mayor Jamil Sabri Khalaf </F>
in Jericho, by Ashraf 'Abd-al-'Aziz in Cairo, date not given; 
from the "Dialogue From Afar" program] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Mr. Khalaf, Dr. 
Nabil Sha'th visited Gaza and Jericho in the first such visit by 
a Palestinian official to Gaza and Jericho, the Palestinian 
self-rule areas. Can you tell us what happened during the 
meetings he held and the nature of his visit? 
  [Khalaf] Dr. Nabil Sha'th is one of the leaders who have 
worked and made great efforts to establish peace in the region. 
It is also very natural for him to be with us on two occasions: 
The first occasion is the entry of the Palestinian police and 
the second occasion is the 'Id al-Adha. Of course, his being 
with us leaves a very good impression and gives a feeling of 
security. He is an official of the PLO, under the leadership of 
Chairman 'Arafat. This leaves a very good impression with the 
forces and citizens and provides them with a great sense of 
security that a top-ranking Palestinian official, Mr. Nabil 
Sha'th, is visiting the area. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Israel doubts the ability of the Palestinian 
police to perform their security duties in the Palestinian 
territories. What can we say about the capabilities of the 
Palestinian police or the policeman? 
  [Khalaf] There is no doubt that every good citizen who likes 
peace and loves his country will consider himself a policeman 
and keep the peace and security. Naturally, the citizens of the 
city joined the policemen, and everyone is enjoying the fact 
that they are abiding by the law and applying it in order to 
provide peace of mind for every citizen. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Mr. Khalaf, Palestinian president 'Arafat 
will enter the Palestinian territories at the beginning of next 
month. What kind of reception he will be given by the 
Palestinian people? 
  [Khalaf] There is no doubt that there are many preparations 
under way to receive the Palestinian president on the 
appropriate date, which he himself will determine. The city is 
patiently awaiting his arrival. His return to the city and 
entry to the region will be a historic day. The cities of Gaza 
and Jericho are the first experiments for the Palestinian people 
in establishing peace. Praise be to God that autonomy has 
started in Gaza and Jericho. We welcome the president to his 
land and city and among his people. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Mr. Khalaf, there are reports that the 
Palestine National Council [PNC] will meet in Jericho. What can 
you tell us about this meeting, and when will it will be held? 
  [Khalaf] The date will be fixed by the president and the 
brothers in the PNC. We hope it will be a historic date in 
Jericho. It will be a historic starting point for the 
Palestinian people and we welcome the PNC members here. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Mr. Jamil Sabri Khalaf, Jericho mayor, we 
thank you very much for this telephone interview and wish you a 
happy 'Id al-Adha. We also wish the Palestinian people health 
and prosperity. 
  [Khalaf] Many happy returns to you, the Islamic and Arab 
nations, wherever you may be.

<F P=106> [By Sakher Abou Eloun] </F>
  [Text] Gaza City, Gaza Strip, May 22 (AFP) -- The new 
Palestinian intelligence chief for Gaza and Jericho emerged 
Sunday from 27 years in the shadows, but said he was "too tired" 
to talk and scrapped a welcome home party. 
  Brigadier-General Misbah Hanafi Rushdi Saqr returned to his 
wife who believed he was dead after he went missing during the 
1967 Middle East war. 
  An AFP correspondent spotted the moustachioed general on 
Sunday walking to a Gaza City cemetery where his mother and 
father were buried. 
  But the intelligence chief for the autonomous areas, who 
looked drawn and pale in his olive-green uniform of the 
Palestine Liberation Army (PLA), said: "I'm too tired to talk." 
  His family said they learned on Saturday that he would be 
coming home and had prepared a welcoming party with other 
relatives. 
  But the general maintained his awesome reputation for 
discretion after, according to Palestinian police officers, 
living half his life clandestinely in Israel under a false name. 
  He apologized saying he was exhausted and asked for the 
celebrations to be cancelled. Journalists were told to leave 
the family home. 
  A brief announcement from PLO headquarters in Tunis last 
week 
that Saqr was to head the intelligence service stunned even 
those closest to the man, who all believed him dead. 
  PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat "announced to us, a few days ago, 
that he would be the next chief of the intelligence services," 
an officer in the Palestinian police force told AFP. 
  Born in Gaza in 1943, Saqr graduated as an officer from the 
Cairo military academy in the late 1950s. He was PLA commander 
for the Khan Yunus area of Gaza in 1967, when he disappeared 
without a trace. 
  A nephew, taxi-driver Bashir Saqr, said the head of the 
Palestinian police force had contacted the family directly. 
  "General Nasr Yusuf sent two of his men to my house ... and 
asked my mother: 'Where's your brother Misbah?' The poor woman 
replied she had no idea," the nephew said. 
  "Then I met a deputy to the general who asked me what I knew 
of my uncle Misbah, and I replied that he was dead. 
  "He replied: 'No. Your uncle is alive and is living 
somewhere nearby. If he turns up or calls, tell him that 
president 'Arafat wants to speak to him or that he should come 
to our offices.'" 
  Some people believed General Saqr had drowned swimming the 
Jordan River from the West Bank to Jordan. 
  But his brother Hamis said he had never really believed 
Misbah was dead. "I didn't wear black in mourning. I asked the 
International Committee of the Red Cross but they never found 
him in Israeli prisons." 
  He also investigated in Amman and Beirut as well as with the 
PLO, who said the general had died a martyr for the Palestinian 
cause. 
  "When I found out he was still alive, I burst into tears," 
said the brother, a merchant in Gaza City. 
  Even the general's wife, Nismat Barzak, who runs a school, 
had no contact with him throughout the Israeli occupation, 
according to the family. 
  Their two grown-up sons, who work abroad in Arab countries, 
also never saw their father and "only know his face from old 
photographs," said Hamis. 
  A large crowd gathered at the family home in Gaza's 
up-market 
Rimal neighbourhood, but they were disappointed as Saqr did not 
appear. 
  He was seen sitting quietly at the back of the house which 
was protected by a large number of armed bodyguards. 
  Gun-wielding Palestinian guerrillas of the Hawks, armed wing 
of the mainstream PLO movement Fatah, were also kept away. 
  "I do not have authority to talk to anyone," Saqr told AFP.

  [Text] Two Israeli citizens were arrested by Palestinian 
policemen in Jericho and their personal weapons were 
confiscated. The two Israelis were released a short while ago. 
The men are residents of the Na'ama settlement, who apparently 
went to Jericho to shop. 
  The incident was reported to our correspondent in the 
territories Golan Yokhpaz today by residents of the Jordan Rift 
Valley. One of the men who was arrested is Arye Shahar, the 
security officer at Na'ama. Shahar managed to use his 
walkie-talkie to report that he and his friend had been detained 
and taken to the Palestinian police station in Jericho. Na'ama 
residents expressed great fury at what they called a flagrant 
violation of the Cairo agreement. The circumstances leading to 
the arrest of the two Israelis remain unclear, as does the 
reason for their release.

  [Text] Palestinian policemen arrested two settlers from 
Na'ama in Jericho and confiscated their handguns. Sa'adi Naji, 
the commander of the Jericho Police, apologized for the incident 
and explained that his men had acted wrongly because they had 
not understood their orders. The two settlers and their weapons 
were transferred to the regional coordination office. This was 
reported by our correspondents Gil Litman and Moti Amir.

  [Text] The Cairo agreement on the implementation of self- 
government in Gaza and Jericho will be translated into Arabic in 
order to make even the junior Palestinian officers in Gaza and 
Jericho familiar with it. Our correspondent Moti Amir reports 
that it has emerged that the Palestinian leaders have failed to 
explicate the written details of the agreement to the 
Palestinian population and security forces. A Palestinian 
source told our correspondent that the Palestinian leaders often 
prefer to explain events on the ground in their own way and 
contrary to the agreement, perhaps in order to win the 
Palestinian public's support.

  [Text] Palestinian policemen manning a roadblock in the 
northern part of the Gaza Strip fired shots at the tires of an 
Israeli vehicle transporting Arab workers from Nisanit to the 
Erez checkpoint. Nobody was hurt in the incident. 
  The Israeli contractor who drove the car told our 
correspondent Nisim Qeynan that he did not stop at the 
Palestinian roadblock because he wanted to be checked only at 
the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] roadblock. He claims that the 
soldiers manning the IDF roadblock ordered him to return to the 
Palestinian roadblock for inspection. The fire was directed at 
his car as he was driving back toward that roadblock.

responsible source announced this evening that King Fahd 
Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz Al Sa'ud, custodian of the two holy mosques, 
may God preserve him, had earlier sent a message to His 
Excellency President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the 
Presidential Council of the Republic of Yemen, in which he 
expressed his hopes for an end to the fighting during the days 
of the blessed 'Id al-Adha, out of respect for this Islamic 
occasion. This took place when the beloved king received His 
Excellency Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, Yemeni planning and 
development minister, last Wednesday, 18 May. 
  The source went on to say: Consultations between the two 
sides continued on bringing about an end to the fighting.

President Salih, during which a number of matters were 
discussed. Chief among these was the Yemeni issue. 
  The source added: When the Yemeni mass media announced a 
three-day cease-fire this evening, effective from midnight, King 
Fahd Bin- 'Abd-al-'Aziz talked by phone with His Excellency 
President Salih and expressed his appreciation for the pleasing 
response regarding the cease-fire.

  [Text] Tripoli, al-Maa [May] 14, (JANA) -- After the 
bitter suffering, hardship, the death of some of them and loss 
of many camels, the Libyan Arab pilgrims, heading for Mecca to 
perform their religious duty, crossed on camels the Jordanian 
territory to Saudi Arabia after they arrived in Jordan from 
Egypt on a crossing ferry through the Red Sea. This was due to 
the occupation of the area of Umm al-Rashrash by the Zionist 
enemy separating it from the Arab world and blocking the land 
road to Mecca. 
  The Libyan Arab pilgrims arrived on camels in the area of 
Halat 'Ammar in Saudi Arabia where they were welcomed by members 
of the brotherhood bureau to Saudi Arabia and the Saudi 
authorities in the area. 
  The pilgrims chanted slogans reaffirming their determination 
to continue their journey to Mecca. 
  Also the pilgrims chanted slogans in support of the great 
al- 
Fateh revolution and its leader reasserting their defiance of 
the unjust measures imposed on the Great Jamahiriyah by Western 
countries preventing the Libyan Arab citizens from performing 
their religious duty.

<F P=106> [Friday sermon by Shaykh 'Abd-al-'Aziz Bin-'Abdallah al- </F>
Shaykh, member of the council of senior ulema, to hajj pilgrims 
at Namirah Mosque, near Mecca -- live] 
  [Excerpts] Brothers: May God's peace and benediction be on 
you [passage omitted]. 
  O nation of Islam: Look at the sedition in the ranks of the 
Muslim nation. There is sedition as well as wars, internecine 
fighting and mutual destruction in a number of Muslim countries. 
Sedition which has led to loss of life, property and the 
destruction of the country. But who benefits from all this? 
Muslims should fear God and their religion; they should spare 
the destruction of their people and should remember that God 
will be questioning them on the sedition and the wars and He 
will be judging them on that sedition. O nation of Islam, you 
should fear God. 
  Let us go back to the teachings of our true religion. Let us 
make God's teachings an arbiter in our problems. Let us think 
and contemplate that such sedition will not bring any good to 
our nation. It will only bring destruction to property and 
people. And it will only sow the seeds of hatred between 
members of the nation. It will make it less united and it will 
destroy its resources. You should, O nation of Islam, fear God, 
use your wisdom and try to avoid sedition. Nothing good will 
ever come from sedition. [passage omitted] 
  O nation of Islam, nation of Islam: The enemies of the 
nation 
have been trying to discredit it by claiming that Islam has 
ignored human rights and that the latter has been ignored in 
Muslim faith. This is a lie and a fallacy. Anyone who cares to 
examine our faith will find out that it is the faith which has 
guaranteed the true meaning of human rights. God has said to 
his messenger: We have sent thee, save as a mercy unto all 
beings. [passage omitted] 
  Human rights have been guaranteed under our faith. Creeds 
before Islam used to fight each other. Whenever a creed 
triumphed over another one it tried to annihilate it as much as 
it could. But once God sent Muhammad, may God's prayers and 
benedictions be upon him, as a mercy to the nation and to 
humanity... Hence, human rights are respected by our shari'ah 
and by the Muslim faith. Believers must, however, obey the 
shari'ah; they must obey its divine ordinance on what is 
permitted and what is not. Their religion has urged them to do 
so. The true Muslim is someone who would not harm other Muslims 
by words or deeds. [last sentence from the hadith] [passage 
omitted] 
  Our religion has protected human rights for everybody and 
those who claim respect for human rights are the ones who are 
the enemies of mankind, the ones whose societies gave birth to 
racial and ethnic discrimination, the ones who are making 
weapons of destruction so that the Islamic nations use them to 
eliminate one another. They are the ones who ignite sedition. 
Islam, with its tenets, is innocent of the terrible events and 
horrible massacres which one sees around. [passage omitted: 
Islam is against dishonesty and treacherous behavior; giving 
examples from the prophet's behaviour] 
  Islam is a religion of mercy, justice, and equity, and those 
who (?allege) that Islam relinquishes the human rights of 
Muslims and non-Muslims are deceiving people. Islam protects 
the very meaning of human rights. [passage omitted: the ummah 
and its leaders are abiding by the Islamic law as dictated by 
the Holy Book] 
  Muslims should not listen to the ideas, deceptions, and 
calumnies of the enemies of Islam. They must trust their 
religion and know that their Islam is God's religion, which 
Allah chose and entrusted his messenger to convey. [passage 
omitted]

  [Excerpts] 22 May, SPA [dateline as received] -- King Fahd 
Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz Al Sa'ud, the custodian of the two holy 
mosques, and His Royal Highness Prince 'Abdallah Bin-'Abd 
al-'Aziz Al Sa'ud, crown prince, deputy prime minister, and 
commander of the National Guard, sent an exhaustive address to 
the pilgrims on the occasion of the pilgrimage season of 1414 AH 
corresponding to 1994. Here now follows the text of this 
address. 
  In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. We 
thank Almighty God for having bestowed on us the religion of 
Islam, and for having guided us on the right path and made us 
the best nation on earth that preaches good and avoids evil. 
[passage omitted] 
  Brothers, delegations to the holy house of God, brother 
Muslims everywhere! The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is pained by 
the tense situation in most of the Islamic land nowadays. The 
bloody situation in Afghanistan, in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and 
elsewhere causes regret, pain, and also worry. We have made 
considerable and consistent efforts at all levels, through all 
channels, and by all means to bring an end to the current 
tragedy in Bosnia-Herzegovina. We pinned hope on the recent move 
provided for in the agreement signed on 1 March 1994, concerning 
the establishment of a unified state between the brother Muslims 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina and their Bosnian Croat friends and 
compatriots, which would end in the setting up of a 
confederation with the neighboring Republic of Croatia. This 
was thought to be a practical step acceptable to the parties to 
the conflict, which would bring about security, peace, and 
concord. [passage omitted] 
  However, this optimism did not last long because the Serbs 
continued their aggression, defied the international community, 
stood up in front of the successive UN Security Council 
resolutions to halt the aggression and protect Bosnian safe 
zones, and refused and continue to refuse to heed international 
legality. This high-handedness and messing about can be 
deterred only by a decisive international determination that 
will move the efforts of the United Nations from the stage of 
caution and courtesy to other states, and from hesitation over 
the risk of an extension of the war zones into an energetic and 
decisive military measure against all those who practice 
high-handedness and injustice and challenge the international 
will. Just as it has affirmed what is right and refuted 
injustice and aggression, such a will can do away with the 
arrogance and defiance of the Serbs, entrench equitable rights, 
and impose peace that will ensure security and stability for all. 
  As an Islamic nation with more than 1 billion Muslims, we 
must bear our responsibilities and apply pressure to impose 
peace and stability in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and we must strive to 
secure the safety of its people and come to the help of the 
latter. [passage omitted] 
  Brothers, Muslims in all corners of the world. With hearts 
filled with sadness and pain, we are following the gradual 
deteriorating situation in Afghanistan. This is unacceptable by 
any Muslim who is aware that shedding the blood of another 
Muslim is prohibited by God. What is more, shedding the blood 
of a Muslim by his brother is not only prohibited, but is also a 
human tragedy and a historic precedent that is taking place in 
an era of knowledge, education, understanding, and the promotion 
of the values of mankind. 
  Despite all the justifications that are provided for the 
continuation of the bloody situation there, fighting among the 
sons of one people is an unacceptable tragedy. The destruction 
of the country and the exhaustion of the Afghan achievements is 
an irresponsible act by any material, ethical, and human 
standards. Above all, it is unacceptable by the standards of the 
pure Muslims jurisdiction that is against the squandering of 
peoples capabilities and the violation of their rights to live 
in security and stability. 
  We in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia did not expect to see 
happen what has happened and is still happening in Afghanistan, 
because we were convinced that the sons and leaders of 
Afghanistan were aware that the shock of fighting in 
Afghanistan, its motives, and circumstances would be disastrous. 
[passage omitted] 
  What is happening in Afghanistan has tarnished the true 
image 
of the genuine Islamic Jihad that is carried out in the name of 
God; yet this Jihad is driven by individuals' whims, 
affiliations to groups and gatherings, and the conflict between 
the sons who share the same faith and land. 
  Not only that, but what is happening there gave the 
impression that individual ambitions that had emerged there had 
become bigger than Afghanistan, and that the attainment and 
achievement of these ambitions and interests take precedence 
over everything else, even if this meant a long war between the 
bellicose parties and turning the country into ruins because of 
the spread of a civil war. [passage omitted] 
  Today, however, and three years after the Afghan state had 
recovered its identity and sovereignty, we cannot find any 
justification for what is happening there. The only 
justification we can find is that this situation forms a part of 
a huge plot that targets not only Afghanistan and the Arab and 
Islamic states, but it also targets Islam and Muslims inside a 
Muslim land that had witnessed the greatest acts of heroism and 
gave rise to some of the greatest men in Islam. 
  What causes us real pain and real suffering, and what really 
frightens us is to see Afghanistan, and for some long years, as 
a source of concern, disturbances, and instability in the whole 
world; after it had been a source of amity and peace on earth. 
Do the leaders of Afghanistan really accept this situation?. 
[passage omitted] 
  The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia does not blame any party at the 
expense of another party for what is happening there, it 
considers them all responsible for the continuing explosive 
situation. It appeals to everybody to show a responsible stance 
through which an end to the bloody phase can be reached; they 
should look to the future with open minds and hearts; they 
should put the interest and the people of Afghanistan above all 
other considerations. 
  Only then we will open our hearts to all of them and welcome 
them once again in Mecca, and for the last time, to agree the 
foundations that they deem suitable to bring about peace and 
stability to Afghanistan. 
  Brothers in God, Muslims everywhere: In spite of the 
relative 
calm in Somalia after a difficult period of conflict and 
fighting among its various sections, nationalities, and leaders, 
the situation is still vague and threatens danger at any moment. 
  The final reconciliation has not happened. Therefore, the 
lying in wait by some sections for the others still constitutes 
a danger to stability in that country. [passage omitted] 
  We thank God that our sons in Somalia have successfully 
discharged their humanitarian duties in the best way, and they 
are meeting with all appreciation and respect from all the 
Somalis who have seen their efforts and benefitted from their 
food and medical aid. What we have always hoped and wished for 
is to see the brothers in Somalia arrive at a formula acceptable 
to all of them, so that all parties get together in the service 
of the Somali homeland, and all potentials and capabilities may 
be put in the hands of a state able to save the country from the 
causes of division and dispersion. [passage omitted] 
  Brother heads and delegation members, brother Muslims 
everywhere. There are three basic issues that are now giving us 
a great deal of concern and to which we attach considerable 
interest. These issues are: First, the peace process; second, 
security in the Gulf region; third, the situation in Yemen. 
  We in Saudi Arabia look forward to, and strive continuously 
for security and stability everywhere in the world, and 
particularly in our region, for our brothers and for all states 
and peoples of the world. We thank God that the peace process 
has gone ahead satisfactorily, and that on 5 May the Palestinian 
brothers managed to attain with the Israelis a final agreement 
in Cairo to hand over the authority in Gaza and Jericho and the 
start of a new era of coexistence, and turn the peace efforts 
into practice. We are happy to see the Palestinian brothers 
begin a new era of exercising their legitimate rights on their 
land, and Saudi Arabia will continue to stand on the side of the 
just Palestinian cause until it gains victory. 
  At the same time, we look forward for more sincere and 
constructive efforts by His Excellency President Bill Clinton of 
the United States and his government to complete the peace 
process and arrive at a just, comprehensive, and complete peace 
in the region, and to define the remaining tracks so as to 
arrive at the desired objective. We are convinced that the 
remaining Arab brothers [Syria, Lebanon, Jordan] want peace and 
seek to realize it, and no doubt they will find in the clear and 
encouraging determination of the U.S. President to put an end to 
the state of war in the region, with the help of all parties, a 
sign of a wish for peace and an investment for the current peace 
momentum as well. For our part, our efforts here in the Kingdom 
of Saudi Arabia will continue in all directions to serve this 
objective, whether in cooperation and coordination with his 
excellency the U.S. President and his administration, or with 
the Arab brothers, or with the other states and international 
quarters interested in the cause of peace in the Middle East. 
  Regarding the situation in the Gulf, this country is very 
eager to achieve a tangible cooperation between all the parties 
concerned in sincere and constructive endeavor to remove the 
causes of dispute between the six GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council] 
member states and Iran. The beginning and end of these causes 
lie in the fact that the brothers in Iran should commit 
themselves to observe international conventions and standards 
based on mutual respect and noninterference in the domestic 
affairs of states, and give back the three islands [Lesser Tumb, 
Greater Tumb, and Abu Musa] to the United Arab Emirates. We are 
convinced that such a firm commitment will provide the factors 
of trust required to establish constructive cooperation with 
Iran for the good and interest of all. 
  Concerning the situation in Iraq, the fact that its regime 
continues to cheat on the UN resolutions will prevent any change 
in the regional and international positions to it. The Iraqi 
regime must carry out the UN resolutions in full without 
cheating, and when the current situation in Iraq comes to an 
end, it is expected that the region will witness a stage of 
stability and prosperity, and the Iraqi people will be the first 
to reap its fruit. 
  When we review the current situation in fraternal Yemen, the 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia feels deep regret at the deterioration 
of the situation there. We expressed our frank and fraternal 
position on 5 May, when we urged the parties to the conflict to 
seek arbitration in reason and logic, and to put the interest of 
Yemen and the people of Yemen at the forefront of priorities. 
We have said this and we continue to affirm it because the 
security of Yemen and the stability of the situation there 
interest us before others, and it is in our interest to see the 
situation stable there. 
  Today, we reaffirm that realism in thinking and 
understanding 
between the parties to the conflict are liable to bring the 
elements of security and stability to Yemen, and to spare it 
dangerous wars and complete destruction. 
  Brothers in God, Muslim brothers everywhere. The oil 
markets are living in changeable and unstable conditions, as a 
result of which the producing countries within OPEC, at the fore 
of which is the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, have sustained great 
sacrifices due to the drop in prices during last year, the 
reasons and motives of which are not unseen by those who follow 
up the circumstances of the commodity and the production levels 
inside and outside OPEC. 
  We in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia firmly believe that this 
situation will not serve anybody, on the contrary it will harm 
us all producers and consumers and will be sharply reflected in 
the world economic situation. 
  We do not need to warn against the absence of full 
understanding between the producing countries inside OPEC and 
the producing countries outside it, and also against the limited 
level of coordination and cooperation between the member states 
within the organization, that falls short of the level that 
ensures the interests of all. However, we need to emphasize 
that the time has come to draw up a firm policy and clear 
strategy that will ensure the stability of the commodity and 
spare it the changing political whims and climates and the 
special considerations and circumstances through which some 
countries are passing, which prompts them to pursue practices 
harmful to everybody. It is in the interest of everybody to 
seek the judgement of reason and logic, to consider everybody's 
interests, and agree upon a new basis and criteria that is 
dictated by the realities of the market, the production levels, 
and the world consumption needs of energy and nothing else. 
[passage omitted] 
  O brothers in God; O Muslims everywhere! Almighty God has 
granted us the honor of being able to serve this country, of 
assuming responsibility for the affairs of its loyal people, and 
of being vigilant over their comfort, peace, and security and 
promoting their interests. 
  We praise God the almighty and all-powerful that he has 
enabled us to exploit the resources and potentials of this 
country so that our dear country has achieved its present 
position, to raise the standard of living and of the services 
provided to the sons of our homeland, and to achieve prosperity 
and development, both of which we are proud of. [passage 
omitted] 
  Recently, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has planned extensive 
and serious steps in the fields of organization and 
administration and God has made us successful in issuing the 
basic statute for the system of government, the statute for the 
new Council of Ministers, the statute for the Consultative 
Council and its establishment, and the statute for the regions 
and attached regulations and complementary procedures in order 
to put these statutes into effect and achieve more benefits and 
progress for our people and our nation in the future. 
  The Consultative Council has begun to bear fruit and 
participate in developing the various organizational means in 
our country, and is playing a positive and effective role

  [Text] Jeddah, 23 May, (SPA) -- An authoritative source at 
the Ministry of Health announced today the following: After the 
conclusion of the Hajj rites by the pilgrims of God's holy 
shrine and their departure from Mina to holy Mecca for their 
homebound journey and, after having taken note of the daily 
statements on the number of those who have suffered sun stroke, 
have fallen victim to heat exhaustion, or have died during the 
period between 1 Dhi al- Hijjah 1414 H. and yesterday, Monday, 
12 Dhi al-Hijjah 1414 H, he said: 
  1) The number of cases of sun strokes were 646; sufferers 
were treated immediately. 
  2) The number of those who suffered from heat exhaustion 
were 
5,754; victims were transferred to hospital for treatment. 
  3) The number of deaths caused by old age, heart attacks, 
and 
other causes were 829, including the number of deaths that took 
place during today's stone-throwing ceremony [at Mina], which 
was caused by over crowded conditions. 
  The source concluded his statement by beseeching Almighty 
God 
to bless the souls of the pilgrims who have died as they were 
performing the ordinance of Hajj. May God's mercy be upon their 
souls and may God look upon them as martyrs. God is all-hearing 
and all-answering.

  [Text] Mecca, Saudi Arabia, May 23 (AFP)--Dozens of 
pilgrims were killed in a stampede Monday at the Muslim holy 
site here, witnesses said, as authorities confirmed the incident 
but gave no death toll. 
  The witnesses, who would not be identified, said they did 
not 
know how the tragedy on Monday afternoon occurred. 
  They said pilgrims had been trampled to death and bodies 
littered the site, while religious ceremonies were taking place. 
Saudi security forces were at the scene but ambulances were 
initially barred from access. 
  The incident occurred as the Saudi authorities were 
proclaiming the successful completion of this year's pilgrimage, 
in which more than two million Muslims took part. 
  But a Saudi health ministry statement broadcast by state 
television said later, "a total of 829 people died during the 
pilgrimage season this year, as a result of this afternoon's 
stampede and for other reasons such as heart attacks and old 
age." 
  It also said that 6,400 received hospital treatment as a 
result of sun stroke and fainting. 
  Before news of the stampede, King Fahd had sent a message to 
Pilgrimage Minister Mahmud Bin-Muhammad al-Safar praising the 
"success" of the annual event. 
  The pilgrimage to Mecca, a religious duty at least once on a 
lifetime for all Muslims who can afford it, officially began on 
May 20 this year but pilgrims began arriving several weeks 
beforehand. 
  In July 1990 more than 1,400 people were killed in a 
panic-stricken stampede in a tunnel near here. Most were 
Indonesian or Turkish.

<F P=106> [Report by Faysal Makram, Iqbal 'Abdallah, Shafiq al-Asadi, </F>
and Muhammad 'Allam: "Sanaa Confirms Advance Toward Aden; 
Southerners Repel Attacks"] 
  [Excerpts] Sanaa, Aden, Abu Dhabi, Cairo -- The fighting 
between northern and southern forces in Yemen -- which has 
entered its third week -- expanded and became fiercer yesterday. 
Sanaa confirmed yesterday that its forces were advancing toward 
Aden to tighten the siege around it from three directions. It 
said that the forces have now moved beyond the al-'Anad base. 
While Aden said that southern forces "have dealt crushing 
blows" to northern forces, "compelling them to retreat toward 
Kirsh" (45 km northwest of Aden). [passage omitted] 
  At the security level, a high-level military official in 
Sanaa has told AL-HAYAH that government forces (northern) are 
advancing toward Aden to tighten the military siege around the 
city from three directions: north, east, and west. Government 
forces "have now moved beyond the al-'Anad base having seized it 
and extinguished the fires caused by the rockets fired on the 
base from a 20-km distance until Wednesday night/Thursday 
morning by Socialist Party sources (southern). After combing 
al-'Anad base, government forces have begun to advance toward 
al-Hawtah, capital of Lahij Governorate, where they will join 
other forces which have advanced through al-Habilayn after 
crossing the Socialist forces' fortifications in the southern 
areas of al-Dali' Directorate, which they seized about 10 days 
ago. Meanwhile other forces advanced on this axis yesterday 
toward Aden." 
  The military official added that "government forces on the 
eastern axis are engaged in fierce fighting with Socialist 
forces in the al-'Alam area between Abyan and Aden Governorates. 
They had arrived from Zanjibar (capital of Abyan Governorate) 
from al-'Amaliqah units and other government forces backing them 
on this axis." He pointed out that "a land and air attack on 
government forces in the southeastern fringes of Abyan 
Governorate was repelled when government forces shelled Aden 
airport with rockets in the early hours of yesterday morning. 
The government (northern) Air Force launched air strikes 
against naval ships belonging to the Socialist Party, providing 
a cover for the al-'Amaliqah forces' land attack toward the 
al-'Alam area." 
  On the southeastern axis, the same source confirmed that 
northern forces "are engaged in fighting with the Socialist 
Salah-al-Din Brigade some 25 km from al-'Irqah port." Socialist 
forces on this front "have suffered heavy losses in military 
equipment, and are moving toward Aden." 
  He added that "government forces have since dawn yesterday 
been engaged in fierce fighting with the 'Abbas and Taysir 
Brigade at the approaches to 'Anaq in Shabwah Governorate." He 
confirmed that the city "is about to be captured by government 
forces." 
  Meanwhile, sources close to President Salih have confirmed 
his demand that eight Socialist Party Political Bureau leaders 
be handed over as a condition for a cease-fire, or that they 
leave the country quickly. They are 'Ali Salim al-Bid, Haydar 
al-'Attas, Salih Bin-Husaynun, Yasin Sa'id Nu'man, Haytham Qasim 
Tahir, Salih 'Ubayd Ahmad, Qasim Yahya, Salih Munsir al-Sayli, 
and Muthanna 'Askar. The president excluded from this condition 
Salim Salih Muhammad, assistant secretary general of the 
Socialist Party, and 14 other Socialist Party Political Bureau 
members, most notably Jarallah 'Umar, culture minister; Anis 
Hasan Yahya, head of the Socialist Party parliamentary bloc; 
Fadl Muhsin, fish resources minister; Muhammad Sa'id 'Abdallah, 
housing minister; and Ahmad 'Ali al-Salami, electricity minister. 
  The sources said that President Salih briefed the Arab 
League 
secretary general's two envoys when he met with them before they 
left Sanaa for Cairo three days ago. [passage omitted]

whose names are given in the arrest warrant issued by the public 
prosecutor of the republic on 23 May, a general amnesty shall be 
granted to all the civilian and military men who, under the 
hegemony of the criminal secessionist clique, acted or behaved 
in a manner conflicting with the Constitution and punishable 
under the law. According to this decree, they will enjoy their 
full political and civilian rights and will continue to assume 
their responsibilities in the various places of work and 
production under commitment to constitutional legitimacy. 
  Article 2: Everyone who abides by the constitutional 
legitimacy shall benefit from this amnesty. 
  Article 3: This decree shall be valid as of the date of its 
issuance and shall be published in the official gazette.

<F P=106> ["Text" of "important address" to Yemeni masses on the eve </F>
of 'Id al-Adha by President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, read by 
announcer -- recorded] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate; 
thanks be to God; and prayers and peace for the soul of the last 
prophet and messenger. 
  Brother dear citizens: On this venerable day of faith, in 
which the magnificence of the shining picture of the Islamic 
nation manifests itself, represented in the guests of God 
visiting the holy places and taking up position in common 
worship to the one God on the blessed Mount 'Arafat, and in the 
apex of great rites that almost count as the complete pilgrimage 
to quote Prophet Muhammad, who said that to climb Mount 'Arafat 
amounts to a complete pilgrimage. This is because standing on 
Mount 'Arafat [word indistinct] is an important religous event, 
where the sentiments of all Muslims gravitate [word indistinct] 
the close bond that does not unravel, and that makes us stick 
more firmly to it and believe more in the justice of the 
virtuous Islamic faith. We thank God for his guidance. 
  On the occasion of the advent of the blessed 'Id al-Adha, I 
take pleasure to send my sincere, heartfelt congratulations to 
all members of our people and Arab and Islamic nations, hoping 
that when the occasion next comes round all of us will be in the 
happiest state possible. This 'Id confirms great values of 
sacrifice and self-denial that are today manifest in the heroic 
acts of the courageous and faithful sons of our believing and 
proud people in the Armed Forces and Security Forces as they 
fight battles of sacrifice and self-denial and stand up to 
rebellious and secessionist gangs within the leadership of the 
Yemeni Socialist Party and display the finest examples of 
sacrifice with all courage and chivalry and dedication to the 
sacred duty. To them in particular, I send my warmest greetings 
on the occasion of 'Id al- Adha [word instinct] what they have 
always done in the areas of sacrifice and self-denial and 
standing up to the enemies of the people and the homeland and 
the enemies of principles, ideals, and values. 
  Thanks to them, our people have been able to ward off the 
dangers that were ignited by the rebellious secessionists, 
threatening the homeland's unity and safety. They have 
extinguished the fire of those dangers before they became an 
overall national ordeal, thus bolstering and fortifying the 
people's unity, increasing the firmness of the people's faith in 
democracy, and enhancing faith in the present and future of the 
new Yemen, the Yemen of unity, freedom, and democracy, the Yemen 
of wellbeing, justice, and prosperity. 
  On this occasion, we beseech Almighty God to have bountiful 
mercy on all the martyrs of our people, the martyrs of the 
revolution, unity, and democracy, and to elevate their souls to 
highest ranks among the prophet's companions and martyrs. We 
beseech God to accept the prayers of the pilgrims to holy Mecca, 
to guide our steps, and to lead us along the path that pleases 
Him. God is all-hearing, ready to answer. Many happy returns.

  [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
Presidential Council chairman, yesterday received a letter from 
his brother, Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, leader of the 1 
September revolution in Libya. The letter deals with the 
current developments in our country and Libya's firm, constant 
position that strongly supports Yemeni unity and rejects 
secession under whatever name, since Yemeni unity is a pan-Arab 
gain and an advance step along the path to embody the pan-Arab 
objective of comprehensive Arab unity. 
  The letter expressed the fraternal Libyan people's support 
for their brothers in the Yemeni Republic and their backing 
under the umbrella of unity and democracy. It also dealt with 
issues of interest to both fraternal countries. The letter was 
delivered by brother Sayfawi Yusuf, the charge d'affaires of the 
Libyan Brotherhood Bureau in Sanaa who met with the president 
yesterday. 
  The brother president praised the principled pan-Arab stand 
of the brothers in Libya, led by brother Col. Mu'ammar 
al-Qadhdhafi, who has devoted all of his life to the cause of 
Arab unity and who played a key role in supporting all steps and 
efforts that led to the Yemeni unity and the establishment of 
the Yemeni Republic and supporting the march of unity since it 
was launched on 22 May 1990. 
  The brother president asserted that Yemeni unity is here to 
stay. It will be safeguarded by the Yemeni people and their 
Armed Forces.

  [Text] Brothers Staff Brigadier General 'Abd-Rabbuh Mansur 
Hadi, the defense minister; and Brigadier General 'Abd-al-Malik 
al- Sayyani, the chief of staff, have sent a cable to Lieutenant 
General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the Presidential 
Council. Following is the text: 
  Brother struggler Lt. Gen. 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of 
the Presidential Council and commander in chief of the Armed 
Forces; brother members of the Presidential Council: 
  In the name of your brothers and sons -- the valiant 
fighters, the protectors of the revolution, unity, and 
democracy, who are holding out at all the positions of honor and 
sacrifice across the unified Yemeni state -- we take pleasure in 
extending heartfelt congratulations on the advent of the blessed 
'Id al-Adha and on the occasion of the fourth anniversary of the 
Yemeni merger, whereby our people rehabilitated Yemen's history 
and which embodies their ambitions for a dignified, decent, and 
free life. 
  Our country is going through delicate circumstances as a 
result of secessionists and apostates in the Socialist Party 
leadership sparking off war against our people and the valiant 
members of the Armed Forces. Members of the Armed Forces are 
thus having to cope with the manifold task of protecting unity 
and democracy and consolidating constitutional legality and 
deterring the forces of secession and rebellion that want the 
homeland to lapse into the pre-22 May 1990 era and to wreck the 
unity for which our people have striven for so long and which 
they have come to regard as the noblest and dearest national 
objective for which worthy martyrs have fallen. 
  Your sons and brothers have, over the past two weeks, fought 
the battle of honor and dignity in defense of unity and 
democracy against the remnants of the gang of apostasy and the 
forces of injustice and aggression that have consistently 
plotted against our people's accomplishments to advance personal 
ends that, thanks be to God, have come to nothing. 
  The defenders of the sanctity and every inch of Yemeni 
territory reiterate their genuine loyalty under the fluttering 
banner of the eternal Republic of Yemen. They renew the pledge 
to your dedicated political leadership and to their people that 
they will ever be up to their heavy national responsibilities. 
They will be prepared to sacrifice their souls for Yemen, for 
its pride, stability, and prosperity so that it can take its 
rightful place in the community of nations. We reiterate that 
the Armed Forces in these decisive moments are better prepared 
than ever to protect the country's sovereignty and the gains for 
the immortal Yemeni revolution, most of all unity, democracy, 
and constitutional legality. We give our word to God and the 
people to safeguard these accomplishments against the meddling 
of hatemongers to the last drop of our blood. 
  Once more, please accept our heartfelt congratulations. We 
wish you every success in spearheading the developmental and 
democratic drive. Many happy returns of the 'Id.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, Yemeni minister </F>
of planning and development, by Muhammad al-Aswad of Cairo Voice 
of the Arabs radio in Sanaa; date not given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Al-Aswad] In the name of God, the merciful, the 
compassionate. Brother Arabs, I greet you from Sanaa, the 
capital of sisterly the Republic of Yemen, at the beginning of 
this interview with Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, minister of 
planning and development in sisterly Yemen. His Excellency Dr. 
'Abd-al-Karim al- Iryani, you are welcome on the airwaves of 
Voice of the Arabs. 
  [Al-Iryani] Thank you very much. You are welcome to Sanaa. 
  [Al-Aswad] Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, we begin this 
interview by analyzing the Yemeni political position on the 
secessionist move announced by 'Ali Salim al-Bid in Aden? 
  [Al-Iryani] The Yemeni political position has been expressed 
by the brother chairman of the Presidential Council, who 
stressed that any dealing or sympathy with this secessionist 
move will mean antagonizing 12 or 14 million Yemenis. Also, I 
believe that any dealing with this move will mean a definite 
desire to continue this war. We have heard continuous calls for 
halting this war. Now, any dealing with this move will 
contravene any call for halting the war, for this will mean a 
definite and strong desire to make this war go on. 
  [Al-Aswad] Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, many efforts were 
made to contain the crisis before it exploded on the military 
level. Among these efforts are the efforts of Egypt and 
President Mubarak. Could you brief us on the yet undisclosed 
secrets of these efforts? 
  [Al-Iryani] In fact, among the most important secrets of 
these efforts is what I have said to my brother and colleague, 
'Amr Musa, in Cairo last April. I clearly said to him: Unless 
the teeth of the military on both sides are removed, you cannot 
prevent the war. Our colleagues in Aden refuse to withdraw the 
forces from the former so-called boundaries in accordance with 
Paragraph 4 of Part 1 of the pledge and accord document. If 
they insist on their refusal, I stress to you, brother 'Amr, 
that this will mean they want war. I would like to stress that 
they resorted to war when they came under intolerable pressure 
to withdraw from the former so-called boundaries. I said this 
at the last session of the Council of Ministers I attended in 
April, two weeks before the war. I declared that 
procrastinating the withdrawal of these troops will lead to war. 
I clearly told my brothers and colleagues in the Socialist 
Party inside the conferences room of the Council of Ministers 
that the absence of the defense minister from that session in 
particular was a war decision. I entreated them not to allow 
matters to fall in the hands of those who seek war. 
Regrettably, the appeal fell on deaf ears. Since that day, I 
have not entered the Council of Ministers' conferences room to 
attend a meeting in the presence of my colleagues in the 
Socialist Party. 
  [Al-Aswad] Now that what was feared has taken place, that 
the 
war has broken out, and that the secession has been declared, do 
you envisage a possibility for returning to dialogue and 
resolving the current political crisis in Yemen as a whole 
through dialogue, even by beginning to implement the positive 
aspects of the pledge and accord document? 
  [Al-Iryani] First, let me tell you that secession was a 
positive step as much as it was a negative one. 
  [Al-Aswad] What does this mean? 
  [Al-Iryani] First, it means that 'Ali al-Bid has announced a 
name for a state that has no origin. You know that among the 
basic foundations of a state are land, people, and authority. 
It is an authority similar to the royalists in the 1960s. It 
still has a radio station and [words indistinct] a television, 
but it is an authority of [word indistinct] royalists. 
Congratulations to the greedy ones. Second, he relieved us of 
an intense embarrassment in front of some of our colleagues who 
used to blame us for not giving al-Bid sufficient time. He has 
revealed his true intentions with which he started the crisis. 
  The third point is that he gave the brothers in limited 
areas, particularly Aden, which are under the control of the 
party a chance to say yes to unity and no to secession. 
  The fourth point is that it allowed us to [words 
indistinct]. 
We were fighting for some two weeks, or close to three weeks; 
the armies were fighting in the name of unity. This [words 
indistinct], but today fighting is between the unionist and the 
separatist. This will bring war closer to an end, but on 
condition that no state commits the mistake of recognition. 
  [Al-Aswad] Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim, Yemeni minister of development 
and planning, do you frankly expect international recognition of 
the entity that 'Ali Salim al-Bid is seeking to establish on 
part of the Yemeni territory in the southern and eastern 
governorates? 
  [Al-Iryani] Frankly, I do not expect any recognition by any 
state, unless a fraternal Arab state commits that crime. But if 
Nicaragua recognizes it, congratulations to them then. 
  [Al-Aswad] Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, minister of 
development and planning in fraternal Yemen, one last question: 
London BBC radio says there is a division at the top of the 
power echelon in Sanaa and that you are one of those who differ 
with the presidency in opinion. 
  [Al-Iryani] In fact, London Radio these days reminds me of 
the Near East Radio that transmitted from Cyprus during the Suez 
War. Many listeners may recall how the Near East Radio acted 
during the Suez War. Very regrettably, London Radio is today an 
exact copy. I gave an interview to the English-language Service 
of the London Radio two nights ago. I was asked: You intend to 
enter Aden by force and dropped every political option. I 
interrupted him and said: This is untrue. We are ready to hold 
dialogue and reach agreement with the unionists in the Socialist 
Party. The unionist in the Socialist Party knows what we mean. 
Of course, he distorted my words and said this is evidence of a 
division within the party. But this decision was made by the 
first session of the Joint Meeting on the first day of 'Id 
al-Adha [21 May], that all of us who have connections to the 
foreign media should announce the opening of dialogue with the 
unionists in the Socialist Party. The unionists should announce 
their rejection of [words indistinct]. Therefore, and in answer 
to your question, the door of dialogue is open to whoever says 
no to secession. He who says no to secession in the Socialist 
Party, will be welcome. The door of dialogue is open and 
everything can be discussed under the canopy of one Yemeni 
state, one Yemeni legitimacy, and one Yemeni Army. 
  [Al-Aswad] Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, you have criticized 
the Egyptian declaration. Why? 
  [Al-Iryani] I still have some criticism because talk was on 
northern and southern Yemen. It could be forgivable to use 
northern and southern forces, but to say North Yemen and South 
Yemen is, in my opinion, prohibited. I would also like to say 
that the all world media are saying fighting between the North 
and South. Let me tell you that certain units whose cadre is 
considered to be wholly southern were the spearhead in Mukayris, 
Shabwah, and al-Dali' because they were fighting in familiar 
terrain. The forces whose cadre is northern are less familiar. 
The spearhead on the main battle fronts consisted of forces 
mainly from the southern and eastern governorates. I regret to 
announce that the commander of the Artillery Brigade from Abyan, 
who spearheaded the advance toward Shabwah, was martyred three 
(?days) ago. 
  [Al-Aswad] Brother Arabs, at the end of this interview with 
Dr. 'Abd-Karim al-Iryani, minister of planning and development 
in fraternal Yemen, in his house in Sanaa, we thank you. We 
also thank him and welcome him always on the airwaves of Voice 
of the Arabs. Thank you Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim. 
  [Al-Iryani] Thank you very much and I welcome you once 
again. 
  [Al-Aswad] Thank you dear listeners. This is Muhammad 
al-Aswad from Sanaa.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, </F>
Yemeni minister of planning and development, in Sanaa, by an 
unidentified correspondent in Cairo; date not given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, 
minister of planning in fraternal Yemen, we would like to learn 
about the situation in your country in light of the escalated 
fighting between the north and the south. 
  [Al-Iryani] First, I would like to state that the media, 
which is talking about the struggle between the north and the 
south, does not know the nature of the situation. Nevertheless, 
I will try to answer this question. 
  [Correspondent] In other words, do you agree with me that it 
is a war between brothers? 
  [Al-Iryani] A war between brothers, yes certainly, but not a 
war between the north and the south. The brothers, 
unfortunately, are fighting in one house, in one room. But I 
still claim that it is not a war between the north and the 
south. The latest developments of the situation have been that 
-- and I quote language used by the media -- joint northern and 
southern forces are heading toward Hadhramaut to topple the 
al-Mukalla republic declared by 'Ali Salim al-Bid. Perhaps this 
is an answer to the language used by the media. Joint northern 
and southern forces, specific brigades -- and among these 
brigades, which the media calls southern, are the 'Abbas Brigade 
and the Hunayshan Brigade, as well as some brigades from the 
north -- are all advancing jointly toward Hadhramaut to topple 
the al-Mukalla republic declared by 'Ali Salim al-Bid. These 
are the latest developments in the situation. 
  [Correspondent] Do we understand from this that the northern 
forces have stopped advancing toward Aden? 
  [Al-Iryani] No, no. The situation in Aden is unique and 
needs special consideration. The Aden Governorate has over 
400,000 innocent citizens: women, children, elderly, and men. 
The fighters there number only in the hundreds. We do not want 
these few hundred to be the cause of thousands of Aden 
residents' death. This is why the Aden front needs special 
consideration. Our advance to Hadhramaut is taking place with 
joint forces -- as I said earlier quoting the media, northern 
and southern forces -- to topple the al- Mukalla republic. They 
will start at Saywun and then head toward al-Mukalla. 
  [Correspondent] But so far, the fighting has targeted 
civilians. We have learned that a missile fell on Sanaa 
yesterday and that a number of civilians died in it. 
  [Al-Iryani] First, I wish to confirm that the number of 
deaths in the capital, Sanaa, is three times more than the 
number in Aden Governorate. 
  [Correspondent] Do we understand from this that ... 
  [Al-Iryani interrupting] There is a great deal of 
speculation in the number of deaths in Aden. Not a single 
civilian district of Aden was targeted. 
  [Correspondent] Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim, do we understand from 
what you have just said that there is no intention on the part 
of northern troops to strike at Aden with Scud missiles? 
  [Al-Iryani] I assure you that this will not happen. Three 
missiles with a range shorter than a Scud were fired at Aden 
airport. We cannot shell innocent people in Aden with a 
missile, a cannon, or a tank. The criminal secessionists, 
however, insist on hitting the civilians, particularly in Sanaa, 
so as to give the impression that a civil war is afoot and that 
civilians are paying the price. 
  [Correspondent] We would like you to update us on the 
situation from your side. Do you plan any political moves? We 
know that President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih has sent messages to a 
number of Arab and foreign leaders. 
  [Al-Iryani] Let me tell you that the secessionists have only 
a handful of supporters on the outskirts of the Aden 
Governorate. They have no military power. There are no front 
lines in any part of Yemen, except for the handful of supporters 
who have dug their heels on the outskirts of Aden. 
  [Correspondent] This is the military situation as you see 
it? 
  [Al-Iryani] I assure you that this is the true military 
situation. You journalists used to talk about northern and 
southern troops. There were supposed to be two southern 
brigades and three northern ones. All these brigades are now 
heading to take over Hadhramaut. This means that all the fronts 
have crumbled. There are no military forces in Hadhramaut. I 
assure you, there are no brigades there, because these are the 
brigades that were positioned there in the first place. There 
is no resistance left except for the remnants entrenched on 
Aden's outskirts. As I said, Aden has its special status. 
  [Correspondent] This means that there are no southern forces 
left in Hadhramaut. 
  [Al-Iryani] Correct. These forces withdrew to Shabwah, 
Abyan, and Aden and no longer present a problem. Most of these 
forces are now on the side of the legitimacy. 
  [Correspondent] Does this mean that Aden is no longer a 
military target? 
  [Al-Iryani] As you know, military and political 
considerations are linked. We are giving priority right now to 
political considerations until we see what happens. But its 
elimination as a military target, I think it does not make sense. 
  [Correspondent] Does this mean that dialogue and a political 
solution are possible and that you are ready to seek them? 
  [Al-Iryani] Yes, yes, yes, yes. 
  [Correspondent] Even with the secessionists in the south? 
  [Al-Iryani] Yesterday, the public attorney pressed charges 
against 16 Yemeni Socialist Party members. This decision was 
followed by a declaration of general amnesty. The others 
[southern officials] were called upon to take part in dialogue 
in the framework of the Republic of Yemen and its constitution. 
  [Correspondent] What is your next step in light of the 
international reaction to the secession of the south from Yemen? 
  [Al-Iryani] As we said repeatedly, any dealing or sympathy 
with those secessionists will be considered a hostile act 
against the Yemeni people. 
  [Correspondent] Has it not come to your knowledge that a 
certain country is about to recognize what has been announced as 
southern Yemen? 
  [Al-Iryani] I assure you that such a step has not been 
pondered at all, except by the other wretches in the Republic of 
Somaliland. 
  [Correspondent] Do we understand from this that the Republic 
of Yemen is proposing dialogue and political settlement in place 
of military option? 
  [Al-Iryani] The military option ... [pauses] It is possible 
(?in the city of Aden). As for the other fronts, there is no 
more fighting. 
  [Correspondent] By other fronts, do you mean Hadhramaut? 
  [Al-Iryani] I mean the fronts that saw action, in Abyan, 
Shabwah, and al-Dali'. For the sake of civilians' safety, 
political settlement is an option. 
  [Correspondent] Does this mean that a political solution is 
a 
possibility? 
  [Al-Iryani] Yes, before we are forced to consider the 
military option. 
  [Correspondent] Do you believe that marching on Aden 
involves 
special considerations that are not ... 
  [Al-Iryani, interrupting] Yes, and this is what I told you 
in 
the beginning of this interview. But these special 
considerations are not going to last forever. As you know, 
military options are not forever. Hours make a difference. 
  [Correspondent] Why have you taken this position at this 
very 
moment? 
  [Al-Iryani] Because we do not want... [pauses] because it is 
a populated area, as I told you. The rest of the areas that saw 
military clashes were quite distant from populated areas. 
  [Correspondent] We thought, if you excuse me, that a 
military 
option was your first priority. Now, it seems that you are 
talking about a political option and dialogue. 
  [Al-Iryani] It is not true that anyone in Sanaa has ever 
rejected political dialogue.

  [Text] The Higher Council of the Yemeni Reform Grouping 
has issued the following statement. 
  In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. Praise 
be to God who says: There is the type of man whose speech about 
this world's life may dazzle thee, and he calls God to witness 
about what is in his heart, yet is he the most contentious of 
enemies. When he turns his back, his aim everywhere is to 
spread mischief through the earth and destroy crops and cattle. 
But God loveth not mischief. When it is said to him, 'Fear 
God,' he is led by arrogance to more crime. Enough for him is 
Hell, an evil bed indeed to lie on. [Koranic verse] 
  God's peace and blessing be upon the seal of prophets and 
messengers, our Lord Muhammad, and on his family and companions. 
  Esteemed Yemeni people all over unified Yemen: The sons of 
Yemen are now celebrating the blessed 'Id al-Adha and the fourth 
anniversary of the establishment of the unity state and the 
proclamation of the Yemeni Republic on 22 May 1990. On that 
day, the Yemenis realized their dream and great objective for 
which they had offered huge sacrifices until God ordained its 
realization by the merger of the two parts of Yemen and 
reuniting the one Yemeni family to start building a unified 
homeland, having removed all forms of oppression, despotism, 
chaos, and displacement and freed the homeland from the 
captivity of the atheist, destructive communist ideas. Those 
ideas had been imposed by evil elements on a precious and dear 
part of our beloved Yemeni land for quarter of a century, during 
which our people suffered humiliation and disgrace. 
  Then the dawn of unity broke, heralding an end to a dark 
night. Thus, the Yemenis enjoyed the dividends of unity under a 
political regime that is based on the principles of shura, 
democracy, and political pluralism. 
  While the Yemeni people were celebrating the blessed 'Id 
al-Adha and the fourth anniversary of the unity, the elements of 
apostasy and secession insisted on invoking the hateful past and 
setting the clock back to the time of division and fragmentation 
of the homeland through al-Bid's secessionist announcement. 
  This announcement has clearly revealed the truth about 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid and his clique and exposed their secessionist bent 
and their outright hostility to the people's unity, stability, 
and progress. 
  The al-Bid's secessionist announcement has proven beyond any 
shadow of a doubt the truthfulness of the pronouncements of the 
state's legitimate institutions and bodies to everybody at home 
and abroad that the crisis has been, all along, a confrontation 
between constitutional, popular, and unionist legitimacy and a 
rebellious, secessionist clique. Consequently, this places all 
the segments of society--parties, organizations, and masses, 
including the unionists in the Socialist Party--before their 
true responsibilities toward this heretic announcement and to 
stand firmly behind the national, unionist ranks, without any 
hesitation, leniency, procrastination, or excuses. 
  Having examined this traitorous announcement with a high 
sense of national responsibility; and out of its concern about 
the higher interests of the sons of unified Yemen, the Higher 
Council of the Yemeni Reform Grouping condemns and rejects this 
traitorous announcement that has no legitimacy whatsoever and no 
constitutional or legal foundation. This announcement is 
totally null and is deemed high treason and a violation of the 
Constitution and an infringement on the country's sovereignty, 
stability, unity, and the higher interest of the Yemeni people. 
In addition, the announcement was made by someone who does not 
have the right to issue such an announcement and who has no 
legitimacy. He is also on the run and his whereabouts is 
unknown because he is being pursued by the legitimate 
authorities. 
  Based on this, confronting this announcement is a legitimate 
national duty and a religious duty to all the sons of the people 
and the legitimate institutions. These institutions are 
responsible for discharging their duties. They bear 
responsibility for protecting the territory of the Yemeni 
Republic and safeguarding its unity. These institutions are 
carrying out these important duties, along with the sons of the 
people. It is the cause of the entire homeland and all the 
people. 
  The Higher Council of the Yemeni Reform Grouping extends its 
thanks and appreciation for all the brotherly and friendly 
countries that support Yemeni unity, since this unity is a major 
factor of stability in this vital region in which most countries 
have major interests, such as resources and waterways. 
  We are certain that these countries will not pay attention 
to 
the secessionist announcement of al-Bid and his gang, since 
these countries must realize that this act is hostile to the 
Yemeni people and that it is a serious precedent that will 
extend to most fraternal and other countries. 
  We wonder: What hope will remain for our Arab nation to 
achieve unity when it sees a unified people being fragmented? 
  We also denounce some media characterization of what is 
happening in Yemen as something between north and south, when it 
is, in reality, between the authority of a state that is member 
of all Arab and world organizations and an abominable clique 
that thinks its selfish interests require secession. 
  We think the defense of Yemeni unity is an Arab and Islamic 
responsibility first and then a Yemeni responsibility. We are 
confident, therefore, that all fraternal and friendly nations 
will side with the one, unified Yemeni people and their will and 
stability and elected constitutional institutions. 
  We appeal to our unyielding people to side with the 
legitimate authority and its Armed Forces and to be one rank in 
this situation and remain vigilant until victory is complete, 
God willing, by destroying the secessionist clique. On that 
day, shall the believers rejoice, with the help of God. He 
gives victory to whom He will, and He is exalted in might, most 
merciful. It is the promise of God. Never does God fail from 
His promise, but most men know not. [Koranic verse] 
  Issued by the Higher Council of the Yemeni Reform Grouping 
on 
12 Dhu al-Hijjah, 1414 Hegira, corresponding to 23 May 1994

  [Text] A number of the members of the parliamentary bloc 
representing the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] have issued a 
statement in which they reiterated their strong and firm 
adherence to Yemeni unity as the fate of our people, stressing 
that no individual, group, or political force can encroach on 
this unity. They condemned the sedition ignited by the 
rebellious gang of apostasy in the YSP leadership among the sons 
of the one people. The members of the YSP parliamentary bloc 
also denounced the secession declaration, affirming its 
political illegitimacy. They considered this declaration a 
crime and high treason against our Yemeni people. 
  The YSP parliamentary bloc reiterated their adherence to 
constitutional legitimacy based on the results of the 
parliamentary elections held on 27 April 1993.

  [Text] The General People's Congress General Committee 
[GPCGC] has held an emergency meeting under GPC Assistant 
Secretary General 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani at the end of 
which it issued the following statement: 
  Our Yemeni people and the Arab and Islamic nation were 
distressed when the gang of apostasy and secession in the Yemeni 
Socialist Party [YSP] under 'Ali Salim al-Bid issued its 
ill-fated secessionist declaration. 
  The GPCGC vehemently condemns this treasonous, foolhardy, 
and 
rash action and views al-Bid's secessionist declaration only two 
hours after the implementation of the decision by the joint 
meeting of the Council of Ministers and the Speakership of the 
House of Representatives to halt all military operations as 
another scandal by this deviationist gang, and as the gloomy 
end, and the resounding collapse of the last of its 
fragmentation and partitioning illusions and dreams. This is 
because it flagrantly deviated from national consensus, the 
popular will, and from the deeply-rooted ideological, 
historical, and national constants of our people, and because it 
became involved in the conspiracy to fragment the homeland's 
unity and engage the country in sectarian, provincial, and 
tribal disputes. 
  While condemning and strongly rejecting this criminal 
action, 
the GPCGC supports and blesses all the unity steps, the 
courageous sovereign decisions, and the responsible historic and 
national stands that were adopted by the leaders of the higher 
constitutional bodies, with at their head brother Lieutenant 
General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the Presidential 
Council and supreme commander of the Armed Forces. At the same 
time, it emphasizies to our Armed Forces the need to tighten the 
siege on the dens of this gang, to pursue its corrupt symbols, 
to stalk them wherever they may be, and to expeditiously arrest 
them and bring them to trial so that they may receive the just 
punishment for all the atrocities and the reprehensible fascist 
crimes they have committed against our people and homeland. 
  The GPCGC highly values the victories and the great heroic 
feats the sons of our Armed Forces and Public Security daily 
record and which they baptize with costly blood in all the 
locations of honor and dignity in defense of unity, and to 
protect the democratic achievements and the elected legitimate 
institutions. The GPCGC would like here to note its great 
appreciation of all the honest soldiers and officers of unity 
who were misled by the gang of apostasy and secession but who, 
after becoming aware of the reality of the vile conspiracy, 
rushed to join the forces of unity and constitutional 
legitimacy, refusing to obey the orders of this isolationist and 
renegade gang within the YSP. 
  The GPCGC emphasizes that it is still confident that the 
unity leaders within the YSP are capable of confronting the 
secessionist trend within the party, of liquidating it, and of 
clearly supporting the unity state and its institutions. The 
GPCGC also urges all our people with their national and social 
forces, their political parties and organizations, their popular 
organizations, and their trade unions to stand as one rank in 
support of unity and to safeguard democracy and constitutional 
legitimacy and all the civilized achievements of our people. It 
also calls for mobilizing our masses potential and our 
homeland's resources to confront the schemes of this unjust and 
criminal gang and protect the security, stability, and 
independence of the homeland. 
  The GPCGC praises all the fraternal stands and sincere 
sentiments that many of our Arab brothers and friends in the 
world have expressed when they reiterated their support for the 
unity of our people and for constitutional legitimacy, and their 
concern not to interfere in Yemen's domestic affairs. From 
this premise, the GPCGC warns against any contact or dealings 
with this gang and views the recognition of this fictitious and 
secessionist entity by any fraternal or friendly country as an 
enmical act against our people, an infringement on their 
sovereignty and independence, and a blatant and rejected 
interference in their domestic affairs. 
  The GPCGC is confident of our masses ability, the capability 
of our Armed Forces, the alertness of our security organs, and 
the cohesion of our national ranks to score decisive victory on 
all the secessionist agents to obey God's saying: And fight 
them on until there is no more tumult or oppression, and there 
prevails justice and faith in God. 
  Issued by the General People's Congress General Committee, 
Sanaa, 23 May 1994

  [Text] The General Secretariat of the Liberation Front 
Party has cabled Presidential Council Chairman Lieutenant 
General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and members of the council, the 
speaker and members of the House of Representatives Speakership 
Council, and the Cabinet, to denounce the secession declared by 
the war criminal and traitor al-Bid and his clique. The message 
dubbed the move a grievous crime and high treason as well as 
being in clear violation of the popularly-endorsed constitution. 
The secession was also described as a brazen deviation from the 
aims and principles of the Yemeni revolution for which droves of 
martyrs have fallen. This criminal action, the cable read, is 
the latest in a series of acts of sabotage, intrigues, and 
treason typical of the secessionist circle in the Socialist 
Party.

  [Text] The Yemeni Revolutionary Democratic Party [RDP] has 
condemned al-Bid's secession declaration. The party said in a 
statement that it is considered a blatant violation of the 
Constitution of our Republic of Yemen and the legitimacy 
announced on 27 April 1993. The statement notes the RDP's 
rejection of all calls for secession and its support for and 
call on the forces of constitutional legitimacy not to be 
lenient with this rancorous separatist clique. The party said 
that its support for the forces of constitutional legitimacy 
stems from the party's adherence to Yemeni unity, which is 
considered the result of the efforts and struggle of all honest 
Yemeni strugglers. The party stressed that its stand is firm 
and clear in terms of safeguarding the national constants, 
particularly unity, democracy, and the achievements of the 16 
September and 24 October revolutions. 
  The RDP's statement urges brothers and friends to stand at 
the side of the legitimate leadership to preserve these 
achievements, particularly Yemeni unity. The statement notes 
that al-Bid's criminal attempts to destroy Aden and some 
southern and eastern governorates are a continuation of the 
destruction inflicted on brave Aden in the January events 
[reference to 13 January 1986] to satisfy his destructive whims 
and those of his clique. 
  The statement urges all national and political forces and 
our 
masses to stand at the side of constitutional legitimacy and its 
leadership and to render all support for this leadership. 
  This was issued by the Revolutionary Democratic Party.

  [Text] The U.S. State Department yesterday denounced 
al-Bid's secessionist announcement and called for political 
dialogue. 
  According to AFP, State Department Spokesman Michael McCurry 
said the United States will not reply to al-Bid's Saturday 
announcement as it does not consider such basic issues can be 
decided while battles are continuing. The spokesman added that 
the immediate result of the secession announcement will be that 
of perpetuating battles and increasing the number of victims and 
the suffering of civilians.

<F P=106> [Report by Lutfi Shatarah: "Al-Jawi: The Fighting in Yemen </F>
is a Belated Dowry for the Preservation of Unity"] 
  [Excerpt] London -- Yemeni political sources do not rule 
out the possibility that the next 24 hours will witness some 
political developments which might overturn the current military 
balance between the northerners and the southerners. The 
sources did not disclose details of the discussions at the 
emergency meeting of the Political Bureau of the Yemeni 
Socialist Party [YSP] which was held the day before yesterday 
and paved the way for yesterday's meeting, but they expected 
important decisions to be made that would strengthen the 
steadfastness of the southern forces on all fronts to halt the 
advance of the northern forces and prevent them from controlling 
the main roads leading to Aden. 
  'Umar al-Jawi, secretary general of the opposition's Yemeni 
Unionist Grouping, who supports the YSP's position, however, 
dismissed the claim that the Higher Salvation Council announced 
in Aden three days ago was a government substitute in the south. 
He reaffirmed his support for the preservation of Yemen's unity 
despite the deepening military crisis. 
  In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, al-Jawi said that the 
opposition urged the rest of the political parties to support 
the initiative which aims at stopping the war and "rescuing the 
country from the daily pools of blood." 
  He added that "the signatories to the agreement seek to 
impose a broad political reconciliation between all the 
conflicting sides, parties, and rivals at home and abroad." 
  He emphasized that the opposition is capable of achieving 
that "despite the terrible artillery shelling, explosions, and 
killing." He said: "We will endeavor to convince the General 
People's Congress [GPC], which is led by President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih, and the Yemeni Reform Grouping [YRG], which is 
led by House of Representative Speaker Shaykh 'Abdallah 
Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar; but if they reject this initiative, they 
would clearly be making a mistake and their aim would be to 
continue the war." 
  Al-Jawi reaffirmed that "there is no longer north and south, 
but a united Yemen, and those who promote secessionist talk in 
fact want to abort the plan for the rescue of the homeland." 
  Referring to the formation of the Higher Salvation Council, 
he said that "branch councils will be formed anywhere in Yemen 
where these parties have a presence, and the participating 
parties will comply with the same agreement and with the 
resolutions and directives issued by the Higher Council and 
based on the Pledge and Accord Document." 
  He saw the grinding battles between the northerners and 
southerners in Yemen as "the belated dowry for unity we had 
expected, but it is by no means a divorce. It is a 
reconstruction of unity." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with former south Yemeni President 'Ali </F>
Nasir Muhammad, in Damascus, by Shadiyah Riyad, in Cairo, "a 
short time ago" -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Riyad] Mr. 'Ali Nasir Muhammad, former south 
Yemeni president, on the fourth anniversary of the Yemeni union, 
the Yemeni brothers are going through a bitter conflict and 
fierce battles during which each side is trying to destroy the 
other. Why did they unite and then fight each other and 
separate? 
  [Muhammad] First, I wish to congratulate the fraternal 
Egyptian people, our Yemeni people, and the people of our Arab 
and Islamic nation on the blessed 'Id al-Adha. It pains me that 
this celebration should come amid secession and domestic strife 
in Yemen. It is true that the union is four years old. On this 
glorious occasion we were supposed to offer achievements to the 
Yemeni people, who made sacrifices for the sake of unity, 
instead of giving them this separation and infighting. [passage 
omitted] 
  Obviously, some mistakes were made during the union 
experience. When the union was established power was shared by 
two parties. Later during the transitional period, agreed upon 
in 1990, power was shared by three parties in contradiction to 
the united country's Constitution. Furthermore, no attention 
was paid to the public's concerns, affairs, and aspirations. 
The people pinned high hopes on the union, which was expected 
to end a painful chapter, and to attain their great aims of 
development and prosperity. No attention was paid to the 
people's quality of life, security, stability, and economic 
development. No efforts were made to enhance the unified 
country's status. No attention was paid to the question of 
security, stability, and national unity. No attention was paid 
to the issue of regional security and stability. 
  Naturally, I cautioned against such negative attitudes and 
errors from the start. I alerted Yemen's political leaders to 
this fact and the serious consequences and dangers of the 
negative attitudes and errors made during the transitional 
period and afterward. These errors should have been avoided by 
drawing up a strategic plan of what the unified state wished to 
accomplish. I stressed more than once that the unified state 
must have a strategic perspective of the country's future. 
  Late last year I warned of the danger of domestic strife and 
separatism unless institutions and commands were unified. I 
urged that an understanding be reached among the political 
leaders and between the leaders of the General People's Congress 
and the Yemeni Socialist Party. No attention was paid to this 
and the leadership was divided between Sanaa and Aden. The two 
sides subsequently engaged in media campaigns. This media 
escalation--added to other conflicts, quarrels, and 
assassinations--finally caused the situation to erupt. [passage 
omitted]

Presidential Council member Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani 
visited the heroes of the battle in defense of unity in some of

axes as a result of their heroic confrontation of the forces of 
apostasy and secession. 
  The brother Presidential Council member visited the military 
hospital in Sanaa, the al-Thawrah General Hospital, and the 
al-Jumhuri Training Hospital. He also visited the ward 
allocated for Somali refugees. 
  While visiting the patients, Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani 
conveyed to them greetings from the Presidential Council 
chairman and supreme commander of the Armed Forces and the 
members of the Presidential Council, and their wishes for speedy 
recovery. He also thanked the Health Ministry, the military 
medical services, and the doctors.

  [Text] London, Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- An Adeni citizen 
who did not wish to be named has stated that the Jordanian 
authorities have turned back a large number of Yemeni 
passengers, including many women and children, who arrived in 
Amman via YEMDA Airlines from Aden the day before yesterday. 
Officials at Queen 'Alya' international airport said that their 
decision to deny the Yemeni citizens entry was made "on the 
instructions of higher authorities." He said that "that was 
clear partiality in favor of Sanaa." 
  Eyewitnesses at the airport said that the YEMDA office 
director confirmed to the Jordanian passport authorities that 
the Yemeni nationals had return tickets and had guarantees from 
the company for a week's stay in Jordan, but the authorities 
rejected that. YEMDA sources in Amman confirmed this and said 
that the passengers returned to Aden after being denied access 
to the transit area from where they could have continued their 
trip to Damascus. 
  A responsible south Yemeni source has stated that the 
Jordanian authorities acted in that way, and also turned back 
Colonel Naji 'Ali Naji, director of the Yemeni defense 
minister's office and member of the Joint Military Committee who 
had arrived in Amman for treatment, but at the same time they 
sent six planeloads of medical aid to Sanaa, thereby indicating 
alignment with the northern leadership in the current conflict 
in Yemen.

  [Text] A military source at the command of the Armed Forces 
of the Democratic Republic of Yemen has ridiculed a statement 
issued by a so-called responsible source at the Transport 
Ministry and broadcast by Sanaa radio this evening. The source 
stressed that the al-Ahmar gang is now in a difficult military 
position because it is incapable of threatening any of the air 
or sea ports of the Democratic Republic of Yemen. He confirmed 
that the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Yemen are in 
total control of all the harbors and airports in this Republic 
and that they can fully guarantee the security and safety of 
these harbors and airports and provide the necessary services 
for ships and aircraft which call there. 
  The military source commented on the statement by a 
responsible source at the Transport Ministry to the effect that 
the Sanaa government is not responsible for damage or losses 
that might occur to any foreign company. The military source 
said that the government led by the al-Ahmar gang is no more 
than a smuggling and terrorist gang. It cannot ensure the 
safety of any foreign company just as it is incapable of 
protecting the security of the country and its citizens. The 
source concluded by saying there are a number of companies and 
individuals who have been subjected to looting, plundering, 
assassination, and kidnapping before the eyes and ears of the 
security forces of that corrupt authority.

  [Text] Out of our concern for the lives of the misled and 
helpless pilots and those who are under pressure, and out of our 
concern for the safety of the remaining warplanes that are still 
being manipulated by the rebellious, apostate, and secessionist 
gang--being state-owned planes whose prices have been paid by 
the people--we call on all those pilots not to obey the orders 
issued to them by the rebellious, secessionist gang and to fly 
their planes to any airport under the control of the legitimate 
authority to ask for landing permission and to join their 
brothers in the Air Force. They should be confident that they 
will receive the same treatment that their brothers are 
receiving in terms of rights and duties. It is better for them 
to be at the side of the people, unity, and constitutional 
legitimacy so that they will not be filled with regret after it 
is useless to be so.

  [Text] Diplomatic sources in London were quoted today as 
saying that north Yemen is massing its troops to launch a major 
offensive against Aden. 
  Reports say fierce fighting is now taking place between the 
northern and southern forces to control the oil-rich southern 
governorate of Shabwah. 
  Though Aden denied the fall of Shabwah's capital 'Ataq to 
the 
northern forces, northern officials said their forces took 
control of the 'Ataq military base. They added that Shabwah 
Governorate, including all its military installations, is now 
under Sanaa's control. 
  Despite appeals by several Arab leaders to Yemneni leaders 
to 
stop the fighting, Sanaa asserted that the continuation of war 
is now inevitable.

  [Text] Clashes in Yemen today took place mainly in the 
oil-rich governorate of Shabwah. Foreign correspondents who 
visited al-Mukalla area in Hadhramaut said the southern forces 
are reinforcing their positions in Shabwah and that military 
aircraft are flying over the governorate, parts of which the 
northern forces claimed earlier they had captured. Civilians in 
Hadhramaut have been called up to assist the forces in Shabwah. 
  Meanwhile, political sources in Sanna say President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih is working on achieving swift military gains to 
pressure, to the greatest possible degree, the south should a 
cease-fire be reached.

  [Text] A responsible source at the Defense Ministry has 
stated the following: 
  With support and success granted by Almighty God to the 
soldiers of right--the soldiers protecting unity and freedom and 
safeguarding democracy and constitutional legitimacy--and under 
the growing high morale of the glorious brave fighters in the 
valiant Armed Forces units and their increasing confidence in 
their combat capability and high efficiency in the decisive 
confrontation of the gangs of apostasy and secession in the 
Yemeni Socialist Party in the various axes and sectors, the 
forces of unity and protection of constitutional legitimacy have 
pursued their implementation of all combat missions in the 
battlefields, liquidating the secessionist pockets and dens and 
inflicting large losses in the weapons, vehicles, and equipment 
of the gangs of the mutinous secessionist forces. Our forces 
seized large quantities of military hardware at the Lahij-Abyan 
axis. Combat and combing operations also achieved great 
accomplishments at the Shabwah axis. The forces of unity and 
protection of constitutional legitimacy purged a number of 
subversive pockets in the Shabwah Governorate and seized two 
Sukhoi planes at 'Ataq airport, in addition to a number of tanks 
and artillery pieces and diverse military hardware. 
  The Faysal Rashid Brigade for air defense with missiles 
joined the forces of unity and protection of constitutional 
legitimacy with all its commanders, personnel, and military 
hardware in an awe-inspiring situation stressing the faith of 
all Yemenis in their unity and national loyalty to the 
constitutional legitimacy. The Armed Forces units, the forces of 
unity and protection of constitutional legitimacy, which were 
advancing from al-Dali'ah and al-Mahfid at the Abyan axis, 
converged with and joined the forces of unity and protection of 
constitutional legitimacy in control of the Shabwah Governorate. 
This reinforced the stable situation at this axis.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] In Shabwah Governorate, our 
Armed Forces have continued, with the effective and decisive 
support of our Air Force, their determined battle against the 
hostile forces on whom they have inflicted strong blows. The 
masses effectively support the Armed Forces in that brave 
governorate which Sanaa claims to control. It is completely 
ridiculous for the al-Ahmar gang in Sanaa to claim that it shot 
down one of our fighter planes in Shabwah, just as it claimed 
yesterday that it downed a plane in Abyan. Perhaps tomorrow, it 
will claim it has shot down another plane in Hadramawt or 
al-Mahrah. 
  This is in keeping with its particular misleading style of 
lies and deception. Our brave Armed Forces, which are engaged 
in ferocious defensive battles for the 27th successive day 
against the al-Ahmar forces which planned to seize the southern 
and eastern governorates within a few hours or in a day or two 
at the most, are still quite capable today. The defense forces 
of the Democratic Republic of Yemen, with their unbending 
strength, have the capacity to cleanse our pure territory from 
the filth of the al-Ahmar family and their clique and to teach 
this gang of warfare, terrorism, and criminality a deserving 
lesson. Many a small group has overwhelmed a bigger one 
[Koran], with God's will.

the growing high morale of the glorious brave fighters in the

battlefields, liquidating the secessionist pockets and dens and 
inflicting huge losses in the weaponry, vehicles, and equipment 
of the gangs of the mutinous secessionist forces. [passage 
omitted contained in referent item] 
  Moreover, the heroic and courageous hawks of the air in the 
forces of both unity and protection of the constitutional 
legitimacy carried out with precise and high efficiency and with 
devastating blows the missions assigned to them in a number of 
sectors where the gangs of rebellion and secession showed some 
resistance. 
  On various axes, the units of our Armed Forces are still 
receiving officers, noncommissioned officers [NCO's], and 
soldiers joining the ranks of the forces of unity and protection 
of constitutional legitimacy and declaring their condemnation of 
the secessionist and rebellious gang which revealed its blatant 
and destructive hostility to the people, the homeland, and 
Yemen's present and future. 
  These officers, NCO's, and soldiers also stressed their 
principled and courageous standing in the trench of the solid 
defense of unity and of protecting both the constitutional 
legitimacy and all the achievements and gains of the Republic of 
Yemen. 
  The forces of both unity and the legitimate and 
constitutional democracy continue to carry out their missions in 
terms of chasing the enemies of both the people and their 
unity--the despots of apostasy and secession as well as the 
gangs mortgaged to their inevitable destiny. In the name of 
God, the merciful, the compassionate: If ye will help (the 
cause) of God, He will help you, and plant your feet firmly.

justify its criminal action of directing missiles on Aden, which 
killed tens of women, children, and old men, the al-Ahmar gang 
media have announced that a missile was fired on Sanaa this 
evening. The Defense Ministry in the Democratic Republic of

  [Text] The Command of the Defense Ministry has announced 
the following: 
  In a misleading attempt to justify the atrocious and 
criminal 
acts embarked upon by the separatist al-Ahmar gang and the 
terrorist forces in Sanaa who launched rockets against peaceful 
citizens in Aden's civilian quarters which resulted in atrocious 
massacres of which scores of people -- children, women, and the 
elderly -- were victims, the north's news media have announced 
that a rocket was launched against Sanaa this evening [as 
heard]. They fabricated these explosions as they have become 
accustomed to fabricating many things to counter their own cheap 
acts and activities. 
  The Ministry of Defense in the Democratic Republic of Yemen 
categorically denies any responsibility for such an act. 
Citizens are not a target for any military action. It now 
appears that this gang is no longer able to do anything except 
to direct destruction against every house in Yemen. This is 
because it sparked off the war against the people. 
  The Ministry of Defense in Aden warns against such criminal 
acts and misleading justifications. The lives of the citizens 
will not be as cheap as the advocates of war and crime believe. 
They have plunged thousands of people, even minor ones, into a 
dirty war which does not serve anybody except their narrow and 
selfish interests.

  [Text] A military source has stated the following: Acting 
treacherously and cowardly, the gang of apostasy and secession 
in the Socialist Party leadership yesterday evening perpetrated 
a new heinous crime against the innocent citizens and civilians 
in Sanaa and other cities. At 2040 [1740 GMT], the spiteful, 
secessionist gang fired a missile at a densely-populated 
residential area in Sanaa, inflicting large losses on the 
citizens and their houses and property. These losses have not 
yet been counted. 
  This cowardly and treacherous action reveals the black, 
hidden grudge this criminal gang harbors against the sons of our 
people, who, along with the heroes of our brave Armed Forces, 
the forces of unity and legitimacy, are valiantly and firmly 
confronting and foiling their criminal secessionist scheme 
against the homeland and its unity and democratic march. The 
source stressed that the cowardly criminals will not escape 
punishment and both the people and the Armed Forces will inflict 
just punishment on them.

  [Text] Presidential Council member brother 'Abd-al-'Aziz 
'Abd-al-Ghani this morning visited the site hit by a missile 
fired yesterday evening by the gang of apostasy and secession. 
The missile fell in a neighborhood of Sanaa, killing or 
wounding a number of civilians and destroying a number of 
inhabited houses. 
  'Abd-al-Ghani was accompanied by brothers Najib Ghanim, the 
minister of public health; Husayn [surname indistinct], the 
mayor of Sanaa; Mutahhar Zaki, under secretary at the Ministry 
of Information; and Dr. Ahmad Makki, under secretary at the 
Ministry of Public Health. 
  The Presidential Council member and his companions were 
briefed on the material and human losses inflicted by the 
missile. They expressed their vigorous condemnation of this 
criminal attack that targeted defenseless civilians and their 
property. 
  He told the local, Arab, and world media that the Yemeni 
people will reply to these criminal acts, and will not show 
patience toward the secessionist move. 
  The brother Presidential Council member and his companions 
then visited the wounded at the Republican Hospital and 
inspected the structural damage to the hospital itself, 
including operating rooms. 
  Brother 'Abd-al-Ghani regretted the consequences of this 
criminal act that targeted a humanitarian facility in the 
capital. He later visited the General Revolution Hospital and 
called on the victims of the attack. 
  We beseech God the almighty to speed up their recovery. 
  The Ministry of Public Health directed that the patients be 
afforded all the necessary medical and other services.

<F P=106> ["Military communique No. 25" issued by the Armed Forces </F>
Command of the Democratic Republic of Yemen; place and date not 
given] 
  [Text] For the 27th consecutive day our brave armed forces 
have continued their heroic resistance and legendary 
steadfastness against the forces of invasion and aggression 
belonging to the adventurous and bloody gang of al-Ahmar. 
  Today, the combat operations of our forces were marked not 
only by firm and strong defense but by inflicting crushing blows 
against the hostile forces on all the battlefronts. Today, our 
forces inflicted killing blows against the invading forces in 
Abyan, where our fighter planes piloted by the courageous Air 
Eagles, defenders of the Democratic Republic of Yemen, 
successfully attacked the positions of the hostile forces and 
inflicted crushing blows against their supply lines. The rest 
of our fighters continued to inflict more human and material 
losses on the enemy ranks, estimated at hundreds of dead and 
wounded. A large number of military machines and equipment was 
destroyed. 
  In the al-Anad Karish zone, our armed forces won great 
victories and managed not only to regain control over this zone 
but inflicted on the hostile forces heavy human and material 
losses. They forced these forces to retreat, with rising 
numbers of officers and men continuing to surrender to our 
forces.

  [Text] A source in the Armed Forces Command has ridiculed 
the statement put out by a responsible source in the Transport 
Ministry broadcast by Sanaa radio this evening. The source said 
the al-Ahmar gang are in a difficult position now and are 
accordingly incapable of threatening Democratic Republic of 
Yemen [DRY] sea ports and airports. The DRY Armed Forces are in 
total control of all the Republic's sea ports and airports, and 
can fully guarantee the security of these seaports and airports 
and all the services they supply to all ships and aircraft.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Excerpts] At last, the secessionist gang fled Aden, 
thinking that it has left behind it citizens and soldiers as a 
sacrifice for its salvation from the people's grip. However, 
the citizens in Aden, and in all adjacent villages and towns, 
should know that the army of unity does not target citizens and 
that citizens will not be harmed. This is because the forces of 
unity protect unity and care for the safety of citizens, who are 
the objective of unity and whose happiness is sought. 
  Likewise, misled soldiers and officers should know they will 
receive much appreciation and respect once they join the forces 
of legitimacy and stand with them in the trench to defend unity. 
  Yes, everyone knows this. It has been proven by experience 
and events. It was confirmed by previous cases in al-Dali', 
[word indistinct], Shabwah, Abyan, Lahij, Bayhan, and other 
places. Citizens were safe and enjoyed care and respect. 
  Every soldier and officer who joined legitimacy enjoyed the 
care and appreciation of all commanders in the forces of 
legitimacy and all the noncommissioned officers, officers, and 
soldiers of the army of unity. This is because they are 
brothers in arms, comrades in struggle, the shield of the 
homeland, and the protectors of Yemen. The entire Armed Forces 
should remain as such, regardless of the attempts made by the 
enemies of Yemen. 
  Thus, we can say that the citizens who welcomed and 
cooperated with the forces of legitimacy, as well as the 
officers, soldiers, and noncommissioned officers who joined 
these forces, have infused new blood into the legitimate forces. 
They have made an important contribution to their advance and 
their victories. Hence, it is clear to everyone that the gang 
of secession and apostasy, which left behind citizens, soldiers, 
and officers as a sacrifice for its salvation from the people's 
wrath, is demonstrating futile thinking and false delusions. 
This is because the people's grip will continue to chase the 
gang wherever it goes, follow it into any den in which it hides, 
and remove it from any cave to which it may resort. [passage 
omitted] 
  Once again we say: Blessed be the steps of the forces of 
unity pounding the last strongholds of apostasy. Blessed be the 
hands of the armies of legitimacy uprooting the dens of 
secessionists. Welcome to the sons of the Armed Forces who were 
misled by the renegade ones. Welcome to the brothers joining 
the Armed Forces and the unionists who are biased toward both 
the trench of legitimacy and the forces of the people and unity. 
Peace to all citizens in Aden and in all the villages and towns 
lying on the road of the victorious and trustworthy unionist 
march. 
  These citizens will be safe as long as they support justice 
and legitimacy. They will also be dignified and respected 
everywhere and always, especially since they are the objective 
and [word indistinct] of unity. Unity was achieved for them and 
with their support. This unity will remain. It is for the sake 
of these citizens and for their pride that the forces of unity 
are marching against the gangs of apostasy. It is also for the 
salvation of these citizens that the struggle is continuing 
against the gangs of secession. Let the citizen be confident of 
victory [words indistinct] safety. This is because the people's 
forces are for the people and for their protection. The armies 
of unity care for the masses of unity throughout great Yemen.

  [Text] O brother officers and soldiers in the remaining 
forces still taking orders from war criminal ['Ali Salim] al-Bid 
and from his secessionist clique in the Yemeni Socialist Party's 
leadership, O dear brothers, we call on you to resort to both 
reason and conscience. 
  We call on you to disavow the falsehoods imposed on you by 
the gang of apostasy and secession. The members of this gang 
are pushing you into the crematorium of war against your 
brothers in the forces of unity and Constitutional legitimacy. 
They mean only to protect themselves, their sick delusions, and 
their suspicious schemes designed to return the homeland to the 
situation that prevailed prior to 22 May 1990. 
  We urge you to reject the orders of the gang of apostasy and 
secession. This gang illegally gives orders to the Armed 
Forces' officers and soldiers. We call on you to carry out your 
national duty by joining the ranks of the forces of unity and 
democracy which are defending both Constitutional legitimacy and 
the interests of both the homeland and people, exactly as was 
done by thousands of your comrades in arms in various positions. 
  O dear brothers, we appeal to you to ask yourselves about 
what you are fighting for, and for what objectives you are 
aiming the weapons at your brethren. If you are really fighting 
for Yemeni unity, your natural position is within the ranks of 
the forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy, the forces of 
both the people and homeland. 
  You should aim your guns where they should be aimed: At the 
secessionist clique in the Socialist Party's leadership that 
betrayed the cause of unity, rebelled against democracy and 
constitutional legitimacy, and launched this war between 
brothers in arms for the sake of its dominating secessionist 
aspirations. 
  Why are you aiming your weapons at your brothers who are 
defending unity and democracy? Why are you killing men, 
bereaving the women of their husbands, and bereaving the 
children of their parents? Why are you exposing yourselves to 
death and creating disasters for your families and kinsfolk? 
Why are you setting fire to the homeland's achievements and 
deepening the people's wounds? Why are you demolishing the 
schools and hospitals and destroying the institutions which 
serve the people? Are you doing all this for a handful of 
rebellious secessionists? 
  O brothers in arms, return to your senses and fear God 
regarding yourselves, your kinsfolk, and your people's sons. 
Quickly join the ranks of the Armed Forces, which are defending 
unity and constitutional legitimacy. The secessionist clique 
has no chance of victory, now that most governorates are 
controlled by the forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy. 
  O dear brothers, quickly save yourselves from the dark fate 
which will be soon the lot of the secessionist clique led by 
traitor al-Bid. Be as the people expect you to be. Be 
rightfully and honestly the soldiers of God, the protectors of 
the homeland, the providers of security to the people, and the 
builders of life. Always be the defenders of unity, democracy, 
and constitutional legitimacy.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] The forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy's 
control the al-'Anad Air Base, their liquidation of the 
rebellious forces of apostasy, treason, and secession in 
Shabwah, and their seizure of the strategic 'Atiq and its 
adjacent areas are evidence of the determination of these forces 
to execute their military tasks. The forces of unity and 
constitutional legitimacy should be commended for their concern 
for saving civilians from the effects of the military clashes 
with the forces controlled by the supporters of the apostasy and 
secession gang. 
  We want to reiterate that the overwhelming victory in 
Shabwah, and, particularly in 'Atiq -- which is considered one 
of the most important strategic areas purged of the secessionist 
forces by the forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy -- 
is considered an important stride toward ridding the homeland of 
the secessionists who sold themselves to the devil. We are not 
exaggerating if we say that the forces of unity and 
constitutional legitimacy, which are achieving successive 
victories, will never hesitate in assuming their military tasks 
imposed by their faith in God, the homeland, the revolution, and 
unity and by their loyalty to constitutional legitimacy and 
democracy, which we accepted as our option to build a new Yemen, 
the Yemen of progress and prosperity. This is a firm conviction 
entrenched in the minds of our Armed Forces, who are protecting 
the homeland and unity and defending constitutional legitimacy. 
This should also dominate the minds of the remaining men 
carrying arms in the misled units that are still being moved by 
the rebellious and secessionist gang against the forces of unity 
and constitutional legitimacy. 
  Those who are still receiving orders from the gang of 
apostasy and secession -- the gang which declared its secession 
with impudence and blatant challenge toward the will of people 
-- must realize that they are now considered mercenaries. It 
would be better for them to stand at the side of unity and 
people and to defend constitutional legitimacy. The rebellious 
and secessionist gang, which is receiving money from the enemies 
of the homeland -- in addition to the money they have plundered 
-- is only interested in destroying the gains and achievements 
of the people, in shedding blood, and spreading death. Then, 
this gang plans escape with the millions they have plundered to 
outside the homeland. 
  Therefore, we urge the units still being controlled by the 
gang of apostasy and secession to join the forces of unity and 
constitutional legitimacy and to stand where the Yemeni people 
want them. The units that are still under the control of the 
scum from the secessionist rebellious clique, should realize 
that al-Bid and his treacherous rebellious gang -- the enemies 
of the people who declared secession -- are playing an agent 
role and do not care about the consequences. Their imaginary 
state, which they have proclaimed, is not set up on land or 
based on legitimacy. This state has no supporters or position 
from which it can defend its presence. 
  Thus, the proclamation of a secessionist state is only an 
illusion. The forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy and 
the Yemeni people know how to react to this madness that 
prompted the forces of mutiny and treason to announce the 
secession statement of hallucination, which exposed the nature 
of the gang of apostasy and secession and revealed their hostile 
objectives against the Yemeni people and their unity. 
  As we speak today about the ugliest creatures -- whom our 
people have known and who lived among our people, humiliated 
them, seized the liberties of their sons, desecrated their 
sanctities, and tampered with their potentials and resources -- 
we urge the sons of beloved Aden, who are suffering from the 
injustice of the stupid followers of the traitors 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid and his deviant clique, to wake up. This clique has no 
concern for the fate of the misled people. If the deviant 
al-Bid was able to escape from Aden, leaving the misled ones for 
their dark destiny -- if they continue to follow the orders of 
his clique -- he, and his men, will not escape punishment. The 
forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy will chase him as 
well as his clique, which escaped with him to the Hadhramaut 
Governorate, whose people have suffered from the humiliation and 
injustice at the hands of the gang of apostasy and secession in 
the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]. The sons of Hadhramaut will 
never forget the killing of the ulema and the prominent figures 
in [word indistinct]. Neither will they forget those who were 
buried alive because they differed with the YSP. The sons of 
Hadhramaut will stand, in words and deeds, at the side of the 
forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy. They know full 
well that these forces seek the wellbeing of the homeland and 
its people and the purging of the Yemeni homeland from the filth 
of the apostasy and secession gang which has become the 
bitterest enemy of the Yemeni people, their unity, gains, and 
national achievements. This gang will certainly have its 
inevitable punishment, and nothing will obstruct the will of God 
and the patient Yemeni people.

<F P=106> [Article by 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Rashid: "War Broke the Unity"] </F>
  [Text] One could ask: Will the one united Yemen become 
two Yemens as it was four years ago? 
  I believe that that only required a declaration of 
secession. 
  Could the secession become legitimate, considering that the 
prerequisites for the unitary state had been fulfilled and the 
president acquired legitimacy to govern? 
  Again, I believe that as the unity decision was a 
free-choice 
decision and not an arbitrary decision, the secession was also a 
free-choice decision and any attempt to impose unity by force 
would require a great miracle to be carried out and sustained. 
That was the mistake committed by the Yemenis when they 
resorted to force to settle their differences. The result was 
complete divorce. The dispute could have continued for one or 
two years without secession. Internal differences do occur, 
particularly in a state still trying to speak the same political 
common laguage. 
  We do not know of any political unity in contemporary Arab 
history that was imposed by force. We exclude annexation and 
occupation from this. That is why unity in Yemen would never 
succeed if the parties resort to force because it would then 
become a case of hegemony which the locals would resist with 
force as they did in the past. 
  Some might ask: What about the guarantees offered previously 
for the fulfillment of unity and reinforcement of the 
foundations of the unitary state? What happend to these 
guarantees and how could the Yemeni state's legitimacy be 
torpedoed? 
  The legal argument is not always enough, and launching a 
military war is the weakest legal argument. The unitary state 
agreement was signed by the two leaders and the two presidents 
personally, both of whom are still alive. Unity was then 
approved almost unanimously in a public referendum. The third 
phase came with the recognition of the unitary state by all the 
states which had previously recognized the two independent 
states, including the brothers and neighbors. That state took a 
fourth step towards securing its legitimacy when it lodged its 
registration papers with the United Nations as one state with 
one flag, one representative, and unified laws. 
  The war, however, has broken the state's legitimacy and 
weakened its legal value, regardless of the causes which 
prompted the armies to act. We should here particularly keep in 
mind that we are talking about a unitary state on paper. In 
reality, the two states remained as they were before the unity, 
with two armies, two currencies, and two regimes. 
  The two sides concentrated on the form, not the substance, 
of 
unity. That is why it has taken only two weeks of war to break 
it, with undeniable popular support. 
  War within a state trying to be one state cannot be the 
solution, rather a certain cause of division and enmity. 
  That is why we cannot understand why a war has been launched 
without any logical political concept. War will not make the 
victor popular because war between brothers would mean an insult 
to the loser but it would not subjugate the loser because he 
would see the victor as an occupation force and would therefore 
resist him as such. War cannot be a cane used to break enough 
heads to get revenge. War has broken unity, not rectified it.

  [Text] The Senate was assured this morning that there will 
be no unilateral capping or freezing of Pakistan's peaceful 
nuclear program. Speaking on the admissibility of the identical 
adjournment motions, the federal interior minister, retired 
Major General Nasirullah Khan Babar, said there is no reality in 
the report that the American deputy secretary of state during 
his recent visit put forward proposals for capping of nuclear 
program. He said the present government has more than once 
indicated clearly that there will be no such unilateral action. 
He assured that the Pakistan People's Party government will 
never be a party to any design that will limit our national 
objectives. He said India is fully aware that Pakistan has a 
deterrent power and that is the reason that Pakistan is safe 
against any offensive from the adversary.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Avoiding a Missile Race"] </F>
  [Text] A spokesman for the Pakistan Foreign Office has 
expressed concern over the Indian decision to deploy Prithvi and 
Agni missiles on the grounds that it will greatly enhance the 
possibility of a nuclear arms race in the region. While 
Pakistan in the context of its security environment is more 
concerned with the short range Prithvi missile, it is the 
Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM) Agni, that has a 
range of 2500 km and can carry a heavy payload, which, to an 
even greater extent, underlines India's aggressive defence 
posture. A missile of this type, in the presence of a high 
degree of accuracy, is significant not least because of its 
ability to carry nuclear warheads over a long range. This has 
caused even countries well beyond the region to question India's 
intentions. However, given the unfortunate history of conflict 
between India and Pakistan, the latter has felt more compelled 
to take defensive measures with regard to India's ambitious 
missile programme. Apart from attempting to develop indigenous 
missile technology to the best of its ability, Pakistan has 
incurred a small number of M-11 missiles from China. It has 
argued in response to US pressure on this score that the 
acquisition of these missiles does not violate the Missile 
Technology Control Regime (MTCRL). However, the real issue here 
is that if Pakistan perceives a major threat to its security as 
a result of the imminent deployment of the Prithvi missile, it 
is bound to take steps that provide it with the minimum 
necessary level of deterrence. 
  The matter is further aggravated when India's activities in 
this realm are seen in tandem with its ambitious and secretive 
nuclear programme. It is in this context that the Foreign 
Office spokesman has expressed legitimate fears. It is time for 
India to consider the cost of a prohibitively explosive race in 
the realm of missiles and nuclear weapons for the extremely 
deprived masses of the region. Neither country can really afford 
to enter into such a race. Certainly, Pakistan is already having 
to spend far too much on defence primarily because of India's 
continual enhancement of its already formidable defence 
capability as well as its aggressive stance, not just towards 
Pakistan, but the countries of the region, in general. Finding 
a solution to the nuclear issue in South Asia remains a 
difficult task not least as a result of India's intransigence in 
this regard. But, meanwhile, it would be eminently sensible if 
a beginning could be made on the missile front. If India were 
to restrain the production and deployment of missiles, it would 
contribute in bringing down the level of tension between the two 
countries and score an important confidence building measure 
that could possibly pave the way for progress on the more 
complex nuclear issue. Perhaps US policy-makers could take up 
the matter with the Indian prime minister on his upcoming visit 
to the United States. It would be even better, of course, if 
India were willing to make the issue a subject of meaningful 
bilateral negotiations with Pakistan.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Mohammad Yamin] </F>
  [Text] India's decision to deploy long-range nuclear 
missiles -- Prithvi and Agni -- has caused understandable 
concern to Pakistan. The Indian move will greatly enhance the 
threat to peace and security in South Asia and as a spokesman of 
Pakistan's Foreign Office observed the other day, it will raise 
the specter of a nuclear arms race in the region. In view of 
the ongoing internal uprising in held Kashmir and the unresolved 
dispute between India and Pakistan over the future status of 
Jammu and Kashmir, and also the historical fact that there have 
been three major armed conflicts between the two countries since 
their independence, Pakistan will be the most likely target of 
India's newly acquired military muscle. In long term, of course, 
there will be other countries who would also have to face up to 
the reality of life when India decides to flex its muscle in 
pursuance of its hegemonic designs in the region and its 
ambition of becoming a regional superpower. 
  Pakistan has, therefore, conveyed its concern over the 
matter 
to the Missile Technology Control Regime, MTCR, countries that 
include, among others, the United States. Hopefully, the MTCR 
nations would respond positively to Pakistan's message and 
exercise their collective and individual influence over India to 
give up dabbling in nuclear missilery and other weaponry of mass 
destruction. 
  Given India's intransigence over the issue, or for that 
matter over any bilateral or multilateral issues throughout 47 
years of its existence as an independent nation, the pursuance 
of Pakistani request by the MTCR countries is going to be a 
formidable task. The Indian prime minister has given a fair 
proof of it. Addressing the Indian Parliament on the eve of his 
departure for the United States on an official visit, Mr. 
Narasimha Rao chose to rule out the possibility that he might 
agree to roll back India's nuclear or missile program during his 
U.S. trip. In fact, his decision for any such suggestion was 
forceful and vehement and he remarked that a leader would be 
worthless if he changed the policies of his government during 
visits to foreign countries. He reiterated that his government 
would firmly adhere to its nuclear and missile development 
policies. (?While) on one hand, India is pressing ahead with 
its militaristic designs and augmentation of its military might 
at a hectic pace, on the other hand, it is [word indistinct] 
upon its own brand of disinformation and spread of false 
propaganda against Pakistan. To blame the revolt of Kashmiri 
people against the Indian occupation on Pakistan is easy enough. 
It now holds Pakistan responsible for trouble even inside its 
northeastern states that are over a thousand mile distance from 
Pakistan. It is also engaged in repeating the wild stories of 
Pakistan's complicity in last year's bomb blasts in Bombay. 
Along with its diplomatic and publicity offensive, India is 
also busy in acts of sabotage and mischief in liberated areas of 
Kashmir. It is also indulging in violations of the airspace of 
Azad Kashmir. Several Indian military helicopters flew along 
the Line of Control on 5 May and on two occasions, they crossed 
over into Azad Kashmir, besides two Indian terrorists were 
apprehended recently in Kotli sector of Azad Kashmir. They were 
carrying 52 kg of explosives and had confessed that they were on 
a sabotage mission at the behest of the Indian authorities. All 
these have ominous forebodings for peace and tranquillity in 
South Asia, particularly the deployment of Agni and Prithvi 
missiles must be seen as an important landmark in India's 
nuclear capability and a clear adoption of a threatening posture 
against small neighbors, Pakistan being on the top of the list.

  [Text] President Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari has said that 
Pakistan's relations with the United States are not confined to 
one direction, but covered a large area and must be viewed in 
their full complexity. Talking to APP [Associated Press of 
Pakistan] in London before his departure for the United States, 
he denied that relations between Pakistan and America have 
suffered any setback. He said some people viewed relations only 
in the context of nuclear nonproliferation. Pakistan, in this 
context, has made it clear that it supported the principle of 
ban on nuclear proliferation in the entire world, including the 
South Asian region. To say that only Pakistan should do it and 
India should not do it, is not acceptable to Pakistan. 
  Referring to his visit to the United States, he said he 
would 
hold talks at various levels covering foreign affairs, economy, 
and national security. He said he would also hold talks with 
officials of the IMF, exchange views with Congress House and 
Senate Committees, and a think tank on foreign affairs, besides 
meeting media organizations. 
  The president was seen off at the Heathrow Airport by a 
representative of the queen; the acting Pakistan high 
commissioner, Mr. Moeen Jan Nayim; officials at the High 
Commission; and members of Pakistan community.

  [Text] President Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari has said that 
during his stay in the United States he will hold talks at 
various levels on political issues, foreign affairs, economic 
matters and national security. Talking to APP in London prior 
to his departure for the United States, he said that he will 
also exchange views with IMF authorities and hold talks with 
officials of Congress and Senate committees. 
  The president refuted the impression that Pakistan-U.S. 
relations have suffered any jolt. He said that Pakistan's 
relations with the United States are not limited to only one 
dimension; rather, they are wide-ranging. The president said 
that some people view these relations only in the context of 
nuclear nonproliferation, which is not a correct approach. 
Pakistan has categorically said in this regard that on 
principle it favors restrictions on nuclear weapons, and to say 
that Pakistan should do this and India should not do this is not 
acceptable to Pakistan. The president was seen off at Heathrow 
Airport by a representative of the Queen of England, acting 
Pakistani High Commissioner (Naim Jan Naim), high commission 
officials, and Pakistani residents. Later, the president 
arrived in Rochester, beginning his private visit to the United 
States. He was received at the airport by Pakistani Ambassador 
Dr. Maliha Lodhi, senior officials of the Pakistani Embassy, and 
Pakistanis residing in the city. During this stay, the 
president will be given an honorary LLD degree by University of 
Rochester. The president will leave for Washington on 23 May, 
where he will have a very busy time and hold some important 
meetings.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz has condemned Israel's 
abduction of al-Hajj Mustafa al-Dirani from his home in Qasr 
Naba, Ba'labakk, at dawn on Saturday, describing it as a 
violation of international law. Buwayz began contacts with 
several world circles and Lebanon's permanent delegation at the 
United Nations a few hours after the abduction to secure 
al-Dirani's early release. 
  Buwayz said: I strongly condemn this act, which is an 
aggression against Lebanon's security and compromises the Middle 
East peace process at a time when the ongoing negotiations and 
contacts seek a solution to the crisis. 
  A diplomatic source at the Foreign Ministry said Lebanese 
diplomatic contacts are under way to discuss lodging a complaint 
with the Security Council against Israel.

  [Text] Ba'labakk, May 23, IRNA -- Former secretary general 
of Lebanese Hizballah, Shaykh Subhi al-Tufayli, here Monday 
urged Lebanese Muslims to carry arms and defend themselves 
against the Zionist regime. 
  Interviewed by IRNA, al-Tufayli criticized the Lebanese 
Government for its silence vis-a-vis the crimes being committed 
by the Zionist regime, and held the government responsible for 
the abduction of Mustafa al-Dirani, leader of the Mu'manah 
resistance group. Al-Dirani was abducted from his home in 
al-Biqa' by the Zionist commandos last Saturday. 
  "From now on Lebanese people cannot trust the security 
provided by the Lebanese Government," he said. 
  Al-Tufayli warned that silence of the Lebanese officials 
would further encourage the Zionist regime to continue its 
crimes and violate the human rights in Lebanon.

  [Text] Iran has completely severed its financial aid to the 
Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine. The movement has 
traditionally had good relations with Iran. Its secretary 
general, Dr. Fathi al-Shiqaqi, was given a head-of-state welcome 
when he visited Tehran two months ago to participate in 
celebrations marking the international Jerusalem day. He was 
also given the honor of delivering his speech right after the 
Iranian leader 'Ali Khamene'i gave his. Al-Shiqaqi left Tehran 
with many promises of support for his movement but none of these 
promises came true. On the contrary, all assistance was cut 
off, a Palestinian source told AL-SHIRA'. 
  According to the same source, the Iranian move can be 
explained either by there being differences among various 
factions within the Iranian authority or by a change in Iranian 
policy. The latter is more likely, the source said, because 
Iran is giving more priority to the Arab Gulf region, the 
(formerly Soviet) Islamic republics, and Afghanistan. 
  The source added that Iran wishes to allay western pressure 
on Iran by declining to play a direct role in the Middle East. 
The United States had advised Iran not to oppose the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement, or to obstruct the agreement signed in 
Oslo and the peace process. 
  According to the same source, Iran made a number of promises 
to the alliance of Palestinian forces but it failed to deliver. 
This indicates that Iran is not serious in what it says. The 
source said Iran determines its policy in light of its own 
interests, not the interests and designs of those vying for its 
help. The source predicted that Iran will eventually 
discontinue its already reduced aid to Hizballah. 
  Iran used to pay pensions to the families of those killed in 
the course of the intifadah through the Islamic Jihad Movement 
in Palestine, in appreciation of the latter's role in the 
intifadah and the impressive operations it mounted against 
Israeli forces and settlers. Two years ago, however, this 
assistance was discontinued. The reason was that Iran supported 
a split within the movement's ranks in which Shaykh Sayyid 
Barakah, a former leader of the movement, announced the 
establishment of Hizballah (Palestine). Barakah failed to win 
over al-Jihad members, however, and al-Shiqaqi refused to give 
in to his breakaway group. 
  Consequently, Iran shifted its support away from al-Shiqaqi, 
giving Barakah command of al-Shahid [martyr] institution in 
Lebanon. Meanwhile, it gave the Popular Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine-General Command [PFLP-GC] the 
responsibility of distributing the pensions to the martyrs of 
the intifadah. 
  According to press reports, PFLP-GC Central Committee Member 
Mustafa Khamis, who lives in Jordan, recently broke away from 
the PFLP-GC, and formed an Islamic General Command [qiyadah 
'amah islamiyah]. No reason was given for the split. Khamis 
spent 15 years in Israeli jails, and was released in 1979 in an 
exchange of prisoners between Israel and the PFLP-GC. Khamis' 
motives for the split are said to be linked with PFLP-GC 
suspicions surrounding his role in forging documents and 
embezzling funds allocated to the martyrs families in the 
occupied land. Iran has no remaining allies in Palestine and 
Lebanon who are not so employed.

  [Text] New Delhi 17 May -- The Human Resource Development 
Ministry has denied that the passage of the amended Copyright 
Law in the parliament last week was in any way connected to 
Prime Minister Narasimha Rao's U.S. visit. Yogendra Nath 
Chaturvedi, additional secretary in the ministry, and other 
senior officials during their informal talks with reporters said 
that it was only a coincidence that the law was passed on eve of 
the prime minister's U.S. visit. According to some press 
reports, the law was passed in `haste' just before the prime 
minister's U.S. visit. Rao, by getting the law passed in the 
parliament, wanted to assure the United States that legal 
arrangements have been made to stop the theft of U.S computer 
programs. The Prime Minister's Office was afraid that this 
issue would be raised during Rao's visit. The general complaint 
of U.S. computer companies is that the theft of their computer 
programs is very common in India. 
  The ministry officials today clarified that in fact the 
joint 
parliamentary committee formed to study the law had submitted 
its report on the last day of the monsoon session of the 
parliament. Following that, the law was given its final touches 
after consultations with various ministries, including the Law 
Ministry. It was not possible to table the bill to this effect 
in the parliament before the budget session. 
  According to Chaturvedi, Shahid Ali Khan, former deputy 
director general of the Geneva-based World Intellectual Property 
Association, has termed the bill as the one of the best 
copyright laws in the world, which has incorporated all 
"progressive" steps keeping in view all new challenges likely to 
be posed. He said to ensure strict enforcement of the law at 
least in the state capitals, state governments are being asked 
to set up a cell in the police department. The cell will 
comprise police and military personnel. The training of these 
personnel for enforcement of the copyright law will be entrusted 
to the Human Resource Development Ministry. Other than this, 
the ministry will organize a seminar in November, with the help 
of World Intellectual Property Association, to create public 
awareness about the copyright law. Such seminars are also 
planned at the state level. 
  Chaturvedi said that the main aim of the amended Coyright 
Law 
is to protect interests of big publishers, video and cable 
operators, writers, artists, and musicians. With this aim in 
view, the bill has a provision for setting up copyright 
societies. These societies will provide legal protection to 
their members. The members in turn will pay a small part of 
their royalty to the concerned society. Such societies are very 
popular in Balkan states, Japan, and Germany. However, it will 
not be compulsory for writers and artists in India to be members 
of such societies as it is in other countries. 
  According to Chaturvedi, now video recordings of the public 
performances by artists, singers, dancers, and snake charmers 
will not be allowed without their permission. There was no such 
arrangement earlier. The law especially ensures that the 
royalty paid for the work of writers or artists will be clearly 
mentioned in the contract. It will also have to be made clear in 
the contract between the two sides as to what will be the 
transfer area, period and geographic limit of a copyright.

  [Text] Glorious ceremonies were held at the leader's hajj 
headquarters last night on the third night that pilgrims to the 
House of God camped at the holy land of al-Mina. Our 
correspondent reports: 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Dear listeners of the midday 
bulletin of the Voice of the Islamic Republic of Iran: I speak 
to you from the holy land of al-Mina. Tens of thousands of 
Iranian and non-Iranian pilgrims took part in ceremonies held at 
his eminence the leader's headquarters in the holy land of 
al-Mina last night. The chants of Death to America and Death to 
Israel of the participants could be heard all over the camp 
where the Islamic Republic of Iran's hajj caravans stayed. At 
the same time fully equipped Saudi special commandos surrounded 
the leader's headquarters and the area where the Iranian 
pilgrims resided and controlled comings and goings and created 
problems for the Iranian pilgrims. So many pilgrims had 
gathered at the ceremony that the leader's headquarters and the 
tents beside it were filled with people. 
  During the ceremonies, Ayatollah Mesbah-Yazdi, one of the 
Qom 
Seminary scholars, spoke on the philosophy of the uprising of 
His Holiness Abraham, peace be upon him, and the implementation 
of divine orders at that holy land. He stressed: What was 
special about the action taken by His Holiness Abraham was the 
breaking of idols and his decisiveness against infidels and the 
declaration of the disavowal of the infidels. 
  Ayatollah Mesbah-Yazdi referred to the leadership role of 
the 
velayat-e faqih [guardianship of the supreme jurisconsult] in 
guiding the Muslim society toward understanding God and said: We 
believe that the Islamic Republic is in line with the 
implementation of Islamic principles and the uprising of the 
idol-smashing Abraham. Therefore the Muslim and revolutionary 
people of Iran continue to listen to the command of the leader 
of the revolution and implement their duties. He pointed out: 
The day that the late imam [Khomeyni] decreed that the disavowal 
of the infidels ceremonies should be held, the Iranian nation 
obeyed the order and even sacrificed a great deal of blood for 
that holy cause. Today also, abiding by the orders of his 
eminence the leader, it treads the path of its supreme ideals. 
  Ayatollah Mesbah-Yazdi said: If the disavowal of the 
infidels 
ceremonies were cancelled in holy Mecca and our people put up 
with it, this was to protect the sanctity of that divine 
sanctuary [the Ka'bah]. And it was due to the discernment and 
vigilance of the leader of the Islamic revolution that the 
ceremonies were cancelled.

  [Text] Tehran, May 24, IRNA -- A Persian daily Tuesday 
wrote that King Fahd's message to the hajj pilgrims on Sunday 
was contrary to the reasonable expectations of the world of 
Islam. The morning daily `JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI' said that in fact 
the Saudi ruler was expected to invite people to close ranks, 
urge Muslims to properly employ their potentials to counter 
enemies of Islam and, avoid discord. 
  On the contrary, in his message King Fahd called on the U.S. 
President Bill Clinton to take further steps towards peace with 
the Zionist regime and voiced his country's readiness to 
cooperate with the U.S. Administration, Arab states and 
international bodies interested in the American-sponsored peace 
in the region. 
  The Saudi ruler's message further proves the authenticity of 
the reports that the Zionist regime had threatened the Saudi 
Government it would be deprived of attending the Arab-Israel 
talks if `disavowal of unbelievers' rally were held in Mecca. 
  King Fahd's message indicates to the fact that he wanted the 
Zionist regime and the U.S. keep their promise and enter Saudi 
Arabia into the dangerous game on the fate of the Muslim 
Palestinian nation, said the article. 
  Fahd had called for the handing over of the three Iranian 
islands to the United Arab Emirates and claimed that the 
(Persian) Gulf Cooperation Council would support Abu Dhabi in 
Iran-UAE dispute. 
  Elsewhere in his message, the article noted, Fahd tried to 
inculcate the idea that there were some disputes among Persian 
Gulf states with the aim to make hajj pilgrims believe that 
regional countries and nations are not able to reach 
understanding and therefore need some guardians. 
  Turning to the role that U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher has played in the region, the editorial said that he 
would count on lackey governments to help the U.S. come out of 
the Middle East quagmire. Through preventing the `disavowal of 
unbelievers' rally, finalizing Gaza-Jericho accord and, creating 
a state of terror in Lebanon and occupied Palestine, Warren 
Christopher and his agents try to pretend that the Zionist 
regime hold the upper hand in the region, it said. By sowing 
discord among regional countries, the U.S. intends to prepare 
the ground for the emergence of a new source of tension in the 
region, said the editorial. 
  The article regretted the fact that the lackey Arab front 
has 
rendered great assistance to materialization of Christopher's 
conspiracies, adding that King Fahd's message is the latest in 
the chain.

  [Text] The Saudis' inappropriate treatment of Iranian 
pilgrims, and the restrictions and obstacles they created for 
them with regard to the observance of the disavowal of the 
pagans rituals, not only do not accord with the dignity of the 
custodian of Mecca and the observance of sanctuary, but also, in 
terms of political culture and the interests of the world 
community, did not constitute the best solution. 
  Speaking at a meeting today of the country's judicial 
authorities, Ayatollah Yazdi, head of the judiciary branch, 
said: Governmental sense and wisdom dictate that, in order to 
solve a particular case, the Saudi authorities should not set 
themselves up against the world of Islam and regional countries 
and face unanswerable questions from public opinion. 
  The judiciary chief said the recent action of the Zionist 
regime was overt theft and blatant kidnapping. He declared: 
Such ugly behavior by the illegitimate offspring of world 
arrogance is not surprising, particularly since the raison 
d'etre of the Zionist regime is usurpation and delinquence. The 
deathly silence of the international forums and organizations 
who talk about human rights is surprising and regrettable, 
however.

<F P=106> [Commentary prepared by the News Research and Commentaries </F>
Group] 
  [Text] Yesterday the Zionist regime carried out a new 
terrorist act by resorting to a kidnapping inside Lebanese 
territory. Dozens of armed men attacked a village in southern 
Lebanon on Saturday morning and kidnapped Mustafa al-Dirani, the 
head of Lebanon's faithful resistance, from his village home. 
  In reaction to this kidnapping, the Lebanese Hizballah 
issued 
a statement yesterday in which it said that the Zionist regime's 
fresh crime is a manifestation of the terrorist nature of a 
regime supported by America. Stating that the Islamic ummah has 
no alternative but to resist the Zionist regime, the Lebanese 
Hizballah called on all of Lebanon's party and official circles 
to react to this kidnapping. 
  Also, 'Allamah Muhammad Mahdi Shams-al-Din, one of Lebanon's 
Shiite leaders, described the Zionist regime's terrorist act as 
a violation of Lebanon's sovereignty and called on the UN 
Security Council to strive for al-Dirani's release. In reaction 
to this incident, 'Allamah Sayyid Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah, 
another Lebanese Shiite clerical leader, pointed out that the 
Lebanese Government's sovereignty has been violated, and he 
criticized Europe and the United States for their silence 
vis-a-vis Israel's renewed aggression against Lebanon. 
  Five years ago, in 1989, the Zionist regime took hostage 
another Hizballah leader, Shaykh 'Abd-al-Karim 'Ubayd, in the 
same manner, kidnapping him from his home. Also, in 1992 a 
Zionist helicopter violated Lebanese airspace and fired a rocket 
at the car carrying Hizballah Secretary General 'Abbas al-Musawi 
and his wife, martyring both of them. 
  The Zionist regime's flaunting of international practice and 
its aggressive nature has turned the Middle East into a constant 
hotbed of crisis. Following yesterday's kidnapping, Zionist 
Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres admitted that the terrorist act 
had been carried out and lied that the Zionist regime's military 
ability to strike at its opponents even inside Lebanese 
territory is very high. Apart from the fact that this overt 
confession can be used as a proof to condemn the Zionist regime 
in international circles, it should also not be forgotten that 
military experts consider this escapade by the Zionist regime to 
be worthless and an act stemming from weakness.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Supporter of Terrorism"] </F>
  [Text] The U.S. State Department recently published a 
report in which it accused seven countries as the main 
supporters of terrorism. 
  The U.S. authorities have included Iran among the seven 
countries, and have levelled their strongest attack against the 
Islamic Republic of Iran. 
  The report claims Iran trains what the American authorities 
call fundamentalist terrorists, and dispatches them to the other 
Islamic countries. 
  A cursory glance will reveal that all of the 7 countries 
included in the list are those Third World countries that are 
not prepared to give in to the American global superpower role, 
and oppose Washington's expansionist policies. 
  CIA has been the greatest center for training terrorists, 
and 
it has frequently resorted to devilish plots such as coup 
d'etats including the 1953 coup in Iran and the coup engineered 
against the legitimate government of Dr. Allende in Chile in the 
70s -- and assassination of numerous political figures around 
the world. 
  In fact coup d'etats and assassinations have been among the 
basic components of the American foreign policy in the decades 
after World War II. 
  The relation between the American government and the 
terrorist groups is an undeniable fact. How else could one 
explain the meeting of the American Vice-President with a 
terrorist group whose acts of terrorism have been proved on the 
basis of evidences provided by the U.S. Government itself. 
  Thus it is quite obvious that Washington's attempt in 
accusing Iran and six other countries of giving support to 
terrorist groups is only meant to divert world public opinion 
from its own activities. 
  Syria is also accused of support for terrorists mainly in 
connection with its activities in Lebanon. But political 
observers have no doubt that this is a clear case of blackmail. 
In other words Syria will automatically be crossed off the list 
of governments supporting terrorism as soon as Syria has 
accepted the Zionist aggression in the Golan Heights. 
  So on the eve of Christopher's new round of trip to the 
Middle East with the mission of putting pressure on Syria and 
making it accept the imposed peace arrangements, it is 
understandable why Washington brings out such accusatory reports.

  [Text] News section--The director general for foreign press 
and mass media at the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance 
wrote to invite the chief editors of the country's newspapers to 
participate in a meeting on Saturday afternoon, 14 May (today) 
with American chief editors affiliated with the Association of 
American Chief Editors. The invitation makes no mention of the 
topics to be discussed and gives no explanation on the objective 
of this meeting. 
  It is still not clear who invited the American editors to 
Iran or why the foreign press and mass media director general at 
the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance has extended this 
invitation to the American journalists. 
  Over the past years, America has made extensive and futile 
efforts to find a way to open the door to dialogue with the 
Islamic Republic of Iran. Apparently a dialogue between the 
American and Iranian chief editors is a new ploy by the 
Americans to achieve their goal. During the past 15 years, 
American publications have disseminated the most poisonous 
propaganda against the Islamic revolution, Imam Khomeyni, and 
the Islamic Republic of Iran. Journalism is one of the masks 
that the Americans use to send their spies to other countries, 
and the American journalists who have visited the Islamic 
Republic of Iran have always disseminated false and biased 
reports about Iran. 
  With its clear assessment of such dialogues, JOMHURI-YE 
ESLAMI refuses to attend this meeting. There is still no 
precise information on whether the chief editors of other 
newspapers will or will not attend this dialogue.

<F P=106> [Commentary by the Public Relations Department of KEYHAN </F>
Publications] 
  [Text] The respected director general of foreign press and 
mass media affairs at the Ministry of Culture and Islamic 
Guidance has sent a letter to the chief editors of the country's 
newspapers, inviting them to attend a meeting with 13 chief 
editors of American publications affiliated with the Association 
of American Editors which is to be held at the ETTELA'AT 
publications office this afternoon. The respected director 
general's letter does not indicate who invited this 13-man 
delegation and what the objective behind this dialogue is. He 
also does not clarify if the dialogue with the Iranian chief 
editors is the only program or if something else has also been 
planned. The choosing of the ETTELA'AT offices as the venue of 
this meeting gives rise to the strong belief that the American 
chief editors have been invited by ETTELA'AT Publications to 
Iran! If this is so, then the question is: On what criterion 
was this invitation based? And if there was no criterion, then 
what is happening? 
  The letter from the director general for foreign mass media 
affairs at the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance to the 
Public Relations Department of KEYHAN Publications invites some 
of the chief editors of KEYHAN Publications to attend a dialogue 
with the American chief editors. Since the aspects of this 
dialogue have not been clarified and the experience of the past 
few years has clearly shown that the American mass media, namely 
American publications, have continuously had a spiteful attitude 
toward the Muslim people and the Islamic revolution, and since 
the ugly and black record of the American mass media and 
publications shows that they have always distorted facts and 
disseminated false reports in order to poison public opinion 
toward Islamic Iran and its people, none of the chief editors of 
KEYHAN Publications will attend the meeting. The esteemed 
Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance is asked to give more 
explanations on why this invitation was extended and what the 
objectives behind it are.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Wrong Reasoning"] </F>
  [Text] Following the reciprocal visits paid by Iranian 
journalists to several countries, namely Germany, Kuwait, and 
Lebanon, some foreign policy and cultural officials came to 
believe that they can seize this opportunity to establish a 
dialogue between Iranian and American journalists as well, and 
thus find a way to open the door of dialogue between the two 
countries! Arranging the visit of 13 chief editors from 
American publications to the Islamic Republic of Iran, which is 
said to have taken place with the coordination of our country's 
representation at the United Nations and the director general 
for foreign mass media affairs at the Ministry of Culture and 
Islamic Guidance, was apparently based on this same assumption. 
  Fortunately none of the chief editors of the Iranian 
newspapers accepted the invitation to meet with the American 
chief editors, and the plan failed. The conclusions that can be 
drawn from this failure are noteworthy. First of all, the 
Iranian chief editors' refusal to meet with the American chief 
editors shows that a strong anti-American atmosphere still 
exists in Iranian press circles, and the Americans should 
realize that they are hated by all the social strata in Iran. 
  Secondly, in the past two days since the press raised this 
issue, many people from various walks of life have called to 
strongly criticize those who made the preparations for the 
American chief editors' visit to the Islamic Republic of Iran 
and to thank the Iranian chief editors for refusing to 
participate in this dialogue. This means that the Iranian 
nation's strong hatred for America continues. 
  Thirdly, if there are those in various parts of the system 
of 
the Islamic Republic with a "wrong reasoning" who think that 
through such attempts, they can open a door to dialogue with 
America, they are very mistaken and will be confronted with the 
people's rage and negative responses. At any rate, public 
opinion now expects the related sources to follow up the issue 
and to clarify the situation.

  [Text] Cairo, 21 May (MENA)--Interior Minister Hasan 
al-Alfi has affirmed that deceased lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani 
held an important position within the extremist groups. He said 
that some terrorists have confessed to the higher state security 
prosecution that the lawyer was the direct contact link to 
Tal'at Yasin Hammam, the amir of the organization. The latter 
died on 25 April 1994 in a clash with the police. 
  In statements to the Cairo-based AL-AKHBAR newspaper today, 
al-Alfi said that 'Abd-al-Harith was moving funds between the 
leaders of the organization inside the prison and those outside 
it. He was also responsible for funding the activities of the 
organization by distributing the support funds from abroad. 
  In his statements, the interior minister said the dead 
terrorist lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani never entered the state 
investigations' building. Right after he was arrested, upon 
orders from the prosecution, he was taken to the hospital where 
he died from a severe asthmatic attack. The interior minister 
affirmed that the prosecution had autopsied the body and the 
coroner's report has been presented to the public prosecutor. 
  Al-Alfi noted that the events at the Lawyer's Union, which 
were orchestrated by some lawyers who belong to the disbanded 
Muslim Brotherhood group, are seen as another ring in the chain 
of confrontation between terrorism and security. He pointed out 
that these lawyers tried to cause tension among the Egyptian 
people. 
  Al-Alfi said that the police forces were very patient and 
showed great self-restraint regarding these events. 
  He added that he had asked police patrols outside the 
Union's 
headquarters not to storm the building. He pointed out that he 
asked the lawyers to resort to legal channels in order to 
present their viewpoints. However, they refused and insisted on 
causing this hubbub. Some of them even threatened to march with 
weapons. 
  The interior minister clarified that despite all this, the 
police did not resort to the use of the emergency law because 
they believe in the sovereignty and legitimacy of the law.

<F P=106> [Report by Amirah Huwaydi: "Clampdown on Alexandria Islamic </F>
Society"] 
  [Text] A decision by the governor of Alexandria to dissolve 
the board of directors of a religious society for what was 
officially described as financial malpractice triggered clashes 
last week between security forces and members of the society and 
their sympathisers in the working class Alexandria neighbourhood 
of Al-Wardiyan. An undetermined number of people were injured 
and others arrested. 
  A source at the Alexandria state security department put the 
number of those arrested at 20. But 'Adil 'Id, a lawyer and 
member of the Alexandria branch of the Egyptian Organisation for 
Human Rights [EOHR], said as many as 338 people had been 
detained. 
  The trouble began when Nahid Hafiz Abu-al-'Azm, a 
representative of the Ministry of Social Affairs, went to the 
society's head office, accompanied by a number of policemen, on 
8 May to enforce the governor's decision. 
  According to eyewitness Yusri 'Abbas, a butcher who lives 
and 
works in the neighbourhood, members of the society and their 
families as well as hundreds of sympathisers reacted by staging 
a sit-in inside the building which they locked from the inside. 
"Sheikhs shouted anti-government slogans through loudspeakers 
and urged the people of the district to challenge the police," 
he said. By that time, the number of police had swelled to 
hundreds. 
  Another eyewitness, Ahmad Qasim, said the protesters hurled 
stones and bottles of acid at police who responded with tear gas 
and used batons. The violence continued for two days. 
  According to 'Adil 'Id of the EOHR, 138 persons were 
remanded 
in custody for 15 days on charges of staging an illegal 
gathering, resisting the police and damaging property. Some of 
them are members of the society and the Islamist-leaning Labour 
Party while others are members of the Physicians Syndicate and 
the local municipal council. Moreover, 'Id said, about 200 
persons were detained under state of emergency powers, and no 
specific charges were levelled against them. 
  The security source said the governor's decision to dissolve 
the board of al-I'tisam bi Habl Allah society was triggered by 
administrative and financial irregularities. The Arabic name of 
the society is derived from a Quranic verse and may be 
translated as "holding fast to the rope which God stretched out 
for the faithful." 
  The governor's decision means that "board members will have 
to be replaced by others through democratic elections," the 
source said. "It does not mean that the role of the society must 
come to an end." 
  The society is located in a four storey white building atop 
the Abu-'Umar Mosque. In addition to running the mosque itself, 
the society also extends medical and educational services to the 
poor inhabitants of the neighbourhood. 
  Dr Ibrahim al-Za'farani, chairman of the human rights 
committee of the Physicians Syndicate, said the board of the 
society was not the first to be dissolved. Others which faced 
the same fate were al-Rida', Huda al-Islam, al-Ikhlas and 
al-Tawhid. "All were Islamic-oriented and all were in 
Alexandria, and the reasons for dissolving them were not 
legitimate," he said. 
  Al-Za'farani said that instead of shutting down these 
societies, the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) should 
compete with them in extending services to the public. "And the 
NDP is capable of offering much more than these nongovernmental 
societies," he said.

  [Text] Cairo, 20 May (MENA)--AL-AHRAM newspaper reports 
that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's tour of the 
region this week was highlighted by the considerable change in 
Syrian and Israeli stands regarding a peaceful settlement. It 
notes the clear discussions regarding Israeli withdrawal from 
the Golan Heights and the possibilities of normalizing 
Syrian-Israeli relations in the future. 
  AL-AHRAM's editorial for tomorrow, Saturday 21 May, says 
that 
the current talk on the many differences between the stands of 
the two sides is only natural with such complex and intricate 
negotiations. It notes that on the other hand, this means 
negotiations now address many of the detailed issues and are not 
merely confined to generalities and principles that govern the 
negotiations process. 
  AL-AHRAM affirms that Egyptian-U.S. efforts will continue to 
provide hope for moving the Syrian-Israeli course along and 
clearly pushing it forward despite all appearances to the 
contrary.

  [Text] Cairo, 22 May (MENA)--AL-AKHBAR newspaper denounces 
the acts which the Sudanese regime is eager to commit every now 
and then to harm the Egyptian people and Government, describing 
these acts as weird, provocative, foolish, and deliberate, which 
any normal Egyptian citizen will call provocative. 
  In today's editorial, the paper notes that this is not the 
first time the al-Bashir-al-Turabi regime has resorted to such 
cheap acts, which may be designed to test Egypt's reaction and 
exploit it domestically and abroad should our reaction be 
violent and firm. But, it adds, Egypt has been patient more than 
once with the fabricated battles into which the Sudanese regime 
seeks to drag Egypt. 
  The paper says that Egypt, with its international standing 
and sincere people, rejects all the schemes of the Sudanese 
regime, which imposes control over its people by force. 
  The paper adds that if those who unexpectedly assumed power 
in Sudan believe that Egypt's patience is limitless, they are 
fooling themselves and should realize this fact very well. 
  The paper asserts that Egypt alone is the one who will 
decide 
how to answer these failed attempts to provoke it; and if the 
response takes some time, it is because of Egypt's deep concern 
for the Sudanese people. AL-AKHBAR concludes its editorial with 
the Arab adage: "Avoid the patient man's anger."

  [Text] Cairo, 22 May (MENA)--In their editorials today, the 
newspapers AL-AHRAM, AL-JUMHURIYAH, and AL-WAFD call for an end 
to the fighting in Yemen and cite the need for the two sides to 
resolve their differences through negotiations and dialogue to 
preserve Yemeni unity. 
  AL-AHRAM notes that, as President Husni Mubarak said in his 
latest appeal to the Yemeni leaders, the current situation in 
Yemen requires wisdom and reason because the Arab nation today 
is in dire need of unity and solidarity. The paper says that 
President Mubarak's appeal came at a very critical time in the 
Yemeni crisis, after confrontation had intensified between the 
two parties. It adds that President Mubarak was eager to spare 
Yemen frightful massacres that might kill a great number of 
Yemeni people and further destroy their resources. 
  AL-JUMHURIYAH regrets the continued fighting between the 
Yemeni brothers on the fourth anniversary of Yemeni unity, 
because the Yemenis are writing the end of the unity with their 
own blood and burying the hope of all Arabs that the unified 
state will remain steadfast. The paper says leaders of the 
Yemeni conflict are contributing to distorting the Arabs' image 
in the entire world despite repeated appeals by President Husni 
Mubarak and Arab leaders to convince them to heed the voice of 
reason and logic and avoid a crisis. 
  For its part, AL-WAFD asks what led to the collapse of 
Yemeni 
unity and the escalation of the differences between brothers to 
the point of using aircraft, tanks, and missiles, and tens of 
thousands of victims. The paper regrets the collapse of unity 
in Yemen on its fourth anniversary.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Who Should We Believe on the Issue of </F>
Inflation?"] 
  [Text] Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Planning Dr. 
Kamal al-Janzuri admitted before the Consultative Council 
yesterday that the rate of inflation in Egypt has reached 15 
percent. We do not think that the man made a mistake, because 
he has a strong memory and remembers all the figures of the 
budget and plans and even the entire five-year plan. 
  Because the man did not make a mistake, we would like to ask 
where Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi got the figure that he 
announced about a month ago, which was that the inflation rate 
is 7 percent. A mistake can be made about 1 or 2 percent, but 
such a big difference is not a mistake at all. It shows that 
there is something definitely wrong in the figures that the 
government announces. 
  The figure announced by Dr. al-Janzuri is the same one that 
was announced before by Dr. Salah Hamid, the governor of the 
Central Bank, who was relieved of his post because of it. 
  We have a right to ask about the truth and for the people to 
learn the real inflation figure, because it is in the light of 
this rate that interests on loans and deposits are calculated 
and the percentage of the periodic cost of living allowance is 
determined, which happens in civilized countries. 
  Yes, we want to know. Who should we believe, the prime 
minister or his deputy, the former Central Bank governor or the 
IMF? 
  The inflation rate in any country is well known not only to 
financial dealers and businessmen but to the simple man on the 
street and the union members. This is because prices and wages 
are determined on the basis of this rate. We must put an end to 
this contradiction between senior officials. 
  Yes, we want the truth and nothing but the truth, O 
Government of Egypt.

  [Text] Cairo, 22 May (MENA)--The state's general budget for 
fiscal year 1994-1995 has allocated about 35 billion pounds to 
investments necessary for development and production and 
procuring needed equipment. This represents one of the primary 
bases of the economic plan to help increase production. 
  Finance Minister Dr. Muhammad al-Razzaz said that from the 
allocated amount 7 billion pounds have been designated for 
services agencies--the administrative body, local 
administration, and service authorities--and that 5.8 billion 
pounds have been designated for economic and similar agencies. 
He added that 22.2 billion pounds have been allocated for 
investments in the public and private business sectors. 
  He said that the new budget includes some 12.8 billion 
pounds 
as investments for the state's service agencies and economic 
bodies representing approximately 37 percent of the total 
investments contained in the state's general budget. He 
emphasized that this increase in investment allocations will 
help complete necessary projects in very important sectors 
achieve the goals of economic development. Foremost of these, 
he said, are the projects of infrastructure and public 
utilities, such as water, sewage, and development of slum areas, 
in addition to educational and health requirements, such as 
schools and hospitals. 
  He said the share of public and private business and 
cooperative sectors, which amounts to 22.2 billion pounds and 
represents 63 percent of the 1994-1995 plan investments, 
reflects the prospective pivotal role of these sectors in 
increasing production and employment. 
  He noted the new budget's reliance in funding the 
development 
plan's projects on intrinsic financing, as well as financing 
from local savings without resorting to banks to avoid 
inflationary effects detrimental to the national economy. 
  The finance minister said that foreign loans will be sought 
on a limited basis and only for production projects, hence the 
foreign loans included in the general budget do not exceed 2.3 
percent.

  [Text] Cairo, 22 May (MENA)--Minister of Petroleum Dr. 
Hamdi al-Banbi has announced a new ministry strategy to extend 
help to foreign companies prospecting for oil and natural gas. 
The strategy allows these companies to market their share of 
discovered crude if they desire. 
  In a statement made today, he said the Egyptian General 
Petroleum Authority will buy the foreign partner's share of the 
discovered natural gas under a gas-selling accord. A 75-percent 
share of gas will be purchased to provide natural gas for 
production and services as part of a plan to replace oil 
products with natural gas and secure oil for export to acquire 
foreign currency necessary to implement the five-year 
economic-social plan and avoid borrowing. 
  He noted that the Egyptian General Petroleum Authority is 
constantly working to attract as many international oil and 
natural gas prospecting companies as possible by inviting 
international bids for basins with new high oil and natural gas 
potential to allow these companies to make appropriate decisions 
on investing in Egypt. 
  He remarked that this policy has succeeded in attracting 
numerous new companies to Egypt over the past years and that 
major international companies that left Egypt 10 years ago have 
decided to return after discovering that Egyptian oil agreements 
have improved and developed. 
  Dr. al-Banbi said that the oil sector recently opened the 
door to the Egyptian private sector to participate in oil and 
natural gas exploration and prospecting because that sector has 
gained experience in the field. The aim of this plan, he added, 
is to close the gap that might be caused when some international 
companies withdraw from the Egyptian market for any reason.

  [Text] Afghan President Borhanoddin Rabbani has accused 
Golboddin Hekmatyar, the prime minister of that country, of 
triggering the current round of fighting and the war during the 
past two years. He reiterated that he would not accept the 
opposition's request to give up power. 
  According to a Central News Unit report from Kabul, Rabbani, 
who was speaking during 'Id al-Adha prayers among his supporters 
in Jabal Saraj, north of Kabul, claimed: The government's 
resignation today would lead to chaos in the country. At the 
same time, the Afghan president said that if a grand council 
[shuray-e bozorg] were to be formed by the representatives of 
the people of Afghanistan, he would unconditionally accept the 
decisions of that council on selecting a president and a 
cabinet. He called for the cooperation of all factions for the 
formation of such a council in 40 days' time, when his term of 
office comes to an end. 
  The rival factions in the Afghan war are observing a 
cease-fire on the occasion of 'Id al-Adha. Kabul and the rest 
of Afghanistan's towns and cities have been calm so far.

  [Text] Afghan Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar [as heard] 
rejected yesterday's proposal by Borhanoddin Rabbani, the 
president of that country, about the formation of a grand 
decision-making council in Afghanistan within the next 40 days. 
  Hekmatyar, who was speaking at an interview with the Central 
News Unit in Kabul, said the motive behind forming that council 
was to extend the term of the presidency of Borhanoddin Rabbani 
and prolong the war and killings in Afghanistan. 
  He also declared his agreement with the formation of a 
coalition government and powersharing between the country's 
political parties and groups. 
  The Afghan prime minister also called for the holding of 
general elections in that country by a neutral government 
acceptable to all political parties and groups, but did not 
refer to the manner of forming that neutral government.

<F P=106> [Address by President Borhannodin Rabbani on the occasion of </F>
the 'Id al-Adha festival on 21 May; place not given -- read by 
announcer] 
  [Text] Dear listeners: Esteemed Professor Borhanoddin 
Rabbani, president of the Islamic State of Afghanistan, has 
delivered a radio speech on the occasion of the auspicious 'Id 
al-Adha. It was transmitted at 1200 today. Now we draw your 
attention to the Pashto text of the speech. 
  In the name of God the compassionate, the merciful. Faithful 
compatriots, brothers and sisters, peace be upon you. I 
congratulate you honorable, afflicted, Mojahedin, brave, refugee 
faithful and patient Afghans and Afghan Hajji who right now 
fulfill the sacred duty of Hajj, and all Muslims of the world on 
behalf of myself and the leadership board. 
  'Id al-Adha is the great day of success and test that God 
put 
before two of his true slaves, revered Ibrahim Khalilollah and 
revered Ismail Dhabihollah. The submission and full obedience 
of those two obedient slaves of God to fulfill the order of God, 
and also of those who truthfully make efforts to carry out the 
orders and instructions of God, is a manifestation of the 
kindness of God. By the better observance of this 'Id, the 
people of Afghanistan reaffirm their intent to carry out the 
orders and instructions of Almighty God. 
  Dear compatriots, the people of Afghanistan, especially the 
afflicted, patient, and faithful people of Kabul, mark the 'Id, 
which are naturally days of religious happiness, unfortunately 
in [words indistinct] conditions and a situation that is the 
product of the inhumane and anti-Islamic conspiracies of a group 
of traitors to the country elements. Since the establishment of 
the Islamic regime in our beloved country, basically the people 
should have been living in tranquillity and security. But those 
groups and elements who see their interests in problems and 
tense situations many a time prevented the establishment of 
stability and security in the country by conflagration of war, 
and have inflicted on our Muslim and afflicted people much pain 
and suffering. 
  The coup d'etat of 1 January 1994, which was an anti-Islamic 
and anti-nation failed criminal attempt, took place in such 
circumstances that the state was completely ready for 
understanding with related sides, while they were clearly right 
at the outset saying that they had started a coup d'etat. Those 
remarks of theirs are recorded in all home and foreign news 
networks. But after the failure of the putschists in their 
sinister goals, they now allege that the Islamic state continues 
the fighting, while the whole nation and the world are 
completely aware about who started the coup d'etat and the 
fighting by those elements. There are irrefutable documents in 
this respect. 
  The incidents of the past two years and especially the coup 
d'etat of the anti-Islamic and anti-nation triangle proved that 
fighting is not a solution. Those who insist on a military 
solution will gain no benefit from this other than the 
shortening of their political lives. Therefore, political 
understanding and talks for the solution of problems will be 
respected. While in a completely tangible military advantage, 
on the basis of a peaceful strategy, the state strongly believes 
that through talks and respect for the will and wish of the 
people a confident way can be found for the solution of 
problems. The Islamic state believes that the decision and view 
of the people is the best testing field to separate right from 
wrong, and can issue their resolution and determination about 
the circumstances of problems and their future. 
  The people strongly condemn war and warmongers. The people 
hate those who ruthlessly and savagely attack residential areas 
and innocent and defenseless people with heavy weapons. The 
people consider those who block roads to prevent the supply of 
material needed by the people in the cities and residential 
areas the enemies of Islam, the country, and the people. The 
people consider those who have are the cause of foreign 
interference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan a means in 
the hand of the aliens, and the enemies of independence, 
territorial integrity, and national sovereignty of the country 
and historic pride of Afghanistan. Therefore, it is not 
surprising that those kind of people who are afraid of the 
people's judgement and will, because they think if they 
respected the right of the people to determine their fate, will 
face political elimination. 
  The Islamic state is of the opinion that only the people 
have the right and power to decide about the election of their 
country's political leader. No group and force should attempt 
to count itself as the people, impose their will as the will of 
the people. Thus, in our opinion, the practical way to resolve 
the problems and the method of ensuring lasting peace and 
security are to go to the people's votes, because this act is 
customary in the whole free and contemporary world where people 
are referred to for the election of the future leader of the 
country and its political structure. 
  Therefore, a gathering of the representatives of people is 
to 
be convened that will be proportionally participated in by all 
nationalities and tribes of the country and the followers of all 
schools of thoughts [mazhab]. This gathering of the people's 
representatives can be called a Loya Jerga, [word indistinct] 
Shura, constituent assembly, or by another name. To convene 
such a assembly in [words indistinct] a commission will be 
formed of the impartial, peace-seeking, benevolent, and expert 
[ahl-e nazar] personalities. The commission will be financed by 
the United Nations and the Islamic Conference Organization 
[words indistinct]. Esteemed jihadi organizations, commanders, 
ulema and clergy, reconciliation councils, Islamic peace 
delegations, university teachers, and influential tribal and 
social personalities will cooperate in the formation of the 
commission. This commission will set the date of the convening 
of the council and its term of reference, set out the conditions 
and [word indistinct] of the leadership candidates, and will 
present to the council the list of candidates for this position. 
The state elaborates on a comprehensive draft in this respect 
that will be announced after consultation. 
  In order that this movement will continue speedily and 
effectively, it is necessary for a permanent cease-fire to come 
into effect and communication roads to be opened. The 
commission will supervise the openness of the roads and the 
cease-fire. For the sanctity of the 'Id al-Adha, the Islamic 
State declares a cease-fire as from Saturday [21 May] to the end 
of the week. It is to be mentioned that the Islamic State of 
Afghanistan appreciates the sincere and honest efforts that have 
so far been made to ensure peace in the country. The Islamic 
State of Afghanistan very much values the efforts made by the 
Conciliation Council, Ghazni Council, and other peace 
delegations, as well as the efforts of the UN delegation headed 
by esteemed Mahmud Mestiri, and the interest of friendly 
countries that want to play a role in ensuring peace in 
Afghanistan, and hopes for those efforts to be accelerated and 
harmonized so that they very soon lead to such a solution that 
guarantees the interests of the Muslim and free Afghan nation, 
and to ensure peace and security in this country for good. I 
should add that in connection with ensuring peace and security 
in Afghanistan, the Islamic State of Afghanistan welcomes the 
friendly country of Pakistan's sincere efforts that have 
recently been announced by the foreign affairs minister of that 
country. 
  Dear compatriots, as the accepted Islamic custom considers 
'Id days the days of happiness, consider them days of 
establishment of friendship and reconciliation, on the basis of 
this good custom, we too, once again ask those people who want 
to play a role in the solution of the current problems of the 
country and in bringing peace and tranquillity to this land's 
afflicted people, who deserve any pity and assistance, to 
sincerely and truly cooperate in reducing the pains and 
suffering of our country's Muslim and oppressed people, and not 
to try to increase bloody wounds on the body of the afflicted 
people of this land by firing bullets. We hold out our hands of 
sincerity and cordiality to them. We hope that they should too, 
use sensibility and thinking instead of emotions, and to render 
in the interest of peace their Islamic duty and their national 
and historic responsibility, which completely complies with our 
Islamic and Afghan seemly customs, for the cessation of the 
fighting and for all out peace in this country that has suffered 
[word indistinct] of the war and has no strength to endure any 
further (?domination) and pressure. 
  Once again I congratulate you on 'Id. I wish from Almighty 
God [words indistinct] and to enable the Muslim Afghan nation to 
mark the coming 'Ids in an atmosphere of peace, friendship, and 
fraternity [words indistinct]. I wish success and prosperity 
for you in this respect. This word uttered and may God forgive 
you and me. Indeed He is forgiving and merciful.

<F P=106> [Telephone report by political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen </F>
at the Knesset -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [Announcer] Jacques Neriya, the prime 
minister's political adviser, has leveled criticism at what he 
terms picking on trivial details and at the government's being 
swayed by the right wing. Our political correspondent 'Imanu'el 
Rosen is at the Knesset. Good evening 'Imanu'el. What is the 
meaning of the Israeli threat to defer the negotiations? Is it 
not a fact that the Gaza and Jericho autonomy are not going to 
be deferred? 
  [Rosen] Since it is obvious to everyone that the Gaza and 
Jericho agreement cannot be taken back to square one, Israel is 
threatening with whatever it can. But since no date has been set 
for the next stage of the negotiations, the so-called early 
empowerment [preceding two words in English] in the West Bank, 
the threat is not too critical or daunting. 
  Tonight we heard Jacques Neriya, the prime minister's 
political adviser, utter some very intriguing criticism, which 
can be interpreted as criticism of the prime minister himself. 
Neriya told us tonight: They are picking on trivial things; 
you cannot expect 'Arafat to reiterate his commitment every day; 
everyone is aware of the importance of the spoken word in the 
Arab world. Neriya further said: They are being swept by 
public trends, perhaps even by the right wing. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Commenting on 'Arafat's speech at the Johannesburg 
mosque, Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres says that Yasir 'Arafat 
is the first Palestinian leader who is prepared to make peace 
with Israel, and that we have to differentiate between his 
remarks and his deeds. The foreign minister made these remarks 
in an conversation with our Washington correspondent Arye Golan 
at the outset of his U.S. visit. 
  [Begin recording] [Golan] Mr. Foreign Minister, what is 
your comment on the latest disclosure of the tape in which 
'Arafat says in Johannesburg that the agreement is temporary, 
that it is like the agreement between Muhammad and the Quiraish 
tribe? 
  [Peres] First of all, I am not certain that 'Arafat and 
Muhammad resemble one another. They have a different 
explanation, you know. I am not their attorney. I asked 
'Arafat about this, and he explained that the Quiraish tribe was 
the one that violated the agreement, in retaliation to which 
Muhammad violated the agreement with Quiraish. That was his 
explanation. I have no doubt, however, that he was drawn into a 
harmful speech. 
  [Golan] Is he still a partner for peace negotiations, after 
all we have heard about his remarks in Johannesburg, including 
the latest disclosure? 
  [Peres] Look, negotiations are waged by nations, not persons 
-- by the Palestinians and us. He heads the Palestinians for 
better and for worse. 
  [Golan] Do you still believe him? 
  [Peres] I believe in peace. 
  [Golan] Are you saying that what he told you in Oslo is 
sufficient, that he does not have to sign any new commitments? 
  [Peres] No, I am not a notary who writes affidavits. It is 
not my job. 
  [Golan] What is going to happen now? What will happen to 
the government if this man continues making such pronouncements? 
  [Peres] Again, I do not want to be anyone's advocate, but we 
should differentiate between people's pronouncements and their 
deeds. In this century, he was the first Palestinian leader who 
decided to engage in negotiations on the basis of compromise. 
This is the other side of the story. What good was it that the 
mufti, who headed the Palestinians for 43 years, kept saying no, 
no, no? What good was it that for 20-odd years the same 'Arafat 
kept saying no and dealt in terrorism? 
  [Golan] Now he is saying yes and no alternately. 
  [Peres] No, he is doing yes and saying no. I do not want to 
generalize, but we should remember his deeds, not just his 
declarations. 
  [Golan] Don't you feel he is pulling wool over our eyes, as 
they say? 
  [Peres] First of all, no one can pull wool over our eyes, 
because we are not fools. We have the strength to defend 
ourselves. We are not sapping our strength or impairing our 
security one iota. We are making peace because we are strong, 
not because we are weak. This is not peace made by weaklings, 
this is not peace made by a pathetic nation. I feel we are a 
strong, well-organized country which enjoys enormous 
international support, a country which has grown. Militarily, 
we have most of what we need. Therefore, the elements of 
anxiety, fear, or weakness are not at stake here. 
  [Golan] Are you for pursuing the peace process with him, for 
granting them self-rule according to the plan? 
  [Peres] I repeat: Not with him, with the Palestinian 
people. And if a Palestinian authority is established, we will 
have a much broader body to deal with. Today, however, he is 
the spokesman and the leader of the Palestinians, and we must 
remember this for better and for worse. 
  The transition period is difficult. They have a police, they 
do not have a police; they have money, they do not have money. 
But the transition period, too, should be viewed in the right 
light. It is the transition period. 
  [Golan] Thank you very much, Mr. Foreign Minister. [end

  [Text] If Yasir 'Arafat continues to make statements 
contradicting the peace agreement, Israel will not implement the 
next phases. This warning was issued yesterday in the Knesset 
by Police Minister Moshe Shahal, although he added that Israel 
would continue the dialogue with the Palestinians. The minister 
was responding to several opposition motions of no confidence. 
They were all defeated, as we hear from our parliamentary 
reporter David Ze'ev: 
  [Begin Ze'ev recording] Police Minister Moshe Shahal talked 
tough but held back in terms of taking action now against the 
statements of PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat. Shahal told the 
Knesset plenum if the terrorist attacks continue, along with 
statements by 'Arafat and others contrary to the peace accord, 
Israel will continue to talk to the Palestinians but will not 
implement future stages until the PLO -- and here the police 
minister throws in a second issue -- proves its ability to rule 
over Gaza and Jericho in an effective manner. In other words, 
if the PLO does not prove it can control Gaza and Jericho, 
Israel will not hand over the remainder of the West Bank. 
  Shahal called 'Arafat's explanations on what he meant when 
he 
called for a jihad holy war ridiculous, and the police minister 
said 'Arafat's statements run contrary to the exchange of 
letters that led to mutual recognition between the PLO and 
Israel. 
  The toughest opposition speaker presenting a motion of no 
confidence was Knesset Member [MK] Yitzhaq Levi of the National 
Religious Party, who said 'Arafat is spitting in the 
government's face, and the government thinks it is raining. 
Levi said if the government does not stop the PLO chairman from 
entering Jericho, we will have to stop him. Moledet MK Rehav'am 
Ze'evi called from his seat: If he does enter, he will not come 
out alive. [end recording]
