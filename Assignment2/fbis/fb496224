  [Text] Israel has warned the Palestinians that any 
violation of the Gaza-Jericho First agreement will restore the 
status quo ante in the autonomous areas. The warning was issued 
before the Knesset plenum by Minister Moshe Shahal, and its 
wording had been previously coordinated with the prime 
minister's bureau.

<F P=106> [Interviews with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and Likud </F>
Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu by Sayyid 'Abd-al-'Ati, in Tel Aviv 
and Jerusalem, respectively; dates not given] 
  [Excerpt] ['Abd-al-'Ati] My first interview was with 
Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres at a Foreign Ministry 
building in Tel Aviv. Mr. Peres, how do you see the future of 
peace in the region following the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza 
and Jericho? 
  [Peres] There is no doubt that wars have slowed economic 
development in the region. It is in our interest to have an 
economic revival in the region. We are focusing on economic 
development. It is also important for us that the conditions of 
the Palestinians improve because a well-off neighbor will 
certainly be more stable. We are helping the Palestinians as 
much as we can. This does not mean we have withdrawn militarily 
from the land to come back and occupy it economically. 
  ['Abd-al-'Ati] What was your feeling when you saw the 
transfer of authority to the Palestinians? And what will be the 
fate of the rest of the occupied land? 
  [Peres] This is the first time the Palestinian people have 
lived on their land and been in control. I do not know what the 
future will bring. We must continue the negotiations without 
delay. These negotiations should not remain confined to the 
extension of self-rule to other areas, as was the case in 
Washington. They should also deal with the transfer of 
authority in the areas of education, health, social affairs, and 
taxation. I think it is wrong to believe that we can control 
the Palestinian presence in Nabulus, Hebron, and Ramallah, 
situated respectively in the north, south, and middle of the 
West Bank. 
  What matters now is that we are relieved of the burden of 
Gaza. When I hear of the sense of relief among our soldiers who 
were dispatched to face the rock-throwers there, I say: Our 
soldiers have been brave but thank God it is over. 
  ['Abd-al-'Ati] Israel insists that Jerusalem will remain its 
eternal capital and the Arabs counter that with their own claim. 
How do you see this issue being resolved? 
  [Peres] Jerusalem does not represent a problem for us now. 
It is unified from the political side and divided from the 
religious side. There is full freedom of access to all Jewish, 
Christian, and Islamic holy places. Religious shrines must be 
respected and we protect and guard them. 
  We have signed an agreement with the Vatican by which Israel 
will protect Christian shrines. We are ready to sign a similar 
agreement with the Islamic world. Jerusalem was never an Arab 
capital. The Jewish people have never had any capital but 
Jerusalem (!!) [punctuation as published] 
  ['Abd-al-'Ati] Why has there been no progress on the Syrian 
track? 
  [Peres] The Syrians are very hardline. President Hafiz 
al-Asad does not want to do what President al-Sadat did. We do 
not know how long al-Asad wants to wait. Seventeen years ago 
the problem was simple and Syria would have achieved a better 
deal. But it seems that President al-Asad wants to take his 
time. All this time is being wasted. But I believe Syria will 
ultimately follow in Egypt's footsteps and begin open 
negotiations with Israel. 
  ['Abd-al-'Ati] Israel talks a lot about peace guarantees and 
security arrangements but it does not trust the Arabs. Still, 
Egypt is an Arab country and for the past 17 years there has 
been no violation of the Camp David Accords. Why is Israel, 
then, afraid of peace with Syria? 
  [Peres] Yes, Egypt is committed to peace with Israel and is 
even playing a major role in the region to narrow differences. 
The question is: Why is Syria not following Egypt's example? 
The problem with the Syrians is that they want to get to where 
Egypt is without following the same path. 
  ['Abd-al-'Ati] How does Israel feel about Islamic violence 
in Egypt? What is your view of the future of peace between 
Egypt and Israel? 
  [Peres] Evidently the emergence of Islamic extremism 
threatens all the peoples of the region. The situation in Iran 
shows that Islamic extremism has solved nothing. I believe the 
extremists and fundamentalists entertain the illusion that they 
can solve their countries' problems if they assume power. 
  ['Abd-al-'Ati] The Dayr al-Sultan issue [a church in 
Jerusalem at the center of a dispute between Egyptian and 
Eritrean Copts] is one of the pending issues between Egypt and 
Israel. Why didn't the Israeli authorities intercede to solve 
it when an Israeli judicial verdict was handed down to give Dayr 
al-Sultan to the Egyptian Copts? 
  [Peres] The problem is not between us and Egypt but between 
Egyptian and Eritrean Copts. 
  ['Abd-al-'Ati] The Israelis seized the keys of the church 
and 
handed it to the Eritreans. There is a judicial verdict in 
favor of the Egyptian Copts. 
  [Peres] A ministerial committee will discuss the problem and 
decide. 
  ['Abd-al-'Ati] Next I met Benyamin Netanyahu, the Likud 
leader and successor to Yitzhaq Shamir, in a suite in the 
Holiday Inn in Jerusalem. I asked: The voting in the Knesset 
on the Gaza-Jericho Agreement demonstrated strong opposition by 
the Likud Bloc. Why are you opposed to peace? 
  [Netanyahu] The Likud is opposed to the Declaration of 
Principles agreement known as the Gaza-Jericho Agreement but is 
not opposed to peace. The Likud signed the peace agreement with 
President al-Sadat at Camp David in 1977. And the Likud started 
the peace process with the Arab countries concerned at the 
Madrid Conference. So what is said about us is untrue. 
  ['Abd-al-'Ati] Then why do you reject Israeli withdrawal 
from 
the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area? 
  [Netanyahu] No Israeli withdrawal should take place before 
confidence is built between the Palestinians and Israelis. This 
also applies to the Golan. I do not trust the security 
arrangements being worked out with the Arabs. I will give you 
an example: Iraqi President Saddam Husayn used to embrace the 
amir of Kuwait and repeatedly declared that he would not enter 
or occupy Kuwait. What did Saddam Husayn do afterward? He 
occupied Kuwait. So how can I believe any talk about peace 
between us and the Arabs unless we build confidence and bridges 
between our peoples. They will merely be speeches full of air. 
A genuine peace is one that is built through confidence between 
the peoples. Naturally, the Arabs and Jews need time to build 
this confidence. 
  ['Abd-al-'Ati] In your view, what is the future of peace in 
the region after the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho? 
  [Netanyahu] There are many questions that should not be 
asked 
now, not before we give peace a try. We are waiting to judge 
the Palestinians. We want to build confidence between the 
peoples first and then discuss the peace process and what might 
happen. 
  ['Abd-al-'Ati] Does this mean that if the Likud assumes 
power, it may revoke the agreement signed between the 
Palestinians and the Labor Party led by Rabin? 
  [Netanyahu] This is untrue. The Israeli people agreed on 
this accord. We are discussing building confidence and the 
Palestinians should comply with the agreement. 
  ['Abd-al-'Ati] The Israelis insist that Jerusalem is their 
eternal capital and the Arabs also insist that Jerusalem is the 
capital of the Palestinian state and that they will not cede 
Jerusalem. Your comment? 
  [Netanyahu] Jerusalem is Israel's eternal capital and there 
will be no going back. We will not even accept partitioning the 
city. Let us give peace a chance, for there is a long way to go 
and there are other issues before the negotiating committees.

  [Excerpts] Lebanon has complained to the Security Council 
about Israel's abduction of Mustafa al-Dirani. The complaint 
was submitted as Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres was meeting UN 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali in New York. Peres said 
Yasir 'Arafat has to make clear his commitment to all elements 
of the Declaration of Principles [DOP] and express opposition to 
the use of violence in relations with Israel. From New York, 
Judy Lessing reports: 
  [Begin Lessing recording] Foreign Minister Peres told Mr. 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali about Israel's relations with Lebanon, 
Syria, Jordan, and the Palestinians, and he said a high priority 
is the building of the new Middle East. He said it is Israel 
which must make the tangible concessions, and Israelis need to 
know there is a new Middle East. 
  The secretary general assured Mr. Peres the United Nations 
has a sincere interest in the peace process in the region, and 
he has offered UN help to promote it, though he did not give 
many specifics. He did talk about the possibility of setting up 
some kind of apparatus to oversee UN agencies, the World Bank, 
and the International Monetary Fund, as the funds promised for 
the Palestinian self-ruling authority are made available. 
  Foreign Minister Peres says that Israel is pleased its 
relations with the United Nations are improving, but he said he 
would like to see more progress, and he told the secretary 
general Israel wants to become a normal, full participant in the 
United Nations. For example, he said, Israel is willing to 
contribute to peacekeeping operations, and though the government 
would have to approve any contribution of forces to say, Angola, 
this could be a possibility. At a time when the United Nations 
is having serious problems getting skilled troops for its 
operations, this should have been a welcome suggestion. 
  It is almost certain the question of where Ron Arad is was 
discussed when Mr. Peres and Mr. Butrus-Ghali had a private 
meeting before their aides joined them. [passage omitted] [end 
recording] 
  Addressing the Israel Policy Forum, Foreign Minister Peres 
said that with peace in the Middle East, the threat of nuclear 
weapons will be eradicated. 
  [Begin Peres recording] We shall have a Middle East free of 
the danger of war. We shall also, I hope so, have a Middle East 
free of the danger of the nuclear threat. But it must be in 
this order. You cannot build a second floor before you have the 
first one. When the Egyptians in particular are demanding that 
Israel will sign the NPT [Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty] and 
so on, we are asking them privately: Gentlemen, are you going 
to guarantee that Iran is okay, Iraq is okay, Libya is okay? 
What are you talking about? You cannot have it done partially. 
Their nuclearization is invisible. Otherwise it does not 
exist. If we shall have a different Middle East, we shall have 
a different policy concerning the nonconventional arms. [end 
recording]

<F P=106> [Report by 'Amira Segev] </F>
  [Text] Time and time again Likud Chairman Binyamin 
Netanyahu has been rescued by current events from the need to 
directly respond to the harsh criticism leveled by his party 
associates. It happened against last week. 
  In retrospective, the assault on Netanyahu seems to be a 
well-planned military operation. True to the routine he repeats 
every two to three months, Ari'el Sharon tried to check the 
party's pulse by launching a direct assault on Netanyahu in a 
Qol Yisra'el interview, in which he charged Netanyahu with 
failing to lead the Likud as a militant opposition. Sharon's 
remarks were carried prominently on two newscasts, but were 
forgotten as soon as the unofficial tape of 'Arafat's 
Johannesburg remarks arrived. Another item that drowned in the 
ocean of reactions to 'Arafat's declarations was the story of an 
anti-Netanyahu mutiny which almost broke out in the Likud after 
Netanyahu blatantly left the Knesset plenum during the vote on 
the peace plan; this story was exposed one week after the fact. 
  The following day, Sharon exposed "the establishment of the 
first organized group since the primaries seeking to replace the 
Likud chairman." Sharon said: "Together with several 
colleagues, I am planning moves designed to establish a more 
appropriate Likud leadership soon." 
  The following day the level of the Sharon-David Levi talks 
rose from tete-a-tetes in the Knesset members' [MK's] cafeteria 
to official meetings in Tel Aviv. Political correspondents were 
notified of a meeting after it took place, but the communication 
came with the abject denials of David Levi -- who has been 
persistently refusing to be interviewed on the Netanyahu subject 
-- and with an evasive denial delivered on behalf of "Sharon's 
confidants" (a quick poll conducted among Likud MK's did not 
reveal a single name which could fit in this category). The 
denial maintained that the conversation dealt merely with 
political issues and their future repercussions. Since a lethal 
terrorist attack took place on the day after the meeting, the 
matter petered out again. 
  "All these events," Netanyahu says, "are an attempt by a few 
frustrated party activists and a few bored journalists to make 
headlines. It is not serious." 
  [Segev] Are you satisfied with your standing in the Likud 
then? 
  [Netanyahu] Satisfied? Satisfied is not the right term. I 
am not worried. [end Netanyahu] 
  About a month ago Netanyahu asked YEDI'OT AHARONOT for an 
interview in order to publicly apologize to David Levi for 
having accused him in the famous tape affair. As will be 
remembered, Levi's reaction was: "Too little. Too late. He 
should apologize to the entire nation." "Netanyahu is acting 
out of the depths of history," senior Likud officials 
rhapsodized off the record. 
  Limor Livnat, formerly from Sharon's entourage and 
currently one of the three MK's officially identified with 
Netanyahu, says Netanyahu is preoccupied with planning, not with 
history. "Netanyahu wanted to show the Likud voters that he was 
taking action, that he was trying to unite the ranks, and if he 
fails, everyone should know who is to blame," she says. The 
same explanation lies at the foundation of this week's 
establishment of the political Likud forum, to which ten MK's, 
including Sharon and Levi, were invited. A party spokesman 
says: "Now everyone will see who does not want the Likud to 
function properly." Sharon and Levi did not come to the forum 
meeting. 
  "There is no serious activity against Netanyahu," Me'ir 
Shitrit, Dan Meridor, Beni Begin, Limor Livnat, David Magen, 
Moshe Qatzav, Mikha'el Eytan, and Ehud Olmert say. None of them 
is able to name a single person capable of mustering a 
75-percent Central Committee majority, which is required for any 
step from amending the Likud constitution and deciding to hold a 
convention more than once every four years, down to a decision 
to repeat the primaries. 
  One of these MK's says: "Netanyahu has exhausted the early 
enthusiasm with his election, and he has most likely established 
his standing until after the next elections in two and a half 
years. Although two and a half years are a long time in 
politics, I do not expect Likud figures with contrasting 
interests to unite, not even to topple Bibi Netanyahu -- 
although some of them truly believe this is the most dire need 
of the hour." 
  Thus, there is apparently no anti-Netanyahu activity at the 
moment, but the intensity of the charges against him -- voiced 
by the radical right wing in and outside the party, by moderate 
party members, and even by his own people -- is growing. 
Radical Likud figures, such as Ari'el Sharon and Dov Shilansky, 
accuse him of sloppy action against the government peace moves 
and of relegating the struggle over the integrity of Eretz 
Yisra'el to the Council of Jewish Settlements in Judaea, 
Samaria, and Gaza. Central Committee members, such as Meridor, 
Begin, and Shitrit, claim that Netanyahu is the victim of 
squabbles between Yehoshu'a Matza and Tzahi Hanegbi, who are 
competing over proximity to him and are provoking him, with the 
assistance of his close aide Yvette Liberman, to extravagant 
proclamations in the style of Ari'el Sharon and Rehav'am Ze'evi. 
Begin and Meridor, for instance, refuse to attend mass 
right-wing demonstrations and to fly slogans such as the 
"Treason Government" and "Rabin Is a Traitor." The two men do 
not disguise their demand that the Likud action follow its own 
course of action, rather than toe the line with Ze'evi. 
  Meridor refuses to comment on frictions in the Likud in 
general and Netanyahu's standing in particular. Begin, on the 
other hand, issues temperate statements about Likud unity and 
the need to back the elected leader. Shitrit, on his part, 
claims that Netanyahu's belligerent, unbridled allusions to the 
peace process "removed the Likud from the public debate on the 
issue and made the party totally irrelevant in this context. If 
Rabin achieves a peace package including Syria and Jordan before 
the elections, the Likud, as it is now, will be unable to 
survive. Today the party is paralyzed. There is a feeling that 
it is a one man's party, and there is no sense of togetherness. 
  "Despite that," Shitrit says, "I will not lend my hand to 
any 
move seeking to unseat Bibi. He is the man until the next 
Knesset elections. Until then, we must help him to succeed, 
because his success is the success of the Likud." 
  The anti-Netanyahu arguments recently heard in his own camp 
stem from his undermined public image. Netanyahu likes American 
methods, and public opinion polls are his beacon. And the 
latest polls -- one of which was published last Friday -- show 
that his popularity is waning. "If this is the situation," one 
of the most prominent Likud headquarters functionaries says, 
"perhaps he is really not the man who will bring the Likud back 
to power. He attracted great support and was elected by a vast 
majority. If he is doing so badly in the polls, and the polls 
are what matters, then perhaps we made a mistake." 
  Several weeks ago, the Channel 2 Television Network prepared 
a report marking Netanyahu's first year in office. Many Likud 
MK's, including Shitrit, Sharon, Levi, Qatzav, Meridor, Begin, 
Nisim, and Magen were invited for an interview. The only one 
who came was Yitzhaq Shamir. "I do not attach great importance 
to talk against Bibi Netanyahu," the former prime minister said 
in that report. "Opposition and subversion existed during 
Begin's and my time, too. The elected chairman should focus only 
on vital issues." Shamir refused to answer a question on how he 
explains the fact that barring him, no one agreed to make 
complimentary remarks about Netanyahu. 
  Meridor refuses to comment on frictions in the Likud in 
general and Netanyahu's standing in particular. Begin, on the 
other hand, issues temperate statements about Likud unity and 
the need to back the elected leader. Shitrit, on his part,

explains the fact that barring him, no one agreed to make 
complimentary remarks about Netanyahu. 
  Even if there is no organized opposition to Netanyahu 
within the Likud, there are more than enough initiatives which 
could be construed that way. Since last November, MK David 
Magen (a former Sharon follower) has been promoting the notion 
of Dan Meridor as leader of the Likud, trying to summon a party 
convention in 1995, and calling for the reelection of officials 
at all levels. 
  Meridor categorically denies being involved. "I did not ask 
or initiate anything," he said. "It was the initiative of 
Magen, and I believe, also of Ya'aqov Verdugo. I asked them to 
get me out of it at once. At the moment, I am not running. In 
due course, if the matter comes up I may consider it." And what 
about Magen's initiative to summon a party convention? "He has 
never discussed the issue with me," Meridor says. A political 
correspondent says that Magen recently told him: "Things will 
be interesting in the summer. You had better be prepared for 
the summer." 
  [Segev] MK Magen, what did you have in mind? 
  [Magen] What I had in mind is that my efforts to summon a 
party convention would be demonstrated in the summer. Politics 
is too dynamic an art to have it reassessed only once every four 
years. The Likud should not become fossilized, and all its 
levels should be put up for reelection every two years. 
  [Segev] Did you officially raise this initiative? Has 
Netanyahu reacted to it? 
  [Magen] Not yet. I am now working on the issue, so far 
without results. I cannot yet demand it officially. Also, I do 
not know what Netanyahu's reaction was to what he has already 
heard. 
  [Segev] Does it have to do with your initiative to promote 
Dan Meridor as leader of the party? 
  [Magen] I have never said I had such an initiative. 
  [Segev] So, you do not have such an initiative? 
  [Magen] I am only saying that I have not yet raised it 
anywhere. 
  [Segev] Your initiative to summon a party convention is 
perceived as a move against the chairman of the Likud. 
  [Magen] My effort is positive, not negative. Any other 
comment will only harm my initiative, which I consider very 
important. 
  [Segev] Do you have supporters? 
  [Magen] I do not operate in a vacuum. 
  [Segev] How do you operate? 
  [Magen] I use persuasion. I persuade people in key 
positions in our party branches. I hope we will manage to 
advance the idea. [end Magen] 
  "One convention more, one convention less," Binyamin 
Netanyahu responds, "what difference will it make?" 
  [Segev] Even with the candidacy of Dan Meridor--who overtly 
opposed your move to stalk out of the Knesset plenum during the 
vote on the peace agreement--hanging in the background? 
  [Netanyahu] If that is what you call "opposing me," then it 
is not serious. My relations with Dan are excellent, and this 
is not the first time that he has voiced views opposed to mine, 
especially on this issue. [end Netanyahu] 
  The Likud's failure in the Histadrut labor federation 
elections did not contribute to Netanyahu's position. He took a 
lot of criticism on the issue, among others from Limor Livnat, 
who is considered a follower. "Whatever I said after the 
failure I also told him to his face, loud and clear," says 
Livnat. 
  [Segev] Will you second Magen's initiative? 
  [Livnat] I supported Beni Begin's move to have an additional 
round of primaries before the Knesset elections. The Likud 
Central Committee's decision not to have such a round remains in 
effect, and as far as I am concerned, this is the end of the 
story. 
  [Segev] And you have no problem with it? 
  [Livnat] Anybody planning a move against Bibi Netanyahu will 
be damaging the Likud. That does not prevent me from leveling 
criticism or make me automatically agree to everything. On the 
Histadrut elections Bibi made a mistake, and I told him as much. 
This does not mean that I will lend a hand to rebellion and 
defiance. No way. 
  [Segev] Does the Likud have an alternative to Bibi 
Netanyahu? 
  [Livnat] He was only chosen a year ago. What's the big rush 
to throw the party into a frenzy? I keep hearing about absurd 
initiatives, such as to bring back Moshe Arens, the man who got 
up and left the Likud one minute after it was beaten. People 
who have not come to terms with their defeat in the primaries 
feel frustrated and resentful, by way of "if we go down, we will 
take you down with us." 
  [Segev] How is the party dealing with this? Is it up in 
arms over it? 
  [Livnat] You could say it does not make life easy. [end 
Livnat] 
  Ehud Olmert is also opposed to coming out against Netanyahu. 
"I am against any action which might harm Bibi," says Olmert. 
"He was elected, period. Such actions create a self-fulfilling 
prophecy. People predict his downfall, initiate moves to bring 
it about, and when they succeed they say: We told you so, he is 
on his way out." 
  Says a senior Likud official off the record: "Constant 
subversion by these two lesser players against the head of the 
pyramid has become chronic. They did the same to Shamir and 
Begin. Magen joined them about six months ago; they embraced 
Shitrit's harsh criticism of Netanyahu and accorded a measure of 
certain elegance to the whole affair. All the rest is 
constructive and legitimate criticism. As far as Bibi is 
concerned, the broader the forum the larger the support for him. 
His lowest support is in the Knesset, and his broadest is among 
the Likud's 180,000 registered voters. Levi and Sharon have no 
support from the ranks, and this was confirmed in all recent 
confrontations. Sharon has no followers at all, while among 
Levi's followers I have heard grumbling that because of his pet 
peeves they were left behind and were not given any jobs." 
  "I do not wish to discuss the issue of Bibi Netanyahu at 
all," David Levi says. 
  [Segev] So, what was the reason for the meetings with 
Sharon? 
  [Levi] Where are those meetings being held? In the 
cafeteria here, right? 
  [Segev] So, are you doing it to anger everybody? 
  Levi laughs. "You said it."

Hebron aimed at apprehending armed Hamas [Islamic Resistance 
Movement] fugitives. Two terrorists were detained, and the body 
of another terrorist was discovered under the debris of a house 
which was demolished. The security forces are searching for the

  [Text] The door of the old synagogue in Jericho has been 
broken and its lock shattered. Local yeshiva students blame the 
Palestinian policemen for the act. Major General Ilan Biran, 
commander of the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] Central Command, 
visited the place and said the issue is under investigation. 
Answering a question, Maj. Gen. Biran said that according to the 
agreement, every Israeli citizen is entitled to carry arms in 
Jericho. Our correspondent notes that the yeshiva students in 
the synagogue are armed. 
  Meanwhile, the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is banning 
Israeli 
vehicles from entering Jericho. Even the passage of military 
vehicles through the city requires a special permit. Our 
correspondent Moti Amir assesses that this is done in order to 
prevent unnecessary friction during 'Id al-Adha and the 
celebrations accompanying the opening of the Palestinian 
security service office in the city.

  [Excerpt] The United States is urging Israel to ratify the 
international convention on the elimination of chemical weapons 
[CW] within a few months. Israel will respond to this U.S. 
request, which was recently received here, by the end of the 
month. The Defense and Foreign Ministries are preparing to hold 
consultations on the reply. 
  On 22 May, a discussion on the Chemical Weapons Convention 
[CWC] was held at Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres' office. 
Israel signed the convention in January 1993. In its reply to 
the United States, it will presumably announce that since the 
ratification date is not until next year, Israel will not 
address the issue at the present time. To prevent the CWC from 
harming its security and to ensure a Middle East free of 
chemical weapons, however, Israel will demand that Arab 
countries also sign the convention. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Commentary by 'Aqiva Eldar in Washington: "Where Are </F>
Israel's Friends?"] 
  [Excerpts] If Bill Clinton does not do "something" about 
Bosnia, he might find a senate resolution on his desk this week 
forcing him to lift the embargo imposed on Bosnia. Facing a 
weak President, the U.S. Congress, probably one of Israel's most 
important strategic and political assets, is gaining strength 
the likes of which it has not had since the low days of Richard 
Nixon. 
  Congressional involvement in determining U.S. foreign 
policies has already had an impact on the peace process. And 
yet, there are no signs that Israel is aware of the depth of the 
change in the balance of power between the legislative and the 
executive branches in Washington or the impact this might have 
on the Middle East peace efforts. [passage omitted] 
  For many years, mainly during the Yitzhaq Shamir era, Israel 
and the Jewish lobbies specialized in recruiting congressmen to 
repel pressure by the U.S. Administration for political 
concessions by Israel. 
  Since then, the Israeli and U.S. administrations have 
changed, and the term "friends of Israel" in Washington has 
taken on a new shape. Clinton and Rabin are blessed with 
relations of friendship and understanding cultivated through the 
peace process. The term "U.S. pressure" was filed away, and the 
watchdogs on Capitol Hill have become almost non-essential 
(with, of course, the exception of defense and civilian aid, and 
other matters not directly related to political issues). 
  Nevertheless, this space was not left empty. Marginal, 
though loud and effective, right-wing Jewish groups -- well 
guided by the settlers and Likud activists -- are garnering the 
support of American officials for initiatives that aim to foil 
the peace moves by the two governments. They had 82 senators 
sign a letter calling on Clinton to veto the UN Security Council 
resolution regarding the Hebron massacre, designed to the get 
the PLO back to the negotiating table. 
  An ephemeral organization called the Zionists of America 
found 15 senators from constituencies densely populated by Jews 
and turned them into watchdogs over the PLO. Their duty is to 
hold on to every slip by Yasir 'Arafat in order to disturb the 
U.S.-PLO relations and the continued negotiations on the fate of 
the West Bank. 
  Official, elected Israel chose to remain vague. Often (as, 
for example, during the struggle against the appointment of 
Strobe Talbott as deputy secretary of state) the congressmen 
believed that Jerusalem is pleased that its work is being done 
by others. The members of the congress did not hear a clear 
Israeli Government stand regarding the monitoring of the PLO or 
the veto on the condemnation of the Hebron incident. 
  The only Middle East-related initiatives they could find 
were 
those of the right. This, therefore, was the only way for them 
to demonstrate their friendship to their Jewish voters. These 
very days, some two dozen senators pledged to the right-wing 
activists that they would work to foil the initiative of placing 
U.S. troops on the Golan Heights in the framework of a peace and 
withdrawal agreement between Israel and Syria. 
  A new poll conducted among Jewish communities found that 88 
percent support the Israeli Government's peace moves. This 
contradicts the claim that the game is rigged, that U.S. Jews 
are leaning to the right, pulling their congressional 
representatives in that direction. Even if the findings had 
been slightly bolstered, there is a great political might there. 
Once the Israeli Government decides on its course of action, it 
will find a wall-to-wall coalition supporting it in Washington.

  [Text] Baghdad, 19 May (INA)--The newspaper AL-THAWRAH has 
said that renewing and perpetuating the unfair embargo on Iraq 
will continue to be a U.S.-Zionist wager blessed by the 
humiliated henchmen in the region in order to peddle evil and 
suspicious U.S.-Zionist schemes. 
  In an article today, the paper, the mouthpiece of the Arab 
Socialist Ba'th Party, says: Regardless of this renewal and 
continuation of the embargo, Washington knows well that Iraq is 
not an easy prey and that Iraq will continue to be a thorn that 
bleeds the enemies' soft spot, deprives them of sleep, and 
obstructs their plans. 
  The paper says that despite all the conspiracies concocted 
against its principles, Iraq will continue to adhere to its 
leadership and to care for its unity. Iraq is capable of 
foiling all the evil greed by further patience, steadiness, and 
perseverance. 
  AL-THAWRAH continues: We do not pin much hope on lifting the 
unfair embargo through a Security Council resolution. Instead, 
we wager on Iraq's continued patience and perseverance in order 
to fragment and terminate the embargo. The paper stresses that 
all signs confirm that [word indistinct] is with us and that 
what appears on the surface in terms of conspiracies and renewed 
embargo are only futile attempts.

  [Text] Baghdad, May 20, INA--Baghdad Mayorality has called 
upon international and humanitarian organisations the world over 
to take a swift action to save Iraq's environment and treat 
environmental pollution that poses major threats to the lives of 
Iraqi people. 
  In a press conference held recently, Baghdad Mayor Tahir 
Muhammad Hassun shed light on the environmental hazards that 
ensured from the direct and indirect effects of the U.S.-led 
aggression against Iraq. In an urgent call to international and 
humanitarian organisations all over the world, Mr. Hassun urged 
for an immediate action to save the Iraqi environment. 
  The "Baghdad Call" aims at attracting the world's attention 
to the great damage inflicted by the U.S.-allied war and the 
continuation of the economic sanctions, the mayor said. He 
added that Iraq's environment has been greatly affected by the 
barbaric bombing by allied forces during the U.S.-led military 
aggression, indicating that the destruction of electric power 
faculties and water and waste water treatment plants has led to 
a cycle of contamination. 
  The mayor added that Baghdad is calling for help because the 
embargo has greatly affected the level of municipal services, 
noting that Baghdad is some 900 square kilometres in area and 
has a 4.5 million population. He said Baghdad city is divided 
into some 1.3 [figure as received] municipal units has some 467 
residential quarters. The mayor added that due to the 
continuation of the embargo the average water delivery has 
decreased from 45 liters per capita per day (L/C/D) before the 
war to reach some 18 liters per capita per day after the war. 
  The mayor elaborated that severe damage has been inflicted 
upon water and waste water treatment plants. Moreover, fresh 
sewage is either overflowing in the streets or being discharged 
into the Tigris and the Euphrates without any treatment. 
Furthermore, allied bombing of roads and lack of spare parts 
needed to carry out maintenance because of the sanctions had 
caused cracks in sewer lines which in consequence caused ground 
water contamination. Many of these systems are either out of 
operation or operated at a reduced capacity because of pump 
breakdown, said the mayor. 
  The ultimate threat is posed by the large quantities of 
sewage which flow untreated into the country's two major rivers 
and run downstream. These rivers, the Euphrates and Tigris, 
constitute the main water sources of the country, said the 
mayor, adding that some 50 per cent, that is some five cubic 
metres per second sewage water is being pumped directly into 
rivers. 
  He added that Baghdad outskirts are still suffering from 
lack 
of potable water, noting that about one-third of Baghdad city 
lacks waste-water treatment system due to the stoppage of work 
on sewage and waste-water treatment projects due to lack of 
spare parts and materials due to the sanctions. 
  Moreover, the work of waste collecting vehicles is hampered 
by lack of maintenance and spare parts causing in consequence 
heaps of garbage in residential quarters of Baghdad, noting that 
the number of workers has also decreased from 6332 to some 2500 
ones. 
  Solid waste disposal has been disrupted, consequently 
causing 
air pollution because people often tend to incinerate rubbish, 
said the mayor. 
  Mr. Hassun added that the sanctions have also brought work 
on 
renovation project of Baghdad city of a standstill, noting that 
work on the said project has started in 1980s. He added that 
the project aims at renovating and refurbishing ancient and 
historical sites and holy shrines and historical mosques and 
churches. 
  Mr. Hassun warned of the spread of epidemics saying that 
people of Baghdad city suffer from the wide spread of epidemics 
resulting from environmental pollution, the accumulation of 
garbage and lack of municipal services, noting that Baghdad 
hospitals hae reported a noticeable increase in communicable 
diseases. 
  The mayor urged health organisations the world over to act 
swiftly for lifting the 45-month-old economic sanction imposed 
on Iraq.

<F P=106> ["Standpoint" column by 'Isa Isma'il al-'Abbadi: "The </F>
Blockade Wall Will Collapse Whether They Like It or Not"] 
  [Text] Those who follow international affairs know that few 
states have carried out UN Security Council resolutions. 
Because, very often big power interests influence the issuance 
and implementation of these resolutions. 
  Perhaps, Iraq is foremost among world states that have 
responded positively by fulfilling its obligations under UN 
Security Council Resolution 687, as admitted by UN Special 
Commission Chairman Ambassador Rolf Ekeus, who acknowledged 
Iraq's full cooperation with the council. 
  The question now is: Since the United States pressured the 
council to pass that resolution in order to impose an unfair 
blockade on the Iraqi people, and it has kept demanding for 
several years that Iraq must first implement that resolution, 
which links the lifting of the blockade to Iraqi fulfillment of 
its obligations under the resolution, and since the United 
States has spoken clearly in those terms, why is it now raising 
political issues and aims that have nothing to do with 
Resolution 687, whose Paragraph (22) permits Iraq to export oil 
once it has fulfilled its obligations? 
  This clearly shows that Washington is pursuing a double 
standard policy and that it will not hesitate to commit the most 
hideous crimes, such as the unfair blockade it has imposed on 
the Iraqi people, in order to achieve its aggressive designs 
against peoples that struggle for their freedom and dignity. 
  It is now clear to the whole world that two standards are 
being followed with regard to UN resolutions: First, an 
objective standard that calls for strict implementation of a 
clear resolution, and this is the standard upheld by the 
majority of world nations and most UN Security Council member 
states. Second, a standard based on a hostile and biased 
attitude toward Resolution 687 in order to harm the Iraqi 
people, and this is the dirty standard followed by the United 
States, the Saudi and Kuwaiti rulers, and other pro-U.S. regimes. 
  These vile people do not care about anything in the world 
other than devising the most hideous ways in order to harm the 
Iraqi people and to commit crimes against them. 
  Resolution 687 is clear and frank. It places certain 
obligations on Iraq as well as on the Security Council. Now 
that Iraq has fulfilled its obligations, justice, fairness, and 
international legitimacy and legality, which Washington often 
brags about, oblige the Security Council to honor its 
obligations toward Iraq by lifting the unfair blockade, which is 
no longer justifiable following the removal of all the causes 
which are supposed to have led to the passing of Resolution 687. 
  Washington's procrastination and attempts to circumvent the 
resolution in order to bar the council from honoring its 
obligations toward Iraq by lifting the unfair blockade, and its 
claim about "a constant Iraqi threat" in order to blackmail 
Saudi and Kuwaiti rulers and to plunder the wealth of the Arab 
people, who have been afflicted by those traitorous rulers, are 
poor and ridiculous excuses which cannot maintain any form of 
stability and security in the region, and they will certainly 
not guarantee the legitimate interests of Washington and other 
powers in the region. 
  The wall of the blockade will certainly collapse through the 
solid will of the Iraqis and their great leader Saddam Husayn. 
The unfair ones will only reap failure and disappointment.

  [Text] Baghdad, 24 May (INA) -- BABIL has asserted that the 
only way for America and its allied reactionary forces to 
promote regionalism is by crushing the innocent masses through 
destructive crises, such as civil wars, armed rebellions, 
starvation, disruption of security, and lack of justice. 
  In an article today, the paper wonders: Why do the United 
States, Saudi Arabia, and the Egyptian regime want a cease-fire 
in Yemen, although they are fanning the flames of crises, wars, 
and divisions and are trying to partition Sudan and Iraq? Why 
did they sow the seeds of rebellion and nurture them until they 
grew in certain quarters in southern Yemen and are now trying to 
stop the fighting? 
  The paper asserts that anyone who thinks that America and 
its 
agents in Riyadh and Cairo think about preventing Arab bloodshed 
is deluded and influenced by the hostile, misleading media. It 
is enough to see how the United States provides weapons to, and 
protects the separatists in southern Sudan, northern Iraq, and 
southern Yemen, to ascertain that the United States has 
sanctioned the spilling of Arab blood and made it cheaper than 
water and oil. 
  The paper adds that America's major interest lies in 
perpetuating the Yemeni crisis in the form of various continuing 
bloody conflicts that extend over a long period of time so as to 
destroy the basic ideals in the citizens' minds and make them 
harbor personal grudges against each other. 
  The paper notes that the Yemeni unionist forces' adoption of 
military action to decide the situation and their rejection of 
any settlement is a direct blow to the U.S. scheme because this 
checks the other steps aimed at pushing the masses toward an 
inferno of regional grudges and revenge. Thus, regionalism will 
be limited to the separatist faction in Aden. 
  The paper adds that Yemen's step is in the right direction 
and complements the Mother of Battles when the Iraq of Saddam 
Husayn denied America and the Zionists the chance to partition 
Iraq. 
  BABIL concludes that the appeal for a cease-fire in Yemen is 
merely a U.S.-Zionist-reactionary attempt to save the forces of 
apostasy and prolong the suffering in order to remold the 
psychology of the masses to accept the reality of secession as 
the best of all the bad choices.

  [Text] Two British firms have declined to export drugs for 
heart diseases to Iraq on the pretext that these drugs could be 
used in the arms industry! 
  In a research she presented at a seminar on the Arab family, 
which was held recently by the Arab Women Federation, Dr. 
Ittihad Salih Mahdi 'Ammash said that several British and U.S. 
firms have declined to export drugs considered essential for 
saving patients' lives, especially drugs for heart diseases, 
diabetes, and cancer, in addition to other medical requirements, 
due to pressure from their governments on the pretext that some 
of these drugs enter into the arms industry. 
  Dr. 'Ammash said: A roomful of heart disease pills would not 
be sufficient to produce a single hand grenade. So, you can 
imagine the fallacies of those states and their false claims 
about human rights. 
  Dr. 'Ammash affirmed that the Health Ministry has signed 
contracts and paid money in hard currencies for the purchase of 
those drugs from private sector firms in order to save patients' 
lives, but those states have declined to export them. This has 
led to the death of thousands of patients with those diseases, 
she added. 
  According to the research, Iraq used to import $500 million 
worth of drugs annually. Now, however, and especially in the 
next three years, Iraq will only be able to obtain $100 million 
worth of drugs, including those which are received as aid. So, 
one can imagine the suffering of Iraqi patients.

<F P=106> ["Windows" column by Diya' Hasan: "The Nation is Strong With </F>
Iraq, Not Without It"] 
  [Text] Hafiz al-Asad's foreign minister Faruq al-Shar' has 
discovered at last that Arab suffering is due to the 
deterioration of Arab solidarity. He cited as examples the 
situation in Somalia, the blockade on Libya, and the conditions 
of the Palestinians under occupation. However, he completely 
ignored the suffering of the Iraqi people, as if he has not 
heard of the criminal blockade on Iraq due to that 
deterioration, for which his regime is largely responsible. 
  The Syrian minister knows very well that his regime has 
never 
stood for the unification of ranks and the building of a base 
for solidarity. On the contrary, his regime has stood against 
everything that is pan-Arab, and its leaders have sided with 
those who covet the nation and their actions have centered on 
foiling all efforts toward Arab solidarity. They imposed a 
blockade on Iraq and its people long before the foreigners did. 
Their ban on the flow of Iraqi oil through Syrian and Lebanese 
territories and ports preceded Washington's blockade of Iraq by 
10 years. Hafiz al-Asad's cooperation with Bush and his 
participation in the 30-state aggression against our people 
explains the nature of his regime, which is against everything 
that is Arab and is hostile to Arab national awakening. 
  What twisted logic is Hafiz al-Asad's minister trying to 
propagate when he insists on ignoring the suffering of the 
Iraqis? What kind of Arab solidarity can he propound in the 
absence of Iraq and amid the involvement of his regime and 
others in the continuation of the blockade on our people? He 
thinks that people are so stupid that they have not realized 
until now that the Syrian regime is playing its role exactly as 
planned, and that a settlement, as desired by Washington and 
with the participation of the Syrian regime of course, can only 
take place in the absence of Arab solidarity and Iraq. But for 
how long will that continue? This is the important question. 
Since the failure of the aggression, events have confirmed 
that no one can overlook lraq's power and ability. It is an 
asset to the nation's continued existence and awakening. Iraq 
is here to stay, O minister of Hafiz!

  [Text] The Kurdistan office of the Supreme Assembly of the 
Islamic Revolution in Iraq [SAIRI] has stated that the popular 
resistance forces in the south have ambushed a unit of the 14th 
brigade currently deployed in al-Basrah marshlands. An 
intelligence service car was destroyed and its crew, including a 
lieutenant, have been either killed or wounded. 
  A statement issued by the SAIRI office two days ago said 
that 
the popular resistance forces launched a major attack against a 
commando unit inside the al-'Amarah marshlands. The regime's 
troops were forced to retreat, leaving behind many dead troops 
and several destroyed vehicles. The regime's artillery pounded 
areas in [word indistinct], killing a civilian and injuring four 
others.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Adnan Husayn: "Armed Clashes Renewed Between </F>
Kurdish Parties in Northern Iraq"] 
  [Text] London -- Two years after the first general free 
multiparty elections in Iraqi Kurdistan (yesterday was the 
anniversary), an increasing number of Iraqi Kurds feel 
frustrated and disappointed as armed clashes between Kurdish 
parties continue for the third consecutive week resulting in 
major human and material losses as well as disruption of normal 
life and appearance of signs of foreign intervention in Kurdish 
affairs. Independent Kurdish sources told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT 
yesterday that the fighting which began at the beginning of this 
month between the militias of the Kurdistan Democratic Party led 
by Mas'ud Barzani and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK] led 
by Jalal Talabani has resulted in hundreds of military and 
civilian casualties, both dead and wounded, and similar numbers 
taken prisoner, in addition to serious material losses. The 
sources said that tension returned in the past few days after 
last week's guarded calm during which the leaders of the parties 
of Barzani and Talabani tried in vain to implement agreements 
they had reached for stopping the fighting and normalizing the 
situation. 
  Sources have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that fierce fighting 
broke out yesterday between the two parties in the strategic 
city of Shaqlawah near Irbil, the capital of the Kurdish region, 
and, according to some other sources, widespread clashes have 
been going on for days in the eastern areas near the border with 
Iran between PUK forces and forces of the Islamic Movement of 
Iraqi Kurdistan [IMIK] and Hizballah, the two Islamic 
organizations suspected of receiving financial and military aid 
from Iran. 
  The sources also said that a prominent member of Talabani's 
party was killed last Tuesday in an ambush laid by the 
Islamists. They said that Hasan Kawistani, member of the PUK 
leadership, and 16 of his companions were killed in the Hajj 
'Umran area northeast of Irbil near the border with Iran when 
they were on their way to a meeting with local officials of 
Barzani's party. 
  The same sources said that the population in Irbil, 
al-Sulaymaniyah, and other Kurdish cities are facing increasing 
shortages of food, medicine, and basic services because of the 
suspension of transport movement on the road linking the two 
biggest Kurdish cities with Zakhu near the Turkish border, 
through which the Kurds received most of their food and medical 
needs.

  [Text] Irbil, 21 May (INA)--Reports from Irbil have said 
that clashes between the cliques of Talabani and Barzani resumed 
today in the district of Shaqlawah, the summer resort of Salah 
al-Din, and some neighborhoods in the city of Irbil. These 
clashes claimed the lives of dozens of innocent citizens. Many 
people from both sides were also killed or wounded. 
  In the past two days, the Talabani group attempted to attack 
the elements and centers of the clique of the so-called Islamic 
Movement in Halabjah and nearby areas. The group, however, 
achieved nothing. It recently cut the power supply of this area, 
which is fed by power generators from the city of 
al-Sulaymaniyah. 
  The Talabani group said that Hasan Kuwistani [name as 
received], Political Bureau member of Talabani's party, and 
seven other party members were killed in the Hajj 'Umran sector, 
and that the killers mutilated his body and used a car to pull 
it before people in Hajj 'Umran.

  [Text] Ankara, May 20 (AFP)--Mas'ud Barzani, head of the 
Kurdistan Democratic Party, Friday appealed for a ceasefire 
between his forces and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan in 
Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq. 
  "I appeal to all the parties to stop the war and end the 
Kurdish bloodshed," Barzani said in a statement received by AFP 
in Ankara Friday. 
  The Patriotic Union, led by Jalal Talabani, and the 
Democratic Party have both rejected responsibility for the 
outbreak of fighting Wednesday and Thursday which broke a 
ceasefire agreement signed May 8. 
  Northern Iraq has been under the control of the two 
movements 
since an uprising against Iraqi President Saddam Husayn's army 
at the end of the Gulf War in February 1991. 
  Officials from the Iraqi National Congress, a coalition said 
to represent all Kurdish and Arab groups opposed to the Iraqi 
leader, Thursday accused the Patriotic Union of breaching the 
previous ceasefire agreement. 
  Barzani called for joint efforts with the Iraqi National 
Congress to normalise the relationship. 
  The May 8 agreement, brokered by the Iraqi National 
Congress, 
came after two weeks of fighting in which at least 100 people 
were killed.

<F P=106> [Station commentary: "Freedom for Parliament in Irbil"] </F>
  [Text] Dear listener: You must be surprised at the 
headline because it calls for freedom for the parliament that is 
supposed to be the guarantor of freedom. This appeal has been 
prompted by the fact that international parliamentary figures 
and blocs from various European and other countries have 
recently sent letters to the speaker of the Kurdistan National 
Council, the Kurdistan parliament, in Irbil. The letters call 
on him to hold a parliament meeting to discuss problems 
resulting from the current crisis and the regrettable clashes in 
Iraqi Kurdistan and provide solutions for them. 
  The speaker of parliament responded to these letters, 
explaining the situation as it really is. 
  Respected listeners; Our people's friends from the members 
of world parliaments are, of course, right. What they demand 
should be achieved because logically it is the best way out of 
the crisis if there are attentive people with sound eyes and 
ears. However, the facts on the ground are both comic and 
tragic. The Kurdistan parliament is besieged by war. To make 
what we say more explicit, we say: 
  1. On a momentous hour the night of 3-4 May 1994, the 
fighters of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK] headed for 
the parliament building in Irbil. After disarming and beating 
the parliament's guards, they occupied the building and 
plundered some of the furniture. Then they went to the roof of 
the building and transformed it into a trench for confrontation 
and battles. 
  2. Despite bilateral [as heard] attempts and other attempts 
within the framework of the Kurdistan Front, the PUK fighters 
continued to occupy the building. 
  3. In a report disseminated worldwide on 20 May 1994, REUTER 
correspondent, Mr. (Alistair Belloc), said that the PUK fighters 
are occupying the parliament and other government buildings in 
Irbil. 
  4. The PUK fighters attacked a number of ministries and 
government departments, especially the finance and education 
ministries. They broke doors and looted some furniture. They 
placed barricade over the roofs of these buildings. 
  5. Fighters of the PUK are establishing barricades and 
checkpoints on streets leading to the parliament and Council of 
Ministers buildings, as well as the education, finance, culture, 
and other ministries which are adjacent to each other and very 
close to the parliament building. 
  Thus, it is very difficult to hold a parliament meeting in 
this tense atmosphere and amid these military measures. 
Naturally, we warmly welcome initiatives and appeals by our 
friends from world parliaments and parliamentary blocs in 
various countries. We support presenting problems and tackling 
them in parliament because this is the natural solution of the 
problem. But how can a meeting be convened under the shadow of 
arms and in a tense atmosphere? 
  Therefore, we propose that all fighters should withdraw as 
soon as possible from the roof and from inside the parliament 
building, that the protection of the building should be restored 
to the original guards entrusted with protecting parliament, 
that the stolen furniture be restored to the building, that the 
fighters leave all government departments, and that the 
barricades and checkpoints should be removed from all roads and 
streets leading to the parliament and Council of Ministers 
buildings. Only then will there be an appropriate atmosphere to 
consider convening the parliament so it can exercise its natural 
legislative role in an atmosphere of security and freedom.

<F P=106> [By Nadim Kawash] </F>
  [Text] Abu Dhabi, May 22 (AFP) -- An increase in oil 
revenues and reforms in several Arab countries pushed up 
domestic investments in 1992 to their highest level in eight 
years, an official Arab report said Sunday. 
  Investments in the Arab League's 22 members stood at 112.16 
billion dollars in 1992 compared with 97.97 billion dollars in 
1991, 104 billion dollars in 1990 and 91 billion dollars in 
1985, the report said. 
  The report by the Abu Dhabi-based Arab Monetary Fund (AMF) 
provided no figures in 1993 but economists in the region said 
investments were expected to be lower in 1993 due to a sharp 
decline in oil prices. 
  "From the 1993 budgets in most Arab states, especially the 
Gulf oil-producers, you could see a rise in expenditure but a 
small part was allocated for new projects while the private 
sector still heavily depends on government spending," an Abu 
Dhabi-based economist said. 
  The AMF, the Arab League's main financial institution, said 
Arab oil earnings increased by 10.4 percent to 102.6 billion 
dollars in 1992 from 92.9 billion dollars in 1991 due to 
resumption of Kuwaiti oil exports after the Gulf war. 
  Investments in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq and the United 
Arab 
Emirates (UAE) accounted for more than half the total Arab 
public and private investment in 1992, the study showed. 
  In Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil-producer and exporter, 
they stood at 29.57 billion dollars compared with 22.3 billion 
dollars in 1991. 
  They rose to 7.7 billion dollars from 6.1 billion dollars in 
Kuwait, to 14.19 billion dollars from 13 billion dollars in 
Iraq, and to 7.86 billion dollars from 7.22 billion dollars in 
the UAE, the study showed. 
  Domestic investments also increased in all member states 
carrying out economic reforms. 
  In 1992, they stood at 1.5 billion dollars in Jordan, at 
3.79 
billion dollars in Tunisia, at 8.25 billion dollars in Egypt, at 
6.8 billion dollars in Morocco, and 1.96 billion dollars in 
Yemen. 
  Djibouti and Mauritania emerged with the lowest investment, 
standing at 88.3 million dollars and 180.6 million dollars 
respectively. The report gave no figures for war-battered 
Somalia and the Israeli-occupied territories. 
  "Investment increased in most Arab countries but key oil- 
producers remained by far the main investors," the report said. 
  It showed investment in Iraq, Libya, Algeria and the six 
Gulf 
Cooperation Council (GCC) states stood at 83.6 billion dollars 
in 1992, compared with 28.5 billion dollars in the remaining 
League members. 
  The report showed those nine oil-producers also accounted 
for 
the bulk of public and private consumption, estimated at 265.5 
billion dollars in 1992 of the total Arab consumption of 378 
billion dollars. 
  Government consumption, which includes spending on services, 
stood at 97.3 billion dollars in those nine states, far higher 
than consumption in the remaining members of 20.3 billion 
dollars. 
  The report gave no details of the investments but it showed 
it affected most components of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). 
  The GDP in the non-oil industrial sector grew to 50 billion 
dollars in 1992 from 40.6 billion dollars in 1991, while the 
communication sector increased to 32.4 billion dollars from 31 
billion dollars, 
  In trade and hotels, it rose to 63.9 billion dollars from 
54.7 billion dollars. Agriculture surged to 66.7 billion 
dollars from 57.5 billion dollars and water, and electricity to 
5.77 billion dollars from 5.26 billion dollars. 
  As a result, the total GDP grew by around 9.7 percent to 
483.4 billion dollars in 1992 from 440 billion dollars in 1991. 
Those nine oil-producers accounted for 354 billion dollars, 
nearly 73 percent of the total Arab GDP in 1992.

<F P=106> ["Text" of PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat's speech at a mosque </F>
in Johannesburg, South Africa, on 10 May, edited by Nadav 
Shragay and Yosi Torpstein; all notations between parentheses 
are editors' notes] 
  [Text] In the name of Allah the merciful and compassionate. 
My brothers, I must thank you for allowing my to come here to 
pray together. Allah willing, we will soon pray in Jerusalem, 
the first site (chronologically speaking) of Islam. My 
brothers, it must be understood that after the Gulf war the main 
conspiracy was to completely eliminate the Palestinian problem 
from the international agenda. It was not easy, because our men 
paid the price of the Gulf war, as you know. 
  Our community in Kuwait, which was one of the largest and 
richest, was kicked out of Kuwait. Not only that, but later we 
were presented with the Bush initiative on the Madrid 
conference. And, it was not easy to agree to go to the Madrid 
conference, because of its very difficult conditions. Why? So 
as not to give them a reason and an excuse to ignore the 
question of Jerusalem and the question of Palestine. This must 
be understood. Now, after this agreement, which is the first 
step and nothing more than that, believe me -- a lot remains to 
be done. 
  The jihad will continue. Jerusalem is not only of the 
Palestinian people, but of the entire Islamic nation. You are 
responsible for Palestine and for Jerusalem. "The land that was 
promised to God's fearful." ('Arafat quotes a Koran verse in 
which Allah addresses Abraham on this issue.) 
  After this agreement you must understand that our main 
battle 
is not to get the maximum out of them here and there. The main 
battle is over Jerusalem, the third most sacred site of the 
Muslims. Everybody must understand it. Therefore, I insisted 
before signing (on the Gaza and Jericho agreement in Cairo) to 
get a letter from the Israelis that Jerusalem is one of the 
items for discussion in the negotiations. We are not talking 
about (a discussion of) Israel's permanent status. No. We are 
talking about the permanent status of Palestine. It is very 
important that everybody understand it. 
  In this letter, which they wrote and I have in my possession 
although I have not divulged it so far, I insisted that they 
mention that we are responsible for all the holy sites, 
Christian and Muslim. I insisted that the name of the Christian 
holy site be mentioned before the name of the Muslim holy site, 
because I must be faithful to the agreement between Caliph 'Umar 
Ibn-al-Khattab and Patriarch Sophronius. Therefore, I insisted 
that they mention in the letter the Christian holy places next 
to the Muslim holy places. 
  Here we are, and I must speak candidly. I cannot do it on my 
own, without the help of the Islamic nation. And I cannot say 
like the Jews: You and your god fight alone. No. You must 
come to fight, to begin the jihad to liberate Jerusalem, your 
first shrine. It is very important. Therefore, me and my 
colleagues insisted on mentioning in the agreement that the 
negotiations about Jerusalem will start no later than the 
beginning of the third year, and that immediately after the 
signing of the agreement we will start the negotiations about 
Jerusalem. About the future of Jerusalem. 
  You saw me when I hesitated (in the signing ceremony in 
Cairo). I did it because I insisted on mentioning Jerusalem. I 
did not want this promise from Rabin, but from the two 
cosponsors of the process, Christopher and Kozyrev, and the 
witness, President Mubarak. And this was done. Everybody must 
understand that there is a constant conspiracy against 
Jerusalem. As mentioned, in the next three years, 
(negotiations) will start no later than the beginning of the 
third year. They (the Israelis) will try to wipe out and change 
the demography of Jerusalem. This is very important. 
  We must be very careful and give it priority, because there 
is no higher priority than Jerusalem. We must give it top 
priority, not just as Palestinians and not just as Arabs, but 
also as Muslims and as Christians. I mentioned it before to the 
Archbishop of Canterbury. I told them that if they want the 
Holy Sepulcher and the Christian holy sites they must not only 
talk to the Israelis but also to the Jews. 
  We are not against the Jews. We must remember what the Koran 
says: "Within the people of (the prophet) Moses there is a 
nation (a group) that believes in justice and lives by it." For 
your information, there are two Jewish sects in Palestine: The 
Samaritans in Nabulus and the Neturey Karta in Jerusalem. They 
refuse to recognize the State of Israel and regard themselves as 
Palestinians. I am saying this to prove that their statements 
that Jerusalem is their capital are wrong. It is not their 
capital. 
  It is our capital and yours. It is the first most sacred 
site of Islam ('Arafat is referring to the first sacred place to 
which the Muslims turned in their prayers; later the direction 
of their prayers was changed to Mecca). But, we need your 
support. This is the message of the people in Palestine and our 
population in Jerusalem. They are calling on you and on 
everybody everywhere. I am sure that sooner or later we will 
pray in Jerusalem, together. 
  I regard this agreement as no more than the agreement signed 
between our prophet Muhammad and the Quiraish (tribe) in Mecca 
('Arafat is referring to the Treaty of Hudaibiya in the year 628 
in which Muhammad promised peace for 10 years, but violated it 
two years later when he conquered Mecca which had been ruled by 
the Quiraish). We must remember that Caliph 'Umar refused to 
accept this agreement and considered it "an inferior peace 
agreement." However, the prophet Muhammad accepted it, and we 
now accept the peace agreement, but (this) in order to continue 
on the way to Jerusalem. Together and not alone. 
  We must say clearly that circumstances are very, very 
critical. I will give you one example. Do you remember what 
happened after the massacre in Hebron? For 22 days the UN 
Security Council hesitated to pass a resolution condemning this 
massacre. Do you remember? Twenty-two days because of one word 
I insisted on including in this resolution; (namely, adding to 
the term) "the occupied territories" (the words) "including 
Jerusalem." They tried to argue with me to omit Jerusalem, but 
I refused and got my way. 
  Once again, I must thank you from the bottom of my heart and 
I am speaking to you with sincerity, from one brother to 
another. We need you as Muslims and as mujahidin (jihad 
warriors). It is a pleasure for me to thank my old friend and 
elder brother, Nelson Mandela, for inviting me to visit South 
Africa for the first time. 
  My presence here is part of your struggle. I am telling him 
on your behalf and on behalf of the Islamic nation that we will 
be by his side, and we are sure he will continue to be by our 
side. Once again, I must say "they will enter the mosque as 
they entered it before" ('Arafat is quoting a Koran verse). 
Until victory, until Jerusalem, until Jerusalem, until 
Jerusalem.

  [Excerpts] Tunis, 16 May (KUNA) -- The Embassy of the State 
of Kuwait in Tunis today denied that there are Algerian good 
offices for what is described as clearing the air between Kuwait 
and the Iraqi regime, on the occasion of a tour to the recent 
Maghreb countries by Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad, first deputy prime 
minister and foreign minister of Kuwait. 
  In a statement, a copy of which was received by KUNA, the 
Embassy expresses "Kuwait's rejection of the attempt to link 
Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad's tour and the message which the head of 
the Iraqi regime sent to the Algerian president." [passage 
omitted] The Embassy statement affirms that relations between 
the State of Kuwait and the Iraqi regime are ruled by 
international legal resolutions which Iraq must observe, instead 
of making open attempts to contain them and evade implementing 
them.

  [Text] New Delhi - The Government is hoping to tighten the 
enforcement of copyright laws against pirated video films and 
radio cassettes through new training programmes to educate 
police and customs officials on the intricacies of intellectual 
property rights. 
  Come November, a series of seminars will be held in Delhi in 
collaboration with the World Intellectual Property Organisation 
in Geneva for senior levels of the police and customs 
departments. 
  These seminars will shift later to the states for the 
benefit 
of junior officials. 
  The Centre is also planning to request the states to set up 
a 
Copyright Enforcement Cell which will oversee the enforcement of 
the copyright laws. 
  Briefing newspersons on the amended Copyright Law passed by 
Parliament last week, the Additional Secretary in the Education 
Department, Y.N. Chaturvedi admitted that the Law was a 
"braintwister". Its implementation was faulty, he said mainly 
because the police, which is the enforcing agency, did not have 
a basic knowledge of its provisions. 
  Regarding the recent Amendment, Chaturvedi said it would 
have 
"far reaching effects" in protecting the intellectual property 
rights of creative artists, particularly the poorer and more 
vulnerable ones. 
  One of the important changes introduced by the Amendment is 
redefining what constitutes a copyrighted musical work. The 
Amendment moves away from the traditional British definition 
that musical compositions had to be written of notation to 
warrant copyright protection. 
  Since much of Indian music is not in the form of graphic 
notations, the identity of a musical composition will now be 
through its author, Chaturvedi said. 
  In addition, the Amendment for the first time gives rights 
to 
performers such as snake charmers, acrobats, conjurers, actors 
and singers, making it mandatory for anybody to seek their 
permission for a video or audio recording. 
  Computer programmes, cinematograph films and sound 
recordings 
have also been brought under the purview of the Act with the 
Amendment. 
  Another first is the introduction of the mechanism of 
collective registration for creative artists. By forming a duly 
registered society, these artists can fight for their rights 
against exploitation by economically powerful producers.

<F P=106> ["Word of Love" column by Muhammad al-Hayawan] </F>
  [Excerpts] The government could end its troubles, be 
happy, and make others happy if it would accept the formation of 
a medical and judicial committee to investigate the reasons for 
the death of lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani. Any result from such 
an investigation would be to its favor. If the death were 
natural, caused by asthma, there would be no problem. If it 
were natural, caused by other reasons, death is something 
inevitable and there would be no case. If there were an injury 
that resulted in death and the Interior Ministry brought the one 
responsible to trial, this could serve as a model of justice. 
In the past the Interior Ministry has brought more than one 
officer to trial on charges of attacking citizens. This improves 
the image of the police and is considered a sign of respect for 
the feelings of people. The government could gain a great deal 
as a result of this. [passage omitted] 
  Resorting to the prosecution and the courts does not tarnish 
the image of the police. It would show that the government 
respects human rights and wants justice to be done. It also 
would end the complaints that some people have against the 
government. It is true that terrorists must be dealt with 
firmly if they try to resist or attempt to resist. Our 
disagreement with the government is on its measures for 
detaining people and the need to respect human rights during 
questioning. It is better for the government to capture people 
alive, because they can provide information. 
  The Egyptian Human Rights Association issued a statement 
about the incident which did not make any specific charges, but 
expressed doubts. Nothing can remove these doubts except a 
neutral judicial- medical investigation. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin says he will demand 
from Yasir 'Arafat to reaffirm in writing his commitment to the 
peace agreement signed earlier this month. 'Oded Ben-'Ami, the 
prime minister's spokesman, said that 'Arafat's speech in 
Johannesburg casts doubts on his sincerity with regard to the 
peace agreement. Ben-'Ami noted that Israel will put off the 
negotiations on the second stage of the agreement with the 
Palestinians until the PLO consolidates its rule in Gaza and 
Jericho. 
  In response, PLO member Jamil al-Tarifi said that any delay 
in the implementation of the next stage of the autonomy will 
constitute a deviation from the agreement.

  [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz has stressed that 
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher was mistaken on many 
of the issues that he discussed in his article, which he wrote 
from Saudi Arabia, published in THE NEW YORK TIMES on 28 April. 
In a reply published by THE NEW YORK TIMES today, Saturday, 
Tariq 'Aziz explained that the first mistake that Christopher 
committed was his characterization of the states calling for 
lifting the siege imposed on Iraq as just some states. The 
deputy prime minister said that the states calling for a change 
in the policy on Iraq, particularly the immediate lifting of the 
economic blockade, include numerous UN Security Council member 
states, Arab states, and Iraq's neighbors, especially Jordan and 
Turkey, which are suffering from the blockade imposed on Iraq. 
He added that the official statements of the Special Commission 
and the International Atomic Energy Agency conflict with 
Christopher's remarks that Iraq has not complied with its 
commitments toward the UN Security Council. 
  Tariq 'Aziz explained that the UN Security Council failed to 
issue its president's traditional statement because the U.S. 
representative objected to recognizing the progress that has 
been made by Iraq. Meanwhile, he noted, other UN Security 
Council member states, including three permanent members, 
insisted on the need to recognize this progress. He indicated 
that Mr. Christopher's assessments do not represent the 
viewpoints of the majority of the UN Security Council member 
states. 
  Tariq 'Aziz called on the U.S. secretary of state to check 
the U.S. State Department's records to learn of the U.S. 
intervention to prevent Kurdish leaders from signing an 
agreement with the Iraqi Government in the summer of 1991. He 
explained that the Iraqi Government agreed with six Kurdish 
parties, including those led by Mas'ud Barzani and Jalal 
Talabani, on a comprehensive agreement for autonomy in the 
Kurdish region. However, Edward Djerejian, assistant secretary 
of state under James Baker and Warren Christopher, prevented 
Talabani from signing the agreement on the pretext that such an 
agreement would bolster the government of President Saddam 
Husayn. 
  Tariq 'Aziz added that the U.S. State Department's records 
testify to those facts. In addition, all partners to this event 
are still alive. 
  In his reply to Christopher's article, Tariq 'Aziz said that 
the comprehensive blockade imposed on Iraq since 1990 has left 
Iraq with no choice but to depend on itself, especially with 
respect to food production. Therefore, all national resources 
have been mobilized to implement development projects in the 
marshlands area in southern Iraq. He explained that specialized 
U.S., British, Netherlands, and Russian companies studied such 
projects as early as 1950 to reclaim 1.5 million hectares. 
  In a separate development, the deputy prime minister 
stressed 
that a clear progress has been made in the recent UN Security 
Council review of the embargo imposed on Iraq. In statements to 
the director of the Detroit expatriates television aired today, 
Saturday, Tariq 'Aziz said that there is currently a clear 
majority at the UN Security Council adopting a fair position. 
He explained that the U.S. position at the UN Security Council 
uses allegations that do not conform with reality. He said this 
is a position that does not enjoy absolute British support, but 
a limited support for reasons that have nothing to do with UN 
Security Council resolutions. 
  Tariq 'Aziz expressed confidence that the majority of the 
international community now calls for lifting the blockade 
imposed on Iraq. He said that majority of the UN Security 
Council member states, which reflect the majority of the world 
public opinion, have moved toward lifting the blockade. He 
explained that the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait 
worked vigorously before the recent UN Security Council review 
to prevent the council from recognizing the facts. Despite the 
funds that they have spent and despite their false allegations, 
'Aziz added, the majority of the UN Security Council member 
states have adopted positive trend. 
  Relying on facts that he sensed during his recent visit to 
the United Nations, the deputy prime minister expressed 
optimism. He said that after the steadfastness of the Iraqi 
people and their leadership and after facts have become known to 
world public opinion, the call for lifting the blockade is now 
stronger than ever before. 
  On the situation in northern Iraq, Tariq 'Aziz told the 
expatriates television that it is an anomalous situation imposed 
by foreign powers on our Kurdish people and in which armed 
groups took part. He said that those groups are behaving 
irresponsibly and without any consideration for the interests of 
our Kurdish people or for the general national interests. He 
explained that the fighting raging between the Barzani and 
Talabani groups has resulted in hundreds of deaths and in 
disrupting life and public services. Meanwhile, he said, foreign 
U.S. and Iranian interventions are taking place, in addition to 
the Turkish air raids on villages in the area. 
  The deputy prime minister stressed that the northern part of 
the homeland must return to the homeland, and that the 
authority, law, and security must return to the region which 
flourished under autonomy and under the national Iraqi 
leadership.

    [Editorial report] The following review of the 17 May issue 
of Cairo AL-SHA'B summarizes articles that are Islamic in nature. 
<H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>
  1. Lawyers Continue Protests Over Colleague's Death 
  2. President Sued Over Satellite Dishes 
  3. Gaza-Jericho Agreement Denounced 
  4. Islamic Group Denies Killing Copts 
  5. Clergymen To Testify Over Mufti's Rulings 
  6. Islamic Group Members To Be Arrested 
  7. Government Weekly Accused of Stirring Sedition 
  8. Liquidation of Islamic Society Denounced 
<H5>  LAWYERS CONTINUE PROTESTS OVER COLLEAGUE'S DEATH </H5>
  Pages one-three of the 17 May AL-SHA'B are devoted to 
reports 
and articles protesting the death of Lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith 
Madani, allegedly by torture, while in police custody on 26 
April. The collective headline reads: "Lawyers' Uprising: The 
Strike is Successful and a Peaceful March to 'Abidin Palace Is 
Planned Today." Under the headline, the main story notes that 
the Lawyers Association is to organize a "peaceful march" on 17 
May from the association building in Cairo to the Presidential 
Palace in 'Abidin to protest Madani's death by torture at the 
State Security Intelligence Department in al-Jizah. The report 
adds that demonstrators will carry banners denouncing torture 
and demanding the trial of police officers involved in torturing 
Madani. 
  Chief Editor Majdi Ahmad Husayn, in an approximately 
800-word 
article on page one entitled "The People's Wrath Is the Fire 
That Will Burn the Hands of Despotism," refers to the 
forthcoming march and adds that Madani's "assassination" is a 
crime that "must not pass." He explains that if this crime were 
to be allowed to pass unnoticed and its culprits left 
unpunished, more people would be murdered by torture every day. 
Referring to an unspecified State Security Intelligence 
statement, Husayn argues that the statement contains fresh 
incriminating evidence. He explains: "At first they claimed 
Madani died of low blood pressure. Then they announced that he 
died of asthma; this is the first time we have heard of someone 
dying of asthma. Their latest statement was tantamount to 
justifying the murder. And why not, since he was the link 
between the Islamic groups at home and abroad?" Claiming that 
such contradictions smack of a cover-up, Husayn asks why these 
charges were not announced from the start and why the forensic 
report was, as he, states, hidden. Majdi concludes by saying 
that confronting terrorism with torture will only result in more 
terrorism and that using torture to extract information easily 
will provide fertile ground for armed resistance of the 
authorities. 
  An approximately 1,200-word unattributed report by Ashraf 
Khalil on page one describes the contacts among the Lawyers 
Association members and political and judicial officials over 
Madani's death. Khalil notes that the "political leadership has 
summoned" the association's chief, Ahmad al-Khawajah, to listen 
to his argument over the case. Al-Khawajah explained that his 
association strongly suspects that Madani died of torture and 
submitted several demands to contain the situation and the 
lawyers' anger. He demanded that the lawyers see the forensic 
report on Madani's death, that the officers responsible for his 
death be named, and that 35 detained lawyers be released. The 
writer explains that the political and security leaders promised 
to meet the demands but to release only 15 of the detained 
lawyers. In return, the security leaders called on the lawyers 
to be calm and refrain from staging demonstrations. But the 
deal collapsed following the Interior Ministry's statement 
charging Madani in a state security case. 
  An approximately 600-word unattributed report on pages one 
and seven refers to a statement by Amnesty International 
expressing concern over the death of Madani. The statement 
notes that a representative of the organization met Madani 
briefly on 24 April and set an appointment to meet him again the 
same week. But Madani did not show up on time. The 
organization later learned that he was arrested at his office on 
26 April and reportedly tortured to death. The statement adds 
that Madani is said to have been whipped and beaten and to have 
received electric shocks in custody. Amnesty International 
urged the Egyptian authorities to clear up the issue before the 
public, name the people responsible for his murder, if proven, 
and put them on trial. 
  Reports on the general strike observed by lawyers throughout 
Egypt on 15 May to protest Madani's murder are detailed on pages 
two and three. According to the reports, the strike was 
observed unanimously in every governorate and judges sympathized 
with the lawyers by postponing cases scheduled for that day. On 
the same pages, correspondents Ashraf Khalil and Mu'tazz 
al-Hadidi describe a news conference in Cairo at the Lawyers 
Association building in which several association members spoke. 
Mukhtar Nuh, secretary general of the association, revealed 
that the Interior Ministry falsely accused Madani of practicing 
terrorism. He added: "The interior minister, in a bid to cover 
up the murder of 'Abd-al-Harith Madani, named an organization 
discovered a few days earlier and accused the martyr of being a 
member of that organization." The names of 34 lawyers still 
held in custody are listed on page three. A statement by the 
Freedoms Committee in the Lawyers Association above the list of 
names promises that it will no longer tolerate the detention, 
torture, or murder of any lawyers and promises to remain in open 
session unless all the detainees are released unconditionally. 
  Muslim Brotherhood member and columnist Muhammad 
'Abd-al-Quddus, in an approximately 700-word on page 12, salutes 
the association members for their courageous stance in protest 
of Madani's death. He contends that the Interior Ministry's 
statement on Madani's death shows "shortsightedness" in picking 
on asthma as the alleged cause of death instead of a "heart 
attack" or a "brain stroke," which lead to immediate death in 
almost every case. After explaining that the "ruling regime" is 
notorious worldwide for its violation of human rights, he notes 
that Madani's murder has exposed the faults of a regime in which 
the "head of state enjoys almost absolute powers." 
  PRESIDENT SUED OVER SATELLITE DISHES 
  An approximately 1,500-word report by Muhammad Hilal on page 
four notes that Muhammad Mahmud 'Ali Hamid, a lawyer from Upper 
Egypt, has taken the president, prime minister, information 
minister, and interior minister to court for being "in one way 
or another" responsible for allowing the operation in Egypt of 
satellite dishes, which he says take "obscene films" into 
Egyptian homes. Hamid believes that the decisions permitting 
the import of antennas are invalid, since they run contrary to 
Article 2 of the Constitution, which stipulates that Islam is 
the state's religion and that Islamic shari'ah is the primary 
source of legislation, and to Article 12, which obliges society 
to "observe and protect ethics," the people's "national and 
moral values," and "public ethics." He says that "Arab 
countries, the United States, and the Jews operate television 
channels to broadcast purely sexual and homosexual movies to 
undermine the heavenly religions in general and Islam in 
particular." Concluding his lawsuit, Hamid explains: "It is a 
matter of time before these antennas deal a poisonous blow to 
society's creed, ethics, and traditions." He urges the court to 
suspend the decisions allowing the operation and circulation of 
these dishes and to oblige the president, prime minister, and 
information and interior ministers to withdraw those dishes 
already operating from Egyptian homes. The writer explains that 
Hamid approached the mufti's office for a fatwa, or religious 
ruling, on the dish, only to be turned down by officials there 
on grounds that the issues is beyond their jurisdiction. 
<H5>  GAZA-JERICHO AGREEMENT DENOUNCED </H5>
Muslim Brotherhood writer Ahmad al-Malat, in an approximately 
2,000-word article on page five, expresses the Muslim 
Brotherhood's opinion on the "fiasco" at the ceremony in which 
the Gaza-Jericho Self-Rule Agreement was signed in Cairo on 4 
May. Al-Malat suggests that by signing the "deed of submission" 
at the ceremony, 'Arafat thought he was giving a hand to the 
"tough delivery" of the hoped-for Palestinian state, but the 
truth is that the deal will produce nothing but a "self-rule 
locality" housing those left of the inhabitants of the usurped 
Palestine in an area not exceeding 2 percent of the lost land of 
Palestine. Addressing 'Arafat, he says: "The statelet you 
imagine is about to see light will be nothing but a meek lamb in 
a forest guarded by Zionist wolves, who audaciously declare that 
the people left in that area are nothing but cockroaches to be 
squashed underfoot." After reviewing the Palestinian story from 
the establishment of Israel in 1948 up to the 1967 defeat of the 
Arabs by Israel, al-Malat claims that 'Arafat, that day, 
"committed a fatal error and a major sin by recognizing Israel 
as a sovereign state that has a right to exist on the remains of 
slaughtered Palestine." He believes 'Arafat's behavior is the 
result of one of two things: "idiocy or treason." Al-Malat 
adds that 'Arafat has forgotten that "Palestine, including the 
al-Aqsa Mosque and holy Jerusalem, represents a trust in the 
hands of Muslims worldwide, not an item left to the care of the 
PLO to dispose of as it pleases." He adds: "Honesty dictates 
that if the PLO cannot protect this trust, it must return it to 
its owners, not hand it over to the enemy of yesterday, today, 
and tomorrow." He concludes by suggesting that since there is 
no room in Palestine for both Palestinians and Jews, then either 
the land is given back to the people evicted from it or things 
remain as they are. He adds: "Thus there is no choice but to 
carry arms against the aggressor and to try to restore right, 
even if this takes centuries. The jihad is an inalienable 
obligation binding each Muslim until right is restored and the 
invaders are expelled from this dear part of the land of Islam." 
<H5>  ISLAMIC GROUP DENIES KILLING COPTS </H5>
  An approximately 120-word on page 7 refers to a statement 
issued by the Islamic Group denying the killing of Copts in 
Egypt. 
<H5>  CLERGYMEN TO TESTIFY OVER MUFTI'S RULINGS </H5>
  An approximately 400-word report by Sha'ban 'Abd-al-Rahman 
on 
page seven notes that the Cairo Court of Misdemeanors has 
decided to summon al-Azhar Grand Imam Shaykh Jad-al-Haqq 'Ali 
Jad-al-Haqq, other clergymen, and Islamic economic experts to 
testify on Mufti Shaykh Sayyid Tantawi's fatwas on banking 
transactions, the import of alcoholic drinks for non-Muslims, 
and the opening of casinos for tourists. The court's decision 
has come at the request of a team of lawyers defending Dr. 'Ali 
al-Salusi, professor of economy at Qatar University; Dr. Sha'ban 
Muhammad Isma'il, head of the Shari'ah Department at al-Azhar 
University; and 'Ali Faruq, chief editor of the newspaper 
AL-NUR, who have been taken to court by Mufti Tantawi on libel 
charges for challenging his fatwas and calling for his dismissal 
from office for passing rulings that run contrary to the Koran 
and the prophet's tradition. Another court earlier sentenced 
the defendants to a six-month prison term and a fine of 600 
Egyptian pounds but the defendants appealed the court decision. 

<H5>    ISLAMIC GROUP MEMBERS TO BE ARRESTED </H5>
  'Ala' al-Bahhar, in 240 words on page 7, writes that the 
security agencies plan a campaign of arrests among active 
members of extremist groups in the coming two weeks. 
<H5>  GOVERNMENT WEEKLY ACCUSED OF STIRRING SEDITION </H5>
  An approximately 350-word report by 'Adil al-Bahnasawi on 
the 
same page notes that Major General Ahmad Sadiq, chief of police 
in the Upper Egyptian Governorate of al-Minya, has accused a 
governmental weekly magazine of inciting sedition by publishing 
what he says are lies and groundless reports on the Islamic 
groups in his governorate. In a statement to AL-SHA'B, Maj. 
Gen. Sadiq denied reports published in the magazine about the 
Islamic Group's control of al-Husayni Street in al-Minya. The 
security official pointed out: "Some people belonging to the 
Islamic Group rented shops next to the National Democratic Party 
headquarters after obtaining legal licenses from the City 
Council." Their activity has been scrutinized and found to be 
legal, he added. Maj. Gen. Sadiq issued a challenge to prove 
reports in the same magazine, said to be notorious for 
publishing "lies" about the Islamic Group, that the Islamic 
Group orders people in Mallawi, a town in al-Minya Governorate, 
to pay extortion money to the group. He also denied reports 
that members of the group do not permit women and men to ride on 
the same public transport vehicles. 
<H5>  LIQUIDATION OF ISLAMIC SOCIETY DENOUNCED </H5>
  An approximately 400-word unattributed report on page 7 
notes 
that the Labor Party Committee in Alexandria has issued a 
statement on "tragic events" in the al-Wardiyan District. The 
events followed the Alexandria governor's decision to dissolve 
the "Al-I'tisam Bi Habl Illah" religious society, which is based 
at the Abu-'Umar Mosque in Alexandria and supervised by several 
local council members from the Labor Party. The statement notes 
that contrary to the people's desires, the mosque was taken over 
by the Ministry of Social Affairs and a progovernment board of 
directors was appointed to run the society. This, the report 
adds, has angered the people in the neighborhood, who clashed 
with the policemen brought to the area to expel the society's 
legitimate board of directors. The statement called for the 
immediate release of all local council members and citizens who 
were arrested on charges of "rioting."

    [Editorial report] The following review of the 17 May 
issue of Cairo 'AQIDATI summarizes articles that are Islamic in 
nature. 
<H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>
  1. Publishers of Book Criticizing Islam Condemned 
  2. Shop Signs Must Be in Arabic 
  3. Grand Imam To Inaugurate Round of Lectures for Imams 
  4. Reasons for, Options of Repeated Pilgrimage Viewed 
  5. Writer Assails Mufti Over Court Case 
  6. Preacher Recounts Incident of Challenging Extremists 
  7. Satellite Dishes: Moral or Immoral? 
  8. Islamic Ifta' Council: Imams for or Against? 
  9. The Koran at the White House

  11. Saudi Preacher Interviewed 
  12. Copts Congratulate Muslims on 'Id al-Adha 
  13. Writer Laments State of Muslims During 'Id al-Adha 
<H5>  PUBLISHERS OF BOOK CRITICIZING ISLAM CONDEMNED </H5>
  Salah 'Abd-al-Mu'ti writes in a 300-word report on page 1 
about "a new crime committed by the General Book Committee," 
which has published a book entitled "Toward the Real 
Islam--Studies in the Koran Bring to Light the True Islam" by 
Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-'Arusi, a professor at an unspecified 
university. The book attacks some Islamic rites and rituals and 
their timing. The writer also makes some "demands" such as 
"unifying prayer times, the world over, for all Muslims, 
throughout the year." The writer claims his motive for writing 
the book was that "it became evident that we are remote from 
Islam while clinging to its facade and have forgotten its 
essence." The report maintains that the Awqaf Ministry will 
prepare a book to counter these arguments. 
<H5>  SHOP SIGNS MUST BE IN ARABIC </H5>
  A 100-word report by Mustafa 'Alam-al-Din on page 2 says 
that 
Cairo Governor 'Umar 'Abd-al-Akhar has demanded strict measures 
against shop-owners who use foreign languages in their shop 
signs. He threatened to withdraw the licenses of those who 
violate this law. "The language of the Koran, the Arabic 
language which is this country's national language, should be 
respected," the report says. 
<H5>  GRAND IMAM TO INAUGURATE ROUND OF LECTURES FOR IMAMS </H5>
  On page 2 'AQIDATI carries another unattributed 100-word 
report that on 17 May Grand Imam of al-Azhar Jad-al-Haq 'Ali 
Jad-al-Haq will inaugurate "the 25th round for imams and 
preachers of the Islamic world organized by the General 
Secretariat of the al-Azhar Higher Council for the Call." The 
report lists the countries participating as well as the speakers 
and lecturers. 
<H5>  REASONS FOR, OPTIONS OF REPEATED PILGRIMAGE VIEWED </H5>
  Page 3 of 'AQIDATI features an opinion survey by Musa Hal 
and 
Mahmud 'Ushub polling ordinary citizens, imams, and men of 
religion on the issue of the fairness of performing the 
pilgrimage more than once in a lifetime. Islamic shari'ah 
stipulates that pilgrimage once in a lifetime is enough, but 
many citizens travel every year. They have turned pilgrimage 
into what travel agents are calling "touristic pilgrimages." 
The issue here is that the Islamic Conference Organization has 
set quotas on the number of pilgrims that various countries can 
send, giving well-to-do pilgrims an edge over the poor. Among 
other men of religion, the survey poses this question to the 
mufti of Egypt, Dr. Muhammad Sayyid Tantawi, who maintains that 
"those capable of performing the pilgrimage every year should 
give an opportunity to those who have never done so in their 
life." He believes there is nothing in the shari'ah that can 
prevent the issuance of a law on this matter. Other men of 
religion agree with the mufti's opinion and claim that instead 
of performing the pilgrimage a second time, people should donate 
food and money to the poor. To conclude, the survey interviews 
a psychiatrist who analyzes the reasons why people perform the 
pilgrimage over and over again, including such things as habit, 
religious overstatement, and tourism. 
<H5>  WRITER ASSAILS MUFTI OVER COURT CASE </H5>
  In his 400-word column on page 6 entitled "With All 
Frankness," Basyuni al-Halawani maintains that the "Court ruling 
the mufti of the republic, Dr. Muhammad Sayyid Tantawi, secured 
to imprison Dr. Sha'ban Isma'il, Dr. 'Ali al-Salus, and their 
colleague 'Ali Faruq, is not a victory for the mufti in this 
case against those who do not agree with his opinion and oppose 
some of his fatwas and teachings. The real arena for settling 
such a matter is the arena of the intellect, opinion, and 
counteropinion, not in court where only the guilty and deviant 
normally go." Al-Halawani stresses that he does not defend one 
side against the other, but says he is sad at the state of 
affairs our wise men have reached. He reminds the mufti that 
"Islam set the ideal principles and bases for dialogue and 
allowed each individual to express his opinion and ideas in a 
way that does not abuse others." The writer concludes that some 
ulema tend to forget these basic Islamic principles, thus losing 
the people's confidence in them. 
  PREACHER RECOUNTS INCIDENT OF CHALLENGING EXTREMISTS 
  A 200-word unattributed report on page 7 cites a sermon by a 
preacher in which he tells a story that happened to him 20 years 
ago when he challenged the ideology of the Repudiation and 
Renunciation Group as a student in his village in al-Sharqiyah. 
Three bearded men with a great deal of money settled in his 
village, bought many houses and shops, and claimed that true 
Muslims do not need to work since God provides for all their 
needs. At first they had a great following, but he managed to 
expose them by watching them for 24 hours. He found out that 
truckloads of various supplies were being delivered to them at 
0300 in the morning. He informed the residents of the village 
who kicked them out of their village. 
<H5>  SATELLITE DISHES: MORAL OR IMMORAL? </H5>
  In a 3,000-word report on page 8 prepared by Musa Hal, 
questions from citizens on various religious issues are 
answered. One query comes from a young girl in al-Daqahliyah 
Governorate on whether the large-scale use of satellite dishes 
is moral or not. This is answered by Shaykh 'Abd-al-'Athim 
al-Humayli, member of al-Azhar's Fatwa Committee, who is 
flattered by the young lady's concern about such a matter. He 
ascertains that the same law that applies to other media applies 
to the dish. In other words, the use of the dish in itself is 
not bad, but if the programs it brings to the viewer are 
immoral, "then the Muslim state is reponsible for putting an end 
to this." He says: "The West has directed these dishes at us; 
they are dishes for hunger and starvation. There is evil in 
them. This goes against our religion because religion wants 
mankind to improve themselves and elevate their feelings and 
conscientiousness." 
<H5>  ISLAMIC IFTA' COUNCIL: IMAMS FOR OR AGAINST? </H5>
  Jamal Salim's 2,000-word report on page 10 feels the pulse 
of 
various imams and muftis on the establishment of a higher 
council for ifta' [legal jurisdiction] in the Islamic world. He 
cites various religious leaders from Macedonia, Bosnia, 
Belgrade, Singapore, and elsewhere, all of whom support the 
establishment of such a council. "Dr. Muhammad Sayyid Tantawi, 
the mufti of Egypt, also supports the establishment of such a 
council for muftis. He said he will work with all his might to 
establish it" the writer maintains. Al-Azhar University 
President Dr. 'Abd-al-Fattah al-Shaykh has a different opinion 
on the matter, though. He believes that "al-Azhar's Islamic 
Research Center could serve instead of such a council, if 
everyone adheres to its fatwas." 
<H5>  THE KORAN AT THE WHITE HOUSE </H5>
  A 100-word report on page 20 cites a report in the French 
magazine JEUNE AFRIQUE that President Bill Clinton discovered in 
September that there is no copy of the Koran in the White House. 
He was preparing a speech to be delivered at the signing 
ceremony of the peace agreement between the Palestinians and the 
Israelis. One of his aides drew his attention to the fact that 
he had used quotes from the Bible and the Torah, but not the 
Koran. The magazine claims "Clinton used a copy of the Koran 
from one of the libraries in Washington." 
<H5>  WRITER CONDEMNS YEMENI WAR </H5>
  In a 200-word column on page 20, 'Adil Dayf wonders in whose 
interest the internecine fighting in Yemen is taking place. He 
stresses that the sole beneficiaries are "the foreigners, of 
course." The Yemeni people are the losers, as is the Islamic 
world and nation. Dayf says: "We call on the sons of the 
nation to set aside their marginal differences and concentrate 
their efforts on catching up with progress while adhering to 
their religion, which condemns all forms of violence and 
destruction, and always calls for forgiveness." 
<H5>  SAUDI PREACHER INTERVIEWED </H5>
  On page 20 'AQIDATI carries an interview by Mustafa Yasin 
and 
Tariq 'Abdallah with Dr. Mana' Khalil al-Qattan, a Saudi Islamic 
preacher, in which he discusses attacks by Westerners and the 
West's hostility, which are the two most dangerous things for 
Islam now. He also stresses that all Islamic resources should be 
unified to serve contemporary matters. 
<H5>  COPTS CONGRATULATE MUSLIMS ON 'ID AL-ADHA </H5>
  A 400-word article on page 23 by Mamduh Bishri carries 
congratulations to the Muslims on 'Id al-Adha from the Copts of 
Egypt. The column notes that both religions stress love for our 
fellow man. 
<H5>  WRITER LAMENTS STATE OF MUSLIMS DURING 'ID AL-'ADHA </H5>
  In his last-page 500-word column entitled "A Call to Common 
Sense", al-Sayyid 'Abd-al-Ra'uf wishes he could have 
congratulated the Muslim world on 'Id al-Adha with an open heart 
and great hope for the future. He says he hoped the 'Id would 
have come after the Muslims had succeeded in saving their 
brothers in Bosnia, started developing Somalia, helped the 
Muslim minorities around the world, and had a greater say in the 
new world order. "In fact, we were surprised that the 
government crisis in `united' Yemen turned into a civil war", he 
laments.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the Foreign Ministry; date not given] </F>
  [Text] In response to media requests for some reaction to 
the statement issued in the name of the PLO Chairman, yesterday 
(Tuesday), 24.5.94, in the newspaper "AL-QUDS", the Foreign 
Ministry Spokesman has said that the statement is meaningless 
and is invalid. The Spokesman noted that, based on the 
Gaza-Jericho Agreement, neither Arafat nor the PLO has any 
legislative power or authority. According to Article VII of the 
Agreement, this power will be granted to the Palestinian 
Authority -- once it is established and begins operating in the 
field. Even then, legislation must be enacted in coordination 
with Israel. Consequently, this statement has no legal 
validity. All existing military laws and orders remain in 
force, and are binding on all of the parties. 
  Foreign Ministry Legal Advisor Yo'el Singer adds that from a 
legal point-of-view Arafat's statement is a breach of Article 
VII of the Gaza-Jericho agreement and that if indeed there has 
been any attempt on Arafat's part to change the situation, it 
would be invalid. He also noted that 'Oded Ben-Ami, the Defense 
Minister's Media Advisor, is of a similar opinion.

  [Excerpts] Foreign Minister Peres will meet with his U.S. 
counterpart Warren Christopher in Washington today. Prior to 
the meeting, Peres said that in the discussions with Damascus, 
Israel has not yet been given anything tangible. 
  Peres added that Saudi Arabia has recently adopted a 
negative 
attitude. The Saudi Arabian ambassador in Washington, who used 
to meet with Jewish representatives, has vanished without a 
trace. Saudi Arabia has also failed to keep its promise to 
change its position with regard to the Arab boycott. [passage 
omitted] 
  The foreign minister dismissed East Jerusalem press reports 
that 'Arafat has canceled the laws put into force by the 
military government in the territories. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0405 GMT on 25 May 
carries a related report from Washington by Arye Golan, adding 
that "in a meeting with Israeli correspondents yesterday, Peres 
said that if the supporters of peace among the Palestinians do 
not seize control of the self-government areas, there will be no 
point in continuing the negotiations. They should be given a 
chance to organize themselves in the field, however, Peres 
said." The report adds that "as for the future, Peres asserted 
that the Palestinians prefer to continue the autonomy 
negotiations immediately in Cairo and not in Washington."]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi </F>
Beilin by Ya'el Dan and Itay Engel on 25 May; place not given -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Dan] Earlier this morning, we spoke with Deputy 
Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin about the matter of 'Arafat's 
decree canceling Israeli laws in the autonomous areas. We 
started off by asking him whether he agreed with Yo'el Singer, 
the Foreign Ministry's legal adviser, who reacted yesterday by 
saying that 'Arafat was behaving as though he has shelved his 
agreement with Israel and is now doing as he likes. 
  [Beilin] No, everyone can draw his own analogy. I think 
that we are essentially dealing with the agreement's first days. 
There are definitely a lot of problems. There are also a great 
many hopes. I can say that this agreement has granted the 
Palestinians many important things they have never had; however, 
I can also state that Israel has control of all the safety 
valves. Therefore, I refuse to get worked up about every single 
act that may constitute a violation of the agreement, because we 
can ultimately prevent any such violation. 
  [Engel] Dr. Beilin, in one of your previous interviews to 
IDF radio in connection to other statements made by 'Arafat, you 
said that it would be great to have an alternative but, 
regrettably, although 'Arafat is no Mandela, he is all we have. 
Our question is whether you consider that to mean that we must 
always just shrug our shoulders in resignation and plow ahead? 
Are there any red lines that 'Arafat will cross soon, if he has 
not crossed them already? 
  [Beilin] The red line is very clearly written in black ink. 
It is the agreement itself. We will not accept any violation of 
the agreement. Any violation will.... 
  [Dan, interrupting] But we have already seen many 
violations. 
  [Engel] Does his latest decree not constitute a violation of 
the agreement? 
  [Beilin] If it constitutes a violation of the agreement, we 
will not accept it. What do you mean? Does the fact that he 
issued a decree mean that it will be implemented? What is the 
whole agreement about? This agreement really gives us a series 
of measures by which we can prevent many things from happening 
if the other side violates the understandings. Therefore, if a 
situation indeed develops in which the legislation which was 
previously in force becomes irrelevant.... [pauses] After all, 
in the meantime, it is just a decree; the question is what 
happens when it is implemented. We can easily prevent the 
Palestinians from taking any action to implement the decree. 
  [Dan] Perhaps the question is more on the psychological 
level. There is a crisis of confidence between the PLO and 
Israel. With whom did we sign an agreement? With people who 
are in such a hurry to violate it? 
  [Beilin] Well, the psychological aspect is more of an 
individual matter. Those who had complete confidence in the 
other side probably feel less comfortable. Since I belong to 
the camp with low expectations, I do not have complete trust in 
the other side. You quoted my remarks accurately earlier. It 
is true that I regard this agreement as more the product of what 
is possible than of what is ideal. We will have to continuously 
monitor things step by step and check whether the agreement is 
being upheld. Each day brings its own problems. At the same 
time, we must bear in mind that this is the beginning of a very 
complex and historic stage. It would be stupid to view every 
single step as being either the end of the agreement or proof of 
its total success. 
  [Engel] Perhaps it would be wiser to simply say that 
whatever 'Arafat said will not be implemented, because people 
hear his remarks and receive the impression that we are 
incapable of putting 'Arafat in his place. He continues to 
issue these statements, and if the Israeli Government treats him 
like a leader, then it is only natural that people in the street 
will assume that his decrees will be implemented in the field. 
  [Beilin] I am not in any way minimizing 'Arafat's leadership 
of the Palestinian people. I do not take his remarks lightly. 
I am not proposing that we take his proclamations or actions 
lightly. I definitely think that we should continue to monitor 
his statements and actions and take the appropriate action 
whenever the Palestinians violate the agreement.

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has instructed the IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces] to draft contingency plans for possible 
violations of the agreement with the PLO, Deputy Chief of Staff 
Amnon Shahaq told the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense 
Committee. He added that 3,200 Palestinian policemen have so far 
arrived in Gaza and Jericho, some of them from Sudan and Iraq. 
Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] is not taking part in and 
is not cooperating with the Palestinian police, he said. 
  Our correspondent Hayim Hecht reports that Major General 
Shahaq briefed the committee about the investigation of Mustafa 
al-Dirani, a member of Hizballah in Lebanon, and noted he is a 
tough nut to crack. The deputy chief of staff assessed that 
al-Dirani's interrogation will yet continue for a long time.

<F P=106> [News conference by Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin at the </F>
Nahal 'Oz checkpoint in the Gaza Strip -- live; broadcast in 
progress] 
  [Text] ...is linked to this place in the Gaza Strip. 
Approximately 750,000 or almost 800,000 Palestinians live here 
with 5,000 Israelis as opposed to the less than 20,000 
Palestinians living in the Jericho area that will be under the 
control of the Palestinian Authority. I would like to start by 
extending my deepest appreciation to the IDF [Israel Defense 
Forces], the chief of staff, the General Staff; especially to 
the Southern Command and its commander, staff, division 
commander; the operation coordinators and their commanders, for 
the extraordinarily efficient and excellent manner in which the 
difficult and unique mission of the orderly transfer of control 
on the ground from the IDF and the other security forces to the 
Palestinian police and forces -- including those issues 
pertaining to civilian authorities -- was completed. I was 
seriously concerned about the way, form, and order in which 
these steps had to be carried out because although we are 
familiar with the IDF and have confidence in it, we had no 
experience with the other side. As I have learned, a fabric of 
relations has emerged with regard to the important issues in 
order to facilitate the evacuation of those parts of the Gaza 
Strip the IDF withdrew from. This relationship permitted an 
orderly and adequate transfer process. I think that this 
constitutes a beginning that gives rise to hope, and gives the 
Palestinian authorities the chance to translate the 
just-completed transfer into orderly control, if they indeed 
make full use of all their abilities as they did during the 
transfer stage. As far as we are concerned, an important 
chapter in the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho First 
agreement has been concluded. I believe it offers the 
Palestinians a comfortable start. A start that will permit them 
to fortify their rule and bolster their control over the 
population. We are especially sensitive to security aspects, 
both with regard to the security of the Israeli settlers in the 
settlements inside the Gaza Strip and with regard to all issues 
relating to the roads used by the settlers either inside the 
Gaza Strip or leading into Israel; and certainly anything 
pertaining to the IDF activities in the area or to the borders 
between the Gaza Strip and Israel's sovereign territory. In my 
view, the activities, preparations, and implementation as 
carried out by the IDF are simply worthy of the admiration of 
the Israeli public and definitely that of the government and of 
myself as prime minister and defense minister. The Southern 
Command is indeed worthy of all praise. Thank you. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister, it appears 
that relations in the field between the IDF and the Palestinian 
Police do not seem particularly rosy. What briefings did you 
receive at the Southern Command? Can the gaps between the 
parties be bridged? Can the confusion and uncertainty which is 
so prevalent here in the Gaza Strip be resolved? 
  [Rabin] I am sorry to disappoint you. In all that pertains 
to the transfer of authority, I think that things were 
coordinated well. Nevertheless, let us not forget that the 
mechanism stipulated by the agreements is a very complex one of 
coordinating centers which are already operating. There are 
joint patrols and information sharing. Any such 
newly-established mechanism between two parties [two-minute 
break in transmission] 
  ...serious fears. I would like to say that things have 
been carried out much better than I expected. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el's Army affairs correspondent Karmela 
Menashe] Are you satisfied with the IDF's new deployment and 
the security of the settlers? 
  [Rabin] I think that our plans were drafted as best we 
could. The forces deployed accordingly, and I believe we will be 
able to provide maximum security. There is no foolproof 
[previous word in English] security. The IDF is currently in 
full control in Judaea and Samaria. A base murder occurred 10 
days ago near Bet Hagay. The fact that this area is under our 
control did not and cannot absolutely prevent terror attacks. 
Those who think that in the current conditions, before the 
whole system has stabilized, we can make sure that terror 
incidents will not occur does not know and does not tell the 
truth. I am convinced that our deployment and measures, some of 
which are still under construction...[pauses] We arrived here 
after driving along part of a fence under construction which 
will divide between the Gaza Strip and Israeli territory; the 
construction of other measures is still under way. When all 
these are operational, they will provide the best security 
possible. I would like to reiterate that there is no absolute 
security against a terrorist willing to commit suicide or 
against individuals willing to perpetrate terrorist attacks. 
  I would like to add a personal note: I am more than pleased 
that IDF soldiers are no longer hanging out on the outskirts of 
Gaza, the alleyways of Jabalyah and al-Shati'. I consider it a 
great privilege to be part of the government that made the 
decision to get them out of Gaza. 
  [Jerusalem New Channel 2 Television's Roni Daniyel] 
Yesterday, the police minister told the Knesset that if the 
Palestinians do not abide by all their commitments the whole 
process would come to a halt. Could you elaborate on this point? 
  [Rabin] I will clarify our position, as presented by the 
police minister to the Knesset yesterday on behalf of the 
government. We expect all sides to the agreement to fully abide 
by their commitments. A bilateral agreement is based on the 
premise that it serves the basic interests of both sides. 
Therefore, our efforts will be aimed at having all sides abide 
by their commitments. In spite of Palestinian statements which 
could be interpreted as a possible violation of the agreement, 
there will be no unilateral violation. I hope no significant 
violations will occur. Agreements obviously involve two sides 
and are based on the premise that each side must abide by its 
commitments. Otherwise, and I hope this is not the case, Israel 
definitely has all the means to insist that violations be 
rectified. 
  [Indistinct question by unidentified correspondent about 
incidents in recent days with the Palestinian police, including 
today's incident in Jericho] 
  [Rabin] I will first comment on yesterday's incident. In 
the wake of the killing of two IDF soldiers in the southern part 
of the Erez checkpoint on Friday, we imposed a full closure on 
the Gaza Strip and demanded from the Palestinian police to 
station roadblocks 200 to 300 meters ahead of the IDF roadblock 
so that they can be responsible for checking every vehicle 
arriving at an IDF roadblock from the direction of Gaza to 
confirm that the passengers are not carrying weapons. 
  Unfortunately, in contravention of instructions and the law, 
an Israeli vehicle apparently drove into the Gaza Strip 
yesterday, and then drove back toward the Erez checkpoint. At 
our demand, the Palestinian police tried to stop the vehicle. 
When it failed to do so, they aimed their fire at its wheels. 
Nobody was hurt. In this case, the violation was unequivocally 
committed by the Israeli vehicle. 
  As for today's incident in Jericho, I have no accurate 
information. I will not comment on it until I get a report from 
the IDF. 
  [Indistinct question by unidentified correspondent about Dr. 
Ahmad al-Tibi's announcement yesterday that the PNC, the 
Palestine National Council, will be holding its session in Gaza 
to amend the Palestinian Covenant] 
  [Rabin] Referring to the first part of your question, I do 
not know what Ahmad al-Tibi's status is -- to the best of my 
knowledge, he is an Israeli citizen -- and I am not prepared to 
vouch for the extent to which he reflects 'Arafat's positions. 
I only know that the agreement signed in Cairo about the 
implementation of Gaza-Jericho First includes a passage in which 
'Arafat undertakes to abolish those clauses in the Palestinian 
Covenant contradicting the content of the letters we exchanged, 
which led to the mutual recognition between the PLO and us, in 
the first meeting of the PNC and to fulfill all the elements of 
the Declaration of Principles [DOP]. Whether the PNC will meet 
in Gaza and when, I have not received any authoritative 
information about it. 
  Secondly, in order to go ahead with the implementation of 
the 
process beyond Gaza-Jericho First, we will insist that the 
Palestinians demonstrate their ability to fulfill their 
commitments in Gaza and Jericho and reaffirm their commitment to 
the DOP, the Gaza-Jericho agreement, and the letters which led 
to the mutual recognition.

<F P=106> [Interview with Major General Amnon Shahaq, deputy chief of </F>
staff, by Eli Nisan at the Knesset on 24 May -- recorded, in 
Hebrew with Arabic subtitles; processed from the Hebrew] 
  [Text] [Nisan] Two weeks after the implementation of the 
autonomy agreement in Gaza and Jericho, can you say Israel is 
pleased with the way the agreement is being implemented and with 
the deployment of the Palestinian police? 
  [Shahaq] The Palestinian police is in a process of entering 
the territory; this is not completed yet. So far, more than 
3,200 policemen came in, and more are to arrive. Those who have 
arrived, and I saw them on the ground, came from far away. I 
believe they have to study Gaza. They are not familiar with 
Gaza and I do not believe they are familiar with policing duties 
because they have not been policemen for several years. At the 
same time, judging from discussions with the police commanders, 
I can say that the Palestinian police commanders understand they 
need to be effective on the ground immediately and see to it 
that law, order, and security prevail. 
  [Nisan] Do you believe that the PLO will be able to 
establish its control in Gaza and Jericho, vis-a-vis Hamas 
[Islamic Resistance Movement] and the Islamic Jihad, and prevent 
acts of terror against Israel? 
  [Shahaq] I believe that the PLO realizes that if it does not 
establish control over the territory, others will. If others 
control the territory, the PLO will have simply failed. I 
believe the PLO understands this, and it has a vested interest 
in and the ability to attain full control. 
  [Nisan] As the person who conducted the negotiations with 
the Palestinians, do you believe 'Arafat's declarations will 
impinge on the continued implementation of the autonomy 
agreement? 
  [Shahaq] I believe that such declarations do not contribute. 
Just the contrary, they damage the process. It is irrelevant 
which declarations these are. Any declaration that can be 
interpreted in more than o6e way, with some interpretations 
being of the kind we have heard recently -- justifiably, I 
believe -- cause damage. The Palestinian leaders are better 
advised to think twice before they issue declarations. 
  [Nisan] How do you refer to the threats made by Hizballah 
after the abduction of Musfata al-Dirani? 
  [Shahaq] Hizballah made threats and carried out operations 
before the kidnapping of al-Dirani. Let us not be naive and 
start believing that Hizballah will suddenly attack us only 
because we kidnapped al-Dirani. Hizballah has always tried to 
hurt us in various locations. I believe we should be on the 
alert wherever Hizballah might attempt to attack Israel. 
  [Nisan] Do you expect an escalation in the north? 
  [Shahaq] I believe Hizballah will attempt to make good on 
its declarations. We must be ready wherever we believe 
Hizballah might attempt to take action.

<F P=106> [Report by Washington correspondent 'Aqiva Eldar] </F>
  [Excerpt] "The U.S. involvement in the peace process is 
weak and lacks assertiveness," Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres 
told French President Francois Mitterrand in a meeting last 
week, according to a cable sent by Dr. Yehuda Lankry, Israel's 
ambassador to France. The remarks were made in the context of 
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's mediation efforts 
between Israel and Syria. 
  According to the ambassador's classified cable, Peres said 
"Clinton is obviously more involved in economic issues than in 
foreign policy, and Christopher cannot upstage his superior." 
The foreign minister clarified through an aide that in his 
meeting with Mitterrand, he had expounded on the criticism 
leveled at the Americans by the Syrians. According to the aide, 
Peres himself believes that the U.S. Administration "is doing 
its utmost to promote the process." It should be noted that the 
talk was conducted in French, Ambassador Lankry's mother tongue.

<F P=106> [Report by security affairs correspondent Sharon Sade] </F>
  [Text] The decline in the defense industries' sales to the 
local market and in budget allocations for security-related 
research and development [R&amp;D] projects will continue as the 
peace process makes progress. This was stated yesterday by 
Defense Ministry Director General David 'Ivri at a seminar on 
Israel's security in an era of peace, held at the Jaffee Center 
for Strategic Studies. 
  According to him, "this will happen because a growing part 
of 
the defense budget, which has not changed much, is earmarked for 
ongoing needs resulted from the political process, such as the 
redeployment of IDF [Israel Defense Forces] units and 
investments in the protection of settlements. This comes at the 
expense of purchases from the defense industries and the 
allocation of funds for security-related R&amp;D." 
  "This is why," 'Ivri said, "the industries will have to 
prepare for this on their own and find alternative marketing 
solutions to compensate for the expected decline in income." He 
added that the more progress the peace process makes, the less 
prominent will the defense industries be in the framework of the 
defense establishment. Hence, their continued existence will 
become a national matter. 
  'Ivri went on to say that additional resources must be 
located for security R&amp;D projects because this will help 
Israel 
sustain its technological qualitative edge, which is a major 
part of its deterrent ability, and could help the industries 
offer attractive products on the international markets. 
  'Ivri believes that the peace process is not the only thing 
to impact on the defense industries. They will mainly be 
affected by the state of the international markets, because most 
of the Israeli products -- some two-thirds -- are sold to 
foreign costumers. At the same time, 'Ivri criticized the 
prevailing sentiment that the decline in weapons sales on the 
international market is the main reason for the deteriorated 
condition of the defense industries. 
  'Ivri presented data that show that the scope of Israel's 
defense exports rose by 75 percent between 1978 and 1992, while 
sales by other countries dropped 45 percent during the same 
period, and that decline continues. 'Ivri added that over the 
past several years, there has been a slight and gradual drop in 
Israel's security exports, which corresponds with the global 
markets. 
  The Defense Ministry director general pointed to additional 
difficulties for Israeli exports, such as tougher competition 
from government-sponsored Western industries; a policy of 
banning the transfer of technologies and know-how adopted by the 
United States and other countries; the restrictions on the use 
of U.S. aid, 90 percent of which is designated for the purchase 
of equipment in the United States; the need to obtain export 
permits for Israeli systems equipped with U.S.-made components, 
which makes arms deals more difficult and slower; and more. 
  He further said that the defense industries must become 
smaller and adjust to the change in demands from clients who are 
more interested today in upgrading systems and in sophisticated 
complementary systems such as guided missiles and bombs, 
intelligence-oriented systems, electronic warfare, and command 
and control units, and less interested in basic ammunition and 
equipment such as airplanes, tanks, and armored vehicles, of 
which there is plenty on the global market and at relatively low 
prices. 
  This explains why the Military Industries are in trouble. 
"Israel's relatively comfortable situation has helped to open 
new markets for the industries, made the establishment of 
business ties with foreign countries easier, and created greater 
potential for sales to nearby countries as well. At the same 
time, the effective scope of sales depends on defense budgets on 
the receiving end, and they are on the decline internationally," 
he said. 
  The speakers at the seminar unanimously agreed that the 
Middle East peace process is a result of Israel's image as a 
deterrent, which caused most of the Arab countries to abandon 
the military option and opt for a political dialogue. Most of 
the speakers expressed the belief that an image of powerful 
deterrent ability will guarantee long-term peace and stability 
in the Middle East.

<F P=106> [Interview with David Brodet, director of the Finance </F>
Ministry's Budget Department, by Sever Plotzker at the Finance 
Ministry in Tel Aviv on 3 May] 
  [Text] [Plotzker] What are we leaving the Palestinians in 
the Gaza Strip and Jericho? How much money is left in the till? 
  [Brodet] We are not petty. When Israel withdraws from the 
Gaza Strip there will be tens of millions of shekels in the 
Civil Administration coffers; all of the planned budget for May. 
This money will be turned over to the Palestinians and will 
suffice to finance the daily activities of the Palestinian 
authority in the Gaza Strip and Jericho for two or three weeks. 
After that, they are in charge. 
  [Plotzker] Will they manage? 
  [Brodet] They have no choice and they have no money. This 
is a great organizational and managerial incentive. There will 
also be debts to pay immediately. Water, electricity. 
  As a goodwill gesture, we are leaving them the Civil 
Administration's computer network and a package of diskettes 
with detailed budget software programs free of charge. As soon 
as they load the software, they will know who to pay, when, and 
how much. They will be able to make use of an efficient tax 
collection system, the same system used by the Civil 
Administration and its Palestinian employees. They wanted 
overlapping and that is what they will get. 
  We are handing over to them an effective and well-equipped 
administration machine with enough gas to reach the next gas 
station. Money, however, is something that they will have to 
raise by themselves, and immediately. 
  [Plotzker] The World Bank announced today that it would give 
them $1.2 billion. That sets them up pretty well, does it not? 
  [Brodet] Far from it. The World Bank, as the representative 
of the countries contributing to the Palestinian entity, has 
solicited commitments of $1.2 billion in aid for the Palestinian 
self-governing authority. This sum will be spread out over 
three years, which means about $400 million annually. The 
Palestinians will get a bit more in the first year but right now 
there is no point in talking about billions. 
  [Plotzker] Did you discuss this issue in your talks? Do the 
Palestinians realize their needs? 
  [Brodet] Certainly. They lose sleep over this. When we 
started the economic negotiations in November 1993, they stated 
that they had no intention of collecting taxes from the 
Palestinian population. Yasir 'Arafat sent Abu-al-'Ala' [Ahmad 
Quray'], the head of the Palestinian economic delegation, his 
grandiose plan for a tax paradise in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. 
When the PLO came in there, it would make everyone happy and 
cancel most taxes. Everything would be dirt cheap. When we 
asked them how they intended to finance their budget they 
replied that the donor countries would pay for it. In those 
days, incidentally, the Palestinian delegation did not always 
have enough money to pay for their phone calls. 
  [Plotzker] In the end, however, the economic agreement 
signed with the PLO stipulates that the taxes in the territories 
will be the same as those in Israel. 
  [Brodet] There was only one problem with the wonderful plan 
for a tax paradise in the Gaza Strip and Jericho: its 
implementation. The Western countries which promised money and 
aid to the Palestinians took one look at the plan and 
categorically rejected it. The Palestinians were very clearly 
told that they would not get a red cent to just squander away. 
Before giving the Palestinians any money, the Western countries 
first demanded to know how much money the Palestinian authority 
planned to collect in taxes from its constituents, which 
projects it intended to spend the money on, who would oversee 
expenditures, and who would submit the reports. Incidentally, 
part of the money was given as bridging loans. 
  [Plotzker] Did the World Bank's tough approach have any 
impact on the negotiations? 
  [Brodet] It had an immediate effect. We saw the 
Palestinians' faces sink. At the end of February this year, 
after three months of negotiations, they began to thoroughly 
study the Israeli tax system. Several seminars were held for 
them, and the Palestinians admitted they would have no choice 
but to impose heavy taxes. The Israeli customs rate did not 
seem excessively high any more, perhaps even too low. A value 
added tax of 15 to 16 percent struck them as necessary. That is 
how things are when you begin to stand on your own two feet. 
  [Plotzker] How big a budget will the Palestinian national 
authority have? 
  [Brodet] In our assessment, the anticipated expenditures 
during the first year will reach approximately one billion 
shekels. 
  [Plotzker] What does that include? 
  [Brodet] Their budget will include one major item that the 
Israeli Civilian Administration did not have to take into 
account: the cost of establishing, equipping, and operating the 
Palestinian police force. This will cost at least 450 million 
shekels in the first year. The establishment and operation of 
the autonomy institutions will cost at least 100 million 
shekels. They will employ many new civil servants and have to 
pay the salaries of officials from Tunis who have become 
accustomed to living conditions there. They also told us that 
they would have to expand administrative and social welfare 
services for the local population. 
  [Plotzker] Will they have a budget deficit? 
  [Brodet] They will have a large deficit of 400 to 500 
million shekels. 
  [Plotzker] Will they print money to cover it? 
  [Brodet] Fortunately for them, they are not permitted to 
print their own money. The shekel will continue to be the 
accepted currency in the territories. 
  The Palestinians assume that external aid will cover the 
cost 
of financing the police and the self-governing institutions for 
the first six months. They believe that they will thus be able 
to balance the budget and continue functioning. Maybe they will 
be able to sell Gaza Municipality bonds. 
  [Plotzker] Did the Palestinians raise the issue of what they 
call "compensation for the occupation." After all, they claim 
that Israel appropriated billions of dollars in taxes from the 
residents of the territories as well as national insurance 
payments from Palestinian workers in Israel. 
  [Brodet] Now that the agreement is signed I can tell you 
about this. This issue was mentioned at the first dinner 
between Abu-al- 'Ala' and Finance Minister Avraham Shohat. We 
decided to study the matter thoroughly and collected all the 
relevant data starting from 1970, when the first group of 
Palestinian workers were allowed into Israel. We compared the 
income we received with the Military Government's and Civil 
Administration's expenditures on behalf of the residents. 
  [Plotzker] What was the bottom line? 
  [Brodet] Between 1970 and 1994, the Israeli Government 
collected approximately 2.5 to 3 billion shekels at today's 
rates from the Palestinians, including VAT and income taxes in 
the territories and income taxes and national insurance payments 
from the workers who were employed in Israel. One must remember 
that Israel only started collecting taxes from the residents of 
the territories in a serious way in the 1980's. At the same 
time, Israel transferred 7.5 billion shekels to finance civilian 
budgets in the territories and awarded Palestinian workers 
another 2.8 billion shekels worth of special tax credits. The 
bottom line is that we gave the Palestinians a net sum of about 
7 billion shekels. We presented this account to the Palestinian 
representatives in Paris. 
  [Plotzker] So, are they going to return the money? 
  [Brodet] We presented the bill to underscore the fact that 
the past must be forgotten. There must be no more settling of 
accounts between Palestinians and Israelis. 
  [Plotzker] You sat down with senior PLO officials for 
hundreds of hours, for whole days and nights, whereas just a 
short while ago we were bitter enemies. How did that fact 
influence the course of the talks? 
  [Brodet] If in the beginning there was a feeling of enmity 
on the national level, it disappeared. We really became 
friends. We celebrated birthdays and laughed together. We 
passed each other phone calls. During Ramadan we were careful 
not to offend their religious sensitivities. We ate kosher food 
all the time. The Israeli Embassy in Paris took care of that. 
Most of the time, the French paid and occasionally we did. 
Sometimes the Palestinians invited everyone to a Lebanese 
restaurant. 
  [Plotzker] When the talks began, you presented the 
Palestinians a conception of an almost total economic union 
between the Palestinian and Israeli economies. You proposed 
that the PLO opt for an Israeli-oriented economy as opposed to a 
Jordanian one. When did they become convinced that this was the 
right choice? 
  [Brodet] In our assessment, they were already convinced of 
this upon arrival. Their delegation included excellent 
economists and professionals with doctorates from Western 
universities, people with an international background who knew 
very well that the Palestinian economy had no chance of growing 
and developing without establishing tight links with Israel. 
The Jordanian option, from the economic point of view, was very 
unattractive to the Palestinians. The problem was with the 
Jordanian pressure and the hesitancy of the political leadership 
in Tunis, which obviously did not want to burn its bridges with 
Jordan. 
  [Plotzker] Would you describe the negotiations as being 
strewn with crises? 
  [Brodet] No. I remember two fundamental crises, both 
political in nature, and many mini-crises which were resolved 
without leaving any traces. I am not complaining about this. 
The agreement we wanted to achieve was very complicated and 
sets many precedents. Neither party had anything to base 
themselves on. The PLO came to the talks out of a weaker 
position. It is an organization that never dealt with building 
an economy or planning a national economic policy. We dragged 
suitcases full of position papers. 
  [Plotzker] What was the most serious crisis? 
  [Brodet] Contrary to the media reports in Israel, the most 
serious crises did not pertain to the nature of relations 
between the Palestinian and Israeli economies but rather to the 
relations between the Palestinian economy, Jordan, and the Arab 
countries. 
  The most difficult crisis occurred on the eve of the Hebron 
massacre [25 February 1994], after the PLO delegation in Amman 
signed a declaration of economic principles with Jordan. 
Abu-al- 'Ala' proposed that the Palestinians be allowed to open 
up the eastern border and establish a free trade zone with 
Jordan as well as Israel. We could not accept such a proposal 
because it would expose the Israeli economy to unrestricted 
imports from all the Arab and Islamic countries, with no 
reciprocity and no negotiations. Prior to all this, the 
Palestinians were already angry at us for signing a banking 
agreement with Jordan. One could sense an impending explosion 
in the air. A marathon discussion, lasting almost a whole day, 
between Abu-al-'Ala' and Shohat got the talks back on track. 
  Shohat was at his best during the last months of the 
negotiations. He solved problems and radiated understanding. 
Shohat and Abu-al-'Ala got along well. They loved each other's 
jokes. 
  [Plotzker] Was there also a last-minute crisis of the kind 
the PLO loves so much? 
  [Brodet] Shohat and Abu-al-'Ala' completed most of the 
agreement before the talks were halted in the wake of the Hebron 
massacre. All kinds of crises can pop up, however, even at the 
last minute. They told us: after we sign an agreement on open 
economic relations, on a bona fide economic union with Israel, 
we cannot seal off the Palestinian self-government to goods from 
the Arab world and Islamic countries. That would be simply 
inconceivable. We could understand the political constraints 
here, and agreed to prepare a detailed, precise list of goods 
the autonomy could import from Egypt, Jordan, and other Islamic 
countries with our approval. 
  For example, we authorized the import of several thousand 
Jordanian-made television sets. Will that bother anyone in 
Israel? Of course not. Israel imports 120,000 television sets a 
year from all over the world. But this will enable the 
Palestinians to tell the Arab world that they have not sold 
themselves out to the Israelis. 
  [Plotzker] The Palestinians committed themselves in writing 
to establish a national insurance institute, monetary authority, 
and national insurance company, as well as other things. We 
promised that when we collect custom levies and taxes for them, 
we will transfer the money to these new institutions. Whom will 
we send the money to if these institutions are not established? 
  [Brodet] When a product destined for Gaza reaches the Ashdod 
port, Israeli customs inspectors will assess its value and exact 
a customs tariff. The money will be deposited in an account set 
up by the Palestinian authority. We will transfer the income 
tax and national insurance we collect from Palestinian workers 
in Israel in the same way. 
  During the first year, we will transfer approximately 150 
million to the Palestinian authority in this way. We will not 
stand around with a stopwatch in our hand henpecking the 
Palestinians to establish their own stock market and pension 
funds. As far as they are concerned the important thing is 
organizing a budget, collecting taxes (they can collect about 
300 million shekels in the Gaza Strip and Jericho in the first 
year), and satisfy the demands of the countries donating funds 
within the framework of the World Bank so that they will indeed 
send the money. 
  [Plotzker] Which sectors of the Israeli economy will be 
detrimentally affected by the agreement with the PLO? 
  [Brodet] We attempted to calculate the effects of the 
agreement on each individual branch and sub-branch of the 
economy. Except for certain farmers who grow three kinds of 
vegetables, no one else will be affected at all, and with time 
will even begin to make a profit. 
  [Plotzker] Will Israel's economy remain unharmed even when 
the Palestinian economy takes off? 
  [Brodet] On the contrary. That is when we will really start 
to enjoy things. What do we export to the Gaza Strip today? 
Approximately $200 million worth of goods. I can see no foreign 
element capable of replacing Israel's economic and commercial 
presence there. Our produce is in very high demand in the 
territories. It enjoys a good reputation for quality. Our 
ports, in Haifa and Ashdod, will continue to serve Palestinian 
importers, especially in the renovation, construction, and 
development projects that will be implemented by the Palestinian 
self-government. 
  [Plotzker] Have we guaranteed our participation in these 
development and renovation projects? 
  [Brodet] The government cannot act in lieu of joint business 
projects. The projects will start when the mutual feelings of 
suspicion and fear have dissipated. We adamantly insisted on 
one thing: The Cairo agreements clearly prohibit any 
discrimination against Israeli entrepreneurs, companies, or the 
State of Israel in general. We will be allowed to bid for any 
tender. 
  [Plotzker] How much compensation has the Treasury allocated 
for the expected damages to agriculture? 
  [Brodet] The Treasury will try to be understanding toward 
the vegetable growers harmed by the agreement; however, we are 
not talking about large sums. We are not even thinking along 
the lines of compensation, we are thinking about growth. 
  [Plotzker] What do you mean? 
  [Brodet] Our model for the Palestinian economy foresees a 
dramatic shift toward a 20-percent real growth rate beginning in 
1995. The Palestinian economy's gross national product may grow 
by 100 percent within three years. At the same time, we expect 
a six to seven percent growth rate in the Israeli economy. 
  [Plotzker] At the same time? Will one not come at the 
expense of the other? 
  [Brodet] No, both will come together. We will have 
complementary economies.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Ziyad Abu-Zayyad by Ya'el Dan and </F>
Itay Engel; place not given -- live] 
  [Text] [Dan] We will now move on to the crisis of 
confidence between the PLO and the Israeli Government. In a 
unilateral step, which contravenes the agreement with Israel, 
PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat published a decree in the East 
Jerusalem press abrogating all Israeli laws in the Palestinian 
autonomous areas. The decree states that from now on, the only 
laws in effect are those that existed before 1967. Contrary to 
the promise 'Arafat made to Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, the 
PLO's insignia, with a map of all of Eretz Yisra'el, appears on 
the decree. Furthermore, in the decree, 'Arafat is referred to 
the president of the Palestinian National Authority, and this 
constitutes a violation of the agreement. Good morning to 
Attorney Ziyad Abu-Zayyad, a senior PLO official. 
  [Abu-Zayyad] Good morning. 
  [Dan] Why is 'Arafat in such a rush to violate the agreement 
before he has even begun to keep it? 
  [Abu-Zayyad] In my opinion, there is a problem here with the 
Israeli opposition, as well as with some of the Israelis who 
support the peace process. They immediately get into a panic 
and start looking for ways to prove how unreliable the other 
side is. Several moments ago, you said that 'Arafat had issued 
a decree canceling the Israeli laws that were in force in the 
territories. I have the decree here in front of me, and there 
is no mention of the things you just reported. I do not know 
where you got the information for your report. 
  [Dan] 'Arafat says: the laws, regulations, and decrees that 
prevailed in the Palestinian territories in the West Bank and 
the Gaza Strip before 5 June 1967 will remain in effect. 
  [Abu-Zayyad] Okay, what else? 
  [Dan] The civilian, ethnic, and religious courts at the 
various levels will continue to operate according to the 
existing laws and regulations, with the reference apparently 
being to those that have been in force since 1967. I do not 
want to go on in detail, however.... 
  [Abu-Zayyad, interrupting] No, just wait a minute. As a 
legal expert, I would like to take this opportunity to say that 
I do not see anything here that violates the agreement with the 
Israeli party. 
  [Engel] Before you get into any details, perhaps you could 
tell us: Since when does 'Arafat have legislative powers? 
  [Abu-Zayyad] I will explain myself in a moment. This decree 
stipulates that the situation will remain as it is. The 
decision does not mention the Israeli military decrees or the 
Israeli military courts. 
  [Dan] But is there not a contradiction, at the very least, 
here? 
  [Abu-Zayyad] No. There is a chapter in the Oslo agreement 
that refers to a committee that will review all the military 
decrees currently in force in the territories. As far as the 
Palestinians are concerned, there is an even tougher clause in 
the Cairo agreement, which states that the Palestinians have the 
authority to legialste in those fields turned over to their 
control; however, any law they wish to enact must be brought 
before a joint committee that will decide within 45 days whether 
or not the law is relevant. In other words, the Cairo agreement 
gives Israel veto rights even in those fields that were turned 
over to the Palestinians. 
  [Dan] Mr. Yo'el Singer, who helped formulate the 
agreements in Oslo, asserts that the decree published by 'Arafat 
constitutes a very flagrant violation of the Oslo agreement. 
  [Abu-Zayyad] I beg to differ. I disagree with him on this 
issue. I think that the decree states that some of the laws 
that have been in force in the West Bank up to this moment also 
existed prior to 1967. Therefore, they will remain valid. 
Second, in the same decree, 'Arafat states that the civilian, 
shar'iyah, and other religious courts will continue to operate 
according to the existing laws and regulations. This means 
that, practically speaking, he is not canceling anything. The 
judges and prosecutors will also keep their jobs. In my 
opinion, there is nothing new here and certainly no violation of 
the agreement. I have no intention of whitewashing things or 
misleading anyone. I think that anyone reading this decree 
should immediately ask himself what is missing and what is not 
mentioned here. The fact that something is not mentioned here 
does not mean that it has been canceled or annulled. The 
contrary is true. 
  [Engel] Well, there is no point in expanding on this 
subject, because it appears that beyond the gap in positions, 
there are also quite large differences with regard to what has 
already been agreed and both parties' legal interpretation of 
the agreement. But before we get into details, let me ask you 
about the principles. Who gave the PLO or 'Arafat legislative 
powers? The agreement stipulates that such powers will only be 
awarded to the Palestinian Authority, which has not yet been 
established, and even when established, the Palestinian 
Authority must coordinate all legislation with Israel. 
  [Abu-Zayyad] Look, in principle, legislative powers derive 
from the people. Legislative authority is bestowed by the 
people. Now, within the specific and unique conditions under 
which we are operating, there is an agreement, and all parties 
must uphold the agreements they sign and implement them both in 
spirit and letter. In my opinion, the question of whether we are 
violating the agreement will only be proved by developments in 
the field and by the way we interpret and implement the 
agreement in practice. 
  [Dan] Even the symbolic step of using the PLO insignia with 
a map of Palestine that includes all of Eretz Yisra'el also 
constitutes a violation of the agreement. Above all, it is an 
ostentatious provocation. 
  [Abu-Zayyad] I have a copy of AL-QUDS with the published 
decree right here in front of me. There is no such insignia. 
  [Dan] But I see it right here in front of my eyes. 
  [Abu-Zayyad] No. Which newspaper are you looking at? 
AL-QUDS? 
  [Dan] No, I am looking at MA'ARIV, which copied the decree. 
  [Abu-Zayyad] Look at page 4 of yesterday's copy of AL-QUDS. 
There is a box. Inside the box you can find the decree. I do 
not know where MA'ARIV got the insignia from. I must also say 
that I have seen a great deal of incitement in the Israeli 
press. It is inciting Israeli public opinion against the 
agreement. I can discern an intention to undermine trust 
between the two parties. I would like to make the following 
suggestion to my colleagues in the Israeli press: We have 
enough doubts and fears on both sides. There is no need to add 
additional doubts and fears on top of what we already have. It 
is totally uncalled for. 
  [Dan] Thank you, Attorney Ziyad Abu-Zayyad.

  [Text] Ahmad al-Tibi, Yasir 'Arafat's adviser, today 
rejected the demand that the PLO head present a letter in which 
he pledges to honor the agreement with Israel. He also lashed 
at the demand that Prime Minister Rabin send the IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces] into the Gaza Strip. Dr. al-Tibi demanded that 
the interim period be shortened because he believes five years 
is too long a period during which to form the permanent 
solution. According to him, circumstances on the ground will 
force the parties to immediately begin negotiating the permanent 
solution. 
  Speaking at a seminar on the peace process at the Ben-Gurion 
University in Beersheba, Dr. al-Tibi said that the Palestinian 
goal is to establish an independent state, the capital of which 
will be East Jerusalem. According to him, there are cabinet 
ministers who support the establishment of an independent 
Palestinian state. He believes that the settlements can be kept 
in place and, after they are evacuated by the settlers, they 
could be populated by the Palestinian refugees.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi, adviser to PLO </F>
Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, place not given, by Sa'id Mu'addi on 24 
May; from the "With the Midday Events" feature -- live or 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Mu'addi] Dr. Ahmad, good afternoon. 
  [Al-Tibi] Good afternoon to you. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Ahmad, yesterday you sounded optimistic about 
a date for convening the Palestine National Council [PNC]. 
Perhaps there are some difficulties in getting all the PNC 
members together soon in the Gaza Strip. 
  [Al-Tibi] Did you say optimistic? I did not hear your 
question. 
  [Mu'addi] Yes. 
  [Al-Tibi] Did you see my television interview yesterday? I 
was very clear. It was in Hebrew. I said that the PNC will 
convene in Gaza in the future. However, I said there were some 
logistical, administrative, and technical problems in getting 
all the PNC members together from all over the world. I said if 
these logistical problems were solved in the future after the 
arrival of the Palestinian uuthority and the establishment of 
security, then Yasir 'Arafat would demonstrate commitment to the 
agreement he signed that the clauses that relate to the State of 
Israel and contravene the Oslo agreement would be amended. 
Therefore, I reiterate what my brother Dr. Nabil Sha'th has 
just said about the PNC convening in Gaza in the future. Some 
people quoted me as saying the PNC would convene a session 
shortly. I said in the future, and there is a difference 
between the two. Things should be clear. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Ahmad, do you expect Yasir 'Arafat to adopt 
another step to remove this crisis of confidence that erupted 
between the two sides in light of the recent statements? 
  [Al-Tibi] Yasir 'Arafat is not the one who created this new 
crisis of confidence. It is is true that there is a growing 
crisis of confidence. The crisis has escalated over the past 
two days after the Israeli accusation that 'Arafat plans to 
violate the agreement. Some Israeli orientalists claimed that 
'Arafat intends to violate the agreement just like Prophet 
Muhammad violated the agreement [with the Jews]. Any primary 
school student knows that Quraysh was the tribe that violated 
the agreement and that Prophet Muhammad adhered strictly to the 
al-Hudaybiyah Agreement, despite the difficult conditions set 
for the Muslims then. Therefore, there is no need for President 
'Arafat to provide another written agreement to the head of the 
government, Yitzhaq Rabin, or to the Israeli Government. The 
only commitment that Yasir 'Arafat signed and adheres to so far 
is the Declaration of Principles signed between 'Arafat and 
Rabin. Therefore, asking 'Arafat to sign another letter is 
unnecessary and will not be done. 
  [Mu'addi] One last question. Even Environment Minister Yosi 
Sarid, deemed by the opposition to represent the left side of 
the political map in Israel, has criticized Yasir 'Arafat in 
light of these statements. 
  [Al-Tibi] What is new about that? This is not the first 
time that Yosi Sarid criticizes Yasir 'Arafat. He is always the 
first to do so. There is a choir that always criticizes Yasir 
'Arafat. This is not new. I respect some of Yosi Sarid's 
attitudes regarding human rights and the need to talk to the 
PLO. However, I strongly object to his style in criticizing 
Yasir 'Arafat. Yasir 'Arafat will not be a mayor of the town of 
Jericho because he is a leader of the Palestinian people. And 
his leadership of the Palestinian people is not confined and is 
not linked to statements of this sort, which are harmful and do 
not help promote confidence-building. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi, Yasir 'Arafat's special 
adviser, thank you. 
  [Al-Tibi] You are welcome.

<F P=106> [Telephone Interview with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, member of the </F>
Palestinian National Authority, place not given, by Sa'id 
Mu'addi; date not given; from the "With The Midday Events" 
feature -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, the Palestinian 
[National] Authority will hold its first meeting in Tunis 
tomorrow. What is on its agenda? 
  [Sha'th] The first meeting is needed to determine the action 
plan for moving toward Gaza and Jericho and the Palestinian 
land. This is the first meeting. Portfolios or responsibilities 
should be distributed among the members. We will complete the 
appointment of the other members. The total number of members 
should be 24. We will prepare a detailed plan of action for 
this authority and for its departure as soon as possible for 
Gaza and Jericho. We will also discuss the plan for completing 
the negotiations that will enable the early assumption of powers 
in the West Bank and the completion of what has not been 
completed in the negotiations which led to the conclusion of the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement. 
  [Mu'addi] Will the names of the remaining members of the 
Palestinian Authority be announced tomorrow? 
  [Sha'th] This will be discussed tomorrow. If agreement is 
reached on all the names, then they will be made public. 
Otherwise, some of the names will be announced, and the others 
after going to Gaza and Jericho. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, reports mention that the 
Palestine National Council [PNC] will soon meet in Gaza to 
strike off the National Charter provisions on Israel. What do 
you have to say to this? 
  [Sha'th] This is one of the matters brother President Yasir 
'Arafat and Minister Peres had agreed upon. What is important 
is the the PNC meeting in Gaza will be an important meeting 
because it will bestow more legitimacy on the new Palestinian 
authority and will discuss many issues, and most certainly the 
PLO's commitments vis-a-vis the reciprocal recognition that took 
place last September. 
  [Mu'addi] When do you expect the PNC to meet? 
  [Sha'th] I do not expect it to meet before the Palestinian 
National Authority is firmly established on the ground and there 
is a real beginning of work, and complete security. I do not 
expect this to take place very soon. 
  [Mu'addi] Major General Amnon Shahaq communicated to you 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's request concerning Mr. Yasir 
'Arafat's commitment to the agreement in light of the recent 
statements in Johannesburg? 
  [Sha'th] The truth is that there is an ongoing dialogue 
between us. It goes without saying that President 'Arafat 
abides by this agreement which he himself signed in Cairo on 4 
May. He has no intention not to abide by what he has committed 
himself to. I believe that the Palestinian National Authority 
will certainly reemphasize the Palestinian side's abidance by 
this agreement. 
  [Mu'addi] Has Mr. 'Arafat replied to Mr. Rabin's request in 
this respect? 
  [Sha'th] The truth is that there are psychological and 
political matters in politics. I do not believe that what is 
requested is political, meaning that the one who signs an 
agreement abides by it. If he does not abide by his first 
signature, how can he be asked for another signature? The 
question is one of confidence. I believe there can be no doubt 
as to President 'Arafat's commitment to this agreement. 
President 'Arafat does not need a new piece of paper. If there 
is no confidence, then to what extent can one trust the new 
piece of paper? I believe the question is purely psychological. 
President 'Arafat is committed to what he had signed. We hope 
that the Israeli side is too. I hope that we would not wage 
this battle of statements. If one wages such a battle, then 
there are many statements by the Israeli side which one cannot 
accept as an expression of good intention about maintaining this 
agreement and its other requirements. I specifically have in 
mind Mr. [Yosi] Sarid's statements on President 'Arafat as mayor 
of Jericho municipality. This is something that is not in line 
with the agreement that President 'Arafat and Prime Minister 
Rabin had signed. I hope that this period of no confidence will 
be brief and that we all prove on the ground that we are 
completely serious in our commitment to all that we have signed 
and that we wish to proceed forward because this agreement is a 
transitional agreement, and we want to complete it by many other 
stages until we reach the definitive peace agreement that will 
set the bases of just and lasting peace among our two people. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, one last question: Is 10 June the date 
when Mr. 'Yasir 'Arafat will arrive in the self-rule area? 
  [Sha'th] This is what we will discover tommorrow in the 
meeting in Tunis, God willing. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, member of the Palestinian 
Authority, thank you.

<F P=106> [Interview with PLO Executive Committee member Samir </F>
Ghawshah by Rashid Khashanah in Tunis on 19 May] 
  [Excerpts] [Khashanah] When will President Yasir 'Arafat 
go to Jericho and the National Authority begin its duties? 
  [Ghawshah] The authority began to exercise its role on 18 
May. A number of members are already inside the occupied 
territories. The completion of the police forces' entry and the 
transfer of powers from the Israelis will prepare conditions for 
the entry of Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] and the other members of 
the authority. I expect this to happen early next month. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Khashanah] Have you decided in the Executive Committee 
which departments will be moved to Jericho and which will stay 
in Tunis? 
  [Ghawshah] The fundamental thing is for the PLO's standing 
to continue. And the focus should be on the PLO as the sole 
legitimate representative of the Palestinian people and the 
leader of their struggle in their various groupings inside and 
outside the occupied homeland. And any policies for the stage 
ahead should help to achieve the PLO's aims, namely the right to 
self-determination and the establishment of a Palestinian state 
with Jerusalem as its capital. 
  So it is necessary for some departments like the Political 
Department to remain temporarily outside the occupied homeland, 
especially as the Palestinian-Israeli accord prevents the 
Palestinian national authority from exercising its role at 
foreign relations level. [passage omitted] 
  [Khashanah] The Palestinians demand that negotiations on the 
final stage begin now. How can conditions be secured to achieve 
that? 
  [Ghawshah] We clearly voiced out reservations about the 
agreements concluded, whether during the Executive Committee's 
discussions, the Central Council's debates, or in separate 
statements. However, despite our reservations, we believe that 
it is possible to exert pressure to implement the resolutions of 
international legitimacy as soon as possible, first and foremost 
with regard to speeding up negotiations on the final stage. 
  It requires that the Arab world and the international 
community move to bolster the Palestinian people's just struggle 
and help them to recover their rights, first and foremost the 
right to repatriation and self-determination, and to establish 
an independent state with Jerusalem as its capital. 
  [Khashanah] The economic Palestinian-Israeli agreement has 
cast shadows on Jordanian-Palestinian relations which have not 
been cleared by the recent meeting between the Jordanian 
information minister and the PLO Economic Department director. 
How will you reduce Jordan's concerns? 
  [Ghawshah] We proceed from the special relationship between 
the Palestinian and Jordanian peoples, which is deeper and more 
comprehensive than any present or future agreement. 
  And of course, the interest in this special relationship 
should be translated into tangible realities in all spheres and 
at all levels. As for recent economic talks, they dealt with 
basic issues concerning monetary, trade, and tourism issues, 
which are all part of an agreement concluded between Jordan and 
Palestine. And efforts must continue to secure practical and 
tangible agreements that serve the two peoples in the present 
and the future. [passage omitted]

MSAM, to manage the funds given to administer and develop the 
West Bank and the Gaza strip under the leadership of the PNA. 
  This institution, which manages funds estimated at 50 
billion 
dollars, is a subsidiary of the Stanley Morgan Group [as heard], 
a large financial institution that has offices in the world's 
main financial centers. 
  The PNA said that it had chosen this institution to help in 
reassuring the donor states and agencies that the funds they had 
given to the PNA for the administration and development of the 
West Bank and Gaza were being managed with complete transparency 
and in a proficient and professional way through one of the 
world's eminent financial institutions.

  [Text] Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid, chairman of the 
Presidential Council and secretary general of the Yemeni 
Socialist Party, has stressed that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih imposed 
an unjust war on us, and secession on the entire Yemeni people 
on 27 April 1994, when he declared war on everyone. He said 
that we found ourselves compelled, in overwhelming 
circumstances, to announce the formation of the Democratic 
Republic of Yemen, which we consider to be the nucleus for a 
unified Yemen, as it was erected on the firm basis of the pledge 
and accord document, a document for national consensus. The 
brother chairman of the Presidential Council stated this today 
during a dawn press conference in al-Mukalla, Hadramawt 
Governorate, during which he touched on a number of important 
national issues. 
  Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid said that the situation which the 
military and dictatorial machine of the al-Ahmar family's gang 
is trying to impose would not gain a foothold in this 
governorate. He noted that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih was trying, 
with his forces deployed over a wide area, to turn the situation 
in his favor, and to besiege Aden, but he had paid a dear price 
and was continuing to do so. The brother said: It is now up to 
us to step up resistance, together with all patriots and 
democrats in the northern governorates, to bring about the 
collapse of the al-Ahmar gang's military machine, and with it 
the collapse of its [word indistinct] and hegemony over Yemen's 
resources and people. 
  He stressed that the reconstruction of the state in part of 
Yemen's territory places before us a great task for the future, 
and a historic responsibility to struggle to bring about the 
unity of the Yemeni homeland and people. He said: We are not 
afraid of being termed secessionists or unionists, because 
history will describe us as individuals seeking to bring about 
realistic circumstances for the performance of democratic, 
unionist, and peaceful actions for the future of the entire 
Yemeni people.

  [Text] Presidential Council Chairman 'Ali Salim al-Bid has 
stressed that Yemenis will put an end to military and tribal 
hegemony. To do this, they have two options: Either to accept 
the authority of the military establishment backed by the gangs, 
or resist in order to impose democracy, political pluralism, and 
human rights. We have chosen the latter path and have paid a 
heavy price out of the conviction that our Yemeni masses 
understand the situation and realize that our struggle is for 
the sake of Yemen -- not just for the sake of the six southern 
governorates. We are paying dearly, with our lives and blood, 
on behalf of those who have not joined us in the battle for the 
national cause. 
  Replying to a question on the military situation, 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid said: We are currently arranging our affairs within the 
framework of our state and its institutions. We are currently 
working with the institutions of the Democratic Republic of 
Yemen as opposed to those of the Yemeni Socialist Party. 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid noted that the political Army and the military Army 
are coordinating on a large scale. He referred to the confusion 
that existed in the initial days of the war, saying it was only 
natural because we had not conditioned our masses to be warlike 
and destructive, but that when our units started being attacked 
in the northern governorates, the logic of reality and struggle 
took over and gave rise to a different orientation. The people 
began adapting themselves to the new circumstances. 
  Presidential Council Chairman 'Ali Salim al-Bid said: We 
have begun in practical terms what we have been talking about 
and what we have been demanding in part of Yemen for the sake of 
the whole of Yemen. It is up to us to compete on a basis of 
peace and democracy in order to provide an example acceptable to 
the Yemeni people, a model for the future of the modern civil 
state based on pluralism, democracy, and human rights. He noted 
that if there exists a state in the northern governorates 
proceeding along these same lines, there will be no difficulty 
in reuniting in the future on the same basis as that on which we 
agreed in the pledge and accord document. 
  Referring to the issue of the recognition of the new 
Republic, 'Ali Salim al-Bid stressed that the coincidence of the 
declaration of the new Republic with the 'Id al-Adha festival 
has positive implications that will soon become apparent, God 
willing. He said contacts made before and during the war with 
the presidents and kings of the Arab states arose from our 
eagerness to prevent the disaster of war. The presidents and 
kings were sympathetic toward our complicated situation which 
[words indistinct] force. 
  On the military situation in al-Anad, 'Ali Salim al-Bid 
stressed that the enemy forces there will be unable to 
accomplish anything, that good progress is being made there, and 
that the enemy forces will never be permitted to take al-Anad. 
He invited reporters to go to the base and the area as a whole 
to see that for themselves. 
  On the military situation in Shabwah Governorate, the 
Presidential Council chairman confirmed that there is indeed a 
current breakthrough in the direction of the Ma'rib because we 
did not think they were bent on occupation. He added that the 
Sanaa forces have been unable to achieve their desire, which is 
to gain control of the oil wells, because the sons of the 
Shabwah Governorate have rejected anything like occupation. 
  The Presidential Council Chairman stressed that our [word 
indistinct] alliance with the various parties toward building 
the Yemeni state is an ongoing target and all obstacles in the 
way of achieving it in the future will be overcome. Everyone is 
bound to consider the views of others so that we can build an 
institutional state. We are eager to offer our hands to others 
and to promote joint action. 
  Replying to a question on the provision of guarantees for 
the 
security of oil companies working in our country, the 
Presidential Council chairman stressed that the new state will 
guarantee the interests of all oil companies in our country and 
will provide them with security and stability regardless of cost 
inasmuch as there exist joint interests between the new state 
and these companies. He said there are good contacts with the 
international oil companies which have responded positively.

<F P=106> [By Henri Mamarbachi] </F>
  [Text] Al-Mukalla, Yemen, May 24 (AFP)--Southern leader 
'Ali Salim al-Bid has gathered tribal leaders in this port city 
to seek their support for his outnumbered army against the 
northern troops of Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. 
  Al-Bid was focusing on the Awkali tribe's 20,000 fighters to 
help check Salih's advance in the oil province of Shabwah, in 
eastern Yemen like al-Mukalla, an AFP correspondent reported 
Tuesday [24 May]. 
  But the tribe was undecided, mainly because of "bad 
relations" with al-Bid's Yemen Socialist Party which ruled the 
former Marxist South Yemen, southern official Muhsin Muhammad 
Farid acknowledged. 
  Farid was named deputy prime minister of the Yemen 
Democratic 
Republic (YDR) which declared its independence on Saturday under 
the leadership of al-Bid, who moved here from his Aden 
stronghold a week ago. 
  "The tribes need time to realise that the situation has 
changed, and to rally. They have steered clear of the war since 
it broke out" on May 5, Farid told a small group of reporters. 
  "So they are not budging, and they say what's going on does 
not concern them." 
  The Awkalis' reluctance to fight is obvious at the Hadhramut 
Hotel where 1,000 fighters, armed with Kalashnikov assault 
rifles and traditional carved daggers, are being housed and fed 
during the negotiations with al-Bid. 
  Sitting on a rock next to his bungalow in the newly-built 
hotel facing the Gulf of Aden, one of the fighters bursts into 
laughter when asked what he will do. And then he says: "Resist, 
of course." 
  The civil war and the tribal invasion have caused distress 
for the staff. 
  "Last month, the occupancy rate was 82 percent. French, 
Italian and German tourists filled the hotel. Now we've just 
received a cancellation for a group of 120 French people," 
complained hotel manager Isma'il Zakariya, an Indian. 
  He has not heard from his family in Bangalore for the past 
20 
days, as al-Mukalla is totally cut off from the rest of the 
world, with telephone and telex lines down. 
  "I just want to save my skin, and get away from this place 
on 
the first evacuation," he said. 
  Six ships were moored off al-Mukalla port, the closest 
loading facility to Massila oilfield. The 175,000 inhabitants 
of the city appeared indifferent to the battles raging hundred 
of kilometers away. 
  Northern forces have made a "breakthrough" in the oil-rich 
Shabwah but will never reach the production fields, al-Bid said 
Monday. Oil production was continuing in the Massila field at 
more than 150,000 barrels a day. 
  He said negotiations were underway with the Canadian oil 
company Canoxy on revenues, which were usually paid to the 
government in Sanaa, capital of the Yemen which was unified four 
years ago.

<F P=106> [Report by Salwa al-Ustuwani: "'Ali Nasir Rejects the New </F>
State in the South and Urges Cancellation of the Secession and 
Resumption of Dialogue"] 
  [Excerpts] Damascus -- 'Ali Nasir Muhammad, former south 
Yemeni president, has confirmed the statement made by 'Abdallah 
Ahmad Ghanim, the Yemeni justice minister in the Sanaa 
government, to the effect that 'Ali Salim al-Bid had telephoned 
'Ali Nasir Muhammad, who lives in Damascus, and offered him the 
post of vice president in the Democratic Republic of Yemen which 
was declared three days ago, on the basis that al-Bid would 
resign six months later and 'Ali Nasir Muhammad would become 
head of state. 
  President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that he 
rejected the offer which he saw as tantamount to partition of 
Yemen which would be "a crime against unity." He added: "They 
tried to persuade me by all means in three contacts. I told 
them that I could not accept." He said that "'Ali Salim al-Bid 
offered to send today -- that is immediately -- a special plane 
to take me to him in Hadramaut. I refused and told him that I 
was prepared to return on certain conditions. The first was 
restoration of unity. And I said that I would be willing to 
work for a cease-fire and a return to dialogue and prevent the 
country's destruction. I asked him to postpone everything for 
48 hours, not to make any decisions, and revoke south Yemen's 
secession decision and return to dialogue and a cease-fire, and 
said that I would be willing to hold contacts with Sanaa and 
Aden to promote dialogue and understanding." 
  'Ali Nasir Muhammad added: "I rejected al-Bid's offer 
because I care about Yemen's unity and because I still maintain 
my principled position stated before and after these events, 
namely that I am opposed to infighting and secession. I 
emphasized in all their contacts with me and my contacts with 
them that the Yemeni solution must be within the framework of 
the unity state not outside it, that whatever the problems and 
mistakes encountered throughout the unity march, they did not 
justify secession at all, and that a distinction should be made 
between disagreement with the Yemeni president and the cause of 
Yemen's unity. Individuals disappear but unity and the people 
live on." [passage omitted] 
  Asked what he thought were the chances of survival for south 
Yemen's secession, he said "I can confirm that the Yemeni 
Socialist Party [YSP] played a significant part, along with the 
other political groups and the General People's Congress [GPC], 
in achieving unity, that the YSP derived its strength from its 
support for unity, and that abandoning unity now would mean 
suicide and would mean the end of the party." [passage omitted] 
  President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad said that he did not know if 
the Gulf states or any state had any intention of recognizing 
the new south Yemeni state. He said they would have to think 
hard before taking such a step. 
  Commenting on (north) Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih's 
position on what has happened, 'Ali Nasir Muhammad said: "In a 
telephone conversation I had with President Salih yesterday, he 
assured me that he would never accept the secession which is 
considered as high national treason, that there would be no 
going back on unity, that he would not accept the secession of 
the south as a fait accompli, and that he was prepared to hold a 
dialogue with the YSP or with the unionist forces within the YSP 
to rescue Yemen and its unity. I, in turn, stressed to him the 
need for a dialogue with the unionist forces in the YSP and 
asked him to keep the door open for dialogue despite the wounds." 
  The former Yemeni president also said: "I am now 
endeavoring and trying, along with some of the people who 
support unity and who are loyal to the Yemeni people, to promote 
such a dialogue between President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and the 
YSP. That is what I am working for in my current contacts." 
  Asked if Arab mediation has been suspended, he said: "There 
is no Arab mediation. There is Arab League mediation. Arab 
League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has, in a 
telephone conversation, assured me that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih has 
left the door open for dialogue with the Arab League and the 
Arab states." 
  On the reports claiming that a number of his supporters 
including the newly appointed Defense Minister 'Abd-Rabbuh Hadi 
Mansur, Social Security Minister Muhammad 'Abdallah al-Batani, 
and Colonel al-Khadr al-'Aqil, were killed in a car accident, 
giving rise to widespread speculations, 'Ali Nasir Muhammad 
said: "That is not true. I contacted them a short while ago 
and spoke to them personally and reassured myself about their 
health. What was published about them having been killed is not 
true. They are alive and well." 
  The former Yemeni president showed annoyance at the 
appointment of Sulayman Nasir Mas'ud, formerly one of his 
supporters, as a member of the southern Presidential Council. 
He said: "I have nothing to do with that appointment or with 
him. I was not consulted. As a matter of principle I reject 
the secession and I naturally reject his appointment. It is not 
just a question of rejecting the appointment. I reject the 
whole idea. He does not represent me and I have nothing to do 
with him." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with South Yemen Vice President 'Abd-al-Rahman </F>
al-Jifri by "m. ans." in Aden; date not given: "We Will Never 
Surrender, We Will Fight One Street at the Time" -- first 
paragraph is LA REPUBBLICA introduction] 
  [Text] Aden -- A huge sapphire ring on his finger, his red 
and white kaffiyeh elegantly resting on his shoulders, 
'Abd-al-Rahman al-Jifri stroked his short, square beard. 
Yesterday he was elected South Yemen's vice president -- and 
ever since head of state al-Bid took refuge in his native 
Hadramut region, in the east, al-Jifri has become the highest 
political authority in Aden. Before starting the interview, 
al-Jifri -- who is 55 years old, and a long-standing member of 
Yemen's Socialist Party -- checked that the telephones were not 
bugged. Finally, he lifted one himself, looked underneath, and 
said: "No bugs, we can begin." 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Doctor al-Jifri, the war between North and 
South Yemen broke out after a union which lasted barely four 
years. What has come between Sanaa and Aden? 
  [Al-Jifri] The problem is Salih. At a certain point, the 
northern leader took it into his head to control everything and 
everybody, establishing definite hierarchies. They have a 
certain system and they want to bring it here, but this is 
impossible because we have a democratic orientation and we do 
not accept impositions from anybody. Apart from that, we know 
Salih well: You cannot trust anything he says. He tells heaps 
of lies. Breaking the cease-fire is a blatant example... 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] However, you also broke the cease-fire by 
firing a Scud into Sanaa. 
  [Al-Jifri] We did not fire any missiles. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Who was it, then? 
  [Al-Jifri] I repeat, we did not break the cease-fire. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Doctor al-Jifri, what then is the military 
situation around your al-'Anad air base? 
  [Al-Jifri] The situation is excellent. We had a few problems 
in the beginning. They took the initiative first, and we 
responded. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] However, there was then a partial withdrawal 
on your part... 
  [Al-Jifri] This was purely tactical. In fact, our move took 
them by surprise, and now the southern area is entirely in our 
hands. They are still shelling us from the north. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] What distance are the northerners from Aden? 
  [Al-Jifri] Sixty kilometers. However, we recently destroyed 
one of their trucks, blocked eight of their tanks. In short, we 
chased them back beyond the mountains. Aden is safe, no problem 
there. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Let us suppose, for a minute, that the north 
manages to close in, aiming to conquer Aden... 
  [Al-Jifri] They are incapable of that. The people will 
fight, fight, fight. This is the key point. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] However, war is not simply a matter of will. 
  [Al-Jifri] We have a just cause to defend our country. And 
we will do so, if need be, one street at the time, one house at 
the time. Furthermore, we have new, fresh forces joining us all 
the time. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Meaning conscripts, rounded up and sent to 
the front. 
  [Al-Jifri] No, they are militiamen, in short, reservists. 
They need a couple of days' training and then, indeed, they do 
go to the front. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] What steps are you taking at international 
level to try to put an end to this war? 
  [Al-Jifri] We are striving to obtain other nations' full 
consensus, and many of them have requested the northern leaders 
to stop. But if the latter do not, what can we do? Salih does 
not at all mind killing civilians, he only wants money and power. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] How do you think the situation will now 
develop? 
  [Al-Jifri] I believe our Yemen is here to stay, and that it 
will become a modern state. We are convinced of this. I do not 
believe the people in the north will accept that corrupt regime 
which has divided the country and caused so much suffering. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Do you see in all this the possibility of a 
diplomatic solution, or rather the continuation of war? 
  [Al-Jifri] I believe in diplomatic means to achieve peace. 
But if diplomacy does not work, there are other means of 
achieving peace.

  [Text] Damascus, 24 May (SANA)--Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, 
who is entrusted with forming a cabinet in the Democratic 
Republic of Yemen which was declared in Aden, has denied the 
downfall of any city in the south. He stressed that no party 
has achieved victory over the other in the raging war. 
  In an interview with Radio L'Orient today, al-'Attas, who is 
now in London, said that he will leave for Aden soon to form a 
cabinet and to hold further consultations with the brothers in 
Aden. 
  Concerning President 'Ali Salim al-Bid's presence in 
Hadhramaut, al-'Attas said that Mr. al-Bid is inspecting some 
troops there. 
  Al-'Attas said: We should work to stop the shedding of more 
blood and to save what remains of the Yemeni national resources.

<F P=106> [Reports by 'Abdallah Hammudah in London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT </F>
bureaus in Sanaa and Aden, and Sawsan Abu-Husayn in Cairo: 
"Yemeni Initiative To End the Fighting Between the Two Sides"] 
  [Excerpt] The leadership of the Democratic Republic of 
Yemen in al-Mukalla and Aden yesterday studied an initiative 
from the Sanaa leadership offering a cease-fire in return for a 
cancellation of the declaration of a state in southern Yemen 
without any other conditions such as the conditions previously 
laid down by Sanaa about surrender and trial of what it 
described as the "mutineers" in the leadership of the Yemeni 
Socialist Party [YSP]. 
  As speculations continued all day yesterday about the likely 
reaction of the southern command, observers said that the aim of 
Sanaa's initiative was to "try to block international 
recognition of the new republic which the southerners, faced 
with President 'Ali Salih's intransigence, were forced to 
declare as a last resort to save whatever they can after the 
failure to reach understanding within the context of unity." 
  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that Salim Salih Muhammad, 
member of the Yemeni Presidential Council in the unified state 
and of the southern Presidential council; 'Ali Nasir Muhammad, 
former south Yemeni president; Shaykh Mujahid Abu-Shawarib, 
deputy prime minister in the unified state; and Foreign Minister 
Muhammad Salim Basindwah, all participated in drafting the 
initiative which was promptly accepted by President Salih. A 
high-ranking source said "we are waiting to see what develops 
from that." 
  The initiative of the Yemeni figures came as all parties 
were 
trying to contain the situation by promoting a cease-fire. Some 
sources, however, have emphasized that the southern leadership 
is now laying down two conditions before it considers any move 
on its part. The first: a cease-fire on all fronts; and the 
second: the return of all the southern units now in northern 
Yemen to the south and withdrawal of all northern units that are 
now in the south to the north. 
  It is not known if Sanaa would now accept these conditions.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali, head of the </F>
Political and Foreign Relations Department of the Yemeni 
Socialist Party, by unidentified correspondent; place and date 
not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] You were with us when we heard our 
colleague Mamduh Sa'd's interview with Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim 
al-Iryani. What is your response and how can the ongoing 
conflict in Yemen be contained? 
  [Al-Dali] Actually I believe that the starting point in 
resolving the worsening crisis represented by this ferocious war 
should be an immediate halt to the war. Afterward, we could 
disengage the forces and then sit and talk about anything or any 
issue. 
  [Correspondent] How can the fighting be stopped amid these 
reports and statements by the two sides? 
  [Al-Dali] The aggressor should order a halt to his 
aggressions against the southern and eastern governorates. The 
aggressor must stop his aggressions against the eastern and 
southern governorates. We have agreed on more than one occasion 
to halt the fighting and to accept mediation efforts, and to sit 
down for talks with our brothers, but the other side has refused 
and rejected more than one initiative to halt the fighting. He, 
the aggressor, has to stop the fighting. 
  [Correspondent] President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih is very 
strongly opposed to your declaration of secession from unity. 
  [Al-Dali] We did not choose to proclaim a new state in the 
southern and eastern governorates at our own choosing; there 
were reasons and motives that prompted us to do so. 
  [Correspondent] In a few words, what would you say about the 
YSP's initiative? 
  [Al-Dali] An immediate cease-fire, withdrawing and 
disengaging the forces, and sitting down for talks without 
preconditions.

  [Text] A security official from the office of the mayor of 
Sanaa, the capital, has reported that the casualty toll from the 
Scud missile fired yesterday evening by the renegade, 
secessionist gang in the Socialist Party leadership has reached 
120 people killed or wounded, mostly women and children. The 
missile fell in a densely populated residential neighborhood. 
Rescue teams are still searching for survivors believed to be 
buried under the rubble of the four houses that were leveled. 
Numerous houses across a wide radius around the bombing site 
also suffered substantial damage. 
  The missile, which hit one of the poorer districts of Sanaa, 
was the 23d to target the capital since the war was triggered by 
al-Bid and his separatist coterie. This is in addition to those 
that were launched on other civilian installations and the 
population in Ta'izz, al-Hudaydah, al-Makha, and the Rahidah 
Hospital. 
  The source indicated that the horrific and murderous action 
killed or wounded newborns and caused miscarriages. The victims 
included a physician whose fingers on his right hand were blown 
off while on duty at a nearby hospital. 
  The security source condemned the action as a treacherous, 
gruesome crime. He also condemned the traitor al-Bid's threat 
at a news conference of further Scud missile attacks at 
innocents and civilian establishments in Sanaa and other Yemeni 
cities. This kind of threat, the source said, shows that al-Bid 
and his secessionist band are consumed with such hate that they 
will not hesitate to perpetrate the most gruesome of crimes 
against defenseless innocents comparable to their atrocities 
against the homeland and its unity.

<F P=106> ["Military communique"; place and date not given] </F>
  [Excerpt] A responsible military source from the western 
command of the Kharaz/Bab al-Mandeb front has confirmed that all 
attacking enemy units have received a final coup de grace, along 
with their military equipment, which they tried to (?keep) 
within the borders of the Democratic Republic of Yemen. The 
source said in a press statement that in the course of their 
battle operations last night and this morning, our forces 
succeeded in repulsing the attacking forces, destroying them, 
and chasing their remnants across the border of the Democratic 
Republic of Yemen. Our forces captured and destroyed large 
quantities of military materiel. In his statement, the source 
gave details and types of the military material captured, saying 
they included 15 tanks, a number of BM-21 Katyusha rocket 
launchers, various field guns, military vehicles, various kinds 
of communications equipment, and large numbers of night vision 
apparatus. Several tons of ammunition, small arms, and war 
materiel were also captured. 
  The source reported that the sands of the desert had 
received 
thousands of dead and wounded from the enemy, from Jihaf to al- 
Buzah. Many died in the fierce heat of the desert, due to 
shortages of supplies and water. 
  The source said that the operation to mop up and pursue 
pockets of resistance was still in progress at the time the 
preparation of this military communique, stressing that what 
remained of the enemy's vehicles and his equipment would 
probably be captured or destroyed. [passages omitted]

heroes in the valiant Armed Forces units, the forces protecting 
unity, democracy, and constitutional legitimacy pursue the 
combat and combing missions they have been tasked to carry out 
on all axes and in all sectors. They are successfully carrying 
out these missions which are related to the field operations. 
These include their staunch confrontation of the sabotage 
operations to which the gangs of secession and rebellion have 
resorted as a result of their defeat and the collapse of their 
dens. These gangs are committing treacherous criminal actions 
against civilians, populated areas, and against strategic and 
civilian installations, including attacks on cities with 
missiles from the air, sea, and land targetting the forces 
protecting unity and constitutional legitimacy in al-'Alam, Ra's 
Imran, and Zinjibar city. They sustained further losses in 
weapons, equipment, and military hardware, and maliciously 
harmed citizens and their properties. 
  The air defenses of the forces of unity and constitutional 
legitimacy shot down one MiG-21 and a helicopter. 
  The valiant Armed Forces units on the other axes continue to 
pursue the remnants who flee toward Hadhramaut governorate from 
the Sbabwah axis and to comb the remaining pockets and dens on 
the Lahij-Aden axis. 
  The forces protecting unity, democracy, and constitutional 
legitimacy continue to carry out their duties with high morale 
and complete confidence in the proximity of the date when the 
people will triumph over the enemies of their free, united, 
dignified, and just life, the agents, criminals and evil 
traitors in the gang of apostasy and secession within the Yemeni 
Socialist Party command, God willing.

Cairo radio correspondent about France's stand on the

As a general rule, France believes that the Yemen unity, rather

  [Text] Mahabad (West Azerbaijan Prov.), May 24, 
IRNA--Iraq's Kurdish Revolutionary Hizballah forces killed 17 
attackers of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK] in Chuman 
and Galaleh regions over the past two days of fighting in 
northeastern Iraq. 
  According to a Kurdish Revolutionary Hizballah spokesman 
here 
Tuesday [24 May] two combatants of the Kurdish Islamic forces 
also lost their lives as a result of clashes with Jalal 
Talabani's PUK. The source said another 11 PUK forces also 
were shot dead in an attack by Hizballah in the Be'erge and 
Qasruk regions. 
  In related news from the Iranian city of Sanandaj, 11 PUK 
forces were killed by the Islamic Movement of Kurdistan (IMK) 
which managed to capture Sirvan camp, 5 kms off 
Halabja-Suleymaniya route on Monday. 
  A source close to IMK said its forces also succeeded in 
gaining control of the strategic Hiro village in Qal'e Dizeh of 
Suleymaniya in an attack made on PUK positions over the past two 
days. 
  The source said 15 other PUK forces, including PUK 
commander, 
Hassan Rasul Omar, were killed in two other attacks. 
  Earlier, PUK had acknowledged the death of Hassan Kavestani, 
one of its top members who fell in the battle with IMK forces a

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with PUK Secretary General Jalal </F>
Talabani in Damascus, by 'Adnan Husayn in London; date not given] 
  [Text] Jalal Talabani, secretary general of the Patriotic 
Union of Kurdistan [PUK] who is currently in the Syrian capital 
Damascus, has stated that "foreign interventions" had fuelled 
the fighting between his party and the Kurdistan Democratic 
Party [KDP] led by Mas'ud Barzani. In a telephone interview 
with AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, he said that he wanted to return to his 
headquarters in Irbil to contribute to the efforts to bring 
about a cease-fire and normalize the situation in the Iraqi 
Kurdish areas. 
  At the beginning of the interview he emphasized that calm 
has 
returned to these areas after Friday's [20 May] agreement 
between his party and Barzani's party. Following is the text of 
the interview. 
  [Husayn] What are your expectations? Will that calm 
continue or will it collapse again? 
  [Talabani] I am very hopeful that the agreements reached by 
our two parties will be implemented and that security will again 
prevail in Kurdistan. It is now clear that resolving issues by 
military means is neither possible nor useful. It only serves 
the enemies of the Kurdish people. The illusions of those who 
thought that they could force the PUK into anything have been 
shattered and it has been proved on the ground that that is 
impossible. 
  [Husayn] The question now is this: How could fighting have 
gone on for three weeks despite several agreements reached to 
stop it and despite the fact that all parties realize that the 
fighting is against the interests of the Kurdish people who are 
the losers in any case? Does it mean that the Kurdish 
leadership is incapable of controlling the situation or that at 
least one of the two parties, for some ulterior motives, does 
not want the fighting to stop? 
  [Talabani] What has happened was not just infighting between 
brothers. It was against the Kurdish people and their real 
interests; against the Iraqi people, the Iraqi opposition, and 
the Kurdistan Front; against the real interests of both the KDP 
and the PUK. It only serves the Baghdad regime. The PUK is not 
responsible for the continuation of the fighting. We have tried 
to stop the fighting since the first agreement but foreign 
intervention fuelled the fighting. Three attacks were launched 
from inside Iran with the participation of Islamists and some 
other brothers who had forgotten the disadvantages of 
cooperating with the foreigner. That caused complications. The 
outbreak of fighting in one area causes repercussions in 
another. Today I contacted my colleagues and reaffirmed to them 
the need for observing a cease-fire and adhering to the 
agreements reached in that connection. I warned against foreign 
plots to foment sedition and I urged them not to respond to 
provocations and to overlook them if necessary in the interest 
of internal peace. 
  [Husayn] Do you have any material evidence of foreign 
intervention? 
  [Talabani] Yes, our evidence is that the attacking forces 
came from beyond the borders and were seen by everyone. Some 
officials of the United Nations and humanitarian organizations 
operating in Kurdistan went to Halabjah and saw with their own 
eyes how artillery shells and missiles were fired from there. 
Some ammunition boxes were also left behind. Local inhabitants 
who were forced to leave these areas testified to officials of 
the United Nations and humanitarian organizations that they saw 
foreigners participating in the fighting. 
  [Husayn] Some people wonder why you have remained abroad. 
They believe that an early return to the region by you would 
possibly have changed many things in favor of stopping the 
fighting in the first few days. 
  [Talabani] I am grateful to the people who say that my 
presence inside would have improved the situation. That is a 
great honor. The truth is that on the first day of the fighting 
I sent a cable to brother Mas'ud Barzani authorizing him to head 
the political bureaus of both parties and to try to calm the 
situation and stop the infighting, but when the fighting spread, 
Brother Barzani contacted me and said that there was a need for 
me to be there. So we agreed that we would make efforts to 
secure my return by air via Turkey or by land via Syria provided 
Brother Barzani, Brother Ahmad al-Jalabi (chairman of the 
Executive Council of the opposition's National Congress), and 
others are present in the border area to ensure my safe return, 
particularly as in the areas of Bahdinan [as transliterated] (in 
the Dahuk Governorate through which passes the road to Irbil) 
there are many members of gangs which take their orders from the 
Iraqi regime. You must remember that several partisan figures 
where killed there by these gangs, including an official of the 
Communist Party, an Assyrian member of the parliament of 
Kurdistan, a member of the Political Bureau of the Kurdistan 
Toilers Party, and some of our colleagues and officials from the 
two parties. There were also several attacks on UN officials 
there. That is why it was necessary to take precautionary 
measures to ensure safe return. I personally have cancelled 
several important foreign engagements to expedite my return, 
including a visit to Japan, a visit to Australia, and a visit to 
Cyprus to attend minorities conferences. I cancelled these 
programs and went to Damascus in order to return to Kurdistan. 
I was accompanied by Iraqi National Congress [INC] leading 
members. Regrettably, however, the brothers did not come to the 
borders as agreed. We made efforts with the allies to secure 
our return by air but they informed us that after (last month's) 
incident in which two U.S. helicopters were shot down by two 
U.S. military aircraft, helicotper movements have been restrict 
and the only possibility was to secure my arrival in Zakhu (near 
the border with Turkey), but that was not enough as far as I was 
concerned. I also made efforts with Turkey and Iran for the 
same purpose. I must say that I am not the only member of the 
PUK leadership who is abroad. There are five other leadership 
members and our return is important not only as far as the 
fighting is concerned but it is also important for our party's 
work at this stage. 
  [Husayn] So when do you expect to return? 
  [Talabani] Before the end of this month, I hope. We have 
taken certain measures for that purpose but I cannot reveal them 
now. It may be useful to tell you that I am in constant and 
direct contact with Kurdistan by telephone and radio, and I am 
following the situation hour by hour and I talk to my colleagues 
there five to 10 times a day.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Saddam Expels Senior Officials and </F>
Military Figures Who Come from 'Izzat al-Duri's Village"] 
  [Text] London, AL-HAYAH -- Iraqi opposition quarters have 
stressed that President Saddam Husayn has launched a purge 
campaign among the regime's ranks, focusing on prominent 
figures, all of whom come from al-Duri (the village of al-Duri 
is near the village of al-'Awjah in Tikrit, the president's 
birthplace) -- from where 'Izzat al-Duri, his deputy in the 
presidency, the Armed Forces command, and the ruling Ba'th Party 
-- comes. In a statement distributed in London and a copy of 
which AL-HAYAH has received, the Free Iraqi Council said that 
Saddam accused a number of senior officials from al-Duri of 
conspiring against the regime. They are: Tali' al-Duri, 
military governor general; 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Duri, director of 
public security and former member of the Ba'th Party Regional 
Command, who was in charge of the Mosul organization in the 
past; Khadr al-Duri, former deputy of former intelligence chief 
Barzan al-Tikriti, Saddam's half-brother; and Sabir al-Duri, 
former intelligence chief. 
  The council's statement said that 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Duri's 
family has been expelled from its home in the exclusive 
al-Mansur area, west of Baghdad, and that the house has been 
turned into offices for one of the Ba'th Party's organizations. 
  Furthermore, a number of Army officers and party officials 
have been pensioned off. Some of them are being investigated.

<F P=106> [Article by Patrick Bishop: "Saddam Losing Grip as Trade </F>
Sanctions Bite"] 
  [Text] Saddam Husayn's iron grip on Iraq may finally be 
slackening due to unrelenting international sanctions against 
his regime, according to British and American assessments. 
  Officials believe that the economic embargo imposed after 
the 
invasion of Kuwait is restricting the dictator's ability to buy 
loyalty and increasing the chances of a successful coup. 
  Reports of defections by military officers and terrorist 
attacks in Baghdad against government offices have fuelled 
speculation that the regime's hold is weakening. 
  President Bill Clinton's National Security Adviser, Mr 
Anthony Lake, noted with approval recently that "despite 
Saddam's efforts to buy loyalties, sanctions are taking their 
toll on the crucial inner circle on which the regime depends. 
  "There are now frequent reports of coup attempts and unrest 
among the relatively privileged Iraqi elite." 
  Mr Lake went on to say that "these trends could lead to new 
conditions for the citizens of Iraq and new opportunities to 
build a more peaceful and normal relationship between Iraq and 
the outside world" -- a coy reference to the possibility of 
Saddam's overthrow. 
  The hope that the dictator could be ousted in the 
not-too-distant future has increased American determination not 
to slacken the international blockade. 
  So far, London and Washington have managed to resist 
pressure 
in the Security Council to reward Saddam for his more 
co-operative attitude towards UN inspectors trying to track down 
his weapons of mass destruction. 
  The advocates of a less stringent policy are led by Russia, 
for whom Iraq is a major debtor. But France also has sound 
economic reasons for softening the line against Saddam. 
  It had lucrative economic ties with Baghdad before the war, 
buying Iraqi oil and selling military aircraft. French 
enterprises are already positioning themselves to be in the best 
possible position to exploit opportunities once sanctions are 
lifted. 
  The Elf Aquitaine and Total oil companies have held 
extensive 
talks with the Iraqis over the future exploitation of two fields 
in southern Iraq where there is an estimated 20-30 billion 
barrels waiting to be pumped -- more than in the North Sea. 
  The French insist that nothing will be signed until 
sanctions 
have been eased or lifted. But their actions have caused anger 
in London, where they are viewed as undercutting British 
commercial interests and breaking the spirit of the allied 
strategy against Saddam. 
  After initially believing that its interests were best 
served 
by leaving a weakened Saddam in place to hold the country 
together and act as a counterweight to anti-Western Iran, the US 
has come round to the view that it would be better for Saddam to 
go. 
  The US now supports the Iraqi National Congress, the broad 
spectrum exile organisation which has moved its headquarters to 
the Kurdish-held north of the country.

  [Excerpts] A round of talks was held at the National 
Command of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party [ASBP] today between 
the ASBP delegation, led by comrade 'Abdallah al-Ahmar, ASBP 
assistant secretary general, and the delegation of the Chinese 
Communist Party, led by Comrade Wei Jianxing, member of the 
Political Bureau and head of the Chinese Federation of Trade 
Unions. [passage omitted] 
  Comrade al-Ahmar delivered a speech in which he stressed 
Syria's adherence to its firm principles to build a new society, 
to deal with the current peace process in our region, and to 
establish a just and comprehensive peace based on international 
legitimacy and its relevant resolutions, particularly 
Resolutions 242, 338, and 425, which stipulate the need to 
return the occupied Arab territories and the usurped rights to 
their rightful owners. 
  Comrade al-Ahmar stressed that Syria wants to make this 
process successful by achieving its goals and to seriously 
contribute, along with the honest forces in the world, to 
efforts to make this march successful. He also explained that 
the peace process is stumbling because of Israel's intransigent 
position and its refusal to commit itself to withdrawing from 
all the Arab territories, which it has occupied since 1967, as 
stipulated in UN resolutions. 
  In his speech, comrade al-Ahmar called on the international 
community, foremost of which are its active forces, to exert 
efforts to implement the resolutions of international legitimacy 
and to force Israel to implement its relevant parts in order to 
end its occupation of the Arab territories, to remove hotbeds, 
and to achieve security, stability, and peace for everyone. He 
pointed out that Syria would continue efforts to achieve a just 
and comprehensive peace and would not relinquish an inch of its 
occupied territories in the Golan, or any Arab right. 
  For his part, Comrade Jianxing, head of the Chinese 
Communist 
Party delegation, spoke about current developments in China and 
the successes achieved in recent years under the policy it has 
defined for itself. He also stressed his party's desire to 
promote relations with the ASBP and between his country and 
Syria and urged continued consultations on the most important 
current international issues. 
  He then stressed his country's support for the 
implementation 
of UN Resolutions 242, 338, and 425 regarding the Arab-Israeli 
conflict in order to achieve a solution to the Middle East 
problem based on these resolutions and in a way that achieves 
just and comprehensive peace in the region. He also praised 
Syria's position, its desire to achieve peace under the 
leadership of President Hafiz al-Asad, and its status and role 
both on the regional and international levels, as well as the 
developments and successes he has seen in Syria. He wished 
Syria and its people further progress and prosperity.

  [Text] Cairo, 25 May (MENA) -- AL-AHRAM says the Sudanese 
Government, through its illogical measures against Egypt and its 
illegal confiscation of Egyptian property in Sudan, proves that 
it does not have the required level of political thinking and 
that it is exploiting Egypt's obvious tolerance, patience, and 
rational reaction to such measures. 
  The paper stresses in its editorial today that Egypt does 
not 
want to add a new crisis to those already experienced by the 
Arabs or erupting in their faces occasionally. Egypt believes 
that the Sudanese measures, although tactless, are too small and 
trivial to cause a serious crisis between Cairo and Khartoum. 
  This being so, the paper adds, the Sudanese Government 
should 
realize that Egypt's silence does not stem from weakness, its 
patience does not reflect a lack of will, and its failure to 
retaliate does not proceed from fear. 
  AL-AHRAM calls on the Sudanese Government to return to logic 
and understand the truth of Egypt's position and policy so that 
it may not take similar unwise and shortsighted measures in 
future. 
  The paper also urges the government in Khartoum to learn 
from 
the experience of insensible people here and there in the Arab 
world, which suffers the consequences of the foolish policies 
pursued by some of its leaders.

Jad-al-Haqq late last night to inform him of its protest over 
the two statements the Egyptian Foreign Ministry issued in 
reaction to the Sudanese authority's closure of some Egyptian 
establishments and homes in Sudan last Friday. 
  The Sudanese ministry claimed that these measures were 
within 
the context of enforcing the new Sudanese law on rents.

  [Text] Addis Ababa, 25 May (MENA) -- Current OAU Chairman 
President Husni Mubarak has stated that if the African 
continent's struggle was designed to resist foreign powers that 
occupied the continent, the crucial issue that imposes itself 
today is to seek solutions for the inherent economic and social 
problems that hamper the continent's march toward a better 
future. 
  In a message he gave today to mark the 31st anniversary of 
the OAU's establishment in 1963, President Mubarak pointed to 
the achievements, particularly the Abuja agreement on setting up 
the African Economic Group, which guided Africa's first step 
toward economic integration. 
  The president affirmed that this achievement will leave its 
mark on economic activity on both the regional and global levels. 
  In his message, President Mubarak emphasized that the 
political achievement was made during the recent African summit 
in Cairo in 1993, which ratified the Cairo Declaration on 
setting up a mechanism to resolve African disputes within the 
framework of the OAU through dialogue and reconciliation. 
  He added that the third achievement was represented in the 
triumph of wisdom and political will in South Africa; a triumph 
that resulted in the establishment of the first democratic, 
nonracist government. He remarked that this government came to 
reflect the will of most South Africans after three centuries of 
struggle. 
  Mubarak referred to other African achievements, represented 
in the pursuit of democracy and pluralism in most African 
states. He remarked that these two things are bound to enhance 
stability and create a favorable climate for the continent's 
economic development. 
  As current OAU chairman, President Mubarak said that in 
spite 
of the political and economic achievements in 1994, some African 
inhabitants persist in the obstinacy they developed as a result 
of bloody domestic wars and disputes. He referred in that 
context to deteriorating conditions in Somalia, Rwanda, and 
Burundi in addition to other problems facing Angola, Liberia, 
and other states.

  [Text] The Islamic Group has dismissed recent charges by 
the Egyptian Human Rights Organization saying it had killed 
eight Christians in Asyut over the past four months. 
  The Islamic Group issued a statement saying that killing 
Copts is not its objective, adding that security authorities 
have always tried to raise accusations against it to conceal the 
facts and their incompetence at identifying the real criminals. 
The security authorities' objective is to distort the image of 
the Islamic Group in Egypt and abroad, it added. 
  The Islamic Group said that it is concerned with the issue 
of 
the Copts and that the Copts' rights, which were approved by 
Islam, will be respected at present and in future.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Ala' al-Bahhar] </F>
  [Text] The security service departments will launch 
wide-scale campaigns over the next two weeks in an attempt to 
arrest many members of the militant extremist groups. The 
security departments estimate the number of group members at 
5,000. 
  A ranking security official has told AL-SHA'B that in the 
next stage the security service will step up armed confrontation 
in Asyut. He said a timetable had been drawn up by the interior 
ministry to liquidate the leaders of the extremist groups inside 
and outside the prisons. He added that the armed confrontation 
operations will last for a while. He admitted that the security 
service has failed to properly monitor the militant elements 
within the extremist groups. 
  The official said that the interior ministry had covered up 
this failure by announcing that 98 leading extremists were 
captured even though most of them were detained arbitrarily. 
Some of the detainees now in custody of the state security 
intelligence will appear on television and in the papers and be 
repentant as former members of extremist groups. 
  The security official added that the announcement on the 
latest organization was prompted by the political leadership to 
confront the activities of the lawyers association, which is 
calling for an investigation into the killing of lawyer 
'Abd-al-Harith Madani. The interior ministry has said that 
Madani was a link between the Islamic Group's leaders inside and 
outside the prisons.

  [Text] Lebanon today lodged a protest with the UN Security 
Council against Israel for the kidnapping of Mustafa al-Dirani, 
the official in the faithful resistance, from his home in 
al-Biqa' on Saturday 21 May. 
  Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz clarified that the complaint 
does not yet request the Security Council to convene. He noted 
that Lebanon reserves the right to ask the Security Council to 
convene when necessary. Minister Buwayz described the 
kidnapping as an act of piracy that violates human rights and 
Lebanon's sovereignty, and attacks its security and stability. 
  REUTER cited a responsible official at the Foreign Ministry 
as saying that the Lebanese complaint also demands that Israel 
should quickly release al-Dirani and return him to Lebanon since 
this act is considered a violation of Lebanon's sovereignty and 
contradicts the trends toward peace in the region.

  [Text] Commenting on the Israeli military operation in 
al-Biqa', Hizballah Secretary General Hasan Nasrallah said the 
kidnapping of al-Dirani has more implications than the enemy has 
announced regarding the need to secure information about the 
detained Israeli airman. He said the operation was designed to 
achieve political objectives in Lebanon. He called for dealing 
with this incident with the same importance and objectives given 
it by the enemy. 
  Shaykh Nasrallah emphasized that this cowardly action 
confirms the inability of the Zionists to face the heroes of the 
resistance who are confronting the enemy's oppression and forces 
in broad daylight, recalling the heroic steadfastness of the 
mujahidin during the seven-day war.

  [Text] Israel's abduction of Mustafa al-Dirani continues to 
provoke condemnation and denunciation. 
  Anwar al-Khalil, minister of state for Chamber of Deputies 
affairs, asked about the U.S. stance on the kidnapping 
operation. He said the United States might, intentionally or 
otherwise, have paved the way for Israel to pursue its terrorist 
policy, first, by ignoring Lebanon on its shuttle tour and 
second, by including Syria on the list of terrorist states. He 
stressed that the kidnapping will increase Lebanon's 
determination to adhere to the resistance as one of the most 
legitimate methods to liberate the land. 
  The Loyalty to the Resistance Bloc [Hizballah parliamentary 
bloc] has stressed that the kidnapping represented overt 
defiance and provocation. It called for the highest degree of 
alertness and vigilance. 
  The act of piracy was also denounced by Deputy Muhammad 
Baydun, the Amal Movement, the Progressive Socialist Party, and 
the Syrian Social Nationalist Party.

  [Excerpt] General Antoine Lahd, accompanied by Israeli 
North Region Commander General Yitzhaq Mordekhay, Ground Army 
Commander Emmanuel Saqr, and Liaison Unit Commander Gabi 
Ashkenazi, visited al-Bayyadah yesterday to wish a happy 'Id 
al-Adha to Druze religious leaders. General Lahd hoped the next 
year will bring happiness and peace and that all foreign armies, 
including the Israeli and Syrian armies, will withdraw from 
Lebanon. But he noted that the Israelis are deployed on a 
particular part of the Lebanese territory for their security 
needs. The objectives and motives of the Syrians are known to 
all. 
  Mordekhay offered his 'Id congratulations and said that the 
region is enjoying security, thanks to the efforts of its sons, 
especially members of the South Lebanese Army. He said the 
Israeli soldiers have been ordered to be careful after 
information that sabotage elements are trying to kidnap them. 
He said he currently has no information about any specific 
reaction by the sabotage organizations in Lebanon to the 
kidnapping of Mustafa al-Dirani. He said the Israeli Army is 
prepared for any eventuality. [passage omitted]

held talks with the U.S. Secretary of State, Mr. Warren 
Christopher, in Washington last night. In a statement before 
the talks, the president said efforts should continue for the 
solution of problems created by the Pressler Amendment. He said 
the issue could only be settled by pursuing the principles of 
(?nondiscrimination) and equality. He said Pakistan was trying 
to improve relations in all such spheres as did not come under 
the jurisdiction of Pressler Amendment. [sentence as heard] 
President Leghari said both Pakistan and the United States 
agreed to revive bilateral relations and friendship during the 
visit of the U.S. Under Secretary of State [title as heard], Mr. 
Strobe Talbott, to Pakistan earlier this year. 
  Mr. Christopher also made a brief statement before the talks 
and referred to shared concern of the two countries on issues 
like elimination of weapons of mass destruction, regional peace 
and security, and economic reforms. 
  Later, when Mr. Christopher left the venue after concluding 
his talks, the Assistant Secretary of State [title as heard], 
Mr. Talbott, remained there and continued deliberations with the 
president of Pakistan.

<F P=106> [Editorial:"Nuclear Nonproliferation ... President Leghari's </F>
Categorical Announcement"] 
  [Text] Talking to the Associated Press of Pakistan 
correspondent in London, President Farooq Ahamd Khan Leghari has 
said Pakistan will not accept any unilateral restriction on the 
nuclear nonproliferation issue, because a solution that imposes 
restrictions on Pakistan but not on India is unacceptable. We 
want restrictions on the entire world, especially on all 
countries in the region. From the very beginning, Pakistan has 
adhered to a principled and just stand on nuclear 
nonproliferation -- to forcefully support the issue, especially 
to extend all sorts of cooperation to the international 
community in eliminating a nuclear arms race in South Asia -- 
provided India signs the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] 
at the global level or be prepared to endorse any acceptable 
solution on the issue at the regional level. But, as India is 
crazy to become a mini-superpower in the region, forcing its 
hegemony on other countries, it is bent on rejecting every 
proposal on nuclear nonproliferation which impedes any progress 
in the direction. Now, after Indian Prime Minister Narasimha 
Rao's visit to the United States, President Clinton himself has 
admitted that India is not willing to extend any cooperation on 
nuclear nonproliferation and human rights issues and has refused 
to accept the U.S. proposals as well. Under these 
circumstances, the sincerity and truthfulness of Pakistan's 
position has come to the foreground that it is not Pakistan 
erecting obstacles in the way of nuclear nonproliferation but 
rather India, which is not prepared to curtail its nuclear 
program at any cost. As long as India does not do it, Pakistan 
is not ready to accept any unilateral restrictions on its 
nuclear program. Now that the differences between India and the 
United States on the nuclear nonproliferation issue could not be 
removed, Pakistan should take advantage of the situation and 
intensify its efforts to convince the United States of the 
soundness of its position so as to get the illegitimate embargo 
on economic and military aid lifted.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Nuclear Program Is the Protector of the </F>
Nation, and the Nation Knows How To Protect It"] 
  [Text] Mian Mohammad Nawaz Sharif, the opposition leader 
and former prime minister, has said that the nation does not 
want to make any compromise on Kashmir and nuclear issues. The 
Pakistan People's Party government may cease to exist, but the 
nuclear program cannot be wound up. Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan, 
chairman of the National Assembly's Kashmir Committee, has also 
said that the foreign minister's statement about the acceptance 
of the U.S. proposal for inspection of Pakistan's nuclear 
program is tantamount to ridiculing the whole nation. The 
Pakistan Muslim League-J also expressed concern over the foreign 
minister's statement about Pakistan's readiness to accept the 
inspection of its nuclear installations and declared that we 
will protect the nuclear program the way people protect the 
dignity of mothers and sisters. Sheikh Abdur Rashid, deputy 
chief organizer of the Muslim League and member of the National 
Assembly, has warned in a peculiar way. He said that he will 
burn himself at Lahore's Minar-i-Pakistan tower if the present 
government allows a nuclear inspection. Various religious 
parties have also condemned the foreign minister's statement and 
expressed the apprehension that the government might have knelt 
down to the United States. They feel that the term of 
"nonphysical inspection" of Pakistan's nuclear installations 
actually means the American idea of establishing Indian hegemony 
in the region. Hamid Gul, former chief of the Inter Service 
Intelligence, has also said that accepting the U.S. conditions 
on the nuclear program will be a national tragedy. 
  The foreign minister's statement hints at grave dangers. The 
nation does not accept the U.S. inspection in any manner. We 
had taken a strong note of the foreign minister's remarks in 
these columns the other day. Despite his prompt statement 
refuting his earlier remarks, we had suggested him to think 
twice and be very careful before making any statement on the 
most sensitive issues of the nation. The foreign affairs 
department requires great caution. The past record of Sardar 
Asif Ali is not that enviable, either. He had accused Pakistan 
of being involved in terrorism when he was a minister in the 
previous government. We had to suffer for his accusation, and 
the sufferings manifested themselves in the form of U.S. steps 
against us and our failure to present the Kashmir issue at the 
Geneva Human Rights Commission meeting. Similarly, he continues 
to make irresponsible remarks about Islam. A progovernment 
paper issued a clarification on his behalf yesterday. The irony 
is that instead of accepting the clarification as true, the 
paper published an editorial supporting the foreign minister's 
statement. The Foreign Office also issued a rejection of the 
statement and blamed the newspapers, saying that they carried 
the report in an irresponsible manner, despite the fact that the 
same report was also released by the government news agency of 
ASSOCIATED PRESS OF PAKISTAN itself. 
  The nation is not willing to accept the argument that the 
foreign minister was not careful when making the statement or 
that the press attributed a wrong statement to him. There is 
definitely something wrong, and the statement, not the refusal, 
is more important. As the issue is very sensitive and delicate, 
and it is feared that a compromise has been made on a program 
that grantees national security and the country's independence, 
it becomes imperative that the foreign minister make a 
clarification of his statement to the nation, either at the 
Senate or the National Assembly or on television, and assure the 
people that his government is not involved in any compromise 
with the United States. Only after this will the nation decide 
whether it is satisfied with the clarification or the statement. 
  Any kind of compromise on the nuclear program is not in the 
interest of Pakistan. The nation has already been afflicted by 
grief at the disclosure of the news that the nuclear program has 
been capped. The United States is now demanding an inspection. 
It is apparently trying to compensate by promising to supply 
the F-16 planes. The fact is that the F-16 is Pakistan's right. 
The cost of these planes have already been paid by Pakistan 
under a bilateral trade deal. Any kind of interference by the 
United States in our nuclear program, whether physical or 
nonphysical, that is, whether a visit to our country by a team 
of U.S. inspectors as was done in Iraq or monitoring the Kahuta 
nuclear plant through telescopes installed on satellites, is not 
acceptable to the Pakistani nation. If a government accepts such 
a proposal and defends it by juggling words, it will only be 
committing an act of stupidity. The reality is that the nation 
knows how to protect the nuclear program, which protects the 
Pakistani nation. The present government might have some ill 
intentions, but it should not make any mistake in understanding 
the nation's aspirations.

nonproliferation without any discrimination. He said in

and will give serious consideration to any specific proposals 
the United States may make in these consultations.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "President Clinton's Incomprehensible Claim"] </F>
  [Text] The U.S. policy on South Asia continues to change 
constantly. Until recently, the U.S. Government had held a very 
strong position against Pakistan on the nuclear nonproliferation 
issue. Consequently, not only did U.S. economic and military 
aid to Pakistan remain suspended for the last four years, the 
delivery of planes for which Pakistan already paid $658 million 
appeared to be impossible. For some time, there had been little 
change in the U.S. stand. The United States then started 
describing Kashmir as a disputed territory and exerted some 
pressure on India on its nuclear program. An impression was 
created that the United States was exerting the same kind of 
pressure on both India and Pakistan, and identical pressure was 
also being exerted on both of them on the missile program, too. 
  However, President Clinton has now sent a report to the U.S. 
Congress in which a bizarre claim has been made that Pakistan 
has been blackmailing India by saying that if the Kashmir issue 
is not resolved, then not only will a war break out between the 
two countries, it will be a nuclear war. In his report, 
President Clinton has said that the impression created by 
Pakistan that a durable peace cannot be established in South 
Asia and that the region will face danger until the Kashmir 
issue is resolved is also incorrect. Though President Clinton 
has expressed an unrealistic and incomprehensible opinion in his 
report, it is gratifying that 12 members of the U.S. Congress, 
in a letter to President Clinton, have demanded that the Indian 
prime minister, who is beginning a visit to the United States, 
on 14 May be asked to stop human rights violations in Kashmir 
and apprised that if India wants technical and economic 
assistance from the United States, then the former should also 
pursue the ethical principles that are very dear to the United 
States. The letter added that India has been holding the 12.5 
million people of occupied Kashmir under its domination against 
their will and is trying to subjugate them with the help of 
500,000 troops. The letter also asked the U.S. President to 
play his role in securing a peaceful and durable solution to the 
Kashmir dispute. We believe that the United States wields 
considerable influence and is capable of playing an effective 
role. If the United States plays a role in resolving this 
dispute, then not only will it be contributing to paving the way 
for a just world order, it will also be making several 
generations of Kashmiris, Pakistanis, and Indians grateful to 
the United States. 
  Apart from the aforesaid letter from the U.S. legislators, 
grave concern was expressed by a number of Democratic and 
Republican Congressmen over the Kashmir situation at a function 
marking the release of a latest book on Kashmir by the eminent 
U.S. writer, Professor William Baker. They also expressed 
amazement over the United States and other developed nation for 
their remaining silent spectators to the human rights violations 
in Kashmir. With tearful eyes, Professor William Baker told the 
gathering that he had no words to describe the awful scenes of 
atrocities he witnessed during his visit to Kashmir. The views 
expressed by prominent U.S. legislators and scholars indicate 
that informed, influential, and powerful circles of the United 
States are well aware of the situation in Kashmir. 
  Under such circumstances, President Clinton's allegation 
against Pakistan that it is blackmailing India on the Kashmir 
question and creating a wrong impression in the world that a 
durable peace cannot be achieved in South Asia unless the 
Kashmir issue is resolved reflects the incomprehensible logic of 
the U.S. President. The head of the world's most powerful 
country should not be so unfamiliar with the issues of an 
important region and the nature of dangers it faces. It has 
been America's age-old weakness and desire to drag India as 
close to itself as possible. In the past, a sort of 
justification was that the United States wanted to keep India 
away from the Soviet Union, but no such compulsion exists now. 
Therefore, the United States should keep in view the objective 
realities while dealing with India. 
  On the eve of Narasimha Rao's visit, the Indian Government 
has announced that its missile manufacture and testing will 
continue according to schedule, and the entire program will be 
completed by July. It is amazing is that despite such a 
categorical announcement by India, the U.S. President is 
alleging that Pakistan is raising the specter of a nuclear war. 
It is imperative that the Government of Pakistan immediately 
obtain the latest report of President Clinton and apprise the 
U.S. Government of Pakistan's reaction after studying it. 
President Leghari is scheduled to visit the United States, and 
he will hold talks with U.S. authorities despite it being a 
private visit. These talks will yield results only when 
Pakistan's viewpoint is clearly explained to the U.S. side. The 
Government of Pakistan should convey its reaction in 
categorical terms to Washington on the U.S. President's latest 
report.

  [Text] Mecca, May 24, IRNA -- Although eye-witnesses and 
hospital officials say a large number of pilgrims were trampled 
to death in a ceremony known as "stoning the devil" in Mina, 10 
kms east of Mecca Monday, Saudi Arabia has so far refused to 
disclose the number of casualties. 
  In a bid to acquit Saudi Arabia of any charges of negligence 
towards providing security for pilgrims, a government official 
at the Health Ministry announced Monday that 829 pilgrims had 
died in accidents or from old age and heat since May 12. 
Eye-witnesses blame yesterday's tragic event on the 
inefficiency of Saudi officials and their permission to [allow] 
small and large motor cars to move in the region. 
  There are contradictory reports of casualties released by 
representative offices of various countries in Mecca but none of 
them can be confirmed because of the lack of official statistics 
and Riyadh's silence on the issue.

  [Text] Tehran, May 24, IRNA -- Majlis Speaker 'Ali Akbar 
Nateq-Nuri said in a press conference here today that the 
dispute between Iran and the UAE should be resolved mutually and 
others have no right to interfere in the matter. The speaker 
was referring to a recent remark by the Saudi king who sided 
with the UAE in its dispute with Iran over the island. 
Nateq-Nuri said Iran was committed to the accord signed in 1971 
between Iran and the emir of Sharjah [Al-Shariqah] on Abu Musa 
Island. 
  He said Iran had only heightened security at the island 
after 
arresting a spy around the island and that this had made the UAE 
officials unhappy. He said bilateral talks should continue to 
resolve the minor disputes between the two countries, in order 
not to provide the "aliens to engage in mischief." The 
negotiations on the matter had been halted by the United Arab 
Emirates, he said. 
  About Iran's relations with Egypt and foreign minister's 
imminent visit to Cairo, he said Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar 
Velayati will visit Cairo to attend the upcoming meeting of the 
Non-aligned Movement (NAM). On possible talks between 
Iran-Egyptian foreign ministers on the sideline of the NAM 
meeting, he said there were no restrictions on holding talks 
between the foreign minister and his counterparts from Egypt or 
other countries. On the obstacles in the way of improving 
Tehran-Cairo relations, Nateq-Nuri said the main stumbling block 
was the spread of the spirit of Islamism in Egypt that the 
Egyptian officials wrongly attribute to the Islamic Republic of 
Iran. 
  On Iran's foreign debts, the speaker said the amount of the 
debts was no problem to Iran in light of its huge natural 
resources. He said that most of the countries of the world are 
debtors, but, the big powers magnified Iran's debts due to their 
hostile attitude towards Iran. 
  On the Middle East peace process and the probability of 
resolving tension between Syria and Israel, he said Iran's 
relations with Syria were too solid to easily worsen. In the 
meantime, he said, "we recommend the Syrian officials not to 
damage their political prestige because Syria will get nothing 
from the Zionist regime". 
  About import of the U.S. goods and if they would leave any 
cultural impact, he said there was no room for concern regarding 
the arrival of certain American products such as Coca Cola. 
Because, he said, "our Islamic and national culture is too 
strong to be affected negatively by such minor issues." 
  On the Iran-Iraq relations, he said numerous issues still 
remained to be solved including the UN Security Council 
Resolution 598 and the issue of Iranian prisoners of war (pow) 
as well as the issue of pilgrimage to the holy places in Iraq. 
The officials of the two countries intend to meet and settle 
the issue, he said. 
  On the priorities to be given to the second five-year 
development plan by the Majlis, he said the Majlis places 
emphasis on social justice, restructuring the adminstrative 
system, reducing reliance on oil revenues and reviving the 
pricing mechanism. 
  On the Saudi ban on holding the special ceremony of 
"antipathy towards atheists," he said despite the harassment 
done by the Saudis, the incident was unlikely to result in break 
off of diplomatic relations due to the two countries being 
neighbours and because of the interests of the world of Islam.

Kyrgyzstan, which have been signed by the two countries' 
ministers, are progressing step by step today. We are in favor 
of the expansion of economic and transport cooperation.

of mutual ties. Referring to the grounds for transit 
cooperation between the two countries, he called for the 
expansion of that cooperation. He also thanked Iran for 
transferring Kyrgyz pilgrims to Holy Mecca. 
  Mr. Velayati, too, stressed the importance of ties between 
Iran and Kyrgyzstan. He called for the implementation of the 
decisions made at the meeting of the Iranian and Kyrgyz

  [Excerpt] Tehran, May 24 (AFP)--Iran does not plan to 
improve ties with Egypt despite a visit planned by Foreign 
Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati to Cairo next week, a ministry 
spokesman said Tuesday. Iran and Egypt broke diplomatic ties 
after the 1979 Islamic revolution and maintain diplomatic 
contact at interest section level. 
  The spokesman, quoted on Tuesday by the radical daily 
JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI, said Velayati would only go to Cairo to take 
part in a meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), and the 
visit "has nothing to do with bilateral ties." 
  "Given the nature of the Egyptian government, Iran has no 
intention of boosting ties beyond the interest section level," 
he said, adding that Velayati "would not meet any Egyptian 
officials" during his visit. 
  It will be the first to Egypt by a senior Iranian official 
since the revolution. [passage omitted]

Erwin Arrieta, the Venezuelan energy and mines minister. At the 
meeting, the Venezuelan energy and mines minister described the 
role of Iran's history and civilization in the civilization of 
the world as very valuable. He said: The expansion of warm 
cooperation with Iran based on mutual interests is very 
important for us. The grounds for expanding bilateral 
cooperation are plentiful. He described one of the aims of his 
visit to Iran, besides assessing the oil issue in the oil-rich 
countries of Asia, as making use of Iran's valuable experience 
in the sphere of mines and metals. 
  According to the Central News Unit, Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani, 
for his part, spoke of the activation of the mining sector 
during the first five-year plan, especially relating to iron 
ore, coal, refractory materials, copper, and aluminum mines. He 
said: Side by side with the mining sector, and in light of the 
high cost of transporting raw materials, the growth of the 
metallurgy sector is of special importance. Iran is ready to 
provide Venezuela with its expertise and experience in the 
fields of oil, gas, mining, the petrochemical industry, and 
metallurgy.

  [Text] Ways and means of strengthening OPEC were assessed 
in today's meeting between Mr. Erwin Arrieta, Venezuelan energy 
and mines minister, and Mr. Gholam Reza Aqazadeh, oil minister 
of the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
  According to the Central News Unit, the need for greater 
cooperation among OPEC members, in order to further mutual 
economic interests, was stressed at the meeting. 
  Mr. Aqazadeh reiterated that Venezuela and five 
oil-producing 
countries of the Persian Gulf currently control two thirds of 
oil reserves and 70 percent of exports. Despite the existence 
of different points of view, they could take joint steps toward 
the strengthening of OPEC, he said. 
  The Venezuelan mines and energy minister, who met Kuwaiti 
oil 
officials before meeting the oil officials of our country, has 
said that, in order to achieve better prices, his country 
supports a reduction in oil production.

  [Text] Tehran, May 24, IRNA -- The visiting Venezuelan 
Minister of Energy and Mines Erwin Arrieta said here Monday that 
the only alternative to strengthen OPEC's position is to adhere 
to the basic principles of the organization and disengage it 
from political games. 
  Arrieta who made the remark in a meeting with Iranian 
Foreign 
Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati, stressed that increase in 
production quota and oil price hike should be carefully 
monitored, adding that this would be to the interest of both the 
producer and the consumer. 
  The Venezuelan minister who is also OPEC president voiced 
his 
country's readiness for the expansion of Tehran-Caracas ties and 
strengthening of cooperation in all fields. 
  Velayati in reply said that cooperation and exchange of 
views 
among OPEC member countries can play an important role in the 
restoration of the significant stance of the organization. 
  He stressed that OPEC member states should observe 
production 
quota and added that member countries should abide by the 
organization's decisions. 
  Velayati also called for the expansion of Tehran-Caracas 
cooperation at international level and for strengthening of 
bilateral economic ties. 
  Meanwhile, in a meeting with Iranian Minister of Mines and 
Metals Mohammad Hoseyn Mahluji, the Venezuelan minister said 
that his country is interested in using Iran's advanced 
technology in exploitation of mines. 
  The two sides called for implementation of the agreement 
already reached between the two countries and reviewed purchase 
by Iran of iron ore, alumina and ferromanganese from Venezuela. 
  Arrieta and Mahluji are representing their countries in 
Tehran- Caracas joint economic commission.

<F P=106> [First Friday prayers sermon by President 'Ali Akbar </F>
Hashemi-Rafsanjani in Tehran on 20 May -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] In the name of God, the compassionate, the 
merciful. [passage omitted] In the first sermon we will continue 
the discussion on social justice. [passage omitted] In last 
year's sermons I spoke about resources; but less was said about 
expenditures last year. So in the first sermon this year we 
spoke about it. I think I should list a few more in the next 
few sermons. In the last sermon I referred to subsidies as one 
of the areas of realizing justice in the distribution of the 
treasury and the government's financial resources. Briefly, 
what I meant was that there were unjust subsidies left from the 
distant past, that some injustices have been eradicated, and 
there are important areas left. I referred to fuel and bread 
and some other items [subsidies] which are still unfair. Of 
course, I explained then that since they are very important and 
have a great effect on life, one cannot take instantaneous 
decisions about them. It needs planning, and problems arising 
in conjunction with removing subsidies should be considered. 
Therefore, we will keep them until our plan is ready. 
  In the second five-year plan there are certain indications 
for this to happen in five years, but in our view even five 
years are not enough. It needs at least 10 years for us to 
remove the inequities which exist in fuel and bread consumption 
in the society. But then, some media rushed in and said that 
speech smelled of new price rises. It is not so. I stressed 
then that it will be done with planning. God willing, part of 
those plans are in the Majles and other parts will be prepared 
later. Our people should not worry about rash and quick 
measures in these sensitive times. We will act cautiously. I 
said then that some actions would arouse resentment against the 
government because they might put severe pressure on the people. 
Therefore, such tasks will be carried out with prudence.

  [Text] The Atomic Energy Regulatory Board, AERB, has 
ordered the suspension of all construction work of the inner 
container structures of the proposed nuclear reactors in 
Karnataka and Rajasthan. The AERB order was issued following 
preliminary analysis of the collapse of a large concrete portion 
of the inner container dome in the (Kaiga) unit-one project in 
Karnataka. The board has decided to review the construction 
procedure in use. The AERB chairman, Dr. A. Gopalakrishanan, 
has said that a high-level expert committee has been constituted 
to probe into the incident. He clarified that the (Kaiga) 
project is still under construction, and no nuclear fuel or 
heavy water has been transferred to the site. As such, there is 
no question of any radioactive release or radiological impact 
due to the incident, he added.

  [Text] New Delhi, May 25 (AFP) -- Indian authorities have 
halted the construction of two nuclear power projects after a 
suspected design flaw caused the collapse of a reactor dome at 
the Kaiga plant in the southern state of Karnataka. 
  A. Gopalakrishnan, chief of the Atomic Energy Regulatory 
Board, said in a statement Tuesday that work on the four nuclear 
reactors being built in Kaiga and Rawatbhata in the northern 
desert state of Rajasthan had been stopped. 
He said the move was related to the May 13 collapse of the 
concrete reactor dome in Kaiga which left 14 workers injured. 
Nearly 40 percent of the 130-tonne dome fell down. 
  A probe has been ordered into the incident, blamed on 
possible design and construction flaws. All four nuclear 
reactors on which work has stopped have the same design. 
  The dome's function is to prevent the escape of radiation in 
case of an accident. 
  Gopalakrishnan clarified that the Kaiga project was still 
under construction and no nuclear fuel or heavy water had been 
transferred to the plant. "Hence there is no question of any 
radioactivity release or radiological impact due to the 
incident," he said. But the temporary halt to construction 
would help authorities review the dome design and construction 
methods to correct any flaws, Gopalakrishnan said, adding 
similar dome failures had taken place in the United States. 
Findings of the probe ordered into the incident will be made 
available in two months. 
  India's seven existing nuclear power plants were closed for 
inspection in July 1993 after a fire broke out at the Narora 
station in northern India.

  [Text] New Delhi, May 23 (AFP) -- Jyoti Basu, chief 
minister of the Indian state of West Bengal, denied on Monday 
[24 May] press reports that North Korea had requested food aid 
during his recent visit to Pyongyang. Basu, a member of the 
politburo of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), said in a 
statement that the reports that North Korean officials had asked 
him to arrange emergency shipments of rice from India were 
"absolutely baseless." 
  "I had talks with several leaders of (North Korea), 
including 
the prime minister," said Basu, who visited North Korea from May 
7-14. "But no one made such a request to me. 
  "On the contrary, I was impressed by their economic 
development, construction work and their confidence to meet any 
situation," he said. "The news item is obviously intended to 
show (North Korea) in a bad light." 
  Basu, who heads India's sole communist state government, has 
been in power in West Bengal for 17 years.

  [Text] The prime minister has expressed satisfaction on 
his visit to the United States. Addressing a news conference in 
Washington D.C., Mr. Narasimha Rao said though essentially a 
goodwill mission, the visit has both political and economic 
content. His discussions with President Clinton had convinced 
him that India and the United States can develop bilateral 
relationship of maturity and strength. It can contribute not 
only to mutual good but also to the world as a whole. His 
current visit has helped towards developing better understanding 
between the two countries, Mr. Rao observed.

  [Text] The prime minister returned to New Delhi this 
morning on the completion of his week-long visit to the United 
States. Mr. Narasimha Rao was received at the airport by the 
home minister, Mr. S.B. Chavan; the civil aviation and tourism 
minister, Mr. Ghlam Nabi Azad; and the Harayana chief minister, 
Mr. Bhajan Lal, besides others. 
  As reported the prime minister's arrival in New Delhi was 
slightly delayed as Air India's special aircraft carrying him 
and his delegation developed a minor technical snag while 
landing at Paris for a scheduled halt. A standby aircraft 
already stationed at Charles de Gaulle Airport was used for the 
onward journey home. 
  India-American business leaders have proposed creating two 
new institutions on Wall Street in New York to chalk out 
programs for the modernization of Indian industry. Sponsored by 
the Greater Houston Partnership, the plan was presented to the 
finance minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, who accompanied the prime 
minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, on his just concluded U.S. visit. 
A press release issued by the group says the plan envisages 
creating mutual funds, venture capital funds and other debt and 
equity instruments to raise capital for India in the next 
decade. The release estimated a contribution of at least $100 
billion by the U.S. private industries for Indian markets in the 
next five years. It also said the Indian Americans have the 
capacity to fund $5 billion per year for the modernization of 
the country's industry. 
  The leader of the opposition in the Lok Sabha, Mr. Atal 
behari Vajpayee, has lauded the prime minister, Mr. Narasimha 
Rao, for not succumbing to U.S. pressure on the issues of 
Kashmir and the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Talking to 
newsmen in Lucknow, Mr. Vajpayee expressed satisfaction on the 
firm stand taken on these points.

and industry have welcomed India's economic reforms program and 
the strategy integrating its economy with the global economy. 
Dr. Singh said there is a lot of enthusiasm in the United 
States about India's prospects as a large and emerging market 
offering great opportunities for American investments.

  [Text] The 21-member Indian business delegation that 
accompanied the prime minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, on his visit 
to the United States has expressed satisfaction at the outcome 
of their visit. The delegation comprised representatives from 
the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the 
Confederation of Indian Industry, and ASSOCHAM [Associated 
Chamber of Commerce]. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Indian 
businessmen have termed their visit to the U.S. as highly 
successful. They feel that the meetings with the U.S. officials 
and businessmen has helped them to have a free and frank 
exchange of ideas that will give a major fillip to existing 
bilateral trade ties. American businessmen have shown special 
interest in investing in the energy, communications, banking, 
and financial sectors. Besides areas of infrastructure and 
consumer durables, a major attraction for the U.S. industry is 
the large untapped market of 200 million consumers and a growing 
industrial sector with an insatiable appetite for technology and 
infrastructure. India's highly skilled class of 
English-speaking professionals and scientists was another 
attraction for the U.S. investors. 
  [Unidentified business leader] The Confederation of Indian 
Industry signed a memoranda of understanding [MOU] with the 
National Association of Manufacturers of USA, and this MOU would 
now really formalize our relationship, which would address the 
subject of increasing business cooperation involving small and 
medium-size enterprises in U.S. because large multinational 
organizations are present here and are reasonably well informed, 
but the small and medium where there is a tremendous opportunity 
and this MOU would enable us to focus on that task. [sentence as

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Wisner Before the Event"] </F>
  [Text] The U.S. ambassador-designate to India Frank Wisner 
is likely to be an impediment to constructive bilateral 
dealings. The least that is required of a man holding this 
office is that he should seem to be free from any bias against 
the country to which he is assigned. Wisner has failed this 
test even before the U.S. Senate's approval of his appointment. 
At tbe Senate's confirmation hearing, his explanation of why, 
in his view India did not qualify for permanent membership of 
the Security Council has inevitably given rise to serious 
misgivings in this country. According to him India's inclusion 
would "undermine the cohesion" of tbe world body. This defies 
logic. Worse, Wisner's notion of how the Security Council 
functions seems to be cock-eyed. What precisely does he mean by 
"cohesion"? Surely, it could not be anything like a unanimity 
of opinion about issues before the world. This has never been 
the case. In fact the Council was always an arena for two rival 
camps. If they did not manage to break it up, the reason was 
the existence of the right of veto conferred on the five 
permanent members, the U.S., the USSR, UK, France and China. 
  The end of the cold war means that the Council is no longer 
divided into the old rival camps. Yet, sharp differences on 
crucial world issues will persist. Cohesion, as the term is 
commonly understood, is irrelevant here. It could make sense if 
India had suddenly landed on this planet from outer space. 
Since that is not so, how can its membership be deemed to 
threaten the Security Council's cohesion? Frank Wisner perhaps 
believes that economic or military power should be the sole 
qualification for entry into the Security Council. If so, he 
has forgotten that when China became its member it was perhaps 
less developed industrially than India. Its membership derived 
entirely from the fact that it was a prominent member of the 
wartime alliance against the German-Japanese combine. 
  A plausible explanation of Wisner's obvious faux pas in his 
reply to a point-blank question on suggestions of India's 
membership lies in his close association with the Pentagon, as 
Under-Secretary for Defence. And it is Pentagon more than any 
other wing of the U.S. administration which Pakistan has 
manipulated to its advantage over the past four decades. Wisner 
thus cannot but be fully and sympathetically alive to Pakistani 
concerns. Since these have turned into an incurable anti-Indian 
paranoia, it would be natural if the first thing that Wisner 
almost instinctively remembered while replying to the question 
about possible Indian entry into the Security Council was 
Pakistan's opposition to it. Short of making a direct reference 
to this, he only blurted out that thing about "cohesion". By 
this reckoning, Wisner would have been an ideal U.S. envoy in 
Islamabad.

  [Text] Two East Jerusalem papers today carry a decree by 
PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat which orders that the civilian and 
religious courts in the areas of the autonomy are to reinstate 
the laws that prevailed in the territories before June 1967. 
The PLO Executive Committee will announce the names of the 24 
members of the autonomy's Administrative Council tomorrow. Our 
Arab affairs correspondent Oren Kohen reports: 
  [Kohen] The decree cancels most of the military laws that 
pertain to civilian matters, and restores the situation to that 
which prevailed in the territories before the Israeli 
occupation. This was stated today by Attorney Furayh Abu-Middayn 
from Gaza in reaction to a decree PLO head Yasir 'Arafat 
published today. According to the decree, as of 20 May, the 
courts in the area of autonomy again follow the laws that 
existed there before June 1967. 'Arafat published the decree in 
East Jerusalem newspapers today. He calls on the civilian and 
religious courts to again function in the manner they did before 
June 1967. Egypt has not changed the laws that prevailed in 
Gaza since the days of the British mandate and Israel added 
military regulations to them. At the same time, the Jordanian 
law is still valid in Jericho. 
  The step 'Arafat has taken stands in contradiction to the 
agreements he signed with Israel, or at least this is the 
Foreign Ministry's view. The ministry claims that any change 
made in the laws in the autonomy areas require an a-priori 
Israeli agreement. 
  The legal situation in the territories is not yet 
sufficiently clear because Israel has not yet transferred the 
administrative powers to the council that 'Arafat was supposed 
to be name three weeks ago. The PLO Executive Council is slated 
to announce the final composition of the council tomorrow, 
assuming that 'Arafat's attempts to nominate them do not fail 
once again. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1500 GMT on 24 May 
adds: 
"Foreign Ministry Legal Adviser Yo'el Singer said today that if 
indeed 'Arafat announced the cancellation of the laws Israel had 
applied in the territories, it is a gross violation of the 
agreement Israel and the PLO signed. 'Arafat's declaration, 
Singer says, is tantamount to making the entire agreement null 
and void. The legal adviser told our correspondent Shlomo Raz 
that 'Arafat has no legislative authority in Gaza and Jericho. 
Only the Palestinian Authority has such powers, and it has not 
yet arrived and has not started operating; furthermore, this 
power as well is subject to an Israeli veto." A similar report 
by Shlomo Raz on Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1505 GMT on 
24 May adds that "'Arafat's decree is legally meaningless."]

  [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
chairman of the Presidential Council and supreme commander of 
the Armed Forces, has received a cable from the officers, NCO's, 
and soldiers of the (?al-Khurafi) camp, who used to be called 
the private guard of traitor 'Ali Salim al-Bid. The cable 
voices the congratulations of the officers, noncommissioned 
officers [NCO's], and soldiers to the brother leader president 
and supreme commander of the Armed Forces on the occasion of the 
blessed 'Id al-Adha and the fourth national anniversary of the 
Republic of Yemen and also expresses support for the forces of 
unity and legitimacy. 
  The cable condemns what was done by the gang of apostasy and 
secession in the Yemeni Socialist Party, led by traitor 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid, namely, the declaration of secession, stressing 
that it is considered high treason against the homeland, the 
unity, and the Yemeni people and that history will not forgive 
that gang's crimes against the people and the homeland. The 
officers, NCO's, and soldiers in the al-Khurafi camp expressed 
their great appreciation for the step the leadership has taken 
under brother LIt. Gen. 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih to preserve the 
homeland's unity and safeguard its gains, which were achieved 
for our people under the immortal Yemeni revolution. They also 
stressed their determination to defend unity under the Republic 
of Yemen.

  A statement issued by the Yemen Command of the Arab 
Socialist 
Ba'th Party says: Our people and all their good forces have 
always pinned and are still pinning their hopes on the unionist 
current in the YSP to do something for the sake of beloved Yemen 
in order to entrench the Yemeni unity, adhere to constitutional 
legitimacy, confront secession, and to issue a principled reply 
to what has been declared by certain leaders dominating the YSP, 
and what they have called the separation of the southern and 
eastern governorates from the Republic of Yemen. 
  The statement adds: Remaining silent over this is considered 
a historic crime. Our Yemeni people will never forgive those 
who are now standing idle and are just watching this crime.

<F P=106> [Report by Ibrahim Humaydi: "Damascus Wants To Reach </F>
Understanding on Everything with Israelis Before Signing Peace 
Agreement"] 
  [Excerpts] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher had 
hardly started to get ready to return to Washington at the end 
of his Middle East tour, which involved diplomatic efforts 
between Damascus and Tel Aviv, when Syria announced that the 
Israeli proposals conveyed by Christopher to President Hafiz 
al-Asad had not helped to achieve progress toward peace, because 
they did not contain a fundamental change in the Israeli 
position. And that the differences are still "wide" over the 
peaceful solution method. [passage omitted] 
  Christopher's visit has revealed that the axes of the 
Syrian-Israeli negotiations are: withdrawal, security, and 
relations. And that with regard to the first axis the 
negotiations focus on the depth of the withdrawal, its duration, 
and its stages. With regard to the second axis, the two sides 
discuss security arrangements, their locations, their 
technologies, and deployment of the two sides' armed forces. As 
for the third axis, it concerns measures to build trust and 
relations between the two sides after the full withdrawal from 
the Golan, and the linkage between relations and the withdrawal 
question and the coincidence between them. 
  While Israeli sources point to Syria's agreement to conduct 
a 
phased withdrawal over three years and to establish direct 
relations with Israel -- but Syria still has not agreed to the 
question of opening an Israeli embassy -- [Syrian] Vice 
President 'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam stresses the Syrians' rejection 
of a phased withdrawal, saying that Syria demands a "quick 
Israeli withdrawal from the Golan completed in a reasonable 
time," without Syrian officials' involvement in determining the 
period, leaving this to "the time Israeli forces need to conduct 
the logistic withdrawal process," otherwise the conflict between 
the two sides would remain, "and let it continue for 500 years" 
between Syria and Israel. 
  Well-informed sources told AL-HAYAH that Khaddam said 
"Israel 
did not occupy the Golan in stages. The Golan is 15 km wide 
(the front from north to south), so why phased withdrawal now." 
The sources, which attended Khaddam's meeting with a U.S. 
delegation during Christopher's presence in Damascus, said that 
Syria rejects a phased withdrawal. And that the vice president 
was not optimistic about achieving important progress in 
negotiations. "We cannot talk about optimism" as long as Israel 
is not committed to a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights to 
the 4 June 1967 borders. 
  This means Syria's rejection of any Israeli demand for 
"minor 
alterations" to the borders involving incomplete withdrawal. 
  As for the security question, a high-ranking Syrian official 
stressed to AL-HAYAH that [security arrangements] should be 
"equal" on both sides of the border. He also stressed Syria's 
refusal to make security arrangements on the Syrian side 
different from those on the Israeli side, especially as Syria 
believes that, if arrangements are not equal, they should be at 
the expense of the Israelis, who "are the occupying party and 
the aggressor." This is in addition to deploying international 
forces (U.S. and Russian), as President Boris Yeltsin announced 
his country's willingness to respond to this request in more 
than one message conveyed to President al-Asad. [passage 
omitted] 
  The sources told AL-HAYAH that Khaddam said: "Israel wants 
both land and peace, and the two conflict with one another. And 
no peace can be achieved without full withdrawal." The Syrian 
vice president believes that any agreement not based on justice 
and right "will not last long, and the principles of justice 
prompt that all the Golan Heights return to Syria." 
  Khaddam was asked: "Do you believe that we could see the 
picture of an Israeli family under the flag of an Israeli 
embassy in Damascus?" He replied: "When Israel withdraws fully 
from the Golan and Yitzhaq Rabin announces his willingness to 
withdraw, he will hear the answer." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cairo, 24 May (MENA) -- Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa 
has stressed that if Sudan continues to take measures against 
Egyptian interests in Khartoum, Egypt will not remain silent; it 
will reconsider its policy toward Sudan. 
  During a news conference he held today, the foreign minister 
said that despite allegations, which all have a weak and illegal 
basis, the Sudanese authorities' acts against Egyptian families 
on the day preceding 'Id al-Adha demonstrate the reckless 
attitude of the brothers in Sudan, not only in taking these 
measures but also in their timing and implementation. 
  Continuing, 'Amr Musa said: We disagree with the Sudanese 
measures and the way they were implemented. The Sudanese 
authorities chose the easiest but worst way to harass Egyptian 
families residing in Sudan. This runs counter to Islam and also 
lacks decency. The decisions, which were based on completely 
false premises, were meant to harm relations and halt any 
efforts to promote them, the foreign minister added. 
  At his news conference, the foreign minister said: I was 
preparing to visit Sudan, but the Sudanese authorities have 
decided to oppose Egypt's request to join the Preferential Trade 
Area [PTA] for Eastern African States. Egypt's application was 
opposed solely by Sudan, which threatens Egyptian interests and 
prevents the Egyptian people from enjoying economic cooperation 
with the East African states. When the Sudanese Government 
resorted to this stand, I decided to cancel the visit. 
  The foreign minister said that Sudan opposes Egyptian 
membership in the PTA even though Egypt has refused to take part 
in any international conference that might take a stand against 
Sudan or its interests. He said that this Egyptian position 
stems from Egypt's historical viewpoint favoring integration 
between Egypt and Sudan and fostering the brotherhood of the two 
peoples. Consequently, we cannot do anything against Sudan's 
interests. We have demonstrated this stand in the field of 
human rights and in the UN Security Council, UN General 
Assembly, the World Bank, and the IMF, 'Amr Musa added. 
  Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa suggested that there is 
a 
minority in Sudan trying to poison relations between Egypt and 
Sudan. However, Musa affirmed that Egypt will take steps only 
when it believes it will be necessary and useful. 
  During the news conference, the foreign minister said these 
Sudanese measures will have a negative impact on the relations 
between the two peoples. He reiterated Egypt's firm stand 
concerning the unity and territorial integrity of Sudan, even 
though the Sudanese Government's measures are meant to mar its 
relations with Egypt and other countries. The foreign minister 
pointed out that a minority in Sudan will not succeed in 
affecting the historic and deeply-rooted relations between the 
Sudanese and Egyptian peoples. 
  Regarding the situation in Yemen, the foreign minister 
described it as tragic and regrettable, stressing the interest 
in the issue of Egypt and President Husni Mubarak, as well as 
their keenness to find a solution to the problem there. He 
maintained that no Arab state would approve of the current 
situation in Yemen. We must candidly condemn the use of force 
between brothers, he said. Musa added that no one would have 
expected that Yemen, which was united four years ago, would end 
up in such a tragic political situation. 
  The foreign minister said that unity is a legitimate 
objective for all Arabs, and this also applies to the people of 
Yemen, both north and south. Musa added: We cannot but support 
the voices which call for unity. However, unity cannot be 
safeguarded by military action, the foreign minister said. 
  To a question about 'Ali Salim al-Bid's secession and 
decision to establish the Democratic Republic of Yemen, 'Amr 
Musa said: Let's wait for a while so that we can deal with the 
tragic situation and infighting between the Yemenis. He said no 
Arab state can take a mere observer stand regarding the 
situation in Yemen. He underlined the recent contacts by 
President Muhammad Husni Mubarak with the Yemeni president and a 
number of officials. 
  Foreign Minister Musa said the failure to reach a 
cease-fire shows the extent of the tragedy in Yemen. He added 
that the Arab world as a whole must handle the tragedy by 
halting the fighting, disengaging the armies, and seeking to 
reopen dialogue between the Yemenis in the north and south, 
because they are all Yemeni and are one nation. As for the 
continuing political situation, he noted it is up to the Yemeni 
people themselves. He emphasized that such a clash may generate 
a continuous conflict in most parts of Yemen. 
  Commenting on the Nonaligned Movement ministerial conference 
due to be held in Cairo on Tuesday, Musa said President Husni 
Mubarak will inaugurate this conference, in which 108 countries 
will take part, and that Egypt has so far received notice that 
85 ministers will attend. He added that the conference will 
discuss all pressing political issues, such as 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Somalia, and the effects of GATT [General 
Agreement on Trade and Tariffs]. 
  He pointed out that Serbia and Montenegro are not the 
natural 
inheritors of Yugoslavia and hence they cannot inherit 
nonaligned membership automatically. He stressed that 
Belgrade's military operations and military policy against 
Bosnia, Croatia, and other republics that used to comprise 
Yugoslavia are acts of aggression and violations of the UN 
Charter. 
  He said that given these violations, Belgrade cannot 
automatically participate in the Nonaligned Movement's meetings, 
noting that because of all this, Egypt did not send an 
invitation to Belgrade, a measure that was agreed upon with 
Indonesia, who currently chairs the movement. 
  Musa commented on the current crisis caused by Palestinian 
President Yasir 'Arafat's statements in South Africa about a 
jihad. He said president 'Arafat played a major role in leading 
the Palestinian action that recently led to the transitional 
agreement called Gaza-Jericho and it was 'Arafat who signed the 
joint statements in Oslo, Washington, and Cairo. He added: If 
we count on statements coming out of Israel and Palestine we 
will end up nowhere. 
  The foreign minister said: It is not right for us to 
hesitate because of a statement that might have been distorted 
or not quite understood. But what is certain, we feel, is that 
President 'Arafat is determined to implement the Declaration of 
Principles and the concluded agreement and to press ahead toward 
a peaceful settlement between the Palestinians and Israelis 
according to the principles of land for peace and rights for 
rights according to the Madrid formula. 
  He expressed his belief that we should not make any 
decisions 
based on any statement that we are not sure of as to form, 
content, and text, especially one that would harm rather than 
serve the peace process. He reiterated Egypt's readiness to 
advance the peace efforts in the right direction. 
  Musa expressed hopes for a settlement to the Libyan-Western 
crisis, a halt to the escalation of the situation, and a 
solution based on the need to respect international legitimacy 
and the Libyan people's right to respect for their sovereignty 
and rights. 
  The foreign minister said tensions between Iraq and Kuwait 
cannot be eased without an official Iraqi stand affirming that 
the Kuwait issue has ended and acknowledging that Kuwait is a 
sovereign Arab state. He explained that in the absence of this, 
there can be no talk about Arab relations and Iraq's return to 
the Arab fold.

  [Text] New Delhi, May 22 (AFP) -- India is ready to talk to 
Moslem militants to end the four-year-old separatist campaign in 
Kashmir, but Pakistan cannot be included in the negotiations, a 
federal minister said here on Sunday [23 May]. 
  Internal Security Minister Rajesh Pilot told the Press Trust 
of India (PTI) news agency that New Delhi had "an open mind on 
holding talks with anybody if it helps to bring back normalcy in 
Kashmir." 
  But Pilot rejected suggestions from a top Kashmiri militant 
leader, Yasin Malik, that New Delhi should start an 
unconditional dialogue with Kashmiris and Pakistan if it wanted 
peace in the northern state. 
  "The talks should be among ourselves," Pilot said, referring 
to India and to Moslem militants in Kashmir fighting for the 
secession of the state, the only one with a Moslem majority. 
Pilot ruled out the inclusion of "any third party." 
  It was the first Indian reaction to Saturday's offer by 
Malik 
of the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) that separatist 
unrest could end in Kashmir if India talked unconditionally to 
Kashmiris and Pakistan. 
  Indian newspapers on Sunday quoted Malik as saying in 
Srinagar, the summer capital of Kashmir, that his outlawed JKLF 
would announce a unilateral truce if New Delhi agreed to the 
negotiations. 
  Indian leaders have said the guerrillas must renounce 
violence before talks can start. But Malik, 30, freed on May 16 
after nearly four years in prison, said: "You cannot talk of 
peace and then make any move toward it conditional." 
  Malik, who returned to Kashmir two days after his release, 
said the JKLF, the premier Moslem guerrilla group, stood for the 
"total independence" of Kashmir, now divided between India and 
Pakistan. 
  "The Kashmir issue is not merely a territorial dispute 
between India and Pakistan," he declared. According to Indian 
newspapers he denied that the Kashmiri separatist campaign, in 
which nearly 10,000 have lost their lives, aimed to carve out an 
independent state exclusively for Moslems. 
  "We do not demand freedom for a particular community or a 
particular area. We strive for total independence of the 13 
million Kashmiris, irrespective of their caste, colour, race, 
region or faith. 
  "The independence of Kashmir means the independence of the 
85,000 square miles (136,000 square kilometers) that constitute 
our homeland," he said, making clear he meant both the 
two-thirds of the state within India and the rest held by 
Pakistan. 
  India and Pakistan have fought two of their three wars since 
1947 over Kashmir. New Delhi accuses Islamabad of arming the 
militant groups, which Pakistan denies. 
  All Moslem separatist groups except the JKLF want the 
Indian-held Kashmir to join Pakistan. 
  Other Moslem groups want to make Kashmir an Islamic state, 
and have forced thousands of Hindus who have lived in the 
Kashmir valley for generations to flee. Malik said he wanted the 
Hindus to return. 
  Malik, who helped launch the Kashmiri separatist campaign in 
1989, was arrested by Indian security forces in Srinagar in 
August 1990 and held in prison until last week.

<F P=106> [Interview with Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi by </F>
unidentified correspondent in Tripoli; date not given] 
  [Text] [AL-HAYAH] Your Excellency, Colonel, Mu'ammar 
al-Qadhdhafi, leader of the revolution, 25 years on from the 
revolution, do you believe you have succeeded, and in what area? 
  [Al-Qadhdhafi] That is a traditional question which is put 
to me every year. 
  [AL-HAYAH] No, the 25th anniversary of the revolution is 
different... 
  [Al-Qadhdhafi] No. The question was put to me on the 24th, 
20th, and 10th anniversaries. Of course, the event that 
occurred 25 years ago in Libya had been shaped and decided by us 
since 1959 on the basis of the philosophy for which the 
revolution was launched. The aim was to bring about a turning 
point in the history of mankind. And we are determined to bring 
about a new era like that of the French revolution, which 
initiated the era bourgeois republics. We decided that the 
al-Fatih [1 September] revolution would end the era of republics 
and launch the people's jamahiriyat [of masses]. From our 
serious analysis of history, we can expect results, proceeding 
from the available factors. This is why we announced that the 
era of the masses would begin, and nationalities would triumph, 
and that there would be a conflict among nationalities. And 
that the states comprised of several nationalities would break 
up. We expected that before the separation in Yugoslavia and 
the Soviet Union. And we still expect the collapse of the 
United States. The United States consists of a mosaic of 
conflicting pieces. It will not hold together in the era of the 
masses. The blacks will become independent, the Red Indians 
will become independent, the whites will become independent, and 
so will the other minorities. And a civil war could begin in 
the United States one day like in Lebanon if no American takes 
the initiative like Gorbachev to grant the peoples of the United 
States their independence, hence conducting the separation 
peacefully, as happened in the Soviet Union. 
  But to cling to the domination of Washington, the White 
House, the CIA, the National Security Council, and the major 
companies... all these are nightmares which will lead to a 
rebellion, and hence to bloody separation. That is, unless 
someone forestalls events, allowing these peoples to become 
independent, as happened in the Soviet Union. It is another 
prophecy which will come about in the future. We had said that 
the Soviet Union, which consisted of several nationalities, 
would collapse. There is now one state about which no one is 
talking, that is the United States. We say that the United 
States will break up peacefully or through war. I mean that the 
Libyan revolution is a revolution of a new prophecy and new 
vision for mankind which we cannot judge on the basis of what 
has happened in Libya. Its results will emerge in decades and 
centuries, and after generations. It will then be said that the 
al-Fatih revolution was the historic turning point. The early 
sign was the emergence of the revolution of originality, that is 
fundamentalism, which spread and was exploited and distorted, 
turning it into bullets and oppression... But at the beginning 
we launched this cry, namely that the south must advance toward 
the north, and that the fringes must advance toward the center, 
which should be destroyed. And that the oppressed should climb 
onto the stage. And that purity should begin from the desert. 
And that originality should be revived and whatever is alien 
abandoned. We announced the revolution of originality and 
fundamentalism. Analysts believe it was us who sparked off this 
revolution. The important factor for the Libyan revolution is 
laying the foundation for the era of the masses, that is, the 
establishment of people's power. There is now for the first 
time a state run without a government, without a president, 
without a king, and without a regular army. It is run through 
the people's committees and congresses. Whatever arrogant, 
ignorant, absurd, and spiteful people say to undermine that, it 
is an irrefutable fact, namely that Libya is the cornerstone of 
a new era called the era of the masses and the jamahiri system, 
represented in the people's congresses and the people's 
self-government. This is what Bakunin and Proudhon tried to 
achieve. Even before Marx there were philosophers like al-Razi 
and al-Mu'tazilah [group of Muslims applying logic] who dreamt 
of achieving what has just now been achieved. 
  [AL-HAYAH] What is preoccupying you most these days? 
  [Al-Qadhdhafi] At the national level, we are preoccupied 
with the current confrontation between a small country and a 
small people, that is, the Libyan people, and three major 
states, all of which are nuclear and Christian states. Libya is 
a Muslim state and they are imperialist states which have the 
right of veto (in the Security Council). And they have atomic 
bombs. Of course, we cannot ignore the fact that we are very 
busy with the confrontation with three oppressive, arrogant, 
insolent, and tyrannical states. 
  At the pan-Arab level, we are preoccupied with the fact that 
no one has torn down the raised slogan, that is, the Arabs' 
unconditional surrender. All that is happening, beginning with 
Madrid through Oslo, falls under this slogan, that is, the 
Arabs' unconditional surrender. Because in view of the Arab 
defeat, the Arab collapse, the tyranny of the Western states 
protecting the Israelis, and the nonexistence of the Soviet 
Union and the socialist camp, no negotiations will be in the 
Arabs' interests. In fact they will mean capitulation. It is 
their opportunity to impose capitulation on the Arabs. All that 
is being talked about -- like Gaza and Jericho, land for peace, 
and the Golan... all this falls under the slogan that the Arabs 
must surrender unconditionally and immediately so that the 
existing balances will not be upset thereby allowing the Arabs 
to raise their heads. 
  At the international level, we are preoccupied with that 
international arrogance and that insolence. Because the world 
has turned into a jungle. But we are certain that the small 
animals in the jungle will fight with their claws and teeth -- 
which means that the jungle will drown in blood because of what 
imperialism is doing. 
  [AL-HAYAH] So you are totally opposed to what the 
Palestinians have done so far? 
  [Al-Qadhdhafi] It is not like that. We are looking for a 
radical solution to the Palestinian issue. The only peaceful 
radical solution is the South African model. If they want to 
solve the Palestinian issue, let them follow the South African 
model -- which means the Palestinian people's return and free 
elections under UN supervision for both the Palestinians and the 
Jews, then a democratic Palestinian state would be established. 
Without that there is no solution. Proof of this is that the 
fighting is still continuing, because Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] 
does not represent all the Palestinians. What we hear on the 
news, namely that the PLO has signed an agreement with Israel is 
untrue. It is not the PLO; it is Fatah. Even in Fatah there is 
a big split. The agreement took place with the Fatah chairman 
and his group. They give him Gaza and Jericho, because they fit 
their measure. The agreement with the PLO will be on the scale 
of Palestine [as a whole]. 
  [AL-HAYAH] Did Abu-'Ammar not contact you? Did you not tell 
him your opinion openly? 
  [Al-Qadhdhafi] It is an ordinary relationship. He contacts 
us and sends messages to put us in the picture. But our 
position is clear. We support the Palestinian people's return 
and the recovery of their rights. We do not support the Gaza 
and Jericho accord. 
  [AL-HAYAH] What about Algeria? Is it not preoccupying you? 
  [Al-Qadhdhafi] Of course, regrettably, France is currently 
taking revenge against Algeria. France and the United States 
are behind all that is happening in Algeria. France is backed 
primarily by the United States and the Israelis. The Mosad, 
French intelligence, and the CIA are involved in the murder, 
financing, training, and armament operations, so that Algeria 
would pay the price for its independence and rebellion against 
France. That is what is happening in Algeria. 
  [AL-HAYAH] How can you help Algeria? 
  [Al-Qadhdhafi] By God, that is a worry.... If the aggression 
was foreign, the matter would have been clear. But as long as 
the Algerians are fighting one another inside the country, no 
one can do anything except offering advice and kind words. They 
[not further identified] are also trying to get Egypt to pay the 
price for its war against the Israelis, the 'Abd-al-Nasir era, 
the nationalization of the Suez Canal, and its leadership of the 
Arab nation. Egypt is paying the price for that, because the 
Americans, the West, and the Israelis consider Egypt the 
archenemy. The Israelis want to destroy Egypt. There is a 
truce between Egypt and Israel, not peace. They want to exploit 
this truce to destroy Egypt so that it will be under Israel's 
heel. 
  [AL-HAYAH] With regard to the Libyan issue and the 
blockade imposed on it, how do you view the possibility of 
finding a solution or a way out, and do you believe that is 
possible? 
  [Al-Qadhdhafi] If the issue is to do with Lockerbie, there 
are solutions proposed which are very feasible and which will 
save face for all the parties. But if the Western states have 
another objective, then the attempts are improper and we would 
be facing a state of colonialism and insolence. And thus we 
should prepare ourselves for a confrontation and a war which the 
enemy should lose or not win. If the issue is to do with 
Lockerbie, it can be resolved easily in accordance with the 
formulas being proposed. All international organizations and the 
world as a whole support Libya. The three states are isolated, 
exposed, and lack even a fig leaf to cover their nakedness 
before the world with regard to the Lockerbie issue and the 
Libyan position. If their objective is colonialist, then in 
this case we are facing a new colonialist attempt and we will 
fight. 
  [AL-HAYAH] With regard to the proposed solutions, is there 
anything new and practical? 
  [Al-Qadhdhafi] Of course, there is a proposal from the Arab 
League and from international jurists, namely that a Scottish 
court be sent to another country -- The Hague, for example. And 
that the two suspects be handed over to the Arab League and then 
to this court under agreed UN guarantees. This is the latest 
solution we have heard. It is not a Libyan solution or a Libyan 
proposal. It is a proposal made by international jurists, 
espoused by the Arab League, and supported by the world as a 
whole. 
  [AL-HAYAH] What is the fate of all the weapons in your 
possession? Can you look after and service them? You purchased 
large quantities of weapons.... 
  [Al-Qadhdhafi] It has become clear that we were not wrong 
when we purchased and stockpiled the weapons. Time has shown 
that Libya is a target for aggression. One day al-Sadat was 
against us, Bourguiba was against us, al-Numayri was against us, 
and Hissein Habre was against us. France and the United States 
fought alongside them in Chad and Egypt. And Niger's Kountche 
was against us, and U.S. fleets threatened us from the sea. And 
we were attacked in 1986 by the two biggest states in the world, 
that is the United States and Britain. Our children were killed 
while asleep in their homes. It has become clear that we were 
right when we purchased the weapons and that we were targeted by 
an oppressive and direct aggression, and that we were entitled 
to have weapons to defend ourselves. The biggest danger 
threatening us now is the Israelis' possession of atomic bombs 
and nuclear missiles with a 4,000-mile range aimed against 
Libya, North Africa, Sudan, and the other Arab states. It is a 
very serious matter. Israel has atomic weapons, and the United 
States and the West are refusing to talk to the Israelis about 
them or to deprive them of this weapon. While the United States 
continues to pursue Libya, Korea, Iran, and Pakistan. As for 
the Israelis, they are exempt from the pursuit, punishment, and 
questioning. They are above international law. They are above 
Chapter VII of the UN Charter. If the Security Council decides 
a punishment for Israel, the United States uses its right of 
veto. Actually we are faced with a very serious situation: An 
adversary state is exempt from punishment and from Chapter VII 
of the UN Charter, is above international law, and is entitled 
to own any weapon of mass destruction, and no one questions it 
about anything. They pursued us because of a pharmaceutical 
plant until they ascertained it was a pharmaceutical plant. Why 
do they not pursue the Israelis, who admit their possession of 
atomic bombs and who have not signed the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty? 
  [AL-HAYAH] You have helped numerous allies since the 
revolution erupted. Who is now with you, who has turned against 
you, and who has been able to help you during the blockade 
period? 
  [Al-Qadhdhafi] By God, all those we helped support us, each 
according to his ability. We helped numerous forces in the 
world. We helped people who are now presidents of republics and 
heads of state. The West used to say that these are terrorist 
camps. These terrorist camps have turned into heads of state 
and regular armies, like Museveni and Sam Nujoma in Namibia, or 
the presidents of Congo, Angola, and Mozambique... all of them 
had their camps in Libya. They [the West] used to call them 
terrorists. 
  [AL-HAYAH] Who has actually offered help since the blockade 
began? 
  [Al-Qadhdhafi] All peoples are sympathizing with us. But 
the international arrogance represented in the United States and 
the Western states is terrifying the world and the peoples. 
Nevertheless, the world as a whole is sympathizing with the 
Libyan people. 
  [AL-HAYAH] In Col. Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi's view, what is 
left of the Arab unity idea, especially in view of what is 
happening in Yemen? 
  [Al-Qadhdhafi] Indeed what is happening in Yemen is a 
sinister event and gives a bad impression. Regionalism has been 
consolidated until regional states have replaced nations. We 
now hear about the Kuwaiti nation, the Tunisian nation, and the 
Mauritanian nation.... It is amazing for regionalism to be 
perpetuated among Arabs to such an extent. What we aspire to 
now is an Arab unity that achieves an economic unity and defense 
unity, and let the petty states enjoy their regimes and systems: 
The kingdom as a kingdom, the sultanate as a sultanate, the 
emirate as an emirate, and the republic as a republic. But in 
the end there has to be a union for the Arab nation -- a union 
that achieves economic unity and defense unity. Even the nature 
of the age now does not prompt a move toward centralism, but, 
rather, toward localism and the grassroots. 
  [AL-HAYAH] So you still believe in unity? 
  [Al-Qadhdhafi] It is a necessity, not a triviality. Without 
it, there is no future for any Arab state. 
  [AL-HAYAH] What would you say to the Yemeni brothers? 
  [Al-Qadhdhafi] Frankly, as a revolutionary, I am against 
sick stability in the Arab homeland. To me, explosions are 
better in order to change the stagnant situation. The Arab land 
is plundered and should become hot so that it will not be 
plundered again. As a revolutionary, I am against sick 
stability, futile stability. Instability is better than having 
an Arab state that is subservient to the West and Israel. 
However, as a revolutionary, I am not concerned over what is 
happening in Yemen.... This is from a revolutionary angle. But 
politically, the battle must be settled quickly in favor of 
Yemen's unity and without further bloodshed. 
  [AL-HAYAH] Are you in touch with officials there? 
  [Al-Qadhdhafi] We are in constant contact with them. With 
regard to 'Ali Salim al-Bid, he always contacts me, appealing 
that it is better that Yemen should not drown in war and blood. 
As for the brothers in the north, they say that the only 
solution is Aden's surrender in the name of Yemen's unity. They 
proceed from the premise that there is one state which has a 
president and a capital. I believe that what is happening in 
Yemen now is an internal affair, as there is no longer two 
states. It is an internal issue. 
  [AL-HAYAH] Which view do you support more? 
  [Al-Qadhdhafi] Unity and the revolution, of course. 
  [AL-HAYAH] A final question regarding those describing 
themselves as oppositionists abroad: What would you say to them? 
  [Al-Qadhdhafi] I say that with the establishment of 
people's power, there is no room for opposition. Oppose whom? 
The Libyan people? So you are opposing your people and 
homeland. In that case, the person becomes a stray dog. That 
person is a stray dog when he opposes his people and his 
homeland. If there is a rational person who really has a 
political opinion, and his opinion is successful, he has the 
opportunity to join the people's congresses and to include his 
opinion on the people's congresses' agenda. If the congresses 
are convinced of this opinion, they will implement it. If they 
do not, they will discard it. If there is really a person who 
is useful for the homeland, the people's congresses are his 
opportunity. If there is a ruling party, he could say that he 
has no opportunity because the party is not giving the 
opportunity to apply his ideas. The same applies if there was a 
ruler ruling the country. But since the people are ruling 
through the people's congresses and the people's committees, it 
is his opportunity to join the people's congresses. I believe 
that it is not possible for anyone of them to oppose, because 
the people are the ruler. There is no possibility of opposition 
at all. If there are Libyans abroad, they are miserable. Most 
of them are businessmen. A large number of them returned, 
carrying catalogs and business contacts from which we have 
benefited. They enter and leave the country after they realized 
that matters are different. They laughed at the conditions they 
had been in. Even people who used to attack us over the radio 
came and laughed at their previous conditions, admitting they 
had been miserable and their statements were unreasonable. They 
told us: Forgive us, and indeed we did when they entered the 
country... Anyone who wants to return can return, and anyone who 
repents is forgiven. God accepts repentance, so shouldn't human 
beings do the same. Anyone who repents enters the country 
safely. As for anyone who does not repent, his only option is 
to become an agent for foreign intelligence, and this is what 
has happened. One escaped after stealing the people's money and 
another escaped to avoid military service and national 
service.... These cases do not represent opposition. Opposition 
takes place when there is colonialism in the country, when there 
is dictatorship or exploitation.... This is opposition. But 
when the people have the power, foreigners expelled, and the 
homeland and the people are free, what do you call those who 
escaped? Miserable. They are informers for U.S. intelligence. 
They say things against their own people and their own 
homeland, like hit Libya, boycott Libyan oil, or attack Libya. 
What does this incitement mean? It means that intelligence 
services tell them: say this. So they say it. They do not even 
merit a question being put about them.

  [Text] Iraq's senior diplomat in Washington has been 
expelled for alleged violations of the agreement that allowed 
Iraq to maintain a diplomatic presence in the United States. 
THE WASHINGTON POST said that the diplomat had tried to lobby 
members of Congress and sent out news releases calling for an 
end to the United Nations economic embargo against his country. 
It said that he had also hired and fired staff without 
notifying the State Department or actions counter to the 
agreement. The paper said that the State Department did not 
announce his expulsion, but confirmed it when queried.

  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. 
Dear listeners, honorable citizens: Our unified Kurdistan 
Democratic Party [KDP] urges a quick normalization of the 
situation in the city of Irbil and all over Irbil Governorate as 
a basic step toward detente. Decisions in this regard were made 
with the participation of the Iraqi Kurdistan Front [IKF] and 
the political bureaus of both parties and under the sponsor of 
the unified Iraqi National Congress [INC]: 
  1. On 14 May 1994, it was agreed that both side's troops be 
removed from the roofs of houses and buildings inside Irbil, 
including the buildings of the parliament and the ministries. 
  2. It was agreed that forces be withdrawn from inside Irbil 
on 23 May. 
  3. At a meeting held in the operation room at the INC's 
headquarters on 22 May, conferees stressed the need to implement 
the previous agreements by starting withdrawal of both sides' 
forces from Irbil. 
  4. But the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK] is still 
procrastinating and has not carried out any part of the 
agreements. On the contrary, it continues to deploy its forces 
in other areas of Irbil and is still concentrating its forces in 
areas near Irbil like (?Banislau). The fighters of the PUK are 
still in control of the buildings of the parliament, the 
ministries, and the Council of Ministers that are adjacent to 
the parliament building. Thus, the Irbil residents are 
continuing to appeal to both sides to withdraw their forces to 
keep the fire of fighting away from the city. 
  O citizens, this stalemate poses danger to Irbil's security, 
particularly since the presence of such a large number of 
fighters leads to regrettable daily clashes. We in the KDP add 
our voices to those of the honorable residents of Irbil and call 
for the implementation of agreements by totally withdrawing from 
the city of Irbil and from all over Irbil Governorate as a basic 
step in this stage. We have announced our readiness to withdraw 
our forces from the Shaqlawah axis. However, the PUK is still 
regrettably procrastinating. 
  Once again, we place the Irbil residents before these 
realities, and we assert that the interests of both sides 
require withdrawal from Irbil [words indistinct]. The brothers 
in the PUK sometimes raise objections to what they call 
violations in other areas of Kurdistan. Whatever these 
objections may be, they do not absolve us all from the duty of 
preserving the city of Irbil's security and its residents' 
safety, particularly since international organizations and UN 
personnel are present in the capital. 
  The Irbil masses have demanded in several ways steps to keep 
the fire of fighting away from inside the city and to stop 
fighting everywhere, just as the IKF, the INC, and our people's 
friends have demanded. We in the KDP call warmly and honestly 
for responding to the popular calls from Irbil, from all over 
Kurdistan, from national and social figures, from ulemas, from 
various popular sectors, and from the Iraqi and Kurdistan 
national forces and parties and for quickly putting an end to 
this deteriorating situation inside Irbil. 
  In addition to this, the domination of the city by the two 
sides' forces has paralyzed the parliament and the Kurdistan 
Region's Government. It is well known that the fighters of the 
PUK have not yet withdrawn from the buildings of the parliament 
and the ministries. They have also erected barricades and 
checkpoints in the streets leading to the buildings of the 
parliament and the Council of Ministers. 
  We beseech Almighty God to help us. God supports honest 
people. God's peace, mercy, and blesses be upon you.

  [Text] Baghdad, 25 May (INA) -- AL-JUMHURIYAH has said that 
now the Thatcher-Bush fabrication of the capacitors charge 
against Iraq has been exposed, the West's democracy, respect for 
human rights, and credibility have come into question. 
  In its editorial today, the paper stresses that the British 
courts' unveiling of the British and U.S. intelligence services' 
fabrication of the capacitors' story -- or nuclear weapons' 
detonators -- with the prior knowledge of the then U.S. 
President and British prime minister, has proved beyond all 
doubt that Bush and Thatcher wanted to mislead public opinion in 
the West, especially in the United States, and fabricate 
justifications to convince legislative and other bodies of the 
need to launch a war against Iraq. 
  Describing such behavior as a reflection of moral 
degeneration, the paper notes that Bush and Thatcher were 
involved in lies at the highest levels and on the broadest and 
most important fronts. 
  It is noteworthy that a British court yesterday ordered the 
release of two British Urmak [name as transliterated] Company 
employees, who are serving five-year prison terms, after the 
court acquired categorical proof that Thatcher had prior 
knowledge of the plot and that British and U.S. agencies 
cooperated to frame the employees, Dagger and Speakman [names as 
transliterated]. 
  The British court has acquired convincing evidence that the 
judge who presided over the trial of the two British employees 
deliberately misled the jury into convicting the defendants of 
being involved in smuggling nuclear detonators to Iraq. 
  AL-JUMHURIYAH examines the underlying significance of the 
facts and information that have become available to the British 
courts about the British and U.S. intelligence and customs 
authorities' arrangement of the plan to deliver the detonators 
to the airport and then discover them as export-banned equipment 
that was on its way to Iraq. The paper says that the aim was to 
portray Iraq as being effectively on the verge of producing 
atomic bombs, and that the capacitors were the final step in 
that plan. 
  The paper is confident that with the charge of attempting to 
smuggle nuclear detonators to Iraq now exposed, the UN 
inspection committees' conclusion that there is no move to 
produce an Iraqi nuclear bomb, as well as facts that are yet to 
be disclosed, it has been proved that the aggression against 
Iraq was a basic part of the colonialist West's strategy of 
hindering the awakening and progress of any Arab country and 
preventing unity between Arab countries. 
  AL-JUMHURIYAH urges the U.S. and western public in general 
to 
stress their respect for democracy and human rights and to adopt 
clear stands against those who deceived and misled them in order 
to peddle the plan of killing hundreds of thousands of human 
beings and torturing millions more in Iraq.

  [Text] Israeli-Palestinian negotiations on agricultural 
trade arrangements between Israel and the autonomy have begun at 
Tel Aviv's Carlton Hotel. 
  Israel's delegation is headed by Agriculture Ministry 
Director General Yehonatan Bashi, and the Palestinian delegation 
is led by Khalid al-Qidrah, a PLO leader in the Gaza Strip, who 
recently arrived from Tunis. The talks are aimed at working out 
procedures for agricultural trade between Israel and the 
autonomy and measures to make ascertain the quality of the 
agricultural produce entering Israel. There is special concern 
about the use of pesticides and the health of the animals in the 
autonomy. Our correspondent notes that even before the talks 
started it was decided that mutual agricultural trade will take 
place only if the standards used in Israel are upheld in the 
autonomy. Our correspondent recalls that under the autonomy 
agreement, the borders will be opened to free passage of 
agricultural produce, except for five sectors, in which 
temporary quotas have been introduced. These are: tomatoes, 
potatoes, cucumbers, eggs, and spring chickens. There is no 
doubt that hoof-and-mouth disease, which has recently been 
uncovered in Jericho, and ways to prevent it from spreading, 
will undoubtedly come up in the talks.

administering the self-rule in Gaza and Jericho in Tunis this 
evening. 
  Palestinian sources said that more than ten members of the 
group participated in the unofficial meeting, and that the other 
18 members concerned would arrive tomorrow in Tunis to take part 
in the first official meeting of the group during which they 
were expected to be sworn in and prepare the group's working 
program for the forthcoming period. 
  Palestinian sources had previously announced that tomorrow's 
meeting would also be distinguished by announcing the names of 
the remaining members of the self-rule administration group; the 
Cairo agreement on implementing self-rule stipulated that it 
would comprise 24 members.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat by </F>
Jean-Marc Varaut in Tunis; date not given: "Toward a State 
Based on the Rule of Law"] 
  [Text] A modest cottage in the outskirts of Tunis. A 
number of easy-going Tunisian soldiers and suspicious-looking 
Palestinian bodyguards were scrutinizing the visitors, who, 
during the night, had been summoned from their hotel, where they 
had been waiting for the indefinite hour of the interview 
granted by the chairman of the Palestinian National Council. 
This is the name of the new authority ruling over the Gaza and 
Jericho autonomous territories. With my friend Bernard Regnier, 
we waited for a long time for the "Open sesame!" to be announced 
by one of 'Arafat's faithful companions. It was no longer the 
liberation movement leader who received me, and who, last 
October when we first met displayed a Lorraine cross which he is 
said to have worn for the past 27 years, but Palestine's new 
president. 
<H5>  French Model </H5>
  Although his black eyes were circled with red, betraying the 
fatigue felt by this indomitable man, 'Arafat laughed willingly. 
He laughed when I quoted Max Weber: "A state is recognized 
when it has the monopoly of legitimate violence." If we add 
autonomy (that is to say, etimologically speaking, the power to 
decree its own laws), a territory over which a single authority 
now rules, and international recognition (by 127 countries, as 
'Arafat himself pointed out), we have all the constituent 
elements that go to make a sovereign state. However, his answer 
was a cautious one: "I am now the president of an independent 
country, but only after a number of years will this state have 
all the attributes of its sovereignty, as well as a 
fully-fledged role in the United Nations Organization." 
  Yet, the signs of sovereignty are unmistakable: There is a 
Parliament, which will be renewed in October, following 
democratic elections based on electoral constituencies, 
including both Palestinians in the liberated territories and 
Palestinians abroad, who are still not authorised to come back; 
a government is in the process of being formed, and will include 
three Christian ministers; Yasir 'Arafat showed me the "decree" 
which he had just signed by which a Supreme Court had been 
created: "The judges are already on site in Gaza, Jericho, and 
the West Bank." He stressed the fact that the judges, once 
appointed, are independent and irremovable. The division of 
powers is ratified by the founding chart, which he ordered be 
brought to him, framed and illuminated with the Palestinian 
flag's colors. 
  On three specific issues which Palestine must now address -- 
the Constitution, human rights, and Islam's place within the 
state -- he gave firm, clear-cut answers. To begin with, he 
confirmed that the Palestinian constitution will be of the 
presidential type, inspired by the French model. Yasir 'Arafat 
handed me the draft provisional Constitution for the interim 
period, drawn up in Arabic, as yet unpublished, and which is to 
be submitted to the Palestinian Parliament as soon as the latter 
is constituted. He also confirmed Palestine's unreserved 
adherence to UN ideals, the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights, and the 1966 agreements on civil and political rights as 
well as economic, social, and cultural rights: "There will be no 
discrimination between Muslims and non-Muslims, or between men 
and women, who will have equal rights... Palestine is the 
fatherland of all Palestinians of all comunnities." 
  He reminded me that the 1988 declaration of independence was 
already based, in his view, on the principles of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, and that the National Palestinan 
Council considers human rights a source of inspiration for 
future legislation: "The ideals of justice, solidarity, 
consultation, and accountability of those who govern, which form 
part of the Arab cultural identity, are not contrary to the 
Western ethos on which the 1948 Declaration is based." 
Switching to French, 'Arafat repeatedly stressed that he would 
like to see the spirit of tolerance prevail over the revanchist 
spirit. 
  "There is a time to convince, and a time to build." This is 
why he broached the question of using French, which he wishes to 
promote as opposed to the dominant practice of speaking English, 
which was the language of the [British] mandate. He indicated 
that President Mitterand gave him assurances that the Sorbonne, 
where Yasir 'Arafat's wife was a brilliant student in her youth, 
will sponsor a Palestinian Humanities and Sciences university. 
Furthermore, he warmly gave me his agreement to arrange for 
French law professors and the Paris bar to contribute to the 
development of the Palestinian judicial institutions and 
legislation. 
  Unified Legal System 
  I reminded him of the role of French jurists in drawing up 
Turkish, Lebanese, Syrian, and Egyptian legislation. With Nabil 
Sha'th [adviser to 'Arafat], we discussed the pervasive 
Anglo-Saxon influence on Israeli and Palestinian criminal law, 
and the current opposition between the legal systems based on 
the Napoleonic codes and those based on British Common Law. 
  During the interim period, Jordanian law will be 
provisionally applied at the West Bank, and Egyptian law in the 
Gaza Strip, but Yasir 'Arafat is in favor of rapidly unifying 
the legal system. The aim is to rationalize Islamic law and to 
assimilate Western law without grating on Palestine's sense of 
identity or childishly imitating existing models. 
  Fortunately, Yasir 'Arafat is not liable to the temptation 
to 
resolve political and economic problems through a surfeit of 
legislation. He confirmed that Palestine had opted for the free 
market and that it had rejected state-socialism and its 
paralysing and stifling bureaucracy. 
  We ended our long conversation by my asking him about 
Islam's 
place in the new state. I reminded him that, out of 19 Arab 
states that have a constitution, 13 adopted Islam as a state 
religion (in Saudi Arabia, moreover, it is the sole religion), 
whereas five states do not establish any formal link between the 
state and Islam (Lebanon, Somalia, Djibuti, Libya, and Syria). 
On this point he referred me to the decision to be reached by 
the Palestinian National Council. However, he ruled out that 
the new state would be an Islamic state. Religious freedom and 
the right to practice any religion are affirmed by Article 3 of 
the provisional Constitution, as is the right to set up private 
schools within all the different communities. Christian 
Palestinians, who constitute an important minority, will enjoy 
the same rights as Muslim Palestinians. Thus the new political 
establishment, which professes to be democratic, liberal, and 
pluralistic, will be nondenominational. 
  Nevertheless, two of the draft Constitution's articles 
contain the germs of potential discord with Israel, just as they 
may, conversely, lead to agreement. Indeed, Article 5 states 
that Jerusalem is Palestine's capital, even though during the 
transitional period the Palestinian Government's seat can be 
located anywhere else in the Palestinian territory. The 13 
September 1993 agreements, in fact, have left unaddressed the 
question of Jerusalem's status. However, Article 31 suggests a 
rapprochement: "Jerusalem is a holy city for all three 
religions. Palestine, faithful to the spiritual tradition, will 
ensure the cohabitation of the different religions both in 
Jerusalem and in Palestine as a whole."

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Samir Ghawshah, member of the PLO </F>
Executive Committee and the Palestinian National Authority, in 
Tunis, by Fawzi al-Jundi, in Cairo; date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Al-Jundi] Dr. Ghawshah, the Palestinian Authority's 
meeting yesterday no doubt focused on its new tasks. What are 
these new tasks in light of the available resources? 
  [Ghawshah] During the meeting we discussed our working 
program and the tasks we must undertake. The Palestinian 
National Authority is taking over after 27 years of Israeli 
occupation. We have major tasks and responsibilities. Our 
discussions are serious and responsible because they deal with 
all the political, economic, social, and cultural issues. It 
was therefore necessary to hold an initial discussion of the 
National Authority's tasks and program ahead. 
  [Al-Jundi] Dr. Ghawshah, doubtless the new Palestinian 
authority faces many obstacles, notably the economic conditions 
in Gaza and Jericho. What efforts is the PLO making in this 
regard? 
  [Ghawshah] The main obstacle has to do with the Israeli 
occupation, both with regard to eliminating its aftereffects in 
the areas from which the Israelis have withdrawn and fully 
implementing the Declaration of Principles. A major economic 
problem we are facing now resulted from the Israeli occupation's 
policy of annexing and merging the Palestinian economy with 
Israel's, disrupting and ruining the economy and in some cases 
leading to a total loss of the infrastructure necessary for 
economic activity. 
  [Al-Jundi] Dr. Ghawshah, according to World Bank sources the 
Palestinian autonomous areas will obtain $1 billion over the 
next three years, part of an overall $2-billion package to be 
distributed in three stages. How can these economic resources 
best be utilized to encourage development in the Palestinian 
autonomous areas? 
  [Ghawshah] I would like first to say that the Palestinians 
have made all the administrative and organizational preparations 
to build a sound economy in line with international 
specifications and conditions. Despite the promises of aid, no 
aid or loans have been received. We hope this will happen soon, 
especially as our people inside the occupied territories are 
suffering from the effects of occupation. Because of the 
sieges, particularly the siege of Gaza, our people badly need to 
begin economic development and reconstruction. This will ease 
our people's economic difficulties. We hope the World Bank and 
the donor countries' promises and commitments will be kept. 
  [Al-Jundi] Dr. Ghawshah, let us move a little from the 
economic side of the Palestinian Authority to the security side 
and the situation in Gaza and Jericho. The Israeli Foreign 
Ministry issued a statement protesting Palestinian president 
Yasir 'Arafat's abrogation of the law applied in Gaza and 
Jericho since 1967 and his reinstating earlier laws. Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres said the Palestinians should be given the 
opportunity to adjust in the self- rule areas. How do you see 
things now? 
  [Ghawshah] I would like first to say something about 
security. Our people, in what were the occupied areas, including 
those opposed to the self-rule agreement, welcomed the 
Palestinian police and security forces with open arms. Another 
thing: It is the right of the Palestinian National Authority to 
make decisions as it sees fit to consolidate its role and 
provide our people with services. 
  The decision by brother Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] on 
reinstating earlier laws is an interim measure pending the 
passage of new laws by the Palestinian Authority. Naturally, 
following the withdrawal of Israeli forces, the military orders 
of these forces could not remain in effect in Gaza and Jericho. 
  If any issues merited objection, such issues should be 
clarified by returning to the Declaration of Principles. The 
Declaration of Principles specifies the Palestinian authority's 
powers and notes its right to pass laws and legislation. If 
Israel has any objection, it can raise it procedurally instead 
of disputing the power of the Palestinian Authority to pass laws 
and legislation. 
  [Al-Jundi] Thank you. 
  [Ghawshah] You're welcome.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Ala' al-Mashharawi from Gaza] </F>
  [Text] Over 30 officers and soldiers of the Palestine 
Liberation Army [PLA] began a hunger strike in the Canada Camp, 
located within the borders of the Egyptian town of Rafah, 
yesterday to protest the Israeli authorities' decision to ban 
them from crossing into the Gaza Strip. 
  First Lieutenant Husayn Abu-Sulaymah, an official at the 
Khan 
Yunus post and who managed to enter the Gaza Strip 10 days ago, 
said that the Israeli military authorities have prevented them 
from entering on the pretext that their names contain errors and 
discrepancies, although his brother is one of them. 
  It is worth noting that the families of the officers and 
soldiers can only send greetings and regards to them across the 
barbed wire dividing the city of Rafah. The relatives of the 
officers and soldiers complained to the National Authority 
officials and the Palestinian security men about this step. The 
officials have pledged to solve this problem as soon as possible. 
  The officers and soldiers addressed an appeal to the PLO 
leadership to help them cross the Egyptian-Palestinian borders 
and reach the homeland.

<F P=106> [Report by Sa'id 'Ayyad in Jericho, QUDS PRESS] </F>
  [Text] Jibril al-Rajjub, who has been appointed by PLO 
Chairman Yasir 'Arafat as the official in charge of preventive 
security in the West Bank, has said that if the settlers try to 
break the law, we will confront them and deal with them harshly. 
He noted that their presence is illegal and described them as a 
"time bomb." He said that if they break the law we will not 
throw roses or rice at them. 
  Al-Rajjub, who returned to the occupied territories from 
Tunis on 17 May, said that the agreement that the PLO and Israel 
signed is "unfair." He said that the Palestinian party is 
committed to keeping law and order regarding the settlers and 
others. He said: We pledge to all Palestinian political forces 
to respect their right to express their stances freely and in a 
democratic and civilized way. He noted that every political 
force has the right to call for strikes, stage demonstrations, 
hold seminars, protest to the authorities, and express their 
views as they deem fit. However, he vowed that the Palestinian 
authorities will be firm and not allow any political faction to 
take the law into its hand and impose a strike by force. 
  Regarding the pro-Israeli collaborators, al-Rajjub, who 
holds 
the rank of a colonel in the Palestinian security organ, said 
that they constitute a very serious factor. He said that this 
problem will be handled on a case-by-case basis and in 
accordance with the degree of the crime committed by these 
collaborators. However, he stressed that from now on the 
Palestinian authorities will not allow any collaborator to think 
he is above the law or to carry arms on the streets. He called 
on individuals who collaborated with Israel to reconsider their 
past so that the new authorities will be able to determine their 
future. 
  Al-Rajjub emphasized that the Palestinian security organ 
will 
establish close cooperation with the Arab security agencies and 
emphasized that there will be no direct or indirect cooperation 
with the Israeli security agencies.

<F P=106> [Report by AL-BALAD PRESS and 'Abd-al-Jabbar al-Barghuthi] </F>
  [Text] Gaza -- Lawyer Furayh Abu-Middayn, member of the 
Palestinian Authority in the Gaza Strip, said that the storm 
raised by Israel regarding President 'Arafat's statement in 
Johannesburg, in which he compared the Palestinian-Israeli 
agreement to the Peace of al-Hudaybiyyah, is just a tempest in a 
teacup designed to block the way to negotiations about the final 
stage. He added that he firmly believes that the Meretz 
Movement and its ministers are no less extreme than Rabin. They 
are all gripped by ideological rather than security fears. He 
said that at this time the Israeli Government wants to distort 
the image of the National Authority in Gaza and Jericho around 
the world and to portray it as being unable to shoulder its 
responsibilities in order to block the possibility of spreading 
Palestinian self-rule to the other parts of the West Bank. 
  He expressed surprise at Israel's claims that the 
Palestinian 
security forces are unable to control the situation in the Gaza 
Strip. This is despite the Israeli Government's knowledge that 
the donor states have so far not fulfilled their promises to 
equip the Palestinian police forces. For example, the 
Palestinian security forces have no radio equipment. They also 
have no suitable logistical means. The military vehicles they 
are using now are large and old and unsuitable for the task. 
  Abu-Middayn asked: How could any police force in the world 
carry out its duties successfully without such necessary 
equipment? He noted that the Israeli Army with all its might 
could not prevent operations against Israeli targets for the 
past 27 years, whereas now the Israelis are demanding that the 
Palestinian security forces control the situation in the 
self-rule areas within a few days. 
  He said that if the purpose is to show that the Palestinians 
have failed the test and to involve them in a civil war, we say 
clearly that intra-Palestinian fighting is prohibited, and the 
Palestinians will frustrate the hopes of those who are wagering 
on such war. 
  Regarding the National Authority's efforts to collect the 
weapons in the Gaza Strip, Abu-Middayn said that there are about 
20,000 weapons, 80 percent of which are in the possession 
regular citizens. These must be collected. Those who wish to 
keep their weapons must get a license from the appropriate 
Palestinian authority. Regarding the remaining 20 percent of 
weapons, they are in the possession of factions, and we must 
discuss the issue with them in order to maintain purity of arms. 
  He added that in its bid to collect the weapons, the 
authority will not raid houses and search them. It will ban 
people from carrying weapons in the streets and public places. 
  Abu-Middayn expressed the view that the Rabin 
Administration's refusal to evacuate the settlements in the Gaza 
Strip will perpetuate the friction, complicating matters on the 
scene and prompting some people to hold on to their weapons for 
self-defense against attacks by the settlers. 
  He said: Despite limited resources, we have started building 
legislative and judicial systems, and we will prove to the world 
that we can establish an independent Palestinian state.

  [Text] In a funeral procession last night, Palestinian 
policemen carried on their shoulders the body of Jihad 'Asfur, 
an Islamic Jihad activist who was killed by IDF [Israel Defense 
Forces] soldiers' fire on 22 May. 'Asfur's funeral was held in 
Khan Yunus, and he was buried in a quasi-military ceremony. His 
body was driven to the cemetery on a Palestinian police jeep. 
Some 30 policemen attended the funeral, and with them were 10 
members of the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam squads, the Hamas [Islamic 
Resistance Movement] military arm, who were armed with M-16 
rifles. Thousands of Hamas supporters came to the funeral. 
Four Palestinian policemen carried 'Asfur's body to the grave. 
According to eye witnesses, one of the policeman even kissed 
the body before it was buried. The policemen and the Hamas 
activists fired their guns in the air to salute 'Asfur, as is 
customary in military funerals. 
  As will be recalled, the Fatah leaders declared that the 
Palestinian policemen intend to disarm Hamas activists and other 
armed Palestinians. 'Asfur was killed on 22 May when IDF 
soldiers fired antitank missiles at a house on the outskirts of 
Hebron.

  [Text] Brothers: Our national newspapers have published a 
report that al-Quds Palestinian Arab radio in Arabic on the path 
of liberating land and man is jamming the enemy radio's Arabic 
broadcasts. To clarify matters, the Technical Division of 
al-Quds Radio wishes to explain the following: 
  1. General Rabin used to jam al-Quds Radio. He has 
designated several radio stations to jam most of our operating 
waves. Our masses in the homeland and the diaspora have been 
aware of this fact since the beginning of our transmission. 
  2. To face the enemy's jamming of al-Quds Radio, we are 
obliged to change our frequencies from time to time, 
particularly those on the medium waves. 
  3. Whenever the enemy increases its jamming of al-Quds 
Radio, especially during signing ceremonies of treacherous and 
humiliating agreements, to prevent our voice from reaching our 
people's masses, we change our main medium wave and choose a 
frequency that is close to that of the enemy's radio so that 
jamming will also affect the enemy's radio. 
  4. Edmond Sehayek, head of the Zionist enemy Radio's Arabic 
Department, is the first to know about the jamming his equipment 
is carrying out against al-Quds Radio, the Palestinian Arab 
Radio on the path of liberating land and man. 
  Edmond Sehayek, head of the Zionist enemy Radio's Arabic 
Department, whose radio usually changes facts, uses equipment to 
jam our radio, contrary to his published allegations. At the 
same time, he keeps silent over Rabin's decision to continue 
jamming of al-Quds Radio because he knows that al-Quds Radio is 
the radio of the Palestinian masses in the homeland and the 
diaspora and the radio of those who have no voice and who fear 
that its voice will reach people. Therefore Sehayek jams our 
operating frequencies. 
  [Signed] The Technical Division of al-Quds Radio

Demands that 'Arafat Reaffirm Commitment to Cairo Accord in 
Writing"] 
  [Excerpt] Gaza, Tunis -- A Palestinian official told 
AL-HAYAH yesterday that the agreement on the implementation of 
self-rule signed officially in Cairo by President Yasir 'Arafat 
"does not need to be signed again." He was responding to 
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's demand that 'Arafat 
reaffirm in writing his commitment to the accord, otherwise the 
negotiations with the PLO would be suspended. 
  Hasan 'Asfur, who has been director general of the 
department 
following up negotiations with the Israelis since his return to 
the Gaza Strip last week, has said that "commitment to the 
accord was announced before the entire world, not in a closed 
room. The Israeli Government, the PLO, and the cosponsors of 
the peace process all have a copy of the text." 
  'Asfur, who participated in the Cairo negotiations and in 
drafting the Gaza-Jericho agreement, said that "despite the 
difficulties that emerge from time to time, the agreement to 
continue the negotiations is binding on the Israelis, just as it 
is binding on the Palestinians." He went on: "There are no 
preconditions in the agreement. It might help Rabin to read its 
clauses." 
  'Asfur said that the second part of the negotiations 
concerning the early transfer of powers in the West Bank could 
begin in June. He added that Palestinian President 'Arafat's 
presence in the self-rule areas is essential before these 
negotiations begin. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Russian envoy Viktor Posuvalyuk today met with a 
Palestinian delegation led by Nayif Hawatimah, secretary general 
of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP]. 
  During the meeting, they discussed the Palestinian situation 
and the successive developments in the wake of the signing of 
the Cairo agreement. The Russian envoy indicated the importance 
of the terms of reference for negotiations on the 
Palestinian-Israeli track, based on international legitimacy and 
its resolutions, in a way that secures the Palestinian people's 
right to establish an independent state and guarantee a just 
solution to the refugee issue. 
  For his part, Hawatimah said the Cairo agreement fragmented 
the Arab negotiation front and opened the way for separate and 
partial solutions that cannot achieve comprehensive peace and 
stability in the region. He indicated this agreement carries 
the elements of its own failure. 
  Hawatimah demanded the activation of the Russian role in the 
region in order to achieve the interests of the Arab and Russian 
peoples and bring about real peace.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Difficulties That Must Be Overcome"] </F>
  [Text] Observers currently agree that just as they 
expected a few weeks ago, the process of transferring power to 
the Palestinian National Authority will not be easy, 
particularly in light of the bad economic conditions prevailing 
in the occupied territories. 
  The process as a whole is considered an extremely important 
historical turning point. The Palestinian people are aware of 
their duty to ensure the success of this process, because the 
cost of failure, God forbid, would be extremely tragic. 
  The Palestinians' task at present is to establish the organs 
and cadres of the Palestinian Authority, on the one hand, and to 
keep the wheels of government turning, on the other, in order to 
provide the necessary services to the citizens and create jobs 
for tens of thousands of unemployed workers. This demands the 
establishment of industrial and agricultural projects in the 
areas of the transitional authority to absorb these workers as 
soon as possible. 
  There is no doubt that ensuring security and peace is 
considered one of the main challenges and difficult tests facing 
the Palestinians. In view of these difficulties and obstacles, 
the Palestinians must make greater efforts and sacrifices to 
overcome them. The states that have pledged to provide economic 
aid to the Palestinians are called upon to fulfill their 
commitments. Numerous dangers are threatening peace. Time is 
definitely one of the factor endangering the peace process and 
Palestinian aspirations.

<F P=106> [Article by 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Rashid: "Abu-'Ammar's </F>
Jihad!!"] 
  [Excerpts] Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin is very 
angry because Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat has declared 
jihad against the Israelis from South Africa. We wish to 
reassure him here that 'Arafat's jihad call will not achieve for 
him more than he can achieve at the negotiating table. 
Abu-'Ammar ['Arafat] did not achieve much when he was calling 
for jihad just a few miles away from Palestine, let alone doing 
that from Johannesburg at the far end of Africa. [passage 
omitted] 
  In the view of the majority, jihad is no longer jihad 
because 
most battles are between brothers, for personal vendettas, or 
foreign battles fought on Islamic territory. With the weakening 
of the leadership and its credibility, the word jihad has become 
weaker. Rabin, therefore, should rest assured that Abu-'Ammar's 
call will not move the people of South Africa, just as it did 
not move others. 
  The real jihad was that of the unarmed people who risked 
their lives to target the head of an Israeli soldier with their 
stones. What came before was just military operations by regular 
armies. 
  Even the other organizations which declare jihad in the name 
of Islam, have two problems. The first is that, like 
Abu-'Ammar, they make the call from distant places like Tehran, 
and the second is that they declare jihad as a part of the same 
organization which brings them together with communist groups at 
the same table. They cannot carry out their jihad from a place 
a thousand miles away nor can they call what they are doing 
jihad when they seek the assistance of communists.

  [Text] Cairo, 25 May (MENA)--President Husni Mubarak has 
stated that Egypt is undertaking a leading role in the Middle 
East in view of its good relations with all the parties. In 
this regard it is playing an important role in the peace process 
to achieve stability and prosperity in the region. 
  President Mubarak was speaking during a meeting he held 
today 
with a delegation of the American Association of Chief Editors 
of Newspapers and Magazines, which includes 14 chief editors and 
publishers from various parts of the United States. 
  Muhammad 'Abd-al-Mun'im, head of the Presidential Press 
Office, stated that President Mubarak described U.S.-Egyptian 
relations as good. 
  President Mubarak said the peace agreement between the 
Palestinians and the Israelis was just a start and that Egypt is 
doing its utmost to achieve stability in this part of the world. 
  President Mubarak stressed that peace has become a 
necessity. 
After it is achieved, numerous marginal problems could be 
solved. He explained that Egypt's firm goal is to establish 
peace and security in the region, offering prosperity to 
everyone. 
  Asked about Egyptian-Iranian relations, President Mubarak 
said that since coming to power, he has wanted to maintain good 
relations with every country. But the Iranians have policies of 
their own. 
  President Mubarak reaffirmed that terrorism has no future in 
Egypt and Egypt embraces many Arab institutions and acts 
according to the law and Constitution. We abide by the law, he 
said. 
  He noted: We could have ended terrorism within a few days 
had we resorted to emergency measures. But we abide by the law. 
We are encouraged that all the popular factions are against 
terrorism and do not sympathize with it. Citizens' reports on 
the terrorists and their activities were a primary factor in 
uncovering and arresting them. 
  'Abd-al-Mun'im said that President Mubarak emphasized that 
religions are a very sensitive issue, adding that the 
establishment of religious parties must be avoided and noting 
that the extremists do not seek democracy. Ultimately they want 
to establish their own style of dictatorship, he said. 
  President Mubarak explained that he is not against anyone 
but 
always works for stability and security. 
  Regarding U.S. aid, President Mubarak said: We know the aid 
will not continue forever. We need this aid for a few more 
years until peace is established throughout the area. We use 
most of this aid to strengthen the Armed Forces. He noted that 
many security problems exist in the area. 
  The president also dealt with the population issue. He 
affirmed that the birth rate has recently dropped and noted that 
he has drawn attention to this problem because it constitutes a 
real threat to the state. He also noted that the popular 
response has been positive. 
  In response to a question on tourism, President Mubarak 
said that the number of tourists dropped after the Gulf war and 
increased after the acts of violence by terrorists. [sentence as 
received] He noted that there is now a noticeable improvement 
as everyone realizes that the wave of violence, which is 
supported by certain foreign countries, has ebbed. He stressed 
that Egypt is firm on dealing with terrorism within the 
framework of legitimacy and law. He pointed out that efforts of 
those who are trying to threaten Egypt are to no avail. He 
discussed the domestic situation since he assumed power and 
reviewed the great projects in the fields of infrastructure, 
transport, energy, housing, schools, factories, and new cities. 
  'Abd-al-Mun'im said that in his meeting with the U.S. press 
delegation, President Mubarak touched on investment in Egypt and 
explained the removal of numerous obstacles, the last of which 
was exempting investors from routine measures, which will cost 
the government 10 million pounds. He noted that these steps 
have greatly encouraged investment and that three months after 
making this decision, 180 projects were begun in Suhaj and other 
areas in Upper Egypt. 
  In discussing the water problem and its scarcity on regional 
and international levels, President Mubarak stressed that if 
peace does not prevail, frictions and conflicts may flare up 
because of water scarcity. He noted that Egypt is using its 
water resources in the best possible way.

  [Text] Khartoum, 25 May (MENA)--Dr. Hasan Jad al-Haqq, 
Egypt's ambassador in Khartoum, this evening held a celebration 
on the occasion of Africa Day during which he delivered 
President Muhammad Husni Mubarak's speech in his capacity as 
chairman of the OAU, in the presence of over 500 guests, 
including ambassadors and ranking accredited African and Arab 
figures in Khartoum. 
  The Sudanese Government's representative was noticeably 
absent from the celebration, despite the fact that the Sudanese 
Government was sent an invitation by the head of the African 
diplomatic corps. 
  Ugandan Ambassador to Sudan E. Obitre Gama, doyen of the 
African diplomatic corps in Khartoum, delivered a speech in 
which he condemned the measures taken by the Sudanese 
authorities against the Egyptian interests in Khartoum, such as 
the Egyptian Club, where the celebration was supposed to have 
been held. Because of this, the celebration was moved to the 
home of the Egyptian ambassador in Khartoum. 
  Ambassador Gama thanked Egypt and its ambassador for hosting 
this celebration and not cancelling it. This gave many Africans 
an opportunity to celebrate their day. 
  During the celebration, the Egyptian ambassador received 
notification from the head of the Egyptian Irrigation Department 
in Sudan that this evening the Sudanese authorities took control 
of another house of the Egyptian Irrigation Department in 
Khartoum, the resident of which is currently on annual leave in 
Cairo. This report drew condemnations from the sons of the 
African communities in Sudan who were attending the celebration. 
  Thus, the number of houses that have been occupied has risen 
to 14, in addition to the Egyptian Defense Office's three rest 
houses. 
  In a statement to the MENA correspondent in Khartoum, Dr. 
Hasan Jad-al-Haqq affirmed at the end of the celebration that no 
matter what happened, today's celebration of Africa Day was not 
going to be cancelled. He affirmed that he considers the 
residence of the Egyptian ambassador in Khartoum to be the home 
for all Africans in Sudan.

  [Text] Khartoum, 25 May (MENA) -- Sudanese security 
authorities tonight seized the residential quarters of the 
Egyptian Community School teachers along with the administrative 
headquarters of the Egyptian education mission in Khartoum. The 
Sudanese authorities expelled the teachers from their quarters 
and assembled them in one location. 
  It is not clear how many facilities the Sudanese authorities 
seized. The move is part of a campaign launched recently by the 
Sudanese authorities to confiscate Egyptian facilities in Sudan. 
Earlier tonight, the same authorities confiscated a house 
belonging to the Egyptian Irrigation Ministry.

  [Text] Cairo, 25 May (MENA) -- Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, 
the former Yemeni prime minister who was recently appointed 
prime minister of the South after it declared secession, arrived 
in Cairo tonight on a visit to Egypt as part of a tour of Arab 
countries. 
  In an arrival statement al-'Attas said he hoped to meet 
President Husni Mubarak tomorrow, Thursday. He said: I wish to 
take this opportunity to express my deep thanks to Egypt and its 
president for all the efforts to remove Yemen from this crisis. 
  He said that Egypt always plays a pioneering role in our 
Arab 
homeland and noted that during his visit to Cairo he will 
discuss the situation in Yemen, the war there, and the 
importance of stopping it as soon as possible. 
  Al-'Attas added that these topics will be discussed with 
Egyptian officials. He said he believed that they are fully 
informed of all the events in Yemen. He noted that various 
countries' recognition of the South of Yemen will be the topic 
of discussion during his talks.

  [Excerpt] Cairo, 25 May (MENA) -- The impact of the ongoing 
battles between North and South Yemen has reached the Yemeni 
Embassy in Cairo. Yemeni Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim 
Basindwah issued a decree relieving Yemen's Ambassador in Cairo 
'Abd-al-Jalil Ghilan, a southerner, of his post and recalling 
him to Sanaa, appointing Ambassador 'Abd-al-Malik Sa'id, a 
northerner, in his place. 
  Ghilan closed the embassy's electronic doors this morning, 
prevented staff from entering to assume their duties, and took 
refuge in his residence on the upper floor of the embassy 
building. The employees assembled in front of the building, 
causing a traffic jam on Amin al-Rafi'i Street in the al-Misahah 
area of al-Dukki. A police force imposed tight security around 
the embassy. 
  A security source has stated that the goal of these security 
measures is to protect the embassy against storming operations 
or riots. 
  Muhammad Fayid, a diplomatic attache at the embassy, told 
MENA that work was supposed to be resumed in the embassy this 
morning according to official instructions, which granted 
employees a four-day holiday for 'Id al-Adha. But he was 
surprised to find the embassy closed. 
  Fayid said he learned that former Ambassador 'Abd-al-Jalil 
Ghilan, who, as he put it, was recalled by President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih, grabbed the embassy keys from the inside guard 
and threw him out. Hence, he added, the embassy staff and 
diplomats were unable to enter to perform their duties and 
render services to the members of the Yemeni community in Egypt 
or to the Egyptians. 
  Fayid commended the Egyptian efforts to resolve the Yemeni 
crisis and President Mubarak's appeal for a cease-fire. He said 
that Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih responded to that 
appeal and accepted a cease-fire. But the southern leaders' 
decision to break away led the situation to explode, he said. 
He denied a separation of North and South Yemen, describing 
events as "a mutiny" by a group of renegades and affirming that 
the entire Yemeni people support unity. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cairo, 25 May (MENA) -- The 26 May issue of 
AL-MUSAWWAR reveals the true causes of death of lawyer 
'Abd-al-Harith Muhammad Madani, a member of the banned Muslim 
Brotherhood group. 
  Chief Editor Makram Muhammad Ahmad published a copy of the 
medical report on Madani's death. The report said: An 
examination of the body of 'Abd-al-Harith Muhammad Madani has 
revealed that he died of an acute collapse [hubut had] of the 
respiratory system and a failure of his lung capacity resulting 
from acute asthma. No traces of injuries or visible fractures 
or bruises were found on the body. 
  Dr. Suhayr 'Abd-al-Fattah, who conducted the examination of 
the deceased lawyer's body, stressed to Makram Muhammad Ahmad in 
a telephone interview that her signature on the medical report 
reflects the true reasons and accounts leading to Madani's 
death. She expressed concern about seeing her statement 
published for fear that she "may be a target of the terrorist 
groups," as she told AL-MUSAWWAR's chief editor. She added: I 
have a father whose medical condition cannot tolerate the state 
of anxiety he is going through out of concern for my life. 
  In his editorial, Ahmad says that after being arrested in 
his 
office in al-Haram neighborhood, Madani was being taken to his 
home in the Warraq al-'Arab district of al-Jizah to be searched 
when he experienced acute difficulty in breathing with 
convulsions and then fainted. The accompanying officer radioed 
his superiors to inform them of the situation. Their answer 
was: There is no need to go to Warraq al-'Arab. Take him 
immediately to al-Manyal Hospital for treatment. If necessary, 
put him in the detainees' ward for treatment. 
  Ahmad emphasized that the internists made tremendous efforts 
to save Madani's life, but he took his last breath at 1400 on 27 
April; that is, 24 hours after being admitted to the hospital.

  [Text] Cairo, 25 May (MENA) -- New facts have surfaced 
regarding the death of Egyptian lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani on 
25 April and his role in the outlawed terrorist organization, 
the Islamic Group, in Isna, Qina Governorate. This led to his 
arrest. He then suffered an asthma attack, and after 24 hours 
at the al-Manyal Hospital the doctors failed to save his life. 
  AL-AHRAM Chief Editor Ibrahim Nafi' has published a full 
report on the true circumstances surrounding the death of the 
lawyer, who was in charge of financing the terrorist 
organization. The report also includes what occurred at the 
Lawyers Association with members of the Muslim Brotherhood, 
which controls that association. Nafi' notes that the story 
began when security men captured terrorist elements after 
several successive and highly planned operations to strike at 
the dens of terrorism. Some important organizational documents 
were seized along with these terrorists, who gave detailed 
confessions. Several facts, obtained from full confessions, 
surfaced in connection with these cases, particularly State 
Security Case 235/94, which is related to the so-called military 
wing of the Islamic Group and to the terrorist acts committed by 
members of this group. Nafi' added that the confessions 
revealed the following: 
  1. 'Abd-al-Harith Madani acted as the direct link to Tal'at 
Muhammad Yasin Hammam, the organization's leader who died on 25 
April in a shoot out with security men sent to capture him. 
  2. Upon instructions from the organization's leader, Madani 
acted as a liaison officer, conveying the orders of the 
organization's leaders outside prison to leaders inside prison. 
  3. Madani was in charge of financing the organization by 
distributing money received from abroad for Tal'at Hammam, the 
leader of the organization. According to the defendants' 
confessions, Madani received seven payments from Hammam 
amounting to 45,000 Egyptian pounds as well as $3,000, which he 
spent on the organization's activities on the instructions of 
its leader. 
  Nafi' adds: Those were the actual facts that emerged from 
the confessions made by the recently captured terrorist 
elements. Had some of the leaders of instigation been fair, 
they would have reflected on these facts as they really are 
without any bias. What is certain from the investigations is 
that Madani was a terrorist affiliated with the Islamic Group in 
Isna, Qina Governorate. He had been previously charged in 
several cases, including Case 7 in the year 1990, when he, along 
with other members of the organization, prevented people from 
visiting graveyards, claiming it was sinful to do so. He was 
also charged in another case in Isna for distributing leaflets. 
  Nafi' adds: Here we have a prominent member of a terrorist 
organization that kills and assassinates innocent citizens, in 
violation of law and public order. Here is a member of an 
organization that permits the killing of people and the 
plundering of their property, in violation of the provisions and 
ethics of religion. What is more serious is that he used his 
job as an attorney defending law, freedom, and stability as a 
cover to undermine the law and shake the stability. 
  Observers point out that the events that took place at the 
Lawyers Association last week, which had been instigated by the 
banned Muslim Brotherhood, reveal extremely serious matters, 
including: 
  1. Some of the people who have led the acts of instigation 
and agitation belong to a dissolved political group that seeks 
to use the death of the aforementioned lawyer and its leadership 
of the association as an opportunity to promote its political 
goals, which run counter to the regime and to legitimacy, and to 
gain popularity among lawyers so that they may back its 
candidates in future elections. 
  2. The deceased lawyer was a member of a terrorist 
organization, the Islamic Group, who had been charged before in 
several cases. The attempt to take advantage of his death 
reveals the relationship between the dissolved group and other 
terrorist groups. 
  3. These outlawed terrorist groups are trying to use the 
professional associations as an arena for their unlawful 
partisan activity. 
  4. Other extremist and irresponsible elements have attempted 
to incite lawyers to carry arms against the legitimacy and its 
representatives. 
  5. The special relation between members of the terrorist 
groups and the outlawed and dissolved Muslim Brotherhood group 
has been confirmed by a statement issued by one of the groups 
that falsely calls itself Islamic, in which it incited strikes, 
demonstrations, and sabotage. 
  Nafi' says that this trend is serious and dangerous. It 
tries to exploit and undermine democracy and to cause a relapse 
in the splendid democratic development process which is 
relentlessly and wisely led by President Mubarak. 
  Nafi' maintains that the security commands in Egypt are 
committed to safeguarding legitimacy, law, and the basis of 
democracy which have been established by the president. These 
commands have accomplished tremendous achievements by all 
standards. They penetrated the secrecy of these organizations 
through scientific planning and through proficiency and the 
ability to move quickly. 
  He adds that security commands managed to descend on some 
terrorist leaders and seize a map detailing the locations, 
duties, and responsibilities of various terrorist elements as 
well as their codes and planning for future operations. It was 
a huge blow to the organization which made the terrorists and 
their sympathizers go out of their minds. 
  Nafi' says that 'Abd-al-Harith Madani and others were among 
the many elements who were captured through justice. They 
thought for a while that they could exploit one of the most 
honorable and ancient professions -- the practice of law -- as 
their slogan behind which they hide under false pretenses. 
  Some elements of the dissolved group are trying to play with 
fire, destabilize the situation, and go against legitimacy in an 
attempt to deprive the country of the atmosphere of development, 
stability, and democratic process. 
  In his capacity as the doyen of the Egyptian Journalists 
Association, Ibrahim Nafi' underlined the role of associations 
in defending the rights of its members as follows: 
  Any association is entitled, or rather duty bound, to defend 
the legitimate rights of its members. The association must 
support the member who is confronted with ordeals and crises. 
It is also a legitimate right to defend every member who is not 
under suspicion. This stance is part of the association law and 
is the member's rights and duties. It is also a right dictated 
by law and tradition, let alone if the case is linked to the 
application of the Bar Association and if the members are men of 
law and the protectors of the law. 
  On the other hand, there is an important fact that should 
not 
be ignored, namely that association members must not use their 
membership as a screen to hide illegal actions that violate the 
provisions of law and undermine the country's law and national 
security. Nobody can claim that membership can be used as 
immunity to violate the law or defend the violating member. 
  Nafi' says: I can understand that it is the right of the 
association to ascertain the authenticity of charges against the 
accused member, especially if the defendant is a member of an 
organization that is overtly practicing terrorism, killing 
innocent people, and carrying out assassinations and declaring 
this in its statements. I also can understand that it is the 
right of the association, particularly the Bar Association, to 
use all legal methods to defend the rights of its members and 
their families. 
  Ibrahim Nafi' adds: But what I can not understand and even 
reject is the adoption of illegal and illegitimate moves on the 
pretext of defending the right of an association member. This, 
I believe, would turn the association into a jungle and make the 
association membership a tool to support violation of law and 
infringement on legitimacy. This action is carried out by some 
elements which belong to illegitimate groups seeking to impose 
their hegemony and objectives by force and to foment trouble 
within and outside the association. 
  Nafi' voices his regret that some people have exploited the 
death of a terrorist organization member, who belonged to a 
vocational association, to instigate and incite trouble by 
issuing inflammatory statements against the law and the 
legitimate rule. 
  Nafi' concludes his article by saying that all aim to 
exploit 
the democratic climate, political tolerance, and the broad 
freedoms of expression. President Mubarak is committed to this 
democratic atmosphere regardless of the excessive and 
provocative acts by those who are trying to exploit legitimacy 
and the tolerance of the political leadership to sow discord and 
to drive a wedge.

  [Excerpt] One of the parties to the Sudanese conflict, the 
Sudanese Peoples' Liberation Movement/Sudanese Peoples' 
Liberation Army [SPLM/SPLA], today claimed that the suspended 
Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development peace 
talks on the Sudan were a waste of time and accused other 
parties attending the talks of not having faith in the peace 
negotiations. At a press conference in Nairobi this afternoon, 
the deputy leader of the SPLM/SPLA delegation to the talks, 
Yusuf Makki, said the Sudanese Government representatives 
declined to discuss any cease-fire arrangements during the 
week-long consultations. The faction also announced the 
establishment of new administrative organs to be headed by 
SPLM/SPLA leaders to manage the affairs of a section of the 
Sudan, which they referred to as new Sudan. The faction said 
the new Sudan, comprising five regions in southern Sudan, may in 
future secede from the Sudan. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] London, AL-HAYAH -- A group of military members 
of the "Sudanese Army Military Command" organization, the 
military arm of the opposition Democratic National Grouping, has 
announced the dismissal of its leadership and the formation of a 
new leadership, "because the present leadership has not carried 
out any military action against the regime over the past five 
years -- which has caused it to lose a great deal and prompted 
many people to abandon it." 
  A statement issued by the group and distributed in Cairo 
yesterday, a copy of which AL-HAYAH has received, said that the 
leadership of retired Lieutenant General Fathi Ahmad 'Ali, the 
Army's former commander in chief, "has not moved from the 
theorization stage to the implementation stage -- which has 
adversely affected its performance, reputation, and status 
inside and outside the country. In fact it has focused 
primarily on political action and ignored its main duty, thus 
losing its credibility and status in opposition action." 
[passage omitted] 
  The officers decided to "dismiss Lt. Gen. Fathi and Major 
General al-Hadi Bushra (the third man in the organization) and 
to form a new leadership committee after consulting with the 
organization's offices in Europe and Britain." The breakaway 
group stressed that it "has nothing to do with any agreements, 
decisions, or statements issued by the leadership. And we 
stress our commitment to the principles and charter of the 
Democratic National Grouping" [passage omitted]

  [Text] Khartoum, 21 May (MENA) -- Former Sudanese Prime 
Minister al-Sadiq al-Mahdi has criticized the present political 
practices in Sudan, calling for democratic elections to let the 
Sudanese people decide who will govern them. 
  In his 'Id al-Adha sermon at the al-Ansar Mosque in 
(?Udinbawi), Omdurman, today al-Mahdi said that the situation in 
Sudan is the worst it has ever been, noting that he will take 
serious action to restore democracy in the country. 
  Al-Mahdi pointed out that the government-appointed 
parliament 
does not fit into this category because it is appointed by the 
authority that is supposed to be accountable to it. 
  He criticized the government's economic policies, 
particularly the profit-sharing system, which he described as 
the most repulsive crime ever against the Sudanese economy. 
  The former prime minister criticized the government's 
management of alms and its establishment of the Alms Department, 
saying that most of the money is being spent on the employees of 
that department.

  [Excerpts] Khartoum, 23 May (SUNA) -- Director of the 
political department at the Foreign Ministry Dr. Anwar al-Hadi 
has categorically refuted the Egyptian allegations on seizure of 
a number of establishments affiliated to the Egyptian 
authorities. 
  Dr. al-Hadi explained in a press statement to SUNA that 
ownership of all the said establishments went to Sudan 
Government when the country became independent from the 
condominium rule. He underlined that some houses had been 
rented to Egyptians in accordance with lease contracts which had 
nothing to do with any other agreement, adding that terms of 
these contracts expired, therefore the owner of these houses and 
buildings -- state of Khartoum -- noticed the tenants to 
evacuate them in compliance with the legal procedure. 
  Dr. al-Hadi said it is sorrowful that the Egyptian 
authorities escalated the issue of evacuating the rented 
establishments to the standard of affecting the bilateral 
relations between Sudan and Egypt. [passage omitted] 
  He also said that failure of the Egyptian minister to fulfil 
his promise of visiting Sudan on the dates he fixed proved lack 
of the Egyptian Government's credibility toward purification of 
climate. He pointed out that contrary to their pretentions, the 
Egyptian authorities proved to be not serious for the unity of 
the Sudanese territories when they continued allowing the 
outlaws movement to operate from Cairo and providing it with 
moral support. [passage omitted] 
  Dr. al-Hadi added that the spirit of the Egyptian 
authorities 
in dealing with Sudan was reflecting its internal crisis.

  [Excerpt] Khartoum, 25 May (SUNA) -- The Foreign Ministry 
yesterday summoned the Egyptian ambassador to Khartoum to convey 
the ministry's protest over two statements issued by the 
Egyptian Foreign Ministry on legal action taken by the relevant 
Sudanese authorities against various establishments housing 
Egyptian nationals in Khartoum. This move was consistent with 
Sudan's tenancy and leasing laws. 
  The ministry stressed to the Egyptian ambassador that these 
actions were taken within the framework of Sudan's tenancy and 
leasing laws and that the issue should not be misinterpreted and 
politicized. The ministry also emphasized that no one had been 
expelled, contrary to the contents of the two above-mentioned 
statements. 
  The ministry told the ambassador that the Egyptian media had 
treated the issue with exaggerated sensitivity and had accused 
the Sudanese Government of tackling the issue in a manner which 
went against international norms. 
  The ministry stressed that the Egyptian side's issuance of 
two different statements on the same subject, which were 
distorted, was inconsistent with international and diplomatic 
norms. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with President Mohamed 'Abd-al-'Aziz by </F>
unidentified correspondent; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Correspondent] Mr. 
President, recently you attended the Madrid seminar on peace in 
the Western Sahara and you called for an international seminar 
on Western Sahara. The question being raised, Mr. President, 
is: What are your views on the international support for this 
proposal, the holding of an international seminar on Western 
Sahara? Do you see this peace seminar as an alternative to or 
as an option for the peace plan, or both? 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] I would like to thank Algerian national 
radio's Channel 1 for following up the Saharan process to 
achieve freedom, self-determination, and national independence 
for the Saharan people. [passage omitted] 
  The past 21 years were characterized by war and escalation, 
sometimes with the Spanish and other times with the parties to 
the Madrid Agreement, and sometimes with the Moroccan 
Government. This period was also characterized by attempts to 
achieve a settlement sometimes by direct dialogue and sometimes 
by dialogue through international organizations. 
  Since the latest development in 1988, an agreement was 
reached on what has become known as the international UN peace 
plan on Western Sahara. This peace plan aims at organizing a 
free and democratic referendum for the Saharan people through 
which they could express their wishes regarding their destiny. 
  The referendum will be organized and supervised by the 
United 
Nations and the Organization of African Unity. It will ask the 
Saharan people whether they want independence or whether they 
want to join the Moroccan kingdom. The voters were defined 
according to the Spanish census of 1974. [passage omitted] 
  Optimism prevailed in the region and the world. Everybody 
believed that everything was moving forward and that the UN plan 
would have a happy ending at the beginning of 1992. 
  However, at that time the Moroccan Government backed down on 
its commitments and tried, by all means, to hinder the holding 
of a referendum on the Saharan people's self-determination. The 
main obstacle erected by the Moroccan Government was an attempt 
to impose on the Spanish census figures more than 170,000 
Moroccans as additional voters. Thus, the Moroccan Government 
tried to rig the referendum by replacing Saharans with Moroccans 
in the referendum in order to guarantee that the result would be 
in its favor and to impose a de facto situation for the 
occupation of the Western Sahara. 
  Since 1992 the United Nations and we have been trying to 
overcome the obstacles placed by the Moroccan Government. 
Undoubtedly, everybody knows that without the compromises put 
forward by Polisario in order to attain peace and the sacrifices 
we endured, the UN peace plan would have not been completed and 
the issue would have not advanced. 
  Everybody knows that for the sake of peace and a peaceful 
settlement we have accepted that an occupied people will be 
asked whether they want to be independent or to join the 
occupying country. It is usual to ask one question: Do you want 
independence or not? 
  Everybody knows that we have accepted that the referendum 
will be held with the presence of 65,000 Moroccan soldiers in 
the Western Sahara. Everybody knows that the referendum may be 
held with the presence of the Moroccan administration, the 
Moroccan police, and Moroccan settlers. Everybody also knows 
that this war machine, which has been forced by Morocco on the 
Western Sahara since 1975, will not be neutral during the 
election campaign or during the self-determination referendum. 
On the contrary, the entire war machine will be mobilized to 
confront and pressure the Saharan people during the referendum. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. President, you mentioned that the 
Saharan 
side has made compromises so that the UN peace plan can be 
implemented in the Western Sahara. The problem which will arise 
when the UN peace plan is implemented is the question of voters. 
Has the question of the voters been resolved yet and is it the 
only obstacle in the implementation of the peace plan? 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] No, the issue has not been resolved. The 
peace plan states that the Spanish census is to be the basis for 
vote counting. The Moroccan Government wants to add to the 
Spanish census 170,000 Moroccans who have nothing to do with the 
Spanish census or with the Western Sahara. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] Will there be a compromise between the 
Sahara's 1974 census and the Moroccan census? 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] The UN secretary-general presented a 
so-called compromise, which consists of five criteria, described 
as identification criteria. We have no problem with three of 
them because they are linked with the Spanish census. But we 
have expressed reservations over two of these criteria because 
they are the criteria of clan affiliation and of verbal 
testimony. If we adopt these criteria we will allow the 
Moroccan Government to bring in people as it wishes. 
Subsequently, these two criteria would allow the entire Arab 
Maghreb population or the entire Arab Maghreb to participate in 
this referendum if we adopted these criteria. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. President, can we go back to the point 
mentioned earlier. You attended the Madrid seminar on peace and 
called for an international conference on Western Sahara. Do 
you have high hopes for this international conference? How do 
you view international support for holding such a seminar? How 
do you see the the UN peace plan? 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] [passage omitted] In our view, an 
international seminar at this time and with those parties could 
overcome the obstacles confronting the peace process. The 
seminar could be a framework for dialogue to find a solution for 
the problems hindering implementation of the peace plan. 
  Therefore, as far as we are concerned, the seminar is not an 
alternative to the peace plan, rather it would facilitate 
implementation of the peace plan in an attempt to find a 
solution to the problems confronting it. 
  We have high hopes that the seminar, the initiative, and the 
call will be received positively by the various parties 
interested in peace in the Western Sahara. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. President, the United Nations suggested 
three options for settling the Saharan issue. Since then, 
nothing new has appeared on the implementation of these three 
options. What is your position on the three options, and what 
do see as an alternative to them? 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] The question of the options was not that of 
a 
Security Council resolution, but that of a report which the [UN] 
secretary-general submitted last March to the Security Council 
which included these three options. In the end, the Security 
Council chose the middle option, and this is the Security 
Council's resolution. This option became clear in that the 
identification commission should start its fieldwork for 
registering and sorting the voters in the field and submit its 
findings to the Security Council in the middle of next July. 
  Some sort of progress has been achieved, and we hope it will 
develop. We welcomed the commission and started cooperating 
with it in the field. It opened its offices in the refugee 
camps; it also opened offices in the occupied territories; it 
opened offices in neighboring countries and started the 
registration. We shall submit to the identification commission 
on 15 May [as heard] the applications on which the voters' names 
and their identities are recorded. It is expected that this 
will end at the beginning of June when the identification 
commission starts its work, that is, the commission, the two 
parties to the conflict, the OAU, and the two observer countries 
-- Algeria and Mauritania. Delegations will be formed from all 
these sides, and will receive the individuals to determine their 
identity, starting from the applications which we would have 
submitted on 15 May. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. President, are we to understand that 
there is progress in connection with determining the identity of 
the voters, and that the time is close for deciding on this 
issue? 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Yes, we have encouraged the commission, 
which 
started its work. This is considered as a new element in the 
development of the issue in the field. We shall judge the 
commission's work, its impartiality, and its ability to resolve 
an existing political problem through technical work between now 
and the end of its work. In fact, the information available to 
us is that the commission is now facing problems with the 
Moroccan Government and that the Moroccan Government is 
maneuvering over the commission's work and exercising pressure 
on the commission. We hope that progress will be achieved to 
bring closer the referendum date through the work which the 
commission is now carrying out. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. President, you said a short while ago 
that the Moroccan Government is exerting pressure. There is 
another kind of pressure which is even worse and which is 
manifested by the fact that Morocco recently redrew the 
administrative borders of some Saharan areas and started to 
sieze more territory and installed governors in these areas. 
How do you view these developments, which will, of course, 
hinder the course of peace? Do they mean that Morocco, at least 
at this stage, does not want peace? 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] In fact, all the stands and actions taken by 
the Moroccan Government since the adoption of the international 
peace plan contradict the text and the spirit of the UN peace 
plan. In addition to what I mentioned regarding Morocco adding 
further lists of Moroccans and its attempts to impose those 
lists on the United Nations, there are other acts such as the 
organizing [by Morocco] of legislative and local elections in 
Western Sahara, the administrative division introduced in 
Western Sahara by the Moroccan Government at the beginning of 
this year, and the appointment of Moroccan governors in Saharan 
regions. This is all happening while the Moroccan Government is 
required to facilitate the organizing of the referendum on 
self-determination for the Saharan people to decide on the final 
destiny of the Western Sahara. 
  All these acts demonstrate that the Kingdom of Morocco so 
far 
does not have the political will for a just and permanent 
peaceful settlement based on the right of the Saharan people to 
self-determination in accordance with international legitimacy 
and the UN and OAU resolutions. Furthermore, the Moroccan 
Government tries to take advantage of the regional and 
international circumstances in order to evade its obligations 
and what it agreed to in 1991 in connection with the organizing 
of a free and democratic self-determination referendum for the 
Saharan people. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. President, these actions by Morocco and 
its lack of political will for a settlement of the Saharan 
problem have caused some Saharan officials to waver between 
optimism and pessimism, some even went so far as to state that 
they expect the war to break out again in the Western Sahara. 
How do you view this? 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Of course, as I said, we will do our best 
not to lose the chance of peace and to see that the UN peace 
plan -- which is, in fact, a gain for the people of this region 
including the Moroccan people -- is not destroyed and lost. We 
are trying to make the peace plan achieve the goal of organizing 
a referendum in Western Sahara. 
  Of course, we are not on our own; there is the other party, 
and if there is a common will to achieve this goal, things will 
improve and progress will be made. But if our will for peace 
faces a Moroccan will trying to impose the status quo of 
occupation on Western Sahara, our will for peace will definitely 
fail and we will be forced into another status quo, that is, 
going back to war and struggle. 
  Of course we want peace, a peace needed by the Saharan 
people, the Moroccan people, and the people of the region. The 
modern world calls for peace and direct dialogue between the 
parties to conflicts everywhere in the world, and we are 
following this style and this course, but our will for peace and 
for a free and democratic dialogue in order to reach a solution 
based on respect for our people's desire for freedom and 
independence is equal to nothing else apart from our readiness 
to defend our legitimate national rights to freedom and 
self-determination. If we are forced into war again, we will be 
ready to fight it. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. President, you said a short while ago 
that the Saharan officials are working for peace. This is 
proved by the actions of the Saharan officials, led by your 
excellency, such as the recent visit to Washington where you met 
with American officials. We know that the United States is a 
member of the Security Council and, as a superpower, has a say 
in the Saharan issue. How did you find the American officials? 
What do they think and what is their stand regarding the 
Saharan issue? 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] It is undoubtedly clear to all that the 
Saharan issue was not well-known at international level. 
Furthermore, the Americans listened for a long time only to the 
Moroccan thesis and argument. However, we noticed that since 
ratification of the international peace plan [as heard], the 
U.S. stand has become positive on the whole. The United States 
will continue (?financing) the international peace plan. The 
United States did not hesitate to send its officers, soldiers, 
and officials to Western Saharan at the request of the United 
Nations. 
  During our visit to the United States, our interlocutors at 
the House of Representatives, the Senate, the Administration, 
and all groups with which we had talks showed a considerable 
level of understanding, particularly when [they realize that] 
the Saharan request consists in holding a free and democratic 
referendum through which the Saharan people will say what they 
want. We found that the Americans were sensitive to this issue 
and that they well understand our ideas and our request. We can 
truly say that on the whole the American stand is positive. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. President, one last question. In light 
of the facts, the new developments, and the current 
international situation, and according to the information you 
have about the peace process in Western Sahara, can we say that 
the settlement of the Saharan problem is going to happen soon or 
not? 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] My wish is that it will happen soon. As far 
as we are concerned, we must start action on the ground to hold 
the referendum as soon as possible. I think that this is the 
wish of the international community, too. The means appropriate 
to carrying out the referendum has been created, but the 
Moroccan stand expressed on all occasions and on the ground does 
not augur well. So far, any actions and any constructive 
initiatives aimed at proceeding forward on the path of 
implementing the peace plan and holding the referendum have been 
met with the conspiracies of the Moroccan Government and its 
attempts to make initiatives fail. It led to the failure of the 
Elayoune meeting to settle pending issues, and the New York 
meeting. All of these initiatives were thwarted by the Moroccan 
Government. Even now, we still doubt the Moroccan Government's 
desire for peace and its respect for international law. The 
Moroccan position leaves us doubting that the referendum will 
take place very soon. Therefore, we are cautious in our 
dealings; sometimes we make fresh initiatives and other times we 
accept compromises. But we have not seen anything in the 
Moroccan position which is encouraging, nor have we felt that 
there is a sincere intention on its part. 
  Therefore, seizing the opportunity offered by this 
interviewed with your radio station, I would like to address the 
world community with an urgent appeal to all peace- and 
freedom-loving people to bring the necessary pressure to bear on 
the Moroccan Government to comply with international laws and to 
implement its commitment under the peace plan on the Saharan 
people's self-determination.

  [Text] "The Palestinian Authority has the power to cancel 
previous legislation. This is no violation of the agreement." 
These remarks were made last night by Justice Minister David 
Liba'i in response to the decree by Yasir 'Arafat regarding the 
cancellation of the Israeli laws in Jericho. 
  Minister Liba'i added: "'Arafat tends to favor symbolic and 
demonstrative acts instead of coming down to the territories and 
starting to run the inhabitants' life and worrying over real 
needs. He did nothing by issuing a statement announcing that he 
is canceling the Israeli laws. According to the agreement 
between us, we have restricted the validity of their laws so 
that they cannot pass laws which contradict the agreement. He 
is no legislator, and has not presented an alternative or 
introduced order. All that he has done so far is make a 
statement." 
  The minister noted that the Palestinian Authority has the 
right to cancel some of the laws. It would not be a violation, 
he said, but the question is whether this is wise and how will 
it impact on the territory.

  [Text] Minister Moshe Shahal says that Yasir 'Arafat will 
not be able to visit Jerusalem without an official Israeli 
invitation, because a person fulfilling a political role cannot 
visit a foreign country without an invitation. 
  According to Minister Shahal the incidents between Israelis 
and Palestinian policemen over the last few days stem from a 
lack of coordination between the Israeli authorities and the 
Palestinian police. This is reported by our correspondent Dani 
Gur-Arye.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres has called on the 
members of the UN Security Council [UNSC] to immediately send 
funds to the Palestinians. He noted that Israel continues 
paying the salaries of the Civil Administration workers in order 
to prevent a crisis, though they are not under Israeli 
jurisdiction. The foreign minister asked the Japanese 
ambassador to immediately provide the Palestinians with $30 
million of the $200 million his country pledged to give them. 
  Minister Peres met in New York with the ambassadors of the 
members of the UNSC. Our correspondent Arye Golan reports that 
the meeting was attended by the PLO's UN observer, and the 
ambassadors of Morocco and Djibouti.

<F P=106> [Report by Aluf Ben, 'Aqiva Eldar, and Nadav Shragay] </F>
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Foreign Minister Shim'on 
Peres and U.S. President Bill Clinton held a meeting yesterday. 
Following the meeting, President Clinton said that "the coming 
year is the right time for introducing a change in the Middle 
East; the United States and I myself are willing to exert great 
efforts to help create a new situation in the region." 
  The President added that Peres' ideas regarding a regional 
framework for security and peace are appropriate, and that he 
recognizes the logic behind them and wants to encourage their 
promotion "through an attentive and helpful administration." 
  In the meeting it was agreed that the United States will 
undertake to create a "superstructure on a higher level than the 
multilateral negotiations framework." Peres said that the new 
structure, which will be similar to the CSCE, will include 
"three baskets": Security (arms control), economic (a regional 
market), and human rights. Israel will work out the plan 
together with the State Department. Peres assesses that Middle 
East countries which so far have refrained from active 
participation in the multilateral track will take part in the 
new initiative. 
  According to Peres, the Americans believe the Oman, Qatar, 
and Tunisia multilateral conferences played an important role. 
He divulged that these conferences were preceded by secret 
meetings between himself and the foreign ministers of Qatar and 
Oman in Cairo. Peres added that two more Arab countries will 
host multilateral meetings. 
  Yesterday Peres told U.S. congressmen that the sending of 
U.S. troops to the Golan Heights does not top Israel's list of 
requests. He said Israel will refrain from requesting to send 
U.S. soldiers to defend its citizens, "in order not to worry 
American mothers." 
  Despite Prime Minister Rabin's remarks downplaying the 
significance of 'Arafat's comments, Peres and Secretary of State 
Christopher yesterday demanded that 'Arafat reaffirm his 
commitment to the peace process. Christopher said: "It would 
be very helpful if 'Arafat once again stated his desire for 
peace. Commitments were made, and it is important that they be 
honored. We need an atmosphere in which we can work with mutual 
confidence." 
  Peres demanded that the PLO leader issue a "clear statement" 
reaffirming three points: his adherence to the Declaration of 
Principles signed in Washington on mutual recognition between 
the PLO and Israel; "denouncing all forms of terror and 
violence"; and promising that "all differences of opinion 
regarding the agreement be settled through diplomacy and in 
peaceful ways." 
  Speaking yesterday at the Carnegie Institute, Peres said 
that 
Israel and the PLO have not worked out a secret agreement 
regarding the holy sites in Jerusalem. According to Peres the 
Jerusalem issue "remains open religiously, but is closed 
politically. In due course Jordan will play a role in any 
agreement regarding Jerusalem, and will have an important role 
in safeguarding the holy sites." 
  Prior to his meeting with Peres, Christopher said that for 
the benefit of the bilateral talks, it is preferable not to 
convene all four tracks in Washington at the same time, adding 
that some of the tracks should be conducted in the region. He 
also said that no date has been determined for the resumption of 
the Washington talks. Earlier, Peres said that the Palestinians 
prefer to hold the autonomy talks on the rest of the West Bank 
in our region. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] </F>
  [Excerpts] Israel has begun holding contacts with U.S. 
congressmen prior to submitting a request for special U.S. 
military aid as compensation for an Israeli withdrawal from the 
Golan Heights within the framework of a peace arrangement with 
Syria. Israeli Ambassador in Washington Itamar Rabinovich met 
with a prominent senator several days ago and presented Israel's 
security needs in the context of an agreement with Syria. 
  Rabinovich explained that Israel would ask for aid in order 
to offset any damage to the IDF's [Israel Defense Forces] 
deterrence and preclude any surprise Syrian attack. Rabinovich 
stressed that since no progress had been made yet in the 
negotiations with Syria, these were only initial preparations 
and no official request has been formulated so far. [passage 
omitted] 
  Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq has briefed the Americans on 
Israel's security needs in the event of an arrangement with 
Syria and has asked for approximately $5 billion in special aid. 
Baraq also specified the new weapons systems Israel will need, 
especially in the deterrence field. 
  During Secretary of State Warren Christopher's last visit, a 
U.S.-Israeli working group was established to discuss the 
security components of the arrangement with Syria. On the 
Israeli side, the group includes the chief of staff; Amb. 
Rabinovich; and Major General Dani Yatom, the prime minister's 
military secretary, while the U.S. side is made up of the 
members of the U.S. peace team, including General Mike Ryan, the 
head of the planning department of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at 
the Pentagon. The working group held another meeting during 
Christopher's visit this week. 
  The presentation of the aid request to the Americans sparked 
sharp disagreements in the defense establishment because no 
staff work had been conducted and no detailed discussion held on 
the components of the procurement list before it was presented 
to the U.S. team. The chief of staff claimed that it is 
preferable to conclude the details of the defense aid with the 
United States at an early stage of the negotiations, in order to 
secure a U.S. commitment to assist Israel. 
  Defense Ministry Director General David 'Ivri claimed that 
an 
early agreement on U.S. compensation to Israel, even before an 
arrangement with Syria has been achieved, would enable the 
Americans to pressure Israel to accede to Syria's demands. He 
proposed putting off presenting the list of demands to the 
United States until progress is made in the negotiations with 
Damascus. 
  Yitzhaq Rabin, prime minister and defense minister, tried to 
resolve the differences and announced that the list handed to 
the Americans merely reflects initial ideas and thoughts and 
that more orderly staff work would be prepared on this matter in 
the future. The Defense Ministry director general said during 
internal consultations that he will demand that the procurement 
list presented to the Americans be amended and include a request 
to strengthen the U.S. commitment to Israel's defense against 
surface-to-surface missiles. 
  'Ivri explained that defense against surface-to-surface 
missiles will continue to be an important issue even after a 
peace arrangement is reached because of the threat posed by 
distant countries and the growing use of missiles around the 
world. This week, Scud missiles were fired in the war in Yemen.

<F P=106> [Report by Uri Revah] </F>
  [Excerpts] Some 140 new families settled in the Qatif Bloc 
since the Oslo agreement was signed nine months ago. Only 10 
families left the Qatif Bloc during that period. The Hof 'Aza 
Regional Council says today that expectations of compensation 
are not a factor in the Bloc's new settlers' decision. These 
details are revealed here for the first time by our 
correspondent Uri Revah: 
  [Begin Revah recording] Were they motivated by the long-term 
prospects of compensation or by Greater Israel ideology? What 
are the motives behind the 140 families' decision to settle in 
the Qatif Bloc after the Oslo agreement? For instance, 41 new 
families joined Neve Deqalim, versus eight that left the place 
during the period. [passage omitted] 
  In Nisanit in northern Gaza Strip, 61 new families settled 
since the agreement. One of the reasons may be the fact that a 
private house goes here for a mere 130,000 shekels. [passage 
omitted] 
  Dozens of empty housing units are still available in the 
Qatif Bloc, and these are expected to be inhabited within a 
short time. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Nadav Shragay and Revital Brakha] </F>
  [Excerpts] Thousands of people demonstrated yesterday at 
dozens of locations throughout the country demanding that the 
agreement with the PLO be suspended to protest "the 
deteriorating security situation and the increase in terrorist 
attacks." Until press time, it was reported that NRP [National 
Religious Party] Knesset Member [MK] Sha'ul Yahalom and two 
policemen had been injured. 
  Demonstrations were held, among other locations, at the 
Qiryat Shemona junction, the Miron junction, Karmi'el, Yoqne'am, 
Karkur, Rosh Ha'ayn, Haifa, the Golani junction, the Hadera 
junction, near the prime minister's home in Tel Aviv, and near 
the Prime Minister's Residence in Jerusalem. 
  Over 2,000 people took part in a violent demonstration near 
Rabin's residence in Jerusalem. The demonstrators clashed with 
policemen and attempted to storm the house. The police on its 
own initiative closed off the road opposite Rabin's residence 
and permitted the demonstrators to step off the sidewalk. 
However, when the crowd subsequently tried to forcibly rush at 
the house, they were repelled by dozens of policemen, some of 
whom were on horseback. 
  Serious traffic jams were reported at around 2200 [1900 GMT] 
after dozens of burning tires were thrown on King George street. 
Tires and dumpsters were also set alight in the Ge'ula 
neighborhood and Hashabat Square. [passage omitted] 
  Deputy Jerusalem Mayor Shmu'el Me'ir, who attended the 
demonstration, said that at the next municipal council meeting, 
he would propose awarding the title of friend of Jerusalem to 
anyone who would assassinate 'Arafat. [passage omitted] 
  Hundreds of right-wing demonstrators yesterday participated 
in a demonstration opposite the prime minister's home in Ramat 
Aviv. At the demonstration, which was organized by the Eretz 
Yisra'el Front, which includes all the right-wing parties, the 
organizers claimed that the murder of two soldiers at the Erez 
checkpoint on 20 May, proved that the peace was an illusion and 
the army's operation in Lebanon yesterday was just a flashy 
maneuver to justify the government's failure in the battle 
against terrorism. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Sources in Lebanon claim the Lebanese Government 
has recently rejected an Israeli proposal for the beginning of a 
peace process and security arrangements in the security zone. 
This proposal was submitted via U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher. 
  The sources told our correspondent Yo'av Aviv that according 
to the proposal, Israel is willing to withdraw its forces and 
end its presence in the Jazzin enclave. SLA [South Lebanese 
Army] forces in this region will be disarmed and replaced by 
Lebanese Army units. Security operations in the area will be 
coordinated by a joint IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and Lebanese 
Army committee. Over the next five years Israel will gradually 
withdraw from the security zone and transfer authority to the 
Lebanese Army, while the SLA will be incorporated as a separate 
unit within the Lebanese Army. 
  According to the sources, the Lebanese Government rejected 
this proposal, claiming it does not involve a full withdrawal, 
and that there is no room for a separate peace between Israel 
and Lebanon.

<F P=106> [Report by Dan Avidan] </F>
  [Text] Middle East expert, Professor Shim'on Shamir, said 
yesterday that to completely resolve the Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict, the Israeli Government must make several gestures to 
the Palestinians in the context of the permanent arrangement. 
  Shamir said these gestures should primarily include Israeli 
sanction of some sort of Palestinian national foothold in East 
Jerusalem. "I do not believe the Palestinians can be brought to 
end the conflict with us entirely unless they have a collective 
foothold in East Jerusalem," Shamir said. 
  He added that the foothold could be in the form of national 
institutions, a functional partition of the united city, or the 
like. Unless the Palestinians are given some foothold in East 
Jerusalem, the Muslim world will declare a holy war (jihad) for 
the liberation of Israeli-held holy Muslim sites in Jerusalem, 
Prof. Shamir warned. 
  He argued that granting the Palestinians some kind of 
dominion in East Jerusalem is one of the steps the Israeli 
Government must take to give the Palestinians a sense of having 
achieved a just arrangement attaining at least some of their 
national goals. Otherwise, the agreements which the Israeli 
Government and the Palestinians have signed or are expected to 
sign will be unstable and short lived. 
  In the framework of these steps, Prof. Shamir said, the 
Government of Israel will have to accede to several other 
Palestinian demands: to withdraw from most of the West Bank and 
Gaza without leaving large settlement enclaves behind; to 
recognize in principle the diaspora Palestinians' right of 
return to the West Bank and Gaza territories in which a 
Palestinian entity will be eventually established; to permit the 
Palestinians to enjoy a sense of temporary sovereignty in the 
West Bank and Gaza before they forge a confederative alliance 
with Jordan. 
  Prof. Shamir said that these terms are difficult for Israel, 
but unless they are met, the conflict between us and the 
Palestinians will continue and become more extreme because in 
the meantime, the Palestinians will have acquired a political 
foothold in the territories, including security forces and a 
police, as well as international recognition as an "incipient 
state." 
  Prof. Shamir said that in general, the present time offers 
Israel, the Arab states, and the Palestinians a genuine 
opportunity to reach peace agreements. The opportunity stems 
from the changes the Arab world has undergone in the last 
decade, the most prominent of which is the supportive approach 
of new technocratic pro-West elites, which seek to end the 
Israeli-Arab conflict in a bid to build a stable Middle East in 
which economic activities can be safely conducted. Yet the 
prospects of turning this opportunity into reality largely 
depends on the parties' willingness to pay the necessary price. 
  Reserve Major General Shlomo Gazit said in his lecture that 
in his opinion, nuclear weapons will be introduced to the Arab 
Middle East in the near future. He asserted that a new 
strategic environment has emerged in the Middle East 
facilitating political negotiations and the attainment of peace 
accords between Israel and the Arabs. This situation evolved in 
the wake of several global and regional changes over the past 
few years, most notably the collapse of the Soviet Union and the 
end of the era of pan-Arab ideology in the region. 
  He argued that the sides -- Israel and the Arabs -- should 
hurry to achieve peace arrangements lest the congenial strategic 
environment change again. Unless political arrangements are 
achieved soon, the militant Islamic stream may grow and possibly 
come to power and form the leadership of some Arab countries and 
in the Palestinian public. If that happens, the conflict will 
evolve into confrontation between Judaism and Islam and become 
far more radical. 
  Gazit warned that a recurrence of the Hebron massacre at 
holy 
Muslim sites in East Jerusalem would provoke a jihad against 
Israel. According to him, the peace accords will on the one hand 
lower the Arabs' motivation to launch war, but on the other 
hand, the Arabs may be tempted to launch a surprise attack in 
the wake of the expected Israeli withdrawal from a considerable 
part of the territories. Gazit maintained that such a threat 
can be thwarted by reliable security arrangements that will 
strengthen, rather than weaken Israel following withdrawal. 
  Prof. Shamir and Gen. Gazit made these observations during 
the annual symposium held by the Jaffee Center for Strategic 
Studies at Tel Aviv University in memory of former Chief of 
Staff David El'azar.

    [Editorial report] All Israeli newspapers on 22 May carry 
commentaries on the 21 May IDF [Israel Defense Forces] operation 
in which Believers Resistance leader Mustafa al-Dirani was 
abducted. The commentaries applaud the army's operational 
capability and analyze the operation's goals, inherent message, 
expected upshot, and legitimacy. 
  A commentary by Ze'ev Schiff on page A1 of Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ 
in Hebrew, entitled "Perfect Intelligence," says the action 
"should be evaluated by two criteria: operationally and with 
regard to the degree of risk and prospects of success. 
Operationally, this was undoubtedly an impressive and very 
'clean' operation," "based on impeccable, commendable 
operational intelligence work." 
  Comparing this operation to the abduction of Shaykh Karim 
'Ubayd in 1989, Schiff concludes: "It now remains to be seen 
whether the premises that led to the operation will prove valid, 
and whether the abduction of al-Dirani will be more productive 
than that of 'Ubayd." 
  A commentary in Daniyel Bloch's "Position" column on page 1 
of Tel Aviv DAVAR in Hebrew, entitled "The IDF Reasserts 
Itself," says the operation's significance "goes beyond Ron 
Arad's fate. It transmits a clear message to Israel's immediate 
neighbors and to distant regions that the IDF has not lost its 
capability to initiate and carry out courageously and 
efficiently any unorthodox operations needed to safeguard the 
security of the state and of Israeli citizens, and to rescue 
Israeli soldiers and civilians wherever they are." 
  Bloch notes that "the importance of this daring and 
sophisticated operation is even greater at this time," as it has 
proven that the harrowing tasks carried out by the army during 
the intifadah have not impaired its operational capability. 
  Writing under the headline, "Kidnapping Will Undermine 
Hizballah Leaders' Sense of Security and Augment Syrian 
Involvement" on pages 1 and 4 of the same issue of DAVAR, Dan 
Avidan notes: "The significance of the al-Dirani kidnapping and 
transfer to Israel goes beyond the practical importance of his 
interrogation. This, because we can state even at this early 
stage that the kidnapping itself and its excellent execution 
have generated a sense of personal insecurity among Hizballah 
leaders at various levels." Avidan assumes that as a result, 
"Hizballah leaders may now change their stand" on the release of 
Ron Arad, although "no immediate positive results should be 
expected." 
  In Avidan's opinion, "the Lebanese and Syrian Governments 
have also been affected by the commando operation. Lebanon has 
already loudly protested the Israeli assault on its sovereignty, 
but it will not do much beyond protesting vociferously. Syria, 
whose inability to foil the commando operation was a blow to its 
prestige," "will almost certainly encourage Hizballah to launch 
anti-IDF operations in the security zone and denounce the 
Israeli operation. 
  "It can be safely assumed, however, that both the Syrians 
and 
the Lebanese will learn their lessons from the IDF commando 
operation; in addition, they too will prefer to end the Arad 
affair in order to avoid being humiliated in the future by this 
kind of IDF activity. Both countries -- particularly Syria -- 
will probably take behind- the-scenes action to convince the 
Iranians to release the navigator -- if the latter are indeed 
holding him." 
  Tel Aviv 'AL HAMISHMAR in Hebrew carries three commentaries 
on the subject. A commentary by Aharon Klein on pages 1 and 2, 
entitled "Six Years Too Late," asserts that "the operation 
constitutes a certain contribution to Israel's deterrent power. 
It has refreshed the Hizballah leaders' memory about 'Israel's 
long arm' which can reach anywhere. The question is whether it 
was carried out in the right place. A second Lebanon operation 
of this kind, that can provide information about Ron Arad or 
bring him back home, is hardly likely in the coming year. 
Al-Dirani was kidnapped only six years too late. What is 
certain, however, is that national morale will soar for at least 
a few days." 
  A commentary by Pinhas 'Inbari on page 3 of 'AL HAMISHMAR, 
entitled "Signal to Syria," links the operation to the peace 
process: "The kidnapping indicates a change in Israeli 
doctrine. Besides being an effort to obtain the release of Ron 
Arad and the MIA's, it was a signal to Syria." Since Syria 
failed to respond to diplomatic attempts to secure a "gesture 
toward Israel in a bid to improve the peace process atmosphere," 
"Syria will now have to make a different kind of gesture. 
  "The political process with Syria is based on the Israeli 
willingness to acknowledge the Syrian role in Lebanon in return 
for Syrian endorsement of Jordan concluding its talks with 
Israel. Yet since Syria continues shackling Jordan, Israel is 
now signaling that it may revert to its original demand that 
Syrian troops pull out of Lebanon and that Syria resign its role 
there." 
  The page-9 'AL HAMISHMAR editorial, entitled "Lesson for 
Terrorist Organizations," asserts: "The successful kidnapping 
of terrorist leader Mustafa al-Dirani should teach all the 
terror organizations that their hideaways are no guarantee of 
impunity." Noting that "the action was launched after all other 
options had been exhausted," the editorial says: "We must 
therefore congratulate the IDF for the successful operation, 
which was carried out without casualties or losses, and applaud 
the decisionmakers for taking the risks." The editorial adds 
that "unorthodox measures may and should be used against terror 
groups resorting to unorthodox methods, because there is no 
other way to deal with this kind of underground. 
  "It is to be hoped that the international community will 
view 
this action not only with understanding, but also with empathy, 
because the object of this successful operation was to defend 
international law and to enforce it in these dark jungles, which 
are a stain on the face of the earth." 
  Commentary by Ron Ben-Yishay on page 7 of Tel Aviv YEDI'OT 
AHARONOT in Hebrew, entitled "Why al-Dirani, Why Now," examines 
several aspects of the operation. Ben-Yishay argues that 
"al-Dirani is not an important Shiite leader," and "his value in 
the hostage bazaar may be even slighter than that of Shaykh 
'Ubayd." He concludes, nevertheless, that "al-Dirani may be a 
valuable political and intelligence asset." Another question he 
poses: "Why did it take us so long to get to Mr. al-Dirani?" 
  Ben-Yishay adds that the operation sought to achieve several 
goals, one of which was the need "to remind the dejected people 
of Zion of the IDF's prowess." Another "message was to the 
Palestinians: Beware! The IDF's arm reaches very far."

<F P=106> [Speech by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the </F>
Presidential Council, at "an expanded symposium" of "leaders of 
political organizations and trade unions and mass organizations" 
in Sanaa on 25 May -- recorded] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. 
May God's peace and blessings be upon his esteemed prophet. 
Brother citizens, ulema, intellectuals, trade union members. I 
again congratulate you on 'Id al-Adha and the fourth anniversary 
of the Yemeni unity. [applause] Yemen is passing through a 
serious and important turning point. We had never expected 
these developments to occur under the banner of unity and 
democracy on which our people pinned great hopes. Our people 
hoped that the realization of unity would bring security, 
stability, and peace and would allow free opinions and ensure 
human rights, and bury the partition of the past with all its 
characteristics and dimensions. They hoped that Yemen of the 
22d of May would be established with the cohesion of all the 
good men in the Yemeni arena. That was the hope of all of us 
and of all the good and nationalist Yemenis. We greatly 
welcomed the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] leadership's sharing 
and participation in all components of power. Many political 
force in Yemen were shunned in order to give the YSP leadership 
this opportunity. 
  We warned many political and nationalist forces that the 
political approach expounded by the traitor and incorrigible 
criminal al-Bid, who was regarded by every [word indistinct] to 
be brought up by their own intelligence organs. He has been 
under suspicion from the beginning. Many elements were misled 
by agent al-Bid's treasonous political approach. Al-Bid 
admitted his treason and agentry in front of many YSP 
leaderships. 
  We have known united Yemen since we came to this earth. 
Partition was always in the minds of certain leaderships but the 
Yemeni people have always been united in their belief, 
principles, and territory. This is proven by the fact that when 
the 26 September and 14 October revolutions began, the fighters 
from all parts of Yemen entered the same trench and in the same 
ranks to defend the revolution, in the north and in the city of 
Aden and in (?the governorates) and in all parts of the 
republic, and in order to expel the British colonialists. The 
partition was in the minds of certain leaderships. The Yemeni 
people never wanted partition. 
  'Ali Salim al-Bid and his treacherous clique longed to go 
back to the partition. In our political approach, we attempted 
to explain this to certain political forces and they simply 
believed that this was merely within the political endeavors 
that each one undertook to win the sympathy of others, and not 
that this individual longed for partition. He never believed in 
unity and did not come to unity out of conviction but came to 
unity within certain political and international circumstances, 
especially after the fall of the socialist bloc. He came to 
unity with grudges, keeping all the state's equipment and 
property in the southern part of the homeland. He kept in his 
own accounts both the cash belonging to government 
establishments and departments as well as the weapons, 
ammunition, and equipment. The traitor al-Bid kept them and 
never gave them to the state authorities. 
  During our talks with al-Bid, we asked him: Why don't you 
deliver these vehicles and equipment? He said: In fact this is 
party property. We said: This party is a state and not a 
political party in a showroom. You are a state and a party. 
This is state property. He placed all the funds of the 
government's establishments and bodies in private accounts. He 
never earned the state one single dinar. He left a debt of $4 
billion. If we look for these billions, we will find them in 
[words indistinct] or in private accounts for some of the 
secessionist leaderships under 'Ali Salim al-Bid, who does not 
hide his agentry and treason. 
  He began the crisis with his return to Aden on 19 August. We 
told the brothers in the leadership and in the party leaderships 
that al-Bid's return is undeclared secession. They said let us 
hold a dialogue. We invited the leaderships of mass 
organizations and parties and told them this is undeclared 
secession. They said let there be dialogue. We said let the 
political parties and organizations take part. We went on with 
this dialogue, which we called the dialogue of the deaf. This 
dialogue was in the interest of the YSP in the hope that results 
would be realized that would avert what we have today. This 
dialogue was held between Sanaa and Aden. This was one of the 
mistakes. The political forces did not realize that the capital 
was Sanaa. We should have held the dialogue in the capital. 
This does not mean that we belittle the trade and economic 
capital, Aden, which is the capital of all of us, but in order 
to make the other party submit and recognize the unity. If it 
was unionist, then let it come to the capital. However, we 
continued to move between Sanaa and Aden in the hope that we 
could reach results to avert what we have today. 
  Then came the Pledge and Accord Document. It was signed. 
Then he asked that we move to Amman. We said we can ratify it 
in one of the Yemeni capitals but he refused and said that we 
must go to Amman. Then we went and signed the document. He 
said that the other parties of the coalition should not sign it 
as partners but that the nationalist forces should participate 
and we said let that be. We said that we hoped the political 
forces would help preserve the coalition in order to save the 
homeland from the crisis. We then went to fraternal Jordan in a 
mammoth delegation. 
  Now we are offering many martyrs, the best of our sons, not 
for the love of power and not for raising the slogans of a 
victory by this party over that party. We are offering them in 
the name of the Yemeni people with their various political and 
nationalist organizations and forces with the aim of affirming 
the Yemeni unity. [applause] We will offer many martyrs for the 
unity of the land and people of Yemen. We are prepared to offer 
everything that is dear to us for the sake of unity. Not for 
triumphing over the criminal al-Bid in the YSP leadership but 
for the triumph of the truth and so that the will of this nation 
might triumph over the secessionists elements. 
  The current war is between the clique in the YSP and the 
Yemeni people. The biased media try to depict the war as a war 
between the north and the south. This shows us that certain 
media are fomenting the crisis, media that are financing the 
crisis and the secession. They are claiming that the war is 
between the north and the south, that a unity by force is 
impossible. 
  We were united out of our own free will. We have been 
united by a free, nationalist will and not by the will of the 
leaderships in the General People's Congress, the Reform 
Grouping, the Ba'th Party, the Nasirite Party, or the other 
political parties. It is the will of a nation. It was the 
people's will that forced everybody to realize unity. The unity 
has been realized. 
  Now the foreign media say that unity cannot be realized by 
force, that unity cannot be forced on the secessionist elements. 
I would like to discuss this issue clearly. Who is fighting at 
the front? Those who are fighting are the sons of Shabwah, 
Hadhramaut, al-Mahrah, Abyan, Lahij, and Aden. [applause] There 
are 11 military brigades with various kinds of weapons from the 
sons of Lahij, Abyan, al-'Awaliq, Shabwah, Hadhramaut, and 
al-Mahrah who are fighting in the front lines in defense of 
Yemeni Unity. [unidentified man is heard shouting an indistinct 
slogan amid audience applause] The biased media are defending 
the actions of secessionist elements through international 
communications (?claim) that the fighting is between the north 
and the south. The fighting is between the Yemeni people and 
the secessionist elements holding sway over the YSP leadership, 
a limited number of criminal soldiers and a number of criminal 
civilians in the YSP leadership. In this hall there are a 
number of leaderships and symbols of the southern governorates. 
They are well-known leaderships. 
  The traitor al-Jifri, who is known for his agentry and whose 
mission with which he came after the declaration of the Yemeni 
Republic, does not represent the south. We know the tasks 
assigned to this traitor. The security organs found important 
documents in the possession of the traitor al-Jifri and the 
tasks which he was assigned to implement in Yemen. He has now 
begun his plot when the secession was declared. He has now 
started to reveal his cards. 
  Hadhramaut, the biggest territory in the republic, does not 
vote with 'Ali Salim al-Bid. All the people of Hadhramaut 
denounce their [al-Bid's] presence in al-Mukalla except certain 
military units which are protecting them only in al-Mukalla but 
not in the Hadhramaut Governorate. Shabwah is in the hands of 
the unionists, Abyan is in unionist hands, Lahij is in unionist 
hands. He has no presence in al-Mahrah. Aden is afflicted with 
the YSP arsenal. 
  We have declared amnesty for those who are accomplices to 
this deplorable crime and we are still giving them an 
opportunity before we enter Aden. The Army is clamping a siege 
around Aden but it does not have the political decision to enter 
Aden in order to give an opportunity for those who claim to be 
unionists to define their position. This is also to avoid 
hitting civilians and [word indistinct] and to give them the 
opportunity to leave Aden and so that they may not be harmed. 
[applause] I am certain that the innocent citizens will be 
harmed in Aden. As for the YSP leadership, the secessionists, 
some of them are abroad, others went to Hadhramaut prepared on 
their cars [word indistinct] and the others are in readiness at 
the ports to leave Aden. Only innocent civilians will remain in 
Aden and they will [word indistinct] these coming problems. 
  I do not believe that a brave leader would take his plane 
and leave for Hadhramaut and prepare his cars to go abroad. The 
real leader would be the last to leave any position or trench or 
any [word indistinct]. This leader is at the front of the 
fleeing ranks. I do not consider as a leader one who is at the 
forefront of those fleeing. 
  The YSP knows him very well and we do not have to describe 
the traitor al-Bid. We told some of the leaders that this man 
is schizophrenic. They would say: Oh no, this president 
[Salih] is unjust, he does not want any voice besides his voice. 
  This is a madman, I [word indistinct] stayed with him for 
four years. They said the president does not want any voice 
other than his. It is all the same. 
  He is a demented, unbalanced person. The YSP is aware of 
this. from Qahtan to the last of them. This man can live only 
in a showroom. [word indistinct] used to appoint him a minister 
for six or seven months. He differed with his boss and escaped 
to Hadhramaut. He had some cars and he sold them. The 
leadership knows him. [Words indistinct] brother 'Ali (?Sani') 
is (?facing) the situation more than me or you. This is because 
they oppressed the people. They did not do this by force of 
political approach. They created means of oppression and terror. 
  Brother leaders of political organizations and parties, I 
highly appreciate your excellent stand in these difficult 
conditions. I call on all to effect national cohesion and to 
set aside all trivialities. I ask you to avoid all the negative 
aspects of the past within the framework of the party and 
political pluralism which have appeared rather suddenly now. We 
were not held to account for our political utterances. We must 
be held to account for this. We must benefit from freedom and 
political pluralism. This is a good phenomenon and must be 
preserved. We will deal with this, benefiting from the past and 
from our setbacks. Together we move to preserve the homeland's 
unity. In one trench we will all stand to defend Yemeni unity. 
[applause] 
  It is true that our resources and our people's resources are 
thin at this time compared with the funds which were taken by 
the leaders dominating the YSP, but with our meager resources 
victory will be on our side and the side of the nationalists. 
God will not grant success to this plot and nothing will result 
from it. Any funds man takes from outside the country to 
implement a plot will not make him successful. Never. The will 
of men and the principles and firm values of sincere men will 
triumph. Right and not wrong will triumph. [applause] 
  We hope that all the nationalist and party leaderships will 
continue to be cohesive and united to face this secessionist 
danger. We will work together on the battle front and on the 
political front and on all levels. Jihad does not only mean 
fighting the battle. We can all perform jihad: at the mosque and 
in all parts and areas of the country there is a form of jihad 
to preserve Yemeni unity. Even though we offer martyrs and 
sacrifices, it is worth it. It is worth the high price we are 
going to pay. There is no price higher than the blood which is 
being shed. 
  I would like to end my speech and give the political parties 
and leaderships the opportunity, so that we will emerge from 
this meeting with a united concept without instructions imposed 
from this rostrum. I hope the leaderships of the parties and 
social figures will come out with a unified national stand in 
the supreme national interests. I wish this meeting success. 
May God's blessings be upon you.

  [Text] The expanded national symposium attended by the 
leaderships of political parties and organizations, trade unions 
and mass and professional organizations; tribal chiefs and 
ulema; social figures, intellectuals and youth representatives; 
and all national forces and personages in all parts of the 
Yemeni homeland, ended in Sanaa last night. 
  The symposium issued a statement saying that the national 
symposium's pledge of allegiance to brother Lieutenant General 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, Presidential Council chairman, is a 
sincere pledge for the command of the battle for unity, for 
confronting secession, and for the march toward entrenching 
security and stability, and building a united Yemen which 
rejects partition, fragmentation, and the relinquishment of any 
inch of its territory--the Yemen of brotherhood, tolerance, and 
love. The symposium reiterated absolute condemnation and 
complete rejection of al-Bid's secessionist declaration and 
emphasized confrontation of the secessionists led by the traitor 
of the homeland, revolution, and nation, 'Ali Salim al-Bid. 
  The statement appealed to the Socialist Party leadership, 
cadres, and broad base which believe in unity and the homeland, 
to move fast and align with people's masses and political and 
national forces to face the threat and protect unity and 
constitutional legitimacy, and bury the crime of secession for 
ever. 
  The statement warned all states and regional and 
international organizations of the danger of dealing with the 
secessionist clique and said that the entire Yemeni people will 
regard such dealing as a flagrant hostile act against every 
Yemeni citizen and an interference in the internal affairs of 
the Republic of Yemen. The statement appealed to our Arab 
brothers and friends in the world, and all good men to rally 
round the Yemeni people, unity, progress, and stability.

  [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
Presidential Council chairman and supreme commander of the Armed 
Forces, last night chaired a meeting of the Defense Ministry 
leadership. The meeting was attended by Defense Minister 
Brigadier General 'Abd-Rabbuh Mansur Hadi and Brigadier General 
'Abd-al-Malik al-Sayyani, chief of the General Staff. 
  The conferees discussed a number of developments in the 
national arena, issues of concern to our Armed Forces, and the 
tasks assigned to them at this important phase in the life of 
our people and homeland in light of the all-out war declared by 
the war criminal and traitor al-Bid against the homeland, the 
people, and the unity, He has pushed the Armed Forces into the 
furnace of the bloody struggle to implement his secessionist 
plot and fragment the homeland. 
  The conferees discussed the military situation in light of 
the successes of our valiant Armed Forces and their defeat of 
the forces affiliated with the secessionist, rebellious gang in 
the Socialist Party leadership. 
  The brother supreme commander expressed appreciation for the 
efforts of the Defense Ministry leadership to follow up the 
tasks assigned to our Armed Forces to defend unity and protect 
legitimacy. He praised the heroic performance of the hero 
officers, NCO's, and soldiers of our Armed Forces in the 
confrontation of the gang of the secessionist, rebellious gang 
in order to abort its destructive, scheme. 
  The brother president and the supreme commander stressed 
that 
our Armed Forces are offering more sacrifices for the sake of 
safeguarding unity just as they have offered dear sacrifices and 
were at the head of the defenders of the Yemeni revolutions of 
26 September and 14 October, the Republic [words indistinct]. 
He also praised our Yemeni people's great support for their 
Armed Forces while they are performing their sacred duty to 
triumph for the people's will, unity, and democracy. He added 
that this great cohesion among the masses of our Yemeni people 
and our valiant Armed Forces, and their creative response to all 
the efforts being exerted in the battle of defending the unity 
and protecting Constitutional legitimacy, constitute the actual 
embodiment of the high national spirit and awareness of the 
significance of the unity in the life of the people and the 
homeland as a great value, especially since it constitutes the 
strategic objective for the sake of which our people have waged 
a long struggle throughout the entire homeland. He added that 
this objective was the fruit of dear sacrifices. He said that 
based on awareness, we are ready to offer more sacrifices for 
the sake of unity and for keeping the flag of unity fluttering 
high over all the Yemeni homeland. 
  He stressed that our valiant Armed Forces will never allow 
the gang of rebellion and secession to peddle its secessionist 
scheme and sick dreams. They will teach this criminal gang 
enough lessons and throw it into the trash can of history, which 
is the destiny of every traitor. 
  The brother president urged the Defense Ministry leadership 
to take care of the brother officers, NCO's, and soldiers who 
were misguided by the secessionist gang, and who later joined 
their brothers and colleagues in the Armed Forces, after facts 
became clear and all veils dropped from the faces of the 
secessionist rebels who sought to foment sedition in the 
homeland and to push the sons of the Armed Forces and the 
comrades-in-arms into the furnace of internecine fighting for 
the sake of achieving their selfish and personal interests. 
  He hailed the heroes of our Armed Forces on whom the 
secessionist gang wagered to stand against unity. However, they 
foiled its gamble, disappointed it, declared their loyalty to 
unity and Constitutional legitimacy, and proved the credibility 
of their loyalty to God, the homeland, the revolution, and unity. 
  The brother president and supreme commander called on the 
rest of the brothers who were misled by the gang of secession 
and rebellion to join their brothers and colleagues in the Armed 
Forces, and the ranks of unity and legitimacy, to benefit from 
the general amnesty declaration, and to seize this opportunity 
in order to prove their sincere nationalism, love for their 
homeland, and their concern for its higher interests. He noted 
that they will get every care and will enjoy the same rights and 
duties of their brothers in the Armed Forces. 
  The president beseeched God to have mercy on the souls of 
the 
righteous martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the sake of 
unity and the homeland. He said the successes achieved by our 
Armed Forces against the forces of apostasy and secession were 
the result of support from God and the masses of our people in 
the battle of right against falsehood, good against evil, and 
the battle of triumphing for unity, because it is the banner of 
pride, dignity, and prosperous future [words indistinct].

<F P=106> ["Text" of an appeal by Defense Minister 'Abd-Rabbuh Mansur </F>
Hadi to the "misled" forces; date not given] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. 
Peace and blessing be upon His noble Prophet. To the misled and 
helpless brother officers, noncommissioned officers, and 
soldiers: O heroes of the Armed Forces--officers, NCO's, and 
soldiers: You have always been a symbol of national unity and a 
splendid example of national cohesion. You had the honor of 
taking the initiative to reunite the homeland. Therefore, you 
categorically rejected the instructions of the gangs of apostasy 
and secession and sided with the constitutional legitimacy, that 
is, with the people and the unity of the homeland. Therefore, a 
decree under Law No. 1 for 1994 was issued announcing a general 
amnesty in appreciation of these stands. 
  Consequently, the Defense Ministry has fixed the reception 
areas as follows: 
  1. The Aden axis. The brother officers, NCO's, and soldiers 
in the Aden Governorate should report to the units near their 
places in order to be sent to the military areas where they can 
perform their service. 
  2. The Lahij axis. The brother officers, NCO's, and 
soldiers should report to the units near their places in order 
to be sent to the military areas where they can perform their 
service. 
  3. All shall enjoy all rights and duties enjoyed by others 
in the Yemeni Armed Forces in accordance with the 
above-mentioned decree. 
  4. We appeal to all to respond and benefit from the sympathy 
and tolerance expressed by the decree toward the misled and 
helpless ones by joining the forces of legitimacy in order to 
form one unified army that fights bravely and faithfully for the 
sake of the people and homeland. 
  It is God who grants us guidance and success. 
  [Signed] Staff Brigadier General 'Abd-Rabbuh Mansur Hadi, 
minister of defense

  [Excerpts] An Egyptian diplomatic source in Cairo today 
revealed that the United States has embarked on contacts with 
Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, in an attempt 
to end the fighting and start a dialogue between the two parties 
to the conflict in Yemen. The same source added that the three 
Arab states can ensure indirect dialogue between northern and 
southern Yemenis and that they have played a mediatory role 
since the beginning of the crisis in Yemen. The source said 
this mediation aimed at safeguarding Yemen unity without using 
force. The same source said these three Arab states will ask the 
northerners to agree on a cease-fire in exchange for canceling 
the southerners' unilateral declaration of independence. 
  Sanaa took this clear U.S. stand seriously. In the wake of 
this U.S. stand, Yemeni Planning Minister 'Abd-al-Karim 
al-Iryani announced that the government in Sanaa is holding 
contacts with some Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] leaders to agree 
on holding a dialogue. Al-Iryani, who is close to President 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, added that his government is ready for a 
cease-fire in exchange for YSP's recognition of Yemen unity, 
which was declared in May 1990 and which has been abandoned by 
the southerners. 
  Al-Iryani said: Following the secession decision, we cannot 
deal, hold a dialogue with, or find a place in politics for YSP 
Secretary General 'Ali Salim al-Bid or Haydar Abu-Bakr 
al-'Attas, who was charged with forming the government of the 
new southern state. 
  The second factor which could have influenced the Sanaa 
decision is Aden's reiteration today that the southern forces 
have regained the combat initiative from northern forces that 
had infiltrated over the past three weeks of the fighting. 
[passage omitted] 
  'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, who reiterated the northern forces' 
control over Abyan, Lahij, and Shabwah Governorates, today 
admitted that the objective of entering Aden by all means, which 
was announced by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, no longer exists. He 
said: There might not be a need to enter Aden, as the political 
solution could be reached before this. The northern minister 
said the Sanaa forces are maintaining their positions on the 
eastern front, adding that the northern forces are now preparing 
supply bases before moving to the east toward Hadhramaut, where 
al-Bid has moved.

<F P=106> [Report by Laurence Peter] </F>
  [Excerpt] Sanaa, May 25 (AFP) -- Hundreds of mourners bayed 
for the blood of southern leader 'Ali 'Salim al-Bid Wednesday 
[25 May] as they buried victims of Monday's Scud missile attack 
on the capital. 
  Crowds lined the streets here as the bodies covered in white 
shrouds were carried aloft on stretchers from the central mosque 
to the At-Tahrir (Freedom) cemetery. 
  "Death to 'Ali Salim al-Bid" they chanted at the cemetery 
gates, as the funerals of the first nine victims took place. 
They included three children, one of them a toddler buried next 
to its mother. 
  Officials in Sanaa said at least 13 people were killed and 
more than 100 injured when the missile struck a 
densely-populated area of the capital late Monday, destroying 
houses and damaging a hospital. 
  Meanwhile a southern military spokesman in Aden said 400 
northern troops had been killed in fierce fighting around the 
key military base of Al-'Anad, which the south had recaptured 
from the north. 
  Fighting has raged around the base, 60 kilometres (36 miles) 
north of the southern stronghold of Aden, since civil war broke 
out on May 5 between troops loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih and forces headed by his southern rival al-Bid. 
  The base, at the gateway to the road to Aden, was seized by 
northern troops on May 17. There had been no confirmation or 
denial from Sanaa Wednesday that it had lost control. 
  In the capital, Monday's missile attack provoked outrage 
among mourners who gathered to witness the funerals. 
  "This is a criminal act. More rockets will increase our 
determination to cleanse our Yemeni land of the criminals' dirty 
bodies," said Husayn al-Sayaghi, a 42-year-old engineer. 
  At least 22 surface-to-surface missiles have been fired by 
southern troops into the north of Yemen since the start of 
hostilities. The north has also retaliated by firing missiles 
on Aden. 
  Koranic verses were chanted during the burials, as 
gravediggers lowered the bodies into the graves and then filled 
them in with stone blocks and wet clay. 
  They had been brought in Red Crescent vans to the central 
Qubbat al-Mutawakkil (Dome of the Faithful) mosque for prayers, 
before being taken to the cemetery. 
  In Aden a spokesman said that troops from the newly declared 
Yemeni Democratic Republic had inflicted "heavy losses on enemy 
troops on all the war fronts." 
  Witnesses said northern troops had kept up the pressure on 
southern troops deployed around Aden in a bid to defend the city 
from a northern advance. 
  A southern spokesman said in Kharaz Bab el-Mandeb, west of 
Aden, "all enemy units had been wiped out" by troops, while in 
Abyan in the east of Aden "hundreds of northern troops had been 
killed or wounded" in a southern counter-offensive. 
  Fighting was still reported in the vital oil-rich province 
of 
Shabwah. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Muhammad 'Abd-al-Hadi from Aden] </F>
  [Text] 'Ali Salim al-Bid, chairman of the Presidential 
Council of the Democratic Republic of Yemen, speaking at a news 
conference in al-Mukalla in the Hadhramaut Governorate, said 
that the current military situation in Yemen is unstable and 
fluid. 
  [Begin al-Bid recording] Al-'Anad... [pauses] We are now 
around al-'Anad and Jibah. We have been in and out of them for 
a few days now. The north will not be able to achieve anything. 
We will resist. We will impose our regime and method. We will 
impose the Pledge and Accord Document, the document of Yemeni 
national consensus. [end recording] 
  According to Military Communique No. 25 of the southern 
Armed 
Forces in Aden, the southern troops have scored new victories on 
the al-'Anad-Kirsh line, regaining full control of the situation 
on this line, inflicting heavy losses on northern forces, and 
forcing them to retreat. Northern officers and soldiers have 
been joining the southern forces in droves. 
  According to a southern military source, southern troops 
backed with effective air support, successfully bombarded 
northern troops trying to break through southern defenses in 
Shabwah. 
  In Abyan, a southern military source said that southern 
troops are still besieging al-'Amaliqah northern troops in 
Zinjibar, the capital of Abyan. The source added that southern 
artillery, jet fighters, and navy have dealt crushing blows to 
the remnants of northern troops. Units of the southern commando 
units in Zinjibar are locked in fierce battles with remaining 
pockets of northern forces. 
  A responsible source at the Defense Ministry in Aden said 
that preliminary reports indicate that thousands of northern 
troops have been killed and that hundreds of tanks have been 
destroyed. The source categorically denied that the southern 
troops fired a missile on Sanaa last night. The source said 
that citizens are not a target of any military operation by 
southern troops. 
  Over the past two days, large demonstrations went out in 
various governorates of the republic to denounce the rocket 
bombardment by northern forces of a residential area in Aden two 
days ago. The demonstrators also expressed their joy over the 
creation of the Democratic Republic of Yemen.

  [Text] The Yemeni News Agency, SABA', has learned from 
reliable sources reached by telephone in Djibouti that the 
family of Muhammad 'Ali al-Qayrahi, one of the secessionist 
leaders in the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], and families of 
some other YSP officials, had arrived in Djibouti three days 
ago. The sources added that as part of the exodus from Aden to 
Djibouti, a Russian ship carrying a number of families, 
including the families of some officials implicated in the 
secessionist plot led by YSP rebels against legitimacy, headed 
by traitor 'Ali Salim al-Bid, arrived at Djibouti port 
yesterday. The sources said the quarters that receive and 
accommodate these families deliberately disembarked some 
ordinary passengers and families from the ship for camouflage 
purposes and kept the families of ranking YSP figures on the 
ship until darkness as a security precaution and for fear of 
their being identified. 
  The secessionist, mutinous leaders are sending their 
families 
abroad, leaving the Aden people and their families as well as 
the misled and helpless ones in the Armed Forces to face dangers 
alone and serve as human shields to secure these leaders' escape 
and reunion with their families after having become certain that 
Aden's fall is imminent and that they will fall into the hands 
of the forces of unity and legitimacy.

<F P=106> [Report by Faysal Makram, Iqbal 'Abdallah, Zaki Shihab, and </F>
Muhammad 'Allam: "North Preparing To Attack Hadhramaut"] 
  [Excerpts] Sanaa, Aden, Cairo -- Neutral sources said 
yesterday that northern forces were continuing their pressure on 
southern forces, that they had already seized Shabwah 
Governorate, which is rich in oil, and that their next step will 
be to penetrate Hadhramaut Governorate, birthplace of Yemeni 
Socialist Party [YSP] Secretary General 'Ali Salim al-Bid. 
[passage omitted] 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali, member of the YSP Political 
Bureau, has told AL-HAYAH that meetings will be held in a few 
days between officials of the new state and the Egyptian 
Government. He pointed out that an envoy from Aden will 
tomorrow submit a request to join the Arab League. Al-Dali 
said: "'Ali Salim al-Bid and the Yemeni people in the south are 
most appreciative of President Husni Mubarak's position on the 
Yemeni crisis," describing it as a "courageous position." 
  Last week Mubarak held Yemeni President 'Ali Salih 
responsible for the continuation of the fighting and urged him 
to observe an unconditional cease-fire and to initiate a 
dialogue. He also described the northern forces' presence in 
the south as "occupation." Al-Dali added: "Al-Bid would not 
have barked on the secession step without consulting with a 
number of Arab leaders. He did not name them. He interpreted 
the Arab silence about the the question of recognizing the state 
as "positive and aimed at studying the situation." He expressed 
his belief that "Arab recognition will take place within days." 
He noted that "President Mubarak, United Arab Emirates 
President Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan, and most Arab 
states stressed that the continuation of the war means 
destroying unity."

  [Text] Brothers 'Abd-al-Rahman 'Ali al-Jifri, deputy 
chairman of the Presidential Council, and Anis Hasan Yahya, 
chairman of the Provisional Assembly for National Salvation, 
have issued a press statement to the YEMENI NEWS AGENCY, in 
which they said: Over recent days a number of Western and 
foreign media have reported on efforts to bring about a 
cease-fire in Yemen. Inasmuch as the institutions of state in 
the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY] are responsible for such 
matters, we, on the basis of the firm positions we have adopted 
in rejecting the war, and our decision to enter a defensive 
battle to foil this treacherous attack, declare to our great 
Yemeni people and to all local, Arab, and international 
quarters, that the solution to the existing crisis -- which was 
transformed by the rulers of Sanaa into a destructive war -- can 
only be achieved through the following: 
  1. A final ending of the war and the withdrawal of all 
attacking forces to the positions they occupied prior to 22 May 
1990. 
  2. The immediate beginning of negotiations -- without 
pre-conditions and under the auspices of the Arab League -- this 
arising out of a desire to arrive at a peaceful solution within 
the Arab framework, so that further bloodshed and general 
destruction can be halted, and to prevent a resumption of 
fighting, thus guaranteeing peace and stability in Yemen, the 
Arabian Peninsula, and the Arab world. 
  Our position constitutes proof of our continued responsible, 
patriotic concern. We have mobilized for the sake of the 
homeland, and we have made sacrifices along this path. At this 
moment we continue to pay the price for rejecting the war. We 
are eager to stop the shedding of Yemeni blood, which is being 
shed with impunity and unjustly, only to serve the insane 
purposes of those who began this war.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] 'Abd-al-Ghani Makkawi, leader 
of the Yemeni National Grouping, has said unity cannot be 
imposed by the force of arms. He noted that reconciliation and 
dialogue are the basis for any solution in Yemen. 
  In an interview published by al-Shariqah AL-KHALIJ today, 
Makkawi said the Document of Pledge and Accord remains the ideal 
formula to achieve stability in the country. 
  Makkawi, who was appointed a member of the Presidential 
Council in the declared Democratic Republic of Yemen, said 
ending the military operations hinges on the will of President 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, noting that these operations cannot 
achieve a final solution to the situation unless the northern 
army turns into an occupation army, which is unacceptable and 
out of question. 
  Makkawi hinted at the possibility of a meeting between 
President Salih and 'Ali Salim al-Bid in Paris soon. He said: 
If agreement is reached to avoid the negative aspects that 
accompanied the declaration of unity, then results will be 
promising.

<F P=106> [Report by Ibrahim Humaydi: "'Ali Nasir Tells AL-HAYAH: </F>
Secession Decision Foolish"] 
  [Excerpts] Damascus -- Former South President 'Ali Nasir 
Muhammad yesterday vehemently attacked 'Ali Salim al-Bid, 
secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party, for announcing 
secession. He described the decision as "foolish." He stressed 
that he had turned down an offer from al-Bid to hold the post of 
deputy chairman of the presidential council in the "Democratic 
Republic of Yemen." [passage omitted] 
  'Ali Nasir said that he had requested al-Bid to "abandon the 
decision to secede and to return to dialogue" with Lieutenant 
General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, "because secession will not solve 
the problem." [passage omitted] 
  'Ali Nasir still believes that the "Pledge and Accord 
Document" signed in Amman in February "represents a base for 
solving all problems and contains comprehensive solutions to the 
crisis." He added that my return to Yemen "in these conditions 
is not my current concern. My concern is to bring an end to the 
fighting."

  [Text] Damascus, 25 May (MENA)--Former Yemeni President 
'Ali Nasir Muhammad has praised the efforts exerted by Arab 
leaders, primarily President Husni Mubarak, King Fahd 
Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, and Shaykh Zayid Bin-sultan, to contain the 
Yemeni crisis. 
  Speaking to a MENA correspondent in Damascus tonight, the 
former Yemeni president said that he and several Yemeni figures 
are holding consultations to stop things deteriorating in Yemen, 
achieve a cease-fire, reverse the south Yemeni decision to 
secede, and start negotiations. The new initiative, he added, 
also aims to lift the siege on several Yemeni cities, preserve 
unity, and end the bloodshed.

<F P=106> [Military Communique No. 26, issued by the command of the </F>
Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Yemen; place and date 
not given] 
  [Text] Our Armed Forces have continued their heroic 
military operations against the forces of aggression and enmity, 
led by the bloody and treacherous al-Ahmar gang, since their 
instigation of total war against our people in the DRY. Our 
heroic forces were able to deliver crushing blows to enemy 
forces on all battlefronts in the Kharaz-bab al-Mandeb, 
al-'Anad-Kirsh, Abyan, and Shabwah Governorate areas. 
  Reports from these battlefronts indicate that our forces, 
which are being supported widely by the people of our young 
Republic, have inflicted great defeats on the oppressive enemy 
forces in the Abyan Governorate, inflicting heavy losses of life 
and material on them. Our forces there captured an infantry 
battalion, complete with its arms and equipment. Yesterday, our 
forces destroyed a number of tanks and four Katyusha rocket 
launching vehicles, and also captured four tanks and two 
Katyusha rocket launching vehicles. They inflicted heavy losses 
of life on the enemy on this front, with hundreds of them killed 
or wounded. 
  On the al-'Anad-Kirsh front, our forces dealt mortal blows 
to 
the forces of aggression and enmity, inflicting heavy casualties 
of over 200 killed and wounded. Our forces destroyed eight 
enemy tanks and three Katyusha rocket launching vehicles. They 
also captured three tanks and four enemy Katyusha rocket 
launching vehicles. As a result of these heavy losses, the 
enemy forces were forced to take flight or surrender, 
particularly after realizing that the al-Ahmar gang had 
literally thrust them into the fire from which there was no 
escape, except through retreat or surrender. 
  The morale of our forces is very high, and they will win 
their victory, God willing. God is great. God is great. 
  Issued by the command of the Armed Forces of the DRY.

  [Text] Brother 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Jifri, the deputy 
chairman of the Presidential Council, has issued a statement to 
the YEMENI NEWS AGENCY in Aden regarding reports by Sanaa media, 
which warn ships and aircraft against using the ports of the 
Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY], as they are exposed to 
danger. He described the statement as being one of a string of 
lies, and as being totally unsupported by the facts. He 
stressed that harbors and airports in the DRY were safe. 
  He said: We take full responsibility for protecting ships 
and aircraft using these ports. The deputy chairman also 
stated: We are capable, with the help of almighty God, and by 
virtue of the power of our Naval and Air Forces, of maintaining 
total control of the Republic's waters and airspace. 
  Brother 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Jifri warned the Sanaa regime 
against attempting to attack DRY ports, as a gamble of this sort 
would result in a decisive response. He said: Were it not but 
for our concern for the interests and resources of our people in 
the north, we would be capable of imposing a total maritime 
blockade on al-Hudaydah (?and al-Mukha). The brother deputy 
chairman of the Presidential Council warned the regime in Sanaa 
against exploiting our spirit of responsibility by issuing 
inane statements during the weak and chaotic situation that that 
regime is currently experiencing.

<F P=106> ["Unscheduled announcement"] </F>
  [Text] Brother listeners: The fate of thousands of members 
and cadres of the [Yemeni] Socialist Party [YSP] in Aden is 
shrouded in mystery. Following the proclamation of secession in 
the early hours last Saturday [21 May], reports said that 
members of the YSP Political Bureau and the Central Committee 
have been under house arrest. Unconfirmed reports say that a 
number of those members -- particularly the ministers or members 
of the House of Representatives -- have been killed. 
  Political observers noted that following the declaration of 
secession, Aden Radio did not broadcast a congratulatory cable 
to al-Bid from [former defense minister] Haytham Qasim, but 
broadcast Haytham's letter to soldiers and officers on 'Id 
al-Adha. The observers interpreted this as an indication that 
differences have surfaced between al-Bid and Haytham. This, 
they added, was what prompted al-Bid to leave for al-Mukalla 
after 'Adnan [not further identified] helped him gain control of 
Aden and the radio so that al-Bid could broadcast the secession 
statement from Aden radio in his own voice. 
  The observers noted that the formation of what al-Bid called 
the presidential council includes names that do not exist in 
Aden. Consequently, such a body can never hold a session. 
Al-Bid's thirst for the title of president was behind the 
issuance of the first order appointing al-Bid as the president. 
He did not even find an adviser or legal scholar to draft a 
decision based on any constitutional or legal law. 
  Political analysts said anybody who has followed the reports 
broadcast over Aden radio since the declaration of secession 
will find that the newscasts have not included, over the past 
three days, any statements of support even from the YSP bodies 
to which al-Bid is affiliated. The Aden radio newscasts also 
show that only four people support al-Bid: Salim Jubran in 
al-Mukalla, Shaykh Hani (?al-Hadshi) and [name indistinct] in 
Aden, and a fourth person residing abroad. 
  The analysts added that al-Bid's choice of 'Abd-al-Rahman 
al-Jifri to be his deputy shows that the two men have agreed to 
return the rule of shaykhdoms and sultanates to the southern and 
eastern governorates so that Aden will become the capital of the 
shaykhdoms while Hadhramaut will be the lot of [former prime 
minister] Haydar al-'Attas, who was the only person who assumed 
a leading position in the YSP despite his affiliation with a 
sultanate dynasty. He is also known for his affiliation with 
the [words indistinct] the Hadhramaut Governorate. The return 
to the rule of sultanates will allow al-Bid, al-'Attas, and 
Bin-Husaynun to impose full control over the Hadhramaut oil 
after ridding themselves of the rest of the group, which is 
linked, through marriage, with the families of these three 
persons. The political analysts believe that al-Bid's 
appointment of (?Bin-Suraynah) as Shabwah governor is evidence 
of this. 
  The political analysts ruled out the achievement of any of 
these goals because the way al-Bid and the separatist clique 
have acted has deprived them of any credibility, particularly 
before the sons of the southern and eastern governorates. The 
secession statement showed them to be a group of agents for an 
external party which has used them over the past four years to 
tarnish the image of Yemeni unity abroad and to undermine it 
locally through the crises and riots which they engineered. 
  The task of the forces of constitutional legitimacy, unity, 
and democracy now receives Arab and international sympathy and 
support.

<F P=106> [Reports by 'Abdallah Hammudah in London, Taj-al-Din </F>
'Abd-al-Haqq in Abu-Dhabi, Hammud Munsir in Sanaa, and Najib 
Sadiq in Aden: "Al-'Attas Stresses That Declaration of 
Democratic Republic of Yemen Was a Foregone Conclusion Because 
Building of Unitary State Had Been Obstructed. The United Arab 
Emirates Refer to al-Bid as `His Excellency the President'"] 
  [Excerpt] The official EMIRATES NEWS AGENCY yesterday 
referred to 'Ali Salim al-Bid, chairman of the Presidential 
Council in the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY], as "his 
excellency the president," an expression seen by political 
circles as "United Arab Emirates [UAE] media recognition of the 
DRY." According to informed sources in Abu-Dhabi, "the use of 
the expression 'his excellency the president' in reference to 
al-Bid was made on the instructions of political authorities." 
  Meanwhile, in a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, DRY Prime 
Minister Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas said that "the 
declaration of the new state was a foregone conclusion because 
of the situation which prevailed following the announcement of 
unity between the two parts of Yemen on 22 May 1990 and because 
of the failure to build Yemen's unitary state as a result of the 
insistence of the authorities in the Yemen Arab Republic on the 
old methods of government, until the war came to end the pending 
situation." 
  Al-'Attas emphasized that "the declaration of the DRY is a 
station to stop at and pause, so as to prevent matters getting 
out of hand and prevent expansion of the scope of the war in a 
manner that would lead to the emergence of new entities. It is, 
therefore, better to restore the pre-22 May 1990 situation and 
then use our brains to think about the unity march, taking into 
consideration matters which were ignored in the past when 
emotions ruled supreme and reason was totally absent." 
  The UAE sources said that "the media move may be an 
expression of extreme displeasure with President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih's disregard for the cease-fire appeals made by UAE 
President Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan frankly on more 
than one occasion." They added that that "may be a new way of 
putting pressure on Sanaa to respond and of warning it of the 
consequences of further escalation of the fighting to include 
densely populated towns." 
  Whereas the sources pointed out that the media recognition 
"might be a prelude to an official recognition of the DRY as an 
independent state, making the UAE the first state to recognize 
the new political situation in south Yemen and its declaration 
as an independent state," diplomatic observers noted that the 
EMIRATES NEWS AGENCY "avoided describing al-Bid as chairman of 
the DRY's Presidential Council and just gave him the protocol 
phrase preceding the name." 
  The sources also said that the UAE "was perhaps holding 
intensive contacts with other states to coordinate its steps 
with these states, although it may be the first to implement 
such steps." 
  It is worth noting that AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that 
there has been some kind of shift in the U.S. position away from 
insistence on Yemeni unity as called for by President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih. Furthermore, the statements made by [Egyptian 
Foreign Minister] 'Amr Musa at his news conference yesterday 
denoted a similar shift with emphasis on a cease-fire in Yemen. 
  The diplomatic sources said that "the UAE's recognition of 
the DRY may depend on the development of military operations on 
the ground, and if the south Yemeni forces managed to regain the 
initiative and stand fast in the face of the northern forces, 
that would not only pave the way for recognition but also for 
abandoning the neutral line taken on the conflict and making 
initiatives that would compel the intransigent party to accept 
mediation and good offices." 
  Al-'Attas said that the declaration of the southern state 
was 
"the only realistic way out in the current circumstances, 
placing on the shoulders of the northern leadership the 
responsibility of preserving a minimum degree of national unity 
to be developed in the future, while at the same time searching 
for a formula for new relations between the two Yemeni states 
and the states of the region to provide security, stability, and 
development for the entire region in the new conditions." 
  Asked what he thought of the position of the tribes and 
organizations opposed to Sanaa's leadership in northern Yemen, 
al-'Attas said: "That is an unfamiliar situation, a position of 
inaction despite the fact that there are patriotic figures and 
oppressed tribes there. The fighting taking place in the south 
is in defense of those people and their rights against the 
rulers there." He added: "Had they acted and supported the 
steadfastness of the southern and eastern governorates, the 
situation would have been different now and the label of 
north-south conflict would have disappeared, and the military 
clique would not have had the chance to strike at the unity 
forcing us to declare the southern state." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Press review] </F>
  [Text] Under the headline "Peres' Statement and the Israeli 
illusion," AL-BA'TH says: The Israeli officials' contradictory 
statements on peace and the terms of reference of the peace 
process continue. The latest of these statements was made by 
Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. Yesterday he asked Syria to 
normalize its relations with Israel, and emphasized that the 
normalization process should have begun with the negotiation 
process. 
  AL-BA'TH adds: This means that Peres wants normalization 
before the Israeli withdrawal from the occupied land. It is not 
ruled out that Israel wants normalization of relations while our 
land is under occupation. The statements by several Israeli 
officials, especially Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Peres 
emphasize this fact. 
  It says: In their statements, Rabin, Peres, and others have 
so far not referred to full withdrawal from the Golan, but they 
always and only emphasize withdrawal in the Golan. This 
emphasizes that Israel wants the peace process to entrench its 
occupation of Arab land, and then the Arabs should normalize 
relations with it. By this, Israel would have both peace and 
land. This is what Israel seeks through deeds, not words. 
  The newspaper stresses that these statements do not benefit 
the peace process, but are directed against it. The Israelis 
are mistaken if they believe Syria may give up its declared 
policy on the peace process. 
  The newspaper says: Syria's acceptance to participate in the 
peace process stemmed from its clear principles and constants, 
based on implementation of resolutions of international 
legitimacy and the land-for-peace principle. 
  The newspaper stresses that full and comprehensive Israeli 
withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories is unnegotiable as 
a condition for continuing the peace process with all its 
details. 
  The newspaper speaks about the Israeli policy which depends 
on maneuvers and evasion of the requisites of the peace process, 
and says: That policy is totally rejected by Syria. Syria 
always emphasizes that the basic condition for achieving a just 
and comprehensive peace is Israel's full withdrawal from our 
occupied land. Short of this, the peace process will continue 
to be stalemated. 
  The newspaper warns against the Israeli maneuvering policy 
because it will lead the peace process to a dead end, which is 
what Israel seeks. 
  AL-BA'TH concludes by saying: Israel should remember that 
the conflict is continuing and resolving it will not be easy. 
It is time for Israel to be aware that there will be no peace, 
security, and stability in the region while our Arab land is 
occupied.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] After Syria reiterated that the Israeli position 
has continued to shift further away from the requirements of the 
peace process that was launched in Madrid, and noted that a 
gaping gulf separated the Syrian and Israeli postures, Rabin 
govenment officials hastend to spread a false sense of optimism, 
claiming that the talks have not been deadlocked and the 
differences are bridgeable. They also raised the possibility of 
yet another Middle East shuttle by U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher next month. 
  Although Syria has consistently expressed its appreciation 
for the American efforts and showed its deep concern for the 
peace process to continue in order to promote a just and 
comprehensive Middle East peace based on UN resolutions and the 
land-for-peace formula, Syria is equally anxious to bring 
Israel's unyielding stubborness to the attention of the world 
community. 
  There has been a lapse of more than two and one half years 
since the Washington talks; Mr. Christopher has made numerous 
tours of the region; Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clintion 
held a summit in Geneva; and Syria has declared its readiness to 
set up firm and honorable peace in the region and to be 
obligated by all its requirements. Israel, however, still 
refuses to commit itself to a total pullout from the Golan 
Heights, thus thwarting all efforts and dashing all hopes that 
the peace process on the Syrian-israeli track may be propelled 
forward. Ever since the Madrid conference, Syria has let no 
occasion pass without reiterating that the Golan Heights are not 
subject to bargaining and that Israel will have to pull out from 
the entire territory. Indeed, many Israeli officials have said 
that peace with Syria seems to be an impossibility short of a 
total pullout from the Golan Heights. 
  When the Rabin govenment turns down the principle of total 
withdrawal, Syria takes this to mean that Israel rejects peace. 
Syria adheres to every grain of sand on the occupied Golan 
Heights. The territory's soil has a special sacredness to Syria 
and to the Golan's displaced population, who are waiting to 
return to their homes and reclaim their property and 
rehabilitate what was destroyed by invading Israeli forces. 
  The UN Security Council resolutions are clear and 
unambiguous. These resolutions state the inadmissibility of the 
acquisition of territory by force, bar change to its character 
or any tampering with its identity and history. They further 
call for Israel's publlback to the 1967 lines. The American 
initiative that led to the convening of the Madrid conference 
was based on the UN Security Council resolutions and the 
land-for-peace formula and a just and comprehensive peace on all 
front of the dispute. 
  If Israel goes out of its way to maneuver and blackmail by 
refusing to commit itself to a total pullout from the Golan 
Heights, it is now universally acknowledged that Syria will not 
bow to any form of blackmail or be dragged behind any 
maneuvering or budge an inch from its adherence to its land and 
rights. Peace is contigent on the entire Golan Heights being 
handed back to Syria and an Israeli withdrawal to the 1967 
lines. Syria will not renounce an iota of its land or rights. 
Israel alone must take the responsibility for the failed peace 
efforts and for sabotaging the American initiative on account of 
its procrastination and prevarication. Israel is taking a stand 
against the substance of the peace process, this being its 
withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories. 
  The American secretary of state's return to the Middle East 
in a new effort will not yield any results unless it is coupled 
with a substantive shift in the Israeli position. In other 
words, Israel must commit itself to the principle of a total 
withdrawal from the occupied territories and the strict 
implementation of Security Council resolutions and international 
law rather than the law of the jungle -- the law of occupation 
and expansion. 
  The question is not one of bridging the Israeli and Syrian 
positions as the Rabin government would have us believe. More 
to the point is to convince the Tel Aviv rulers to submit to UN 
resolutions and international law and the values of right and 
justice. Syria has always obligated itself to UN resolutions. 
Israel alone defies these resolutions and devalues international 
conventions. The world community never sanctioned the 
occupation of other nations' territory by force. Nor does it 
sanction any change to the character of any occupied land. 
Israel has no choice by to effect a complete withdrawal from 
the occupied territories if it really wants to see a just and 
firm peace prevail in the Middle East, as its rulers keep 
claiming.

  [Text] Hizballah Secretary General Hasan Nasrallah has 
called on the government and the prime minister to resign 
immediately because "this authority is not trustworthy and is 
not fit to govern a struggling people." He stressed the need 
for the "flaccid leadership to stop putting restrictions and 
limitations on the scope of the work of the resistance, which is 
a sacred weapon. The scope of the resistance must expand with 
the expansion of the scope of the aggression." He explained 
that this does not mean there should be self-security [for 
Hizballah] or that this will result in chaos but that there 
should be cooperation and measures that would enable the people 
to stand on the side of the state. While Nasrallah did not rule 
out the possibility of an internal breach of security by a 
double agent, he said the fate of Israeli navigator Ron Arad is 
a riddle "we cannot solve." 
  Nasrallah made these remarks at a news conference held at 
the 
Hizballah Information Mobilization office in Harat Hurayk 
yesterday to discuss the kidnapping of Mustafa al-Dirani, one of 
the leaders of the "Believers' Resistance." The news conference 
was held amid stringent security measures. 
  Nasrallah opened his news conference by noting that the 
targeting of one of the symbols of the resistance is an 
unleashing of the Zionist terrorism that is backed by U.S. 
equipment and technology and "encouraged by the international 
collusion manifested in its ugliest form in the way it dealt 
with the al-Ibrahimi Mosque and the various Zionist enemy 
attacks on Lebanon and the region." 
  He said: The Zionist enemy is trying to describe this new 
terrorist act as a courageous and heroic action to raise the 
morale of its soldiers and agents, which has sunk very low 
because of the blows of the Islamic Resistance strugglers. But 
we stress that this action, which benefited from advanced 
capabilities, and the way it happened proves the failure of the 
Zionists to confront the heroes of the resistance, who are 
facing, in broad daylight and with simple capabilities, all the 
enemy's tyranny and force. 
  He added: This serious Zionist violation followed the 
suppression of the media and freedoms and disregard for public 
opinion. The latest ridiculous situation was the farce of Prime 
Minister al-Hariri's staying at home as part of the struggle for 
posts and settling accounts within the authority. Again we 
caution and express concern over the fate of the country and the 
people, not just the fate of the resistance. We caution against 
this domineering, irresponsible and indifferent mentality. The 
authority and its men were busy with the 'Id al-Adha holiday 
while the enemy was violating security, sovereignty, and dignity. 
  Nasrallah said: The minimum of responsibility and dignity 
require this government and its prime minister to resign 
immediately. This is because the authority that dared to commit 
massacres against its civilian population on 13 September 1993 
now stands deadly silent before this Zionist terrorist act. 
This authority is not trustworthy and is not fit to govern a 
struggling, proud, and dear people, such as our Lebanese people. 
  He noted that "the clear shortcomings and negligence 
regarding the required measures have enabled the enemy to 
achieve gains he does not deserve at the expense of the Lebanese 
people and morale and at the expense of resistance achievements, 
which in the past few months have entered the final phase of 
dismantling and finishing off Lahd's army [South Lebanese Army]." 
  He warned that the confrontation is no longer restricted to 
a limited geographic area and that all the Lebanese territories 
are now vulnerable to Zionist violations and aggression. He 
said the resistance weapon is sacred wherever it may be and that 
the scope of resistance can stretch with the expansion of the 
area of aggression. "Therefore, the relaxed leaders must 
refrain from laying down restrictions, drawing limits, and 
specifying the area of resistance activity, because all this is 
a luxury and theoretical talk that has nothing to do with the 
reality of the challenge and suffering," he said, emphasizing 
that enhancing and protecting the resistance in the face of the 
Israeli profanity is one of the main prerequisites for 
establishing real national peace in this country. 
  Cautioning that the Gaza Agreement still gives the Zionist 
enemy an extra footing, Nasrallah called for serious action to 
thwart it and prepare for a new, massive revival against the 
Israeli schemes. He maintained that the kidnapping method was a 
new message with major implications. "It was targeted against 
the resistance, the homeland, the nation, domestic social peace, 
and the security of Lebanon and the region. Most probably the 
goal is far beyond what the enemy has announced regarding the 
search for information on the seized navigator. It even seeks 
political objectives within the Zionist entity," Nasrallah said. 
He stressed that the process of planning, reacting to, and 
dealing with that incident must be as big as the implications, 
the risks, and the objectives the enemy has attached to it. 
  Nasrallah concluded by saying: As long as the enemy has 
opted to expand the scope of confrontation, it must bear the 
responsibility for that decision, because the resistance 
fighters' and mujahidin response will come from where they 
expect and where they do not. Anyway, he said, the battle will 
be long. Victory will be ours and shame and destruction will be 
the share of the Zionist occupiers. 
  Nasrallah then answered correspondents' questions. He 
remarked that "local infiltration is possible" but that the 
issue "is sheer speculation." He explained that party elements 
have visited the target area and gathered information from the 
people. "The picture is taking final shape as far as we are 
concerned, if it has not already materialized." 
  He pointed out that the area was experiencing storming 
operations. "We were careful to avoid problems, because our 
policy is to facilitate the work of the authorities concerned. 
This atmosphere was used to achieve a better performance in 
that operation," he said. He revealed that gaps existed, 
denying the party's responsibility for them. "The Israeli 
operation could have been costly," he remarked, stressing the 
need for cooperation with the Lebanese Army and the Syrian 
forces to block these gaps. 
  Answering a question, Nasrallah said: We demand neither 
self-imposed nor relaxed security. What we want to say is that 
there should be cooperation and measures that enable the people 
to stand by the Lebanese state against any Israeli aggression. 
The resistance can live with social peace. It is even a 
prerequisite of that peace. 
  Nasrallah does not expect Israel to achieve what it wants 
from al-Dirani's kidnapping, because "Ron Arad's" issue has 
become like a riddle. "We dealt with the issue very seriously 
because it is part of a process that can help release all POW's 
and detainees in Israeli jails. Hajj Mustafa cooperated 
seriously with us. He knows the declared and circulated 
information on the issue to an extent, after which neither we 
nor him know anything of the issue. That is why I can swear 
that the Israelis will reach a dead end with him (Abu-'Ali 
al-Dirani)." 
  The Hizballah secretary general affirmed that the party has 
not ruled out a swap. "But we do not know the party holding 
Arad; we do not even know whether he is being held by a 
particular party. Besides, Israel rejects any solution involving 
a swap unless the Israeli navigator is involved in it," he said. 
He believes that "Arad's" issue might be a mere excuse to 
target the resistance and its leaders. He expressed surprise 
that the world is interested in this issue although it ignores 
hundreds of Lebanese and thousands of Palestinians who are being 
held in the occupation's prisons.

  [Excerpt] Army Commander General Emile Lahhud has stated 
that the army is opposing attempts by anyone to exploit the 
Israeli act of aggression in abducting resistance official 
Mustafa al-Dirani to harm the morale of the army and citizens or 
to circulate rumors to promote divisive stances that do nothing 
but cause harm. Everyone must view this issue with 
enlightenment, responsibility, and awareness. The enemy seeks 
to kindle sedition and cause confusion. Our response should not 
in any way jeopardize security. 
  In his monthly address in the army magazine, General Lahhud 
noted that temporary difficulties will not prevent the army from 
performing their duty to preserve national security and defend 
the south. Referring to the latest Israeli operation in 
al-Biqa', which resulted in the abduction of the resistance 
official, he said it was designed, among other things, to strike 
at our national morale and to create an atmosphere of fear and 
doubt. He said: What must be said is that we are still in 
conflict with the Israeli enemy because of their continued 
occupation of part of the south. As a result of the occupation, 
the enemy is suffering from continuous attacks despite their 
considerable resources. The enemy expand the scope of their 
aggression to boost their morale and to undermine our morale. We 
must prevent the enemy from achieving their goal by plugging the 
gaps created by their aggression. 
  He said: What is more important is that, as military 
personnel, we know that the army was vigilant from the first 
moment of the Israeli operation and tried to do its duty in 
coordination with the Syrian Arab forces. Patrols were 
operating in the area where the Israeli forces landed and tried 
to assess the situation before intervening. But several 
military considerations, such as the difficult terrain and 
routes and the failure to define the target fast enough, 
prevented the army from foiling the operation. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Muhammad Abu-Isbir from Ba'labakk] </F>
  [Excerpts] New information has emerged regarding the 
Israeli act of piracy represented by the abduction of al-Hajj 
Mustafa al-Dirani, one of the leaders of the Believers 
Resistance, from his home in Qasr Naba. The Israelis jammed the 
telecommunications networks in the area during the operation. 
An agent guided the two helicopters to their landing place on 
the al-Furzul-Niha hills at night. The Israeli soldiers doped 
Mustafa al-Dirani's family members so that they couldn't move or 
resist. Needle marks were found on their hands, legs, and necks. 
  Traces of blood were found a few meters from al-Dirani's 
house. It is believed an Israeli soldier was wounded during an 
exchange of fire. Israel has admitted that one Israeli officer 
was hurt during the operation. The Israelis opened fire from 
weapons equipped with silencers. The Israeli military jeeps 
stopped at a place called Wadi Shararah outside Qasr Naba. 
  The first to open fire on the Israeli force was 
'Abd-al-Karim 
al-Dirani (brother of captive Mustafa), who used a hunting rifle 
to fire on the Israeli soldiers. The Israelis used infrared 
night vision equipment. 
  The telephone line at al-Dirani's house was out of order for 
three days. The Israelis appear to have known about this 
because they did not cut the line. 
  Marks left by an axe were seen on a wooden door and there 
were three bullet marks on the outside wall of the second floor 
of the house. It seems the Israelis fired on the house to cover 
their withdrawal. 
  The israelis left behind a door-opening device, cassettes, 
al-Dirani's worry beads, and bandages, which, it seems, they 
dropped in the confusion after fire was opened on them. 
  Al-Hajj Mustafa al-Dirani returned to his house in Qasr Naba 
on the evening of Friday [20 May] to spend the 'Id al-Adha 
holiday with his family, relatives, and friends. This proves 
that his house was under surveillance by agents. Thus the 
circle of suspicion might narrow, possibly leading to the 
identification of the participants in the operation. [passage 
omitted] 
  Former Hizballah Secretary General Subhi al-Tufayil held a 
news conference at which he accused the Lebanese authorities of 
having prior knowledge of the operation and contributing to the 
handover of al-Hajj Mustafa al-Dirani to Israel. He said: The 
state is held responsible because it is responsible for the 
people's security and because it storms houses, arrests people, 
and sets up gallows. 
  He declared that the state, which cannot protect its 
citizens 
from the Zionist enemy, who came by helicopters and stayed five 
hours on the ground, has no right to knock on doors and storm 
citizens' homes. It has no right to say it is responsible for 
the country's security. 
  He called on citizens to use weapons against anyone who 
knocks on their door and storms their home, regardless of his 
alleged identity or uniform, because we are facing a situation 
in which we cannot differentiate between the Zionist enemy and 
others. Every citizen must defend himself. 
  Al-Tufayil said the Israeli operation was within the 
framework of the negotiations and part of the security 
normalization process between Lebanon and the Zionist entity. 
  He said the issue of Israeli pilot Ron Arad is a riddle 
[uhjiyyah]. He pointed out: According to my confirmed 
information, Iran has no connection with this issue. And 
Hizballah--of which I was secretary general--has no connection 
with this issue. I have heard that the other parties that might 
be holding the pilot have denied any connection with or 
knowledge of the issue. If the denial is correct, as is the 
case with Hizballah and Iran, the chances are that the Israeli 
pilot has died or was killed. Based on this premise, the issue 
is now a riddle. 
  Zakariya Hamzah, also known as Abu-Yahya, one of the leaders 
of the Believers Resistance, said: We have an account to settle 
with Israel. As Abu-'Ali al-Dirani was taken, he will return. 
Our concern now is to search for the threads that led the 
Israelis to brother Mustafa al-Dirani. We will cooperate to 
confront the ferocious Israeli enemy. After the assassination 
of 'Abbas al- Musawi, the quality operations against Israel 
increased. After the abduction of Abu-'Ali, we will confront 
Israel with quality operations. This is our style. We have an 
account outstanding with the Jews, outstanding since the time of 
Khaybar. The biggest account we will settle will be with the 
agents of the enemy. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Pakistan decided to submit a peace plan to Afghan 
leaders next week during the reopening of its mission in 
Afghanistan. This was stated by Foreign Minister Sardar Asif 
Ahmad Ali in Islamabad yesterday. He said the peace plan has 
been formulated on the basis of proposals by influential Afghan 
leaders, which provides a common basis for establishing peace in 
the war- ravaged country of Afghanistan. The foreign minister 
said that he will visit Kabul on 25 May for this purpose. He 
said that he held talks with Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Sa'ud 
al-Faysal, Crown Prince Turki, and leaders of other countries 
after receiving requests from Afghan leaders. He said that he 
held a similar exchange of views with UN Secretary General 
Butrus-Ghali to secure his assistance in establishing peace in 
Afghanistan. 
  Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali also announced that Pakistan will 
establish a mission in (Hayat) and a consulate in Mazar-e 
Sharif. This indicates the importance Pakistan attaches to 
these places, which link Pakistan with Central Asian countries.

  [Text] Karachi (APP) -- Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Saeed 
M. Khan said here on Sunday that India's hegemonic aspirations 
can only spell trouble for smaller states in the region. 
  Addressing student-officers of PN [Pakistan Navy] Staff 
College here, Admiral Saeed said India's interest in seeking 
naval cooperation with regional countries is aimed at allaying 
regional apprehension about its naval buildup on the one hand 
and isolating Pakistan in the region, on the other. 
  India is also trying to portray China as an "external" 
adversary to justify its naval expansion, now that it has 
retracted its opposition to US presence, he said. 
  The Naval Chief further said that Indian Navy is reportedly 
working on a programme for development of nuclear propulsion 
capability. Seen in the context of its nuclear capability and a 
comprehensive ballistic missiles programme this is ominous 
having profound and far-reaching implications for the entire 
region Admiral Saeed said. 
  He said, with the stoppage of US aid in 1990, the Pakistan 
Navy received a major setback when three PNC Orion Aircraft, 
which had been cleared for release, were withheld. Later, the 
US also insisted on the return of eight warships on expiry of 
their lease, Admiral Saeed added. He further said, despite all 
difficulties the country was on way to building a fairly modern 
and balanced fleet of a reasonable size. 
  Admiral Saeed said, the recently acquired type 21 Frigates 
after being updated, would adequately fill the gap created by 
the return of American ships. Pakistan Navy's submarines fitted 
with Harpoon Missiles can deliver powerful punch, but their 
numerical strength is below the required level. 
  About mine hunters, the Admiral said, Pakistan Navy's 
deficiency in mine countermeasures capability has been made up 
by the purchase of three modern mine hunters. 
  He said that in the present strategic scenario and in the 
face of continuing Indian naval expansion there is no choice but 
to consolidate our navy through self-reliance. He added, a long 
term programme has been placed before the government for 
building a series of surface ships at the Karachi Shipyard and 
Engineering Works (KSEW) in collaboration with a foreign Yard. 
Admiral Saeed said, this would be a major step forward which 
would also catalyses [as published] development in various 
industries in the country. 
  The Naval Chief said that the next few years are going to be 
crucial and to tax all our resources-financial, material and 
personnel. He added, if managed and harnessed well these 
resources will give the country the much needed maritime defence 
capability. 
  On his arrival earlier at the PN Staff College, Naval Chief 
Admiral Saeed M. Khan was received by the College Commandant, 
Commodore Serfraz Khan. 
  Flag Officers and other senior naval officers were also 
present on the occasion.

a plan to purchase aircraft from Central Asian states as its Air 
Force is in need of fighter planes expeditiously. India's 
stepped up war preparations have intensified this need. 
Although negotiations are under way for the purchase of French 
aircraft, it might take three to four years to give effect to 
the talks and the changes taking place at the international and 
regional level are so rapid that there is no room for any 
complacency in the country's defense matters. For quite some 
time, Pakistan has been steadfast in its policy to purchase more 
and more weapons from the United States and we have suffered its 
repercussions through the three wars forced on us. The program 
formulated by the present government by deviating from its 
traditional path to purchase aircraft for its Air Force from 
Central Asian States is an important step taken in the right 
direction and no effort should be spared to remove all the 
bottlenecks on its way.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Nuclear Program and the Prime Minister's </F>
Credibility"] 
  [Text] In an interview with the GULF NEWS, former Army 
Chief General Aslam Beg claimed that during the tenure of her 
previous government, Ms. Benazir Bhutto withheld research on the 
nuclear missile program. He added that despite that order, work 
on the manufacture of long-range nuclear missiles continued for 
one year until August 1991. Efforts were also made to acquire 
M-11 missiles from China. But they were not be successful at 
that time. Gen. Beg also explained that since the United 
States is trying to deprive Pakistan of a means to carry a 
nuclear warhead by suspending the supply of F-16's, the armed 
forces of Pakistan should give priority to the manufacture of 
missiles to carry warheads. According to Gen. Beg, research had 
been continuing until the end of his term despite Ms. Benazir 
Bhutto, in her capacity as the prime minister, banning it. 
  Gen. Beg's revelation requires the prime minister to take 
the 
nation into confidence and to explain why she issued orders 
against the production of missiles, which are so indispensable 
for the defense of the country and the nation. Earlier, Ms. 
Bhutto herself revealed that during her previous tenure of 
office she helped Rajiv Gandhi crush the Sikh freedom movement. 
Reports have also appeared now about Ms. Bhutto capping 
Pakistan's nuclear program during her previous term of office. 
These reports will definitely create doubts and apprehensions 
among the people about the credibility of Ms. Bhutto as a 
national leader and prime minister of Pakistan. Therefore, it is 
imperative upon Ms. Bhutto to make necessary clarifications on 
the television and try to remove doubts and misgivings. 
  The Pakistani nation is much more sensitive than India on 
defense matters and there is a national consensus that we must 
be equipped with a nuclear deterrent to protect ourselves from 
Indian aggression. The nation rejected the recent U.S. pressure 
and it is not ready to allow an inspection of its nuclear 
installations in exchange for F-16's. The government should not 
make any mistake in realizing the sentiments of the nation and 
the needs of the country. 
  The reports published the other day about the meeting of the 
troika -- the president, the prime minister, and the army chief 
-- in connection with the upcoming visit of President Farooq 
Leghari to the United States are not at all a matter of 
satisfaction for the nation. These reports said that the 
government formulated a policy of rejecting a unilateral roll 
back of the nuclear program. The fact is that Pakistan cannot 
roll back its nuclear program even bilaterally, let alone 
unilaterally. First of all, India will not agree to it. The 
second is that Pakistan is several times weaker than India even 
in terms of conventional forces and weapons. Therefore, progress 
in the nuclear field should be our only aim in order to ensure 
the security of our nation and the protection of our country's 
independence.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Ajay K. Roy, special correspondent of the </F>
NATIONAL HERALD] 
  [Text] The prime minister Mr. Narasimha Rao's week-long 
visit to the United States has turned out to be an unqualified 
diplomatic success and its impact on the economic front has been 
quite encouraging with no compromises made on India's consistent 
stand on (?contentious) issues like nuclear nonproliferation and 
human rights. The main objective of the visit was not to break 
new ground with regard to differences between the two countries 
on some issues, but to establish a relationship between Mr. Rao 
and President Bill Clinton, and that has been achieved in full 
measure. The two leaders after their summit meeting have struck 
a personal rapport and it would be now easier and more natural 
for them working together. 
  As senior officials from both sides said in Washington, they 
listened to each other to understand the differences in 
perspective. They established a basis to communicate on a number 
of issues which are now ongoing agenda. This one-to-one bond 
has alleviated the Indo-U.S. relations to an appropriate level 
of maturity which can withstand differences of perception of 
national interests. A good measure of such maturity was in 
evidence when president Bill Clinton, responding to a query at 
the joint press conference, candidly said I would not say 
differences between ourselves narrowed down, but I think they 
should be seen in the context of whole relationship. Equally 
mature is the attitude of the Prime Minister Mr. Rao toward 
bilateral relations. He told newsmen in Washington, as mature 
democracies we might differ on this or that issue, but such 
differences are subsumed in the overall understanding that 
characterizes our relationship. 
  Calling for new partnership in the joint communique of the 
summit, the two leaders decided to expand the scope and pace of 
high-level exchanges at the full range of political, commercial, 
technological, and social issues. Mr. Rao has started this by 
inviting President Clinton himself, which Mr. Clinton has 
accepted in principle. Visits at the level of vice presidents 
have also been planned. The first lady Mrs. Hillary Clinton is 
also likely to visit India. President Clinton himself has 
announced that the Commerce Secretary, Mr. Ronald Brown, will 
lead a presidential trade and investment mission to India in 
November and the Energy Secretary, Mrs. O'Leary, will visit in 
July this year. 
  A significant gain from the summit meeting is the signing of 
six Memorandums of Understanding [MOU] between the two 
countries. The first decision is to revive the Indo-U.S. Joint 
Commission set up in 1974. To begin with, its subcommission on 
economic and commercial issues would meet before the end of the 
year. Secondly, it was decided to establish regular official 
consultations at various levels alternatively in India and the 
U.S. This is the pattern followed by India with Germany, Japan, 
Britain, France, and some others. The third and most 
significant of the decisions was to review and update the 1984 
MOU on the transfer of high technology from the U.S. Since 
1987, when the U.S. started imposing sanctions against the 
Indian Space Research Organization, the MOU has been virtually 
defunct. Fourth, it was agreed to enhance defense cooperation 
at the civilian and service-to-service level. The U.S. defense 
secretary, Mr. William Perry, and the new U.S. 
commander-in-chief of the Pacific region would visit India some 
time this year. Fifth, it was decided to examine the possibility 
of setting up an eminent persons group of nonofficials to 
provide intellectual stimulus to bilateral ties. Lastly, a 
business partnership initiative would be set up, particularly on 
the subject of infrastructure development in India. 
  The high point of Mr. Rao's visit was his brilliant address 
to the joint session of the U.S. Congress wherein he displayed 
exemplary reasoning and fortitude in establishing the Indian 
viewpoint. In pursuing economic agenda during his visit, Mr. 
Rao had succeeded far beyond anything that had been anticipated. 
The captains of the U.S. multinationals during their 
interactions with Mr. Rao in New York, Houston, and Washington 
showed positive interest in specific areas. Above all, the two 
countries agreed on the goal of nuclear nonproliferation which 
has been hanging fire for quite some time now. Thus, now India 
and the U.S. have reached a stage where they could enter into 
constructive dialogue.

  [Text] The visits abroad of the Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. 
Narasimha Rao, have come to acquire an undefinable and ethereal 
air of unreality. Some months ago, he visited the UK ostensibly 
to witness the signing of an agreement guaranteeing to British 
investors certain safeguards against expropriation and the like 
which were nothing new and had been Government pollcy for years. 
No doubt, he met the British Prime Minister, Mr. John Major, 
and addressed businessmen and NRIs, but these are akin to the 
perks of a dignitary on official visit. Now, his U.S. visit 
leaves us wondering, much as little Peterkin was in Robert 
Southey's gem of a poem `Blenheim', `What good came of it at 
last?' Even those who supported Mr. Rao in his decision, taken 
braving the preponderant opinion in the country against the U.S. 
visit, must be asking the same que@tion. At least the old 
raconteur in the poem had the gumption to say, `That I cannot 
tell... But it was a famous victory.' Mr. Rao's vlsit was no 
famous victory; it fits no description other than being betwixt 
and between. 
  True to type, Mr. Rao's to-ing and fro-ing from Houston to 
Boston to Washington falls into a nebulous category, devoid of 
any sharp focus or sense of concrete achievement. He need not 
have gone half the way round the world to tell manufacturers and 
captains of industry what most of them must have, in any case, 
heard many times before. They must have been told, sometimes by 
the Prime Minister himself, during their probing mlsslons to 
Indla, that the reforms are irreversible, that India is the 
largest emerging market, that it is a good country to do 
business wlth and that any obstacles brought to notice would be 
swiftly attended to. Mr. Rao's address to the Harvard 
University audience cannot exactly be hailed as earth-shaking. 
The Memoranda of Understanding signed are of no such 
significance as to require the Prime Minister to lend the weight 
of his presence. The members of the delegation of Indian 
businessmen were all persons who knew their way about in the 
world and whether any particular bonanzas came their way by 
synchronising thelr travels wlth those of Mr. Rao is for them to 
declde. 
  Of course, when a Prime Minister officially visits a 
country, 
he gets his meed of courtesies and ceremonies. Mr. Rao made 
good use of the invitation coaxed out of the U.S. Congress to 
address it by buttressing his reiteratlon of India's known 
position on contentious issues wlth quotations and parallels in 
American hlstory. The reference to the U.S. Supreme Court 
judgement of Texas was particularly relishable and apposite. 
However, the US Congressmen and Senators are hard nuts to 
crack, and while graciously punctuating the speeches of 
distinguished visitors in their midst with applause and 
according them standing ovations, they still manage to keep 
their own counsel and go their own way. 
  And that leaves Mr. Rao's encounter with the U.S. President, 
Mr. Bill Clinton. For all the advance bllling it received as the 
grand climacteric of the visit, the outcome of the meeting seems 
to have turned out to be a let-down for both parties. That much 
was obvious from the body language of both of them at the joint 
press conference following their talks. And with Mr. Clinton's 
clear indication that there was no narrowing of differences 
between the two countries on issues on which the IJS had chosen 
to wield the big stick, the one event by which much store was 
set could only be said to have misfired. Indeed, it must have 
been painfully embarrassing both for the Prime Minister and 
those who watched the live telecast of the press conference that 
he stood forlorn at the lectern for a full half-an-hour, whlle 
the U.S. President was having a fun time answering questions on 
subjects that had nothing to do with the occasion. 
  So, what is there to show for the visit? Mr. Clinton's 
agreeing to keep an open mind on India's claims for a permanent 
seat on the UN Security Council? His promise of visits by the 
U.S. Defense and Commerce Secretaries to India in July and 
November? His accepting Mr. Rao's invitation to visit India 
himself? The indeterminate continuance of the dialogue for as 
long as it takes to arrive at a convergence? Judged with 
hard-headed horse sense, the cost-benefit ratio of Mr. Rao's 
visit looks like nothing to write home about.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Hopefully, A New Accomodation in India-U.S. </F>
Relations"] 
  [Text] One week ago, before he departed for the world's 
second largest democracy, few people could have predicted the 
outcome of the trip being undertaken by the Prime Minister of 
the largest democracy. While Cassandras predicted doom and 
disaster, more sober Opposition politicians mildly rebuked Mr PV 
Narasimha Rao for undertaking such a venture at this point of 
time. Precisely a week later, Mr Rao is returning home after 
his American sojourn to thunderous applause. By all accounts, 
this has been his most successful foreign trip--indeed, he has 
excelled himself, providing a glimpse of a determined elder 
statesman that nobody knew lurked behind his persona of a 
brooding and dithering politician. 
  Whether at the various meetings he had with American 
businessmen or in his fine speech to the U.S. Congress, Mr 
Narasimha Rao exhibited a confidence that reflected the 
indomitable spirit of India: He portrayed himself as the 
epitome of all that modern India stands for; he carried with him 
a message not from a Third World country but a developing 
economy which stands on the threshold of emerging as tomorrow's 
economic giant. Any residual images of India that may have 
lingered in the U.S. of the PL 480 days, were wiped away by the 
strength of conviction with which he spoke: He appealed without 
cringing; he beseeched without pleading; and, he demanded the 
attention that has been denied all these years of people who 
matter. Not surprisingly, at the end of the day, he has earned 
the respect and admiration of at least one section of American 
society-- the business community--which also happens to be 
extremely influential. 
  In fact, it can be said with a degree of certainty that the 
immediate effect of Mr Narasimha Rao's visit will be felt in the 
realm of trade and commerce between the two countries. If the 
response of American businessmen and industrialists to the Prime 
Minister's statements is any indication, then they can be 
expected to push aside all doubts that may still exist about the 
future of economic liberalisation in this country and invest in 
the Indian market. Therefore, before the year is over, the 
total amount of American investment in India could well be many 
times over the present level of $1.1 billion. This is, of 
course, a supposition that is dependent upon many variables, but 
it will be extremely surprising if there is no upsurge in 
American investment in the Indian economy. 
  However, no such certainty can be applied in the other 
crucial area of Indo-American relations. For, official U.S. 
Administration policy towards India will not necessarily be 
influenced by a single summit meeting and it will be incorrect 
to judge developments on this front on the basis of improved 
trade and investment. After all, while industrialists and 
businessmen have a narrow perspective and are goaded by the 
profit motive, politicians have to take into account larger 
issues and are prompted by imperatives that may be of little 
interest to the former. This difference is best exemplified by 
the fact that while American investors are loath to get bogged 
down with issues like human rights violations, the U.S. 
Administration cannnot but rake up such issues from time to time 
despite the negative fallout this invariably has on bilateral 
relations. If further elaboration is needed, it can be found in 
Sino-American relations. 
  But neither is there any reason to believe that official 
American policy will remain entirely unaffected and that White 
House will persist with the status quo. American business is 
known to have greatly influenced foreign policy in the past and 
it is more than likely that those who dream of multiplying their 
wealth with the help of the Indian market will be more than 
eager to bring about pressure on policy-makers not to upset the 
apple cart. To that extent, Mr Narasimha Rao has skilfully 
sought to win over American businessmen and industrialists, 
fully aware of the fact that at moments of crisis they can prove 
to be effective allies and protect India's interests. Even 
otherwise, despite persisting differences, a greater 
understanding of India's position can be expected on issues like 
nuclear nonproliferation, the missile programme and Kashmir. As 
much was evident from the tone and tenor of Mr Clinton's 
comments at the post-summit Press conference and those of 
officials later. 
  More importantly, Mr Narasimha Rao's trip has initiated a 
process that could yield rich dividends for India in the long 
run. For instance, the planned visits by high-level officials 
of the U.S. Administration over the next one year can only take 
the dialogue for constructive cooperation to its logical 
conclusion. No less important is the demonstrative value of 
such interaction: The message of joint Indo-U.S. military 
exercises, if they come about, to subcontinental countries 
inimical towards India cannot be overemphasised. However, one 
area that will continue to cause some amount of friction is 
American policy on Pakistan and its fallout on the 
sub-continent. Although Mr Clinton has stressed that the 
Kashmir issue has to be ultimately solved through bilateral 
negotiations, a point that has been reiterated in the communique 
(which interestingly validates the same Shimla Agreement that 
was not so long ago rubbished by the Assistant Secretary of 
State, Ms Robin Raphel), he has shown an ambivalent attitude 
towards Islamabad's role in sponsoring terrorism in the Valley. 
  Both Mr Narasimha Rao and Mr Clinton, one an elderly 
politician groomed in the Cold War era and the other a 
representative of the baby boomers' generation, have shown 
exemplary effort to check the downslide in relations between the 
two countries and start a new chapter that will be written over 
the next few years. Neither of them may be in office by the 
time the last line of this chapter is written, but hopefully 
their efforts will ensure that it ends on a happy note of mutual 
accommodation.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Practical Success"] </F>
  [Text] It is impractical to look for a spectacular outcome 
to the Rao-Clinton talks; this was not expected from Prime 
Minister Narasimha Rao's U.S. visit. There were already 
indications that no solution would be found to the differences 
between India and America, and it was not expected that India's 
standing would suddenly rise in the eyes of U.S. statesmen and 
businessmen. The only hope was that the summit meeting between 
India and America would produce a better understanding, which 
had been weak for a number of years. With this personal 
communication between the heads of government of the two 
countries, more businesslike ties might develop between India 
and America. Relations have previously been bogged down in a 
quagmire of bureaucratic language and prejudice. 
  From this point of view, Narasimha Rao's visit can be termed 
a success. In his joint news conference, the prime minister 
stated that the talks were "constructive, useful, and 
forthright." The forthrightness is reflected in the fact that 
both leaders agreed there are differences that still persist. 
India reiterated its stance regarding the NPT [Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty], human rights, and Kashmir, but America 
remained steadfast in its reasoning. The talks were useful in 
the sense that India could properly gauge U.S. priorities for 
the first time. For his part, the prime minister tried to 
emphasize not only that India is the largest democratic country 
with a potential to emerge as the greatest market in the world, 
but its humanitarian and pacifist concerns are no less than 
those of America. 
  The constructive nature of the talks will only become known 
in the future. The prime minister proposed that for the sake of 
a nuclear-free world there should be agreement on "no first 
strike" with nuclear weapons. He also agreed that a program of 
joint exercises between Indian and U.S. forces should be 
undertaken to safeguard South Asian and Pacific security. If 
these things are considered constructive, that is one matter; 
the true usefulness of the prime minister's visit was the 
possibility of heavy U.S. investment in India. How far 
Narasimha Rao succeeded in this regard will become known only 
after concrete results are achieved. 
  The prime minister's visit proved useful in one sense. Even 
though President Clinton declared India the biggest successful 
democracy and praised its contributions, this feeling was 
neither reflected in the U.S. media nor in the behavior of U.S. 
senators. The U.S. media ignored the prime minister's visit from 
the beginning, and when they did notice, they treated it as an 
insignificant event. U.S. statesmen were so indifferent toward 
the prime minister's address to a joint session of Congress that 
only three dozen members from both houses came to listen. 
Newspapers ignored the event completely. Most of the questions 
asked in the joint news conference were addressed to President 
Clinton, and many had no bearing on Indo-U.S. relations. This 
indifference came despite the fact that this was the first state 
visit by an Indian prime minister in many years; Rajiv Gandhi 
was the last prime minister to visit the United States. This 
attitude has nothing to do with the prime minister's success or 
failure, but the inherent fact that India is not a U.S. priority 
cannot be ignored. It is therefore easy to understand that in 
the present atmosphere we will not be able to carve the proper 
niche for ourselves in Western politics -- which move on the 
basis of power and prosperity -- by extolling goodwill and our 
cultural superiority. India is not considered great on the 
basis of population, natural resources, or democratic tradition. 
It will have to transfer these attributes into solid results. 
It is futile to repeat Jawaharlal's prophecy that the next 
century would be a U.S. century; we will have to find a strategy 
to make the next century belong to India.

  [Text] The Copyright (Second Amendment) Bill passed by 
Parliament earlier this month is the most stringent law to be 
ever passed anywhere in the world to check the growing cancer of 
video piracy gripping both developed and developing countries. 
  The bill has been welcomed as a serious attempt to give more 
teeth to the existing laws. Violation of copyright is a 
cognisable offence, but now punishment is sought to be made more 
severe. For the first time, Indian laws will provide for 
performers right covering any visual or accoustic presentation 
made live by performers, such as, actors, singers, dancers, 
acrobats etc. The performers consent is now required by making 
audio or audio-visual recording of the live performances and for 
communicating the performance to the public. 
  Another progressive feature of the bill is that it extends 
the copyright in sale and hire of computer programmes, 
cinematograph films and sound recording. This is in addition to 
all other rights available to other class of creative works such 
as reproduction, communication to the public, translation, 
adaptation etc. A provision has also been made for giving the 
authors of original copies of paintings, sculptures, drawings or 
original manuscripts, a right to a share in subsequent sales of 
copies on the resale price. 
  The Copyright Act hitherto provided only for recognition of 
Performing Rights Societies. The bill now provides for detailed 
provisions for recognition of copyright societies who are 
authorised to engage in collective administration of copyright 
for different classes of creative work. The bill provides for 
promotion of and encouragement of copyright societies for 
administration of the right of its members such as for issuing 
licences and collect licence fees, distribution of such fees 
among its members, etc. This will add to the economic strength 
and status of creative artists. 
  A large number of provisions in the amending bill are 
clarificatory of the terms used in the 1957 Act, e.g. computer 
programme is separately defined and it is clarified that knowing 
use of an infringing copy of a programme would be an offence 
under the Act and musical works are not required to be in the 
form of graphic notations as in the case of Western music, for 
the purpose of enjoying the copyright protection. 
  The legal experts say that special care has been taken in 
the 
bill to ensure that while an author or artist assigns copyright 
for exploitation the agreement should specify the royalty 
payable to the author or legal heirs during the period of 
protection. Similarly, the agreement should clearly spell out 
scope of rights transferred, the duration and the territorial 
extent. These are intended to protect the economic interests of 
the artists and authors. 
  Mr Lowell B. Strong, Vice-President and Director, 
Asia/Pacific Anti-Piracy unit of the Motion Picture Export 
Association of America, says that piracy of video films and 
other intellectual works is an international problem. He says 
it is a phenomenon of the eighties which ushered in a new 
technological era of cable satellite, telecommunications and 
video recorders. 
  With the increasing circulation of intellectual works among 
countries, the ramifications of piracy extend beyond national 
confines and are international in character, Mr Strong said, 
while describing the Indian bill as the "best" and "most 
progressive" copyright laws in the world. He says that the 
association will soon set up an office in Delhi to check piracy 
of Universal and Paramount films. These two American films 
companies have decided to provide in the country original video 
cassettes, through CIC, a Delhi based company. 
  Mr Pradip Chanda, Chief of CIC Video (India) says that the 
latest amendments -- the second major review since the first 
Indian Copyright Act came into effect in 1957 -- will enhance 
India's credibility in the international sphere because it gives 
an assurance to a foreign investor that fair business can be 
conducted in accordance with the declared policy of the 
Government of India. 
  Mr R. K. Jain, President of the National Bar Association, 
says problem in this country is not with the law but its 
enforcement. India does not have effective machinery to deal 
with violations of copyright laws. Police is not trained to 
deal with such kind of offences. Violation of the Copyright Act 
has always been a cognisable offence but since the provisions of 
the act are complex the police have seldom acted to enforce 
these provisions, says Mr Jain. 
  In order to deal with problem of enforcement, the Government 
has asked the States to explore the possibility of constituting 
special cells to check violations of copyright law. The 
official sources say that the formation of copyright enforcement 
cells would ensure the availability of a trained force that 
could prevent the violation of the law. 
  Mr Maxwell Peirera, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crimes), 
says whenever we receive genuine complaints and orders from the 
Court the police always conduct raids and register cases against 
those who violates the Copyright law. But, he says the problem 
is, people don't come with sufficient evidence and in absence of 
that it is very difficult for law enforcing agencies to act and 
take action. 
  The roots of the Copyright Act 1957 lie firmly embedded in 
the past when the Copyright law of British India was closely 
intertwined with that of Britain. It replaced the Indian 
Copyright Act of 1914, which made applicable to British India 
with additional modification, the Imperial Copyright Act, 1911. 
  Developments which occurred in this field in the 
international arena forced the pace of development of national 
copyright laws. The act does not break away from the past but 
renovates and builds a modern superstructure on the old 
foundation. For the first time, it established a Copyright 
office under the immediate control of the Registrar of 
Copyrights, a civil servant in charge of administrative matters 
pertaining to the act and provided for the maintenance of a 
Registrar of Copyrights. 
  The Act also introduced a quasi-judicial Copyright Board 
under the Chairmanship of a sitting or retired judge of the 
Supreme Court of India or of a High Court or of a person who is 
qualified to be appointed as a judge of the High Court and 
vested the Copyright Board with important power. 
  The original 1957 Act gave recognition for the first time to 
cinematograph films as a distinct class of work eligible for 
copyright protection and to a special right, called `broadcast 
reproduction right', in programmes broadcast by radio and 
television. It also recognised for the first time the `moral 
right of the author.'

  [Text] Russia will deliver the first of the seven 
cryogenic engines it is to supply to India in 1996. This was 
disclosed by the Russian first deputy foreign minister, Mr. 
Anatoliy Adamishin, in an interview to UNI TV during his visit 
to New Delhi recently. Mr. Adamishin, however, said under the 
terms of the recent agreement the technology for the cryogenic 
engines will not be transferred to India. He said India and 
Russia are likely to sign a comprehensive agreement on 
cooperation in the field of space technology during the 
forthcoming visit of the Indian prime minister to Russia. In 
reply to a question, Mr. Adamishin said Russia has been 
supplying spares for India's defense equipment. He said the two 
countries are discussing a proposal to set up joint ventures to 
manufacture military spares.

  [Text] Tehran, May 24, IRNA -- A Foreign Ministry spokesman 
said here today that the Islamic Republic regrets efforts being 
made to split up the unity of Islamic Yemen. He expressed hope 
that the officials in Yemen would try political solutions for 
safeguarding the accomplishments of the country. 
  Referring to the situation in the occupied land, he said 
Iran 
had previously warned against anti-Palestinian schemes. He 
cautioned that plots were underway to pit Palestinians against 
each other. 
  The spokesman said Islamic Iran warns against the plots 
being 
hatched by the Zionist occupiers. He said Iran yearns to see 
the Palestinians for ever united in their ranks. 
  Asked to comment on King Fahd's observation on the Persian 
Gulf islands of Iran, he said such remarks are aimed at 
strengthening the position of alien forces and weakening the 
Muslim people of the region. 
  These islands belong to the Islamic Republic and would 
continue to be so and calling them "Arab islands" would not 
change the reality in connection with those territories of the 
Islamic Republic. 
  The Iranian official commented that Fahd would obviously 
have 
done a lot better had he called on the Zionist regime to abide 
by international protocols and respect international conventions 
and refuse to engage in such acts of state terrorism as 
abduction which it did in Lebanon of a prominent leader just a 
few days ago.

  [Text] Tehran, May 25, IRNA -- The Persian daily 
`JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI' here Wednesday [25 May] in a political 
commentary, termed partition of Yemen as a treachery to people's 
ideals. The paper said that the declaration of the break up of 
Yemen's unification by the Aden government and formation of a 
5-man Presidential Council was as deplorable as the undesirable 
performance of Sanaa leaders in running the state during the 
past four years. 
  This has proven the inefficiency of the Yemeni leaders, the 
paper said adding that the leaders both in the north and the 
south are not concerned about the country and the nation. The 
article criticized the northerners for following a policy of 
taking vengeance on the statesmen of the south, and added that 
the very same policy led to injustice, discrimination, unjust 
distribution of power and overlooking solutions offered by the 
experts from south during these years. 
  The organized propaganda against the political and economic 
performance of the southern rulers and unjustified criticism of 
the dismissed southern statesmen as well as aggrandizing the 
image of the Sanaa regime, indeed, are the main causes of 
discord, dissatisfaction and hostility between the two, added 
the daily. 
  Not only these factors but the foreign instigations 
including 
the destructive and seditious role of the corrupt Saudi 
Government made the southerners to seek separation and partition 
just on the anniversary of the unification of the country, it 
said. The paper further argued that if the northerners did not 
follow a proper policy in the administraton of the country 
during the recent years, the southerners too were not 
trustworthy elements for the Yemeni people. 
  Therefore, said the article, if one day the Yemeni nation is 
given an opportunity to freely participate in a healthy 
elections, they would not vote for the present leaders of both 
parts of Yemen. 
  However, the paper argued, Yemenis have realized that the 
leaders of their country never took into consideration the 
national interests in their diplomacy and administration of the 
country but merely focused their attention on gaining absolute 
power. 
  The paper concluded saying that the Yemenis think that the 
prosperity and stability of their country are subject to the 
preservation of unification, national sovereignty and 
territorial integrity of their country.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] In response to the remarks made by Fahd, the shah of 
Arabia, on the Iranian islands of the Persian Gulf, the Islamic 
Republic Foreign Ministry announced: These islands are Iranian 
and will remain Iranian and nothing will alter this fact. 
  During a speech two days ago, while inviting the United 
States to show a greater and more active presence in the Middle 
East region, Fahd commented on Iran and its relations with the 
neighboring states, saying: Iran should observe international 
regulations and should return to the United Arab Emirates [UAE] 
the three islands in the southern sector of the Persian Gulf. 
  Saudi Arabia, in view of the role it assumes for itself 
among 
the tiny states of the Persian Gulf, has always tried to present 
itself as the leader of these states in the region by 
interfering in their affairs. Therefore, while the Islamic 
Republic is striving to remove the misunderstanding with the UAE 
on the basis of a bilateral agreement, Arabia by raising and 
exacerbating the issue is presenting itself as a claimant on 
this matter. Fahd's remarks have no legal base either. For 
Saudi Arabia is neither an acceptable source of arbitration with 
sufficient credibility to express an opinion on issues of other 
countries, nor should the head of state of a third country 
comment fundamentally on the territorial possessions of others. 
  If we were to analyze Fahd's comments as a whole, we would 
realize that he is raising these matters just to please those 
powers which benefit from creation of discord among the Islamic 
countries. This is a policy in line with America's policies and 
is implemented to isolate Iran in the region. 
  Iran, in accordance with its independent policies, is 
opposed 
to the course of compromise, is opposed to the expansion of the 
Zionist regime's presence, and is against the U.S. presence in 
the region. Whereas the United States, by leading the compromise 
course, is striving to open the gate of the Islamic countries to 
the Zionist regime and to strengthen the foundations of its own 
presence in the Middle East region. For the same reason the 
United States has always tried to isolate Iran in the region and 
to neutralize its role as a regional power.

<F P=106> [News conference by Majles Speaker 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri </F>
with domestic and foreign reporters in Tehran on 24 May -- 
recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Unidentified REUTER 
correspondent] Mr. Nateq, please tell us about the reports, 
which were also reflected in our Iranian newspapers, that 
high-ranking officials from the U.S. Government contacted Iran 
on the possibility of ascertaining common interests between Iran 
and the United States and about the importance of Iran's 
strategic role for the United States. Please tell us if such a 
thing happened or not. 
  [Nateq-Nuri] No, I have no news of any high-level contacts 
between Iran and the United States. Essentially the eminent 
leader has closed the door to contacts, negotiations, or 
relations with the Americans and he has graciously said that 
that path is a dead end. No one can do anything without his 
permission and that has not taken place. [passage omitted] 
  [Unidentified KEYHAN correspondent] In the name of God, the 
compassionate, the merciful. Mr. Nateq-Nuri, King Fahd has 
called for the handover of the Iranian islands to the United 
Arab Emirates [UAE] in a message on the occasion of the 'Id 
al-Adha. Although our country's authorities have expressly 
stated their view on the issue on numerous occasions we would 
like to know your views on this and King Fahd's new statements. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Nateq-Nuri] This is the issue: Regarding the islands -- the 
three islands of Abu Musa, the Greater and the Lesser Tonbs -- 
there is no problem at all regarding the Greater and Lesser Tonb 
Islands. Recently, when the Abu Musa issue was raised, our 
neighbors prefer to raise the issue of the three islands 
together now. We wonder what incident in recent years has 
caused our neighbors to think of that issue. We have an 
agreement from 1971 which was accepted by the ruler of 
al-Shariqah at that time on al-Shariqah television and confirmed 
by him. The agreement, I should say was about Abu Musa. The 
issue mainly concerned Abu Musa. Now they say one issue is not 
enough and they have added the other two to it as well, 
otherwise it would not amount to much. We have an agreement 
according to which Iran is there as well as al-Shariqah. There 
are some Arabs from al-Shariqah living there. We have acted 
according to that agreement up to now and we are still acting on 
it. Nothing new has happened. We have always said that an 
incident did occur. We saw a spy near there and apprehended him 
-- in the past two or three years -- then we enhanced the 
security factor there. Someone comes from the other end of the 
world in a boat, having put ammunition in hidden compartments in 
the boat, and begins sailing around Abu Musa, and when he is 
apprehended he says he came here to fish. Now what thinking 
person would accept that someone should come fishing with 
ammunition in the boat? 
  Well, we enhanced the security factor and as soon as we did 
that our neighbors' sensitivity was increased and they raised 
the issues of Abu Musa, the Greater and Lesser Tonbs. We have 
told them up to now, and truly believe, that the issue must be 
between us and the UAE. There is no problem. We have been and 
still are ready for negotiation. We sent delegations there. 
They should have come but they didn't. I did tell the Kuwaiti 
brothers who came here, the Qatari brothers who came here, that 
your problem is that when an issue arises in the region you fail 
to research it before making a decision on it. Because of the 
mere fact that one side is Arab and the other non-Arab, you 
convene the Persian Gulf Cooperation Council and your Arab 
prejudice blossoms. [passage omitted] 
  [ASAI correspondent, in English, followed by Persian 
translation] Mr. Speaker, I am a Japanese news correspondent. 
I have one question: relationship between Iran and Egypt. 
Foreign Minister Velayati will go soon to Cairo for NAM 
[Nonaligned Movement] meeting. Dr. Velayati will meet with 
Egyptian counterpart in that time for talking resuming two 
countries' relationship. Can we expect two countries will make 
good relationship in near future? 
  [Nateq-Nuri] We pay much attention to the NAM and regard it 
as valuable. Because we consider the NAM important we consider 
our presence there to be useful and effective. We consider the 
strengthening of the NAM to be a principle. The more it becomes 
strengthened the more its members will benefit. Therefore we 
believe participation in the session -- even though it is in 
Egypt -- to be appropriate, as you have pointed out. There is 
nothing to prevent the honorable foreign minister from seeking 
to talk with his counterparts or others on the sidelines of the 
gathering. But as to what the results of those discussions will 
be, perforce we must wait until he goes there and has those 
talks on the sidelines. He will then bring back his report to 
Iran so that we can see what we must do on the basis of that. 
  [Unidentified foreign correspondent] [passage omitted] There 
has been much talk about Iran's foreign debts in recent months. 
It has been a very hot topic. I would like to ask the 
president...[pauses] the Majles speaker about his views on this 
issue. In other words, what are the prospects for this matter, 
this debt? 
  [Nateq-Nuri] [passage omitted] The debt poses no particular 
problem for a country that has so many Godgiven resources, 
natural capital, power, and equipment. [passage omitted] Let 
me add a sentence that I personally believe that of course, 
regarding those very debts, if the state economic authorities 
had acted more meticulously and gracefully we would have had 
fewer problems. That point must be worth considering. 
  [Moderator] After a visit by a group of U.S. journalists and 
editors to Iran a hue and cry was begun about it in some of the 
press and that is when the group had meetings with Iranian 
authorities, including yourself. Taking into consideration the 
fact that on the whole the American people have no animosity 
toward us and -- reciprocally -- we have no animosity toward 
them, do you agree with the stances that were taken by the press? 
  [Nateq-Nuri] Everyone is responsible for his own actions, 
after all. A paper assumes a particular stance because its 
analysis and understanding of an issue is such. I also have 
read those stances in those papers. It was unclear to them who 
they were, what objectives they were pursuing, where they had 
come from, and who had invited them to Iran -- since that is not 
clear to us. Apparently the papers had agreed on a meeting with 
them somewhere and -- perhaps because of the same problems -- 
they later cancelled the meeting. Since it was clear to me -- 
and I was in contact with Mr. Kharrazi, our permanent envoy to 
the United Nations -- it was coordinated and what they were 
coming for was specified. They had been invited. Mr. Kharrazi 
pursued the affair. Consequently I had a session -- or, 
properly, an interview -- with them just like the one that I am 
having with you. They posed questions. I also believe that 
when correspondents come -- wherever they come from -- we will 
not lose anything. I myself told them how good it was that they 
had come because the U.S. Administration tells many lies about 
us. You should come here to see the issues, to hear them and 
then go back and tell the truth about things to the American 
people. If you are man enough, tell the truth. But do come. 
We have things to say, and we do not have any apprehensions 
either about their coming here to see Iran at close range. We 
have done many things that can be presented. As you noted, we 
really have no quarrel with the people of the United States. We 
believe their governments to be hegemonist and believe that they 
are being unkind even to the people of the United States 
themselves. I told the U.S. journalists that we have a friendly 
complaint against the people of the United States for allowing 
such governments to rule over them. [passage omitted]

  [Text] In continuation of the Ra'd-7 [Thunder-7] military 
exercise in the Darenjan region of Shiraz, the operations 
entered its fourth phase. During this exercise infantry units, 
an airborne division, and tank units crossed minefields and 
barbed wire with the support of the ground forces artillery and 
helicopters and the air force of the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
They captured various obstacles and dug canals. It is worth 
mentioning that after completion of this phase, the 
participating units were deployed in their defense positions.

  [Text] Tehran, May 25, IRNA -- South Africa is to open its 
embassy in Tehran soon, Nicou Nel, a South African official now 
visiting Tehran said here Wednesday. 
  Meeting with First Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammad Hashemi, 
Nicou Nel, director of the Middle East and North Africa [as 
received] at the South African Foreign Ministry expressed hope 
the foreign minister of South Africa could soon visit Tehran. 
  Referring to the major role that the Islamic Republic of 
Iran 
plays in the Persian Gulf and international community, Nel said 
officials of his country were for expansion of technical, 
industrial and trade relations with Iran. 
  Hashemi underlined Iran's readiness to expand ties with 
South 
Africa in various fields. 
  Iran severed its diplomatic relations with South Africa 
following the victory of the Islamic revolution in 1979. But 
Tehran and Pretoria have decided to resume relations following 
the abolition of racial segregation in South Africa.

<F P=106> [Report by Kianush Dorrani] </F>
  [Text] Qeshm, Iran, May 24 (AFP) -- Qeshm, a free-trade 
zone and largest island in the Persian Gulf, is seeking to 
attract foreign investment and become another eldorado like the 
emirate of Dubayy across the water. 
  With an area of 1,500 square kilometers (600 square miles), 
population of 60,000 and vast natural gas resources, the island 
off southern Iran aims to turn into a major industrial and 
offshore banking zone. 
  Qeshm "can compete with other free-trade zones in the region 
and serve as a center for trade with Central Asian countries," 
said the managing director of the zone, Behruz Bushehri. 
However, the authorities have failed to attract major foreign 
investment since the island on the Strait of Hormoz, through 
which one-fifth of the world's crude passes, was turned into a 
free-trade zone three years ago. 
  Western economic experts blame reluctance to invest in Qeshm 
on the lack of clear investment laws in Iran, saying the 
existing regulations do not provide adequate guarantees. 
Although officials on the island say potential foreign 
investors can sink up to 100 percent in a project, the Iranian 
constitution limits foreign ventures in Iran to 49 percent. 
  Bushehri acknowledged to journalists that foreign 
investments 
in Qeshm would "not be insured by the central bank," whose 
guarantee most potential investors have sought. Guarantees 
would come instead from the Organisation of Free-Trade Zones in 
Iran, which oversees Qeshm, Kish (also on the Gulf), Chah Bahar 
(on the Sea of Oman), Sirjan (in Kerman Province) and Bandar-e 
'Anzali (on the Caspian). Bushehri also confirmed that 
foreigners were not allowed to own land in free-trade zones. 
  After having been used as a platform for importing luxury 
goods over the past three years, Qeshm now seeks to help boost 
exports and serve as a financial center in the region and a base 
for offshore banks. 
  These ambitious projects could prove difficult on a 
sun-scorched island which up until recent years had been left 
abandoned. Except for a 108-room hotel under construction with 
Malaysian money, none of the joint-venture projects of the past 
three years have yet been launched, mainly due to lack of funds. 
Among the projects are a steel foundry with Japan's Kobe 
company, a power plant with Germany's Siemens, a cement factory 
with China and a fertilizer plant with India. 
  A Qeshm official, who declined to be identified, admitted 
any 
competition with the free-trade zone of Jabal 'Ali across the 
Gulf in Dubayy, United Arab Emirates [UAE], would be difficult. 
He pointed to "sizeable investments made there by multinational 
corporations, which all have the green light from the United 
States." Washington, which fell out with Tehran when the 1979 
Islamic revolution deposed the pro-Western shah, has imposed 
economic sanctions on Iran for its alleged support of terrorism. 
  The Qeshm authorities, however, are gradually developing the 
island, having joined it to the nationwide electricity grid and 
built hundreds of kilometers of paved roads over the last two 
years. Work has also begun on the construction of an 
international airport, although plans to build a 2.5-kilometer 
(1.5-mile) road and railway bridge to connect the island to the 
mainland are still on the drawing board. A project to build a 
deep-water port to cater for big ships has also failed to make 
headway. 
  But while the authorities await foreign investments and 
economic prosperity for the island, the people of Qeshm are 
casting their eyes across the Gulf at Dubayy, the eldorado of 
the region. The port city in the UAE is the main source of 
smuggled goods entering Iran.

  [Text] Tehran, May 26, IRNA -- A morning English daily here 
Thursday [26 May] commented on the recent decision by the 
government to control prices and said that pricing policy might 
serve as a "tranquilizer" but it will not ultimately be a cure 
or a remedy. 
  The `TEHRAN TIMES' in its editorial expressed pessimism over 
the new policy which was launched to curb the inordinate price 
hikes and ease down the existing economic pressures faced by the 
consumers. 
  The paper referred to the incompatibility with economic 
liberalization and with the supply-demand trend, its requirement 
to a monitoring body which is in conflict with the policy for 
manpower adjustment and its insufficiency for the commodities 
whose prices were perpetually undergoing changes as some of the 
disadvantages of the policy. 
  Without a tinge [of] doubt, the paper said, such a policy 
will not slash or stabilize the prices. To the contrary, it 
will cause a qualitative and quantitative slump in production, 
it added. 
  The article noted in conclusion that the officials should 
reduce inflation rates and curb price hikes by "opening up 
avenues to promote economy and production and ultimately to 
warrant economic prosperity."

  [Text] Tehran, May 23, IRNA -- A senior official at the 
National Iranian Oil Company [NIOC] said that the oil price 
increase of the past few weeks is a result of temporary 
difficulties and optimistic prospects for the rest of the year 
seem faint. 
  Head of the company's international relations Ghanimifar 
Mohabat Ghanimifar, in an interview with the English daily 
`TEHRAN TIMES' which appeared Monday, noted that OPEC and 
non-OPEC members have cooperated closely in order to stabilize 
prices so that neither producers nor consumers incur losses. 
The extreme winter conditions in the northern hemisphere have 
lowered oil reserves in industrial nations of the west including 
the United States, he added. Since many western countries are 
slowly recovering from recession and economies seem to be 
speedily improving, the demand for oil is bound to increase, 
Ghanimifar remarked. "Furthermore", he said "OPEC countries 
have been producing according to agreed-upon quotas during the 
past few months, as a result of which markets have not been 
flooded with supplies". 
  The approach of Saudi Arabia and Iran after certain OPEC 
sessions has been constructive and had definitely contributed to 
price increases in international markets, he continued. 
  Referring to fighting in Yemen, political unrest in Nigeria 
and low North Sea reserves as elements affecting the market, 
Ghanimifar said that the stock market speculations and share 
sales may have been another reason for the price hike. Consumer 
countries are worried that the agreement reached between OPEC 
and non-OPEC producers could result in producers' monopolizing 
the market which was rejected by Ghanimifar. He also mentioned 
that in the very near future, Iraq will once again be able to 
sell oil and saturate the market at which point greater 
cooperation on adjusting and staying within quotas will be 
needed. 
  He concluded by suggesting that cooperation between the oil 
producers should be initiated long before the market begins to 
dictate its terms on prices.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "In the Margin of the President's Remarks"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Even though the president's remarks to 
journalists and authors were very timely and appropriate, 
nevertheless parts of them were disappointing. [passage omitted] 
  The president referred to two confidential reports in his 
remarks. One was about the discovery of "bugging" devices at 
the Iranian Embassy in London and the other about foreign debts. 
  If he had considered the press to be trustworthy, the best 
thing to do would have been to call in the press and explain 
things. His reference to coordination with Western countries 
should be viewed within this context. In other words, all the 
lie disseminators and mass media in the West know everything, 
while no one in Iran does. 
  Our press always gets its major news from others, so the 
press has no alternative but to refer to foreign news and mass 
media among its other news sources. If the officials of the 
country are not aware of this, then they should be; and if they 
are aware of this and still do not give information to the 
press, then they should expect such reactions. 
  The president also said coordination of some of the items 
published in our press with foreign radios that later reported 
them was negative in value. It is all right if the foreign 
press cites millions of words uttered by our officials, but when 
one sentence that we write is cited by a foreign publication or 
mass media -- and possibly by the counterrevolution -- this is 
considered to be coordination and cooperation with the 
counterrevolution. 
  More important still, should the press, which complains 
about 
high prices and inflation, be subsidized? Does this not 
actually mean that if the press is able to overcome its 
problems, it will cease to report about high prices and 
inflation? If this ever happens, then the press will distance 
itself from the people and the people will sever their links 
with the press because they will clearly realize that since it 
is subsidized, the press will no longer protest against high 
prices and the absence of correct economic planning. 
  Has the press not carried numerous articles about economic 
issues? Has anyone read these articles? Or have these economic 
views been buried in politicking? As many economic articles 
have been published over the past four years as in the whole 
previous history of Iran. But who listens to such analyses? 
Unfortunately it is apparent that some of the economic analyses 
have been completely ignored simply because they would have 
benefited the opposing faction. 
  Theories on how to increase the strength of the national 
currency have been put forward. But unfortunately the Central 
Bank, which should undertake this task, has itself become a 
major factor in devaluing the national currency. 
  As for the esteemed president's remarks that each 
publication 
should become an economic analyst and study the situation, this 
has been done. But it has not yielded any results. Of course 
it is hoped that gradually, when the problems of some of the 
theories are clarified, there will at least be a willingness to 
accept criticism. And this might help us to turn away from the 
wrong path that is being tread and to chose the correct 
path--even if only for the sake of the people.

  [Text] Arak (Central Province), May 25, IRNA -- IRNA 
Director Fereydoun Verdinejad said here today that the main task 
of the Iranian journalists is to introduce the real nature of 
the Islamic Republic system. 
  Speaking at the inaugural ceremony of the IRNA satellite 
system, and the new building of IRNA bureau here, he said that 
the enemies of Islam were attempting to misportray the Islamic 
Republic in the eyes of the world people. 
  "The arrogance media circulate only a selection of the 
Iranian news in line with their political objectives," he said. 
  Meanwhile, Mohammad Reza Sadeq, in charge of the expansion 
of 
the IRNA local centers, said that the new 350-sq.-meter building 
had been constructed on 1,118 sq. meters of land at a cost of 
Rls. 125 million.

  [Text] Baghdad, 26 May (INA) -- An official spokesman today 
accused some U.S. circles and the Jewish lobby in Washington of 
trying to mislead the U.S. Congress and to hide the causes of 
the mysterious illness that has afflicted thousands of U.S. and 
British soldiers that fought in in the Gulf war. 
  Commenting on the report presented to the U.S. Congress by 
Senator Donald Riegle alleging that the Iraqis used chemical 
weapons against the U.S. forces during the Gulf war, the 
spokesman said: Medical circles throughout the world can easily 
diagnose chemical weapons injuries, therefore, it is illogical 
that U.S. medical circles, which are known for their scientific 
and technological progress, have failed to diagnose the cause of 
this illness. 
  He said: The political pressure groups in the Congress seem 
to have decided to exploit this case to realize political 
objectives against Iraq. 
  The spokesman added: Senator Donald Riegle's report consists 
of a host of personal testimonies by soldiers, and is not a 
technical and scientific report. This report conflicts with 
what had been announced by Senator John Rockefeller, head of the 
committee that investigated this issue. Rockefeller said that 
his committee had carried out research into this mysterious 
illness for six months, and the results showed that the U.S. 
Defense Department had used for its soldiers medicines that were 
still being tested. These medicines include vaccines and pills 
that are still in the research stage. 
  Senator George Mitchell, leader of the Democratic majority, 
demanded that an investigation be carried out by the U.S. 
Defense department and concerned quarters. There was also 
another reason for this illness, which the U.S. Administration 
is trying to hide: that is, the extensive use of munitions that 
contain depleted uranium. Preliminary investigations, that were 
suppressed by the U.S. Defense Department, showed that the U.S. 
soldiers had not been warned against exposure to this radiation, 
and had not been trained to avoid radiation from such munitions.

  [Text] Yasir 'Arafat is to arrive on the 12th of next 
month for a three-day visit to Jericho and Gaza. A message to 
this effect has been relayed by 'Arafat's advisers to the 
Israeli Government. Our correspondent notes that 'Arafat 
postponed his visit by one week due to Israel's demand that he 
give at least two weeks advance notice of his arrival. 
  According to Palestinian sources, Israel is not allowing 
'Arafat to visit East Jerusalem and the Temple Mount. During 
his visit in Jericho 'Arafat will meet U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher, who is scheduled to return to our region.

Shlomi Eldar reports that a Palestinian policeman stopped Gen. 
Almog near Netzarim and told him to go back from where he came 
or he would shoot at the wheels of Almog's vehicle. The general

After talking to the Palestinian policeman, al-Atrash informed

  Mr. Khalifah told reporters upon arrival at Khartoum airport 
that the current round of talks was designed to discuss basic 
issues of the conflict, but the delay by three days of the 
arrival of the rebel factions prevented a detailed examination 
of these issues. [passage omitted] Mr. Khalifah stressed the 
need for contacts to continue between the government and the 
rebel movement, as that is the way to consolidate confidence 
between the two sides. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Discussion between studio anchor Tamar Landau and political </F>
correspondent Udi Segal at Tel Aviv University -- live] 
  [Text] [Landau] A legal opinion presented to Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin today stipulates that if there is a grave 
violation of the accord with the PLO, the agreement is null and 
void. If relatively minor violations occur, Israel may impose 
sanctions such as closing off the Autonomy areas and canceling 
the safe passages from Gaza to Jericho. Udi Segal has more 
details: 
  [Segal] Senior security officials said today they believe 
that the Palestinian authority wishes to prove it is able to 
control the territory and -- according to estimates by the 
Palestinian police -- if it wanted to, it could foil many terror 
acts. At the same time, the senior security sources made clear 
that if the Palestinians fail to provide security, Israel will 
have to do this itself. The remarks were made to reporters in a 
meeting with the media to explain the various aspects of the 
Gaza and Jericho agreement. On the one hand, the sources 
present a positive picture: We have a partner for dialogue, 
they say. The activists in the field show that they seriously 
mean to implement the agreement and prove their ability to do 
so. For example, the police units that arrived in Gaza show 
certain control abilities, and even their spic and span uniform 
shows a degree of authority and seriousness. 
  On the other hand, we heard a long and detailed briefing 
about the difficulties that outnumber the positive aspects. The 
sources mainly referred to the fact that there is no money on 
the ground, not even for salaries and so called everyday 
management. There is a shortage of food, gasoline, and other 
basics of logistic support means are lacking in both the 
activities of the Palestinian police and the civilian offices 
which were handed over to local directors. In the meantime, 
until 'Arafat appoints the Palestinian authority, there is no 
one to run the area. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1400 GMT on 25 May 
carries a similar report adding: "Our correspondent Shlomo Raz 
reports that in a meeting with correspondents, the sources said 
PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat has to change his decisionmaking 
process, otherwise shock waves can be expected in the 
organization's leadership. They said they do not believe him, 
but added that if they had to negotiate with the local 
leadership in the territories, things would have been much 
harder."] 
  Speaking before students today, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin 
said that although the policemen are not receiving salaries, 
their performance is better than we had expected. They still do 
not fully understand their responsibilities or active duties, 
but we have a partner there. Some policemen there have been out 
of Gaza for the past 20 years, but their attitude is positive. 
Rabin then added: I am not referring to their chief chatterer, 
meaning 'Arafat. 
  Rabin addressed himself to 'Arafat's decree yesterday 
canceling military orders, saying violation or not, this is 
nonsense. His remarks are meaningless. 
  A legal opinion presented here today states that if the PLO 
significantly breaches [hafara mashma'utit] the agreement with 
Israel, the agreement would be null and void or, alternatively, 
Israel may announce it is suspending the agreement for as long 
as it wants. 
  [Landau] Does this condition apply to a reverse hypothetical 
situation in which Israel violates the agreement in some way? 
What is a gross violation [hafara hamura]? 
  [Segal] A gross violation means a breach of a clause without 
the existence of which the offended party would not have signed 
the agreement to begin with. That is to say that there may be 
insignificant violations of the agreement which, according to 
international law, apply to both parties. 'Arafat's acts over 
the past several days constitute insignificant violations of the 
agreement. According to international law, Israel may legally 
make a reciprocal violation that would equal the first 
violation. For example, Israel may make take such steps as 
banning the Palestinian residents of the Gaza Strip and Jericho 
from entering Israel; canceling the safe passages of 
Palestinians between Gaza and Jericho; avoid employing laborers 
in Israel; close the air space; or many other steps. 
  In the meeting, official analysts spoke about three tests 
'Arafat must face now: Providing the Palestinians with security 
-- that is the test of control. The need to unify enough 
Palestinian bodies to run daily life -- that is, making the 
civilian system, that is not yet working well, operational. The 
third, which is a precondition for the other two, is the ability 
to work with budgets, meaning collecting funds from two sources: 
taxes, and the sources doubt that they will be able to collect 
taxes at this time; and the international community which so far 
has not shown that it is willing to finance the autonomy's 
everyday life. 
  All the security officials who spoke here today said that it 
is too early to unequivocally determine whether the agreement is 
working or not. After all, these are the initial days. It will 
take a few more weeks before we are able to judge what is really 
happening in Tunis, Gaza, and Jericho. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1505 GMT carries a 
similar report by Shlomo Raz adding that in his meeting with 
reporters today, Prime Minister Rabin said that "he is worried 
that Jericho might become a focus of sharp confrontation, unless 
the orders of the Central Command commander are strictly 
observed." Rabin further said that the Israelis involved in the 
incidents yesterday "were not exactly naive." Rabin said that 
Kibbutz Netzarim in the Gaza Strip was evacuated by the 
Religious Kibbutz Movement "in a big rush, and they even asked 
for 3 million shekels, and received the money." The place was 
later inhabited by Gush Emunim activists, but "if this is a real 
settlement, I'll be damned." Raz goes on to say that "in his 
address today, Rabin elaborated on his expectations from the 
agreement with the PLO. Anyone who portrays the agreement of 
principles as peace is wrong. It is a major step toward peace, 
but it is not peace." "'Arafat lacks experience in the conduct 
of a community's everyday life or in managing budgets, and he 
has no desire to do so, Rabin stressed. The Palestinian 
policemen are already suffering from this: they have no 
salaries, food, or logistics syupport for their activities. At 
the same time, Rabin pointed out, their attitude so far has been 
positive. It is also positive that the policemen came from 
Iraq, Sudan, and Algiers and did not experience the intifadah, 
thus they do not feel hatred toward us as the Palestinians in 
the territories do."]

  [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, who is visiting the 
United States, told our correspondent Arye Golan that 'Arafat is 
facing severe pressure from the Palestinian peace opponents, 
which can perhaps explain his remarks regarding the Quraish 
Tribe and the cancellation of the Israeli laws in the autonomy. 
  [Begin recording] [Peres] 'Arafat has no legislative 
authority and no authority to cancel existing laws. So things 
are published in the newspapers, I would prefer the newspaper 
reports to also agree with the spirit of the Declaration of 
Principles. 
  [Golan] What can we learn about 'Arafat and his behavior 
from this? 
  [Peres] I am not a psychologist, and I do not think I should 
comment on the person himself. I can only tell you what he told 
me, namely, that he is facing a very strong opposition and that 
he is struggling to implement his policy. He told me, for 
example, that the entire Johannesburg mosque affair transpired 
during a heated argument with the Iranians, who accused him of 
proceeding with Israel while the latter is violating the 
agreement. 'Arafat claims he said that if Israel violates the 
agreement he will violate it himself, just as Muhammad violated 
the agreement after the Quraish Tribe violated it. 
  I do not want, however, to serve as 'Arafat's advocate, it 
is 
not my duty. I also do not want to hand out grades. I am 
conducting negotiations rather than dealing with graphological 
analysis or psychoanalysis. [end recording]

  [Text] Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali has said 
Pakistan and the United States are entering a new phase of their 
relationship. Inaugurating a seminar on Pakistan's Foreign 
Policy Achievements in Islamabad today, the foreign minister 
said Pakistan-U.S. relations were marred due to the unjust 
Pressler Amendment. Both Pakistan and the United States have 
recognized Pressler Amendment as a bad law. He said the United 
States is not attempting to roll back Pakistan's nuclear program 
on a unilateral basis. Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali said soon after 
the assumption of office, the prime minister, Ms. Benazir 
Bhutto, embarked upon a program to end Pakistan's diplomatic 
isolation. She undertook measures to restore Pakistan's image 
as a modern, democratic, and forward-looking state committed to 
promotion and protection of human rights and desirous of 
building tension-free relations with all countries, especially 
its neighbors.

  [Text] The prime minister said that the government will go 
all out to promote private investment in the power sector so 
that scarce resources are available for the social sector. He 
said many rules and regulations inhibiting private investment in 
the power sector have been removed in the last two years and the 
government is ready to further simplify the rules. Mr. 
Narasimha Rao was inaugurating a conference in New Delhi today 
titled India Power 94 on the development and financing of 
private sector power projects. He said the government is fully 
alive to the key role that power generation can play in the 
country's industrial growth. He urged the power sector to reach 
out to the people in the far-flung areas. 
  Earlier, in his keynote address, the power minister, Mr. 
N.K.P. Salve, said the center is awaiting the findings of the 
Sharad Pawar Committee on the working of state electricity 
boards. He said the two-tier price mechanism for the private 
power sector is proving highly encouraging.

<F P=106> [Interview with French jurist (Jean Marc Vareau) by Eldad </F>
Beck in Paris; date not given -- recorded, in French with Hebrew 
subtitles; translated from the Hebrew] 
  [Text] PLO Chief Yasir 'Arafat has launched an effort to 
arrange the drafting of a Palestinian constitution. The Channel 
2 news department has learned that to that end, he conveyed a 
draft document for the perusal of a French lawyer. According to 
the document, Jerusalem is the capital of an independent 
Palestine. Our Paris-based correspondent Eldad Beck heard the 
details of the constitution from the French jurist: 
  [Begin recording] [(Vareau)] He assured me that he would 
honor human rights; that the provisional constitution would 
ensure the separation of powers, the independence of legal 
institutions; that it will not be an Islamic state; that there 
would be genuine equality between men and women, between Muslims 
and non-Muslims; that Christians and Israelis would enjoy 
freedom of worship and education. At that point, to prove to me 
that it would be a state of law, he handed me something that had 
just been prepared -- a proposal for a transitional constitution 
to be used before the state is fully sovereign. 
  [Beck] Then 'Arafat plainly told you that this text would be 
the Palestinian state's constitution? 
  [(Vareau)] We agreed that since they have physical authority 
over a defined territory, since they rightfully control a 
legitimate police force, and since they have the right to pass 
their own laws, they are practically a sovereign state. That 
text plainly indicates that Jerusalem is the capital of 
Palestine, but the Palestinian government that will be elected, 
that will be appointed before parliament is convened, will be 
able to decide on a capital in another location in Palestine. 
Thus Jerusalem will be a constitutional demand, while the 
actual capital will be either Gaza or Jericho. [end recording] 
  [An announcer-read report later in the newscast adds: "In 
reaction to the report about 'Arafat's plan to draft a 
constitution for the Palestinian state, Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin said a few minutes ago: `It is all talk, just like the 
radio program.'"]

  [Text] In wake of recent reports about the possibility of 
starting to collect weapons from Palestinians in the autonomy 
areas soon, Fatah Central Committee Member 'Abas Zaki said 
during a dialogue with the press in Damascus today that the 
Palestinian command has not yet made a decision to collect 
weapons from the Palestinians in the autonomy areas, especially 
since there is an armed enemy and weapons are in the hands of 
the settlers. 
  Zaki said a PLO delegation will visit Damascus for talks 
with 
the Syrian officials and the Palestinian opposition. However, 
he did not say when the visit will take place. 
  Zaki, a moderate opposer of the Palestinian-Israeli 
agreement, arrived in Damascus yesterday and held talks today 
with Nayif Hawatimah, secretary general of the Democratic Front 
for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP], and will also meet with 
George Habash, the secretary general of the Popular Front for 
the Liberation of Palestine, and Ahmad Jibril, secretary general 
of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General 
Command. 
  After meeting Zaki today, Hawatimah said the DFLP and all 
the 
other nationalist and democratic forces will pursue the struggle 
against the occupation and against the settlers who carry 
120,000 weapons. Hawatimah said: That's why we rejected all 
calls seeking to disarm the sons of the intifada. Hawatimah 
warned the Palestinian police against crossing the red lines.

the Hamas Islamic movement to discuss the prospects of their 
participation in the Palestinian National Authority Council. 
  In a statement today, Ghawshah said that the council 
discussed at its preliminary meeting last night the working 
program of the authority and the basics of its responsibilities. 
  Ghawshah added that the council also discussed the progress 
made so far in Gaza and Jericho and the tasks the council should 
undertake quickly in the autonomy area. 
  Ghawshah said that Dr. Hanan 'Ashrawi, member of the 
Palestinian National Authority Council, submitted a working 
paper on the formation of the authority and its tasks, although 
she had earlier announced her refusal to take part in the 
council. 
  Dr. Ghawshah said that 'Arafat has decided to appoint Dr. 
'Abd-al-Hafiz al-Ashhab, an independent democrat from Hebron in 
the occupied West Bank, as a member of the council. He will be 
the 19th member in the 25-member council. 
  Once the working program is discussed, the remaining six 
members of the council will be appointed, the ministerial 
portfolios distributed, and the council members will take the 
constitutional oath, Ghawshah said. 
  He expects 'Arafat and the Palestinian leaders to enter 
Jericho before 5 June, unless unexpected developments occur. He 
added that the council will hold its first official meeting 
today after the members residing abroad arrive. 
  Last night's meeting was attended by Faruq Qaddumi, head of 
the PLO Political Department; Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas], PLO 
Executive Committee member; and Salim al-Za'nun, alias 
Abu-al-Adib, acting chairman of the Palestine National Council. 
These three are not members of the Palestinian National 
Authority Council.

  [Text] The Palestinians have announced that they do not 
intend to induct into the police force Fatah Hawks and wanted 
men who are not sanctioned by Israel. Our Army affairs 
correspondent Karmela Menashe reports that Brigadier General 
Yom-Tov Sami', the liaison with the Palestinians, sought to 
check reports that Uri Magidish's assassins had been inducted 
into the Palestinian police. He was told that Fatah Hawks had 
been concentrated in a classification camp, and that those who 
are found to be qualified to be policemen would be inducted only 
after Israel approves it. 
  Meanwhile, it has been learned that the policeman who banned 
Brig. Gen. Doron Almog from traveling freely on roads in the 
Gaza Strip has been brought to trial and sent to jail. IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces] sources this morning expressed 
satisfaction about the way Palestinian police roadblocks 
checking Palestinians at the border crossings with Israel have 
been working.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Ahmad Quray', member of the </F>
Palestinian National Authority, in Tunis, by Sa'id Mu'addi in 
the studio; date not given; from the "With the Events" program 
-- recorded] 
  [Text] [Mu'addi] Mr. Ahmad Quray', Abu-al-'Ala', member 
of the Palestinian Authority, good evening: 
  [Quray'] Good evening. 
  [Mu'addi] Mr. Abu-al-'Ala', when will the Palestinian 
National Authority meet? What is on the agenda? 
  [Quray'] Meetings started yesterday. Meetings will discuss 
a big agenda to fill all vacancies in administrations and 
distribute missions and responsibilities to members of the 
Palestinian National Authority. Meetings will discuss the 
setting up of a bureau for auditing and financial and 
administrative supervision, to coincide with the start of the 
work of this authority, and to underline the principle of 
accountability and openness to the masses of our people. Also, 
the agenda includes the subject of following up the negotiations 
and setting up the committee charged with following up 
negotiations in the civil, security, and economic fields. All 
these issues have been addressed. Discussion will continue 
today. The meetings' agenda includes setting a date for the 
return of the Palestinian leadership and the members of the 
Palestinian National Authority to Gaza and Jericho. 
  [Mu'addi] When will Yasir 'Arafat arrive in Gaza, or 
Jericho? 
  [Quray'] Brother President Yasir 'Arafat will soon arrive at 
the head of the Palestinian National Authority. 
  [Mu'addi] Mr. Abu-al-'Ala', have all members of the 
Palestinian National Authority been appointed? 
  [Quray'] Almost. The number appointed is enough to assume 
all responsibilities and tasks. There will be consideration of 
some brothers. We think these names will be complete soon. 
  [Mu'addi] How many members have been appointed thus far? 
  [Quray'] Around 18 people have been appointed thus far. 
  [Mu'addi] Mr. Abu-al-'Ala', many challenges are facing the 
new Palestinian Authority. What are the priorities? 
  [Quray'] Two issues constitute the principal challenges to 
our people. A third issue constitutes the major challenge 
regarding Israel. With our people, we are required to achieve 
security in a democratic, healthy, and sound atmosphere in order 
to provide the stability needed for development. The second 
challenge is to create job opportunities, and the economic 
development projects that can provide job opportunities and 
achieve the prosperity our people seek. These are two issues we 
must tackle for the sake of our people. The third issue 
concerns completing the preparations for the negotiations for 
the next phases, since the agreement stipulates phases and 
gradual action, and so we can complete one phase and move to the 
next after we have established ourselves in a correct and sound 
way and created some confidence with the other party. 
  [Mu'addi] Mr. Abu-al-'Ala', the Palestinian Authority will, 
as of next month, start dispensing the wages of the employees in 
Gaza and Jericho and the wages of the members of the Palestinian 
police. Do you have any money in the coffers? 
  [Quray'] In fact, the coffers are still at the hands of the 
Civil Administration and the Israeli Government and the Israeli 
Finance Ministry. The money has not been received by the 
Palestinian National Authority. This is undoubtedly an Israeli 
responsibility, and also a responsibility of the world and the 
World Bank. This authority should not be dealt with in 
accordance with the old Arab proverb: He threw him in the water 
and then told him, careful, careful, do not get wet. This 
authority has major and difficult responsibilities. It is the 
responsibility of the world community to help it. It is 
Israel's responsibility to fulfill its commitments. The dues 
remaining from the taxes and tariffs, as well as other old dues, 
must be transferred immediately so that this authority can 
fulfill its tasks without trouble. The Authority cannot 
possibly stand by idly without being able to pay wages or pay 
for its own expenses. 
  [Mu'addi] One last question, Mr. Abu-al-'Ala': It has been 
reported that Yasir 'Arafat recently fell ill and was admitted 
to the military hospital in Tunis. What is Mr. 'Arafat's health 
condition these days? 
  [Quray'] I can confirm that these were very normal tests. 
He is in very, very good health. I can confirm this. 
  [Mu'addi] Mr. Ahmad Quray', Abu-al-'Ala', in Tunis, thank 
you very much. 
  [Quray'] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk] </F>
  [Text] As customary, Rabin's government has once again 
resorted to procrastination. It is trying to impose its concept 
[word indistinct] the Palestinian-Israeli agreement and its 
articles in a manner that serves only its interests, as if the 
agreement is just to throw dust in the eyes and a cover for 
Israeli [word indistinct] to continue controlling the situation 
on the ground and the Palestinian people, thus violating the 
articles of the agreement, its annexes, and the symbols of 
Palestinian sovereignty it contains, including the National 
Authority and its power to run the Palestinian affairs in 
accordance with the Palestinian interest. 
  Undoubtedly, the aim of Rabin's government is to abort the 
agreement and render it empty and lifeless. This is a first 
step toward circumventing the Palestinian national achievements 
[word indistinct]. 
  Commitment and pledge to implement the agreement -- any 
agreement -- is, according to sound logic, not for one party 
only, because the agreement is between two parties and is 
applied equally on both sides. 
  The Israeli superior attitude which claims that the 
Palestinian self-rule authorities have a duty to protect the 
armed settlers and secure guarantees for their arrogance, not 
only shows disdain for logic, but also demonstrates a series of 
Israeli violations aimed to confuse the Palestinian Authority 
and undermine its credibility concerning the Palestinian people, 
their shrines, and rights in the homeland. 
  The Palestinian Authority is the symbol of Palestinian 
sovereignty, and is --in all cases -- not concerned with the 
security of any symbols of occupation in the Palestinian 
self-rule areas. This authority cannot at all be responsible for 
the results of the Israeli violations, which cannot be far from 
the official Israeli policy. 
  In light of this situation, Rabin's government before anyone 
else, is demanded to prove its credibility toward implementation 
of the agreement in letter and spirit. This cannot be realized 
as long as Israel continues to place obstacles, cause 
(?confusion) and ambiguity concerning the agreement's articles 
and [words indistinct]. Rabin's government should also be aware 
that the Palestinian laws are the only legitimate and logical 
alternative after the end of occupation. Issuing [word 
indistinct] laws is a legitimate Palestinian right and one of 
the symbols of the Palestinian sovereignty that Rabin's 
government or anyone else cannot eliminate or cancel according 
to a whim that is far from (?sound logic). 
  The Palestinian people and their national leadership have 
been and will continue to be on the alert for Israeli traps, and 
will continue to maintain their decisionmaking until victory.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "George Hawwa Detained In Hammam </F>
al-Shatt for Making Deals Without PLO's Knowledge"] 
  [Excerpt] Tunis, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT; Rome, agencies -- 
Well-informed Palestinian sources have confirm to AL-SHARQ 
AL-AWSAT that George Hawwa, the Palestinian businessman, has, 
for the past 10 days, been in a PLO prison in the area of Hammam 
al-Shatt in the outskirts of the Tunisian capital. 
  The sources said that Hawwa, who is the uncle of President 
'Arafat's wife Suha al-Tawil, is in prison for concluding 
imaginary deals with foreign companies for the implementation of 
future projects in Gaza and Jericho without consulting the PLO, 
the National Authority, or the Palestinian Economic Council for 
Development and Reconstruction which is the body empowered to 
make such deals. 
  The sources revealed that Abu-al-Lutf [Faruq Qaddumi], head 
of the PLO's Political Department and deputy chairman of the 
Economic Council for Development and Reconstruction, was the one 
who raised the issue and informed 'Arafat of what happened, 
confirming that George Hawwa, brother of Raymonda al-Tawil, 
mother of Suha, exploited the fact the he was a relative of the 
Palestinian president's wife in making these imaginary deals and 
charging commission for that, claiming that he would submit the 
deals to 'Arafat later on for his signature. 
  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that 'Arafat ordered the 
detention of Hawwa as soon as he heard of the matter, and he was 
very hurt by the attitude of his wife's uncle who embarrassed 
him by exploiting his name and his wife's name. 
  Meanwhile, Suha has denied yesterday's Italian press reports 
claiming that she was about to be divorced. She described them 
as a part of a defamation campaign to slow down the Palestinian 
autonomy. 
  Suha 'Arafat issued that denial through an Arab journalist 
based in Rome after the appearance of these reports in several 
Italian papers. 
  In her statement, she said: "I am in my home near my husband 
President 'Arafat." 
  She also denied the reports claiming that her uncle George 
Hawwa was arrested in Tunis last week on the personal orders of 
'Arafat and that he was interrogated. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cairo, 26 May (MENA) -- Arab League Secretary 
General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid today received the credentials 
of Ambassador Ahmad Muhammad Luqman, Yemen's new delegate to the 
Arab League, succeeding Ambassador Ahmad al-Shajni, who died 
recently. 
  Ambassador Luqman stated that he and the Arab League 
secretary general discussed several issues concerning ways to 
resolve the Yemeni crisis and said that the Arab League has 
resumed its mediation efforts to resolve the crisis. He noted 
that efforts are being made quietly to resolve the crisis within 
the context of the Yemeni Constitution. He said: In Sanaa we 
look at the situation from the viewpoint that a state exists and 
there are legitimate constitutional institutions chosen by the 
entire Yemeni people. Hence no party has the right to declare 
secession. 
  He described the current war in Yemen as one between the 
legitimate government and separatist rebel forces. 
  Asked about Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's 
readiness 
for dialogue with the Aden leaders, Luqman said Sanaa has never 
stopped the dialogue, which continued throughout 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid's stay in Aden. He called for resorting to legitimacy 
and constitutional institutions. 
  Ambassador Ahmad Muhammad Luqman, Yemen's new permanent 
delegate to the Arab League, was born in al-Hudaydah in 1948 and 
began his political career as deputy minister of social affairs 
from 1976-1980. He then became minister of state and secretary 
general of the Higher Council of Youths and Sports from 
1981-1983, minister of municipalities and housing from 
1983-1988, and minister of insurance and social affairs from 
1990-1993.

  [Text] Cairo, 26 May (MENA)--'Ali Salim al-Bid's envoy 
Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas today asked Arab League 
Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid to reinstate south 
Yemen's membership in the Arab League. 
  Following his meeting with Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid this afternoon, 
al-'Attas stated that the issue of reinstating south Yemen will 
be added to the agenda of the League's ministerial council. He 
added that he requested the League's support in tackling the 
Yemeni situation. He noted that his current tour of Arab states 
aims to discuss the recognition of the new situation in Yemen 
and returning the situation to what it was before May 1990, the 
date on which unity was declared between the two sectors of 
Yemen. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali, member of the Yemeni Socialist 
Party's political bureau, who attended the meeting, expects 
several Arab states to recognize the Democratic Republic of 
Yemen soon. He said Dr. al-'Attas will tour the Gulf states 
after his visit to Cairo. 
  Al-Dali believes it is unlikely north Yemen will end the 
ongoing military battles to its advantage. He also denied that 
south Yemen received military assistance from any Arab or 
foreign state.

date not given -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] The AMU states -- Tunisia, Algeria, Libya, Morocco, 
and Mauritania -- have been following with great concern the 
serious developments in Yemen. The mass destruction resulting 
from the fighting between brothers -- for which the brotherly 
Yemeni people, above all, are paying the price -- is awakening 
the Arab and Islamic conscience with its ugliness. 
  The AMU states -- while warning yet again of the risks of 
this escalation that will harm the brotherly Yemeni people's 
gain of unity, in addition to the disastrous repercussions on 
peace and stability in the region that will result -- again urge 
all the Yemeni brothers to immediately halt the bloody 
confrontation, to return to reason, and to act in a spirit of 
responsibility, so that the way is cleared for dialogue on a 
peaceful settlement to the crisis in order that history may 
record it for the faithful sons of Yemen.

  [Text] Jeddah, May 25, SPA -- The minister of information, 
'Ali al-Sha'ir held a reception party on Tuesday [24 May] night 
to honour heads and members of the information delegations who 
came from various parts of the Arab and Islamic world to cover 
events of the just concluded haj season. The occasion was 
attended by Dr Fu'ad al-Farisi, undersecretary of the Ministry 
for Information Affairs, Ahmad al-Katani, under-secretary and 
general supervisors of the minister's office, Dr Shihab Jamjum, 
undersecretary for foreign information and senior officials of 
the ministry. 
  Addressing the gathering, minister al-Sha'ir welcomed the 
newsmen and conveyed to them the greetings of custodian of the 
two holy mosques, King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz and Crown Prince 
'Abdallah Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz and congratulated them on completion 
of the haj rituals. 
  Referring to the current Arab and Islamic causes and the 
best 
means to promote them through various media means, minister 
al-Sha'ir cited the noble meanings included in the royal speech 
delivered by King Fahd and Crown Prince 'Abdallah to the Muslim 
nation during the annual reception ceremony held in Mina last 
Sunday on the best ways to face up seditions, conflicts and 
challenges engulfing the Arab and Muslim worlds and he reminded 
the newsmen on their national and Islamic duty to repulse such 
hostile and unfair allegations. 
  He recalled a speech he delivered during the last year's 
reception party in which he tackled the hostile and fierce media 
campaigns waged by some malicious and spiteful parties against 
the Islamic faith, some Islamic states and people in a desperate 
attempt to insult them, proposals for working out an 
informational method on basis of the information charter of 
honour with the aim for facing up the biased and false 
allegations against the nation and some Islamic states. 
  Al-Sha'ir expressed delight over the successful efforts made 
during the year to realise the noble purpose and thanked all 
fair writers and journalists who tried to confront the hostile 
campaigns. 
  Al-Sha'ir urged the members of the delegations to have a 
close look on the giant and brilliant achievements accomplished 
by the government of custodian of the two holy mosques, King 
Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz and Crown Prince 'Abdallah 
Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz at the grand mosque and nearby holy places in 
the holy city of Mecca and the blessed mosque of the prophet in 
Madina which were completed in a record span to convey what they 
have seen to their peoples. 
  He expressed thanks and appreciation to the various Saudi 
information bodies and personnel who took part in the coverage 
of the events of the haj and thanked Arab and Islamic brothers 
who participated in transmission of the haj rituals through 
radio and television networks for the outside world. 
  The gathering was also addressed by Amin Basyuni, chairman 
of 
trustees council of the Egyptian Radio and Television 
Federation, Qurban Alesen, the deputy information minister of 
turkmenstan who was speaking on behalf of the Asian Islamic 
states, Khero Zain, the head of the Indonesian information 
delegation, Mohammed al-Hadi al-Teraiki, director general of the 
Tunisian news agency who all highlighted the distinguished 
preparations made by the kingdom, under the leadership of King 
Fahd, for the haj season and the great services and facilities 
made for the comfort and security of pilgrims. 
  They also cited with appreciation the great efforts being 
made by custodian of the two holy mosques, King Fahd 
Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz to realise Islamic solidarity and constructive 
cooperation under the umbrella of the Islamic teachings and his 
constant efforts to serve the Muslims, their sancturies and just 
causes on all regional and international forums. 
  On the other hand, the information delegations which

  [Text] Jeddah, May 26, SPA -- An official source has told 
SPA that in completion of the statement made on Monday [23 May] 
by an official source at the Ministry of Health containing 
initial statistics prepared by Red Crescent and general 
hospitals in Mecca and the holy places and submitted to the 
minister of health, and to correct the exaggerations and 
incorrect information published by some mass media, and after 
reviewing figures prepared by the Mecca region and the Ministry 
of Health which were completed on Thursday, we explain the 
following: 
  Firstly, the number of deaths reported from the 1st of 
Thilhijja [month of Haj -- beginning 12 May] until the end of 
the 12th of Thilhijja were as reported previously 829 detailed 
as follows: A -- the number of general deaths in the Mecca and 
holy places areas during the first 12 days of the month of 
Thilhijja were 559 including 62 cases of old age, 180 cases of 
sun stroke, 136 cases of heart diseases, 22 cases of brain 
vessels failure, 8 cases of malignant tumors, 14 cases of high 
blood pressure, 27 cases of chest diseases, 23 cases of 
accidents and 47 cases who died of other causes. 
  The number of deaths resulting from overcrowding at the 
Jamarat on Monday afternoon reached 270 cases including 6 
Saudis, 11 Egyptians, 2 Sudanese, one Yemeni, 6 Algerians, one 
Jordanian, 7 Moroccans, 5 Turks, 8 Nigerians, 18 Indians, 6 
Bangladeshis, 44 Pakistanis, 6 Indonesians, one Iranian, one 
Ghanian, one Afghan, one Dutch, one Mauritious, one Denmark and 
143 of unknown nationalities until this date. 
  The names of the dead persons which were found out until 
Thursday have been communicated to the Saudi Press Agency to 
carry them through the media both inside and outside the 
Kingdom, the source said. 
  The source said hundreds of thousands of people headed for 
Jamarat on Monday afternoon thereby neglecting the instructions 
given to them by Mutawifs and broadcast by the mass media over 
the previous ten days. 
  He added that most pilgrims raced to the Jamarat to finish 
this final ritual early even before noon and many of them were 
carrying their luggage on their backs which led to the 
overcrowding, the falling of some and tripping of others in 
addition to the haste by all. 
  Despite the existence of huge bridges built by the state to 
facilitate the movement and despite continuous expansion work on 
the roads leading to the three Jamarat, the large number of 
security personnel around the area and early warnings announced 
on loud speakers in various languages, terrible overcrowding 
occurs at each Jamrah and lives are lost. 
  The source stressed that if we count the deaths of a city 
with two-million population in 15 days under normal 
circumstances, we will find more deaths than the cases which 
occurred during this Haj season in Mecca and the holy places. 
  And if we take into consideration the number of pilgrims who 
performed pilgrimage this year, which is more than 1.5 million 
people, we will find that the percentage of deaths during this 
season was a mere 0.05 percent which is a normal one. 
  The source wondered what is with those who race to defame 
and 
doubt everything that the Saudi Government has offered and still 
offers to pilgrims every year when the Kingdom has spent 
billions and exerted intensive efforts to provide comfort for 
pilgrims. 
  The source said the motives of those who exaggerate the 
facts 
and figures and wrongly insult the Kingdom because of their 
hatred and sickness of the heart which reappears for the 
slightest of reasons, were known and so are the sides which 
recruit those hired persons in various arenas who will be sad to 
hear that the Haj season has succeeded to a great extent, thanks 
to Allah, and the Moslems who came to perform Haj have done so 
and returned home safely. 
  The source concluded that for those whose lives were taken 
by 
God while they were performing rituals to him obediently, we ask 
Allah to have mercy on them, send them to heaven and count them 
among the pious martyrs.

<F P=106> [Report by Shafiq al-Asadi: "Abu Dhabi: Nothing New in </F>
Iran's Offer To Settle Dispute over Abu Musa Island"] 
  [Excerpt] Abu Dhabi -- Diplomatic sources in Abu Dhabi 
have confirmed that Iran offered nothing new in its proposal to 
hold talks with the United Arab Emirates [UAE] in a bid to 
settle the dispute between them over Abu Musa Island. 
  The sources said that "this proposal is incomplete," and 
Iran 
must express its willingness to hold comprehensive talks on the 
three islands -- Tunb al-Kubra, Tunb al-Sughra, and Abu Musa -- 
which Iran occupied in 1971. 
  The sources pointed out that, since the suspension of direct 
talks between the two countries in September 1992, Iran has been 
talking about the possibility of resuming negotiations over Abu 
Musa Island. But the UAE believes that this is insufficient and 
that the negotiations must include the three islands. The 
sources said that the statements made by 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri, 
speaker of the Iranian parliament, regarding the resumption of 
bilateral talks "are not serious and are insufficient." 
  UAE President Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan stresses 
that Iranian calls to resume the dialogue over Abu Musa Island 
"bring nothing new and are still remote from what we are 
thinking about." 
  Shaykh Zayid is urging Iran to refer to the International 
Court of Justice so that each party can submit its evidence of 
its ownership of the three islands. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Last night, Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih, Presidential Council chairman, received the 
U.S. Ambassador in Sanaa, Arthur Hughes. They discussed 
developments in the situation in our country in light of the 
comprehensive war that traitor al-Bid has declared against the 
homeland and unity. 
  The U.S. ambassador reiterated his country's support for 
unity and democracy and his country's concern for stability and 
peace in Yemen. The brother chairman expressed our country's 
appreciation of the U.S. position. He stressed that the Yemen 
of unity, democracy, and respect for human rights will always be 
eager to bolster its relations with all brothers and friends, 
chiefly the United States, on the basis of mutual interests 
serving the objectives of the two friendly countries and peoples. 
  The meeting was attended by brother 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, 
minister of planning and development. 
  Brother 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih also received individually the 
ambassadors of the permanent UN Security Council states. He 
received the charge d'affaires of the PRC Embassy, French 
Ambassador Marcel (le Gelle), Russian Ambassador (P. Chencko), 
and UK Ambassador Douglas (Gordon). During the meetings, 
discussions dealt with the developments in the situation in our 
country and bilateral relations. The ambassadors reiterated 
their countries' support for Yemen's unity and democracy. They 
indicated that this is a firm stand that stems from their 
countries' interest in Yemen's stability and peace. During the 
meetings, the brother chairman expressed appreciation of the 
PRC, France, the Russian Federation, and the United Kingdom for 
supporting unity and democracy in our country. He stressed our 
country's eagerness to bolster its relations with those 
countries, proceeding from friendship, joint interests, mutual 
benefits, and positive, productive cooperation in all fields. 
  Referring to the current situation in our country, the 
brother chairman expressed confidence that brothers and friends 
understand that what is going on is an internal affair that 
concerns Yemen, and that the ongoing war ignited by traitor 
al-Bid against the homeland and its unity is a war between the 
Yemeni people with their various segments, political forces, and 
national and social organizations on the one hand and a small 
clique that has rebelled against the legitimate authority and 
conspired against unity and the homeland on the other. He 
stressed that some news media allegations that what is going on 
is a war between the north and south are unfounded. He stressed 
that there are over 11 military brigades from southern and 
eastern governorates now fighting at the forefront of the forces 
of unity in defense of Constitutional legitimacy, valiantly 
confronting the rebellious, secessionist gang.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Planning Minister Dr. </F>
'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani by Nabil Ghazzawi in Sanaa on 22 May] 
  [Text] Yemeni Planning Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani 
has ruled out the possibility that Saudi Arabia will recognize 
the state set up last week by the secessionists in Aden, led by 
'Ali Salim al-Bid. 
  Dr. al-Irayni said that if such thing were to happen, it 
would return us to the 1960's era and the conflict between the 
monarchists and republicans. I do not at all imagine that 
anyone in Saudi Arabia wants the situation to return to the 
1960's era. Therefore, I do not expect that Saudi Arabia in 
particular would recognize this state because they [the Saudis] 
are totally willing to have good relations with the Yemeni 
people. Otherwise, we would return to an era which the Saudi 
officials say repeatedly had been an extraordinary era in the 
Yemeni-Saudi relations during the conflict between the 
monarchists and republicans. No one wants a return to this era, 
and I never expect Saudi Arabia to be one of the countries that 
recognizes this enclave set up by al-Bid. This is because, as I 
said, they want to have good relations with Yemen, and because 
such recognition would return us to an era that we all do not 
want. 
  Answering a question by the Jordanian press delegation last 
Sunday on whether al-Bid's state has the pillars of a new state 
or whether it is stillborn, Dr. al-Iryani said: In fact, two 
thirds of the land is not under the control of this state. The 
governorates of Abyan, Lahij, and Shabwah are now under the 
control of the legitimacy. Certainly, they still control Aden. 
As for Hadhramaut Governorate, I have no doubt that it will 
soon be under the unity's control. Distance is the only reason 
state authority has not so far spread to it. They [southern 
leaders] have no popular support on the ground. Most of the 
land and population are under the control of the legitimate 
state authority. Whoever proclaims a state from nothing will 
fail. 
  On his expectations of when this current situation in Yemen 
would be over, Dr. al-Iryani said: In fact, there is a military 
dimension, and it is difficult to predict the period required by 
this dimension. However, I believe popular pressure will have a 
central role now that al-Bid has proclaimed a state. Therefore, 
I consider the proclamation of the state a step toward ending 
the situation. This means that this proclamation is an act of 
suicide that brings the end nearer. 
  Regarding Sanaa's response to al-Bid's possible use of 
chemical weapons--provided they are available to him--if the 
legitimate forces entered Aden within the coming days, Dr. 
al-Iryani said: First of all, the possibility that he has 
chemical weapons is slight, but let us assume that he uses such 
weapons, he will then be in his death throes. No one in the 
world or in Yemen would forgive him for this crime or for using 
any banned weapon. The proclamation of the state, makes the 
fall and end of al-Bid more pressing and important. As for 
cluster bombs, I am sure he does not have any. 
  Asked about President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's remarks on 21 
May in which he emphasized development and economic reform in 
Yemen, and whether that signals a new course, especially after 
the legitimate troops have control of the entire Yemeni 
territory, Dr. al-Iryani stressed: Undoubtedly, crushing the 
rebellion will usher in a new phase in the life of the Yemeni 
people, consolidating the Yemeni unity and firmly establishing 
the principle of abidance by the peaceful transfer of power. 
There will also be a unified central decisionmaking body. 
Regrettably, our partners from the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] 
have understood political pluralism as being both plurality of 
parties and plurality of stands. In other words, they have 
allowed themselves to be partners and opposionists at the same 
time. This is a wrong understanding which leads to subversive 
acts. We have seen economic, political, and social subversion 
because our partner to the authority is an oppositionist--or 
rather a subversive--partner. When the opposition is outside 
the authority, it can only be an opposition. Al-'Attas was the 
prime minister and an oppositionist at the same time. For 
example, we agreed with the World Bank on a reform program which 
was received with broad enthusiasm. Everyone was ready to 
contribute to the program, particularly Japan, the World Bank, 
and the United States. A World Bank mission was supposed to 
arrive in October 1993. Al-'Attas said: Postpone the visit. 
He did not approve the mission's visit. I personally had to 
postpone the visit until December or January. World Bank 
officials said they would come whenever we were ready. This is 
an example of an oppositionist when he is inside the authority 
and a decisionmaker. Look how he ruins things. Otherwise, the 
Yemeni economy would have been on the right course now. This is 
an unprecedented case. 
  Regarding the Fattah [after 'Abd-al-FATTAH Isma'il, former 
YSP secretary general who was killed in the June 1986 incidents 
in Aden] corrective trend and by whom it is led and what their 
position is, Dr. al-Iryani said: The Fattah trend is a YSP 
wing, most members of which are from Yafi' and Aden, as well as 
northern leaders whom we know. They were major loyalists to 
'Abd-al-Fattah Isma'il. This wing still exists inside the YSP. 
It seems that they have decided to assert themselves as a wing 
with a certain position. They consider themselves Fattahi's, 
after 'Abd-al-Fattah Isma'il. For example, Fadl Muhsin, minister 
of fish resources, considers himself a Fattahi, because his 
relationship with 'Abd-al-Fattah Isma'il was very strong. He 
always speaks of 'Abd-al-Fattah with respect. In addition, his 
wife is 'Abd-al-Fattah Isma'il's sister. 
  On Aden radio's vituperations against him, Dr. al-Iryani 
said: This is not the first time. They issued a statement 
before the war which was broadcast over Aden radio and 
television after the failure of the Salalah [in Oman] meeting. 
They described me as a warmongering general. Al-Bid personally 
slandered me and the brother president. This is a sign of 
bankruptcy. God knows, it never occurred to me that we would 
reach the point of war, but there was no other choice. 
  They led us to war. Two weeks before the war, I had the 
honor to pound the table during a cabinet meeting while they 
were all present and to tell them that the absence of the 
defense minister from that session was a war decision. I said 
this with a loud voice. Some of them like Jarallah 'Umar 
[minister of Culture and Tourism], al-Salami [minister of 
Electricity and Water Resources], and Fadl Muhsin [minister of 
Fish Resources] remind me of this incident now. They neither 
denied nor objected to my saying that the absence of the defense 
minister from the session was a war decision and that he did not 
come because he did not want to implement the fourth provision 
of the Pledge and Accord Document on withdrawing the forces from 
the border areas, and that these forces are the fangs the 
secessionists will use if war erupts. 
  I am not a war strategist. But I exposed them by saying they 
were preparing for war. That's why they are angry with me. 
They keep accusing me so that one day I will not say that I had 
announced at a cabinet session that the YSP had decided to go to 
war by not sending the defense minister to attend the cabinet 
session. I am proud that I was the one to warn against war, and 
not one of them replied. I told Fadl Muhsin: Brother Fadl, it 
is a pity if we hand things over to the military, so set your 
conditions. Another minister, the minister of electricity, 
replied that there are civilians who are more military-minded 
than the military themselves, and that this is our problem. I 
told him: Why hide things? I know you are speaking about me, 
because you discussed this at a YSP Political Bureau meeting and 
you decided to accuse me. He did not reply. 
  Regarding rumors that the YSP ministers are under arrest in 
Aden, he said: This is not true. They are there and carrying 
out their duties. But are they doing so voluntarily or under 
pressure? This can be verified later but not now. I do not 
rule out the possibility that many of the ministers who are 
Political Bureau members are under pressure and are being 
threatened to have them go along with things. I know they do 
not support the proclamation of a state as this will mean their 
end. 
  Regarding rumors that he lives a luxurious life, although I 
saw him having only yogurt and juice for breakfast, Dr. 
al-Iryani said: This is what I have been having for the past 
four years. I do not pay any attention to such matters. 
  The truth is that the YSP started the war because they 
expected that fighting would take place on the previous borders 
for a few days or weeks, after which there would be pressure to 
halt the fighting and negotiations would ensue while the forces 
would remain on the borders between the two parts of Yemen. 
However, al-Bid was surprised to see that the front has 
collapsed and that fighting took place only 21 km from Aden, not 
to mention that the fighting also moved to the Shabwah front, 
which completely collapsed, as well as that of al-'Anad and its 
being captured by the forces of legitimacy. They counted on the 
fact that peace-keeping forces would come to disengage the 
combatants. 
  However, the tribes tricked him, particularly in Bakil. The 
military were deceived. I view this as the biggest political 
trickery ever practiced by politicians against the military. 
This is because no military man has ever been tricked as those 
who were linked to al-Bid. Not a single bullet was fired in 
Sanaa. They told the military that Harf Sufyan, 'Imran, Arhab, 
and Naham would be set ablaze and that the Sanaa regime would be 
busy extinguishing the fires in its own house. They told them: 
We will entrench the partition plan, and you will once again 
become a state. 
  Asked why all battles have started on a Wednesday, beginning 
with 'Imran, Dhamar, and al-'Anad, Dr. al-Iryani said: 
Wednedsay in the eastern and southern regions in Yemen is an 
ill-omened day and not one that heralds optimism.

  [Excerpts] The Yemeni civil service minister and member of 
the General People's Congress in brotherly Yemen affirmed the 
Yemeni people's appreciation of the brother leader of the 
revolution's firm and unwavering stance in support of the unity 
of the Arab nation and the freedom of the Arab people. 
  In an interview with AL-ZAHF AL-AKHDAR, the Yemeni civil 
service minister said that the leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi had 
made great efforts toward achieving Yemeni unity. [passage 
omitted] 
  For his part, Yemeni Planning Minister 'Abd-al-Karim 
al-Iryani announced yesterday that Yemenis living in Saudi 
Arabia had sent large sums of money to the forces of the 
splinter group within the Socialist Party in southern Yemen 
headed by 'Ali Salim al-Bid for the purchase of weapons and 
military supplies from abroad. 
  In a statement to journalists, he indicated that Saudi 
Arabia 
was involved in this, explaining that a military consignment 
worth 5 million dollars was purchased for the rebels in the 
south by one of the Yemenis resident in Saudi Arabia. He said 
that the consignment was now being detained at a Red Sea port in 
Djibouti. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Reports by 'Abdallah Hammudah and Lutfi Shatarah in London, </F>
Najib Sadiq in Aden, and AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT bureaus in Sanaa and 
Cairo: "Sanaa Leans Towards Negotiations and Aden Fights to 
Regain Shabwah"] 
  [Excerpts] A new tendency has appeared in the North Yemeni 
command in Sanaa indicating "a willingness to start a dialogue 
with Aden" with the aim of stopping the fighting between the 
northern and southern forces as a result of which 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid, secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], 
proclaimed the Democratic Republic of Yemen in the south, ending 
the four-year old unity between the two parts of Yemen. 
  That tendency was reflected in a statement by Dr. 
'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, planning and development minister and 
member of the General Committee (Political Bureau) of the 
General People's Congress [GPC], who said that "contacts are 
underway between YSP leaders and the government of Sanaa to 
agree on holding a dialogue." [passage omitted] 
  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned from sources of arms dealers 
in 
Europe that Jordan has expressed willingness to purchase arms on 
behalf of the northern forces command in Sanaa after numerous 
states banned the sale of arms to Sanaa and Aden as long as the 
war between their forces in Yemen continued. The sources said 
that Jordan acted in the same way to purchase arms for Iraq 
throughout the years of war between Iraq and Iran. [passage 
omitted] 
  While the intensity of the battles generally eased after 
fierce fighting on the Kharaz-Bab el Mandeb front on the western 
axis the day before yesterday, the most important battle 
yesterday was in the Shabwah Governorate. Shabwah Governor 
Ahmad Bin-Farid al-Suraymah has told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the 
southern forces have captured the northern part of 'Ataq, the 
capital of Shabwah, and that fighting was raging in the 
southwestern part of the town. 
  In an exclusive telephone statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT via 
satellite from the battlefield, the Shabwah governor said that 
the remnants of the northern forces consisting of a Republican 
Guard brigade, a shock brigade, a paratroopers brigade, and the 
6th Brigade "withdrew from parts of the town after their 
soldiers looted people's property and acted like thieves." 
  He confirmed that the southern forces recaptured several 
towns including al-Sa'id and al-Musayni'ah after inflicting 
losses on the northern forces including hundreds of casualties. 
He emphasized that "the liberation of the Shabwah Governorate 
will be completed within two days at the most." [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Planning Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim </F>
al-Iryani by Lamis al-Barghuthi in Sanaa; date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Al-Barghuthi] Can we describe 
what is taking place in Yemen as a popular civil war? 
  [Al-Iryani] No. A civil war means fighting in every suburb, 
street, and village in Yemen. This is not the case now. The 
present war is between military forces belonging to the 
Socialist Party and other military forces defending the unity. 
  [Al-Barghuthi] Do you think the perpetuation of war and 
failure to quickly settle the situation militarily may lead to a 
protracted war of annihilation in which civilians will 
eventually take part? 
  [Al-Iryani] I do not think so because the present military 
situation does not suggest this possibility. The Abyan, Lahij, 
and Shabwah Governorates are entirely under control. The 
non-fall of Aden cannot turn into a civil war in Abyan, Shabwah, 
or other governorates. People are far from the atmosphere of 
war; they are leading an extremely normal life. Therefore, I 
think it is impossible for matters to turn into a civil war. 
Things now depend on the fall of Aden. I am confident that 
once the Socialist Party's mechanism is uprooted in al-Mukalla, 
it will all be over. As you know, fighting is currently taking 
place only on one front, that is, the Aden front. We are not in 
a hurry to enter Aden. The "legitimate forces" may enter 
Hadhramaut before Aden. Our care for civilians in Aden is all 
that is stopping us. Indiscriminate shelling of the city for 
10-12 hours may lead to its fall. It is preferable to besiege 
the city for a few days instead of bombing it indiscriminately 
and harming the civilians. We will thus avoid a civil war which 
the socialists tried to launch. Their indiscriminate shelling 
of Sanaa with Scud missiles is meant to tell the Arabs and the 
world that what is taking place in Yemen is a civil war as 
proven by civilian casualties. They will then call for Arab and 
international intervention in Yemen to stop the civil war. 
  [Al-Barghuthi] How do you view the political solution after 
the cessation of battles and how will you deal with the 
Socialist Party's leaders and cadres? 
  [Al-Iryani] This subject has been settled by two decisions. 
The public prosecutor decided to take legal action against 16 
Socialist Party civilian and military officials and ordered 
their arrest. This was followed by the general amnesty decree. 
The way the non-prosecuted Socialist Party leaders behave 
toward the general amnesty decree will decide the way to deal 
with them. 
  [Al-Barghuthi] Will power be shared equally between the two 
parties as was the case before the war? 
  [Al-Iryani] At the end of the war, we expect to negotiate 
with the Socialist Party as a partner to the coalition, but it 
will not be given any other privilege. Before the war, the 
socialists were given privileges they did not deserve and this 
led to the present state of affairs. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, member of the </F>
Yemeni Presidential Council and assistant secretary general of 
the General People's Congress, by unidentified correspondent in 
Sanaa; date not given] 
  [Text] [AL-HAYAH] How will you reply to the Scud missile 
fired on residential areas in the center of Sanaa Monday [23 
May] evening? 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] That was a criminal and cowardly act 
perpetrated by the gang of apostasy and secession within the 
Socialist Party leadership. This is in addition to the previous 
criminal acts. They fired their missiles on residential areas. 
The last missile was fired on a hospital. We can see how they 
are continuing to pursue their destructive policy. While we 
continue to pursue our constructive policy for rebuilding and 
development. There is, of course, a difference between the two 
lines -- a difference which ordinary citizens can see. Their 
criminal acts will not pass without punishment, and our people 
know how to respond to these people. 
  [AL-HAYAH] What will be the punishment? 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] The punishment that every criminal who kills 
innocent people deserves. 
  [AL-HAYAH] Does that mean you will continue your military 
pressure on the other side? 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] Our military actions against the leadership 
of the rebels and secessionists in the Socialist Party will not 
be suspended until Yemen's unity returns solid and without these 
secessionists. 
  [AL-HAYAH] Now that government forces have seized 'Ataq, the 
axis of the central sector of southern governorates, will they 
advance toward Hadhramaut? 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] Military actions against these people will 
not be suspended in any area until the people get rid of them. 
  [AL-HAYAH] Is there a political solution to this war and the 
current problem? 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] A political solution is on the cards when 
military operations cease and the 16 leaders of the secession 
gang, whose prosecution has been ordered by the prosecutor 
general, give themselves up. 
  [AL-HAYAH] We understand that the priority now is the 
military battle and the destruction of your rivals. 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] The fighting was started by the secessionist 
gang in the Socialist Party, and we are defending unity against 
what these secessionists are doing. 
  [AL-HAYAH] Will the Socialist Party and some of its leaders 
whom you consider moderate have a role in the future of the 
political movement and power in Yemen? 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] We are willing to talk with Socialist Party 
members who have not participated in the secession crime. 
  [AL-HAYAH] It has been noted that the prosecution and arrest 
warrant issued by the prosecutor general in Sanaa against 16 
Socialist Party leaders does not include the names of important 
Socialist Party leaders like Salim Salih Muhammad, the party's 
assistant secretary general; Dr. Yasin Sa'id Nu'man, chairman of 
the party's Secretariat; and Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali, chairman 
of the party's external relations department. Does that mean 
that it is possible to engage in a dialogue with these? 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] We are willing to engage in a dialogue with 
all the Socialist Party leaders who have not participated in the 
secessionist operation.

  [Text] Regarding the Arab stand vis-a-vis the Yemeni 
southerners' secession declaration and the proclamation of an 
independent state, 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, member of the 
Yemeni Presidential Council, told told our radio correspondent 
Ahmad Birru: 
  [Begin 'Abd-al-Ghani recording] In fact, we do not believe 
that the United Arab Emirates [UAE] has recognized the 
secessionist state or the secession declaration announced by 
'Ali Salim al-Bid. The UAE has always been with unity, 
particularly Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan, who supported Yemen unity. 
We do not believe any Arab or foreign state will recognize this 
secession declaration announced by 'Ali Salim al-Bid, because it 
is unconstitutional. 
  We do not want to impose unity by force, but (?through 
peaceful means). The whole Yemeni people in the southern, 
eastern, northern, and western governorates support unity. 
Those who are imposing state authority in the southern 
governorates are government forces. These forces are not from 
the northern governorates, but from northern and southern 
governorates. The northern governorates are not imposing unity 
on the southern governorates. There is readiness for unity. As 
it was achieved peacefully, it will continue so. All the Yemeni 
people support unity. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, member of the </F>
Yemeni Presidential Council, by Ahmad Birru; place and date not 
given; from the "Today's Guest" program -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Birru] Your Excellency 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd 
al-Ghani, member of the Yemeni Presidential Council: The Yemeni 
war is in its third week. As a result of this war, northern and 
southern Yemen have sustained grave losses. There are many 
domestic, Arab, and international calls for dialogue. Isn't it 
high time for dialogue, and is Sanaa ready for it? 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] We did not want this war. This war was 
imposed on Yemen by the secessionist elements in the Yemeni 
Socialist Party [YSP] leadership. We always supported dialogue. 
We held a dialogue with the secessionist YSP leadership for nine 
months. We were ready to resume dialogue, but they discontinued 
this dialogue and started the fighting inside the Armed Forces. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Birru] Both 'Ali Salim al-Bid and the YSP leadership 
declared the secession of southern Yemen. As was understood 
from remarks by Shaykh Zayid, president of the United Arab 
Emirates [UAE], the UAE implicitly recognizes the new Yemeni 
state. Shaykh Zayid said he received a telephone call from His 
Excellency 'Ali Salim al-Bid. Moreover, Shaykh Zayid warned 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih that Yemeni unity cannot be 
imposed by force. Do you expect recognition of the south Yemeni 
state by Gulf, Arab, or foreign states? 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] In fact, we do not believe the UAE has 
recognized the secessionist state or the secession declaration 
announced by 'Ali Salim al-Bid. The UAE has always been with 
unity, particularly Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan, who supported 
Yemeni unity. We do not believe any Arab or foreign state will 
recognize this secession declaration announced by 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid, because it is unconstitutional. 
  We do not want to impose unity by force, because unity was 
achieved through peaceful means. The whole Yemeni people in the 
southern, eastern, northern, and western governorates support 
unity. Those who are imposing state authority in the southern 
governorates are government forces. These forces are not from 
the northern governorates, but from northern and southern 
governorates. The northern governorates are not imposing unity 
on the southern governorates. There is readiness for unity. As 
it was achieved peacefully, it will continue so. All the Yemeni 
people support unity. 
  [Birru] Do you hold the YSP, in its entirety, responsible 
for the war, or are you ready to hold a dialogue with elements 
in the YSP leadership in order to find a way out of this war? 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] We do not hold the YSP responsible. This is 
proven by the fact that parliamentary leaders from the YSP and 
leaders of the YSP branches in various parts of the Republic 
have issued statements against the secession declaration. We 
are ready for a dialogue with these leaders on the best ways to 
save Yemen from the war imposed on it. We are only against the 
secessionist elements that started the fighting and declared the 
secession. 
  [Birru] The YSP leaders who called for dialogue are from 
northern Yemen. Have YSP leaders from southern Yemen announced 
their readiness for dialogue, or are you ready for dialogue with 
them? 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] Yes. We do not view the YSP as a southern 
or northern party. The YSP is represented throughout the 
Republic, and its members in the northern governorates outnumber 
those in the southern governorates. Those who issued a 
statement against the secession declaration were led by brother 
'Ali Salih (?'Ubad), deputy speaker of the House of 
Representatives, who represents a constituency in the southern 
governorates. Doing the same were approximately 15 YSP leaders 
representing constituencies in the southern governorates. They 
issued a statement, along with their brother members of the YSP 
in the House of Representatives from some northern governorates. 
  The truth is that the war is not one between the north and 
south, as people described it. In fact, elements in the YSP 
leadership rebelled against the state. These elements are being 
confronted by all citizens in the north and south. I believe 
that if you sent people to the southern governorates and asked 
the opinion of both the man on the street and the leaders, you 
would find that all people support unity and are against both 
the secession declaration and fighting, exactly like other 
citizens in the Republic. [passage omitted]

their sons and brothers in the battle for Yemen and its unity 
against the renegades who are calling for secession. 
  He urged them to offer sacrifices so that everyone can

  [Text] Mr. Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, the prime minister, 
affirmed that his current tour of several Arab countries aims at 
stopping the war. He pointed out that this war brings losses 
not only to Yemen but to all Arab countries. 
  In a press statement in Cairo today, Mr. al-'Attas said that 
consultations and deliberations are taking place on the issue of 
recognizing the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY]. This step 
has been imposed by the war which was launched on the south by 
the Sanaa rulers. Al-'Attas added that we demand a halt to this 
war and withdrawal of the forces to their positions before 22 
May 1990. Then dialogue could begin on all matters which concern 
Yemen and how to tackle various issues, either the traces of the 
war or the future of Yemen. 
  Mr. al-'Attas refuted that elements in the Yemeni Socialist 
Party [YSP] had carried out mediation independently from the YSP 
leadership. He pointed out that there were national elements, 
with Mujahid Abu-Shawarib [deputy prime minister for internal 
affairs] among them, who earlier conducted consultations with 
several personalities outside the homeland. When some ideas 
began to evolve, 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih dissuaded these 
personalities from continuing their efforts. 
  Mr. al-'Attas welcomed any Yemeni or Arab efforts. He added 
that he preferred to submit the Yemeni cause to the UN Security 
Council and he affirmed that the Security Council can assist in 
stopping the war.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Salih Abu-Bakr Bin-Husaynun, </F>
Yemeni Socialist Party Central Committee member, in London, by 
Bashir al-Bakr, in Paris, on 15 May] 
  [Text] [Al-Bakr] It seems that the military battle's direct 
objective of occupying Aden has failed. Do you believe the 
battle will continue and what are its objectives? 
  [Bin-Husaynun] The direct objective of the battle has 
actually been foiled after one week of fighting thanks to our 
forces' steadfastness. Today, the 15th of May, the forces of 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih who ignited the war are in a difficult 
position. All their supply lines are being cut from the rear. 
These forces will be besieged and will be forced to either 
surrender, or be destroyed. 
  'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's dream of occupying Aden and the 
southern and eastern governorates are sick dreams. He knows 
more than anyone else that this will not take place during his 
time, and that the logic of annexation and occupation is 
rejected even if this will cost us our lives. The question is 
not confined to within the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] but is a 
general popular feeling. The people are ready for sacrifices to 
shake off hegemony and despotism and to defend their interests. 
  The battles show that his forces which tried to reach Aden 
have been routed. The forces are now intermingling in the 
[former] border areas. Salih's forces are now in a position 
that is not to be envied. He and the military from the 
Al-Ahmar family are fully responsible for the military and 
civilian casualties because they were the ones to launch a war 
on the Yemeni people on 4 May. The people will not forgive this 
gang and it will be taken to account sooner or later. 
  [Al-Bakr] But the communiques Sanaa continues to issue still 
speak about military victories and about trying the YSP leaders. 
What do you have to say to this? 
  [Bin-Husaynun] As the military offensive has failed in 
attaining its objectives, the psychological war and the military 
communiques will also not serve the operations room that runs 
the war. If we review the military communiques issued over one 
week and the statements made by the civilian generals like 
Basindwah and al-Iryani, we find that they have captured Aden 
more than 20 times. 
  I will reveal a secret. 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and the gang 
that launched the war are preparing to escape from Yemen. 
However, we will not permit them to do so. He will have to pay 
for what he has committed. We will stalk him wherever he goes. 
  [Al-Bakr] Does this mean you are preparing to enter Sanaa? 
  [Bin-Husaynun] Sanaa is a must even if the journey is a long 
one because it is the capital of Yemen and cannot be given up. 
  [Al-Bakr] And do you view this as a victory if it takes 
place? What is the use of entering Sanaa? The president says 
that his objective is to enter Aden and you answer him with the 
same logic while the war destroys the country's economy and 
kills people? 
  [Bin-Husaynun] We do not claim victories. From the first day 
of the war that was launched on us, we said we will exercise 
positive self-defense. What can we do when we find ourselves 
facing a bloodthirsty suicidal gang? The only solution is to 
eradicate this gang which obstructs development, prevents 
stability, and makes the people go backward. This war was 
imposed on us and on all the good forces. That's why 
confrontation is inevitable. We have to admit that the people 
pay a prohibitive price for this, but what can we do? 
  [Al-Bakr] You toured the United Arab Emirates [UAE], 
Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia. What was the objective 
of this tour? What are the positions of the Arab leaders whom 
you met on the ongoing war in Yemen? 
  [Bin-Husaynun] We met with [UAE President] His Highness 
Shaykh Zayid, who cares for Yemeni unity, and with His 
Excellency President Husni Mubarak, who, along with us, worked 
to prevent the war option. We also met with His Excellency 
President Hafiz al-Asad, who is known for his unionist 
positions, and with His Majesty King Husayn, who sponsored the 
signing of the document of pledge and accord, and also with His 
Majesty King Fahd, a neighbor and a brother who cares for 
sparing Yemeni blood. 
  We briefed the brothers on the ongoing unfair war which is 
spilling Yemeni blood and threatening Yemen's unity and 
stability. We also conveyed messages from brother 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid, deputy chairman of the Presidential Council and 
secretary general of the YSP. These messages cautioned against 
the serious regrettable events planned and carried out by 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih and the military clique of the al-Ahmar family. 
We also carried an initiative by the brother secretary general 
to spare blood. We sensed both a response and care for sparing 
blood, for halting the destructive war, and for safeguarding 
Yemen's unity and people. 
  [Al-Bakr] What are the points of the initiative you carried 
to the Arab leaders? 
  [Bin-Husaynun] In brief, the initiative calls for an 
immediate cease-fire and the return to the negotiating table in 
order to resolve all problems. Our Arab brothers promised us to 
provide everything needed to stop the bleeding and help the 
Yemeni people circumvent their ordeal. We now express the YSP 
leadership's satisfaction with this attitude and these genuine 
and responsible positions. 
  [Al-Bakr] It is noted that you were received at the highest 
level. Does this mean the Arab brothers do not recognize the 
decisions made by President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, which ousted 
you from the government? 
  [Bin-Husaynun] You may come to this conclusion. I would 
like to point out that all Arab leaders, whom we met, felt that 
there is a real crisis which cannot be summed up in such terms 
as legitimacy and outlaws, terms which Salih used as the themes 
of his war. The Arab leaders believe that dialogue is necessary 
and that the decisions made should be canceled, so the two sides 
could resolve the problem. 
  I would like to pose a question to 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih: If 
the southern leaders are secessionists and outlaws, then with 
whom was the unity achieved? Is unity not concluded between two 
parties? Moreover, what is meant by legitimacy? Does legitimacy 
mean the legitimate cancellation of one party in favor of 
another party? 
  [Al-Bakr] What is your comment on a statement made by 
[Yemeni Planning and Development Minister] Dr. al-Iryani that 
the north would continue the war to finish off the YSP, even if 
it takes 100 years to do so? 
  [Bin-Husaynun] If he can do so, let him do it. However, I 
would like to tell al-Iryani that our ability is twice his 
ability and we will defend our ideas, principles, and the Yemeni 
people in the south and north for 200 years. 
  Furthermore, I would like to blame al-Iryani because we 
wanted him in the ranks of modernization and peace in view of 
his known high culture. We, however, find al-Iryani today 
wearing a military suit and making conflicting and shaky 
statements. 
  [Al-Bakr] Has oil been affected by the war? 
  [Bin-Husaynun] The oil installations have not yet been 
affected by the military operations, and the oil production and 
exportation are continuing as before in the oil fields of 
Ma'rib, Shabwah, and Hadhramaut. However, the exploration and 
survey operations came to a halt, and a large number of experts 
departed. 
  [Al-Bakr] If we assume that fighting stopped today and that 
you returned to dialogue, what project would you propose? Would 
you continue the unity or search for a new formula? 
  [Bin-Husaynun] Our direct objective is a cease-fire. This 
would facilitate the search for appropriate options. We demand 
an unconditional cease-fire and a return to dialogue. When we 
made an initiative in this regard we were careful and governed 
by a sense of responsibility toward our people. We did not make 
this initiative out of fear or weakness. 
  [Al-Bakr] Thus, the opportunity for dialogue with President 
Salih still exists, despite everything? 
  [Bin-Husaynun] Dialogue is necessary, whether with Salih or 
others. This is because Yemen does not lack the forces of good 
will.

  [Text] Mr. 'Abd-al-Qawi Makkawi, a member of the 
presidential council, said that the declaration of the 
Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY] does not mean that south has 
split away from the north. The purpose is to prepare the Yemeni 
arena to receive a unified Yemeni state that remains on a 
democratic basis and takes the pledge and accord document as an 
approach for government in which no party seizes power to the 
detriment of other parties. 
  Mr. al-Makkawi added in a talk to the Egyptian AL-AHRAM 
newspaper published today that the fighting which broke out in 
Yemen in the last weeks was only aimed at drowning Yemen in the 
blood of its sons. He pointed out that the Yemeni Socialist 
Party did not begin the war and the repartition, and that those 
who took the war decision are to blame. Mr. 'Abd-al-Qawi 
Makkawi expressed confidence that Aden city will not fall and 
that the victory by military power will not be achieved.

<F P=106> [Interview with Salim Salih Muhammad, member of the </F>
proclaimed presidential council in Aden, by Antoin 'Awn in 
London on 26 May -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Muhammad] The world recognizes what actually 
exists. We are the only ones entitled to defend the cause. We 
are being attacked, our villages, cities, and institutions are 
being occupied, and all we have contributed to the Yemeni unity 
and homeland is being destroyed. Whoever started the war should 
bear the responsibility for that destruction, for breaking the 
constitutional legitimacy, and for what happened to the country. 
  ['Awn] You said that what actually exists determines world 
recognition. What is the reality today? 
  [Muhammad] The war is entering its fourth week. Whoever said 
that this war will be settled within days has miscalculated. 
The war will continue for a long time and will give rise to 
other options. Hence, we still warn, demand, and raise our 
voices with an appeal to all to stop this war. 
  ['Awn] Aden repeatedly implied that there are Iraqi POW's. 
It spoke yesterday about chemical weapons that Sanaa is using. 
Is there an Iraqi involvement and what is the official stance 
in Aden? 
  [Muhammad] I regret to say, away from political oneupmanship 
or attempts to gain from this or that issue, that Iraq is 
involved. The evidence is found in the stance its Arab League 
representative has taken and the stance assumed by the Ba'th 
Party and represented in the statement the party's national 
command in Baghdad has issued. This is a clear sign of full bias 
toward the military action and the northern troops' invasion of 
the southern and eastern regions of the country.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" report] </F>
  [Text] Former South Yemeni President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad 
has told AL-DUSTUR that he and Shaykh Mujahid Abu-Shawarib are 
currently working on an initiative to stop the Yemeni war. In 
the meantime, sources close to the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] 
leadership said forces loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih 
have reached the environs of the Hadhramaut Governorate, which 
is adjacent to the Shabwah Governorate. 
  YSP sources expressed doubts that the president's forces 
will 
be able to continue to advance to al-Mukalla, the capital of 
Hadhramaut, where 'Ali Salim al-Bid, who declared himself 
president of the Democratic Republic of Yemen a few days ago, is 
now present. They say these forces cannot deploy over a vast 
area and maintain their cohesion at the same time. 
  These sources believe that the opening of the eastern front 
by the forces of legitimacy in Shabwah was not meant to achieve 
military as much as political and economic gains represented in 
sharing the Shabwah oil revenues. 
  Reached by telephone in Damascus, the former Yemeni 
president 
told AL-DUSTUR that he and Shaykh Mujahid Abu-Shawarib, the 
well-known national figure, will propose an initiative aimed at 
preserving the Yemeni unity and effecting a cease-fire. 
  'Ali Nasir declined to elaborate on this initiative at 
present as its publication may undermine the current efforts and 
contacts with the two parties to the conflict, indicating that 
he himself had earlier announced his rejection of 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid's secession decision. He said: We want a solution that 
guarantees the Yemeni unity, spares blood, leads to a 
cease-fire, and solves problems within the framework of the 
state of unity. He expressed hope that the anticipated solution 
may lie in an agreement by the two warring parties to 
simultaneously announce the following: 
  1. Preserving unity and canceling the secession decision. 
  2. Ceasing fire immediately. 
  3. Lifting the siege clamped on Aden. 
  The former Yemeni president said this can be followed by 
searching for a new formula that guarantees the existence of one 
central state that is capable of survival. 
  Asked by AL-DUSTUR if these are the main points of the 
initiative he and Shaykh Mujahid Abu-Shawarib are proposing, he 
said the initiative contains other details. 
  'Ali Nasir Muhammad denied a statement by 'Abd-al-Qawi 
Makkawi two days ago that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid have agreed to meet in Paris. He said: We are still 
contacting the two men in order to reach a cease-fire first. We 
will arrange for a meeting between the two at a later stage. 
  In a related development, YSP sources expressed surprise at 
the delay in Kuwaiti recognition of the Democratic Republic of 
Yemen and said that Kuwait was expected to be the first state to 
recognize the new state and that Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Shaykh 
Sabah al-Ahmad was expected to visit Aden and announce his 
country's recognition from there. The sources attributed this 
delay to possible strong foreign pressure by international 
powers like the United States and other regional forces.

<F P=106> [Unscheduled commentary] </F>
  [Text] O sons of our proud Yemeni people in the city of 
Aden and everywhere in our one Yemeni homeland: The forces of 
apostasy and secession under the leadership of 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid, the criminal traitor and veteran terrorist, have never 
hesitated about spreading terrorism and bloodshed to every place 
reached by their spiteful, criminal hands. 
  In the same way as they directed their 
internationally-prohibited missiles of mass destruction toward 
Sanaa, Ta'izz, al-Hudaydah, Ma'rib, and al-Rahidah, killing 
innocent children, women, elderly people, and men, and 
destroying the secure residential areas, they did not spare the 
valiant city of Aden from their treacherous, cowardly strikes. 
Missile strikes were dealt to it by the forces of apostasy and 
secession during the past few days, aiming at the residential 
areas in the city of Aden as if the bloodthirsty criminals -- 
through this terrorist action -- are warning the citizens in the 
valiant city of Aden with the aim of terrorizing them and 
dissuading them from joining the ranks of unity and 
constitutional legitimacy. The hand of treachery, rancor, 
treason, and secession is being extended to steadfast and heroic 
Abyan everyday. Missiles and shells are landing in it from 
warships and aircraft that are still in the hands of the 
traitors and secessionists, enemies of God, people, and the 
homeland. These strikes are destroying houses and killing 
innocent people. What more do the criminal secessionist 
traitors have in store? Shall we allow them to continue their 
criminal actions? That is something that will not be tolerated 
by our proud Arab Muslim people -- our great Yemeni people.

  [Excerpt] A responsible source in the Command of the Armed 
Forces of the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY] has condemned 
the dangerous escalation in the war by the gang of the bloody 
al-Ahmar clan in Sanaa which launched four missiles on the city 
of Aden early this morning. The calm and peaceful inhabitants 
of Aden were taken by surprise by these four missiles, at a time 
when the adventurist gang in Sanaa is shouting about its wish to 
bring about a solution by way of a cease-fire. This shows not 
only the insincerity of this bloody gang, but also once again 
confirms its insistence on persevering with the destructive war 
against our people in the DRY and with the lack of care for the 
innocent victims and other civil losses resulting from this war. 
  The responsible source in the DRY Armed Forces Command 
confirmed that our ground defenses succeeded in shooting down 
one of the missiles, while another fell into the sea without 
causing any material damage (?or) [word indistinct]. [passage 
omitted].

  [Text] An official source in the Command of the Armed 
Forces in democratic Yemen has given a statement saying that a 
number of soldiers and officers who surrendered at various 
battlefronts and who had been launched by the killer 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih to fight against their brothers in the 
Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY], have affirmed that their 
command had misinformed them about the facts on the political 
and military situations. For example, they informed them in Bab 
al-Mandeb-Kharaz axis that their forces had reached Salah al-Din 
camp, while those soldiers and officers at al- Rahidah front and 
Karish that their forces had reached Dar Sa'd on the outskirts 
of Aden. [sentence as heard] This was not only a deceit and 
misleading to these soldiers and officers in order to plunge 
them in fierce battles, but was against all reason. 
  The military source added that scientific military 
calculations do not accept this. There was also another fact 
which was ignored by the military command in Sanaa. It was that 
they were waging an aggressive war, which should be firmly 
countered by well-trained forces and by people who do not submit 
to any injustice and tyrant. The aggressors were faced with a 
brave resistance and incredible steadfastness on the part of the 
DRY's forces, which enjoy high morale and rare heroism. 
  The military source added that the democratic Yemen's Armed 
Forces Command in defense of the national and human 
responsibility towards the misled elements who were plunged by 
the al-Ahmar gang, calls on all these soldiers and officers to 
take a brave and reasonable stand and refuse to continue in this 
failed war into which they were launched by the family, which is 
concerned only to maintain the throne of authority of 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih and his adventurous gang. The source expressed 
confidence of the Armed Forces of the DRY that these 
(?mischievous) elements will take any opportunity to get rid of 
the certain death and rid our people and their families of 
sadness and concern over their lives to which Sanaa's rulers 
give no consideration. The Armed Forces Command of the DRY 
affirm that those who will surrender spontaneously will receive 
all appreciation and respect from their brothers in blood and 
faith and affiliation to the sons of the DRY.

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has said that Israel 
will meticulously see to it that all the centers of government 
for the Palestinian Authority are located in Jericho and not in 
Jerusalem. We will now go over to our political correspondent 
Shlomo Raz in the broadcasting van at the Ramat Aviv Hotel in 
Tel Aviv: 
  [Raz] Addressing Labor's Political and Social Forum -- this 
time devoid of any puns -- the prime minister referred to a 
series of political issues on the agenda. With Jerusalem 
increasingly becoming the top item, it is important to hear what 
the prime minister had to say in view of the agreements signed 
with the PLO. 
  [Begin Rabin recording] I have no doubt that there have been 
several phenomena in Jerusalem through the years where it would 
have been better if it had not taken place. I believe we will 
take steps to enforce what is written in the Declaration of 
Principles, to the effect that all the centers of government of 
the Palestinian Authority should be located in Jericho. That is 
what we both agreed to and committed ourselves to in writing, 
but I will not elaborate on how and when we will do that. [end 
recording] 
  [Raz] The consultation summoned by the prime minister 
yesterday should be noted in this context. The unpublicized 
session summoned to discuss one issue only: how to tackle the 
PLO's desire to establish political facts in Jerusalem. Israel 
plans to tackle the issue by imposing clear-cut restrictions on 
the Palestinians. 
  Another issue raised by Yitzhaq Rabin was the implementation 
of the Gaza-Jericho agreement. 
  [Begin Rabin recording] The current situation in the field 
is reasonable. For example, if they imprisoned the Palestinian 
officer who would not let Brigadier General Doron Almog travel 
in the Gaza Strip, I think it is a good response. 
  In view of all sorts of reports, I would like to clarify 
that 
to the best of my knowledge -- and we will yet check this 
thoroughly -- not even one Palestinian from the territories has 
joined the police force without our approval. We did not 
approve the return of some deportees proposed by them, and our 
lack of approval prevented their return. [end recording] 
  [Raz] Rabin was referring to reports that Uri Magidish's 
murderers had been inducted into the Palestinian police, and he 
proceeded to deny these reports. The prime minister added -- 
and I have heard him say this more than once this week -- that 
the Palestinian police takes the job seriously. For example, 
the Palestinians stationed 70 more policemen than Israel had 
actually demanded at the Erez checkpoint. The prime minister 
disclosed that Israel would lend metal detectors to the 
Palestinians for the simple reason that security is important to 
us. 
  The prime minister did not say even one word about Ari'el 
Sharon's announcement that he intends to run for the 
premiership. Journalists were waiting outside to get his 
reaction and ask him juicier questions, such as who will be the 
next health minister, but the prime minister would not humor 
them and hastened to leave the place. 
  Earlier in his public address, the prime minister also 
referred to the negotiations with Syria and Syria's intransigent 
position. 
  [Begin Rabin recording] Today, even in my view -- for which 
you are upset with me -- the gaps between Syria and us are still 
broad and deep. This was the situation before, and it remains 
unchanged. [end recording] 
  [Raz] That is what the prime minister had to say with regard 
to the negotiations with Syria which are scheduled to gather 
momentum in two weeks, when the U.S. secretary of state arrives 
for yet another tour in the Middle East. 
  The prime minister spoke about the spread of fundamentalist 
Islam throughout the Middle East and outside. He gave the 
example of Holland, where 10 years ago there was only one mosque 
and today there are dozens. The prime minister said he also 
discerned fundamentalist Islam among Israel's Arabs, but he went 
to great lengths to put it in the proper proportions.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres in </F>
Mexico by Me'ir Einstein -- live] 
  [Text] [Einstein] Good morning sir. 
  [Peres] Good morning. 
  [Einstein] Speaking at a news conference in Mexico, you said 
Israel and Syria were getting closer to opening real 
negotiations. Is there anything new we do not know about? 
  [Peres] I said that whoever wants to normalize relations 
must normalize negotiations. I said that the way to begin 
normalization is through normal negotiations between two 
peoples. That is what I said. 
  [Einstein] Are there any signs that we may be approaching 
such a normalization? 
  [Peres] In my visit in the United States I found an 
atmosphere that still sees a chance to open negotiations, but I 
did not discern any real signs or changes. 
  [Einstein] Sir, the question of Jerusalem is currently on 
the agenda: The prime minister summoned special consultations 
last night to discuss the PLO's demands; we have heard reports 
that the draft Palestinian constitution Jerusalem is mentioned 
as the capital of Palestine. Is Israel prepared to make any 
concessions whatsoever on the question of Jerusalem? 
  [Peres] Not at all, certainly not in the political sphere. 
We are prepared to meet all the needs of worshipers of all 
faiths. Politically speaking, however, it is an absolute and 
irrevocable fact that Jerusalem will remain Israel's united 
capital under Israeli sovereignty. We will not Berlinize 
Jerusalem, even if the PLO passes 1,000 resolutions. 
  [Einstein] But Israel has in fact agreed to discuss the 
status of Jerusalem if the PLO brings it up at the negotiating 
table, which it is expected to do. 
  [Pees] Discussions can be held on anything. What difference 
does it make? It will not change our positions. 
  [Einstein] Is the PLO aware of our categorical position? 
  [Peres] Definitely yes, there is no doubt about it. 
  [Einstein] According to the current scenario, the question 
of Jerusalem is expected to be the last item on the agenda in 
the discussions on the permanent arrangement in the territories. 
  [Peres] We have yet quite a few years ahead of us, and there 
is no need to press the issue. 
  [Einstein] Will our position then be as categorical as it is 
today? 
  [Peres] It will remain unchanged, because there is no need 
for any change. Jerusalem was never an Arab capital, while the 
Jewish people never had any capital other than Jerusalem. 
  [Einstein] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, thank you very 
much. 
  [Peres] You are welcome. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0600 GMT on 27 May 
adds: 
"Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres hailed Britain's decision to 
call off the arms embargo on Israel."]

  [Excerpt] Jerusalem, May 27 (AFP) -- Israel prefers to 
shrug off the remarks of PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat about a 
"jihad" for Jerusalem and will judge the Palestinians on their 
"actions" rather than their words, Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin's spokesman said Thursday [26 May]. 
  "For us, what is important are the actions on the ground and 
not wild statements," spokesman Oded Ben Ami told AFP. 
  Rabin initially reacted angrily to remarks made by 'Arafat 
in 
South Africa urging a "jihad" or holy war to recover Jerusalem 
and implying in veiled terms that Palestinians were not 
necessarily bound by their agreement with Israel. 
  Rabin first talked of sending troops to reconquer the 
autonomous areas but he "soon realised that he risked 
jeopardising the entire peace process and changed his tune," an 
Israeli minister who asked to stay anonymous told AFP Thursday. 
  The minister said Police Minister Moshe Shahal and met [as 
received] two prominent Palestinian leaders from Jerusalem on 
Sunday to convey a warning to the Palestine Liberation 
Organisation (PLO) leader. 
  Shahal told them to tell 'Arafat that his remarks could 
force 
Israel to reject further concessions to the Palestinians, 
because of the effect of his statements on Israeli public 
opinion. 
  "The two Palestinian leaders admitted that their leader had 
no idea of the role of Israeli public opinion and promised to 
get the message to him," the unnamed minister said. [passage

<F P=106> [Report by Arye Dayan and Dov Goldstein] </F>
  [Text] A new line of action is being worked out in 
Israel's top political echelon -- slowing down the peace 
process, being tough with the PLO and 'Arafat, and radicalizing 
pronouncements about our unpreparedness even to discuss the 
future of Jerusalem -- which some ministers believe will 
contribute to improving the government's public standing. 
  Although hardening positions does not include any thought of 
ceasing the negotiations, the government was not far off from 
adopting such a position. 
  The ministers are divided between those -- like Binyamin 
Ben-Eli'ezer -- who support a halt to the negotiations until 
'Arafat makes a public statement about his commitment to the 
interim agreements, and those -- like Peres and Rabin -- who 
believe that they should overlook the violations and base 
themselves on implementation of the agreements on the ground. 
  Foreign Ministry Legal Adviser Yo'el Singer said in a 
special 
interview with Dov Goldstein: "If the Palestinians violate the 
agreements they signed, they will never reach the stage they 
regard as their primary goal, negotiations on the permanent 
settlement." 
  According to Singer, Israel has many ways to react to 
violations of the agreement by the PLO. 
  "We will block the crossing from Gaza and Jericho. Aircraft 
will not land and will not take off from Gaza's airstrip. The 
Palestinians will not fish in the sea and their police vessels 
will not sail along the coast. We will block the Palestinian 
sources of funds. We will not transfer to them customs imposed 
on goods meant for Gaza and Jericho. 
  "We will not transfer to the Palestinians the funds from 
income tax deducted from Palestinians working in Israel. There 
are many other sanctions we can impose. I hope there will be no 
need to impose any of them, but if there will be, Israel will 
not hesitate."

under the conditions enforced last week. The closure was 
imposed last Friday, following the terror attack near the Erez 
checkpoint in which reserves soldiers Moshe Bukra and Erez 
Ben-Barukh were killed. Since the attack the Palestinian police 
have set up roadblocks on the approach roads to entrance from 
the Strip and are stopping and examining local vehicles.

<F P=106> [Report by Sharon Sade] </F>
  [Text] The Defense Ministry is starting to implement a 
plan to evacuate some 25 IDF [Israel Defense Forces] camps and 
bases built on some 3,768 dunams. The land belongs to the 
Israel Lands Administration, and half of it is located in urban 
areas. 
  The defense establishment believes that the relocation will 
cost over 500 million shekels and it wants the Treasury to fund 
the move. At this stage, the defense establishment is focusing 
on the evacuation of nine bases inside urban areas or close to 
them in order to permit the Construction and Housing Ministry to 
build apartments there. These bases are in 'Atlit, Nesher, 
Jerusalem, Yoqne'am, and Haifa. The relocation of the 
antiaircraft school from Herzliyya to the Negev was completed 
several weeks ago and the Defense Ministry was paid 18 million 
shekels for the move. The ministry also received 16 million 
shekels to fund the transfer of warehouses from Yafo to Petah 
Tiqva. The camps will be relocated by private firms. 
  Planning work will start soon on the evacuation of Army's 
headquarters at Haqirya in Tel Aviv after it was agreed that the 
Treasury would transfer some $1.5 million for the planning 
stage. Defense Ministry sources believe that the cost of 
evacuating the southern part of Haqirya, which is spread over 
some 70 dunams, as well as the new construction work, will cost 
some $100 million, and the process will last seven years. The 
new construction will be on the land freed by the relocation of 
the women's hospital at the Haqirya site.

  The move is being taken after it was learned that the 
Palestinians have no means of their own and no funds for food. 
  The problem is that contrary to the situation in Jericho, 
Gaza Strip residents are incapable of donating food and other 
products to the Palestinian police force, especially since it is 
2,400-strong. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Finance Minister Avraham Shohat today told members 
of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee that the 
economic agreement signed with the Palestinians is based on 
intentions to have economic cooperation and that it may 
contribute to the development of ties between Israel and the 
Near East countries. The agreement is good for us and for the 
Palestinians, and it leaves Israel in control over the main 
issues pertaining to our interests, the finance minister 
asserted. 
  Our correspondent Eytan Almog reports that replying to a 
question by Likud chairman Binyamin Netanyahu, the finance 
minister said there are no signs of a Palestinian migration from 
the territories to the Arab countries as a result of the closure. 
  Replying to a question by Beni Begin, Shohat said there is 
no 
need for a Palestinian currency seeing that the agreement does 
not provide for a central Palestinian bank or an independent 
Palestinian economic system. 
  Former Finance Minister Moshe Nisim sharply attacked the 
agreement, saying that as a consequence, compensation will have 
to be paid to Israeli farmers and that industrialists claim it 
will lead to the dismissal of 9,000 workers. Nisim added that 
this is not an economic, but a political and nationalist 
agreement. Minister Shohat replied that the Palestinians signed 
the agreement for economic reasons. They are being subjected to 
heavy pressures by the Arab countries for having signed the 
agreement, and this proves that theirs were economic rather than 
political considerations, the finance minister said.

<F P=106> [Report by military correspondent Eytan Rabin and ITIM] </F>
  [Excerpts] The defense establishment has decided to delay 
the release of hundreds of Palestinian detainees and prisoners 
who were slated to be released today in the framework of the 
release of 5,000 Palestinian prisoners agreed upon with the PLO. 
Security sources yesterday assessed the release process will 
continue early next week. 
  So far some 1,600 detainees and prisoners who signed a 
statement of support for the peace process have been released. 
Some 700 other prisoners are refusing to sign such a statement. 
[passage omitted] 
  PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat has appointed Fatimah Barnawi as 
head of the Palestinian Police women's unit. Barnawi was the 
first Palestinian woman prisoner following the Six-Day War, 
according to a senior Palestinian source in Tunis. 
  Barnawi, 40, was a resident of East Jerusalem. In September 
1967 she was the first one who attempted to carry out an attack 
in Jerusalem, but the bomb she planted in a cinema was 
discovered and safely detonated. 
  Barnawi was incarcerated in Israel until 1977, after which 
she resided in Lebanon. Approximately 10 years ago she settled 
in Tunis. Barnawi is a member of Fatah's Revolutionary Council. 
  Two Palestinian prisoners who were members of Fatah's first 
terror squads, which were headed by Yasir 'Arafat, were released 
yesterday after serving life sentences in the Nabulus prison. 
  The two, Tajj-al-din al-Husayni, 55, and 'Isa al-Qaysi, 60, 
were imprisoned 27 years ago for terrorist activity.

  [Text] The commander of the Central Command decided to 
extend the administrative detention of Kakh activists No'am 
Federman and Ben-Tziyon Gubstein by another three months, our 
correspondent Aviv Bushinsky has learned. The two were 
scheduled to be released in two days, but the Hasharon prison 
authorities received an order to remand them in custody. Our 
correspondent has learned that both the detainees and the police 
were surprised by the news, and the detainees intend to appeal 
it. 
  The High Court of Justice rejected the appeal of Gil'on 
Ben-Sa'id, a Qiryat Arba' settler and a major in the reserves, 
whose weapon was confiscated after the massacre in Hebron. Our 
correspondent Mira Amsalem reports that the judges ruled that 
the commander of the Central Command's decision to confiscate 
his weapon was appropriate and was based on reliable information 
whereby Ben-Sa'id had previously been involved in violent 
activities. Our correspondent points out that a restraining 
order has been in effect against Ben-Sa'id banning him from the 
boundaries of Hebron.

attacks, in which four Israelis have been killed and 13 have 
been wounded, since the signing of the Gaza-Jericho agreement. 
There have been no attacks inside the Green Line, security 
sources told correspondents. 
  They said that immediately after the signing of the 
agreement 
there was a sharp increase in attempted attacks with live 
ammunition against IDF [Israel Defense Forces] installations set 
up in the Qatif Bloc and against IDF patrols. The sources 
stressed that some 200 wanted men, mostly Hamas [Islamic 
Resistance Movement] and Islamic Jihad members, remained at 
large in the territories.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Double-Talk Must Not Be Tolerated"] </F>
  [Text] Not only did Yasir 'Arafat's Johannesburg mosque 
speech call on the Muslims to come and wage jihad for the 
liberation of Jerusalem; in that same speech, the full text of 
which was disclosed only yesterday, he justified his signing of 
the Oslo and Cairo agreements by citing Prophet Muhammad's act: 
The latter signed an agreement with the Mecca tribe of 
Quiraish, but violated it two years later. This historical 
reference implies that the PLO leader reserves the right to 
renege on his agreements with the State of Israel. 
  His attempt to justify his call for jihad for Jerusalem by 
explaining that the term -- which has an undoubtedly military 
connotation -- does not refer to bellicose activity but rather 
to nonviolent struggle, was defined by the prime minister as 
"far-fetched"; it would be equally accurate to describe Yitzhaq 
Rabin's reaction this way. The PLO leader's reference to the 
Muhammad example creates a crisis of confidence with 'Arafat. 
What will Israel be able to rely on if the PLO leader, 
addressing a Muslim audience, apologizes for agreements with 
Israel while citing a precedent from the early days of Islam -- 
a precedent legitimizing the violation of agreements? 
  Israel can understand that 'Arafat must contend with the 
problem of the Islamic fundamentalists' objection to recognizing 
the Jewish state and the agreements, but it does not have to 
tolerate his double-talk. If the PLO leader wants to promote 
the peace process with Israel, he must retract the transparent 
insinuation that he is not bound by the Oslo and Cairo 
agreements and that he even sees himself free to violate them. 
The Israeli Government cannot again settle for the kind of 
mollifying explanations 'Arafat offered following his call for a 
jihad for the liberation of Jerusalem. It is imperative that 
'Arafat declare unequivocally that he acknowledges the validity 
of all the agreements and that he will adhere to them, as he has 
pledged to do. 
  Not only the Declaration of Principles [DOP] and the Cairo 
agreement are at stake. 'Arafat should at last do what he 
promised in a letter to the prime minister on 9 September 1993: 
"The PLO considers that the signing of the DOP constitutes a 
historic event, inaugurating a new epoch of peaceful 
coexistence, free from violence and all other acts which 
endanger peace and stability.... The PLO affirms that those 
articles of the Palestinian Covenant which deny Israel's right 
to exist, and the provisions of the Covenant which are 
inconsistent with the commitments of this letter are now 
inoperative and no longer valid. Consequently, the PLO 
undertakes to submit to the Palestinian National Council [PNC] 
for formal approval the necessary changes in regard to the 
Palestinian Covenant." 
  'Arafat has owed this approval to Israel for over eight 
months. Another postponement must not be tolerated. If he wants 
to establish self-rule in the Gaza Strip and Jericho, he must 
make a concentrated effort to secure the PNC's consent to the 
approval to which Israel is entitled. 
  The PLO chief will do well not to delude himself about the 
gravity of the impact of his Johannesburg remarks. If his 
yearning for a conciliation with Hamas [Islamic Resistance 
Movement] renders his consideration for the State of Israel a 
marginal issue, he should know that the Gaza and Jericho peace 
process will be frozen in its present condition, and there will 
be no continuation of the interim and toward the permanent 
settlements. Unless he sees to it that the clauses in the 
covenant are revoked, he will be unable to regain Israel's trust 
in the PLO's sincerity, and instead of settling in Jericho, 
'Arafat will stay in Tunis.

  [Text] Likud chairman Binyamin Netanyahu has harshly 
reacted to Ari'el Sharon's announcement that he intends to run 
for the premiership in the next elections and called on him to 
leave the Likud. Interviewed by Qol Yisra'el, Netanyahu said 
that Sharon sows conflict and dispute. He conspired against 
Menahem Begin and Yitzhaq Shamir and is now trying to conspire 
against me. The time has come for this intriguer to leave the 
Likud. All Sharon does is undermine, sabotage, and split, 
Netanyahu said. With him, this is a chronic disease. He is a 
man who does not recognize any democratic norms and sets out to 
destroy every framework, the Likud chairman asserted. 
  Sharon told our correspondent Hayim Hecht that he has been 
holding contacts to set up a united front of the right-wing camp 
which would hold primaries before the next elections and decide 
on its candidate. 
  Knesset Member Binyamin Begin told Qol Yisra'el that 
Sharon's 
chances of winning are similar to his chances of becoming the 
world's tennis champion. This is a wrong move which will lead 
to a split in the national camp, Begin said. 
  Tzomet leader Refa'el Eytan said he would run against 
Sharon. 
In his opinion, it could be an advantage if a few candidates of 
the national camp ran in the first round of elections.

    [Editorial report] Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew on 26 May 
carries a 1,500-word article by Amnon Barzilay on page B3, in 
the "I Saw, I Heard" daily column, discussing the current 
situation of the National Religious Party [NRP]. The article 
says that NRP leader Zvulun Hammer recently held separate 
meetings with Likud's David Levi and Ari'el Sharon "in an 
attempt to reconciliate between the two," "in a move coordinated 
with Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu," hoping to follow this 
with "the second stage of setting up the right-wing shadow 
government." 
  After holding the meetings, however, Hammer realized "the 
chances of rehabilitating the Likud leadership are slim." 
Hammer found that Levi wants to act as foreign minister, and 
that Sharon will never be candidate for construction and housing 
minister if Tzomet Chairman Refa'el Eytan is promised the 
defense portfolio. This further added to the feeling of 
frustration the NRP leadership is currently experiencing. It is 
frustrated because "its dream of Jewish settlements in the 
territories is collapsing, and they can do nothing to stop the 
process." The frustration grew even bigger in view of the 
"irreversible processes" of the "tightening political 
cooperation between Labor and SHAS [Torah Observing Sephardim], 
as the latter returns to the coalition, and the socioeconomic 
cooperation between SHAS and Meretz" in the Histadrut labor 
federation. NRP leaders blame Netanyahu and their cooperation 
with the Likud. Party officials last week claimed that only NRP 
activists show up for demonstrations against government policies 
claiming: "We are their black laborers. Netanyahu comes to our 
demonstrations, delivers a speech, and goes home." 
  The NRP heads expect a shift in the right-wing religious 
public sentiment toward them, believing that the Likud, Moledet, 
and Tehiya parties will support them in the next elections, 
gaining them additional "two or three Knesset seats," but some 
NRP leaders believe this will not be enough to get them out of 
the opposition. Also, the NRP is in serious financial distress. 
"The unexpected Labor defeat in the Histadrut elections will be 
followed by the collapse of the secret financial deals between 
Histadrut and the NRP," Barzilay says, noting that "the party 
still has debts of some 5 million shekels from the local 
elections."

<F P=106> [Report by party affairs correspondent Yerah Tal] </F>
  [Excerpts] Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin called 
yesterday for the immediate establishment of a new Israeli 
democratic party to be created by a merger between Meretz and 
Labor. Speaking before the Labor's dovish Mashov circle, Beilin 
said that the move should begin at the Histadrut labor 
federation by merging Hayim Ramon's list with Labor and should 
extend to all the other activities by the parties. 
  "We would have an 80-percent majority in the Histadrut and 
56 
Knesset seats, which would make us as dominant as the Labor 
Movement was at its peak," Beilin said. According to him, past 
differences between Meretz and Labor no longer exist. He added 
that a merger now would allow Ramon to implement all the reforms 
he has planned as Histadrut secretary general, with Labor 
assisting him. [passage omitted] 
  Knesset Member Ya'el Dayan rejected Beilin's idea, saying 
that a merger is possible only between Meretz and the Labor 
doves. Any other combination would only cause a rift, she said. 
She believes there is room for such a merger in the Histadrut, 
but talk of a merger on the parliamentary level is premature. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English at 1000 GMT on 23 May 
carries a report by Dani Gur-Arye with the following "fast and 
furious" political reactions to the offer: "Meretz leader 
Shulamit Aloni said the two parties have much in common, but 
also many differences. She said it is still early to determine 
if such a union is plausible. Yosi Sarid said the Meretz 
parties should unite first, before considering a union with 
Labor." The report adds that "Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin 
criticized Beilin for the remark, saying his timing, following 
the Histadrut elections, could not have been worse. Rabin said 
a joint Labor-Meretz party would alienate middle-of-the-road 
voters. Without the support of those voters, he said, the new 
Israeli democratic party would be destined for the opposition."]

  [Text] Israel has welcomed the British Government's 
decision to lift the arms embargo. Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi 
Beilin in an interview with our reporter Jack Katzenell 
described the lifting of the embargo as a very important 
decision. 
  [Begin recording] [Beilin] Of course, it has a symbolic 
effect, but it has also a very realistic impact because it will 
enable us to participate in bids of selling arms to Britain, 
which will include British components, and that can happen only 
when the embargo is lifted, and when the British can sell us 
those components. 
  [Katzenell] So, do you think that this embargo, which has 
lasted 12 years, has it done Israel a great deal of harm, or has 
it been mainly a kind of slap in the face, something moral or 
symbolic? 
  [Beilin] Both. This embargo was decided upon during the war 
in Lebanon in 1982. It was a European decision, and only 
Britain decided to continue the embargo. In our visits to 
London and the meetings with British officials, we raised this 
issue. I raised it with Secretary Hurd exactly two weeks ago, 
and I said to him that it is really inexplicable to continue the 
embargo after the agreement which has been signed between us and 
the PLO, and against the background of the development towards 
this in the Middle East, and I believe that those talks with the 
British helped us in putting an end to this embargo. [end

  [Text] Today, (Wednesday) 25.5.94, the government 
unanimously decided to accept the recommendation of REFA'EL 
[Armament Development Authority] general manager, Brig. Gen. 
(ret.) Yitzhaq Gat, and a commission led by Prof. Yehoshu'a 
Yortner to take steps to turn REFA'EL to a government-owned 
company. Part of the company will be profit oriented and 
operated on a government provided budget. REFA'EL, the Armament 
Development Authority, is currently a division of the Ministry 
of Defense. 
  To carry out its decision, the government assigned the 
Ministries of Defense and Finance to create a steering committee 
and subcommittees to deal with as soon as possible funding, 
equity, property, land, manpower, legal, economic, and contract 
issues. The government appointed REFA'EL management to 
negotiate with the workers in order to reach work and salary 
agreements.

  [Excerpts] First to the dramatic disclosure that Israel 
and the Vatican are formulating an agreement in which the 
Catholic Church accepts indirect responsibility for 
anti-Semitism from ancient times up to the Holocaust. We have 
more details in this report from Dick Winter: 
  [Begin Winter recording] The historic agreement, which was 
drafted by an interreligious commission from Israel and the 
Vatican, states that a frightful mixture of racism, along with 
religious, political, social, and economic hostility against the 
Jewish people throughout history, created the basis for the 
Holocaust, and the Catholic Church did not do enough to oppose 
it. 
  One of the chief Israeli members of the commission, Rabbi 
David Rosen, says the draft is a major achievement and that the 
Vatican goes farther than even he ever expected it to go. 
[passage omitted] 
  Also in the document: the Vatican's acceptance of 
responsibility for creating in its teachings an atmosphere of 
hatred toward the Jewish people. Rabbi Rosen says he believes 
that the draft agreement will now be endorsed by the Pope. [end

  [Text] Tripoli, al Maa' [May] 24, JAMAHIRIYAH NEWS AGENCY 
-- Successive phone calls were underway throughout the 'Aid al 
Adhah ['Id al-Adha] holiday between the leader of the revolution 
and the Yemeni leaders 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid in the ongoing efforts by the leader to bring an end to 
the suffering and destruction in Yemen. Over the last 24 hours 
telephone calls were exchanged between the various parties with 
the leader emphasizing the stance adopted by the Arab world and 
its revolutionary forces vis a vis division and those who 
support division. The leader said that it did not suit the 
revolutionaries of Aden to be in favour of division. 
  However, 'Ali Salim al-Bid explained to the leader of the 
revolution the reasons for his decision to break away but also 
expressed his willingness to search for any way out of the 
current sitution to restore the unity of Yemen even if at his 
expense. 
  The contacts made with 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih revolved mainly 
around a search for a political solution which would guarantee 
Yemeni unity, which would bring an end to the fighting and 
prevent further bloodshed.

<F P=106> [Speech by Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi at a mass rally in Gharyan </F>
on 26 May -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] Brothers, we meet today with our kinfolk in 
Gharyan, this historic town; Gharyan has a historic significance 
regarding the lives of the people. Once again, our voices rise 
from the lofty mountains of Gharyan. [passage omitted] 
  Libyan people have now realized the truth of what we have 
said here brothers. Libyan people, brothers, are aware of all 
that we have said. We have stated that what happened in Iraq 
was bound to happen in every Arab country. They said no, 
because Iraq occupied Kuwait. 
  We now have Yemen which is being divided and torn part as 
was 
Iraq. Did Yemen occupy Kuwait? Come on, answer me, you 
reactionaries; you the agents of the United States. Why don't 
you answer this question? This Yemen which is being torn part 
by U.S. Arab reaction and Israeli plots, did it occupy Kuwait? 
You claimed that Iraq was torn apart because it occupied Kuwait. 
  Now, Yemen is being divided, did Yemen occupy Kuwait? We 
said that what happened in Iraq will take place in every Arab 
country. This is now happening before our own eyes in Yemen. 
What is happening in Yemen is a reactionary Arab-U.S. plot so 
that Yemen will not be a strong country; so that there will not 
be a strong republic in the Arab peninsula. This is an exposed 
scheme; Arab reaction has been exposed in this plot. The role 
of the United States is clear and exposed. Those who received 
orders from Washington to divide Yemen admitted before the whole 
world that they were in the United States and received their 
order there. 
  Brothers, who can be fooled by these lies? Who can be fooled 
by these fabrications? The Arab reaction, which is siding with 
the United States, is responsible for the destruction of the 
people of Iraq, the land and Iraq; the killing of the children 
of Iraq, and the starvation of our people in Iraq. They claimed 
that they did so because of Kuwait. 
  Now the Arab reaction, which allies itself with the United 
States, is tearing Yemen apart bit by bit. It is killing the 
children of Yemen. What will the cowardly reaction which is 
allied with its imperialist master say? Will it say that Yemen 
was implicated in Kuwait, that it occupied Kuwait? We say to 
the simpletons in the rest of the Arab countries that your turn 
is certainly coming. Arab oil which is under imperialist 
control will be used to the last drop against the future, the 
dignity, and the freedom of the Arab nation. It has been 
decided to use the last drop of Arab oil which America controls 
against the Arab nation. The turns of Syria, Egypt, Algeria, and 
Sudan are coming, just as the blockade and the confrontation 
that have now been imposed on Libya. [passage omitted] 
  The partitioning of Iraq will lead to the partitioning of 
another Arab country. This has now been achieved. This is now 
the conspiracy in Yemen. They provide justifications for each 
Arab country which are different from those for a previous Arab 
country. 
  We say to the stupid who think that they are safe by being 
submissive and agents of the West, we say to them that western 
imperialism, the coward Arab reactionary forces and Zionism, 
this filthy bloc, are determined to tear the Arab nation apart 
and to trample down every single inch of Arab land and divide it 
again into states of factions. 
  History is repeating itself. It is only here that the voice 
of freedom is raised. Here in Gharyan the homeland, with the 
voice of the free people, we say to them, to the old and 
contemporary Arab tribes who have populated Libya, that 
confrontation starts here, preparation starts here, and we 
accept the challenge. We do not bargain, we do not recognize, 
and we do not give up. 
  We say to them that all their attempts and pressure to force 
the free people of Libya to kneel down, are hopeless. We say to 
them that free Libya, revolutionary Libya will not recognize the 
enemy, will not yield to him, and will not give up the Arab 
nation's future. We are prepared to pay with our blood for 
every single particle of sand. 
  We are raiising our voice, here in Gharyan, with the sons 
and 
grandsons of the heroes and martyrs of the Jandubah and 
al-A'aqib battles and the historic al-Jabal battles. [passage 
omitted] 
  Now you can see everything. The reactionary and imperialist 
alliance has been exposed. We told you that the United States 
has controlled Mecca; they refused to believe us. Yet we found 
Libyan pilgrims barred from travelling on board their planes to 
perform the pilgrimage; they were forced to use camels because 
of an order emanating from the United States, Britain, and 
France. The sacred Qa'bah is now being subjected to an order 
from the United States, Britain, and France. This is sad. It 
is sad what has happened to the holy and sacred Qa'bah. 
  Brothers, the Qa'bah is no longer sacred because it is being 
subjected to an order from the United States, Britain, and 
France. It is being governed by orders decreed by nonbelievers 
and Christians. We now find that the cross is more sacred than 
the Qa'bah; the cross is more significant and important than the 
minarets, no matter how tall they may be, I regret to say. The 
sound of the church bells is now lounder than the voice of the 
mu'ezzin in Mecca and holy al-Madina. The sound of the bells of 
Christian churches, the churches of the United States, Britain, 
and France is stronger and lounder than the voice of any Mecca 
and Medina mu'ezzin. This is a bitter reality. Brothers, the 
jihad has become better than pilgrimage, brothers. 
  Not a single one of those submissive people felt an iota of 
shame when they saw Libyan women riding camels or walking to 
perform the pilgrimage, because they were observing a resolution 
that was adopted by anti-Arab states. They were implementing an 
unjust resolution that was adopted by the United States, 
Britain, and France by which they wanted to bring the Arab 
nation to bow to their will. They seek to put on trial the sons 
of the Arab nation within their homeland. They also want to try 
them in the United States and Britain. 
  We would like to tell them no, and a thousand times no. We 
are ready for the confrontation. We are ready for any ensuing 
repercussions for the sake of our dignity, our future, 
independence, and honor. We are ready for sacrifice. Forward 
we go, and the struggle continues.

  [Text] Tripoli, Al Maa' [May] 25, JAMAHIRIYAH NEWS AGENCY-- 
The international editor of the Jamahiriyah News Agency 
commented on the lecture given by Anthony Lake, the national 
security adviser to the American president, to the Institute of 
Middle Eastern Policy on the 17th of Al Maa'[May] which 
reaffirmed the American policy of domination in the Arab region 
as well as the basis for this policy which revolves around 
attempts to dominate the resources of the region while 
guaranteeing the security of the Israeli occupiers who are a 
tool for American imperialist policy in the region. 
  The editor said that the comments by the advisor to the 
American president demonstrated the mad frenzy of the 
imperialists resulting from their military domination of the 
world. The editor said that the ideas which came out in this 
lecture truly expresses the new wave of colonialism, occupation 
and invasion which has prevailed. He said this showed that there 
was a dreary future on the horizon which threatens peace, 
security and stability and will abort the peaceful process of 
development of all nations.

  [Text] It has been announced in New York that four Arab 
Muslims who were accused in the World Trade Center bombing case 
have been sentenced to 240 years in prison. 
  The JANA international affairs editor commented on this 
sentence, saying: The sentence passed on those four has no 
meaning other than the destruction and utmost degradation of a 
human being's humanity and his sense of it. 
  In this regard, the editor referred to what the brother 
leader of the revolution said in his address at the final 
emergency session of the General People's Congress six years 
ago, in which he revealed the repressive methods practiced in 
America against human beings and their humanity. 
  He said that a 50-year-old person in America, for example, 
is 
given a prison sentence of 100 years. Since this person knows 
that he will not live for this period, the sentence is 
contemptuous of the human psyche--destroying and degrading 
it--and humiliates and harms that person at that moment when the 
sentence is passed. 
  The editor asks where the human rights are that they brag 
about in the West if these are their practices that do not give 
the slightest value to the human being. At the very least, 
these practices can be described as barbaric, savage, and brutal.

  [Excerpts] King Juan Carlos I, the Spanish monarch, and 
Queen Sofia, his wife, continued the state visit they are paying 
to our country. The two esteemed Spanish guests' activities 
this evening included a visit to the National Assembly, where 
Assembly President Shaykh Sid'Ahmed Ould Baba and Senate Speaker 
Dieng Boubou Farba welcomed them. 
  During this visit, the Spanish royal delegation listened to 
a 
speech delivered by the president of the National Assembly on 
behalf of the two chambers of the parliament, which convened on 
this occasion. The Spanish monarch delivered a reply speech, in 
which he lauded the Mauritanian democratic experience. 
  Colleague Mohamed Abdallah Ould Amin has a report on this 
visit: 
  [Begin recording] [Ould Amin] [passage omitted] In a reply 
speech, the Spanish monarch, King Juan Carlos I, said: 
  [Juan Carlos, in Spanish fading into Arabic translation] 
When we crossed the gates of this wide and luminous Sahara, we 
recalled Ibn Khaldun, who was of a Spanish Islamic origin and 
was among those who founded sociology, the creed that reminds us 
that Mauritania was the offspring of the great Sahara and that 
it is a melting pot for various cultures, elements, and races. 
According to Ibn Khaldun, the development of historic events, 
despite its variation, could be summarized in a simplified 
portrayal and centers on two different and integral elements: 
bedouin and urbanite. [passage omitted] 
  As I address you today, I cannot but refer to these distant 
sources of our common history because I find them fresh in the 
memory and appropriate in status. This is because of the fact 
that the Mauritanian parliament--which represents one of the 
phenomena of national sovereignty and a legitimate 
representation of the noble Mauritanian people--is the fruit of 
a vital democratic process and is liable to result in a 
Mauritania with more vitality, freedom, justice, and progress in 
accordance with its traditions and appreciative of its past 
generations. 
  The democratic vitality of your people is the best guarantee 
to continue the enormous effort that you have made to arrive at 
a balanced economic growth capable of integrating the people and 
the cultures in your country, with the respect of human rights 
according to the preamble of the Mauritanian Constitution. 
[passage omitted] 
  Mr. President, honorable parliamentarians, because of your 
geographical and historical position, you are eligible to become 
the link between the Arab Maghreb and Africa south of the 
Sahara. I am aware that it is a very difficult task. However, 
it is, at the same time, an important incentive that depends on 
dialogue with neighboring countries and on finding quiet 
settlements to all differences and on the fruits of the efforts 
exerted in this field. 
  On the regional level, Mauritania is considered an active 
member within the Arab Maghreb Union, due to the energies it 
employ in this field. 
  Spain values the actions and initiatives undertaken with the 
aim of achieving economic integration in this region. [passage 
omitted] 
  Spain will support every effort that will lead toward the 
settlement of the problem of the Western Sahara according to the 
UN secretary general's peace plan. This will enhance the 
prospects of regional integration. 
  Within the EU, Spain will continue its policy, which aims at 
making Mauritania benefit as much as possible from all the 
allowances and activities on which the European-Maghreb 
cooperation is based. 
  In the various international organizations, Spain will 
continue its support for Mauritania's strong efforts at 
modernization in the economic and social fields. [passage 
omitted] 
  The foreign ministers of our two countries signed today a 
joint declaration that consecrated a collection of political 
principles aimed at consolidating bilateral cooperation in 
numerous fields. 
  I am confident that everyone shares the belief in the 
importance of fulfilling these aims because they include the 
aspirations for a better future for our peoples as we approach 
a new century. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] Cairo, 26 May (MENA) -- Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, 
former Yemeni prime minister and 'Ali Salim al-Bid's envoy, left 
Cairo this evening after a one-day visit to Egypt. 
  In a news conference held before he left, he paid tribute to 
President Husni Mubarak's efforts to end the fighting in Yemen. 
Mubarak's mediation is needed more now than ever before to save 
the Yemeni people from successive disasters, al-'Attas said. He 
stressed that the Yemeni people feel proud of and grateful to 
Egypt's president, government, and people. He praised the role 
played by the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia to restore 
peace in Yemen. 
  He said the recently formed government in Aden stresses its 
desire to stop the Yemeni war without any conditions and is 
willing for a direct dialogue with the northerners to find 
serious solutions to the crisis, ones that will take the 
interests of the people into consideration. The dialogue should 
be based on equality and frankness, and the north should not 
express any reservations about the participants, he said. 
  Al-'Attas blamed Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and 
the General People's Congress for aborting Yemeni unity. The 
dismissal of southern ministers and ambassadors means 
separation, and so does imposing unity by occupation, he said. 
  Al-'Attas accused Sanaa of going back on the Pledge and 
Accord Document, which he said "enjoyed the support of all the 
Yemeni people." He said President Salih declared war against 
the Yemeni nation, took away freedoms, and exceeded his 
constitutional powers when he declared emergency rule and 
unilaterally abrogated all the minutes that preceded the 
proclamation of unity between the two parts of Yemen. 
  He said the detention of a number of nationalists and the 
disappearance of known political leaders like 'Abd-al-Quddus 
al-Midwahi, Muhammad 'Abd-al-Mu'min, 'Abd-al-Habib Salim, and 
'Ali Salih 'Ayyad strengthens the conviction that the authority 
in Sanaa is canceling its constitutional legitimacy. 
  Mr. al-'Attas said Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's 
decision to storm and loot homes of the leaders of the Yemeni 
Socialist Party and other parties and to use those leaders as 
human shields to protect his palace and his tribe from air raids 
indicates that his acts, including the war decision, were 
illegitimate. 
  He said Yemen today is being subjected to a crushing war 
imposed by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and the elements allied with 
him, with military and financial support from Iraq and Sudan, to 
implement a joint scheme that Aden is determined to confront and 
foil. 
  Asked about the possibility of restoring Yemeni unity if the 
battles stop, al-'Attas said in his news conference that such an 
action will not take the form of merger unity as in 1990. He 
explained that many issues need to be discussed before the 
restoration of unity, such as relations with Yemen and relations 
with Arab countries. 
  Asked about the international efforts being made to arrange 
a 
cease-fire in Yemen, al-'Attas said that during his recent visit 
to Washington he sensed a sincere international desire led by 
the United States and the Arab countries to end the fighting. 
He blessed these efforts and noted Egypt's decision in the 
early sixties not to go to war against Syria when the latter 
decided to secede from the United Arab Republic. 
  Al-'Attas ruled out the fall of Aden at the hands of the 
northern Yemeni forces. He stressed that Aden is a strong front 
that is difficult to occupy. If the aggression against Aden 
continues for long, he said, then "we will be compelled to 
request assistance from the fraternal countries." 
  Al-'Attas said that irrespective of the results of the 
current battle in Yemen, it cannot determine the future of the 
country. He admitted that the northern forces made some gains 
and occupied some regions, but he described the military 
statements issued by Sanaa as exaggerated. 
  He stressed that Sanaa supports extremists and 
fundamentalists to use them for political assassinations in 
Yemen. He pointed out that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih has not yet 
signed a draft law on education because the Yemeni Reform 
Grouping, which is a religious party, is opposing it. 
  Al-'Attas explained that the recently proclaimed Democratic 
Republic of Yemen in the south was meant to stop the bloodshed 
and to prevent Yemen from disintegrating into many mini-states. 
He said the new state does not need de jure international 
recognition. He said the government of this republic pledges to 
work with all national forces to strengthen the foundations of 
security and stability and to hold municipal elections within 
one year. It also commits itself to implementing all provisions 
of the Pledge and Accord Document. 
  Al-'Attas said this republic is eager to establish strong 
relations with the Arabian Peninsula countries and with Egypt 
and Syria, and is now working to restore its right to membership 
in the Arab League, the Islamic Conference Organization, and the 
United Nations.

  [Text] Cairo, 26 May (MENA) -- AL-AKHBAR stresses that 
Israel's kidnapping a Lebanese resistance leader from his home 
in a south Lebanese village and transferring him to Israel under 
the pretext of obtaining information about an Israeli navigator 
whose plane was shot down over Lebanon eight years ago is an act 
that no country that respects itself and its reputation would 
commit. It is a crime of piracy, something we thought Yitzhaq 
Rabin's government had abandoned. 
  The paper says in its editorial of tomorrow, Friday, that 
such acts will apparently remain part of Israel's policy as long 
as the remnants of the old generation of state leaders, or the 
old guard, remain in power. We cannot see any country raiding 
the territory of another sovereign state for any reason, the 
paper says. 
  AL-AKHBAR asks whether the United Nations and the Security 
Council would have [words indistinct] if such an act, which 
flagrantly violates every law and convention, had been committed 
by a state other than Israel. 
  The paper hopes Rabin will think again and ask himself if 
the 
kidnapping of a Lebanese citizen, no matter what the charge, 
merits endangering the peace process, which had begun to bear 
fruit.

  [Text] Cairo, 27 May (MENA) -- AL-AHRAM Chief Editor 
Ibrahim Nafi' has revealed that during a secret meeting some 
time ago, Hasan al-Turabi's group and the executive group in 
power in Sudan decided to strike at Egyptian-Sudanese relations 
by adopting 14 anti-Egyptian measures. 
  In an article published in today's issue, Nafi' notes that 
the recent Sudanese measures against Egyptian interests in 
Khartoum are part of this strategy, which is directed against 
Egypt and its historic ties with sisterly Sudan. He points out 
that these measures include an attempt to undermine the Egyptian 
presence in Sudan and to incite the Sudanese masses against 
Egypt. 
  Nafi' explains that by taking over Egyptian property, the 
government in Khartoum wanted to mask the failure of the Nairobi 
talks to find a peaceful solution to the armed struggle in south 
Sudan, an issue to which the Sudanese people, stricken by war 
and poverty, pay much attention. He adds that by adopting 
anti-Egyptian measures, the Khartoum government wants to focus 
attention away from the rising acts of opposition inside Sudan, 
the latest being violent demonstrations in western and central 
Sudan recently. Nafi' adds that the ruling regime in Sudan 
wants to cast doubts on the firmness of Egypt's position in 
support of the unity of the Sudanese people and Sudan's 
territorial integrity by claiming that Egypt cares about Sudan's 
unity only because it cares about its interests in Sudan. He 
asks: Where are these Egyptian interests in Sudan in which 
nobody has any interest any longer, after suffering poverty and 
seeing destruction and millions giving up hope of finding food 
and shelter under this bad regime? 
  Nafi' points out that the regime in Sudan also wants to hide 
Sudan's deteriorating economic conditions, which have become a 
source of ridicule for Sudanese inside and outside Sudan. The 
middle class, a prosperous class for which Sudan has been 
famous, no longer exists in the country, where poverty has 
become widespread and those who can afford to live are members 
of the ruling clique or key figures in the al-Turabi [Islamic] 
front who have become top businessmen. To give an example of 
the bad conditions in Sudan, Nafi' notes that when it took 
power, the al-Bashir regime said it had come to save the country 
before a dollar could be traded for 20 Sudanese pounds. At the 
time of the revolution, a dollar bought 12 Sudanese pounds. Now 
a dollar buys 500 Sudanese pounds, he adds. 
  Thus, Nafi' notes, the Sudanese people have failed to catch 
up with the rise in prices and are leading a bitter life. Some 
even wonder how the Sudanese people can live under these tough 
conditions. The AL-AHRAM chief editor says that the ruling 
regime in Sudan is instigating trouble with Egypt to whip up 
public sentiment and thereby camouflage the host of problems it 
is having with other countries and international organizations. 
  Sudan, Ibrahim Nafi' points out, has been repeatedly 
condemned by the United Nations for its human rights violations. 
Eritrea filed a complaint against it with the United Nations 
over its interference in its internal affairs, accusing it of 
harboring subversive Eritrean elements. The U.S. Congress is 
putting pressure on Clinton's administration to take firmer 
action against Sudan because it has become a haven for terrorist 
elements. 
  The ruling regime in Khartoum, with its recent measures 
against Egypt, also hopes to divert attention from its role in 
fomenting the current armed struggle in Yemen. Millionaire 
Usamah Bin-Ladin, whose country [Saudi Arabia] has annulled his 
citizenship, has set up a state within a state in Sudan. 
Bin-Ladin ordered his followers in Pakistan and Afghanistan to 
go to Yemen via Sudan and fight on the side of the northern 
troops, Ibrahim Nafi' writes. 
  The Sudanese regime, with the measures it has taken, aims to 
test Egypt's resolve before it proceeds to the issue of water. 
But once it gets there it will no longer be gauging reactions. 
It will be taking direct action that will provoke an equally 
direct reaction, Nafi' declares. 
  The AL-AHRAM chief editor concludes his article by saying 
that the Sudanese regime is swimming against the tide of 
history. Eighty percent of the Sudanese people know that. They 
also know that Sudan is passing through a gloomy phase.

<F P=106> [From the "The World Today" program presented by Tim Haynes </F>
-- italicized passages are recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [chanting] [Haynes] Chanting and tear gas at a 
demonstration in Cairo last week. The chants are coming from 
around 2,000 Egyptian lawyers. The tear gas and rubber bullets 
were fired by riot police who were determined to prevent the 
demonstration from taking place. The lawyers were angry at the 
death of one of their number, 'Abd-al-Harith Madani, who died in 
police custody. They say he was tortured to death. The 
Government say he had an asthma attack. Muhammad 'Abd-al-Mun'im 
is a spokesman for President Husni Mubarak: 
  ['Abd-al-Mun'im] First of all, we have to say that the 
lawyers--it's not all the lawyers, it's some group of the 
lawyers in the syndicate, you know. And they are claiming that 
he was killed by getting tortured, he was killed. Then this is 
not true, you know. He got some sort of an asthma attack and he 
died. That's it. 
  [Haynes] Friends of Mr. Madani say he had no history of 
breathing problems. The Egyptian Human Rights Organization also 
has serious doubts about the Government's explanation. Karim 
al-Rawi is its deputy secretary general. 
  [Al-Rawi] On the 26th of April, the State Security 
officers entered the premises of 'Abd-al-Harith Madani and held 
him there and other lawyers in his offices for three hours, and 
then took him away. To the best of our knowledge, the next day 
he was removed to al-Qasr al-'Ayni Hospital, to the prisoners' 
wing, and died shortly afterwards. The Government maintained 
that he died of an asthma attack. But eyewitness accounts of 
the body revealed that there are signs of torture, chain marks 
round the feet which indicate that he must have been suspended 
for several hours, and marks on the back and on the chest 
showing that he had been beaten. 
  [Haynes] The Government has accused Mr. Madani of having 
close ties with the illegal group al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah, a 
fundamentalist organization which wants to establish an Islamic 
state in Egypt. Although Egypt is a Muslim society, it's a 
secular state which doesn't allow any political representation 
by religious groups. Al-Jama'ah has pursued a two-year campaign 
of bombings and shootings against the Egyptian Government. And 
it has also targeted foreign tourists, putting a sizeable dent 
in one of the country's biggest foreign currency earners. So 
what is al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah, and why have its members turned 
to violence? Maha 'Azzam is an associate fellow at the Royal 
United Services Institute [RUSI] in London and she is a writer 
on Middle Eastern affairs. 
  ['Azzam] Al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah, I think, can best be 
described as a political protest group that is dedicated to 
bruising the existing regime. It has opted for the use of 
violence given (obviously?) the situation in which all channels 
for political participation and legitimate political opposition 
have been blocked by the regime, and given what it feels is the 
use of violence against the group by the regime itself. It is 
dedicated to the establishment of a state based on the shari'ah. 
Obviously, it is aware of the economic situation in Egypt and 
what it sees as the corruption at government level and at other 
levels, which it believes ought to be weeded out. And it is 
concerned with issues such as social justice. 
  [Haynes] The Government has taken a hard line in reaction to 
al-Jama'ah, choosing to treat members as terrorists rather than 
Islamic fundamentalists. Muhammad 'Abd-al-Mun'im is President 
Mubarak's spokesman. 
  ['Abd-al-Mun'im] I believe the name is not quite 
correct. You know, they are not fundamentalists; they are not 
Muslims; they are just terrorists. I assure you that many of 
them, you know, don't know the ABC's of Islam. They don't 
recitate [word as heard] anything; they know nothing, you know. 
And this was proven by the investigation. They are not Muslim. 
And incidentally, you know, Islam is the religion of tolerance. 
It has nothing to do with what is happening. Terrorism is 
another thing. So these people are protecting themselves and 
claiming that they are Muslims so that they can win the sympathy 
of the society they are living in. But the actual thing that is 
taking place now is that they have lost all sympathy with the 
society. Nobody likes them. 
  [Haynes] Although a large number of Egyptians do seem to be 
revolted by the use of violence by al-Jama'ah, others are 
reported to have reservations about the level of Government 
response: Detention without trial, persistent allegations of 
torture, capital punishment for those found guilty of terrorism, 
and strong suggestions of a shoot-to-kill policy among the 
police. [passage omitted] 
  President Mubarak has a strong interest in limiting the 
effects of al-Jama'ah's activities. Not only does he want to 
avoid facing a rising tide of Islamic emotion at home, but his 
Government's reputation as a solid, influential, pro-Western 
power in the region is at stake. [passage omitted] 
  Al-Jama'ah is not the only Islamic group which is a thorn 
in the government's side. The Muslim Brotherhood is also an 
illegal organization, but has far more widespread support 
throughout the country, is more moderate, and denounces 
violence. It is therefore seen to pose a greater long-term 
threat to the government. Maha 'Azzam of RUSI: 
  ['Azzam] I think, in terms of the objectives of either 
the al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah or the objectives of other Islamist 
groups that are more moderate, there is a general feeling of 
sympathy throughout Egyptian society for, for instance, 
implementation of the shari'ah, for the greater Islamization of 
Egyptian society, for greater respect for the rule of law, for 
opposition to what is seen as corruption at high levels, for 
closing the gap between the rich and the poor. There are some 
very general aspects to the cry, if you like, of al-Jama'ah 
al-Islamiyah and others more moderate, perhaps, that I think 
echoes the feelings of many in Egyptian society. 
  [Haynes] Egypt faces acute social and economic problems. The 
Government is implementing an economic reform program involving 
a reduction in the size of Egypt's public sector and an 
increased privatization program. So far, there have been 
successes. Inflation is down, foreign exchange reserves and the 
balance of payments are healthy, and the currency is stable. 
But any benefits from these measures haven't been evenly 
distributed. A few rich people have got richer, but the 
majority have yet to see any change. [passage omitted] 
  The main groups, the Muslim Brotherhood and the al-Jama'ah, 
both seek social and political change. Responding to criticism 
of its involvement in the lawyers' protest, the Muslim 
Brotherhood has said it's denounced violence and was not to 
blame for any conflicts. A spokesman went on to point out that 
the lack of response to people's needs, delays in improving 
public works, the loss of human rights, and the lack of 
sufficient guarantees for free elections leads to worry, fear, 
and a deterioration in conditions. The Government has paid lip 
service to the idea of political pluralism, but it's drawn the 
line at including any Islamic parties--a move criticized by both 
Islamists and secular intellectuals as a lost opportunity to 
popularize the Government. So why does the Government exclude 
the religious parties? Maha 'Azzam: 
  ['Azzam]I think the Government's problem is with 
allowing any opposition that would truly question the policies 
of the regime and the Government--whether it had been a 
secular-oriented opposition or an Islamic-oriented 
opposition--that question the very basis and legality of those 
in power or wanted a reform of the Constitution, then the 
Government would have problems with this. 
  [Haynes] Some people feel that Mr. Mubarak's Government is 
becoming increasingly authoritarian and that any move toward 
democratization is unlikely. Some observers have looked at the 
past two years of violence and seen similarities with events in 
Algeria where Islamic fundamentalists have been involved in 
protracted violence in protest at their exclusion from 
Government after winning elections in 1992. But conditions in 
Egypt are different, not least because of Egypt's long history 
of strong central authority. But Karim al-Rawi of the Egyptian 
Human Rights Organization feels Mr. Mubarak is using the current 
violence in Egypt as a means of stifling democracy. 
  [Al-Rawi]The regime has used this present climate of 
violence as an excuse not to democratize any further and to 
maintain control and to accuse anybody who disagrees with it, or 
who asks for accountability, accuses them of being pro-Islamist, 
of being pro-terrorist, and that is the new phrase now that they 
use. So those of us who ask for accountability are being accused 
of being terrorists. And so it's a regime that is entering a 
stage where it brooks no criticism. And that is a very 
disturbing situation. 
  [Haynes] Following further attacks on a tourist train in 
southern Egypt on Friday night and al-Jama'ah's renewed call for 
a holy war last weekend, Mr. Mubarak is left to work out how to 
stop the violence. According to Maha 'Azzam, his current policy 
isn't working. 
  ['Azzam]Mr. Mubarak's policy of treating this problem 
mainly as a security issue and as a terrorist problem, will not 
make the problem go away. As we have seen, it has carried on 
for the past couple of years and has actually got worse. There 
is a clear advantage to opening up the political system, in 
allowing, for instance, the Muslim Brotherhood a say in 
government, in putting an end to emergency laws, and that 
security police tactics of torture and imprisonment without 
trial, and so on, are curtailed. 
  [Haynes] Those who seek change in Egypt have found few signs 
so far that President Mubarak is willing to concede any ground 
to the country's Islamic fundamentalists. Using the argument 
that if he allowed representation for Islamists, he would have 
to include all religions and that religion and politics are and 
should be two separate things, he sticks to the idea of truly 
secular government. But for Maha 'Azzam of the RUSI, his policy 
of excluding these groups from a share of power ignores Egypt's 
problems and points up the need for the very changes he is 
resisting. 
  ['Azzam]There is certainly discontent with the economic 
and social conditions of Egypt today. And I think this has of 
course strengthened the hand of the Islamists. But it isn't 
really a reason for their existence. They are not very much a 
political and cultural phenomenon. And I think therein lies 
their major appeal. They point to the social and economic 
conditions of Egypt and the failure of the regime to respond to 
them as reason why a different kind of regime, and for them, one 
with an Islamic orientation, may be the answer to Egypt's both 
political and economic problems.

  [Excerpt] Cairo, 24 May (MENA) -- Petroleum Minister Hamdi 
al-Banbi has stated that Egyptian oil and natural gas reserves 
increased in the past four years by 1.7 billion barrels, at a 
rate of 28 percent of the reserve in 1990. We now have a 
reserve of 7.7 billion barrels, he said. 
  Al-Banbi pointed out in a statement today that the increase 
in reserves, which do fluctuate, was the result of a special 
policy the petroleum sector pursued to encourage investment in 
oil and gas prospecting and production. He remarked that this 
policy resulted in the discovery of 70 new oil and natural gas 
reservoirs, 24 of which have already been placed on the 
production map. 
  He added that the increase was also the result of increasing 
efforts to develop productive wells by drilling intermediary 
wells, supporting the subsidiary production of water and gas, 
and the application of advanced technology. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Khartoum, 26 May (SUNA) -- The Foreign Ministry 
today issued a statement on allegations made by official media 
organs and the Government of Egypt concerning the directives 
issued by the authorities of the state of Khartoum on planning 
and reorganizing the national capital. 
  It said that these directives affect 16 places, including 
three properties belonging to the Egyptian Army which should 
have been returned to the Sudanese Government after the 
departure of the British-Egyptian occupying force at Sudan's 
independence in 1956. The other 13 areas were leased to the 
(?Irrigation Department) and to an Arab-Egyptian company which 
the government assigned for Egyptian and other resident 
communities in 1958. 
  The Ministry added in its statement that these places were 
unoccupied for a long period and claims that some families were 
evicted on the eve of the festival 'Id al-Adha are pure and 
unfounded distortions indulged in by newspapers. The ministry 
stressed that these directives were routine and also affected 
citizens, as well as Sudanese and foreign institutions. [passage

  [Text] Khartoum, 26 May (SUNA) -- Sudan has expressed its 
condemnation of all attempts at division and fragmentation and 
the lies of the advocates of the right to self-determination for 
illusory racial entities. 
  The Foreign Ministry said in a statement issued yesterday to 
mark the 31st anniversary of the OAU's establishment, that the 
anniversary comes at a time when the continent is becoming 
marginalized as part of the so-called new world order. It 
called for more solidarity, vigilance, and unity in the face of 
the conspiracies being hatched against the African continent.

Agency correspondent reports that after the militia's defeat in 
the northern provinces--during which Rasul Bekhoda, one of their 
oppressive leaders was seriously injured and 70 militiamen were 
killed in face-to-face fighting with the Islamic Army--men from 
the same group in Mazar-e Sharif left the country for the 
Central Asian republics with forged passports and after looting 
public properties. 
  Reports say that the existence of Dostam's militias and 
infamous Parchamies [Communist Party faction led by Karmal] 
alongside Golboddin's men has created new concerns among 
Dostam's militias and Parchamies, and the situation is getting 
harder than ever for them. Therefore, 30 militiamen have escaped 
to Pakistan recently with their families from Kabul city. 
[passage indistinct] 
  It has been said that Rasul Bekhoda is one of the

  [Text] Islamabad, May 26 (AFP) -- Pakistan's Prime Minister 
Benazir Bhutto said Thursday [26 May] her country had put 
forward counter-proposals to a US plan for non-intrusive 
inspections of Pakistan's nuclear installations. The 
counter-proposal was passed on to Washington by President Farooq 
Ahmed Leghari, who is in the United States on a private visit, 
she said at a press conference following her return from a 
three-day visit to Nepal. 
  "We are using this occasion to have informal talks" with US 
leaders and explain Pakistan's position following US Under 
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott's trip to Islamabad in April, 
she added. Bhutto did not elaborate on the contents of the 
counter-proposals. 
  Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali said last week that 
Washington had proposed a "non-intrusive" inspection of 
Pakistan's nuclear plants to verify that Islamabad was not 
producing nuclear weapons. He added that Pakistan was prepared 
to consider non-physical verification of its programme. The US 
proposals followed Talbott's talks on the nuclear issue with 
Pakistani leaders, when the two sides agreed to pursue a policy 
of "quiet diplomacy" to improve bilateral relations. 
  President Leghari, who in United States to attend his son's 
graduation, held talks with US Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher and met Vice President Al Gore, while officials of 
the two countries Thursday began two days of talks in Washington. 
  Pakistan's controversial nuclear programme has caused strain 
between Washington and Islamabad, with the United States in 1990 
cut off more than 500 million dollars worth of military and 
economic assistance to Pakistan. Washington also stopped 
delivery of 38 F-16 jets, following reports that Pakistan was 
pursuing a weapons-oriented nuclear programme, a charge which 
Islamabad has denied. 
  In April Washington asked Islamabad to agree to a 
"verifiable 
cap" on production of missile materials in exchange for a 
one-time waiver of the embargo imposed against it under the 1990 
Pressler Amendment. Although the proposal was discussed during 
Talbott's visit, no immediate agreement was reported. 
  Bhutto said she wanted to see an improvement in relations 
between the two nations, adding that she wanted to visit the 
United States later this year. Pakistan shared with the US its 
concern over nuclear non-proliferation, she said, but added that 
she saw the Pressler Amendment as a "veto" in the hands of 
Pakistan's traditional rival, India. She said India applied 
this veto "on every single proposal made by Pakistan for 
regional non-proliferation." 
  Islamabad wants a "non-discriminatory" application of the 
legislation, forced India, which exploded a nuclear device 20 
years ago, to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. "If 
Pakistan and the US are to proceed on a common goal of non- 
proliferation in the region, then it is important that the 
Indian veto through Pressler be removed or waived," she stressed.

  [Text] The president, Sardar Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari, has 
said the Pressler Amendment plays highly discriminatory and 
harsh sanctions against Pakistan while the Indian missile 
program was posing security threat to the South Asian region. 
He was speaking at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 
Washington. During the intense session, the president made a 
comprehensive presentation of a wide range of political, 
economic, and strategic issues involving Pakistan-U.S. 
relations. He, however, emphasized that relations between the 
two countries should not be allowed to become hostage to the 
Pressler Amendement. Speaking of nuclear nonproliferation, the 
president said Pakistan cannot sign the treaty unilaterally in 
the face of security threat posed by India's military build up 
in the region and its hegemonic ambition. President Leghari 
dilated in detail on the Kashmir issue and highlighted the human 
rights violations being committed by Indian troops in the held 
valley. The president earlier had a similar meeting with the 
House Foreign Relations Committee headed by Mr. Lee Hamilton. 
  Addressing the influential Middle East Forum of the Council 
of Foreign Relations, the president said the threat to regional 
and global peace arises from the Kashmir dispute, New Delhi's 
arms build up against Pakistan, and India's pursuit of a nuclear 
weapons and missile program. He said security in South Asia 
will improve dramatically if the core issue of Kashmir is 
resolved peacefully. On Afghanistan, the president said Pakistan 
sided with the Afghan resistance at a great cost and peril to 
itself. Thus it contributed in small measure to the demise of 
the cold war.

that we want to enhance cooperation with the United States in

  [Text] President Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari said that 
Pakistan and India can live in an atmosphere of complete peace 
and harmony if the Kashmir issue is resolved. Addressing a 
dinner hosted by the Association of Pakistan Professionals in 
New York last night, he said the security situation in the South 
Asian region has further worsened due to the Indian plan to 
deploy Prithvi missiles. He said that the only target of these 
missiles is Pakistan and this has aggravated further the tension 
which has been caused by the Kashmir problem. 
  President Leghari said that contrary to the India-U.S. 
secret 
talks in London, Pakistan's silent diplomacy with the United 
States is continuing and it is not secret. The diplomacy is 
aimed at resolving the issue of the Pressler Amendment in the 
context of the efforts to realize the goal of nuclear 
nonproliferation in South Asia. 
  President Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari said that Pakistan 
welcomes all reasonable proposals. It, however, will not accept 
any unilateral restriction on its peaceful nuclear program. On 
narcotics control, the president said that the Government of 
Pakistan has recently taken speedy steps to eradicate the 
operations of the drug mafia and also enacted stringent laws to 
root out drug trafficking. On the privatization of the power 
production projects of [word indistinct], the president said 
that progress in this regard has been halted due to lack of 
appropriate legal regulations. He said that the whole process of 
privatization will be very transparent and in conformity with 
the law. In future, thermal power production will be entrusted 
only to the private sector, while the government will take care 
of hydroelectric power production.

<F P=106> [Report by Safa Ha'eri: "Demonstrations in Qom Against </F>
Khamene'i and Hashemi-Rafsanjani"] 
  [Text] Paris -- Anti-regime demonstrations involving some 
6,000 people were staged in Qom yesterday. Sources in the city 
said that the demonstrators, most of whom are clients and 
depositors of the "Waliyy ol-Asr" loans and savings company, 
which was established in 1991 by senior clerics, protested 
against the "disappearance" of some 12 billion riyals they had 
deposited in the company. Demonstrators chanted slogans, 
calling for the overthrow of 'Ali Khamene'i, the republic's 
guide, and President Hashemi-Rafsanjani. It is worth noting 
that, in the absence of a sound banking system, loans and 
savings companies thrived rapidly as a result of the interest 
rates they offer their clients. But most of these companies, 
which were established with the blessings of clerics, have 
become bankrupt quickly.

Sarakhs, President Hashemi-Rafsanjani expressed the hope that 
when this trade center opens, the volume of transactions would 
increase between the merchants in both countries, among other 
neighboring countries and the rest of the region. 
  Niyazov too, during his remarks, in part referring to the 
growing volume of trade between the two countries, agreed with 
the export of cotton from Turkmenistan to Iran. In another part 
of his remarks, referring to the policy to expand road and 
railway networks between the two countries, Niyazov added: Good 
progress is made in the feasibility study phase of the project 
to transport Turkmenistan gas to Europe via Iran. 
  It is worth mentioning that at the conclusion of the talks 
between the presidents of the Islamic Republic of Iran and 
Turkmenistan it was agreed that ministers and expert teams from 
the two countries should study and investigate ways of 
strengthening bilateral cooperation and should inform their 
respective presidents on the outcome of their discussions.

president, Mr. K.R. Narayanan; the prime minister, Mr. P.V. 
Narasimha Rao; his cabinet colleagues; the Uttar Pradesh 
governor, Mr. Motilal Vora; and the three service chiefs. 
  In Bulgaria, six bilateral agreements are to be signed 
including one on avoidance of double taxation. The highlight of 
the president's visit to Romania will be adoption of a basic 
political document by the two countries. The president will 
also address a joint session of the Romanian senate and the 
chamber of deputies. The University of Bucharest is to confer an 
honorary doctorate on Dr. Shankar Dayal Sharma.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Pressler's Proposal"] </F>
  [Text] The suggestion of Larry Pressler, U.S. Republican 
party senator and the author of the Pressler Law, that China's 
nuclear programs should be capped along with India's and 
Pakistan's seems to be an honest one. He is right in saying 
that India cannot give up its nuclear program because of China's 
continuing nuclear program. This suggestion makes it quite 
clear that Pressler's attitude is free from any prejudice. He 
goes into the details of an issue and arrives at an objective 
analysis. He had argued first before the U.S. Administration 
that economic aid to Pakistan should be stopped because Pakistan 
was secretly manufacturing the nuclear bomb. He has again 
advanced the argument that F-16 fighter planes should not be 
supplied to Pakistan because there is a danger of a nuclear war 
between India and Pakistan. F-16 fighter planes could be used 
to drop nuclear bombs. Pressler has further said that Solarz is 
considered a friend of India and he is very knowledgeable as far 
as this area is concerned. The way the proposal to appoint him 
as the envoy to India has been taken back has been condemned by 
Pressler. Maybe Pressler has not been a close friend of India 
as Solarz has been, but his neutrality has certainly shown that 
he is a well wisher of India. 
  The proposal advanced by Pressler fully fits into the United 
States' South Asia policy; hence, the U.S. Administration will 
definitely ponder over it. America wants South Asia to be a 
zone totally free of nuclear weapons. But is it possible for 
America to "arm-twist" China? We don't think that America can 
persuade China to cap its nuclear program. Like India, China 
can also ask why only South Asia should be converted into a 
nuclear weapons free zone? America has inter-continental 
missiles which can drop nuclear bombs at a given target. 
However, Larry Pressler's proposal goes in favor of India and 
India can't give up its nuclear program, not only because of 
Pakistan, but because of China also. Recently, the Chinese 
Ambassador to India said that India could not be forced to sign 
the NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty] because India is a sovereign 
country. China is not as opposed to India's nuclear capacity as 
the U.S. is. Of course, the Chinese envoy's statement about 
India was in line with his country's own interests. Each country 
talks about its own interests. Therefore, India can do 
likewise, and its arguments will be carried to the U.S. 
Administration by people like Pressler, which will strengthen 
the Indian stance in America. Of course, nothing may come out 
of it, but the fact remains that India's position is being 
properly understood.

  [Text] The finance minister, Dr Manmohan Singh, has said 
that India's differences with the U.S. on Super 301 can be 
resolved through the World Trade Organisation (WTO). 
  Dr Singh said the GATT disputes redressal mechanism was 
available to seek settlements with any country, including the 
U.S. But the U.S. had a right to have its own legislation, as 
India had a right to its own, he said. 
  He was responding to questions from journalists during his 
visit to London, on his way back to New Delhi from the U.S. He 
met the chancellor of the exchequer, Mr Kenneth Clarke, here. 
  Dr Singh asserted that India's economic reforms programme 
and 
the broad strategy of integrating Indian economy with the global 
economy were fully endorsed by the U.S. government and the 
captains of U.S. trade and industry. 
  There was a lot of enthusiasm in the U.S., both in the 
government and among the American businessmen, about India's 
prospects as a large and emerging market offering great 
opportunities for U.S. investments, he said. 
  Dr Singh said: "There is no weakening of interest in India." 
The demand for global deposit receipts (GDRs) and commercial 
paper continues to be strong, he said. "There is no crisis of 
confidence in India," he added. 
  On his visit to the U.S., he said, he found a lot of 
interest 
in investment in India. It was a "fully successful visit", he 
said. Asked if it was necessary for Prime Minister Narasimha 
Rao to have gone to the U.S., he said that "it was a good time 
to go". 
  Asked about reservations of multinational companies about 
Indian labour laws, Dr Singh said, "The companies do not find 
the labour laws insuperable barriers". But, he said, "we do 
recognise there is a need for flexibility". 
  He said: "At the same time, there must be a proper 
psychological environment." In a fast-changing world, "we are 
willing to look at all mechanisms", he said. 
  On the contentious issues like the U.S. trade embargo, the 
finance minister said these issues were discussed but no final 
conclusions were reached. 
  Asked particularly about rising inflation, Dr Singh said 
inflation in India was not an indication of excess demand in 
classic terms. He said the balance of payments position was 
improving. The deficit in the current and trade accounts was 
down. 
  The inflation was a reflection of a rise in administrative 
prices, he said. The cotton crop had been bad, sugar prices had 
risen, but these were a part of world trends, he added. 
  Asked to comment on the "collapse" of the VSNL [expansion 
unknown] issue, Dr Singh said: "There was no collapse. There 
was ample response. The question was at what price we want to 
sell. We thought if we wait two months or so, we can get a 
better deal." 
  In response to a question as to why the government was 
legislating the GDR market, he said: "It would be premature to 
have excessive liberalisation on the capital account." Flows in 
and out had to be controlled and external liabilities could not 
be allowed to be piled up on a large scale, he said. 
  Dr Singh was told of several problems with the Indian 
bureaucracy by some NRIs [non-resident Indians] at the meeting. 
He said liberalisation was not a one-off attempt. It involved 
"changing the mind-set of our bureaucracy", he said. He 
admitted that "in some states, things may not be moving as fast 
as they should" . 
  There would be no going back on liberalisation, he said, 
when 
asked to comment on opposition to it. "You should judge people 
not by what they say but by what they do," he said. 
  The CPM [Communist Party-Marxist] government in West Bengal 
was, for instance, tying up with multinational companies to 
launch joint ventures. "We have to integrate into the world 
economy. Liberalisation is in the interest of our people", he 
said. "Some old habits die hard, but opposition to the changes 
is melting," he said. 
  Asked to comment on new facilities for NRIs announced in the 
U.S., Dr Singh said cards for NRIs would do away with visa needs 
and provide them other facilities. Details had yet to be worked 
out he said. "First we recognise that we need to find credible 
institutions to strengthen bonds with NRIs," he said. 
  Replying to a question on entry of foreign newspapers, he 
said a debate over the future policy on print media was 
currently on. At present, the Cabinet decision of 1956 barred 
entry of foreign newspapers into India and this was applicable 
to all categories of foreigners, he said. 
  The high commissioner, Mr L M Singhvi, said the 
announcements 
in the U.S. meant, in effect, giving NRIs "a form of dual 
nationality but not dual citizenship". Very substantial 
progress had been made in recognising these links, he said.

  [Excerpts] The cabinet held a meeting this evening and 
discussed the Israeli aggression. It stressed the importance of 
domestic unity and bolstering the legitimate security forces 
with all available means to continue their role in safeguarding 
the homeland's security. It also decided to ask the foreign 
minister to hold preliminary contacts to call for a UN Security 
Council meeting to debate the Lebanese complaint and condemn the 
Israeli aggression. The cabinet meeting began at 1730 today at 
B'abda Palace under the chairmanship of President Ilyas 
al-Hirawi. Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri also attended the 
meeting. The meeting continued until 2115. After the meeting, 
Information Minister Michel Samahah announced the following 
official decisions: 
  [Begin recording] [Samahah] At the invitation of Prime 
Minister Rafiq al-Hariri, the cabinet held its weekly meeting at 
the Presidential Palace this evening. The meeting was chaired 
by President Ilyas al-Hirawi. At the outset of the meeting, 
President al-Hirawi discussed the Israeli aggression against 
Lebanon on the morning of 'Id al-Adha when the Israeli enemy 
staged a commando operation and abducted Lebanese citizen 
Mustafa al-Dirani from his hometown in al-Biqa'. 
  The defense minister then submitted a detailed report on the 
Israeli act of aggression. He explained the practical moves 
made by the Lebanese Army to confront this operation. The 
foreign minister presented a report on lodging a complaint with 
the UN Security Council and the contacts Lebanon has held on the 
subject. 
  The cabinet then discussed the Israeli aggression and 
stressed the importance of bolstering the domestic unity and the 
legitimate security forces with all available means to continue 
to perform their role in safeguarding the homeland's security. 
The cabinet decided to have the foreign minister hold 
preliminary contacts for a meeting of the UN Security Council to 
debate the Lebanese complaint and condemn the Israeli 
aggression. [passage omitted] 
  [Question] Did the cabinet discuss the proposals from the UN 
secretary general [words indistinct] Lebanon and Israel 
regarding al-Dirani? 
  [Samahah] Lebanon regrets very much this stance by the UN 
secretary general. The United Nations is required to implement 
its resolutions instead of offering to mediate on an issue that 
requires implementation of international law and UN principles. 
It is impossible to equate the case of one who fell in Lebanon 
during an aggression against Lebanese territory and that of a 
Lebanese citizen abducted from his home on Lebanese territory by 
an Israeli force that violated international laws and Lebanon's 
sovereignty. Lebanon demands that this citizen be released 
immediately, along with all Lebanese detainees in Israeli jails 
and in detention camps in occupied Lebanese territory in the 
south. 
  [Question] In light of the information available, what in 
your views was the goal of the Israeli operation? 
  [Samahah] The operation is designed to complement the 
Israeli 
plan manifest in the recent bombings, specifically the bombing 
of Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Zuq Mikha'il and of the 
Phalangist Party headquarters. In this case and in those cases, 
the Israeli enemy sought to sow division and doubts within 
Lebanese society and in the people's unity and their state's 
capabilities. The president, the prime minister, and all 
ministers stressed that there is no room for leaving the Israeli 
links that act in various ways to strike at Lebanon's unity and 
to confuse the Lebanese people's trust in their legitimate 
establishments, especially the security forces and the Army and 
their unity in confronting the Israeli enemy. Lebanon will 
confront all Israeli operations at this time when our country is 
facing important challenges, primarily the peace negotiations 
and Israeli attempts to bend the will of the Lebanese and Arabs, 
particularly Syria at this stage of the negotiations. [passage 
omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz has commented on a 
proposal by UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali to 
mediate between Lebanon and Israel to resolve the issue of 
Mustafa al-Dirani. He said: A mediation between Lebanon and 
Israel on such an issue makes it appear that Lebanon recently 
kidnapped an Israeli citizen. However, the truth of the matter 
is that navigator Ron Arad disappeared after conducting an air 
raid over the Lebanese territories during the war. Hence, he is 
not being detained by the Lebanese state, contrary to al-Dirani, 
who was kidnapped by a state at a time when there was no war. 
  Buwayz added: We have requested that the UN secretary 
general investigate the case of over 350 Lebanese nationals who 
are being detained in Israeli jails. So far, no international 
or humanitarian organization has been permitted to visit them 
and be reassured about their fate. A number of these detainees 
have died as a result of bad treatment. Hence, if the United 
Nations is in such a hurry to play its political role, we hope 
it will at least play its humanitarian role. Talking about 
human rights with often empty slogans and during resonant 
conferences and showing interest in this issue brings to the 
surface the UN's delay in sending an investigation committee to 
look into the issue of those detainees.

  [Text] Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz today 
rejected the idea of UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali mediating the issue of Israel's kidnapping of 
Mustafa al-Dirani, the official in charge of the Believers 
Resistance. Buwayz said the UN secretary general's role is to 
obtain the release of the Lebanese citizen. 
  Our correspondent in Beirut, Antoine Constantine, 
interviewed 
'Ali al-Husayni, one of the senior officials in the Believers 
Resistance in Lebanon, and asked him about his opinion 
concerning the Lebanese Government's stand on al-Dirani's 
kidnapping and the possibility of exchanging him for Israeli 
pilot Ron Arad. 
  [Begin al-Husayni recording] This is positive talk. We 
support what the Lebanese Government has said [words indistinct] 
brother Abu-'Ali al-Dirani, the UN secretary general, who is 
entrusted with an international organization which takes care of 
the entire world, should not compare and should not equate 
between the victim and the aggressor. I believe that just 
saying that we should carry out negotiations on al-Dirani and 
Ron Arad greatly harms the United Nations because Ron Arad 
bombed the people here, and was arrested on Lebanese soil, while 
Abu-'Ali al-Dirani was defending his land. 
  Another thing is that Abu-'Ali al-Dirani has no information 
about Ron Arad. Butrus Ghali knows this. He previously carried 
out mediation and directly and indirectly contacted the 
Believers Resistance, and others, concerning the Ron Arad issue. 
At the time, he was informed [word indistinct] one of the UN 
envoys that we have nothing to do with this and we do not have 
him. 
  Had Ron Arad been with the Believers Resistance, we -- I 
regret to use this expression -- but a man who struggles against 
Israel, for us, is worth all the Israelis. There is no doubt 
that we would have exchanged him because to us the individual is 
more important than anything else. The talk by the UN secretary 
general that he is ready to carry out a mediation shows he has 
colluded with the Israelis in the kidnapping operation. [end 
recording]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Buwayz: Syrian-Israeli Talks Have </F>
Not Reached Points of Agreement"] 
  [Excerpt] Beirut, AL-HAYAH -- Foreign Minister Faris 
Buwayz received a message from the U.S. Department of State 
yesterday. It was conveyed by U.S. Charge d'Affaires in Lebanon 
Vincent Battle. It deals with the outcome of Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher's recent talks in the Middle East on 
reactivating the Syrian-Israeli negotiation track. 
  Buwayz said that "the Syrian-Israeli-U.S. talks are still 
remote from the possibility of quickly reaching points of 
agreement, even though they are serious and broaching 
fundamental issues." He expected "further rounds of talks to be 
held before a call for resuming the negotiations crystallizes." 
  He described the "view that settling the Syrian file is 
bound 
to reflect positively on the Lebanese and Jordanian file as 
realistic." 
  He stressed that contacts are continuing between Beirut and 
Damascus, "and we are closely following what is happening with 
regard to the Syrian-Israeli negotiations. And if necessary, 
direct meetings (between Lebanon and Syria) are not difficult to 
hold." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Viktor Posuvalyuk, the personal envoy of Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin, is paying an official visit to Lebanon 
to hold talks with officials on the Middle East peace process 
and bilateral ties. 
  Posuvalyuk, who is director general of the Middle East and 
North African Department in the Russian Foreign Ministry, voiced 
his country's support for the continuation of peace 
negotiations. He said that efforts are now focusing on ways to 
eliminate the obstacles hindering the progress of the peace 
process. He spoke at the Foreign Ministry, where he met with 
Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz in the presence of ministry 
Secretary General Ambassador Zafir al-Hasan; Ambassador Yusuf 
Arsanyus, director of the foreign minister's office; and Russian 
Ambassador Gennadiy Ilichev. The Russian president's envoy 
arrived on the Lebanese-Syrian border point from Damascus before 
noon today. He will meet tomorrow with Prime Minister Rafiq 
al-Hariri before leaving for Amman and then going on to Israel. 
  Responding to reporters' questions at the Foreign Ministry 
headquarters, Posuvalyuk said: 
  [Begin recording] [Posuvalyuk] I would like to say that my 
trip to the region was launched on the instructions of President 
Boris Yeltsin and Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. Such visits 
usually include two areas: one dealing with bilateral ties and 
the other with the peace march. To answer your question, we had 
a candid discussion with his excellency the foreign minister. 
We discussed details pertaining to the Lebanese track in the 
peace process. This helped us understand the actual situation 
on the Lebanese-Israeli track. 
  [Correspondent] Can your tour be viewed as supplementary to 
the U.S. secretary of state's tour of the region? In other 
words, do you coordinate with Washington when it comes to 
submitting certain ideas? 
  [Posuvalyuk] Yes, we constantly coordinate our steps with 
the 
American sponsor. 
  [Correspondent] What is your comment on the kidnapping of 
Mustafa al-Dirani, and does this hinder the peace process? 
  [Posuvalyuk] I can say that we are concerned at what is 
happening at present. We are discussing this issue with the 
parties concerned. We believe in the need to eliminate all the 
causes of increased tension on the Lebanese-Israeli track. This 
must be based on UN resolutions, primarily Resolution 425. 
  [Correspondent] Do you expect the resumption of talks soon 
or 
are there obstacles? 
  [Posuvalyuk] We support the continuation of negotiations. We 
are discussing ways to eliminate these obstacles. 
  [Correspondent] Have you found during your trip and contacts 
that it is Israel that is hindering the resumption of 
negotiations, or is it Arab states? 
  [Posuvalyuk] I said that we are discussing ways to eliminate 
obstacles hindering progress in the peace process. 
  [Correspondent] [Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq] Al-Shar' 
asked the cosponsors to condemn al-Dirani's kidnapping. What 
reaction did that request have in Moscow, and have you conveyed 
that request to Washington? 
  [Posuvalyuk] I have conveyed that request to Moscow. 
  [Correspondent] What was the reaction? 
  [Posuvalyuk] I conveyed that request to Moscow. 
  [Correspondent] What are the ideas you are proposing to give 
an impetus to the peace process? 
  [Posuvalyuk] My theory is that if I start to talk about 
these 
details, I will erase the dividing line between the reporter and 
the diplomat. There are reporters and there are diplomats. 
  [Correspondent] What are the general outlines of these 
ideas? 
  [Posuvalyuk] The general line governing these ideas is that 
after the parties concerned exchange the required basic 
assertions, we can get into technical details. We believe that 
we have reached the stage at which we can discuss technical 
details, having discussed the general major principles. 
  [Correspondent] At the end of your tour you will visit 
Israel. Have you promised Minister Buwayz to raise the issue of 
al-Dirani's kidnapping in Tel Aviv to discuss ways to release 
him? 
  [Posuvalyuk] I will talk to Israeli officials about the 
obstacles that still hinder the peace process. 
  [Correspondent] You represent President Yeltsin and Russia, 
who is a permanent member of the UN Security Council. You are 
also one of the cosponsors of the peace conference. What is 
your position on Lebanon's complaint against Israel and its 
demand for the immediate release of al-Dirani?

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Preserving Legitimacy and Unity First"] </F>
  [Text] Days after the eruption of the civil war in sisterly 
Yemen, it became very clear that the secessionist tendency was 
the cause of the deaths and disaster that the Yemeni people have 
suffered, as well as the destruction inflicted on the state 
establishments and vital economic facilities and services. 
  The war has destroyed achievements and costly projects set 
up 
by the fraternal Yemeni people with their efforts and sacrifices. 
  Therefore, a decision to stop the war, return to legitimacy, 
and to protect the unity of the Yemeni homeland and people is 
the solution for this dangerous crisis, which, if it continues, 
will be very costly to both sides. 
  There are reports of Arab mediation, including Saudi 
efforts, 
after the failure of the Arab league's mediation. We hope that 
any and all mediation efforts will target the preservation of 
unity for the Yemeni homeland and people, the curbing of 
secessionist tendencies, and the return of legitimacy. 
Otherwise, mediation will be a sort of outside interference 
that encourages the southern leaders to secede, and this 
conflicts with the aspirations and hopes of the Yemeni people 
and the whole Arab nation. 
  The continuation of the civil war will not realize a victory 
for any party, and the victim will be the Yemeni people and 
their infrastructure. 
  The failure of Yemeni unity will undermine the unionist 
spirit within the Arab nation and drive it to frustration and 
despair about the possibility of forging unity between any two 
Arab states. 
  We urge the Yemeni leadership in the north and the south to 
expedite an end to this war, to return to legitimacy, and to 
adhere to the unity for which the Yemeni people have offered 
great sacrifices.

  [Text] Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, minister of state for 
foreign affairs, has said that Jordan's rights to land and water 
must be assured. The refugees issue must also be sorted out in 
line with UN resolutions, including Resolution 194, the minister 
told a delegation of the American Peace Now Group, who were 
calling at his office in Amman today. The minister outlined to 
the delegation, visiting Jordan in the course of a regional 
tour, Middle East developments with special accent on the peace 
process and Jordan's key role there. Al-Hasan reiterated 
Jordan's abiding commitment to a just, durable, and 
comprehensive peace based on UN Security Council Resolutions 242 
and 338, the land-for-peace formula, a complete Israeli pullback 
from the occupied Arab territories, and legitimate rights of the 
Palestinian people on their national soil. 
  The minister spelled out the burdens placed on Jordan by the 
Palestinian question over the past four decades and the economic 
difficulties faced by Jordan as a result of the siege of the 
Port of al-'Aqabah. On the latter case, al-Hasan emphasized 
that this unjustified blocakade must be brought to an end in 
light of Jordan's contribution and constructive and positive 
approach to the peace process. 
  The minister outlined to the delegation Jordan's democratic 
experience, its pluralistic multiparty system, and its respect 
for human rights as an irreversible option advocated by His 
Majesty King Husayn. 
  On their side, the American delegation applauded Jordan's 
preeminent and significant contribution to the efforts to make 
peace and bring stability and security to the region. They were 
impressed by the major achievements made by Jordan and 
appreciated the difficulties it has been experiencing. They 
also expressed the need to extend assistance to Jordan to help 
it play its anticipated role in the peace process and to bring 
security and stability to the region. 
  The meeting was attended by the American ambassador in Amman 
and Foreign Ministry officials.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf has 
reacted to a broadcast speech addressed by King Fahd of Saudi 
Arabia to the pilgrims last Tuesday, 24 May 1994: 
  The foreign minister said: We heard the speech made by Fahd 
in which he stupidly charged in the first sentence that Iraq is 
skirting UN Security Council resolutions. In the second 
sentence, this genius of a king went on to contend that keeping 
the sanctions in place will make sure there is no change in the 
stands toward Iraq of regional and world powers. In the third 
sentence -- in which he predicted that once the status quo ends, 
the region will see an era of stability -- he became unbalanced. 
  The foreign minister added: It is well known to the 
population of Najd and Hejaz and to all Arabs and Muslims that 
the feeble-minded Fahd begins his day by gulping alcoholic 
drinks just as greedily as beasts guzzle stagnant water -- a 
habit he practices even during the pilgrimage. He is scarcely 
sober enough to conduct a meaningful conversation, even at 
official sessions, which explains why his utterings are 
typically absurd, revolting, and hollow. 
  These particular remarks by Fahd fit the pattern of a filthy 
monarch's manner of speech. His memory, devastated by alcoholic 
drinks and possibly narcotics, must have led him to fantasize 
that his kingdom is the sixth permanent member of the Security 
Council. Influenced by a mixture of repulsive illusions, 
ignorance, and spite, Fahd set about slandering Iraq and 
accusing it of sidestepping Security Council resolutions. This 
agent forgets that his kingdom is not even a nonpermanent member 
of the council. 
  What are we to make of his charge that Iraq is skirting 
Security Council resolutions, or his demand that the sanctions 
be retained, the foreign minister asked. These remarks, added 
al-Sahhaf, prove Fahd to be a petty agent of a Security Council 
member allied with Zionism -- a nation that attempts to force 
its influence and political agenda on the Security Council. 
  Fahd can convince no one that he is a mere ally of nations 
that want to impose their hegemony. Fahd's inability to advance 
a convincing case is because in the eyes of these nations he is 
hardly an ally; he is viewed as trash, a petty agent attached to 
a huge pig that has put itself at the disposal of the Zionist 
Movement to torture the Arabs and antagonize the virtuous 
Islamic faith and its lofty and undying values. The changes 
favoring Iraq's cause regionally and globally are ongoing and 
will continue. The positive relationship between Iraq and the 
Security Council and the Special Commission is on course. The 
feeble-minded Fahd and his likeminded petty agents will only 
reap failure and suffer dire consequences. Great Iraq and its 
proud people will, in the meantime, continue to walk tall and be 
a lofty example of pride and dignity and a bastion for the Arab 
nation and revival, the foreign minister stated.

  [Excerpts] Baghdad, 27 May (INA) -- Two Iraqi newspapers 
have lashed out vehemently at the anti-Iraq fabrications made by 
the servant of the Jews and Americans, the vile and obtuse King 
Fahd, while addressing pilgrims last Tuesday [24 May]. 
  The two papers agreed that Fahd's history is a natural 
outcome of the bad manners of his family and that his statements 
reflect the dirty Saudi behavior that is smeared in the mud of 
collusion with the Americans. 
  In its editorial today, AL-THAWRAH, speaking for the Arab 
Socialist Ba'th Party, says: It is not strange that King Fahd 
should fabricate lies against Iraq and its people, since this is 
only part of the conduct of the Saudi family and what is known 
of its history as an agent of U.S. imperialism since it was 
brought to occupy Najd and Hejaz in suspect circumstances. 
  The paper notes the latest treasonous stand that exposes 
Fahd, namely his hostility to Yemen's unity since its 
establishment and his efforts to divide the ranks of the 
Yemenis. Fahd sought, through his ambassador in Washington, to 
internationalize the crisis in this fraternal country in a 
pro-separatist attempt. This shows Fahd's inveterate grudge 
against the nation's unity and his endeavor to strike at the new 
Yemeni awakening. [passage omitted] 
  In its editorial today, AL-'IRAQ says the speech of the 
feeble-minded Fahd should be pitied. The Iraqis are an 
experienced, hard-working people who are known for heroism and 
courage in the battlefield. They are leading the faithful to 
win the satisfaction of God and his prophet. The discordant 
voice coming from the land of Najd and Hejaz is not the voice of 
the son of the land of holy places that has a glorious history 
and civilization. It is the voice of the Americans and Zionists 
whose flag is fluttering over the holy land thanks to this 
discordant voice. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Baghdad, 26 May (INA)--BABIL has accused the Saudi 
and Kuwaiti rulers and the U.S. Embassy in Sanaa of involvement 
in a multi-chapter conspiracy that is directed against the unity 
of sisterly Yemen. 
  In an article by Nuri al-Marsumi published today, the 
newspaper says that this conspiracy is being carried out within 
the systematic conspiracies and aggressions against the Arab 
world, starting with the aggression against Iraq -- the 
aggression by the United States, NATO, and the agent regimes. 
  The newspaper adds that after Iraq, Yemen is the most 
important of the countries that reject aggression and 
dependence. Yemen's success in overcoming economic problems and 
entrenching unity will certainly constitute a shining light that 
frightens the Saudi rulers and their masters. 
  The paper says that these rulers had been much provoked and 
the moment the unity [agreement] was signed, long before 2 
August 1990, mobilized their forces against Iraq, Yemen, and 
Jordan. 
  The newspaper emphasized that the declaration of secession 
is 
a crime whose destructive results are no less than the first 
secessionist crime in the Arab history in 1961 [between Syria 
and Egypt]. 
  Concluding its article, the newspaper said: The socialists 
have gone too far in coordinating with the suspect rulers in 
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. They forgot principles and history. 
Before that, they forgot that they are no more than tools to 
destroy their homeland and future.

  [Text] Baghdad, 26 May (INA) -- 'Abd-al-Ghani 
'Abd-al-Ghafur, secretary general of the National Progressive 
and Patriotic Front [NPPF], has stressed that the NPPF and its 
parties support the unity of the Yemeni territory and people as 
a pan-Arab achievement, not only for Yemen but also for the Arab 
nation's masses. 
  In a statement to INA, 'Abd-al-Ghafur said the declaration 
by 
'Ali Salim al-Bid and his secessionist clique on setting up a 
deformed secessionist entity has only revealed the dimensions of 
the conspiracy and schemes hostile to both Yemeni unity and the 
Arab nation's hopes. 
  He indicated that Arab Iraq stands against the enemies of 
both the nation and its awakening. Iraq raised the slogans of 
Arab unity, of the liberation of Palestine, and of independent 
will. Iraq fought for these slogans in the historic and 
immortal Mother of Battles. 
  'Abd-al-Ghafur added that the NPPF parties wish the Yemeni 
people happiness and stability throughout their unified land. 
He noted that the NPPF general secretariat salutes the concern 
of the Yemeni people, national parties, and Armed Forces to 
preserve Yemeni unity and to confront the secessionists and 
their evil schemes. These schemes are implemented with support 
from the enemies of the nation, the imperialists, Zionists, and 
reactionaries, he added.

  [Excerpt] Baghdad, 25 May (INA) -- [passage omitted] 
Commenting on the recognition of the government of the 
secessionists in Yemen by the secessionist Somalis, who call 
their illegitimate regime "Somaliland," the political editor of 
the Iraqi News Agency has stated the following: The 
secessionist Somalis have found in the secessionists in Yemen a 
tool through which they can support each other in order to 
strengthen secessionist trends, backed by colonialism and its 
agents. 
  He added: It is known that Somalia was enabled to join the 
Arab League under special circumstances in order to strengthen 
the positive factors in Somalia's ties with the Arab nation and 
to play a constructive role in its cultural progress and unity, 
rather than a separatist and opportunist role. 
  He also said: This announcement by the secessionist Somalis 
who are rejected by the Somali people is aimed at harming the 
Arab nation as a whole and its pan-Arab concepts and trend, as 
well as Yemen and Yemen's unity. This should make the 
secessionist Somalis know that the benefits they may take from 
such a opportunist position are much less than what they can win 
from sound relations with the Arab nation and its goals.

  [Text] Baghdad, 26 May (INA) -- National Assembly Speaker 
Sa'di Mahdi Salih today received Masatu Okita, the higher 
adviser of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], and the 
accompanying delegation [name and title as received]. 
  During the meeting, Salih stressed Iraq's desire to 
establish 
strong friendship and cooperation relations with Japan. He said 
the return of Iraqi-Japanese relations to normal is necessary in 
order to achieve the interests of both friendly peoples in a way 
that benefits both countries. 
  Salih indicated the importance of promoting Iraqi-Japanese 
relations in the current and coming phases. He said Japan can 
play a greater role in this regard by making efforts to lift the 
blockade imposed on the Iraqi people, especially since Japan 
enjoys the international status entitling it to play such a role. 
  Okita emphasized the SDPJ's desire to promote Japanese-Iraqi 
relations on the official and party levels in a way that would 
achieve the interests of both friendly peoples. He said: We 
are working to establish a just, comprehensive, and lasting 
peace in the Arab region, avoiding the use of force. 
  Okita appreciated Iraq's peaceful positions and its call for 
the establishment of such a peace, so general welfare can be 
achieved for all regional states and also for friendly states. 
  The Japanese delegation arrived in Iraq yesterday on a visit 
lasting several days.

  [Text] Baghdad, 26 May (INA) -- AL-THAWRAH has questioned 
the meaning of Washington's allocation in its foreign assistance 
program of $3 billion to the Zionist entity and $2.1 billion to 
the Egyptian regime. 
  In an article published today, the newspaper, organ of the 
Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, said the declared and undeclared 
U.S. assistance to the Zionist entity, whether the material, 
military, or political assistance, emphasizes that their 
relationship is not a provisional alliance but a deep and active 
strategic alliance. 
  As for what Washington offers the Egyptian regime, it is no 
more than an illusion and a lie. The paper adds: This 
assistance to Mubarak's regime is not free, but aims to increase 
Egypt's dependence and its involvement in policies and positions 
that are totally against the Arab interest. 
  The newspaper emphasizes that the U.S. assistance to the 
Mubarak regime amounts to no more than shackles to increase 
dependence, and subsequently becoming led by the objectives and 
designs of the United States in the region at the expense of the 
Egyptian people, in the first place, and the Arab region and its 
aspirations for liberation and progress. 
  The newspaper stresses that the Egyptian regime, which has 
practiced all dirty means and declared its full bias toward 
anything that serves the U.S. policy in the region, offered a 
great deal in order to receive more assistance and sympathy. 
This regime thought it was the first candidate to become the 
favorite of the U.S. Administration. This regime intentionally 
ignored the fact that Tel Aviv is not Cairo, and that in the 
field of service or expertise, this regime is only a small 
worker, who has a specific role that eventually serves the 
Zionist interest. 
  Concluding its article, the newspaper asks: Are these people 
aware of the swamp in which they have placed themselves?
