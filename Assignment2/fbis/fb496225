  [Excerpts] Under the patronage of President Hafiz al-Asad, 
the Artists Association this evening held a central festival on 
the occasion of the First Artists Day in the 8 March Theater in 
Damascus. 
  Sulayman Qaddah, assistant regional secretary of the Arab 
Socialist Ba'th Party, deputized for the president. [passage 
omitted] 
  Comrade Sulayman Qaddah delivered a speech on the occasion 
in 
which he conveyed President Hafiz al-Asad's greetings and 
appreciation to the Syrian artists. [passage omitted] 
  Comrade Qaddah then spoke about Syria's steadfastness and 
adherence to pan-Arab rights and firm principles to establish 
peace. He explained that Syria fought in honor and is 
negotiating in honor, and seeks the just and comprehensive peace 
based on the principles of the international legitimacy, the UN 
resolutions, and the land-for-peace formula. He said: Within 
this context, Syria believes Israel's withdrawal from the Golan 
Heights and return to the pre-5 June 1967 borders is a principal 
demand and a basic thing that cannot be avoided if peace is to 
be established and if security and stability are to prevail in 
the region. 
  He said: Under the historic leadership of its faithful 
leader Hafiz al-Asad, Syria rose with the glorious Corrective 
Movement to build itself, resist aggression, and struggle 
against occupation. It sticks to the pan-Arab facts and the firm 
principles. It depends in its steadfastness on the wisdom and 
courage of its leader and on its sons' efforts, unity, and 
interaction with their country's concerns, as well as their 
enthusiasm to develop and bolster their country's prosperity and 
stability so that Syria will always enjoy the steadfast pan-Arab 
position and the pioneering national role.

  [Text] Two Israeli soldiers were shot dead at a gas station 
near a group of Israeli settlements in the northernmost part of 
the occupied Gaza Strip today. An Israeli military spokesman 
said that fire was opened on the two soldiers from a car that 
arrived at an Israeli military roadblock in northern Gaza Strip. 
The Israeli occupation forces were unable to stop the car. 
  The Israeli occupation authorities informed Palestinian 
police in the self-rule area of the details of the operation, 
requesting help to apprehend the perpetrators. An Israeli 
spokesman said that the Palestinian police commander informed 
him that the Palestinian police would investigate the incident 
and embark on swift searches for those responsible. 
  The Islamic Jihad Movement claimed responsibility for the 
operation. In a statement, the Movement said that all its 
elements who carried out the operation returned safely to base. 
  Two Israeli settlers were also injured today when intifadah 
youths opened fire on their car in Gaza Strip. The Israeli 
occupation forces hurried to the scene and began extensive 
combing operations in search of those responsibile. 
  The Israeli occupation authorities decided to prevent 
Palestinian residents of Gaza Strip from entering Israel after 
the killing of the two Israeli soldiers. A spokeswoman for the 
Israeli Army said that this ban will continue until 29 May.

<F P=106> [Palestine Broadcast: "Talk of the Return"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Palestinian Arab revolutionaries recently 
punished two of the terrorist Israeli occupation troops in the 
Gaza Strip. Consequently, Israel closed the heroic, struggling 
Gaza Strip. This measure is certainly meant as a punishment for 
the Palestinian Arab people. However, perhaps because of its 
numerous and continuous mass punishments of the Palestinian Arab 
people, Israel, when it recently closed Gaza as a mass 
punishment, has forgotten that it has been closing the Gaza 
Strip and the West Bank as a punishment for exactly two years 
and two months. Therefore, the closure of the Gaza strip is a 
mass punishment. Whether it is fair or wrong and terrorist, 
like the oppressive Israeli practices, a punishment is supposed 
to be aimed against those directly responsible for a certain 
operation or those who failed to prevent the occurrence of such 
an operation. As for those who carried out the operation -- the 
Palestinian people -- they are as much experienced in enduring 
Israeli crimes as they are experienced in meting out the 
severest punishments to the Israeli terrorism. This is proven 
by the operation that led Israel to close the Gaza Strip, 
already closed for two years and two months. As for those 
responsible for the failure to block the Palestinian resistance 
men's execution of two Israeli occupation troops, who are they? 
Evidently, Israel holds the self-rule authority responsible. 
Therefore, it has closed the Gaza Strip. However, it should be 
noted that the fedayeen operation was carried out in an area 
directly controlled by the Israeli occupation army, in 
accordance with the Gaza-Jericho agreement. What does this mean? 
Despite our rejection of partial solutions, such as the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement, we say those responsible for the failure 
to prevent Palestinian Arab strugglers from punishing and 
killing Israeli invasion soldiers are specifically the Israeli 
occupation troops themselves, not any other authority. 
Consequently, Israel should punish its soldiers manning the 
roadblock, which Israel calls the Erez roadblock. [passage 
omitted] 
  However, Israel does not want to admit the heroism of the 
fedayeen nor the failure of some of its soldiers. Therefore, it 
is trying to cover up this failure and impotency by punishing 
the Palestinian Arab people. Has not Israel understood yet that 
its mass punishments have prompted the few who remained outside 
the intifadah to join the resistance, turning the entire 
Palestinian people into a wave of fire daily scorching Israel's 
face? Israel has not understood, nor will it understand. We do 
not want them to understand. This is because there are still 
many chapters to go in the book of the fair Palestinian Arab 
punishment of the Israeli terrorism and occupation. Those 
chapters, which are part of the armed Palestinian struggle, will 
be written by Palestinian Arab bullets in the body of the 
Israeli occupation. 
  Avenging Israeli terrorism is another face of the 
Palestinian 
revolution of liberation. This fair, well-planned vengeance, 
whose clear objective is liberation and deterring and punishing 
the Zionist enemy, is a book with renewable chapters. It will 
end only with the departure of the last wolves of Israeli 
occupation and the demolishing of the last Israeli Army camp and 
last Zionist settlement in the revolutionary Palestinian Arab 
territory.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] The commentaries and analyses of AL-BA'TH, the only 
paper published today because AL-THAWRAH and TISHRIN are on 
holiday, stress the need to bring international pressure to bear 
on Israel by refraining from supporting it until it abandons its 
aggressive inclination and complies with the will of the 
international community and its resolutions to achieve a just 
and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. 
  Under the headline "Israel Commits Aggression, Receives 
Support," AL-BA'TH writes: Israel seeks deliberately to 
reshuffle cards whenever it feels the pressure of international 
appeals for peace to guarantee Middle East security. 
  In line with the strategy of world Zionism, the Israeli 
leadership creates tension in the region to form a kind of 
pressure on the countries that support Israel and Zionist 
objectives. 
  In this regard, the paper notes the ongoing Israeli 
aggression against Lebanon. If aggression is one form of 
tension, then the abduction of people from their homes is an act 
of piracy, a crime, and a new obstacle to the peace process that 
was launched in Madrid. 
  AL-BA'TH says that when Israel receives a quarter of all 
U.S. 
aid to the world, then it will continue to have a tendency 
toward aggression and crime. When Europe lifts all forms of 
arms embargo on Israel and maintains this embargo against the 
Arabs, Israel receives direct support for its aggressive policy. 
  The paper adds that Israel, which has challenged the United 
Nations for almost half a century, is once again challenging 
anything that could check its aggressive tendency. 
  When Israel threatens those with whom it has signed 
agreements, it confirms that it does not want peace, not even in 
its very weakest forms, such as the Gaza-Jericho agreement. 
  AL-BA'TH concludes: Israel is committing aggression and yet 
receiving support and backing. It claims that it is willing to 
make peace, but at the expense of the Arabs, their territory and 
dignity, and at the expense of international law, which it is 
still defying and rejecting.

  The mission's visit has been timed with the first Syrian

Foreign Trade Minister Dr. Muhammad al-'Imadi on 3 May and 
continued until 7 May. The exhibition included the productions 
of more than 132 Syrian companies.

<F P=106> [Interview with Fatah Central Committee member Hani al-Hasan </F>
by AL-SHIRA' correspondent Zaynab Farran; place and date not 
given] 
  [Text] [Farran] Does the PLO continue to serve as a 
framework for Palestinian national action? 
  [Al-Hasan] Our view is that Israel's chief aim in 
negotiating 
with the PLO is to terminate it. Because we represent an 
Arab-affiliated patriotic Palestinian movement, we are not 
seeking to abolish the PLO. That would only go along with the 
Israeli scheme. At the same time, the PLO's current political 
line contradicts its original aims and charter. For this 
reason, Palestinian officials opposed to the Oslo agreement are 
confused and face complex contradictions. Our proposal is this: 
The first task must be to reform and change the PLO's political 
line, not abolish the PLO itself. The PLO continues to 
represent most Palestinian factions and to advocate its 
abolition would serve Israeli objectives. Our primary duty is 
to adhere to the PLO Charter while criticizing its current 
policy and the Israeli enemy who occupies our land. 
  [Farran] If we think of the agreements that have been 
concluded and the concessions that the Palestinians have made as 
representing the end of the negotiations, can we say that 
'Arafat is finished? 
  [Al-Hasan] The interim solution that has been reached is a 
prelude to the final solution and determines its shape. We in 
the opposition have lost some points but won others. We have 
lost because the general framework of the final solution has 
been drawn. However, we have made two important gains so far. 
  The first gain is the growing opposition within and outside 
the PLO. Major intellectuals and the patriotic press have 
mobilized our people against the political line pursued in the 
negotiations. This is why the latest Cairo Agreement was coolly 
received, unlike the reception accorded to the Oslo agreement 
and the first Cairo agreement. The people had the illusion that 
the agreements called for the return of 800,000 displaced 
Palestinians, that the Israelis were going to withdraw from the 
occupied territories, and that a Palestinian state was going to 
be established. This illusion has dissipated. 
  Our second gain is in our ability to prevent, so far, the 
ratification of the mutual PLO-Israeli letters, which included 
mutual PLO, Israeli recognition and offered a pledge to overturn 
the PLO Charter. We declared that if PLO institutions ratified 
those letters we would adopt a course other than dialogue. This 
means we would seek the people's support for more far-reaching 
measures. The Palestinian people's reception of the second 
Cairo agreement offers hope that the public response will be 
even stronger. 
  The danger lies in the final solution. The result of our 
struggle against this solution will determine whether in the 
future we will live in an Israeli era marked by Israeli hegemony 
or in an Arab-Israeli era that has some form of balance. 
  [Farran] You suggest that there is a possibility for 
reforming the political line. Knowing that the second Cairo 
agreement prohibits provocation [al-tahrid], how do you see this 
as a possibility? 
  [Al-Hasan] We do not see the deployment of Palestinian 
police 
as a negative development. Nor do we see it as a historic 
achievement. It is an event with no historic significance. The 
economic agreement and Israeli hegemony have a negative historic 
significance, however. We are faced with two major achievements 
of the Zionist scheme: The political annexation [ilhaq] and 
economic annexation [of Palestinians] to Israel. 
  Economic annexation undermines the most important victory of 
the intifadah. The latter made our people self-reliant in the 
face of the Israeli blockade. Because of the intifadah, our 
people developed their agricultural and industrial resources. 
Under the intifadah, agricultural production went up 11 percent 
and industrial production by 4 percent. 
  The recent economic agreement, however, restored economic 
interdependence because it treated the West Bank, Gaza, and the 
land occupied in 1948 as one open trade zone with one tariff 
system. With some exceptions, the tariff system is basically 
unified. Economic interdependence does not lead to independence 
but to closer unity. 
  Political annexation is clearly manifested in the tasks of 
the legislative council that will be elected. The recent Cairo 
agreement states that the legislative council will examine bills 
referred to it by a joint Israeli-Palestinian committee. Once 
the council makes a decision, the bill will be referred back to 
the committee. If Israel agrees, it will go into effect, 
otherwise it will be overruled. 
  Several matters will be decided upon in the near future. 
Most important of these is the future of the land. This will 
be a test of whether economic and political annexation will be 
temporary or permanent. The issue of land and the issue of 
Jerusalem and its future are matters that will shape the final 
settlement. 
  We have to prepare ourselves to fight the battle concerning 
the final settlement on the following principles: 
  First, we should resist the economic annexation introduced 
by 
the Paris agreement. The agreement involves practical measures 
and we should call on our people to resist this annexation. 
  Secondly, we should resist political annexation. The 
agreement says that the Israelis and Palestinians on one hand 
will meet with the Jordanians and Egyptians on the other hand to 
discuss ways of promoting cooperation. This means that 
Palestinian relations with the Arabs have become an 
Israeli-Palestinian, not a Palestinian, matter. 
  Furthermore, Israel does not want to withdraw from the West 
Bank. It wants to legitimize its presence in the West Bank 
through a Palestinian-Israeli agreement that would keep the 
Israeli Army in the West Bank as an allied army. We seek to 
unite Palestinian and Arab efforts to prevent Israel from taking 
the land. We want to reverse the imminent military annexation. 
  We have to understand that we will only defeat the Oslo 
agreement through defeating the Israeli concept of a final 
settlement, that is, through establishing economic unity between 
Palestine and Jordan first and then between Palestine, Jordan, 
Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq. 
  [Farran] You still hope that 'Arafat, despite all the 
concessions he made, will lead the battle for a final settlement? 
  [Al-Hasan] The Palestinian people and their political forces 
are divided. The split appears in every Palestinian 
organization. Therefore, I think that we should not waste time 
on secondary issues. 
  [Farran] Such as? 
  [Al-Hasan] Such as discussing the pattern in which 
Palestinian decisions are made, because this pattern will not 
change. Not that we support this pattern, of which I am one 
victim. But focusing on this issue will not do us much good. 
The battle for the land, however, can rally the people. 
Defending the land, defending Jerusalem and the right of 
return, staying firm on matters that fire up the people, these 
are matters that will rally the people and entice them to defend 
their rights. For example, the farmers in the al-Mawasi in 
Gaza, an agricultural area of 13 square km, shouted foul when 
the recent security agreement gave their land to the Israelis. 
The Israelis, they noted, have not taken this area since Gaza 
was occupied in 1967, why should the Cairo agreement give it to 
them now? 
  Worrying about the interests of the people makes our 
movement 
acceptable. Our battle is to address the people and create new 
facts that will help our people restore their rights. 
  [Farran] Would you say that questioning 'Arafat's 
leadership and seeking to replace him is a marginal issue? 
  [Al-Hasan] Handling an issue politically, that is, seeking 
to 
alter the political line, does not mean marginalizing it. I 
believe that in politics a marginal issue is one that you cannot 
settle, even if it is a real task. If we focused on merely 
important issues rather than actually vital ones, we would be 
serving the Oslo policy line. The really vital thing is to seek 
the public's support. The opposition cannot make internal 
changes because current Arab and international circumstances do 
not help it to do so. The important thing is to seek the 
people's support, who will be encouraged by our opposition to 
demand their rights. I will give you an example. A large 
number of personalities were invited to the second Cairo 
agreement signing ceremony. Some 93 of them, including 25 
important figures living inside the occupied territories, did 
not come. The absence of Hanan 'Ashrawi, Sa'ib 'Urayqat, Ahmad 
Rashid, Bassam al- Shak'ah, and Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, and the 
cool popular response to the latest agreement are good signs. 
They will help us wage the struggle for the final solution. 
  [Farran] Don't the Fatah oppositionists intend to find a 
replacement for 'Arafat? 
  [Al-Hasan] No such thing is being considered. 
  [Farran] You used to be a nominee to replace 'Arafat. Is 
this matter still in the cards? 
  [Al-Hasan] At one time the various opposition forces thought 
of forming an alternative PLO. There were discussions about its 
structure and so on. Personally, I do not think this is the 
answer. What is coming will be worse than Oslo. What is coming 
is a proclamation of a Palestinian state based on an 
Israeli-Palestinian military alliance. The Israelis want a 
barren Palestinian state that will be an economic, political, 
and military annex of Israel. In articles I wrote I described it 
as the illusory state. Why wouldn't the Israelis accept such a 
state? What we must do is alert the public to future 
possibilities. We must create facts that will prevent these 
possibilities. I want to raise a basic point here: The battle 
is no longer between two sides alone because the solution will 
be part of a regional arrangement. What happens in the West 
Bank will affect the interests of Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria 
because the agreement will be general. For this reason, I hope 
and wager that these countries will have an opinion on what will 
happen to defend their interests. 
  [Farran] Which Palestinian opposition factions agree with 
your views on how to confront the Gaza-Jericho agreement? 
  [Al-Hasan] I do not think that there are great differences 
between me and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine 
[PFLP], the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine 
[DFLP], and the Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine-General Command [PFLP-GC]. I also believe that the 
brothers in Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], following their 
recent political declaration, have only one course of action 
open. They -- together with the PFLP, DFLP, and the PFLP-GC -- 
will have to escalate the confrontation with the enemy, explain 
the issues to the people, and mobilize them against concessions 
pertaining to Jerusalem, other territories, and the right of 
return. They must turn the confrontation into one between all 
the people and the Oslo policy, not between a group of 
oppositionists and a group in Tunis. 
  [Farran] Can you be active abroad or will you return to the 
territories? 
  [Al-Hasan] I will not be a member of the authority that is 
being established, although my name is being proposed. It is 
not reasonable for me to be part of an authority whose current 
policy I oppose. 
  [Farran] You will stay abroad then? 
  [Al-Hasan] Probably. 
  [Farran] Is there a deal between 'Arafat and Hamas? What 
does it call for? 
  [Al-Hasan] I do not think there is a deal between Hamas and 
'Arafat. Nevertheless, it is illogical to allow Palestinian 
internal strife for two reasons: The public would not accept it 
and it would serve Israeli interests. The situation in the Gaza 
Strip is different from the situation in the West Bank. In 
Gaza, where Israel has withdrawn from 70 percent of the 
territory, there is a strong Hamas presence and there will be a 
large deployment of Palestinian police. I do not believe that 
local conditions in Gaza encourage conflict between the police 
and Hamas. We must wait and see how things will develop, 
however. The PLO Executive Committee is sending envoys to all 
local forces to ensure no infighting occurs and to encourage 
dialogue. 
  [Farran] Will Faruq Qaddumi be part of the Palestinian 
Authority? 
  [Al-Hasan] The Political Department is not supposed to be 
part of the authority. Furthermore, Israel will not allow 
Abu-al-Lutf (Qaddumi), who is actually opposed to the Oslo 
agreement, to enter the territories as head of the Political 
Department. He might become part of the Civil Authority and be 
given another post. 
  [Farran] Is Qaddumi's name being proposed? 
  [Al-Hasan] Regrettably, we have reached the stage where 
Israel is deciding who will enter and who will not. Personally, 
I do not know what is happening exactly, but I do not believe 
that brother Abu-al-Lutf will be part of the Palestinian 
Authority. 
  [Farran] Does this mean that he is an actual opponent of 
'Arafat? 
  [Al-Hasan] He is among the opposition but has a special way 
of doing that. He does not agree with my way of presenting 
issues. I believe that all issues must be submitted to the 
people to let them know what is happening. I wager on the 
people and their role in defending their interests. 
Abu-al-Lutf, who is Fatah Central Committee secretary, has a 
different view. Nevertheless, he is really opposed to the 
current policies. 
  [Farran] Will two Palestinian axes appear, one in Gaza and 
the other in Tunis? Where will you stand on this? 
  [Al-Hasan] This is what we began our dialogue with. I do not 
believe it will happen. We will not adopt stances on behalf of 
the people. Let the people themselves adopt a stance. Without 
a definite stance the people will not be able to do anything. 
Matters are very complicated now. The people are asked to vote 
in elections, although the autonomy authority in the West Bank 
will not take over the settlements, Greater Jerusalem, or the 
large Israeli Army's deployment areas in the West Bank and the 
Jordan Valley. The Palestinian authority will not take over 
more than 40 or 50 percent of the West Bank's territory. The 
remainder, inhabited by more than 250,000 Palestinians, will 
remain under Israeli sovereignty. Is this not a major problem 
that requires much thought? 
  In Gaza the situation is different because the Israeli 
settlements are border territories, not Palestinian population 
centers. In the West Bank the situation is very entangled and 
the implementation of autonomy will be plagued by frictions. In 
actual terms there will be a canton in Gaza, another in Jericho, 
a third in Hebron and the villages around it, a fourth in Nablus 
and its villages, and a fifth in other Palestinian populated 
areas whose status will not be discussed until the final stage. 
Add to this that an Israeli autonomy already exists in the 
settlements themselves. 
  In this complex situation the people will discover that they 
cannot travel from one point to another and that Israel controls 
two-thirds of the water resources, which will make it difficult 
for them to develop their agriculture. In view of all this, 
shouldn't we explain these problems to the people and invite 
them to adopt the position they wish to hold? 
  [Farran] Can 'Arafat go beyond the articles of the 
agreement and endorse the Palestinian people's will to fulfill 
his demands? 
  [Al-Hasan] The question should be whether the counteropinion 
will succeed in making the Palestinian people force their 
leadership in Gaza and Jericho to stand by them rather than by 
Rabin if a dispute develops with him. 
  If they fail to do that, the people will have their say. We 
wager on the people. If we fail to develop grassroots support 
to undertake that task, we will turn into mere commentators on 
events. Our task today is to find ways to cope with future 
eventualities. I am optimistic because this agreement bears the 
germ of contradiction. Welcome to these contradictions. If a 
day comes on which Rabin says to hell with the agreement, we 
will have a unique point of accord with him. 
  [Farran] Then you do not think that it is probable that 
these 
axes will develop? 
  [Al-Hasan] I do not favor a dispute among various axes. I 
prefer to push the people to take a stance. Hence the role of 
popular instigation, which is done by confronting the enemy via 
propaganda, the media, and organization. 
  [Farran] But the agreement leaves no room for instigation? 
  [Al-Hasan] The current political line and events have given 
birth to two or more stances and the process continues. What 
you call axes I call generated stances. The question is will 
matters be handled through conflict at the top level? This is 
what some brothers in and outside Fatah believe. 
  I believe that a conflict at the top will not stop the Oslo 
agreement. What will stop the Oslo agreement is doing what we 
believe will stop it. It is the people who can do that. The 
conflict among the various stances in Tunis is a conflict within 
closed rooms that achieves nothing. 
  Therefore, we have to clarify matters and draw up a plan. 
Since the agreement bears the germ of contradiction, let us try 
to exploit these future contradictions. 
  [Farran] What is the role of Faysal al-Husayni in Jerusalem? 
  [Al-Hasan] Al-Husayni's failure to attend the signing 
ceremony in Cairo affirms that he has returned to himself and 
realized that an agreement was being signed while Jerusalem was 
still under siege and that in a few months it would become clear 
that Jerusalem had nothing to do with autonomy. This is exactly 
what 'Abd-al-Shafi discovered. Al-Husayni is going in the same 
direction we are. But he is not coordinating with us because 
this will shower him with curses. This certifies that the 
opposition has succeeded in turning its words into deeds to the 
extent that the leaders who are living among the people are now 
obliged to take the popular stance into consideration in their 
areas, without having to pay much tribute to Tunis. 
  The growth of these powers and figures will prompt us to 
bolster them and demand a popular referendum on the issues they 
raise. 
  [Farran] Can 'Arafat rule democratically? 
  [Al-Hasan] Personally, I do not believe the Palestinians are 
being offered a democratic rule. I therefore refuse to discuss 
the issue of Palestinian agricultural and industrial development 
as long as there is an occupation. I think that the most 
serious thing that the Palestinians were lured into was 
discussing these issues under occupation. 
  For instance, elections will be held to guarantee democracy 
for the Palestinian people according to the Oslo agreement. I 
want elections that ensure my right to self-determination; I do 
not want elections for democracy. What kind of democracy is 
that exercised under occupation? Therefore, we have to focus on 
the central issue of ending the occupation before we discuss 
things like agricultural or industrial development. Development 
under occupation consecrates the idea of integration with the 
occupation. 
  [Farran] You don't support the elections? 
  [Al-Hasan] Elections under occupation will not achieve their 
goal. If the council that will be elected will only discuss the 
decisions referred to it, it will not be completely sovereign. 
I am not opposed to the principle of elections. I believe in 
democracy and in the people's right and their rule. I believe 
that an expanded parliament has the final say, but we must 
obtain sovereignty. I will not state my final view of the 
elections until after the elections law that is being discussed 
in Washington has been endorsed. If a party is deprived of 
participation in the elections because it was not a party to the 
Oslo talks, we will then state our stance on these undemocratic 
elections. This is because, as we have seen today, to be 
released from jail a detainee must sign a paper affirming his 
agreement on the Oslo talks and pledging not to carry out 
terrorist operations. So what is this independence, democracy, 
and freedom of expression? In this respect I support the 
appointment of all members of the Palestinian authority from 
inside [the occupied territories]. 
  [Farran] You were threatened with dismissal from the Central 
Committee at its latest meeting in Amman. Have you prepared 
yourself for such a situation? 
  [Al-Hasan] My dismissal was discussed and I was surprised at 
the number of those who defended me and rejected this measure 
against me inside the Central Committee. Since I enjoy this 
great support, there is no fear. I do not think of this issue. 
  [Farran] Do you think of establishing a legal office as 
Hanan 
'Ashrawi has done? 
  [Al-Hasan] I greet my brothers in the Legal Committee that 
was formed by important figures. We have full confidence in 
them and that they will defend Palestinian human rights. 
  [Farran] Can the self-rule authority control the 
contradictions in the situation and how? 
  [Al-Hasan] We believe that it will not be able to control 
the 
situation because it is overlapping. The Israelis phased the 
negotiations to enmesh the Palestinian Authority in these 
contradictions so that they may impose new conditions because 
they do not want to leave the West bank. In addition, the size 
of the opposition inside [the occupied territories] is large and 
reaches 60 to 90 percent. 
  [Farran] Which organizations inside [the occupied 
territories] are more embarrassing to Yasir 'Arafat? 
  [Al-Hasan] Fatah first and then the Islamic trend 
represented 
in "Hamas" and "al-Jihad." Both these groups are organized and 
perform social work in addition to confronting the occupation. 
It is no coincidence that they managed to gain support from 
other forces. However, we will compete with them and try to 
restore our positions. Let the rivals compete. 
  [Farran] If you believe that the concessions that 'Arafat 
has 
made violate the logic of the revolution and of Palestinian 
rights, do you think this justifies a call for his trial, given 
these concessions and the U.S. and Israeli statements that his 
personality is moody and unbalanced? 
  [Al-Hasan] I will not answer this question because it is 
useless. 
  [Farran] Do you believe that the United States has a 
replacement for 'Arafat? 
  [Al-Hasan] I have no answer.

  [Text] President Husni Mubarak this morning received Haydar 
Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, envoy of 'Ali Salim al-Bid [former Yemeni 
vice president]. The meeting was attended by Foreign Minister 
'Amr Musa. 
  Al-'Attas stated after the meeting that they discussed the 
situation in Yemen. He said: We thank Egypt and President 
Mubarak for all the efforts that have been made and are being 
made to end the war in Yemen and to deal with the situation in a 
way that would ensure stability in the country. He said that he 
will continue his consultations with the officials in Egypt, the 
other Arab states, and the friendly states. 
  Asked whether the purpose of his tour is to seek recognition 
for Democratic Yemen, he said: What we are interested in right 
now is to stop the war. He noted that the continuation of the 
war is a loss not only for Yemen but also for all the Arab 
countries. Al-'Attas said: We are demanding an end to this war 
and the withdrawal of the forces to the positions they held 
before 22 May 1990, that is before the unity. Then it would be 
possible to conduct a dialogue on all the issues and on the ways 
to resolve them. This includes the effects of the war and the 
future of Yemen. 
  Asked about the statement of Yemeni Planning Minister 
'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani that contacts are taking place between 
Sanaa and members of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], al-'Attas 
said: There are no members in the YSP conducting mediation 
independently from the party leadership. But there are other 
national figures, led by Brigadier General Mujahid 
Abu-al-Shawarib, a principal member of the Dialogue Committee of 
the national and political forces who earlier held consultations 
with a number of figures outside the country. When some ideas 
began to take shape, 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih contacted these 
figures and dissuaded them from continuing these efforts. 
Whereas, we welcome any Yemeni or other efforts. He said that 
these ideas have now been resurrected. He noted that they are 
ready to consider any form of dialogue through the leadership in 
southern Yemen. 
  Answering a question about the aid that Saudi Arabia is 
providing to South Yemen, al-'Attas said: There are many claims 
in this regard that aim at extortion. But we have confidence in 
the capabilities of our people, all our brothers, and all our 
friends who help us. 
  Asked how the military operations are proceeding now, 
al-'Attas said that there are many victims because the 
leadership in the north is involving thousands of our Yemeni 
people in the war with no consideration for the number of 
victims. We are sorry for this loss. He added: War is bound 
to break any ties of love among the Yemeni people. It will also 
create hatred, problems, and acts of revenge among the people. 
This war was the first blow to Yemeni unity. 
  Asked South Yemen's response if the issue were raised in the 
UN Security Council, al-'Attas said: We indeed prefer raising 
the issue at the Security Council, which can help stop the war. 
He explained that when South Yemen made the decision to restore 
the situation to what it was before 22 May 1990, it sought to 
protect the disintegration of Yemen into several states. When 
the situation returns to what it was before 22 May, there will 
be a time to think and proceed toward the future with complete 
clarity. He said that in the light of the current situation, 
the existence of two states in Yemen would be better for all 
concerned. 
  Answering a question about al-Iryani's statement yesterday 
that the northern forces have decided not to enter Aden, 
al-'Attas said: They are unable to enter Aden. Had they been 
able to enter Aden by force, they would have done so. They have 
often declared that they will end the war within 48 hours, and 
here we are in the fourth week of fighting. 
  Answering a question about what was discussed during his 
meeting with President Mubarak, al-'Attas said: I briefed 
President Mubarak on the situation in Yemen and the president's 
reaction was positive regarding the need to end the problems in 
Yemen. He noted that he is currently making a tour of the area, 
and that he will leave for Syria after his visit to Egypt. 
  Al-'Attas denied Aden's responsibility for the outbreak of 
fighting, emphasizing that Sanaa started the war. Al-'Attas 
then reviewed the developments that took place following the 
signing of the Pledge and Agreement Document in Jordan and the 
cabinet meetings held in Aden and Ta'izz to implement the 
document.

militia have recently joined the Islamic Army and Mojahedin 
along with their men. According to reports reaching the BAKHTAR 
INFORMATION AGENCY, three militia commanders, Commander Sayed 
Taher, Commander Qader Shah, and Commander Hafif who were in the 
ranks of the infamous Golboddin-Dostam militia in a battalion 
located around the electricity project in Tashqhorghan, have 
joined the unit of Commander Hamidullah [word indistinct] along 
with their weapons and men. They expressed regret over their 
past activities. The men from the Army post expressed their 
indignation against the militia and pledged to continue the 
jihad to the end until the complete elimination of the militia. 
  Our correspondent adds that since the failed coup d'etat of 
Karmal-Golboddin-Dostam on 1 January until now, dozens of

activities, have ended their hostilities with the Islamic State, 
and continue their jihad and struggle against the militia 
alongside the ranks of the mojahedin.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Mas'ud Khales: "An Eye for an Eye"] </F>
  [Text] In the early hours of Saturday a group of special 
commandos of the Zionist regime carried out a terrorist act and 
kidnapped Mustafa al-Dirani, the leader of Lebanon's faithful 
resistance. Supported by two helicopters and with the help of 
local elements, the commando group violated Lebanon's 
sovereignty, raided the home of Mustafa al-Dirani, and, after 
threatening al-Dirani's wife and children, abducted him and took 
him to occupied Palestine. Hours after this operation, the prime 
minister and foreign minister of the Zionist regime admitted the 
"kidnapping" and praised and encouraged the abductors. Lauding 
this attempt, Yitzhaq Rabin said al-Dirani was not abducted for 
the sake of a transaction, but to help find Ron Arad. Ron Arad 
is an Israeli pilot whose plane was hit by anti-air missiles in 
1986 when he was bombing Palestinian camps in Sidon and was 
taken captive by the Muslim forces. 
  This is the second such act by the Zionist regime since the 
release of all the Western hostages in Lebanon. Two years ago 
Zionist regime helicopters fired at a car carrying Hizballah 
leader Sayyid 'Abbas al-Musawi and martyred him, his wife, and 
his children. 
  The recent "kidnapping" is not the first such act by the 
Zionist regime; it will possibly not be the last. In view of 
the time at which this incident took place, there are some 
important points that should be stated and some lessons to be 
learned. 
  1. This act showed that despite the recent commotion and the 
ridiculous show by Cairo, the fulfillment of peace in the Middle 
East is nothing but a mirage. Actually, by kidnapping Mustafa 
al-Dirani at a time when the world community led by America is 
ringing the so-called bells of peace, Israel showed that the 
peace process is like a train full of Arab and Palestinian 
passengers who do not know their final destination. 
  2. The most optimistic assessment of the silence by the West 
and international forums on Israel's "state terrorism" is that 
this silence stems from their confusion over the actions by the 
Zionists ruling occupied Palestine; and if their silence does 
not mean confirmation, they should prove this by their deeds. 
It seems a new opportunity has emerged for all the governments 
that are accused of terrorism to question the U.S. policy of 
double standards on terrorism. Although propounding this topic 
in international organizations will be confronted with America's 
veto as usual, it will be an effort by the accused to put forth 
a new interpretation of terrorism and its limits. 
  3. This act also showed that despite what the world 
community thinks, the hostage file has not yet closed and Israel 
continues to use hostage-taking as a method to forward its 
objectives. In this case, combatant groups--wherever they 
are--should be granted the "right" to use the same method the 
enemy resorts to at the peak of its strength. 
  Unfortunately during the past years the enemy's 
psychological 
war against the combatant Palestinian and Lebanese groups has 
been effective and--at the peak of their oppression--these 
groups have been accused of terrorism and kidnapping, while--at 
the peak of its power and with international support for the 
so-called peace process--the enemy continues to use this method. 
The world community should clarify where the policy of "double 
standards" stands. Naturally the oppressed cannot be expected 
to unilaterally close this file. No sane person would make such 
a recommendation. If Mustafa al-Dirani cannot be safe in his 
home, why should the Zionists be safe in their homes? 
  4. With this act, the Zionist regime showed that it has not 
given up its efforts to advance its aggressive objectives under 
any condition and that world public opinion and reaction is 
worth nothing to it. If this is so, then those whose territory 
is occupied by the enemy will be entitled to reserve the right 
to set limitations aside to defend themselves and to oust the 
enemy and to choose the time and the venue for their 
confrontation with the enemy. According to Hizballah, no part 
of Lebanon is safe for the Muslims. Under such circumstances, 
rendering every area insecure for the Zionists and their mentors 
within the framework of the policy of retaliation is a just act 
that should not be protested. Any protest should be aimed at a 
usurping government that supports terrorism and attaches no 
value to public opinion.

<F P=106> [Report by Fatinah al-Dajani: "Prince Hasan: We Are </F>
Willing to Sign Peace Treaty After Settling Outstanding 
Questions With Israel"] 
  [Text] London -- Jordanian Crown Prince Hasan Bin-Talal 
has said that Jordan is willing to sign a peace treaty with 
Israel when all outstanding questions related to border 
demarcation, refugees, water, and security, in addition to the 
final status of Jerusalem, have been settled. He added that 
peace arrangements have to be made on all tracks, including the 
Syrian and Lebanese tracks. 
  He proposed several mechanisms to solve some problems like 
setting up a border committee to demarcate the border and 
setting up a center for resolving disputes in the Middle East. 
  In a lecture delivered at the Royal Armed Forces Institute 
for General Studies in London yesterday, he pointed out that the 
Jordanian-U.S.-Israeli working committee set up to examine 
issues that concern Jordan "could be upgraded to ministerial 
level." 
  He said that "last year's events opened the door to peace in 
the Middle East, and mutual recognition between the PLO and 
Israel gave the region an unprecedented opportunity to resolve 
the Arab-Israeli dispute." He added that the historic agreement 
on Gaza and Jericho "is another step in the right direction." 
  He went on: "We have reached the stage in which the concept 
of peace should be negotiated in detail." He pointed to the 
existence of "numerous issues which should be negotiated before 
reaching a comprehensive peace. And Jordan will be willing to 
reach a peace treaty when the questions included on the agenda 
we have reached with Israel have been discussed and resolved in 
a manner acceptable to all parties." He pointed out that among 
these issues are "the border, refugees, security, and water, 
which are the essence of peacemaking." 
  He said that it is difficult to reach arrangements regarding 
these questions before the border and security questions have 
been resolved. Because it is illogical to talk about Jordanian 
and Israeli concerns and interests before determining what 
"Jordan" and "Israel" are. He described the settlements as a 
time bomb which the organizations opposed to peace and settlers 
can use to obstruct the peace process. He said that "peace 
cannot be achieved in these conditions." 
  He pointed out that Jordan had made several proposals to 
tackle the border and security problems. They included setting 
up a border committee to try to demarcate the border in a bid to 
achieve a lasting regional peace. As for the refugees, "we are 
negotiating within the boundaries of international law." 
  He said that the final status of Jerusalem is one of the 
issues attracting great interest and preoccupying the world as a 
whole. He urged "clear separation between the religious and the 
political" with respect to the city, because Jerusalem belongs 
to all religions, hence no single state should have full 
sovereignty over it. 
  He added: "We have made detailed proposals on this 
separation, because we believe that a suitable solution to the 
Jerusalem issue is necessary in the search for peace." 
  He added that Jordan has also implemented several 
confidence-building measures, including opening banks in the 
occupied Palestinian territories, signing an economic agreement 
with the Palestinians, training Palestinian police, and setting 
up a Jordanian-Israeli-U.S. committee to examine questions that 
concern Jordan. 
  He called for drawing up a framework for cooperation and 
security in the Middle East along the lines of the Conference on 
Security and Cooperation in Europe, in order to achieve a 
lasting peace in the region. He added that that conference does 
not represent an alternative to the peace process but 
complements it. He called for establishing a free zone for 
trade in the Middle East allowing manpower, goods, capital, and 
services to move freely. He said that securing a Middle East 
free trade agreement (MEFTA) would give the region the 
opportunity to play a constructive role in the world economy. 
He also said that a program similar to the GATT in Europe might 
be the best way to handle the economic burdens of the 
Arab-Israeli dispute and to establish a sound trade and 
investment system. 
  He stressed that "peace should be comprehensive and just, so 
that it will be a lasting peace. And everyone should be given 
the opportunity and the tools to play a role in building a new 
Middle East system." He said that the Arab-Israeli conflict has 
had an impact on the region as a whole and resulted in the 
accumulation of debts and demographic pressures on states with 
limited resources. However, he pointed out that Jordan will do 
its utmost to help the self-rule areas. 
  Asked about economic integration and its threats to the 
Middle East region in view of the Israeli superiority, he said 
that, in view of the lack of a concept and a mechanism for these 
matters, they should be discussed in the framework of the 
multilateral talks concerning the Middle East. 
  Answering a question put to him, he said that the dispute in 
Yemen reminds us of the strategic importance of the Red Sea.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Gentlemen: When Israel talks about the kind of 
peace it is interested in, it does not hesitate to launch a 
campaign of allegations and accusations, and to claim that it 
has provided what is needed to make progress in the peace 
process possible. Nor does it hesitate to claim that the Arab 
party is responsible for halting this progress. It does not 
conceal that it wants complete Arab recognition, an end to the 
Arab boycott, open borders, established diplomatic and economic 
ties, and so forth, without its officials uttering the words 
"complete withdrawal," which they have all failed to say so far. 
  Here, we can see the large gap separating Israel's proposals 
and the principles and foundations of the peace process, 
particularly the UN resolutions on whose basis the regional 
peace process started. The Israeli leaders are apparently still 
gambling on drawing Syria into bargaining over land and rights, 
despite the conviction that it is impossible to make peace with 
Syria without returning the entire Syrian Golan Heights, without 
Israel's withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories, and 
without establishing just and comprehensive peace in an area 
that will not see stability or tranquility without a just 
solution and a comprehensive peace. 
  As long as the Israelis insist on marketing their own 
concept 
of peace, their own excuses for keeping land, and their own 
incomplete view of peace in the region -- a view based on 
individual solutions and unilateral deals -- it is only natural 
that the climate of disappointment persists. 
  Political observers in the Arab and international arenas 
realize that Israel is responsible for these disappointments and 
for the failure of international efforts so far to achieve any 
results. They realize Israel is responsible for the failure to 
resume the bilateral talks, and, consequently, for not achieving 
any progress worth mentioning in the entire peace process. 
  Therefore, the whole world now realizes, more than at any 
time before, what direction has to be followed, and where 
pressure should be applied to activate the peace process and 
save what is left of it in a responsible and serious way. 
  We do not think anyone in this world wants Arabs to 
relinquish their rights and their land, or to abandon the most 
basic principles on which the peace process was based. This 
would not achieve peace. Even if it was achieved superficially 
in one aspect, it would not survive. In this case, it would be 
an empty peace, lacking the most basic principles of continuity. 
  Establishing peace and seizing the opportunities available 
today to achieve it require, before anything else, a commitment 
to implementing the UN resolutions in letter and spirit, and 
complete withdrawal to the borders that existed before the 
aggression of June 1967. Only then will the statement on 
goodwill, which the Israelis keep bragging about, come forth. 
The occupied territories are Arab and the usurped rights are 
Arab, not the opposite.

    [Editorial report] The following review of the 20 May issue 
of Cairo AL-SHA'B summarizes articles that are Islamic in nature. 
<H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>
  1. Trade Unions Express Solidarity With Lawyers After Attack 
  2. Correspondents Describe Violence at Lawyers' 
Demonstration 
  3. Lawyers Association Doyen Interviewed 
  4. Editor Says Fall of Government Matter of Time 
  5. Human Rights Organizations Condemn Attack on Lawyers 
  6. Muslim Brotherhood Issues Statement on Recent Violence 
  7. Politicians, Trade Unionists React Angrily to Police 
Violence 
  8. Will Shaykh al-Ghazali Deliver 'Id al-Adha Sermon? 
<H5>  TRADE UNIONS EXPRESS SOLIDARITY WITH LAWYERS AFTER ATTACK </H5>
  The newspaper devotes its front page and many inside pages 
to 
reports, comments, interviews, and pictures of the government's 
violent confrontation of the demonstration staged by the Lawyers 
Association [LA] in Cairo on 17 May to protest the death of 
lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani while in police custody. Under the 
banner headline "Flagrant Aggression Against the Lawyers' 
Demonstration," Ashraf Khalil writes a 600-word report on pages 
1 and 7 in which he says representatives of the various 
professional associations held an emergency meeting to discuss 
the developments in the LA "after the security forces shelled 
their peaceful march with rockets and tear gas bombs." The 
report says the conferees were demanding the immediate release 
of detained LA Council members and a speedy investigation into 
the circumstances that led to the death of Lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith 
Madani. The conferees are also cited as having expressed full 
solidarity with the LA Council. According to the report, the LA 
Council officially asked the public prosecutor "to immediately 
investigate the security forces' excesses" against the lawyers. 
The Council declared a state of emergency and considered itself 
in permanent session. A statement from the Council reportedly 
blames the interior minister and security commanders for the 
incidents. The statement demands the immediate release of all 
detained lawyers and rejects the charges brought against them. 
  A 600-word report by 'Ala' al-Bahhar and Khalid Yunus on 
page 
4 discusses the arrest of several leading LA council members and 
other activist lawyers. It says security forces raided the 
houses of those people at dawn and took them to police stations. 
The report says the lawyers formed a committee to defend the 
detainees and rushed to the office of the public prosecutor to 
condemn the "oppressive measures." 
<H5>  CORRESPONDENTS DESCRIBE VIOLENCE AT LAWYERS' DEMONSTRATION </H5>
  On pages 2 and 3, the paper gives an on-the-spot account of 
what it describes as "the brutal aggression against lawyers" in 
front of the LA headquarters in Cairo. It introduces its 
stories -- a 800-word report by 'Abd-al-Rahman Isma'il on page 
2, a 700-word report by Salah Budaywi on page 2, and an 
1,500-word report by Mu'tazz al-Hadidi and Subhi Buhayri on page 
3 -- by an unattributed comment that reads in part: "The 
government has added to its criminal antihuman rights record two 
new characteristics: stupidity and ignorance. Can any sane 
person attack the protectors of law with bullets and tear gas 
inside their association? It is an open invitation in the most 
intense form of extremism, and an opening to the doors of hell. 
It gives violence -- which all of us reject -- a fertile soil 
to flourish and take full control." The comment adds: "The 
government perpetrated its crime and was caught red-handed. The 
evidence is conclusive. So, what is the government waiting for 
before it leaves? Through its unsuccessful policy, the 
government has placed the entire country on the edge of a 
volcano that may erupt at any moment if the ignorant ones fail 
to return to their senses." 
  The three reports detail the situation before, during, and 
after the confrontation between the lawyers and the security 
forces in Cairo. They describe the heavy security cordon 
imposed around the LA building before the demonstration, how 
police officers threatened the organizers of the march and 
harassed journalists, how "hundreds" of lawyers suffocated from 
tear gas, and how security forces chased lawyers and citizens in 
nearby streets and conducted random arrest campaigns. The 
reports also cite lawyer leaders addressing the crowd before the 
demonstration. They reportedly demanded that the government 
stop torture and exceptional rules, and they urged lawyers to 
demonstrate unity and remain the strong defenders of law and 
freedom. 

<H5>    LAWYERS ASSOCIATION DOYEN INTERVIEWED </H5>
  Page 2 also contains an approximately 1,500-word interview 
with Ahmad al-Khawajah, the doyen of the Lawyers Association, 
who, unlike most of the LA Council members, is not affiliated 
with the Islamic trend. Al-Khawajah refuses to blame the 
government for the incidents, but he describes the confrontation 
as "a serious setback for democracy." He notes the "over 
enthusiasm" of some young lawyers and says the problems arising 
from lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani's death could have been solved 
through dialogue. Expressing his belief that there are 
suspicious circumstances behind Madani's death, he explains his 
efforts and contacts to reveal the truth of the matter. 
<H5>  EDITOR SAYS FALL OF GOVERNMENT MATTER OF TIME </H5>
  In a 1,000-word article entitled "The Government Is Banging 
Its Head Against the Wall", Chief Editor Majdi Ahmad Husayn 
writes on page 1 that the government opted for "the brute force" 
to face the lawyers' moves after the "torture to death" of one 
of their colleagues. This, he says, reflects the weakness of 
the government, which fears that even a single demonstration may 
bring it down. Noting the various forms of oppression that the 
government uses to impose itself on the people by force, Husayn 
comments: "I tell you: your attempts will go in vain. 
Prolonging the life of a patient in the intensive care unit by 
artificial means will not be useful. It will only delay the 
date of the funeral, but the funeral is inevitable, as you know. 
The country cannot be ruled by tear gas and plastic bullets; 
this is new proof of the political void which the government and 
the hollow ruling party represent." 
<H5>  HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS CONDEMN ATTACK ON LAWYERS </H5>
  Page 4 contains unattributed reports on statements by the 
Egyptian Organization of Human Rights [EOHR] and the 
London-Based Liberty organization denouncing the attack against 
the lawyers. The Egyptian organization's statement reportedly 
says: "The EOHR condemns the use of force by the security 
forces to break up the peaceful demonstration of the Egyptian 
lawyers because it is a violation of Article 54 of the Egyptian 
Constitution, which gives citizens the right to gather in a 
peaceful manner without prior notice. It is also a violation of 
Egypt's international obligations under Article 21 of the 
international convention on civilian and political rights, which 
was ratified by the Egyptian Government. The EOHR views the 
attack as new incriminating evidence against the authorities' 
position toward the citizens' right to express their views by 
all peaceful means, foremost through demonstrations and peaceful 
gathering." The EOHR also reportedly sent a letter to President 
Mubarak expressing "profound fears" that lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith 
Madani died as a result of torture. The letter urges the 
president to conduct an immediate and honest inquiry into his 
death. 
<H5>  MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD ISSUES STATEMENT ON RECENT VIOLENCE </H5>
  Page 4 also includes a 700-word report on a statement by the 
Muslim Brotherhood discussing the recent developments and 
maintaining that the group has never advocated sedition or 
violent confrontations. 
<H5>  POLITICIANS, TRADE UNIONISTS REACT ANGRILY TO POLICE VIOLENCE </H5>
  Page 5 contains three reports on reactions to the police 
confrontation of the lawyers' demonstration. In the first 
1,800-word report, 'Abd-al-Hayy Muhammad and 'Adil al-Bahnasawi 
cite some party and trade union officials as condemning or 
regretting the incident. Liberal Party Leader Mustafa Kamil 
Murad is cited as saying that the police made a grave mistake in 
using force against the demonstration. Counselor Ma'mun 
al-Hudaybi, spokesman for the Muslim Brotherhood is cited as 
saying: "We regret and denounce what has happened. It is 
people's right to express their views as long as this is done in 
a peaceful and civilized manner. The use of force was 
meaningless. But what can we do knowing that the current regime 
is now characterized by violence, viciousness, and unjust 
oppression, and that state violence has become a firm policy?" 
  The second 1,500-word report by Tariq 'Abd-al-Hamid, and the 
third 1,500-word report by Khalid Yunus cite reactions by some 
lawyer leaders in Cairo and the governorates. They all denounce 
"government terrorism" and violation of law and human rights. 
<H5>  WILL SHAYKH AL-GHAZALI DELIVER 'ID AL-ADHA SERMON? </H5>
  A 50-word announcement-like report on page 1 says leaders 
and

    [Editorial report] The following review of the 24 May issue 
of Cairo 'AQIDATI summarizes articles that are Islamic in nature. 
<H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>
  1. Controversy Over Book Continues 
  2. Islam and the West 
  3. UN Position on Bosnia-Herzegovina Criticized 
  4. Litigation Among Ulema 
  5. Muslims and the United States 
  6. Islamic Media 
  7. Schindler's List 
  8. Satellite Dishes 
<H5>  CONTROVERSY OVER BOOK CONTINUES </H5>
  Beginning on page 1 and continuing on pages 10 and 11, the 
newspaper allots further space, an approximate total of 6,000 
words, to a controversy first reported by 'AQIDATI'S 17 May 
issue, namely the publication of Professor 'Abd-al-'Aziz 
al-'Arusi's book "Towards True Islam: Studies in the Koran Bring 
True Islam to Light." The book -- which addresses, among other 
matters, issues such as the unification and amendment of Muslim 
prayer times worldwide, amendment of ablution and hajj 
procedures, female modesty rules, and urges a modern 
interpretation of the religious edicts governing them -- draws 
attacks from 'AQIDATI, Mufti of the Republic Dr. Muhammad Sayyid 
Tantawi, and several al-Azhar University professors. Tantawi 
points out that modes of worship are not a matter of opinion but 
are strictly regulated by the Koran and the prophet's example. 
Muhammad 'Abd-al-Hadi al-'Ujayl, mufti of Yemen, faults the 
writer, who is a professor of architecture, for his lack of 
academic credentials in religious studies. 
  'AQIDATI publishes a letter from Dr. Samir Sarhan, chairman 
of the Egyptian General Book Authority, who defends the decision 
to allow the book's publication. It also publishes a report 
written by the recognized Muslim intellectual Dr. Muhammad 
'Imarah, who says that after asking the writer to alter and 
correct a few minor points, he recommended publication of the 
book which shows "a remarkable intellectual effort, independence 
of opinion, and the writer's personal labor in trying to 
interpret Koranic verses." He calls the book "a good research, 
made more valuable by the fact that it is the fruit of the 
contemplations of someone who is not a specialist in Islamic 
studies." 
  'AQIDATI then proceeds to dispute the arguments put forward 
by Sarhan and 'Imarah in the book's defense and reiterates that 
the book constitutes an attack on Islam. 
  A separate brief news item on page 10 reports that Shaykh 
Muhammad Futuh al-Sani', a mosque imam and prayer leader from 
al-Mansurah, has asked al-Mansurah's Prosecutor's Office to 
investigate the Egyptian General Book Authority for publishing 
the book that contains "bizarre ideas, foreign to Muslim 
concepts, that contradict the unanimous opinions of Muslim ulema 
such as the amendment and alteration of prayer times, fasting, 
and pilgrimage." He also demands that further printing of the 
book be halted. 
  Another brief report on the same page says that a committee 
of ulema from the al-Azhar-affiliated Council of Islamic 
Research examined the book and recommended its withdrawal from 
circulation. A brief report on page 2 reads: "Following 
'AQIDATI'S campaign against some books published by the Egyptian 
General Book Authority, the Authority's officials are now 
inclined to prevent the publication of any book that has not 
been approved by al-Azhar." 
<H5>  ISLAM AND THE WEST </H5>
  In a 1,000-word article entitled "Islamic Consensus and 
Western Incursion" in the "Islamic Perspectives" column on page 
7, Dr. Muhammad 'Imarah, a well-known Islamic intellectual, 
discusses the tendency of orientalists to give undue prominence 
to Muslim "radical groups" and "bizarre intellectuals streams" 
in the Muslim world while ignoring moderate streams. He 
comments on a study by researcher (Martin Kramer) of Tel Aviv 
University who discusses the failure of Islamic conferences to 
confront Western incursions into the Muslim world. He also 
refers to other "Zionist studies" that focus on the success of 
"a Jewish minority in achieving their settlement project despite 
the [opposition of] the Arabs and Muslims who represent a 
quarter of humanity." 
  'Imarah says that the "Zionist scheme did not confront our 
nation with the power of the Jewish minority alone but is--by 
its nature and birth--a scheme of the imperialist West. Its 
forces are the forces of the ascendant Western civilization in 
which the Jews are merely the minor partner." 
  Recalling the efforts of major Islamic leaders and thinkers 
who sought to confront Western advances into the Arab-Muslim 
world, he says at least one of them, Jamal-al-Din al-Afaghani 
(1838-1897), understood that the nation could not be revived in 
time to withstand the "Western colonialist onslaught." 'Imarah 
continues that al- Afaghani realized that the circumstances of 
"backward Ottoman rule, reactionarism, misadministration, 
stagnation, injustice, and corruption," combined with the power 
of the industrialized West to preclude successful confrontation. 
For this reason al-Afaghani sought merely to reduce the losses 
and shorten the period of the nation's decline. 
  'Imarah concludes his article by saying these matters must 
be 
taken into account in the struggle against the West. He 
stresses that the West, two centuries after overrunning the 
Muslim world, is worried about Islam's increasing strength. 

<H5>    UN POSITION ON BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA CRITICIZED </H5>
  The paper's "In All Frankness" column on page 6 is devoted 
to 
criticism of the United Nations for its lack of action on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, faulting the UN for leaving its affairs 
under the "domination of the big five." The writer, Basyuni 
al-Halawani, voices astonishment at UN Secretary General 
Butrus-Ghali's recent remarks to a French radio that the United 
Nations is neutral and that it has achieved success in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. He says the Bosnian Muslims were denied 
weapons at a time when arms were being smuggled to the Serbs and 
Croats. He says: "Had this organization adopted a just stance 
toward the afflicted Muslims in Bosnia, events would have taken 
a different course and the Muslims would have been able to 
defend their children, wives, and brothers and would have forced 
the Serbs to accept a peaceful solution." 
<H5>  LITIGATION AMONG ULEMA </H5>
  In a 2,500-word report on page 3, 'AQIDATI solicits the 
views 
of several academics and officials on the phenomenon of ulema 
seeking legal redress against other ulema who, differing with 
them on religious matters, use invective and slanderous remarks. 
The background to this affair is a lawsuit brought by the 
mufti, Dr. Muhammad Sayyid Tantawi, against several al-Azhar 
academics who have been attacking his fatwas on banking 
transactions and bank interest in newspaper articles. 
  There is no consensus among the respondents on whether it is 
desirable for Muslim ulema to air their disputes on the pages of 
the newspaper. Some support it but others say that public 
airing of such differences diminishes the public's confidence in 
the ulema. As to litigation, Dr. Ra'uf Shalabi, a former 
deputy rector of al-Ahzar, would like such controversies to be 
settled quietly but finds nothing wrong with someone going to 
court if he has been slandered or verbally abused. Al-Azhar 
professor Muhammad Mazru'ah believes that disputes among ulema 
should not reach the point of hurling insults or accusations of 
disbelief. He notes, however, that when one describes the 
other, in the course of a religious debate, as "an ignoramus, a 
misguided person, or falsifier," this does not constitute 
invective or slander. He says taking such matters to court is 
harmful to both sides. 
  Counselor Ahmad Mahmud Haykal, a former Court of Appeals 
judge, says that if a religious dispute leads to personal 
insult, then the injured party has the right to seek legal 
redress. 
<H5>  MUSLIMS AND THE UNITED STATES </H5>
  An 800-word article on page 20, by Muhmmad Muhammadayn, 
discusses a recent REUTER news analysis which says the United 
States strongly defends Islam and views Muslims as allies. It 
cites U.S. National Security Adviser Anthony Lake as saying that 
Islam is not the issue, but the extremists who exploit religion 
to attain political power are the issue. The writer finds 
REUTER's analysis strange and asks if the United States really 
defends Islam worldwide. He says: "Do the events in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina prove the sincerity of the U.S. National 
Security Adviser and demonstrate that Muslims are really 
Washington's allies?" 
<H5>  ISLAMIC MEDIA </H5>
  In the second installment of an ongoing series of articles 
on 
media affairs, published on page 18 and discussing ways to 
"develop the Islamic media," 'Abd-al-Rahman Sunbul, director of 
Egyptian television's religious programs calls for increasing 
the "religious dose" on television throughout the Arab world. 
Senior religious programs presenter Muhammad 'Abd-al-'Aziz 
calls on the Islamic Conference Organization to establish "an 
Islamic Information Institution" that will prepare radio and 
television programs dealing with the call to the faith. He says 
the INTERNATIONAL ISLAMIC NEWS AGENCY [IINA] must be 
strengthened and assisted in disseminating the Islamic world's 
news without being influenced by "the distortions of other news 
agencies which inject poison into their reports." 
<H5>  SCHINDLER'S LIST </H5>
  A 300-word report on the same page cites a comment by Radwan 
al-Kashif, a young Egyptian movie director, on Steven 
Spielberg's Schindler's List. He says he supports the screening 
of this film in Arab and Muslim countries but calls for the 
production of films "revealing Israel's crimes and practices." 
He says assistance from Arab governments to produce major 
motion pictures on this topic is necessary. 
<H5>  SATELLITE DISHES </H5>
  A 200-word report on page 2 reports that a lawsuit brought 
by 
a young Egyptian lawyer demanding the "banning of the 
importation and circulation of satellite dishes" will be 
discussed by Cairo's Administrative Court on 7 June 1994. 
  The report continues: "The Lawyers Association's Islamic 
Shari'ah Committee has already declared its solidarity and 
backing for the request to ban the use of satellite dishes. It 
believes that our opening up to the outside world must be based 
on selecting [broadcasts] that harmonize with this nation's 
character and rejecting all that threatens to obliterate this 
character."

<F P=106> [Interview with Arab League Secretary General Ismat </F>
'Abd-al-Majid by unidentified correspondent; place and date not 
given: "We Are Supposed To Mediate"] 
  [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Why has the Arab League failed in 
the conflict in Yemen? 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] We have not failed; we made enormous efforts 
to defuse the conflict. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] But this has not prevented the fratricidal 
war. 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] The Arab League does not have the right to 
intervene in the internal conflicts of a member state. The 
Republic of Yemen officially still exists as a unified state. 
Nevertheless, the Arab League remains an important political 
instrument, and that includes in the conflict in Yemen as well. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] What can you do? 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] Both parties to the war in Yemen now want to 
negotiate. The Arab League has been called upon to mediate 
between Sana and Aden. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Are you thinking of sending peacekeeping 
forces under the green banner of the Arab League? 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] If both sides consider this appropriate, why 
not? 
  [DER SPIEGEL] In other conflicts in the region, the League 
has also been ineffective -- for instance, in Somalia. 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] No state whatsoever existed there, which 
made the costly intervention of UN troops difficult. 
International organizations cannot replace a state. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The Arab League also stayed out of the 
rapprochement between the Israelis and the Palestinians. 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] Not at all. By unanimously recognizing the 
respective UN resolutions, we have clearly accelerated the peace 
process. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Are all Arab League members really ready to 
recognize Israel's right to exist? 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] All, without any exception -- under the 
precondition that all parties strive for a just peace on the 
basis of "land for peace."

  [Text] Algeria has expressed its support for a Polisario 
[Popular Front for the Liberation of Saquia al Hamra and Rio de 
Oro] call for an international conference to get the UN peace 
plan out of the current crisis. In a statement two days ago, 
Foreign Affairs Minister Mohamed Saleh Dembri said that Algeria 
would welcome any initiative to extend the sphere of 
consultations in a way that would serve regional interests. 
  For his part, Saharan President Mohamed Abdelaziz today 
called on the United Nations once more to put pressure on 
Morocco to adhere to UN resolutions. Fatima Zahra Ourous 
reports: 
  [Ourous] Saharan President Mohamed Abdelaziz urged the 
United 
Nations to intervene immediately and put political pressure on 
Morocco in order to save the UN peace plan for Western Sahara. 
In a statement published in the Algerian daily EL-CHAAB today, 
the Saharan president said that if the United Nations fails to 
implement its plan for the Western Sahara, it will lose its 
credibility and war would break out in the region again. No one 
would be able to determine the duration and number of victims of 
this war, he said. The Saharan official blamed the Moroccan 
authorities for their persistent efforts to abort the peace plan 
by creating obstacles and for their lack of a sincere desire to 
ensure the success of the UN proposal. In this context, the 
Saharan president cited the foiling by the Moroccan Government 
of the meetings held for dialogue and negotiations since last 
July, its persistent breach of the cease- fire conditions, and 
its attempts to flood the Western Sahara with settlers. 
  At the end of his statement to EL-CHAAB today, Mohamed 
Abdelaziz praised Algeria's special role in supporting the 
Saharan people's struggle.

  [Text] Tripoli, May 31 (AFP) -- Libya rejects the secession 
by southern Yemen and will oppose any plans to send UN troops to 
keep the warring sides apart, a parliamentary leader said here 
Tuesday [31 May]. 
  "There exists only one state in Yemen, the republic of Yemen 
(which merged north and south in 1990) and nobody has the right 
to interfere in its internal affairs," parliament's foreign 
affairs secretary, Sa'd Mujbir, told AFP. 
  "Libya supports Yemen's unity and is opposed to any 
secession," he said. 
  Southern leader 'Ali Salim al-Bid proclaimed an independent 
state with Aden as its capital on May 21, two weeks after civil 
war broke out. His northern rival, President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih, has vowed to crush the "rebellion." 
  Libyan officials had earlier stopped short of denouncing the 
secession, issuing statements of support for Yemen's unity. 
  Mujbir also warned against any "plan to send troops" from 
the 
United Nations to keep the warring sides apart, adding that will 
"repeat the catastrophes which took place in ex-Yugoslavia and 
Somalia." 
  The Security Council is due to debate the Yemeni conflict on 
Tuesday.

  [Text] Surt, 29 May (JANA) -- The General People's 
Committee [GPC] for Unity ended its first meeting for 1994, 
which convened between [words indistinct]. 
  During this meeting, the committee discussed the agenda, 
which includes a number of points, among them the executive 
program of the resolutions adopted by the Basic People's 
Congresses; the results of visits by the brother leader of the 
revolution to sisterly and friendly states. The committee also 
reviewed the outcome of the visits of presidents of sisterly and 
friendly states to the Great Jamahiriyah. It also reviewed the 
report of the GPC for Unity, the issue of unity, and the 
prerogatives of a member of the GPC for Unity inside the Basic 
People's Congress [BPC]. 
  At the conclusion of its meetings, the GPC issued a number 
of 
executive resolutions governing the work of the GPC. It also 
laid down the executive program for resolutions adopted by the 
BPC's which pertain to the GPC. 
  Regarding Arab unity, and during its discussion of this 
article, the committee stressed the following: 
  1. It stressed the ongoing role of the brother leader of the 
great al-Fatih revolution to achieve Arab unity. The committee 
highly praised his unionist initiative, as Arab unity represents 
a pressing necessity to help the Arab world break away from 
underdevelopment and dependency. 
  2. To continue the struggle toward the realization of 
comprehensive Arab unity through the project of Arab unity; to 
work for the removal of the artificial borders existing between 
Arab states. To this end, the committee decided the following: 
  a. To implement the agreements and charters concluded within 
the Arab Maghreb Union framework; to announce a full union 
between the Great Jamahiriyah, Sudan, and Egypt within the Arab 
League context; unity with almost all other Arab states; to set 
up the Arab common market. 
  b. To bless any unionist step between the states of the Arab 
world to bring closer the day of comprehensive Arab unity. 
  3. To entrust the committee's secretariat with overseeing 
the implementation and achievement of the BPC resolutions 
regarding Arab unity. 
  4. The committee calls for confronting the imperialist plots 
which seek to partition and tear apart the Arab world. 
  At the end of its meeting and during a discussion on general 
issues regarding people's work in the spheres of investment and 
residence affairs, the committee affirmed freedom of movement, 
residence, and work [words indistinct] in the Arab countries, 
adhering to the unionist (?agreements) concluded with some Arab 
countries, and encouraging Arab Libyan citizens to invest and 
work in Arab countries. 
  The committee decided to commit itself to all endorsed and 
concluded agreements and to speed up the program of residence, 
particularly in Egypt and Sudan, and draft plans aimed at 
encouraging Arab Libyan citizens to invest through [words 
indistinct]. The committee also recommended giving citizens 
with limited income facilities and priority in the sphere of 
investment, with the possibility of exempting them from paying 
the cost of their farms. 
  The committee stressed the need to speed up establishing a 
body at the Arab Libyan company for foreign investment to be in 
charge of following up investments. 
  Regarding the so-called Gaza-Jericho accord, the committee 
rejects this accord and the subsequent outcome, and (?expresses 
support) for the adherence of the Palestinian people to their 
rights in liberating their homeland and establishing their 
democratic state. 
  On the situation in Yemen, the committee affirms that 
proceeding from the great unionist al-Fatih revolution's firmed 
principles, the committee confirms its commitment to the Yemeni 
union [words indistinct] and calls on the Yemeni people to 
reject inter-fighting and follow the course of dialogue on the 
basis of the union state constitution. 
  At the end of the committee's meeting, the brother secretary 
of the GPC for Unity affirmed the need that "the Unity Committee 
live up to the level of trust placed on it by the masses of the 
BPC's.

    [Editorial report] Tripoli Voice of Greater Arab Homeland 
in Arabic at 1140 GMT on 29 May broadcasts a 
four-and-a-half-minute item on a recent AIDS report published by 
the World Health Organization, about the number of people 
infected worldwide and saying that 40 million people will 
contract the disease by the end of this century. The report 
recalls Libya's proposal to the United Nations to set up a world 
fund to combat AIDS. It says the United States has the highest 
number of AIDS cases, giving the number of cases and deaths 
there. 
  Hence, the extent of the danger of this disease on human 
life 
in general becomes clear. It is a disease that has resulted 
from secret bacterial tests conducted by the CIA on a number of 
prisoners. Soon after, the disease spread all over the world 
and human beings were dying without any hope of halting its 
spread or eliminating it. Many studies and reports have proved 
this crime, which the CIA committed against humanity when it 
interfered in the science of genetics and tested the results of 
its research on those prisoners. Some of the prisoners died and 
others left prison and carried the epidemic to the streets where 
it later found its way to the whole world. 
  In order to get rid of the consequences of this crime, the 
United States claimed that the disease had come from Zaire and 
other African countries, while in reality it has been an 
American disease from the start. 
  Some sources have revealed that the United States founded a 
laboratory in Maryland in 1977, where bacterial tests were 
carried out on prisoners. The first case of AIDS was recorded 
in 1979. Three years later, similar cases appeared in Europe and 
Africa. 
  Hence, on the threshold of the 21st century, humanity finds 
itself facing a fatal disease that has no known treatment 
because of U.S. manipulation in the science of genetics and 
toxic bacteria. 
  However, and despite all this, the project that the Great 
Jamahiriyah presented to the United Nations brings a glimpse of 
hope for humanity in order to intensify its efforts to confront 
this epidemic, relinquish armaments and destructive arms 
arsenals owned by the great powers, and pay attention to this 
danger that is threatening its sons and humanity as a whole.

<F P=106> [Statement by "first group of the Bani Walid youth"; place </F>
and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] The statement issued by the first group of 
revolutionary youth of Bani Walid: 
  To the leader of the nation and its liberator, 
  At these glorious moments in the life of our free Libyan 
people who resist tyranny, combat the new Western invasion, 
shoulder the responsibility for liberating our great nation, and 
struggle to smash the insulting agreements of humiliation, at 
these bitter and painful moments in the lives of our Arab 
nation, our steadfast people in Palestine, our unionist people 
in Yemen, and the rest of our Arab peoples who are downtrodden 
in the Gulf by American hegemony, who are at the mercy of the 
Israelis in Syria, whose national unity in Egypt and Algeria is 
threatened by Western intelligence conspiracies, and who are 
exposed in the dear Arab Maghreb to French arrogance, the first 
group of the Bani Walid revolutionary youth are honored to meet 
you and to draw from your inspired thinking. 
  We emphasize the following: 
  First: Our complete readiness to smash the traitors, those 
who spread rumors, reactionaries, and those who...[incomplete 
sentence as crowd start chanting]; 
  Second: There is no alternative to the people's authority 
and 
there is no legitimate political framework except the Basic 
People's Congresses; 
  Third: We are now obliged to smash the tribal, sectarian, 
and 
partisan spirit in order to preserve the unity of our people 
under confrontation circumstances, in order to carry out the 
sacred defense of our national entity, and in order to 
strengthen our national unity that is attacked by enemies within 
and without; [chanting] 
  Fourth: In reply to foiled attempts by the enemies to 
infiltrate our home front, today we announce our revolutionary 
resolution to liquidate the stray dog CIA agents. [chanting]. 
The death penalty will pursue all officers of the Western 
intelligence services who are trying to fragment the home front, 
violate the security of the Jamahiriyah or the person of our 
leader, or recruit any sick person to serve their sordid and 
despicable aims; [chanting] 
  Fifth: We would like to emphasize to the crusading enemies 
and local and Arab treacherous forces allying themselves with 
them that the results of besieging the Jamahiriyah will not be 
better than the results of besieging Yathrib, and that we will 
soon launch an attack to smash the strongholds of reaction and 
imperialism as the soldiers of the Prophet smashed the 
strongholds of atheism and falsehood in Mecca. 
  At the same time, we warn everyone who tries to play the 
role 
of Bani Quraydhah Jews who broke their promise, tried to stab 
the Muslims in the back, and formed a fifth column behind the 
moat [during the siege of Yathrib] that our revenge will not be 
less than the revenge of God's Messenger, may God's prayers and 
mercy be upon him, and we will not be more merciful than him. 
On the contrary, we will be more severe and cruel. [chanting]

  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 30, BNS -- It is absolutely possible 
that Estonia would buy anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons from 
Russia, the commander in chief of the Estonian defense forces 
said. 
  Maj. Gen. Aleksander Einseln in remarks to reporters about 
his last week's visit to Moscow and talks with Russian army 
leadership said that Estonia wants to buy high-quality weapons 
at a low price. "If it is possible for us to get them from 
Russia, we'll buy weapons from there," he said. 
  Einseln quoted the chief of Russia's General Staff, Col. 
Gen. 
Mikhail Kolesnikov as reconfirming that Russia will pull its 
troops from Estonia. "But we didn't talks about dates at the 
meeting," he said. 
  The Estonian commander in chief, who visited Moscow on Apr. 
20- 22, also proposed to the Russian Defense Ministry to set up 
a joint work group that would be able to quickly resolve all 
problems that may emerge in connection with the withdrawal from 
Estonia. Kolesnikov had said the proposal would be taken for 
consideration. 
  Also discussed at the meetings were prospects for military 
cooperation between Estonia and Russia after the Russian troops 
will have left Estonia. 
  "We don't think that our contacts with the Russian military 
will end after the troop withdrawal. We must also look into the 
future and make clear the possible directions of working 
closely," Einseln said. 
  The Estonian commander in chief has earlier said that the 
country could start sending its cadets to be trained for 
officers at Russian military colleges.

  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 29, BNS -- The commander in chief of 
the Estonian defense forces, Major General Aleksander Einseln 
returned from a visit to Brussels today. Einseln participated 
in a meeting of commanders of armed forces of the countries of 
the North Atlantic Cooperation Council [NACC]. 
  The meeting discussed ways to develop the NATO Partnership 
for Peace program, and also, the formation of a Baltic 
peacekeeping battalion, Einseln said at a press conference in 
Tallinn today. 
  The peacekeeping company to be set up in Estonia under the 
joint Baltic force scheme will be ready to participate in joint 
maneuvers of the international peacekeeping forces in the 
Netherlands, due in late October, the Estonian general said at a 
meeting of the NACC peacekeeping group in Brussels Thursday [28 
April]. 
  A unit of 20 will be sent to participate in the joint 
maneuvers from Estonia, the country's commander in chief said 
today. "If we want to join the NATO some time in the future, we 
must start taking part in such kind of events as early as 
possible," he said. 
  At a joint neeting of the armed force commanders of NACC and 
the NATO Committee for Military Issues on Wednesday, Einseln 
expressed hope that the Baltic peacekeeping battalion will be 
ready to fulfill its tasks from November 1995. 
  Einseln told reporters today that the formation of the 
Baltic 
battalion had gained great support. There exists a readiness to 
come in with assistance in training, and possibly, also for the 
part of equipment, he added. 
  According to information obtained by BNS, Einseln has 
submitted to the Defense Ministry a draft ruling on the creation 
of the detached peacekeeping company, or the Estonian part of 
the joint Baltic force. The ruling had to be adopted by the 
government. 
  The draft says the company would be set up as a separate 
legal entity under the Estonian Defense Ministry, with its own 
seal and symbols. The draft foresees that the ministry would 
draw up the lists of the new company's structure and 
composition, and submit to the government for approval a draft 
budget of the new unit. The ministry and the Central Staff must 
see to it that the unit be manned in due time. 
  The Foreign Ministry will formally apply to the UN 
Headquarters for authorization of the new peacekeeping unit and 
its submission to the UN peacekeeping force. 
  Estonia now has also its representative, Lieutenant Peeter 
Lans, at the NATO headquarters in Brussels to oversee the 
country's cooperation with NATO and activity under the 
Partnership for Peace plan.

  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 29, BNS -- The parties in Estonia's 
governing coalition started a session of talks in the Lohusalu 
seaside resort near Tallinn Thursday [28 April]. The two days 
of talks were to focus on the priorities in legislative activity 
and outlining the 1995 state budget. 
  Work goes on in a number of fields, such as farming and 
social security, governmental spokesman Ain Saarna said. Also 
discussed will be the implementation of the law on aliens and 
extending the deadline for submitting the residence and working 
permit applications for non-citizens. 
  "Neither political problems nor the government reform will 
be 
officially discussed. There is also no reason to think that 
these issues would be taken for discussion at the Lohusalu 
meeting," the spokesman said. 
  The meeting's atmosphere this time is much more serious and 
business-like than it was at a similar meeting last year, said 
MP Andrus Villem. "One can feel that people know what they want 
and what they are doing," he said. 
  "There are no major differences in opinions within the 
government coalition at present," Villem said, adding that all 
disputes concerned only details of minor importance. 
  All political parties in the Estonian government coalition 
take part in the two-day meeting. Also most of the Cabinet 
members are present. 
  Thursday's meeting was presided by Prime Minister Mart Laar.

  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 30, BNS -- The president of the Bank 
of Estonia, Siim Kallas, in his remarks on arrival from a visit 
to the United States and Canada said Estonia could boast being 
increasingly popular among politicians and business leaders on 
the American continent for its quick economic progress. 
  Estonia's achievements in the economic reform are widely 
known and there is permanent interest in learning about the 
factors that have brought about this relative success, he said. 
  Kallas during the past week and a half participated in the 
work of the interim committee of the International Monetary 
Fund. He also attended a conference on the topic of the 
independence of central banks in Eastern Europe. 
  The Bank of Estonia president had a number of meetings with 
business leaders and politicians in New York and Toronto, Canada. 
  Kallas in his comments to BNS today said that even Estonia's 
rapidly increased inflation rates for the past few months had 
not diminished the country's popularity. "Of course, I often had 
to answer to questions on that issue," the head of the central 
bank said. But it still seemed that the inflation rates have 
not affected the country's overall standing, he added. 
  Kallas said that experts at the IMF had no fear at all about 
Estonia's high inflation rates. IMF's main advice to Estonia is 
to be patient, and the inflation wave goes over, he said.

  [Text] Riga, Apr 29 LETA -- On Thursday [28 April] Latvian 
President Guntis Ulmanis met the Russian Ambassador Aleksandr 
Rannikh, and once more confirmed his intention to go to Moscow 
to meet Russian President Boris Yeltsin. The President's press 
service reports that Guntis Ulmanis stressed he is ready to sign 
the first out of the four initialed agreements and as to the 
rest everything depends on the result of work experts are 
carrying out in Jurmala. 
  Rannikh pointed out that some countries make it clear for 
Moscow that in case the treaties are not signed full 
responsibility for it will rest with Moscow. He said that 
Yeltsin has the four treaties on his desk and is expecting they 
will be signed in a package and added: "with supplementary 
protocols." Moscow accepts the possibility of signing one 
general agreement by the presidents and the other three rest by 
ministers in the presidents' presence. 
  If the agreement will be reached on the protocol to the 
fourth treaty which would be acceptable for Latvia the rest of 
the treaties could be signed on the ministers' level, the 
Latvian side believes.

  [Text] Riga, Apr 29, BNS -- Presidents Boris Yeltsin of 
Russia and Guntis Ulmanis of Latvia will sign an agreement 
Saturday [30 April] on the withdrawal of 12,000 Russian troops 
from the Baltic country by Aug. 31. 
  The Latvian president will be accompanied on the visit to 
Moscow by Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs and other officials. 
  The key to the accord was an agreement this week by 
negotiators in Jurmala, Latvia, on the issue of social 
guarantees for 20,000 retired Russian servicemen living in 
Latvia. 
  A special protocol on the military pensioners will be 
attached to the main withdrawal package, chief Russian 
negotiator Sergei Zotov said Friday. 
  According to Russian and Latvian officials, the protocol 
says 
both sides will help servicemen who want to leave Latvia, and 
will set up a special fund to assist them. 
  "This document removed the last objections which the Latvian 
side had regarding the whole package. Therefore, the road was 
cleared for the visit of Latvia's president to Moscow," Zotov 
told the Interfax news agency. 
  Officials in Moscow and Riga confirmed that Ulmanis will 
sign 
the entire package -- the main agreement, three related accords 
and the Jurmala protocol -- in the Russian capital. 
  The accords would include one on social guarantees for the 
Russian military for the period until the final withdrawal of 
the troops, a rent agreement for the Skrunda radar station that 
Russia is going to keep under its control during the next 4+1.5 
years, and an accord on social guarantees for the retired 
servicemen. 
  Latvian chief negotiator Aivars Vovers declined to elaborate 
on the concessions his country had made to reach a consensus 
with Russia. He said it would be difficult to properly 
understand the nuances without reading the whole text of the 
agreements. 
  Ulmanis' political adviser John Eichmanis said the amount of 
rent that Russia will pay for the Skrunda base was the last 
issue that remained outstanding. 
  "We expect it to be settled in Moscow," he told The 
Associated Press. But Eichmanis expressed doubt whether the 
withdrawal package would be raftified by Russia's State Duma, 
the lower house of parliament, which has a large percentage of 
Communists and nationalists, or the equally nationalist Latvian 
parliament. 
  Latvian chief negotiator Aivars Vovers said the issue of the 
amount of rent to be paid by Russia for the Skrunda station was 
to be settled before the meeting of the presidents in Moscow. 
  The leader of the Russian delegation, Sergei Zotov called 
the 
latest negotiations a waste of time that Latvia had forced upon 
Russia. He accused Latvia for lacking flexibility since the 
very beginning of the talks, despite what, he added, an 
agreement was reached. 
  The Russian Ambassador to Latvia, Alexander Rannihk, in a 
conversation with the Latvian president said that a number of 
foreign countries had indicated Moscow would be held responsible 
if the talks with Latvia ended without an agreement. Moscow 
officials also say it is possible that the presidents on 
Saturday will sign only the main agreements and that the rest of 
the documents would be signed by the prime ministers in the 
presence of the heads of state. Yeltsin has said he is ready to 
sign all four documents in the package. 
  About 130,000 former Soviet soldiers have pulled out of 
Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia since the Baltics' regaining of 
their independence in 1991. None are left in Lithuania, but 
about 12,000 remain in Latvia and 2,300 in Estonia. After 
Latvia has signed the accords on Saturday, Estonia will be the 
only Baltic country not to have reached an agreement with Russia 
on troop withdrawal.

<F P=106> [Speech by President Guntis Ulmanis in Riga on eve of </F>
departure for talks in Moscow -- live] 
  [Text] Esteemed viewers, I hope that many of you will have 
successfully ended another working week, while at the weekend 
there is spring cleaning to be done. For the government, 
parliament, and the president, however, one of the most crucial 
visits to Moscow, and one of the most difficult working days, 
will take place tomorrow. 
  This was not an easy decision, and at the basis of it were 
those processes which have troubled the minds of many of you. I 
think that this is a visit which in many ways is a first in 
history. It is the first visit by the state president to 
democratic Russia. It is the first summit meeting between 
Latvia and Russia in unprecedented circumstances and conditions. 
Democratic Russia want to achieve its goals by talking to a 
free and sovereign Latvia. This path is taken not only by 
Russia and Latvia; it has been created with the participation of 
many European countries as well, especially in the past two 
weeks. And perhaps it is the views of the European countries, 
the views of the European Union, the letters and messages from 
leaders of many countries, and the promises, as well as the 
practical work of giving material support to these processes, 
that have inclined us to the decision to go to Moscow and 
commence political dialogue. 
  What are the basic aims and tasks in setting off on this 
short but crucial road? In the first place our task is to bring 
about, without reservations and by the appointed date of 31 
August, the departure from Latvia of the last soldier of the 
Russian army. There is proof that this process is by no means 
easy in the facts of the past few days, that the withdrawal of 
the Russian army is proceeding with great difficulty and 
complexity, and quite often the tasks that are are already set 
today are not being fulfilled. I think that in accepting such 
an agreement, our government, our Ministry of Defense, will have 
to make great efforts for these soldiers to be really withdrawn. 
We must ensure that Skrunda acquires the status of a military 
institution under civilian control, so it would not be possible 
at all, even in theory, and as a the result of a mistake, as 
happened recently, to acquire the status of a military base. We 
must ensure that soon after the signing of this agreement the 
new monster of Skrunda is demolished, so that it can never 
return, and there can never even be any more talk of the 
reinstating of this military base. 
  I think that in the past week two very essential 
improvements or supplements have been achieved: they are, on the 
creation of the repatriation fund, on the functioning and 
significance of this repatriation fund. I am convinced that 
through this repatriation fund many former soldiers and military 
personnel will have a chance to leave Latvia in a civilized way. 
  And another achievement, if it can be called anything in 
this difficult struggle, is that we have received from Russia 
the number of those retired military personnel -- 22,320 -- who 
will be subject to the application of these agreements and laws. 
So, if we talk of the fourth agreement, and whether it will be 
signed at all, it could be a matter of the futures of 22,320 
people, and Latvia will one way or another bear its civilized 
responsibilities only for the fate of those people in the social 
(?sphere). 
  I think that this kind of checking will allow us to remove 
the range of responsibilities rumored recently - that there are 
100,000 150,000, or 200,000 in Latvia -- no, this agreement 
covers only that number that will be checked and monitored every 
year. I think that the last two questions we are to talk about, 
namely the commencement of political dialogue and the future 
settlement of economic relations, are less important. 
  We are taking with us more than 10 agreements, about which 
there will definitely be talks, and I think they will allow many 
economic industrialists, farmers, producers, to breathe freely, 
because the way to the eastern market, in my opinion, is today 
after all somewhat easier than the way to the western market. 
  And I cannot speak about the last question that we are 
definitely to discuss at our meeting with Yeltsin - that is the 
question of our moral, of our spiritual responsibility in the 
face of those forces from which we have still not freed 
ourselves today. They are the consequences of the occupation, 
they are the consequences that our people is still living 
through since the deportations of 1940 and 1949. I am convinced 
that the Russian leadership will acknowledge the criminality of 
these consequences, acknowledge the destructive effect of these 
consequences, not only on the Latvian people, but also on many 
other peoples. 
  And in conclusion I want to confess that this journey is 
undoubtedly very complex and very hard, and I can say with 
certainty that I am travelling with a (?heavy) heart and doubts 
-- but not doubts about the road that Latvia is taking. Here 
neither the president nor the government has any doubts. But we 
have doubts about whether the new democratic Russia will be able 
to receive and accept us - not as the near abroad, not as a 
possible sphere of influence, but as a sovereign independent 
state. 
  I know, and I am acquainted with, the great hospitality of 
the Russian people. I hope that the Russian government, too, 
will be able to comprehend these efforts being made by the 
Latvian people. I would like our delegation to have as its 
travelling provisions not only those harsh words and critical 
remarks you have made; it has also done much good in assessing 
our work for us; but also to have wishes for us for a bit of 
endurance, a bit of strength, patience and persistence in this 
lengthy, but for Latvia very important, process.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Kuchina] </F>
  [Text] Riga May 1 TASS -- "Russian President Boris Yeltsin 
might visit Latvia, the time of the visit will be agreed upon," 
said Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis, addressing a news 
conference devoted to the results of his visit to Moscow. 
Gulmanis highly assessed the results of his visit, saying that 
the Present Russian leadership conducts a favorable policy 
towards Latvia. 
  On Saturday, Russian president Boris Yeltsin said in the 
Kremlin after signing Russo-Latvian documents that a package of 
bilateral agreements is expected to be signed during Viktor 
Chernomyrdin's visit to Latvia. 
  During the talks between Russian and Latvian officials held 
at the top level, the sides signed an agreement on the order of 
withdrawal of Russian troops from the Latvian territory, an 
agreement on legal status of the Russian radar station in 
Scrunda, an agreement on social welfare for Russian servicemen 
and their families and retired servicemen on the Latvian 
territory. 
  Participants in the news conference held today and attended 
by Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs pointed out that the 
talks in the Kremlin were held an a cordial and frank 
atmosphere. "When the dialogue began, we dropped all 
apprehensions about possible pressure from Russia. The dialogue 
was held in a free, easy and democratic form," Ulmanis said. 
  Dwelling on the main subject of the Moscow talks, Ulmanis 
pointed out that "after Grachev said that Russia intends to 
withdraw its troops much earlier than August 31, I became sure 
that the Russian army would go soon." " We shall be able to step 
up the process rather than merely monitor it as it was before" 
Ulmanis said. "If we manage to lay a foundation to mutual 
confidence on the basis of the signed documents, the relations 
between the two countries will soon enter a new historic stage," 
the Latvian president said. 
  A similar opinion was expressed by Valdis Birkavs, who 
emphasised that Latvia needs " long-term, advantageous economic 
ties with Russia." Therefore, Birkavs said that an agreement on 
granting Latvia a most-favoured nation status in trade with 
Russia is one of the most important achievements of the visit. 
  Before the visit to Moscow began, Ulmanis, in an interview 
with ITAR-TASS, welcomed the development of mutually 
advantageous ties with Russia. He pointed out that not only "a 
window to Europe", but "doors" must be left open through Baltic 
ports. The sincerity of the Latvian president arises no doubt, 
since thanks to his energetic efforts a Russo-Latvian conflict 
over the arrest of two Russian generals was prevented. 
According to the Latvian president, this incident "made the 
Latvian leadership look at itself from a critical point of view." 
  During the Moscow meeting the Russian and Latvian presidents 
showed tact and respect for each other. The Russian side took 
into account the Latvian president's request to return to Latvia 
the remains of the former Latvian President Karlis Ulmanis who 
was interned by the Stalinist regime in the 1940s and buried in 
former Soviet Turkmenistan. The now Latvian president is a 
grand nephew of Karlis Ulmanis and he believes that his destiny 
is to establish peace and accord in society. 
  Ulmanis is the fifth consecutive Latvian president and the 
first president after Latvia regained its independence. He is 
married and has two children. He enjoys great popularity as a 
politician and invariably ranks first in popularity in public 
opinion polls.

<F P=106> [News conference by President Guntis Ulmanis and Prime </F>
Minister Valdis Birkavs in Riga following visit to Moscow -- 
live] 
  [Excerpts] [Ulmanis] Hello, esteemed viewers and listeners. 
We have not yet completely recovered from the strenuous day 
yesterday. And today, before I came to this meeting, I thought 
over what was really done, what the results of that day's work 
are,and what conclusion can be made from all that has happened. 
  I would like to say that in very many aspects this visit was 
really a historic one and it was the first in the history of a 
free Latvia and a new democratic Russia. We were going to 
Moscow with certain doubts and it would be needless to say how 
carefully we were preparing. Perhaps, not everyone knows that 
the last three nights both Mr. Birkavs and myself spent in 
continuous consultations with various political forces and 
members of our government in order to work out this final 
version before going to Moscow. [passage omitted] 
  As soon as the talks began, the anxiety concerning certain 
imperialistic thinking and possible pressure from the Russian 
side in fact to a certain extent disappeared from our minds. 
And the dialogue proceeded in a free, unforced and I would even 
like to say democratic form. [passage omitted] 
  President Yeltsin, as far as he was able and willing, firmly 
and openly stated to me that now Russia does not have 
aspirations to have Latvia in its sphere of interests, that 
Russia does not think of any kind of regaining the governorship, 
and that Russia thinks that Latvia has to become a stable, free, 
and sovereign European state. During the whole course of the 
talks I did not feel that there was any tendency which would 
make me considerably doubt or reconsider what had been said. 
  In discussions with President Yeltsin, at the beginning we 
touched on the issues of the fate of the two peoples, the fate 
of the Russian people and the Latvian people, about the huge 
deportations which affected the Latvian people, about the 
deportations of 1940 and 1949. And remembering this, President 
Yeltsin categorically condemned personally and on his 
government's behalf those mass deportations and said that he 
would also publicly state this everywhere where it could be 
heard and where one would be able to find out his views. It 
should be said that he kept this promise and with certain 
satisfaction I was listening to him when he was addressing the 
press and reporters. [passage omitted] 
  We agreed that the agreements signed were a theoretical 
part, 
a part on paper, of the agreement, and practical steps have to 
follow now. These steps should be such that they do not offend 
either Latvia's honor or the honor of Latvian citizens, or the 
wrong done to the deported, or the principles of Latvia's 
sovereignty and independence. We agreed that the number of the 
military, the amount of pensions paid to them and their future 
fate will be strictly controlled. 
  An agreement was reached with the Russian side -- the 
minister of defense and the minister of foreign affairs also 
took part in it, their names, Grachev and Kozyrev, are widely 
known to you -- about the creation of a repatriation fund and 
both Russia and Latvia, as well as other European states, will 
participate in the fund. 
  Speaking about the withdrawal of troops from Latvia, I 
expressed doubts on whether Russia is ready to withdraw its 
troops by 31 August and I wondered whether their promises will 
not be fulfilled. A statement by the minister of defense said in 
response that they will do everything possible to have the 
troops withdrawn much earlier than 31 August. Although 31 
August was left in the agreement, a verbal agreement was reached 
between us that the troops will be withdrawn before 31 August. 
Various figures and various dates were mentioned. I think that 
we can safely say now that this to a certain extent depends on 
both our Ministry of Defense and other ministries, whether they 
are able to get actively involved in this process. The 
agreement provides the foundation on which they can get to work. 
I got the impression that the troops will very soon leave 
Latvian territory. 
  We have received full guarantees from the Russian side and 
once again a verbal assurance from Mr. Yeltsin that the issue of 
the status of a military base was an unfortunate erroneous 
process and that it is a lesson not only for Latvia to be more 
careful, but also a lesson for Russia itself to follow more 
carefully the drafting of its documents and the work of its 
executive and its corresponding departments. Once again an 
agreement was reached that that facility should be a military 
facility under civilian control [as heard]. There was no 
difference of opinion as to who and how controls it and that 
that site should never become a military base on Latvian 
territory. And it was also added that the Russian side does not 
have at the moment any grounds, any plans or any activity aimed 
at creating military bases in Latvia. [passage omitted] 
  [Birkavs] Hello, esteemed viewers and listeners. Whether 
yesterday will be a historic day and whether it will stay in the 
people's consciousness as a significant positive step now 
depends on us. Practically today we can go to the new Skrunda 
facility and begin to dismantle it. But let us not perhaps 
hurry in this way, that involves considerable work. And for 
this purpose, the state coffers will immediately receive $3 
million. These are practical matters, however, which we can 
easily tackle in the short term. 
  We need long-term favorable economic relations with Russia. 
I therefore consider the signing of a protocol, which states 
that most favored nation status in trade comes into effect for 
Latvia and Russia on 1 June 1994, as one of the greatest results 
of yesterday's talks. In order to fully settle this issue and 
to sign corresponding documents, Russian Premier Chernomyrdin 
will come to Latvia in the second half of May and the 
corresponding documents will be signed. 
  I would like to say to the residents of Skrunda and all the 
residents of the surrounding villages and rural districts who 
are affected by the Skrunda radar that my request from Russia on 
the issue of how much should the rent payment for Skrunda be is 
very simple: Pay the sum that is worthy of Russia. The sum on 
which we agreed may be assessed differently. It is two and a 
half times bigger than was initially promised by the Russian 
side, but it is considerably smaller than what I would like it 
to be -- it is $5 million a year. I promise that this money 
will be granted to the residents who will still be suffering 
from the radar for four years. [passage omitted] 
  We are facing a new historic period and we should not look 
back so much, we should look forward. I invite all the critics 
of the agreement to carefully follow whether the clauses of the 
agreement are complied with. We will try to do everything 
possible to improve relations with Russia in the course of 
compliance with the agreement, but so that Latvian people do not 
suffer either. Thank you. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Riga, Apr 29, BNS -- Latvian Cabinet, meeting 
urgently on the eve of Moscow summit, accepted the protocol at 
the initial agreement on social rights of Russian military 
retirees in Latvia. 
  In addition, the government set up the country's delegation 
for the April 30 Moscow summit and considered the amount for 
rent for the radar facility at Skrunda. 
  The ministers decided that Russia should pay for Skrunda 130 
million U.S. dollars per year but it could also remunerate the 
worth of the sum in natural gas, Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs 
told reporters after the government session. 
  Latvian officials are now negotiating the proposal with 
Russian counterparts in Moscow. 
  In another action, the Cabinet decided to announce a 
competition for the dismantling of the new building of the 
Skrunda radar compound. For the purpose, foreign countries have 
already extended 3 million U.S. dollars. 
  Birkavs prognosticated the interest in the dismantling would 
be large. The task, however, may pose technical problems 
because the building was constructed safe against nuclear 
attacks. 
  The government also ruled to form a working part to create a 
repatriation fund for Russian war pensioners. 
  Birkavs said that the U.S. Government allotted for the fund 
2.5 million dollars in housing vouchers. Consequently, the 
officers won't be able to use the money for other purposes, 
Birkavs noted. 
  Commenting on the agreement signature, Birkavs said Latvia 
would propose that it is signed by two representatives of each 
country. 
  Birkavs described Russia's commitment to submit Latvia a 
list 
of military retirees as the principal achievement of the 
additional protocol.

  [Text] Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas received 
Russian Ambassador Nikolay Obertyshev who handed him a message 
from Russian President Boris Yeltsin. 
  Following the meeting, Brazauskas told journalists that he 
had received a response from Yeltsin to his letter of early 
April saying that some of the Lithuanian-Russian agreements 
signed by the two men in November 1993 had not been observed. 
  Brazauskas said that Yeltsin's letter called for activating 
bilateral talks. He thought that both countries wanted that. 
  He added that even before the letter was received the 
Lithuanian leaders had discussed steps to be taken in the near 
future. In particular, it was desirable that a Russian team 
come to Lithuania to discuss Russian transit across that 
country, visa matters and other urgent matters that had not been 
covered by agreements between the two governments. 
  Brazauskas said that Virgilijus Bulovas, head of the 
Lithuanian working group handling talks with CIS member states, 
would complete shortly the study of a Russian draft agreement on 
transit. 
  Dainius Trinkunas, Lithuanian president's foreign policy 
adviser, told Interfax that Yeltsin expressed his gratitude for 
an invitation to visit Lithuania. The date of his visit will be 
agreed on later.

  [Text] Vilnius Apr 29, BNS -- The president of Lithuania, 
Algirdas Brazauskas, on Friday [29 April] received the Russian 
ambassador to Lithuania, Nikolai Obiortyshev, who presented a 
letter from Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Yeltsin's letter 
came as answer to a letter sent by Brazauskas earlier this month. 
  Brazauskas told reporters after the meeting that the Russian 
president links the implementation of economic treaties with the 
problem of Russian transit to the Kaliningrad region through 
Lithuania. 
  Russian transit through Lithuanian territory remains the 
main 
stumbling block hindering economic and trade relations between 
the two countries. The Lithuanian leadership raised the issue 
on numerous occasions on the international level. Lithuania and 
other European nations need to know whether such positions 
reflect the working style of Moscow functionaries or Russia's 
political line, Brazauskas said in his speech at the Council of 
Europe Parliamentary Assembly April 14. 
  After his meeting with Obiortyshev, the Lithuanian president 
emphasized that Lithuania cannot assent to such a policy. He 
said the Lithuanian-Russian economic treaties signed last 
November were a result of only one stage of talks, but transit 
to Kaliningrad and visa requirements are matters of further 
negotiation. 
  But Brazauskas called "acceptable" Yeltsin's proposal to 
continue talks because "the interests and tendencies" of both 
countries coincide. 
  Brazauskas said the Russian ambassador told him that the 
official Moscow values his initiative to exchange letters 
between presidents. Obiortyshev said the process would be "a 
good impulse" to bilateral talks. 
  The Russian diplomat said relations between Lithuania and 
Russia are not bad, but neither of the sides is satisfied with 
their "tempo." Obiortyshev noted, however, that Russia's 
relations with Lithuania have progressed much further than 
relations with Estonia and Latvia, as well as other former 
Soviet republics.

  [Text] Director of the technical center of Lithuanian radio 
and television, Yuosas Niverauskas, has reported that from May 2 
there will be a considerable reduction in the broadcasting of 
the Russian Ostankino television channel in Lithuania. 
  He said that this was a result of the fact that Ostankino 
owed a million litai (approx. 250,000 dollars). Programs will 
only be broadcast from 18:00 local time (19:00 Moscow time). 
  As the debt question remains unresolved it is unclear how 
much longer even evening broadcasting will continue. 
  The remaining time -- from 1:00 to 18:00 -- may well be 
leased to the Litpolinter private studio. 
  As of next week, Niverauskas said, broadcast of the Mayak 
radio station will be suspended, also because of debt. It is 
suggested that relay stations now broadcasting Mayak lease their 
time to private radio companies.

  [Text] Vilnius, Apr 29, BNS -- The Lithuanian Supreme 
Court on Friday [29 April] sentenced eight former Soviet 
activists to varying jail terms for participation in a failed 
coup attempt in January 1991. 
  The trial started last December. The eight were first 
charged with anti-state activities but the accusations were 
changed to milder ones as the trial proceeded. 
  The court sentenced Valeri Ivanov, former leader of the pro- 
Soviet Yedinstvo (Unity) movement, to 3 1/2 years in jail. The 
court said Ivanov helped Soviet troops to guard the Lithuanian 
radio and TV building that was seized Jan. 13, 1991. On that 
day, 13 civilians were killed and hundreds more injured 
defending the TV tower and state institutions from Soviet tanks. 
  The court failed to come up with evidence proving that the 
defendants organized assaults on radio and TV buildings. 
  Ivanov will have to spend only 5 months in jail because the 
time since his arrest was included in the punishment and the 
amnesty law was applied. Some of his accomplices, who were 
sentenced to 3 1/2 years in jail, will be imprisoned for less 
than a month. 
  Two out of eight former activists were fined 1,500 lits and 
one was sentenced to 5 1/2 years in jail. 
  Aleksandr Smotkin, who set off two grenades near a 
Lithuanian 
border post in November 1991, was sentenced to an eight-year 
jail term. The state prosecutor said the explosions endangered 
the lives of four Lithuanian officials, who escaped death only 
by mere chance. The amnesty law was not applied in Smotkin's 
case, but the time since his arrest was included in the 
punishment.

  [Text] Director general of the Mazeikiai oil terminal 
Bronislavas Vainora and Fluor Daniel Williams Brothers company's 
Vice President Charles Tumey signed a contract April 27 in 
Vilnius on the basic designing of a new oil terminal in Butinge, 
at the Baltic Sea. 
  The U.S.-based company was announced March 31 the winner of 
an international competition for the terminal project. The 
also-runs were Italy's Snaprogetti and Argentina's Techint. 
  Fluor Daniel will design the terminal for import and export 
of oil products, monitor the construction and help Lithuanians 
find financing for the project's implementation. The firm's 
vice president said on the Lithuanian television that the 
financing should be found by the customers themselves, i.e., the 
Mazeikiai enterprise, but his company will help to select the 
best of the offered deals. The sides have also signed a 
protocol-memorandum in which the Americans made a commitment to 
look for construction resources. In the Tumey's words, the 
project will be drafted in four or five months. 
  Vainora said his enterprise had money for the preparation of 
the project but the problem of financing for the construction 
has not been settled yet. Lithuanians continue talks with the 
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development that has 
pledged financial help. 
  The preparatory work is already taking place in Butinge 
while 
the construction is scheduled to begin in summer. 
  The capacity of the projected terminal is 12 mln tons of oil 
per year. The construction will claim one and a half year and 
will cost, according to various studies, from USD 130 mln to USD 
200 mln.

<F P=106> [Report by Yuras Karmanaw: "Stanislaw Shushkevich: `I Am </F>
More Determined Than You Think'"] 
  [Text] Analyzing the reasons for the economic and political 
crisis -- the situation in which our society has found itself -- 
Stanislaw Shushkevich said that the key reason was the 
unwillingness of Belarusian authorities to undertake specific 
measures to reform the Belarusian economy. Market declarations, 
issued by the government, and antimarket measures, undertaken by 
it, have led to unbridled inflation and a catastrophic drop in 
GDP. (In February of this year, GDP dropped by 36 percent in 
comparison with the same period in 1993). The drop in 
production is continuing. "It is necessary to tell people the 
truth, to dispel the myth that, in comparison with other states, 
the Belarusian people live better," believes the former speaker 
of the legislature. "Having realized our current situation, it 
is necessary to undertake steps aimed at pulling the state out 
of the crisis." S. Shushkevich bases his steps on the program 
-- drafted by the Belarusian Social Democratic Assembly and the 
United Democratic Party of Belarus -- which foresees the quicker 
implementation of reforms. 
  As for the political situation in the Republic, S. 
Shushkevich paid attention to the constitutional crisis caused 
by the signing of the monetary merger agreement with Russia. 
Having sharply denounced the steps taken by the government, he 
called them "a conscientious gambling on public opinion," 
explaining his viewpoint by the fact that the government cannot 
but understand that even if the agreement comes into force in 
its current form, Belarusian workers in Soligorsk will receive 
their wages no quicker than workers in Vorkuta [Russia], who 
have not been paid in several months. S. Shushkevich cited the 
example of the Supreme Soviet commission, headed by A. 
Lukashenka, as the manifestation of the exacerbation of the 
constitutional crisis. "Though the commission's activity has 
made a lot of noise," argues S. Shushkevich, "no `mafia' members 
were punished. At the same time, the dismissal of the 
commission was illegal. The fact that some deputies withdrew 
from this commission could not be the reason for its shut down. 
The commission was enacted by the Supreme Soviet, so it was up 
to the Supreme Soviet to dismiss it." 
  Answering questions from the audience, which chiefly 
concerned the "unused Supreme Soviet chairman's power" and 
admonishments for being indecisive, S. Shushkevich said: "I am 
more determined than you think. However, my determination has 
never exceeded and will never exceed the limits of the law. As 
for the allegedly unused opportunities of the chairman's 
position, you are overestimating them. My power differed 
considerably from that of a president. I was only authorized to 
sign international treaties and agreements, and nobody will 
accuse me of giving Belarus a poor image on the international 
scene. As for other things, I fulfilled the Supreme Soviet's 
will. Please, recall my negative position on the collective 
security treaty. However, I was forced to sign it because this 
was the Supreme Soviet's decision." Rejecting the reproaches 
for being unable to set up a team of like-minded people when he 
occupied the position of Supreme Soviet chairman, S. Shushkevich 
said that such a team exists and, considering the recent 
mistakes -- one of his key mistakes being that "he trusted 
unworthy advisers" -- he will draw corresponding conclusions. 
It seems that the saying "forewarned is forearmed" 
characterizes fairly well Shushkevich's trump card on which his 
team counts.

<F P=106> [Report by Mikhail Rudkowski] </F>
  [Text] At the beginning of a news conference at the 
Supreme Soviet, Chairman Mechyslaw Hryb summed up the results of 
the extraordinary, 14th, Supreme Soviet session. He dwelt on 
the changes and addenda to certain legislative acts in 
connection with the signing of the monetary merger agreement 
with Russia. In particular, he said: 
  [Begin Hryb recording] In accordance with the agreement in 
the area of tariff regulations on external economic activities, 
both sides should introduce identical customs tariffs, taxes, 
and duties with regard to imports and exports. Under these 
conditions, customs duties in mutual trade are canceled as of 1 
May. The Russian side also commits itself to fully abolish 
customs duties on supplies of energy resources and raw materials 
to Belarus. Under this commitment, imports from Russia will be 
much cheaper. The decrease in prices for energy resources and 
raw materials in connection with the abolishment of customs 
duties will allow us to decrease the production cost of 
Belarusian goods, as well as [word indistinct] production and 
trade in our Republic. [end recording] 
  Supreme Soviet Chairman Mechyslaw Hryb then introduced 
members of the Constitutional Court to journalists. These 
judges were elected by Supreme Soviet deputies at yesterday's 
extraordinary session. Mechyslaw Hryb described how deputies 
were nominated for this high post. 
  [Begin Hryb recording] Candidates for this high post were 
put forward with the participation of people's deputies, 
permanent commissions -- especially the Commission for 
Legislation and the Commission for Statehood Building, and the 
Supreme Soviet Presidium. Proposals were also made by the 
Supreme Court of the Republic of Belarus, the Prosecutor's 
General Office, the KGB, the Interior Ministry, and the Justice 
Ministry. This work was being carried out openly, with the 
broad discussion of candidacies in Supreme Soviet commissions 
and at the Presidium sessions. 
  As you can see, there were many candidates proposed for the 
Constitutional Court. At Presidium sessions, we considered 
several dozen candidates. At the Supreme Soviet session, we 
considered 16 people, after listing them on a secret ballot. 
There were 10 candidates introduced on the secret ballot due to 
the fact that the Constitutional Court should comprise 11 
judges: nine members, one deputy chairman, and one chairman. 
All this was agreed upon. Nine judges of the Constitutional 
Court were elected by secret ballot. One candidate did not go 
through on the ballot. Thus, according to the law on the 
Constitutional Court, this judicial body, with regard to the 
number of judges, is legitimate and can begin work today. 
According to our laws, the Constitutional Court is legitimate if 
the body has at least seven members. So, it is legitimate. The 
Constitutional Court chairman will be elected by the Supreme 
Soviet at the recommendation of the future president. As has 
become known, at their session yesterday, members of the 
Constitutional Court elected Professor Valeryy Tsikhinya, doctor 
of juridical sciences, deputy chairman of the Constitutional 
Court. [end recording]

  [Text] Industrialists from Belarus and Ukraine do not raise 
the issue of restoring the former political union. However, to 
normalize the (?functioning) of the two states' economies, 
industrialists consider it necessary to restore the former 
economic relations. The monetary merger agreement between 
Belarus and Russia is a key factor for the establishment of our 
relations with Ukraine. In this case, Belarusian enterprises 
will receive the opportunity to settle their accounts with their 
Ukrainian partners -- who buy raw materials from Russia -- in 
Russian rubles, which will naturally have a positive impact on 
the work of Belarusian enterprises. In general, in the opinion 
of experts, the preservation of close partnership-like relations 
will impart a vital impulse to the stabilization of the economic 
situation.

<F P=106> [Telephone report by Ertugrul Bulent Danaci from Ashgabat </F>
over regional map -- recorded] 
  [Text] This morning, Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin was 
received by Turkmen President Saparmurad Niyazov, who told Cetin 
that Turkmenistan is grateful to Turkey for its contributions to 
Turkmenistan's development. Niyazov pointed out that work is 
under way in connection with the natural gas pipeline, adding 
that the natural gas will arrive in Turkey within two years and 
will be used at a much cheaper rate than today. 
  Niyazov said that Turkmenistan wants to name a textile 
factory under construction in the city of Tedzhen after 
President Suleyman Demirel. 
  Foreign Minister Cetin said he is happy to see the progress 
Turkmenistan has made in two years. He pointed out that the 
brotherly relations between Turkey and Turkmenistan develop with 
each passing day, adding: Turkey will continue to extend all 
kinds of help to brotherly Turkmenistan. 
  Cetin recalled that the project to deliver natural gas from 
Turkmenistan to Europe via Turkey is being executed by a 
consortium composed of Turkey, Turkmenistan, Russia, and Iran. 
He also said that Turkish businessmen want to build a port in 
the city of (Turkmenbasi) on the Caspian Sea. 
  During the meeting, which was conducted in a very warm 
atmosphere, Cetin repeated President Demirel's invitation to 
President Niyazov to visit Turkey. Cetin presented Niyazov with 
maps of Turkmenistan printed in Turkey in the Latin and Cyrillic 
alphabets, as well as with a Turkish diplomatic passport. 
Niyazov kissed the passport and touched it to his forehead, 
saying he considers Turkey his second motherland. 
  It is reported that Niyazov's visit to Turkey will take 
place 
either in late June or early July. 
  Cetin briefly interrupted his contacts in Turkmenistan to 
visit Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan. He was received at 
Tashkent Airport by Uzbek Foreign Minister Saidmukhtar Said 
Asymov. Cetin was later received by President Islam Karimov. 
The two men discussed all aspects of the relations between the 
two countries. On behalf of President Demirel, Cetin invited 
Karimov to Turkey. Meanwhile, Turkish Ambassador to Uzbekistan 
Erdogan Aytun presented his credentials to Karimov. 
  In the afternoon, delegations from the two countries, headed 
by the respective foreign ministers, held talks. Uzbek Foreign 
Minister Asymov said his country wants to further develop its 
economic and political relations with Turkey. He recalled that 
Turkey was the first country to recognize Uzbekistan and 
stressed that his people will never forget that. 
  Cetin said Turkey believes that relations between the two 
countries -- which are relatives, making them closer than 
friends -- have not developed sufficiently. He pointed out that 
the volume of trade between the two countries is $225 million. 
This should be raised to $1 billion, he stressed. 
  The foreign minister stated that Turkey extends all the 
economic aid it can to Uzbekistan. He explained that the 
$250-million loan extended by Eximbank and the $245-million 
sugar and wheat loans are being used. After concluding his 
contacts in Uzbekistan, Cetin returned to Ashgabat. 
  Tomorrow morning, Cetin will sign a consular agreement and a 
protocol on solidarity between the foreign ministries of the two 
countries. He will then return to Turkey.

  [Text] Ashgabat, April 30 (AA) -- Foreign Minister Hikmet 
Cetin on Saturday said that the oil pipeline with Turkmenistan 
was not on the agenda at this point. 
  Cetin concluded his official visits to Uzbekistan and 
Turkmenistan on Saturday. 
  Before leaving Ashgabat, Cetin visited site of a food 
products industrial installations that are being constructed by 
a Turkish company. 
  A consular agreement, and another foreseeing consultation 
meetings between the Foreign Ministries of Turkey and 
Turkmenistan, were signed by Cetin and Turkmenistan's 
Khalykberdi Atayev. 
  Speaking to reporters before his departure, Cetin said 
during 
the visit he has observed that the Central Asian republics with 
cooperation with Turkey have turned into a large construction 
site. 
  He said a project for the transfer of Turkmenistan natural 
gas to Europe through Turkey is final adding "I hope Turkey will 
use more of Turkmen natural gas in 1996 and at a cheaper price." 
  However, he said at the present an oil pipeline between the 
two countries is not on the agenda. 
  He said there are more than 40 Turkish companies doing 
business in Turkmenistan, adding this amounts to investments and 
projects worth of approximately one billion dollars, that 
include fields such as construction, food, yarn, weaving 
industry, hotel constructions, port construction and oil 
exploration. 
  In Uzbekistan he said there are more than 50 Turkish firms 
doing business there. 
  He said that he has communicated invitations by President 
Suleyman Demirel to the heads of state of Turkmenistan and 
Uzbekistan and Saparmurad Niyazov is expected in Turkey either 
by the end of June or beginning July, while Uzbekistan's Islam 
Karimov will be visiting Turkey within this year.

<F P=106> [Sophie Shihab report: "Francois Mitterrand Pays Homage to </F>
Turkmenistan's Regional Policy"] 
  [Text] Ashgabat -- On Wednesday 27 April, Francois 
Mitterrand saluted Turkmen President Saparmurat Niyazov with the 
words: "I wonder if you are not the only country in this region 
not to be involved in the wars being waged in this area and 
which are not second-rate conflicts but real wars." In this way 
he partly replied to the questions raised by his tour of 
Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. 
  One of the French president's aims was to shed some light on 
the conflicts in Central Asia at a time when attention is being 
focused on Bosnia, and on the Tajik conflict that may lead 
Russia to return to its old imperialist policy. That was 
certainly one of the reasons why he chose to visit these obscure 
Muslim states of the former USSR, going where no Western head of 
state had gone before; this is why he mobilized half a dozen 
aircraft and almost 400 people for the five-day state visit to 
areas with no modern infrastructure and where the heat is 
already crushing, especially on the many visits to archeological 
sites. It also explains why he has ignored the fact that the 
Uzbek and Turkmen presidents, although signatories to the CFCE 
accords, have blithely disregarded their provisions relating to 
civic freedoms. 
<H5>  Internal Weaknesses </H5>
  President Mitterrand explained why he did not intend making 
demands on these countries which have never known democracy, nor 
"make accusations if not everything is done in Turkmenistan in 
the same way as it is done in Paris." If he came here despite 
everything, it was because he wanted to demonstrate his support 
for them, considering it important, for geopolitical reasons, 
that their fragile independence be defended. These two new 
states, potential targets for Russia's recolonizing ambitions, 
still depend on Russia for their security and are forward posts 
of the CIS and buffers for the Russian borders against 
Afghanistan and Iran. 
  This perilous location is compounded by considerable 
internal 
weaknesses. Mr. Mitterrand said in Tashkent that there was the 
threat of "religious intolerance" being added to the "harshness 
of the times," i.e, the post-Soviet economic crisis that, in the 
case of Uzbekistan, is affecting the most densely populated 
country of central Asia, whose population grows by 500,000 each 
year. There is therefore every risk that sooner or later the 
extremists could get a stranglehold if foreign investments are 
delayed. 
  There is also the risk that Uzbek President Islam Karimov 
will seek to position himself to an even greater extent as the 
leader of a regional power "imposing stability" not just on his 
own people, which Mr. Mitterrand welcomed, but also on his 
neighbors, all of which have Uzbek minorities. This, the French 
president indirectly condemned by praising the opposite stance 
adopted the Turkmen neighbors. 
  Unlike Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan does not participate with 
the 
Russians in the "collective peace forces" deployed in Tajikstan. 
Also unlike Uzbekistan, and Iran and Pakistan, Turkmenistan is 
not involved in the inter-Afghan conflicts except as an 
attempted mediator. According to a presidential spokesman, the 
Turkmen president told Mr. Mitterrand that they were waiting for 
a "new man to emerge in the Pashtoon groups, capable of 
triggering national reconciliation." 
<H5>  Targeting the Insidious Forces </H5>
  President Niyazov has good reasons for implementing this 
wise 
foreign policy. With less than 4 million inhabitants but a vast 
area rich in gas reserves and a border of over 1,000 km with 
Iran, his country may look easy prey. Mr. Mitterrand told him 
on Thursday at the official dinner: "Your independence is 
certainly not threatened and the usurpation of power today is 
done by more insidious means, without necessarily requiring 
recourse to arms." The "insidious" forces he targeted are not so 
much the Iranians, neighbors with whom Mr. Niazov claimed he had 
no problems, as the Russians, since the only gas pipeline 
leaving the Turkmen gas fields crosses through Russian 
territory, supplying the insolvent countries of the CIS. Thus, 
Mr. Niyazov is a proponent of building a second gas pipeline to 
the south, toward the European markets. 
  Mr. Mitterrand pleased his host by stating on Wednesday that 
he did not share Washington's objections at sending the pipeline 
through Iran. He also pleased him by promising, as he had also 
promised the Uzbek president, that he would soon be sending a 
French military mission to look into the possibility of 
cooperation in the domain of air traffic control training and 
border patrols. These cooperation plans could also be envisaged 
within the framework of the NATO Partnership for Peace. With 
regard to this, the Turkmen president apparently amazed his 
French interlocutors by saying that he had already signed the 
framework agreement of the partnership. 
  Undoubtedly satisfied, on Wednesday the Turkmen president 
also agreed to sign an agreement with [French construction 
magnate] Martin Bouygues, who traveled in the presidential 
plane. This agreement covers the construction of the new 
presidential palace in Ashgabat and has been in the making for 
over a year. It is worth 400 million French francs, payable in 
cash during the construction work. 
  It is certainly quite legitimate and within the rules for a 
presidential visit to open the door for French companies. 
However, the Bouygues contract, which is not a priority in a 
country whose new currency has plummeted over recent months, 
could feed the discontent of the Turkmen people, despite the 
pride they might take in seeing their president well-housed. 
That was certainly not one of the aims of Francois Mitterrand's 
visit.

  [Text] Orenburg April 29 TASS -- Russian Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin came here on Friday to participate in 
festivities on the occasion of the 250th anniversary of the 
Orenburg Province. 
  "Russia needs uniting and consolidating all forces now as 
never before - the fact is reflected in the treaty on social 
accord and we had to cover such a long way towards its signing," 
Chernomyrdin said. 
  "The government is to accept much of the responsibility for 
the fulfillment of the treaty and it will do its best. As a 
head of government, I am responsible for the fate of our 
homeland before the people and Russia. We shall overcome 
difficulties. We need (to turn Russia into) a country where a 
man will live happily. And the new Russia already takes shape," 
he added. 
  According to Chernomyrdin, he believes in his government and 
does not map out to replace or fire anyone; its political course 
remains unchanged. 
  The Russian prime minister visited a gas-processing plant 
and 
discussed ways to increase the volume of oil and gas extraction, 
use new and old bore-holes effectively, speed up the processing 
and secure the ties inside the fuel-and-energy complex.

  [Text] Eduard Rossel, the ex-governor of Sverdlovsk Oblast, 
has been elected chairman of the oblast Duma. Eighteen out of 
28 deputies voted for him. Rossel was dismissed from his post 
as governor by an edict of the Russian president in November 
1993 for overstepping the limits of his powers in connection 
with the proclaiming of the Urals Republic. Rossel considers 
switching over to a regional policy in the real sense the main 
priority of his work as the Duma chairman. This means the 
oblast being able to decide independently what to do with its 
material and financial resources and being the owner of its 
natural resources.

receive the rank of vice premier of the Russian Government. A 
draft of the edict is being prepared in corresponding 
subdivisions of City Hall, and Boris Yeltsin's agreement to sign 
it has virtually been secured, according to information from the

<F P=106> [Natalya Pachegina report under the "Northern Caucasus" </F>
rubric: "Federation Council Confirms President's Edict. Nazran 
and Vladikavkaz Dissatisfied"] 
  [Text] The closed session of the Federation Council of the 
Russian Federation, whose work schedule included the question of 
confirming the Russian president's edict on extending the state 
of emergency in the zone of the Ossetia-Ingushetia conflict, was 
preceded by a meeting of Federation Council Chairman Vladimir 
Shumeyko and the presidents of Ossetia and Ingushetia with Yuriy 
Baturin, the Russian president's national security aide. The 
fourth man, as is rumored, was Sergey Filatov, the president's 
chief of staff. The interlocutors, as an informed source has 
confirmed, agreed that the amendments to the well-known edict of 
4 April made by the Russian Federation president should be 
confirmed by the Federation Council. The edict excluded the 
Republic of North Ossetia's Prigorodnyy Rayon population centers 
of Oktyabrskoye, Kambileyevskoye, Sunzha, and Sputnik, which 
geographically divide the state of emergency zone into two 
parts, from the list of villages whose territories were affected 
by the state of emergency rule. The "amendment" to President 
Yeltsin's edict that followed in the wake of the Ingush citizens 
convoy attacked in Vladikavkaz on 12 April introduced a measure 
of logic in the operation of the state of emergency rule on the 
territory of Prigorodnyy Rayon: all four villages have been 
again "returned" to the state of emergency zone. This 
Federation Council decision brought no satisfaction to the 
presidents of North Ossetia and Ingushetia. In the opinion of 
Akhsarbek Galazov, the edict extending the state of emergency 
rule brings about no serious change in the situation in the 
conflict zone. He is echoed by Yuriy Biragov, North Ossetia's 
Supreme Soviet chairman, who also thinks the Federation Council 
should have taken into consideration the proposal of the 
Provisional Administration, headed by Vladimir Lozovoy, that the 
State of Emergency zone be extended by including in it the 
Ingush territories. The Ingush villages of Galashki, Muzhichi, 
and Ali-Yurt, contiguous on North Ossetia's Prigorodnyy Rayon, 
would have created, Biragov thinks, a real security zone on the 
borders of the two republics. Vladikavkaz representatives also 
disagree with the opinion prevailing in Moscow and in the 
Provisional Administration that the republican law and order 
organs are unable to be on top of the situation on the territory 
entrusted to them. Owing to this, Vladikavkaz cannot recognize 
the primacy of the Provisional Administration's powers in the 
State of Emergency zone over those of the regional 
administration organs. 
  Neither is Ingushetia President Ruslan Aushev quite 
satisfied 
with the extension of the State of Emergency zone. His final 
objective -- the introduction of federal rule in the State of 
Emergency zone -- remains, as before, unrealized. Ingushetia's 
Nazran and Malgobek rayons, which are part of the State of 
Emergency zone, have been once again thus wrongly included, 
Aushev thinks, because their population poses no threat to 
neighboring Ossetia. The Federation Council's confirmation of 
the edict on the conflict zone, in the opinion of the president 
from Nazran, merely corrects the mistake made in the 4 April 
edict. 
  In the meantime, on 27 April Russian Government head Viktor 
Chernomyrdin signed a Russian Government decree expanding the 
powers of Provisional Administration head Vladimir Lozovoy on 
the territory of Mozdok, Prigorodnyy (Republic of North 
Ossetia), Malgobek, and Nazran rayons (Republic of Ingushetia). 
Under the decree, orders and directives of the Provisional 
Administration head are mandatory for federal organs of power of 
the Russian Federation, as well as for the executive organs of 
state power of federation components.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Shanayev] </F>
  [Text] Vladikavkaz April 29 TASS -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin intends to take part in the celebrations on the occasion 
of the 220th anniversary of Ossetia's voluntary joining of 
Russia and the 210th anniversary of the foundation of the city 
of Vladikavkaz. This was reported by President of North Ossetia 
Akhsarbek Galazov at his meeting with members of the Presidiums 
of the Supreme Soviet and the Government of the republic, and 
heads of the local self- government. 
  Akhsarbek Galazov said the Russian president stressed that 
these memorable dates in the life of the multinational people of 
North Ossetia should be widely celebrated in the Russian 
Federation. 
  "I informed Boris Yeltsin of the situation in the zone under 
state of emergency, the talks between the presidents and 
official delegations of North Ossetia and Ingushetia which began 
in the city of Nalchik on the initiative of the leadership of 
North Ossetia, and the concrete steps being made by the Ossetian 
side for the stabilization of the situation in the region," the 
president of North Ossetia noted. 
  Akhsarbek Galazov also met with Russian Prime Minister 
Viktor 
Chernomyrdin with whom he discussed a wide range of issues 
concerning the economic and social development of North Ossetia. 
  Speaking on the results of the closed meeting of the 
Federation Council of the Federal Assembly of the Russian 
Federation which considered the situation in the zone under 
state of emergency, Akhsarbek Galazov said that he categorically 
rejected the idea of the establishment of federal ruling in the 
Prigorodnyy district. He believes that this is a deadlock 
situation which may lead to a new tragedy in North Caucasus. 
The main direction in the settlement of relations between the 
peoples of North Ossetia and Ingushetia must be peaceful 
negotiations. 
  According to the president of North Ossetia, it is necessary 
to continue the talks with the Ingush side. "The dialogue 
between the presidents of North Ossetia and Ingushetia, and 
official delegations of the two republics is yet another step on 
the road to peace and accord, and the possibility to untie a 
tight knot of problems," Akhsarbek Galazov pointed out. 
  The date of the third round of talks in Nalchik is due to be 
fixed by the working groups of the two republics.

  [Text] Groznyy -- Chechnya Vice President Zelimkhan 
Yandarbiyev announced a possible meeting and signing of a treaty 
between the Russian Federation leadership and official Groznyy 
representatives. Mr. Yandarbiyev noted that "Elections in the 
Chechen state are possible only after a decision has been made 
by the leadership of the Ichkeria Republic, within the time 
frame established by the Constitution of Chechnya." 
  The head of the Chechnya security department has charged 
Russia's law enforcement bodies with criminals action aimed at 
undermining the republic's economy. In an official letter sent 
to the leadership of Russian Federation power structures, Sultan 
Geliskhanov reports that stable criminal groups, which for a 
long time have engaged in oil smuggling, are taking refuge in 
Russia. 
  The Crimean Republic has expressed a wish for comprehensive 
cooperation with the Chechen Republic. This is stated in a 
letter received by President Dudayev from the Crimean 
administration. The reaction by the Chechen leadership is so 
far unknown.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Young Party Elects Real Values"] </F>
  [Text]A presentation of the Party of Russian Unity 
and Accord (PRES) in the Republic of Tatarstan was held 
yesterday at the Kazan national cultural center. 
  There are more than enough of all sorts of presentations 
happening in Kazan. True, it is not always that they are 
attended by politicians of such caliber as the Russian 
Federation's deputy prime minister, Sergey Shakhray. Putting 
aside all business for a day, he came to Tatarstan to "bless" 
another regional branch of his party. 
  This visit, of course, was not to the taste of activists of 
some political organizations of a nationalist orientation: There 
were pickets at the entrance to the former Lenin memorial, with 
posters whose content the population has become accustomed to 
lately. 
  The introductory word at the presentation was delivered by 
Insaf Sayfullin, chairman of the board of the PRES regional 
branch. Judging by all signs, he does not have to worry about 
party affairs--they are on the upturn. When the PRES registered 
two months ago at the Republic of Tatarstan's Ministry of 
Justice, it had 67 Tatarstan residents as members. Now the ranks 
have more than doubled. 
  A number of [line(s) missing], heads of major industrial 
enterprises, and members of the technical intelligentsia reacted 
positively to the new entrant in the republic's political arena. 
Some even joined the PRES; some are still looking with an 
appraising eye at the political organization which proclaims 
itself a national conservative party adhering to traditional 
values: state, family, property, morality. After the signing of 
a treaty between Russia and Tatarstan, even many officials 
accept with a great deal of understanding the main ideological 
tenet of PRES--federalism, the strengthening of the Russian 
Federation through a diversity of forms of regional economic, 
political, national, and cultural development. 
  The young party probably will gain new supporters after S. 
Shakhray's speech yesterday, in which he outlined the PRES' main 
task as forming a concept of civil accord. His party's 
like-thinkers are represented in the Federation Council, and 30 
State Duma deputies follow PRES aims. Neither can one call its 
position in the Russian Federation government shaky--four 
ministers are active members of the party. All this enables the 
party, in Deputy Prime Minister S. Shakhray's opinion, to 
conduct a purposeful regional policy using economic and treaty 
mechanisms. 
  An announcement was made at the presentation that PRES has 
proposed a concrete draft of a confederation treaty, which 
envisages creating within the CIS framework a "core" consisting 
of three or four states ready for greater integration in matters 
of economics, collective security, and coordinated foreign 
policy. In the author's conception [line(s) missing], it is 
possible to form a confederation that envisages equal subjects 
voluntarily joining into a commonwealth. The key to the problem 
is how this process will proceed: on the basis of mutual 
understanding or "a la Zhirinovskiy"--by way of the absorption 
and destruction of republics and turning them into provinces. 
  Tatarstan's Vice President Vasiliy Likhachev predicted a 
good 
future for the PRES. In particular, he said that high political 
and legal culture are in Tatarstan's interests. We should not 
forget that not a single of the most complex issues at state 
level can be resolved without the consent of all sides. And it 
is good that a party whose activities revolve around the 
regional theme is currently strengthening its positions. This 
will help us to act together, to understand one another. 
  A press conference followed, where detailed replies were 
provided to journalists' questions. For instance, in S. 
Shakhray's opinion, very soon three directions will play a 
decisive role in the Russian Federation: [words indistinct], 
which will include communists; conservatives--on the basis of 
the PRES; and liberals, but spearheaded by Russia's Choice 
rather than the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]. Time 
will tell whether this prediction will come true.

<F P=106> [Undated comment by Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov: "I Will </F>
Allow No One To Cast a Cloud Over the Festivities in Moscow"] 
  [Text] It is gratifying that those who were only recently 
parading extremist inclinations are beginning to come to their 
senses. The political sphere has nowadays become more stable. 
In line with the standards of civilized, democratic countries, 
deputies' factions and political parties have formed which 
consolidate society and support exclusively parliamentary 
methods of fighting for power. A proof of this is the signing 
by all the leading political forces of the Treaty on Social 
Accord. 
  Those political forces linked with extremism which refused 
to 
participate in the treaty are undoubtedly losing the support of 
society. Unfortunately, it was necessary to go through the 
bloody events of 1 May last year and the clashes of 3-4 October 
1993 in order for the madmen to realize that this is no method 
for resolving political problems in Russia. Our country will 
never again bring itself to obtain rulers through methods of 
bloody dictatorship. We have had quite enough revolutions. We 
need victories only on the front line of winning prestige among 
people through concrete deeds. 
  Nevertheless, in the light of last year's bitter experience 
the forces of law and order have been primed in sufficiently 
large numbers for the holding of the May Day celebrations. I am 
confident that they will ensure peace and quiet for muscovites. 
But we are ready to take control and adopt appropriate measures 
against disturbers of public order. There are fears of a rash 
of terrorist acts more than of a plan of concerted actions by 
gunmen. But today they should understand that their plans will 
not go unresisted. 
  I am an optimist, but readiness to oppose extremists is an 
excellent thing in a mayor of Moscow. We are ready for any 
changes in the situation in the capital. And if anyone wants to 
cast a cloud over the holiday or to break the law, adequate 
measures and forces will be activated. At any rate, I 
personally will be at work on all four free days.

  [Text] More than 3,000 people took part in the May-Day 
demonstration in Nalchik on Sunday. The demonstrators marched 
along the city's central street from the square commemorating 
the 400th anniversary of Kabarda's joining Russia over to Lenin 
Square. Among the demonstrators were Prime Minister of 
Kabardino-Balkaria Georgiy Cherkesov, Vice President Gennadiy 
Gubin and other leaders of the republic. 
  The meeting in front of the government building was 
addressed 
by President of Kabardino-Balkaria Valeriy Kokov, who said that 
ethnic peace and agreement had been preserved and that May-Day 
celebrations were marked by optimism and confidence in the 
future. He also said that the embezzlement of national property 
had been prevented, the labor potential saved and social support 
provided for pensioners, disabled people and low-incomes groups. 
  Speaking about the situation in the Russian Federation, 
Kokov 
said that the adoption of the new constitution last December had 
marked the beginning of a new process of sociopolitical 
stabilization. "The bitter fate of the Soviet Union, whose 
break up filled the hearts of million of people with pain, will 
not befell on the Russian Federation," he said. 
  He also welcomed the signing of the Civic Accord agreement 
as 
a stabilizing factor which meets the interests of the people, 
who are tired of political confrontation. 
  In conclusion, Kokov congratulated Christians on Easter and 
expressed hope that religious confessions will help strengthen 
the unity of Kabardino-Balkaria and preserve ethnic peace. 
  After the meeting festivities were held involving 
professional and amateur performers.

<F P=106> [Article by V. Pavlov: "Government Knockout: Beginning 4 May </F>
a Kilowatt of Electricity for the Population Will Cost 63.6 
Rubles"] 
  [Text] This piece of news was delivered the day before 
yesterday at a scheduled meeting of the kray council of heads of 
administration by Dalenergo representative Yu. Ivanov. It left 
those present feeling shell-shocked. As it turned out, 
Government Decree No. 352, signed on 22 April, had not been 
coordinated with the regions, including Maritime Kray. So far, 
preferential rates, wrangled out by the kray administration with 
incredible difficulty, remain in effect. It was only thanks to 
this that the kray was able to survive a harsh winter without 
extraordinary losses. 
  The government's new knockout, which repeals all preferences 
for Maritime Kray, may be a mortal blow for us. Enterprises and 
organizations already owe 178 billion rubles [R] in unpaid 
electric power bills. Of this, R98 billion is to be reimbursed 
from the federal budget. Now it is frankly giving the kray the 
finger. 
  The chronic lack of money stemming from nonpayments and the 
massive decline in production is resulting in a considerable 
drop in budget revenue. At the same time, expenditures are 
growing, especially in the social sphere. S. Tereshkov, chief of 
the kray administration's financial department, emphasized at 
the council that budget revenue from kray sources is less than 
half as large as the expense part. Therefore it is quite 
realistic that the central government once again will freeze 
wages in budget-financed spheres. 
  In short, the situation is more than alarming. As to our 
fuel 
and energy sector, it is, without exaggeration, catastrophic. 
Repairs of equipment at central heat delivery systems alone 
require R403 billion. Practically none of this money is 
available. Despite the fact that with the advent of warm weather 
electricity use has dropped by 40 percent, no accumulation of 
fuel is taking place. Moreover, reserves are dropping. 
  Beginning 22 April suppliers stopped shipping coal to the 
kray. It is quite possible that as early as May restrictions on 
consumers will be introduced. The kray commission on emergency 
situations will have to search in the nearest future for 
cardinal ways out of the critical situation. 
  "If the government sets a price of R120 per kw for 
electricity delivered to enterprises, this will mean death to 
the Khrustalninsk mining and enrichment combine, as well as 
other industrial collectives," A. Akifyev, deputy head of 
Kavalerovskiy Rayon administration, said without hesitation. 
"They will never recover." 
  Is there a way out of the lethal situation into which our 
"dear" central government has pushed Maritime Kray and the rest 
of the country? Replying to this question, I. Lebedinets, 
chairman of the kray emergency commission, said that there is 
only one solution: mobilize all production and human resources 
in Maritime Kray into an all-people's construction project, 
which has never let us down in the past, and increase production 
of our own coal. Nobody will save us except ourselves. 
  No one would object to this idea, but there is 
catastrophically little time left for its implementation. If we 
are late... It is frightening to think of the consequences.

  [Text] On Wednesday the State Duma Committee for Economic 
Policy drew up a recommendation on a draft of the Russian 
federal budget for 1994. It proposes that the document should 
be rejected because it does not take into account a large number 
of the proposals made by the State Duma committees. The draft 
budget, which was sent to the State Duma, was elaborated by the 
government in accordance with a decision of the lower chamber of 
the parliament of 15 April. The committee's main arguments show 
that the amendments introduced into the budget strengthen the 
orientation of the government's economic policy on the 
preferential development of raw material industries without 
solving problems in other spheres of the economy.

  [Text] Kiev -- A UNIAN correspondent has learned that Yuriy 
Shcherbak, Ukraine's ambassador extraordinary and 
plenipotentiary to Israel, arrived in Ukraine's capital today. 
According to information from competent sources, this visit is 
an unplanned one and its purpose is to clarify two issues: The 
postponement of the date of the visit by Shim'on Peres, Israel's 
foreign affairs minister, which had been planned for 4-5 May, 
and clarification of the situation with the Jewish "Sochnut" 
agency. 
  This agency was set up in 1929 as the executive body of the 
World Zionist Organization, which represents Jews of the land of 
Israel at talks with the British authorities, foreign 
governments, and international organizations. Today, this is 
the main link uniting Israel with Jews of the diaspora. In 
Ukraine, "Sochnut" implements several educational programs, in 
accordance with which children from our state have the 
opportunity to study directly in Israel. Because several 
students expressed a wish not to return home, Ukraine's Ministry 
of Justice issued a note of protest. 
  "The idea of the Israeli state is based on the repatriation 
of Jews from the diaspora, Tzvi Magen, Israel's ambassador to 
Ukraine, reported. We cannot refuse a single person of Jewish 
descent citizenship of our country. At the same time, Ukrainian 
legislation envisages the freedom to choose one's place of 
residence for each person. There are no problems with Sochnut. 
There are nuances there." By nuances Israeli diplomacy 
understands the uncoordinated legislation of both states in 
certain issues, particularly educational ones. Apropos of this, 
Vasyl Onopenko, Ukraine's minister of justice, met a group of 
Israeli lawyers today, headed by Hayim Klugman, director general 
of Israel's Justice Ministry. Tzvi Magen and Yuriy Shcherbak 
also met today. Israel's ambassador to Ukraine reported that 
the visit by Shim'on Peres, Israel's minister of foreign 
affairs, which interalia was to have resolved the "Sochnut" 
situation, had been postponed to approximately the middle of 
June. "This does not signify misunderstandings between Ukraine 
and Israel, but is only a result of the excessively speedy 
signing of peace with the Palestinians, which cannot take place 
without the minister of foreign affairs." 
  According to information from Tzvi Magen, a visit to Ukraine 
by Yitzhaq Rabin, Israel's prime minister, who visited Moscow a 
week ago, is also planned for the summer.

  [Text] Sevastopol, 28 Apr -- Mykola Hlushkov, chairman of 
the Sevastopol State Administration, has called on the Ukrainian 
and Russian presidents urgently to settle the issue of the Black 
Sea Fleet. He deems it necessary that city leaders should also 
take part in negotiations, which should address the question of 
purposive economic assistance to the region from the states that 
use the territory of Crimea and Sevastopol for their military 
bases. In his appeal, Mykola Hlushkov says that the situation 
in the region is being further exacerbated because of lack of 
objective information and comments by Ukrainian and Russian 
chief officials regarding actions by the two states' defense 
ministers.

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Golub: "The Fleet Is Not a Hunk of </F>
Bread, and You Cannot Divide It in Half. L. Kravchuk in Search 
of `Historical Enemy'"] 
  [Text] Lvov -- As might have been expected, the failure of 
the Ukrainian-Russian talks on the parameters of the division of 
the Black Sea Fleet is being actively discussed in Ukraine. 
Rejecting accusations of revising the Moscow agreements 
previously reached by the presidents of the two states, 
Ukrainians are pinning the entire responsibility for the 
conflict on the Russian side. 
  Naturally, the fuss that has been raised does not help the 
majority of Ukrainian citizens, who are already following all 
the divisions ensuing from the Belovezhskaya Forest agreement 
with great pain, to remain calm. The only people who have 
benefitted from the tension have perhaps been the right-wing, 
radically inclined nationalist forces. With support from the 
Kiev authorities, they have tried to unleash an appropriate 
propaganda campaign. They are presenting the essence of the 
problem as the eviction of sovereign Ukraine from its own 
territory in Crimea through the "occupation" of the latter by 
the Russian Federation Navy. The Ukrainian leadership is being 
blamed for serious mistakes in respect of the Black Sea Fleet 
and Crimea, which have "made it possible to turn the peninsula 
into the bridgehead of Russia's permanent threat of aggression 
against the Ukrainian state." 
  The Ukrainians are also very pained about the results of the 
meeting between Pavel Grachev and admirals and officers of the 
Black Sea Fleet staff and the promotion in rank of the commander 
of Cheleken who, according to the Ukrainian side, took stolen 
radiological equipment worth millions of dollars out of Odessa. 
Moscow's attempts to include Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov in 
the negotiating process are also being received in a mixed way, 
to say the least. This attempt may help intensify separatist 
moods in Crimea and reinforce Meshkov's own position. 
  The national democrats are demanding the adoption of 
resolute 
and tough measures by official Kiev. They insist on restricting 
the topics for discussion during the Ukrainian-Russian talks to 
no more than the division of the Black Sea Fleet, with the 
gradual withdrawal of all Russian military structures from 
Ukrainian territory, which, in their opinion, is the main object 
of the claims of the neighboring state. By trying to impose on 
Russia a territory outside Ukraine by way of a permanent main 
base for the Black Sea Fleet, for example Novorossiysk, people 
here are trying to create problems for Moscow with the so-called 
"floating stock." The Ukrainian authorities do not agree with 
the assertion made by P. Grachev during a press conference that 
the Ukrainian Navy has seized 126 Black Sea Fleet ships, and 
apart from that, a 20-percent share seemed too small for the 
infrastructure of the fleet. 
  Strange as it may seem, the explosive situation has proved 
advantageous to Leonid Kravchuk in terms of settling his own 
domestic problems. And if it does not prove possible to put a 
stop to the early elections, which do not bode well for the 
president, then the chance remains of least somehow keeping 
afloat, using the image of savior of the nation and the state in 
the face of intervention by the "historical enemy," which is on 
the point of beginning tomorrow. That, perhaps, is precisely 
where one of the roots of the conflict lies. That is why, 
despite the statement made by the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense 
Press Service on its readiness to resume the negotiating process 
at any time, to be honest, there is not much certainty that this 
will happen.

in Bosnia and Herzegovina has been stationed together with the 
first Ukrainian battalion in Sarajevo. This was announced by 
Ukrainian Envoy Nikolay Ozodovskiy at a briefing in Kiev today. 
  He said the UN command would deploy the Ukrainian new 
peacekeeping formation in Gorazde only after an official 
agreement on this be received from Bosnian Serbs and Moslems. 
  Currently, in Gorazde there is a squad of the Ukrainian 
contingency within the composition of the international 
battalion. The battalion is commanded by an Ukrainian officer. 
  The Ukrainian second peacekeeping battalion was sent to 
Bosnia at the request by the UN Secretary General. The 
Ukrainian contingency within the UN peacekeeping forces was 
increased from 420 to 1,200 people. 
  Ozodovskiy said the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry's mission to 
ex-Yugoslavia had met the command of the conflicting parties and 
had discussed guarantees for security of Ukrainian peacekeeping 
officers. 
  Ozodovskiy announced that in ex-Yugoslavia six Ukrainian 
servicemen had been killed and 26 wounded. He put the total 
loss suffered by the UN peacekeeping forces over the last year 
at 216 people killed and wounded.

  [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk said Ukraine was 
bearing the whole brunt of problems caused by the Chernobyl 
disaster, "although the country which planted the Chernobyl bomb 
under Ukraine no longer exists." 
  Ukraine will be unable to solve those problems without the 
world community's assistance, Kravchuk said on Tuesday at a 
rally marking the eighth anniversary of the tragedy. 
  "We can understand those who demand that the Chernobyl 
Nuclear Power Plant be closed down immediately," he said, adding 
that Ukraine would need international assistance in that too. 
But Ukraine "cannot do without" nuclear plants, he told the 
rally, held outside the fire station whose personnel fought the 
fire at the Chernobyl plant on 26 April 1986. 
  Also on Tuesday, local activists of the international 
Greenpeace erected a symbolic earth mound to commemorate the 
Chernobyl victims. 
  Last year Ukraine's nuclear plants generated 33 pct (the 
Chernobyl plant 7 pct) of the country's electricity.

  [Text] Moscow, 30 Apr -- The Russian Armed Forces are to be 
withdrawn from the territory of the Latvian Republic by 31 
August 1994. This was reflected in the Treaty between Russia 
and Latvia signed by the presidents of Russia and Latvia in the 
Kremlin today. 
  Replying to a question from an ITAR-TASS correspondent after 
the signing ceremony in the Vladimir Hall of the Kremlin, 
Yeltsin said that a package consisting of five documents had 
been signed. They had been prepared, he said, with full 
agreement by both sides. 
  Noting that the documents mainly connected with the 
withdrawal of troops and the social protection of servicemen and 
retired servicemen were signed in the Kremlin today, Yeltsin 
said a package of bilateral economic agreements would be drawn 
up and signed during a visit to Latvia by the head of the 
Russian Government Viktor Chernomyrdin.

  [Text] Today, at the Russian Foreign Ministry Latvian 
President Guntis Ulmanis held a news conference. A certain 
amount of tension exists in relations between Russia and Latvia, 
and it is connected first and foremost with the situation of the 
Russian-speaking population in this Baltic Republic, and also 
with the presence of Russian servicemen there. It seems that 
these issues were at the focus of attention of those taking part 
in the news conference. However, let us listen to Ulmanis 
himself. Trusting the assembled journalists' promises not to 
criticize him for his incorrect use of Russian, the president 
summed up the results of his visit: 
  [Begin Ulmanis recording] We came here with the firm 
intention of expressing our attitude to those issues that are 
presently hampering the existence of normal, good-neighborly 
and, I would say, friendly relations between our two neighboring 
countries. The issues in question are the withdrawal of troops, 
the elimination of the Skrunda radar station, and matters 
relating to economic relations. I must straightaway acknowledge 
that I met with full mutual understanding on President Yeltsin's 
part. As a result, one treaty, three agreements, and one 
protocol have been signed. 
  The documents boil down essentially to the total and 
unconditional withdrawal of Russia's troops before 31 August 
1994. In the course of talks with the defense minister it was 
stated that the troops might be withdrawn considerably earlier. 
A treaty was signed on the status of the Skrunda radar station. 
It will have the status of a military establishment under 
civilian control, and cannot have the status of a military base. 
An agreement was also signed on social guarantees for all the 
people affected by this process. In the main, this concerns the 
military pensioners and their future destiny. We view this 
package of documents as a unified whole and as a regrettable 
necessity, with which history has presented us. It is viewed as 
a unified package of documents, which pursues the single goal of 
normalizing relations between the two states. 
  Two things recently have been very important for us: We have 
received from the Russian side information on the numbers of 
military pensioners. As president, I need always to know this 
figure by heart. There are 22,320 of these people, and the 
social guarantees apply to them. Secondly, we are together with 
the Russian side creating a repatriation fund, which will help 
in a civilized way those people so wishing to leave Latvia. 
  I am left deeply impressed by all that has happened today, 
since history has never before known a day when the national 
anthem of a free Latvia has been played in a free Russia. I 
should very much like this day to have broken the ice of 
distrust and the hostility -- we shall not hide it -- which has 
existed both in Russia and in Latvia, because our task and our 
results will only be positively achieved when the population of 
Latvia and the population of Russia begin thinking in the way 
that we now desire. [end recording]

Krylovich] 
  [Text] Moscow, 30 Apr -- One would like to hope that 
today's meeting will break the ice of suspicion and hostility, 
which still exists in relations between Russia and Latvia, 
stated Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis at a news conference 
which took place after his talks with Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin. 
  Evaluating the package of documents signed in the course of 
the talks, he said that he views them "as a unified whole and as 
a regrettable necessity with which history has presented us. 
There are probably some mistakes and contradictions in these 
documents, but we view them as a single package which has only 
one aim -- to normalize relations between the two states," 
Ulmanis stressed. Having expressed the hope that the parliaments 
of the both countries will ratify the documents signed in 
Moscow, the Latvian president has refrained from speculations on 
how soon this might happen. 
  Guntis Ulmanis stressed that "feeling responsibility for the 
future of these two neighboring states, he reached full mutual 
understanding" with the Russian president on all the issues 
discussed. [punctuation as received] 
  In the view of Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs, "the 
most significant result of the talks was the accord on the 
introduction of most favored nation status in the relations 
between Russia and Latvia on 1 June." He stressed that a treaty 
on economic cooperation and trade is already practically ready, 
enabling the adopted decisions to be implemented in such a short 
time. Birkavs expressed hope that the visit by Russian Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, during which documents on economic 
cooperation between the two countries are expected to be signed, 
will take place in the second half of May.

  [Text] Addressing journalists after the signing of 
Russian-Latvian documents in the Kremlin on Saturday, President 
Yeltsin apologized to the Latvians for anti-Latvian actions by 
Stalin's totalitarian regime. 
  "We declare that again. We condemn those actions against 
independent Latvia and its people," Yeltsin stressed. 
  Speaking in reply, Latvia's President Guntis Ulmanis voiced 
hope that Yeltsin's statement would help many Latvians to get 
over the prejudices piled up over the past decades in relations 
with Russia. 
  Asked by an INTERFAX correspondent about the outcome of 
bilateral talks, Yeltsin revealed that along with preparation 
for the signing ceremony he and Ulmanis had drawn up guidelines 
for economic accords with the view to endorse them. According 
to Yeltsin, there are 10 such drafts, including documents on 
free trade, on the most favoured status in trade, and on 
easy-term taxation. 
  In Yeltsin's words, a mixed working group will elaborate on 
these documents so that Russia's Premier Victor Chernomyrdin 
could sign them during a visit to Riga. However, it is too 
early to say when precisely he will go there, Yeltsin said.

Yeltsin said in the Kremlin today while answering journalists'

agreements. 
  Russia intends to withdraw all troops from Estonia, but we 
want this to be done on a legal basis, as is already taking 
place in Russia's mutual relations with Lithuania and Latvia, 
Yeltsin stressed. In connection with this, he recalled that 
Russia was strictly observing the accords reached in Germany, 
and that Russian soldiers would leave this country by the end of 
the year. 
  If the Estonian side shows goodwill, it will have full 
consent from ours, Yeltsin said in conclusion.

  [Text] Moscow 30 April TASS -- Latvian President Guntis 
Ulmanis ended his visit to Moscow and left for Riga late on 
Saturday. 
  During the visit Ulmanis and President Boris Yeltsin signed 
an agreement to withdraw Russian troops from Latvia by 31 August 
1994 and a number of agreements concerning the status of Russian 
servicemen in Latvia, members of their families and military 
pensioners. 
  In an interview with ITAR-TASS after the talks Yeltsin said 
that "Russian-Latvian documents signed today in the Kremlin were 
drawn up with full consent of both sides." 
  Ulmanis said the reached agreements aim at normalising 
relations between the two countries. He stressed he and Yeltsin 
reached "full understanding" on all issues included in the 
agenda of the talks. 
  Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs said that the 
agreement 
on economic cooperation and trade between Russia and Latvia is 
also practically ready and will facilitate the soonest possible 
implementation of the reached accords. Birkavs expressed the 
confidence that the agreement can be signed during Russian Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's upcoming visit to Latvia due to 
take place in the second half of May.

  [Text] Moscow, 30 Apr -- The Russian Armed Forces are to be 
withdrawn from the territory of the Republic of Latvia by 31 
August 1994. ITAR-TASS correspondents learned this during the 
course of talks between Russian President Boris Yeltsin and 
Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis. 
  Russia and Latvia will sign a treaty on conditions, 
deadlines, and the procedure for the complete withdrawal of the 
Russian Armed Forces from the territory of the Latvian Republic 
and their legal situation for the period of the withdrawal. The 
complete withdrawal of the Armed Forces includes all members of 
the Russian Armed Forces, members of their families and personal 
estate. 
  An integral part of the present treaty will also be an 
agreement on the status of the Skrunda radar station for the

  Agreements will be signed between the two countries on 
matters of social protection for military servicemen and members 
of their families temporarily resident on the territory of the 
Latvian Republic until their complete withdrawal, as well as 
matters of social protection for military pensioners and their 
families living on the territory of the Latvian Republic.

Andrey Kozyrev and visiting Irish Deputy Prime Minister and 
Foreign Minister, Dick Spring, signed an intergovernment 
agreement on the prevention of double taxation on Friday. 
  During a news conference the Russian foreign minister said 
that a declaration on principles of relations between Russia and 
Ireland signed in Dublin last October was not merely an 
expression of their good intentions, but it was an important 
starting point for concrete work. Kozyrev pointed out the 
successful development of Russo-Irish ties at the level of 
concrete business-projects. "We have created a system of 
multi-stage political consultations on problems of the European 
and world politics," Kozyrev said, adding that he was grateful 
to Ireland for its assistance in finalizing an agreement on 
full- scale cooperation with the European Union. 
  Both Russian and Irish foreign ministers unanimously 
approved 
the level reached in the relations between the two countries, 
describing it as a very good and even excellent level and 
expressed confidence that bilateral relations would successfully 
develop.

  [Text] Moscow, 29 Apr -- Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev has again called for the earliest possible meeting on 
Bosnia with the participation of Russia, the United States, the 
European Union [EU], and the United Nations. Such a meeting 
"would help to consolidate the approaches" of the interested 
sides, he said at a news conference following talks here with 
Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister. A. Kozyrev stressed 
the role of the EU in settling the Bosnian conflict, which he 
described as "a key factor." 
  As a representative of an EU member country, the Irish 
minister supported the proposal to urgently sit down at the 
negotiating table. "Once we get down to directly discussing the 
problem it won't be so difficult to reach a common international 
position," D. Spring noted, replying to an ITAR-TASS 
correspondent's question on the closeness of the approaches of 
Russia and the EU to this regional conflict.

  [Text] Russia's Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev hopes that 
next week the foreign policy chiefs of the United States and the 
countries of the European Union and himself, as well as 
representatives of the United Nations, will meet to coordinate 
plans for a Bosnian settlement. 
  Upon arrival in Moscow from Bonn, Thursday [28 April], 
Kozyrev told an INTERFAX reporter that a foreign ministers 
conference on Bosnia stood a good chance and he would work to 
have it take place even though problems remained. What counted 
most, he said, was the decision to go beyond NATO's plan for 
military action. Kozyrev suggested that NATO's moves be seen as 
a link in the chain that started with the United Nations' call 
for action and would lead to a Security Council discussion of 
the Bosnian problem. 
  Thursday evening, according to Kozyrev, U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher said he intended to hold a telephone 
conversation with his Russian counterpart. Let us wait and see 
what Secretary Christopher has to say, said Kozyrev. 
  Whether a foreign ministers conference on Bosnia would 
approve a provisional formula for a settlement depended, in 
Kozyrev's view, on moves by the ministers' contact group. 
Moscow refused to rely exclusively on the contact group, he 
said. 
  Kozyrev's deputy and President Yeltsin's special emissary 
for 
Bosnia Vitaliy Churkin has left Moscow for Oslo where he is to 
meet Friday with international mediators David Owen and Thurwald 
Stoltenberg. Kozyrev said Churkin's meeting with the 
international mediators opened an additional channel for work on 
a Bosnian conference. 
  The ministers were also working on the conference, so 
efforts 
were being made, Kozyrev pointed out, in three directions and 
although he could not be 100-percent sure, he was reasonably 
confident the conference would take place next week. The 
ministers could meet, as usual, Kozyrev said, in Geneva. 
  In the meantime, a Western source told INTERFAX the 
ministers 
would most likely meet in Finland or some other country of 
northern Europe and that they had already agreed to meet on next 
Tuesday or Wednesday.

"Moscow Will Not Protect Barbarity out of Self-Respect. Andrey 
Kozyrev is True to Russian Tsar Precepts"] 
  [Text] A ministerial meeting on the Bosnian conflict 
settlement may take place late next week. This was announced by 
Andrey Kozyrev on returning from Geneva and Bonn where he talked 
with Warren Christopher, Alain Juppe, and Klaus Kinkel. The 
conflicting sides are not to take part in the talks. According 
to the minister, it is important now to hammer out a 
"consolidated approach to the problem," something to be taken up 
by representatives of the United Nations, the EC, Russia, the 
United States, Great Britain, and France. Kozyrev voiced 
satisfaction that the Western partners "do not become locked 
into forcible solutions." He believes that the meeting of six 
ministers may become a "major stage" in the preparation of a 
summit in the same format. 
  Since the talks with Christopher had left a somewhat painful 
aftertaste, your SEGODNYA correspondent thought it fitting to 
ask if a Bosnian settlement might become victim to the Atlantic 
unity Europeans treasure so much. Kozyrev replied that Russia 
also treasures partnership with the United States, but this only 
favors the search for a shared conception. 
  Reports from Gorazde, where General Rose stated that the 
Muslim side had deluded the world community as to the number of 
victims and extent of destruction in the city, lent Kozyrev's 
trip some poignancy. Kozyrev said to this that the Muslims 
would of course be doing all they can to provoke air strikes 
against their enemy. In his view, the important thing is not to 
reply to provocations, but that the Serbs' reply was "absolutely 
inadequate" to the situation. 
  Your SEGODNYA correspondent asked the minister if he thought 
he had really been too carried away with political infighting, 
as some newspapers believe. Kozyrev answered: "We would have 
been good-for-nothing politicians and good-for-nothing democrats 
had we not paid attention to public opinion." The matter is, 
the minister went on to say, precisely which amendments to make, 
and with whom to compromise. "Some criticize us for having sold 
ourselves to the Bolsheviks, others for having sold ourselves to 
the Americans. This is normal, this keeps us on the ball," 
Kozyrev said. He underlined that thanks to Moscow's vigorous 
actions, the NATO plan was cut back "50 or so percent." An 
alternative for Russia would have been a categorical "no" with 
no regard for the situation whatever. In the minister's view, 
this is "extremism toward the other side." 
  Kozyrev thinks that all the talk about Russia's being 
robbed, 
that it has once again been passed over and denied its fair 
share, is nothing but a symptom of an inferiority complex. It 
is an inferiority complex that boosted the political career of 
the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia. "It is on this crest," 
he underlined, "that dictatorial regimes are made. As for 
democracy, this means self-respect. It is out of self-respect 
that we cannot protect barbarity." He recalled in this 
connection that it was none other than the Russian tsar who 
first had the idea for the convention banning uncivilized 
methods of warfare -- this tradition should be maintained. 
  In Kozyrev's words, one should not think that every word of 
Moscow is going to be taken as an eye-opener. "You cannot say 
the men in Moscow know precisely what to do. But then they do 
not know it in Washington either," the minister concluded.

  [Text] Moscow 29 April TASS -- "Obvious violation of the 
principle of equal responsibility in respect of the participants 
in Bosnian and Serb-Croatian conflicts leads to their 
exacerbation and hampers the beginning of serious peace talks." 
  Such was the conclusion made by an official delegation of 
Russian lawmakers from the State Duma (Russian parliament's 
lower house) on the results of their visit to the union Republic 
of Yugoslavia, Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The delegation prepared a communique on preliminary results 
of the visit, which was highlighted at a news conference on 
Friday [29 April]. 
  The lawmakers visited former Yugoslavia on 21-27 April with 
a 
view to working out proposals on settling the crisis. The 
delegation brought together representatives of all the State 
Duma factions. They visited Belgrade, Pale, Sarajevo (including 
its Moslem part), Vukovar, and Zagreb. 
  According to the communique, Russia "should make concerted 
efforts through the UN framework to cancel gradually sanctions 
against the union Republic of Yugoslavia, which are a serious 
manifestation of world community's unbalanced approach to the 
conflicting parties." 
  The lawmakers expressed particular concern about "actual 
information warfare against Serbs unleashed by the mass media." 
  Most of the members of the delegation believe that the 
Russian Foreign Ministry made mistakes in recognizing the 
unitary state of Bosnia-Herzegovina and in supporting unilateral 
sanctions adopted by UN against the union Republic of Yugoslavia. 
  According to Deputy Konstantin Zatulin, who represented the 
Party of Russian Unity and Accord, the delegates derived an 
impression from talking with UN representatives that the latter 
"are under tremendous pressure from NATO officers, who itch to 
resort to force in former Yugoslavia." 
  The delegates will present their conclusions at a plenary 
session of the State Duma scheduled for 11 May.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Vladimir Korochantsev </F>
and Yuriy Pichugin] 
  [Text] Pretoria 29 April TASS -- A mission of Russian State 
Duma deputies in South Africa, where they observed the universal 
non-racial elections, has been completed. 
  Before leaving for Russia on Friday deputy group head A. 
Chilingarov told ITAR-TASS the voting was a historic stage in 
the life of South Africa divided in the recent past by racial 
barriers. 
  "We have visited many areas of residence of white and black 
communities and talked to representatives of various political 
parties, officials and average voters," he said. "We were most 
impressed by activeness of the population, enthusiasm of 
Africans who have been given the right to vote for the first 
time, and the atmosphere of friendliness in meters-long lines to 
the polling stations." 
  In his opinion, some drawbacks in the elections were caused 
by the absence of registration lists, which resulted in a sharp 
shortage of ballot sheets. This may give a reason for doubts in 
case of any disputes. 
  The Russian observer mission included V. Sheynis, G. 
Seleznev 
and I. Novitskaya. In their opinion, the South African 
elections signify a transition from confrontation to cooperation 
and show the will of representatives of all races and political 
convictions to national reconciliation and solution of 
disputable issues exclusively by peaceful civilized methods. 
  The parliament members noted genuine interest of South 
Africans in Russia and their striving to develop fruitful and 
friendly relations with it.

  [Text] A further 227 Russian peacekeepers complete with 
satellite communication equipment has been airlifted aboard two 
airforce transport planes from a military airport in Ryazan to 
ex-Yugoslavia, military officials told Interfax in Moscow. The 
operation is part of the rotation of the Russian contingent of 
the United Nations Protection Force there. 
  As many as 600 servicemen of the 1,500-strong Russian 
peacekeeping force deployed in the former Yugoslavia are to be 
replaced in April. 
  It is now known that many of the peacekeepers who served a 
term of six months and earned $6,000 have bought cars and will 
be travelling home by road.

  [Text] Moscow 29 April TASS -- In the talks being held 
between South Korean Defence Minister Yi Pyong-tae and various 
Russian officials, the Russian side has issued a new proposal 
concerning the creation of a collective security system in the 
Asian-Pacific region. Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev 
spoke to reporters after meeting with his South Korean 
colleague, saying that the proposal would be examined in Seoul. 
He noted that a special group of experts might be formed in the 
near future to work out a conceptual framework of security in 
the region. 
  The two defence ministers also discussed problems concerning 
North Korea. Grachev expressed Russia's worry over North 
Korea's nuclear programme, saying that it would be best if the 
Republic continued to adhere to the nuclear non-proliferation 
treaty. He reported that the two sides discussed various ways 
of putting pressure on North Korea so that it did not abandon 
the treaty, in order to avoid creating additional security 
problems for the Korean peninsula and other areas as well. 
  In November 1992, President Boris Yeltsin travelled to 
Seoul, 
where he signed an agreement on principles of relations between 
the Russian Federation and the Republic of South Korea. This 
document has determined the further development of their 
bilateral relations, Grachev pointed out. 
  During the current negotiations, the two sides agreed on the 
necessity of continuing close military cooperation between 
Russia and South Korea on a higher level, announced Yi 
Pyong-tae. He said that the talks had revealed a common 
determination to not permit a worsening of the situation on the 
Korean peninsula or in North-east Asia as a whole. 
  The danger in this direction comes from North Korea's 
position on the nuclear question, he declared. "We believe that 
North Korea should adhere to the Nuclear Non-proliferation 
Treaty and become a full and responsible member of the 
international community," the South Korean defence minister 
stated. 
  The military ties between Russia and South Korea will serve 
as confidence- and security-building measures both between the 
two countries and on the Korean peninsula, stressed Yi 
Pyong-tae. If the security of the Korean peninsula is ensured, 
that will contribute to the security of the whole world, he 
declared.

  [Text] We have been awaiting information from 
Nagorno-Karabakh. It had been thought that the agreement on a 
cease-fire would come into force. However, according to news 
agency reports, last night was not a quiet one. Today the 
Russian Foreign Ministry sent the following explanation. It 
says, and I quote: It proved impossible to draft the agreement 
on a cease-fire from midnight last night, although generally 
positive, but differing replies have been received from Baku and 
Stepanakert. The response from Nagorno-Karabakh, the Foreign 
Ministry says, does not accord with Russia's latest specific 
proposal. Russia is, however, continuing its efforts to bring 
the positions closer together.

  [Text] Moscow, 29 April (YONHAP) -- The Russian Government 
said Thursday [28 April] that any foreigners staying in Russia 
"legally" are free to leave the country, indicating Moscow has 
no intention of tuning in to Seoul's bid for an early 
resettlement in South Korea of North Koreans who have escaped 
from Siberian logging camps. 
  Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Grigory Karasin said at a 
routine news briefing, "Russia will not prevent foreigners from 
leaving for any country if they did not commit particular 
criminal offenses, are not on a police wanted list and possess 
legal immigration documents. In such cases, we do not have to 
discuss with their countries of origin (on allowing them to 
leave Russia for any destination)." 
  Karasin's remarks were taken by diplomats here as an 
explicit 
expression of Moscow's intention to have North Korean loggers, 
most of whom have no passport or travel documents, apply for a 
permit to stay in Russia before trying to fly to Seoul. 
  Karasin also said it is not within the Russian Government's 
authority to issue visas or departure permits to foreigners 
wishing to leave the country. 
  Moscow was astonished by the recent media fuss in South 
Korea 
about the North Korean escapees, said the spokesman, who feared 
any distortion of Russia's position on the matter could damage 
its relations with third countries. 
  The Russian Government has yet to receive any applications 
from North Korean loggers seeking help to go to Seoul, Karasin 
said. 
  The South Korean Embassy here also said no North Koreans 
have 
contacted it since Seoul announced 15 April that it would accept 
all willing North Korean loggers. At the time, the Seoul 
Government revealed around 100 North Korean loggers had 
contacted Seoul missions in Russia seeking refuge in South Korea.

  [Text] Moscow 29 April TASS -- The Russian Foreign 
Intelligence Service believes that a life sentence which ex-CIA 
officer Aldrich Ames got for spying for the USSR and Russia is a 
very severe punishment. 
  "No matter for who Ames worked, we believe the punishment to 
be too harsh," Tatyana Samolis, spokeswoman of the director of 
the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, told TASS on Friday. 
  "I believe that after the end of the `Cold War' and with the 
general warming of the world political climate, as well as from 
purely humane considerations, he should not have been sentenced 
for life," Samolis said. 
  She added that most of her colleagues regard the ballyhoo 
around the so-called "major spy case in the history of the 
United States" as hypocrisy. 
  Addressing Russian intelligence officers on Wednesday, 
President Boris Yeltsin said that the "true reasons of this 
anti-Russian (Ames) affair have a purely political tint" and 
added that the United States is "mounting efforts to recruit 
spies in Russia."

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Pshenichnikov] </F>
  [Text] Oslo 29 April TASS -- Special representative of the 
Russian president Vitaliy Churkin met on Friday with Co-Chairmen 
of the Coordinating Committee of the International Conference on 
Former Yugoslavia Thorvald Stoltenberg and Lord Owen to discuss 
the initiative recently proposed by Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev that the heads of the foreign ministries of 
Russia, the U.S. and other "key countries" meet and work out a 
way to put an end to the crisis in Bosnia. 
  The meeting between the foreign ministers of Russia, the 
U.S., and the other "key countries" is designed to coordinate 
the efforts of the world community to end the war in Bosnia, the 
diplomats announced at the press conference held after they 
approved the Russian initiative. The sides involved in the 
Bosnian conflict will not be invited to the conference. 
  The date and place of the meeting between the foreign 
ministers have not been specified as yet, Churkin told ITAR-TASS. 
  According to him, Russia, the USA and "leading European 
countries" will participate in the meeting, which will be "a 
special forum" independent of the international conference on 
Former Yugoslavia. Participants in the meeting will "make 
serious decisions," he said. 
  Participants in a news conference devoted to the results of 
trilateral consultations said on Friday that the forthcoming 
meeting between the foreign ministers was to take place "as soon 
as possible" and to work out "a coordinated approach, a general 
strategy of international community in respect of settling 
crisis in Bosnia." 
  According to them, the foreign ministers will consider 
situation in Gorazde and a mechanism of "settling crisis in 
Bosnia as a whole." The warring parties in Bosnian conflict 
will not be invited to the meeting. 
  Participants in the news conference emphasized that after 
the 
situation in Gorazde was relatively normalized, there was a good 
chance that the belligerents would agree to a ceasefire in 
Bosnia. 
  They also described criticism levelled at allegedly 
ineffective efforts of Stoltenberg and Owen as groundless. 
  Peace-making process is actually replete with 
disappointments 
and failures, but it does not mean that no effort is being made, 
Stoltenberg said. 
  The blame for constant foiling peace-making efforts rests 
not 
with the international community, but with the belligerents who 
fail to come to terms, Churkin said in this connection. 
  We cannot wait for a showdown in the war in Bosnia any 
longer, Owen emphasized. Emergency measures are needed now to 
stop the war, because violence in Bosnia grows with each passing 
day, ethnic cleansing continues. Procrastination on the part of 
the international community results in continuation of violence, 
he added. 
  It is extremely important that Russia plays a great role in 
stopping the war in Bosnia, Owen stressed. 
  If the belligerents reach a ceasefire in Bosnia, the Russian 
parliament will be advised to consider increasing the number of 
the Russian peace-keepers stationed in Bosnia as a part of the 
UN Protection Force, Churkin said in this connection. 
  Churkin and Owen met with Norwegian Foreign Minister Tore 
Godal, who fully supported the idea of holding the meeting 
between foreign ministers of "the leading countries" with a view 
to settling crisis in Bosnia.

  [Text] We have just this minute received some information 
from the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry. It says: By 
continuing to play an active role in settling the situation in 
former Yugoslavia, Russian diplomacy, along with its five 
partners in Yugoslavia -- Russia, Great Britain, Spain, the 
United States, and France -- enabled important progress to be 
made in strengthening the safe havens regime in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The Security Council has proposed that the UN secretary 
general come forward with concrete recommendations on this issue 
by 10 May. The UN Secretariat has assured the Russian 
representative that the Russian proposals put forward earlier on 
this will be taken into account when these recommendations are 
being worked out, in addition to the information in the letter 
from the Security Council chairman. 
  It is the unanimous view of the sides looking for a 
settlement that the strengthening of the safe havens regime will 
push forward significantly settlement of the main tasks today, 
being tackled by the Russian, the United States, EC, and the UN 
contact group. These are to achieve an end to all military 
activity and bring the conflicting sides back to the negotiating 
table. 
  This information is from the Russian Foreign Ministry.

"Finland-NATO: There Should Be No Hurry Over Joining"] 
  [Text] Helsinki -- In connection with the process of talks 
on Finland joining the European Union, the signing of 
Partnership for Peace treaties with NATO by a number of 
countries in East Europe, including the CIS, and statements on 
the possible conclusion of a similar document in Helsinki by 
Russia in the very near future, high-ranking military figures 
are increasingly frequently expressing their attitude to the 
consequences for the country's defense policy. 
  At a seminar held at the end of March, Lieutenant General 
Matti Kopra, chief of the Finnish Defense Forces General Staff 
Operations Directorate, for example, urged the Finns to be 
cautious when assessing and implementing decisions in the sphere 
of defense policy. "We should be in no hurry to become members 
of any military alliances," he said. "Our country now has more 
options in the sphere of security policy than at any time in its 
history. They must all be weighed up cautiously and unhurriedly." 
  The general also warned against adopting decisions in the 
defense sphere on the basis of "suddenly emerging notions of an 
external threat to Finland." "Our defensive system," he pointed 
out, "is a result of long-term planning and cannot be altered 
substantially in the space of a few years." 
  Academician Pekka Jauho, who studies these so-called notions 
of a threat, pointed out at the seminar that Finland's military 
position is being consistently complicated as a result of the 
changes in Europe. He voiced doubt that the country's security 
can be ensured with the help of any collective system in the 
event of a serious crisis. 
  Researcher Juha Martelius, who reported on Russia's new 
military doctrine, believes that the Russian Federation is 
concerned about the threat of NATO expanding to the borders of 
its immediate neighbors, as well as the worsening situation 
concerning the political and economic rights of Russia's 
citizens in the "near abroad." He believes that, at worst, 
Russia might consider Finland also to be part of the "near 
abroad." Second, "the self-organization of ethnic minorities of 
Russians and of Finns who have come here from St. Petersburg and 
the oblast to take up permanent residence has now become 
apparent in Finland, as a result of which not only a hotbed of 
social tension but also a security risk might arise in time." 
(Martelius is an expert on Russian affairs in the secret -- 
political -- police.) 
  One more question concerning Russia. Attention was attracted 
at the end of March by a statement by Lt. Gen. Lass Vekhter 
[name as transliterated], deputy commander of the Northern 
Military District, who was once military adjutant to President 
Urho Kekkonen. For security reasons he objects to the planned 
construction of a highway from Salla in northern Finland to 
Alakurtti in Murmansk Oblast. A Russian air unit is stationed 
in the latter population center. But the civilian authorities 
in the northern provinces of Oulu and Lappi adhere to a 
different opinion, considering this road beneficial to the 
economic development of both countries. 
  Martti Ahtisaari, Finland's new president, recently gave his 
first news conference after taking up his post. He reported 
that Finland's Partnership for Peace treaty with NATO might be 
concluded this spring. But the time of signing will not depend 
on the corresponding schedules of neighboring countries -- 
Sweden and Russia. There is no hurry here, the president said.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, chairman of the Liberal </F>
Democratic Party of Russia: "My Plans for Germany"] 
  [Text] When I read what some German publications and 
politicians say about me, the following strikes me first and 
foremost: I am accused of directly interfering in internal 
German affairs. That is why I even received an "entry ban" for 
a time, as if I were a worse sort of person than mafia bosses 
and drug dealers from other countries who are evidently viewed 
by certain forces as providing a valuable contribution to social 
life, people from whom one does not have to be cut off in the 
same way as one has to be cut off from me. 
  So I find it difficult not to write in a satirical vein 
about 
some German decisionmakers who emphasize national sovereignty 
vis-a-vis Russia and myself on the one hand, and even conduct a 
form of verbal gunboat policy, while on the other hand, they 
bitterly fight any sign of national self-awareness on the part 
of the German people, and want to give up every last trace of 
German national independence vis-a-vis the Western powers, that 
is to say, they are prepared to kowtow to foreign countries in a 
way that I find incomprehensible. 
<H5>  Against Any Kind of Interference </H5>
  Second, the uproar about my supposed interference in German 
affairs is being fanned by media that do not shrink from playing 
the part of guardian and censor of the Russian nation. It is 
certainly of no benefit to Russo-German relations to condemn 
what has been decided by the Russian people, who have placed the 
greatest degree of trust in my party and in myself. Since the 
parliamentary elections last December, which saw my party become 
the strongest political force, irresponsible media demagogues in 
the FRG have interfered in Russia's internal affairs in an 
insolent manner on numerous occasions. In any event, it would 
not occur to me to attack the chairman of the strongest 
political force in Germany in the offensive manner that I have 
had to accept from certain gentlemen in Germany for months now. 
At the same time, I cannot imagine that they speak for the 
majority of the German people, who, I assume, deeply desire 
Russo-German reconciliation and accept the democratic decision 
made by the citizens of my country. 
  Third, the charge of interfering in Germany's internal 
affairs leveled against me is factually inaccurate. How the 
Germans deal with their internal affairs is solely a matter for 
the Germans. We Russians urgently request that there be an end 
to telling us what to do. As a Russian politician, I have 
enough to do without having to worry about Germany's internal 
affairs. 
<H5>  There Are More Options </H5>
  However, as a Russian politician, I do feel responsible for 
Russo-German relations, if only because bilateral relations with 
the strongest economic power in Europe are of substantial 
interest to us, and because I have arrived at the following 
conclusion, having studied the history of both our peoples: The 
outcome for both my nation and for the Germans was always bad 
when we opposed each other or even used force against each 
other. By contrast, close cooperation has always a blessing for 
both nations. With this in mind, I have made a series of 
suggestions about the future form of Russo-German cooperation. 
  I do not want to tell the Germans what to do. Germany may 
like my suggestions or it may reject them. It is for Germany to 
decide freely and independently whether it wants to accept the 
hand that I have extended in friendship or not. That is 
because, despite being familiar with the mutual advantages that 
good Russo-German relations yield, there are also other options 
for my country, which is the largest state in the world. I 
would like to play the German card should I become president. 
However, I cannot continually explain to people in Russia why I 
am offering the Germans trump cards, when the answer that I 
always receive from there is a rejection. 
<H5>  More German Than the Germans? </H5>
  I would like mention some instances of hypocrisy: I am 
continually being attacked by certain German forces, and the 
more I offer the Germans, the more I am condemned (when I put 
forward the solution to the question of Koenigsberg, one that 
was based on agreement, there was an enormous outcry in the 
German media!), and then there is outrage when I -- out of a 
feeling of responsibility for my country -- test various 
possible options for foreign relations. I ask of the Germans 
that they understand that, despite my great affection for that 
great people in the heart of Europe, I am a Russian and a 
Russian politician first and foremost. To expect me to be more 
German than the Germans is, to put it mildly, completely 
unrealistic. The fact that many Germans view the world through 
foreign eyes does not mean that one can conclude that this 
illness is widespread outside the borders of the FRG. 
  In print runs that are probably larger than those of the 
Grimm Brothers' fairy tales -- incidentally, I value their works 
very much for reviving German national consciousness at a time 
when the nation was being forgotten, and their stories are much 
loved in Russia -- it is being said in Germany that I want to 
destroy the FRG with nuclear weapons, and without batting an 
eyelid, this accusation is often made in the same breath as the 
assertion that I, as a kind of "junior partner," want to seek 
world domination along with the Germans. It would, of course, 
be "logical" that I should want to turn the Germans into 
millions of skeletons first of all and then, in a joint 
formation with those skeletons, seek to conquer the world. It 
is also just as "logical" that, while maintaining a friendship 
with Dr. Frey, whose person and policies stand for a strong 
Germany, who, in accordance with the national anthem, loves 
"Germany above all else," I should want to kill the German 
people. 
  Both of these assertions are total nonsense. Both my 
supposed intention to want to destroy Germany with nuclear 
weapons as well as my supposed desire to achieve Russo-German 
domination over the world. 
<H5>  The Recipe Is Understanding </H5>
  It is true that in the event that I become president, if 
need 
be, I would not hesitate to use all the weapons available in my 
country against an aggressor, regardless of where he should 
happen to come from. Over decades, it has been sought to 
impress upon the Germans that nuclear deterrence against a 
potential aggressor represented the highest degree of wisdom in 
statesmanship. I am surprised that I am now supposed to be the 
big bad wolf in the world, because I am following the deterrence 
doctrine of the Western powers in general, and West Germany in 
particular. Whoever wishes us no evil can sleep in peace. 
However, we do indeed want to cause fear among those who are 
hoping to be able to carve up my country into pieces and to 
condemn it to slavery. 
  As for wishing to dominate the world, in the event that I 
become president, I would be far from inclined to copy the U.S. 
head of state, who, on assuming office -- like his predecessors 
-- literally laid claim to "leadership of the world" for his 
state. In no hemisphere other than its own do I want Russia to 
play the first violin -- in what is hopefully a peaceful concert 
-- accorded to Russia by history and power. 
  Despite all the attempts at sabotage made by irresponsible 
circles, I am firmly convinced that in the long-term, those 
forces that support Russo-German understanding, Russo-German 
cooperation, will gain the upper hand. The Germans will not 
fail to seize the opportunity when it arises, to quote Bismarck, 
whom I deeply admire.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Asia" program] </F>
  [Text] The DPRK Foreign Ministry issued a statement on 28 
April. In the statement, Pyongyang proposed to the United 
States that they hold talks in the near future to discuss 
signing a peace treaty for establishing a peace-guaranteeing 
system that will substitute the present Armistice Agreement 
between the two countries. 
  Regarding this, station commentator (Srikov) writes: 
  The Korean Armistice Agreement signed some 40 years ago is 
still valid. On 8 July 1953, the agreement was signed on the 
Korean peninsula. The war seemed to have ended, but it still 
continues today. The most bloody war ghost [kajang yuhyolchogin 
chonjaeng yuryong] ever since the days of World War II is 
wandering there. 
  The DPRK Foreign Ministry's statement noted that the current 
situation of the Korean peninsula and the entire world requires 
the replacement of the present Armistice Agreement with a peace 
treaty between Pyongyang and Washington. 
  We cannot help but agree to this. An armistice is different 
from durable peace. The present situation, which poses a danger 
of war in Korea, cannot be regarded as a normal situation. A 
military conflict [kunsajok punjaeng] can take place at any 
point, and it would not be limited to the Korean peninsula as it 
was not some 50 years ago. Therefore, we can totally welcome 
the DPRK proposal for replacing the armistice in Korea with real 
peace. 
  However, there are many obstacles to overcome in the course 
toward peace. 
  The commentator continues: 
  The United States said that it reacted negatively to this 
proposal because the so-called nuclear plan of the DPRK was not 
clear. (Williams), a spokesman for the U.S. Department of 
State, said that the Washington-Pyongyang talks can be resumed 
only when it becomes possible for the International Atomic 
Energy Agency's inspection team to conduct a close inspection of 
all nuclear facilities in the DPRK. 
  Pyongyang is also insisting on holding direct talks with 
Washington, excluding the ROK. 
  Of course, the need to replace the armistice with real peace 
in Korea has been (?discussed) since long ago because the 
replacement of the Armistice Agreement with a peace treaty would 
resolve a big issue in the world.

  [Text] A Russian Government official has denied media 
reports that Russian Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets, 
during his recent visit to Syria, had discussed writing off part 
of that country's debt to Russia. 
  The matter was not brought up at all at the Damascus talks, 
Sergey Sidorkov, head of the Russian Government's Department for 
Defense Industries and Defense Conversion, who accompanied 
Soskovets on his Syrian trip, told INTERFAX. Moreover, Syria 
agreed to pay for its orders to Russian enterprises in advance, 
he said. But all such matters -- the volume of, and schedules 
for, supplies to Syria, including those of spares for armaments 
already sold to Damascus, payment procedures, etc., -- will be 
handled by a special intergovernmental commission, he said. 
  Sidorkov said no concrete plans for Russian arms sales to 
Syria had been negotiated during Soskovets's visit. 
  The bulk of Syria's $10-billion debt to Russia is in arrears 
for weapons bought from the Soviet Union in the 1970's and 
1980's. Syria is willing to pay the debt to Russia as the 
Soviet Union's legal successor.

  [Text] Vladivostok 29 April TASS -- Russia and Japan 
decided to build facilities in the Maritime Territory to store 
and utilise liquid radioactive waste. The decision was taken as 
a result of work by a Russian-Japanese intergovernment 
commission on settling one of the most pressing far eastern 
problems: storage and processing of liquid radioactive waste in 
the Maritime Territory. 
  Commission Member Yevgeniy Stomatyuk, chairman of the 
territorial committee on natural resources, told a news 
conference in Vladivostok on Friday that the two sides reached 
agreement to build a mobile facility in Japan in the near future. 
  It will store liquid radioactive waste from Russian 
nuclear-powered submarines till a stationary system for 
utilising waste is built. 
  The final discussion of the two projects will be held in 
Moscow and Tokyo at the top level. Their bilateral 
implementation will start in the latter part of May.

<F P=106> [Text of the statement of Azerbaijan Republic President H.A. </F>
Aliyev at the meeting of the CIS Council of Heads of State, in 
Moscow, 15 April 1994] 
  [Text] Extraordinary circumstances compel me to address 
you with the following statement. 
  On 10 April of this year, the armed forces of the Republic 
of 
Armenia began a new large-scale offensive in the direction of 
Geranboyskiy and Terterskiy Rayons, and on 11 April, in the 
direction of Agderinskiy and Agdamskiy Rayons of the Republic of 
Azerbaijan. Right now Azerbaijani units, repelling continuous 
attacks by the numerically superior units of the Republic of 
Armenia's armed forces, are conducting bloody defensive battles. 
A military contingent of about 3,000 troops has been transferred 
from the territory of Armenia into the zone of conflict, 
together with tens of units of armored vehicles and heavy 
artillery--including Grad systems--which are shelling populated 
centers of the aforementioned rayons of Azerbaijan. These 
villages have been ravaged, and there are numerous casualties 
among civilian population. 
  Thus, the Republic of Armenia, continuing its war of 
aggression on the territory of Azerbaijan, encroaches on the 
independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of the 
Azerbaijan Republic, threatening the very statehood of 
Azerbaijan. 
  By continuing its aggression, Armenia is blocking the 
process 
of peaceful settlement, in which Azerbaijan takes a most active 
part. By carrying out another offensive every time we are in the 
middle of or on the threshold of major mediating initiatives, 
the aggressor cynically defies the world community, which is 
undertaking--alas, unsuccessfully at this point--attempts to 
resolve this bloody conflict. 
  [Lines missing] a new stage of aggression by the Republic of 
Armenia, the purpose of which is to seize new Azerbaijani 
territories. Despite numerous declarations of a desire to 
resolve the conflict peacefully. By its latest offensive deep 
into the territory of a sovereign state--a CIS member--the 
Republic of Armenia demonstrates its true intentions, which are 
to put pressure on Azerbaijan and its leadership and block the 
peace process. 
  I want to particularly draw your attention to the fact that 
the Armenian armed forces' offensive began a day before the 
opening on 11 April of this year of a meeting of the CSCE's 
Minsk Group in Prague, with the participation, among others, of 
representatives of Azerbaijan and Armenia. 
  Escalation of aggression against Azerbaijan by the Republic 
of Armenia is taking place during the time of holding intensive 
negotiations within the framework of the Russian mediation 
initiative and at the time of the current meeting of CIS heads 
of states. 
  One has to admit that after the conference of CIS heads of 
States in Ashgabat in December 1993, when a meeting took place 
between Armenian President L. Ter-Petrosyan and myself, there 
have been no positive changes in the Republic of Armenia's 
policy regarding Azerbaijan Republic. Armenian armed forces 
continue to occupy more than 20 percent of Azerbaijan's 
territory and to conduct ethnic cleansing; people are dying, and 
a million Azerbaijani refugees huddled in tent cities experience 
unbelievable deprivation and suffering. 
  I want to point out that Azerbaijan took a most active part 
in all mediating efforts of the world community, including that 
by international organizations and great powers. These efforts 
include, in addition to my negotiations with the president of 
Armenia, the 18 February 1994 meeting of ministers of defense of 
Azerbaijan, Armenia, and the Russian Federation; a visit to 
Azerbaijan and Armenia of the Jan Eliasson, chairman of the 
CSCE's Minsk Group, in March 1994; the meeting of the speakers 
of the Azerbaijani and Armenian parliaments on 12 March of this 
year; negotiations in Baku and Moscow with V.N. Kazimirov, the 
special representative of the president of the Russian 
Federation; and the visit of a peacekeeping group of the CIS 
Interparliamentary Assembly in March of this year. However, all 
attempts on the part of Azerbaijan to find a mutually acceptable 
compromise solution have run into a coercive position by Armenia. 
  The Republic of Armenia torpedoes any constructive proposals 
by putting forward the terms it knows full well to be 
unacceptable. Their substance is that the Republic of Armenia, 
which has created a military beachhead on the territory of 
Azerbaijan, wants to trade occupied territories for independent 
state status for Nagornyy Karabakh, that is, to de facto 
dismember Azerbaijani Republic. 
  Azerbaijan's rightful position is to free all occupied 
territories and to restore its sovereignty; return refugees to 
places of their permanent residence and liquidate the 
consequences of Republic of Armenia's aggression. Azerbaijan 
does not want war and calls on Armenia to achieve peace on the 
basis of commonly accepted principles of mutual relations 
between sovereign states. Striving for civic peace and accord, 
the Azerbaijani Government is ready to guarantee the safety and 
civil rights of Armenian residents of the Nagornyy Karabakh 
region on the condition that they obey Azerbaijan's Constitution. 
  As you may remember, in Ashgabat Azerbaijan proposed to work 
out a system of bilateral and multilateral agreements aimed at 
stabilization of the political situation in the CIS states and 
ensuring mutual recognition and respect for the sovereignty, 
territorial integrity, and inviolability of borders of each CIS 
member state. 
  I am compelled to speak of this once again because life 
shows 
us that the indifferent attitude to the glaring fact of one 
member of the CIS--the Republic of Armenia--committing naked 
aggression against another CIS member--the Republic of 
Azerbaijan--practically brings to zero the prospects of forming 
a vital international 
organization, which we would like our Commonwealth to be. 
  I would like to urge you to discuss at this meeting the 
issue 
of Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict for the purpose of adopting 
concrete decisions for removing the aggression against the 
Azerbaijan Republic and its consequences. 
  In this address to the heads of states, we once again 
urgently call for: 
  --issuing a political judgment on the Republic of Armenia's 
aggression against the Azerbaijan Republic; 
  --demand that the Republic of Armenia cease military 
operations against Azerbaijan Republic and immediately, 
unconditionally, and without reserve withdraw its armed forces 
from the territory of sovereign Azerbaijan; 
  --demand from the Republic of Armenia firm political 
guarantees for not resuming military operations; 
  --apply sanctions with respect to the CIS member--the 
Republic of Armenia--that is carrying out armed aggression 
against another CIS member. 
  Further delay and inaction hold the threat of far greater 
trouble for all CIS states.

<F P=106> [Text of the statement of the CIS Council of Heads of State </F>
on the conflict in Nagornyy Karabakh and surrounding territories] 
  [Text] Taking into consideration the statements of heads 
of state of the Republic of Azerbaijan and the Republic of 
Armenia on the steps being undertaken by them with respect to 
cessation of military operations, the CIS Council of Heads of 
State acknowledges that the Nagornyy Karabakh conflict is 
causing irreparable losses to the Azerbaijani and Armenian 
peoples and to the economy and ecology of a large region in the 
Transcaucasus, and that it affects vital interests of other CIS 
members and the Commonwealth as a whole. 
  The CIS Council of Heads of States supports the efforts of 
Commonwealth member states aimed at a lasting political 
settlement of the conflict, including persistent peacekeeping 
initiatives by the Russian Federation, and welcomes the 
mediating mission of the Interparliamentary Assembly of the CIS 
member countries. 
  The CIS Council of Heads of States reaffirms its desire to 
facilitate in every way a search for the only 
possible--compromise--solution. The main priority and imperative 
for the settlement is an immediate cease-fire, an end to all 
military operations and following that, its firm reinforcement. 
Without this, we cannot proceed to eliminate the consequences of 
the tragic conflict. 
  The CIS Council of Heads of States calls on the 
international 
community, the CSCE, and the United Nations to support the steps 
being undertaken by the CIS in the interests of settling the 
conflict.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow 30 April TASS -- One of the topics of the 
Moscow press on Saturday is celebration of the May Day in 
Moscow. "By all indications, organisers of oppositional 
manifestations are well aware that something more formidable 
than water hose can be used against demonstrators, and without 
any delay and hesitation," NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA writes. Although 
the mayor of Moscow talks about "contact-free" methods of 
dispersing manifestations, Deputy Chief of Agency of Moscow 
Militia Gennadiy Feklichev says that public order in Moscow on 
the May Day will be maintained by militia. A few days ago, 
soldiers of interior troops were trained in methods of 
dispersing demonstrations. Armoured equipment was present 
during the training. 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI carries a statement by Moscow Mayor Yuriy 
Luzhkov who warns: "We are ready to cope with any changes of the 
situation in the capital. Sufficient measures will be taken and 
force used against those who want to clowd our holyday and 
violate law." 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries an interview with Patriarch 
Alexey the Second of Moscow and all Russia. He said, 
specifically: "I believe that those who call us to the 
barricades, to separate tanks and the parliament house think in 
their mundane ways." 
  NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA frontpages an item in which it 
is 
alleged that "the Interior Ministry recommended, after 
conversations with personnel, to select no less than 250 men to 
be sent, plain-clothed, to the site of mass actions in the 
Kaluzhskaya square. The newspaper notes that the Interior 
Ministry's directive suggests that these persons be inculcated 
among demonstrators to provoke disturbances. The newspaper 
asserts that sergeants will be paid for these services $250 and 
more, and officers even as much as $500. 
  A number of newspapers carry interviews with Mikhail 
Shmakov, 
chairman of the Russian Federation of Independent Trade Unions. 
In an interview granted to TRUD he said that "the problem of 
peace in society equally concerns all the population of the 
country. Our state pays too dearly for strife on the political 
Olympus. Therefore, trade unions support the president's idea to 
press for overcoming the crisis in all areas in Russia on a 
basis of civic accord." In an interview with RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA 
Shmakov touched upon the socioeconomic situation in work 
collectives. He stressed that "the situation is desperate". 
Plants are stopped. Even such giants as the Likhachev auto 
works, the Volga auto works and the Gorkiy car factory may face 
this calamity." In an interview to PRAVDA Shmakov stated that 
trade unions at present are not rigidly oriented at any one 
party. "There is no party as yet that would fully correspond to 
trade union tasks. But we support parties and movements whose 
programmes contain ideas similar to ours." 
  Regarding the meeting of the Latvian and Russian presidents 
planned for today, NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA writes that 
"coordinations are being made in the hours that remain to go 
before the presidential meeting. `Telephone diplomacy' on which 
Russia and Latvia have been heavily relying in the recent days 
is a way to resolve matters of principle but not particulars 
which, in the long run, determine the climate of bilateral 
relations." 
  The same newspaper carries an interview with Anatoliy 
Kuntsevich, former chairman of the committee on conventional 
problems of chemical and biological weapons at the Russian 
president. He said "it is unrealistic to expect that any 
subject of the Federation would voluntarily accept chemical 
ammunition for destruction in their territory. Hardly any 
subject of the Federation will so much as permit the 
transportation of chemical ammunition over their territory. 
Therefore a system for weapons elimination in areas of their 
storage should be created. National unity is essential. All 
other subjects of the Federation should not remain indifferent 
observers as the timeframe for safe storage of chemical weapons 
is running out." 
  The newspaper SEGODNYA touches upon the case of U.S. spy 
Ames. In this connection the newspaper writes that the 
possibility of the exchange of arrested agents of the U.S. and 
Russia should not be ruled out. Some experts say that potential 
candidatures for bargaining are former Colonel of the main 
intelligence agency Baranov and former Major of the first main 
agency of the KGB, now the External Intelligence Service, 
Motorin. 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA carries an interview with chief of the 
Russian Armed Services Colonel-General Anatoliy Sitnov. He 
notes that if the defence budget is endorsed in its present form 
the Defence Ministry, repaying the debt for 1993 and for 
deliveries in 1994, will have to spend whatever funds are left 
on the ensurance of nuclear safety, preservation of ships and 
vessels of the navy now being built or repared and to finance 
work for maintenance of armements and military equipment. The 
agreements on the supply of all other armaments and military 
equipment commissioned by the state (over 80 per cent) will have 
to be disolved, with catastrophic consequences. 
  The newspaper NEVSKOYE VREMYA reports that the unfavourable 
ecological situation in the Gulf of Finland will be the main 
cause of the spread of algae in the gulf in summer. The 
situation is aggravated by the unusually large influx to the 
Baltic Sea of saline waters from the north Atlantic and the lack 
of oxygen in benthic layers.

  [Text] Yerevan, 1 May--May Day was marked in Armenia for 
the first time in several years. The central rally was held in 
Yerevan under the flags of the USSR and the Armenian Soviet 
Socialist Republic and with the portraits of Lenin. According 
to various estimates, from 10,000 to 60,000 people took part in 
it. They gathered on the square in front of the opera theater 
under the slogans: "A New Union With Russia is the Only 
Salvation for Armenia" and "No to Capital". Sergey Badalyan, 
the leader of the Armenian Communist Party, called for early 
presidential and parliamentary elections in Armenia and for 
Armenia to join the ruble zone. He expressed solidarity with 
the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, having said that 
"Zyuganov's party fully controls the political situation in 
Russia today."

<F P=106> [News department report: "Levon Ter-Petrosyan: `Constitution </F>
Is an Accord'"] 
  [Text] Armenian Republic President L. Ter-Petrosyan spoke 
yesterday in the parliament. The nation's existence--this is 
what national accord means, said the president. The nation has 
always been united by common concerns, customs, ideas of the 
future. Disagreements, on the other hand, existed between 
political forces. Nor does Levon Ter-Petrosyan recognize such a 
notion as national ideology. In his opinion, in a democratic 
society it is impossible to unite democracy around one idea, 
since the final outcome may be fascism, as world experience has 
proven. Armenia must have a national program of democratization 
and development that, in addition to traits mentioned in its 
title, must be universal and humanitarian. 
  "A constitution is an accord! All citizens, as well as 
different political forces in Armenia, must obey it," said 
Ter-Petrosyan. 
  The president believes that a referendum is the most 
effective way to adopt the basic law. He expressed certainty 
that the Armenian people will adopt their constitution and thus 
remove tension in the sociopolitical life of the country. The 
president said once again that a violent change of 
authority--the way it had happened in Azerbaijan, Georgia, and 
Tajikistan--is impossible in Armenia. Further on L. 
Ter-Petrosyan proposed his plan for pulling out of the crisis. 
First: The parliament expresses confidence in either the 
Constitutional Commission's draft or the draft of "the six" and 
without discussion votes on submitting one of the drafts to a 
referendum vote. Second: If this does not happen, both drafts 
are put to a referendum and then a second round of the 
referendum may be needed. Third: In the event the draft of six 
parties passes, the president and the government resign. Fourth: 
If the Constitutional Commission's draft passes, new elections 
for president and National Assembly are held. And fifth: Before 
this session ends, the parliament must adopt a law on Armenian 
Republic citizenship and elections to the republic's National 
Assembly.

  [Text] Paris April 30 TASS -- France is ready to promote

Armenian and the Azeri sides wish so. French Foreign Minister 
Alain Juppe said this here on Friday during a meeting with his

always been in favour of solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh 
conflict in the framework of the Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). 
  The ministers noted with satisfaction that there are no 
contradictions in Franco-Armenian bilateral relations. Juppe 
confirmed that the draft law envisaging the ratification of the

<F P=106> [From the Press Digest: YERKIR, 29 April edition: "Protest </F>
Against the Russian-Turkish Agreement"] 
  [Text] Today's "Yerkir" newspaper inserts a declaration the 
"Kurdistan" Committee and the Council of Kurd intelligentsia of 
Armenia made to express the anxiety on the occasion of the 
Russian-Turkish military agreement concluded last week. 
According to the agreement, Russia sells weapon to Turkey. 
  The declaration says, "This bargain was arranged when 
Germany, a NATO partner of Turkey, made up its mind to stop 
weapons delivery to Turkey because these weapons are being 
finally used against the civil population of Kurdistan. 
  In the opinion of the authors of the declaration, Turkey 
uses 
these weapons not only against the Kurds but also will threaten 
Armenia -- a member of the CIS, a state which participates in 
the Collective Security Treaty. 
  The declaration also mentions that these weapons will be 
delivered by Turkey to Azerbaijan to be used against the civil 
people of Karabakh. This bargain is aimed not only against the 
people of Kurdistan fighting for freedom and independence but 
also against the interests of Russia and its CIS partners. 
  The "Kurdistan" Committee and the Council of Kurd 
intelligentsia appeals to the deputies of the State Duma of 
Russia, social and political organizations, all the people of 
Russia raise their voice against such bargains.

  [Text] Baku, April 29 (TURAN)--As was earlier reported, on 
April 26 the leader of the Azeri Parliament, Rasul Guliyev, and 
Russian Defense Minister, Pavel Grachev, had discussed 
military-strategic cooperation between the two countries. 
  They agreed on the usage of a radio-transmitting station 
located in the Gabala region of Azerbaijan. 
  The discussions were over the status of the station and the 
number of hours of broadcasting. Discussions have been ongoing 
since 1993. 
  Moscow's TURAN's correspondent was told by Russian military 
sources that during the talks Rasul Guliyev agreed to lease the 
station to the Russian Defense Ministry. 
  The Russian Defense Minister said that in the near future 
Azerbaijan's and Russia's governments will ratify the document 
concerning the functioning of the Gabala radio-transmitting 
station. Sources from the Russian Defense Ministry report that 
the station will be assigned the status equivalent of a Russian 
military base on the territory of Azerbaijan. 
  The Gabala station was built in the mid-1980's within the 
framework of the Soviet-version of S.D.I. (Strategic Defense 
Initiative). 
  The station provides for the capability to establish a fixed 
launching of intercontinental ballistic missiles or any other 
objects in the southern sector of the globe. 
  According to Russian military experts, the Gabala station is 
the most needed station in anti-aircraft programmes of the 
former Soviet Union, and now Russia. 
  As was learned earlier, in the past, Russian Defense 
Minister 
Grachev announced his intention to station 5 military bases in 
the Caucasus, three in Georgia, one in Armenia and one in 
Azerbaijan.

  [Text] Baku, April 29 (TURAN)--US President Clinton said 
that he will annul the amendment of the US Congress to the 
"Freedom Support Act". At present, according to the amendment, 
it bans the use of US governmental assistance to Azerbaijan. 
  This ban also restricts assistance vis-a-vis projects 
addressing peaceful settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani 
conflict. "The solving of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict 
within the CSCE Minsk Group framework is the best way to annul" 
the Freedom Support Act, said the President. 
  In his reply to President Aliyev, the US President said that 
he opposes such restrictions since they limit the activity of 
the United States that is aimed at the support of reform and the 
peaceful settlement of the Karabakh conflict. 
  President Clinton said that transport communications 
following the Armenia-Nakhichevan route must be unblocked so as 
to deliver humanitarian assistance to the peaceful population in 
that region. 
  The letter also contained an announcement about the newly 
appointed US representative to the CSCE Minsk Group, Joseph 
Prescelli, who, according to the US President, will "closely 
cooperate with representatives of Azerbaijan, Armenia, Russia 
and other states to put an end to the war by diplomatic means". 
  The US President assessed President Aliyev's adherence to 
settle the conflict within the framework of the Minsk Group and 
expressed hope that it will establish close cooperation to 
achieve peace. 
  The amendments to the "Freedom Support Act", which also 
includes a ban on humanitarian assistance delivery from US 
governmental agencies to Azerbaijani governmental entities, was 
adopted by the US Congress in October 1992. 
  In March 1994 Azerbaijan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent 
a 
letter to the US Senate, in which it asked for an annulment due 
to difficult situation of Azeri refugees.

  [Text] In recent days some provocateurs and press organs 
are claiming that the interethnic relations in our republic's 
northern region have again become aggravated. Our colleague 
Gulsefa Ahmedova interviewed Deputy Chairman of the Supreme 
Soviet Afiaddin Dzhalilov. 
  [Begin Dzhalilov recording] I believe that these are mere 
rumors and are provocative in nature. With a group of 
parliamentarians we visited [word indistinct] (?Siazen), 
Khachmasskiy, Kubanskiy, and Kusarskiy Rayons in recent days. 
We met the local inhabitants. Of course we also met with the 
Lezghins living in Kusarkiy. I can state unequivocally that the 
Lezghin people and all the peoples living in that region are 
involved in Azerbaijan's life, are doing everything for the 
speedy resolution of the Karabakh problem, and the Azerbaijani 
and Lezghin peoples, who have lived and created together in that 
same place, are sparing nothing in this grave historic, 
political, military, and economic period for Azerbaijan. The 
conclusion at these meetings was that human rights in Azerbaijan 
are being protected, every suitable condition is being created 
for national minorities, and the national minorities in 
Azerbaijan, including the Russian community, share Azerbaijani 
people's cares and are resolved to see a speedy end to this war 
and the Armenian aggression, and a peaceful resolution of the 
Karabakh problem. 
  In a word, I want to say that no matter if they are 
Lezghins, 
or Russians, or other ethnic minorities living in Azerbaijan, 
they state unequivocally in connection with our visit there that 
they support Azerbaijan President Geydar Aliyev's political 
activity. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Constituent Congress of Azerbaijan </F>
Democratic Property Owners Party"] 
  [Text] The Azerbaijan Democratic Property Owners Party 
[ADPOP] Constituent Congress was held on 23 April in the 
building of the Azerbaijan State Academic Theater of Opera and 
Ballet. Some 334 delegates elected from 23 districts and cities 
of the republic and over 200 representatives of various 
ministries, organizations, embassies, local executive 
authorities, and private structures took part in the congress. 
  Prior to the election of the working bodies of the congress, 
Makhmud Mamedov, chairman of the organizing committee of the 
ADPOP, delivered the political report. 
  Those who spoke in the debate on the report: Mikail Zeynalov 
(Bilyasuvar), Ibragim Gasanov (Gyadabey), Fazil Dzhafarov 
(Agdzhabedi), Arif Akhundov (Astara), Rauf Zeynalov (Sumgayyt), 
Imam Mustafayev (Baku), Mikail Mirza (Baku), Amiraslan Gasymov 
(Sumgayyt), and others, expressed their opinions concerning the 
party's future activity and emergence from the situation that 
has taken shape in the republic. Proposals were expressed on the 
draft party program and rules, and they were supplemented. The 
program and rules of the Azerbaijan Democratic Property Owners 
Party were then adopted. 
  Sadykh Murtuzayev, member of the organizing committee, spoke 
in connection with the next item on the agenda--election of the 
chairman of the ADPOP. He observed that the party's successful 
activity would depend primarily on the moral, political, and 
professional qualities of its leader. He nominated Makhmud Nadir 
Mamedov ogly, chairman of the ADPOP organizing committee, for 
the position of party chairman. Makhmud Mamedov's candidacy was 
put to the vote, and he was unanimously elected ADPOP chairman. 
  The directive bodies--a 40-man party Supreme Assembly and an 
11-man Central Auditing Commission--were elected. The congress 
adopted a statement in connection with the current political and 
economic situation in the republic. This completed the business 
of the ADPOP Constituent Congress.

Russian Army Vardiko Nadibaidze to the post of Georgian minister

director of a group of Indian companies, and representatives of 
Georgian business circles. 
  The conversation touched upon issues of establishing and 
developing economic cooperation between Georgia and India. The

representation and an Indian-Georgian center for trade, culture, 
and friendship opened in India. The conversation also touched 
upon credits to be allotted as humanitarian aid, cooperation in 
the spheres of sea and air transport, as well as [word 
indistinct] and food production. 
  Shevardnadze thanked the visitors for the interest they 
demonstrated toward Georgia and said that relations between 
Georgia and India have centuries-long traditions. Prospects for 
the extension of the relations have now emerged.

  [Text] Georgia's Constitutional Commission worked out the 
draft of political and territorial system for the country, a 
member of the Commission told Interfax. The draft provides for 
dividing Georgia into 12 territories, Abkhazia and Ajaria among 
them, though with a special political status. This provision 
does not relate to South Ossetia. 
  In the meantime, as Interfax learned from reliable sources, 
the Georgian leadership is planning to hold talks with the 
present South Ossetian administration concerning the political 
status of that territory. On instructions from Eduard 
Shevardnadze a special group was formed to conduct these talks. 
The talks are to take place in mid May.

<F P=106> [Yuriy Simonyan report in the "Georgia" column: "Refugees </F>
Will Be Returning to Abkhazia Under UN Supervision. The Latest 
Session of the Quadripartite Commission"] 
  [Text] The second session of the quadripartite commission 
on the return of refugees and deported persons to Abkhazia was 
held in the Lazurnaya hotel in Sochi for two days. The 
commission includes representatives of Georgian and Abkhaz 
sides, the Russian Federation Foreign Affairs Ministry, and the 
Russian Federal Migration Service, as well as the office of the 
UN High Commissioner for Refugees. 
  The commission's first working meeting, which took place on 
8 
and 9 April, prepared a protocol in which the sides presented 
the main principles of their upcoming activities, but the 
document was signed only at the second meeting. The sides 
agreed that registration of refugees will be effected by the UN 
High Commissioner for Refugees mission, in collaboration with 
the regional authorities. It was decided to create an expert 
group that will work out questionnaires. The refugees will fill 
out these papers under the supervision of High Commissioner 
representatives. All the data about those willing to return to 
Abkhazia will be entered into the computer and stay at the 
disposal and under the control of the UN mission. The protocol 
stresses that all personal particulars may not be revealed. 
  The meeting heard a report by the UN mission on the results 
of its trip to areas of western Georgia and Galskiy Rayon in 
Abkhazia. 
  Expert groups were set up on legal matters, information 
support, and planning. A draft procedure for the registration 
of those who wish to return was considered. 
  A statement was adopted, stressing that the absence of 
peacekeeping forces in the zone of conflict hinders the return 
of the refugees. True, the sides' positions on this issue 
differ somewhat. The Abkhaz side continues to insist that 
peacekeeping forces should be introduced not on the entire 
territory but only along the line of confrontation between 
Georgian and Abkhaz forces, which passes along the Inguri river. 
Leonid Lakerbaya, first deputy chairman of the Abkhazia Council 
of Ministers, believes that only after this can the return of 
the refugees begin. The head of the Abkhaz delegation confirmed 
that the republic's Abkhaz population should be prepared for 
this process. 
  The session defined the agenda for the next meeting on 11 
May.

<F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report: "Georgia: Resolving the Fate of </F>
Refugees"] 
  [Text] Judging by many reports in the local press, the 
mechanism for returning refugees to their native regions and 
guarantees of their safety have become a bone of contention at 
the Georgian-Abkhazian talks which are being conducted with 
Russian mediation and under the auspices of the United Nations. 
Putting forward the Georgian plan to resolve these problems, 
Major General Vladimir Chikovani, commander of the republic's 
Internal Troops and member of the Georgian delegation at the 
Geneva talks, remarked in conversation with an ITAR-TASS 
correspondent that the Russian side is taking a constructive 
stance in Geneva and showing its committment to bringing peace 
to Abkhazia and resolving the fate of hundreds of thousands of 
civilians forcibly expelled from their native lands. The 
Georgian plan also met with the support of UN representatives at 
these talks. 
  The main thrust of the Georgian plan, the general said, is 
the need to monitor the withdrawal of all armed formations with 
their weapons and combat equipment from all the lines of active 
confrontation in the conflict zone and from all the regions of 
Abkhazia to which it is planned to return the refugees. 
  The Georgian plan is based exclusively on the principles and 
provisions of the quadrilateral agreements, and stems from the 
logic of the nonresumption of military operations and the 
termination of the conflict.

  [Text] Four Abkhazian servicemen have been killed and the 
same number wounded by Georgian saboteurs in the Gali District 
of Abkhazia in the morning of April 29, Interfax was told by 
Abkhazian Defense Minister Sultan Sosnaliyev. 
  He said that this was another act which flagrantly violated 
the documents on settlement in Abkhazia signed in Moscow on 
April 4 by representatives of the Abkhazian and Georgian sides 
with the mediation of the United Nations, the CSCE and Russia. 
  Sosnaliyev said that Abkhazian Army will have to retaliate 
to 
curb banditry of armed detachments sent by the Georgian side.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "NEGA Reports" rubric: </F>
"Georgia"] 
  [Text] On 28 April, the KOMUNISTI newspaper published an 
appeal by the Georgian Communist Workers Party [GCWP] Central 
Committee to the republic's citizens. The document points out 
that the desire of Georgian peoples to get rid of everything 
that is negative and "alien to a socialist way of life" has not 
been fulfilled. In the opinion of the document's authors, "by 
the ambitions of Georgia's national-liberation movement and with 
an active support from former communists, the country has been 
thrown back to feudalist fragmentation." Georgia, the document 
says, has become a beggar on an international scale, and its 
people, proud and happy in the not so distant past, are 
currently suffering from hunger and poverty. 
  The GCWP Central Committee thinks that the policy of denying 
any protection and depriving the population of the right to 
exist amounts to a downright genocide and extermination of one's 
own people. All this is the reason for an unrestrained outflow 
of the population, including Georgians, from the country. 
Georgia's true communists, the document says, do have a plan for 
overcoming the crisis. 
  "We are ready to assume responsibility for the fate of the 
country, but for this to be done we must become a party that has 
parliamentary seats" -- is how the party's immediate prospects 
are described. "By joint efforts, in an open dialogue let us 
expose the doings and true political faces of demagogues, idle 
talkers, and turncoats both within the parliament walls and 
outside them." 
  The GCWP Central Committee urged people to elect its 
representatives to official posts. So far it is hard to say 
what influence the GCWP may have on various sectors of the 
population, but the documents it has been issuing come to the 
attention of many people. In a number of Georgian regions 
former party activists are trying to resuscitate district and 
city organizations of the Georgian Communist Party.

<F P=106> [Interview with former Russian Vice President Aleksandr </F>
Rutskoy by Aleksandr Gerasimov, date and place not given -- from

  [Excerpts] [Gerasimov] Boris Yeltsin described the 
procedure for signing the Treaty on Public Accord as an assembly 
of civic accord. [passage omitted] 
  [Rutskoy] You see, everything that is taking place in our 
country today is the search for an enemy: Yet another 
[?document] is thought up, which should be signed and then an 
enemy should be found yet again, and so on and so forth. This 
is an agreement between President Yeltsin, Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, Head of Federation Council Vladimir Shumeyko, Head 
of State Duma Ivan Rybkin and the Patriarch. They will move to 
meet one another half way. All the other people who have signed 
are simply hostages to this system. 
  [Gerasimov] Currently the former vice-president is holding 
talks with different parties and public movements in order to 
set up a political organization which would (?make it possible 
to) start an election campaign for seats in the parliament and 
the post of president. 
  [Rutskoy] I intend to set up an all-Russian public and 
political movement. We have already found a formula for this 
movement by giving it the name of social-patriotic movement. We 
plan to have registered membership in the movement. The 
movement will have iron discipline and firm order. We do not 
need any dissent [inakomysliye] at all in the movement because 
we have already had relevant experience. Ultimately, the 
movement's goal is to come to power because without power it is 
simply impossible to implement the ideas and tasks which we have 
set to ourselves. [passage omitted]

  [Text] One of the communist party leaders Anatoliy 
Kryuchkov speaking at a rally in Moscow's Kalyzhskaya Square has 
backed up a proposal by chief of the Russian Communist Party 
Viktor Anpilov to hold a national strike on May 3rd to mark 
seven months since last October's parliamentary uprising. 
  For his part, leader of the Union of Communists Aleksey 
Prigarin called for next year's May Day celebrations to be held 
in a Soviet state. On last October's events, he said "the 
government neither wants nor is capable of leading the country 
out of crisis." He denied that the present regime had become 
stronger since. The regime is on the brink of an abyss and that 
is why it has started to talk about civil peace, Prigarin said. 
By contrast, he said, the opposition has built up its muscle 
though it is not strong enough yet to be able to lead most of 
the farmers, workers and intellectuals. 
  The rally involved prominent opposition leaders such as 
chairwoman of the former Soviet Union's parliamentary leadership 
Sazhi Umalatova, Ilya Konstantinov of the National Salvation 
Front, Communist Party leaders Gennadiy Zyuganov and Anatoliy 
Lukyanov, leader of the Russian National Union Sergey Baburin 
and chairman of the Union of Communist Parties Oleg Shenin. 
  As the marchers went along Leninskiy Prospect in 
southwestern 
Moscow, a man was spotted on the rooftop of an adjacent building 
throwing down anti-communist leaflets. 
  Police have begun searches for the man while the marchers 
tore apart the leaflets describing the action as provocation, 
our corespondent reports from the scene. 
  Earlier, similar leaflets were thrown down from the top of a 
building in Tverskaya Street during a demonstration arranged by 
the trade unions in Moscow. 
  The demonstrators marching along Leninskiy Prospect stopped 
close to Gagarin Square, the scene of last year's violent 
clashes between police and protesters, to keep a minute's 
silence in memory of the victims. Red flags were lowered and 
several flowers laid on the roadside. 
  Speaking over a loudspeaker, communist party leader Viktor 
Anpilov promised that "time will come when police will appear on 
city streets without truncheons or automatic guns, but this is 
impossible under the present regime." On his proposal, 
anti-Yeltsin slogans were chanted. 
  One of the leaders of the Working Russia Movement Vladimir 
Gusev called on the demonstrators to take a vow to the fallen 
opposition members that "we will defend our Soviet state" and 
win the cause that "our friends have died for." 
  Our correspondent says that none of the speakers mentioned 
that Vladimir Tolokneyev, member of riot police, was the only 
dead victim from last year's clashes. Leader of the National 
Salvation Front Ilya Konstantinov told our correspondent that 
although he mourned about all victims dying in violent clashes 
last May and October, "it must be realized that the opposition 
tried to defend itself." At the same time, he admitted that 
Tolokneyev's should have been mentioned.

  [Text] Leader of the Communist Party of the Russian 
Federation and member of Russian Parliament Gennadiy Zyuganov 
says he is opposed to the idea of a national political strike 
put forward by Viktor Anpilov, the leader of the Working Russia 
Movement. 
  In an interview with Interfax during a pro-communist rally 
at 
Vorobyev Hills in Moscow on Sunday, he pointed to widespread 
stoppages throughout the country. 
  Instead, he said, the question is one of massive political 
protest against government policies, but on a decision from a 
broad coalition of national-patriotic forces rather than any one 
party. 
  For his part, Anpilov in a speech to the earlier May Day 
rally in Kaluzhskaya Square had called to start preparations for 
a general political strike under the slogans of Down with the 
Government of Traitors! All power to the Workers! 
  Zyuganov did not elaborate on the shape of "massive 
political 
protest". However, he said it could take any form provided the 
decision making was collective and the action held at the right 
time. 
  He also wants this to be agreed with agrarians not to worsen 
the already adverse situation in the farming sector. 
  On the city administration's behavior during the event, 
Zyuganov described it as normal recommending the authorities not 
to train special police units on the eve of holidays but give 
them a rest and help workers arrange their demonstrations 
instead. 
  In his view, the next demonstration due on Victory Day on 
May 
9 would involve more people than last year when tens of 
thousands of protesters took part.

<F P=106> [Video report by A. Kondulukov; from the "Vesti" newscast] </F>
  [Excerpts] Today veterans of the Communist demonstrations 
and battles at Ostankino and the White House are marking May 
Day. Representatives of the Russian Communist Workers' Party and 
the liberal patriotic party Rebirth, as well as the All-Union 
Communist Bolshevik Party, Working Russia, the Komsomol, and 
generally all shades of the communist spectrum have gathered by 
the giant Lenin monument on Oktyabrskaya Square. [passage 
omitted] 
  The untiring propagandist Viktor Anpilov called on those 
assembled to prepare for a political strike and to join the 
ranks of the Russian Communist Workers' Party, which is already 
beginning to compile lists of people's presidential candidates. 
Every opposition candidate will have to make three basic 
promises: To abolish mayors, to legalize Soviet power, and to 
return to the people what has been stolen from them -- land, 
factories, and currency accounts. 
  [Begin Anpilov recording, addressing rally] We did not want 
a 
war in 1993. But we will fight on to eventual victory, and stop 
the hated regime that is carrying out the forcible 
capitalization of our country, comrades. [end recording] 
  Anpilov does not intend to adopt peaceful proposals. In his 
words, the main condition for civic peace is the resignation of 
Yeltsin and the capitalist government. 
  Yes, today the Communists are demanding a lot -- the 
cancellation of the results of the December referendum, a change 
of government, the elimination of the post of president, power 
for the Soviets, and the restoration of the Soviet Union. In 
order to achieve this, the Communists are determined to expand 
their ranks, and that is their main task today. As one of the 
Russian Communist Workers' Party leaders said, that means more 
leaflets, more words, and more propaganda work in factory shops 
and on the trolleybuses.

  [Text] Moscow May 1 TASS -- The orators at a meeting in the 
centre of Moscow sponsored by the Moscow Federation of Labour 
Unions demanded that the government pay up on its salary 
obligations, index salaries to the inflation rate, give state 
subsidies to the agricultural sector, get rid of unemployment, 
establish strict control over retail trade, and do much more. 
  As always happens with such demonstrators, there was no lack 
of anti-president and anti-government slogans. All the speakers 
finished their appearances with hurrahs for international 
workers' solidarity day. However, in contrast to previous 
years, there were no representatives of the international 
proletariat at the meeting. 
  The Moscow Federation of Labour Unions collected about ten 
thousand demonstrators for its march from Triumfalnaya (Triumph) 
Square to the Manezh just across from the Kremlin, which started 
at nine a.m. this morning. By the time the procession reached 
the meeting place, it had lost half its participants. Dominant 
were representatives from almost all the trade unions, the 
Communist Party of the Russian Federation, and guests from many 
Russian regions. 
  The meeting was over at 10:30, by which time the square had 
practically emptied.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Yekaterina Zhilyakova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 1 May -- Representatives of trade unions who 
held a festive rally in Manezh Square in the capital today on 
the occasion of the International Day of Solidarity of the 
Working People stated their readiness to defend the economic and 
social interests of the working people. 
  We are for accord and civic peace but not at the expense of 
the working people and not at the expense of depriving common 
people of their rights, Mikhail Nagaytsev, chairman of the 
Moscow Federation of Trade Unions [MFTU] said opening the rally. 
According to him, on the eve of May Day about 2.5 million 
people signed demands circulated by the MFTU, which will be 
passed to the government. Among them are demands to introduce 
articles to the legislation of the Russian Federation on the 
accountability of those guilty of delaying salary payments, to 
adopt a state employment program for the population, and to step 
up the work of law-enforcement bodies in the fight against crime 
and corruption. 
  A resolution adopted by the rally -- in which about 25,000 
people took part according to Nagaytsev -- notes that a solution 
to the present crisis, which is leading to the country's 
impoverishment, is possible only if the level of unemployment is 
halted, there is state support for Russia's producers, and 
tariff agreements are fulfilled. 
  War and labor veterans and members of the Russian Communist 
Party took part in the rally in Manezh Square together with 
representatives of 42 trade union organizations from Moscow city 
and oblast, St. Petersburg, Nizhniy Novgorod, Voronezh, 
Smolensk, Kostroma, Tula, Kaluga, and other towns.

  [Text] Moscow, 1 May (ITAR-TASS) -- The number of people 
participating in Mayday demonstrations in cities in the European 
part of Russia and in the Caucasus varied widely. In many 
places bad weather reduced the number of people wishing to 
demonstrate on the streets under red banners. The number of 
demonstrators in Novgorod amounted to no more than a thousand. 
In St. Petersburg there were two simultaneous rallies. The 
first was a rally of the Russian Communist Workers' Party 
together with the "Working Leningrad" movement. About 3000 
persons took part in it. Only a few dozens arrived to take part 
in the rally of the united independent trade unions. The 
procession in Yaroslavl was small. In Arkhangelsk, Kaliningrad, 
and Makhachkala there were no more than 150 people listening to 
the speakers, although it did not rain there. In Tver and 
Kaluga, Mayday was celebrated by up to 2000 citizens, mainly 
veterans. In Bryansk and Petrozavodsk, approximately 500 people 
took part in the rallies. In every case the main organizers 
were the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, the Russian 
Communist Workers' Party, the All-Union Communist Party, and 
all-Russia and local trade union organizations. 
  In Tula the largest rally for the last two years was held in 
the center of the town. Ulyanovsk and Voronezh were 
exceptional: In the first 10,000 people took part in the rally, 
in the second there was an exceptionally large number both of 
demonstrators and of organizers of the Mayday demonstrations. 
The latter included the Federation of Independent Trade Unions, 
the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, the trade union 
of small entrepreneurs "Solidarnost", the Russian Communist 
Workers' Party and the "Trudovoy Voronezh" [Working Voronezh] 
movement. 
  At the rallies, along with slogans about the reinstatement 
of 
the USSR and the transfer of power to the Soviets, there were 
demands to put an end to the economic chaos and chronic 
non-payments, to put an end to crime, unemployment, and the 
infringement of citizens' social guarantees. The demand for the 
Russian Government to resign and for a change in the course of 
the reforms was common to all the towns. In St. Petersburg, 
Yaroslavl and Kaliningrad the recently signed Treaty on Public 
Accord was criticized. At the rally in Voronezh, where various 
political forces presented a united front, a resolution was 
adopted which contained a number of radical demands addressed to 
the Russian president, the government and the Federal Assembly. 
The special feature of the St. Petersburg rallies was the 
unwillingness of the trade union organizers to have anything in 
common with the communist rally, a situation that almost led to 
a clash. 
  The veterans in Kaluga were unanimous in voting for an anti- 
government resolution. At the same time in Tver their meeting 
was not particularly emotional. The speakers stressed that they 
would not support a civil war but were in favor of the revival 
of Russia. Signatures were collected at the same rally for the 
repeal of the Russian-American military exercises at the 
"Totskoye" test range in the Orenburg Oblast. 
  A peaceful atmosphere reigned on Mayday in Belgorod. The 
oblast trade unions' council and the administration of the 
oblast center invited the citizens to a celebration of the 
spring and of labor. The motto of the holiday was: Workers' 
solidarity. Its program included a brass band concert, 
performances by the best amateur artists' groups, a circus 
performance, meetings of veterans, and a festival "Sport for 
everyone".

  [Text] Fewer than 50 percent of intercity faxes reach 
their addressees in Russia. The reason for this are poor 
communications channels and antediluvian equipment at most 
telephone exchanges. Ordinary people simply have to somehow 
live with this. But this situation is totally unacceptable in 
the case of the president's office or the government apparatus. 
Official information must be transmitted instantly, otherwise 
normal administration of the country becomes impossible. This 
would be particularly dangerous during an exacerbation of the 
political situation. 
  [B. Kosenkov, spokesman of the president's office, 
identified 
by caption] This is why the president's office has opted for 
the Faxnet network. This system makes it possible to transmit 
information to remote areas promptly, speedily, and with a high 
degree of reliability. 
  [Budnikov] A purely Russian feature of this modern 
technology is the utilization of the channels of the former 
Iskra party-economic communications system which links some 500 
cities in our country. [video shows office equipment including

  [Text] Moscow April 29 TASS -- "If the Russian Republican 
Party have not signed the Social Accord Treaty, this would mean 
its complete political isolation and sliding to recalcitrant 
opposition", deputy of the Duma Vladimir Lysenko, co-chairman of 
the party, told a news conference on Friday. Lysenko views the 
signing of the treaty by Russia's political elite as an 
important step toward civic accord and a breakthrough in public 
conscience. 
  Lysenko hopes there will be no more revolutions in Russia. 
Society embarks of a period of evolutional development. He 
believes the treaty may offer an opportunity of political 
stability in a country for at least two years. Political 
competition will be manifested in parliamentary and presidential 
elections, not through violent non-parliamentary actions. 
  Lysenko apparently decided to give the news conference 
because of the situation that formed as a result of the 
Republican Party's joining the treaty while leaders of the group 
Yabloko in which the party is included refused to do so. It 
should be noted that representatives of the Republican Party 
were elected to the state duma on the ticket of Yabloko bloc.

  [Text] The Republican Party (RP), having signed the Civic 
Accord Pact, believes that it gives the country a chance at 
evolutionary development, one RP leader Vladimir Lysenko who is 
also in the Yavlinskiy-led alliance said on Friday. He stressed 
that any refusal to sign the document would have led to the RP's 
political isolation and fall into the camp of the hardline 
opposition. 
  Lysenko said that only two out of RP's eight-member council 
voted against signing the Pact. They are Vyacheslav 
Shostokovskiy and Igor Yakovenko of the Yavlinskiy-led alliance. 
  Asked if the RP decision was likely to split the Yavlinsky 
alliance, which refused to sign the document, Lysenko warned 
against dramatizing the situation adding that he himself would 
stay put as its member. 
  The decision not to sign the Civic Accord Pact was made by 
alliance leader Grigoriy Yavlinskiy while other members 
including Vladimir Lukin and Viktor Sheynis had warned against 
rejecting it, Lysenko said. 
  One other RP leader Stepan Sulakshin who recently defected 
from the Russia's Choice Party said he had had differences with 
its leader Yegor Gaydar because of his dogmatic reform policy 
"which inevitably leads to violence." On his immediate plans, 
Sulakshin said he did not contemplate joining any faction or 
group for the time being and that "time will alone tell what 
happens next." 
  In the meantime, one other member of the RP council and 
Yavlinskiy-led faction Igor Yakovenko has accused Lysenko of 
reneging on the alliance's position. 
  In an interview with Interfax, he said Lysenko should have 
given up the mandate he won running on the alliance's ticket 
before signing the Pact. 
  "Lysenko who was defeated as an independent owes his mandate 
to the Yavlinskiy-led alliance. By reneging on the faction's 
platform, he has in fact cheated the electorate," Yakovenko 
said. He said the question of party infighting and its stand on 
the Civic Accord Pact would be discussed at a party congress in 
June.

  [Text] Moscow, April 29, RIA -- The Democratic Russia 
movement intends to become a party of the same name, initiators 
of the organising committee of a federal party, movement 
co-chairmen Lev Ponomarev and Gleb Yakunin said today. 
  Ponomarev told a RIA correspondent by telephone that the two 
other co-chairmen of the movement -- Ilya Zaslavskiy and 
Grigoriy Tomchin -- joined Yegor Gaydar's newly created party 
Russia's Choice, while the position of the fifth co-chairwoman 
-- Galina Starovoitova -- remains unknown because she is abroad. 
  The split, says a statement issued by Ponomarev and Yakunin 
today, was caused by the fact that Democratic Russia does not 
want to become an organisation arranging mass actions for the 
Russia's Choice party, as the Soviet trade unions did for the 
CPSU. 
  In Ponomarev's view, "in three to four months it will be 
possible to think of registering the party, but before that a 
lot of work has to be done in the regions". 
  "The Democratic Russia party will be a rival to Gaydar's 
Russia's Choice, but we do not expect ideological differences 
between the two related parties," noted Ponomarev.

<F P=106> [Statement by Presidential Council Member Aleksey Salmin </F>
under the general heading "Treaty on Accord Is Open Book": 
"Mechanism for Implementation Necessary, Presidential Council 
Member Aleksey Salmin Believes"] 
  [Text] An immense amount of work has been done on the 
draft Treaty on Civil Accord and various parties' interests have 
been taken into account in it. Unfortunately, this has not 
always come about harmoniously and there are problems in the 
text itself. However, the main point is not that it has been 
produced but the way this document will "work." 
  After all, this important document should be "built into" a 
certain system of relations, therefore its fate is still not 
determined even if its signing goes off smoothly. 
  The problem for the accord's potential participants, all 
branches and centers of power on Russian territory, is for the 
document to actually "begin to work." This means that there 
should be a certain mechanism for its implementation. Such a 
mechanism could be a genuine accord in parliament, in 
particular, between several factions. A broad nationwide accord 
is not even necessary but a more local one so as to adopt a 
package of essential laws connected with security (on the whole, 
personal security), and other laws, in particular, on economic 
reform, as well as criminal and civil codes, and much else as 
concerns legislation. 
  For this it is necessary that, on the basis of the treaty, 
efficient coalitions are formed in both of parliament's 
chambers, and it is also, of course, necessary for a genuine 
accord to exist between Moscow and the Federation components. 
  So, a dynamic center is necessary to implement the accord so 
that it does not remain only on paper but becomes a fact of 
political life. Such a dynamic center could take the form of 
permanent consultations at the highest level between 
representatives of the various power structures. It would be 
better if this is a permanent working group with a high level of 
cooperation. Because, despite the fact that an important and 
essential step has been taken, what is most important -- 
precisely that which lies at this document's heart -- still lies 
ahead.

  [Excerpts] The next subject in our Panorama slot may 
possibly come as a surprise. After all, two whole months remain 
before the so-called zero hour -- two whole months before the 
period for using our privatization vouchers ends. Some people 
may have forgotten, or some people may not fully remember the 
mechanism for using our vouchers and the legal mechanism for the 
privatization process. It was these matters that our 
correspondent Nikolay Filippov put to Anatoliy Chubays, the 
Russian deputy prime minister. 
  [Begin recording] [Filippov] Anatoliy Borisovich, what do we 
need to do in the remaining two months? 
  [Chubays] It is a short period of time and many people have 
not yet managed to properly ponder their next moves. [passage 
omitted] 
  At present we estimate that there are at least 10 million, 
people who have not yet taken their final decision. [passage 
omitted] On 1 July the period of validity of the privatization 
vouchers expires. They need to be used before then. [passage 
omitted] Our figures show that the involvement of foreigners in 
the voucher privatization process has been very insignificant. 
In fewer than 10 percent of cases has foreign capital been 
involved in the voucher privatization process itself. There is 
no sense therefore in saying that our homeland is being sold off 
for a song. [passage omitted] 
  We now see, especially over the past few months, a sharp 
increase in the involvement of foreign capital at the 
post-voucher stage. [passage omitted] When I see that at the 
post-voucher stage many major firms such as Siemens, Proctor and 
Gamble, and Philip Morris are investing tens of billions of 
dollars in Russian enterprises, it signifies for me an upsurge 
in Russian enterprises and the start of a growth in dividends. 
[passage omitted] Dividends grow and at the same time the 
Russian economy gains, because it means increased production, 
new jobs, and the start of an emergence from the crisis that we 
are now in. Indeed, we are starting to emerge through the 
inflow of investments that have been forthcoming only because 
private enterprises and joint-stock companies are concerned. 
This is a guarantee of a real start to an upsurge of the 
Russian economy as a whole. [passage omitted] [end recording]

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 29 Apr -- Viktor Ilyukhin, chairman of the 
State Duma Committee on Security, will, after the spring 
parliamentary recess, make public documentary evidence in his 
possession of infringements of privatization regulations by the 
State Committee for the Management of State Property. He told 
this to an ITAR-TASS correspondent in a telephone conversation 
today. 
  Viktor Ilyukhin is unperturbed by the news that Anatoliy 
Chubays has decided to bring a court action against him for 
slander. "As a lawyer," he underlined, "I judge the documents I 
have collected to be very serious. They show convincingly that 
the methods which Anatoliy Chubays is using to carry out the 
transfer of state property into private hands serve the 
interests of only 15 to 20 percent of Russia's population." 
  Without waiting for the court to consider, the chairman of 
the Duma Security Committee has decided to inform press 
representatives of the contents of these documents on 
approximately 11-12 May -- immediately after the end of the 
lower chamber of parliament's recess.

  [Text] The president has issued a decree approving a 
program to conduct complex political and legal research in 
1994-95 on ways and forms of strengthening the Russian state. 
The program has been developed by workers of the Institute of 
State and Law of the Russian Academy of Sciences. 
  Boris Yeltsin has also sanctioned the main directions of 
this 
research. They include six sections, of which the priority one 
is the development of the legal system of the Russian Federation 
after the adoption of the new constitution. In particular, an 
idea has been advanced concerning the setting up of a unified 
humanitarian space over the territory of the former Soviet 
Union, which will guarantee protection of the rights of the 
Russophone population in the former Soviet republics and will 
help settle the issue of forced emigration.

<F P=106> [Viktor Bondarev article: "The President Is Forming a </F>
Right- Centrist Alliance"] 
  [Text] If Russia's Choice is considered rightist, 
understanding the latter as the liberal-conservative political 
orientation, then the signing of the Civic Accord Charter should 
be recognized as an attempt by the president to form a 
right-centrist political alliance. Perhaps herein lies the main 
essence of the ceremony in the Kremlin. 
  Of course, far from all the signatories will collaborate 
with 
the executive branch. But the fact that they have turned up at 
the Kremlin points to a certain, and fairly substantial, change 
in the political situation in Russia after the October events 
and the December elections. Especially indicative is the 
discipline of the Federation component leaders. For all its 
shortfalls and bleary prospects, the drive for the adoption of 
the charter has allowed the presidential team to regain 
political initiative after the Duma- inspired amnesty. The 
opposition and the opponents of the executive branch had to play 
by the rules that were enforced on them. True, after the 
elections Yeltsin made both political and economic concessions 
to the centrists, which to a substantial extent made the signing 
possible. The legitimate question arises: Will a worsening 
economic situation not be the price to pay for the temporary 
political respite? 
  The real leader of Russian centrists today is the premier, 
while the economic course he has pursued in the past few months 
can on balance be deemed successful. Although the government 
failed to organize anything properly, and institutional changes 
are moving along by themselves, and the government has never 
made any useful decisions, nonetheless Chernomyrdin managed 
sharply to reduce the rate of inflation and depreciation of the 
ruble. In April inflation again will be approximately 10 
percent. The fall in the inflation rate, however, has to do not 
only with a tough financial policy but also the overcoming of 
the dual-power situation and the economic confusion it brought 
about. The reforms undertaken by Gaydar provided a certain 
impetus which Chernomyrdin had to follow to a certain point. 
And while the premier is realizing this policy, the union -- 
formal or informal -- between liberals (i.e., Gaydar and 
Fedorov) and centrists is still possible. 
  Unexpectedly to many, another main figure in this 
right-centrist bloc became Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin. His role 
manifested itself especially strongly just before the signing of 
the charter, when Zhirinovskiy and the national-communists tried 
to use the assassination of a State Duma deputy to provoke a 
political crisis. The stormy debate in the Duma, however, did 
not go outside its walls, turning into a tempest in a teapot. 
The central role in this was played by the current Constitution 
which has sharply limited the possibility of deputy 
arbitrariness, which was characteristic of the Supreme Soviet 
and the Congress of People's Deputies. Yet one cannot 
underestimate the significance of the policy of the speaker, who 
used his power to promote the charter. Incidentally, Rybkin's 
effective inclusion into the presidential team can also be seen 
as one of the results in the struggle for a civic pact. 
  With his activity -- and what is more important, its 
effectiveness -- Rybkin even has pushed somewhat into the 
background yet another figure on which the president relies: 
Federation Council Speaker V. Shumeyko. The latter has already 
had a few setbacks: budget blocking by the upper chamber, the 
Kazannik case, and the Federation Council's rejection of 
Ilyushenko. 
  The presidential team has conducted the struggle for the 
charter to be concluded very actively but mostly behind closed 
doors, in the lobbies, and also using material incentives -- by 
handing out promises to the industries. The public, ideological 
side of the process has been totally inadequate. The 
president's immediate entourage, or rather his administration, 
failed to produce any strong political figures capable of 
upholding his position in debates with opponents and rivals. 
Earlier, this role was played by Popov, Poltoranin, Shumeyko, 
Shakhray, and Gaydar, who acted as direct exponents of the 
president's will. Now they have receded, and the main promoter 
of the pact became Gaydar, whose status as a faction leader was 
obviously out of tune with his inherited role as legitimizer of 
civic peace. True, the Russia's Choice leader's activity allows 
to talk about the president's right-centrist, not just centrist, 
bloc. Characteristically, Gaydar has already come out with the 
idea of nominating Yeltsin in the next elections. Yet it hardly 
makes much sense trying to look so far ahead.

<F P=106> [Aleksandra Semenova report: "Joint Plenum of Three Courts"] </F>
  [Text] A joint plenum of Russia's Constitutional, Supreme, 
and Higher Arbitration Courts was held in the Supreme Court of 
Russia building yesterday. It discussed draft amendments to the 
law "On the Status of Judges." As a result, a drafting 
commission was confirmed which would busy itself with finalizing 
the wording of the amendments and then submit them to the State 
Duma of the Federal Assembly for approval. 
  The plenum agreed with the provision in the draft law on a 
single status for judges. In the words of Constitutional Court 
acting Chairman Nikolay Vitruk, in the law "it is necessary to 
underline precisely the unity of judges." The plenum approved 
the article in the draft law on judges' independence and abiding 
only by the requirements of the Constitution and the Federal law. 
  Speakers at the plenum noted that it is necessary to reduce 
the length of service qualifying judges for life-long financial 
support from 20 to 10 years. According to one of the judges, 10 
years is quite sufficient for earning "the whole bunch of 
occupational ailments." The plenum also agreed that the length 
of service in the prosecution, justice, and investigation bodies 
should be taken into account in calculating the size of 
life-long financial support. 
  Lyudmila Maykova, deputy chairperson of the Council of 
Judges 
of Russia, proposed that state arbiters should have the same 
social benefits as judges, which they do not have now. 
  Representatives of the Constitutional Court suggested that 
the draft law should include a provision on the creation of its 
own independent security service. The participants also agreed 
with the provision that judges should have the right to carry 
firearms. 
  The plenum also discussed the questions of benefits for 
judges working in the extreme north: one year of work there 
will be put on record as 18 months. 
  The draft law "On the Status of Judges" will be put into 
final shape by a commission of nine participants in the plenum 
confirmed by that body.

<F P=106> [Gleb Cherkasov report under the "Structure" rubric: </F>
"Russia's Ethnic Communities Now Have Congress. President and 
Government Send Greetings"] 
  [Text] The founding convention of the Congress of Ethnic 
Communities of Russia opened in Moscow on 29 April. Taking part 
in its work are delegates from 19 ethnic-cultural societies 
bringing together citizens of Russia who happen to live outside 
the areas with dense populations of people of the same ethnic 
origin, or those who have no such areas (dispersed ethnic 
groups). Also present were representatives of several more 
ethnic associations who preferred the role of observers, and 
representatives of the Repressed Peoples Confederation. 
  The idea for holding the congress met with warm support from 
the powers that be -- at least Boris Yeltsin, and Vice Premiers 
Sergey Shakhray and Yuriy Yarov thought it appropriate to send 
their representatives to read out greetings. In particular, the 
president's message to the congress participants notes the 
beneficial nature of such an action for improving interethnic 
relations in Moscow and Russia. For his part Mr. Yarov's 
representative, who also wished successful work to the congress, 
invited them to interact with the government apparatus. Also, 
messages of greetings from the National-Cultural Society to the 
congress have come from the other countries of the "near and far 
abroad." 
  In their addresses the congress delegates complained about 
the disastrous state of their ethnic cultures and lack of 
appropriate material conditions to revive and develop them; they 
blamed both the local and central authorities for inattention to 
the problems of dispersed ethnic groups which, they thought, 
results from lack of understanding rather than from ill-will. 
Addressing his fellow members, Mikhail Chlenov, member of the 
new organization's organizing committee, called on them not to 
limit their activities to culture and education but also to 
ponder on how to lend the Congress the functions of a 
public-political organization.

and trade with other countries (former Comecon [Council for 
Mutual Economic Assistance] countries, China, North Korea, 
republics of the former Yugoslavia, and the Baltic countries), 
which came to $3.5 billion and fell by 11 percent. 
  Russia's exports in January to March were equal to $8.9 
billion, an increase of 2.9 percent, including $3.3 billion in 
March, 2.4 percent more than in March 1993.

  [Text] Moscow -- In the first three months of 1994, Russia 
did not sign a single contract with the main foreign grain 
suppliers, the Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign Economic 
Relations advises. Grain imports over the period did not exceed 
372,000 tonnes, or only slightly more than 12 percent of the 
same period last year. This grain was delivered under 1993 
carry-over contracts. In the first quarter of 1994, the amounts 
of purchases of many other types of food including meat, white 
sugar, and pasta continued to decline.

<F P=106> [Yelena Kotelnikova report under the "`Aeroflot' </F>
Privatization" rubric: "`Aeroflot' To Receive the Status of 
National Carrier"] 
  [Text] The government has been pinning Russia's prospects 
for securing a niche in the world air-travel market on Aeroflot. 
From now on it will become our flag-carrier, a status set forth 
in the government decree "On Approving the Charter of the 
"Aeroflot -- Russian International Airlines" Joint-Stock 
Company." While vesting Aeroflot with the right to represent 
the country's interests on the world air-travel market, the 
government is at the same time tightening state control over its 
activity. 
  The "Aeroflot -- Russian International Airlines" 
Joint-Stock Company was set up following the reorganization of 
the "Aeroflot -- Soviet Airlines" commercial association, the 
Central International Civil Aviation Air Traffic Administration, 
the International Commercial Civil Aviation Administration, the 
Sheremetyevo Technical Aviation Enterprise, the International 
Payments Center, and the "Rossiya" Interregional Agency of 
International Air Services. 
  According to the charter, Sheremetyevo international airport 
and the Moscow Airlines company will be separated from Aeroflot 
to become independent state-owned firms. The authorized capital 
of the newly created open-end joint-stock company is 
2,186,394,000 rubles. Before privatization begins, however, all 
Aeroflot stock will be kept in federal ownership and will not be 
offered for sale until the government so authorizes. The 
documents envision the possibility of selling 49 percent of the 
stock to the airline's workers, but the period of 
denationalization is not specified: the White House has not yet 
worked out a clear stance on the subject. Dividends accrued on 
shares remaining in federal ownership must be paid exclusively 
to the joint-stock company for three years, to be spent on 
aviation technology and equipment purchases. 
  According to the concept devised by government experts, 
apart from "protecting economic and other (which? -- 
KOMMERSANT-DAILY) interests" of Russia, Aeroflot's objective is 
to make profits not only by "meeting requirements for 
international and domestic air travel," but also by providing 
other services. By so doing the government gives in advance the 
go-ahead to any commercial activity by the leading airline. 
  This makes sense. Aeroflot is the sole Russian company that 
can boast long years of operation on a highly competitive world 
market. Such experience cannot be acquired by sitting in 
government offices. Aeroflot's competitiveness has not been 
dented by the emergence of other Russian airlines on the 
international market. This was confirmed, for instance, by the 
fact that Aeroflot was among two airlines operating 
international services that ended last year with a profit (over 
200 billion rubles), the other one being British Airways, which 
earned around $100 million. 
  The government, however, thought it necessary to tighten 
control over the activity of the enterprise. This will be 
achieved primarily by changing the form of management. The 
status of a joint-stock company calls for a board of directors 
(seven people), whose chairman and members are appointed by the 
government. The government will therefore be able to control 
the entire day-to-day financial activity of a profitable 
company. thus creating conditions for raising federal budget 
revenues from its operations. This is why Aeroflot, of course, 
will be in a privileged position when obtaining air-travel 
licenses. Nonetheless, it is unlikely that state protection 
will affect Aeroflot's pricing policy of setting the prices of 
its services too high by comparison with their quality.

  [Unattributed report under the "In Brief" rubric: 
"Orenburg"] 
  [Text] "The state does need the press and television, but 
not in the amounts in which they currently exist," Russian 
Federation Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin told journalists 
in Orenburg, where he arrived to attend festivities on the 
occasion of the 250th anniversary of Orenburg Guberniya's 
formation. The premier pointed out that the state would 
maintain a number of newspapers and television channels, but 
this would not apply to all existing mass media. According to 
the head of government, the system of state support for 
newspapers and television will be preserved only during a 
transition period.

<F P=106> [Igor Korolkov report: "Chernomyrdin Intends To Ease the </F>
Lot of the Press"] 
  [Text] The prime minister has supported a draft law on 
state protection, Boris Mironov, chairman of the Russian 
Federation Committee for the Press, reported at a press 
conference, the state protection in question being applied to 
the mass media, book production, and those sectors -- the 
printing and paper industries -- which provide them with 
services. 
  Under the draft law, among other things, the printing 
facilities of the mass media are exempt from the payment of 
customs duties for the import of paper, printing equipment, and 
spare parts which are not produced in Russia. Publishing houses 
are also exempt from customs duties for the products they 
export. The mass media will receive a 50 percent discount on 
postal, telegraph, and telephone communication charges. 
  If the draft law proposed by the Committee for the Press is 
passed by the State Duma, it will cost the state exchequer R1 
billion. Unlike Chernomyrdin and the Ministry of the Economy, 
which have supported it, the Finance Ministry is against. This 
is understandable: It fears that other sectors will also argue 
their exceptional status and demand similar concessions.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Sazhin report: "It Is Not Subsidies But a Law </F>
That Is Needed. `Emergency Meeting' in Russian Federation Press 
Committee"] 
  [Text] Moscow -- Yesterday the Russian Federation Press 
Committee held an `emergency meeting' of central and regional 
newspaper journalists. Committee Chairman B. Mironov told those 
attending about the results of the work of the two-day central 
and regional newspaper editors' conference. There was also a 
kind of committee report on the work it has done in the last 
four months. 
  As is known, at the end of December and beginning of January 
the mass media was in a crisis situation -- typographic service 
prices sharply increased because of an revaluation of 
polygraphic capacities. This could have led to the closure of 
many publications. A solution was nevertheless found. 
  "We proposed two options for solving the problem," Mironov 
said. "The first is to continue subsidizing the press in 1994. 
This is not a promising route because not everyone can be given 
help. Over 1 trillion rubles would be needed to do this. 
Naturally the government does not have that kind of money at the 
moment. The second is to draft a law on state protectionism for 
the press. This means preferential taxes, rent, and customs 
duties. A draft of such a law has been prepared. At a meeting 
between mass media leaders and V. Chernomyrdin it was decided to 
consider it at a Government Presidium session and then send it 
to the State Duma. But for the time being the premier confined 
himself to a subsidy of R110.4 billion. 
  The committee leadership is concerned by the fact that 
because of the high cost of polygraphic services many 
publications are having to be printed abroad, where prices are 
somewhat lower. We are being enticed by the cheese in the 
mousetrap. New jobs are being created abroad for Russian money, 
while our print shops are closing down and high-caliber 
specialists are leaving. In a year or two foreigners will 
increase their prices. Russian fugitives will be forced to 
return home and will be no better off than before, because by 
that time print shops will have become completely run down.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Batygin commentary: "`Press Asked Not to Worry'"] </F>
  [Text] The Media Disputes Tribunal set up four months ago 
in accordance with the Russian Federation president's edict is 
designed, according to Paragraph 4 of the statute on it, to 
"help ensure the objectivity and accuracy of reporting in the 
mass media that touches on public interests." The pretext for 
the latest session of the tribunal, which was attended by 
ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA's correspondent, was the article carried in 
one of the March issues of EKSPRESS-GAZETA entitled "But 
People...Live!" devoted to the material and organizational 
provision for State Duma deputies. The lower house of 
parliament considered this newspaper article to be libelous. 
The State Duma's Legal Administration sent a statement to the 
tribunal attesting to the inaccuracy of the EKSPRESS-GAZETA 
article. 
  I. Zablotskiy, a staffer at the Legal Administration, 
referred in his statement to the Interim Statute on Ensuring the 
Activities of State Duma Deputies (it was published in 
ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA 29 January), which stipulated the rights and 
privileges that deputies may enjoy. There was no mention of 
dachas, foreign trips, or personal physicians -- as 
EKSPRESS-GAZETA had reported. 
  G. Dyakonov, leader of the Duma Press Center, who spoke 
after 
I. Zablotskiy, talked about breaches of professional standards 
by the EKSPRESS-GAZETA journalists, who had failed to check 
their facts. 
  For their part, the respondents, representing the 
newspaper's 
founders -- the "Komsomolskaya Pravda" Joint-Stock Company and 
the "Segodnya" Limited Partnership -- tried to use different 
arguments. They said that the article "But People...Live!" had 
used facts borrowed from other newspapers. 
  But Tribunal Chairman A. Vengerov and the tribunal members 
deemed these explanations unconvincing. First, EKSPRESS-GAZETA 
had not indicated the sources of the information it had cited. 
Moreover, the quoting was inaccurate and not verbatim, and the 
facts -- lifted from various publications and collated -- 
created a distorted impression of deputies. 
  The article "But People...Live!" was deemed inaccurate and 
unobjective, and a crude breach of legal and technical norms. 
The newspaper's founders were instructed to relieve A. 
Kupriyanov of his duties as chief editor. 
  We have no grounds to leap to A. Kupriyanov's defense. 
Nonetheless, we are doing so, because, in our view, the Media 
Disputes Tribunal is turning more and more into a kind of 
censorship organ -- a prototype of the notorious "troika" -- 
where it is becoming the rule not to listen to the accused 
party. That was the case at the hearings on the article "Buds 
Swelling. For a Putsch?" in OBSHCHAYA GAZETA. The tribunal 
condemned the statement from the Russian Federation Press 
Committee without even inviting a representative to attend. 
Moreover, in a phone call to the chief editor of ROSSIYSKAYA 
GAZETA, A. Vengerov said that they did not consider it necessary 
to invite committee workers to attend, the statement was 
sufficient.... 
  The Statute on the Tribunal (Paragraph 12) states that it is 
entitled to reprimand a journalist who violates generally 
accepted ethical norms, and "in the event of their violating the 
legislation on the mass media, to raise the question before the 
relevant organ (leader) of established legislative proceedings 
being instituted against them." As we can see, there is no 
mention here of the tribunal's right to recommend the removal of 
the chief editor. And the tribunal was conceived so as to 
ensure that its activity would be based on moral and ethical 
grounds, without being a substitute for judicial and legal 
organs. 
  It is probably no accident that in its 4 February issue 
IZVESTIYA allowed itself to voice some doubts about the 
tribunal's good intentions: "....under certain circumstances 
the tribunal is also able to pursue a line of actually 
restricting press freedom." 
  At the hearing the EKSPRESS-GAZETA representatives suggested 
that it had been decided to begin with them so as to "stifle" 
the yellow press. A. Vengerov brushed this aside, claiming that 
there was no intention to "stifle" anyone and, in general, he 
did not want to listen to such arguments. 
  Nonetheless, has not the tribunal's ruling turned out to be 
far too politicized? The hearing saw the use of what was, to my 
mind, a very symptomatic phrase -- "our patience is exhausted." 
  It has to be admitted that even the tone of the tribunal's 
ruling was surprising. It used the word "mockery" three times 
and the journalists were rebuked for their "basic ignorance" and 
their "unacceptable presentational style." I may not have to 
read this kind of ruling very often, but I would like to see a 
suitable tone of gravitas from such an important institution. 
  The tribunal is meant to settle media disputes. At the last 
hearing there was no dispute as such -- it was clearly one-way 
traffic. You could not help getting the feeling that you were 
present at the birth of a media tribunal that had taken on all 
the "best" punitive traditions of agitprop.

  [Text] Moscow April 29 TASS -- Leader of the Russian 
Liberal- Democratic Party Vladimir Zhirinovskiy plans to bring 
an action against Vice-Premier Anatoliy Chubays and a number of 
newspapers. 
  His lawyer Sergey Belyak has prepared a "new set of suits" 
to 
protect the honor and dignity of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, says a 
report of the Liberal-Democratic faction's press service 
circulated here today. 
  In the opinion of Zhirinovskiy, the newspapers SEGODNYA, 
KURANTY and IZVESTIYA are guilty "of spreading German media's 
fake report on alleged reception of Honecker money by the 
Liberal-Democratic Party". The lawyer is sure each newspaper 
will have "to pay at least 200 million rubles". 
  The reason for the action against Chubays is his accusations 
of Zhirinovskiy of fascism. The report says the last straw was 
Chubays' interview with the ARGUMENTY I FAKTY newspaper.

<F P=106> [Editorial Office report: "Editorial Saga"] </F>
  [Text] PRAVDA has already reported on what has been 
happening in and around our newspaper's editorial office of 
late. But the high emotions in the newspapers and on television 
and radio, fueled by Viktor Linnik and his team, are showing no 
signs of abating (in particular, yesterday's issue of NOVAYA 
YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA carried a manifestly biased article 
entitled "Viktor Linnik Has Yet To Occupy the Editor's Chair"). 
But the crux of the matter is in general terms simple: In 
early February the PRAVDA collective passed a vote of no 
confidence in the then Editor Viktor Linnik. It did so because 
the newspaper's leader was unable to ensure its regular 
publication and because an atmosphere of uncertainty about the 
future had been created in the editorial office. But the main 
reason was that the editor and his comrades-in-arms were ready 
to close the newspaper down for an indefinite period, which 
would have caused -- and already was causing -- irreparable 
damage to PRAVDA's prestige and would have jeopardized its 
continuing existence. However, on 6 April, Linnik was reinstated 
in his post by a court ruling -- clearly errors in the 
organization of the collective's assembly played their part 
here. All right, PRAVDA's workers, as law-abiding people, 
agreed to implement the court judgment. But the very first 
steps toward reinstating the "chief" caused unrest in the 
collective. It turned out that Linnik was still prepared to 
close the newspaper down for a long while and he announced that 
the paper had split from its publisher, heedless of the damage 
that such a step could cause his editorial associates. Orders, 
including orders on staffing issues, were signed one after 
another, without any consultation at all with the editorial 
office, which under the editorial charter has the final say. 
The board of the journalists' organization then decided to call 
-- strictly in accordance with the editorial charter -- a 
combined meeting of the journalists' organization and the 
journalists' collective. It considered the question of the 
chief editor. Having agreed to implement the court ruling, the 
collective deemed it essential to hear Linnik. But the latter 
refused to attend the meeting or talks with his comrades. 
Linnik was released from the duties of chief editor by an 
overwhelming majority of votes (there were only four votes 
against). At that same meeting Aleksandr Ilin, a PRAVDA worker 
for 20 years, who had run the collective for the previous two 
months, was elected chief editor of PRAVDA. During that time 40 
issues of the newspaper had ben published and it had developed a 
good working rhythm. That is why a decision in favor of Ilin 
was made, not because of any fiat from abroad, as certain 
"patriots" claim. It only remains to say that PRAVDA's 
editorial office is producing a newspaper, and our readers, 
judging by their responses, hold it in high esteem. But some 
former ambitious colleagues are doing all they can to damage 
PRAVDA by distorting the truth of the matter, operating on the 
principle that it does not matter if PRAVDA is in a bad way as 
long as they are okay. You will agree that a chief editor who 
fights for his job against the will of a collective which has 
voted him out looks strange. Perhaps it is time for our 
colleagues on other publications to realize that by their 
articles they are supporting not PRAVDA the newspaper (this 
hardly worries them) but a contender for the editorial chair?

  [Text] Moscow April 29 TASS -- "The signing of the Treaty 
on Social Accord in Moscow on Thursday is a historical event for 
our country" declared Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev on 
Friday. He said that an absolute majority of the heads of 
political parties, socio-political organisations, territories 
and regions had signed the document. 
  Speaking before the beginning of his talks with South Korean 
Defence Minister Yi Pyong-tae, who is in Moscow on an official 
visit, Grachev expressed the hope that other socio-political 
organisations would sign the agreement in the near future. 
Those who did not sign the document will be regarded by 
Russians as forces "which are not striving towards accord and 
peace". 
  Touching on the May 1 Labor Day holiday, which last year was 
marked by a bloody confrontation between demonstrators and 
police, Grachev hoped that everything would be peaceful this 
time.

<F P=106> [Our correspondent report: "Financial Service Looks for </F>
Ways of Armed Forces' Survival"] 
  [Text] On 27-28 April 1994, a meeting of the senior 
personnel of the Russian Federation Armed Forces' 
financial-economic service was held in Moscow. The meeting was 
prompted by the extremely difficult financial situation in the 
Army and the Navy, the need to look for extra ways to cut 
military expenditures, to choose priorities in spending, and to 
tighten economic austerity. 
  The meeting was attended by Army General P.S. Grachev, 
Russian Federation defense minister; A.A. Kokoshin, his first 
deputy; State Tax Service chief V.V. Gusev, and other senior 
officials. 
  The defense minister pointed in his report to the financial- 
economic service's considerable contribution to the organization 
and preparation of new, highly efficient Armed Forces. At the 
same time, he stressed that in current conditions one of the 
main objective of commanders and chiefs of all ranks is the 
search for ways to cut spending and to make sure that all money 
appropriated for defense needs are spent efficiently. Given 
drastic cuts in appropriations for Army and Navy equipment, 
every ruble spent for these purposes should serve to strengthen 
the Armed Forces as much as possible. At the same time, it was 
noted that even in these difficult conditions concern for 
servicemen, civilian personnel, Armed Forces veterans, and their 
family members remains a priority objective. 
  The defense minister stressed that at a time of inflation 
and 
legislative confusion only the financial-economic service can 
securely shield the army from those who would like to cash in at 
its expense. Army Gen. Grachev said that financial staffers 
should be the first to help commanders solve financial and 
economic problems. Given that, the Defense Ministry leadership 
will do its utmost to boost the prestige of the 
financial-economic service and to enhance its status. 
  Participants in the meeting put a lot of questions to the 
State Tax Service chief, because relations between the service 
and the Armed Forces have yet to be fully straightened out. 
Even the cost of meat produced on military units' own 
subsidiary plots for the personnel mess list is often taxed 
locally. The military have been fined for delaying payments to 
the budget and pensions fund, which is absurd because the 
nonpayments have been caused by the sluggish and incomplete 
financing of the Armed Forces from the federal budget. The 
State Tax Service chief promised that these matters would be 
sorted out in the very near future.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vadim Byrkin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 29 Apr -- An agreement on cooperation in 
solving questions of the social protection of military 
servicemen and the moral, spiritual, patriotic and aesthetic 
education of servicemen and the members of their families was 
signed on Thursday by the Russian Ministry of Defense and the 
Independent Union of Military Servicemen. 
  An ITAR-TASS correspondent was told at the union's central 
committee today that this took place during the signing of the 
Social Accord Treaty in the St. George's Hall of the Kremlin, 
during the course of which the sides were able to work out 
optimal approaches to resolving vital problems of the armed 
forces. 
  The sides believe that one of the basic tasks facing the 
state and society is the reshaping of the army and the navy, and 
they pledge to carry out joint work in shaping the Russian armed 
forces on a professional basis and in educating servicemen and 
their families, and also to revive and publicize the ancient 
spiritual and moral traditions of the Russian army and navy. 
  The Ministry of Defense and the independent servicemen's 
union agreed to carry out joint work on the social adaptation of 
citizens discharged from military service, on the construction 
of housing, the opening of new enterprises based on converted 
military facilities, the creation of new jobs and the retraining 
of servicemen in civilian professions. 
  The agreement points out that the sides pledge "to prevent 
the army and navy being dragged into political games, a 
reduction in the level of defense capability, and a weakening in 
the social protection of servicemen and citizens discharged to 
the reserve or into retirement, and their families". Joint 
preparations for the celebrations to mark the 50th anniversary 
of the victory in the Great Patriotic War will also be carried 
out. 
  The agreement was signed by Russian Defense Minister Army 
General Pavel Grachev, and Mikhail Kolchev, chairman of the 
Central Committee of the Independent Union of Military 
Servicemen of the Russian Federation.

<F P=106> [Pavel Koltsov report in the "Military Industrial Complex" </F>
column: "The Defense Industry Is Suffocating Without Money. 
This Undermines the Country's Security"] 
  [Text] On 28 April a session of the Russian Federation 
Security Council's Interdepartmental Commission on Defense 
Security was held, presided over by First Deputy Defense 
Minister Andrey Kokoshin. The commission includes Valeriy 
Mikhaylov, first deputy economy minister; Andrey Vavilov, first 
deputy finance minister; Yuriy Koptev, general director of the 
Russian Space Agency; Aleksandr Starovoytov, general director of 
the Federal Government Communication and Information Agency; 
deputy heads of the Foreign Affairs Ministry, the Nuclear 
Industry Ministry, the State Defense Industry Committee, the 
Russian State Machine Building Industry Committee, the Internal 
Affair Ministry, the Foreign Intelligence Service, the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service, the Science Ministry, the Foreign 
Economic Relations Ministry, the Ministry for Civil Defense, 
Emergency Situations, and Liquidation of the Effects of Natural 
Disasters, and senior officials from the Defense Ministry and 
the General Staff. 
  The provision of modern armaments to the armed forces and 
the 
situation of enterprises carrying out state defense production 
orders were analyzed in detail. 
  Colonel General Anatoliy Sitnov, chief of the Russian 
Federation Armed Forces Armaments Department, said that on all 
the main weapon types the Defense Ministry has reduced the 
variety [tipazh] of equipment ordered by two to three times, 
seeking to standardize artillery systems, armored personnel 
carriers, tanks, transport and combat helicopters, and so forth. 
In spite of the extremely difficult financial situation, the 
Defense Ministry is so far managing to ensure progress in 
developing a number of major, leading-edge arms and defense 
technologies. 
  The participants in the session stated that owing to the 
chronic underfinancing of the Armed Forces needs, including in 
filling defense orders, arms production, and defense research 
and development projects, the worst difficult situation has 
occurred in the past two years. 
  The Interdepartmental Commission on Defense Security 
stressed 
that with such financing the long-term arms program and the plan 
for the organizational development of the Armed Forces just hang 
in the air. Commission members noted that a number of major 
presidential and government decisions are not being fulfilled. 
At the same time the commission pointed to the inadequacy of 
the legislative and normative basis in the defense sphere and 
proposed a number of concrete measures in this field. 
  The situation with funding the restructuring and 
diversification of defense enterprises is also very acute. With 
a sharp reduction in the arms procurement fund, the requisite 
funds for essential civil science-intense production and 
infrastructure development orders are not forthcoming. 
  "The development of infrastructures in all countries is 
primarily the concern of the state," Andrey Kokoshin stressed. 
"This is necessary both to the economy as a whole and to ensure 
the country's defense capability. The creation of modern 
transport, TV and communication facilities linking primarily the 
European and Asian parts of Russia must be among the top 
priorities in Russia's national security policy. At present an 
alarming situation is developing in this area." 
  Responding to questions from NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA about the 
situation in the country's military industrial complex, Andrey 
Kokoshin noted the following. 
  The domestic economy has an acute need for "industrial 
growth 
areas" with an active role of the state and private capital. 
Such areas can be created primarily by increasing state orders 
to diversifying enterprises in the defense complex. 
  In Kokoshin's view, it is necessary not to reduce but in 
fact 
increase the production of civil aircraft equipped with new, 
more economical engines, as well as transport automation means, 
communication and TV satellites, railway rolling stock, and 
cargo and passenger vessels, using advanced space and aviation 
technology, and so forth. With the requisite funds allocated 
for this, for a certain period the budget deficit will increase 
but then, if things are properly organized, the tax base will 
grow, which will help overcome stagflation. 
  This should be accompanied by a more flexible and 
differentiated state policy in transportation tariffs because 
otherwise links between East and West will weaken. It is 
necessary to apply aerospace technology to creating new motor 
and railway facilities, the food industry, and many other 
spheres. 
  With an active and purposeful state policy, private Russian 
capital, which is so far taking a wait-and-see attitude, will 
actively flow into these spheres. 
  The Interdepartmental Commission on Defense Security has 
prepared specific assessments and proposals for the Russian 
Federation Security Council and Government to improve the 
financing of defense needs and ensure priority research and 
development projects, in accordance with the 19 January 1994 
decision of the Russian Federation Security Council.

<F P=106> [Igor Chernyak report: "Will Pay Go Up? If Only We Knew </F>
What It Will Entail..."] 
  [Text] According to KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA's information, 
Boris Yeltsin intends to sign within the next few days a 
decision on a further increase in the salaries of servicemen in 
the Russian Armed Forces -- by 50 percent, so it is supposed. 
One could only congratulate officers and generals in this 
connection, if it were not for one "but." 
  This is not the first time the president has demonstrated 
his 
concern for the Army. But, by a strange coincidence, similar 
decisions have hitherto been adopted on the eve of a possible 
exacerbation of the political situation in the country. For 
example, before the referendum of April 1993, when the troops 
were paid "arrears" of pay and more than 150 generalships were 
conferred on top officers. The situation was repeated shortly 
before the president's "strategic fall offensive," when the 
Ministry of Finance suddenly and "unexpectedly" paid servicemen 
the salaries for July-September, which had been delayed, with a 
coefficient of 1.8. At the time, comments appeared in 
newspapers in this connection, and there was talk of a special 
plan to influence the Army and a desire to boost its loyalty to 
the authorities on the eve of important political events.

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Military Procurator General V.M. Kruk </F>
by correspondent Igor Serebryakov; place and date not given; 
from the "Aty-Baty" program] 
  [Text] [Serebryakov] As a person who deals directly with 
the subject, could you tell us whether corruption in the armed 
forces is increasing or decreasing? 
  [Kruk] It is difficult to talk about the decrease of crime 
in 
the military or in society. It continues to grow -- perhaps not 
at the rate that it did in previous years, but it is increasing. 
And because the armed forces are part of society, as they used 
to say, the troubles and hardships taking place in society are 
transmitted to the armed forces. It is true that the general 
situation is a negative one, and it continues to worsen in 
society at large, and this also has a negative effect on the 
armed forces. Crime is on the increase, and the military 
procurator's office currently is handling several ongoing 
investigations against several high-ranking officials on charges 
of corruption, bribery, unauthorized commercial ties, 
self-enrichment, and so forth. These cases are about to be 
publicized. It will be possible to reveal them in the near 
future, but it is still detrimental to talk about them because 
of tactical considerations. There are such cases, and we will 
concentrate on them. We investigated several times more cases 
like this type last year than during all preceding years. 
Military procuracy organs are more independent today from any 
kind of pressure from ministerial departments than ever before. 
We obey only the prosecutor general and the law, and I do not 
know of any case in the past few years win which pressure 
produced any discernible result. 
  [Serebryakov] So what is going on, then? I have recently had 
an opportunity to tour the hot spots: Stepanakert, Georgia, 
Abkhazia, and so on. I am a military man myself, and I can 
clearly distinguish regulation-issue Soviet Army weaponry from 
that which is not. In all of these wars, hundreds and thousands 
of people are being killed by weapons which were supplied to 
both gangs and irregular forces of these republics through 
informal channels from the depots of the [former] Soviet army. 
I think that if someone were not selling these weapons 
illegally, these terrible conflicts on the perimeter of our 
country would not exist. Young power structures in the process 
of being formed do not have enough money to buy such weapons, so 
how did they get there, how did this happen, and who is 
responsible? 
  [Kruk] The myths and legends claiming that all the gangs and 
bands, all the warring sides are armed exclusively with military 
equipment and weapons from the Russian armed forces are 
unsubstantiated. The thing is, after the USSR collapsed, 
enormous quantities of equipment and arms remained on the 
territories of the former republics. Let us remember the 
weapons depots in Agdam. 
  [Serebryakov] But they belonged to the Soviet army. 
  [Kruk] They later came under the jurisdiction of Azerbaijan, 
which privatized them. All of this [equipment] is being used 
for fighting now and will continue to be used for this purpose 
for a long time to come. 
  Let us cite the situation in Georgia. After the well-known 
events of 1991 which had to do with Georgia becoming a sovereign 
state, gangs of every kind had one goal only: to steal anything 
that was not nailed down. This meant weapons first and 
foremost, but also equipment, drugs, and other valuables. Let 
us remember that over 600 armed attacks against Russian units 
deployed in Georgia took place during 1992-93. The only goal 
[of these attacks] was capturing arms and equipment. 
  [Serebryakov] The stock at the Agdam depots could not have 
lasted for more than three months of fighting. So they used it 
all up in the first three months of the war. But where do they 
take it from after that? There is only one possibility: One 
either pumps it in from Iran or from Afghanistan. But I think 
that it is coming from the north. 
  [Kruk] The Agdam depots are not the only ones of their kind. 
Moreover, we must not forget that arms arrive at the hot spots 
not only from Russia but also from neighboring countries, such 
as Armenia, the Dniestr region, Ukraine, and several others. 
  Let us remember the case, which was scandalous at the time, 
of the dachas in Krasnogorsk and Domodedovo. The top echelon of 
the Defense Ministry was accused of accomplishing the illegal 
privatization of dachas. There was a lot of talk and noise 
concerning this, and demands for blood from every side. Time 
passed, the dust settled, all the material is in the courts, 
suits have been brought, but the cases still have not been 
settled. But this is not our fault. 
  [Serebryakov] But why? What is the matter? Did the courts 
fail to adopt a decision, or maybe there are not enough facts? 
  [Kruk] There might be enough facts, but the legal basis is 
not always appropriate for the situations we encounter today. 
After all, the situation changes, and what might have been 
illegal two or three years ago has acquired a legal status 
today. Everyone still experiences a housing shortage. We are 
building housing with the help of Germany, Finland, and the 
Baltic republics. It is a different matter that the housing 
does not always go to those for whom it is intended. Yes, there 
are instances of abuses. 
  [Text] [Serebryakov] Are these serious? 
  [Kruk] As long as there are shortages, there will be abuses. 
There is no avoiding it. This is one of life's axioms. If 
there is something that has to be divided between people, and if 
there are more people than there are pieces of cake, someone 
always will get preferential treatment. 
  [Serebryakov] Is the procurator's office today pursuing 
cases 
involving housing matters? 
  [Kruk] There are quite a few. 
  [Serebryakov] Will some conclusions be drawn? 
  [Kruk] Undoubtedly. Extensive reports are being prepared for 
the defense minister and the government. These questions are 
raised continuously. Not a quarter goes by.... [Kruk pauses] 
We present this issue to different levels several times a year. 
Yes, we take measures to solve certain problems, but new ones 
crop up. 
  [Serebryakov] If there is some barrier preventing all these 
corrupt structures from developing, then it must be the military 
procurator's office first and foremost. How do you publicize 
your work to the people? 
  [Kruk] An investigator or a team of investigators carry out 
work regarding a certain person in some region and in a concrete 
garrison or department. Only those who are connected to this 
case know about it. Several months usually go by before a case 
is completed. The unit that this person was serving in is 
usually informed, the command is notified, and the appropriate 
information -- to the effect that an investigation of the case 
established this and that and that the circumstances which made 
it possible were such and such -- is distributed up to and 
including the defense minister. A set of measures is proposed to 
prevent such incidents in the future. It is a different matter 
that all of this is not always widely publicized. The regional 
or national public does not know that a certain case has been 
investigated and that those found guilty were justly punished. 
I think that this is partially our fault, too, in that we do 
not address the mass media a lot. It might be because the 
alliance between the mass media and the investigative organs has 
not been very productive. Both sides are to blame for this, and 
correspondents printing such material do not always interpret it 
correctly. Sometimes there is just talk, slander, and incorrect 
interpretations, which distort the whole meaning. There is a 
lot of repercussions and noise.... 
  [Serebryakov, interrupting] Well, they are looking for a 
sensation, but actually, they just obstruct the case. 
  [Kruk] Or they are trying to dramatize things just for the 
effect of it. In real life, it is much more prosaic, but they 
wish for something big and heroic. In practice, everything is 
much simpler.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Khrustov report under the "Projects" rubric: </F>
"Money for Space Will Yield Space Technologies"] 
  [Text] The "Molniya" Science and Production Association, 
where "Buran" -- our own version of the space shuttle -- was 
designed, is embarking on the first financial-industrial 
aerospace consortium in Russia. This information was relayed to 
journalists who had been invited to the famous firm by Aleksandr 
Bashilov, general director of the science and production 
association, and his deputy Konstantin Borovoy, director of the 
new commercial project. 
  Since it is simply impossible at present to support the 
aerospace industry at the proper level within the framework of 
the state budget, it has been decided to pool the efforts of our 
best aerospace firms with the financial potential of Russia's 
commercial structures. "Molniya's" specialists regard the 
following as the principal long-term projects with a good chance 
of success: A multipurpose aerospace system and an orbiting 
spaceplane launched from a delivery vehicle rather than a space 
center, a function that could be performed by the An-225 (the 
"Mriya"). Incidentally, the science and production association 
plans to develop its own heavy aircraft with a much bigger cargo 
carrying capacity than "Mriya." This system, which would not 
require a space center, would enable us to place payloads in 
orbit from virtually any point on the globe, thus making orbital 
payload delivery five to seven times cheaper. "Molniya" is 
already preparing to offer customers a series of light business 
aircraft, one of which -- the six-seater "Molniya-1" air taxi -- 
is successfully undergoing flight tests. A total of 20 series 
aircraft have already been manufactured by the Samara plant. 
  It is expected that the incorporation documents for the 
establishment of the Russian Aerospace Company could be signed 
this June. The first profit, Konstantin Borovoy believes, could 
show up literally within the next few months: The "Molniya" 
Science and Production Association already has a competitive 
product both on the domestic and the world market. In addition 
to the aerospace technology already mentioned, it includes 
advanced technologies and new materials, for example adhesives 
which were developed during work on "Buran." Moreover, most of 
this "know-how" is extremely adaptable and can be applied in a 
number of sectors of the national economy.

<F P=106> [UKRINFORM report: "The President Has Confirmed His </F>
Intention"] 
  [Text] The Ukrainian president met with the collective of 
KIYEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI, familiarized himself with the 
technological process of preparing the newspaper, and answered 
journalists' questions. Leonid Kravchuk confirmed his intention 
not to take part in the presidential elections. He will stand 
up in the parliament for their postponement. The president 
expressed a hope that the new Supreme Council would support him. 
"This is not just my opinion. Dozens of local councils, 
hundreds of labor collectives, and some political parties spoke 
in favor of postponing the elections," stressed the head of the 
Ukrainian state. 
  Touching upon the further operation of the Chernobyl Atomic 
Electric Power Plant, the president pointed out: All conditions 
have been created for its normal work. There can be no question 
of closing it down now because, first, there are no funds for 
that and, second, Ukraine has found itself in an energy crisis.

<F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Katsman: "More Than a Third of Deputies </F>
Are Against 26 June Elections"] 
  [Text] As a KIYEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI correspondent has learned 
from sources close to the Supreme Council, a group of newly 
elected deputies began to collect signatures demanding 
postponement of the presidential and local elections. According 
to preliminary assessments, as of the evening of 26 April, the 
group collected 130 signatures. The list, however, is not yet 
closed -- the collection of signatures continues. Having 
obtained the support of a third of the deputies, the initiators 
of this action continue to pursue their goal. 
  The same sources have reported that the number of 
signatories 
increased after Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk had revealed 
his intention to ask the Supreme Council to change its 
resolution on the summer elections. There is another very 
interesting fact. Among deputies who have signed the motion, 
are those who are affiliated to entirely opposing teams of 
candidates for the presidency, including teams which consider 
the elections absolutely essential.

  [Text] In Friday's interview with INTERFAX the leader of 
the Ukrainian Socialist Party Alexander Moroz said that if 
President Kravchuk decided to call off the pre-term presidential 
elections, the coal miners would an launch industrial action and 
Kravchuk would be forced to revoke his decision. 
  On 28 April, 120 members of the Ukrainian parliament urged 
Kravchuk to call off the June 26 elections. They felt early 
voting would provoke constitutional chaos and anarchy. 
  Kravchuk said the parliament's refusal to call off the 
elections would aggravate the constitutional crisis. He said he 
would know what to do after the lawmakers had discussed the 
issue. 
  According to Moroz, there were no legal grounds for the 
suspension of the presidential elections. If the president said 
he was out to protect the nation's Constitution, said Moroz, he 
must use constitutional means to do so. 
  But, Moroz said, the president enjoyed the right to propose 
new legislation and could address the Supreme Soviet with a 
proposal for the postponement of the elections. 
  The new body of the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet will be 
expected 
to open session on 11 May.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS corresponedents Viktor Demidenko and </F>
Mikhail Melnik] 
  [Text] Notv, 1 May -- Aleksandr Moroz (Socialist Party), 
candidate for the Ukrainian presidency, is categorically against 
postponing the date for electing the head of state: I will do 
everything to have the election take place on the scheduled 
date, he told ITAR-TASS in an interview today. 
  You will recall that Leonid Kravchuk has appealed to 
parliament with an initiative to transfer the date of the 
presidential election from 26 June to a later date. This was 
supported the other day by 120 deputies in the Supreme Council. 
  Combining with the communists and the Peasants' Party in a 
single bloc, the Socialist Party now has 36 percent of the seats 
in parliament. If it is remembered that Ukrainian communist 
leader Petr Symonenko gave up his presidential candidacy the 
other day, then Aleksandr Morozov has a substantial chance of 
winning in the presidential marathon; but for this to happen he 
needs to collect 100,000 voters' signatures for his initial 
official registration as candidate for the post of president.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] More than one third of those who have been, as of 
date, elected to the Ukrainian parliament agree with President 
Kravchuk that pre-term presidential elections will breed 
anarchy, further confrontation, and chaos. 
  One hundred and twenty of the total of 335 lawmakers have 
requested Kravchuk to suspend municipal, and call off the 26 
June presidential, elections. 
  Analysts feel the strong parliamentary support is indicative 
of the possibility of the postponement or suspension of the 
elections by the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet [Supreme Council]. 
Kravchuk may be expected to suggest that the Supreme Soviet 
postpone or call off the elections on 11 May when the Ukrainian 
legislature opens session. 
  Talking to newsmen Kravchuk doubted whether the parliament's 
moves to confirm the election day and define the head of state's 
prerogatives would be constitutionally valid now that only 335 
nominees had won seats in the 450-seat parliament. (The negative 
stand of 120 lawmakers makes it highly improbable that a 
resolution in favor of the elections pass -- IF). 
  But the Ukrainian Labor Congress urged the new body of the 
Supreme Soviet to see to it that the presidential elections be 
held as scheduled and insure the free expression of the people's 
will. 
  According to the Ukrainian Labor Congress, Kravchuk's 
foreign 
and domestic policy moves put under threat the territorial 
integrity of, and civic peace in, Ukraine. 
  The Ukrainian Labor Congress is a political party of 
left-centrist orientation. It won official recognition in 
September of 1993. The one-time chair of the parliament's youth 
commission Anatoliy Matvienko is its leader. 
  On Thursday Ukraine's Central Electoral Commission 
recognized 
former Prime-Minister Leonid Kuchma and Vice-Premier Viktor 
Pinzenik as presidential candidates. 
  Six men, including former speaker Ivan Plyushch of the 
national parliament, one-time Vice-Premier Vitaliy Lanovoy and 
Socialist leader Aleksandr Moroz, will be running for president. 
  According to the latest reports from Kiev, the Ukrainian 
Communist party, with its 80-odd seats in the new parliament, 
intends to support Moroz. IF Note: Communist leader Petr 
Simonenko sees his own nomination as untimely and explains it by 
the feeling of euphoria that reigned after his party carried the 
March 27 parliamentary elections. Simonenko told newsmen an 
analysis of the situation and views of the party's regional 
organizations moved the collective presidency of the party's 
Central Committee to call off his candidacy. That, according to 
Simonenko, was in full keeping with the Communists' negative 
view of presidency as such, in Ukraine. If the elections were, 
indeed, held, Simonenko said, the left-wing forces would have to 
present a united front and work for the election of Aleksandr 
Moroz. 
  In an interview with Interfax, Moroz said Friday that if 
Kravchuk decided to call off the June 26 elections, the 
Ukrainian coal miners would launch industrial action and force 
Kravchuk to revoke his own decision. 
  Moroz saw no legal grounds for the postponement of the 
presidential elections. If the president said he was out to 
protect the constitution, he said, let the president go a 
constitutional way about it. 
  But Moroz recognized the president's right to propose new 
legislation and suggest that the Supreme Soviet put off the 
elections.

  [Text] Simferopol -- In an exclusive interview with a UNIAN 
correspondent the other day, Mustafa Dzhemilev, chairman of the 
Majlis of the Crimean Tatar People, stated that in the event of 
a Ukrainian presidential election being held, Crimean Tatars 
would "definitely be against Leonid Kuchma." 
  "We have quite often discussed our problems with 
Interregional Bloc of Reforms [MBR] representatves -- and 
Volodymyr Hrynyov in particular. He tends to view Crimean Tatars 
as a Crimean ethnic minority. So if the choice is to be made 
between Leonid Kuchma and Leonid Kravchuk, we would prefer the 
latter. As for Ivan Plyushch, we have a bone to pick with him, 
too." 
  Forecasting the activity of the Crimean Tatar group in the 
Crimean Supreme Council, Mustafa Dzhemilev said they were 
offered cooperation by Rossiya bloc group members but that it 
was unacceptable. As for the Communists, the Majlis leader 
said, "we can hear their secretary, Leonid Hrach, making a lot 
of proposals that are not too bad. The Communists, however, 
have always been saying one thing and, once in power, doing 
another." 
  Mustafa Dzhemilev said that Yuriy Meshkov had suggested they 
should back Serhiy Tsekov, former Ukrainian people's deputy and 
supporter of the Rossiya bloc, as an appointee to the post of 
Crimean parliamentary speaker, with a Crimean Tatar 
representative then to be offered the post of deputy Supreme 
Council chairman. The Majlis chairman said: "We find such 
compromises deplorable and shall not accept them." The most 
fair thing to do, in his words, would be to elect Refat 
Chubarov, head of the Crimean Tatar deputies group, to the post 
of Crimean parliamentary speaker. However, his candidacy will 
not be put forward as he will stand no chance of winning. The 
Crimean Tatars are most likely not to back anyone to this post. 
  Mustafa Dzhemilev expressed the hope that the Crimean Tatars 
would succeed in appealing against the 14-seat quota granted to 
them by the previous Crimean Supreme Council. Yuriy Meshkov's 
statement that "the granting of even this quota was [former 
Crimean parliamentary speaker] Mykola Bahrov's error," was 
described by Mustafa Dzhemilev as nonpopulist and as an attempt 
to exert pressure on the Crimean Tatars. He added that the 
Crimean president's tactics might become the beginning of the 
end of his presidency."

  [Text] Ukraine's former Prime-Minister Leonid Kuchma stands 
the best chance to win the presidential race. According to the 
sociological service Sotcis-Gullap, 18 percent of the voters 
favored his candidacy in March. In December 16.6 percent of the 
voters did so. 
  The service polled a total of 1,200 people older than 15 
throughout Ukraine to find out that Viacheslav Chernovil (10 
percent in March and 9.1 percent in December) and President 
Leonid Kravchuk (11 percent in March and 16.5 in December) 
emerged as two other frontrunners. 
  The People's Rukh movement decided to refrain from running 
its own presidential nominee.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Viktor Demidenko, Mikhail </F>
Melnik] 
  [Text] Kiev 1 May TASS--leader of Ukrainian Communists Petr 
Simonenko, running for the Ukrainian presidency, withdrew his 
candidature following a two-hour confidential meeting with 
Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, a high-ranking official of 
the Ukrainian president's administration told ITAR-TASS today. 
However, he declined to give details of the meeting, saying 
that it was "secret." 
  It was not ruled out that Simonenko's step was a result of a 
thoroughly planned policy of opposition to the Ukrainian 
President Leonid Kravchuk and was aimed at consolidating voters 
in favour of a leader of a Socialist Party, Aleksandr Morozov. 
The move was apparently made to take advantage of the obvious 
disappointment of the Ukrainian population in the present 
leadership and its failure to ensure normal life in the country. 
  Apart from Leonid Kravchuk, taking part in the presidential 
race are Ukrainian Parliament Speaker Ivan Plyushch, Prime 
Minister Leonid Kuchma, Vice-Premiers Vladimir Lanovoy and 
Viktor Pinzenik, Education Minister Petro Talanchuk and one of 
the leaders of the Ukrainian Union of Entrepreneurs, Valeriy 
Babich. 
  Ivan Plyushch is said to stand the best chance of being 
elected as a supporter of concentrating executive power in the 
hands of one person within a system of soviets as a form of 
state system. 
  If Kravchuk fails to postpone elections, he will find it 
difficult to remain in his post.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report on statement issued by the Democratic </F>
Party of Ukraine in Kiev on 21 April] 
  [Text] The Presidium of the National Council of the 
Democratic Party of Ukraine has made public the party's appeal 
to the new Ukrainian Supreme Council. At this complex moment in 
history, the document states, in spite of your different 
political convictions, we hope that your civic consciousness and 
responsibility for the country's fate will not allow the country 
to fall into the abyss of legal chaos and economic collapse. 
This is exactly what foes of the independent Ukraine hope for. 
Their main goal is to disturb Ukraine's political stability and 
destroy its governing structures. This might result in a 
complete halt to reform, rampaging separatism, and a continued 
drop in production and the population's standard of living. In 
addition to this kind of social backdrop, the antigovernment 
forces still need the election of a new president with vague 
powers and several hundred unruly regional administration heads 
to aggravate legal chaos in the state and eventually, provoke 
social conflict. 
  The Democratic Party believes that the 26 June elections, so 
eagerly pressed for by enemies of our state, must not take 
place, because this would put us on the brink of the abyss. 
This election is irrelevant in terms of timing, the condition 
of society, etc. Here are some other reasons: The new 
constitution and a law on power have not yet been adopted; the 
former Supreme Council limited the president's term in office to 
less than three years. So, this election is unconstitutional in 
nature. As was the Supreme Council, the president was elected 
by a popular vote, and only the people can replace him with an 
early referendum. Aware of the danger looming over Ukraine, the 
Democratic Party calls for the Supreme Council and society to 
put an end to political games and postpone the elections until 
after necessary legal documents are adopted -- a constitution, 
first of all -- so that one could in a peaceful atmosphere 
resolve state problems, reforming the economy and thereby 
improving the people's well-being. 
  As a party of moderate politicians and people with common 
sense, the Democratic Party of Ukraine assumes full 
responsibility for declaring the following: the 26 June 
elections are a path to death, not the creation of a young state. 
  [Signed] On 21 April in Kiev.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Perkin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow 30 Apr -- "The most important thing for the 
Crimea now is to get real economic programs off the ground," 
Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov said today in an interview with 
ITAR-TASS. "We'll just hope they won't stop us doing that. 
  ``The makeup of Crimea's government has already been decided 
upon and there is cooperation with industrialists, entrepreneurs 
and agrarians. So now we're carrying out our planned economic 
aims," the president emphasized. He does not doubt that 
inhabitants of the peninsula support the line that has been 
taken. No groups, ethnic groupings or public movements are 
opposing it. 
  Yuriy Meshkov said that the newly elected Crimean Supreme 
Soviet would meet for its first session on 10 May. It is true 
that "the outgoing power is hanging on to every day, but these 
are the attempts of the doomed." In a word, everything is taking 
its course and the situation that has arisen on the peninsula 
does not worry the president. In his words, a businesslike 
situation is prevailing there, the supreme echelon of power has 
been established and everything is in working order. 
  "But that's inside our Republic, while outside it, in 
Ukraine, everything is a lot more complicated," Yuriy Meshkov 
stressed. "It is now clear that people have withdrawn their 
trust in Leonid Kravchuk and he has no support to stay in power. 
The only way he can achieve that is by creating tension and 
conflicts. You can see his hands reaching for the Crimea." 
  In the opinion of the president of the Crimea, evidence of 
this is provided by the actions of Ukrainian Defense Minister 
Vitaliy Radetskyy and attempts to deploy military units on the 
peninsula. This, Yuriy Meshkov is convinced, is all being done 
in order to keep Crimeans from dealing with the economy. It is 
this most of all which alarms and worries the Crimean president. 
  He is sure that the May holidays will, as always, proceed in 
a festive and good-humored manner in the Crimea. A march and 
demonstration on 1 May will start the holiday. On 2 May, 
partisans will get together for a May Day celebration. The 
first 10 days of May are full of famous dates in the Crimea 
--Sevastopol is celebrating the 50th anniversary of its 
liberation from the fascists while the whole peninsula is 
marking the anniversary of the Crimean constitution. Its towns 
are decorated and ready to receive thousands of visitors. 
Delegations from CIS countries and farther away are expected.

  [Text] During the Ukrainian Former Prime Minister Leonid 
Kuchma's visit to U.S. earlier this month, U.S. Administration 
officials repeatedly stressed that Russia should stay Ukraine's 
chief strategic partner. 
  Kuchma, currently leading the Ukrainian Union of 
Industrialists and Businessmen, met during his one week tour of 
the United States with Vice-President Albert Gore, the Commerce 
Secretary's Assistant Andrew Summers, and a number of eminent 
senators. 
  "This trip has changed my attitude to U.S. lawmakers," 
Kuchma 
said. 
  In his words, American Administration officials regard 
Ukraine as a state rather than single out any Ukrainian leader. 
  He said that during his meeting with the International 
Monetary Fund's President Camdessus, the IMF leader made it 
clear that the Foundation will not help Ukraine unless it sees a 
leadership that means business rather than words there. 
  "If people in East and West alike see positive processes 
underway, they will rally around them," said Kuchma, who is a 
registered candidate to the Ukrainian presidency. 
  Presidential elections in Ukraine will take place on 26 
June.

<F P=106> [Article by Mykola Bilovil, UKRAYINSKA HAZETA military </F>
columnist: "It Is for Good Reason That Admirals Bezkorovaynyy 
and Ryzhenko Are Sounding the Alarm"] 
  [Text] Two reprints from the newspapers SLAVA SEVASTOPOLYA 
and FLOT UKRAYINY have recently been discussed quite extensively 
and with concern by servicemen. The authors of the articles are 
extremely reputable people and, in my opinion, their positions 
and their proposals must be taken into account by Ukraine's 
minister of defense and by President Kravchuk in their actions 
and decisions, as these people know the state of affairs and the 
situation in the Crimea best of all. 
  Today, in the south of our fatherland and especially in 
Sevastopol, one can see the most intricate tangle of 
Ukrainian-Russian relations and contradictions. 
  Let me remind you that, in many of its publications, 
UKRAYINSKA HAZETA foresaw this development of events in the 
Black Sea Fleet. More than once, our newspaper sounded the alarm 
that Ukraine's sea borders remain either totally defenseless or 
will, together with our armed forces, be occupied by our 
northern neighbor. 
  Unfortunately, the leadership of the Ukrainian State thought 
differently. Nothing at all has been done by it to defend our 
sacred right to have our own navy and be a sea-faring power. On 
the contrary, everything was done in order to open channels for 
bringing this undertaking to naught. The most graphic example 
here is the removal from the post of Ukraine's defense minister 
of Colonel General Kostyantyn Morozov, who came out against the 
Massandra accords honestly, frankly, and openly. UKRAYINSKA 
HAZETA also wrote about this. To safeguard Ukrainian interests, 
General Morozov did not hesitate to disagree with the president, 
who was about to give Russia our entire Black Sea base. One can 
see now who was wrong. With the difference that General Morozov 
lost his post. Perhaps, our two supreme chief commanders 
[Kravchuk and Radetskyy] will pat attention to the hardships 
that the Ukrainian sailors are subjected to by the Russian 
"guests," more specifically, by the impudent masters of the 
situation." 
  Nor do some politicians overseas pay attention to the 
Ukrainian Armed Forces. For example, at the beginning of April, 
U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine W. Miller visited Sevastopol. For 
some reason, he rushed to meet with commander of the Black Sea 
Fleet Admiral Baltin -- Russia's plenipotentiary. This was 
confirmed to me by the Press Service of Ukraine's Naval Forces. 
It is also a surprising fact that nothing is known, neither 
there or in Kiev, about the objective, course, or results of the 
U.S. diplomat's visit. 
  Who needs this game between two fires? I believe that this 
is interference on the part of a foreign state into our internal 
affairs. Living in our home and going to neighbors. This is 
the kind of independence we have. Everybody ignores us, and our 
own people seem to encourage such an attitude. 
  It is on this matter that Vice Admiral Volodymyr 
Bezkorovaynyy and Rear Admiral Oleksiy Ryzhenko are sounding the 
alarm. It is to their credit that they risk their careers by 
caring about Ukraine's interests and tell us how our "sworn 
brothers," with whom we share the Black Sea, deceive us, and 
also demand that the leaders of our state return to Yalta 
Accords in dividing the Black Sea Fleet into Russian and 
Ukrainian parts. 
  Unfortunately, very unfortunately, so it seems to me, their 
voices do not reach our president's ear, heart, or mind. Why 
does he keep silence and does not react to the cold-blooded 
injustice that the Russian military leaders perpetrate on our 
land? 
  Today, Mr. Baltin only fulfills Russia's orders, introduces 
Russian symbols everywhere and dismisses, on various pretenses, 
those servicemen who have pledged allegiance to Ukraine.... 
  Who is then the guest and who is the host? Who will defend 
Ukrainian sailors, expected to defend Ukraine? This is a 
paradox of an independent country. The country is dependent and 
it appears that so is its president. 
  However, upon whom?

autonomous republic of Crimea told INTERFAX that Ukraine had in 
the last few days increased its National Guard contingent in the 
Crimean capital Simferopol. 
  But the ministry does not know exactly how many National 
Guards are currently stationed in the city, the source said. 
  However, other sources in Simferopol said there are more 
than 
2,500 National Guards in the city, which is being patrolled by 
details of four or five National Guards with truncheons, an 
officer and several armed police.

  [Text] Among the events that could have a fairly noticeable 
effect on our further life is the decision by Ukraine's Cabinet 
of Ministers on the indexation of the nominal value of 
accommodation vouchers. Their value has been established at 
420,000 karbovantsi. Further indexation is to be carried out in 
proportion to changes in the nominal value of privatization 
property certificates. At the same time, the new value of the 
vouchers should be 40 percent of the new value of the 
certificates.

<F P=106> [Report by Vitaliy Dymarskiy, RIA-NOVOSTI correspondent, </F>
from Paris specially for SEGODNYA under the "Problem" rubric: 
"Yevgeniy Saburov Considers Crimea a Region of Political 
Stability, but Fears Kiev's Resistance to Economic Reform"] 
  [Excerpt] Yevgeniy Saburov, science chief of the Russian 
Government's Information and Social Technologies Center and 
Crimean deputy prime minister, who is on a visit to Paris as a 
participant in the conference "How To Do Business in Russia," 
told your correspondent in an exclusive interview that talk 
about political instability in Crimea was an insinuation by the 
mass media, because if this were really so foreign capital would 
not have come there. But at present there are a number of 
foreign companies, including French ones, operating in Crimea, 
whose economic potential is oriented toward Russian markets. 
  Yevgeniy Saburov pointed to a difference in principle 
between 
his current activity and what he did in Vladimir Oblast, where, 
he said, significant successes were achieved. Crimea, unlike 
Russian regions, is a fairly independent entity that has its 
own, albeit incomplete, statehood. Its prospects, the Crimean 
deputy prime minister said, depend on drastic changes in 
legislation, and this is its main difference from the Russian 
situation. Few people know, Yevgeniy Saburov said, that three 
edicts have already been signed -- on taxes, on currency 
regulation, and on banks. "The Kiev authorities," he added, 
"have assured me that any economic transformations will only be 
welcome, but I have information that they are already beginning 
to put up some resistance. If Ukraine really treated us as its 
own territory, and the Crimean population as its own population, 
they would have hardly resorted to such actions." 
  "Initially it seemed to me," Yevgeniy Saburov continued, 
"that there is no political bottom line to the Crimean issue, 
but only a financial problem, particularly the splitting of the 
Black Sea Fleet. In this case the issue is who will have the 
right to sell decommissioned ships and who will receive lease 
payments -- Ukraine or Crimea. Facts show that Kiev wants to 
have this money for itself, although it is Crimea that supplies 
Sevastopol with water, food, and all the rest. I think such 
conduct is unethical." 
  At the same time, Yevgeniy Saburov went on, political 
implications of the problem are becoming more and more visible. 
Kiev is doing its utmost to hamper integrationist processes in 
Crimea, fearing that it may lose not only the peninsula, but 
also Donbass, Lugansk, Nikolayev, and Odessa -- a vast territory 
that accounts for over one-half of Ukraine and, like Crimea, is 
attracted by Russia. "I would like to deal with purely economic 
matters, but I understand that I will also have to tackle 
political problems, although I am not at all enthusiastic about 
that," Yevgeniy Saburov stated. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The president of Ukraine has signed an edict on 
introducing into circulation state commodity bonds of Ukraine's 
material resources. The Ukrainian credit fund has been 
designated as the issuing body. The funds received from the 
sale of the bonds on a competitive basis are to be invested in 
programs to develop and modernize enterprises. Foreign currency 
revenue from the sale of the bonds, received by enterprises to 
carry out the development programs, is counted as credit funds 
and is not subject to compulsory sale or taxation. 
  The bonds are issued in series. The president of Ukraine 
takes the decision to issue each series. The edict envisages 
the issue of the first series of bonds, numbering 400 units with 
a nominal value of $25 million each -- a total value of $10 
billion, on terms of payment of 7.75 percent annual interest.

  [Text] The Ukrainian cabinet of ministers has decided on 
resuming work at one of the enterprises in the town of Pripet, 
which is located inside the 30 km exclusion zone around the 
Chernobyl nuclear power station. This decision was made in 
connection with the need to provide for the functioning of 
Ukraine's nuclear power industry and meet its requirements for 
spares and nonstandard equipment. Work at Pripet's industrial 
enterprises was halted on 26 April 1986 -- the day of the 
disaster at Chernobyl nuclear power station.

[Moldovan] President Mircea Snegur and Dniester Republic leader 
Igor Smirnov made a joint statement on Saturday outlining ways 
to resolve the Dniester conflict. 
  The statement signed in presence of representatives of the 
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) and 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin's envoys said that a new social 
and political situation has emerged in the republic, creating 
prerequisites for successful resolution of the crisis. 
  Both leaders welcomed the mediatory role of CSCE and the 
Russian Federation in settling the Dniester conflict. 
  Snegur and Smirnov stressed the need to determine the status 
of the Dniester Republic, establish official relations, delegate 
and delineate powers and fix up a transitional period for 
gradual implementation of reached agreements in all spheres. 
  The document also calls for establishing firm guarantees, 
including with international participation, ensuring full and 
unconditional implementation of these agreements.

  [Text] Dushanbe, 1 May--Militants of the Tajik opposition 
confiscated today the cargo that had been delivered by an AN-26 
aircraft [as received] of the military transport aviation corps 
of Uzbekistan at the Khorog airport, the administrative center 
of Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast. 
  The ITAR-TASS correspondent learned from well-informed 
sources in Tajikistan that the Defense Ministry of Uzbekistan 
has confirmed that the cargo of "humanitarian aid" had indeed 
been prepared to be sent to Gornyy Badakhshan 
[Gorno-Badakhshan]. However, Tajikistan had not been informed 
about the exact time the aircraft would cross the state border. 
  The aircraft landed at 1500 hours local time (1200 Moscow 
time) at the Khorog airport. After the landing of the AN-26, 
the landing strip and all access routes to the airport were 
surrounded by militants of a unit belonging to the "Tajik 
self-defense forces", under the command of Yedgor Mamadaslamov. 
The cargo was seized and taken away. 
  In this connection, military sources in Dushanbe are not 
ruling out that there might be some contacts between certain 
forces in Uzbekistan and militants in Pamir, which are 
influencing the situation in the region. 
  There has been no official reaction from the Tajikistan 
Government.

<F P=106> [Romain Franklin report: "In Tashkent, Islam Karimov Has </F>
Silenced the Dissidents"] 
  [Text] Tashkent -- Despite his popularity as strong man, 
Uzbek President Islam Karimov, who received 86 percent of the 
votes in the December 1991 presidential election, is displaying 
a ferocity against dissidents which diplomats and oppositionists 
readily compare to the "era of Brezhnevian repression." 
Tolerated at the time of the declaration of the country's 
independence in August 1991, the opposition now seems completely 
drained. The Birlik movement (nationalist Unity movement), 
which organized mass demonstrations, was banned in February 
1993; the Erk party (whose leader obtained 12 percent of the 
votes in the 1991 presidential election) has not been officially 
"registered" since last October. One is now operating from 
Moscow and the other from Turkey. The last eight prominent 
members of the Erk party still in Uzbekistan, including Otanazar 
Aripov, the movement's spokesman and secretary, were arrested at 
the beginning of March and have since disappeared. 
  Francois Mitterrand, who has just completed a visit to 
Uzbekistan on Wednesday, made his little speech on human rights, 
stating in Tashkent that "the right to criticize is the 
precondition for social, economic, and cultural progress." To 
this Islam Karimov replied that it was "difficult to change 
people's mentality" when economic conditions are still bad, and 
reaffirmed that this country had "emerged from the entrails of a 
totalitarian system," of which he, as a former apparatchik, was 
the instrument. President Karimov in particular brandished the 
horrible spectacle of neighboring Tajikistan, where the conflict 
between the former communist government and an armed Islamic 
opposition ended in a bloodbath. 
  The fact remains that the methods of the former leader of 
the 
Communist Party, who became president of this Central Asian 
country of 20 million inhabitants, are scarcely different from 
those of the former KGB. At least four prominent members of the 
opposition have been beaten up, some very seriously, by the 
Uzbek internal security forces in the space of a year. 
  On the occasion of the visit by his "friend" Francois 
Mitterrand, the Uzbek president announced that parliamentary 
elections "which he had promised but which had not been 
mentioned for months" would take place "before the end of the 
year." However, in view of the turn things have taken, it is 
unlikely that the two main opposition parties, now in exile, 
will be allowed to put forward candidates. Only the former 
Communist Party (rechristened Democratic People's Party), of 
which Islam Karimov is the leader, and the two parties recently 
created at his instigation, are "officially registered."

<F P=106> ["Appeal by the Federation Council of the Russian Federation </F>
Federal Assembly to the Russian Federation President in 
Connection With the Russian Federation President's Message to 
the Federal Assembly "On Strengthening the Russian State"] 
  [Text] Esteemed Boris Nikolayevich! 
  A thorough study of the Russian Federation president's 
message to the Federal Assembly "On Strengthening the Russian 
State (Main Areas of Domestic and Foreign Policy)" has been 
completed in the committees and commissions of the Federation 
Council of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly. Specific 
measures have been outlined, whose implementation via the 
Federation Council will guarantee steady cooperation among all 
the branches of power in the interests of democracy and 
prosperity in Russia. 
  We welcome the political desire expressed by the Russian 
Federation president in his message to further pursue the 
reforms course and unite all constructive forces in society with 
a view to carrying out systematic, joint, and creative work for 
the good of the country and its citizens in order to strengthen 
the Russian state. 
  We view the pact on achieving civil accord in Russia as an 
important step in implementing the Russian Federation 
president's message, enabling us to establish democratic control 
over the commitments taken on by all branches of power, parties, 
and social organizations and movements. 
  We share the Russian Federation president's view that in 
Russia today there is no firmer basis for achieving civil accord 
in society, emerging from the crisis, and successfully 
continuing progressive transformations than the Russian 
Federation Constitution, adopted by nationwide vote in December 
1993. Our task is to realize in practice the full potential of 
our state's fundamental law. 
  In this connection the Federation Council supports the 
proposal by the Russian Federation president to establish a 
united constitutional commission and a united working group to 
coordinate and enhance the effectiveness of legislative 
activity. In formulating plans for legislative work, the 
Federation Council will be guided exclusively by its own 
constitutional powers and the standing orders of the first 
convocation of the Federation Council formulated on the basis of 
the Russian Federation Constitution. 
  The message rightly stresses that power in a rule-of-law 
state is bound by the law. The place and extremely important 
role of the Federal Assembly and its chambers within the 
existing political system in Russia is determined by this fact. 
We share the concern expressed in the message that practical 
mechanisms for promoting democracy in Russia are underdeveloped. 
At the present time work has been initiated by the Federation 
Council within the limits of the chambers' powers as enshrined 
by the Russian Federation Constitution to create effective legal 
mechanisms of power within the Russian state both at the federal 
level and in the components of the Federation. 
  The Federation Council supports the Russian Federation 
president's stance regarding the need to find a sensible 
relationship between the speed of reforms and the real social 
cost of the reforms, bringing into play all available reserves 
including effective state regulation compatible with market 
mechanisms. 
  We believe it necessary at federal, regional, and local 
level to urgently implement a set of measures to achieve actual 
realization of the provisions of the Russian Federation 
president's message. 
  We favor constructive and reliable cooperation among all the 
federal power structures. We hereby announce our refusal to 
countenance any contradictions dictated by the interests of 
political opportunism that hamper the normal exercise of the 
Russian Federation president's powers and those of the Russian 
Federation Government. 
  At the same time we are entitled to count on a similarly 
responsible attitude from the Russian Federation president and 
the Russian Federation Government regarding problems on which 
the Federation Council focuses its attention. To date, 
unfortunately, there have been several occasions when appeals by 
the Federation Council on extremely acute problems of economics 
and politics have not met with an appropriate response from the 
executive branch. 
  For all the different peoples who live in our state, 
regardless of their ethnic, religious, and linguistic groupings, 
this country is their common home. None of them should be 
placed in an unequal legal or moral position. It is 
particularly important to stress this fact today, when the 
country is making the transition from a monopoly ideology to 
cultural diversity. In accordance with the spirit of the 
Russian Federation president's message, the Federation Council 
is exercising all its constitutional powers to restore, 
strengthen, and develop the values of this Russian superethnic 
community which is unique in the world. 
  In its daily cooperation with the State Duma, the Russian 
Federation president, and the Russian Federation Government, the 
Federation Council intends to actively establish constructive 
political, economic, scientific, and cultural ties among all 
components of the Federation and to strengthen the planned 
accord among political parties and national, social, and 
political movements. 
  Once again stressing its fundamental agreement with the 
spirit and letter of the message, the Federation Council 
insistently requests the Russian Federation president and 
Russian Federation Government to make every possible effort to 
encourage strict observance of the provisions and standards of 
the nationally adopted Russian Federation Constitution, the 
Federation Treaty, and Russian Federation laws, and to create 
favorable conditions for the rigorous implementation of these 
provisions and norms. 
  We believe it necessary to speed up the preparation of a 
program of practical actions across the entire spectrum of 
domestic and foreign policy areas formulated in the Russian 
Federation president's message. 
  The Federation Council sees the path to strengthening the 
Russian state lying through united political will, civil accord, 
and cooperation among all the branches of power and the citizens 
of Russia, and it will make every effort to encourage rapid 
progress along this path. 
  [Signed] The Federation Council of the Russian Federation 
Federal Assembly

  [Text] President Yeltsin's press service says that Boris 
Yeltsin and Guntis Ulmanis will meet at tentatively 1100, Moscow 
time, on Saturday. 
  The two national leaders will be expected to sign a number 
of 
documents. 
  In Friday's interview with INTERFAX, chief Sergey Zotov of 
the Russian delegation to the negotiations with Latvia said that 
in Moscow Ulmanis would be expected to sign the whole package of 
military agreements (a basic agreement on the withdrawal of the 
Russian troops from Latvia, an agreement on the 5.5-year lease 
of the Skrunda radar station, an agreement on the social 
protection of the withdrawing Russian servicemen, and an 
agreement on the social protection of the retired Russian 
servicemen and their families). 
  According to Zotov, the Russian and Latvian Government 
delegations closed around of negotiations in Jurmala, Thursday 
[28 April]. On Latvian request they drew up an additional 
protocol to the agreement on the social protection of the 
retired Russian servicemen and their families. 
  The protocol provided for the creation of special funds, 
endowments and organizations for the solution of problems that 
would arise in the course of the servicemen's voluntary 
repatriation. Foreign sources, too, would be allowed to finance 
the repatriation. 
  The protocol eliminated what remained of the Latvian 
objections to the whole package of bilateral agreements. So, 
Zotov said, the road was clear for Ulmanis' visit to Moscow.

  [Text] Moscow 30 April TASS -- Latvian President Guntis 
Ulmanis arrived in Moscow today to meet Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin. 
  The visit of the Latvian president has materialised due to 
the agreement reached at the Russo-Latvian negotiations to 
coordinate an additional protocol to the earlier initialled 
document -- on social protection for military pensioners living 
in Latvia. The package of bilateral agreements will be 
discussed at negotiations of the two presidents in the Kremlin. 
  The visit of Guntis Ulmanis to Moscow planned for an earlier 
timeframe was put off because of the stance of the Latvian Sejm. 
Deputies did not want the package of agreements to include the 
above-mentioned document on social guarantees for retired 
military. The Russian side insisted on the discussion of all the 
four agreements, including Russian troop withdrawal from Latvia, 
the status of the radar in Skrunda, social protection for the 
military during the troop withdrawal and guarantees for military 
pensioners. President Yeltsin succeeded in clearing the obstacle 
to the summit.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Anna Melnikova and Yuriy </F>
Sizov] 
  [Text] Moscow, 30 Apr -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin 
has declared in his interview to an ITAR-TASS correspondent 
after the ceremony in which a package of bilateral documents 
were signed: "The Russian-Latvian documents signed today in the 
Kremlin have been elaborated with the full consent by the both 
sides." 
  The head of the Russian state said that "as a whole, five 
documents have been signed: the Treaty and four agreements in 
which, in particular, the protection of servicemen was 
determined and the question of pensioners and former servicemen 
was solved." 
  Boris Yeltsin paid special attention to the treaty signed by 
him and Guntis Ulmanis, which ensured the withdrawal of Russian 
troops from the territory of Latvia. He said that "the final 
date of the withdrawal was determined to be 31 August." In 
addition he said that "the Russian side will try to do this as 
soon as possible because we want children of the servicemen to 
go to school in Russia already this 1 September." 
  The president also said that during the negotiations the 
delegations of the both countries "worked on about 10 economic 
documents as well." In this connection he underlined that "the 
presidents of the two countries have reached an agreement that 
the questions on free trade, the regime of the most favored 
nations on a mutual and equal basis, taxation, tariffs, and 
duties will be prepared by a special group and Russian Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin will visit Riga where the signing 
of these documents will take place." 
  Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis answered a question by the 
ITAR-TASS correspondent and said that in one of the documents 
signed today "we were talking about the regime of the most 
favored nations between the two countries." He believes that 
"this is a very valuable achievement." He said that 
entrepreneurs of the both countries can now breathe freely 
because, speaking frankly, the politics "minded its own 
business, and the economy suffered from that."

broadcasting Easter services from churches of various religious 
confessions, while this morning the Socialist Party called on 
people to attend an officially sanctioned May Day rally and 
march to the Lenin monument to lay flowers. 
  At this moment there are three demonstrations in progress in 
Moscow. They are being organized by the Federation of Trade 
Unions, the Moscow Labor [Trudovaya Moskva] Movement, the 
Liberal Patriotic Party of Rebirth, and a bloc of communist 
parties. 
  Today, for the first of time in recent years, International 
Labor Day is being celebrated in Yerevan. The workforces of 
dozens of Yerevan's enterprises and institutions will turn out 
for a rally in the city. 
  An unsanctioned May Day rally is planned to be held on the 
central square of Bishkek by the Civic Council [Grazhdanskiy 
sovet]. This Kyrgyz public organization was set up two months 
ago under the aegis of the republic's legal rights movement to 
defend the rights of pensioners and the needy.

  [Text] Talks on ways of settling the Karabakh conflict 
between the Karabakh leaders and the CSCE's Minsk group, led by 
Swedish diplomat Matias Mosberg, ended in Stepanakert on 
Saturday. 
  The Karabakh Foreign Ministry's press service informed 
Interfax that the main accent was put on mechanisms of excluding 
combat operations. To quote a representative of the press 
service, the delegation members stated that they would be able 
to place their observers three days after the conclusion of a 
long-term cease-fire agreement between the conflicting parties. 
  The negotiating parties also agreed not to adopt documents 
unconfirmed by real mechanisms of ruling out combat operations, 
and emphasized the importance of dovetailing the peace efforts 
of the CSCE and Russia. They also noted that certain steps had 
been made in this direction. 
  On the same day, CSCE military experts and the Karabakh 
commanders discussed military-technical problems pertaining to 
the location of observers in the zone of combat operations.

  [Text] On 29 April Georgian Head of State Eduard 
Shevardnadze made a brief visit to western Georgia. Here is 
Mikhail Mamulashvili reporting from Tbilisi: 
  [Mamulashvili] The main aim of Eduard Shevardnadze's visit 
to 
the western part of the republic was the desire to see for 
himself the state of affairs in the regions. This time, the 
head of state visited two rayons - Zugdidskiy and 
Tsalendzhikhskiy - which until recently were at the center of 
the Zviadist movement. 
  You will recall that it was here that the main events during 
the armed confrontation between government troops and armed 
supporters of the ex-president took place. The last time 
Shevardnadze was in Tsalendzhikha was two years ago. Back then 
he was obliged to endure reproaches and insults from people who 
considered Zviad Gamsakhurdia the only legitimate leader of the 
country. 
  On 29 April, things were different. The press service of the 
Georgian head of state informed me that Shevardnadze was given 
the warm welcome typically accorded by the inhabitants of that 
region. He met with the inhabitants of Tsalendzhikha, the heads 
of the local administration, representatives of the 
intelligentsia and local workers. 
  Speaking to the inhabitants of Tsalendzhikha, Shevardnadze 
stressed that Georgia is now going through a bad patch. We want 
to build a democratic state and that's why we all have to work 
instead of sitting down with our arms folded. 
  Touching on the situation in Abkhazia -- and inhabitants of 
Tsalendzhikha are particularly anxious about this question since 
their rayon borders Abkhazia and there are a large number of 
refugees in Tsalendzhikha itself -- Shevardnadze said that all 
matters and problems connected with that region would in all 
probability be solved in the near future. 
  The head of state was accompanied on his trip to western 
Georgia by Vakhtang Goguadze, speaker of the Georgian 
parliament, Prime Minster Otar Patatsia, and other officials.

  [Text] President Yeltsin does not intend to resign before 
his term is up. He declared in an interview with ABC on Friday 
that no matter how complex that might be, he was fully 
determined to make reforms in Russia irreversible. "Much has 
befallen my lot -- said the president. -- I often think of 
resigning. But the capital restructuring with me involved has 
got underway. This restructuring should be brought to 
irreversible reforms, and for this reason, I drop this thought 
of resignation. Before June 1996, I will not go," Yeltsin 
declared. 
  He also disclosed that not long ago members of his team, "15 
men or so" from presidential structures and government, "sharply 
rebuked" him for his earlier expressed refusal to be nominated 
for a second term. "I gave my word to all of them that I will 
never answer these questions, even indirectly," Yeltsin remarked. 
  Asked about the state and prospects of Russian-American 
relations, he voiced readiness to sign a partnership treaty with 
the US. However, in his words, it should be signed along with 
a protocol on arms parity, in which both sides should identify 
the kinds and types of their weapons. 
  In this connection, Yeltsin fully ruled out the possibility 
of biological weapon production in Russia, even without his 
knowledge. "This is out of the question, he stressed. The 
former leadership allowed cheating. The biological weapons have 
been scrapped, as for the chemical weapons, we seek to destroy 
them within the agreed terms." 
  On the situation in the Balkans, Yeltsin voiced the 
conviction that air strikes would not resume. He denounced the 
Bosnian Serbs for "not keeping their word."

  [Text] Moscow, 30 Apr -- Boris Yeltsin, president of the 
Russian Federation, has issued an edict approving a program 
developed by the top staff of the Institute of State and Law of 
the Russian Academy of Sciences concerning carrying out in 
1994-95 a comprehensive political and legal study on "Ways and 
Forms of Strengthening the Russian State." He also approved the 
main directions of the program for this study. An ITAR-TASS 
correspondent was informed of this today by the press service of 
the president of the Russian Federation. 
  According to this information, the main directions of the 
research program comprises six sections, the priority one being 
the development of the legal system of the Russian Federation 
following the adoption of the new constitution of the Russian 
Federation. It was noted that first and foremost it was 
necessary to ensure that such principles of a rule-of-law state 
as the state being bound by law, the supremacy of law, the 
guarantee of human rights and freedoms, the division and mutual 
restraint of powers are consistently executed in the 
constitutional and present legislation of the Russian 
Federation. 
  Preparation of a whole package of legislation on social and 
legal protection for citizens is urgently needed now that Russia 
is a social-oriented state. This is said in the section called 
"The Individual in the World Today -- State Guarantees of 
Constitutional Status" of the document on basic directions. 
  It stressed that confirmation of the individual, his rights 
and freedoms, is a supreme value in the Russian Federation. 
This, along with the recognition that the state's main 
obligation is to protect the rights and freedoms of the 
individual and the citizen predetermine the necessity to perfect 
existing legislature and to work out and adopt new normative 
acts (which are either directly envisaged by the constitution of 
the Russian Federation, or are implied by them). 
  Further work on a federal anti-crime program is considered 
extremely important along with the adoption of a new criminal 
and civil procedure code, of a code on abuse of office, of laws 
against organized crime and corruption - needed to protect the 
individual from criminal arbitrariness. The research program 
draws attention to the fact that the institute of president, of 
head of state in Russia has acquired new state and legal 
substance. A parliament - a Federal Assembly - has been formed. 
The legal status of the Government, its place in the division 
of power, has been fundamentally changed. Judicial reform is 
under way, aimed at transforming the court into a genuinely 
independent "branch" of state power. One of the priority tasks 
of legal reform is to make federal state power an institution in 
legislation. In this sphere, it is necessary, it says in the 
political and legal research project, to work out and adopt such 
acts as a Law on the Government of the Russian Federation, a 
law, or general clause, on federal ministries, state committees 
and other federal bodies of executive power (including 
territorial), laws on the bases for setting up executive power 
bodies within the components of the Russian Federation, on 
federal bureaucracy, the judicial system, the Constitutional 
Court of the Russian Federation, the Supreme Court of the 
Russian Federation and a number of other laws. 
  Seeing Russia as a federative state based on the principle 
of 
the unity of the basic parts of the state system, on the 
principle of equality between the entities of the Russian 
Federation, of the supremacy of federal law, it is proposed that 
we also work out and adopt a number of laws, in particular, on 
the procedure for changing the constitutional status of an 
entity of the Russian Federation, on forming a new entity of the 
Russian Federation, and on registering a new entity in the 
Russian Federation. The authors of the program believe the 
Russian Federation should set out in legislation the principles 
for delimiting the areas of authority and the terms for mutual 
delegation (transfer) of power "along vertical lines," from the 
federation to entities within the federation and the other way 
round. 
  The idea has been put forward of transforming the territory 
of the former USSR into a single humanitarian area, where the 
rights of the Russian-speaking population - in countries of the 
"near abroad" - are guaranteed. Such an area would help solve 
the problem of forced migration. A Eurasian Commission for 
Human Rights and a Eurasian Court of Human Rights could serve as 
instruments supporting such a legal structure, the authors of 
the basic directions believe. They also say a Eurasian Charter 
(Convention) of human rights and rights of peoples should be 
prepared and adopted. 
  The research program also attributes importance to the 
Russian state's economic role and to Russia's role in the world 
community.

<F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast: Video report by S. Sokolova, </F>
identified by caption] 
  [Text] [Sokolova over video of truck-mounted missile 
travelling down a forest track] The Plesetsk test range is 30 
years old. Since the disintegration of the Union it is the only 
Russian test range from which satellites as well as missiles can 
be launched. Incidentally, last year the world's first 
communications satellite was launched into orbit from here 
aboard an ICBM. 
  The latest missile systems have been tested here. Four of 
them now form the main component of the Russian missile forces 
and are used for alert duty. 
  Under START II, the Plesetsk computer and information center 
is processing and analyzing telemetric information on both its 
own and the U.S. launches. The United States, in turn, receives 
all the requisite information about our missile systems. 
  According to specialists, Plesetsk is the most hardworking 
test range in the world. Up to 70 percent of the launches of 
various satellites and rockets [raketa] carried out in the world 
take place here. True, as from this year the number of launches 
has sharply decreased. The reasons for this are many, but the 
main one is the shortage of funds. This is why commercial 
satellites will also be launched from Plesetsk in the future. 
Fortunately, applications from Russian and Western companies 
have already been received. [video shows various closeups of 
truck-mounted missiles on forest track, soldiers changing

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 29/4/1994 -- "The declaration 
of Moldovan and Dniester leaders," signed by Mircea Snegur and 
Igor Smirnov on April 28th, "is another step of the process of 
Bessarabia's subjugation to Russian interests," states the 
declaration of the Christian-Democratic Popular Front of Moldova 
[FPCDM]. According to it, "Moscow representatives who hold the 
key posts in Moldova seriously injured our national interests 
and undermined Moldova's independence and unity" with this new 
agreement between Chisinau and Tiraspol. The April 28th 
declaration implies official recognition of the "Dniester 
Moldovan Republic" which is considered synonymous with Moldova. 
The declaration says that the presence of the CSCE mission at 
this meeting mars the prestige of this international 
organization and makes "it an advocate of Russian imperial 
policy." The FPCDM "considers that the deal on April 28th aims 
at annulling the national unified state and jeopardizes the 
nation's fundamental right to self-determination," concludes the 
declaration.

  [Text] Tiraspol BASAPRESS, 30/4/1994 -- The Dniester 
Republic Women's Union (TWU), which is considered an extreme 
branch of the separatist movement in eastern Moldova, sent a 
message to Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Defense Minister 
Pavel Grachev accusing General Aleksandr Lebed [commander of the 
14th Russian Army stationed in Dniester] of attempting to 
liquidate the self-proclaimed Dniester Republic. The message 
says that if Lebed ignores the Dniester legislation on 
Tiraspol's right to possess the 14th Army's property, the women 
will enchain themselves arm in arm with their children to 
prevent the evacuation of the Russian military troops and 
equipment from the Dniester region. The TWU asks Yeltsin to 
dismiss General Lebed as the 14th Army's commander. It also 
demands Russia's recognition of the self-proclaimed Dniester 
Republic. The TWU warns Yeltsin not to use the Dniester region 
"as a medium of exchange in political games."

Ilascu, the wife of the political prisoner Ilie Ilascu, visited 
with her husband for two hours at the Hlinaia Jail in 
Grigoriopol district. She took with her holy water, wafer, 
Easter cake, and red eggs, hallowed by father Vasile Petrache, 
vicar of the Chisinau St. Nicholas Church of the Bessarabian 
Metropolitan See (old style.) Ilie Ilascu thanked father Vasile 
Petrache for the holy gifts and recalled the confession he made 
last year behind bars on the stage of the Tiraspol house 
Kirovet, where a judicial and political farce was occurring. 
Nina Ilascu told BASAPRESS that Ilie Ilascu's health is 
deteriorating: He has pains in his liver and stomach. Ilascu 
is isolated from information sources. He reconfirmed his 
decision not to petition to the Tiraspol leaders for pardon and 
awaits decisive actions to be made by the Moldovan Parliament 
and president.

<F P=106> [Article by Ion Sofroniye, Moldovan Government press </F>
secretary: "Russian Has Not Renounced Imperial Claims"] 
  [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] -- The whole world knows that 
there are influential forces in Russia dreaming of reviving the 
USSR. THE NEW YORK TIMES recently published an article 
headlined "Russian Imperialism Is Stronger Than Soviet Power," 
claiming that "Russia is striving to restore its former empire." 
It was this trend that Valeriya Novodvorskaya saw and condemned 
in IZVESTIYA (4 March 1994) in an article entitled "I Do Not 
Love the State." Two academics dealt her a very prompt rebuff 
in the same newspaper. They wrote among other things: "Were it 
up to Mrs. Novodvorskaya, the Russian-speaking population of the 
Dniester Region should be handed over to Romania as the People's 
Front want." But what if the population does not want that? 
  There are a number of inaccuracies in this talk about the 
Dniester Region. What is the "Russian-speaking population"? In 
one of his interviews in the Moscow press, Kazakhstani President 
Nursultan Nazarbayev said the following about this term: "I do 
not accept the concept of `Russian-speaking population.' Which 
of us is not a Russian speaker? After all, the whole of 
Kazakhstan speaks Russian, including 99 percent of Kazakhs." 
  That is the linguistic situation in the Republic of Moldova 
today, with the possible exception that 100 percent of Moldovans 
here speak Russian. 
  Clearly, the authors of the devastating article in IZVESTIYA 
were referring to the Russian population in the Dniester Region. 
But in that case they should have known that the overwhelming 
majority of the Republic of Moldova's Russian population live 
not in the Dniester Region, in other words on the left bank, but 
on the right bank of the Dniester River. If you follow the 
authors' logic, the Russian population of Kishinev, Beltsy, 
Bendery, and other population centers on the Right Bank are in 
very great danger of being handed over to Romania. And if that 
is the case, a Russian Army should be massed on the right bank 
and the so-called Dniester Moldavian Republic set up. But that 
is absurd! 
  There is a second misunderstanding. Neither Left Bank nor 
Right Bank Russians, or Ukrainians, Moldovans, Gagauz, and 
representatives of other nationalities are threatened with being 
"handed over to Romania." Since during a 6 March 1994 
sociological poll the overwhelming majority of the population of 
the Republic of Moldova advocated building an independent, 
integral, and indivisible state. And whereas some people 
previously played on the threat of Moldova's joining another 
state in order to somehow justify separatism and a foreign 
army's sojourn on its territory, it is now time to renounce this 
claim which is known to be false. 
  It is better to tell the truth, as a specialist on nearby 
foreign countries did in Moscow's international newspaper 
MEGAPOLIS-EXPRESS (No. 9). We quote: "The territory of the 
Dniester Region (that is the eastern rayons of the Republic of 
Moldova -- Author's Note) where the Russian 14th Army is 
stationed is of exceptional military-strategic importance for 
Russia and it therefore seems quite logical for a permanent 
Russian military base to be set up there. During the special 
period [osobyy period] this base will perform the function of an 
advance detachment, ensuring the arrival and deployment of the 
strategic grouping of Russian troops in this sector." 
  It is because of these aspirations, Messrs. Academics, that 
Valeriya Novodvorskaya does not like the state. It is not a 
question of the rights of the "Russian-speaking population," 
which no one is violating, but of Russia's special 
military-strategic interests. It is necessary to call a spade a 
spade; particularly for doctors of historical sciences.

  [Text] Is it possible to work for the future under the 
economic crisis and not to be afraid of bankrupcy? A positive 
answer to this question was given by Ukan Atabayev, president of 
Karatau, the republic's largest holding company, to [Kazakh 
President] Nazarbayev who paid a working visit to Zhambyl Oblast 
yesterday and today. The head of the republic was greatly 
interested in products manufactured by the joint 
Kazakhstani-Israeli venture set up at the Khimprom production 
amalgamation, namely corrugated and smooth-surfaced pipes made 
from polypropylene. Nazarbayev expressed his satisfaction with 
the hard work of the Zhambyl chemistry workers. In a difficult 
situation they did not begin to complain and pin hopes on the 
government to tackle all their problems. Their products are of 
high quality, competitive, and highly profitable. 
  The head of state had a lively and interesting conversation 
with workers who felt very much at ease with him. First of all, 
they talked about strengthenning ties of friendship between 
representatives of various nationalities. Unfortunately, this 
friendship has been lost in a number of the former USSR 
republics. Traditionally good interethnic relations are 
maintained in Kazakhstan, but it does not mean that one can sit 
back and allow such an important issue to be developed on its 
own. 
  They also discussed dual citizenship. The president said: 
"My opinion in this case is very unequivocal. Let the people 
themselves freely choose which country they want to live in, and 
then that country must give them citizenship quickly and without 
any obstacles. This would be better than having two passports 
and being indecisive for all of one's life where to reside." 
  The president also had a warm meeting with orphaned 
children from the Ulan orphanage in Zhambyl. Children told him 
about their life and performed a concert. 
  Nursultan Nazarbayev left for Kyrgyzstan today.

  [Text] A visit to Budapest by an official Kazakh delegation 
led by Deputy Foreign Minister Konstantin Zhigalov was devoted 
to examination of the possibilities to deepen and broaden 
political and economic integration between Hungary and 
Kazakhstan. The guests from Almaty visited one of the largest 
Hungarian enterprises -- the Videoton joint stock production 
amalgamation, whose products are well known on the former USSR 
market. The Kazakh delegation was interested first of all in 
the progress of privatization of large Hungarian enterprises, in 
the level of involvement of working collectives in this process. 
  According to one of the leaders of Videoton, Peter Lakotosz, 
his enterprise has begun to establish close links with 
Kazakhstan. Hungarian foreign policy pays increasing attention 
to the development of ties with the Asian republics of the 
former USSR which have gained their independence, said Andras 
Kelemen, political state secretary of the Hungarian Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs. He stressed that during this visit a framework 
for a joint agreement aimed at strengthening Kazakh-Hungarian 
ties in all fields will be discussed.

  [Text] The Foreign Ministry of Kyrgyzstan has circulated a 
statement: The first round of talks on interethnic 
reconciliation in Tajikistan has taken place in Moscow. It was 
held under the auspices of the United Nations. Attending it 
were observers from Kazakhstan, Iran, Afghanistan, Kyrgyzstan, 
Pakistan, Uzbekistan and Russia. The sides [word indistinct] a 
special address from the UN secretary general, agreed on and 
signed a joint declaration which urges the government of 
Tajikistan and the opposition forces to restrain from any kind 
of activities which might endanger the negotiating process. 
  A protocol was signed by the sides involved on setting up a 
joint commission which will address issues of refugees and 
migrants from Tajikistan. Kyrgyzstan considers the aspiration 
of its participants to establish a political dialogue as an 
important result of the talks. The republic regards it as the 
only way for achieving national accord. Kyrgyzstan, as well as 
other CIS participants, expressed its concern with the situation 
on the Tajik-Afghan border still being tense. Kyrgyzstan is 
Tajikistan's nearest neighbor and therefore it cannot remain 
indifferent to the situation which has developed there. 
Kyrgyzstan in its foreign policy is guided by the principle of 
noninterference in the affairs of Tajikistan as a sovereign 
state and develops cooperation with it in accordance with the 
accepted norms of international law, the UN Charter, and 
Kyrgyzstan's liabilities as the CIS member-state. Kyrgyzstan 
pursues the policy of supporting peace-making efforts by 
international organizations and the CIS countries aimed at 
stabilizing the situation in Tajikistan. 
  Kyrgyzstan stands for further developing of friendly 
cooperation with the Republic of Tajikistan, and recognizes its 
government which has been elected in accordance with the 
Constitution. Kyrgyzstan always spoke in favor of holding a 
political dialogue between the government of Tajikistan and the 
opposition. It would have created conditions for overcoming the 
developed conflict situation and national reconciliation in 
Tajikistan. 
  The Foreign Ministry of Kyrgyzstan supports the aspiration 
of 
the participants of the talks to develop the negotiating process 
with the aim of achieving national accord. Kyrgyzstan is sure 
that there are possibilities for political settlement of the 
situation in Tajikistan, normalization of the situation on the 
Tajik-Afghan border. All the sides involved should show their 
good will.

<F P=106> [Yuriy Razgulyayev report: "Askar Akayev Talks Beautifully"] </F>
  [Text] Bishkek -- The April session of the Kirghiz 
[Kyrgyz] parliament began in traditional fashion with the 
question of the early resignation of a group of deputies. Once 
again it involved Russian deputies and once again it was "in 
connection with their emigration from the republic." This time 
some very well-known people are leaving Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan]. 
They include A. Yezhov, who had headed the major 
"Yuzhpolimetall" Association, V. Sergeyev, chief physician at 
the Osh Oblast Hospital.... 
  President A. Akayev often says that the main reasons for 
emigration by the nonnative population are economic. That is 
probably so. But this clearly does not apply to V. Sergeyev, 
much less to A. Yezhov. The session, of course, did not hear 
from them or go into the reasons for their departure. It simply 
rubber-stamped the proposed resolution. But in the lobbies this 
latest emigration gave rise to a lot of discussion. And very 
heated discussion at that. 
  The fact is that, on the initiative of President A. Akayev 
himself, a package of documents was recently drawn up aimed at 
halting this process which has already considerably damaged the 
young state. It includes proposals on the creation of joint 
ventures with Russia and interstate investment funds. There are 
also some draft documents on the full functioning of the Russian 
language and on a balanced cadre policy. Everything seems 
correct. But, on the other hand, it is no secret that in real 
life all non-Kirghiz continue to be pushed out of leading 
positions and are being discriminated against in commerce and 
the financial sphere. 
  And here is one last fact. V. Verbkin, deputy leader of the 
president's press service, has tendered his resignation "in the 
light of persistent suggestions that I quit." He was one of the 
last non-Kirghiz on the upper floors of the "White House." He 
has spent his whole life here, his love for his homeland knows 
no bounds, and he even has a Kirghiz wife. As far as V. 
Verbkin's professional qualities are concerned, he was one of 
the organizers of the president's election campaign. He is 
rightly considered to be a "walking encyclopedia" on all aspects 
of the republic's political life. 
  The process of elbowing out non-Kirghiz has already gone so 
far that, for instance, nobody even attempted to explain to V. 
Verbkin the reasons for his dismissal. "Let him go..." has been 
the indifferent comment on the decision.

  [Text] Dushanbe, 30 Apr -- A clash between Russian border 
guards and an armed group of Tajik fighters trying to make their 
way into Tajikistan from Afghanistan occurred last night in the 
Shuroabad sector of the Moskovskiy border detachment. According

  [Text] A report was broadcast yesterday by the news program 
of the Ostankino television that the situation on the border in 
Badakhshan allegedly became tense, which has resulted in clashes 
between the border guards and the Tajik opposition fighters from 
the other side of the river [in Afghanistan]. 
  According to a report by our correspondent from the 
executive 
committee of the oblast and the military unit of the border 
guards of Badakhshan, this report is groundless and is a mere 
lie. In general, such reports could destabilize the situation 
and become the source for false rumors. The situation in 
Badakhshan and its bordering areas is calm.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Yarushin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 1 May -- This morning, the apparatus of 
Presidents Askar Akayev and Islam Karimov confirmed to an 
ITAR-TASS correspondent that the heads of state of Kirghizia 
[Kyrgyzstan], Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan held a meeting on 29-30 
April in the town of Karakol on the shore of Lake Issyk-Kul in 
Kyrgyzstan. The apparatus categorically refused to give details 
of the meeting, saying it was of a confidential nature. 
However, it was learned in a telephone conversation with a 
representative of Karimov's administration that a communique was 
signed on the results of the meeting. 
  ITAR-TASS has learned that the meeting in Karakol was 
devoted 
to the problems of creating an effective mechanism for a single 
economic zone in the region. Observers are expressing the 
supposition that they were discussing the possibility of a 
regional transformation of the idea of creating a Eurasian 
union. We remind you that in Moscow on 29 March Nursultan 
Nazarbayev proposed the creation of a new association of CIS 
member states -- a Eurasian union. At that time he said that if 
the idea did not find sufficient support in the CIS, a Eurasian 
union could be joined by individual states. 
  Nazarbayev's idea of a Eurasian union of states proposes the 
formation of supranational bodies to coordinate economic, 
defense, and foreign policy; the formation of a single 
parliament and councils of defense and foreign ministers; and 
the introduction of common citizenship. 
  The idea of creating a Eurasian union met with a restrained 
reaction from leaders of CIS member countries. They described 
it as interesting, but premature. Therefore, one can suppose 
with some confidence that on the shore of Lake Issyk-Kul the 
presidents of Kirghizia, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan jointly 
launched an "integration offensive" within the framework of 
bringing regional interests closer together.

  [Text] The Presidents of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and 
Uzbekistan, Nursultan Nazarbayev, Askar Akayev and Islam 
Karimov, had a meeting in Cholpon-Ata, Kyrgyzstan. 
  During the meeting, held at the proposal of Kyrgyzstan 
President Askar Akayev on Friday [29 April] and Saturday, the 
three leaders spoke about the social and political situation in 
their countries, discussed the current state of affairs in 
Central Asia and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) in 
general, and dealt with some international problems. 
  The presidents said there was a need for practical 
mechanisms 
to carry out the trilateral treaty to create a single economic 
area, an accord which, they said, is in line with the CIS 
economic union treaty and is an instrument for the 
implementation of the latter document within Central Asia. 
  Nazarbayev, Akayev and Karimov also brought up some regional 
political problems, mainly that of migration and consequent 
coexistence between different ethnic groups in Central Asian 
countries, and discussed the damage done to Kyrgyzstan's economy 
by recent mudslides. 
  The presidents issued a joint communique, in which they 
urged 
stronger friendship and cooperation between their countries in 
all fields.

  [Text] Bishkek, 2 May -- The presidents of Kazakhstan, 
Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan devoted their meeting on 29-30 April 
on the shore of Lake Issyk-Kul to the deepening of economic 
links in Central Asia and the CIS, says a communique on the 
results of the summit meeting released today by President Askar 
Akayev's press service. 
  The document notes that the meeting was held in a spirit of 
mutual understanding and trust. The sides exchanged views on 
the current situation in the region and the Commonwealth, and 
also on a whole range of international problems. 
  The presidents of the three countries signed a treaty on the 
creation of a single economic space, representing a new level of 
integration for the economies of the Central Asian states, the 
communique stresses. The sides noted that the time has come to 
remove all the obstacles standing in the way of economic 
interaction and to eliminate customs barriers, double taxation, 
and complications with the passage of payments; and that the 
treaty is fully in accordance with the provisions of the 
agreement on the creation of a CIS economic union, and is open 
for joining by all the states of the Commonwealth.

  [Excerpts] As has already been reported, a summit of the 
Presidents of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan took place 
in Karakol. Such summits have become traditional. [passage 
omitted] The main result of this meeting is Kyrgyzstan's joining 
the agreement on a common economic space between Kazakhstan and 
Uzbekistan. Now this is a tripartite agreement. [passage 
omitted] The presidents said that this agreement represents a 
new level of economic integration of the Central Asian states. 
There will be no obstacles, such as customs barriers, double 
taxation. Currency exchange points will be opened. Steps taken 
by the governments to improve goods turnover and goods exchange 
as well as regulation of labor inflow and outflow between the 
states will positively influence the economic situation in the 
region. Further enhancement of economic cooperation will lead 
to a better mechanism, which will facilitate constructive 
interaction and help resolve a number of political problems that 
are common in the region as well. It concerns efficient, 
mutually beneficial and peaceful co-habitation of different 
ethnic groups in Central Asia, which will become a stabilizing 
factor of the ethnic situation in the region. The participants 
of the meeting expressed their readiness to continue their 
search for new forms of interstate cooperation in the interests 
of the three nations. 
  Within the framework of the CIS summit decisions to render 
help to Kyrgyzstan, the presidents discussed concrete measures 
to be taken in order to eliminate damage inflicted on the Kyrgyz 
economy by recent mud slides. The presidents expressed their 
satisfaction with the fruitful talks and their hope for these 
talks to further stimulate friendship and cooperation in the 
region. [words indistinct]

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Veksler] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 28 Apr -- A conference of heads and 
executive directors of news agencies of CIS member-states, which 
finished today at the ITAR-TASS building, has spoken out for the 
need to make efficient use of the unified information space. 
Attending it were delegations from Armenia, Georgia, 
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, 
Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Ukraine, as well as 
representatives from the sovereign states' embassies. 
  In the opinion of ARMENPRESS director Gevorka Oganesyan, 
"the 
main result of the meeting is that we have managed to do some 
constructive work after the collapse of the Soviet Union. I 
recall a similar conference last year, which was quite amorphous 
in content and at which those attending had major differences. 
But now, at the insistence of a majority of the agencies, a 
decision in principle has been made to make really effective use 
of the new unified information space. In connection with this, 
an appropriate memorandum to the chairman of the 
Interparliamentary Assembly was passed." 
  "Our Republic is developing along democratic lines, freedom 
of speech and the press is developing, and naturally we need an 
outlet into the international information space," said Akbar 
Ryskulov, director of the Kyrgyzkabar agency. "We are ready to 
cooperate with any professional news agency that propagandizes 
basic human ideals. Furthermore, the more independent we become, 
the more we regard information integration as important and 
topical for us, and the meeting at ITAR-TASS and the documents 
adopted at it will undoubtedly promote the development of this 
process." 
  Boris Petrov, director of ITAR-TASS in St. Petersburg, said 
he was deeply satisfied with the course and character of the 
meeting and the content of the decisions adopted, particularly 
the proposals to create a permanently functioning council of 
heads of CIS news agencies. In his view, "the general situation 
regarding the creation and building of structures to coordinate 
the activity of the CIS has reached a phase that demands the 
creation of a similar structure in the information field as 
well."

<F P=106> [Report by Sergey Bablumyan: "Armenian Premier Proposes CIS </F>
Countries Institute Collective Currency"] 
  [Text] Yerevan -- Armenian Prime Minister Hrant Bagratian 
has sent a letter to all the CIS prime ministers. 
  It states, in particular, that financial transactions 
between 
the CIS countries have become considerably more complex as a 
result of the introduction of national currencies. The Russian 
ruble is used as a single currency for many trade deals between 
states; the CIS countries look to Russia for loans to execute 
their transactions, thereby increasing the Russian budget 
deficit. The prime minister thinks that the way to ease 
financial difficulties lies in the broader use of national 
currencies, and also proposes setting up a collective currency 
for the CIS countries, in which it is proposed to carry out all 
transactions in a CIS interstate bank.

<F P=106> [Report by Vadim Khusaynov: "Following Its Own Rules"] </F>
  [Text] Yekaterinburg -- The first session of the 
Sverdlovsk Oblast Duma has been held in Yekaterinburg. 
According to the standing orders, deputies began work by 
electing a chairman. Eduard Rossel received 18 of the 27 votes. 
  I would recall that about a year ago Rossel was removed from 
the post of governor of Sverdlovsk Oblast by Russian 
presidential edict for attempting to proclaim the Ural Republic. 
After his removal, his popularity rating rose even higher. The 
oblast inhabitants elected Rossel deputy to the Russian 
Federation Council and then deputy to the Oblast Duma. In 
addition, the heads of administrations of the territories 
adjoining Sverdlovsk Oblast picked Rossel as president of the 
Urals Economic Cooperation Association, and the nonpolitical 
movement "Transformation of the Urals" elected him chairman. 
  In this way the Urals demonstrated its disagreement with 
Moscow's edicts and supported the out-of-favor governor. 
Meanwhile, Eduard Rossel continued to develop the idea of 
regional self-government along the lines of the U.S. states or 
the German laender in the belief that it is necessary to abandon 
the national division of Russia and switch to a territorial 
division. He put that idea to the deputies in the Oblast Duma. 
Incidentally, Vladimir Volkov, the second contender for the 
post of chairman of the Sverdlovsk Duma, also stated in the 
pre-election debates that the constitution of the Ural Republic 
should form the basis of Sverdlovsk Oblast's charter. 
  Now that Eduard Rossel has become chairman of the Duma and 
the latter is actively supporting the idea of regionalism, we 
can expect quite an interesting development of events. The Duma 
is beginning to work on the oblast charter, copying it from the 
Constitution of the Ural Republic. But whereas the Constitution 
had to be ratified by a vote of the Russian parliament, the 
charter is adopted by the Oblast Duma itself. One of the main 
provisions of the charter is the election of the oblast governor 
by universal suffrage. 
  Eduard Rossel makes no secret of his intention of running 
for 
this post if elections are held. Bearing in mind Rossel's 
prestige and his reputation in the oblast, it may be said that 
he has a very good chance of being returned as governor, unless, 
of course, the president of Russia bans the elections of 
governor of Sverdlovsk Oblast, as happened last fall.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent L. Nikitin, including recorded </F>
remarks by I. Mironov, economics minister of the Chuvash 
Republic of the Russian Federation; from the "Vesti" newscast] 
  [Text] Chuvashia is trying to overcome the economic crisis 
by relying on its own potential. Our correspondent reports: 
  [Nikitin] Chuvash Republic President Nikolay Fedorov has 
signed an edict on additional measures to settle economic 
relations in the Republic. 
  [Mironov] We are faced with two main tasks today. First, to 
help republican goods producers to overcome their difficult 
situation. The second task is of a more strategic nature; it is 
to turn the Chuvash Republic into a major business, cultural, 
economic, and financial center of the Volga region. 
  [Nikitin] The edict stipulates a lower tax rate applicable 
to 
banking. The republican authorities believe that the Chuvash 
capital of Cheboksary will become one of Russia's major banking 
centers. Goods producers should already be given assistance in 
creating investment resources. Privileges are being introduced 
by the edict with respect to some taxes, including the tax on 
profits on enterprises engaged in production that are being set 
up in the republic. They are exempt from this tax for three 
years, which is quite a sufficient period for an enterprise to 
establish itself and start production. After this, the 
enterprise can fulfill its obligations to society and start 
paying taxes. Thus, mutual interests will be satisfied.

<F P=106> [From the "Lunch Hour Break" program] </F>
  [Text] A few days ago the people of Maritime Kray were 
literally shocked by the prices for electricity proposed by the 
central government. As Natalya Vstovskaya, press secretary of 
the kray administration head, reported before the beginning of 
the program, Yevgeniy Nazdratenko took part in a meeting of the 
Federal Assembly while in Moscow and signed the Agreement on 
Civic Accord in Russia. I am prepared to welcome any chance 
aimed at stabilizing our society and establishing peace and 
order, he said over the telephone. However, the governor 
expressed deep concern over the situation in connection with the 
increase in prices on electricity. 
  As you know, according to the 22 April decree, the 
government 
is rescinding preferential rates for Maritime Kray set down in 
decree No. 1001. This document was not coordinated with 
Maritime Kray, and I am categorically opposed to such measures, 
Yevgeniy Nazdratenko declared. The head of the administration 
has departed for Vladivostok to deal with urgent kray issues. 
Immediately on arrival he plans to visit the agricultural fair 
and fish market being held today. 
  As was reported earlier, Yevgeniy Nazdratenko was invited to 
the United States for the presentation of the president's book. 
However, he declined the offer. During an audience with Yeltsin 
in Moscow in connection with the publication of the book, I 
explained the necessity for my return to the kray, and I think I 
was understood, the head of the kray administration said.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Shipping Season on River"] </F>
  [Text] The first ships traveled down the Vyatka River 28 
April, starting timber logging. Shipment of grain and 
construction materials is next in line. 
  In the whole shipping season, the crews of the Vyatka River 
Steamship Company have to ship around 2 million tonnes of 
freight. That is considerably less than in past years. 
Customers' inability to pay has robbed the enterprise of a 
chance of procuring the full amount of fuel. Some of the fleet 
will therefore be standing idle. However, passenger lines will 
open in time as planned and in a day or two the first motor 
ships will set out.

<F P=106> [Report by Viktor Belikov: "Passengers Moving from </F>
`Ikarusz' to German `Neoplan'"] 
  [Text] A comfortable and maneuverable 15-meter city bus 
with three wide doors and a passenger capacity of 150 will be a 
new sight on the capital's roads next year. It will be produced 
under license from the well-known German firm of "Neoplan." 
  The decision to set up a joint venture in conjunction with 
the "Avtobus-ZIL" closed-type, joint-stock company was made 28 
April by the Moscow City Government. Fifty-one percent of its 
shares will be held by the "ZIL" Moscow Automobile Company, with 
the rest being held by the Moscow Committee for the Management 
of State Property. There is very high demand for a Russian-made 
vehicle of this type. Moscow alone will require no less than 
1,000 a year. The city's bus fleets are currently short 
2,400-2,500 vehicles. 
  The Hungarian "Ikarusz," which currently have to be bought 
for foreign exchange, are obsolete and leave us dependent on 
shipments of spares from abroad. Moreover, Moscow's motor 
industry enterprises have found themselves in a difficult 
financial and economic position, and the city authorities took 
this into account in deciding to support the "ZIL," not with 
preferential hand-outs or tax breaks, but with a major long-term 
production program. 
  As Yu. Luzhkov reported at the session, "ZIL" specialists 
made their choice of the basic model suitable for our conditions 
after looking at examples from around the world -- from France 
to Japan. The German firm's proposal was the most acceptable in 
terms of its technical characteristics as well as from the 
standpoint of foreign exchange expenditure. The "Neoplan" 
license plus the purchase of components to produce the first 
batch of 150 buses in 1994-95 will cost 49.51 million German 
marks. Off-site "ZIL" teams will begin assembling the vehicles 
at the firm's plant in Pilsting (Bavaria), from where they will 
be dispatched to Moscow. 
  Components and parts production will gradually move to "ZIL" 
shops, and it is ultimately planned to supply the engines from 
the Bashkir city of Ishimbay. Assembly of the new vehicles, V. 
Saykin, first deputy general director of the "ZIL" Moscow 
Automobile Company, said, will be launched in the modernized 
wing of one of the capital's unused motor vehicle pools. The 
motor vehicle plant intends to develop a whole family of 
passenger vehicles based on the "Neoplan."

<F P=106> [Article by Dmytro Shkurko, senior officer at Ukraine's </F>
Ministry of Defense Press Service: "Ukraine's Military Policy: 
Oriental Motifs"] 
  [Text] There is something odd about the vector of public 
opinion in our state. Whereas attempts by Ukraine's Ministry of 
Defense to establish contacts with Western partners invariably 
meet with support and even understanding, any movement from that 
department in an easterly direction gives rise to mistrust and 
even protests. Just recall the widespread condemnation of the 
meeting of ministers of defense of the CIS countries in 
Ashgabat. At that time, an extremely broad range of emphatic 
accusations were voiced, starting with admonitions for the 
allegedly servile position assumed by Ukraine's Ministry of 
Defense and ending with "exposures" of the secret intentions of 
"hostile forces" to join the Collective Security Treaty. 
However, realities are such that the East is by no means less 
important for Ukraine, than the West. Even from the point of 
view of this circumstance alone, the recent visit by our 
military delegation to Almaty and Tashkent could not fail to 
give rise to intense public interest. 
  Its leader, Ukraine's deputy minister of defense Colonel 
General Ivan Oliynyk repeatedly stressed that Ukraine is 
building relations with its partners on the principles of mutual 
respect, trust, and mutual advantage. This determined the 
readiness to discuss all the apparently most acute issues. 
  Both Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan are interested in regaining, 
as fast as possible, the technology and armaments of their 
national armies (as of 1992) that are presently stored at 
Ukraine's repairs enterprises. The Ukrainian side confirmed its 
readiness to immediately return that technology to the clients, 
taking into account the cost of the operations performed on 
them. Right at the negotiating table, an order was issued to 
prepare military convoys for shipment; even the procedure for 
arming the guards who would accompany them was discussed. As a 
result, trains with repaired military technology will soon set 
off eastward. 
  The Ukrainian side not only expressed its readiness to 
provide its own repairs base for the services of Kazakhstan's 
and Uzbekistan's military departments, but also to improve those 
that they have. Research institutes in these countries have 
been invited to take part in elaborating an intensive 
modernization of military technology. 
  For its part, Ukraine is interested in repairing military 
transport aviation aircraft at Uzbekistan's enterprises and in 
using the Baykonur space-vehicle launching site and Kazakhstan's 
unique testing areas for implementing our scientific research 
programs. 
  Incidentally, the subject of space missiles was a major 
topic 
at the negotiations in both Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Each one 
of these countries has its matchless missile technology and 
scientific research basis. Cooperation in this sphere will be 
extremely useful and advantageous for all sides taking part in 
the negotiations. 
  In both Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, the sides reached an 
understanding of the fact that large-scale relationships between 
the military departments must be reinforced by bilateral 
agreements on military cooperation at the level of heads of 
state. Draft agreements are already in the process of 
elaboration. If such documents are signed, this will open up 
wide prospects for the interaction between Ukraine, on the one 
hand, and Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, on the other, in the 
military technological sphere. 
  It is worth recalling that a very telling phrase has been 
included in the communique on the results of the negotiations 
and in the protocols that have been signed: "...bilateral 
contacts are in conformity with the international agreement of 
obligations of the sides and ... do not restrict the interests 
of any of the third countries." 
  Both right after the disintegration of the Union and in the 
years that followed, it was difficult to picture a state that 
would come out in favor of integration within the framework of 
the CIS more consistently than Kazakhstan. However, today, even 
there, people seem to realize that the role of the leader in the 
tight pack "Russia -- the rest of the CIS countries" may result 
in more of a headache than mutual advantage. 
  For example, no sooner did Kazakhstan raise the question of 
fair principles in withdrawing nuclear weapons from its 
territory, than Russia immediately responded by launching its 
propaganda campaign, which has already been tested in Ukraine, 
to the effect that "Kazakhstan's nuclear facilities are in a 
critical state." The result was directly opposite to that 
expected. According to chief of General Staff of Kazakhstan's 
Armed Forces Major General Alibek Kasymov, today, the removal of 
nuclear munitions from Kazakhstan has been halted, with the 
exception of those whose service life has expired or that have 
serious defects. 
  It might seem that Kazakhstan's right to exercise control 
over the Baykonur space-vehicle launching site, situated on its 
territory, is beyond doubt. The initial attempts to exercise 
this right resulted in a sharp reaction on the part of Moscow: 
We, they said, will adapt the Plesetsk space-vehicle launching 
site for our own purposes and, after we withdraw, Baykonur will 
fall apart on its own. Just like that! 
  Uzbekistan is encountering similar problems -- although at a 
different level. The disintegration of the centralized system 
of management has painfully affected everything, starting from 
replenishing the weapons arsenal and ending with logistic 
support. Despite the requests of assistance in most elementary 
issues, yesterday's "big brother" remains unmoved. 
  A paradoxical situation is taking shape in which Russia's 
excessive striving for leadership and the related arrogance 
discredits the Collective Security Treaty and turns it into 
fiction, although Russia itself is one of its most active 
proponents. 
  Against this background, mutually advantageous bilateral 
military cooperation between countries of the CIS may be much 
more productive and intensive than within the framework of a 
collective treaty. There are no contradictions here. First, 
potential customers and real producers can do away with the 
services of the great go-between in relations between one other. 
For example, systems of weapons manufactured in Kazakhstan may 
be sent directly to Ukrainian depots, bypassing the 
"book-keeping" of Russian military-industrial structures, and so 
on. This itself promises considerable savings of funds. 
Second, bilateral cooperation will raise the potential of every 
state manifold. For example, not a single one of them, including 
Russia, is capable of maintaining such a facility as Baykonur on 
its own. However, this particular space-vehicle launching site 
may be efficiently used and serviced with the help of joint bi- 
or multilateral space-missile programs. Third, the system of 
relations on the bilateral basis rules out the creation of 
military alliances and, as a result, the very possibility of 
confrontation. In our specific case, a step has been made 
toward a kind of "partnership for peace" on the territory of the 
former USSR. Finally, fourth, the more actively the states use 
one another's industrial base, the less dependent they will be 
upon the former center. However, strange this might sound, this 
will be a guarantee of the irreversibility of democratic 
transformations in Russia itself. The sooner Russia rids itself 
of the illusions on the "spheres of influence," the sooner it 
will emerge at the level of normal partnership relations with 
other CIS countries, which, incidentally, at present, only 
demand equality and respect for themselves. 
  The recent visit by Ukraine's military delegation to Almaty 
and Tashkent is one of the first signs of the fundamentally new 
approach toward mutually advantageous cooperation between 
Ukraine and CIS countries. However, as is known, spring 
inevitably follows the arrival of the first swallow....

to the Rivne Nuclear Power Station"] 
  [Text] By the end of 1995, the Rivne Nuclear Power Station 
will receive equipment worth 21 million German marks from 
Germany. This was agreed upon during a meeting at the nuclear 
facility between representatives of the Society for the Safety 
of Nuclear Reactors and of the German firms "Siemens," "ABB," 
and "Lloyd." 
  Following the interstate agreement, the German side will 
provide equipment for the periodic inspection of metals and 
diagnostics, telecommunications equipment, and fire-proof 
materials. This will make it possible to modernize the 
functioning power unit with its output of 1 million 
kilowatt/hours. Assembly operations will be carried out by 
Rivne nuclear specialists with the help of specialists from 
various German companies assigned by the Society for the Safety 
of Nuclear Reactors, taking into account their experience in 
organizing and implementing measures to increase nuclear safety.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Fedor Ignatov] </F>
  [Text] Almaty, 2 May (ITAR-TASS) -- The Almaty city 
committee for emergencies announced an emergency situation in 
the capital of Kazakhstan from today. Due to the sharp 
restriction in the supply of fuels to the Almatynefteprodukt 
association and the Munayavtomatizatsiya joint-stock 
association, the dispatch of fuel to all enterprises and 
organizations, apart from those directly providing the city's 
vital facilities, is to be prohibited until special instruction. 
Tough restrictions on the supply of electricity to consumers 
have been introduced. In certain districts of the city, the 
temperature of hot water has been reduced to 40 degrees Celcius. 
  Speaking on republician television, the city's mayor 
Zamanbek 
Nurkadilov said that neither the prime minister nor his deputy 
wishes to discuss the present situation with him. "If the prime 
minister does not want to meet the city's head," Nurkadilov 
said, "and if other high-ranking officials also ignore the 
city's problems, then the natural question arises: Whyt do we 
need such a government?" 
  The mayor expressed hope that the leadership of those 
regions 
which supply the capital of Kazakhstan with coal, petroleum 
products, and gas will not remain indifferent to the emergency 
situation that has been introduced.

  [Text] The National Bank of Kazakhstan held a news 
conference devoted to the financial and credit situation in the 
Republic. National Bank Chairman Daulet Sembayev and his 
deputies answered numerous questions and said that "the banking 
system has not yet been properly formed in our state." Founders 
of commercial banks pursued only one aim--to ensure themselves 
with credits--and did not take into consideration the needs of 
their customers. In addition, they were short of money and 
qualified personnel. The possibilities of such banks were 
reduced to a minimum due to granting unjustified or wrongly 
documented soft loans. A great deal of work is currently being 
done in localities in order to increase the authorized funds of 
loan granting banks and to reduce the interference of local 
administrations in these banks' work. The board of the National 
Bank came to a logically based conclusion: Decisions on 
granting soft loans should be made primarily by the government 
and banks, to this effect, should be given additional money. 
The board of the National Bank will hold news conferences 
regularly. This will enable the population to make an informed 
choice and to participate in various financial events and not to 
fall prey to dubious deals. The number of other transgressions 
will also decrease.

  [Text] Almaty, 2 May--Central Asia should become a single 
and effectively functioning economic space. This was the 
conclusion reached by Nursultan Nazarbayev, Askar Akayev, and 
Islam Karimov, the presidents of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and 
Uzbekistan, at their meeting on 29-30 April on the shores of 
Lake Issyk-Kul that was proposed by the Kyrgyz leader, the 
KazTAG news agency reported today. 
  Trilateral summit meetings of this kind have become a 
regular 
event. They had been held in Kazakhstan previously--in the 
locality of Ordabasy in south Kazakhstan Oblast and also in 
Kokshetau. 
  The main outcome of the present meeting was Kyrgyzstan's 
joining the treaty on the creation of a single economic space 
between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The treaty has now become 
trilateral. 
  The presidents discussed a wide range of issues of mutual 
interest and exchanged views on the current situation in Central 
Asia and the CIS, as well as on a range of international 
problems. 
  The presidents pointed out the positive trend toward 
deepening economic links in the region and in the CIS as a 
whole. They especially noted the importance of working out a 
mechanism for implementing the treaty between Kazakhstan, 
Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan on the creation of a single economic 
space, which represents a new level of integration for the 
economies of Central Asian states at a time when obstacles to 
economic interaction such as customs barriers and double 
taxation continue to be removed, while at the same time currency 
exchange points are opening. 
  The sides noted that the document is fully in accordance 
with 
the provisions of the treaty on the creation of an economic 
union between Commonwealth countries and is open for joining by 
all the states of the Commonwealth. 
  The need to heighten the role of institutions integrating 
the 
economic, cultural, and information space both within the CIS 
and within Central Asia demands that dialogue at the summit 
level be stepped up, the presidents said. Similar problems in 
the economic and political spheres and traditional production 
and social links create real preconditions for developing closer 
cooperation, for significantly reducing the expenses of the 
transitional period, and for relieving the difficulties brought 
about by the process of forming a market economy. 
  They believe a number of political problems are also common 
to the whole region. The potential for the peaceful and 
effective cohabitation of different ethnic groups in Central 
Asia should help to stabilize the ethno-regional situation. 
  Within the framework of the decision by Commonwealth heads 
of 
state to render urgent aid to Kyrgyzstan, the leaders of the 
three countries discussed specific measures for eliminating the 
damage that the elements have inflicted on the Republic's 
economy. 
  Expressing satisfaction with the results of the meeting, the 
presidents of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan stressed 
that the constructive and fruitful talks that had taken place 
would serve "to further develop and strengthen the historic 
friendship, mutual understanding, and cooperation between the 
peoples of our fraternal countries."

  [Text] Bishkek 3 May TASS -- "Russia's main interest in 
Central Asia and in Transcaucasia is peace," speaker of the 
upper chamber of the Russian parliament Vladimir Shumeyko told a 
press conference here on Monday [2 May] after the signing of an 
agreement on interparliamentary cooperation between Russia and 
Kyrgyzstan. Russian troops in the Caucasian conflict zone serve 
only as a disengagement buffer between the conflicting sides. 
In Shumeyko's opinion, any "war between two CIS nations is an 
obstacle to the development of the Commonwealth of Independent 
States as a whole." 
  Speaker of the Kyrgyz parliament Medetkan Sherimkulov added: 
"We cannot leave Russia to deal with the Karabakh problem alone. 
We must prevent it from being accused of imperial designs when 
it tries to restore peace in this area by its own means. Of 
course, we are aware of Russia's interest in the republics of 
the former Soviet Union. But today Russia can rely not only on 
its own forces. Its efforts are now correctly assessed in all 
the states of our commonwealth." 
  Asked about the plans for achieving peace, Shumeyko said: 
"The MPS are unanimous that the problem should be solved as a 
single whole." Shumeyko indicated three settlement stages: 
complete end of hostilities, withdrawal of all the troops from 
the conflict zone, and conclusion of a peace treaty. "The status 
of Nagorno-Karabakh can be determined only after that," he 
stated. 
  Shumeiko, together with his counterpart Medetkan 
Sherimkulov, 
flew to the southern part of the republic today to visit 
districts hit by a recent natural calamity.

  [Text] Moscow, 2 May (ITAR-TASS) -- A special commission 
has started an investigation into yesterday's incident at 
airport at Khorog (the administrative center of Gorno-Badakhshan 
autonomous oblast), in which armed opposition fighters seized a 
military aircraft from Uzbekistan. The ITAR-TASS correspondent 
was told today over the telephone by informed sources in 
Tajikistan's Government circles that because of conflicting 
reports from Khorog it is impossible to confirm or refute the 
definition of the incident as a "seizure" of the cargo delivered 
by the AN-26 aircraft from Uzbekistan to Khorog pending 
completion of the commission's work. 
  Meanwhile, as was reported earlier, Uzbekistan's Defense 
Ministry confirmed yesterday that the cargo described as 
"humanitarian aid" had indeed been prepared for delivery to 
Gorno-Badakhshan. But for unknown reasons the relevant bodies 
in Tajikistan were not informed beforehand about the time when 
the state border would be crossed. The aircraft landed at 1500 
local time at the Khorog airport. After the landing the runway 
and the approaches to the airport were cordoned off by fighters 
from a detachment of "Tajik Self-Defense Forces." The cargo on 
board was taken away. In view of this, military sources in 
Dushanbe do not rule out the possibility that contacts have been 
established between certain forces in Uzbekistan and fighters in 
the Pamir mountains, and that these contacts have some bearing 
on the situation in the region.

  [Text] Moscow, 2 May (ITAR-TASS) -- According to the 
preliminary results produced by the commission investigating 
yesterday's report about the Uzbek plane in Khorog airport, it 
was not seized by armed Tajik opposition forces. An ITAR-TASS 
correspondent was told over the phone today by sources in well- 
informed government circles in the Republic that the special 
commission has established that the plane was on a scheduled 
flight for the joint peace-keeping forces and was carrying 
humanitarian aid. 
  The same source said the commission established that, 
contrary to the reports coming in, the plane was not seized and 
there were no armed people from the Tajik opposition at the 
airport. The same source said that, because of Khorog's 
location and the situation in the region, all planes coming into 
the airport are regarded from the standpoint of security. As 
for the AN-26 plane which was apparently seized, it left Khorog 
at 1627 and no problems were registered. Two other planes in 
addition to the AN-26 landed at Khorog airport from Dushanbe on 
that day. 
  Tajik Foreign Minister Rashid Olimov told an ITAR-TASS 
correspondent in a telephone interview that an official 
statement would be made tomorrow about the results of the 
investigation into this episode.

  [Text] Dushanbe, 3 May -- Tajikistan's secret services have 
given their version of the incident concerning the landing of an 
Uzbek aircraft at the airport in the town of Khorog 
(administrative center of autonomous Gorno-Badakhshan in 
Tajikistan) on 1 May. 
  According to a statement by Colonel Farkhod Sharipov, head 
of 
the public relations center of Tajikistan's Ministry of 
Security, which he made to Russian journalists today, the 
landing by the Uzbek plane, which belongs to the borderguards in 
this Central Asian republic, did take place. However, the 
flight was being made by prior consent between the governments 
of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to deliver humanitarian freight to 
the population of the Pamirs. 
  This freight, Farkhod Sharipov stressed, was mainly 
children's clothing and was received by official representatives 
of the administration of Gorno-Badakhshan. Reports put out by 
some of the media saying that the flight was carrying military 
uniforms for local guerrillas and that local Pamir self-defense 
units were blocking approaches to the airport and the airport 
itself at the time the freight was unloaded have not been 
confirmed.

  [Text] The head of a U.N. team of observers in Tajikistan 
said that last month's group murders in the Central Asian 
Republic (eight people being killed in Hissar District, five in 
Dzhirgatal District and four in Tajikabad District) may not have 
been politically motivated. 
  Liviu Bota, in an interview with INTERFAX, said it is the 
economic situation in Tajikistan that accounts for the high 
crime rate there. 
  However, "although many of the latest events of that kind 
have no political motives behind them, they may grow into 
political confrontations," he said. 
  Liviu said crime is a serious problem throughout the 
Commonwealth of Independent States, and "Tajikistan is no 
exception." But in Tajikistan "this is taking place against the 
background of a political confrontation and may have undesirable 
consequences," he said. 
  "The United Nations and states friendly to Tajikistan will 
be 
doing their best to achieve reconciliation in the Republic and 
to make sure that goodwill intentions stated at the first round 
of Tajik talks (negotiations between Tajikistan's government and 
opposition) in Moscow at the beginning of April develop into 
effective measures," Bota said. 
  He said the international community approved of the present 
rapprochement between the conflicting parties in Tajikistan, 
which was clear from some countries' declared readiness to 
increase their humanitarian aid to the republic. 
  Bota said the conflict would take time to resolve, but 
expressed satisfaction that "the parties have realized that the 
problem cannot be solved by force." 
  He said preparations were underway for a second round of 
talks, where many questions taken up at the first round would be 
addressed more closely. 
  Asked whether the adoption of a new constitution, a draft of 
which is currently under discussion in Tajikistan, would be 
premature now, Bota said, "Since (today) a Soviet-era 
constitution is in effect in the republic today, a new one, 
whatever it is, would be a step forward." But he said there was 
no reason to hurry up with the adoption of the document. "It 
would be better to provide conditions for all Tajiks to take 
part in the [discussion] process," he said.

  [Text] Dushanbe 3 May TASS -- Russian borderguards have 
prevented one more armed provocation on the Pamir stretch of the 
Tajik-Afghan border. 
  ITAR-TASS today learned at the headquarters of the Russian 
borderguard troops in Tajikistan that a group of armed men from 
the Tajik opposition made a attempt on Monday evening to fight 
their way into Tajikistan on one of the sectors guarded by the 
Horog borderguard detachment. 
  The intruders enjoyed fire coverage from Afghan territory. 
The Russian borderguards were compelled to retaliate, thereby 
preventing the gang from crossing the border river. The Russian 
troops suffered no casualties. The enemy losses were not 
reported. 
  Men of the irreconcilable opposition are now being massed on 
separate sections of the border between Tajikistan and the 
Afghan province of Tahor. Military sources do not rule out new 
armed provocations on this stretch of the border.

<F P=106> [ITAR-TASS Correspondent Lyudmila Glazovskaya report </F>
"exclusively for ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA" on interview with 
Turkmenistan President Niyazov: "Saparmurad Niyazov, President 
of Turkmenistan: My Program is Ten Years of Stability"] 
  [Text] At the end of April a large group of Moscow 
newspaper chief editors went to Turkmenistan at the invitation 
of President Saparmurad Niyazov. 
  To be fair to Saparmurad Turkmenbas, there wasn't a single 
question which gave him cause for self-justification or 
self-congratulation. The only quality which he did permit 
himself was to be frank and to detailed. It is no coincidence 
that he frequently talked about the Niyazov of old -- the 
communist who sincerely believed in the party's ideals and then 
believed in Gorbachev and perestroyka. 
  What has changed his attitude toward the things that he held 
sacred? Where is that dividing line between his past and 
present? How did this happen and how quickly was it achieved? 
Why is Turkmenistan, which was the last to leave the USSR and 
which, incidentally, made no efforts to rock it, now rejecting 
the very idea of any superstructure -- be it political, 
economic, or humanitarian? Furthermore, Turkmenistan has been 
putting forward initiatives to which others have been 
affiliating. Whereas the Ashgabat meeting of CIS heads of state 
determined the consultative nature of the Commonwealth and its 
voluntary strategy, the recent Moscow meeting was a reflection 
of the practical approach, as observers could not fail to 
notice. In any event the new consultative structure -- an 
economic commission in place of the proposed suprastate 
committee -- was proposed by Turkmenistan and all the other 
members of the economic union voted for it. 
  So what kind of country is Turkmenistan -- visited by Le Pen 
and Mitterrand, a magnet for where Western investors, where the 
Constitution proclaims a secular democratic system, where there 
are portraits of the president wherever you go, and where his 
picture appears on the currency? There are questions to be 
answered there. 
  There are answers, too. But how would you like us to 
develop? Yesterday it was "with Lenin in mind," but today: 
What? Nature abhors a vacuum. Way back, we drove out 
religion; then we exalted communism; and now we want democracy. 
And where do we want it -- in the East? 
  Yes, the president agrees. "The East is a subtle thing." He 
recalled how in India he was presented with a figure of a 
smiling man. Turn it round and you are holding a saber in your 
hand... 
  But to return to the Politburo.... Gorbachev himself 
admitted that there were people there who would embrace you and 
at the same time, perhaps, wanted to strangle you.... 
  Now try to guess which place is more enigmatic, the East or 
the West? And in what way? People are people everywhere and, 
as we know, there are no bad peoples. There are unfortunate 
people. Take the Turkmens: They used to produce vast amounts of 
oil and gas, but still could not "force" a school out of the 
USSR State Planning Committee without being subjected to 
insults. There is still no drinking water in the west of the 
Republic, where they are presently holding the fourth 
international tender to prospect for hydrocarbons (the country 
is fourth in the world). 
  So what does this mean -- are we to go back under one roof 
again, the president asked himself? We do not deny the merits 
of the system, he said, which ensured us universal education and 
gave us access to Russian culture and the cultures of other 
peoples. We do not deny the obvious, he said, and that means 
first and foremost the indissoluble spiritual link between our 
peoples. But we are opposed to everything that is artificial 
because we have seen from our experience that it cannot exist on 
living soil where real people live. 
  How does the "life" of the portraits tally with that claim? 
Do not bother to look for a hidden oriental meaning in this, 
Niyazov said. If a colossus such as Lenin has been toppled, the 
time will come when I, a mere mortal, will also be cast down. 
What private property owner am I foisting my portrait on? What 
factory owner am I forcing to name his factory after me? He 
would laugh, and that would be that. Furthermore, Niyazov, in 
his own words, is not foisting anything on anybody right now. 
He tried to ban the celebration of his birthday, but the 
Assembly unanimously turned down his request. Niyazov, who in 
eight years has not arrested a single dissident and who has not 
used the least force against anyone, reasonably reserves to 
himself the right to not to ban anything, including his own 
portrait. However, he does not hide the fact that he sees some 
point in creating the image of a national leader, whoever it may 
be. "Until they acquire peace and material sufficiency, the 
people must believe in someone and something. Otherwise there 
will be chaos." That is the Turkmen president's main creed, 
which he used as the basis of his main program "Ten Years of 
Stability." 
  A transitional period and a popular consciousness unprepared 
for the market are the alpha and omega of his political 
activity. If you bear in mind the kind of political cocktail 
that this consciousness entails in the post-communist East, it 
is not hard to understand Niyazov's logic: Like a pharmacist, 
he is forced to weigh all the moods in society in his political 
scales. 
  "Do you think that everything has gone smoothly here?" he 
asked his guests. "Not at all. Ashgabat and Nebitdag have 
experienced their first-ever interethnic pogroms. The 
intelligentsia held rallies to defend the exclusive right of the 
national language." 
  A transition from social to private ownership or vice versa 
is, of course, very difficult. That is why the transitional 
period is so important. In Turkmenistan this means a phased 
transition to different forms of ownership, the privatization of 
enterprises -- the small ones first, and then the large ones -- 
and the flotation of leading sectors of the economy. 
  But an outlet into the world market was needed for gas 
products -- the main national product, and one has been found. 
At the moment it is still at the planning stage, admittedly, 
but these are very important plans. One gas pipeline will go 
via Iran and Turkey to Europe, another via China to Japan. The 
East and Asia will be linked by a transcontinental railroad 
through Turkmenistan. It is already being built, and quite 
quickly, too. 
  However, everything takes time. "We are not crowing about 
our successes," the president said. "We are proud of our 
stability and of the bridges that we have built with the people 
through the provision of free gas, water, and electricity, and 
of our consistent social policy. As for everything else, 
matters are not going very well here -- which is true of 
everyone. So that we are no better than anyone else." 
  As for the feature, which distinguishes him from the rest, 
he 
says that it is the fact that he has been working with his team 
since day one of the proclamation of independence. Indeed, 
Niyazov has replaced virtually no one in that time because he 
believes that, first, you do not changes horses in midstream and 
second, change for change's sake is absurd. Here, too, he is 
frank, and asserts that when you cannot emerge from the womb of 
socialism and become a marketeer overnight. For that you need 
property, and that is true even of a high-ranking official. 
  "You want people to criticize me," he told the journalists. 
"But you try to make them do that when everyone is still afraid 
for his own job -- a fear dating back to the times of 
`communism' -- and is thus afraid for the future of his family 
and children too." 
  But why criticize without genuine cause? There are arguments 
within Niyazov's cabinet, but no one has any intention of airing 
them in the press. That would be ridiculous. 
  Judging by how attentively the journalists listened and the 
way that their facial expressions changed, you could tell that 
Saparmurad Niyazov's words had an effect on them. 
  In any event the Moscow visitors were convinced that 
Turkmenistan is indeed going its own road, that peace reigns 
here, and that this is the most valuable thing of all....

  [Text] Maya Ganiyeva, our correspondent in Uzbekistan, once 
again in her reportage returns to the program's theme of spring 
floods, but the report is much more alarming than those from 
Nizhniy Novgorod and Rostov-on-Don. The fact is that, 
specifically because of heavy flooding, the threat of 
radioactive pollution hangs over the heavily populated Fergana 
Valley of Uzbekistan. Let us hear from Maya Ganiyeva: 
  [Ganiyeva] I am bringing you this report from the shores of 
the mountain river Mayli-Say. The town with the same name in 
Kyrgyzstan is situated not far from here. It was founded in the 
1930's following the discovery of uranium ores. Its processing 
capacities--an enrichment factory and a hydrometallurgical 
works-- were soon built. In 1968, when all supplies were 
exhausted, they were simply destroyed. Traces remained, 
however, just as the burial grounds of radioactive materials 
also remained. What is interesting is that there is radioactive 
waste in the ground from everywhere, even from Czechoslovakia. 
  Following the mudslides, heavy rain, and landslides, there 
was a real danger of poisonous substances finding their way into 
the river. It is swollen to an incredible size here. At any 
moment, the water sweeping all around may also wash away the 
radioactive tombs. There below is the Fergana Valley. The most 
alarming thing is that this whole area, the Syr Darya River that 
runs through it, and large regions of Central Asia may become 
polluted. That is why the Governments of Uzbekistan and 
Kyrgyzstan and the public have sounded the alarm. Even now a 
government commission has been set up, and there has been rapid 
strengthening of the banks. Hydrological facilities that may 
absorb the waters are being planned. 
  I flew in here with a special international group headed by 
Ecosan, the Uzbekistan ecology and health fund. The Ecosan 
international fund has brought aid--medical supplies and 
disposable syringes--to those hit by the landslides. 
  My companion is Yusuf Shedemetov, president of the Ecosan 
international fund. Yusuf Shedemetovich, what is being done to 
avert a disaster? 
  [Shedemetov] The main task is to bring it to the attention 
of 
the world community, the leaders of the Central Asian states, 
and the governments of this region--all governments. In 
addition, it is also necessary to ask the Russian Federation for 
help. Many specialists and many leaders of the ministry of that 
time worked in this region. They left a lot of traces. Also, 
our research here shows that there is still a lack of technical 
documentation that would be very useful today for deeper 
scientific research. That is why the Academy of Sciences of the 
Russian Federation and many ministries, departments, and state 
committees could render practical aid. 
  [Ganiyeva] Yes, it would be a very great mistake if these 
blossoming pistachio and apricot orchards were turned into a 
mini-Chernobyl. One would like to hope that the efforts of 
ecologists and the public will not be wasted and that the valley 
will be preserved for life.

<F P=106> [Article by Armen Khanbabayan: "A Light Has Appeared at the </F>
End of the Tunnel"] 
  [Text] In negotiations in Moscow the speaker of the 
Azerbaijan parliament, R. Gulnev, announced to the minister of 
defense of Russia, P. Grachev: "Azerbaijan is prepared to 
cease-fire on the night of 28 April if Armenia will follow its 
example." The leader of the Russian war department promised to 
notify Yerevan of Baku's decision immediately, adding that "I am 
convinced that the answer will be affirmative." Commenting on 
this information, the radio station Mayak noted that, judging 
from everything, Azerbaijan is prepared to join the Russian 
peace initiative, which, as we know, "envisions the release of 
all seized Azerbaijani territory and the return of the Karabakh 
formations to within the confines of Nagorno Karabakh itself. 
Along with them, Russian separation subdivisions will be 
brought into these regions." 
  If all this is true, it would be difficult to overestimate 
what has occurred. G. Aliyev's stubborn unwillingness to give 
his consent to the introduction of Russian peace keepers into 
Azerbaijan has finally been broken. And this happened because 
of two circumstances. Armenia's latest successes in defending 
the Nagorno Karabakh Republic in the southeastern section of 
resistance created a very real threat both to Gyandzha and the 
Yevlakh transportation and energy center. Practically all of 
the right bank of the Kura ended up extremely vulnerable in 
military terms. Further success of the Karabakh Army in these 
areas would mean unconditional defeat for Azerbaijan. 
Obviously, this scenario inevitably involves serious domestic 
political collisions with an easily predictable result: New, 
pro-Russian leaders will take over power in Baku. There is no 
doubt that, for example, this was understood in Ankara, which 
explains the advice from Hikmet Cetin to the Azerbaijan leader 
to accept the Russian peace plan. Seeing that the war was lost 
de facto and his closest ally was washing his hands of it, G. 
Aliyev probably decided to try to save what still might be saved 
-- his power. 
  Time will tell whether he will succeed in the end; only the 
winners will not be judged, and the losers always will be. One 
thing is clear today: Russia will gain one more (after Abkhazia) 
large military-political victory in the Transcaucasus. And 
again -- with no effort on its part -- but that is not the main 
thing. The main thing is that it is above all our common 
Armenian victory-- military and political and diplomatic and 
moral. 
  But is it not too soon to speak about that? After all, 
anything could happen, and even Russia's position, as we know, 
can very quickly undergo remarkable metamorphoses. 
  Still one wants to hope that today will be the turning point 
in the situation. There will undoubtedly be new, quite 
justified misgivings and concerns related to the fact that the 
people of Karabakh will apparently have to gradually begin to 
deploy troops closer to their borders, but there is also the 
hope for peace, the hope for termination of the blockade, that 
during the course of very lengthy and complicated negotiations 
the diplomats will find a new status for Karabakh, which will be 
acceptable primarily to the people of Karabakh themselves. 
  There is no doubt that the process of transition from a 
state 
of war to a state of peace will be long, hard, and fraught with 
numerous complications, snags, and various kinds of surprises. 
We must be prepared for this. Ultimately we were able to prove 
to ourselves and to the entire world that we are worth something 
as a nation, that force, and war, and a blockade could not break 
us and could not provoke us to internecine strife. Therefore, 
the time will definitely come when the crown of thorns on the 
head of the people will be replaced by a wreath of laurels. 
  In the cruel winter cold, under conditions of the 
large-scale 
Azerbaijan offensives in Karabakh, when there was no light in 
the homes for weeks and the front was caving in and it seemed 
that defeat was around the corner, the president of the Republic 
firmly, confidently, and solemnly promised: This year we will 
start up the nuclear power plant, we will adopt a constitution 
suitable for a free, democratic country, and we will achieve 
peace with dignity. Did many of our compatriots at that time 
believe our president without reservations?

<F P=106> [Message "To the Ministry of Defense of the Russian </F>
Federation, P. Grachev, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of 
the Russian Federation, A. Kozyrev, and V. Kazimirov" published 
under the rubric "Artsakh": "The Nagorno-Karabakh Republic Is 
Prepared To Provide for Complete Cease-Fire"] 
  [Text] The leaders of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, having 
accepted the proposal of the Russian Federation and confirming 
their readiness for peaceful regulation of the armed conflict 
between the Armenian Republic and the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, 
agree to provide for a complete cease-fire and to end combat 
activities as of 0001 hours on 29 April 1994 in keeping with the 
Protocol of 18 February 1994. 
  Taking into account the absence of observers and the mutual 
mistrust of the opposing sides and striving to preclude possible 
attempts to take advantage of the temporary respite to prepare 
for another large-scale attack and thus, contribute to the 
irreversibility of the peace process, the leadership of the 
Nagorno-Karabakh Republic considers it necessary to set in 
motion the entire mechanism of the aforementioned Protocol 
signed by the parties to the conflict with the participation of 
the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation. 
  Only the realization of this complex of envisioned 
military-technical measures can guarantee stable termination of 
combat activities and create favorable conditions for solving 
the political programs. 
  The leaders of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic are prepared to 
issue the corresponding orders after the intermediary confirms 
the receipt of the identical document from the opposing side.

  [Text] In Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan], a meeting of the working 
groups of the Interparliamentary Assembly of the CIS on problems 
of a settlement of the Karabakh conflict begins today. Speakers 
of the parliaments of Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Russia and 
representatives of Nagornyy Karabakh have begun arriving in 
Bishkek. Our commentator on the situation on the eve of the 
meeting: 
  [Correspondent A. Ivanova] The Armenian leadership headed by 
President Levon Ter-Petrosyan held consultations today in the 
town of Goris with the leadership of Nagornyy Karabakh 
[Nagorno-Karabakh]. The details of the conversation are not 
being disclosed. According to unofficial information, the sides 
discussed the approach to a settlement of the Karabakh conflict 
in connection with the meeting planned for 3 May in Bishkek of 
heads of parliaments of Armenia and Azerbaijan, with the 
participation of representatives of Nagornyy Karabakh. 
  The initiator of the meeting was the CIS Interparliamentary 
Assembly, which has noticeably stepped up its peacemaking 
activity in the zone of the Karabakh conflict. 
  Vladimir Shumeyko, who arrived in Bishkek today, stated that 
the talks provide an opportunity to reach agreement on the 
question of a settlement of the Karabakh conflict. He considers 
the main justification for this to be the fact that Azerbaijan 
recognized Nagornyy Karabakh recently as one of the participants 
of this conflict. Shumeyko called this a very big leap forward 
in the process of the talks on Karabakh.

  [Text] According to a poll, Armenia's ex-Foreign Minister 
Raffi Ovannisyan is the most popular politician in that republic 
in April. 
  He was favoured by 73.2 percent of the 1200 Armenians, 
polled 
by the Center for Sociological Studies at the Republican Academy 
of Sciences. 
  President Levon Ter-Petrosyan proved popular with only 22.9 
percent of the interviewed, 57.1 percent voiced dislike for him. 
  Nor does the Prime Minister Hrant Bagratyan enjoy 
popularity. 
He was spoken of favorably only 11.6 percent of the 
respondents, 73.2 percent said he was no good. 
  The most popular party, according to the poll, is 
Dashnaktsutyun, an opposition revolutionary federation. Going 
next is the Armenian Communist Party. The ruling Armenian 
National Movement comes only third in the list. 
  Of foreign politicians, the U.S. President Bill Clinton and 
Russia's President Boris Yeltsin enjoy the greatest popularity 
in Armenia.

<F P=106> [Article by Serob Oganyan under rubric "Briefing": </F>
"President Prepared To Submit Disputed Issues to the Court of 
the People"] 
  [Text] Yesterday the president's acting press secretary 
Levon Zurabyan held a regular briefing devoted to two topics: 
First, regarding the adoption of the Constitution, and second, 
the latest events in Nagornyy Karabakh. 
  The press secretary noted that the adoption of the 
Constitution, in the president's opinion, is one of the most 
important problems Armenia will have to solve. In spite of the 
fact that discussions in parliament regarding the question of 
the mechanism for adopting the Constitution produced no results, 
L. Ter-Petrosyan gave a positive assessment to the discussions 
since the positions represented by the political forces in 
parliament were determined and their alignment was clarified. 
This will make it possible for everyone to take a more 
realistic approach to the question of adoption of the 
Constitution. 
  "It is obvious," said L. Zurabyan, "that today's parliament 
is indeed not in a position to adopt a Constitution...." The 
adoption of the Basic Law was opposed both by deputies insisting 
on a referendum and by proponents of a Constituent Assembly. 
Thus, the number of deputies voting against this idea was 
almost a qualified majority. The idea of a Constituent Assembly 
was also actually rejected since no more than 50-60 deputies 
support it. 
  "The debates in parliament showed that the most promising 
path to the adoption of a Constitution is a referendum," stated 
the president's press secretary. The Constituent Assembly 
version can only create another source of tension since the 
organ granted these extremely important authority would have to 
be chosen under conditions when there is no national accord in 
society. 
  In the press secretary's opinion, the draft Constitution 
developed by the Supreme Soviet commission is more legitimate 
than the draft of the "six." He reported that the president 
suggested providing equal conditions for the drafts, placing 
both versions on the referendum. The readiness to hold new 
presidential and National Council elections after the adoption 
of the parliamentary version of the Constitution confirmed that 
this draft was not created under the power of Levon 
Ter-Petrosyan. And the latter, the president, through his press 
secretary, stated that he is prepared to submit all disputed 
issues to a court of the people. The absence of this kind of 
approach among the opposition shows their mistrust of democratic 
methods and the lack of confidence in the notion that they can 
achieve their goals by setting democratic mechanisms in motion. 
  "In spite of everything, the president is looking to the 
future with optimism and thinks that the Constitution will be 
adopted through a nationwide referendum. As for the parliament, 
even if the constitutional process is slowed up here, this 
should not be viewed as a crisis. In such a case, in a year 
there will be new elections to the legislative organ and there 
will be new deputies to decide this issue... 
  Then the president's press secretary proceeded to a 
discussion of the situation surrounding the Karabakh problem. 
After the speaker of the parliament of Azerbaijan, R. Guliyev, 
met in Moscow with Minister of Defense of Russia P. Grachev and 
reported his readiness to cease combat activities beginning at 
0000 hours on 28 February, the latter had a telephone 
conversation with President of Armenia Levon Ter-Petrosyan, 
during the course of which he conveyed Azerbaijan's proposal and 
asked that he render assistance to the Karabakh side so that the 
Nagornyy Karabakh Republic would also agree to the cease-fire. 
This request was relayed to the Karabakh leaders by Yerevan 
officials. The Russian side, in turn, conveyed Azerbaijan's 
proposal to the authorities of the Nagornyy Karabakh Republic. 
  "What Azerbaijan is proposing now is only a 10-day 
cease-fire 
without any commitments," said L. Zurabyan. "And, of course, in 
this form the proposal is unacceptable to Nagornyy Karabakh..." 
  The press secretary expressed the opinion that Azerbaijan 
needed these 10 days as a respite and to prepare to resume 
combat activities and this is why Armenia fully concurs with 
Azerbaijan's position...

  [Text] Yerevan, 2 May (SNARK) -- For about a month the 
railroad communications of Armenia with outer world has been 
broken off. Press service of the Armenian Government told SNARK 
that as a result of the sharp rise in water-level at the Khrami 
river in the Marneuliaskiy region, the central pier of 70-meter 
railroad bridge declined for two meters. 
  In connection with danger for trains a resolution to stop 
railway traffic was made. According to preliminary forecasts, 
trains from Armenia to Georgia and back will not run for about a 
month. Other railroad communications through Azerbaijan and 
Turkey have not worked for a long time because of blockade of 
Armenia by these countries. The representatives of the Armenia 
Government have left for the place of incident and are 
organizing the transportation of loads, first of all grain and 
fuel, from Georgia to Armenia with trucks.

  [Text] Here is a report from our Foreign Ministry's press 
service: 
  To ensure the irreversibility of the peace talks, 
Azerbaijan, 
Armenia, and the international organizations, primarily the 
CSCE, should declare that they will assume the following 
obligations after the establishment of a cease-fire in the 
region. 
  1. The Armenian Republic's leadership should guarantee to 
pull out its Armed Forces from all the occupied Azerbaijani 
lands, including Shusha and Lachin. 
  2. The Azerbaijani Republic's leadership should guarantee to 
discuss Daghlyk-Karabakh's [Nagorno-Karabakh's] status within 
the Azerbaijani state structure. 
  3. The CSCE countries should announce that they will not 
allow military equipment to be sent to Daghlyk-Karabakh. 
  This proposal was put forward by our republic's foreign 
minister, Gasan Gasanov, during a meeting with Mathias Mosberg, 
deputy chairman of Minsk Group.

  [Text] Baku, 2 May (TURAN)--Over the last days and this 
morning the Armenian armed forces continued their attacks in the 
northern (Geranboyskiy), north-eastern (Terterskiy) and in the 
eastern (Agdamskiy-Agdzhabedinskiy) sections of the front. 
  According to the military sources, the Armenian side bring 
the new armed units to the conflict zone. TURAN was informed by 
the origin in the Defence Ministry of Azerbaijan that during the 
recent fighting several military units of Russian Army was 
observed at the battle zone. The same source announced that the 
Russian Forces fighting in favour of Armenians, occupy the 
inhabited areas and heights and then transfer them to the 
Armenians possession. Only 6 villages in the northern part of 
Agdamskiy region of Azerbaijan had been occupied by the help of 
Russian units during the last week. The same source says that 
the Russian units bring to the battle zone the latest models of 
the military hardware, in particular, the latest tanks as T-80. 
  In the experts opinion the Russian Army's participation in 
the side of the Armenian side is the result of refusal of Baku 
to adopt the Russia's plan of settlement on the Azeri-Armenian 
conflict. It is widely known that the plan provided for the 
Russian military units delivery to the conflict zone.

  [Text] Nagorno-Karabakh "pins certain hopes" on the CIS 
Interparliamentary Assembly, which has stepped up its peace 
mission in an attempt to settle the Karabakh conflict. This has 
been declared in an interview with journalists in Stepanakert by 
Karen Baburyan, the acting chairman of the parliament of the 
self-proclaimed Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. 
  He leads a Karabakh delegation to Kyrgyzstan's capital 
Bishkek to take part in a meeting of the heads of Armenian and 
Azerbaijani parliaments. Mediated by the CIS Interparliamentary 
Assembly, the meeting has been scheduled for 3-6 May. 
  In Baburyan's words, the gathering in Bishkek will largely 
depend on the position of Azerbaijan, "whose leadership is not 
too willing to maintain contact with Karabakh." He noted that 
broader contacts "would help to lead the conflict out of the 
deadlock." 
  Taking part in the Bishkek meeting, initiated by the Kyrgyz 
Parliament's Chairman Meditkan Sherimkulov and the CIS 
Interparliamentary Assembly, will be the Assembly's Chairman 
Vladimir Shumeyko, the head of Russia's Federation Council.

  [Text] Baku, 2 May (TURAN)--Azerbaijan's Ministry of 
Economy handed reviewed prognosis of socio-economic development 
for 1994 to the Ministry of Finance. 
  According to the Milli Majlis, the Ministry of Finance has 
to 
take into account this prognosis when finishing off the work 
over the budget draft. 
  According to prognoses, in 1994 the inflation will total 600 
per cent. In the first variant of the prognoses this figure was 
240 per cent. 
  A representative of the Ministry of Finance told TURAN that 
their employees don't agree to the forecasted level of inflation 
since it does not correspond to real economical situation. Over 
the first quarter of 1994 the inflation totalled 300 percent and 
the production reduced by 25 per cent. 
  The Ministry of Economy forecasted the volume of gross 
national product 910 billion manats and national income 677 
billion manats. In the first variant these figures were 313 and 
272 billion manats, relatively.

  [Text] The Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze has declared 
that last week's appointment of the Lieutenant-General Varden 
Nadibaidze, the former deputy commander of a group of Russian 
troops in Transcaucasia, to the post of republican defence 
minister, starts a new stage in building up the Georgian armed 
forces. "New professional approaches are essential. That's 
precisely what guided me in nominating Nadibaidze to the 
office," Shevardnadze remarked and described the new minister as 
"an experienced specialist, a good organizer, versed in army 
matters and weaponry." 
  He emphasized that "without cooperation and friendship with 
Russia at this stage it is impossible to man a truly national 
Georgian Army to guarantee the country's independence." This, 
in his words, is clear from the experience of the last few years. 
  Turning to a scandal in Georgian parliament on 28 April, 
when 
the Vice-Speaker Vakhtang Rcheulishvili splashed water out of a 
glass into the face of the Popular Front's leader Nodar Natadze, 
Shevardnadze declared that there are forces in parliament today, 
wishing to rekindle instability in the country. He dismissed 
these attempts as unnecessary and unfeasible. 
  In conclusion, he called Georgian citizens for unity and 
concord.

  [Text] Eduard Shevardnadze, head of the Georgian state, 
gave his traditional radio address to the nation on 2 May. With 
the details from Tbilisi is Nikolay Mamuashvili: 
  [Mamuashvili] In his address, Shevardnadze wished all the 
people of the Republic a happy Easter Sunday. Addressing the 
people of the Tskhinval Rayon and Abkhazia, the head of state 
noted that he believed in the day when everyone would be able to 
return to the conflict zones and that Abkhazia and Tskhinval 
Rayon would be able to live a peaceful and calm life. 
  I am profoundly convinced, Shevardnadze went on, that 
Christian morals will give us the right and the 
opportunity--together with the Abkhazians and the Ossetians--to 
heal our deep wounds and to live a peaceful life again. 
  Regarding his recent visit to western Georgia, Shevardnadze 
said that he was happy with the changes he had seen in the 
region, which provide grounds to be confident about the Georgia 
of tomorrow. I have seen well-kept gardens, Shevardnadze said, 
and people working in the fields. Practically all enterprises 
in industrial Kutaisi have started working again. The highway 
to the mountains of Svanetia has opened. Everything is being 
done to ensure order in Adzharia, Kakhetia, and other regions of 
the country. 
  In Shevardnadze's opinion, we are standing on the threshold 
of serious positive changes that will be beneficial to the 
Republic. 
  In his speech, the head of the state also touched upon the 
question of forming a new Georgian national army, which, as he 
put it, needs not just bare enthusiasm but professionalism, 
order, and discipline. It is precisely this, Shevardnadze went 
on, that guided me when I proposed General Nabaidze to the post 
of Georgian defense minister, who has passed through a fine 
school in the Russian Army. The head of state stressed, I quote: 
The bitter experience of the past has proved that, without 
close contacts with Russia, we will be unable to create a 
full-blooded, normal army that, as in all countries of the 
world, should be the guarantor of democracy, peace, and 
stability.

<F P=106> [Aleksey Sinelnikov report: "Yet Another Change of Money </F>
Looms in Georgia"] 
  [Text] Tbilisi -- According to figures from the State 
Committee for Socioeconomic Information, the per capita cost of 
a basket of consumer goods as of early April had reached 25.7 
million coupons, while the subsistence minimum was 17.5 million. 
At the same time, the minimum wage was still 50,000 coupons -- 
slightly more than 83 rubles. 
  These figures relate to early April, when the Georgian unit 
was much higher. Since then it has fallen by another 250. 
There is probably nowhere that the Russian ruble is valued so 
much -- in Tbilisi, for instance, it sells for more than 600 
coupons. 
  Today we can already say that the Georgian monetary unit is 
dying. Having existed for just over a year, it has almost 
ceased to have any meaning. Bread, flour, municipal services, 
and transportation costs are fully subsidized by the state, an 
800-gram loaf costs just over 1 ruble in Russian money, while a 
trip on the subway costs just 1 kopek. Budget expenditure is 
270 percent higher than revenue, and no end to hyperinflation is 
yet in sight. In recent days the country's top financial and 
economic leaders have been talking more and more often about the 
need to immediately introduce a new national currency -- the 
"lari." According to some reports, one tonne of this currency 
is already stored in the republic's warehouses.

  [Excerpt] Monday, 2 May -- A summit meeting might help to 
end the deadlock in Estonian-Russian relations, President 
Lennart Meri told at a meeting with a group of Russian 
journalists on Thursday [28 April]. 
  Delayed negotiations have a negative feature of making the 
delegations concentrate on details and forcing them to forget 
the strategic directions, Meri said. He hoped that a meeting 
with the Russian president might give new life to the 
negotiations. The president admitted that his contacts with 
Boris Yeltsin have been limited to letters so far. "Obviously, 
the relations with the Baltic states are not a central issue of 
the Russian foreign policy and the negotiations have been slowed 
down accordingly," he said. 
  Meri welcomed the idea of finding an international mediator, 
for example, the president of Finland. He also said that the 
freezing of the Estonian-Russian border issue for 5-10 years 
could be possible in order to enable to find a correct solution 
to the issue. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Estonian Foreign Minister Juri Luik once again 
stressed his firm commitment not to make concessions to Russia 
in the issue of the retired military and criticized the 
country's attempts to apply provisions in Russian-Latvian 
agreement also to its draft agreement with Estonia. 
  "We consider unconstructive the attempts by the Russian part 
to apply provisions in Latvian-Russian agreements to 
Estonian-Russian draft agreements," Luik said on commenting 
Latvian-Russian agreements signed in Moscow on Saturday [30 
April]. 
  Such attempts make it impossible to make any progress at 
negotiations, because Estonia and Russia must find their own 
solutions corresponding to specific relations between the two 
countries, Luik said. 
  Luik considered positive the agreement on Russian troop 
pullout from Latvia while stressing the importance of troop 
withdrawal timetable presented by Russia. 
  "Russia has a unique possibility," Luik said while adding 
that troop pullout from Latvia and Estonia by 31 August deadline 
would eliminate a major issue of dispute between Russia and the 
Western countries opening the doors to the country's accession 
to the Council of Europe. 
  On commenting other agreements signed between the two 
countries, Luik said "Estonia does not accept binding troop 
pullout to any additional conditions." 
  "A protocol later added to the agreement on retired military 
does not give the Latvian Government the right to control 
issuing residence permits to the retired military," Luik said. 
"...Estonia is not going to give up that right," he added. 
  It was very important that Boris Yeltsin denounced crimes 
committed in Latvia by the Stalinist regime, Luik said while 
adding that Estonian people could appreciate a similar gesture 
towards Estonia.

  [Text] Paris 3 May TASS -- Estonian Prime Minister Mart 
Laar arrived in Paris for a two-day official visit on Monday 
evening. It was learned here from diplomatic sources that he 
plans to discuss with French leaders the problem of European 
security, development of cooperation between Estonia and the 
European Union, the state of Russo-Estonian relations, and also 
the prospects for strengthening bilateral relations between 
Paris and Tallinn. 
  Estonia is showing interest in French Premier Eduard 
Balladur's initiative to conclude a pact on stability in Europe. 
It has already joined the NATO-proposed "Partnership for Peace" 
programme. Moreover, Estonia has concluded several commercial

Estonian law on foreigners and its legal logic. 
  The ambassadors who attended the meeting noted that the EU's 
position on troop withdrawal remains the same, which means that

August. The EU has also notified the Russian Federation of this 
position.

of aliens as well as about reorganization of the citizenship and

  [Excerpt] Riga, May 02, BNS -- Latvian and Russian state 
delegations signed a protocol on the most favored nation status 
in economy, Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs told reporters 
Sunday [1 May] on return from Moscow. 
  Under the protocol, the favored nation relations take effect 
starting 1 June. The respective agreement is scheduled for the 
second half of May when Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin tours Riga. 
  Birkavs draw a link between the achieved compromise on the 
amount of rent for the Skrunda radar and the agreement on the 
most favored nation status in economy. 
  As reported, Russia initially offered Latvia 2 million U.S. 
dollars per year while Latvia demanded 400 million U.S. dollars 
per year. 
  The 30 April troop withdrawal treaty provides for a 
$5-million yearly rent. Birkavs pledged to channel the funding 
for the needs of Skrunda locals who will have to put up with the 
radar for four more years. 
  Latvia needs long-term goodneighborly relations with Russia, 
said Birkavs. He claimed that Latvia and Russia faced a new 
historic epoch in this aspect. 
  "The new, democratic Russia understands Latvia's problems 
and 
the signature of the agreements will consolidate democracy also 
in Russia itself," noted Birkavs. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Riga, 2 May, BNS -- U.S. President Bill Clinton on 
Saturday [30 April] welcomed the signing of an agreement on 
Russian troop withdrawal from Latvia. 
  The withdrawal package was signed by Presidents Guntis 
Ulmanis of Latvia and Boris Yeltsin of Russia in Moscow on 
Saturday. 
  Clinton in his foreign policy radio address the same day 
called the Latvian-Russian agreement historic, adding that 
"these and other promising developments were made possible, in 
part, by American support and resolve." 
  The United States had an important role in helping to 
overcome a deadlock during the talks on the issue of the Russian 
early-warning radar station at Skrunda, Latvia. 
  The U.S. President at his visit to Moscow in January 
received 
Russia's proposal, according to which the facility remains under 
Russian control for the next four years, plus for a 1.5-year 
term necessary for its dismantling. 
  This proposal, later accepted by Latvia, was turned over in 
Washington to Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis during his late 
January-early February visit.

extended the deadline for accepting lists of candidates by 9 May 
in a number of regions. It also decided to convene a meeting of 
election coordinators, Budget Minister Janis Platais and MP's to 
tackle the financial problems of elections. 
  As reported, the Central Electoral Committee requested the 
related institutions to increase the funding for the elections. 
Platais said the claim was ungrounded. 
  Electoral Committee member Dzintars Rasnacs stressed that 
the 
work of regional commissions may be hampered by the lack of 
resources and the financial shortfall may even obstruct the 
organization of local elections. The committee plans to inform 
about the situation Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs if the 
resources are not allotted soon.

  [Text] The head of Lithuania's parliament, Ceslovas 
Jursenas, has expressed approval of the results of an 30 April 
meeting between the presidents of Russia and Latvia, Boris 
Yeltsin and Guntis Ulmanis. 
  In an interview with INTERFAX, Jursenas described an 
agreement on a deadline for Russian troop withdrawal from Latvia 
as "the most important achievement" of the meeting. 
  He said the accords signed by the two presidents were 
"undoubtedly significant" not only for Russia and Latvia but for 
the entire Baltic region. Thus, they could help negotiate a 
deadline for Russian troop withdrawal from Estonia, he said. 
  Commenting on last week's reception by Lithuanian President 
Algirdas Brazauskas of a letter from Yeltsin, Jursenas expressed 
the hope that the two presidents' exchange of letters "will help 
eliminate moot points and problems in the relations between our 
two countries." 
  But he said he could not understand why Russia unilaterally 
suspended agreements that had already been reached. He said 
Lithuania takes the position that signed agreements must be 
carried out and that other problems, such as that of Russia's 
exclave Kaliningrad Region, must be negotiated after or 
simultaneously with that. "We understand the interests of 
Russia, but Russia must also understand and respect our 
interests," he said.

  "The negotiation process with Russia which has caused many 
disputes in Latvia has ended very effectively, namely with the 
signing of very important documents," Brazauskas said in an 
interview with the national radio on Monday. 
  He said that on Tuesday the leaders of the three Baltic 
states -- Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia -- will meet in Riga, 
adding that "we have what to discuss." 
  Brazauskas recalled that during Polish President Lech 
Walesa's recent visit to Lithuania they signed a treaty of 
friendship and cooperation between the two countries. "I think 
it will be interesting for my Latvian and Estonian colleagues to 
hear our opinion about that document. For my part, I would like 
to learn about the results of Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis's 
visit to Moscow and his talks with Russian leaders," he said.

  [Text] Vilnius, 2 May, BNS -- A high-ranking Russian 
Foreign Ministry official should come to Lithuania to discuss 
relations between the two countries, Lithuanian Foreign Minister 
Povilas Gylys said Monday [2 May] after his meeting with 
President Algirdas Brazauskas. 
  Gylys told reporters that he and Brazauskas spoke about the 
exchange of letters between Lithuanian and Russian presidents, 
as well as the problems discussed in them. "There are things to 
negotiate about," Gylys said, but noted that preparations for 
further talks only started. 
  Brazauskas last Friday received Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin's letter implying that the implementation of bilateral 
economic treaties is bound up with the problem of Russian 
transit to the Kaliningrad region through Lithuanian territory. 
  Minister Gylys emphasized that Russian transit through 
Lithuania is currently carried out according to Lithuanian 
rules. The minister said he intends to discuss the strategy of 
transit talks with the head of the working group for talks with 
the CIS, Virgilijus Bulovas. 
  Gylys said he and Brazauskas also discussed the results of 
the minister's recent visits to the United States and several 
Latin American countries. The minister said they analyzed 
proposals for political, economic, diplomatic and cultural 
cooperation brought from Venezuela, Brazil, Uruguay, and 
Argentina.

  [Text] Vilnius, 2 May, BNS -- Lithuanian Parliament 
Chairman Ceslovas Jursenas says he is pleased with the 
agreements signed between Latvia and Russia to withdraw Russian 
troops from Latvian territory by 31 Aug. 
  At a press conference in Vilnius Monday [2 May], Jursenas 
said he is glad that "one more Baltic state will be free of a 
foreign army." 
  The parliament chairman noted, however, that the agreements 
signed last Saturday in Moscow are not as good as "wanted by 
Latvia and us." Jursenas said his reservation primarily concerns 
a permission for Russia to keep its radar base in Skrunda for 
another several years, although "forward movement is impossible 
without compromises." 
  Jursenas criticized Vytautas Landsbergis, leader of the 
rightist opposition in the Lithuanian parliament, for calling 
Latvia the weakest Baltic link that was broken by Russia. The 
parliament chairman said it is unethical to "criticize a sister 
of one fate in such a way and to call her names." 
  Jursenas also praised the first all-race election in the 
"far-away" South Africa. He said the election buried the 
apartheid system, which has completely discredited itself in the 
course of years. The South African election was observed by 
Lithuanian Parliament Vice Chairman Aloyzas Sakalas.

  [Text] Vytautas Landsbergis, leader of the Seimas 
right-wing opposition, has warned that no concessions should be 
made to Russia because this would mean that Russia's method of 
arm-twisting has been recognized, and new pressures would follow. 
  This is how Vytautas Landsbergis commented on the news that 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin admitted in his letter to 
Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas that Russia linked the 
implementation of economic agreements signed last autumn with 
transit from the Karaliaucius [Kaliningrad] region. 
  Having received this letter, President Algirdas Brazauskas 
told journalists that Lithuania cannot agree to Russia's policy 
in this respect. According to him, the agreement signed in 
Vilnius last November was the result of one stage of 
negotiations, however, negotiations concerning the transit from 
the Kaliningrad region and the visa regime is a matter of 
further negotiations. 
  Vytautas Landsbergis said that he believes that President 
Algirdas Brazauskas is not inclined to give in, however, 
contracts and prices for transit fixed by lower-ranking 
officials remain in the realm of unanswered questions. If the 
income for the state budget is rejected by one's own will, then 
this looks like corruption, Vytautas Landsbergis said [sentence 
as heard]. This was a Baltic News Service report.

  [Text] Vilnius 2 May TASS--"The negotiation process with 
Russia, which has slightly slowed down lately, continues and we 
hope that sooner or later we will reach an agreement with 
Moscow," Lithuanian Ambassador at Large Virgilius Bulovas, head 
of the Lithuanian delegation to the talks with CIS states, said. 
  In an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS on Monday, Bulovas 
said that "it was not Lithuania's fault that the agreement 
signed by the prime ministers of the two countries in Vilnius on 
18 November 1993 on most favoured nation trading status never 
came into force. The agreement is of great importance for 
Lithuania because Russia is our major economic partner," he 
added. 
  Moscow sets forth more and more new conditions, including 
guarantees for the economy of the Kaliningrad region, Russia's 
westernmost enclave, its military and transit through Lithuania, 
Bulovas said. 
  He stressed that "we want it (transit) to be based on the 
republic's legislation and properly drawn documents, that's all. 
Lithuania will not take any steps which may damage the region's 
economy." 
  "However, if Russia continues the policy of `delays' with 
regard to the enactment of the aforementioned agreement on 
trade, thus pushing us, intentionally or not, towards the West, 
Lithuania will undertake adequate measures," Bulovas said.

<F P=106> [Vasiliy Ustyuzhanin report: "I Came, I Saw, I Signed. </F>
Religious Leaders Unanimous About Accord Treaty, Politicians 
Dubious"] 
  [Text] Our poor world loves a good argument. Judging by 
everything, most leaders of regions and political movements were 
guided by precisely this formula when they arrived in St. 
George's Hall 28 April to sign the Social Accord Treaty. 
Republic presidents, heads of kray and oblast administrations, 
and legislative assembly chairmen from virtually every region 
signed it. It was not signed only by N. Vinogradov and A. 
Tuleyev, chairmen of the legislative assemblies of Vladimir and 
Kemerovo Oblasts. Nikolay Vinogradov referred to the fact that 
he had not received the blessing of his legislative assembly. 
Aman Tuleyev commented clearly: "Let the president look at the 
lives of the miners. If something were to change for the better 
in their lives, I would sign it." 
  Nonetheless, all the rest were far more amenable. Why? 
  N. Fedorov, president of the Republic of Chuvashia: 
  "The treaty will not do any harm. In general I think that 
this is not currently the most important document that we should 
be fighting for. The reforms are not working. That is our 
headache." 
  M. Shaymiyev, president of the Republic of Tatarstan: 
  "Without some kind of agreement in Moscow it will be hard to 
advance the reforms in the republics. So my signature is also a 
mark of support for the center." 
  A. Galazov, president of the Republic of North Ossetia: 
  "Ossetia wants to live in a strong and peaceful Russia. I 
hope that the treaty will serve this purpose at least in some 
measure." 
  Yu. Vlasov, head of the Vladimir Oblast Administration: "I 
realize that the treaty is not historic. But it would be silly 
just now not to support any steps toward consensus." 
  So in territorial terms the concluded treaty may indeed have 
an effect. But what about in political terms? For instance, 
Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, leader of the "Yabloko" parliamentary 
faction, did not pay his respects to the important Kremlin 
meeting at all; Vladimir Lukin, the other leader of the bloc, 
did so, but "purely symbolically"; while Vladimir Lysenko, 
leader of the Russian Republican Party, which is part of 
"Yabloko," appended his monogram. It is easy to predict that, 
even if organizational conclusions do not follow, some kind of 
action, angry response, or set-to is inevitable. 
  Gennadiy Zyuganov, leader of the Communist Party of Russia, 
also came up with a strong political trump card, which he played 
in the lobby: "They're good bedfellows -- Yeltsin, Gaydar, and 
Zhirinovskiy. We want nothing to do with it." 
  Vasiliy Lipitskiy, leader of the "Free Russia" People's 
Party, called the treaty an "agreement on the inviolability of 
the regime," and does not believe that the Kremlin has taken a 
step toward political peace. Nor were the Cossacks unanimous -- 
some hetman leaders came to St. George's Hall with their swords 
drawn, while others did not even think about leaving the 
confines of their own groups [pokidat predely svoikh volnits]. 
  Only various religious leaders -- Orthodox, Muslim, and 
Buddhist -- were unanimous. They did not make any preconditions 
-- they came, they saw, they signed. The head of the Russian 
Orthodox Church even made a good speech to mark the occasion. 
  So the likelihood of the treaty soon being forgotten cannot 
be ruled out. A great deal will now depend on the press. It is 
clear from the text of the treaty that the president is tasking 
it with monitoring the fulfillment of the treaty conditions. 
Well, that is something we are used to. That is not our main 
problem. The most important thing is that the press is not 
finally stifled by means of prices for newsprint and 
distribution. Otherwise there will be nobody left to call on 
people to be "pro" or "con."

<F P=106> [Lyubov Tsukanova report: "Hard Work and Fine Words"] </F>
  [Text] Most politicians who took part in the Civic Accord 
Assembly came along with the firm intention of signing the 
Treaty on Social Accord. Your ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondent 
was told by Anatoliy Tyazhlov, head of the Moscow Oblast 
administration, that he like others is carrying out the 
population's mandate. "The people have told us politicians on 
many occasions: Stop these battles and finally get down to the 
business of the economy and the social program." That is what 
we must now tackle in earnest, A. Tyazhlov believes. It is his 
conviction that the process of accord should "go downward": At 
any rate the oblast leadership intends to implement a similar 
conciliation procedure in the Moscow region. The Treaty must 
not be just an action on the part of Moscow and the Kremlin. 
  The Democratic Party of Russia is insisting on the Treaty's 
being given real substance; it is pressing for the process to be 
continued in conciliation procedures and for common solutions to 
be found in the economy and in policy, foreign policy included. 
Its leader Nikolay Travkin believes that the Treaty is designed 
to "launch the process" and is therefore essential as the first 
step on this difficult road. Federation Council member Vladimir 
Podoprigora is convinced that the signing is an extremely 
important moment, heralding an end to the stereotypical quest 
for an enemy that has become entrenched over many decades. 
People may express different political ideas, but they realize 
that the interests of society and the country are paramount and 
so renounce confrontation. The deputy hopes that a social 
atmosphere geared to accord can also prevail upon the hardline 
opposition, but in order for this he thinks it necessary to stop 
bad-mouthing those who have not signed the treaty. The 
opposition's opinion must be taken into consideration in order 
to adjust one's own policy and formulate the optimum state 
decisions. 
  This idea was indirectly reaffirmed by Gennadiy Zyuganov, 
leader of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, who did 
not sign the treaty but said in the lobbies that the idea of 
accord is not alien to Communists and they will do their part to 
secure accord. But we would like to see concrete steps from the 
president and the government, G. Zyuganov said. We would like 
to see dialogue, support for the agro-industrial complex, and a 
real fight against corruption. 
  Representatives of the "Yabloko" deputies' faction did not 
sign the agreement on civic peace yesterday either. But that 
does not mean that the faction renounces accord, so one of its 
leaders, Vladimir Lukin, said. On the contrary it is willing to 
take an active part in all specific measures to establish real 
civic peace and promote real reforms, movement toward democracy, 
and maximum accord during this movement. 
  Nor did the Textile and Light Industry Workers' Trade Union 
immediately decide to subscribe to the Treaty. The position in 
the sector is a complex one, the trade union's chairman, Tatyana 
Sosnina, said. We held a protest action and picketed the 
government building but then we met with Viktor Chernomyrdin, 
decisions were adopted regarding support for the sector, and a 
sectoral wage agreement was signed. After which the presidium 
and the trade union's grassroots organizations authorized their 
leader to sign the treaty. Tatyana Sosnina believes that the 
treaty should be supplemented with concrete documents and that 
there should be economic "roundtables," where trade unions could 
highlight their position and protect working people's interests. 
  The document will work, Federation Council Deputy Chairman 
Valeryan Viktorov said, if all contracting parties really want 
to make definite concessions and compromises. The stabilization 
of the economic processes is undoubtedly one of the main 
conditions for accord in society. But the economy is now 
perhaps to a greater extent the hostage of politics, he said. 
If we can reach accord, things will be easier in the economy 
too. And the reverse will also happen: A normal economy will 
gradually stabilize the political process. 
  Everyone needs social accord. It is essential above all in 
order to extricate Russia from the protracted and profound 
economic crisis. As Akhsarbek Galazov, president of North 
Ossetia, said figuratively, it is necessary to unite in order 
for everyone to survive our cold political winter and to save 
Russia.

<F P=106> [Article by Viktor Stepanov, head of Republic of Karelia </F>
Government, under the "Politics" rubric: "Confrontation Is 
Hopeless, Viktor Stepanov, Head of Karelia Government Believes"] 
  [Text] When pondering the prospect of securing civil 
accord, I remember December 1992 and the Seventh Congress of 
People's Deputies. The country was on the verge of an acute 
crisis, but a means of accord was found then nonetheless. 
Regrettably, it was later cut short by the hard-line stance of 
both sides -- that is how I regard the political events of the 
past year. And that is why I am convinced that it is not enough 
to make commitments, you have to know how to carry them out. I 
also apply that to myself. And that is what I expect of others 
too. We have a Constitution. However anyone looks at it, it has 
been adopted and is in force. And I think that not only the 
rights but also the duties of citizens, including officials and 
including in connection with the signing of the Treaty on Social 
Accord, should be observed. Not only in the political but also 
in the economic sphere. The state must make concrete pledges to 
formulate ways of escaping from the crisis. I am profoundly 
convinced that if we do not find ways of stabilizing the 
economy, ways of financial recovery, if we do not overcome the 
paralysis of the financial-credit system, this treaty may remain 
a pipe dream. Accord in society depends on the position of huge 
social groups of the population, and if we do not succeed in 
halting the impoverishment of the very poor, it will be fairly 
hard to actually secure accord. I think that the treaty is the 
first step toward our getting away from last year's tragedy. 
Confrontation is hopeless. I think that both those who 
subscribed to and are yet to subscribe to the treaty and those 
who do not sign it should all realize the responsibility they 
bear. It is not a question of each one of us, it is a question 
of Russian citizens and Russia.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "In Favor of Accord in Action"] </F>
  [Text] The opposition movement "Accord for Russia" shares 
the idea of social accord, but regards the treaty signed the 
other day as "another act of propaganda in which correct slogans 
merely serve to conceal an inept and destructive policy." 
  Accord cannot be achieved by the mere signing of an 
ostentatious document without specific commitments to society by 
the authorities, a statement adopted by the movement yesterday 
at an enlarged session of its council says. The document was 
circulated yesterday at a press conference of its leaders. The 
following participated in it: Gennadiy Zyuganov, leader of the 
Communist Party of the Russian Federation; Vasiliy Lipitskiy, 
chairman of the Board of the People's Party Free Russia (the 
party of Aleksandr Rutskoy); Mikhail Lapshin, leader of the 
Agrarian Party of Russia; Sergey Baburin, chairman of the 
Russian National Union; Stanislav Govorukhin and Sergey Glazyev, 
representatives of the Democratic Party of Russia faction; 
Aleksandr Prokhanov, chief editor of the newspaper ZAVTRA; and 
Aleksandr Tsipko, political scientist. 
  The authors of the statement consider that it is necessary 
first and foremost to agree on a change in the government course 
and on measures to save Russia, including "restoring the 
effectiveness of state power," preventing further growth in 
crime, and instilling order in the management of state property. 
  The initiators of the "Accord for Russia" movement issued a 
statement, which says in particular: 
  We are ready to seek accord through specific actions rather 
than participating in another act of propaganda where correct 
slogans and words merely serve to conceal an inept and 
destructive policy. Subscribing to it would mean agreeing to the 
destruction of the country's scientific and industrial complex, 
the mass plunder of state property and embezzlement of state 
funds, the degradation of our people, and the destruction of 
national spiritual values and culture. 
  All of us today have to agree first and foremost on a change 
of government course and on immediate measures to save Russia, 
including 
  -- restoring the effectiveness of state power; 
  -- preventing any exacerbation of crime and corruption and 
taking tough measures to ensure citizens are really safe and 
their property secure; 
  -- instilling order in the management of state property and 
finances, preventing the economic bankruptcy of the state, 
achieving economic stabilization, and implementing progressive 
structural changes in the economy; 
  -- ensuring proper social protection and fair distribution 
of 
the hardships involved in overcoming the crisis among all strata 
of society; 
  -- searching for ways to meet the state's commitments to 
millions of depositors in view of the depreciation of their 
savings, instilling order in privatization, and ensuring the 
real protection of the interests of ordinary shareholders; 
  Accord and unification of society are only possible on the 
basis of these specific objectives and specific actions by the 
authorities. 
  We advocate accord in action rather than mere words. We can 
see a way of extricating the country from socioeconomic 
catastrophe and saving the Russian state and are ready to pool 
our efforts to further this great aim. 
  [dated] 27 April 1994.

<F P=106> [Valentina Nikiforova report: "Nonsignatories"] </F>
  [Text] Here is the official report -- of the 248 
participants in the assembly, 245 signed the "Social Accord 
Treaty." Those are impressive figures. It was not signed by G. 
Zyuganov, chairman of the Russian Federation Communist Party 
Central Executive Committee, or by N. Vinogradov and A. Tuleyev, 
chairmen of the oblast legislative assemblies of Vladimir and 
Kemerovo Oblasts respectively. 
  That would seem to be minor opposition. But that depends. 
If the leader of one of the largest political parties, which 
won one-third of the seats in the Federal Assembly elections, 
does not sign, then the organizers of the second edition of the 
failed "political new year" should ponder on it. It is not as a 
result of trivial disagreements that the Communist leader is 
refusing to sign -- the party disagrees with the policy of the 
president and the government and is calling for it to be 
changed. For the sake of peace, harmony, and a dignified life. 
  The Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin deputies' faction was among 
the 
refuseniks. Its leader rightly believes that agreement can only 
be achieved on a specific issue. 
  The Agrarian Party of Russia had reasonable objections. The 
court chroniclers have called them self-seeking. Perhaps 
because the agrarians are sounding the alarm? Spring is in full 
swing, and there are major difficulties with the sowing -- what 
will be left in the silos this fall?... 
  So those who are not signing the red papers are people whose 
view of Russia is not conditioned by the Kremlin.

  [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin has approved an 
initiative by Russian legal scholars on conducting research into 
ways and means of strengthenening Russian statehood. The head 
of state's press service reports that the president also 
confirmed by edict the main areas of this research which 
primarily concerns the formulation of legal enactments that have 
to be in line with the constitution. 
  One of the primary tasks envisioned is the drafting of laws 
on the government and on federal ministries. Scholars also 
believe that legal enactments relating to the observance and 
protection of human rights and freedoms need to be brought into 
line with generally accepted principles and standards of 
international law.

  [Text] Moscow May 3 TASS -- "Every Russian citizen must 
always be sure that he will get only trustworthy information, 
only the truth from our newspapers, magazines, television and 
radio," Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin says in his message 
of greetings to Russian journalists on the occasion of the world 
freedom of the press day and the opening of the spring holidays 
of the free press. 
  "On the day of your professional holiday I want to wish you 
all from the bottom of my heart the best of health, creactive 
achievements, and successes in your far from easy job," the 
document says. "I respect your work very much, because it 
requires not only skill, but courage, civic audacity, and a huge 
sense of responsibility for the future and honour of our great 
Russia." 
  Chernomyrdin stresses that the freedom of the press, which 
is 
now the common boon of all the Russian people, is a great social 
achievement of the reviving Russia, which gives the journalists 
access to any information. "The government," the premier said, 
"is doing everything it can to allow every journalist, every 
citizen, to exercise his right to obtain information. It will 
back the mass media as much as it can, will make a practical 
contribution to the successful work of newspaper workers, 
publishers, TV and radio journalists."

  [Text] Let me introduce my interlocutor. Abdulakh 
Mikitayev was born in 1942 in the village of Malka, in 
Kabardino-Balkaria, 30 km from Pyatigorsk. After secondary 
school he went to the Mendeleyev Chemical Technical Institute in 
Moscow. As a postgraduate student he defended his candidate's 
dissertation. Then, as a young "mature" academic, he went to 
Nalchik to teach at the Kabardino-Balkaria University. He soon 
became a senior lecturer and head of a department and took a 
doctorate. He created a whole scientific school in the field of 
polymer chemistry. On a voluntary basis he chaired the 
Kabardino-Balkar Republic Committee for the Defense of Peace. 
In the last Russian Supreme Soviet he was head of the science 
subcommittee. In March 1992 he became chairman of the Russian 
Federation President's Citizenship Commission. 
  [Musiyenko] Abdulakh Kasbulatovich, we are not going to look 
now for those to blame for the disintegration of the USSR or 
discuss whether that could have been prevented. Unfortunately, 
the fact remains that the Soviet state no longer exists and tens 
of millions of Russians and those who consider Russian their 
native language suddenly found themselves in a foreign country, 
albeit a "neighbor." Their fate in many former Union republics 
is, to put it mildly, unenviable. 
  [Mikitayev] You are right, the disintegration of the Soviet 
Union was a tragedy for many people, very many people. In 
recognizing the newly independent states formed from the 
republics of the former USSR, Russia proceeded from the premise 
that their governments, in accordance with the norms of 
international law, would fulfill their duty toward Soviet 
citizens and not allow their ethnic, linguistic, religious, or 
other rights to be infringed. Such principles are enshrined in a 
number of international conventions as well as in treaties 
between the Russian Federation and the states which have 
achieved independence. But what happened was that real 
sovereignty went to the heads of the ruling politicians there to 
such an extent that they got carried away and embarked on a 
course of driving the Russian language out of use in society and 
offended the Russian-speaking population in every way possible. 
That is true above all of the Baltic countries, but in some CIS 
states, too, people hailing from Russia are now living in a 
state of spiritual oppression. 
  You have noted, of course, that the Russian Federation as 
the 
successor in law to the USSR is trying to defend the rights of 
former Soviet citizens and to that end is employing diplomatic 
channels and the authority of various international 
organizations. With some success. But unfortunately by no means 
total success. Because even within the framework of the CIS 
there is still no efficient mechanism for implementing treaties 
and agreements signed by the heads of states. Nor are there any 
mandatory sanctions which follow inevitably if accords are not 
observed. I hope that these shortcomings will be eliminated in 
due course. 
  [Musiyenko] Let us clarify whom precisely you are concerned 
about. Those who have officially been given Russian citizenship 
but are continuing to live in, for example, Uzbekistan? Or 
those who are Russian by blood, irrespective of whether they 
hold citizenship of the Russian Federation? Or citizens of the 
former USSR of any nationality who have been refused citizenship 
of the states on whose territory they are now living? 
  [Mikitayev] All three categories. The Russian Federation 
Law "On Citizenship" allows Russian citizenship to be granted to 
anyone who has retained a USSR citizen's passport regardless of 
their place of residence. But of course, we pay greater 
attention to emigrants from Russia and their offspring. 
  Russians have been living for centuries in many republics -- 
Kazakhstan, for instance -- and have long been part of the 
indigenous population. In the past they occupied vacant lands 
and did not force anyone out. Now, although N. Nazarbayev 
denies that there are interethnic problems in Kazakhstan, what 
we are seeing is an exodus of Russians from that republic to 
Russia. I think the reason why is clear: Russian has lost the 
status of an official language there and it is primarily Kazakhs 
who are being appointed to leading posts even in oblasts where 
Russian speakers predominate. 
  Admittedly, mutual understanding has emerged between Russia 
and Kazakhstan on these problems recently, as is demonstrated by 
the memorandum on the fundamental principles of resolving 
questions connected with the citizenship and legal status of 
Russian Federation citizens permanently resident on Republic of 
Kazakhstan territory and of Republic of Kazakhstan citizens 
permanently resident in Russia, signed by B. Yeltsin and N. 
Nazarbayev. 
  [Musiyenko] There is a great deal of talk today about dual 
citizenship, but many people clearly do not understand what it 
is. 
  [Mikitayev] I also get the feeling that certain heads of 
state have still not grasped the essence of this problem and do 
not understand what moral advantages their states stand to gain 
from the conclusion of dual-citizenship agreements with Russia. 
Clearly they believe that such an agreement will infringe their 
countries' sovereignty. Nothing of the kind. No one would 
claim that France, for example, has ceased to be an independent 
state because it has concluded a dual citizenship agreement with 
Canada, a country with many French-speaking inhabitants. 
  I can also quote a positive example from the CIS. At the end 
of December 1993 an agreement of this type was signed between 
Russia and Turkmenistan. There have been no dire consequences. 
We did not see hordes of Russians resident in Turkmenistan 
hurrying off at the crack of dawn to get an earlier place in the 
waiting line outside the Russian embassy. Why worry, if 
everyone knows that if they need a second passport they can get 
one at any time -- or in five years, or 10.... 
  I would put it this way: The institution of dual citizenship 
is a symbol of trust between two states, evidence that they want 
to live with one another in peace and good-neighborliness, 
without harboring grudges. 
  Incidentally, dual citizenship has long been a reality 
regardless of whether Russia has signed a corresponding 
agreement with another state. Russian legislation does not 
require that you relinquish citizenship of your country of 
residence on receipt of citizenship of the Russian Federation. 
We did that deliberately in the interests of our fellow 
countrymen. Furthermore, the laws of some CIS states grant 
their fellow countrymen the same opportunity (Turkmenistan, 
Kazakhstan). 
  [Musiyenko] Is it difficult for someone living in, say, 
Ukraine, to take out Russian citizenship? 
  [Mikitayev] Legally and technically there are no problems 
here. The problem is that Ukraine does not yet have a network 
of Russian Federation consular establishments. This means that 
in order to take out a Russian passport you have to go all the 
way to Kiev. And that takes time and money. However, in the 
next few months Russia plans to open several consulates on 
Ukrainian territory, including one in Simferopol. 
  [Musiyenko] What advice would you give to those who have 
nevertheless made the difficult decision to leave their old 
haunts and start a new life back in the motherland -- in Russia? 
  [Mikitayev] If you have no family, housing, or work there, 
the best thing to do first is to apply to the Russian Federation 
embassy or consulate, where there are bound to be 
representatives of the federal migration service. They will 
help you choose your future place of residence, obtain a loan, 
and process all the documents. But what often happens is that 
people gather up their possessions, buy tickets, and head for 
Moscow, where they have no accommodation to go to and instead 
camp out in front of various official institutions.... 
  [Musiyenko] I am aware that a concept of Russian Federation 
state policy with regard to fellow countrymen living abroad was 
formulated recently. 
  [Mikitayev] Yes, our commission participated directly in 
its preparation. It covers the most diverse aspects -- from 
efforts aimed at restoring citizen status to the 
"non-indigenous" inhabitants of Latvia and Estonia and the 
enshrinement of the institution of dual citizenship in law to 
the preservation of a single information area on the territory 
of the former USSR and of the Russian language as the means of 
communication among the different nationalities. Based on 
international law and the wealth of world practice we are also 
going to help Russian communities and other associations of 
ethnic Russians in the neighboring foreign countries and give 
those who have decided to migrate to Russia help in settling 
down here. 
  [Musiyenko] Will this concept not remain on paper alone? 
  [Mikitayev] I do not think so. In any event, our 
commission, with the president's support (it was he who, 
concerned for the fate of our fellow countrymen, instructed the 
commission in the fall of 1993 to submit proposals on the 
protection of their rights and interests), will constantly 
monitor the work of the government, the federal migration 
service, and other state organs charged with putting this 
concept into practice. The program for the protection of the 
ethnic Russians in the neighboring foreign countries is already 
near to completion at government level, and a financial basis is 
being prepared for it. 
  [Musiyenko] Is this not going to be another pretext for 
people to accuse Russia of harboring imperial designs? 
  [Mikitayev] Let those who express that opinion have it on 
their conscience. We are acting in the interests of our country 
and of the newly independent states equally. Russia does not 
need another "great migration of the peoples" -- it is simply in 
no position to provide tens of millions of refugees and migrants 
with everything that they need. But the republics of the former 
Union do not need a mass exodus of top-class specialists and 
manpower either: That will inevitably cause them tremendous 
economic harm and will prove to be a time-bomb placed under 
those states. But all this can be avoided; all it needs is for 
discrimination against ethnic Russians [russkiye] and Russian 
speakers to be ended and for their civil rights to be recognized 
in full. Russia, in turn, recognizes the right of other states 
to take care of their fellow countrymen living in the Russian 
Federation. 
  In the long term however, I am confident that we will surely 
arrive at a new union of the European type -- with single 
citizenship and complete freedom of movement, both for the 
workforce and for goods. This will happen not in 50 years time 
but much sooner, because we have not yet forgotten the 
experience of mutual relations among the peoples in the economy, 
culture, and everyday life. The first signs of the approaching 
integration are already in evidence....

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "How Many Unemployed Will There Be?"] </F>
  [Text] The number of Russia's unemployed is rising by 
70,000 a month. The Federal Employment Service [FES] estimates 
that the tendency for unemployment to rise is fairly steady and 
will persist in the near future, Oleg Semenov, head of the FES 
Consolidated Analysis Department, said. 
  Around 1 million Russian citizens today are officially 
ranked 
as unemployed. The service predicts that by the end of the year 
the number of registered unemployed will reach 3 million, or 5 
percent of the working population. According to FES experts, 
the number of jobless and "unofficial" unemployed will reach 12 
million. 
  FES personnel are particularly worried at the increase in 
partial unemployment, i.e. the increase in the number of people 
working part-time or on enforced unpaid leave. 
  O. Semenov hypothesized that by this December there will be 
5-8 million people in partial employment. 
  However he did not agree with the forecast that there will 
be 
an "upsurge" of unemployment in the near future, saying that can 
only happen if "enterprise bankruptcy mechanisms are started up."

<F P=106> [BIZNES-TASS report: "The Lower the Inflation, the Worse </F>
the Recession"] 
  [Text] The first quarter of 1994 saw the greatest 
reduction in industrial production since the reforms began. 
Whereas in February there had been some slowing down in the 
pace of the recession, in March the decline in production 
accelerated again. This information comes from the Russian 
Federation Ministry of the Economy. 
  In the first quarter of 1994 the depth of the recession in 
industrial production was over 20 percent compared with the 
corresponding period last year. Whereas at the beginning of 
last year the dynamics of the recession were beginning to ease 
off, this year the movement is heading upward (January -- 23.1 
percent, February -- 24.1 percent, March -- 27.4 percent). 
  In the opinion of Economy Ministry experts, the greatest 
reduction has occurred in the processing sectors. At 26.8 
percent the fall in the production of consumer goods was greater 
than the fall in industry as a whole. 
  As the chief of a ministry department said in conversation 
with your BIZNES-TASS correspondent, the greatest cause for 
concern today is the fact that the reforms have not touched the 
technological structure of production. The majority of 
enterprises cannot reduce production costs and thus cannot cope 
with the reduced demand, especially at a time of substantially 
increased competition in the domestic market from foreign 
producers.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Kucherenko report: "Third Credit Auction Did Not </F>
Go Ahead"] 
  [Text] The third credit auction to place Bank of Russia 
centralized loans with Moscow banks was to have been held in 
Moscow 26 April, but like the second one it did not go ahead. 
  According to the Central Bank of Russia's Moscow 
administration, a total of 9 billion rubles was put up for 
auction at an annual interest rate of 203 percent, that is 5 
percent below the Central Bank rate. However, none of the 
Moscow banks applied to take part in the auction. 
  It is thought that the reason for this is the extremely 
tough 
requirements that auction participants have to meet, and 
therefore people wanting to buy money were simply afraid of 
showing "Central Bank operatives" the state of their affairs. 
At the same time "robust" Moscow establishments which could 
quite easily have gained access to the auction already have 
adequate resources. There is no reason for them to acquire 
credit: An interbank market developed in Moscow long ago, where 
money can be bought far more cheaply.

<F P=106> [Boris Bronshteyn report: "Kamaz and VAZ Discover Common </F>
Interests"] 
  [Text] Naberezhnyye Chelny -- At a meeting of "KamAZ" 
stockholders, General Director Nikolay Bekh made an announcement 
which many people saw as sensational: "KamAZ" and "VAZ" intend 
to set up a holding-type Volga-Kama financial and industrial 
group. 
  "We have signed a memorandum on the creation of the holding 
company," Nikolay Bekh said in conversation with this IZVESTIYA 
correspondent. "We share many problems with `VAZ.' For 
instance, a whole number of associated plants supply their 
output to `VAZ' and `KamAZ' simultaneously. And both motor 
vehicle plants have an interest in supporting these suppliers. 
Or take a common problem such as capacity utilization at our 
own enterprises, instrument-making, and machine-tool-building 
plants. We will compile a common cyclical timetable for the 
preparation of new vehicles -- both trucks and cars -- and will 
make sure that these plants are operating to full capacity. 
  "One other problem is our representation abroad. Both auto 
giants maintain their own subunits in many countries to deal 
with spares, repairs, and advertising -- and this expenditure 
will be reduced if these efforts are combined." 
  The idea of pooling the motor plants' efforts has been 
around 
for a long time, but, as Bekh said, when state enterprises 
collaborate, ambitions often prevail -- who is more important, 
more significant, older.... But when enterprises are floated, 
people start primarily counting the money and looking to see 
what is more profitable. A vivid example of this is that, 
barely having agreed to set up a holding company, "KamAZ" and 
"VAZ" adopted an agreement which people had tried unsuccessfully 
to achieve for seven years -- it was decided to set up a joint 
company to produce "Oka" cars. 
  "We had each made these cars at our own plans, now assembly 
will take place solely at `KamAZ'," Nikolay Bekh explained. "We 
have built a new block, the `VAZ' will transfer their welding 
equipment to us and increase engine production. We are setting 
ourselves the target of producing 75,000 vehicles a year." 
  In uniting to solve specific problems, "KamAZ" and "VAZ" are 
in no way losing their independence. It is merely a question of 
coordinating their common financial interests. Having won the 
stockholders' support, Nikolay Bekh supposes that the final 
signing of the documents setting up the Volga-Kama financial and 
industrial group will take place no later than May.

  [Text] Currently 742 instances of HIV infection are 
registered in Russia. Specialists think that it is merely a 
tenth of the total number of infected people. 
  The Russian Federal Scientific and Methodological Center to 
combat AIDs is the main body dealing with the problem. Vadim 
Pokrovskiy, its head, said that there was no radical method of 
treatment for AIDS thus far. Prevention is, therefore, the only 
option here. However, it is mainly the costs of treatment that 
are being met so far. Thus, for instance, the 130 AIDS patients 
at the clinic in Sokolinyye Gory are served by personnel 
numbering 340 specialists. 
  Enormous resources are being spent to find out who is 
infected, but there are only three people from the center to 
combat AIDS that work in the area of prevention. 
  This 20th century plague has claimed 105 lives in Russia to 
date.

<F P=106> [Interview with Patriarch Aleksiy of Moscow and All Russia </F>
by special correspondents Aleksandr Kalinin and Dmitriy Shevarov 
"at the patriarch's residence in Moscow"; date not given: "I 
Wish Everyone Spiritual Peace"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] We 
know how badly you feel about the schism in the Orthodox Church 
in Ukraine and the expansion of Catholicism in Belorussia 
[Belarus]. In recent days relations with Ukraine have reached 
the danger mark. Do you intend to undertake any efforts to 
avert schism in the family of Slavic peoples? 
  [Aleksiy] Schism is always a tragedy, always a sorrow. And 
in church life schism is pernicious when people tear themselves 
apart and differ mainly over political, not church issues. We 
have felt keenly, and still feel keenly, what has happened in 
Ukraine. But we are glad that, nevertheless, 5,000 parishes have 
remained true to the church headed by Metropolitan Vladimir, and 
only 400 have broken away. Moreover, many of these are actually 
returning today, and a process of returning to the fold is under 
way in various places. We have granted the Orthodox Church in 
Ukraine and Belorussia autonomy in affairs of internal 
administration, allowing for the fact that the Orthodox Church 
exists in conditions of sovereign states and under the laws 
adopted in these states; but the preservation of organic unity 
is essential. 
  As for expansion, the Catholic expansion occurred several 
years ago in the western oblasts of Ukraine; Polish Catholic 
priests are very active in Belorussia. And were it not for the 
process of the integration of Moscow and Minsk, the ideology of 
the Western world would reach Smolensk. 
  We are not calling for crusades, but we must consolidate 
Orthodox eparchies and revive the parishes which were destroyed. 
Unfortunately, there were many parishes destroyed in Belorussia. 
It was supposed to be the first atheist republic. And this plan 
was systematically implemented. Therefore, the loss which 
Belorussia suffered on the church plane is huge. And to restore 
everything which was destroyed is not so easy. This is our task 
-- to return people to their Orthodox roots. And then it will 
be easier to counter the expansion which is going on. 
  [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] You have been talking with alarm for 
many years about the wave of foreign missionaries and preachers 
that has swamped Russia and the perniciousness of the spread of 
sects, but the situation seems to be becoming increasingly 
forlorn. It is obvious that the Russian Orthodox Church has 
proved to be unprepared for such strong propaganda pressure from 
all sides. 
  [Aleksiy] Unfortunately, we are not on equal terms with all 
the foreign missionaries and priests who have flooded into 
Russia today. I have received many letters appealing to me: 
Surely you have someone you can send on to television; why do 
we have to watch Korean, Japanese, and American priests on three 
television channels on a Sunday? We have people to send, and we 
have frequently raised the question of being granted airtime. 
This question is moving forward, but it is difficult; meanwhile 
foreign missionaries and priests have paid for airtime up to the 
end of the year. 
  The archbishop of Vladivostok recently told me that 
Vladivostok has been inundated with protestants from China, 
Japan, and South Korea -- souls are being bought. The highest 
price is a tanned fur coat; the usual is a humanitarian aid 
package. 
  Once again we are not in an equal position. For instance, in 
the Cathedral Church of the Epiphany in Moscow the only thing 
that we are able to do for our fellow citizens for Easter is to 
bake and hand out around 3,000 Easter cakes to the needy.

<F P=106> [Article by Andrey Kokoshin, Russian Federation first deputy </F>
defense minister, under the "Russian Weapons" rubric: 
"Country's Security Cannot Be Ensured without Strong Defense 
Industry"] 
  [Text] The existence of modern, powerful armed forces is 
impossible without a strong defense industry, design bureaus, 
scientific collectives, and stable cooperation in the 
development and production of arms. That is axiomatic. 
  In turn defense production facilities can be effective under 
present conditions if they are part of powerful diversified 
industrial companies and financial and industrial groups -- 
efficient components of the market economy. 
  Today the defense industry and science complex is living 
through exceptionally complex times. In the past few years it 
has undergone substantial changes. On average at enterprises of 
Russia's former defense complex the volume of defense production 
is 20 percent of the total production volume. Despite all 
efforts, the optimum path for the development of defense science 
and technology and defense production facilities under the 
conditions of the changes taking place in our country has still 
not been elaborated. Although many outlines of this path have 
already become clearer. Collective intelligence is needed for 
its elaboration, as is the comprehensive examination not only of 
the military, economic, and technological aspects but also of 
the social and legal aspects of this problem. 
  The new supplement in KRASNAYA ZVEZDA can ensure such 
collective thinking. KRASNAYA ZVEZDA has already done quite a 
lot to cover these problems under present conditions but I am 
sure that it can do even more. 
  Today a particularly strict, self-critical, extremely 
attentive and scrupulous examination of the problems of 
providing arms for the army and navy is needed. I think that 
with this sober, analytical approach constantly illumined with a 
high sense of concern for Russia's supreme interests and for our 
fatherland's defense capability, our newspaper's new supplement 
will be an important step forward in preserving and augmenting 
Russia's defense industry potential in its optimum dimensions 
for the state and the army. 
  I very much hope that the newspaper will inter alia help 
reveal and educate new leaders of our defense industry and 
science. And for that, however paradoxical it may seem, you 
often have to look into the past and extract from it as much as 
you can in the way of lessons for the present and future.

<F P=106> [Interview with Colonel General Anatoliy Sitnov, chief of </F>
the Russian Federation Armed Forces Armaments, by correspondent 
Valentin Rudenko under the "Russian Weapons" rubric, date and 
place of interview not stated: "It Is Not Enough To Replace 
Anger with Kindness or How Further Reduction of Volumes of 
Financing for State Defense Order Could End"] 
  [Text] It is no secret that in recent years the defense 
complex has been seen by public opinion as virtually a monster 
growing fat on the people's money, which means our money. 
Today, thank god, it seems everyone has worked out who is who. 
Now calls of another kind are being heard -- calls to save the 
defense industry which, as a result of the overwhelming 
reduction in the defense order, unconsidered conversion, and 
diversification, has been brought to a critical state. Many 
enterprises have come to a halt, others are on the verge of 
stoppage. Every third designer, engineer, and worker has left 
the military-industrial complex. But despite that in the budget 
for 1994 it is planned approximately to halve appropriations for 
defense. And it is planned to reduce appropriations for 
research and development 130 percent and appropriations for 
purchases of weapons and military equipment 450 percent. What 
threat does this entail for the army, design bureaus, scientific 
research institutes, plants, and Russia as a whole? That was 
the question which began our correspondent's talk with Colonel 
General Anatoliy Sitnov, chief of armaments of the Russian 
Federation Armed Forces. 
  [Sitnov] If the defense budget is approved in precisely this 
form the Defense Ministry will be obliged, having paid its debts 
for 1993 and for deliveries which have already been made in 
1994, to release the remaining appropriations to ensure nuclear 
safety and the safety of the Navy's ships and vessels undergoing 
construction and repair and nearly ready for delivery and to 
finance work on guarantee supervision and the solution of 
priority tasks in the operation of armaments and military 
equipment. 
  Contracts for the delivery of the remainder (over 80 
percent) 
of the arms and military equipment envisaged by the state order 
will have to be dissolved. But the Russian Federation 
Government must make an official decision on the complete repeal 
of the state order for 1994. 
  It is obvious that all this will entail catastrophic 
consequences. The development and production of arms and 
military equipment will be halted and all scientific and 
technical programs of a defense nature will be curtailed at over 
3,000 industrial enterprises and organizations and over 4 
million people will be left without work. 
  In addition it will be necessary to channel additional funds 
(about 6,000 billion rubles [R]) from the state budget to 
maintain the fixed capital of enterprises (heating, water, 
electricity, security, and so forth) and to pay unemployment 
benefits. 
  [Rudenko] What are the armed forces' real requirements today 
for new combat equipment and weapons systems and to what degree 
are they being met by industry? 
  [Sitnov] To meet the armed forces' required level of combat 
readiness and capability by the year 2006 the provision of 
weapons and military equipment should be 80-100 percent. These 
indicators can be achieved on condition that average annual 
volumes of deliveries are increased 50-100 percent compared with 
existing ones. 
  Here the proportion of modern models will be less than 50 
percent. To achieve a level of 60 percent modern models for all 
main types of weapons as is the case in the Western countries' 
armed forces, we must increase average annual deliveries three 
to five times. 
  Realizing that under the conditions of restricted financing 
this is unlikely, the Defense Ministry's main efforts are aimed 
today at ensuring priorities in the development of arms and 
military equipment, modernizing existing arms, expanding their 
standardization among the branches of the armed forces, and 
reducing their range, increasing the reliability and quality of 
repair and technical servicing with a view to extending 
operational life. 
  [Rudenko] Which avenues for the development of arms and 
military equipment are regarded as the priority ones and how are 
they being financed? 
  [Sitnov] We rate as priorities in the armed forces' 
armaments system the strategic forces and facilities, 
intelligence and communications facilities, automated control 
systems, the improvement of the efficiency of various classes of 
conventional arms, means for the serviceman's combat and 
technical equipping meeting the requirements of modern combat, 
and the preparation of the necessary scientific and technical 
groundwork for key elements of promising models of weapons. 
  Right now a special "list of models of arms and military 
equipment whose production must be retained in any economic 
situation" has been drawn up. Thus in 1993 about 80 percent of 
appropriations envisaged for research and development was spent 
on financing priority work. This year, in connection with the 
uncertain nature of volumes of financing for the state defense 
order, it is planned to earmark 60-70 percent of appropriations 
for these purposes. 
  [Rudenko] A recent Defense Ministry conference showed arms 
purchases graphs. They virtually all showed a downward curve. 
Where is the critical level below which there is catastrophe? 
  [Sitnov] However painful it is to say this, already the 
production of a number of types of arms and military equipment 
is below the minimum permissible level. We regard as critical 
the level below which the disintegration of manufacturing 
processes and production cooperation begins. 
  In 1992-1993 arms production volumes were reduced by a 
factor 
of seven to eight. Therefore the Defense Ministry, the State 
Committee for the Defense Industry, and the Ministry of the 
Economy elaborated the state order for 1994, which basically 
makes it possible to preserve the defense potential in the 
country's interests. But its execution is now under threat of 
disruption. Insufficient volumes of financing have in practice 
already led to the nonfulfillment of the plan for the first half 
of the year. 
  [Rudenko] Is the advance funding of the state defense order 
being carried out, as prescribed by the relevant edict of the 
Russian president? 
  [Sitnov] Ensuring advance funding for work on the 
development and production of output (commodities, operations, 
services) within the limits of up to 20 percent of the annual 
volume of budget appropriations for the purchase of arms, 
military equipment, and scientific and technical output for 
military purposes is something that we are not yet able to do. 
As of 1 April this year, for instance, only 4 percent of the 
required volume of funds had been earmarked for advance funding 
of the defense order. 
  As for research and development, there is virtually no 
advance financing. All income funds (about 5 percent of those 
requested) go to cover expenses on work which has already been 
carried out or is being carried out. 
  [Rudenko] Many leaders of defense firms complain not so much 
of the lack of the defense order as of the lack of certainty. 
There is the long-standing question of hiving off so-called 
public plants which would make up the nucleus of the defense 
complex and have a guaranteed state order. Has the list of 
these plants been approved? 
  [Sitnov] Such a list has been compiled. It is now being 
coordinated in the ministries and departments concerned. But 
even if a decision is made at government level to transform 
these enterprises and organizations into public ones, the 
question remains of the smooth financing, in the necessary 
volumes, of the state defense order which they are fulfilling. 
  [Rudenko] What measures should be taken to stabilize the 
state of affairs in the defense complex and to fulfill the state 
defense order for 1994? 
  [Sitnov] Above all it is essential really to implement the 
guaranteed budget financing (the even receipt of money over the 
year with the funds' prompt and full indexing with inflation) 
and material and technical provision of the state defense order. 
The Russian Federation Defense Ministry must be allocated 
appropriations for advance payment of those who carry out the 
work. All benefits connected with the fulfillment of work on 
the products list of the state defense order must be extended to 
the fulfillment of work on the products list of the Russian 
Federation Defense Ministry's direct order. 
  Banks of any form of ownership must be set a three-day 
deadline for forwarding Defense Ministry payments to those who 
have carried out the work and fines must be introduced for 
violating this deadline. Special accounts must be opened for 
those who carry out the work into which advances and current 
payments from the Russian Federation Defense Ministry would be 
paid. Money from these accounts should be used only for 
expenses connected with the fulfillment of the state defense 
order. The creation of a standard legal base for planning and 
implementing the state defense order must be completed. 
  We realize that in the present economic and financial 
situation it is difficult to fulfill all these conditions. But 
it must be done. Otherwise Russia will not simply large behind 
the leading Western countries but will lose the ability to 
produce modern arms and military equipment systems.

  [Text] The command of the Russian launch facility of 
Plesetsk has admitted that rocket launching causes damage to 
nature but has deemed the financial claims excessive. The 
Archangel Oblast Environment Protection Committee is suing the 
cosmodrome for 1.2 billion rubles over the detachable stages of 
launch vehicles that have been falling down for many years near 
the coastal village of Koyda carrying remains of fuel. 
  The case was examined by the arbitration court, which agreed 
with the arguments of representatives of the space industry that 
the amount of economic damage suffered by the territory should 
be calculated more thoroughly. It has been decided to have an 
independent inquiry.

<F P=106> [Video report by Aleksandr Onosovskiy; from the "Novosti" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] The Vympel design bureau is one of the oldest 
research centers of the Russian defense industry. It designs 
missiles of all ranges for combat aircraft. In this type of 
armament Russia still maintains its superiority -- to a large 
extent thanks to Vympel. For example, not even the U.S. Army has 
a reverse start missile like our R-73E [AA-11 `Archer' class], 
which is designed for close-range dogfights. The air-to-air 
AAM-AE missile [AA-X-12] is equal in quality to its U.S. 
counterpart, [AIM-120 A] AMRAAM, while costing only half as 
much. There are missiles capable of hitting targets at a range 
of hundreds of miles. The list can go on and on. 
  But like most defense industry enterprises, Vympel finds it 
hard to work now. Because of a shortage of funds, it is 
continually forced to reduce long-term research, which gives an 
impetus to the creation of new types of armament. Yet the 
acclaimed design bureau still manages to maintain its 
reputation. The newest missile system was tested recently on 
the MiG-31M [`Foxhound-B'] aircraft. The Russian president 
himself congratulated the work force on the success of the 
experiment. Now Vympel cherishes justifiable hopes for serious 
support.

<F P=106> ["Own information" report: "`Myasishchev-Avia' Will Become </F>
Financial-Industrial Group"] 
  [Text] Right now in connection with the obviously 
inadequate nature of the State Defense Order and the lack of 
budget financing in the aviation industry a situation has taken 
shape which is fraught with the danger of a drastic reduction in 
and even the complete stoppage of the development and production 
of promising types of aircraft, the loss of skilled design and 
production personnel, and, as a result, the loss of Russia's 
preeminence in this field. 
  The Russian Federation Defense Ministry leadership and 
leading aviation firms are examining the most diverse ways out 
of the situation which has taken shape. One way could be the 
attraction of nonbudget funds to finance promising scientific 
research and experimental design developments, authorized by the 
government's 9 March 1994 decree. To this end the experimental 
machine building plant named for Myasishchev, the specialized 
"Russkoye oruzhiye" corporation, the Smolensk aircraft plant, 
and the "Aviainvest" joint stock company have concluded an 
agreement on cooperation and joint activity and the creation of 
a new corporate body -- the "Myasishchev-Avia' closed-type 
joint-stock company. 
  The main aims of the "Myasishchev-Avia" joint-stock company 
will be the development, production, sale, and servicing, both 
on the domestic and the foreign market, of promising 
developments of the Myasishchev experimental machine building 
plant. It is a case of the "Geofizika" high-altitude aircraft 
designed for optical and radar monitoring of the earth's surface 
and the monitoring of the environment's ecological situation, 
the "Gzhel" light multipurpose freight and passenger aircraft 
(up to 500 kg of payload or up to six passengers), the joint 
Russian-Indian project for the "Duet" passenger liner for 
medium-distance routes, the M-112 freight and passenger 
aircraft, and other programs. 
  The joint-stock company which is being created is viewed as 
the prototype for a financial-industrial group in the field of 
planning, producing, and selling aircraft including on the 
foreign market. Using both state and nonbudget funds. 
  In implementing this project the Myasishchev experimental 
machine building plant will monitor the development of promising 
competitive models of aircraft, the "Russkoye oruzhiye" 
specialized corporation will monitor the development of the 
financial strategy for the development of the "Myasishchev-Avia" 
joint-stock company, the attraction of nonbudget funds, and 
marketing, the Smolensk aircraft plant will monitor the 
production of experimental models of aircraft developed under 
the leadership of the "Myasishchev-Avia" joint-stock company and 
their subsequent series production, and the "Aviainvest" 
joint-stock company will monitor collaboration with the air 
force and quality control through the institute of military 
representatives.

<F P=106> [Text of `exclusive' with Russian President Boris Yeltsin by </F>
correspondent Franz-Olivier Giesbert for LE FIGARO and Europe 
No. 1; Yeltsin speaks in Russian with simultaneous translation 
into French; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Giesbert] Good morning, Mr. Yeltsin. With the 
Bosnian business Russia is back in force on the international 
scene, and you are publishing with Albin Michel [publishing 
house] a very interesting book, full of revelations, entitled 
"On the Razor's Edge," where you write about the recent failed 
coups. So that is at least two reasons -- there are plenty of 
others -- for inviting you to speak to us this morning. 
  Moscow is a living city again: Everywhere you can see new 
shops, but the economic situation is still very worrying. What 
do you want to say to the West this morning in order to get real 
help? 
  [Yeltsin] I don't want to persuade people any more. Look at 
the results. I have spent more than two years trying to 
persuade them -- nearly three. Unfortunately, I haven't gotten 
much from this. I am not going to try to persuade anyone 
anymore. Let the world and the Western countries, and their 
leaders understand for themselves that the situation in Russia 
influences the situation in the world as a whole, and whether it 
deteriorates. In general, we can carry out all our reforms by 
our own efforts. 
  [Giesbert] Don't you feel basically, that the West has cast 
you off? 
  [Yeltsin] It isn't so easy to cast me off. I will fight. 
Perhaps I will cast off my opponent, my rival. As for fate, the 
fate of Russia is set, and Russia will not turn away from the 
path it is following. Will there be aid from the West or won't 
there be? What we are talking about is this: We have to 
eliminate two-thirds of the strategic nuclear missiles as soon 
as possible, and to do this we need huge sums of money. Of 
course we don't have the money. If the West wants us not to have 
these missiles, then support us; if you refuse, if you want to 
live continuously in fear of these missiles, keep your money! 
  [Giesbert] So you are saying that if we don't help you, 
there 
is likely to be chaos? 
  [Yeltsin] No. You have understood it the wrong way round. 
Even if the West does not help us, Russia will follow its path 
of renewal and democracy based on a market economy, and respect 
for human rights at an international level. 
  [Giesbert] In your opinion, is Helmut Kohl the statesman who 
has best understood Russia today? 
  [Yeltsin] I have great respect for Bill Clinton, but he 
simply has not yet had enough time to study Russia in a serious 
way. 
  Helmut Kohl, simply by virtue of seniority as chancellor, 
has 
had a real chance to get a good knowledge of the former Soviet 
Union and Russia. There is no such international scale to say 
one is better than another. 
  [Geisbert] When we read your book, "On the Razor's Edge," it 
is clear that democracy is still fragile in Russia. Do you 
think there is still a danger of a coup? You have spoken 
optimistically, but anyone reading your book has the impression 
that things came very close to disaster. 
  [Yeltsin] Well, of course, these two coups were an attempt 
to 
divert us from the path of democracy. But now I cannot see any 
serious forces which might hinder us on our path. 
  Of course, as in any other country, there are communists, 
reds, and so on, who have their own program, who hinder us in a 
way. For example, we have signed a document on public accord, 
and of the 248 organizations -- parties, existing structures, 
movements, and social organizations -- which took part, 245 
signed [the document]. The communists didn't sign. 
  I am just sorry, and sorry for them, that they are the ones 
losing out, because they keep saying: We are for the people. 
But they did not sign the document on accord in Russia, to 
ensure that there should not be a civil war. 
  [Giesbert] You have not talked about Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, 
the abominable Zhirinovskiy. Isn't he a threat? 
  [Yeltsin] No. 
  [Giesbert] Are the Russians too intelligent to return to 
demagogy? 
  [Yeltsin] Our people suffered more than anyone else from 
fascism in the war against fascist Germany. We lost 20 million 
people in it. 
  [Geibert] A personal question, Mr. Yeltsin. When we read 
your book, we have the impression of a strong man, decisive and 
determined, but who is also able to question himself. Why do 
you disappear from time to time as you do? 
  [Yeltsin] No, I am in good health. I am not ill. I do not 
miss work for health reasons, but there are important questions, 
important problems, documents that have to be worked on. For 
example, the treaty on public accord. It needed very special 
preparation. I took leave for 12 days, part of my annual leave, 
that I certainly have a right to take. I never use all of my 
annual leave. But in spring I take 12 days or so, and 12 or so 
days in the fall. Usually I use these vacation times to prepare 
important initiatives of work on some problem or other. I don't 
disappear anywhere, and I don't go away. 
  [Geisbert] What are the main mistakes made by the West in 
the 
problem of former Yugoslavia? 
  [Yeltsin] Of course, if we had united at the very beginning, 
if we had worked out a common viewpoint and approach as to how 
to put an end to this situation, we would have settled this 
situation much faster in a peaceful way. That is the most 
important thing. 
  We all, we and the United States, and the United Nations and 
Europe, we were all too late. Once the fire had been kindled, 
it was much more difficult to put it out. 
  [Giesbert] Today, the historic responsibility lies with 
you, because it depends on you. 
  [Yeltsin] You mean Yugoslavia? 
  [Giesbert] Yes. You are the arbiter. Because you are [word 
indistinct] led, because you are the only ones who can still 
talk to the Serbs. 
  [Yeltsin] Well, yes, but there are not only the Serbs there. 
There are the Muslims and the Croats and other peoples. And 
then, we have gotten rid of our imperialist ambitions. We could 
not put pressure on them with our full weight, but with all of 
us together we could arrive at an agreement. 
  [Giesbert] Basically, you see the fault as lying with the 
Serbs today? 
  [Yeltsin] No, with all of those involved. 
  [Geisbert] Mr. Yeltsin, let me recall the title of your 
book, 
published by Albin Michel: "On the Razor's Edge." What are you 
going to do now? Play tennis? 
  [Yeltsin] I play on Tuesdays and Saturdays. 
  [Giesbert] Are you going to take a freezing cold bath today? 
  [Yeltsin] Yes, indeed. I do that every day. 
  [Giesbert] Thank you, Mr. Yeltsin. Have a good bath and a 
good day.

<F P=106> [Article by Konstantin Eggert: "Defeat in Bosnia Unites </F>
Russia and West"] 
  [Text] Geneva-Bonn-Moscow -- For a long time to come 
Russian diplomacy will be branded "pro-Serb," although, judging 
from the results of the Russian foreign minister's talks with 
his U.S., French, and FRG counterparts, there are fewer grounds 
for this than before. 
  The peaks and troughs of the last few months seem to have 
had 
a sobering effect on both Russia and the West. The Kremlin has 
been shamefully humiliated by the Serbs, while Europe and the 
United States have shown themselves to be confused and 
ineffectual in their use of military force. The spirit of 
defeat has closed the gap between Moscow and the Western 
capitals, compelling them on the one hand to engage in what one 
might call "mutual face saving" and on the other to try a 
general onslaught to get the Bosnian problem moving. 
  Andrey Kozyrev's trip to Geneva and Bonn was undertaken 
straight after Russia submitted its initiative for the creation 
of a so-called "contact group" involving representatives of 
Russia, the United States, the European Union, and the United 
Nations. Its task is to get the Serbs and Muslims to sign an 
agreement suspending hostilities forthwith and then work toward 
a Bosnia-wide agreement on the principles for a settlement. 
  By the minister's own admission, when he went to Switzerland 
he did not expect his Western partners to agree so quickly to 
Russia's idea of stepping up the quest for a political solution 
to the crisis in Bosnia. In this respect the meeting with U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher was of particular 
importance. Their positions have moved appreciably closer: 
Moscow is no longer saying that air strikes are categorically 
inadmissible, and moreover it acknowledges that they are 
advisable when the civilian population is under threat. 
Washington in turn agreed on the need to direct attention 
primarily to diplomatic means of influencing the parties to the 
conflict. 
  The meeting with Alain Juppe, head of the French Foreign 
Ministry, was even more upbeat than the talks with Christopher, 
which is easily explained: Russia's views were previously 
extremely close to the Europeans' viewpoint. On leaving the 
Russian mission in Geneva, where he spoke with Kozyrev, the 
French minister said: "The contact group will not only tackle 
Bosnia." 
  The work of the contact group began with a minor sensation. 
It was announced that Aleksey Nikiforov, first deputy director 
of the Foreign Ministry's First European Department, would go to 
Sarajevo and Pale, the Bosnian Serb capital, instead of Vitaliy 
Churkin, the Russian president's special representative. Agency 
and newspaper reports immediately appeared saying that Churkin 
had resigned. Talking to journalists in the aircraft en route 
for Bonn, Vitaliy Ivanovich joked: "The press was in a hurry to 
deprive me of a job." Following Kozyrev's talks with German 
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel Churkin flew off to Oslo to meet 
with Thorvald Stoltenberg, the UN secretary general's 
representative. Aleksey Nikiforovich's visit to Bosnia is quite 
justified: After Churkin's very harsh words about the leaders 
of the Bosnian Serbs two weeks ago, describing them as people 
"seized by the madness of war," his meeting with Radovan 
Karadzic would hardly be productive. Churkin is not opposed to 
passing on his work in Yugoslavia to someone else, however, 
according to an informed Russian diplomat, "only the president 
has the right to relieve him of this post. Yeltsin may do that 
tomorrow, but he may also do it in a year's time." 
  If the contact group's work goes successfully, the foreign 
ministers of Russia, the United States, France, Britain, and 
Germany may meet next week in Geneva or one of the Scandinavian 
capitals. According to Kozyrev, it is quite possible that an 
interim agreement would be concluded following the general 
suspension of hostilities in Bosnia, an agreement recording 
primarily the territorial disagreements between the communities. 
After that they would be able to argue for a year, but over a 
map, not in the trenches. At the end of the interim period the 
remaining unresolved questions could be handed over to 
international arbitration.

"Andrey Vladimirovich, Are You Pro-Serb?"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- Andrey Kozyrev and his German colleague 
Klaus Kinkel know each other well and can get down to business 
without any preliminaries. That is why Kozyrev managed to pack 
a lot into the three hours he was on German soil. He and his 
team traveled by military helicopter to Bonn's "Petersberg" 
residence for honored guests, he had a conversation with Kinkel, 
he had a bite to eat, and he appeared before journalists. 
  The agenda included: putting the final touches to the 
program for Boris Yeltsin's upcoming visit to the FRG; an 
exchange of opinions on the progress of the elections in the 
Republic of South Africa; discussion of the situation in the 
Near East; and problems of bilateral relations. But the key 
question was Bosnia and, in particular, President Yeltsin's 
proposal to hold an international meeting on settling the 
conflict with Russia, the United States, the EU [European 
Union], and NATO participating. In the minister's opinion, it 
should specifically result in a consolidated approach to this 
problem from the world community. Russian diplomacy's main 
thesis is that there must be no reliance purely on a military 
solution involving force and that it is essential to try to make 
full use of all peaceful methods to extinguish the conflagration 
of war in the Balkans. A meeting of foreign ministers of the 
states and political organizations invited by Boris Nikolayevich 
to the conversation on Bosnia is due to be held in the near 
future in order to reach final agreement on disputed points. 
  The world community's next task is to insist on a cease-fire 
in Bosnia and to start working out the conditions for and 
principles of a comprehensive peace settlement. And, as 
progress is made toward the set aim, the vise of economic 
sanctions against Yugoslavia must be gradually loosened. 
  "Do you represent the Serbs' interests?" a German journalist 
asked. 
  "No, I represent Russia," Andrey Vladimirovich replied.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Denis Perkin] </F>
  [Excerpts] Moscow, 3 May -- The forthcoming signing of the 
"Gaza-Jericho-First" agreement between the PLO and Israel will 
open a new, no less complex stage connected with the 
implementation of the agreements which have been reached, 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev stated today before his 
departure for Cairo where he is to take part in the ceremony at 
which that historic document will be signed. [passage omitted] 
  In the opinion of the Russian minister, questions on the 
practical transition to a peaceful life, on setting up economic 
ties, and guaranteeing security are of exceptional importance 
for the whole region. It is gratifying that Russia also has 
made its contribution to the achievement of progress along this 
path. In particular, "it is generally acknowledged" that the 
recent visits to Moscow by the PLO and Israeli delegations, the 
meetings which Yasir 'Arafat and Yitzhaq Rabin had with Boris 
Yeltsin "gave a good boost to the work being carried out," 
A.Kozyrev noted. 
  He also voiced satisfaction with the constructive 
cooperation 
which is under way with the U.S. side. "We are are in daily 
contact, we are acting in unison, in complete accord," the 
minister stressed. 
  A. Kozyrev expressed confidence that the present first step 
in the Near East peace process should be accompanied by the 
search for mutually acceptable solutions with regard to all 
Palestinian territories and by progress in other areas of the 
talks. The minister believes that it is necessary, first and 
foremost, to attain progress in the Israel-Syrian area of the 
talks, as the most difficult one. In his words, Russia has an 
opportunity to play an active mediatory role. 
  Touching upon Russia's idea of convening the second Madrid 
conference on the Near East, A. Kozyrev noted that it aimed to 
open new "political-diplomatic" prospects and that it is still 
topical, of course. "I think," he continued, "that this idea 
will receive a wider recognition since a certain stage in the 
current process is now coming to completion." It is necessary 
to assess the path which has been traveled and to specifically 
outline future areas of the talks to capitalize on the 
achievements of the first Madrid conference. 
  In the opinion of the Russian minister, the present peace 
process could become a model for resolving many "chronic 
conflicts fraught with bloodshed and intolerance." This applies 
in particular, he noted, to the Karabakh conflict. A.Kozyrev 
voiced the hope that the warring sides will be able to reach 
agreement on a cease-fire and to "enter an agreement drawn up 
with Russian mediation." 
  The head of the foreign policy department of the Russian 
Federation noted that the Interparliamentary Assembly of CIS 
states could make a weighty contribution to resolving this 
problem. "We will also strive to step up cooperation in this 
direction in the CSCE," he said. 
  The minister also said that he intended to meet soon with 
Jan 
Eliasson, chairman of the CSCE peace conference on 
Nagorno-Karabakh.

  [Text] The Russian foreign policy-makers are attentively 
observing the situation in the Persian Gulf. Moscow wants to 
contribute to a settlement of the conflict there as well as in 
any other region of the world and seeks stability and friendly 
relations established in the region. Moscow considers this to 
be in its direct state interests, a Russian expert on this 
region's problems told INTERFAX in an interview. 
  He suggested that the Russian position on elimination of the 
consequences of the Iraqi-Kuwait conflict proceeded from the 
priority of international law. "This means that Baghdad must 
strictly observe and implement all the decisions made by the 
world community. The UN Security Council in its turn must 
adequately response to all positive moves by Iraq," he added. 
  The expert pointed out that three years after the armed 
conflict Iraq had done much for implementation of the decisions 
made by the UN Security Council, primarily in the sphere of 
disarmament. 
  The expert said this had caused the Russian representative 
to 
the UN Security Council to propose at its last session that the 
"work" with Iraq proceed to the next stage providing for 
international control over the Iraqi military programs. 
  "Moscow, Paris, Beijing and several nonpermanent members of 
the UN Security Council believe that such specific measures 
would encourage Baghdad for further cooperation with the Special 
Commission," the expert suggested. 
  He said Moscow was afraid that a continuing indefinite 
position on lifting the sanctions and utilization of pressure 
and threats in dialogue with Iraq might bring results opposite 
to expectations, such as confrontation with the UN and a closed 
defense policy.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Lutskiy video report from Yugoslavia; from the </F>
"Utro" program] 
  [Text] Spring is in full bloom in Croatia. Unfortunately, 
the smell of blooming trees in once picturesque towns and 
villages that have found themselves in a combat zone contrasts 
sharply with the almost apocalyptic horror of devastation. 
Blood brothers, Serbs and Croats, look at what you have done. 
Ruins, ruins, and ruins again. 
  and this is a roadblock of the UN peace keeping force, UNHCR 
[as heard] for short. It controls a part of the territory 
between the self proclaimed republic of Serbia and Croatia. Had 
it not been for the blue helmets, the smoldering fire of war 
would have blazed here with renewed strength. 
  A UN command post snuggled near a demolished church in the 
small town of (Pakrac), formerly a resort. The chief is 
Canadian. When asked whether it was dangerous here he said that 
while today the situation was relatively relaxed, a month ago it 
was very dangerous. 
  Intense fighting took place at the local cemetery as well. 
Even the dead have no peace from the living, many of whom found 
their final resting place here. 
  While touring the roads of former Yugoslavia, we managed to 
meet fighters of the Russian battalion, which serves under the 
UN aegis. There were 1,200 in the beginning, then a third was 
sent to Bosnia, to the long-suffering town of Sarajevo. These 
lads serve at the so-called checkpoints. 
  [Begin recording][Lutskiy] Do shootings occur often? 
  [Bessmertnykh] There are battles every day. 
  [Kobzev] Our battalion lost two men this year, and 17 
sustained injuries of varying extent. As to the situation, it 
is difficult to say how an immediate peace can be established 
here. There can be no talk about establishing immediate peace 
here. [end recording] 
  The deputy battalion commander's opinion was also confirmed 
at the Russian Embassy in Croatia. 
  [Begin Kerestedzhiyants recording] I want to emphasize that 
there is no side where you can plant both feet and say: This is 
just. [Points to a wall map of former Yugoslavia, with color 
coded division of forces displayed] The Serbs have no right to 
clean out Gorazde, which is home for 60,000 Muslims. These 
people have nowhere to go. The Muslims here also have no right 
to attack the Serbs because they are under UN protection and 
have been declared to be in a security zone. And a security 
zone implies lack of danger from within the zone first and 
foremost. General tension and readiness to continue is fairly 
high on all three sides. No one here is satisfied with the way 
things have been solved so far. [end recording] 
  Politicians and servicemen are unsatisfied, but what about 
the common people, who are forced to abandon their homes and who 
find themselves in refugee camps? According to estimates of 
representatives of the UN high commissioner for refugees, who 
take care of the problems of dispossessed people -- housing, 
feeding and providing medical services for them -- more than 4 
million people in the former Yugoslavia are in need of such 
services. However, even here in the camps life goes on, 
children feel at home here and play merrily, old people talk 
about their own affairs, and everyone is making plans for the 
future. 
  This is Aleksandr Lutskiy reporting from Croatia for the 
"Utro" program.

  [(Text] An advisor of the Russian prime-minister Mikhail 
Tarasov has told INTERFAX that this year Viktor Chernomyrdin is 
to intensively travel abroad. Still visits to Russian regions 
and republics to see the situation and problems remain his 
priority. 
  Tarasov said that in mid-May the head of the cabinet is 
expected to make a one-day visit to Warsaw to resolve old 
problems blocking bilateral economic cooperation, in particular 
mutual settlements and the foreign debt of the former Soviet 
Union. 
  A visit to China is planned for the end of May. There 
Chernomyrdin should sign an impressive package of agreements, 
including documents on the demarcation of the border, shipping 
on the Amur river and in international waters, cooperation in 
agriculture and related industries as well as in environmental 
protection. 
  In June the prime-minister is expected to take part in the 
third session of the Gore-Chernomyrdin commission in the USA. 
In the framework of the commission six mixed committees have 
planned joint energy, space and nuclear power engineering 
projects. 
  In the second half of July, according to Tarasov, the 
Russian 
head of government is expected to tour Saudi Arabia, the United 
Arab Emirates and Kuwait. There attention will be centered 
around military-technical cooperation, the attraction of foreign 
investments and cooperation in fuel and power engineering. 
  The Russian Prime-Minister has been invited to visit the 
Czech republic and Slovakia as well as Bulgaria and Rumania. 
  At the end of the year he is expected to go to London. 
  During the next few months in Moscow Chernomyrdin is to hold 
talks with his counterparts from Austria, Vietnam, Mongolia, 
Denmark and other foreign countries.

<F P=106> [Report by Igor Andreyev: "Foreign Ministry Intends To More </F>
Actively Protect Rights of Russians Abroad"] 
  [Text] Boris Pastukhov, Russian Federation deputy foreign 
minister, has called on Russian diplomats to move resolutely 
toward Russian consular institutions in the CIS and Baltic 
countries. Summing up the results of a two-day conference of 
Russian consuls in the near abroad, the deputy minister even 
promised to cancel "far abroad" trips for Foreign Ministry 
staffers if they failed to work properly at consular level in 
the former Soviet republics. 
  Cases of illegality in respect of the Russian-speaking 
population in many countries of the near abroad are common 
knowledge, and the consular apparatus in some of them is still 
modest. In Latvia alone, Russian diplomats issued 23,000 visas 
last year. Consular officials in Estonia processed 18,000 
permits to visit Russia. And, although in some places this 
embassy activity brings in considerable revenue -- the visas 
issued by the diplomatic mission in Riga cost a total of 
$380,000 -- numerous restrictions prevent even part of the 
proceeds from being used for the apparatus' needs. 
  As of 28 April Lithuania has followed the other two Baltic 
states in introducing visas for Russians. Rules are rules, but 
even the strictest regulations should not exclude a humane 
approach in relations between countries in individual, dramatic 
circumstances. The deputy minister said that the episode of the 
burial of a Russian inhabitant of Estonia, which relatives from 
Russia were not allowed to attend, was a situation that demeaned 
great Russia and Russians wherever they may live. These people 
did not have foreign passports and, however quickly preparations 
were made abroad, the Estonian authorities refused to stamp a 
visa on their internal documents. As a result, the relatives 
bade farewell to the deceased at the border bridge in Narva, and 
the coffin was sent back for burial on Estonian soil. 
  Condemning the position of the authorities in a number of 
CIS 
countries vis-a-vis the Russian-speaking population, Boris 
Pastukhov called on consular workers to be tougher, more 
vigorous, and "fiercer" [zleye] in defending the rights of 
ethnic Russians in the near abroad.

  [Text] The last round of the Russian-Estonian talks ended 
practically without result, according to Reinart, head of the 
Estonian delegation. Russia has taken the date for completing 
troops withdrawal -- 31 August 1994 -- out of the draft 
agreement, but has not proposed any other date for discussion. 
According to Svirin, head of the Russian delegation, in 
discussions on the sea borders during the talks, disagreements 
were revealed concerning the point where they should be linked 
up with the border on land. Estonia insisted on the 1920 
borders, whereas Russia is for setting the border line from the 
place where the present land border comes down to the Baltic Sea. 
  According to INTERFAX, the next round of talks will be held 
in Tallinn tomorrow.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>
  [Text] Sochi 2 May TASS -- "America, as well as Russia, has 
not developed as yet a policy toward each other," said on Monday 
[2 May] member of the Russian Academy of Sciences Aleksandr 
Yakovlev who participates in the Russian-American forum "Aspen 
dialogue" which opened in Sochi today. 
  This international conference is attended by U.S. senators 
and congressmen, Russian legislators, politicians, top 
executives of enterprises and corporations from the two 
countries. 
  The present "Aspen dialogue" is the fifth in number. It was 
held in the city of Aspen, Colorado State, for the first time in 
August 1991 by the international association of industrial 
managers headed by Konsantin Zatulin (now chairman of the lower 
house committee on the Commonwealth of Independent States) and 
the U.S. international centre of civil administration headed by 
B. Sivella. 
  In the opinion of forum participants, it is being held now 
in 
the conditions when recent romanticism of Russian-American 
relations is passing into oblivion. 
  Andranik Migranyan, member of the presidential council and 
chief expert of the lower house committee on the CIS, noted that 
"on withdrawing from the Soviet Union, Russia has not found its 
bearings with its national and state interests as well as aims. 
  ``The Russian foreign policy at the first stage was the 
continuation of the old Soviet and was aimed at responding to 
initiatives of Western countries. 
  ``This policy created false impression about Russia as a 
country which had no specific national and state interests and 
seeks to join `the big seven' and to pursue the same policy.'' 
  "We now witness the painful formation of Russian foreign 
policy," Migranyan noted. 
  This transition will be also promoted by the representative 
Russian-American forum "Aspen dialogue," which will work for 
five days.

  [Text] The head of the upper house of the Russian 
parliament said the meeting between the heads of parliament of 
Armenia and Azerbaijan, due to take place in the Kyrgyzstan 
capital Bishkek on 3-6 May, offered a chance to resolve the 
issue of Azerbaijan's disputed Armenian-speaking enclave of 
Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  Vladimir Shumeyko, who arrived in Bishkek on Monday and the 
same day signed an interparliamentary agreement with the head of 
Kyrgyzstan's legislature, Meditkan Sherimkulov, said Azerbaijan 
had recently stated readiness to recognize Nagorno-Karabakh as 
"one of the parties to the conflict." This is a "major step 
forward" in the negotiation process, Shumeyko said. 
  He said a peace mission of the Interparliamentary Assembly 
of 
the Commonwealth of Independent States "has done a good deal" to 
achieve peace in the embattled enclave. "We will be working as 
much as necessary for the settlement of the conflict in 
Nagorno-Karabakh," he said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Azerbaijani Parliament Speaker Rasul Guliyev </F>
by Aydyn Mekhtiyev; place and date not given: "`Azerbaijan Will 
Not Be a Federal State.' Parliament Chairman Rasul Guliyev 
Hopes for Moscow's Mediation in Resolving Karabakh Problem"] 
  [Text] [Mekhtiyev] Mr. Guliyev, during the official visit 
to Moscow by your parliamentary delegation an "Agreement on 
Interparliamentary Cooperation Between the Russian Federation 
[RF] Federal Assembly and the Azerbaijani National Assembly" was 
signed. How do you assess the prospects for cooperation between 
the parliaments of Azerbaijan and the RF? 
  [Guliyev] We attach very great importance to relations with 
the RF since we think that the RF, as the rightful heir of the 
former USSR, plays a tremendous role in both the region and the 
world as a whole. We regard the document we have signed as a 
very important step toward developing partnership relations. We 
agreed to regularly exchange information regarding the two 
countries' current legislative activity and also to help 
synchronize ratification processes in respect of agreements 
concluded between the two countries. 
  [Mekhtiyev] It is known that during your delegation's talks 
with the RF leadership discussion of the Karabakh problem was 
one of the main topics. Did you succeed in reaching agreement 
in your approaches to resolving this problem? 
  [Guliyev] Both sides were unanimous that it is pointless 
continuing the war. As a first step it is necessary to ensure a 
cease-fire in the region, then start pulling back the troops a 
certain distance, and lastly completely withdraw Armenian troops 
from the occupied territories. We think that these phases 
should be completed within 30-40 days. Once all of the above 
terms have been met discussion of the political status of 
Nagorno-Karabakh can begin. 
  [Mekhtiyev] RF Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko 
said 28 April at the final press conference that it is necessary 
to acknowledge the existence of three warring parties while the 
conflict is being resolved, namely Azerbaijan, Armenia, and 
Nagorno-Karabakh. At the same time, official Baku is previously 
known to have repeatedly stated that the conflict is directly 
between Armenia and Azerbaijan.... 
  [Guliyev] We are not opposed to Armenian representatives of 
Nagorno-Karabakh taking part in the coming talks, but the 
Karabakh Armenians cannot speak on behalf of the whole 
population of Nagorno-Karabakh. The point is that until the 
conflict began in 1988 almost 25 percent of the population of 
this former autonomous oblast were Azerbaijanis. As you know, 
they were all expelled. There can hardly be talk about defining 
the status of this territory without taking their opinion into 
consideration even though they are in exile. Azerbaijan is not 
about to become a federal state. When the political status of 
Nagorno-Karabakh is discussed it is necessary to proceed on the 
basis of the CSCE Council of Ministers decision of 1992, which 
stresses that this territory is an inalienable part of 
Azerbaijan. 
  [Mekhtiyev] Do you not think that the CIS should defend the 
sovereign rights of Azerbaijan more vigorously? 
  [Guliyev] At the moment, the Commonwealth is not making full 
use of its potential for defending this organization's member 
countries against possible aggression, and during the meeting of 
the heads of state in Moscow 15 April the abnormality of the 
situation where two members of the CIS are fighting among 
themselves was pointed out. The Commonwealth could make 
vigorous efforts to establish peace in the region. That is why, 
after signing the Treaty on Collective Security, Azerbaijan 
proposed an amendment whereby members of the CIS should be 
protected not only from outside aggression, but also from 
aggression from neighboring CIS countries and from occupied 
territories. 
  [Mekhtiyev] During their summit in Moscow the CIS leaders 
advocated the continuation of Russia's peace efforts to resolve 
the conflict and urged the world community to back the Russian 
plan for a peace settlement. However, reports appeared in the 
press saying that the Azerbaijani leadership refuses to accept 
the Russian plan for a settlement of the problem... 
  [Guliyev] It is inaccurate to use the word "refuse." The 
Azerbaijani leadership made several remarks about the peace plan 
that was proposed for discussion early this year. An updated 
version of the peace plan for the settlement of the Karabakh 
problem has now been taken as a base with consideration for our 
remarks and suggestions. At our insistence the plan under 
consideration includes a point, which makes provision for the 
withdrawal of Armenian troops from the Azerbaijani cities of 
Lachin and Shusha. We are indeed insisting that specific 
timeframes be given for the withdrawal of the Armenian forces of 
occupation from these and other occupied areas. Another way in 
which this plan differs from its predecessor is the principle of 
both sides' troops being pulled back. The previous plan made 
provision for the symmetrical withdrawal of both warring 
parties' troops, that is it was not only the Armenian side, 
occupying 20 percent of our territory, that was to pull back 20 
km but also the Azerbaijani side; however, fulfillment of these 
terms would have jeopardized the safety of the civilian 
population in the abandoned areas. 
  We expressed doubts as to the advisability of a symmetrical 
troop withdrawal and our arguments were viewed with 
understanding by the Russian leadership. The previous draft did 
not give a precise indication of where the troops would be 
stationed following the withdrawal, thus enabling the Armenians 
to come up with their own interpretation of the accords reached. 
  [Mekhtiyev] Mr. Chairman, is the Russian plan not at 
variance with the CSCE Minsk Group's mediatory mission? Is one 
not conscious of a kind of rivalry between Russia and the CSCE 
in the peace efforts to resolve the Karabakh problem? 
  [Guliyev] I would venture to disagree with that assessment. 
The Minsk Group does not deny the role of Russia and the CIS in 
resolving the problem. There is plenty of scope here to 
coordinate the peace efforts made by Russia and the CSCE. I 
think that the presence of international observers in the 
conflict zone could play a positive role. They should monitor 
any breach of the accords by the sides.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: reports by </F>
diplomatic correspondents Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy and 
others] 
  [Text] The Ukrainian nationalists who put forward 
territorial claims to Russia and who speak about Kuban and "the 
north Slobozhanshina" (southern districts of the Kursk and 
Belgorod regions within the Russian Federation -- INTERFAX) as 
about truly Ukrainian territories "are playing with fire." A 
prominent Russian expert, who is in charge for the problems of 
the Russian-Ukrainian relations, that's why he preferred to stay 
anonymous, expressed this opinion in his interview with INTERFAX. 
  In his words, "those Ukrainian politicians who strive "to 
pull out" Russia out of Crimea and "to possess" the entire Black 
Sea Fleet demonstrate the same play with fire. Unfortunately, 
separate officials in Kiev also voice identical statements," he 
noted. 
  As the expert said, "Russia does not raise the issue on 
Crimea's return at the official level" "As one can say, what has 
been done, has been done. In 1954 during the celebration of the 
300th anniversary of Ukraine's and Russia's re-unification 
Nikita Khrushchev handed over Crimea to Ukraine with a stroke of 
the pen. Now it does not matter much that nobody asked the 
Crimeans about this. This wide gesture of the communist leader, 
who is often and, probably, justly called a precursor of one 
more reformatory, Mikhail Gorbachev, has not changed anything in 
the life of the peninsula or his citizens. The USSR has not 
only seemed, but it was a monolith in which the borders between 
its republics were of pure nominal and administrative nature," 
he pointed out. 
  The expert believes that after the collapse of the USSR 
"Yeltsin's team" had no choice but to recognize the territorial 
integrity of Ukraine within the former Ukrainian Soviet 
Socialist Republic. "As if we have lacked only a conflict 
between Russia and Ukraine,--he noted.--Meanwhile, the time 
places everything to the proper place. If the emissaries from 
Kiev and Lvov had not tried to dictate their provisions to the 
Crimeans, had not implemented an artificial Ukrainization, and 
agreed to the introduction of the institute of dual citizenship 
then the situation in the Russian- speaking and pro-Russian 
Crimea could have remained more or less calm. However, Kiev has 
made an opposite decision and even has not let the 
democratically elected Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov to the 
negotiations between Russian and Ukrainian Defense Ministers 
Pavel Grachev and Vitaliy Radetskyy who were held in Sevastopol, 
that is in Crimea." 
  According to the expert, such actions are able "to blow up" 
not only Crimea but to undermine Ukraine's territorial 
integrity. "It is not necessary to be a prophet in order to 
forecast the results of the possible referendum on Crimea's 
withdrawal from Ukraine and its unification with the Russian 
Federation. One can ban a referendum and recognize it 
non-constitutional. However, one should not forget that even 
the principles of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe which has fixed the unchangeability of the post-war 
borders, admits that such a referendum is quite possible under 
certain provisions. And where is the guarantee that the Donetsk 
basin and Ukraine's whole Left Bank region would not follow 
Crimea? It is difficult to predict any answer under the 
forthcoming economic collapse of the Ukrainian economy," 
stressed the expert. 
  He expressed his supposition that "these premises make 
Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk force postponement of the 
presidential elections scheduled for 26 June." "It's interesting 
to note that the most active critics representing Ukrainian 
nationalists support Kravchuk's position. Apparently they 
understand what they do in this case," he made a conclusion.

<F P=106> [Article by Ambassador at Large Yuriy Dubinin under the </F>
"Diplomacy" rubric: "Presidents' Accords Will Be Implemented, 
Yuriy Dubinin, Ambassador at Large and Head of Russian 
Delegation to Talks With Ukraine, Believes"] 
  [Text] The objectives, overall direction, and course of 
Russia's policy on Ukraine are determined in an entirely precise 
and clear manner: They emerged back at the summit meeting in 
Dagomys. This being the course of friendship, cooperation, and 
partnership. 
  In proceeding to implement these objectives it is of course 
necessary to work like a sculptor who has to turn contours hewn 
out of stone into a statue: All the surplus elements must be 
removed from Russian-Ukrainian relations -- everything that is 
impeding the development of friendship between the fraternal 
peoples. In other words, it remains to resolve a quite small 
number of problems that are in one way or another complicating 
our relations. 
  I would say more: Means of resolving these problems have 
already been outlined during summit-level meetings. In 
particular, this applies to everything pertaining to the Black 
Sea Fleet. It is merely necessary to find the key to 
implementing and carrying out the plans. This became 
particularly clear following the Russian and Ukrainian defense 
ministers' recent talks in Sevastopol. 
  Why were they not completely successful? In my view because 
the presidents' directives enshrined in the Moscow agreement of 
15 April were not fully carried out during these talks. To be 
utterly frank, they were only partially carried out with regard 
to the future of the Black Sea Fleet's ships. Russia has done 
as much as possible to accommodate Ukraine on this, and 
prospects for the implementation of the presidents' accords have 
actually emerged. 
  Regrettably, there has been no countermovement on the 
Ukrainian side as regards the first point of the agreement, to 
whit separate basing for the two republics' naval forces. We 
still have to work on reaching agreement on this. Nonetheless, 
I am still optimistic, and I am convinced that the peoples of 
Russia and Ukraine expect the talks to come to a conclusion in 
the very near future.

<F P=106> [Report by Viktor Litovkin: "U.S. Equipment Idle at Russian </F>
Missile Range"] 
  [Text] The racks visible in this photograph are on the 
third floor of the Russian Strategic Missile Forces' State Test 
Range located in the town of Mirnyy, Arkhangelsk Oblast. It is 
equipment made by the U.S. firm of "Metrum-97" [name as 
transliterated] for reproducing telemetry data. More precisely, 
it is a masgnetic tape player for decoding the flight parameters 
of strategic missiles developed and launched on test flights by 
the United States. 
  It was supplied here last year under a bilateral agreement 
between the countries, when the second Strategic Arms Reduction 
Treaty (START II) was signed. Similar Russian-made equipment -- 
in six rather than two racks -- has been set up on U.S. soil 
near Washington by our officers. 
  It was assumed that when the two states' parliaments 
ratified 
the treaty, the countries would, as a mark of the trust between 
them, exchange telemetry and other information on the 
performance of their new and old strategic missiles, their 
behavior in flight, and other important information, which would 
allow the generals, politicians, and missile designers to take a 
calm and very respectful view of both sides' scientific and 
technical developments and to monitor them with greater 
confidence. 
  They even exchanged as a goodwill gesture reels of magnetic 
tape recordings of previous test telemetry. The Americans gave 
us information on their ground-launched missile, while we gave 
them information on our sea-launched missile. Once again, they 
sent us one spool, while we sent them several. 
  This is not a question of excessive generosity. It is simply 
that the Americans take the information on their missiles' 
behavior in flight from a single satellite, while our testers 
have to take the information from nine measuring stations sited 
along the country's northern seaboard. From Mirnyy to 
Kamchatka. There are stations in Naryan-Mar, Taymyr, Yakutsk, 
and even on Novaya 
  The information is sent back by military couriers. This is 
when aircraft are flying and reindeer are not roaming the 
tundra. [sentence as published] 
  Because of this the countries set the timetable for the 
exchange of telemetry at 50 days. Less than that would be 
impossible. Otherwise, there might be suspicions of dishonesty. 
It would then have to be proved that there was no way out from 
Novaya Zemlya. That would be no justification in 
military-diplomatic circles -- especially as delivery of 
magnetic tapes is subsequently provided for by diplomatic pouch. 
  But, so far, there is nothing to deliver. Apart from the 
so-called demonstration reels, the high contracting parties have 
not exchanged anything else. Our parliament -- neither the old 
one nor the new one -- has not ratified START II. 
  A whole telemetry exchange department has been set up at the 
Russian test range. Colonel Aleksandr Vasilyev, its deputy 
chief, agreed to be photographed alongside the U.S. equipment 
for this newspaper. He says that they are not wasting time but 
are preparing to do serious work on the transatlantic missile 
information. In principle, they are already ready to do so. 
  So the ball is now in the State Duma's court.

  [Text] Moscow, 3 May -- The official visit of Greek Foreign 
Minister Karolos Papoulias to Russia, which was planned for 3-5 
May, has been postponed to a later date at the request of the 
Russian side. The date of the visit has not yet been 
determined, Grigoriy Karasin, director of the Press and 
Information Department of the Russian Foreign Ministry, told 
ITAR-TASS today. 
  The main reason for the postponement is linked to the 
signing 
of the agreement "Gaza-Jericho -- First" between the PLO and 
Israel, which will take place in Cairo tomorrow and which will 
be attended by Russian Foreign Minister A. Kozyrev, who left for 
the Egyptian capital today.

<F P=106> [Relayed by Warsaw TV Polonia Network in Polish] </F>
  [Text] [Announcer Jaroslaw Gugala] A private meeting 
between Polish and Russian Foreign Ministers Andrzej Olechowski 
and Andrey Kozyrev has taken place in the Polish Embassy in 
Moscow without the presence of journalists. Minister Olechowski 
believes that the eastern policy is one of the most important 
tasks of Polish diplomacy. 
  [Correspondent Witold Laskowski, Television Information 
Agency (TAI), Moscow, identified by caption] The meeting was a 
of a purely private character, but both politicians had time to 
discuss Polish-Russian relations. It is known, among other 
things, that, in June, Poland will be visited by Prime Minister 
Chernomyrdin, and we can expect the visit of Boris Yeltsin 
himself to attend ceremonies commemorating the 50th anniversary 
of the Warsaw Rising on 1 August. 
  Minister Olechowski confirmed Andrey Kozyrev's international 
reputation of, as he put it, a splendid interlocutor. In the 
opinion of the head of our diplomacy, there is a good climate 
for pushing matters ahead in Polish-Russian relations. We agree 
with the Russians regarding the objective of Europe without 
frontiers, the only difference being that we want to achieve 
this by joining NATO, and the Russians see everything 
differently.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 2 May (ITAR-TASS) -- The Russian Pacific 
Fleet is not conducting maneuvers and is not taking part in any 
exercises. This was how the Russian Navy's press center 
commented on reports by the foreign mass media about Pacific 
Fleet vessels taking part "in wide-scale maneuvers in the region 
of the South Kurils." It is alleged that Russia's surface 
fleet, in conjunction with ground and border troops, is working 
on the task of seizing foreign territories there. 
  It was explained to the ITAR-TASS correspondent at the 
Navy's 
main headquarters that the Red Banner Pacific Fleet is at 
present engaged in its usual training according to the schedule 
approved by the Russian Federation Defense Ministry. Seven of 
the fleet's warships are being used in the "Putina" operation 
aimed at protecting the nation's natural wealth, including in 
the region of the South Kurils. The fleet's participation in 
joint actions with border guards and the air force to protect 
the state border and to curb mass poaching which is detrimental 
to Russia has not been concealed. It was specifically reported 
in both the Russian and foreign mass media. 
  In the view of specialists of the Navy's main headquarters, 
the situation in the Far East is rather difficult. However, in 
their words, it is not a case of our fleet being "aggressive," 
but rather of the rapidly changing situation. Pacific Fleet 
warships and forces of the Russian Border Troops are stepping up 
their efforts [to increase] the effectiveness of the "Putina" 
operation. This is not to the liking of those who in recent 
years have grown accustomed to making brazen use of marine 
resources which by rights belong exclusively to Russia. Naval 
seamen claim that this explains the appearance of material 
misinforming the world public.

<F P=106> [From the "Today's World" program] </F>
  [Text] The DPRK has (?proposed to the United States) that 
talks be held to conclude a peace agreement. 
  Station commentator (Aleksey Kondratyev) writes on this: 
  Today, the United States and the DPRK (?have been talking) 
on 
the [word indistinct] of the Armistice Agreement signed in 1953. 
According to Pyongyang, (?the Korea cease-fire) agreement is 
incompatible with today's situation. [passage indistinct] 
(?Relevant authorities) of the United States and the DPRK have 
been making informal contacts. They have even held high-level 
talks as many as two times. The third round of talks will 
discuss issues on normalizing the relations between the two 
countries [words indistinct]. 
  The United States has been delaying talks for the reason 
that 
Pyongyang has expressed its own position regarding inspections 
of nuclear facilities. While Pyongyang refuses to accept 
complete international inspections of its own nuclear 
facilities, the United States persists in saying that it will 
only be willing to resume talks when the complete inspections 
are finished. [passage indistinct] 
  The United States has (?insisted) that the DPRK accept 
international inspections of the nuclear sites in Yongbyon. 
[passage indistinct] 
  Pyongyang is maintaining that the issue of inspections of 
the 
radiochemical laboratory should be raised only in the direct 
talks between the DPRK and the United States. The United States 
has also expressed its willingness to continue talks with the 
DPRK, holding that the nuclear issue should be resolved in a 
(?diplomatic) manner. 
  But, Washington is warning that international (?measures) 
can 
also be taken in case Pyongyang holds fast to an unconstructive 
position regarding nuclear inspections. But, if such sanctions 
are taken, the situation on the peninsula will (?become) more 
dangerous. So, today's task lies in easing the tension on the 
peninsula. 
  A measure to resolve the nuclear crisis in a peaceful way 
should be (?worked out). An international conference 
recommended by Russia will help (?make such a measure feasible).

  [Text] Birobidjan 3 May TASS -- Borderguards of the 
Birobidjan detachment and inspectors of the Far Eastern Fishing 
Inspection have put up a reliable barrier to Chinese poachers, 
who began to violate Russian waters after the Amur river had 
cleared of ice. 
  As a result of one of the recent raids, they were able to 
prevent more than 20 poaching attempts in Russian waters. The 
borderguards confiscated hundreds of meters of small-mesh 
fishing nets and found many wooden and pneumatic boats, hidden 
on uninhabited Russian islands. Their crews had to be "fished 
out" of riverside brush. All the violators were deported from 
Russian territory. 
  ITAR-TASS was told at the headquarters of the Biribidjan 
borderguard detachment that such actions by borderguards and 
inspection teams would be carried out regularly this season. It 
was decided to put an end to the massive violations of the 
Russian border by Chinese poachers. The results of the first 
raid have shown that the situation can be kept under control.

<F P=106> [Irina Savvateyeva report: "Ministers Have To Learn Genre </F>
of Explanatory Notes"] 
  [Text] Last Thursday millions of TV viewers had the 
pleasure of seeing some colorful scenes from the life of the 
Russian Government. There were brief pieces on the evening news 
about the Council of Ministers Presidium session, but how much 
interesting information they contained! 
  Now we know that our ministers and vice premiers, when they 
meet on Thursdays, are "not playing with toys but running the 
country!" (V. Chernomyrdin). And that attendance is a very 
strict matter for them. If people fail to show up, the ruling 
is brief -- "take explanatory notes from all of them, including 
the deputy premiers." In short, it is stern! 
  Out of curiosity we attempted to know just which of the vice 
premiers would be reprimanded? It turned out that it was none 
other than Aleksandr Shokhin who could expect a scolding. 
IZVESTIYA was told in the other deputies' reception offices that 
their bosses had attended the Presidium session. 
  People may even have been angry with Shokhin. The fact is 
that the government has been unable for the second week running 
to conclude the hearings on the fulfillment of its own 9 March 
1994 decree "On the Russian Economy's Position and the Prospects 
for its Development in 1994," where one of the main reporters 
was the Ministry of Economics representative. 
  This question was on last Thursday's agenda and, we were 
told 
by the government's press service, "its examination was not 
completed." Shokhin was on vacation at the time, and the report 
was delivered by his first deputy -- Yakov Urinson. But at the 
last, scandalous, Presidium session the matter was removed from 
the agenda altogether. Owing to the absence of many government 
members, the television explained. 
  Incidentally, the minister of economics and one of his 
deputies may succeed in finding good reasons to explain away 
their absence. As of last Thursday he has been taking part in a 
session of the Interim Committee of the IMF and the World Bank 
in Washington as part of a large government delegation. 
  Admittedly, this alibi might be undermined by the fact that 
the session officially ended on Wednesday the 27th. And it has 
to be said that some delegation members were already back in 
Moscow Thursday morning. But not all. Viktor Vladimirovich 
Gerashchenko also failed to make it to the Presidium session. 
But we must assume that the head of the Central Bank and the 
vice premier will not simply be taking it easy in the 
Americas.... 
  The premier is also said to be unhappy with the State 
Committee for the Management of State Property. Chubays, 
admittedly, did not blot his attendance copybook. But his 
deputies allegedly slipped up and failed to supply certain 
papers in time. 
  ...The most interesting aspect of this story is -- who will 
collect the reports? But how could there be any doubt -- it 
will, of course, be Vladimir Petrovich Kvasov, leader of the 
government apparatus. To be honest, I would give a month's 
salary to be a fly on the wall when the ministers present their 
explanations. 
  And so what if they are ministers? God himself has ordered 
them to obey Kvasov; after all, the leader of the apparatus has 
also been elevated to ministerial rank by the current premier. 
And what about the vice premier? What about Viktor 
Vladimirovich Gerashchenko?... 
  Of course, as they say, it will not be easy for Viktor 
Chernomyrdin to handle the collective of ministers and vice 
premiers entrusted to him....

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Startsev] </F>
  [Text] Rome, 2 May -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin has 
accepted with satisfaction the invitation to attend the G-7 
meeting to take place in Naples this July. As became known 
today from informed sources within the office of the chairman of 
the Italian Council of Ministers, the Russian president had sent 
a message to Carlo Azeglio Ciampi in which he noted the head of 
the Italian Government's great contribution to attaining 
agreement on Russian participation in examining political issues 
of international security and in preparing the meeting's final 
political document. This decision, the message notes, creates 
good prerequisites for the Naples meeting to become an important 
new milestone in relations between Russia and the G-7. 
  As is known, in late April, C.A. Ciampi told B. Yeltsin 
about 
a preliminary timetable and the form of Russian participation in 
the forthcoming summit. The head of government of Italy, the 
country that currently holds the G-7 presidency, made 
considerable efforts to ensure that the Naples summit be held as 
"seven plus one." It is noteworthy that Russia will not only 
take part in discussing political problems, but will also be 
directly involved in preparations for the Naples conference. B. 
Yeltsin's letter says that he has instructed the Russian 
Federation Government to join most actively in preparations for 
the summit.

agreement on cooperation in the field of nuclear energy was 
signed in Vilnius Friday by Philippe Rouvillois, director 
general of the French Atomic Energy Agency, and Algimantas 
Stasiukynas, Lithuanian energy minister.

Ignalina nuclear power plant. 
  Vytautas Bieliauskas, head of the nuclear energy division of 
the Lithuanian Energy Ministry, said the European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development allocated 33 million ECU to 
upgrade safety at Ignalina. The visiting French delegation said

<F P=106> [Report by GK: "Privatization: Looking Forward to the </F>
Second Stage"] 
  [Text] While the first stage in privatization -- when 
state property was distributed to citizens for investment 
coupons -- is drawing to a close, the government has drafted two 
new laws on privatization. These laws project the establishment 
of two new institutions -- the Privatization Agency that would 
handle the privatization of remaining state assets, and the 
State Property Fund that would manage the remaining state assets 
or their part in private enterprises. These two institutions 
must be separated because the office that manages state property 
will, certainly, not be interested in speeding up privatization 
and bringing nearer its own natural breakup. 
  At a press conference yesterday, Andrew L. Baldwin and 
Robert 
Stone, leaders of the European Union program for assisting 
privatization in the Baltic states, assessed the process of 
privatization in our country and one-year results of the PHARE 
[Poland and Hungary Action for Restructuring the Economy]. In 
their opinion, privatization in Lithuania is successful in 
comparison with other Baltic and East European countries. 
Privatization for hard currency alone could be more effective. 
They implied that the government had made a mistake by refusing 
to sell the "Lietuva" hotel for $10 million. 
  The government pledges to extend privatization for 
investment 
coupons which has not been completed. In reply to a question 
from TIESA as to whether the law on primary privatization was 
worth changing, R. Stone reminded everyone that 187 amendments 
have already been made to this law. In his opinion, however, 
the law must be made more rational, primarily by reducing 
privileges to workers at enterprises.

  [Text] As reported earlier, Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of 
the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly, arrived in Bishkek 
yesterday. Vladimir Shumeyko and Medetkhan Sherimkulov, chairman 
of the Jogorku Kenesh, addressed journalists. 
  [Begin recording] [Sherimkulov] I am pleased to greet 
Vladimir Philippovich in Kyrgyzstan. He is highly respected by 
all of us. We have centuries-old friendly relations with Russia 
and I hope that we, with Vladimir Philippovich and our 
parliaments, will do everything so as to maintain and facilitate 
friendly and close cooperation between our states and our people. 
  [Shumeyko] A parliamentary delegation from Azerbaijan has 
visited us recently. It was led by the chairman of its Supreme 
Soviet, and he and I have agreed to give an impetus [words 
indistinct] to the meeting in Bishkek and peacemaking efforts, 
which are being taken by a group from the Interparliamentary 
Assembly led by Medetkhan Sherimkulovoch, his personal visit to 
[words indistinct]. 
  I believe it is useful for three heads of parliaments of the 
three member-states of the Interparliamentary Assembly to gather 
here. We have agreed to consider Nagorno-Karabakh as one of the 
sides involved in the conflict. I emphasize here: one of the 
sides of the conflict. You know that Azerbaijan's policy was 
that only two states are involved in the conflict, Armenia and 
Azerbaijan, and Nagorno-Karabakh is [words indistinct] of the 
conflict. I believe that considering it as one of the 
participants of the conflict is a (?major step). A possibility 
for holding talks at the level of heads of parliaments [words 
indistinct] the previous activity of our peacemaking group which 
is led by Medetkhan Sherimkulovich. It has done quite a lot in 
preparing grounds for the talks. I pin hopes on common sense. 
  [Sherimkulov] [Words indistinct] the Interparliamentary 
Assembly led by Vladimir Philippovich Shumeyko will give a 
certain weight to the talks [words indistinct]. Indeed, we hope 
that we will be able to get off the ground in solving this 
problem. We know that both Azerbaijan and Armenia and 
Nagorno-Karabakh [words indistinct] this pointless bloody war 
which killed people, has made thousands of people homeless, 
increased the number of refugees and destroyed their homes. 
There has never been a case before when heads of parliament 
gathered together and sat around a negotiating table. This has 
never happened before at such a level. I think that this is a 
good sign. 
  [Shumeyko] You can't look without optimism at life. I can't 
give any other example [words indistinct]. We, at the 
Interparliamentary Assembly, or in other words parliamentarians, 
representing their own people, do not have the right to leave 
this mattter unattended and to be pessimistic about it despite 
all the difficulties. We should work hard on settling this 
conflict, no matter how long it takes. That's what we intend to 
do. [end recording]

  According to the newspaper, even those who do not believe in 
the sincerity of authorities and would like to have 
"revolutionary" changes, "are forced to heed the unwillingness 
of the popular masses to settle their problems in the streets". 
  Here is an opinion expressed by Moscow worker Aleksey 
Dorokhin: "The leaders of the state should learn to think about 
people. We support the government both in words and labour. I 
believe that some forces are deliberately driving a wedge 
between us. "The main thing now is not to fall for provocations 
but to continue efficient work". 
  Writing about World Press Freedom Day which was marked on 
Tuesday, the same newspaper singles out an extract from a 
message to Russian journalists by UNESCO Director-General 
Federico Mayor, saying: "Democratic changes in Russia would have 
been impossible without bold and persistent activities of 
journalists who believe in the freedom of expressing opinion and 
who work for it". 
  The TRUD newspaper also discusses the above treaty in its 
commentary under the following headline "Road to Accord Is Not 
an Easy One, But It Should Be Covered". 
  In the newspaper's opinion, the essence of this agreement is 
simple: "To put common interests above group, party, deparmental 
and regional aspirations and to preclude a chance of settling 
problems in society by force". 
  Putting the question of what attitude should be taken to the 
treaty, the newspaper says that one should not overestimate it 
and to sleep on laurels. Taking into account the fact that the 
treaty was not signed by forces ready for any methods of 
struggle, TRUD writes that "the danger of violence will loom 
over society in some or other way". 
  The KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper writes about the agreement of 
the heads of government of the Commonwealth of Independent 
States on mutual recognition of privileges and guarantees for 
veterans and invalids of the Great Patriotic War, 1941-1945, 
participants in combat operations in the territory of other 
states and families of fallen servicemen as well as supplements 
1 and 2 to the present agreement. 
  The same newspaper writes how the government settles 
problems 
of supplying the Armed Forces with foodstuffs in the conditions 
when the cattle and poultry populations sharply dropped in the 
country. 
  Noting that the Army now controls not 67 state farms which 
remained after the collapse of the Soviet Union but many more, 
the newspaper notes that these so-called military state farms 
should become one of guaranteed sources for supplying the Army 
and the Navy with foodstuffs. 
  The press devotes much space to materials describing how 
residents of Moscow and other cities marked May Day. The 
RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA newspaper carries its report on this event 
under the title "Well, we have marked May Day. Quietly. People 
were not vociferous and did not frown much". 
  The newspaper quotes slogans voiced during a May Day 
demonstration organised by Moscow trade unions: "Check 
Industrial Slump. Bridle Inflation. Pay Wages in Time". 
  RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA notes that "the holiday passed in a 
civilised way. There was no 'fistfighting'. There was no 
references to "the great, omnipotent and united party". 
  Publishing detailed accounts of May Day celebrations, the 
PRAVDA newspaper stresses words that "columns of Moscow workers 
peacefully marched at places where blood had been shed last 
year". 
  The newspaper quotes an opinion by Gennadiy Zyuganov, 
chairman of the Russian Communist Party, that the May Day 
demonstration became an action by "those who disagrees with 
reforms of extremism and with an attempt at legalising 
inequality and injustice with the help of the social treaty". 
  The same newspaper gives a summary of an interview by 
President Boris Yeltsin to the French FIGARO newspaper. It 
singles out his words that "the true danger (eds: for Russia) 
will be the next president", since, Yeltsin said, "I do not see 
a possible candidate. At least at present". According to the 
KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper, it carries a sensational article 
entitled "Russia's northern fleet is being killed slowly and 
with relish". As a result of a shortage of funds appropriated 
for the fleet's needs, "The number of the fleet's ships and 
vessels dropped by 45 per cent since 1988". 
  "The utilisation of nuclear-powered submarines provokes 
special concern", the newspaper stresses.

<F P=106> [Video report by unidentified correspondent -- from the </F>
"Vesti" newscast] 
  [Text] [Announcer] The State Duma and the Russian 
Government are preparing a federal law that would regulate 
coverage of the activities of the state power bodies by the 
state media. 
  [Correspondent] The draft has been prepared under the 
guidance of Mikhail Poltoranin, chairman of the Duma committee 
on information policy. The Duma intends to adopt the federal 
law by the second half of May. 
  The draft of the law stipulates what kind of information 
about the activities of the president, the Constitutional Court, 
the government, and the parliament must be included by state 
radio and television companies in their daily information 
programs. A detailed list is concluded by a phrase referring to 
other facts about the activity of federal bodies of state power 
that could be of public interest. This means that the 
obligatory list could be expanded indefinitely. 
  Let us have another look. Reports about the work of the 
president, the parliament, the government, and its presidium 
must be presented as a separate block, and only at the beginning 
of a bulletin. The size of these blocks is also strictly 
stipulated. Information programs are not to comment on the work 
of the president, parliament, or government. Journalists are 
also told when and whom they must interview at the Federal 
Assembly. Not obeying the new law may be treated as a criminal 
offense. 
  So, if the new law is adopted, state radio and television 
will not be simply deprived of comments: Vesti and other 
programs will contain only what all branches of state power with 
their countless press services will see fit to disclose about 
themselves. However, any citizen of free Russia will be able to 
hear analysis and comments on decisions taken by the authorities 
from programs produced by private radio and television stations, 
or, as in the good old days, from Radio Freedom or the BBC. In 
this case, journalists from the Russian radio and television 
will have to congratulate themselves and the public with a new 
victory for freedom of information in a state bureaucracy 
version.

  [Text] Gennadiy Zyuganov, chairman of the Communist Party 
of the Russian Federation Central Executive Committee: 
  "There was a sense of real solidarity. Political parties and 
trade unions marched side by side. With their own slogans, but 
together. And this after the pomp and circumstances of the 
signing of the `Treaty on Social Accord'! This year's May Day 
demonstration was a demonstration by those who disagree with the 
extremism of the reforms and the attempt to use the social 
treaty to legitimize inequality and injustice. 
  "It did not work. Even the law enforcement officers were 
polite. They realized that fighting and battling with your own 
people is a horrible exercise and they showed restraint, despite 
being urged on. Only the country's leaders showed no restraint. 
Leaders congratulated working people on May Day in almost every 
state; it was only our leaders -- former members and candidate 
members of the Politburo -- who `forgot.'" 
  Viktor Anpilov, secretary of the Russian Communist Workers' 
Party and leader of "Working Russia": 
  "This year's May Day demonstration was a worthy response to 
the self-righteous `Treaty on Social Accord,' to the spread of 
capitalism, and to the ransacking of the people. 
  "You will note that we traveled the entire 10-km route 
peacefully -- if there is no violence from the authorities, then 
their calls for `accord' are unnecessary. 
  "People are striving for unity -- Communists walked side by 
side with anarchists. It is a question of rallying the `elite' 
-- the leaders of political parties and movements." 
  Lyudmila Vartazarova, chairman of the Socialist Party of 
Working People: 
  "I have mixed feelings about May Day. On the one hand, it is 
good that people came with specific slogans. But, on the other 
hand, fewer people attended than last year. Why? Were they 
unhappy about the form of protest?"

<F P=106> [Interview with Mikhail Shmakov, chairman of the Federation </F>
of Independent Trade Unions of Russia, by Fedor Yemchenko; date 
and place not given: "Few Reasons for Rejoicing" -- first four 
paragraphs are introduction] 
  [Text] The chairman of the Federation of Independent Trade 
Unions of Russia [FITUR] was one of the first to put his 
signature to the Treaty on Social Accord. It is worth noting 
that this took place on the eve of the holiday celebrating 
solidarity among working people. 
  The desire to change anything and everything in Russia has 
not bypassed May Day either. It has been proposed that 
henceforth it be called the spring labor holiday. A fine name, 
of course, but it does not reflect this date's historical 
essence. As we know, it was not at all because joy filled their 
hearts that workers first went out onto the streets on 1 May. 
  Russian working people have few reasons for rejoicing now 
either. That is why columns of working people will be carrying 
not flowers and leaders' portraits (as was the case at 
festivities full of false cheer) but demands and appeals to 
those who are in power. 
  On the eve of May Day TRUD's correspondent met with FITUR 
Chairman Mikhail Shmakov. 
  [Yemchenko] Mikhail Viktorovich, you recently had a meeting 
with the Russian president. What prompted it and what problems 
were discussed? 
  [Shmakov] The meeting was organized at our request. The 
economic situation in the country has hit labor collectives 
above all. The mutual nonpayments crisis has led to a situation 
whereby wages have stopped being paid to people. Social tension 
in certain regions and sectors of production has reached a 
critical level. Therefore the need for a direct meeting with the 
head of state arose, in order to make him aware of the full 
seriousness of the current situation and to state the Russian 
trade unions' position without using intermediaries. 
  [Yemchenko] What were the results of the talk with the 
president? 
  [Shmakov] I must observe that Boris Nikolayevich reacted to 
our alarm with understanding. After our meeting, incidentally, 
he instructed Premier V. Chernomyrdin to solve the problems 
which caused the closure of Zil's [I.A. Likhachev Motor Vehicle 
Plant] main production line. 
  Questions of reorganizing industrial enterprises were 
discussed at the meeting with Yeltsin. Putting it simply, 
problems of bankruptcy. Our position is quite definite here: 
Every enterprise must be dealt with individually. Plants and 
factories are often being shut down not because there is no 
demand for their output but because consumers do not have the 
means to purchase it. It became apparent from the conversation 
with the president that some of his advisers are urging the head 
of state and government to take what is in their view an easier 
path: Declaring bankrupt all enterprises which are currently 
unable to settle accounts for raw materials, energy, and 
transportation services. But this measure will lead to one-half 
of the country's being unemployed. 
  We favor the preservation of jobs. If an enterprise's output 
is really not needed by the market, that means its specialty 
must be changed and new technology introduced. People must have 
work and earn their keep. Unfortunately, there are many people 
in power structures who support Russia's conversion into a 
retail market for foreign firms' output. They say that this way 
the population's demand can be satisfied faster and more 
reliably. But we will thereby be encouraging the development of 
foreign producers, and we will ruin our own industry once and 
for all. 
  I want to stress that our position and the president's 
views on this question completely coincide. 
  [Yemchenko] It is understandable that society's social 
problems were the main topic of your conversation. I would like 
to know whether you broached the equally pressing question of 
the attack on trade union rights? As far as I know it is being 
actively discussed at virtually all trade union aktiv meetings 
and conferences. I am referring to the transfer of control of 
the social insurance fund to the state, attempts to lay hands on 
trade union property, and the draft of the new Labor Code which 
gives trade union organizations a secondary role. 
  [Shmakov] As regards the draft Labor Code prepared by Labor 
Ministry staffers, I can say one thing: We will never agree to 
such a version of this document. It is not only that it demeans 
the role of trade unions in regulating labor relations. This 
draft envisages a sharp reduction in social guarantees for hired 
workers. In other words, it is a rejection of all that has been 
won by working people in the long years of struggle. I think 
that even now, during discussion of the draft, its authors can 
see that this version of it will not be accepted. 
  As regards control of the social insurance fund. The State 
Duma is now preparing a law on social insurance. We have made 
our own proposals in it. This fund should operate under trade 
union control, otherwise it is unimaginable. 
  [Yemchenko] I suppose that at the meeting with the president 
you could not have failed to broach a document such as the 
Treaty on Social Accord. 
  [Shmakov] Quite so. Say what you like, today the problem of 
civic peace in society worries the country's entire population 
equally. The squabbles on the political Olympus are costing our 
state too dear. That is why the trade unions support the 
president's idea of achieving a solution based on civic accord 
to the crisis which has engulfed all aspects of our life. 
  In deciding to join the Treaty on Social Accord, the FITUR 
General Council Executive Committee noted that the draft 
document includes the main critical comments made by sector 
trade unions, regional trade union associations, and primary 
trade union organizations. Thus, for example, it recognizes the 
importance of implementing the general agreement for 1994 
between all-Russia trade union associations, all-Russia 
employers' associations, and the government, as well as sector 
wages agreements. In short, the treaty envisages the use of 
levers of social partnership, and beyond this, we know, lies the 
solution of specific questions associated with the payment of 
wages, pensions, benefits and with creating a decent living 
standard for people. 
  At the same time the text of the document does not take 
account of a number of important proposals, therefore we will 
sign the treaty not unconditionally but taking account of the 
trade unions' dissenting opinion. This is that there can be no 
question of a "moratorium on strikes:" If through the fault of 
the authorities the collective treaty and the agreement on 
questions of wages, labor conditions, employment, and preserving 
established social guarantees are not implemented -- in this 
case the trade unions reserve the right to take collective 
action. 
  We are also insisting that the existing budget debt as 
regards the payment of wages must be cleared not within one year 
but as early as in the first half of the year. 
  In our dissenting opinion we demand that Federation 
components' organs of state power solve a nationwide problem: 
Preserving the system of free general secondary (full) and 
primary vocational education. 
  Finally, the document must provide for an efficient 
mechanism 
of responsibility for all parties which have signed it. 
  [Yemchenko] A very important condition. But I am afraid 
that few people know the structure of the "mechanism." How can 
influence be exerted on the power structures if they contravene 
the signed document's provisions? 
  [Shmakov] As you know, the country's president is a 
guarantor ensuring that the commitments assumed will be met. He 
has sufficient powers. In this context I would like to say that 
not so long ago we signed a tripartite general agreement between 
entrepreneurs, the government, and trade unions. It envisages 
the prompt payment of wages, guaranteed labor safety, and the 
preservation of jobs. 
  [Yemchenko] Mikhail Viktorovich, the May Day holidays are 
almost here. This year they coincide with Easter. Because of 
this there have been calls to scrap any demonstrations and 
processions. What is the trade unions' position regarding this? 
  [Shmakov] For us May Day has been and will remain a day of 
solidarity among working people in the struggle for their 
rights. That is why trade unions are organizing demonstrations 
and rallies, at which demands defending the interests of hired 
workers will once again be heard. 
  [Yemchenko] In that case what do you understand by the word 
solidarity and how can it be expressed now? 
  [Shmakov] I will guess the subtext of your question. Yes, 
every sector has its own specific interests. And sector trade 
unions endeavor to protect them above all. But modern 
production development is such that all sectors within it are 
closely linked to each other. Therefore working people, 
wherever they work, have common interests, and that means common 
objectives of struggle. That is the whetstone on which 
solidarity is sharpened. 
  [Yemchenko] I think that solidarity among working people is 
also demonstrated by the extent to which trade unions are 
united. Unfortunately the reverse process can now be observed. 
What is your view of the future of the Russian trade union 
movement? 
  [Shmakov] Trade unions, like all of our society, are now 
experiencing a period of renewal. This process is never easy. 
At the moment it is too hard to say how they will emerge from 
it. But the fact that the trade union movement will in time 
become strong and united goes without saying. Hired workers 
have no other way of standing up for and protecting their social 
interests.

<F P=106> [Viktor Ivanov report in the "Government Structural Policy" </F>
column: "Economic Restructuring Began With Creating a 
Commission"] 
  [Text] The Russian Government has returned to the idea of 
economic restructuring: That much is obvious from the decree On 
Forming the Russian Federation Government Commission on 
Structural Policy, which was officially disseminated yesterday. 
The commission is headed by Vice Premier Aleksandr Shokhin, and 
has become his first step as the main developer of Russia's 
economic strategy. 
  The government's special attention to structural policy is 
natural. Economic restructuring -- that is to say, ending 
support for economically hopeless branches and redistribution of 
resources for the benefit of efficient enterprises -- is a key 
element of market reforms in any country. Intensification of 
government efforts in this sphere is long overdue: Up to now, 
in spite of protestations about the need for economic 
restructuring, everything has been confined to a rather vague 
decree On Selective State Structural Policy in 1993 (it was 
adopted exactly a year ago). Since then no discernible moves in 
implementing the structural policy have been made, with the 
exception of last December's decree on stimulating the creation 
of financial industrial groups. Therefore the appearance of a 
special government commission on structural policy should 
demonstrate that the authorities have not forgotten the idea of 
restructuring Russia's economy. 
  It is also perfectly natural that the new commission has 
been 
initiated by Economy Minister Aleksandr Shokhin who headed it. 
Recently it became especially noticeable that having become 
economy minister, Shokhin still had to concentrate his main 
efforts not so much on internal economic problems as on talks 
with Western creditors and international financial organizations 
on the issue of Russia's foreign debts. Meanwhile Shokhin's 
reinforced positions in the government and the fact that Premier 
Viktor Chernomyrdin assigned him the actual role as chief 
developer of economic strategy called for unorthodox moves from 
him: so as to prove that he can cope well with his new role. 
The creation of a structural policy commission has become the 
first such step. 
  Even so the mere fact that the commission has been set up 
does not indicate yet that the Russian Government has a clear 
perception of how this policy should be implemented. In theory 
this is precisely what the commission is to decide (the decree 
in particular tasks it with preparing within a month proposals 
on volumes and sources of funds necessary for conducting 
structure policy). It is clear already at this stage, however, 
that the commission intends to proceed from the principle of 
"selectivity:" In other words, stress in every way that state 
financial support will be provided not to all industries but 
only to a chosen few. Likewise it is clear that the commission 
will recognize the fuel and energy complex, which was recently 
promised such assistance once again, as one of the main 
recipients of state financial assistance. Finally, (given 
Shokhin's experience in contacts with Western creditors) it is 
quite likely that the commission will work out proposals on 
financing economic restructuring with Western aid. It is 
noteworthy that recently an idea has been increasingly popular 
in international financial circles that no country can 
restructure its economy without massive financial aid from 
abroad. 
<H5>  From regulations on the structural policy commission </H5>
  the commission's tasks are: to develop a federal program for 
restructuring Russia's economy for 1994-1995; define priorities 
in developing the economic branches; work out forms and methods 
of implementing state selective structural policy; and prepare 
proposals on selecting enterprises needing assistance and 
sources to finance this assistance 
  the commission coordinates the work of the Economy Ministry 
and other power bodies in pursuing structural policy 
  the commission provides assistance to enterprises on a 
special- purpose and repayable basis 
  representatives of entrepreneurial circles and commercial 
banks may take part in the work of the commission's 
scientific-methodological council.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Enterprises on the Brink of </F>
Collapse Will Have To Prove Their Solvency or Go Bust"] 
  [Text] The president's edict "On Measures To Implement 
Legislative Acts on the Insolvency (Bankruptcy) of Enterprises," 
as well as his note on this subject to Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, are evidence that we are on the threshold of a 
qualitatively new stage of economic reform. Strictly speaking, 
we should have gone past that point a long time ago, but the 
undeveloped nature of market relations, the complex economic 
situation, and political instability have not permitted us to do 
this. 
  The first two factors are still in place. As far as the 
third is concerned, certain positive moves have evidently 
occurred here. To all appearances, Viktor Chernomyrdin's cabinet 
felt sufficiently strong to set about tackling a very unpopular 
task. In terms of its social and economic consequences, the 
administration of mass bankruptcies is comparable to the price 
liberalization in January 1992. The expected "pluses" as 
regards putting the economy's structure in good order are 
obvious, but will the possible "minuses" finally sink it? 
  Unfortunately, the market mechanism for bankruptcies is 
being 
put into effect using glaringly nonmarket methods. It will not 
be the market which singles out the "no-hopers," but officials 
at various levels in accordance with criteria which they 
themselves have devised. It is proposed, for example, that the 
basic indicator of insolvency be the so-called liquidity 
coefficient, which is derived by dividing the sum of financial 
assets by the sum of short-term credits received by the 
enterprise. According to figures from the Russian Federation 
State Committee for Statistics, more than 1,000 Russian 
enterprises could by this criterion have been deemed to be 
bankrupt at the beginning of this year. 
  Clearly, those who do not wish to go bankrupt will devise a 
thousand and one ways of not getting on the "black list." Those 
who, on the contrary, want to go bankrupt will find this an 
absolutely simple task: Having acquired and spent credit, they 
go under the hammer. You can have no doubt that quite a few 
will wish to do this. In January of this year alone, more than 
100 enterprises applied to Russian Federation State Committee 
for Management of State Property volunteering to be declared 
bankrupt. In the opinion of legal specialists, they wanted in 
this way to avoid an even less pleasant court examination 
involving their creditors. 
  There is in general a danger that energetic 
behind-the-scenes 
activities will unfold around the administrative "bankruptcy" 
procedures, with all the features associated with them from 
"disinterested" lobbying to bribery and financial machinations. 
  We can expect the same when the question of how to deal with 
insolvent enterprises is resolved: Should they be made to go 
bankrupt or should they be given money in order to "rescue" 
them. As we can see, there is a significant difference, and it 
will again be an official who decides whether to eliminate or 
spare them. 
  The paradox lies in the fact that in both cases a lot of 
money will be required. Private investors are unlikely to step 
up their involvement here, therefore the basic responsibility 
for expenditure will again fall on the budgets at all levels. 
Their "reserves of stability" will clearly determine the rate 
and scale of the bankruptcy process in a decisive manner. 
  Whatever happens, it is wrong to delay the reorganization of 
insolvent enterprises, and we do not possess any mechanisms 
other than administrative ones. The task is to make this 
process manageable, predictable, efficient, and open, and to 
reduce social costs to a minimum. Many ministries and 
departments are working on this at present.

<F P=106> [Boris Reznik and Natalya Ostrovskaya reports under the </F>
general heading "Operation Fishing Season": "Protecting Our 
Fish on the Border.... Homegrown Poachers Still Being Caught"] 
  [Text] Far East -- The scale of brazen robbery in our 
territorial waters can be judged from the figures -- more than 
9,000 violations of the state border have been recorded in the 
space of just one year off the Kurils alone. These were mainly 
interminable incursions by Japanese poachers aiming to make 
illegal catches of fish and seafood. 
  Naturally, the Russian side could not tolerate this 
situation. The commander of the country's Border Guard Troops 
carefully planned and has successfully launched the wide-ranging 
"Fishing Season 1994" operation, in which ships and aircraft of 
the Pacific Fleet, staffers from fishery and environmental 
protection organs, customs officers, militiamen, and 
Prosecutor's Office staffers have been taking part. 
  "I would like to note," Colonel General Andrey Nikolayev, 
commander in chief of the Russian Federation Border Guard 
Troops, told me, "that Operation `Fishing Season 1994' will not 
actually be limited to just one year. It will continue until 
such time as we restore order and can ensure the effective 
defense of Russia's interests here, on our Far Eastern borders. 
So this measure should be seen as systematic official military 
cooperation between the Border Guard Troops and the various 
environmental protection and law enforcement organs under a 
single plan aimed at completely safeguarding the state's 
economic interests. 
  "From the very first days of Operation `Fishing Season'," 
the 
commander in chief said, "I have been asked how many poachers' 
fishing smacks have been arrested and how much illegally caught 
fish and seafood has been confiscated. I would like to stress 
that our main task is not to do this but to make poaching itself 
impossible. We can be said to be succeeding. I reported the 
situation on the state border, including the Far Eastern border, 
to President Yeltsin and I received political approval for the 
planned extensive measures to strengthen Russia's borders. And 
the government has provided economic support for these measures. 
So that our subunits are now up to their full complement and 
are being issued with modern equipment to ensure that their 
service goes normally. 
  "This is shown by just one detail -- space-based 
intelligence-gathering has been used in Operation `Fishing 
Season 1994.' Movements of poaching ships are now being 
monitored from space, and their positions show up clear as 
day.... Being in control of the operational situation, we are 
able to take the appropriate measures to respond." 
  The commander in chief also reported that, as well as the 
name change -- to Federal Border Service-Border Guard Troops 
High Command -- there has also been a change in the actual 
substance of the department's activities. Now it will be 
involved not only in serving on the country's borders but also 
in shaping state policy on the border. 
  Vladivostok -- The first week of Operation "Fishing Season 
1994" has shown that it is none other than our own Russian 
fishermen who are now the main violators of Russia's economic 
interests in the expanses of its Far Eastern seas. So says Anas 
Nurutdinov, deputy commander of the Pacific Border District. 
  "Fishing Season" had been widely publicized long before it 
began. But, as we know, there is no way of scaring "our own 
people." Over the past week nine intruder vessels have fallen 
into the "net." On Day One of the operation the Border Guard 
Troops, militiamen, fishery protection officers, and customs 
officers -- taking part in such operations for the first time -- 
detained the Sakhalin-registered seiner Omar-1 with contraband 
on board. Crabs, which had not been recorded anywhere by the 
captain, were destined to "find their way" abroad. 
  People abroad value not only high-quality seafood but also 
fresh-frozen fish. Thus, having stated that his vessel was 
empty and not carrying a cargo, the captain of the Maritime Kray 
trawler 50 Let VLKSM planned to ship 260 tonnes of perch, cod, 
and plaice to the South Korean port of Pusan for his own 
commercial interests. As he had managed to accumulate a 
considerable cargo, an investigation will follow. And Russia's 
"Primorrybprom" Enterprise will pay a fine of several hundred 
million rubles [R]. The Maritime Kray Internal Affairs 
Administration Department for Combating Crimes in the Fishing 
Industry also has a big "catch" to its credit. It was not for 
nothing that its staffers recently met the factory ship Iyeronim 
Uborevich returning to Vladivostok from a fishing trip. On 
board they discovered fresh-frozen and entirely unaccounted-for 
products worth R27 million. 
  There are 15 coastguard vessels, four ships from 
"Primorrybvod" and "Sakhalinrybvod," and two ships from the 
Pacific Fleet involved in Operation "Fishing Season," as well as 
daily patrols by Border Guard Troops' aircraft and helicopters. 
The entire Far Eastern sea area -- from the Bering Straits to 
the Sea of Japan -- is being monitored. As the ice situation 
improves, the number of coastguard vessels will be increased. 
  With the adoption of the government decision on Operation 
"Fishing Season 1994" the Far Eastern Border Guard Troops have 
finally been able to use their fleet and aircraft. Fully. 
Until recently the guards of the country's Far Eastern borders 
were on subsistence rations, without enough money or fuel. They 
have now received both "for the operation." 
  The first phase of "Fishing Season" will end 10 May. Phase 
Two will begin 10 June. It, like Phase One, will last 20 days. 
What then? Subsistence rations again? Will poachers once 
again be fishing off the South Kurils with impunity? Today, 
according to the Border Guard Troops, it is relatively quiet in 
this area. But until quite recently mass incursions into our 
waters by Japanese and other fishing smacks had been a common 
occurrence. 
  Specialists have calculated that the annual losses suffered 
from illegal fishing in Far Eastern waters run to more than $2 
billion. That amount would be even bigger, were it not for the 
Border Guard Troops and militia. 
  Now for the first time, and despite all the difficulties, 
the 
state last year recovered $363,000 from foreign intruders in the 
form of fines. The militia in the shape of the Maritime Kray 
Internal Affairs Administration Department for Combating Crimes 
in the Fishing Industry alone, has recovered R6.7 billion for 
the state. That makes good the losses incurred from last year's 
thefts on ships and at enterprises in the Maritime Kray 
fisheries sector. So the expenditure on Operation "Fishing 
Season 1994" will be more than recouped.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mikhail Shmakov, chairman of the Federation </F>
of Independent Trade Unions of Russia, by Anatoliy Baranov; 
place and date not given: "Are Trade Unions a School for 
Optimism"] 
  [Text] [Baranov] May Day is a time when Russian trade 
unions are -- ex officio -- at the center of attention. 
Therefore the first question I would like to raise with you, 
Mikhail Shmakov, chairman of the Federation of Independent Trade 
Unions of Russia [FITUR], concerns the nature of May Day. 
  [Shmakov] We do not want to "surrender" this holiday to 
anyone. It is our trade union holiday. Earlier it was called 
the Day of International Solidarity of Working People, today it 
is dubbed "the day of spring and labor," which is not altogether 
correct. You may use the word "international" or you may 
diplomatically refrain from doing so -- inner solidarity and 
appreciation of the common problems which beset people today, 
particularly people in Russia, are what is important. These 
problems are the payment of wages on time, the retention of 
jobs, and, in general terms, the stabilization of the economy -- 
simply so that your own plant can provide a livelihood -- jobs 
and a pay packet which enables people to live a decent life. 
  Each region will mark the holiday in its own way, we do not 
have a "mandatory program," each region itself determines how to 
celebrate. In St. Petersburg, for example, a ceremonial session 
of trade union activists will be held. Moscow and many other 
cities are planning to hold rallies and processions. In the 
capital an application has been lodged and accepted: There will 
be demonstrations and rallies. People will asssemble at 
Triumfalnaya Square at 0830, the procession will start moving 
off along Tverskaya Street at 0915, and there will be a 
30-minute rally outside the History Museum on Manezh Square at 
1000. 
  A campaign to collect signatures in support of urgent trade 
union demands has been organized in Moscow in the runup to May 
Day. The main demands are the payment of wage arrears, job 
guarantees, the pursuit of a proper employment policy, and 
measures to prevent unemployment. Therefore these demands will 
either be submitted to Duma representatives directly from the 
platform or the rally will send a delegation to the president, 
the Federation Council, and the government. 
  [Baranov] Will this be the "working people's spring 
offensive"? 
  [Shmakov] "Spring offensive" is a good term, one taken from 
Western practice. Over there it is the time for concluding 
collective contracts. We do not set ourselves the goal of 
conducting seasonal work in defense of working people's rights. 
Different condition prevail here. 
  Our efforts this spring have been aimed at concluding a 
general agreement. The negotiations were tough, but an 
agreement was nevertheless signed 8 April. The main point now 
is to ensure that it is implemented. But if it is not, we will 
have to set a date for the offensive. 
  And, although the General Agreement-1994 was signed only 
recently, we have set ourselves the task of signing a similar 
Contract-1995 at the end of this year. That will be the 
offensive: Our fiscal year runs from 1 January through 31 
December, and, ideally, the General Agreement, sector 
agreements, and collective contracts would be ready by its start. 
  [Baranov] A tradition has developed of late whereby the 
country's budget is passed with a year's delay. Is the trade 
unions' activity tied in with the activity of the budgetary 
commissions of the upper chamber of parliament and the State 
Duma? 
  [Shmakov] It should be. But there is no such practice 
today. The principle, however, should be as follows: The 
General Agreement constitutes a precondition of drawing up the 
state budget. Once you have an agreement, the government and 
employers assume material undertakings, and this must inevitably 
be reflected in the budget. Otherwise you have the absurd 
situation of an agreement with no resources to implement it. 
  [Baranov] What prevented such consultations being carried 
out on time this year? 
  [Shmakov] Discussion of the budget has only just gotten 
under way, and we were unable to delay signing the agreement. 
And it is also time to accustom the government to the actual 
idea of signing general agreements. 
  [Baranov] Does FITUR have political preferences? 
  [Shmakov] Trade unions cannot withdraw from politics 
altogether -- politics permeates all our activity, but FITUR 
cannot have political goals today. The trade unions rally 
people on other grounds, first and foremost social and labor 
grounds. But we are not indifferent to the policy a particular 
government pursues, it is not all the same to us who wins the 
elections. But today we have no strong leaning toward a party. 
There is no party at present which is completely in tune with 
the trade unions' tasks. But we do support those parties and 
movements whose programs contain ideas similar to our own. And 
we have not taken off the agenda the idea of either setting up a 
party, like the Labor Party, geared toward trade unions or 
enjoying closer cooperation with an existing party which is 
ready to align itself with the trade unions. 
  [Baranov] Do the trade unions regard the Labor Party's plan 
as a "nonstarter?" 
  [Shmakov] I would not put it that way. It is on the back 
rather than the front burner. 
  [Baranov] Will the trade unions continue to transform or is 
the restructuring process over, and can results be expected? 
  [Shmakov] Experience suggests that transformation is 
necessary. The time of holding congresses is now under way in 
trade unions, and the prevailing feeling is that every trade 
union within FITUR should be more centrally organized. 
Overdemocratization of trade union life has not been beneficial. 
If we are to wage a proper struggle, rather than just go through 
the motions, centralization and control are needed. 
  [Baranov] There are now strict access and exit arrangements 
in the FITUR building. Is this the start of a strict internal 
policy? 
  [Shmakov] This is an imperative of life. We should at least 
control the situation in our own house. Commercial structures 
have moved into the building, they have their own "headaches," 
ordinary thefts occur, which did not before. This has nothing 
to do with the workers' movement. 
  [Baranov] But how in general can the workers' movement 
develop in conditions of crisis? Strikes do not intimidate 
employers.... 
  [Shmakov] Strikes suit employers down to the ground. If 
people do not report for work, that is another reason for not 
paying out wages. Therefore the modern workers' movement and 
trade unions first and foremost can only be sufficiently 
effective when organized. I will not exaggerate. There will be 
no very great accomplishments at the present stage, but certain 
successes can be seen perfectly well. Our task today is to 
direct the movement toward tackling economic problems. If the 
wage of a worker in the forestry, textile, or machine building 
industry is not paid, the root of the evil is the same, but 
there are a host of ways of tackling it. But we advocate 
resolving conflicts through negotiation. And implementation of 
accords already signed is the number one problem. We have 
learned how to draw up competent documents and learned how to 
reach agreement around the negotiating table. But we still have 
not learned how to implement what has been signed. That is 
indeed a very big common problem....

<F P=106> ["First-Hand" Interview with Lieutenant General (Reserve) </F>
Anatoliy Kuntsevich, former chairman of Russian president's 
Committee for Convention Problems of Chemical and Biological 
Weapons, by Andrey Vaganov; place and date not given: "Anatoliy 
Kuntsevich: `I Do Not Discuss Orders.' `Chemical' General's 
First Interview Since His Dismissal"] 
  [Text] The closer Russia comes to the point that the air 
force calls "the point of no-return," in this case to 
ratification of the Convention on the Prohibition of the 
Development, Production, Stockpiling, and Use of Chemical 
Weapons and on their Destruction, the more acute the squabbles 
in public and in private over this problem become. 
  One of the most important manifestations of the internal 
struggle within the top echelons of power was President 
Yeltsin's 7 April 1994 edict relieving Russian Academy of 
Sciences Academician Anatoliy Kuntsevich of his post as chairman 
of the Russian president's Committee for Convention Problems of 
Chemical and Biological Weapons. The edict contained the 
following wording -- "for a single gross breach of professional 
duty." The president's press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov 
interpreted this as follows: "The committee agreed to toxins 
being transported and stored in a major population center." 
However, it seems that, if this actually did occur, it was more 
of an excuse than the real reason. (Suffice it to say that Mr. 
Kuntsevich was ill at the time the edict was drafted). 
  The story linking Anatoliy Kuntsevich's dismissal with a 
"moral victory for the military-chemical dissident" Vil 
Mirzayanov and company is even less plausible. 
  Strangely enough, Lt. Gen. (Reserve) Kuntsevich does not 
seem 
to have suited certain structures within the Russian Defense 
Ministry. And they are not the only ones. Whatever you say 
about Anatoliy Kuntsevich, his status as a top-class 
professional and his undoubted international prestige gave him a 
many opportunities for candor. It is extremely likely that 
someone thought that the committee led by Kuntsevich was too 
"extradepartmental." Your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA was told by a 
highly-placed official from this department, who asked to remain 
anonymous, that "there are more than enough people who are 
unaware of the problem but who want to head up this 
organization. Many people are attracted by the chairmanship, 
which holds ministerial rank. Moreover, it will be easier for 
`competent' organizations to control such an incompetent person." 
  [Vaganov] The specific wording of the presidential edict 
regarding your dismissal is pretty surprising for an official of 
your rank. Do you have any comment to make? 
  [Kuntsevich] I would like to say right away that, in 
accordance with the old soldier's custom, I do not discuss 
orders from above. 
  [Vaganov] Fine. Could you tell us how much of a surprise 
this was to you? 
  [Kuntsevich] This situation can be regarded in different 
ways. I do not want to get personal. There is a Russian 
presidential edict which I am obliged to implement. 
  But I must say on the whole that the problem of chemical 
disarmament concerns very important and extremely sensitive 
aspects of our state's activity. Naturally a whole range of 
opinions arise when these matters are being decided. How can 
they be resolved so as to accord with national interests above 
all? On the other hand we have to act so that Russia does not 
"drop out" of civilized forms of communication with other states. 
  [Vaganov] How did the Committee on Convention Problems 
begin its activity? 
  [Kuntsevich] The Convention on the Prohibition of Biological 
Weapons was formulated way back in 1972. The USSR subscribed to 
it in 1975. However, no legal documents were adopted at the 
time banning the development of offensive biological programs in 
the USSR. 
  In February 1992 the Committee on Convention Problems of 
Chemical and Biological Weapons was set up under the Russian 
president, and 11 April that same year a Russian presidential 
edict appeared with the committee's direct participation aimed 
at ensuring Russia's fulfillment of international convention 
commitments in the sphere of biological weapons and banning the 
implementation in our country of any offensive biological 
programs. The committee was made responsible for supervising 
implementation of this edict's provisions. The matter was 
finalized in law. In my view, this was the committee's first 
major act, and it drew worldwide attention. 
  It was then necessary to discover forms and means of working 
that would make it possible to remove mutual suspicion and 
anxiety between Russia, the United States, Britain, and other 
countries in the sphere of biological weapons. We proposed 
carrying out a series of inspections. This approach of ours was 
put into effect in September 1992 in a tripartite -- 
Russian-U.S.-British -- joint statement, which also made 
provision for the principle of carrying out mutual inspections. 
  These inspections have gone ahead in 1993-1994. A joint 
group of U.S. and British experts and inspectors inspected four 
facilities in Russia. Russian specialists accordingly visited 
three installations in the United States and one in Britain. A 
real foundation developed for comparing our countries' 
scientific, technical, and industrial potential in this field 
with facts and figures in hand. Thus, we brought our relations 
to the point of possible quantitative juxtaposition and 
comparison. Today, a good working roundtable has formed at 
which any problems can be constructively discussed. 
  [Vaganov] And this is the moment when you, one of the people 
who set up this roundtable, are unexpectedly removed from the 
chairmanship of the Committee on Convention Problems. It looks 
as though there is a negative opinion of your work in this post. 
  [Kuntsevich] That has nothing to do with the committee's 
activity. I do not think that this decision was based on what 
you have said. The committee is not me alone. There are 57 
people working on it today. By current standards that is a 
small collective, but it comprises eminent specialists. Perhaps 
that is my main achievement -- that I succeeded in finding 
people who are professionally aware of the full complexity and 
multifaceted nature of the problems and really have an idea of 
the possible ways of resolving them without harming Russia's 
national interests and security. 
  [Vaganov] What do you think are the main difficulties facing 
Russia in the sphere of chemical disarmament? 
  [Kuntsevich] The most challenging problem is the problem of 
what is to be done with the Convention on the Prohibition of 
Chemical Weapons which Russia signed in January 1993. It 
concerns Russia's highest international and national interests. 
  No matter how my opponents reproach me for rushing to sign 
this convention, I categorically disagree with that. The 
negotiating process began back in 1980 or even earlier. 
Moreover, as for the history of this problem, Russia came to 
the negotiating table back in...1968. It was then that the 
first legal document in the field of chemical weapons appeared 
in St. Petersburg -- a declaration banning the use of poisoned 
bullets was signed. 
  [Vaganov] To return to today's events.... 
  [Kuntsevich] We are in effect talking about one thing today 
-- whether or not to ratify the convention. 
  [Vaganov] What do you predict? 
  [Kuntsevich] This is all pretty tricky. I spoke about it at 
the State Duma hearings 24 March this year. We have to square 
economic, financial, and technological potential with our 
commitments under this convention and determine the real 
priorities in disarmament. Russia's international political, 
moral, and ethical prestige is undoubtedly in the balance. 
  From the time when the committee was formed I always said 
that, for Russia to be able to join this convention, it was 
essential to create powerful international support for it, 
bearing in mind our current difficult economic and financial 
situation. This international support must undoubtedly come 
under our intellectual, scientific and technical, and 
organizational leadership. I am talking not about obtaining 
some kind of financial or technological handout but about 
creating a committed pool of support for Russia's chemical 
weapons destruction program -- which is particularly important 
during the initial phase. 
  In addition, previously my opponents tried via the mass 
media to present me as a rabid supporter of the 
military-chemical complex, dreaming of how to drag out the 
process of chemical disarmament and ridding Russia of the heavy 
military-chemical burden. However, to be fair I must say that 
of late my opponents have done a complete turnabout. They are 
now trying to persuade the public that Kuntsevich was allegedly 
in a hurry and impelled Russia to sign the Convention on the 
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. I categorically refute that 
opinion and consider it unprofessional in every respect -- from 
both the state, the political, and the general human viewpoints. 
  It is now being said that the committee chairman was 
developing pro-Western sentiments and upholding a Western line. 
But, pardon me for saying so, what strategic line should I have 
developed in the interests of my taxpayer? Would it really have 
been bad for the committee to try to obtain $6 billion in aid 
(and the preconditions for that did exist)? I can say that the 
preconditions are still there today for us to obtain almost $1 
billion in foreign aid. Can that really be bad for Russia? 
  [Vaganov] So, someone in the top ranks of the Russian 
leadership has decided that it is bad.... 
  [Kuntsevich] I do not think that this decision came from the 
top. However, there are obviously politicians and various 
currents that are trying to play this card in their own 
interests. 
  [Vaganov] Now a very tough question: Where are the chemical 
weapons to be destroyed? 
  [Kuntsevich] We have to be realistic about this: There is 
not a single component of the Federation today that would 
voluntarily accept chemical munitions for destruction on its 
territory. And few would even allow them to be transported 
across their territory. So we must design a system whereby 
these weapons will be destroyed right in the areas where they 
are stored. National unity has to be secured on this: All the 
other components of the Federation must not simply be left as 
detached observers, especially since the timeframes for the safe 
storage of chemical weapons are ebbing away before our eyes. 
  The regions must join forces with industrial and 
entrepreneurial structures and set up a system of funds. And 
corresponding concessions enshrined in legislation by the State 
Duma are needed in order for regions where chemical weapons 
destruction facilities are located to obtain the requisite 
investment. 
  [Vaganov] Following your dismissal, do you still have a real 
chance of influencing the destruction of chemical weapons? 
  [Kuntsevich] I am a chemist by profession. In the more 
specialized sense I am a specialist in the destruction of toxic 
substances. I began studying this in 1958 right after 
graduating from the Academy of Chemical Protection. I will most 
likely now return to the Russian Academy of Sciences, where 
before my committee appointment I was working mainly on the 
recycling of intermediate products and toxic substances and on 
the conversion of production facilities. 
  In particular, I will do everything in my power to implement 
the idea of creating a system of funds to support the program 
for the destruction of chemical weapons. There are many people 
who are interested in this. But they want guarantees from the 
state, they want to be sure that they are involved not in a vain 
undertaking but in an important, promising job. And there are 
elements that they find very appealing. First, involvement in 
what is effectively a global project for the destruction of 
chemical weapons. In this connection -- and this is the second 
point -- the project has strong political "protection." Any 
authority -- I mean any sensible authority -- will do its utmost 
to reinforce this political "protection." Consequently, 
guarantees of stability -- political and state -- exist that 
will ultimately not only enable Russia to meet its international 
commitments under the convention but will also make it possible 
to rid Russian citizens and all mankind of the threat of one of 
the most insidious kinds of mass-destruction weapon.

<F P=106> [From the "Test Range" program: Report over video of "top </F>
secret" Mi-28 combat helicopter] 
  [Text] [Unidentified correspondent over video of closeups 
of Mi-28 helicopter] What you see on your screens is the new 
top secret Mi-28 combat helicopter which was conceived at the 
Mil Design Bureau. This machine, which is still shrouded in 
secrecy, has already managed to acquire a nickname -- "tank 
buster." 
  [Donald Duck-type voice] Thanks for the warning. 
  [Correspondent] It does not hurt to know that, as regards 
combat equipment, the Mi-28 helicopter is without parallel in 
the world. 
  [Donald Duck-type voice] The U.S. Apache helicopter in 
comparison with ours does not do very much. 
  [Correspondent] The powerful 30-mm gun with which the Mi-28 
is fitted can turn 220 degrees and destroy armored targets over 
a distance of 3 km with ease. 
  [Donald Duck-type voice] Quite right. Don't let anyone get 
closer. Moscow is right behind us. 
  [Correspondent] In addition it would not be fair to withhold 
from potential enemies that the helicopter is equipped with top 
class Shturm and Ataka guided missiles. Ninety-nine times out 
of a hundred there is no getting away from them. In addition 
there is also a variety of other projectiles, 500-kg bombs, and 
also a device for laying mines. 
  [Donald Duck-type voice] Armed to its teeth, you might say. 
  [Correspondent] It is no accident that, in line with its 
image, the Mi-28 is listed in the British Jane's Defense Data 
reference book under the code name Havoc [in English as heard], 
which in Russian would be destroyer [razrushitel]. 
  [Donald Duck-voice] Just as well it is not the Ripper 
[potrashitel]. 
  [Correspondent] On the other hand, this top class helicopter 
is very difficult to destroy in combat. The crew is protected 
against the enemy by an armored cockpit and armored glass. 
  [Donald Duck-voice] Quite right, look after your own, let 
the others be frightened. 
  [Correspondent] Should someone nonetheless succeed in 
downing our falcons, special gear will enable them to crash-land 
from the height of a five-storey building without a parachute 
and without contracting a headache. However the greatest cause 
of joy for our enemies will be the Mi-28 helicopter's 
sensational flight performance. It appears that it can fly 
sideways, back to front, and even elegantly loop the loop. 
  [Donald Duck-type voice] Could the pilot be Nesterov's 
grandson? 
  [Correspondent] Quite possible. Who else could withstand 
loads of around three g's? 
  [Donald Duck-type voice] What does that mean? 
  [Correspondent] I have no idea, but I was told that it is 
very steep. 
  [Donald Duck-type voice] And the instruments? [as heard] 
  [Correspondent] Six. [as heard] 
  [Donald Duck-type voice] What six? [as heard] 
  [Correspondent] What instruments? [as heard]

<F P=106> [Andrey Nikolayev report under the "Admission" rubric: </F>
"Defense Ministry Will Approve Norms of Morals. Pavel Grachev 
Officially Recognizes Military Trade Union"] 
  [Text] Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev and Mikhail 
Kolchev, chairman of the Central Committee of the Independent 
Trade Union of Servicemen of the Russian Federation [ITUS], have 
signed an agreement on cooperation "in the name of reaching 
understanding" on the basis of "respect for differing opinions." 
  The trade union has been in existence for two years but 
throughout that time the Defense Ministry had not recognized it, 
thereby, to all appearances, hindering the inception of a trade 
union movement in the Armed Forces. The occasion for signing 
the agreement, according to Vladimir Piskurev, ITUS Central 
Committee deputy chairman, was provided by "optimal approaches 
to the resolution of pressing problems elaborated of late in the 
Army and the Navy." Thanks to these approaches the Defense 
Ministry and the trade union have signed an agreement under 
which both sides undertake to conduct joint work to form the 
Russian Federation Armed Forces on a professional basis. They 
have agreed to jointly solve questions connected with social 
adaptation of citizens discharged from military service, and 
with the construction of housing and training people in civilian 
specialties. Joint work of the Defense Ministry and the ITUS 
has been envisioned as opening new enterprises based on those 
being converted to civilian uses, and the creation of insurance 
guarantees and pensions for servicemen. 
  The sides have undertaken not to let the Army and the Navy 
be 
involved in political gambles, not to let sink the level of 
defense capability and social protection for servicemen and 
citizens discharged into the reserves or into retirement, nor 
for their family members. The ITUS and the Defense Ministry 
have agreed to jointly "revive the glorious traditions of 
patronage links between military and work collectives, to spread 
the spiritual traditions of the Russian Army and Navy," as well 
as to uphold "the norms of moral behavior of servicemen in 
public life."

  [Text] Public opinion believes that to rocket and space 
technology have almost incredible power to do harm, though its 
harmful effect on the environment is far smaller than that of 
some chemical recovery carbonization combines or integrated pulp 
and paper mills. Besides, Russian rockets do not destroy the 
ozone layer, unlike U.S. and French ones, which use 
powder-fuelled booster rockets. But the military-space forces 
are trying to minimize even this small risk. 
  [Begin A. Kuzin, doctor of technological sciences, 
recording] 
We have raised the question of incorporating an ecological 
element in every launch of booster rockets. This element will 
include searching for and collecting metallic fragments and 
utilizing them, as well as carrying out restorative work in 
restricted areas. [end recording] 
  [Correspondent Galkin] There will soon be nowhere in our 
country where someone wishing to sow or let cattle graze need 
fear a piece of rocket falling on his head or poisonous fuel 
pouring down on him. One can say that these problems have 
already been solved. The military ecologists are turning their 
gaze toward the next millennium, when space around the Earth 
will have to be cleared of space flight debris. 
  [Begin Kuzin recording] These might be exotic methods using 
high-energy lasers to disperse relatively small pieces of space 
flight debris. These might also be minesweeper type facilities 
in space to gather large fragments and bring them back to land. 
[end recording] 
  [Galkin] So there is every reason to believe that earth- 
dwellers can avoid a global ecological disaster, at least 
according to these sources. [video shows rockets being launched,

  [Text] Republic of Crimea -- Thirteen leaders of political 
parties registered in the Crimea have put their signatures to an 
"Accord for Revival" declaration which was adopted at a 
roundtable session. 
  The parties, which signed this charter stated their 
readiness 
for mutual accord and close cooperation with the Crimean Supreme 
Council, president, and Government in the interests of creating 
favorable conditions for extricating the Crimea from the 
political and economic crisis into which it is being thrown. 
  The declaration contains the idea of building a 
parliamentary 
presidential republic. All branches of power in it would be 
legally equal to each other, a government of national confidence 
would be formed, and equal participation in governing all the 
peoples populating the Crimea would be ensured. The document 
approves the implementation of economic reforms and the 
transformation of the Crimea into a focus for all CIS countries' 
economic and cultural interests in conditions of civil peace and 
accord. 
  All this should serve to create on Republic of Crimea 
territory a regime of open economy. The parties are also 
declaring their intention to make all their actions strictly 
commensurate with the provisions of the Crimean Constitution and 
international law. 
  The party leaders who signed the declaration also called on 
Presidents L. Kravchuk and Yu. Meshkov not to take 
ill-considered steps in their mutual relations, which could 
adversely affect people's futures.

  It was emphasized at the briefing that Japan is one of our 
country's most promising partners. The issue of developing 
bilateral cooperation was discussed at Japan's Foreign Ministry 
and International Trade and Industry Ministry. It was decided

lawyers to work out documents which would become the basis for 
relations to be enhanced.

head of a department of the Ukrainian Security Service for 
Donetsk Oblast, stated. No specific targets were named, 
  It was pointed out at a news conference in Donetsk, however,

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko and </F>
Mikhail Melnik] 
  [Text] Kiev, 3 May -- In order to forego starting up the 
second generating set at Chernobyl AES [nuclear electric power 
station] and to halt the station's first and third sets, Ukraine 
will need over $3 billion. This was stated today in an 
exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS correspondents by Ukrainian 
Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov after a working meeting 
behind closed doors between a G-7 delegation and members of the 
Ukrainian Government. 
  He announced that at least $1 billion would be required 
merely to rebuild the protective covering of the fourth 
generating set. A further $1.2 billion would be needed to 
complete the building of new reactors so as to have room to 
maneuver in the energy field. Slightly more than 1 billion would 
be required for staff training, for conversion measures, and 
also for maintaining the Chernobyl AES after mothballing. The 
Ukrainian side insists that the Chernobyl problem should be seen 
as a single package. 
  The ITAR-TASS correspondents learned that the G-7 
representatives take a different view on a number of the issues 
under discussion. Specifically, they refuse to give any help in 
the social area. Tomorrow's meeting will show whether the 
Ukrainian side is able to talk them round.

  [Text] Talks with the economic delegation from the United 
States began in Kiev today. As agreed by the sides, they are 
being conducted in four joint working groups. Their main task 
is to make more specific the directions and substance of 
Ukraine's cooperation with the United States and international 
institutions on the matter of developing a market infrastructure 
in our country. 
  Other issues are being discussed too, in particular 
special-purpose financial assistance to us on the part of the 
United States and the investment of U.S. private capital in the 
Ukrainian economy. It was confirmed at today's plenary sitting 
that the United States is allocating $150 million for three 
years to support private entrepreneurship in Ukraine. 
  A proposal to set up a permanent bilateral consultative 
group 
was also expressed. 
  Roman Shpek, minister of the economy, heads the Ukrainian 
delegation at the talks.

one-off payments for goods, work, services and securities to the 
value of more than six minimum wages that are effected by 
corporate bodies, regardless of their forms of ownership and 
kinds of activity, and by Ukrainian citizens, foreign citizens, 
and those without citizenship who carry out entrepreneurial 
activity, are to be solely non-cash. Commercial banks are to

  [Text] Kiev -- Oleksandr Moroz, people's deputy and 
chairman of the political council of the Socialist Party of 
Ukraine, made public a statement on 3 May, which notes: 
"Recently the milieu of Ukraine's president and Leonid Kravchuk 
himself have in their statements and interviews been 
importunately pressing on the public their opinion about the 
untimeliness and unconstitutionality of elections to local 
councils and pre-term elections of a president in June this 
year. The intention to appeal to the new composition of the 
Supreme Council on the matter of revoking the resolution on 
pre-term elections of a president of Ukraine and postponing 
elections to local councils to a later date is being justified. 
Predictions with regard to possible anarchy, further 
confrontation and chaos, and threats to the very existence of 
the state are being repeated as arguments in favor of this 
decision. A number of parties have taken this same stand; these 
are generally of a right-wing orientation and conduct their 
politics via the presidential structures in oblasts and rayons." 
  Oleksandr Moroz stated: "The poorly thought-out statements 
by the president about the supposed absence of a constitution in 
Ukraine and about the constitutional crisis, about the 
incompetence of the newly elected composition of Ukraine's 
Supreme Council, and so on, not only discredit him as a leader 
of the state, but also actually deepen the political crisis, 
which he is endeavoring not to allow, according to him." 
  According to the leader of the Socialist Party of Ukraine, 
the election of the new composition of Ukraine's Supreme Council 
by the people is without a doubt the decisive factor in the 
political process, the democratic development of which requires 
the speedy formation of new structures of state power in the 
center and in the localities in order to, first of all, initiate 
a set of anti-crisis measures in the economy.

<F P=106> [Olena Hubina report: "`An-24' Is Now Too Much of a Luxury"] </F>
  [Text] Nowadays, we seldom travel by air. One year ago, 
there was an extreme shortage of fuel. Today, people put it 
differently: There are no problems related to fuel; there are 
money-related problems. That is why an air ticket to Moscow 
costs between 1,200,000 and 1,400,000 karbovantsi. 
  Despite such a situation, today there are already about 70 
aviation companies operating in Ukraine. Some of them have just 
one plane, others -- just two. However, the state-owned 
"Ukrainian Airlines" company remains, undoubtedly, the largest 
one. 
  President of the air company Leonid Pohrebnyak calls it 
"aviation enterprise." It may be readily realized that, like 
the overwhelming majority of Ukrainian enterprises, it finds it 
quite difficult to become integrated into market conditions. 
For example, today, the company owns quite a sizeable fleet of 
aircraft -- seven "Il-62," 15 "Tu-154," 15 "Tu-134," and 25 
"An-24." Even though the technology functions without fail and 
with great precision, some of the aircraft will only be used 
until the year 2005. However, this technology is obsolete. 
Besides, is Ukraine capable, today, of replacing all of its old 
aircraft with new ones? For example, when flights to the United 
States were organized, at the U.S. side's demand, our planes 
were re-equipped with special technology. One such system costs 
$300,000. 
  The low fuel efficiency of the aircraft has considerably 
reduced the amount of air transportations. Today, the fuel 
price accounts for 70 percent of the ticket price. That is why 
it is difficult to compete in terms of ticket prices. It is one 
thing that Ukrainian aviation companies must coordinate prices 
with the "Ukrainian Airlines." In flights to the United States, 
Russian and Finnish companies turn out to be competitive. 
  There also exists yet another problem. The aircraft are 
mainly repaired in Russia. This means that rubles must be paid. 
Today, "Ukrainian Airlines" needs 9.6 billion rubles to be able 
to take back our repaired technology from there. 
  It is, therefore, perfectly understandable that in present 
conditions the aircraft largely make charter flights, when the 
customer pays for the flights. The "Ukrainian Airlines" 
arranges much fewer regular flights than we would like it to. 
There are regular flights to Tel Aviv, Athens, Cairo, Istanbul, 
Prague, Warsaw, Beijing, Delhi, and some other cities. At the 
same time, the flight to Toronto that was initiated on 23 April 
is on charter terms -- there is a contract for 19 flights. 
However, regular flights to Canada are being negotiated for 
1995. 
  There are also attempts to compete in terms of the quality 
of 
services. People say that, on the flight to Moscow, food is now 
served and that even wine is on the menu. Other flights abroad 
are also maintained at a proper level. 
  In summer, weekly flights to Washington and Chicago will 
open. Tickets for these flights are on sale.

  [Text] Cairo May 3 TASS -- Russia considers the PLO-Israeli 
document signing as the first major step towards comprehensive 
Mideastern settlement and historic reconciliation of Israel with 
its Arab neighbours, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev 
said in a brief statement at the Cairo airport today. 
  "We will continue doing everything to help the 
implementation 
of the agreements," he said. In his words, the PLO and Israeli 
leaders have managed to reach the agreement with the 
international support on the part of Russia and the United 
States, the co-chairmen of the peace process, as well as active 
mediating efforts of Egypt. The recent Moscow visits of the PLO 
leader Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin 
boosted the ceremony. 
  Kozyrev stressed this is not his first visit to Egypt and 
described as "friendly" the relations between Russia and Egypt. 
He said he has brought a personal message of Boris Yeltsin to 
Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak. 
  "The Russian initiative to convene the Mideastern peace 
conference of the Madrid type remains valid. Its implementation 
at a corresponding stage would enable an additional impetus to 
the whole Mideastern settlement process," Kozyrev told ITAR-TASS 
in response to a question about the prospects for the Madrid-2 
forum. 
  "We suggested this at a time when the Arab-Israeli 
negotiations faced certain difficulties. There was a need for 
initiatives to unblock the deadend. At the same time, we 
considers an agreement on the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho 
-- first treaty a priority," he said. 
  After the agreement is signed, Madrid-2 may become an 
important step towards peace, said the Russian foreign minister.

  [Text] Cairo, 3 May -- Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev, who arrived in Cairo today to attend the signing of the 
Palestine-Israel agreement, has handed a personal message from 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin to Egyptian President Husni 
Mubarak. In the message the head of the Russian state confirmed 
his invitation to H. Mubarak to visit Moscow. This visit, 
Kozyrev told journalists, can take place in the forseeable 
future. 
  Answering questions from journalists after meeting H. 
Mubarak 
at the presidential palace "Al-Ittihadia," the head of Russian 
diplomacy noted that at the meeting Russia's preparedness was 
confirmed to assist further steps along this path together with 
the United States, which co-chairs with Russia the Middle East 
peace process, and Egypt. 
  Tomorrow's signing of the Palestine-Israel document, Kozyrev 
said, "will become a good present" for President Mubarak, who is 
celebrating his birthday on Wednesday. 
  The realization of the Palestine-Israel agreement, the 
minister continued, will present the Palestinians with some 
difficult tasks in implementing autonomy. Russia is ready to 
give them all possible assistance in this. 
  Moscow also intends to contribute to progress in the 
Syrian-Israeli direction of the peace process, too. "We will 
make every effort to bring closer the positions of the sides," 
Kozyrev said. "Maybe we are on the threshold of a new peace 
process, that between Syria and Israel."

<F P=106> [Yuriy Kovalenko report: "NATO Ready To Hoist Russian Flag"] </F>
  [Text] Paris -- NATO has recently received some highly 
encouraging signals suggesting that Russia will sign the 
Partnership for Peace [PFP] agreement in the next few months, 
Sergio Silvio Balanzino, NATO deputy secretary general, has 
stated. 
  It would be premature to think that Moscow will affiliate to 
this program in May or June, the deputy secretary general noted, 
addressing the opening of the headquarters of the Partnership 
for Peace coordinating center in the Belgian city of Mons, but 
we hope that the Russian flag will fly here alongside the others 
this summer. 
  Previously this same building in Mons housed the center 
which 
directed the Live Oak military program, which was designed to 
repulse Moscow in the event that it tried to blockade West 
Berlin. It symbolized the division of Europe, U.S. General 
George Joulwan, NATO supreme allied commander Europe, stressed 
at the ceremony, but in the future it will be a symbol of the 
new NATO and the new Europe. 
  It seems that the Russian Government, the NATO deputy 
secretary general noted, is now unanimous over the need to 
affiliate to Partnership for Peace, which 14 East European 
countries have joined. 
  It seems that NATO regards the participation of General 
Vladimir Zhurbenko, deputy chief of the Russian General Staff, 
in the NATO military planning committee session in Brussels as 
one of these signals: Among other things that session examined 
questions of cooperation with the East. 
  In the weeks ahead, military men from the East European 
states will begin preparing for joint exercises in Mons and 
participation in peacekeeping operations and other NATO events. 
The first maneuvers within the Partnership for Peace program 
will be held this summer.

  [Text] A conference of NATO's defense ministers and 
ministers of defense of the former Warsaw Pact alliance will be 
held in Brussels at the end of May. The conference will examine 
the issues of NATO's Partnership for Peace program. Anatoliy 
Potapov now comments on Russia's attitude to the program. 
  Lately many politicians from the NATO member countries have 
turned their attention to Russia's delay in joining the NATO 
Partnership for Peace program. Sometimes some of them even 
allow themselves to come to such a conclusion that Russia is 
after all not going to join the NATO program. 
  Now let us examine the real issues at stake. It should be 
remembered that there is a single document that must be signed 
by each state that has embraced NATO's program. This is the 
first stage of joining the program. Moscow has no fundamental 
disagreements with this single document that spells out in 
general terms NATO's Partnership for Peace program. 
  Even though Russian experts have on several occasions 
pointed 
to the document's nebulous character and its perfunctoriness, 
this is of course a general declaration of intentions. It is 
the second stage of the program that is very important: the 
handing over of a so-called presentation document to NATO. 
  In this document it is written in black and white what 
exactly each country expects from the program and what 
contributions are expected from each state -- that is, the 
rights and obligations of member states of the NATO's 
partnership program. 
  Moscow believes that the first stage -- the signing of the 
single document -- is a mere formality that represents no 
binding obligation. The crux and the concrete content of the 
partnership program is embedded in the second stage. The 
planned partnership and the scope and scale of the proposed 
agreement are clearly spelled out in this second document. 
  Experts in Moscow are now working on this second document to 
determine clearly all the aspects of the partnership program in 
order to make it abundantly clear to Russia and to NATO. Russia 
may sign the little, single document -- that is, the first 
stage. It may similarly propose in its place a more capacious 
and concrete agreement. The most important thing is that Moscow 
is not moving or shying away from the NATO program, but on the 
contrary would want to establish a solid base for its signing. 
  In preparing the draft of such an agreement, Russia hopes to 
consult NATO. This, of course, will take time, but then the 
working program of the partnership would be harmonized in 
reality and would be very solid. 
  Why is Russia now giving such minute and detailed attention 
to the hammering out of the draft of the future agreement? 
Because it should contain certain Russian-specific points, 
certain Russian interests. It should be noted that no other 
European country invited to join the program possesses such huge 
and powerful nuclear weapons as Russia. Neither [as heard] of 
them has the same weight and influence in the world arena like 
Russia does, and none of them has the same geopolitical 
peculiarities as Russia. That's why Moscow would want these 
basic conditions and peculiarities taken into account in 
planning the partnership program. 
  Therefore, it is not the formal time of joining the NATO's 
partnership program which matters. The issue is that the 
partnership between Russia and NATO should be real: equal in 
reality and in the interests of a stable and permanent European 
security.

Minister Yi Pyong-tae and his Russian counterpart Pavel Grachev 
have agreed to exchange information on Pyongyang's nuclear 
weapons program in a joint effort to check a major threat to 
world peace, sources at the South Korean Embassy here said 
Wednesday. 
  During Yi's meeting with Grachev Saturday, the two ministers

maintain peace in Northeast Asia and on the Korean peninsula, a 
senior official said. 
  The agreement should help Seoul gauge the progress of 
Pyongyang's nuclear arms development program, he noted.

  [Text] Seoul May 4 -- South Korean President Kim Yong-sam 
will come to the Russian Federation on a four-day official visit 
between June 1 and 4 at the invitation of President Boris 
Yeltsin as well as to Uzbekistan on a three-day visit at the 
invitation of President Islam Karimov, the spokesman of the 
president's office said at a briefing in Seoul on Wednesday. 
  According to the spokesman, the South Korean president will 
visit the Russian port city of Vladivostok on his way back home. 
  Kim plans to hold talks with Yeltsin during the visit, at 
which the sides will exchange opinions on the situation on the 
Korean peninsula and the situation in the world as a whole. 
They will also discuss ways of strengthening bilateral 
relations. 
  "The visit by President Kim Yong-sam to Russia will help to 
strengthen further relations between the two countries for the 
sake of preserving peace on the Korean peninsula and will step 
up bilateral cooperation in joint development of natural 
resources and technological development for the sake of mutual 
prosperity of the two countries," stressed the spokesman. 
  He added that "the coming visit will have great importance 
for building the foundations of foreign policy by which the 
Korean civil government abides, focusing on the development of 
relations with the four neighbouring powers". 
  In accordance with this diplomacy, Kim visited the United 
States last November as well as Japan and China last March. He 
will go to Russia this time. 
  In June 1989, Kim was in Moscow as the leader of the 
opposition Democratic Party for Reunification. He met Yeltsin 
in Seoul in the capacity of a candidate for the highest state 
post from the ruling Democratic Liberal Party during the Russian 
president's visit to South Korea in November 1992. 
  Presidents Kim and Karimov will discuss chances for 
developing relations between the two countries. Incidentally, 
the largest community of Koreans in the countries of the 
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) lives in Uzbekistan. 
  The South Korean-Uzbek summit "will help to establish 
relations in the economic and other spheres also with other CIS 
members which recently gained independence", the spokesman noted.

<F P=106> [Natalya Kalashnikova report: "Trade Partnership With the </F>
EC Depends on `Political Will'"] 
  [Text] The consultations between Deputy Prime Minister 
Aleksandr Shokhin and Sir Leon Britten, deputy chief of the 
European Commission, which were held 2 May in Moscow effectively 
marked an end to a nearly two-year-long marathon of negotiating 
a partnership and cooperation accord between Russia and the EC. 
Solutions to the most contentious problem -- the Russian export 
of nuclear-cycle goods -- were finally found during the meeting. 
Mr. Shokhin pointed out that "if the political will is 
present," the agreement may now be initialed by the end of 
Greece's chairmanship in the EC (it expires at the end of June). 
For the time being experts will have to "weigh the balance of 
interests set forth in the agreement" yet another time -- there 
will be no more high-level talks. 
  A solution on the export of nuclear-cycle goods, including 
uranium -- an apple of discord in the talks -- was reached 
thanks to mutual concessions. Initially, the EC was not 
inclined at all to accept Russia's proposal on including this 
subject in the draft agreement on partnership. During the 
Moscow meeting a compromise was reached. According to Mr. 
Shokhin, the two sides decided that, first, a special agreement 
on trade in nuclear-cycle goods be worked out; and, second, that 
this matter be presently included in Article 20 of the draft 
agreement on partnership, citing, however, an existing agreement 
from 1989 with the EC. Among other things, the agreement calls 
for preliminary consultations to be held before quantitative 
limitations are imposed; the competence of Euratom to be 
recognized when solving trade issues; and a pledge by the sides 
"to take into account the situation on the market" (export 
volumes were not specified). In order to clarify their stances, 
the sides agreed to exchange corresponding letters. 
  The results of the Moscow meeting and talks on the 
partnership agreement in general must be considered by the EC 
Council 16 May. Mr. Shokhin pointed out that "there is hope" 
that this matter will be finally resolved because both side show 
their interest in it; he added, however, that now everything 
depends on "political will," otherwise the process may be 
delayed. As a matter of fact, the European parliament passed a 
resolution the other day that links the conclusion of the 
agreement to the withdrawal of Russian troops from the Baltic 
states, even though it is only recommendatory in nature (then 
again, the parliament itself is bracing for an election). 
  The Moscow talks focused not only on the partnership accord. 
Mr. Shokhin and Sir Leon also signed a memorandum on setting up 
a working group to look into the possibilities of attracting 
foreign investment in Russia. According to Oleg Preksin, 
Russian member of the EBRD board of directors, who also joined 
the group, it will have to present the results of its work (a 
report) to the European Commission by 28 June. One of the key 
projects of the Russian side will be the creation of the 
Multilateral Agency to Guarantee Investment in Russia (MAGIR). 
That is to say, a multilateral fund involving both Russia and 
Western countries is to be set up abroad to insure investment 
against noncommercial risks (details of the project have yet to 
be clarified). This matter may be considered at the G-7's 
summer summit in Naples.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Mineyev] </F>
  [Text] Brussels May 3 TASS -- Press secretary of deputy 
head of the commission of the European Union Leon Brittan 
described Brittan's Moscow negotiations as remarkable progress. 
  He told a briefing at the commission today the negotiations 
with Russian Vice-Premier Aleksandr Shokhin aimed to sign the 
long-awaited agreement on partnership and cooperation between 
the European Union and Russia. 
  Although the sides have not finalized all the problems, the 
commission is optimistic about the agreement conclusion and 
contacts with the Russian vice-premier will be continued on 
telefax and over the telephone. 
  In the words of the press secretary, the sides reached good 
progress in the sphere of nuclear material trade, which is the 
main of the three problems in the agreement. The rest two -- on 
sea transport and activities of European banks in Russia -- will 
be settled as soon as the first problem is eliminated, he noted. 
  It is the matter of a compromise between some members of the 
European Union, including France, which fear the inflow into the 
European market of a large amount of cheap nuclear materials, 
and Russia, who wants to include nuclear material trade in the 
agreement alongside the trade of other goods, that is without 
discrimination. The Russian proposal to specify this problem 
with letters is being discussed. 
  After specific aspects of the draft document are finalized 
with Russia, the commission will pass it over to governments of 
the European Union member-states for consultations.

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Quintero de Leon] </F>
  [Text] After six years of negotiations that began with the 
military government of Panama, the Republic of Panama yesterday 
formally established diplomatic relations with the Russian 
Federation in a ceremony attended by Panamanian Foreign Minister 
Jose Raul Mulino and his Russian counterpart, Andrey Kozyrev, in 
Moscow. 
  The Panamanian Foreign Ministry disclosed that the two 
ministers signed an agreement called the "Declaration of 
Principles of Relations and Cooperation Between the Russian 
Federation and the Republic of Panama." The essence of the 
agreement is the expansion of the respective countries' consular 
missions to the level of embassies. 
  Consular relations began in 1991 when President Guillermo 
Endara and President Boris Yeltsin decided to establish 
consulates to handle trade relations and cooperation between the 
two countries. 
  A Foreign Ministry bulletin reports Foreign Minister Kozyrev 
said that the Russian Federation considers Panama a future 
economic and financial power, and that he wants to strengthen 
trade relations. 
  In addition, Minister Mulino offered Panama's cooperation on 
banking issues, the Free Trade Zone, the reinsurance system, and 
on "maintaining constant consultation on Latin American 
geopolitical issues."

  [Text] Moscow May 4 TASS -- "The Russian State Duma regards 
the ratification of the convention on Black Sea regional 
cooperation in the sphere of culture, education, science, and 
information as a task of primary state importance," vice-speaker 
of the lower chamber of the Russian parliament Valentin Kovalev 
said here today, opening the second meeting of the committee for 
culture, education and social activities of the parliamentary 
assembly on Black Sea economic cooperation. As earlier 
reported, the committee's first meeting was held in Istanbul 
last November. It decided to include the question of the 
convention's ratification in the agenda of its second meeting. 
  Kovalev said that Russia was already taking concrete steps 
to 
implement the provisions of this document. A special 
organisation -- the Russian centre for cultural relations with 
countries of the Black Sea region -- has already been set up. A 
festival of arts of the Black Sea basin countries will be held 
in Sochi this October. Eleven of these countries, including 
Russia, are members of the parliamentary assembly on the Black 
Sea economic cooperation.

<F P=106> [Olga Garbuzova report: "Amendments to State of Emergency </F>
Law. Deputies Hasten To Take President Under Control"] 
  [Text] Further work on the draft law "On the State of 
Emergency" started yesterday in two State Duma committees -- on 
security and on legislation. The final version of the draft law 
should be ready and put before the lower chamber of parliament 
before 15 May. 
  At the moment, there are two variants of the law "On the 
State of Emergency." Distinctions between the two (the first 
one was proposed by Deputy Viktor Mironov and dubbed the 
"Internal Affairs Ministry variant;" the second one is known as 
the "committees' variant) are not so great, neither do they 
differ much from the RSFSR law "On the State of Emergency" 
signed by Boris Yeltsin on 17 May 1991. There is, however, one 
important distinction, but it is provided for in the Russian 
Constitution: Whereas in the past a state of emergency could be 
imposed both by an edict of the president of Russia (with 
consent from the Supreme Soviet) and by an edict of the Supreme 
Soviet presidium (with an immediate notification of the 
president), now, in line with the Constitution, a state of 
emergency shall be imposed only by the president's edict. This 
edict shall subsequently be approved by the Federation Council. 
  The "Internal Affairs Ministry variant" defines in more 
clear 
terms the forces and means brought into play to make a state of 
emergency hold. First and foremost these are territorial 
internal affairs organs and armed forces stationed on that 
territory. It is also supposed that the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs and the Federal Counterintelligence Service shall, on 
the president's decision, be in charge of bringing in additional 
forces without having to agree this with the federation 
components' organs of power. Army units from other regions can 
be introduced in exceptional cases and on the president's 
decision alone. 
  In the parliamentary committees they are more worried over 
how to monitor the observance of laws during a state of 
emergency. Article 37 of the draft law says that the Federation 
Council and the commission to be formed by it shall, throughout 
the period the state of emergency is in effect, monitor the 
observance of laws and conduct inspections of corresponding 
territories. 
  As regards the circumstances and the list of measures to be 
applied under a state of emergency, they are virtually the same 
as in the 1991 law. The grounds for imposing a state of 
emergency are divided into two groups. The first includes 
attempts to change the constitutional system, mass disturbances 
accompanied by violence, and interethnic conflicts. The second 
one includes natural disasters, epidemics, and major accidents. 
Like in the previous law, a state of emergency cannot be in 
effect for more than 30 days if it is imposed over the entire 
territory of Russia, and more than 60 days if imposed over part 
of the country's territory. 
  There are no serious differences in the drafts. Why such a 
hurry to pass the new law? Members of the committees must fear 
that now that the former law is only partially effective, there 
may arise a situation where a state of emergency is imposed 
without sufficient legal grounds and parliament would be able 
neither to prevent its imposition nor exercise control over the 
observance of law on the territory affected by the state of 
emergency.

  "Kyrgyzstan is a close neighbour of Tajikistan, and it

  The statement reaffirmed the invariability of Bishkek policy 
on Tajikistan which is based on non-interference in internal 
affairs of the sovereign state, development of bilateral 
relations in accordance with universally recognized 
international norms, the U.N. Charter and Kyrgyz obligations as 
a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States.

  [Text] Bishkek 4 May TASS -- Working groups of the 
Commonwealth Inter-Parliamentary Assembly met in the capital of 
Kyrgyzia [Kyrgyzstan] today to discuss the Nagorno-Karabakh 
problems and look for ways of settling the crisis. 
  The meeting was opened by President Askar Akayev of 
Kyrgyzia. 
In his opening address the president expressed the desire to 
see the meeting make "the first step towards the peaceful 
settlement of the Karabakh conflict." 
  Taking part in the forum are Chairman of the Board of the 
Inter- Parliamentary Assembly Vladimir Shumeyko, Speaker of the 
Parliament of Kyrgyzstan [as received] Afiyaddin Dzhalilov, 
Armenian Parliament Chairman Babken Araktsyan, representatives 
of Nagorno-Karabakh lead by Karen Baburyan. Roger Janson of 
Finland is attending as an observer. 
  On the eve of the meeting Vladimir Shumeyko told journalists 
that he was attaching great significance to negotiations on the 
Karabakh problem. It is impermissible for two countries both of 
which are members of the Commonwealth to wage war against each 
other, he said. Recently Azerbaijan agreed to recognise 
Nagorno-Karabakh as a party to the conflict, which marked a 
considerable shift, which increases chances of success. 
  Afiyaddin Dzhalilov said before leaving Baku for Bishkek 
that 
the Azeri side regards the meeting in the Kyrgyz capital as an 
important step along the path of settling the conflict. 
  Along with this he declared that the Commonwealth 
member-states "must at last recognise that Armenia's actions are 
aggressive and express due political evaluation thereof."

  [Text] A resolution issued at a rally of representatives 
of trade unions and working collectives in the city of Grodno 
and Grodno Rayon, sounded like a serious warning to the 
Belarusian Government and Supreme Soviet. Given the 
exacerbation of the economic crisis, they demand that urgent, 
practical measures -- aimed at stabilizing the national economy 
and relations in the social sector, ensuring a decrease in 
retail prices, the liquidation of crime and corruption, and the 
termination of the illegal redistribution of state property -- 
be undertaken. There are many reasons for this to be done. 
There is a big gap between the consumer basket and actual wages.

<F P=106> [Article by People's Deputy Vladimir Novik: "What Is </F>
Waiting for Us After Unification of Belarusian and Russian 
Monetary Systems?"] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Currently, virtually no one in 
Belarus is arguing with the V. Kebich team on the absurdity of 
his intentions to implement the so-called unification of 
monetary systems of Belarus and Russia. This is useless. Even 
the Constitution, which was adopted by the Supreme Soviet, 
cannot stop him. A bankrupt, procommunist Belarusian 
Government, due to its inability to manage an independent state, 
is making attempts to remain in power by undertaking unusual 
methods -- abolishing the state itself. Comrade Kebich has 
recently stated that he is being nominated as a candidate for 
president only because he is taking into account the wishes of 
those who bet on him. It is not difficult to guess who had bet 
on him. Most likely, they are the people who are scared of 
"sorting things out" if new, principally honest people, who are 
able to pull the Republic out of the crisis, come to power. 
  When the Belarusian statehood is mentioned, the current 
Belarusian Government -- represented by former 
bolsheviks-Leninists -- has rather a complex of state 
inferiority than a feeling of national pride and responsibility 
for the destiny of the governed state. At the same time, the 
Russian Government is working out its strategy for incorporating 
a sovereign state without the use of force (for example, through 
the so-called monetary merger) aimed at further widening this 
experiment to other CIS states and not only them. In addition, 
it does not conceal its imperialist intentions to restore the 
Russian empire and does it professionally and with a great deal 
of responsibility. However, hardly anyone from the parties, who 
is interested in this experiment, can predict the developments 
in these states. At the same time, these developments cannot be 
so harmless. 
  At the same time, the adversaries of the so-called money 
merger -- we have to note that there are many of them both in 
Belarus and Russia -- begin to analyze the economic and 
political consequences of this unification. Let us, esteemed 
readers, discuss one of the proposed prospects for the 
development of the economic situation in Belarus over the 
postunification period, if the unification is really carried out. 
  Saying nothing about the controversial clauses of the 
monetary merger agreement, which -- it has been repeatedly 
written and spoken about -- contradicts the new Belarusian 
Constitution, adopted on 15 March, in many details, we can 
assume that the unification of monetary systems will be 
implemented on "x-day" and, according to the agreement between 
the Russian and Belarusian Governments, Belarus will receive a 
certain sum of Russian rubles in cash and a recalculation of 
noncash Belarusian rubles to Russian ones on the basis of the 
agreed course be carried out. As a matter of fact, the money 
received should be sufficient to provide for a turnover of goods 
on the domestic market. So, what will happen after the "x-day"? 
  Most likely, after a certain amount of money is allocated, 
the flow of goods from other CIS states, first and foremost from 
Russia, will go to Belarus because Belarusian prices and wages 
will be higher over a certain period of time. Money from 
Belarus will flow away, goods will "be eaten away," and the 
deficit of payment means will grow. Belarus will require a new 
portion of money to provide for the domestic turnover of goods, 
and purchases of goods and raw materials in Russia. 
  To settle old debts and obtain new Russian credits, the 
Belarusian Government will have to sell for a song or 
hypothecate a controlling interest in such highly profitable and 
costly enterprises like "Beltranshaz" (what it has already 
done), the Belarusian metallurgical factory or the biggest oil 
and chemistry enterprises which had already attracted the 
attention of the Russian financial oligarchy and their lobby in 
the Russian Government circles. 
  To create economic obstacles, Russia will want to 
financially 
isolate Belarus in the so-called ruble zone of a new type. 
There are many mechanisms for doing this. For example, Russia 
can complicate the transfer of payments from Belarus to Russia; 
it can establish a situation whereby Belarusian noncash money 
has no status and is not recognized by other states, primarily, 
by CIS partners. This will virtually repeat the 1992 scheme, 
when the Central Bank of Russia, according to Yeltsin's edict 
from 21 June 1992 "On Measures To Protect Russian Monetary 
System," effective 1 July 1992, began to keep accounts with 
Belarus through a single corresponding account of the Belarusian 
National Bank and the Central Bank of Russia. 
  The experience of 1992-93 showed that such measures could 
bring about a situation whereby Belarusian enterprises will not 
be able to independently buy raw materials and many essentials 
for its industry products and resources abroad, first and 
foremost, in Russia, and will be forced to exchange them for 
Belarusian products sold abroad on a barter basis for 
convertible currency or Russian rubles. Due to this, the state 
budget will suffer greatly and inflation will grow. To service 
the domestic goods turnover and protect the consumer market, 
Belarus will be forced to introduce -- parallel with the Russian 
rubles -- new, or, maybe, old Belarusian "hares." 
  Then Russia could "slightly" liberalize its domestic prices 
and wages and forget to simultaneously satisfy Belarusian needs 
in cash and noncash money. This, in turn, will exacerbate the 
problem of a lack of cash and noncash money in the accounts of 
Belarusian enterprises. In this case, Belarus will have to 
trade its products to every swindler coming from Russia for cash 
to be able to pay wages to its workers. 
  Further, Russia can introduce such effective measures as 
economic pressure on Belarus, including customs duties, 
licenses, quotas, and other mechanisms, which will be imposed by 
Russia without any agreement with Belarus. The main goal of 
such measures is to enhance economic difficulties, lower the 
competitiveness of Belarusian goods, primarily on the Russian 
market with which Belarus is closely connected -- and Russia 
does not want to leave Belarus out of its scope of interests. 
Of course, all these measures will enhance the economic 
dependence of Belarus on Russia, in which Russia is strongly 
interested. 
  Thereby, this is a vicious cycle. As a result of the 
so-called unification of monetary systems, Belarus will find 
itself in complete financial isolation and will be forever 
connected with Russia. After that, Russian governmental 
strategists, rich financial corporations, industrial groups and 
organisms will begin dividing the national wealth of Belarus. 
This process will be carried out according to the following 
scheme. 
  The debts of Belarusian enterprises will be bought by big 
Russian banks or financial companies which control the 
deliveries of strategic goods and energy resources to Belarus. 
The Russian Government, through a specially set up network of 
economic difficulties (pricing, customs, export and import 
mechanisms), will set up tough conditions, owing to which all 
monetary and material resources will be withdrawn from Belarus. 
To survive, Belarus will make attempts to find foreign 
creditors but will be refused because virtually all foreign 
loans will be directed at the repayment of Russian debts and 
Belarus will not be able to persuade anyone that it will be able 
to repay its debts. Russia will also block these attempts 
because it does not need Belarus burdened with huge foreign 
debts. 
  After that, Russia will toughly demand that Belarus begin 
urgently repaying its debts. Since that there will be nothing 
to pay with, controlling interests of Belarusian enterprises 
will be handed over to the Russian state or Russian financial 
corporations. 
  The issuing of vouchers in Russia will be over by 30 June 
1994, and effective 1 July, privatization for money will begin. 
As for Belarus, the distribution of vouchers will begin only on 
1 July 1994. Is this being done by chance or not? In my 
opinion, this is a well-planned action by the Russian special 
services which are actively working within the Belarusian 
Government and the legislature. It is more profitable for 
Russia to acquire Belarusian enterprises for a song when they 
are still state property. This will require only Kebich's 
signature while after privatization they will require the 
shareholders' consent which will not be easy to obtain. 
  Thereby, after the unification of Russian and Belarusian 
monetary systems, Belarus will lose its highly profitable 
enterprises, its unprofitable enterprises will go bankrupt, and 
the standard of life of the population will sharply decrease. A 
complete loss of economic independence will be the consequence 
of the monetary merger. After this, political annexation will 
follow. All the Belarusian population will hardly agree to 
this. A new stage of the fight for the restoration of 
independence of Belarus will be launched. So, is it necessary 
to first lose freedom to assess its value later? 
  The last point. Why is the Belarusian Government so 
stubbornly pushing Belarus to the so-called monetary merger? 
There are many speculations on this issue. In my opinion, the 
key reason is a chance to remove the responsibility for economic 
collapse and keep power in their hands. They count on the 
presidential elections because a president will receive 
unprecedented powers to form executive bodies. It is no 
accident that Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin was so slow 
with signing the monetary merger agreement. He waited for the 
establishment of the date of the presidential elections in 
Belarus. Presidential elections should be held at the moment 
when Russian money -- acting hypnotically on Belarusian voters 
-- is transferred to the Belarusian economy. Russia requires a 
puppet president in Belarus who will dance to the Russian tune. 
Comrade Kebich suits Russia. If Judas betrayed Jesus Christ for 
silver, Kebich would sell Belarus for banknotes with the Kremlin 
printed on them. As I have already mentioned, Belarusian voters 
will sober up soon. But the power will be in the hands of those 
familiar to us -- people for whom personal interests are more 
important than the interests of their state and people. It is 
high time that the Belarusian Government stop carrying out its 
experiments with setting up an independent state without its own 
currency because this will not lead to anything good. 
  To whom is the lack of Belarusian money and credit policy 
profitable? Let us recall how last February the Presidium of 
the Supreme Soviet exceeded its constitutional powers and issued 
trillions [currency not specified] in credit line to the 
agricultural-industrial complex under the Cabinet of Ministers' 
pressure. The National Bank took this money out of the air and 
earmarked it to the Cabinet of Ministers. But does anyone 
control the purposeful use of this uncovered money? If there is 
no control, this money could be quickly poured into trusted 
commercial companies. For example, these companies could be 
issued short-term credit lines from these purposeful funds. 
These companies could buy convertible currency, sell it 
immediately after the total fall in the exchange rate of the 
Belarusian "hare," and profit from the difference of the 
exchange rate. After that, the issued loan, which is uncovered 
and devalued, could be granted to the agricultural sector. Do 
people who deal with this kind of business need a rigid 
independent money and credit policy? The answer is unequivocal. 
No! The analysis of the roll-call vote on the issue of the 
Belarusian money and credit policy in the Belarusian legislature 
demonstrates that the deputies, who occupy the top positions in 
the state administration, do not want the order installed in the 
money and credit sphere. First and foremost, these are Prime 
Minister V. Kebich, Supreme Soviet Chairman M. Hryb, his 
deputies, chairmen of oblast executive committees, and their 
followers. 
  I would like to address my colleagues in the legislature, 
who 
are not indifferent to the destiny of the Belarusian state, to 
weigh and sort out all the consequences of the so-called 
monetary Russian-Belarusian merger before ratifying this 
agreement and introducing changes to the new Constitution. 
There are many mechanisms, which could provide for financial 
integration with the CIS on equal terms, without being swallowed 
by another state. My colleagues from other states-partners and 
we should look for and introduce these measures in legislative 
acts. The government should observe the legislative acts, 
especially that of the Constitution adopted by the Supreme 
Soviet. Otherwise, it should drop its office.
