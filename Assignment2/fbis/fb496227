  [Text] The Russian Foreign Affairs Ministry has not yet had 
any consultations with the U.S. State Department about the 
possibility of swapping Aldrich Ames for one of the American 
spies detained in the territory of the Russian Federation. This 
was said today by Grigoriy Karasin, the director of the Russian 
Foreign Ministry's Press and Information Department. According 
to him this issue should, first and foremost, be settled among 
themselves by the leaders of the two states' special services.

  [Text] The leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia 
(LDPR), Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, today met the chairman of 
International Swords Into Plowshares, Jeffry M. Ault. 
  A statement by the LDPR parliamentary faction press office 
described the above-mentioned organization as "widely known in 
the U.S.A. and having much clout." The press office also 
referred to Ault as saying that a number of congressmen and 
senators had asked him to meet Zhirinovskiy. 
  The statement quoted Ault as saying: "Not everyone in 
America believes what our newspapers write about you." In his 
opinion, very important events are happening in Russia and 
politicians of other countries have to obtain adequate 
information at first hand. 
  Zhirinovskiy said his position with respect to the U.S.A. 
was 
constantly misrepresented as open anti-Americanism. On the 
contrary, he supports stable and, first of all, fair relations 
between two great powers, according to the press office. 
  Ault offered Zhirinovskiy his help in establishing contacts 
with American politicians and businessmen. 
  Zhirinovskiy asked Ault to tell everyone in the U.S.A. that 
the LDPR had supported peace and never called for war in any 
region of the world, the press office said.

  [Text] Moscow, 6 May (ITAR-TASS) -- Russia has not taken 
and does not intend to take any unilateral steps in transferring 
the Black Sea Fleet's air wing from the Crimea. "We will not 
engage in hooliganism, nor do we intend to capture anyone," said 
[Defense Minister] Pavel Grachev, replying to an ITAR-TASS 
correspondent's question on a Ukrainian Defense Ministry 
statement about alleged Russian plans to seize 20 Tu-22 military 
aircraft during the forthcoming Black Sea Fleet exercises. 
  Regarding the state of affairs on the division of the Black 
Sea Fleet, the minister noted that Russian and Ukrainian groups 
of experts are currently at work. Their findings on this 
question will be examined at the second round of talks on the 
future of the Black Sea Fleet. At the same time Grachev stated 
that the Russian version will scarcely differ substantially from 
the one it proposed at the talks in Sevastopol between the 
Russian and Ukrainian defense ministers. "It has been endorsed 
by the Russian president and reflected in five previous 
agreements signed by the presidents of the Ukraine and Russia," 
Pavel Grachev said.

  [Text] Moscow May 5 TASS -- "The accusations have nothing 
in common with reality; such actions were not planned", stated 
the press-centre of Russia's Black Sea Fleet on Thursday. The 
naval representative was reacting to a declaration issued by the 
Ukrainian Defence Ministry that the Russians had "plans to seize 
at least 20 Tu-22 military aircraft during the Black Sea Fleet's 
upcoming military maneuvers". 
  The press-centre representative told ITAR-TASS that the 
Ukrainian assertion that "pilots of the Black Sea Fleet based in 
the Crimea received orders to land the rocket-carrying aircraft 
at the military base of Krymsk in southern Russia" cannot stand 
up to criticism if only for techical reasons. All pilots, 
including Ukrainian ones, know that the airfield in question 
cannot handle such planes, the representative said. 
  The naval press centre is sure that, upon carefully reading 
through the Ukrainian Defence Ministry's statement, one can 
conclude that Kiev is hastily making public unchecked 
information to confuse the public. This, unfortunately, is not 
the first time such things have been done, the representative 
noted.

  [Text] Moscow May 5 TASS -- It would be most logical if the 
resolution of the Black Sea Fleet question was transferred to 
the Crimea and Russia, according to Crimean President Yuriy 
Meshkov. 
  The stationing of the fleet and the questions connected with 
its supplies and social benefits for the military personnel are 
all problems which the Crimean Republic must solve, he announced 
in Moscow, where he arrived for the signing of an agreement 
between the Crimean and Russian Governments on trade, economic, 
and cultural cooperation. 
  Meshkov said that Ukrainian Defence Minister Vitaliy 
Radetskyy's refusal to allow Crimean representatives to have 
equal representation at the Sevastopol negotiations on the Black 
Sea Fleet was "inadequate".

  [Text] Moscow May 5 TASS--An agreement on trade, economic 
and cultural cooperation between the Moscow and Crimean 
governments was signed here on Thursday by Moscow Mayor Yuriy 
Luzhkov and visiting Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov. 
  The agreement provides for concluding direct contracts on 
mutually beneficial terms, for creating joint ventures in 
various economic spheres to make, store and process agricultural 
products, for organizing recreation and medical treatment in 
health resorts and rest centres. The two sides plan to set up 
in prospect a Moscow-Crimean trade house and a foundation for 
revival of Crimea's economic and cultural ties. The document 
also envisages exchange of experience in privatization, 
anti-monopoly tax policy and fighting crime. 
  Luzhkov described the signed agreement as an action of not 
only economic, but also political cooperation. "Crimea has 
always been inseparable from Russia, it is poured generously 
with Russian blood. Crimea and Russia are an integral whole", 
the Moscow mayor said. 
  He expressed confidence that the agreement would enable a 
lot 
of Russians to have a good rest in Crimean resorts and rest 
homes, as well as replenish Moscow shops with fruit, vegetables 
and wine. 
  The Crimean president also highly assessed the accord as 
based on good relations between Russians and Crimeans. 
According to him, the signed document "will make it possible to 
extend our liking and bent for each other to the economic 
sphere". 
  Meshkov promised that Moscovites wishing to spend their 
summer vacation on the Crimean peninsula would have a carefree 
rest. "Crimea is waiting for Moscovites. It is calm and warm 
there. The sea, sun and Massandra wine cellars are at your 
disposal", the Crimean president said.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Reports by </F>
diplomatic correspondents Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and 
others] 
  [Text] Head of the Russian Foreign Ministry Andrey Kozyrev 
expressed hope that the meeting between Foreign Ministers of 
Russian Federation, United States, European Union, and United 
Nations on settlement of the Bosnian conflict would be held on 
May 13 in Geneva. On Thursday day, during a short stop in 
Moscow on his way from Cairo to St. Petersburg he reported that 
two dates had been preliminary discussed by the parties. 
"Moscow is in favor of an earlier date (May 13) in order to 
prevent escalation of hostilities in Bosnia," said Kozyrev. 
  He underlined that achievement of an agreement on cessation 
of hostilities in Bosnia and deployment of UN forces between the 
parties involved in this conflict is the major issue of the 
agenda. 
  Speaking about the situation in the Middle East after the 
signing of the Palestinian-Israeli agreements on Gaza Strip and 
Jericho Wednesday in Cairo, Kozyrev noted that on the one hand, 
Moscow intends to assist in implementation and development of 
these agreements, and, on the other hand, it wants to assist in 
establishing a Syrian-Israeli dialogue. 
  Meanwhile, during his conversation with our Interfax 
correspondent a Russian diplomat in Cairo, who preferred to stay 
anonymous, expressed his opinion that a breakthrough on the 
Syrian-Israeli direction can be reached by means of "a quiet 
diplomacy" and, probably, on a bilateral ground as it was during 
the dialogue between Israel and the PLO. 
  At the conference to be held in Geneva on May 13 the heads 
of 
Russian and American diplomacies, the European Union and the 
U.N. will address the warring sides in Bosnia with a joint 
appeal to sign an agreement to cease hostile actions and start 
drafting a document on a comprehensive solution to the conflict. 
Interfax learned this on Thursday from a senior Russian 
diplomat. 
  According to him, a contact group, which includes experts 
from Russia (Interfax's note: Russia is represented there by a 
high- ranking member of its Foreign Ministry, Aleksey 
Nikiforov), the USA, Britain, France, Germany, the European 
Union and the U.N., has been instructed to finalize a draft 
agreement on ceasing hostile actions. "The document has to be a 
compromise and take into account the wishes of both warring 
sides. With this aim in view the contact group is cruising 
between Pale and Sarajevo. On Friday it is expected to arrive 
in Zagreb," the diplomat said. 
  According to him, the contact group is facing a complicated 
task. "Neither the Serbs nor the Muslims in Bosnia seem to want 
to heed anything, but their own arguments. This does not give 
rise to optimism, of course," he said. 
  As Interfax's interviewee conceded, tensions around the 
Bosnian city of Brcko remain high. Nevertheless he said that 
the situation should not be dramatized. "A concentration of 
Serb and Muslim troops was noted around Brcko, but noticeable 
actions have been observed from neither side. Maybe the call 
for refraining from provocations made by the chairman of the 
U.N. Security Council had an effect on them. However there is 
another explanation for their restraint: the mountainous 
terrain and the abundance of rivers and rivulets rule out the 
possibility of large-scale military actions in the area of 
Brcko," he said. 
  The diplomat qualified the statement made in Cairo by 
Russia's Foreign Minister, Andrey Kozyrev, and by the U.S. 
secretary of State, Warren Christopher, as fundamentally 
important. The two men called for taking immediate steps to 
ease tensions and prevent offensive military actions in the area 
of Brcko, and for withdrawing all troops from the fixed areas 
around Gorazde." 
  Kozyrev and Christopher also called for immediately resuming 
talks without preliminary conditions with a view to achieving a 
comprehensive settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Text] On Friday in Moscow Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev had a private meeting with the chairman of Tajikistan's 
Supreme Soviet Emomali Rakhmonov. 
  A joint press conference on the results of these talks which 
was planned beforehand did not take place. "The question 
concerns not only the delicacy of the problems discussed by 
Rakhmonov and Kozyrev. We had no opportunity to meet with the 
press because we had to go to Viktor Chernomyrdin," one of the 
members of the Tajik delegation reported to Interfax. 
  Sources in the Russian Foreign Ministry reported to Interfax 
that Kozyrev and Rakhmonov discussed the process of the 
inter-Tajik dialogue, the situation on the Tajik-Afghan border, 
and the situation in Tajikistan. "We have declared once more 
that many problems facing Tajikistan today can be solved if the 
Tajik-Afghan dialogue results in a civil peace in the republic," 
a high ranking Russian diplomat declared in his interview with 
Interfax. 
  He reported that the parties had only indirectly touched 
upon 
the issue on Tajikistan's joining the ruble zone. "This is the 
subject for negotiations between the Tajik leader and the 
Russian Prime Minister,' he said. 
  According to Interfax interlocutor, Russia does not link the 
issue on Tajikistan's joining the ruble zone with a complete 
normalization of the situation in the republic. "One should be a 
realist -- the settlement process in Tajikistan will take much 
time and the issue on the expansion of the ruble zone concerning 
Tajikistan can be solved quicker," he said.

has met Chairman of the Tajik parliament Emomali Rakhmonov in 
the Kremlin. The meeting is being held behind closed doors. 
However, it was reported that the talks are focused on economic 
issues, and primarily, Tajikistan's admission into the rouble 
zone. Although Russian roubles are in circulation in 
Tajikistan, this is considered to be a temporary measure yet. 
  During the talks the two leaders are expected to discuss the 
internal political situation in Tajikistan and the situation on

information on preparations for wide-scale military actions by 
Tajik opposition militants against Russian border guards in 
Tajikistan. This was announced by Press Secretary of the Russian 
Border Defense troop command, Colonel Aleksandr Suvorov today. 
  He suggested that such actions would mark the beginning of 
the spring-summer attack planned by "the Tajik government in 
exile." Suvorov stressed that large formations of militants were 
concentrating on the Pyanj and Shuroabad areas near the border. 
He did not rule out that the armed opposition in Tajikistan 
could participate in actions against Russian border guards. 
  Suvorov stated that all actions against Russian border 
guards 
would fail. The command of the Russian Border Defense troops in 
Tajikistan is taking all necessary measures in order to resist 
possible attacks, Suvorov emphasized. 
  "All responsibility for the attempt to trigger off military 
actions on the border will lay on those trying to hamper the 
peace settlement in Tajikistan with their own lives and that of 
others," Suvorov said.

  [Text] Russia and Kazakhstan intend to continue 
consultations soon to word an inter-governmental treaty on 
Moscow's lease of the Baykonur space center. 
  A top Russian Space Agency official disclosed to INTERFAX 
that the agency's General Director Yuriy Koptev is to meet with 
Kazakhstan's Deputy Premier Galym Abilsiitov in Almaty to 
discuss possible solutions to the issue. 
  The treaty must tally with the interstate agreement "On the 
basic principles and terms of using the Baykonur space center," 
signed by the presidents Boris Yeltsin and Nursultan Nazarbayev 
in Moscow on March 28. The latter accord legally entitles 
Russia to use Baykonur and the adjacent town of Leninsk during 
20 years and prolong the lease, if it wishes, for yet another 10 
years. Russia's annual pay for the use of these facilities is 
set at 115 million dollars. 
  As INTERFAX has learned, pending his trip to Almaty, Koptev 
met on Wednesday with the Russian Aero-Space Forces' Vladimir 
Ivanov to coordinate a single position on the status of Russian 
servicemen at Baykonur. The Aero-Space Forces are responsible 
for launching all spacecraft and boosters from Baykonur.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Gadzhi Shamov] </F>
  [Excerpts] Makhachkala, 5 May (ITAR-TASS) -- A conference 
protocol on examining issues relating to border and customs 
control between Russia and Azerbaijan was signed in Makhachkala 
today. It recognizes the expediency of speeding up the start of 
talks with Azerbaijan to maintain and develop traditional ties 
between the residents of border areas of southern Dagestan and 
the north of Azerbaijan and their freedom of contact. Until 
agreement is reached on these matters it has been decided, in 
particular, to establish a border and customs regime that 
facilitates as far as possible contact between ethnic Dagestanis 
living on both sides of the Samur River. 
  The protocol was signed, on the Russian side, by Sergey 
Stepashin, director of the Russian Federal Counterintelligence 
Service and member of the Russian Federation Security Council, 
and other members of an important delegation from Moscow. The 
delegation discussed the sociopolitical situation in Dagestan, 
problems on the border between Dagestan and Azerbaijan, and the 
crime situation in the republic. On the Dagestani side, the 
protocol was signed by Magomed-Ali Magomedov, chairman of the 
Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Dagestan, and Abdurazak 
Mirzabekov, chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Republic 
of Dagestan. 
  Today the Russian Federation delegation met with staff of 
the 
Federal Counterintelligence Service of Dagestan and held talks 
and consultations at the state nationalities committee of the 
Republic of Dagestan, where discussion of the problem of the 
Lezgin people was continued. 
  The visiters and hosts noted with satisfaction the 
fruitfulness of talks with the Azerbaijani delegation on the 
border yesterday, at which an initial understanding was reached 
on the Russian and Azerbaijani sides reaching agreement as soon 
as possible on the establishment of a "transparent" border for 
Dagestanis living in both states. [passage omitted] 
  Summing up the results of the stay in Dagestan by the 
delegation of representatives of the federal authorities in a 
conversation with an ITAR-TASS correspondent, the delegation's 
head, Sergey Stepashin, director of the Russian Federal 
Counterintelligence Service said: "We fulfilled the main points 
of our program and have outlined specific proposals to improve 
the sociopolitical situation in the republic, particularly in 
the south. These will be taken to the president of the Russian 
Federation and to members of the state council [as received], 
and of the appropriate ministries and departments. 
  "During yesterday's talks with the Azerbaijani side, members 
of its delegation promised to take our proposals on the border 
to Geydar Aliyev and other state leaders. And I believe that 
talks with them on this matter will begin within the next month. 
  "As for the issues of terrorism, the rise in crime in the 
republic in general, and the Derbent tragedy in particular, I am 
sure that these problems will be solved. A special group of top 
professionals -- investigators, lawyers, and others -- will come 
to Dagestan from Moscow to help with this. I have already 
issued the relevant instructions. 
  "I would like to wish the Dagestani people continued 
patience 
and wisdom so as to improve the situation through joint efforts." 
  The delegation of representatives of federal authorities 
left 
for Kabarda-Balkaria today.

<F P=106> [Svetlana Sukhova report: "Azerbaijan Signs NATO Program. </F>
Aliyev Has Preferred a Brussels Trip to Talks With Armenians"] 
  [Excerpt] A situation developing in the 
Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict clearly does not favor Baku. 
Yesterday, Armenian troop units continued their advance along 
the northern (Geranboy), northeastern (Ter-Ter), and eastern 
(Agdam-Agdzhabedi) axes. Owing to the aggravation of tensions 
Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet Speaker Rasul Guliyev could not 
arrive in Bishkek for talks with an Armenian delegation and 
representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians. Instead, he sent 
his deputy, Afiyaddin Dzhalilov. Azerbaijani leader Geydar 
Aliyev did not arrive for the talks, either: He chose another 
venue for a visit, Brussels. Yesterday, he signed an agreement 
on Azerbaijan's joining the "Partnership for Peace" program at 
NATO headquarters. 
  That Aliyev's demarche has been prompted by the desire to 
spite Russia was confirmed by its abruptness. By some accounts, 
it was precisely the recommendation not to rush the signing of 
the NATO program, given to parliament Speaker Rasul Guliyev the 
day before yesterday in Moscow, that "helped" the Azerbaijani 
president definitely to make up his mind. In addition, 
Azerbaijan, which has lost over 20 percent of its territory, has 
yet another reason to affix its signature to the "Partnership" 
agreement. The TURAN news agency has been told at the 
Azerbaijani Defense Ministry that units made up completely of 
Russian servicemen have been sighted seizing settlements and 
turning them over to Armenian formations in a number of front 
sectors (six villages in the Agdam district alone). At the same 
time, the "sighted Russians" use state-of-the-art military 
equipment, including T-80 tanks; the Russian Foreign Ministry 
would not comment on the report. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Orlov article: "Expulsion: Facts Cited by Russian </F>
Diplomats in Nearby Foreign Countries Demonstrate that 
Oppression of Russian-Speaking Population Is Becoming 
Systematic"] 
  [Text] From 26 to 28 April the Russian Federation 
president's Citizenship Commission, the Russian Federation 
Foreign Ministry, and the Russian Federation Presidential Staff 
held a conference-cum-seminar for personnel of diplomatic 
missions and consular establishments. The seminar's theme was 
expressed rather dryly: "Questions of Citizenship and the 
Position of Fellow-Countrymen in Nearby Foreign Countries." 
However, the report by Abdulakh Mikitayev, chairman of the 
president's Citizenship Commission, the speech by Deputy Foreign 
Minister Boris Pastukhov, and -- most of all -- the reports from 
Russian diplomats were imbued with genuine alarm at the plight 
of the Russian-speaking population in nearby foreign countries, 
first and foremost Estonia and Latvia. 
  The situation in the Republic of Latvia provides the most 
glaring example of the overt "expulsion" of Russians, 
Ukrainians, Belorussians, and Poles. Here are a few facts. 
According to the 1989 census 64.5 percent of the population of 
Riga were non-Latvians (mainly Russian), in Liepaja the figure 
was 61.2 percent, and in Daugavpils 87 percent. The figures 
have changed now, but at any rate 45-60 percent of the 
population in those cities is Russian. The vast mass of them 
were already deprived of citizenship (apart from those who were 
citizens of Latvia before 1940 and those of special service to 
the republic) and in 1993 they were deprived even of the 
possibility of participating in the formation of local 
self-government. The majority of them have the status of 
"permanent resident" and have only the hope of obtaining 
citizenship -- as a rule an impossible hope. 
  A lot has been said about the language barrier. Let us add 
just a small comment here: Enterprise directors who hire 
Russians with no knowledge of the local language are liable to 
be fined. "Occupation forces -- get out of the good apartments!" 
is a slogan you can often see in Latvia. At the moment, 
however, it is no more than a slogan. 
  In conversation with your ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondent, 
Georgiy Isakovskiy, head of the Russian Federation Embassy 
Consular Department in the Republic of Latvia, talked about the 
activity of the Latvian Ministry of Internal Affairs Department 
of Citizenship and Migration. Despite the fact that this 
structure's work is regulated by secret documents, which 
therefore have no force, it ventures to do things which violate 
the constitution and laws of Latvia. A circular stamp placed in 
a passport by the department denotes a Russian serviceman, a 
square stamp denotes a reservist. These marks are grounds for 
overt discrimination when it comes to hiring people and the 
registration of ownership rights. The Latvian press publishes 
lists of the Russian military complete addresses and telephone 
numbers -- so everyone can display "civic activeness." Recently 
a highly sophisticated process began in which residents who 
travel to neighboring countries (Russia, Estonia, and 
Belorussia) [Belarus] to visit relatives are exiled 
[vysylayutsya]. They are forced to obtain Russian general civil 
foreign passports, and when they return to Latvia (people travel 
without a visa, of course) the Latvian residence permits in the 
former USSR passports are canceled and the Russian general civil 
foreign passports are stamped to prohibit them from entering the 
country for five years and order them to leave Latvia within 
seven days. 
  Tyranny? Yes, without doubt. And this is acknowledged by 
the Latvian courts when they restore the rights of permanent 
residents of the country. But by no means everyone goes to 
court -- a large proportion of them sell their property within 
seven days and leave for Russia. If these people do not leave 
or appeal to the court action is taken against them...no, not by 
the law enforcement agencies but by detachments of the 
"zemessargi" [home defense guard]. 
  It is staggering but true that a state structure -- the 
Department for Citizenship and Migration -- bases its activity 
on the "zemessargi." Organized on the pattern of the 
Volksdeutsche and Hitler Youth, these youth structures have the 
job of intimidating the Russian-speaking population. 
  But why are the permanent residents of the Republic of 
Latvia 
not expressing dissatisfaction, why are they not uniting? They 
have been banned from doing that. The charters of organizations 
whose purpose is to defend human rights in Latvia are not 
registered. If their charter contains no line to that effect 
but the organizations engage in this activity anyway, they are 
banned on the grounds that they are not abiding by their 
charter. All associations of Russians in Latvia except cultural 
societies are essentially underground. 
  How can human rights violations in the nearby foreign 
countries be combated? 
  Boris Pastukhov described as urgent the signing of a 
"package" of agreements with Latvia (that is, together with the 
settlement of the situation concerning military pensioners). 
The Russian Federation deputy foreign minister noted that the 
Latvian side is dragging out the talks and in this situation a 
Russian action program is being prepared to protect the rights 
of specific inhabitants. Abdulakh Mikitayev declared that 
Russia must grant dual citizenship to residents after the 
conclusion of the corresponding accords with nearby foreign 
states, and cited the experience of France and Canada, where 
there are more than 2 million people with dual citizenship.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Reports by </F>
diplomatic correspondents Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and 
others] 
  [Text] Another round of Estonian-Russian talks began in the 
village of Lohusalu near Tallinn on Thursday. Participants in 
it will discuss the time for Russian troops withdrawal from 
Estonia. 
  It's common knowledge that late last year Russia proposed to 
conclude the withdrawal of its remaining 25 hundred servicemen 
by August 31, on condition that social guarantees be granted to 
Russian military retirees living in Estonia. 
  Tallinn views this demand as "overstepping the framework of 
agreement and running counter to the bill on aliens adopted in 
Estonia." 
  Lately Estonian diplomacy "discredited itself" in the 
"Russian direction", a senior Russian diplomat in charge of 
Baltic problems told Interfax. 
  As he said, realizing the futility of its attempts to "turn 
the talks held on the level of governmental delegations in its 
own favor, the Estonian leadership is increasingly active in its 
efforts to raise them to the level of presidents." 
  "In fact, President Lennart Meri makes no secret of his wish 
to come to Moscow and meet with Boris Yeltsin. However Russia's 
attitude to this issue remains unchanged -- a meeting between 
the two presidents can take place only if the Estonian side 
agrees to sign the entire package of "military" agreements with 
Russia. Apart from the main treaty on troops withdrawal, these 
documents include an agreement on social guarantees for Russian 
military retirees and their families. To Russia this agreement 
is no less important than the treaty on troops withdrawal, but 
Tallinn stubbornly refuses to sign it," the diplomat said. 
  According to him, "it's hard to expect any serious shifts" 
from the present round of Russian-Estonian talks." "No 
illusions should be nurtured in this respect. Estonian 
diplomats drove themselves into a corner, and now they will find 
it hard to get out of it," said Interfax's interviewee.

  [Text] Pskov May 5 TASS -- An expedition from the Russian 
Federation's chief directorate for geology and cartography has 
begun drawing the border line between Russia and Estonia near 
Pskov "on the basis of old and new data, maps and official 
documents". 
  During negotiations with Estonia, the Russian delegation 
repeatedly called on the Estonian side to begin joint work to 
demarcate the state border but heard refusals each time. 
  The Russian leadership decided to begin marking and 
reinforcing the border unilaterally, Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev announced during his visit to Pskov in April. He 
stressed then that "the border must reinforced with technical 
means but not with the bodies of Russian soldiers". The 
minister was referring to the shooting of a Russian border 
patrol by contrabandists specialising in arms trade. 
  The expedition will mark the border on the terrain in May 
and 
then the border guards will install special signs and protection 
devices.

Rumyantsev] 
  [Text] St. Petersburg, 5 May -- Relations between Russia 
and Estonia and, in particular, the problem of the withdrawal of 
Russian troops will be the subject of an exchange of opinions at 
the meeting between Russia's Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and 
Sweden's Prime Minister Carl Bildt. 
  At St. Petersburg's Pulkovo-2 airport, where the head of the 
Russian Federation's Foreign Ministry arrived today, he told 
journalists: We shall withdraw our troops from Estonia solidly 
and in a worthy manner on the basis of an agreement which, if it 
is concluded without delay, will allow our forces to be 
withdrawn by 31 August 1994. Unfortunately, no signals have yet 
been seen from the Estonian side indicating that they intend to 
conduct the talks seriously, Andrey Kozyrev said. 
  The minister stressed that Russia is capable of settling its 
relations with Estonia by itself. However, Russia welcomes it 
when other states help in resolving problems, as happened during 
the talks with Latvia. Carl Bildt and the leaders of other 
countries played a positive role in achieving a compromise. 
  Andrey Kozyrev called attention to the fact that after the 
withdrawal of troops from the Baltic states, the question of 
observing CSCE norms and international standards in the sphere 
of human rights will remain urgent. We consider, the minister 
said, that Sweden and other states are not extraneous to this 
question. We are against human rights' problems being turned 
into just bilateral questions. 
  Russia, Kozyrev noted, favours setting up in the Council of 
cooperation of Baltic Sea states the post of commissioner for 
human rights and ethnic minorities who would have quite a lot of 
work to do in the Baltic region. 
  Speaking of links with Sweden, Andrey Kozyrev described 
these 
relations as good. The Swedes, he said, display a business-like 
approach in partnership within the framework of the CSCE and at 
a regional level.

  [Text] St. Petersburg May 5 TASS -- "The head of the 
Swedish Government agreed with me on the need to establish a 
post of a commissioner for human rights and national minorities 
in the states of the Baltic Sea," Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev told a news conference devoted to the results of 
his meeting with Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt today. 
  When discussing the condition of the Russian speaking 
population in the Baltic countries, the Russian foreign minister 
noted, both sides came to the conclusion that this is an 
all-European problem and it must be settled in strict accordance 
with the norms of the Conference for Security and Cooperation in 
Europe (CSCE) and the generally recognized human standards. 
  In reply to a question why Estonia does not wish to follow 
the Latvian way in the talks with Russia, Carl Bildt said that 
the situation in Estonia was more complex. However, he noted, 
with a goodwill [as received] from both sides it is possible to 
reach a compromise. At least, the conclusion of a package of 
agreements between Russia and Latvia may serve an example for 
other states. 
  The Russian foreign minister and the Swedish premier drew 
attention to the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina which sharpened 
again. According to them, the world community should take 
urgent constructive measures so that the situation around the 
town of Brcko did not get out of control. Otherwise, it will be 
practically impossible to return to the peaceful development of 
the events there. 
  Andrey Kozyrev and Carl Bildt believe that their working 
meeting in St. Petersburg was a success. They stated that 
similar dialogues should be continued.

<F P=106> [Correspondent Sten Sjostrom report from St. Petersburg] </F>
  [Text] Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt today visited St. 
Petersburg, where he met Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev. The most important question in the negotiations was the 
withdrawal of Russian troops from the Baltic countries. 
  [Begin Bildt recording] I think there is a Russian will to 
withdraw. We have had a dialogue around these questions and 
other questions concerning the Baltic countries, and I believe 
that this has been of importance, both for Russian policies and 
for developments generally. [end recording] 
  Last week, the presidents of Russia and Latvia signed an 
agreement on Russian troops withdrawing from Latvia on 31 August 
at the latest. The Russian Army has already been withdrawn from 
Lithuania, so the only remaining country now is Estonia. Prime 
Minister Bildt has involved himself deeply in this matter, and 
Estonia was also the main theme at the negotiations between 
Bildt and Foreign Minister Kozyrev. A vital question is, what 
sort of status the thousands of retired Russian military 
personnel will have, people who often are not older than 40-50 
years; Russia managed to sign a special agreement with Latvia 
which will regulate their position in the society: They have 
the right to stay in Latvia but they will not receive Latvian 
citizenship. Estonia has refused point-blank to sign any 
special agreement, and said that Russian military personnel will 
be subject to the laws on citizenship and laws on aliens which 
already exist. It looks, at least on paper, that it is Estonia 
which right now is most actively stopping an agreement on 
getting the troops to leave. So the question is, should Prime 
Minister Bildt not be putting pressure on Estonia, instead of 
Russia? 
  [Begin Bildt recording] No, I think such pressure should lie 
mainly on the Russians, because it is Russia which has troops in 
Estonia; it is not Estonia which has troops in Russia. It is a 
fundamental principle in international law that one is not 
allowed to have troops on the territory of other states without 
the agreement of these states. There are a number of questions 
which have been raised in connection with this from the Russian 
side; those questions we will also try to solve, but they are 
not allowed to be decisive; the withdrawal of the troops must be 
completed by 31 August. [end recording]

  [Text] St. Petersburg May 5 TASS--"The Baltic region can 
and should become a dynamically developing and stable area. Our 
country will do everything it can to make that a reality", 
Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt told St. Petersburg Mayor 
Anatoliy Sobchak on Thursday. 
  Not everything is going smoothly as concerns the creation of 
a favorable economic and political climate between the Baltic 
states, the Swedish premier said, but progress has been noted. 
Mutual understanding has increased and fewer sharp attacks are 
being made on each other. 
  Bildt and Sobchak agreed that Swedish businessmen would be 
more active on the St. Petersburg economic scene if the criminal 
situation in that city was not so dangerous. They both were of 
the opinion that Sweden and St. Petersburg must coordinate the 
efforts of their law-enforcement bodies. 
  Bildt even proposed that the leaders of all the Baltic 
countries discuss the idea of creating a regional coordination 
centre for the fight against crime. "We are very worried by the 
growing influx of narcotics into our country from abroad and by 
the appearance of illegal immigrants, which encourage the growth 
of crime", he announced. 
  The Swedish premier also appealed for more political 
cooperation. "all kinds of different party and public 
organisations should take part in the political dialogue, 
including communists and nationalists, which we have as well", 
he said.

  [Text] Mayor of St Petersburg Anatoliy Sobchak has said the 
authorities were doing their utmost to try to ensure perfect 
security for western business there. He was speaking on 
Thursday while meeting Swedish Prime Minister Karl Bildt who 
arrived in St Petersburg to attend Swedish Days there. 
  In this connection, Sobchak pointed to widespread western 
rumors that St Petersburg had become a highly dangerous place 
for business activity. 
  About a month ago, the U.S. consulate in St Petersburg 
compiled a report about the city's rampant crime which was later 
published by U.S. newspapers. The report warns businessmen and 
tourists against visiting St Petersburg and expresses concern 
over high crime rates in the region ahead of the Goodwill Games 
which will involve U.S. sportsmen. 
  Sobchak and Bildt have both expressed satisfaction over the 
state of relations between Russia and Sweden.

  [Text] Moscow May 5 TASS -- The Russian Foreign Ministry 
regards Russian President Boris Yeltsin's forthcoming official 
visit to the Federal Republic of Germany as a great event in the 
face of a new stage of relations between Russia and Germany 
opening with the accomplishment of the Russian troops withdrawal 
from Germany, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Grigoriy 
Karasin told a briefing here today. 
  According to Grigoriy Karasin, the Russo-German summit talks 
which will be held on May 11-13, will "focus on the issues 
connected with the prospects for the further development of 
bilateral relations and their progressive advancement on the 
road of strengthening neighborliness, mutual understanding and 
the establishment of many-sided partnership cooperation". 
  Both leaders will also exchange views on a wide spectrum of 
problems of a world policy and the interaction between Russia 
and Germany on the world arena, the Russian Foreign Ministry 
spokesman pointed out.

    [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian at 1625 GMT on 5 May, the "Details" program carries a 
recorded 10-minute report on the planned departure of Russian 
troops from Germany. Sergey Dorenko outlines the scenario over 
video showing Russian troops loading their equipment on to 
trains, and says: "The Germans have finally contrived to offend 
the Russians: The Russians are given to understand, quite 
clearly, that their presence here, unlike that of the Western 
allies, is simply only tolerated." He goes on to ask what can be 
done about the situation, and suggests that maybe Yeltsin can do 
something. 
  A video sequence then recalls the entry of the allied troops 
into Germany at the end of the World War II. Dorenko says: "All 
the armies were regarded as liberators. Now they are leaving 
Germany without explosions or counterattacks. But the Russian 
withdrawal resembles the shameful retreat of losers. The heart 
of the problem is that the farewell to the Russians is scheduled 
to take place in Weimar. It is planned that on 31 August, 
President Yeltsin and Chancellor Kohl will attend the ceremony 
in the local theater. But a week later, widespread festivities 
are planned in Berlin, the country's historical capital, at 
which all Germany will say goodbye to the Americans, British and 
French." 
  Dorenko then traces the assumed reasons for this situation, 
saying that the Western allies were not just occupiers; they 
were seen by Germans as their defense against the communist 
aggression of the East, personified by the Russian troops in 
their country and in the former East Germany. 
  Matvey Burlakov, commander of the Western Group of Forces, 
then presents his views, saying: "Probably the best thing would 
be a joint farewell to all the allied troops in the anti-Hitler 
coalition. And there are good grounds for this: On 7-9 July, a 
G-7 meeting with our president, Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin, will 
take place in Italy. It would be very good if, at that time, 
after the end of the meeting, the leaders of those states came 
to Berlin for a joint leave-taking -- in other words, they would 
eliminate the consequences of World War II. We want to have a 
farewell in Berlin. The war ended in Berlin. The Soviet troops 
too should depart from Berlin. Unfortunately, I think that it 
is the German leadership that has suggested a leave-taking 
scenario that is not very acceptable, or rather, is unacceptable 
to us. "First, as regards the venue, what is Weimar? During 
the war, the town of Weimar was liberated or captured by 
American troops. 
  It is 350 km from the places where our troops are stationed. 
So they will have to travel all that distance, 350 km. We plan 
to invite a large number of veterans from the Western Group of 
Forces and from the war. Needless to say, transporting the 
veterans there -- six hours there and six hours back -- will not 
be much fun for them. 
  "Second, near Weimar is the huge Buchenwald concentration 
camp, where 56,000 people perished, and a common grave was dug 
for the peoples of Europe or even the world. I think it would 
simply be sacrilege to dance on that common grave. So my 
personal view is that I reject Weimar." 
  Dorenko then points out that no one wants to confuse relief 
at the Russian withdrawal with gratitude to the Western allies. 
The Russians are leaving not of their own good will, but 
because communism has been defeated. Maybe Yeltsin can reach 
some agreement during next week's visit. 
  Defense Minister Pavel Grachev tried to clarify the 
situation. He said: "There are a few nuances on the German 
side as regards the troop withdrawal issue. Boris Nikolayevich 
is to pay an official visit to Germany 11-13 May. I will be 
present as a member of a government delegation. One of the 
questions to be tackled will be a final decision on the 
procedure for the withdrawal, the ceremonial withdrawal, of our 
troops from German territory. I am sure that the president and 
the chancellor are quite...[pauses] will find a correct, 
alternative...[pauses] not alternative, but correct decision on 
the withdrawal, the ceremonial withdrawal, of the troops." 
  Dorenko then points to the difference between the American 
and Russian troops, saying: The Americans are taking nothing 
with them apart from their weapons. They will be replaced by 
U.S. firms, since the premises they occupy have been purchased 
from the Germans. The Russians are taking everything, even the 
toilets. Many soldiers know that no accommodation awaits them 
in Russia. 
  Grachev comments again, saying: "What is being done? A 
great deal is being done. First, 7.8 billion Deutschmarks [DM] 
were invested in us initially, then a further DM550 million. 
With this money 32 military cantonments should be constructed 
by foreign firms before the end of 1995. That is with all the 
infrastructure. Thirty-two military cantonments with 34,590 
apartments, of which three residential cantonments have been 
constructed so far, and the construction of 22 is under way; 
there will be 22 cantonments with between three and nine ready 
every month, but in practice this year a further 22 cantonments 
will be commissioned through the efforts of foreign firms, 
although foreign firms are basically to blame for the delay, but 
they cite the bad climatic conditions, the harsh winters and, in 
general, the vast expanse of Russia." 
  Dorenko comments: "The officers in the Western Group of 
Forces recall that a considerable amount of the aid has been 
spent on putting up buildings in Ukraine and Belarus. One can 
lament as much as one likes now: It is clear that there are no 
apartments and no money, and that a further 32,000 military 
personnel and their families have to be housed somewhere." 
  Toward the end of the program, Grachev says: "I sincerely 
congratulate all veterans, all frontline troops, on the great 
Victory Day. May the sacred day of 9 May be the start of our 
spiritual unification for the sake of Russia's prosperity."

  [Text] Moscow, 5 May (ITAR-TASS) -- Alarming reports are 
coming in from Yemen about an escalation of military actions 
between northern and southern Yemeni military formations, which 
have spread to various areas of the country. Government 
establishments in Saana and some other parts of the country were 
subjected to bomb strikes, and clashes are occurring in the Aden 
area. Large-scale forces are involved in the fighting, and 
tanks, artillery, and aircraft are being employed. This is 
stated in a Russian Federation Foreign Ministry statement which 
has been received by ITAR-TASS. 
  "These developments to all intents and purposes nullify the 
efforts that have been undertaken recently by many countries, 
including Russia, with a view to averting an escalation of the 
conflict between the northerners and southerners, and to 
inducing the Yemenis to seek mutually acceptable solutions and 
the preservation of the country's unity. In effect, the threat 
has arisen of the conflict escalating into civil war, which will 
inevitably bring the Yemeni people fresh suffering, large-scale 
casualties, and political chaos. 
  Stemming from its traditional friendly relations with the 
Yemeni people -- in both the north and the south of the country 
-- Russia urgently calls on the opposing sides to cease 
hostilities immediately and to find within themselves the 
courage to settle their differences peacefully. Moscow 
considers that, whatever the reasons motivating those involved 
in the conflict, nothing can justify the killing of people, 
bloodshed, and destruction. 
  Despite the depth of the internal differences in Yemen, 
Moscow believes in the political wisdom of its leaders, who have 
in the past shown their ability to tackle the most complex 
problems on the basis of the interests and aspirations of the 
Yemeni people," the Russian Foreign Ministry statement says.

  [Text] Vladivostok May 6 TASS -- "Russo-Chinese border's 
demarcation will allow us to normalise the situation in the 
border areas, where passions are now very high," roving 
ambassador of the Russian Foreign Ministry Genrikh Kireyev, head 
of the Russian part of the demarcation commission, told a 
briefing here today. 
  He said that an expedition would go to the Ussuri District 
this month to prove Russia's sovereignty over ten square 
kilometres of hunting grounds, now claimed by China. 
  The ambassador said that an early demarcation of the border 
would meet the interests of both sides, while the ratification 
of agreements on the revised borderline would "rule out the 
possibility of mutual territorial claims in the future". 
  The members of the demarcation commission especially 
stressed 
that the interests of the local population should by no means be 
jeopardised during the demarcation. According to Kireyev, the 
possibility of jointly using of some of the disputed areas was 
now being discussed. Moreover, both China and Russia are ready 
to make mutual concessions concerning small border strips. For 
instance, China is ready to transfer to Russian jurisdiction a 
part of the territory in Khasan district. Soviet borderguards, 
killed during the conflict near Lake Khasan, are buried there. 
  On the whole, it is planned to end the demarcation work on 
the Russo-Chinese border in 1997.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 86 (576)] </F>
  [Text] President Islam Karimov in a keynote speech at the 
opening session of parliament in Tashkent on Thursday [5 May] 
said his country was firmly on the road of independence. He 
spoke of intensive work under way to try to implement market 
reforms and promote private enterprise. 
  Karimov put the number of state-run businesses falling into 
private hands at more than 800 with the number of private 
companies being doubled. He said the country's privatization 
process had no analogs adding that one in three workers was 
employed in the private sector. 
  On the country's interim currency unit, the som-coupon, 
introduced six months ago, he said that although it was gaining 
in strength against other currencies, Uzbekistan was in need of 
a permanent national currency unit as an indication of its true 
independence. Karimov called to examine the experience gained 
by other countries to make the new currency unit prestigious. 
  He expressed surprise why preference should be given to the 
Russian ruble rather than the currencies of neighboring states 
of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Turkmenistan. This, he said, is 
throwback to the times when Uzbekistan depended on Moscow and 
was considered to be a net exporter of raw materials. "We are 
well aware that the ruble is stronger than the coupon. That is 
why Uzbekistan must also introduce a strong currency unit 
similar to Russia's to help us break into the world market," he 
said. 
  Karimov said that the newly-built money-printing facility 
could help produce a sufficient amount of new banknotes and 
coins to be circulated soon, possibly in July. 
  At the same time, he called for higher exports as a way of 
increasing foreign exchange revenues including the U.S. dollar 
which was stronger than the ruble. Karimov said this year's 
export earnings would run at 1.5 billion dollars or 40-50 
percent of the country's potential of export trade. But the 
figure can be doubled, he said. 
  Karimov spoke of widespread public support for economic 
reforms. But the process must evolve within the framework of 
law. In this connection, he stressed the need to step up the 
war on corruption which was capable of eroding government 
activity. 
  The Uzbek leader called on commercial structures to do their 
job honestly. "If the businessmen break laws, the people will 
curse them," he said. 
  Karimov accused whom he described as some CIS leaders of 
having engaged in rhetoric "which has led to bad results." 
  He also spoke of the newly-emerging situation in Russia and 
a 
drive by some of its politicians to restore Russian clout to the 
region. Karimov is worried over LDP leader Vladimir 
Zhirinovsky's statements which, he believes, "poses threat to 
the future of Uzbekistan." 
  Karimov is also opposed to concepts such as common 
parliament, language and currency. The leaders of Uzbekistan, 
Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan during a recent summit had agreed to 
drop the concept of a Eurasian Union, Karimov said. 
  IF Note: The idea of a Eurasian Union complete with 
supranational structures to coordinate economic and defence 
policies was put forward by President Nursultan Nazarbayev of 
Kazakhstan during a visit to Moscow in March. He said such an 
entity could help pursue a common economic policy, introduce 
common frontiers and a supranational currency unit with national 
currencies kept intact. However, Nazarbayev's initiative has 
drawn little support from other CIS leaders. 
  Our main task, said Karimov, is to preserve the country's 
independence and work together with other CIS states to try to 
bring an early economic recovery. No one will give us any 
reversal to the past, he said.

  [Text] No particular results were achieved during the round 
of Estonian-Russian talks which ended today at Lohusalu. For 
this reason the parties have acknowledged that the talks between 
the two countries are deadlocked, as before. The Estonian and 
Russian delegations failed to agree on the agreements on both 
the troop withdrawal and social guarantees to military 
pensioners. During a news conference which followed the talks, 
both the Estonian and Russian delegation leaders accused each 
other of reluctance to approach the issues in question in a 
constructive manner. 
  During this talks round the Estonian and Russian delegations 
initialled only an agreement on educational cooperation and 
signed a border representatives' agreement. 
  Ambassador Vasiliy Svirin, the Russian delegation leader, 
told the journalists that there is no clause within the 
Estonian-Russian agreement on military pensioners which differs 
from a similar agreement initialled between Latvia and Russia. 
And for this reason Russia had been expecting success here. 
Unfortunately no agreement was reached due to the Estonian 
side's truculence. 
  Russia continues to demand that together with the general 
troop withdrawal agreement an agreement on military pensioners 
is also signed. Russia also demands that all military 
pensioners should have the right to obtain permanent residence 
permits in Estonia, and that the years they had served in the 
Soviet army should be included on their privatization 
registration cards. The Estonian side has not agreed to these 
demands because even for Estonian citizens the time served in 
the Soviet Army is not included. 
  Ambassador Vaino Reinart, the Estonian delegation's leader, 
stated that the situation in Estonia differs from that of 
Latvia, and one must operate within the laws which are in force 
here. According to Reinart, the Russian representatives have so 
far not agreed to discuss the particulars of the removal of 
Paldiski nuclear reactors by linking this to other issues. 
Svirin, too, stated to the journalists that Russia wants to 
sign a full agreement on the abolition of the military base of 
Paldiski, and the Estonian side is unfortunately dragging its 
feet on this. Reinart said that he did not fully understand 
which agreement Svirin was talking about. Russia has pledged to 
remove the nuclear fuel by the end of June and nobody knows why 
there is a delay. 
  The Estonian and Russian delegations did not agree a date 
for 
the 20th round of talks. Within the next two weeks the 
delegations' working groups will be meeting. They will 
recommend to the delegations ways for bringing the talks out of 
deadlock.

  [Text] The 19th round of Estonian-Russian talks will end 
today at Lohusalu. As reported to Estonian Radio by the Foreign 
Ministry, no breakthrough was achieved at yesterday's meeting. 
The Russian side did not alter its positions on the issue of 
military pensioners. Russia demands that social protection for 
Russian military pensioners should be viewed within a single 
package containing the troop withdrawal agreement. Estonia 
continues to stand firmly on its posiiton: the Russian troop 
withdrawal cannot be linked to any additional conditions. 
According to Vaino Reinart, the Estonian delegation's leader, 
the delegations expect to initial an agreement on cooperation in 
education today. This will lay down the principles for student 
exchanges, cooperation between higher education establishments, 
and other matters.

  [Text] Tallinn, May 04, BNS -- Crews at the Russian naval 
base on the island of Naissaar, bordering the Gulf of Tallinn, 
by May 1 had destroyed all mines they had on the island, the 
Estonian Foreign Ministry press office reported quoting officers 
at the Russian naval headquarters in Tallinn. 
  A big number of mines and explosives still remains on 
another 
Estonian island, Suur-Pakri, or Great Pakri, situated off the 
former Russian base town of Paldiski. While its neighboring 
small island of Vaike-Pakri looks relatively nice, Suur-Pakri 
looks like some kind of a "sea hedgehog," the government's 
special representative Juri Tikk has said. 
  The Pakri islands were used as training fields by the 
Russian 
military. Tikk said the ammunition left on Suur-Pakri ranges 
from non-exploding training mines and bombs to shells filled 
20-percent with ammunition. 
  Crews of the Estonian Rescue Department are expected to 
start 
cleaning Suur-Pakri of this legacy within few weeks. Rescue 
Department experts say it is very difficult to determine the 
exact types of the shells, because many of them are covered with 
heavy rust.

  [Text] Today the Saeima adopted on its third reading a law 
on the state security institutions and a law on the Bureau for 
the Protection of the Constitution [Satversmes Aizsardzibas 
Birojs]. The law on the state security institutions, as an 
umbrella law, determines the concept and content of national 
security, the legal basis, purposes and tasks of the work of the 
state security institutions. 
  According to this law, the state security institutions as a 
whole will create the Bureau for the Protection of the 
Constitution, the Military Counter-Intelligence Service of the 
Ministry of Defense, the Security Police of the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs, and the Information Service of the Home Guard 
Headquarters. The main tasks of the organs of state security are 
the collection of political, economic, military, and other 
information connected with state security and ecological 
threats, and its use in a manner prescribed in the law, as well 
as the protection of state secrets and other vitally important 
information to the state's interests. The fulfillment of the 
main tasks of the state security organs will be monitored by the 
National Security Council [Nacionalas Drosibas Padome]. 
  The Cabinet of Ministers will monitor the state security 
institutions subject to it. Parliamentary control of the state 
security institutions will be exercised by the Saeima Commission 
on National Security. The Bureau for the Protection of the 
Constitution is a nonmilitary institution of state security, 
which is to conduct, in a manner prescribed in the law, as well 
as organize and coordinate, the intelligence and 
counter-intelligence activity of the state security 
institutions, receiving, collating and using information 
relating to the country's security, defense and economic 
security. Supervision of its activity, in correspondence with 
the laws, will be the work of the Procurator-General of the 
Republic of Latvia or procurators especially delegated by him. 
The Bureau for the Protection of the Constitution is also 
subject to the control of the courts.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: by Nikolay </F>
Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by Vladimir Shishlin] 
  [Text] Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis categorically 
rejected information spread by mass media and stating that 
Estonian President Lennart Meri allegedly declared at the 
meeting of the presidents of three Baltic states last Tuesday 
that having signed the package of agreements on troops 
withdrawal with Russia, Latvia had broken the integrity of the 
Baltic states. "The summit in Jurmala has not accused Latvia of 
the collapse of the Baltic states," Ulmanis stressed at a press 
conference in Riga. 
  Ulmanis has once again pointed to a confidential nature of 
the meeting between leaders of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia, 
which lasted for six hours. Without disclosing any details, 
Ulmanis reported that the meeting primarily discussed problems 
of Russian troops withdrawal from Estonia and possibility to 
involve western states as mediators to settle contradictions 
between Tallinn and Moscow on conditions of forces withdrawal. 
In Ulmanis' words, leaders of the Baltic states have also 
discussed problems related to concentration of forces in 
Russia's Kaliningrad region. 
  The 19th round of the Estonian-Russian inter-state 
negotiations on the time of forces withdrawal from Estonia was 
started on Thursday in the village of Lohusalu near Tallinn. 
  IF Note: As it is known, late last year the Russian party 
proposed to conclude withdrawal of the remaining forces, 
approximately 2500 in number, by 31 August under provision that 
social guarantees, including residence permits, are granted to 
Russian retirees living in Estonia. The Estonian party views 
this demand as an additional one, which oversteps the agreement 
and does not correspond to the decree on aliens adopted in the 
Republic. The delegations failed to overcome these 
contradictions at the previous round of talks in Moscow. 
  The day before Estonian President Lennart Meri received head 
of the Russian delegation Vasiliy Svirin and Russian Ambassador 
to Estonia Aleksandr Trofimov. The press service of the Estonian 
president reported to INTERFAX that Svirin expressed hope for a 
mutually acceptable solution of the existing problems and 
stressed the tactfulness of mutual relations between the Russian 
and Estonian delegations and their strive to normalize relations 
between two states. 
  Speaking about the signed package of the Russian-Latvian 
agreements, Svirin pointed out that in contrast to the estimates 
of the Baltic mass media, they do not contain any concessions on 
the part of Latvia and they represent a compromise from both 
sides. 
  Meanwhile, on Wednesday [4 May] Latvian Premier Valdis 
Birkavs signed an Act testifying to the fact that Latvia takes 
the new building (its construction is not finished yet) of the 
Russian radar station in the village of Skrunda (160 kilometers 
to the south-west from Riga) under its jurisdiction. 
  IF Note: In accordance with the Russian-Latvian agreements 
signed by Presidents Guntis Ulmanis and Boris Yeltsin on 
previous Saturday in Moscow (in the framework of the package of 
agreements on Russian forces withdrawal from Latvia), the radar 
station in Skrunda will function during the next four years. 
Its complete dismantlement should be concluded during 1.5 years 
after the above mentioned term. Latvian government has received 
guarantees stipulating that the US government would allocate $2 
million and the Swedish Government -- $1 million for this 
project. The early warning radar in Skrunda was built in 1967. 
Construction of its new building was started late eighties. 
  After the signing Birkavs reported to journalists that the 
dismantlement of the new building of the station should be 
started immediately. In his words, the government intends to 
announce a tender on participation in the dismantlement of this 
site among different firms.

  [Text] President Algirdas Brazauskas expressed his great 
concern with the fact that prosecutors' offices very often delay 
preliminary investigations into criminal cases, while courts are 
overly slow in examining the latter. The president stated in 
his interview with Lithuanian radio that the operativeness of 
their work is beneath criticism. 
  Many prosecutors' offices and courts do not observe legal 
norms under which preliminary investigations must be completed 
within two months and cases investigated within 25 days. 
Everything is delayed for months and even years. This causes 
the justified indignation of society and government 
institutions. Algirdas Brazauskas said that he was also upset 
by this. 
  During the entire period of investigation, the accused are 
kept in overcrowded cells with unsanitary conditions. People 
are simply neglected there. The president stressed that it 
would be very difficult to administer justice in this way. 
  "I am not speaking about the investigation of cases, which 
is 
an exceptional prerogative of the court, and no one has the 
right to interfere with its work. However, the observance of 
deadlines and the quality of preliminary investigations is the 
common concern of us all," said Algirdas Brazauskas. 
  The president particularly focused on those cases, which are 
being investigated by the Prosecutor General's Office and the 
Supreme Court. The criminal case in which Makutinovich and 
Sklyar, members of the Vilnius OMON [special Soviet militia 
units], are accused of crimes against the state, has been 
sitting in the Supreme Court since September 1993, while they 
had to be sued within 10 days. It has been already a year and 
the criminal case of violations in printing the litas has not 
received any legal assessment. This notorious case, which puts 
high-ranking government officials on trial, was suspended by the 
Supreme Court on 1 February. The latter authorized the 
Prosecutor General's Office to provide new evidence within a 
month. However, no additional material was obtained. The 
president said that he would demand an explanation from both 
institutions.

  [Text] The International Monetary Fund has given Lithuania 
the second part of a systemic credit worth $36 million on 5-6 
percent annual interest to fund the government's economic 
stabilization program. The first equal share of the credit was 
provided last October. 
  The Head of the State Credits Department at Lithuania's 
Finance Ministry, Ruta Skyriene, has reported to INTERFAX that 
the money was given for 10 years with a five-year moratorium. 
The 5 percent annual credit rate will be corrected quarterly, 
however, it will remain under six percent. The loan will be 
returned only in hard currency, she stressed. 
  In her words, although Lithuania's State Bank has been 
negotiating with republican commercial banks on how the second 
part of the credit should best be used, they have not come up 
with anything of substance. 
  An IMF envoy to Lithuania Peter Cornelius has told INTERFAX 
that the second part of the credit may go "to put the Lithuanian 
commercial banks balance of payment in order."

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Konstantin Pribytkov] </F>
  [Text] Geneva 8 May TASS -- "Since the Commonwealth is now 
officially recognized and has the status of observer in the 
United Nations, this means that the CIS should take an active 
part in all processes developing in the world community," said 
CIS executive secretary Ivan Korotechnya, who visited the U.N. 
European branch earlier this week. 
  Summing up the results of his visit in an interview with 
TASS, Korotechnya noted that the point at issue was actually 
"participation by the CIS, in the capacity of observer, in all 
meetings of international organizations having their 
representative offices in Geneva." This would enable the 
Commonwealth to spell out its vision of certain issues at the 
international level and to express its position on these issues. 
  During his trip to Geneva, Korotechnya signed on behalf of 
the CIS secretariat an agreement on cooperation with the 
secretariat of the U.N. Conference for Trade and Development 
(UNCTAD), held talks with executive secretary of the European 
Economic Commission Yves Berthelot and Director General of the 
World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Arpad Bogsch. 
  "The agreement with the UNCTAD defines directions for 
further 
joint work and mutual interests," the CIS executive secretary 
said, referring to regular consultations, exchange of 
information, technical assistance. The visit to the European 
Economic Commission laid the foundation for further cooperation. 
As for the WIPO, a meeting is scheduled to be held in the 
Belarusian capital Minsk in a month and a half, which is to draw 
plenipotentiary envoys of CIS member-countries and to be 
attended by Bogsch. The meeting is to concentrate on 
coordination in protection of intellectual property rights. 
  "The recognition by the United Nations of the CIS as a 
regional association prompted us to approve at our latest 
meeting in Moscow a plan of measures aiming to develop 
international contacts," Korotechnya reported. The recent visit 
by U.N. Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to the CIS 
headquarters in Minsk proved to the United Nations' interest in 
cooperation with the CIS. "I do not rule out that in prospect a 
representative office of the CIS as a whole will be set up in 
Geneva," the executive secretary noted. "But for this, we need a 
decision by the council of heads of government or of heads of 
state," he added. 
  At present, each of the newly-independent states is 
establishing ties with U.N. structures separately, and yet "we 
are also looked at as the Commonwealth on the whole," 
Korotechnya pointed out. Orienting itself for international 
contacts, the CIS secretariat does not intend by any means "to 
influence any bilateral ties": All CIS member-countries have 
the right to choose their partners on their own. The point at 
issue is just cooperation that could be profitable for the 
entire Commonwealth. 
  At the latest meeting of CIS heads of state and government 
in 
Moscow, "we took a serious step towards consolidation and 
strengthening of the Commonwealth," the CIS executive secretary 
said. "We have reached the level of Commonwealth when the 
member-states are gathering at the table not just to sign some 
document," he emphasised. At the same time, all states are 
sovereign, therefore we should search for a consensus when 
solving our problems. "We should take counsel and reach 
agreement -- this is the main essence of the Commonwealth. This 
is perhaps the core of democracy and of all processes currently 
underway in our society," Korotechnya pointed out.

<F P=106> [Russian Federation Federal Assembly Federation Council </F>
Decree "On Conducting Agrarian Reform in the Russian Federation 
and Reviving and Developing Agro-Industrial Production Through 
the Year 2000," signed by V.F. Shumeyko, chairman of the Russian 
Federation Federal Assembly Federation Council, and dated 27 
April 1994] 
  [Text] The Federation Council notes that in accordance 
with the Russian Federation Federal Assembly Federation Council 
decree dated 26 February 1994 No. 51-I FC "On Legislative 
Support for the Functioning of the Russian Federation 
Agro-Industrial Complex," the Federation Council Agrarian Policy 
Committee, together with the Russian Federation Government, 
Federation Council and State Duma committees, and federal organs 
of state power organized parliamentary hearings 18 March and 4 
April 1994 on questions connected with conducting agrarian 
reform in the Russian Federation and reviving and developing 
agro-industrial production through the year 2000. 
  The majority of participants in the parliamentary hearings 
recognized that the agrarian reform in the Russian Federation 
begun in 1991 is being conducted in the absence not just of a 
state program for transformations in the agro-industrial 
complex, but also of a scientifically validated concept of it. 
  At the same time, many of the edicts of the Russian 
Federation president and Russian Federation Government decrees 
and directives in accordance with which agrarian reform is being 
conducted are frequently contradictory, and sometimes simply 
wrong. They are not divided into phases, the measures carried 
out are not comprehensive, and it has not been determined to 
what extent they are effective. Decisions by representative 
organs of power on agrarian questions are frequently not carried 
out. As a result of the implementation of an ill-considered 
economic policy, the country's agro-industrial complex is in the 
grip of a serious crisis. Production of agro-industrial output 
is falling sharply. The country is becoming increasingly 
dependent on export purchases of food, which is leading to 
Russia's dependence on foreign states not only in terms of food 
and economics, but also politically. 
  Price, credit, taxation, and investment policy has 
completely 
wrecked the financial state of the sector and stopped the 
process of expanded reproduction in the agro-industrial complex. 
  Practically all farms have found themselves insolvent 
because 
of the unequal growth in the price of industrial and 
agricultural output. 
  State programs for the development of land fertility, 
agricultural machine-building, the construction of housing and 
public amenities, roads, and gas, electricity, water supply, and 
telephone communications plants in villages have been wound up. 
  Believing the aforementioned attitudes to reforming the 
agro-industrial complex to be profoundly wrong, the Federation 
Council decrees: 
  1. To instruct the Russian Federation Government: 
  To task the Russian Federation Ministry of Agriculture and 
Foodstuffs and the Russian Academy of Agricultural Sciences, 
together with other interested Russian Federation ministries and 
departments, with doing further work on the state program for 
conducting agrarian reform in the Russian Federation and the 
program for reviving and developing agro-industrial production 
through the year 2000 as quickly as possible. To submit the 
government program for conducting agrarian reform in the Russian 
Federation for examination by the State Duma and the Federation 
Council no later than May 1994, and the program for reviving and 
developing agro-industrial production through the year 2000 no 
later than June 1994; 
  To elaborate and ratify concrete measures of protectionist 
policy for 1994 and 1995, ensuring a solution to the crisis and 
the stabilization of production in the agro-industrial complex; 
  Together with the Russian Federation Central Bank, to 
elaborate conditions for the preferential short-term and 
long-term crediting of the agro-industrial complex. 
  2. Within the process of work on the draft federal law "On 
Agricultural Scientific Institutions and Their Science and 
Production Base," to task the Federation Council Agrarian Policy 
Committee with conducting parliamentary hearings on the 
aforesaid draft law in May-June 1994.

  [Text] Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev arrived in 
Murmansk today. Our correspondent Yuriy Arkhipov reports by 
telephone: 
  [Arkhipov] Andrey Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister and 
Murmansk Oblast's deputy to the State Duma, was met at Murmansk 
airport by the head of the oblast administration, the commander 
of the Northern Fleet, and by representatives from the Russian 
Foreign Ministry in Murmansk. On this occasion, the aim of the 
minister's visit is to take part in Victory Day celebrations. 
  In an interview with journalists at the aircraft steps, he 
congratulated all the defenders of the Polar region on the 
holiday, and underlined that as our people managed to withstand 
the horrors of the 1941-45 war, there is no doubt it will be 
able to overcome today's difficulties. 
  Andrey Kozyrev went straight from the airport to 
Severomorsk, 
where he had a meeting with the officers of the aircraft carrier 
Admiral Nakhimov. An agreement to establish patronage ties 
between the oblast administration and the command of the 
aircraft carrier was signed on board the vessel. Andrey Kozyrev 
took part in the signing ceremony of this agreement. 
  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev also had a 
conversation with Yevgeniy Komarov, head of the administration 
of Murmansk Oblast. The social and economic development of 
Murmansk Oblast based on the resources of the region was 
discussed during the meeting. 
  On 9 May the Russian foreign minister will take part in a 
procession of the inhabitants and guests of the city to the 
monument commemorating the defenders of the Polar zone -- or as 
the northerners call the monument, Alesha -- and lay flowers at 
the monument. In the second half of the day, Andrey Kozyrev 
will fly back to Moscow.

<F P=106> [Report by Natalya Gorodetskaya under the "Caucasus" rubric: </F>
"Chechnya Breaks Relations With Britain. Chechen Opposition 
Starts Talks With Moscow"] 
  [Text] The Chechen Provisional Council has taken on 
responsibility for talks with Russia. In the opposition's view, 
since President Dzhokhar Dudayev does not want to establish 
normal relations with Russia, Moscow will finally have to bring 
troops into the Republic. In the very near future, a delegation 
of the Chechen opposition plans to fly to Moscow to hold talks 
with the Russian Federation Government on "the restoration of 
Chechnya's normal economic existence," as Umar Avturkhanov, 
chairman of the Provisional Council, put it to INTERFAX. The 
opposition bets on Sergey Shakhray, "the Russian Federation 
minister for the affairs of nationalities and regional polities, 
who is disposed to close contacts with them;" a precise date of 
a meeting with him will be known on 10 May. 
  According to Mr. Avturkhanov, the question of Chechnya's 
sovereignty and its political status should be resolved by the 
people at a referendum and by the republic's constitutional 
authorities, elections for which can be held only after the 
situation returns to normal. The Chechen Provisional Council 
has not given up the hope that Ruslan Khasbulatov will join the 
opposition, because he belongs to their side of the barricades. 
Given that the former Supreme Soviet speaker's popularity in 
Chechnya is steadily on the rise, if he returns to politics and 
heads the opposition to Dzhokhar Dudayev, the people will 
"unequivocally rally around him" so as to start building a new 
life under his leadership. 
  Sergey Stepashin, director of the Federal 
Counterintelligence 
Service [FCS], is also inclined to think that economic talks may 
become the main means to straighten out relations between Moscow 
and Groznyy. In his view, this is possible because the talks 
with Chechnya will be held by Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, not Sergey Shakhray. A dialogue with Dzhokhar 
Dudayev, the FCS director believes, should be held "in a tough 
manner," with normalization at railways passing through Chechen 
territory to be a priority matter. However, Mr. Stepashin said 
in Nalchik at a meeting with parliamentarians and government 
members of Kabardino-Balkaria, Boris Yeltsin may meet with 
Dzhokhar Dudayev only if the Chechen president recognizes that 
his republic is part of the Russian Federation. 
  Meanwhile, not only is Chechnya reluctant to identify itself 
as a member of the Russian commonwealth, but it is entering the 
international scene as an independent state. The Chechen 
Foreign Ministry has stated that it will suspend any ties with 
Britain until "legality and the rule of law prevail in that 
country" and will not participate in the CITEX-94 international 
exhibition. So uncompromising a decision has been prompted by 
Britain's attempt "to taint the honor and dignity of the Chechen 
people by accusing them of a vendetta," after it charged 
relatives of the Utsiyev brothers of murdering Karen Reed in 
London. According to a Scotland Yard theory, the Utsiyevs 
arrived in Britain to buy guided missiles so as subsequently to 
resell them to the Azerbaijani side, and were killed by Armenian 
terrorists. Having accused foreign secret services of attempts 
to slander Chechnya, the republic's Foreign Ministry stated: 
"The secret services appear to have an insufficient knowledge 
of customs and traditions of the Chechens, for whom the murder 
of a woman, a child, or an elderly person amounts to a national 
disgrace."

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Gadzhi Shamov] </F>
  [Text] Makhachkala 7 May TASS--The situation in Derbent is 
normalizing thanks to negotiations of leaders of national 
Lezghian and Azeri movements who agreed to hold no more rallies 
and settle all problems through a dialogue. Their joint appeal 
urged residents of Derbent and Dagestan to show restraint, 
wisdom and not yield to nationalist provocations. 
  Lezghian and Azeri rallies were held in Derbent this week 
under nationalist slogans. The rallies were accompanied by 
local clashes and fire exchanges. No casualties were reported. 
The police were sent to resume order. 
  A reason for the rallies was a quarrel between several 
Lezghians and Azeris that resulted in a fight and a fire 
exchange, when two Lezghians were killed and several people, 
including those underaged, wounded. After that a hundred of 
Lezghians blocked the way to the town. 
  A meeting of the Dagestan parliament presidium discussed the 
situation in Derbent and sharply criticized the Derbent 
authorities and the police. New heads of the city 
administration and city interior department were nominated. A 
special government commission is working.

<F P=106> [Unattributed ADS report in the "Incident" column: "Illegal </F>
Border Crossing by Chinese Warships Has Been Prevented. 
Khabarovsk Residents Are Not Going To Cede the Bolshoy 
Ussuriyskiy Island to the Chinese"] 
  [Text] Border guards of the Far Eastern Border District 
have prevented a penetration by five Chinese military vessels. 
As Khabarovsk Kray administration chief Viktor Ishayev told 
SEGODNYA's correspondent, on the afternoon of 1 May Chinese 
vessels, in line formation, were moving in to breach the 
Russian-Chinese border in the area of the Kazakevich outpost, 40 
km from Khabarovsk. 
  Mr. Ishayev demanded that the border district command use 
all 
legitimate means to curb this attempt. As a result of decisive 
actions by patrol boats and vessels of the Amur Flotilla, the 
Chinese military vessels were not allowed across the border. No 
casualties, fighting, or damage are reported. Viktor Ishayev 
said that "these actions by the Chinese side are a provocation 
aimed at infringing the Russian Far East." He related these 
actions directly to the upcoming visit to the PRC by Russian 
Federation Government head Viktor Chernomyrdin scheduled for the 
end of this May. 
  Mr. Ishayev expressed the supposition that the actions by 
Chinese military vessels came as a result of a still unrenounced 
agreement, little known to the wide public, which was signed by 
Mikhail Gorbachev and Aleksandr Bessmertnykh on 14 May 1991. 
Article 8 of this agreement says, "Chinese vessels of all 
types, including military, may navigate the Amur freely. The 
rules of navigation will be elaborated by the competent bodies 
of the two countries additionally." Because the rules of 
navigation have not as yet been worked out, military vessels as 
well as civilian steamships from China will not be allowed into 
Khabarovsk at the Kazakevich checkpoint. 
  Touching on the evolution of Russian-Chinese relations at 
the 
local level, the head of the kray administration believes that 
"at present China is undertaking latent expansion to the Russian 
Far East, infringing and humiliating the Russian people." If 
the treaty signed by the former USSR leaders "is not renounced, 
the administrations of adjacent Far Eastern krays and oblasts 
will take their own measures," he said. According to Mr. 
Ishayev, "the provocation by the military vessels was also a 
demonstration, timed to coincide with the start of work by a 
joint Russian-Chinese demarcation commission on 6 May." 
  As is known, in the process of border revision between 
Russia 
and the PRC the latter has acquired more than 2,000 islands with 
more than 1,000 hectares of arable land. The stumbling block in 
the commission's work is the Bolshoy Ussuriyskiy island with an 
area of 350 sq km, located close to Khabarovsk. On its maps 
published in China the southern neighbor stubbornly marks this 
fertile island as Chinese territory and has an eye to seizing it 
from Russia. According to Viktor Ishayev, however, "the 
residents of Khabarovsk Kray intend to maintain their island by 
any methods."

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Reports by </F>
Diplomatic Correspondents Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and 
others] 
  [Text] Press secretary Levon Zurabyan of Armenian President 
Levon Ter-Petrosyan told INTERFAX that Baku's refusal to 
negotiate a ceasefire on the line of confrontation between the 
Karabakh and Azeri forces proved that Baku's stand on 
Nagorno-Karabakh was short-sighted and that Baku still hoped to 
resolve the Karabakh problem by force. Zurabyan said Baku 
rejected all suggestions and initiatives for a settlement, as 
well as mediation by the Conference on Security and Cooperation 
in Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States and Russia. 
In Zurabyan's view, its own policies led Baku up a blind alley. 
  Zurabyan felt the key to the solution of the Karabakh 
problem 
lay in Baku because Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh had repeatedly 
declared their willingness to negotiate an enduring ceasefire 
accommodation. IF Note: On Thursday the Azeri delegation to a 
two-day conference on Nagorno-Karabakh, held in Bishkek, refused 
to sign a protocol with a call for the introduction of a 
cease-fire as of 0000 on 9 May. The other participants in the 
two-day negotiations -- Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh, Russia and 
Kyrgyzstan -- signed the protocol. Baku rejects the document 
that makes no mention of the Armenian occupation of part of 
Azerbaijan and allows for the creation and introduction of a 
Commonwealth peacekeeping contingent in the disputed area. In 
addition, Baku suggested that the protocol, signed by 
Nagorno-Karabakh as a whole, must also be signed by Karabakh's 
Azeri community. The suggestion was rejected. 
  Chairmen Babken Ararktsyan and Karen Baburyan of the 
Armenian 
and Karabakh parliaments told their Kyrgyz counterpart Medetkhan 
Sherimkulov in Bishkek Friday that on return to their home 
places they would work for a cease-fire in the zone of the 
Armenian-Azeri conflict. 
  Sherimkulov, who chairs the Karabakh peacekeeping group of 
the Commonwealth's Interparliamentary Assembly, sees what 
Ararktsyan and Baburyan told him as response to his request for 
the unilateral introduction of a ceasefire at 0000 on 9 May. 
Sherimkulov intends to address Baku with a similar request. 
  Ararktsyan praised the results of the Bishkek conference and 
told INTERFAX that the Armenians would take unilateral action to 
implement the Bishkek protocol. He hoped Baku would realize the 
impossibility of resolving the conflict by force.

  [Text] Yerevan, 5 May (SNARK)--What solution of the 
Karabakh problem is the best? This question has been asked to 
1,200 Yerevan residents by the Sociological Research Center of 
the Armenian Academy of Sciences. Over 40 percent responded 
that Nagorno-Karabakh has to become an independent state, 30 
percent told that Karabakh must become a part of Armenia, 24.4 
percent decided that Karabakh shall be included in Russia. A 
little over 4 percent think that Karabakh needs to be integrated 
in the Caucasus Federation. 
  Notably, only 0.6 percent of respondents voted for Karabakh 
autonomy within Azerbaijan, and another 0.4 percent told that it 
has to remain a part of Azerbaijan. 
  The poll has been carried out in the first half of April by 
USIA order.

  [Text] Yerevan, 7 MAY (SNARK) -- Though Nagorno-Karabakh 
has not been recognized de jure as a party involved in conflict, 
however de facto this has been recorded during the Bishkek 
summit, told the journalists in Yerevan today the Chairman of 
Armenian Parliament Babken Ararktsyan. By his words, the 
participants of this meeting came to a general opinion that 
there wouldn't be any progress in peaceful resolution of problem 
if Karabakh is not recognized as a conflicting party. 
  Giving an answer to the SNARK question, why did Azerbaijan 
refuse to sign the Bishkek protocol, Ararktsyan observed: "I 
think Azerbaijan has not yet developed a distinct political 
course, and not only with respect to Karabakh." At the same 
time, the Speaker thought unlikely the new escalation of 
military conflict in the nearest time.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Tigran Liloyan] </F>
  [Text] Yerevan, 7 May -- Vagan Avakyan, former first deputy 
chief adviser on security issues to the Armenian president, was 
arrested in Moscow's Sheremetevo airport on Friday [6 May]. He 
was in Bulgaria, where he gave a number of interviews and made a 
number of statements sharply criticizing the Armenian 
leadership. The Armenian authorities had earlier sanctioned the 
arrest of the former high-ranking official, and he was put on 
the "wanted" list. According to information that is as yet 
unconfirmed, Avakyan was expelled by the Bulgarian authorities 
at the request of the Armenian side and was arrested on arrival 
in Moscow by staff of the State National Security Directorate of 
Armenia. It was announced here that he was taken to Yerevan on 
Friday evening. 
  Avakyan is charged with attempting to take state secrets out 
of Armenia. His spouse, who was taking six computer discs 
containing secret information to her husband, was detained at 
Yerevan airport in February. The investigation that is under 
way is to determine what Avakyan's aim was in gathering, 
storing, and attempting to take out secret material with the 
help of his wife, and also to what country and to what services 
he intended to hand the information over to and who his 
accomplices are, the leadership of Armenia's security department 
reported in March. 
  Avakyan used to be the first deputy to Ashot Manucharyan 
[presidential adviser on national security], one of the members 
of the Karabakh committee who was sharply critical of Levon 
Ter-Petrosyan and his administration's political course when he 
left the entourage of the Armenian president. In reply to this 
criticism, Armenian Internal Affairs Minister Vanik Siradegyan, 
another member of the Karabakh committee, publicly accused 
Manucharyan of supporting criminal elements and mafia 
structures. The minister named Avakyan among those who enjoyed 
Manucharyan's protection. According to the internal affairs 
minister, Avakyan is involved in taking abroad and spending 
large sums of hard currency intended for aid to Nagornyy 
Karabakh [Nagorno-Karabakh].

  [Text] Yerevan -- The energy system of Armenia, in its time 
one of the best in the former USSR, now is on the decline, 
declared Miron Shishmanyan, Armenian Minister of Energy and 
Fuel, at the International Energy Conference, held in Yerevan. 
  In his opinion, the main ways of overcoming the crisis are 
re-opening of the Armenian Nuclear Station, optimum usage of the 
acting thermal plants and hydro-stations, building of the gas 
pipeline and high-voltage line from Iran to Armenia. It's also 
very important to stimulate fuel import to Armenia and to build 
here an oil-refining plant. Mr. Shishmanyan also mentioned the 
importance of using nontraditional sources of energy. 
  He reported that the European Bank has already given 57 
million dollars for the reconstruction and expansion of the 
Hrazdan Thermal Plant. As to the Iran-Armenia gas pipeline, the 
sides are preparing to sign the final agreement on its building.

  [Text] The Bishkek protocol on settlement of the 
Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict, which was signed Thursday [5 May] 
by the heads of parliamentary delegations from Russia, Armenia, 
Kyrgyzstan, and representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh, remains 
open for signing. Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the Federation 
Council, believes that Azerbaijan will also accede to the treaty 
soon. RIA reports him as saying this today at a Moscow news 
conference. 
  Vladimir Shumeyko believes that the main obstacle preventing 
Azerbaijan from signing the Bishkek agreement is the problem of 
de facto recognition of Nagorno-Karabakh as an independent party 
to the conflict. The leader of the upper house of parliament 
considers that a cease-fire in the conflict zone will only be 
possible when Azerbaijan recognizes Nagorno-Karabakh's 
independence.

  [Text] The Armenian and Nagorno-Karabakh parliament 
speakers Babken Ararktsiyan and Karen Baburiyan said during the 
meeting with Kyrgyz Parliament Speaker Medetkan Sherimkulov in 
Bishkek Friday that they would take steps on their return home 
to achieve a cease-fire in the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict 
zone. 
  Sherimkulov, who is also the chairman of the CIS 
Interparliamentary Assembly's peacekeeping group for 
Nagorno-Karabakh, told Interfax that both speakers had made the 
pledge in response to his own call for a unilateral cease-fire 
in the conflict zone beginning midnight on 9 May. 
  The cease-fire would, he said, involve an agreement like the 
one which would have been achieved at the recent meeting in 
Bishkek on 4-5 May (on the settlement of the Karabakh conflict) 
had Azerbaijan not refused to sign the relevant protocol after 
objecting to some of the document's items. 
  Sherimkulov announced that he would also meet with 
Azerbaijani representatives and repeat his request for a 
cease-fire from on 6 May. 
  He said the next round of talks on Nagorno-Karabakh would 
take place in St. Petersburg at the beginning of June. 
  The Armenian speaker, who had been impressed by the Bishkek 
meeting, assured Interfax in an interview that the Armenian 
party would be "putting the protocol signed in Bishkek into 
effect" unilaterally. 
  He stressed that the "Azerbaijanis have once again displayed 
their unwillingness to solve the Karabakh issue by political 
means." However, Ararktsiyan said he was hopeful that Baku would 
appreciate that the conflict could not be resolved by force.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Tigran Liloyan] </F>
  [Text] Yerevan, 8 May -- The Nagorno-Karabakh leadership 
today gave the order to its forces to cease-fire unilaterally 
along the entire front at midnight of 8-9 May. Stepanakert is 
thereby demonstrating its respect for the appeal addressed to 
the warring sides by participants in the Bishkek meeting of CIS 
parliamentarians on a settlement in Nagorno-Karabakh. The 
ITAR-TASS correspondent was informed of this in the 
Nagorno-Karabakh Republic press and information department. 
  It was reported from Stepanakert at the same time that this 
morning the Azerbaijani side embarked upon a large-scale 
offensive in the north of Markadertskiy Rayon towards the 
villages of Chailu, Leninavan, and Karmiravan. The press 
service of the Karabakh Army staff has announced that its 
subunits "are successfully repulsing all attacks by the enemy, 
inflicting on the enemy tangible losses in men and military 
equipment." 
  According to official sources in Stepanakert, positional 
exchanges of fire and localized fighting took place on other 
sectors of the Karabakh front last night and this morning.

  [Text] Baku (6 May) TURAN--The refusal by Azerbaijan to 
sign the final document for the regulation of the 
Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict irritated Russian's political 
circles which was the initiator of the meeting. "We were not 
able to obtain from Azerbaijan official recognition of 
Nagorno-Karabakh, which is a partner to the conflict side, but 
attempts in this direction will continue", said a senior 
officials of the Russian Parliament in his conversation with a 
TURAN correspondent. The same source notes that Moscow will do 
its best to achieve this purpose and "will use means not only of 
a diplomatic character." 
  According to information made available to TURAN's 
correspondent in Moscow by Russian Parliament sources, in 
Bishkek's document a cease fire from midnight on 8 May is 
provided for, whence after the fighting sides will cease 
military actions in the region. A de-blockading of 
energy-transportation communications together with the 
separation of troops is also included in the provisions. 
  In the Bishkek document, the term "fighting sides" means 
only 
Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  In the protocol there lacks a concrete definition of the 
mechanism which provides for the return of hundreds of thousands 
of Azeri refugees to their homes. 
  In the document there is also an appeal to the CIS about 
sending peace making forces of the CIS to the conflict area. 
  According to TURAN, Azerbaijan refused to sign the Bishkek 
document because the Bishkek document does not consider the 
total withdrawal by Armenian units from Azeri-occupied 
territories. Rather is only the separation of sides along the 
frontline. 
  Another reason for Azerbaijan's non-signing is because the 
protocol envisages the stationing of supervisory posts of 
Russian army in Nagorno-Karabakh. Azerbaijan thinks that the 
location of separation forces can be achieved only after the 
liberation of all occupied territories. 
  The protocol also calls for the creation of a security zone, 
which in fact spans the territory of western Azerbaijan from the 
Kura River to the Araks River. Azerbaijan will have less 
control over this territory, thereby forcing Baku to reconcile 
its loss of control over this part of the territory, including 
Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  Another main point raised during this meeting was the 
refusal 
to permit the Azeri representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh to be a 
separate participant in the negotiations surrounding the Bishkek 
document. Neither the Russians, nor the Armenians want to allow 
the Azeri representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh to participate in 
the negotiations as a separate entity. "If the right to sign 
the document is conceded to Armenian community of 
Nagorno-Karabakh, then the same right should be given to the 
Azerbaijan community of Nagorno-Karabakh whose leader is 
Shusha's Mayor Nizami Bakhmanov," said Afiaddin Dzhalilov, the 
vice-speaker of the Azerbaijani Parliament. 
  The Azerbaijani delegation also stated that the proposed 
document does not reflect the fact that Azeri territory is 
"occupied." There is only mention that these territories have 
been "captured." According to Dzhalilov, such an interpretation 
is a misrepresentation of the political and legal nature of the 
conflict. The next meeting for the regulation of the conflict 
will be held in St Petersburg.

  [Text] Moscow 6 May TASS -- "We should proceed immediately 
to forming CIS peacekeeping forces," chairman of the 
Commonwealth Inter-parliamentary Assembly Vladimir Shumeyko said 
today. 
  He told a press conference in the Federation Council that 
some 15 thousand Russian servicemen are now engaged in 
peacekeeping actions. This is a heavy burden for Russia, but 
some politicians accuse the country of imperial ambitions, 
Shumeyko said. 
  According to him, it is necessary to build peacekeeping 
forces which comprise representatives of all Commonwealth 
countries. This view is shared by parliamentarians of a number 
of the Commonwealth states. Shumeyko said this would reduce 
wrong ideas concerning Russian troops in public mentality and 
dispel allegations about Russia's intervention in the internal 
affairs of the Commonwealth member-states.

<F P=106> [Report by Yuriy Selivanov in the "Ukraine" column: "To </F>
Break Is Not To Build. Kiev Is Trying To Torpedo the CIS 
Collective Security System"] 
  [Text] A recent visit to Kiev by Estonia Defense Minister 
Indrek Kannik continued the series of Ukraine's bilateral 
military contacts with various CIS states. His Ukrainian 
counterpart Vitaliy Radetskyy promised the Estonian minister to 
share some of Ukraine's surplus arms. That there is really 
something to share is proved by a figure cited in his time by 
Colonel General Boris Pyankov, Russian Federation deputy defense 
minister: There are 15 million automatic small arms alone in 
Ukraine's arsenals. A little earlier a representative 
delegation led by Col. Gen. Ivan Oleynik, Ukraine deputy defense 
minister, visited Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. During the talks 
with the leadership of the national armies in these countries, 
expansion of bilateral military collaboration was discussed. In 
particular Ukraine expressed its readiness to resolve the 
question of returning to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan their 
military equipment which since the disintegration of the Union 
has stayed at Ukraine's maintenance factories. Right at the 
negotiating table, the Kiev paper HOLOS UKRAYINY reports, orders 
were issued to prepare military trains for shipment. The 
Ukrainian side expressed the readiness not only to make 
available its maintenance facilities to the Uzbekistan and 
Kazakhstan military departments but also to upgrade their 
existing armaments. For its part, Ukraine showed interest in 
ensuring the maintenance of its military transport aircraft at 
Uzbekistan enterprises. 
  Commenting on the results of the Ukraine Defense Ministry 
delegation's visit to the Central Asian countries, the Ukrainian 
press states with satisfaction that the sides have come to an 
understanding that full-scale relations between their military 
departments should be formalized by direct treaties on military 
cooperation at head of state level. Such an unequivocal accent 
on the bilateral character of military ties promoted by Ukraine 
is seen by observers as Kiev's attempt to thwart Moscow's 
efforts to create a collective security system. The Ukrainian 
leaders read into the latter primarily "the imperial ambitions" 
of Russia which, in their opinion, is seeking to turn the other 
CIS countries into its exclusive "sphere of influence." Kiev is 
concerned that some of the former Soviet republics are showing 
increasing readiness to be inside such a "sphere," which will 
allow them substantially to improve both their financial and 
economic and military-political situation. 
  Ukraine, whose leadership treasures above all its 
independence from Moscow, is running the risk of finding itself 
in a military- political isolation that can hardly be offset 
even by its participation in the NATO Partnership for Peace 
program. It is hard to imagine that the "counter-game" played 
by Kiev, whose ultimate goal is to torpedo the "pro-Moscow" 
collective security system and to surround Russia with a kind of 
"cordon sanitaire" formed with states minimally linked to it, 
would be crowned with success. The geopolitical contestants' 
weight categories are too different and moreover, the situation 
of the Kiev regime, oriented toward "super-independence," is 
such that hardly anyone in the CIS would wish seriously to get 
involved with it. 
  In any event, Ukraine failed to engage into an anti-Russian 
military political game Georgia and Azerbaijan which, in spite 
of Kiev's readiness to continue to render them the broadest 
possible military assistance, nonetheless preferred to develop 
relations with Moscow, including joining the CIS and agreeing to 
the deployment of Russian military bases on their territory.

  [Text] Moscow May 7 TASS -- "NATO's Partnership for Peace 
programme cannot suit Russia. A more serious programme of 
cooperation is needed to correspond to Russia's status and 
special conditions in which we will carry out partnership with 
NATO," Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said. 
  In an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS on Saturday, 
Kozyrev 
said that "our cooperation cannot be the same as with middle and 
small European countries." 
  "We believe that there must not be deviation towards 
NATO-centrism or NATOmania. With all our respect for that 
organisation we proceed from the fact that it is only one of 
many which exist on the continent," Kozyrev said. 
  He said Russia will present NATO at the end of May with its 
own concept of European security. The minister stressed that 
this will not be an alternative to the Partnership for Peace. 
Russia's position on that matter will be outlined by Russian 
Defence Minister Pavel Grachev at a meeting with NATO defence 
ministers on May 24, Kozyrev said.

  [Text] Murmansk 8 May TASS -- "Russia does not reject 
partnership with NATO. But it should be partnership on an equal 
basis," Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said in an 
exclusive interview with TASS on Sunday. 
  "This has been and will be our concept in foreign policy," 
he 
stressed. 
  The foreign minister, who was elected to the Russian 
Parliament's Lower House from the Murmansk constituency, arrived 
earlier in the day in this city in northern Russia on a trip 
related to his deputy's duties. 
  Elaborating on Russia's role in the pan-European process, 
Kozyrev said: "We are not a weak country. We do not have any 
inferiority complexes. Therefore we are ready for cooperation 
with NATO as an equal partner." 
  According to the Russian diplomat, the agreement on Russia's 
joining NATO's Partnership for Peace programme, was not signed 
in April as scheduled because of "the need to finalize the 
document offered to us." 
  "I believe we will go ahead with signing not only this 
framework document, even not this framework document at all, but 
a broader and more comprehensive programme of cooperation 
between Russia and NATO," the foreign minister emphasised.

<F P=106> ["Own information" report: "Ames Instilled Fear"] </F>
  [Text] As has already been reported, the (recently) 
high-ranking CIA staffer Aldrich Ames has been sentenced to life 
imprisonment. This, it is said, is for his link with the 
Russian special services, which caused unprecedented damage to 
U.S. security. We have managed to obtain some of A. Ames' 
statements from competent sources. Here they are -- at first 
hand, as the saying goes. 
  In a statement in court Ames sharply criticized the 
government in connection with the fact the unprecedented 
pressure which it brought to bear on his wife, Rosario Ames, in 
fact pushing her to perjure herself. (It is known that the 
authorities tried to accuse her of complicity in espionage). 
Noting that he deeply regrets the grief he has caused his 
family, Ames said: "I managed for seven and one half of my 10 
years' cooperation with the KGB and the Foreign Intelligence 
Service to conceal the fact successfully from my wife. When 
Rosario, as a result of a mistake I made, found out about my 
criminal activity, she demanded I break off relations with the 
Russians. I was able to put the necessary pressure on her, 
right up to blackmail, to defer that step." 
  Explaining the reasons why he passed on to the KGB 
information about CIA agents and other intelligence departments, 
Ames noted: 
  "First at the time I disagreed with the strengthening of the 
extreme right-wing forces in our political spectrum and with 
U.S. policy in the field of ensuring national security and in 
the international sphere. Second, I had reached the conclusion 
that espionage as it was practised by the CIA and some other 
U.S. departments has been and remains cheating in the interests 
of a group of careerist bureaucrats who are successfully 
misleading several generations of U.S. politicians and citizens 
regarding the need for and value of their work. There has not 
been and is not any justifiable need to have thousands of 
intelligence officers and tens of thousands of agents throughout 
the world, particularly in friendly countries. The information 
received by our vast network of agents at the cost of 
considerable human and moral efforts is mostly of no special 
importance and does not meet politicians' requirements. 
  "Thanks to the efforts of the CIA and the FBI the leadership 
had a very good idea of the real state of affairs in the special 
services of the 'Soviet bloc' countries. Nonetheless, on the 
pretext of the need to conceal from the enemy the true scale of 
our agents' penetration of those states' special organs, for 
decades it instilled unbridled hysteria over the aggressiveness 
of their intelligence services." 
  Does that mean that CIA supermen exist only in movie

  [Text] Western special services are continuing to display 
a special interest in Nizhniy Novgorod, which in the past was 
one of the most tightly closed of Soviet cities. In 1993 alone, 
according to the information of the Federal Counterintelligence 
Service Directorate for Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast, 37 trained 
spies were discovered among the numerous guests from abroad who 
regularly came to the "cradle" of Russian capitalism, as well as 
125 people involved in the special services. The 
"cloak-and-dagger knights" are attracted to military-industrial 
complex installations, research by scientists, and the leaders 
of political parties. But the most important thing is the 
Arzamas-16 Federal Nuclear Center.

  [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin gave his backing to 
the policy aimed at restoring peace and security in Tajikistan 
and at democratic reforms in the republic during his meeting 
with Chairman of the Tajik Supreme Soviet Emomali Rakhmonov in 
Moscow today. 
  The Russian-Tajik joint communique released by the Russian 
Foreign Ministry said the two leaders had stressed the 
importance of the first round of the talks between the Tajik 
government and the Tajik opposition. These talks on national 
reconciliation bring hope for a peace settlement of the 
conflict, the statement underlined. 
  Yeltsin supported the position of the Tajik leadership 
seeking continuation of the dialogue in order to establish a 
democratic Tajikistan. This requires firm agreements on putting 
an end to hostilities, on restoration and strengthening of 
mutual confidence and on free return of all refugees to their 
native land. 
  The communique emphasized that the parties had been deeply 
concerned over the tense situation on the Tajik-Afghan border 
and in Afghanistan and over the continuing armed provocations 
from Afghan territory which threatened security in the whole 
region. 
  The parties urged the Afghan military-political groups to 
seek peace and accord in the country and to create atmosphere of 
cooperation between the region's countries. 
  Yeltsin and Rakhmonov pointed out the important stabilizing 
role played by the joint peacekeeping forces in Tajikistan. 
They said joint efforts on defense of the southern borders and 
primarily of the Tajik-Afghan section conformed with the 
interests of all CIS states. 
  When discussing economic cooperation between Russia and 
Tajikistan, Rakhmonov asked the Russian leadership to speed up 
consideration of the issue on merging of the two countries' 
monetary systems. He confirmed that Tajikistan was carrying out 
its obligations on establishment of a single financial space. 
It was decided that the Tajik and the Russian governments would 
continue to work on the issue. 
  Russia said it was ready to continue economic and 
humanitarian aid to Tajikistan and to enhance cooperation 
between the two countries in order to develop their economic 
potential and to meet social needs of the Tajik population.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Moscow 7 May TASS -- A statement of the Russian 
Foreign Ministry on the Tajik-Afghan border situation was 
circulated here today. 
  The statement runs as follows: 
  "The Russian Federation together with Commonwealth 
member-states is taking political steps to stabilize the 
situation on the Tajik-Afghan border and throughout Tajikistan, 
including the assistance to the inter-Tajik dialogue held under 
the U.N. aegis. 
  "At the same time, some forces are not interested in 
peaceful 
settlement of Tajik problems. Heads of several irreconcilable 
opposition groups from the Tajik Islamic Revival Movement are 
getting ready to launch the so-called spring-summer `offensive' 
to begin with armed provocations on the Tajik-Afghan border in 
the immediate future. 
  "Bearing this in mind, the Russian Foreign Ministry 
considers 
it necessary to state that the planned armed provocations are 
described by the Russian leadership as a threat to security of 
both Tajikistan and Russia, as well as all member-states of the 
Commonwealth. 
  "The Russian Foreign Ministry warns the Afghan authorities 
and leaders of Tajik opposition groups against armed 
provocations from Afghan territory that threaten security of 
Tajikistan and collective security of Commonwealth member-states. 
  "The Russian Foreign Ministry states that the Russian 
Federation together with other Commonwealth member-states will 
do their best to prevent further aggravation of the Tajik-Afghan 
border situation and take adequate measures in case of armed 
provocations."

  [Text] On Saturday Russian President Boris Yeltsin and 
Defense Minister Pavel Grachev sent congratulation telegrams due 
to the forthcoming Victory Day addressed to the chairman of the 
Sevastopol city council of people's deputies Viktor Semenov, 
residents of Sevastopol, and the Black Sea Fleet mariners. 
  Having congratulated the Sevastopol residents and the Black 
Sea Fleet mariners with the Victory Day and with the 50th 
anniversary of the liberation of the city from German fascists, 
Yeltsin stressed in his telegram that Sevastopol, the major base 
of the Black Sea Fleet, "is one of the national sacred places 
for all Russians" which "strengthens the force and the spirit of 
the Russian people and gives them a hope for the best future." 
"Eternal glory to those heroes who defended the freedom and 
independence of Sevastopol," says the president's telegram. 
  For his part, Pavel Grachev pointed out that despite "the 
difficult times" which Sevastopol is experiencing now "neither 
economic difficulties, nor political contradictions, nor painful 
problems related to the Black Sea Fleet division should darken 
this bright holiday." 
  "During my recent visit to Sevastopol I was made sure of the 
strong will of the residents of this hero-city and saw how its 
residents trust that their city would be the major base of the 
well known Black Sea Fleet," Grachev underlined.

  [Text] Sochi, 6 May -- During meetings between Russian 
Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Pastukhov, Russian Deputy Defense 
Minister Georgiy Kondratyev, and the leadership of Abkhazia, an 
understanding was reached that peacekeeping forces should be 
introduced along the confrontation line and not on the entire 
territory of Abkhazia, as the Georgian side was insisting. 
  Today, the Abkhazian Information and Press Ministry informed 
an ITAR-TASS correspondent about this and noted that these 
consultations pursued the goal of agreeing the positions of the 
sides on the eve of a regular round of the Georgian-Abkhazian 
talks, which should be held in Moscow on 11 May.

  [Text] Moscow, 6 May -- Russia is ready to continue to 
contribute to the settlement of the regional conflict in 
Karabakh and is counting on the support of CSCE, UN, and other 
organizations, Andrey Kozyrev said today at a meeting with the 
Swedish diplomat Jan Eliasson who heads the CSCE peace 
conference on Nagornyy Karabakh [Nagorno-Karabakh]. According 
to Russia's foreign minister, "the cooperation between the 
Russian intermediary and CSCE is improving" in the sphere of 
unblocking the situation and their efforts are mutually 
complementary. 
  Andrey Kozyrev stressed Russia's special interest in putting 
an end to the Karabakh conflict because its links with the 
region have deep historical roots. In his words, "we cannot 
remain indifferent." The leading Russian diplomat said that 
other countries were taking an active part in discussing the 
issue. In particular, the situation in Nagornyy Karabakh was 
touched upon during his working meeting with Karl Bildt, the 
Swedish head of government, in St. Petersburg on Thursday [5 
May]. Andrey Kozyrev said to Jan Eliasson: "Although you are 
representing the CSCE here rather than Sweden, nevertheless, we 
are pleased to say that we have reached an understanding on this 
matter on the bilateral level as well."

<F P=106> [Pavel Felgengauer report in the "Maneuvers" column: "The </F>
Russian Army Is Ready for Battle. Exercises To Repulse Attack 
on Former Koenigsberg"] 
  [Text] At the end of April, from the 24th through the 
29th, the forces of the Leningrad Military District, jointly 
with the troops of the Kaliningrad Special District, held large 
scale military exercises called North-West. On the small 
territory of the Kaliningrad enclave substantial forces are 
concentrated today: the command and the main base of the Baltic 
Fleet, the 11th Combined-Arms Army, Air Force and Air Defense 
units, and so forth. Russia's armed outpost in the west still 
appears a strategically vulnerable point on the map, however, 
separated from the main territory of the Russian Federation by 
two independent states. 
  If any serious adversary were to attack what remains of the 
former west Prussia, now populated by Slavs, it would have to be 
defended just like Sevastopol in its time, by uniting the forces 
of the Baltic Fleet, the Army, the Air Force, and the Air 
Defense Force under single command. It was to test in practice 
the possibility of such "territorial" unification of forces and 
fire to repulse air, ground, and sea (with the landing of 
assault units) attack that the North-West exercises, 
unprecedented in scale, were conducted, given the financial 
squeeze on the Russian army (11,000 servicemen and 2,000 pieces 
of equipment). 
  According to General Staff Chief General Kolesnikov, "on the 
whole, the exercises have passed successfully." Only Baltic 
Fleet Commander Admiral Yegorov did not act confidently enough. 
Mikhail Kolesnikov, however, believes that following the 
experience of World War II, navy leaders should not be appointed 
commanders in ground defense operations. 
  At the same time, a new territorial principle of organizing 
air defense on the military operations theater was tested, as 
was the troops' capabilities to repulse a limited missile 
attack, for which purpose an early missile attack warning system 
was used. Apparently the principle of single theater air 
defense will be adopted as fundamental, but speaking at a 
briefing in the Defense Ministry, Gen. Kolesnikov specially 
stressed that "the Air Defense Force will remain the fifth 
branch of the Armed Forces; at any rate, until 1996." 
  In the course of the maneuvers the Russian military did not 
interact -- nor was such interaction planned -- with the newly 
raised small armies of the Baltic countries. The Russian 
military leadership is seeking independence. In particular Gen. 
Kolesnikov promised that in 1996 the first launching will be 
made from the Svobodnyy space center in the Far East and as a 
result the Armed Forces will have no further need for Baykonur. 
"This will not call for any additional resources." The Russian 
Space Agency can use Baykonur independently, without Defense 
Ministry assistance (20,000 servicemen of the Space Forces will 
be evacuated to Russia). 
  Yet the military department is seeking independence, not 
full 
isolation. The campaign in the Duma against joint U.S.-Russian 
peacekeeping command and staff exercises on the Totsk test site 
only annoys the top military leadership, owing to the 
politicians' total incompetence in military matters. The 
General Staff chief believes that "public opinion is being 
provoked deliberately by people who do not know or pretend not 
to know what command and staff exercises are." 
  The General Staff continues to downsize the army. According 
to Gen. Kolesnikov, by early 1995 the authorized strength of the 
Armed Forces will be under 2 million people. In the context of 
manpower and money shortages, the limited resources are directed 
"selectively" to the Strategic Nuclear Forces and Airborne 
Forces units. However, if only the Strategic Nuclear Forces, 
the Early Missile Attack Warning System, and the Airborne Forces 
remain in the army, further troop and budget cuts can sharply 
lower the threshold of a nuclear conflict.

out then the 2,500 Russian servicemen presently stationed on the 
territory of that Baltic state will remain there as long as 
necessary, Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev stated at a 
news conference today. He warned the Estonian side: 
  [Grachev] If this situation changes, then it will not take 
long to reinforce this group in order to guard and defend 
Russian military sites securely. 
  [Ivlev] The Estonian authorities' policies toward the 
Russian-speaking population was called apartheid by Pavel 
Grachev. 
  [Grachev] They are dividing them into black and white, brown 
and red, green and blue. What is this? So what if by 
nationality he is Russian? He was born and grew up there, or he 
has lived there for 30 or 40 years. That is his land as well 
when it comes down to it. It is not permissible for anyone to 
throw him out his own country. 
  [Ivlev] Pavel Grachev also touched on the issue of Russia's 
attitude to the Partnership for Peace program that, in his 
opinion, is not entirely suitable for our country. 
  [Grachev] You know, we came to the conclusion why should we 
not, Russia, put forward our own partnership concept. What, are 
we worse than the others when it comes down to it? 
  [Ivlev] A group of Russian scholars are to prepare proposals 
on this by 15 May that will then be examined by a Russian 
Security Council session. If they are approved then they will 
be announced by Pavel Grachev on 24 May at NATO's headquarters 
in Brussels.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Biryukov] </F>
  [Text] Kaliningrad 8 May TASS -- Petr Shirshov, chairman of 
the Russian parliament committee on security and defence, who 
was in Kaliningrad, the westernmost city of Russia, expressed 
concern over difficulties raised by the Baltic states to 
frustrate the normal operations of Russian troops stationed in 
the Kaliningrad Region. 
  A delegation of the Russian parliament upper chamber he 
heads 
was here on a fact-finding mission to inspect combat 
preparedness and every-day life of units of land troops and the 
Baltic Fleet stationed here. 
  The delegation visited the main naval base in Baltiysk where 
legislators were guests of the Nastoychivyy destroyer sailors 
and marines and participated in an anniversary meeting of the 
region's veterans and the public, which was devoted to the V-Day. 
  Delegation members discussed problems of combat training and 
social programmes for troops at meetings with the leadership of 
the region, the Baltic Fleet, the Army, Border Guards and 
Air-Defence Forces. 
  Shirshov said that his trip was a followup of the recent 
visit to the Kaliningrad Region by parliament's upper chamber 
speaker Vladimir Shumeyko who came forth with an initiative to 
set up here a combined group of troops of limited strength. 
  The idea was backed by the Russian Defence Ministry and is 
to 
be formalised legislatively. "The task of this group is to 
ensure adequate combat preparedness of this Russian territory," 
Shirshov stressed. 
  "Nobody should doubt that it is an inalienable territory of 
our country, a successor of the former Soviet Union, to which it 
was transferred according to the decision of the Potsdam 
Conference 50 years ago," Shirshov stressed. 
  The delegation departed from Kaliningrad for Moscow on 
Sunday.

  [Text] The Chechen Republic intends to keep from any 
relations with Britain in the future until the law and order 
conforming with world standards be established in the United 
Kingdom. This was stated by the Chechen Foreign Ministry today. 
  The Chechen Foreign Ministry said Britain had tried to stain 
the honor and dignity of the Chechen people blaming it for a 
vendetta. 
  "Unwilling to cause any additional troubles and problems for 
the Britain [as received] and in order to avoid new provocations 
and incidents unpleasant for Britain," Chechnya decided not to 
participate in the Sytex-94 international exhibition. 
  The Chechen president's service told Interfax that the 
statement was due to the assassination of Karin Reed in London. 
Karin Reed was a relative of an Armenian terrorist 
Ter-Oganesyan who had taken part in the assassination of the 
Utsiyev brothers. Currently, he is serving a life-sentence in a 
British prison. After the assassination of Karin Reed several 
London editions suggested that this had been a vendetta on the 
part of relatives of the Utsiyev brothers sent to Britain more 
than a year before and killed by Armenian terrorists. 
  The official reason for the Utsiyevs' trip to London was to 
legalize the order for printing Chechen currency units and 
stamps. Scotland Yard suggested that the Utsiyevs had come to 
Britain in order to buy missiles and to re-sell them to the 
Azerbaijani party. 
  Blaming the foreign special services for attempts to 
discredit Chechnya, the Chechen Foreign Minister stated that the 
British special services seemed not to know well enough customs 
and traditions of "Chechens for whom the assassination of a 
woman an elderly person or a child is a national disgrace."

<F P=106> [Report by Vasiliy Kononenko: "The Problem of the Troop </F>
Withdrawal From Germany Is Provoking Needless Tension, the 
Russian Foreign Ministry Believes"] 
  [Text] The problem of the withdrawal of Russian troops 
from Germany, which, on the eve of B. Yeltsin's visit, is 
causing increasing tension due to a planned send-off scenario, 
which is supposedly humiliating to veterans and to all Russians, 
is seen differently in official circles. 
  We learned from the Russian Foreign Ministry that while this 
scenario was being formulated, there were no differences in the 
sides' approaches. An understanding was reached between B. 
Yeltsin and H. Kohl that the send-off for the Russian troops 
would be organized no less ceremonially than the send-off for 
the three Western countries' troops. The president repeatedly 
drew to the chancellor's attention the extent to which this 
episode impinges on the feelings of Russians, especially 
veterans. 
  Calls to demand from the German side a joint withdrawal of 
the former allied troops are unfounded. Under the four-power 
agreement, our troops are supposed to be withdrawn by 31 August, 
and the three Western countries' troops by a later date. For 
this reason, it is neither legally nor ethically valid to insist 
on a change in this scenario, the Foreign Ministry believes. 
  As for B. Yeltsin's upcoming talks with H. Kohl, certain 
details of the send-off will be clarified there. The 
culmination of the ceremonies will be in the presence of the 
German and Russian leaders in Weimar and Berlin. Nobody 
disputes these proposals.

  [Text] The sharpest problems of the Russian-German 
trade-economic relations are to be discussed in the course of 
Boris Yeltsin's visit to Germany scheduled for 11-13 May, expert 
of the Russian Foreign Economic Relations Ministry Aleksandr 
Sokol told INTERFAX. In his opinion, the upcoming visit will 
primarily be of "an economic nature." 
  As before, Germany remains Russia's most important business 
partner and major "currency donor," underlined Sokol. In 
general, the trade-economic relations between two countries are 
developing favorably, however, several problems which hinder 
their further development, have accumulated over the last period 
of time. First of all, it is the problem of Russia's debt. 
Currently it exceeds 50 billion dollars. This sum includes the 
earlier granted credits which cannot be repaid due to a number 
of reasons. 
  Along with the state debt there exists the so called 
"commercial debt" of the Russian enterprises to several German 
firms for the delivered goods amounting to 1.2 billion dollars. 
  One more problem related to the previous two ones concerns 
credit granted to Russia under the guarantee of the German 
insurance company Germes. Since 1991 all previous credits 
totalling DM 18.4 billion have been allocated on preferential 
conditions with a 10-year delay in payment. Since 1994 the 
company Germes passed a decision to annul all benefits with 
respect to Russia and to issue export guarantees in accordance 
with the international practice with an advanced payment 
amounting to 15 percent of the contract's value due to the 
growth of Russian debt. Because of this circumstance the 
majority of Russian enterprises cannot use the credit line of 
the company Germes now. As a result, the Russian government has 
not passed its decision on utilization of the DM 2.5 billion 
credit allocated by the German party for Russia in 1994 under 
the guarantee of the German insurance company. 
  Meanwhile, the absence of preferential credits can lead to 
diminishing of Russian import from Germany and to the reduction 
of turnover between two countries as a whole; both parties 
recognize that this does not meet their interests. 
  The Russian Foreign Economic Relations Ministry believes 
that 
mutually acceptable decisions which would prevent further 
lowering of the bilateral trade-economic exchange can be found 
in the course of the upcoming Russian-German negotiations.

  [Text] Russian Vice Premier Aleksandr Shokhin declared that 
Moscow is to restore cooperation with the countries of the 
Eastern Europe. "At present several nongovernmental 
organizations try to establish a normal economic mechanism of 
interaction between these countries and they undoubtedly will 
have future," he noted in his interview with INTERFAX Saturday 
[7 May]. 
  At the same time Shokhin believes that Russia is to 
"overcome, in particular, the problems of debts" on the way to 
restoration of mutually beneficial cooperation with the 
countries of the Eastern Europe. 
  He believes that there are some advances in Russia's 
relations with Hungary, Czech Republic, and Slovakia but 
"unsolved debt problems with respect to Poland and Bulgaria 
inherited from the USSR" still hinder restoration of 
"traditional ties." 
  Shokhin believes that "the old mechanism of mutual 
relations, 
in particular, barter deals" represent "the second serious 
obstacle" on the way to restoration of mutual cooperation 
between these countries. Russia's previous partners are less 
interested in deliveries of their strategic resources in 
exchange for oil and gas, Russia's traditional raw materials. 
  Shokhin is convinced that "large projects, as, for example, 
construction of the oil pipeline Yamal-Poland-Germany and then 
to the Western Europe" should become the basis for cooperation 
between Russia and foreign countries because these projects help 
to simultaneously solve the problem of employment "both for 
Russia and its partners." 
  In addition, they help to implement "numerous private 
projects" which are "the locomotive for economic ties' 
restoration," noted Shokhin.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Potemkin] </F>
  [Text] Warsaw 7 May TASS--A meeting of Russian Vice-Premier 
and Minister of Economy Aleksandr Shokhin, currently in Warsaw 
to attend the 3d conference on "East-West" economic cooperation 
and Polish Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak was held here on 
Friday night to discuss joint projects and problems hampering 
bilateral economic cooperation. The meeting will help to 
prepare the upcoming Polish visit of Russian Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin. 
  Shokhin told ITAR-TASS they discussed ways to settle the 
mutual debt problem, including the "null variants" suggested by 
the Polish side. Russian and polish ministers of finance will 
prepare proposals on the issue. 
  Sources at the Polish Government and the Russian delegation 
told ITAR-TASS, gradual payment of Russian and Polish debts is 
possible. A partial payment of the debt on the parity basis is 
also suggested. 
  The sides discussed Polish participation in the construction 
of the Yamal-Western Europe pipeline via Poland and joint 
modernization of the Moscow-Berlin highway via Minsk and Warsaw. 
  New forms of payment relations were considered as well. 
Bearing in mind Russia is against the return to inter-state 
clearing, the Polish side agreed to consider the forms of 
payment relations previously suggested by Russian banks, said 
Shokhin. 
  Poland is concerned over guarantees of the Russian gas 
delivery. Shokhin said there will be no problem if the Polish 
consumers pay for the gas as good as the western ones. Russia 
is also ready to take into account "special circumstances," he 
said. 
  When in Warsaw, the Russian vice-premier also met his 
colleagues from the United States, Germany and Japan. 
  A meeting with Japanese Minister of Foreign Trade and 
Industry Eijiro Hata resulted in a statement the Japanese 
Government does not plan to cut cooperation with Russia. 
  The sides discussed aspects of investment cooperation. 
Aleksandr Shokhin offered Hata to abandon the demand for 
Russian Government guarantees on most profitable joint projects 
and the Japanese side agreed to think over this proposal.

  [Text] [Presenter Aleksandr Goryanov] We have just received 
a statement by the Russian Foreign Ministry. It says, in 
particular: 
  The reports from Yemen over the past few days speak about 
wide-scale military actions. Despite numerous calls to stop the 
firing, more and more units and subunits join the fighting and 
the sides are using virtually all military means at their 
disposal. The Russian leadership again appeals to the warring 
sides with a pressing request to immediately stop all military 
operations. No matter how deep the differences between the 
participants of the conflict might be or what aims they might 
pursue, we believe they cannot justify the fratricidal 
bloodshed, more destruction and suffering of the entire people 
of Yemen. 
  The government of the Russian Federation in Sana and the 
Russian General Consulate in Aden are doing everything necessary 
to ensure the safety of the Russian citizens in Yemen.

<F P=106> [Report by Boris Vinogradov: "Foreigners Leave Yemen, Which </F>
Is in the Grip of Civil War"] 
  [Excerpt] Boris Yeltsin has issued a directive to commence 
the evacuation of Russian citizens working in Yemen. 
  French warships have taken on board 150 people -- mainly 
women and children -- and taken them from Aden to the port of 
Djibouti, together with staffers of other foreign embassies. 
  From there they will be brought to Moscow in the near future 
by a special flight organized by the Ministry for Emergency 
Situations. 
  In all, some 950 Russians are in Yemen on official business. 
They are diplomats, civilian and military specialists, and 
representatives of Aeroflot and of commercial organizations. 
The Russian Federation Foreign Ministry has informed us that at 
the first stage the objective is to evacuate all Russian 
personnel from the southern part of Yemen, where events have 
become most alarming. The situation is somewhat calmer around 
Sanaa, the northern capital of this Arab state of 9 million 
inhabitants. In the event of a further exacerbation of the 
conflict, urgent measures will be taken to ensure the safety of 
all Russian citizens. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Moscow, 7 May -- An Il-76TD transport aircraft 
carrying 117 Russian citizens -- staff members of foreign 
establishments in the Republic of Yemen and members of their 
families -- took off from Djibouti today for home. An ITAR-TASS 
correspondent was told this today when he spoke to a senior 
staff member of the Russian Foreign Ministry's press and 
information department. This first group of evacuees from among 
850 Russian citizens in Yemen had first been brought from Aden 
(in southern Yemen) to Djibouti by sea. 
  The foreign ministry spokesman said the evacuation from the 
northern part of the country will start tomorrow. A second 
group of Russians will be taken from Sanaa to Al-Hudaydah (a Red 
Sea port), where two Russian transport ships are already 
standing in the roadsteads, and then they will be brought home 
by sea. Expressing hopes that the evacuation of our 
fellow-countrymen will be completed successfully, the foreign 
ministry spokesman added that it is planned to send a further 
aircraft to Yemen -- this time a passenger aircraft -- for a 
final evacuation of people.

  [Text] Moscow May 9 TASS -- The second stage of the 
evacuation of Russian citizens from Yemen is scheduled for 
today. An official of the Russian Ministry for Emergency 
Situations told ITAR-TASS today in the morning that, according 
to the existing information, two Tu-154 planes will arrive in 
Sanaa, capital of north Yemen, in about two hours. One more 
plane is expected to fly to Djibouti, in north-eastern Africa. 
  Marina Ryklina, head of the press centre of the Ministry for 
Emergency Situations, specified on Sunday that 152 Russian 
citizens were planned to be evacuated during the second stage, 
including staff members of the Russian Embassy. Aside from it, 
78 Russians, as well as several Americans and eight French 
citizens are now in the port of Al Hudaydah. U.S. and French 
representatives officially appealed to the Russian Ministry for 
Emergency Situations to help evacuate their people to Djibouti 
and from there to Europe by a Russian plane. The Russian 
dry-cargo ship Khudozhnik Kustodiyev is now on the roadstead of 
Djibouti. It is ready to evacuate all those people. 
  A task group of the Ministry for Emergency Situations, led 
by 
Valeriy Shuykov, is also staying in Djibouti. It came there 
several days ago before the first plane of the Ministry for 
Emergency Situations.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Vladimir Korochantsev </F>
and Yuriy Pichugin] 
  [Text] Pretoria, 8 May -- A Russian Federation delegation 
led by Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the Federation Council of 
the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation, arrived in the 
Republic of South Africa [RSA] today. It will attend the 
inauguration ceremony of Nelson Mandela, the new president of 
South Africa, which will take place on 10 May. 
  At Jan Smuts airport near Johannesburg, Shumeyko made the 
following statement: 
  "A solemn and joyful event in the life of South Africa -- 
the 
inauguration of the first democratically elected president of 
the country -- has brought this Russian delegation to South 
Africa. 
  "As is known, Russia has made a weighty contribution to the 
cause of dismantling apartheid and ensuring a political 
settlement in the RSA. In the fight against the system of 
apartheid and in the process of establishing a negotiating 
process, we developed close friendly relations with the 
constructive forces in South Africa, which are now widely 
represented in the leadership of South Africa. We intend to 
maintain and strengthen these relations. 
  "The RSA and Russia are experiencing a similar period of 
renewal, a period of seeking the ways of future development 
while overcoming the old mentality and difficulties of adapting 
to the new realities. Who, therefore, is better qualified than 
we are to better understand each other's problems and mutually 
make use of the accumulated positive experience of social 
reformation." 
  The similarity of approach to many aspects of world politics 
paves the way to partnership in international relations. Russia 
maintains that the new South Africa must enter the world 
community and its international bodies as an equal participant, 
and that all remaining sanctions against it should be lifted 
without delay. We are prepared to help South Africa in this 
matter. 
  The delegation also brought a personal message from 
President 
Boris Yeltsin to President Nelson Mandela, congratulating him 
and stating that the Russian leadership and all Russia's 
citizens are ready to further promote bilateral cooperation with 
the RSA in all areas, which would benefit both democratic Russia 
and South Africa in the name of peace and prosperity." 
  In an ITAR-TASS interview, Vladimir Shumeyko stressed that 
the RSA used to be associated mainly with apartheid. Now when 
the democratic processes have begun in that country, just as 
they have been in Russia, the whole world wishes it success on 
this path. 
  Speaking of bilateral relations, the head of the Russian 
Federation delegation said they are not beginning from scratch. 
Since the sanctions against the RSA were lifted, many 
cooperation opportunities in various fields have opened up 
between the two countries that are building democracy. 
Interparliamentary relations are of considerable importance. 
Our countries have similar legislature in the economic sphere, 
and this makes our contacts much easier. We hope that from the 
outset we will start moving toward legislation that will take 
into account the interests of each partner.

<F P=106> [Report by Kim Hong-sik] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 9 May (YONHAP) -- Russia and North Korea are 
discussing problems related to South Korean President Kim 
Yong-sam's planned visit to Moscow in June and other issues of 
mutual concern, informed diplomatic sources here said Monday [9 
May]. 
  Additional topics of discussion include extension of the 
Pyongyang-Moscow friendship and Mutual Assistance (military 
alliance) Treaty and the crisis on the Korean peninsula over 
Pyongyang's nuclear program, the sources said. 
  The talks involve a North Korean delegation headed by Vice 
Foreign Minister Yi In-kyu and Russian Foreign Ministry 
officials. The North Korean delegation arrived here last 
Thursday. 
  The meeting, held for the first time in two years at the 
request of the Russian Foreign Ministry, is attracting intense 
interest as it comes when Moscow is showing "unmistakable" moves 
to restore its relations with North Korea, the sources said. 
  Moscow and Pyongyang had been drifting apart since former 
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev introduced perestroyka and 
then following the collapse of communism. 
  Diplomatic observers here said Moscow apparently called the 
meeting to discuss the two sides' positions on the North Korean 
nuclear row that is causing tension worldwide and to seek a 
resolution of the issue through dialogue. 
  Moscow will resurrect its earlier proposal for an 
eight-party 
conference to reach "an overall settlement" of the nuclear 
problem among South and North Korea, the United States, Japan, 
China and Russia, as well as the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) and the United Nations. 
  North Korea, for its part, is expected to again demand the 
suspension of the U.S.-South Korean joint military exercise 
"Team Spirit" and inspection of U.S. "nuclear facilities" in 
South Korea, the sources said. 
  Pyongyang has yet to show any official reaction to Moscow's 
proposal for the eight-party conference. 
  Russia, which wants to play the role of "peace protector," 
is 
not in a position to support North Korea in the nuclear dispute. 
It will nevertheless stress its opposition to United Nations 
sanctions against North Korea. 
  Another problem drawing keen interest is what the two 
countries will do with regard to the Pyongyang-Moscow accord, 
especially the Military Mutual Assistance Treaty. 
  In February 1993, Russia sent then-Vice Foreign Minister 
Georgiy Kunadze to Pyongyang and explained to North Korea that 
"the automatic intervention clause" of the Military Assistance 
Treaty would have to be interpreted in accordance with the 
changed situation in the post-Cold War era. The clause had 
stipulated that the former Soviet Union would automatically 
intervene militarily if North Korea was attacked by outside 
forces. 
  At that time, North Korea reportedly replied that it would 
send Vice Foreign Minister Kang Sok-chu to Moscow for further 
discussion of the problem. 
  But the visit has not been realized and the question remains 
one of the major issues pending between Moscow and Pyongyang. 
  The Moscow-Pyongyang Military Alliance Treaty expires at the 
end of 1995 and unless either one renounces it unilaterally, it 
will automatically be extended for another five years. 
  Another issue bothering Pyongyang concerns North Korean 
loggers at Siberian camps. North Korea is reportedly trying to 
block any escaped loggers from settling in South Korea. 
  Insisting that all North Korean loggers who fled their camps 
in Siberia are "criminals," North Korea is demanding their 
detention under judicial and forestry agreements signed by the 
two countries. 
  Against this North Korean claim, the Moscow government 
maintains that any foreigners in Russia can leave for third 
countries if they take the proper legal steps. 
  In this regard, Russia and South Korea are currently 
discussing resettlement of fleeing North Korean loggers in the 
South and, sources believe, they will eventually be able to do 
so although it may take some time. 
  The Russian-North Korean forestry agreement expired at the 
end of last year and the two are renegotiating the pact. 
  With regard to President Kim Yong-sam's visit, which is some 
20 days away, North Korea is worried that it might "pour cold 
water" on Moscow-Pyongyang relations, which have been warming up 
of late.

  [Text] Steps must be taken to attract Russians, notably 
refugees from former Soviet republics, to areas bordering on 
China, Vladimir Podoprigora, chairman of the Federation 
Council's International Affairs Committee, said at a news 
conference in Moscow Friday. 
  He said that the population of the Khabarovsk and 
Krasnoyarsk 
Territories and the Amur Region had been declining, which was 
alarming in the light of media reports of Chinese expansion into 
the Russian Far East. 
  Podoprigora also noted that the government and parliament 
had 
to upgrade the powers of those regions while not losing sight of 
national interests. He believed that serious thought had to be 
given to the Chinese proposal that an economic cooperation zone 
be set up in Blagoveshchensk. 
  Podoprigora emphasized that regional interests should not be 
neglected in drafting Russian-Chinese relations. He added that 
the residents of border areas were not all happy about the 
agreement between the former USSR and China under which the 
border should run along the mainstream of the Amur. The former 
border line used to be practically the Chinese bank of the river. 
  Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the International Affairs 
Committee of the State Duma, said at the news conference that 
Russia's active military and political cooperation with the West 
had to go hand-in-hand with stepping up cooperation with China 
in these fields. 
  He called for introduction of regulations for Chinese 
citizens on Russian soil. According to the police, there are 
nearly 370,000 of them, he said. 
  Lukin said that a State Duma delegation headed by Ivan 
Rybkin 
will visit China on 14-18 May. He thought that the visit would 
contribute to dynamic development of the bilateral relations.

  [Text] Armenian military units used tanks painted red and 
infantry units dressed in white uniforms in their attacks on 
towns in Terterskiy Rayon. Colonel Rezvan Maliyev, chief of 
police in Terterskiy Rayon, informed a correspondent of the 
[name indistinct] NEWS AGENCY that the objective was to create 
fear in Azerbaijan's military units. Despite their efforts to 
direct psychological pressure on our units, the Armenians 
suffered many casualties. They have lost 32 tanks and large 
quantities of grenade launchers, mortars, and other types of 
arms since the beginning of their onslaught against Terterskiy 
Rayon on 16 April. They have also lost 100 men a day. 
  Asked how many Armenians have been taken prisoner during the 
past few days, Maliyev said: The Armenians kill their 
colleagues to prevent them from being taken prisoner. A special 
military detachment has been created in Armenia for that 
purpose. The commander of a group of 24 troops recently 
contacted Azerbaijan's military positions by field radio to 
inform them that they were ready to surrender as long as they 
were guaranteed safe travel to Russia. The Armenian command 
center monitored what they said. The 24 troops were shot and 
killed. Another 64 Armenian troops who wanted to surrender were 
shot and killed in the south of the front line.

service, Serzh Arushanyan suggested that Azerbaijan was trying 
to bring about a change in military actions and to improve the 
situation on the front's sections when utilizing Afghan 
mujahideen with military experience. 
  Arushanyan stressed in an interview with INTERFAX that Baku 
was after not only a military, but also a political purpose -- 
to internationalize the conflict and give it a religious 
character in order to confront Christian Armenia and 
Nagorno-Karabakh and the Moslem world. 
  Stepanakert had several months before stated there were 
mujahideen in the Azerbaijani Army. One was taken prisoner by 
the Karabakh troops on 22 April. 
  However, the Azerbaijani Defense Minister affirmed on 5 May 
that no foreigners were serving in the Azerbaijani Army.

  [Text] Baku, 7 May -- It is reported by the press service 
of the Azerbaijani Defense Ministry that units of the Armenian 
armed forces, "after being on the point of halting their 
offensive because of the losses suffered, have again started 
bombarding peaceful populated localities in Azerbaijan's 
Terterskiy [Terter] rayon." On this same front, according to 
Azerbaijani military experts, one must expect a resumption of 
the offensive by the Armenian armed forces, since there is 
information of the transfer to the area of an additional 
military contingent, armored vehicles, and ammunition. 
  The latest offensive by Armenia's armed forces, Azerbaijan's 
military department notes, has been going on since 1 May with 
nonstop, but unsuccessful attacks on positions in Geranboyskiy 
[Geranboy], Terterskiy, and Agdamskiy [Agdam] rayons.

  [Text] Deputy commander of Nagorno Karabakh's Defense Army 
General Khristofor Ivanyan declared in his interview with 
INTERFAX that "having refused to sign the cease-fire agreement 
in Bishkek, which contains a mechanism preventing resumption of 
hostilities, Azerbaijan has once more demonstrated its 
unwillingness to solve the Karabakh conflict at the negotiation 
table." 
  In his words, while supporting cease-fire in words, the 
Azerbaijani side opposes introduction of disengagement forces 
into the conflict zone "which are the real guarantor of 
cease-fire observance." 
  Ivanyan pointed out that all previous agreements were 
disrupted due to the fact that there was an opportunity to 
violate the reached agreements and then to accuse the 
confronting party of this. 
  Ivanyan also declared that the Azerbaijani party had used 
the 
previous truce periods only to win the time, to collect new 
forces, and to try another offensive on the front. "Now, having 
experienced a number of serious defeats and great losses in 
personnel and military equipment, the Azerbaijani command is 
looking for an opportunity for a respite in order to bring in 
order their demoralized forces, which are tired of endless 
attacks."

  [Text] Stepanakert, 7 May (SNARK) -- Meanwhile, diplomats 
try to find the ways of Karabakh conflict settlement, the 
battles do not cease in here. According to data received by 
SNARK from the Karabakh Defence Army press service, today 
Azerbaijani troops took offensive on Omar pass in the north of 
Kelbajarskiy region. However, Karabakh forces, keeping under the 
control all important hills, beat off the attacks of Azeris, who 
lost more than 100 people. 
  According to the same source, till evening of 6 May there 
were battles in the north-eastern (Mardakertskiy) and eastern 
(Agdamskiy) sectors of the front. 
  After beating off the attacks of Azerbaijani troops, 
Karabakh 
forces began counter-attack in the direction of Leninavan 
village of Mardakertskiy region and Hovsepavan village of 
Agdamskiy region and, as a result, Azeris were forced back deep 
into their positions. 
  The observers in Stepanakert consider that the activation of 
offensive military actions by Azerbaijan should be connected 
with its uncompromising position at the negotiations in Bishkek, 
where, as it is known, official Baku frustrated the peace-making 
initiative of the CIS.

  [Text] Baku (7 May) TURAN-- Over the past day there was 
little fighting in the northeastern section of the front 
(Terter-Geranboy), report military sources. According to 
experts from Azerbaijan's Defense Ministry, the slow-down is a 
result of failures by the Armenian Army in the north-eastern 
direction. Beginning with 1 May approximately 250 Armenian 
soldiers were killed and wounded and they also lost several 
units of military hardware. 
  Having incurred many losses, Armenian troops have been 
compelled to regroup and strategise as they await extra military 
hardware as well as additional forces from Armenia. 
  In addition to this, diplomatic sources told Turan that the 
Armenian Army is planning to launch a new large-scale offensive 
towards the Geranboyskiy (northern), Terterskiy and Barda 
(north-eastern) regions. The goal of attack is to occupy these 
regions and to reach the city of Yevlakh. The same source 
reports that Russian specialists are also involved in planning 
the offensive. As before, the Russian troops located in Armenia 
are expected to take part in the offensive. It is known that 
the Russian party provides Armenia with military intelligence 
from Azerbaijan. Some experts see this assistance as a reaction 
by Moscow to Azerbaijan's signing of NATO's programme 
"Partnership for the Sake of Peace" and the Azerbaijan's refusal 
to sign the Bishkek document which was proposed by Russia.

  [Text] Armenia's new military detachments, which were 
transferred to the hostilities zone in Nagorno-Karabakh resumed 
the offensive on the Fizuli section of the front, Azerbaijan's

  As a result of fierce fighting, the Azerbaijani Army 
destroyed one tank and one missile launcher Grad by yesterday's 
evening. The Defense Ministry also reports that a car Niva with 
officers of the Armenian Army was destroyed as a result of 
hostilities. The Azerbaijani units forced the adversary to move 
back to the starting positions having killed about 100 Armenian 
soldiers. Simultaneously the Armenian forces launched an 
offensive in the Kelbadjar region in the direction of the 
mountain pass Omar. 
  As the Azerbaijani Defense Ministry reports, at present 
Armenians continue to methodically subject Azerbaijani positions 
(located in the Agdam, Terter, and Geranboi directions) to 
rocket-artillery shelling.

  [Text] Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Hasan Hasanov has 
described Azerbaijan's recent entry into NATO's Partnership for 
Peace scheme as "extremely important." 
  In an interview with INTERFAX, he said the scheme, as well 
as 
the fundamental documents of the North Atlantic alliance, 
stressed the need to maintain the territorial integrity and 
security of its member states. 
  A senior source in the Azerbaijani president's staff told 
INTERFAX the country's participation in the Partnership for 
Peace does not mean that the Commonwealth of Independent States 
(CIS) has exhausted its potential for resolving the 
Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict. He said Azerbaijan's commitments 
under the NATO scheme do not contradict its commitments under 
the CIS Collective Security Treaty. 
  The source said Azerbaijan is ready to take part in 
international collective security systems that can preserve its 
territorial integrity and independence and ensure its security. 
Another top member of the presidential staff, Eldar Namazov, 
said Azerbaijan's membership in the Partnership for Peace would 
get NATO involved in efforts to resolve the Nagorno-Karabakh 
conflict. 
  "In effect this means more opportunities for a political 
settlement of the conflict," he said.

  [Text] Baku--Azerbaijani Ministry for Economics submitted 
the revised forecast of social-economic development for 1994 to 
the Ministry of Finance. 
  By the Milli Majlis proposal, this forecast has to be used 
by 
the Ministry of Finance to correct the budget draft. 
  According to the forecast, the inflation in 1994 reaches 600 
percent. The first option outlined 240 percent inflation. 
  A Finance Ministry official told that his department does 
not 
accept the projected inflation level as inadequate to the real 
economic situation. Only during the first quarter of the 
current year, the inflation exceeded 300 percent, while the 
production output reduced for 25 percent. 
  On the basis of 600-percent level, the Economy Ministry 
expects the GNP at amount of 910 billion manats, and national 
income of 677 billion manats. The initial forecast gave 
respectively 313 and 272 billion manats. 
  A conference with participation of the Milli Majlis 
commissions on economic policy and budget along with the 
corresponding ministries took place in the Azerbaijani Supreme 
Soviet. 
  There was discussed the economic prognosis for 1994, 
submitted by the Economy Ministry. The prognosis was rejected 
because of its "unreality." The prognoses on the inflation rate 
(600 per cent) and the rate of National profit rose the greatest 
censure of the conference participants. 
  Meanwhile, the specialists of the Finance Ministry forecast 
a 
1000 per cent inflation rate in 1994. The prognoses were sent 
for revision.

  [Text] Baku [Dateline as received]--The Russian Foreign 
Ministry has proposed an initiative to settle issues regulating 
border regime between Russia and Azerbaijan. The Russian 
Foreign Ministry sent a written message to Baku with this 
purpose. 
  Azim Dzharahmedov, the employee of the Russian Embassy in 
Baku has affirmed that fact. According to him, Mr. Churkin, the 
first deputy of the Russian Foreign Ministry, has sent a letter 
to the Russian Embassy to Baku asking for starting consultations 
with the Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry for setting up the free 
economic zone between Azerbaijan and Dagestan. 
  Mr. Dzharahmedov pointed out that means establishing of 
joint-ventures, stock-companies, and organization of by-border 
trade. 
  Russia suggests creating a commission that will carry out 
work on realization of corresponding proposals. 
  The commission will consist of ministries' chiefs and also 
the Dagestan Prime-Minister. 
  Mr. Dzharahmedov said the positive decision will be 
beneficial both for Azerbaijan and Dagestan since only in the 
Derbent region are 75 thousand Azerbaijanis and in the northern 
regions of Azerbaijan are dozens thousand Lezgins, Avaries and 
Lacks. As Mr. Dzharahmedov said "a creation of free economic 
zone will keep and reinforce historical and cultural ties 
between two neighboring countries."

  [Text] Today, Eduard Shevardnadze, the chairman of the 
Georgian Supreme Council and head of state, met Bundestag Deputy 
Hans Jochen Vogel, the leader of a social democratic faction, 
Genrod (Erlecht), a scientific assistant from the social 
democratic faction, Dr. Winfrid Weiss and Dr. Alfred (Kidol), 
members of the (Friedrich Ebert) Foundation, Guenter Dalhoff, 
the German ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary to 
Georgia, and other officials. 
  Eduard Shevardnadze thanked the German Government and German 
people on the whole for the support Georgia can feel from their 
side. The head of state said that our country is facing two 
problems: The Abkhaz-Georgian conflict and the grave economic 
crisis. The disintegration of the former Soviet Union resulted 
in wrecking economic links with Russia, Ukraine, and other 
republics. Georgia found itself in a complete isolation. The 
principal task today is to restore these links and establish 
integrational contacts with leading world countries. The head 
of state emphasized that although it is rather difficult to 
solve the existing problems, Georgia has chosen a road of 
economic reforms and democracy and will not step aside. 
  On behalf of the German people, Mr. Vogel greeted the head 
of 
state and thanked him for the reception. He said that it is 
necessary to stay by a friend's side when he is in need. The 
German Government well realizes this, but it also realizes that 
the assistance it has granted to Georgia is not sufficient and 
therefore, it welcomes our government's decision to restore 
links with the republics of the former Soviet Union. 
Business-like and open contacts do not mean that there will be 
an element of discrimination, Mr. Vogel said. 
  At the end of the meeting, members of the German delegation 
expressed hopes that peace will be established in Georgia soon 
and the country will escape the existing problems. 
  The meeting was attended by Guram Muchaidze, the leader of 
the Georgian Social democratic Party.

settlement of Ossetian problem. 
  At the same time, told Khachapooridze, it is early yet to 
speak today of the political status of South Ossetia. A group 
of political experts has to be set up, he said, representing

  [Text] At approximately 1730 on 5 May Abkhazian forces 
assaulted residents of the Georgian village of Mziuri, in the 
Galskiy district of Abkhazia. 
  According to the press center of the Georgian Defense 
Ministry, both the Georgians and Abkhazian forces reported dead 
and wounded. How many people were lost in the conflict, remains 
unknown. 
  The press service of Abkhazia's plenipotentiary mission to 
Moscow rejects the Georgian report. It says that thirteen 
Abkhaz troops have been missing in the Galskiy district since 5 
May. A spokesman for the Abkhazian mission held Georgian 
subversives responsible for their disappearance. He said 
subversive groups infiltrated Abkhazian territory time and again 
from across the Inguri river. 
  According to the Abkhazian Ambassador to Moscow Igor Akhba, 
the subversives aimed to torpedo the repatriation of refugees to 
the Galskiy district.

police arrived. The police surrounded the paramilitaries and 
ordered them to surrender. In response, the paramilitaries 
opened fire and wounded two police officers. Five 
paramilitaries were killed and four taken prisoner. The 
remaining few escaped. 
  What a Georgian police unit was doing on Abkhaz-controlled

  [Text] A member of the Georgian parliament Boris Kakubava 
calls for the military action for the return of breakaway 
Abkhazia. Addressing a convention of the Union for the 
Liberation of Abkhazia, in Tbilisi, Kakubava described political 
moves for the return of Abkhazia as a criminal waste of time. 
  He said that although he was no fascist, he knew that ethnic 
Georgians would return to Abkhazia with the help of those same 
means that were used to oust them from their home place. 
  But, Kakubava said, no refugee would dare return as long as 
the Abkhaz authorities dictated terms in Sukhumi. 
  Kakubava accused Eduard Shevardnadze of losing Abkhazia. He 
said he represented the best part of the Georgian nation and 
would work for the triumph of the Georgian spirit throughout 
Georgia. 
  Kakubava urged the 300 delegates to the convention to 
refrain 
from moves that could aggravate the domestic situation and 
foment confrontation with the government. 
  The leader of Georgia's Popular Front Nodar Natadze rejected 
the idea of taking military action against Abkhazia. In his 
view, moves must be made to create an operational committee for 
the temporarily occupied areas which would instruct the 
government on strategies for Abkhazia. 
  Speaking on behalf of Shevardnadze's Georgian Citizens' 
Union, Georgiy Baramidze called, but failed to evoke support, 
for a political settlement. The convention is going on. Eduard 
Shevardnadze will be expected to take part in the proceedings.

  [Text] Tbilisi, 6th [dateline as received] -- According to 
an announcement by the Department of Information of the Russian 
Defense Ministry, despite the fact that Lieutenant General 
Varden Nadibaidze has been appointed Georgian defense minister, 
he is still regarded as an officer of Russian Armed Forces 
because he has not taken an oath of loyalty to Georgia.

  [Text] Aleksandre Kavsadze, the chairman of the Georgian 
State Committee of Human Rights and Interethnic Relations, met 
Tevfik Okayuz, the Turkish ambassador extraordinary and 
plenipotentiary to Georgia. During the conversation issues 
pertaining to the protection of human rights in Georgia and 
ethnic minorities were discussed. Kavsadze admitted to certain 
violations of human rights in Georgia. However, the very 
existence of the committee he is chairing created on the 
initiative of the head of state proves that in future human 
rights protection will become a cornerstone of state policy. 
Aleksandre Kavsadze has also said that the committee is working 
on a draft law on ethnic minorities in the Republic and this 
draft law will soon be submitted to the Supreme Council for 
consideration.

  [Text] Tbilisi [Dateline as received] -- Georgia spends 10 
times more than allows the state of her economy, stated Nodar 
Djavakhishvili, the president of Georgian National Bank, to the 
SNARK newsman. In his opinion, the introduction of a new 
national currency, lari, is now highly questionable, since even 
a small stabilization of Georgian coupon is impossible. 
  "It is impossible to exist on account of emission. Every 
quarter we increase the money issue, which is not secured by the 
real content, thus subjecting the people to hyper-inflation", 
said Djavakhishvili. He observed that "Georgian economy doesn't 
even compensate its expenses for gas." 
  "If so, then we should not use gas at all. By the way, 
nearly 80 percent of Georgian population actually do not use 
gas. Only Tbilisi, Rustavi, Batumi, and Kutaisi receive gas," 
noted the head banker of Georgia. He also suggested that the 
Georgian government would finally make a decision: "In the case 
Georgia goes towards the ruble zone, rather than strengthens its 
coupon, the government needs a new chairman of the National 
Bank," said Djavakhishvili.

<F P=106> [Speech by Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev at a </F>
Victory Day rally in Moscow -- live] 
  [Text] [Words indistinct] of the Great Patriotic War, dear 
front line soldiers, comrades at arms: Today is truly a sacred 
day. It is 49 years since a Soviet soldier wrote on the wall of 
the Reichstag building in Berlin and the renowned Marshal Zhukov 
put his signature to the document on the full and unconditional 
surrender by Nazi Germany. No matter how much time passes, no 
matter how many epochs replace one another, the date 9 May 1945 
will remain forever in the memory and hearts of our people. 
Eternal glory to the heroes of the Great Patriotic War! 
  Looking back on what happened almost half a century ago, one 
finds oneself wondering whether there is another people in the 
world capable of such self-sacrifice and deserving of such 
undying glory and respect. We bow low to you for your loyalty 
to the oath, for your heroism, for you love of your motherland, 
and for your anguish at its destiny. The Russian Army is proud 
of your exploits and of your victory. Today's festivities on 
Poklonaya Gora, a sacred place of Russian combat glory, is our 
tribute to the memory [passage indistinct] born on the threshold 
of the great victory is, undoubtedly symbolic. 
  Russia's armed forces are the heirs of the Soviet armed 
forces, of its best traditions and victories. In the name of 
the soldiers of the Russian Army, of the leadership of the 
Defense Ministry, let me congratulate you personally with all my 
heart on Victory Day. Russian soldiers wish those who fought in 
that war, all who made their contribution to the great victory, 
good spirits, optimism, as many unclouded, happy days as 
possible, and, of course, good health. The years are relentless, 
but you still have a lot to give, dear veterans. Thank you for 
finding the time and strength to meet the soldiers and sailors, 
for helping them spiritually, for helping them find their place 
in the military system. 
  Dear friends, in exactly one year from now, on a May day 
just 
like this, it will be half a century since the victory in the 
Great Patriotic War. Here on Poklonnaya Gora a great monument 
will be unveiled in honor of the people's heroic deed. I am 
sure it will become our national sacred object, a symbol of the 
recognition and gratitude which the descendents of the victors 
cannot help but feel. 
  Congratulations, dear veterans! Honor and glory to you! 
Endless thanks for your selflessness, your soldier's duty and 
patience, your loyalty to the ideals of patriotism and love of 
your fatherland! Thank you.

<F P=106> [Interview with Andrey Kokoshin, Russian first deputy </F>
defense minister, by Mayak observer Viktor Levin on 8 May; place 
not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Levin] Victory Day is a great holiday. How are the 
Armed Forces celebrating it and what does this holiday mean for 
them? 
  [Kokoshin] Of course, they are celebrating the holiday in a 
solemn manner, in accordance with the rituals that have taken 
shape in the Soviet Army and those new ones that have appeared 
in the Russian Army. Our pre-revolutionary army traditions are 
being vigorously revived in symbols and in the traditions of 
officers' assemblies. 
  But what I regard as extremely important is the spirit of 
victory and of victors. You know, we need the spirit of 1945 
today, too, but in peaceful life. We need much more 
self-confidence and we must believe that we will create a 
powerful and prosperous economy with armed forces that 
correspond to our needs, armed forces that would be part of a 
civil democratic society. These armed forces will be powerful 
enough to be formidable, while posing a threat to nobody. I 
think that herein lies, perhaps, the meaning of our great 
holiday of Victory Day which, I am sure, will be celebrated 100, 
200, 300, and even 500 years from now, because this was our 
country's and people's hour of true glory. This was a great day 
of victory over the darkest forces of Nazism that ever existed 
in human history. I hope this will never be forgotten. Ours is 
a long-suffering people but by its sufferings it redeemed the 
fate of today's developed and prosperous states, and we should 
be one of them.

  [Text] Russia needs a strong army which would help to 
pursue an efficient foreign policy, leader of the Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy declared 
at a meeting in Moscow devoted to the 49th anniversary of the 
victory over the fascist Germany. 
  In his words, "the West has the aim to collapse our army and 
to make Russia's peoples fight each other." "They have 
destroyed us as a military and political rival and have turned 
the country into a flee market," Zhirinovskiy said. 
  At the same time he underlined: "Everybody who encroaches 
upon Russia's interests must know that in 3-4 years Russian army 
will stand on the land of its adversaries." 
  "If I were Stalin, I would have ordered to our divisions to 
inflict a preventive strike against Germany on June 20 and would 
have destroyed the German army," said Zhirinovskiy and noted the 
following: "We do not want any war but currently adversaries 
pose threat to Russia from each side." 
  "If the enemy stands near our borders and the war is 
unavoidable it is necessary to inflict the first strike," 
declared Zhirinovskiy. In his words, one should prevent 
Russian-American exercises on the Totsk test range because "50 
years ago analogical exercises of the Soviet and German forces 
finished with the forty first year." 
  Zhirinovskiy promised that when the LDPR is at power it will 
bring order in this nation and will put an end to crime. He 
spoke in favor of creation "of special courts over bandits: 
there is no need to organize long trials--punishment, including 
shooting on the spot, should await the criminals." 
  According to Zhirinovskiy, "the present authorities have 
made 
the greatest part of our population poor and miserable." In his 
opinion, "the president should dismiss Ministers Pavel Grachev, 
Viktor Yerin, Aleksandr Shokhin, Anatoliy Chubays, Sergey 
Shakhray, and Andrey Kozyrev, but it will be best of all if the 
whole ruling political team resigns." 
  Zhirinovskiy believes that this autumn the situation in 
Russia will sharply worsen, many factories will be stopped and 
political crisis will seize the country. "The authorities will 
be forced to hold early elections and under this situation we 
must do everything so that the president, the government, and 
the parliament will become ours," Zhirinovskiy said. 
  At the same time he complained about lack of objectivity on 
the part of mass media and declared that "correspondents are 
agents to whom the CIA pays for their lie about Zhirinovskiy." 
About 700 people were listening Zhirinovskiy's speech at the 
meeting held near the metrostation Sokolniki.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 6 TASS -- Russia's former Vice-President 
Aleksandr Rutskoy intends to take part in the presidential 
elections and hopes he will be backed by "his" party, Popular 
Party Free Russia (PPFR). He confirmed this in an interview 
with ITAR-TASS, saying: "If I am nominated, I will run". 
  Aleksandr Rutskoy admitted that he is no longer related to 
the Civic Union coalition, of which he used to be one of the 
leaders. Rutskoy explained: "I did not distance myself from the 
Civic Union, on the contrary, its leaders have distanced 
themselves from me". He added that the latter, particularly 
leader of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs 
Arkadiy Volskiy "betrayed those who was at the sources of the 
movement". 
  As concerns the PPFR, of which he is an honorary chairman, 
Rutskoy said that not all of its members "took a firm stand 
during the September-October events" (Rutskoy was referring to 
armed resistance to President Yeltsin's decision to disband the 
parliament in the autumn of 1993) and had to leave the party. 
The PPFR is planning to hold a congress this month to consider 
the party's new rules and program and "identify positions with a 
view to winning the new elections and conduct reforms in the 
interests of the people". 
  As concerns his part in the last autumn events, Aleksandr 
Rutskoy confirmed that he continues to think that his actions 
were right. "What else could be done, if we acted in conformity 
with the laws of the land, in conformity with the constitution". 
  According to Rutskoy, about 500 people were killed in 
October 
and not 149 as officially reported. 
  Responding to a question about his relations with former 
parliament speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov, Rutskoy said there were 
differences between them but they were not of "principled 
nature". 
  The former vice-president said he is now working on several 
books. One of them, "The Collapse of a Great Power", will 
present an objective analysis of "what happened to us and how we 
found our selves in this disgraceful situation". Another book 
"will set forth new approaches to state building and economic 
reforms, a political program and a new Russian idea as I see it".

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 7 TASS--A joint statement of public 
relations centers of the Russian Federal Counter-Intelligence 
Service and the Interior Ministry was made here today to comment 
on recent media reports claiming a "certain confrontation" 
between the two institutions, including the Counter-Intelligence 
Service's explosion of "a criminal group of high-ranking 
staffers of the Interior Ministry". 
  "The Federal Counter-Intelligence Service has detained an 
ex- 
staffer of the Moscow Regional Interior Department's Punishment 
Execution Division (dismissed in April 1994) and a senior 
investigator of the Russian Interior Ministry's Investigation 
Committee on charge of currency rules' violation (Article 88 of 
the Russian Criminal Code), abuse of office (Article 170) and 
bribing (Article 174, part 1). They have been arrested," says 
the document. 
  "A staffer of the bar has been arrested on charge of bribing 
(Article 174, Part 1). His case will be investigated by the 
Russian procurator general's office. All the three were charged 
on May 6. None of high-ranking staffers of the Russian Interior 
Ministry is involved in this case," it stresses. 
  "The Russian Federal Counter-Intelligence Service and the 
Interior Ministry would like to draw attention to joint actions 
of the Service and the Ministry as regards this case. This is a 
regular practice. The stand of Service and Ministry heads on 
corruption, abuse of office and other crimes committed by their 
staffers is clear: Reliability and pure morals of staffers and 
security of services are topical for the whole law-enforcement 
system. 
  "Exposure and prevention of corruption in the 
law-enforcement 
bodies and other state structures are direct duties of counter- 
intelligence and interior bodies, their work to ensure national 
security envisaged by the current legislation. 
  "Coordinated efforts of the law-enforcement bodies and 
secret 
services, interaction and close cooperation of interior bodies 
and counter-intelligence are the main condition, obligatory and 
natural element of their successful measures, in particular 
those against dangerous crimes. 
  "Staffers of the Interior Ministry and the Federal Counter- 
Intelligence Service have held a number of successful joint 
operations to stop activities of many dangerous criminal groups 
involved in illicit drug trafficking, arms sales and antics 
contraband. The comprehensive operations of Putina, Tral and 
Arsenal were a success. 
  "In this connection public relations centers of the Russian 
Interior Ministry and the Federal Counter-Intelligence Service 
think that rumors claiming confrontation and the "war of 
monsters"--the Ministry and the Service, are nothing but a 
provocation that affects the common cause, measures against 
crime and corruption, provision of security of individuals, 
society and the state," says the statement.

  [Text] There has been an unexpected appointment to the 
government's ranks. Nikolay Travkin, leader of the Democratic 
Party of Russia, State Duma deputy and head of administration in 
Shakhovskoy rayon [Moscow oblast], has been appointed a member 
of the Russian Government. The relevant decree, INTERFAX 
reports, was signed by President Yeltsin. Travkin's range of 
duties is not specified. Here is what Travkin himself had to 
say when interviewed by our correspondent: 
  [Begin Travkin recording] A consideration ever since 1992 
and 
the start of the reforms has been how to communicate between the 
grassroots level, where the reforms take hold, and the level 
where they are planned, conceived and designed, and how to speed 
up the possibility of making adjustments and having direct 
contacts between the rayon and the government so that it is 
possible to respond promptly. It is in this connection that I 
have been made a member of the government, but it is as minister 
without portfolio. [end recording] 
  Nikolay Travkin did not rule out the possibility that the 
heads of administration of other rayons would also be brought 
into the government. However, it is necessary here, Travkin 
said, to consider what the government will gain by this. 
Indeed, Shakhovskoy rayon has shown in practice its approach to 
reforms, and only in similar cases can the heads of other 
administrations count on receiving government portfolios, 
Nikolay Travkin emphasized.

  [Text] On Sunday the chairman of Russia's Agrarian Union 
Vasiliy Starodubtsev told Interfax that he would not sign the 
Civic Accord agreement. He said the Agrarians retained enough 
sense to reject the document. The Agrarian Union brings 
together all the major farms and farming facilities of Russia. 
  In April the Union's Council sent an open letter to 
President 
Yeltsin. According to Starodubtsev, it demanded the right to 
join the conciliatory commission's efforts to polish the 
document and devise a mechanism for its realization. 
  The Union was still waiting for an answer from the 
president. 
  Although the Russian farmers welcomed every wise, 
well-intended and long-term proposal, Starodubtsev said they 
would never welcome moves to do them in and destroy Russia. 
  Starodubtsev saw the Civic Accord agreement as suicidal. 
Even if Yeltsin invited the Union to sign the Civic Accord 
agreement, Starodubtsev would not sign. He was confident that 
the conclusion of agreements with those who worked to destroy 
the countryside was immoral.

  [Text] According to informed sources, during the signing 
ceremony for the Social Accord Treaty in the Kremlin yesterday, 
Kirill Nesterov, representative of the Russian Mass Media 
Creative Workers Trade Union, did not sign the proposed 
document. His colleagues point out that this is likely due to 
the fact that the 36 editorial offices -- collective members of 
the trade union being evicted from by the government from 19 
Novyy Arbat -- have not yet been provided with suitable work 
premises.

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Orlov article: "Its Effectiveness Is Beyond Doubt, </F>
But Could Be Increased"] 
  [Text] Will the Social Accord Treaty, which was opened for 
signing 28 April 1994, be productive? A section of the 
political forces and the mass media answered this question in 
the negative, asserting that no real mechanisms exist for 
implementing this document. In our view this is not so. For 
all its outward lack of conflict and its "smoothness," the 
treaty imposes quite definite obligations on the parties to it. 
  The Federation Council and the State Duma, for example, have 
clearly defined the contents of the legislative acts which will 
be adopted in the very near future: a constitutional law on the 
government, a law on the budget, civil and land codes, a code of 
labor laws, tax and banking legislation, laws on the minimum 
living wage, on the delimitation of jurisdiction and powers 
between the Russian Federation and its components, on local 
self-management, on the fight against crime and corruption, and 
on benefits for scientific, cultural, educational, and health 
care establishments (Paragraph 3 Section 2, Paragraph 2 Section 
3, Paragraph 1 Section 5, and Paragraph 5 Section 6 of the 
Social Accord Treaty). This predetermines parliament's stable 
and constructive work style. 
  The toughest restrictions have been placed on the trade 
unions. Their obligation "not to hold or participate in the 
organization of strikes for the purpose of redistributing budget 
funds or allocating to individual sectors or territories 
subsidies or benefits relating to state credits or taxation..." 
(Paragraph 4 Section 2 of the treaty) signifies the end of 
"solidarity strikes," which have had such a negative effect on 
the socioeconomic and political situation in the country. 
  At the same time the obligations assumed by the government 
and the associations of entrepreneurs and commodity producers 
are clearly nonspecific and therefore inadequate. This was 
precisely the reason why many potential supporters of the Social 
Accord Treaty did not participate in the assembly's work. How, 
then, can the treaty's provisions be concretized so as to make 
them considerably more effective? 
  World practice in such agreements (which attests, 
incidentally, that the Social Accord Treaty is not the fruit of 
office creativity by the President's Administration) attests to 
the need for rigid concretization of measures implemented within 
the agreement's framework, with an indication of deadlines. 
Thus, within the framework of the economic stabilization law 
adopted by the U.S. Congress in August 1971 R. Nixon's 
administration undertook the following measures on the basis of 
agreements with employers and labor unions: In August 1971 
prices and wages were frozen by the government for 90 days. 
Thereafter it was permitted to increase them under government 
control -- prices by 2.5 percent, wages by 5.5 percent a year. 
At the third stage all restrictions were made voluntary, while 
retaining state arbitration. Finally, the fourth stage, whose 
implementation was completed by May 1974, proposed the 
restoration of the practice of a controlled increase in prices 
and wages. The implementation of the "social contract" in 
Britain was different. In the summer of 1975 this agreement was 
concluded between H. Wilson's government and the trade unions 
for a period of two years. The trade unions voluntarily pledged 
to limit their wage increase demands to 10 percent a year in 
exchange for specific promises by the government to curb the 
inflation index. Of course, in both the aforesaid situations 
not all the proposed measures were fulfilled, but they had been 
planned specifically and not in the form of phrases like 
"develop the structural restructuring of ecopolitics" (Paragraph 
1 Section 2 of the Social Accord Treaty). 
  So, specificness is the feature which is so lacking in the 
agreement which has been opened for signing. The elaboration of 
the economic appendix to it, clearly recording the obligations 
of the government, the entrepreneurs, and the trade unions in 
respect of macroeconomic indicators, will make it possible, in 
our view, not only to expand the circle of "signatories" -- 
after all, this is not that important -- but also to create real 
conditions for stabilizing the situation in the country.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Batygin and Yevgeniy Skukin report: "Signatures </F>
of Reconciliation. More Signatures Appeared Under Social Accord 
Treaty Yesterday"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Before the ceremony began, 
ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA's correspondents turned to those who had been 
invited to St. Vladimir's Hall to put their signatures to the 
accord document. 
  "The treaty which we are signing," Yelena Voldemarova, 
chairman and coordinator of the Moscow Confederation of 
Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, said, "is something Russia 
undoubtedly needs. But it is more the initial form of accord 
rather than the only necessary one. With its help we at the 
level of political parties and the three branches of power are 
-- figuratively speaking -- drawing up the ground rules. But 
genuine accord cannot be achieved unless all strata of the 
population are involved in the process. In particular, this is 
the task being set by the Russian Land Movement [Rossiyskoye 
Zemskoye Dvizheniye], of which I am the chairman." 
  [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] What specifically do you plan to do? 
  [Voldemarova] First and foremost we need to create the legal 
possibility for transformations. A board of trustees has now 
been set up on the initiative of the Land Movement, the Party of 
Russian Unity and Accord, the Union of Russian Small Towns, and 
the Russian Local Self-Government Union. This is a coordinating 
structure for implementing local self-government. If we succeed 
in initiating the adoption by parliament of a law on local 
self-government, then, in our view, we will have taken a real 
step toward nationwide accord. 
  "The accord is a life belt for society," in the view of the 
famous economist Pavel Bunich, who was representing the Union of 
Industrialists and Leaseholders in the Kremlin. "It could be of 
educational importance. For instance, since the start of the 
year the State Duma has not passed a single economic law. The 
accord document will prompt parliamentarians to move in this 
direction. Furthermore, it is essential to ensure that the 
recession does not continue this year. This is not wishful 
thinking. The decline cannot continue, otherwise it will be a 
collapse, not a recession!" 
  In the opinion of Vladimir Bashmachnikov, president of the 
Association of Peasant (Private) Farms and Agricultural 
Cooperatives, in economic activity it is time to stop "pulling 
the blanket" only over ourselves and living on the basis of 
narrow departmental or regional interests. He believes that the 
agreement being signed is also aimed at preventing extremes and 
at stopping people from resorting to tough measures. 
  ...The treaty has been signed by representatives of the 
Agro-Industrial Union of Russia, the Union of Young 
Entrepreneurs, the Chamber of Trade and Industry, the 
Interregional Society of Merchants, commercial banks.... 
  Those present in St. Vladimir's Hall were addressed by 
Russian Federation Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin. [passage

  [Text] Russian Communist leader Gennadiy Zyuganov refuted 
in an interview with Interfax the allegations on mass opposition 
rallies on May 9. "For our party everything will be within the 
scope of law. May 9 will be just Victory Day," he emphasized. 
  Zyuganov announced that the Communist Party continued to 
work 
in the conciliatory commission on the final version of the 
treaty on civil accord. He repeated that he had submitted the 
proposals put forward at the recent conference of the Communist 
Party to the Russian president during the signing ceremony in 
the Kremlin. Zyuganov himself did not sign the treaty. "We are 
waiting for a reply and we are ready to discuss the problems," 
he said. The present text of the document does not conform with 
aspirations to the national accord, Zyuganov suggested. "This is 
an accord by officers. Social accord is something different. 
It must come from the people. There can be no reconciliation 
in order to rob the people and to destroy the country," Zyuganov 
said. 
  "On the other hand, it does not give much to entrepreneurs. 
At the moment entrepreneurs can only sell money instead of 
producing something," Zyuganov remarked. 
  Speaking at a meeting of veterans of the Great Patriotic War 
(as World War II is known in Russia) dedicated to the 49-year 
anniversary of victory, Zyuganov repeated that the Communists 
were seeking the restoration of the USSR. He also apologized 
for the criminals who had been the party members and had 
betrayed their supporters. Now only people representing the 
cream and the conscience of the nation remain in the Communist 
Party, Zyuganov reassured.

  [Text] On Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin's 
instructions, a Russian Federation National Committee To Prepare 
for and Participate in the World Summit in the Interests of 
Social Development has been formed. 
  The national committee was set up in the light of the 
adoption by the UN General Assembly of a resolution on holding a 
world meeting in Copenhagen in March 1995. Vice Premier Yuriy 
Yarov was confirmed as national committee chairman. 
  The Russian president has signed an Edict "On State 
Supervision and Monitoring of Compliance With Russian Federation 
Legislation on Labor and Labor Protection." 
  Pending the adoption of a legislative act on the state labor 
inspectorate, state supervision and monitoring of compliance 
with Russian Federation legislation on labor and labor 
protection is carried out by the Federal Labor Inspectorate 
under the Russian Federation Ministry of Labor -- 
"Rostrudinspektsiya." 
  The Russian Federation Government has signed a decree "On 
the 
Partial Amendment of Rates of Export Customs Duties" as ratified 
by the 30 October 1993 decree No. 1103 of the Russian Federation 
Council of Ministers (Government), under which, in particular, 
the rate of export customs duties on zinc and items made from 
zinc is set at a level of 30 ECU [European Currency Units] per 
1,000 kilograms. 
  By decree of the Russian Federation Government, amendments 
and additions to the statute on registration taxes for 
officially registering computer programs, databases, and 
integrated circuit topologies, which was ratified by decree No. 
793 of the Russian Federation Council of Ministers (Government) 
of 12 August 1993, have been introduced. Among other things, 
the levels of registration taxes indicated in paragraphs one and 
two for the implementation of activities linked with the 
official registration of computer programs, databases, and 
integrated circuit topologies and for the implementation of 
activities linked with the registration of contracts for 
computer programs, databases, and integrated circuit topologies 
have been amended by the decree. 
  Under the government decree "On Fundamental Measures for 
State Support of the Economy of the Republic of Buryatia in 
1994-1995," 7.6 billion rubles were allocated to the Council of 
Ministers of the Republic of Buryatia in 1994 from the reserve 
fund of the Russian Government.

  [Text] Moscow May 6 TASS -- A possible Russian decision to 
join NATO will hardly provoke public discontent, judging by the 
results of a public opinion poll held in Moscow by the Mnenie 
independent sociological service headed by Grigoriy Pashkov. 
  Russians no longer consider NATO to be hostile. Every third 
out of the 1,000 respondents described NATO as an neutral 
organization as regards Russian security. A total of 27 per 
cent are not against Russia's possible joining of NATO, and 
almost one half of them favor Russian involvement in NATO's 
Partnership for Peace program. 
  The recent NATO air strikes in former Yugoslavia have 
somehow 
shattered the Muscovites' calm attitude to NATO. The number of 
Moscow residents believing that NATO is a neutral organization 
decreased as compared to the January poll. Two thirds of the 
respondents do not think the air-strike decision was correct.

  [Text] The Russian Government is working out a new 
mechanism for state support to the north, Deputy Prime Minister 
Sergey Shakhray has told INTERFAX. He said that the northern 
regions were today the hardest hit by the socioeconomic crisis, 
and because of the short Polar summer, delivery of cargoes to 
hundreds of districts takes over a year. Delivery of essential 
freight was previously financed through the credit system, but 
owing to high Central Bank interest rates, northern enterprises 
have been unable to repay these credits. The government is 
currently working on extending the effectiveness of an 
advantageous system of granting credits, and is setting up a 
federal fund to back delivery of goods to the north. This year 
over seven billion rubles are to be allocated from the state 
budget into the new fund. Supplies to the north will be 
interrupted unless state resources are transferred to the fund 
in good time, Sergey Shakhray pointed out.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "May We Avoid Above All Else.... Fund </F>
Dies Before Having Been Born"] 
  [Text] Yet another planned noose around the neck of this 
country's media is unlikely to work. The idea for the creation 
of a new structure in "support of the mass media" -- in addition 
to all that already exist -- has very long been floating around 
in the capital's political circles. Some time ago this idea 
even added up to a specific draft law "On a National Fund in 
Support of the Mass Media" whose elaboration was included in an 
official plan for the State Duma committee for information 
policy and liaison. The press went aflutter: the plan was for 
the Fund to take over control of all the money that comes from 
the budget (state subsidies) and the sprinkling of money that 
does not come from the budget, and make its own decisions on who 
gets it and who does not. 
  It goes without saying that the position of head of such a 
fund would be the most coveted morsel for mass media officials, 
because whoever took over this position would become Russia's 
key monopolist -- he would be in a position to pull the strings 
that control the "fourth estate" any old time and to issue 
instructions on what and how should be published, on whether 
there should be a lobby today for metallurgy workers or for 
Gazprom. The draft law was supposed to go before the Duma 
Council at the end of April for the inclusion of this matter on 
the agenda. The Lord, however, has taken pity, and the draft 
law was quietly laid to rest by the sensible part of the 
deputies to the gushing joy of the scriveners. This is a 
veritable gift to the Russian press for its professional holiday 
-- Press Day-94.

<F P=106> [By BUSINESS-TASS correspondent Oleg Deyneko] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 6 May -- Actual budgetary revenue in the 
first quarter of 1994 was lower than the sum envisaged by the 
draft budget, a BUSINESS-TASS correspondent was told in the 
Russian Economics Ministry. As is known, Russia's budget for 
1994 has not yet been given final approval by the State Duma. 
  The total sum of arrears for the first quarter is R [rubles] 
5.2 trillion, including R3.4 trillion owed to the federal 
budget, or 15 percent of anticipated revenue. 
  The trend has increased for priority to be given to payments 
to territorial budgets, to the detriment of the federal budget. 
Thus, according to the Economics Ministry's figures, on 1 
January federal budget nonpayments constituted 58.1 percent of 
the total sum of nonpayments, but by 1 April this figure had 
risen to 64.7 percent. 
  Budgetary revenue in the first quarter of 1994 amounted to 
R17.4 trillion (not taking account of external economic 
activity), R6.9 trillion of which went into the federal budget. 
  Out of the total sum, the most significant revenue was from 
profits tax -- R7 trillion, or 40.2 percent; from VAT -- R4.8 
trillion, or 27.6 percent; and from income tax from private 
individuals -- R2.4 trillion, or 13.8 percent.

  [Text] Russia's Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin went 
to Warsaw on a one-day visit Friday to attend an East-West 
Conference on economic reform in East European countries and the 
former USSR. 
  As he reported in an interview with INTERFAX before his 
departure, at that meeting in Warsaw he intended to focus on the 
slow progress with lifting "glaring discriminatory restrictions 
against Russian commodities" on Western markets. In his words, 
damage from these restrictions totals three billion dollars a 
year. He intends to suggest that a group of experts specially 
meet at the economic forum to tackle this problem. 
  He emphasized that Russia had been adopting effective 
measures to improve the investment climate for foreign 
businessmen. By some Western estimates, he continued, Russia 
"could annually absorb 40-50 billion dollars in foreign 
investment." 
  There were 13,500 joint ventures involving foreign assets in 
Russia by the end of the first quarter of this year. This 
year's direct investment in the Russian economy amounted to 2.6 
billion dollars.

  [Text] The Fuel and Energy Ministry has requested that the 
Russian Government allocate an extra quota to export 2-3 million 
tonnes of crude oil with a corresponding overall increase in 
Russian enterprises' oil export quotas for 1994. The ministry 
thinks that oil exports will guarantee that Western banks will 
give loans to restructure the coal industry and to close mines 
that have no future prospects. At present, the Fuel and Energy 
Ministry and the Rosugol company are conducting talks with 
representatives of German and Portuguese firms and the World 
Bank on possible cooperation in the implementation of this 
program.

  [Text] Moscow, 6 May -- The defaulted debt of enterprises 
of various sectors of industry is growing at a rate which is 
substantially greater than the rate at which credit investment 
is growing, according to a report "On the State of the Russian 
Economy (On the Results of the 1st Quarter of 1994)" drawn up by 
the Russian Federation Ministry of Economics. 
  Credit investment (debt owed under credit issued by all 
banks 
and credit institutions) grew six times over the year and 
amounted to 30.5 trillion rubles as of 1st January 1994 and by 
the end of the first quarter this sum amounted to 39.8. Experts 
of the Ministry of Economics believe the growth of credit 
investments is outstripping the growth in the volume of products 
which have been dispatched and the volume of work which has been 
carried out. This bears witness to the fact that credit 
resources are going not to the expansion of production, adding 
to enterprises' circulating capital, but to the circulation of 
goods and money. The ceiling of credit resources was set at 
11.48 trillion rubles in the first quarter, and at 13.6 in the 
second quarter. The lion's share of it is going to cover the 
budget deficit. 
  According to data of the Ministry of Economics, in the first 
quarter, debts owed by enterprises amounted to 69 trillion 
rubles, including 25.8 in defaulted payments. Debts owed to 
enterprises amounted to 67.9 trillion, including 27.3 in 
defaulted payments. 
  Mutual non-payments by enterprises and organizations are 
characterized by the following figures: debts of purchasers -- 
56.9 trillion rubles, including 31.3 in defaulted payments; 
debts to suppliers -- 44.6, including 20.4 trillion rubles in 
defaulted payments.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Ivantsov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 6 May -- Investment in the Russian economy 
has continued to fall this year. During the first quarter of 
the year over 12 trillion rubles, originating from all sources 
of finance, was invested. But this was 28 percent less than the 
corresponding period last year, ITAR-TASS learned at the Russian 
Economics Ministry. 
  State- and municipally-owned enterprises and organizations 
accounted for 59 percent of all investment and 45 percent of 
state investment. Last year the equivalent figures were 66 and 
53 percent. 
  About 50 percent of all this investment was spent on 
construction of production facilities. During the same period 
last year the equivalent figure was 65 percent. 
  At the majority of the most important projects, financed 
from 
the federal budget, work is now at a virtual standstill. This 
is jeopardizing the fulfillment of this year's program for 
commissioning of the most important economic projects. The 
Economics Ministry experts say that this situation has been 
brought about by delays in financing projects from the budget 
and the failure to release preferential credit earmarked for 
investment. 
  The situation with construction projects that are financed 
from local budgets or nonbudget sources is very difficult. Work 
on most of these has stopped, since subcontractors cannot 
continue work if they are not paid for what they do. 
  The critical state of capital construction has had a 
negative 
impact on other spheres of the economy. During the first 
quarter investment in most sectors averaged about eight-10 
percent of the target for the year as a whole. 
  Foreign investment in the Russian economy remains at a low 
level. Such investment totalled more than 180 million dollars in 
the first quarter. This sum constitutes the authorized capital 
contributed to more than 1,300 joint ventures. However, direct 
investment of foreign capital actually injected into these 
ventures, including reinvestment and loans, is estimated at 
approximately 2.6 billion dollars since the beginning of this 
year.

  [Text] The Moscow government is ready to stop transfer of 
money to the federal budget which is then allocated to Moscow 
from the budget, Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov declared at the 
sitting of the Moscow government on Saturday which was 
discussing results of the fulfillment of the budget of the city 
of Moscow for 1993. 
  Luzhkov believes that the Moscow leadership is forced to 
make 
this due to permanent debts of the federal budget to the Russian 
capital. As the Minister of the Moscow government Yuriy 
Korostelev, leader of the finances department, reported to 
Interfax, as of January 1, 1994 this debt was 117 billion 
rubles, and as of early May - 126 billion rubles. 
  The resolution of the capital's government says that "the 
program on social-economic development of the city for 1993 has 
been successfully fulfilled." At the same time the resolution 
points out that "the results of the budget's fulfillment have 
failed to create a base for financial support of additional 
measures and to comprehensively form the funds for the starting 
financing of this year." 
  In the course of the sitting chief of the state tax 
inspectorate in Moscow Dmitriy Chernik reported that a total of 
2,635 trillion rubles and 58 million dollars have been 
transferred to Moscow's budget at the expense of taxes collected 
on the territory of the city. In his estimates, about 21 
trillion rubles will be transferred to the city's budget at the 
expense of taxes. The city's budget will be approximately 21 
trillion rubles. A more precise prognosis of the capital's 
social-economic development and Moscow's draft budget for 1994 
are to be submitted to the Moscow government before June 15. 
  On the proposal of Yuriy Luzhkov the Moscow government 
dismissed several people guilty of using budget funds at their 
own disposal. In particular, it fired chief of the medical 
department of the Western administrative district where the 
budget funds were spent for the procurement of "21 cars for 
non-medical purposes and payment for foreign business trips." 
  According to Luzhkov, "today there is no more complex and 
important work but the work aimed an efficient search for ways 
to replenish Moscow's budget funds."

<F P=106> [Interview with Nikolay Travkin by correspondent Sergey </F>
Medvedev, leader of the Democratic Party of Russia; from the 
"Novosti" newscast -- live or recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Medvedev] I would like to introduce you to a 
new minister of the Russian Federation, you all know him well, 
Nikolay Ilyich Travkin, appointed minister without portfolio 
only yesterday by a presidential decree. 
  Nikolay Ilyich, this appointment is quite unusual, at least 
it seems so to journalists: a member of the opposition, an 
opponent being appointed a member of the government. What will 
you be doing in the government without a portfolio? 
  [Travkin] First, a few words about opposition. We have two 
types of opposition in society--the criticizing opposition, 
which simply keeps barking and the working opposition. I had 
nothing to do with the former. [passage omitted] 
  The government today has two tasks: to reform Russia's 
economy, not just the oil and gas sector or agriculture. 
Second, we must build the state, with all its institutions. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Medvedev] Are we to understand that you will take a 
decision 
in the government, carry it out in your Shakhovskoy rayon, and 
then, as leader of the Democratic Party of Russia, criticize it? 
  [Travkin] No, that is not how it will be. 
  [Medvedev] In effect, you will be a government 
representative 
in the Duma? 
  [Travkin] No. Why? I was a deputy and leader of a faction 
in the Duma and remain such. I will represent the interests of 
the local economy. 
  [Medvedev] A representative of the local economy at the top? 
  [Travkin] This is right. We cannot be apes and set up 
everything in the rayons that has been set up at the level of 
the federation. [passage omitted]

  [Text] [Video caption says: Appeal to the Russian people by 
Anatoliy Chubays, Russian Federation Government deputy prime 
minister] [Chubays] Voucher privatization is ending in Russia 
now. It is creating the conditions for an upturn in the 
economy, laying the foundations for the way to a stable society 
and well- being. Today not everyone has decided what to do with 
their privatization vouchers. I understand that this is a 
difficult question for many -- where can they invest their 
voucher profitably, how not to miscalculate. 
  I want to tell you that in April and May enterprises from 
the 
oil and gas industry, non-ferrous metallurgy, and 
telecommunications, high-tech enterprises from the defense 
complex, and major Russian exporters will be put forward at 
voucher auctions. This is the most reliable and profitable 
sector of our economy. There is still time before 30 June to 
think about this. But I would advise you to hurry and not put 
off until tomorrow what can be done today. 
  The choice is yours. I wish you success.

<F P=106> [BIZNES-TASS report: "More and More Loss-Makers"] </F>
  [Text] The number of loss-making industrial enterprises in 
Russia has more than doubled in the first quarter of the year, 
the report "On the State of the Russian Economy" prepared by the 
Russian Federation Ministry of Economics and obtained by 
BIZNES-TASS states. As of late March these include 18.6 percent 
of all industrial enterprises -- as opposed to 8.2 percent at 
the end of 1993. 
  The largest percentage of unprofitable enterprises has been 
registered in the fuel and energy complex -- 30.7 percent of 
them as against 17.2 percent at the start of the year, in second 
place is the food industry (20.8 percent as against 5.9 
percent), third is metallurgy (17.2 percent as against 4.2 
percent), and fourth is machine building (16 percent as against 
6.2 percent). 
  The report stresses that the first quarter of 1994 has been 
the period which has seen the most considerable reduction in 
industrial output at any time during the course of the reforms 
-- which is to a considerable extent related to the intensive 
impact of demand constraints on the economy.

    [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First 
Channel Network in Russian at 1700 GMT on 8 May broadcast during 
the "Sunday" program an 8-minute video report by correspondent 
Natalya Chernyshova on the airbus crash in Siberia. 
  Chernyshova explains that this new report on the airbus 
crash 
in Siberia was compiled because "first of all, French experts 
and the engineers who developed the airbus came to Moscow this 
week, secondly -- we have received the black box recording from 
unofficial sources, the same recording that we were refused at 
the Interstate Aviation Committee." 
  As the video shows the investigation team looking at graphs, 
the correspondent explains that the airbus flight was proceeding 
normally and that the son and daughter of "experienced" pilot 
Yaroslavl Kudrintskiy were thought to have entered the pilot's 
cabin about four hours into the flight. Clips of the recording 
are then played on three occasions accompanied by a 
transcription on-screen, the speakers are not identified. 
  "Can I turn this?" 
  "Yes, if you turn it to the left." 
  "Which way will the plane go?" 
  "To the left." 
  "And if you turn it to the right?" 
  "It will turn to the right." 
  "Turn (?it) round." 
  "Look from the ground when you turn it. Let us turn to the 
left. Turn it to the left." 
  "Is the plane turning or not?" 
  "It is turning well." 
  "Set it to normal attitude." 
  "We are moving to the right." 
  At this point the correspondent says there were two minutes, 
25 seconds left before the plane crashes. The video then shows 
the type of black box being used today before returning to the 
second clip of recording. 
  "Why is the plane turning?" 
  "Is it turning by itself?" 
  "Yes." 
  "Why is it turning?" 
  "I do not know, you will not upset its course, will you?" 
  "Oh, what!" 
  "Kids..." 
  A graph then shows what was happening to the plane in the 
final seconds. 
  "Eldar, leave the cabin, crawl out to the back, Eldar." 
  "We are going very fast." 
  "I have turned it on." 
  "Yes. That's it. We are moving out, we are moving out." 
  "Put the lever to the right." 
  "We are going very fast. Shut off the gas." 
  "I have reduced it." 
  "It is all right. We will be out of it in a moment." 
  "There we are, all normal." 
  "Slowly, slowly...we're getting there." 
  At this point the aircraft impacted on the ground.

  [Text] Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev has just held 
a news conference at the Russian Defense Ministry on the subject 
of the Russian Armed Forces being two years old -- results and 
prospects. On the telephone with the details is our commentator 
Viktor Levin. 
  [Levin] Defense Minister Pavel Grachev spent an hour and a 
half speaking in detail about the state of affairs in the 
Russian Armed Forces, pointing out what has been achieved, and 
going into great lengths about the shortcomings. But probably 
the main thing which needs to be emphasized above all else is 
the fact that over the past two years the military, as the 
defense minister said, has begun to clearly realize the 
responsibility that lies with the Armed Forces. 
  The defense minister gave an assurance that Russia's Armed 
Forces have become a reliable state institution and the 
guarantor of stability in our Russian Federation. The 
realities, indeed, are these, Pavel Grachev said: the Armed 
Forces -- and he expressed his immense gratitude to the 
soldiers, sergeants, warrant officers, officers, generals, and 
admirals -- remain completely battleworthy. 
  At the same time, the defense minister noted that there are 
three tasks which require a solution at state level. They are, 
first and foremost, reliable and stable financing within the 
limits required by the Defense Ministry. Secondly, ensuring 
that the personnel are up to strength. According to the defense 
minister, one soldier now has to do the work of ten. This is 
the result of being under strength. The outcome of this is that 
the burden on young soldiers of 18 years of age is so great that 
many cannot stand up to it. In the defense minister's opinion, 
no matter what the army commanders do, this problem will not be 
solved without a state decision and without the Armed Forces 
being brought up to full strength. And the third conclusion was 
to ensure normal housing and living conditions for servicemen 
and their families. Pavel Grachev gave the following example: 
last year over 50,000 apartments were built. This is a whole 
town, but this is insignificantly small because over these past 
few years there has been a very great movement of troops from a 
number of states which are now considered to be foreign and even 
from the present states of the CIS. 
  Replying to questions, the minister dealt in detail on the 
problems of staging the joint Russian-American exercises at the 
Totskoye proving ground. According to Grachev, if we really 
want to mutually get rid of the image of an enemy and move 
towards partnership, these exercises are vital. He admitted 
that these exercises were of a symbolic nature: they were not 
military exercises in the pure sense, they were peace-keeping 
exercises, and he believes that they should definitely take 
place. One may think about the right time -- it may be that 
summer is not the best time when the crops are ripening and the 
harvest coming up -- but this issue is, I would say, a very 
minor one. The defense minister stressed several times that it 
was necessary to hold these exercises, for the sake of peace and 
for the sake of friendship. This is Viktor Levin, from the 
Ministry of Defense.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Klimov report: "Proposing Our Own Partnership </F>
Program"] 
  [Text] What are the main results of the two years that 
have passed since the Russian Army was created? This question 
was answered by Army General Pavel Grachev, Russian Federation 
minister of defense, at a press conference for Russian and 
foreign journalists. The Armed Forces have become a reliable 
guarantor of the state and of the maintenance of stability in 
society. 
  Here are the results of the review of the winter training 
period -- 14 units were graded excellent and 61 good. Only 10 
units and ships "flunked." The worst state of affairs prevails 
in the Pacific Fleet. 
  Much has been done during the two years, but even more fresh 
problems have cropped up. Just as before, attention will focus 
mainly on the strategic nuclear forces. 
  The Armed Forces will retain their five-branch structure at 
least until the year 2000. But each branch of the Armed Forces 
will undergo substantial changes. For example, seven regiments 
of the Strategic Missile Forces will be equipped with new 
technology. Special attention will be given to the creation of 
an air-space defense in the Air Defense Forces. The Air Force 
has acquired two new commands. There are many complications in 
the Navy. 
  There is also the problem of manpower acquisition in the 
Armed Forces. Much has been written about the complexities of 
the draft and there is no point in repeating it. But the poor 
quality of contract recruitment poses a new problem. 
  The exercises which have been held not only demonstrated the 
degree of the troops' training but also highlighted the need for 
transition to territorial-administrative commands. Units and 
combined units of all branches of the Armed Forces must be 
subordinate to a single leader at regional level. 
  Army Gen. P. Grachev told the journalists a lot, but saved 
the main news item until the end of his statement. He 
emphasized that no international actions can succeed withot 
Russia, without its participation and approval. This was 
confirmed by events in Yugoslavia. NATO's "Partnership for 
Peace" program will also be impossible without it. But the 
program cannot be said to suit Russia in its present form. A 
decision has been made to elaborate our own alternative for 
partnership. Its name cannot contain the words "for Peace" 
because there cannot be any partnership for war. The Russian 
program will be examined by the [Russian] Security Council and 
will then be endorsed by the Russian Federation president. The 
Russian minister will present our program 24 May, when all NATO 
countries' defense ministers will assemble in Brussels.

  [Text] Moscow, 6 May -- Peacekeeping functions in Georgia 
could be successfully carried out, alongside the Russians, by 
units and subunits of the armed forces of the CIS states, and 
especially the participants in the collective security treaty. 
This was stated at a news conference today by Russian Defense 
Minister Army General Pavel Grachev. 
  Russia, the minister noted, would be grateful to the United 
Nations if, during the fulfillment of peacekeeping functions in 
the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict, representatives of this 
international organizations could participate as observers. 
  The defense minister also said that during a conversation 
with UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali during his recent visit 
to Moscow, he obtained agreement in principle for Russian 
participation in peacekeeping activities in Georgia.

<F P=106> [From the "Slavyanka" program of the Russian Defense </F>
Ministry] 
  [Text] We are changing our usual program schedule today. 
We normally give over our Saturday broadcast to military news 
from the countries of the Near Abroad. The significance of 
today's Russian Federation events compels us to change this rule. 
  Today is the second anniversary of the day that Russia's 
President Boris Yeltsin announced the creation of the Russian 
Federation Armed Forces. The head of the Russian Federation 
Defense Ministry has issued the relevant festive decree, and at 
a news conference in the Defense Ministry Army General Pavel 
Grachev summed up some results. 
  [Begin Grachev recording] For us military men, the last two 
years have been extremely full of events, facts and deeds, and 
have undoubtedly been most difficult from all points of view, 
economic, political, and purely military and -- I stress in 
particular -- from the morale and psychological point of view. 
I am confident that over these two years we military men have 
very clearly realized, probably as never before, what special 
responsibility lies upon the Army and servicemen. One of the 
main results of the two years we have lived through, I believe, 
consists in the fact that our Armed Forces have become a 
reliable institution of the state, a guarantor of stability in 
society, and play an important role in maintaining the integrity 
and security of Russia. All this cannot but bear testament 
above all to the maturity of the absolute majority of servicemen 
and their understanding of their vocation and of those difficult 
processes that are today taking place in the Army, and indeed, 
in society as a whole. 
  It is in the Army, in these conditions, that genuine 
patriots 
of our motherland are now serving, the flower of our society, 
serving conscientiously, for love of the fatherland, for love of 
their native country, and not for rubles and dollars. Such is 
the reality and truth. No matter what difficulties Russia may 
now be experiencing, no matter what at times unresolved problems 
confront the Army, the Armed Forces -- thank God, and a big 
thank you for this steadfastness and understanding to our 
soldiers, noncommissioned officers, officers, and generals -- 
remain wholly combat ready and controllable [upravlyayemyy].

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Ostanin] </F>
  [Excerpt] Moscow, 8 May -- "Stability and maximum harmony 
in society -- that is what the army wants," said Army General 
Pavel Grachev, Russia's minister of defense, at a meeting today 
with the personnel of the Tamanskaya Motorized Infantry Division 
on the occasion of the second anniversary of the Russian Army 
and in connection with Victory Day which, in the words of the 
minister, has become a "day of spiritual unity and kinship" for 
all Russians. 
  The Russian Army's two years had been crammed full of events 
and novel tasks, the minister noted. "It has been a time for 
appreciating the enormous responsibility which has been laid 
upon the army," he said. "A majority of servicemen have 
displayed maturity and an understanding of their purpose and of 
the complex processes underway in society." "Whatever 
interpretation is put on the tragic events of October 1993, it 
is now clear that the military averted civil war in Russia," 
Pavel Grachev believes. 
  According to the minister, "there are those who try to 
portray the army as weakened and bloodless and, in some cases, 
as a caricature of itself, in order to discredit it." "The 
reality is," in his opinion, "that the Armed Forces remain a 
reliable tool of the state and a guarantor of stability in 
society, in spite of the difficulties." 
  Replying to journalists' questions, Pavel Grachev noted 
there 
are now three departments -- the Ministries of Defense and 
Foreign Affairs and the Security Council -- working on a 
conception of a partnership between Russia and the countries of 
Europe. "The president has approved what we are doing," the 
defense minsiter stressed. "He set us this task a long time 
ago." The proposals of experts and academics will be looked at 
in the middle of May at a session of the Security Council and 
then revealed on 24 May in Brussels. In his opinion, the 
Partnership for Peace program is of a declaratory nature and is 
void of specific proposals for cooperation and interaction 
between the countries of Europe. Furthermore, the role of 
Russia -- "once again denied the capacity to have thoughts and 
make suggestions" -- has not been reflected in the program.

<F P=106> [Ilya Bulavinov report under the "Defense Ministry Meeting" </F>
rubric: "It is Bad Enough To Be Poor, But To Be Weak Is Even 
Worse"] 
  [Text] Nearly all Defense Ministry chiefs conferred behind 
closed doors yesterday for as long as two hours. The meeting 
chaired by both first deputy defense ministers -- Andrey 
Kokoshin and Mikhail Kolesnikov, who is also chief of the 
General Staff -- was prompted by a reason just as serious as any 
threat to the country's national security. Namely, money. Or, 
rather, by a lack of it. The Armed Forces have virtually no 
money even to pay salaries to officers and to maintain 
elementary combat readiness. 
  Participants in the meeting of the Defense Ministry's 
commission on financial support to the Armed Forces and the 
implementation of the state defense order faced a very complex 
task: to choose on what the ministry's rather meager funds 
should be spent. The military can hardly be reproached for 
insatiable appetites. For reasons of economy they have already 
reduced even mobilization targets and given up plans to procure 
many types of weapons. But this has improved the situation only 
marginally because the state debts to the Armed Forces and 
enterprises carrying out defense orders have exceeded 3 billion 
rubles. 
  At the same time, there is no longer any hope that the army 
will be rich enough to pull through on its own. A high-ranking 
official on the commission pointed out that "internal financial 
reserves of the Armed Forces have effectively been exhausted." 
  In the end, the meeting decided that money should be spent 
first of all on the payment of money allowances, supplying of 
military units with food and electric power, and also the 
maintenance of nuclear security. Even these areas, however, 
will not have guaranteed funding: the withdrawal of troops from 
foreign countries and their accommodation in Russia will require 
extra spending. As for weapons procurements, combat command, 
control, and communications equipment, high-precision weapons, 
and electronic warfare equipment will still be a priority. 
  The commission meeting results were summed up by Andrey 
Kokoshin. After the meeting he told your KOMMERSANT-DAILY 
correspondent that "it is becoming harder and harder to ensure 
the combat efficiency of the Armed Forces given the current 
conditions of financing." Lower-ranking officials of the 
Defense Ministry, however, described the situation in the army 
in different, stronger expressions.

  [Text] Russia's Pacific Fleet will launch a second stage of 
an operation to fight illegal fishing around June 20, when the 
crab and sturgeon season starts, a source in the fleet staff 
told Interfax. 
  During the first stage of the Putina (Fishing Season) '94 
operation, begun on April 20, the fleet detained 20 Russian and 
four Japanese boats for breaking fishing regulations in the 
Russian waters of the Sea of Okhotsk. Altogether more than 100 
Russian and over 20 Japanese fishing vessels have been examined. 
  The commander of the Pacific frontier forces, Vitaliy 
Sedykh, 
said most of the violations had been made by Russian boats, 20 
of the 100 that had been checked either breaking the border zone 
regulations or fishing illegally or carrying contraband. Three 
boats have been fined for dumping toxic substances into the sea. 
Another three were impossible to stop and went off to Japan but 
face arrest on their return. 
  Four naval patrol vessels, five patrol boats of the State 
Fishing Committee, 10 aircraft, 33 helicopters and space 
monitoring facilities have been involved during stage one of the 
operation, which is due to end on May 10 but may be extended.

<F P=106> [By TASS-CRIME correspondent Yuriy Shcherban] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 6 May -- The military collegium of Russia's 
Supreme Court has confirmed to an ITAR-CRIME correspondent that 
it has received a petition from Valentin Varennikov in which he 
refuses to have the State Duma's amnesty decision applied with 
regard to himself. The collegium does not, however, know if any 
of the other accused in the State Committee for the State of 
Emergency [SCSE] trial have communicated similar wishes. 
  As a TASS-CRIME correspondent learned, the formal accusation 
of high treason levelled at Varennikov and the other accused 
continues to remain in force, despite the amnesty, in so far as 
the procuracy general of the Russian Federation has not 
withdrawn it and, after protesting against the decision of Judge 
Ukolov at the Presidium of Russia's Supreme Court, has sought to 
bring the criminal case back to the military collegium for a 
final decision to be made. 
  At present, the "SCSE case" is "being examined" by Viktor 
Yaskin, military collegium judge of the Russian Federation and 
major general of the judiciary. By law, the continuation or 
cessation of legal proceedings depends on his decision alone. 
Since Varennikov has rejected the amnesty, there is a strong 
possibility that legal proceedings will be continued against him 
personally (this does not apply to those of the accused who 
declare their acceptance of the amnesty).

  [Text] Eight control units from naval radiation-monitoring 
instruments containing the highly active radionuclides 
strontium-90 and three 90 [tri devyanosto] and plutonium-239 
were stolen a few days ago from a laboratory in the maritime 
fishing-port of Nakhodka, in the Far East. INTERFAX learned 
this today from Russia's State Supervision Agency for Atomic 
Power Capabilities, quoting the department's Far Eastern 
district. The administration of the maritime fishing-port has 
informed Nakhodka's investigatory bodies of the occurrence. An 
investigation is underway.

  [Excerpt] Moscow, 6 May -- The faulty valve in circuit No. 
2 of the third set at the Beloyarsk nuclear power station, which 
caused today's leak of nonradioactive sodium, is now being 
repaired, ITAR-TASS was told by the press centre of the Russian 
Federation Ministry of Atomic Energy. 
  Specialists stress that there was not a fire at the station. 
The incident involved only the ignition of liquid sodium 
escaping into the atmosphere. This is a perfectly logical 
chemical reaction, which will cease once the valve has been 
repaired and sodium stops leaking into the atmosphere. The 
accident has been assessed at level one on the seven-point 
international scale of incidents at nuclear power stations.

  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] The main goal of a visit by 
[Supreme Soviet Chairman] Mechyslaw Hryb and [Prime Minister] 
Vyacheslaw Kebich to Chisinau is to strengthen economic and 
cultural ties between Belarus and Moldova. Having arrived here 
at the invitation of this country's leaders, the Belarusian 
delegation today conducted fruitful work. Mechyslaw Hryb and 
Vyacheslaw Kebich held negotiations with Moldovan President 
Mircea Snegur, which were concluded by signing two 
intergovernmental agreements: an economic and trade agreement 
and an agreement on social protection of citizens. Also signed 
was a protocol on consultations between the Moldovan and 
Belarusian Foreign Ministries. At a news conference, the state 
leaders emphasized that the agreements signed here are in the 
interest of both states and the people. 
  At 1500, Mechyslaw Hryb and Vyacheslaw Kebich went their 
separate ways, as the saying goes. The Cabinet of Ministers 
chairman and the parliament speaker followed their own programs 
of the visit, which had been prepared, as I suspect, in 
accordance with their specific functions and responsibilities. 
Mechyslaw Hryb held a meeting with Moldovan Supreme Council 
Chairman Petro (?Kuchynskiy), and Vyacheslav Kebich toured the 
western regions of Moldova. The Belarusian prime minister 
visited a children's resort in the city of [name indistinct], 
and at a history museum, he learned about social and cultural 
aspects of the development of the Moldovan countryside.

  [Text] At a time when the CIS is trying to abolish customs 
duties, Moldova and Belarus are introducing a free trade regime, 
said Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslaw Kebich, at a ceremony 
where he signed a trade and economic agreement for 1994 in 
Chisinau between the two countries. The system of payments and 
the unfixed exchange rate of both countries' national currencies 
are the greatest obstacles on the way to implementing this 
agreement, the Belarusian Government leader pointed out. The 
unification of Belarusian and Russian monetary systems, in the 
opinion of Vyacheslaw Kebich, will not hamper trade and economic 
cooperation between Moldova and Belarus.

<F P=106> [Interview with Anatol Hurynovich, deputy chairman of the </F>
Minsk City Council, by Lyudmila Klaskowskaya; place and date not 
given: "One Should Do His Best To Make Presidential Campaign 
Fair"] 
  [Text] [Klaskowskaya] The presidential campaign is already 
under way, and you must have your first observations... 
  [Hurynovich] As is known, at the first stage, initiating 
groups in charge of collecting signatures for their candidates 
tried to register with the Central Commission. The number of 
those groups alone shows that the presidential campaign is going 
to be hot. 
  At that time, the organization of the city and district 
electoral commissions was initiated, the participation in which 
was sought by different political organizations and working 
teams. Their reasons are only too clear: With our thus far 
very weak democratic traditions, every political force wants to 
have its "eye" there. To maintain popular trust in those 
commissions, we admitted a broad circle of political parties. 
The commissions have been set up by now, and their personal 
line-up was made public. 
  Now, as you know, the initiating groups have begun 
collecting 
signatures for their candidates. 
  [Klaskowskaya] Do you have any more observations regarding 
this first presidential campaign held in Belarus? 
  [Hurynovich] First, the electoral law, which was hastily 
adopted, is not perfect. It failed to sufficiently specify the 
election procedures in the military and in restricted-admittance 
medical institutions. Poorly thought out is a provision saying 
that under certain circumstance, citizens may vote within 10 
days [as published]. There will be problems with putting 
together electorate lists. 
  In addition, we are concerned about the prospective turnout. 
The election day, 23 January, is Thursday, which is one day 
before the weekend. You cannot guarantee that people will not 
grab all four days to leave for their suburban land plots. 
  [Klaskowskaya] The presidential campaign promises to be 
exhausting both for the candidates and their teams. What 
difficulties do you and the structures that will be created on 
the city and district levels anticipate in ensuring smooth 
elections? 
  [Hurynovich] I had a meeting with deputy chairmen and 
administration heads at the Minsk city districts council the 
other day. They were surprised that the draft electoral law was 
not published in the press. People who, as they say, cut their 
teeth on this, could have helped make this law more accomplished. 
  The main burden is now carried by the city districts. Top 
priority issues include staking out boundaries of constituencies 
and setting up electoral commissions there. In addition, time 
is pressing. 
  [Klaskowskaya] The law guarantees equal rights and 
conditions 
for each contender for the presidential post. But we all know 
just how it is in real life. What are the illegal campaigning 
methods that we will have to weed out? 
  [Hurynovich] Due to a rudimentary political culture and a 
lack of basic ethics, the campaign will surely provide us with 
many surprises. There can be no equal opportunities for all 
presidential candidates at a time when all media are 
monopolistically owned by the state. Evidence of this is 
already on hand. No sooner had the prime minister signed the 
monetary merger agreement (I personally view this fact as a 
propaganda ploy on the eve of the elections) than all the media 
exploded with reports touting the good that Kebich supposedly 
did for Belarus. Why weren't economists, independent experts, 
and politicians given an opportunity to present their educated 
and objective opinions about this treaty? This kind of 
political "game" will be very dangerous if played throughout the 
campaign. 
  [Klaskowskaya] Your own experience has taught you many 
things... 
  [Hurynovich] Running for a seat at the Minsk City Council, I 
myself experienced the foul methods of my political rivals. 
The mudslinging machine is well-maintained. One day they 
spread rumors that you were embracing... a fascist, but the next 
day, it suddenly turns out that you are not a fascist, but a 
good friend of Belarus. 
  Such practices are still used today. Many people excelled 
especially well in this type of "campaigning." Some of them 
used to be highly-paid party hacks and came from Russia to 
install communism here and manipulate public opinion with 
Bolshevik tricks, mixing lies with a small dash of truth. 
Others, like a bureaucrat from the Cabinet of Ministers and the 
prime minister's press secretary, engage in political 
falsifications disparaging political opponents to their chiefs. 
If the prime minister is for a fair campaign, he should be the 
first to stop Mr. Zamyatalin. 
  Officials and state institutions should not be allowed to 
participate in the campaign during working hours. One cannot 
tolerate a situation when the entire state administration 
machine, putting important matters aside, is engaged in an 
election campaign. There is evidence that emissaries traverse 
the entire Belarus during their working hours to coerce local 
leaders and the electorate into voting for their candidate. 
They also get people to participate in initiating groups 
contrary to their will. 
  The government and the Central Electoral Commission has even 
issued rules for using mass media by presidential candidates. 
But look at item 9: Major media receive subsidies from the 
Cabinet of Ministers. He who pays orders the music, but the 
Cabinet of Ministers pays the money that comes from the 
electorate. What equal conditions can we talk about when the 
media work in favor of some candidate, and for our money at that? 
  Incidentally, the democratically-oriented Belarusian Social 
Democratic Assembly, the United Democratic Party of Belarus, the 
Party of People's Accord, the National Democratic Party, and 
others signed an agreement on the joint political fight. And 
one more thing, only time will tell whether judicial 
institutions will impartially control implementation of the 
electoral law. 
  [Klaskowskaya] It is said that the party of power will exert 
pressure on electoral commissions to neutralize its opponents. 
Do you agree that this is possible? 
  [Hurynovich] Yes. However, I hope that the commissions are 
staffed with honest people who will strictly abide by the law, 
regardless of their political convictions. Besides, one should 
not forget that in the opposite case, they may face 
administrative and criminal charges. 
  The presence of observers at the electoral districts is 
another condition for holding fair elections. The procedure for 
their appointment is quite democratic, and I think, there will 
be no problems here. 
  [Klaskowskaya] But still, is it possible that a candidate, 
having garnered the required number of votes, might trip over 
some bureaucratic obstacles or hit some hidden snag? 
  [Hurynovich] I see no such snags. Of course, if someone 
collects exactly 100,000 signatures, he might not be registered 
as a candidate. The district commissions are tasked with 
overseeing activities of initiating groups. In case of a 
violation on their part (for example, an individual signed for 
the same candidate on two different signature lists), all those 
100,000 votes are gone. I would advise signature collectors to 
be cautions regarding provocations. 
  [Klaskowskaya] In this situation, much depends on the 
electorate itself... 
  [Hurynovich] I would ask all the voters to treat the 
presidential elections very seriously. At this point, many of 
them find it difficult to determine their own position. Let me 
remind them again that the electoral law allows one voter to 
sign for several contenders for the presidential post [previous 
sentence published in boldface]. After that, they will get a 
chance to read their programs and determine which one they would 
vote for on 23 June.

  [Text] People's Deputy Alyaksandr Lukashenka yesterday 
began his meetings with Mahilyow residents. In the morning, he 
visited the oblast hospital and addressed medical personnel and 
patients who gathered in the hospital conference room. In a 
30-minute speech, he presented his opinion on the unification of 
the Belarusian and Russian monetary systems, privatization, and 
the Republic's sovereignty. 
  Alyaksandr Lukashenka did not speak of his presidential 
program. He only outlined its certain aspects and ways of 
implementing it, explaining that it was not an electoral address 
as such. Regarding the work of the Supreme Soviet commission he 
heads, Alyaksandr Hryhorovich pledged to conclude the corruption 
case.

  [Text] The Belarusian Ecological Party [Belaruskaya 
Ekolohichnaya Partyya -- BEP], which has recently been 
registered with the Ministry of Justice, pledges to protect 
everyone's right to clean air and water, healthy food, and a 
safe life on one's own land. In their platform statement, 
members of the new party call on all Belarusian citizens to 
personally participate in the environmental movement. Only 
this, in their opinion, can prevent the ecological and physical 
degradation of our nation. 
  The BEP announces that it intends to join the political 
battle, to have real influence on the work of the Belarusian 
Government and parliament.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Belarusian Foreign Ministry Receives </F>
Note From Russia"] 
  [Text] The Belarusian Foreign Ministry has received a note 
from the Russian Foreign Ministry saying that "the Russian 
Government adopted a decision to keep in line with generally 
accepted international practices, according to which official 
and working visits by heads of states and other representatives 
of the executive bodies of the CIS states, just as with other 
states, are subject to preliminary agreement through diplomatic 
channels. Visits to Russia -- not agreed upon previously -- by 
leaders of executive bodies of foreign states will be considered 
by Russia as private visits." As BELAPAN has been told by the 
Department of Bilateral Relations within the Foreign Ministry, 
this is an ordinary document specifying relations between 
sovereign states. In the opinion of representatives of the 
Belarusian Foreign Ministry, all contacts between our Republic 
and Russia should be coordinated by the Belarusian Foreign 
Ministry. By the way, the Russian side will also observe 
similar rules.

relations between Moldova and Belarus, due principally to 
Moldova's adherence to the CIS. Both premiers mentioned that 
currently all the barriers hindering trade between Moldova and 
Belarus are removed. Referring to the collaboration between 
these two countries in the sphere of foreign policy, Kebich 
declared to BASA that Moldova and Belarus will coordinate their 
actions in the international arena and will not oppose one 
another. Sangheli added that up to the present moment the 
republics had helped one another in the spheres of politics, 
economics, finance, banking, etc. The agreement stipulating 
mutual support in the international political and economic 
structures was also signed today. Mechislav Grib and other

is willing to grant for this purpose $9,000,000 and another 
$6,000,000 for creating a telephone station in Chisinau. The 
possibility of constructing a tile factory in the region was 
also discussed. The Turkish diplomats also met with

  [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS, 5/5/1994 -- Turkey provided 
equipment for a printing house in Moldova to print newspapers in 
Turkish with Latin script, stated to reporters Umut Arik, 
ambassador and chairman of the "Tica" International Cooperation 
Agency of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. According to 
Arik, Turkey intends to open a Moldovan-Turkish Center of 
Culture in Chisinau. The Turkish Government provided $50,000 for 
the construction of a brick factory. This sum represents only 
half of a loan granted by the Turkish Government. Goods 
produced in the East pass through Moldovan territory to the 
European market. Therefore, Turkey is willing to finance the 
building of a highway stretching 100 km to unite Moldova's 
borders. It will be connected to the future Giurgiulesti Port. 
"Turkey tries to assist properly and find finances for the 
construction of the port," said Arik. According to him, Moldova 
needs to improve its economy and especially its agricultural 
sector. From 23-28 May, a conference for the businessmen of 
Turkey and other countries will be held in Chisinau. It will 
analyze the possibilities of investment in the Moldovan economy 
and the legislation on foreign investments. According to Arik, 
the "Tica" agency will prepare several projects for developing 
the Moldovan economy to be forwarded to the World Bank and 
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. "Suleyman 
Demirel's visit to Moldova to take place on 1 June proves that 
Moldova constitutes a priority in Turkey's foreign relations," 
emphasized Arik.

<F P=106> [Report by Lyudmila Feliksova "CIS: Dead End or Way Out?"] </F>
  [Text] Chisinau -- Moldova joined the CIS to wails from 
the opposition about its loss of independence and about a new 
form of imperial oppression. But the opposition's opinion this 
year cannot influence the decisions of the ruling agrarian 
majority. All the more so as it is no secret that those who 
shout loudest about the loss of the Republic's independence are 
least interested in it. They mainly support unification with 
Romania and see Moldova's membership of the CIS as yet another 
major obstacle in the way of implementing their cherished dream 
of becoming part of the neighboring state. 
  But the CIS issue cannot be seen merely in black and white 
terms. It is much more complicated. The opponents also include 
people who have no desire to join Romania but who are worried 
that such a powerful country as Russia will dictate its 
political and economic will and turn Moldova into its satellite. 
  "That is the mentality in small countries," economist A. 
Muravskiy [name as transliterated], an agrarian deputy, told me. 
"They differ from big countries in being more sensitive to any 
infringement of their rights in a partnership." 
  Also cautious about the CIS are the so-called "Westerners," 
who see the cure to all their ills as lying in the opposite 
direction to the east. But many economists believe that it will 
be impossible for the Republic to break into the Western market 
in the immediate future. At any rate, the first two months of 
this year cannot be called a success. Relations with the far 
abroad are as follows -- the Republic's imports exceeded its 
exports fourfold. And the bulk of these shipments were paid for 
with hard currency. Is it possible in this situation to 
seriously talk about entering the Western market or at least of 
balancing foreign trade? 
  Paradoxically, it will be easier for Moldova to team up with 
the West by going through the eastern market. So, whichever way 
you slice it -- whether it be tough or desirable -- the CIS is a 
necessity for Moldova. On the basis of the results of the first 
two months of the year the CIS countries account for around 75 
percent of Moldova's foreign trade turnover. And the main 
country is Russia. It accounts for almost 62 percent, and is 
followed by Ukraine (6.5 percent) and Belorussia [Belarus] (2.3 
percent). But even here Moldova's trade is by no means in the 
black. Its deficit is 137 million lei. Under the corresponding 
article of the treaty, CIS membership means for Moldova freer 
movement of goods, services, money, and labor, coordination of 
its monetary, credit, and fiscal policy, and more acceptable 
customs duties -- and, consequently, prices for goods. 
  But this decision -- long-awaited by some and undesirable 
for 
others -- will not of itself make things any easier overnight. 
This is already clear even to the most convinced supporters of 
the Commonwealth, who have lived through the period of naive 
romanticism when it had seemed that it would be enough to sign 
the treaty and the economic wheel would move toward 
stabilization. The political train, crushing the old economy 
underneath it, has gone a long way. Whether forward or backward 
-- only time will tell, but there is no doubt that other 
realities have emerged. Just as something else is obvious too. 
The new economy to back up those realities has not yet emerged. 
We are merely calculating our losses. Moldova remains without 
any industry. Whereas a few years ago industry accounted for 67 
percent when it came to forming the budget, last year it 
accounted for just 9.3 percent. And the slump has not been 
halted. 
  It will hardly be possible to rapidly restore our broken 
ties. And Moldovan Prime Minister A. Sangheli sees their loss as 
one of the main causes of the current crisis.

  [Excerpts] The Cabinet of Ministers has adopted a 
resolution -- international and interstate transit rail freight 
by the republican railways will be done on the basis of 
agreements on international railway goods traffic. 
  With the aim to ensure that railway traffic costs are paid 
in 
full on international and interstate routes (in the Commonwealth 
of Independent States) and to speed up payments, it was decided 
that as of 1 May 1994, international and interstate railway 
freight will be in accordance with the agreement on 
international railway cargo carriage, which came into force on 1 
November 1951. [passage omitted] 
  In accordance with the existing international practice of 
charging, it will be done by a dispatcher of freight at the 
station of shipment for the distance from the shipment station 
to the border exit railway station of the Republic of 
Kazakhstan. For transit freight on the CIS railway routes -- 
through forwarding agents, which are set up by railways, 
juridical bodies, or individuals, irrespective of their form of 
ownership. The recipient of shipment is expected to pay for the 
distance between the exit railway station of the Republic of 
Kazakhstan and the station of designation. 
  The Ministry of Transport has been instructed to determine a 
procedure agreed to by the railway administrations of 
neighboring CIS states for applying tariffs and calculating 
freight charges for haulage, carried out by residents of 
Kazakhstan at railway stations, located on the territory of 
Kazakhstan and not belonging to the railways of the Russian 
Federation, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan. The ministry is also 
expected to elaborate a procedure on applying clauses of an 
agreement on shipment documents and on carriage charging costs 
on international and interstate routes. Rates of additional tax 
will be endorsed in case of exceptional cargo value and a tax on 
amends to freight agreements, introduced at the request of a 
freight-owner. [passage omitted] Freight rates will be computed 
in Swiss francs. 
  Tariffs for the transit of other state's goods by 
Kazakhstan's railways will be in hard currency or any other 
agreed currency. Residents of the Republic will pay national 
currency -- tenge -- for export-import freight of goods within 
Kazakhstan and for the same kind of freight. Nonresidents of 
the Republic are expected to pay in Kazakhstan's national 
currency or hard currency. 
  Conversion of hard currency into tenge will be done 
according 
to the National Bank's of Kazakhstan exchange rate on the day of 
payment. 
  It is established that compulsory sales of currency earnings 
received for freight of goods is done after placing them to 
railways's hard currency accounts.

  [Text] Dushanbe 8 May TASS -- The situation at the 
Tajik-Afghan border was relatively calm over the past 
twenty-four hours. However, the situation on the whole remains 
utterly alarming, and the command of Russian border troops in 
Tajikistan do not rule out the possibility of fresh large-scale 
provocations at the border within the next few days. 
Provocations may be engineered by Tajik opposition militants 
who entrenched themselves in Afghanistan's northern provinces, 
TASS learned from well-informed military sources on Sunday [8 
May]. 
  The same sources reported that Tajik militants continued 
massing on Afghan territory in close proximity to the border 
with Tajikistan, with an obvious aim to attempt a breakthrough 
into the former Soviet Republic. 
  Similar attempts have already been thwarted at the Shurobad 
and Pyandzh border segments on Friday and Saturday by means of 
mass artillery and rocket fire, a spokesman for Russian border 
troops in Tajikistan said. He stressed that the enemy should 
know that such provocations would not go unpunished. Russian 
border guards and Tajik national security forces have enough 
weapons and ammunition to foil any attempts of aggression from 
outside. This was announced unequivocally by the commander of 
Russian border troops in Tajikistan, Lieutenant General Anatoliy 
Chechulin, at a recent news conference for local and foreign 
journalists, the spokesman recalled.

    [Editorial Report] Moscow Mayak Radio Network in Russian at 
1308 GMT on 6 May carries a four-minute live report from 
Dushanbe by Mayak correspondent Arisher Khadzhayev, who gives 
details of the attempted assassination of Former Tajik Vice 
President Narzullo Dustov, and the unrelated killings of six

  Khadzhayev begins by saying: "The following news spread 
around Dushanbe this morning, although no one reported it 
officially: Unknown persons, presumably two in number, made an 
attempt yesterday evening on the life of Former Vice President 
of Tajikistan Narzullo Dustov right outside his home. He was 
wounded in the leg. His bodyguard was shot twice. They are now 
both in hospital." 
  Khadzhayev further says: "A number of suspects" were 
detained 
and an investigation was underway. He then continues: 
  "Another piece of tragic news has come into the Mayak office 
from Kofirnikhonskiy rayon outside Dushanbe. According to 
preliminary information, six people were killed there last 
night. No motive for the murders has yet been established." 
  The rest of Khadzhayev's report was devoted to the hardships 
facing Tajikistan's elderly World War II veterans and local 
charitable efforts to help them.

  [Text] Ashgabat, 6 May -- The joint protection of 
Turkmenistan's state border was discussed today during a meeting 
between Turkmenistan President Saparmurad Niyazov and Lieutenant 
General Aleksandr Bespalov, deputy commander of the Russian 
Federation border troops. 
  Methods were defined for the implementation of the 
intergovernment treaty between Turkmenistan and Russia, signed 
at the end of 1993, on the joint protection of Turkmenistan's 
borders, and on the status of Russian Federation servicemen in 
the Republic. Aleksandr Bespalov said "the formation of an 
operational group of Russian border troops which is being set up 
in accordance with the intergovernment treaty, has been 
completed." 
  Issues related to insuring the functioning of the 
operational 
group in close cooperation with the Turkmenistan border troops 
were also examined at the meeting. This kind of cooperation 
meets the mutual interests of the two countries and insures 
their security at Turkmenistan's state border.

  [Text] Turkmenstan's President Saparmurat Niyazov has 
notified his Ukrainian counterpart Leonid Kravchuk of Ashgabat's 
desire to resume gas supplies to Kiev. 
  As the acting Ukrainian Premier Efim Zvyagilski has told 
journalists in Ukraine's capital, Kiev set a counter term to cut 
the cost of gas from 52.5 dollars per one thousand cubic meters 
down to 40 dollars. However, Zvyagilski believes "Ashgabat is 
unlikely to accept the offered price." In his opinion, $50 for 
one thousand cubic meters (the price that Ukraine pays for gas 
from Russia) "can satisfy both sides." 
  Turkmenia discontinued gas delivery to Ukraine in February 
because of Ukraine's failure to pay off $650 million in fuel 
debts. 
  Meanwhile, according to Zvyagilski, Ukraine has enough gas 
today. More than that, it has been able to save up to 20-25 
million cubic meters of gas a month for a rainy day.

Republic for deepening economic reforms. The speaker noted that 
good conditions have been formed in the Republic for work on the 
new stage of the reforms. The way is now wide open for 
developing private property and its legal protection. The 
process of removing from state control and privatization is 
gaining momentum. The president of the Republic particularly 
touched on the question about the development of the social 
infrastructure in the countryside. He also talked widely on the 
question about the upcoming introduction of the national 
currency. The speech also analyzed the foreign economic 
activities of the young state. Concluding his speech, Islam 
Karimov said that we are looking at the future with great hopes 
and our intentions are [words indistinct] and only selfless 
effort will bring us [words indistinct]. 
  The Supreme Council of Uzbekistan adopted a decision on the 
speech of the president of the Republic. According to this 
document, the work carried in the republic for the 
stage-by-stage reform of society and transfer to a socially 
orientated market economy is approved, and the conditions and 
conclusions of the recent speeches by the president of the 
Republic of Uzbekistan are supported. They have been adopted 
for undeviating implementation and guidance. 
  The deputies then began the examination of the establishment 
of the order of Uzbekistan Kahrimoni [Hero of Uzbekistan] and 
the highest order of perfection, the medal Oltin Yulduz [The 
Gold Star], the orders Mustakilik [Independence], Dustlik 
[Friendship], the medals Jasorat [Courage], and Shuhrat [Glory]. 
The session approved the orders and medals of the sovereign 
state. The president of the republic proposed that in line with 
the upcoming Victory Day that the Jasorat medal be awarded to 
all participants in the Great Patriotic War and the home front. 
The session approved this proposal. At a proposal by a group of 
peoples deputies the question of awarding the order Uzbekistan 
Kahrimoni to Islam Karimov, president of the Republic of 
Uzbekistan was examined. Speaking on this question Vitaliy 
Nikolayevich [last name indistinct], peoples deputy and the 
director of the Almalyk mining and metallurgical combinat, said: 
  [Begin Vitaliy recording] Esteemed deputies! The many 
thousand miners collective's and gold miners think that the 
first citizen of the Republic of Uzbekistan ought to receive the 
order of Hero of Uzbekistan, Islam Abdulghaniyevich Karimov, 
president of the Republic [loud applause]. I think that there 
is no doubt here because the services of the president, comrade 
Karimov, are well known to the whole world. It is difficult to 
count his services here but the most important thing is, and we 
must agree on this, that the republic is living in peace and 
tranquility. For the sake of this our president [words 
indistinct], his health, and as they say with his life. To 
confirm my words I will bring you a small example. Exactly 
three years ago Islam Abdulghaniyevich decided to start the 
production of gold currency in the Republic. Uzbekistan is the 
first country to have done this in the CIS after Russia, where 
gold currency is produced. It is good that today we adopted the 
law on orders. Islam Abdulghaniyevch we congratulate you from 
all our heart! [loud applause] Wish you good health! [loud 
applause] [end recording] 
  The Supreme Council of the Republic of Uzbekistan then 
decided to award Islam Abdulghaniyevich Karimov, president of 
the Republic of Uzbekistan, with the title of Uzbekistan 
Kahrimoni and the highest order of perfection, the Oltin Yulduz 
medal, for outstanding contribution to the creation of the 
sovereign and independent Uzbekistan, the creation of a humane, 
democratic and legal state, guaranteeing civil peace and 
national accord, and for the firmness and courage shown in this. 
  During the second half of the day the session continued its 
work under the chairmanship of Boris Budrov, deputy chairman of 
the Supreme Council. The peoples deputies examined a large 
number of questions on the agenda. The deputies discussed the 
drafts of the constitutional law on the Aliy Majlis of the 
Republic of Uzbekistan, the law on elections of peoples deputies 
in the oblast, rayon, and city soviets, and on guarantees for 
the voting rights of citizens. The deputies adopted a decision 
on approving these laws in their first reading. 
  The peoples deputies listened and discussed the draft laws 
on 
foreign investments and guaranteeing the activities of foreign 
investors, on bankruptcy and taxes, and on operations involving 
valuable papers. These laws were confirmed. The session also 
adopted in their first reading the code of the Republic of 
Uzbekistan on crimes and punishment and the criminal and 
procedural code. Today, the 15th session of the 12th 
convocation of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Uzbekistan 
continues its work.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: No 86 (576)] </F>
  [Text] President Leonid Kravchuk hopes that the Supreme 
Soviet of a new convocation will ratify the agreements on 
economic cooperation between the United States and Ukraine 
signed this January during Kravchuk's visit to the United 
States. Kravchuk declared about this during his meeting with 
the head of the U.S. economic delegation Nicholas Burns in Kiev. 
The delegation of the American experts came to Ukraine to get 
acquainted with the economic situation in the republic and to 
determine possibilities to use economic aid to Ukraine totaling 
350 million dollars. 
  After this meeting Kravchuk reported to journalists that the 
United States intends to render assistance to Ukraine in order 
to re-struct [as received] its economy and to develop 
cooperation with the republic in the field of trade and 
investments. 
  In Burns' words, a Ukrainian-American fund in support of 
entrepreneurs in Ukraine will be created this summer. It will 
grant credits and loans to Ukrainian private entrepreneurs. 
  Our Interfax correspondent reports from Kiev that at the 
negotiations with the members of the American economic 
delegation underway in Kiev the Ukrainian party proposed to use 
part of the allocated credit as a pledge to receive credit from 
one of the large foreign banks. According to Ukraine's 
Economics Minister Roman Shpek, Kiev is not ready "to use 350 
million dollars in the near future." 
  Leadership of the Ukrainian cabinet was critical of 
Washington's position which presented too many provisions in 
order to grant concrete economic assistance. In particular, as 
Vice Premier Valentin Landik said, in accordance with the 
proposals of the American party 95 million dollars in support of 
private undertaking would be allocated only after refusal from 
rent as a means of denationalization of property. 
  In the opinion of the American experts, rent can hinder 
"voucher privatization" which they view as the most efficient 
method to reform the property. 
  Landik called members of the American delegation to decline 
the above mentioned provisions and private calls "to start 
reforms." 
  In Landik's words, diminishing of the inflation to 5.7 
percent and beginning of privatization testify to the fact that 
reforms in Ukraine have been started and they need concrete 
support. 
  At the negotiations the American party also persisted in 
introduction of a market exchange rate of the Ukrainian 
karbovanets with respect to hard currency. For his part, Landik 
declared that "the state will preserve regulation of the 
karbovanets rate in the course of the crisis' surmounting." 
  In his interview with Interfax on Thursday Landik declared 
that the resolution of the Ukrainian government On Urgent 
Measures to Surmount the Payment Crisis issued on Wednesday 
called to grant an opportunity to enterprises "to unfold their 
wings" and to go out of the non-payments' crisis peculiar to all 
former Soviet states. 
  According to Landik, lowering of tariffs for the value added 
tax (to 20 percent) and replacement of income tax for profit 
(since January 1, 1995) should assist in improving financial 
situation of the Ukrainian enterprises. 
  As Landik noted, introduction of increased rates for customs 
tariffs for import of alcoholic beverages and tobacco goods is 
primarily intended to protect a Ukrainian producer. At the same 
time he pointed out that this measure does not concern import 
from CIS countries, including Russia. "From now on import 
tariffs will be revised every week, this will help to quickly 
react to the market's economic conditions," Landik reported. 
  Commenting the situation on the introduction of state 
monopoly for production and trade with alcoholic beverages, 
Landik said that Ukraine's Cabinet of Minister had examined 
Russia's experience but it would predominantly use Austria's 
experience.

  [Text] A UNIAN correspondent was informed by the Japanese 
Embassy in Ukraine that out of the $100 million allocated by the 
Japanese Government to dismantling the nuclear weapons of 
Kazakhstan, Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, our country will 
receive $16 million, with Japan expecting specific projects [to 
be implemented] by Ukraine using this money. 
  Ukraine's Foreign Affairs Ministry says that both countries 
are in the process of drafting a joint declaration on the 
principles of cooperation between Ukraine and Japan, a 
memorandum of understanding between the two states' foreign 
political departments, and an intergovernmental agreement on the 
mutual encouragement and protection of investments, as well as 
working to settle the issue of Ukraine's legal succession with 
regard to the contractual and legal basis that was formed in 
relations between Japan and the former USSR.

<F P=106> [Interview with Anatoliy Lopata, chief of the Ukraine </F>
General Staff, by Vladimir Katin, RIA's own correspondent at 
NATO, specially for NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA in the "Exclusive" 
column: "Anatoliy Lopata: `I Have No Doubts That Russia Will 
Also Join the Partnership for Peace Program'" -- in Brussels; 
date not given] 
  [Text] Last week in Evers, a suburb of the Belgian 
capital, a session of the NATO Military Committee was held, 
attended by military leaders of some CIS countries. RIA's 
correspondent met and had a talk with Anatoliy Lopata, chief of 
the Ukraine Armed Forces General Staff. 
  [Katin] Mr. General, as far as I know, this is the third 
time that you have participated in such sessions. Ukraine is 
not an outside observer in this military organization; it 
already has one foot in NATO: I mean the joining of the 
Partnership for Peace program. As a result, Russia has found 
itself in a situation in which, via Ukraine, NATO directly 
pushes against its lengthy Western ground and also sea borders. 
Presumably Kiev's policy is more oriented toward the West than 
toward its traditional ally? The impression is that Russia's 
interests are being ignored. 
  [Lopata] I do not like the statement that Ukraine has one 
foot in NATO. Ukraine simply supports the Partnership for Peace 
program. Actually this means support of peace and stability in 
Europe. Tell me, is this bad? I consider this a universal 
task. Now you say that through Ukraine's participation in the 
Partnership program, NATO is approaching Russia's borders. I 
personally have no doubt that Russia will also join the 
Partnership. Yet, this does not at all mean that NATO has 
opened all the doors for us. The meaning of the Partnership is, 
by joint, coalition-based actions, to facilitate the 
preservation of peace in Europe, prevent an outbreak of war, put 
an end to internecine fighting, and stop bloodshed wherever it 
occurs. Russia cannot exclude itself from participation in 
addressing these tasks and therefore it cannot but accept the 
Partnership program. I have no doubts on this count. After 
all, Russia is already doing very much to stabilize the 
situation in various regions of the world. 
  [Katin] At what stage of cooperation with NATO is Ukraine at 
present and what is being done in practical terms? 
  [Lopata] We have signed what is basically a framework 
agreement with NATO. Now the possibility is being considered of 
allocating forces and funds as our contribution toward 
implementing some joint tasks with NATO. I do not think that at 
the moment these will be large or complex tasks. After all, 
such participation also has an economic aspect -- expenses. But 
even now we can prepare and send our military units for 
participation in joint actions with NATO. This, however, cannot 
be more than one battalion with reinforcements. 
  [Katin] If I understand you correctly, this year Ukraine is 
ready to enter the phase, as you say, of implementing practical 
tasks in interaction with NATO units; is that right? 
  [Lopata] Absolutely. This can begin in the current year. 
You know that two of our battalions are now operating in former 
Yugoslavia. We put them at the UN Security Council's disposal. 
To be sure, Partnership is quite another program, but so far we 
have the right to send a mere 1,220 military personnel: 
soldiers, officers, and observers. Such is the will of our 
parliament. This is the size of the contingent allowed to be 
kept outside the country. It seems that a new parliament, which 
will start working in the very near future, will adopt more 
definitive legislation on this score. 
  [Katin] Let us return to the "Partnership for Peace" 
program. You think that Russia will finally accept this 
program, join it. But you must be aware that in Russia this 
approach has been formulated as follows: We may join it, but 
not on the terms on which, say, Albania or Estonia did it. What 
is your view on such an approach? 
  [Lopata] This is a very wrong approach. If we are to be 
partners -- I underline in boldface -- partners, then relations 
within the program should also be partner-like, that is, honest 
and equal with regard to rights and obligations. We have not 
yet talked about how many troops or how much money one member or 
another should provide. What we are talking about is that 
everyone may participate with as many resources as he has at his 
disposal in fulfilling joint missions to keep peace and 
stability in one region or another... But to demand that a 
special status be given means to place oneself above your 
partners. In this case there will be no partnership. I repeat: 
partnership is equality of all members. 
  [Katin] How do your assess the current state of 
Russian-Ukrainian military relations? 
  [Lopata] Our relations with Russia are currently undergoing 
a difficult period. The reason for this instability is 
uncertainty regarding the Black Sea Fleet problem. The Black 
Sea Fleet is a stumbling block that precludes us from reaching 
understanding. What is the reason here? The problem is not how 
to split the fleet. Precisely this problem can be resolved 
fairly easily. Everyone understands that -- both the Russian 
side and the Ukrainian side. The main problem is the Black Sea 
Fleet infrastructure, its basing on Ukrainian territory. It is 
here that we encounter many complex nuances that should be 
resolved both at the political level and at the level of defense 
ministers. We should make it clear where Ukraine's fleet will 
be based and where Russia's will be. If a corresponding 
political decision is made, we should determine what, how, and 
on what terms should be given to Russia from this 
infrastructure, say, with regard to bases... By raising the 
question like this we, in turn, create the need to resolve the 
problem of mutual payments. I hope you understand me. This is 
why these should be very well balanced, respectful relations. 
One should not forget that relations between Ukraine and 
Russia, relations between our two peoples, largely shape the 
overall situation in Europe. This is why I would like our 
problem to be resolved in the worthiest and gentlest manner 
possible. I am completely certain that we will be able to 
untangle these knots. Without fail! This is just a matter of 
time and... personalities who are dealing directly with the 
entire range of matters. The role of personalities has its own 
significance. I would like experienced specialists to deal with 
that, so that people will look somewhat farther than the present 
day, so that they will see the prospects for the evolution of 
our peoples. We should be attuned only to benevolent prospects, 
for they are for the whole life. The way current problems are 
being settled will determine our future, the future of our 
children and grandchildren, their relations. This is why we 
should act competently and respectfully with regard to each 
other.

  [Text] Certain European countries condition Ukraine's 
signing of the Treaty on Partnership and Cooperation with the 
European Union with ratification of the Treaty on 
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons by the Ukrainian 
parliament. This was said by Ukrainian Foreign Minister 
Anatoliy Zlenko at a press conference in Kiev today. 
  Zlenko said he had heard this "disturbing note" during his 
talks with Deputy Chairman of the EU [European Union] 
Commission, the European Commissions Commissioner for Foreign 
Economy Leon Britten which had finished in Kiev today. 
  "We do not yet know the names of these states, however such 
an approach is unacceptable for us," Zlenko emphasized. He 
stressed that Ukraine was carrying out the trilateral statement 
on nuclear disarmament made by the U.S., Russian and Ukrainian 
presidents. He added that the Ukrainian leadership was doing 
everything possible in order to join the treaty on 
non-proliferation. 
  Zlenko suggested that the conditioning of the treaty on 
cooperation with that on non-proliferation could create a 
"dangerous precedent." He said this could be in the interests 
of forces trying to put Ukraine in a difficult situation from 
the point of view of international public opinion. 
  Britten stated that the EU leaders had never sought to 
establish an inter-dependence between the two documents and 
urged the countries which had put forward such a condition to 
disassociate themselves from it. However, Britten called on the 
Ukrainian leadership to speed up ratification of the Treaty on 
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. 
  Britten said that the EU would consider possible assistance 
to Ukraine with construction of two energy blocks on two nuclear 
power stations, which would help Ukraine with energy supply and 
put the Chernobyl nuclear power station out of utilization. 
  Britten told INTERFAX-Ukraine that the amount of aid had not 
as yet been defined and would depend on what aid the world 
community would be able to give to Ukraine. He added that the 
issue on the Chernobyl nuclear power station would be discussed 
at the G-7 meeting this summer. 
  Britten also announced that a Treaty on Partnership and 
Cooperation between the EU and Russia had been worked out. It 
would be submitted to the EU leading bodies in the near future.

  [Text] As a full-fledged European state, Ukraine should 
play a considerable role in the European economic and political 
space. Ukrainian Foreign Affairs Minister Anatoliy Zlenko said 
this at a joint news conference with Leon Brittan, deputy 
chairman of the European Union commission and commissioner for 
external economic affairs. 
  Zlenko emphasized that the legal and treaty basis for 
cooperation should be the agreement on partnership and 
cooperation between Ukraine and the European Union, which opens 
up the prospect for associate membership in this structure. The 
minister expressed the hope that the agreement would be signed 
by the head of the Ukrainian state. Zlenko also said that the 
direction of cooperation with the European Union in the areas of 
agriculture, nuclear safety, energy provision, and 
macroeconomics had been discussed and that an exchange of 
opinions on issues of European security and other international 
problems had taken place during the course of Brittan's stay in 
Ukraine.

  [Text] The Ukrainian leaders and the deputy chairman of the 
European Union's Commission Leon Brittan agreed that very soon 
Ukraine would appeal to the Commission for a 200 Mn [million] 
ECU food loan. Along with this, Ukraine would be allowed to 
export farm produce to the European marketplace. It would use 
part of the profits to purchase pesticides. 
  Brittan met with the Ukrainian leaders on 5 May. The 
Ukrainian Government requested him to drop Ukraine from the C 
List of nations with government-controled economies. The 
European Union placed restrictions on imports from the countries 
of the C List. 
  According to Brittan, the European Union would be willing to 
help Ukraine in the field of power production and encourage free 
enterprise in that republic. But, he said, Ukraine would be 
taken off the C List only if it made progress on the road for 
economic liberalization and, more specifically, privatization. 
More reform in Ukraine would enable the European Union to speed 
up moves to lift the anti-dumping restrictions. 
  Brittan wanted to know when Ukraine was going to pay off the 
European Union's 4.5 Mn ECU loan. Ukrainian Finance Minister 
Grigoriy Piatachenko said Kiev would square its debt with the 
European Union by mid-May or before the European Union's 
Commission sat down to decide whether to render more aid to 
Ukraine.

  [Text] Kiev, 7 May--"If there is good will and moderation 
in actions, then any problems can be resolved," Max van der 
Stoel, CSCE high commissioner for minorities, stressed at a news 
conference. Having familiarized himself with the state of 
interethnic relations in Ukraine, his mission there is to get an 
opportunity to make certain recommendations to the government in 
order to prevent the emergence of conflict situations. Mr. van 
der Stoel visited Crimea and Donetsk Oblasts. He intends to 
pass his recommendations to the Ukrainian Government in the near 
future. 
  Although there are certain problems in the regions, I did 
not 
notice any symptoms of interethnic hostility, the high 
commissioner noted. He also noted the liberality of Ukrainian 
legislation in issues of ethnic minorities. As far as the 
situation in Crimea is concerned, I did not notice any cases of 
forced Ukrainianization in the autonomy. On the contrary, one 
could describe some of the Crimeans' views as separatist ones, 
van der Stoel noted, and emphasized that the international 
community is in favor of Ukraine's territorial integrity. The 
CSCE high commissioner noted that consultations between the 
leaders of the state and the regions would be of great benefit 
to both sides and stressed the necessity of avoiding any 
provocative actions, which could lead to the situation becoming 
more complicated.

<F P=106> [Interview with French Minister for European Affairs Alain </F>
Lamassoure by HOLOS UKRAYINY correspondent Volodymyr Savtsov, in 
Kiev; date not given: "In Mutual Interests"] 
  [Text] [Savtsov] How do you assess the state of 
Franco-Ukrainian relations? 
  [Lamassoure] Our relations with Ukraine, which were 
established from the very start of Ukrainian independence, are 
developing at a satisfactory level. My visit is a concrete 
manifestation of the interest in your country, an interest that 
has never faded in France. 
  We know that Ukraine is going through an uncommon period 
when 
the population experiences great difficulties. We realize that 
the road toward a market economy cannot be covered overnight. 
The transitional period is always quite long and difficult. 
However, as follows from experience, the longer important 
decisions are delayed, the longer and more difficult the road 
will be. We, therefore, hope that Ukraine develops, as soon as 
possible, its own economic program, which will enable it to 
receive international assistance. 
  [Savtsov] What specific trends are there in our cooperation? 
  [Lamassoure] France is an active participant in the G-7 
highly developed Western countries striving to improve nuclear 
safety in the CIS countries, and in particular in Ukraine. 
French public opinion is attentively following the danger to 
which the entire European continent and, first and foremost 
Ukraine, may be exposed by the continued operation of the 
Chernobyl nuclear power station. Recent incidents have added to 
our concern. For this particular reason, the French authorities 
believe that it is necessary to reach an urgent decision, so 
that all reactors at Chernobyl can be closed down as soon as 
possible. G-7 has already looked into this issue during the 
summit in Munich in 1992, when a special fund was created for 
the purpose. Concern was also voiced at the 1993 summit in 
Tokyo. On our initiative, this issue will be among the 
principal ones on the agenda at the summit in Naples this coming 
July. However, the efficiency of the G-7's actions also depends 
upon the level of cooperation with the Ukrainian authorities. I 
want to assure you that, in any case, France will take an active 
part in the quest for a decision and in the work that will be 
conducted. Our methods of expert analysis and our know-how have 
been recognized by the entire international community. We will 
grant this know-how to Ukraine. 
  There are many other spheres in which we can cooperate. The 
determination of policy in the area of power engineering, in 
particular, in energy conservation, may become a area for useful 
cooperation, because France has much experience in this field. 
I might also remind you about the assistance in the 
establishment of a law-governed state and of all the related 
institutions. We are also ready to take part in training 
specialists, in particular, the necessary personnel for a market 
economy. 
  [Savtsov] Does our cooperation have a chance of expanding to 
European dimensions? 
  [Lamassoure] We are very dedicated to European stability. 
In terms of its size and geographical situation, Ukraine is an 
important element in this stability. In January 1994, we 
welcomed your achievements in the sphere of disarmament. We 
hope that yet another step will be made after Ukraine ratifies 
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. 
  Ukraine wants to live in peace with its neighbors. That is 
why we are pleased with your government's participation in the 
constituent conference dealing with the European Stability Pact, 
which will be held in Paris at the end of May. The European 
Union has adopted the French initiative, which is expected to 
help on finding pragmatic solutions to problems that may arise 
between the states of central and eastern Europe, more 
specifically, on minorities issues. We want Ukraine to take an 
active part in resolving these problems. 
  [Savtsov] Thank you for the interview.

  [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk has sent a 
letter to the residents of the Republic of Crimea. It says in 
part: Please accept my sincere greetings in connection with the 
glorious date of the 50th anniversary of the liberation of 
Crimea from the German fascist invaders. The defense and 
liberation of Crimea is one of the brightest pages in the war, 
an example of the heroism and courage shown by people defending 
their native land. 
  We now have to live through a difficult time. The changes 
our society needs are taking place with great difficulty. But, 
the latter says, we have to go down the path of change and I 
hope we will manage to go down it, preserving what people have 
that is most precious -- accord, mutual understanding, friendly 
relations between one another.

<F P=106> [Interview with Minister of Defense Vitaliy Radetskyy by </F>
Mykola Motornyy; place and date not given: "We Will Fulfill Our 
Duty To Defend Ukraine!"] 
  [Text] [Motornyy] Vitaliy Hryhorovych, in a few days, 
Ukraine will celebrate the 49th anniversary of the victory over 
the fascist invaders. You were born at the end of the war. Do 
you remember your first Victory Day? 
  [Radetskyy] I remember how mother was preparing for this 
holiday. She baked patties and laid a festive table. The 
entire family was assembled. They remembered the strenuous war 
years. As a matter of fact, 9 May has become sanctified. So 
much blood was shed, so many people died, and so much property 
was burned down! Almost every Ukrainian family suffered. At 
that time nobody asked who did what during the war -- everybody 
did everything for the common cause and defended his fatherland. 
Besides, my father, a participant in the war, told much about 
the fighting at the front. His elder brother commanded a 
regiment. Our family has always held this day in esteem. 
  I am sure that the present changes in Ukraine must not 
change 
the attitude toward veterans and toward the heroic deeds on all 
the fronts against the fascists. The people fought against an 
enemy who had come to enslave us. Today our veterans deserve 
more attention from the state and a better life. I have 
instructed deputy defense ministers, chiefs of central 
administrations, and commanders of the armed services and of 
Ukraine's Armed Forces districts to take care of communal graves 
and monuments and to greet the veterans. Let us be frank, we 
have not created suitable conditions for their lives. This is 
our common holiday, a day that we tried to bring nearer as much 
as we could. 
  [Motornyy] How will the holiday be marked by the troops. 
  [Radetskyy] On 9 May, we will hold solemn ceremonies, 
evening roll-calls, we will march with songs and bands, and, of 
course, fire the salute. 
  This year, we will celebrate the 50th anniversary of 
Ukraine's liberation and next May the 50th anniversary of 
victory. A special badge to mark the 50th anniversary of 
Ukraine's liberation has been designed. There will also be a 
medal. At present, our administration for personnel and 
mobilization must compile lists of veterans. We must do 
everything in order not to overlook anyone. Our ministry is 
trying to see to it that the veterans get their pensions on 
time. I will personally greet all the Heroes of the Soviet 
Union and holders of the three grades of glory. Incidentally, in 
the capital alone, there reside more than 150 Heroes. An order 
has already been issued for Ukraine's Armed Forces servicemen to 
visit the hospitals. Young soldiers will visit and greet 
veterans -- soldiers and officers. 
  [Motornyy] What is your attitude toward the Soviet Army's 
combat and military patriotic traditions? 
  [Radetskyy] Whether we want it or not, there exists the 
history of the former USSR, no matter how hard some people try 
to erase it. We have actually grown out of that history. It is 
the history of our fathers, grandfathers, and great 
grandfathers. Not everything was bad there. We must know about 
this and draw conclusions from that history. People have become 
used to extremes. First the monuments are erected, and now we 
want to destroy them right away. Leave them alone, so that they 
can remind us of those who made mistakes or committed crimes 
against their people. So that they will never be repeated. 
  We must now have great respect for those who fought for 
Ukraine's independence in the ranks of the Soviet Army and for 
those who liberated the homeland in the ranks of the Ukrainian 
Insurrection Army. In my opinion, it is still difficult to 
assess the events that happened half a century ago. We must 
find out who did what and where during the war and after it. We 
must thoroughly study history and the archives. Today we must 
pay tribute to those people who fought for the liberation and 
independence of the Ukrainian state. It is up to history to sort 
out on whose side and how they did it. Time is the best teacher. 
  Now about traditions. We must look upon them in a somewhat 
broader way -- not only during the times of the former USSR. We 
will go back to the Bohdan Khmelnytskyy period. Patriotism was 
always appreciated, and the defender-warrior was held in esteem. 
Thus, everything that was good must be taken on by the Ukrainian 
Army and everything positive must be used, multiplied, and 
developed. Everything negative must serve as a lesson for the 
future. We must not repeat the mistakes of previous 
generations. We must change the people's mentality. Take 
[writer Aleksandr] Solzhenitsyn. He asserts in IZVESTIYA that 
Ukraine and Belarus cannot exist separately and that they must 
be within Russia. However, the United States and Canada can 
peacefully coexist. Why can we not coexist with Russia, Poland, 
Belarus, or Moldova? 
  [Motornyy] At this stage of building the Ukrainian State, we 
are in very bad need of modern armed forces that can defend the 
Ukrainian people. What are the components of our army's combat 
readiness? 
  [Radetskyy] From the former Soviet Union, we inherited 
three military districts, the fleet, the Air Force, and the air 
defense. Earlier, it was fashionable to reform the army 
[allusion to former defense minister Morozov]. Namely, reduce 
or increase the amount of military technology or personnel. At 
present, we must not engage in reforms, but build our Armed 
Forces with a view to the future. Not a single state can exist 
without an institution of armed forces. It is one of the major 
guarantees of security for every country. 
  Two important issues were discussed at a recent committee of 
the Defense Ministry. The first concerned the plan for building 
the Armed Forces for the period between 1994 and 2010. The 
second dealt with the training of personnel, in particular, 
officers. The thing is that, during the transitional period, we 
not only sustained material losses; there also were shortcomings 
in the training of personnel and specialists, and in methods. 
  I believe that modern Ukrainian Armed Forces must not be 
large, but must be mobile, flexible, and equipped with 
up-to-date combat technology. They must be led by well-trained 
specialists. At present, we are raising the question of a mixed 
principle of bringing the army up to strength -- compulsory 
regular service and service on a contractual basis. This is 
cheaper for the state. It is better to deal with specialists 
who are in perfect command of tanks, launchers, or radar 
stations, than with young people who have just come from 
institutes of higher learning, collective farms, or factories. 
For a year and a half to two years, the soldier will only just 
master the complex technology. When will he actually serve?! 
  Of course, in order to build a contemporary army, we need a 
strong economy. It is precisely the economy that determines 
everything, and in particular the combat readiness of the Armed 
Forces. 
  [Motornyy] Vitaliy Hryhorovych, despite our poverty, do the 
Armed Forces get proper attention? 
  [Radetskyy] Despite the difficult economic situation in 
Ukraine, we feel concern about our defender-warriors. It is 
pleasant to realize that the president, the government, and the 
main thing -- the Ukrainian people, simple laborers -- 
understand this. The numerical strength of our personnel has 
been specified. Ukraine's Armed Forces have three armed services 
-- ground, marine, and airborne defense. Of course, we do not 
receive funds and fuel in the way that we would like to, the way 
that it was done before, when gasoline flowed like a river and 
there was enough money. However, fuel and uniforms are being 
supplied in sufficient amounts, there is decent medical care, 
and officers are getting their salaries. Unfortunately, 
sometimes there are delays. There occur problems that do not 
even depend upon the minister of defense or upon the Cabinet of 
Ministers. 
  Our army now has well-trained units and formations capable 
of 
defending sovereign Ukraine. It is precisely for that purpose 
that the Ukrainian Army exists. Of course, it would be better 
to have an army that would even today be perfectly well equipped 
with weapons and technology on full combat readiness.... 
  On the eve of Victory Day, I want to report to the Ukrainian 
people that we are doing everything for the army to be able to 
do its direct duty -- the defense of Ukraine. Incidentally the 
Ukrainian Army enjoys a high rating among the population -- only 
the church is ahead of us. This has been confirmed by 
independent studies. Therefore, that tasks that the army is 
facing will be carried out with dignity. 
  I have become convinced that the army needs strong, 
courageous, and tough people, who are well trained both morally 
and physically. Sports occupy a leading position in it. Quite 
soon, soldiers will be examined for the winter term. In 
particular, everybody will be examined for physical fitness -- 
from soldiers to the defense minister. We will examine all the 
soldiers, the warrant officers, the officers, and the generals. 
  [Motornyy] What is your personal attitude toward sports 
activities? 
  [Radetskyy] In the past, I went in for boxing and the 
military triathlon. The minister of defense starts his working 
day at 0730 in the morning and finishes at 2100 or 2200. That 
is an everyday practice. I also work on Saturdays. I sometimes 
even go to work on Sundays. Not because I fail to complete my 
work on weekdays. Simply, it is quieter on days-off -- nobody 
calls you to various meetings. With such a workload, one simply 
cannot survive without sports. 
  [Motornyy] Among the readers of MOLOD UKRAYINY, there are 
many veterans of the great Patriotic War, the Ukrainian 
Insurrection Army, soldiers of the Armed Forces, and future 
defenders. What would you like to wish them on the eve of 
Victory Day? 
  [Radetskyy] We have always been MOLOD UKRAYINY's 
well-wishers (I am not saying this because its correspondent is 
sitting in my office). Your newspaper has always been loyal and 
understanding with regard to Ukraine's Armed Forces. It has 
never relished the shortcomings that we have, but perceived them 
as the concern of the entire society. I am very grateful to 
journalists for their support of the army. Of course, we must 
be criticized, but in a just manner. Taking this opportunity, I 
want to express my personal gratitude, as well as that of the 
military board and the entire officers' corps for their concern 
about the Ukrainian Army. I wish journalists and readers of 
MOLOD UKRAYINY lasting health and success in the building of 
Ukraine! I congratulate you on Victory Day!

  [Text] Addressing on May 9 a meeting devoted to the 50th 
anniversary of the city's liberation from the fascist invaders, 
Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov called Sebastopol the glory of 
the Crimea, Russia and the Black Sea Fleet. He told reporters 
that he orients to the interests of the republic and the Crimean 
people. 
  Meshkov said that at present the people of the Crimea are 
protecting their inalienable right to solve economic problems. 
  Commenting on the question that people of Sevastopol feel 
nostalgic over the former Soviet Union, Meshkov said that this 
is no nostalga, this is a normal attitude to the abnormal 
processes and the abnormal attitude to the people. He voiced 
hope that calm will be preserved in the Crimea and said that as 
the president he would do his best to achieve this. We pay 
minimum attention to political problems, we concentrate on our 
economic matters, he said. 
  Taking part in the festivities in Sebastopol were government 
delegations from Russia and Ukraine, representatives of the 
naval forces of Ukraine and the Black Sea Fleet. 
  The holiday was overshadowed by an incident. During the 
march representatives of the Ukrainian naval force carried 
yellow and blue Ukrainian flags. INTERFAX-UKRAINE reports that 
a small group of supporters of pro-Russian parties and movements 
welcomed sailors with whistles.

Mikhail Melnik] 
  [Text] Kiev, 8 May -- "I see Crimea's future relations with 
Ukraine as friendly," Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov said, 
answering a question from an ITAR-TASS correspondent following a 
working meeting on 7 May in Simferopol between government 
delegations of Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea. "They ought 
to be based solely on treaties." 
  At the same time Ukraine's acting Prime Minister Yukhym 
Zvyahilskyy said he regarded Crimea as an integral part of the 
Ukrainian state, and therefore believed that it was not 
necessary to conclude any special agreements. "We have nothing 
to divide; we are one family," he believes. 
  Journalists were told the two sides discussed a number of 
economic issues and reached understanding on some of them. This 
concerns, in particular, the provision of funds, oil products 
and seeds to the Crimea. A decision was also made to examine 
all arising issues at the level of heads of relevant ministries 
and departments.

  [Text] As has already been reported, Crimean President 
Yuriy Meshkov personally dismissed Oleksandr Plyuta from the 
post of interior minister of this autonomous republic. 
Ukrainian Interior Minister Andriy Vasylyshyn sent a letter to 
the executive head of that autonomous area about this matter. 
  The letter notes in particular that the Crimean president's 
decrees run counter to Ukraine's current legislation. The 
militia is a unified system of bodies, which are part of the 
structure of Ukraine's Interior Ministry and as such are 
subordinate to Ukraine's Interior Ministry. In Andriy 
Vasylyshyn's opinion, the Crimean president's decision regarding 
the interior minister should be reviewed. 
  This was reported by the Interior Ministry's main public 
relations center.

<F P=106> [Video report by correspondent Vladimir Plotnikov; from the </F>
"Novosti" newscast] 
  [Text] This evening talks were held in Simferopol between 
Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov and Yukhym Zvyahilskyy, acting 
prime minister of Ukraine. A noisy, rather unfriendly group of 
picketers met the Ukrainian delegation at the Supreme Council 
building, which is perhaps why the talks were held behind closed 
doors. However, at the news conference, journalists were 
assured that the range of questions were very much to do with 
day-to-day matters and that the conversation had been friendly. 
The sides discussed economic aid for Crimea, in particular for 
agriculture. 
  Journalists, alarmed by rumors that more Ukrainian troops 
were being sent to Crimea, that there was a threat of direct 
presidential rule over the peninsula, and that the presidential 
elections in Ukraine may be disrupted, asked how far all this 
was true. Yukhym Zvyahilskyy gave a short reply: It is all a 
provocation.

<F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] A demonstration and rally in honor of Crimean 
Constitution Day were held in Simferopol today. By a decree of 
Yuriy Meshkov, the president of the republic, this day has been 
declared a holiday. The Crimean constitution was adopted on 6 
May 1992 and, as the participants in the rally pointed out, it 
reflects most fully the aspirations of Crimeans. It envisions 
that Crimea's relations with Ukraine will be based on a treaty 
and agreements. It stipulates the right to dual citizenship and 
independence vis-a-vis other states. However, at the insistence 
of the Ukrainian leadership, these articles were removed. They 
do not appear in the present, official constitution. The 
Crimean Republic Movement and a number of other parties and 
public organizations have been campaigning for the restoration 
of the original wording. Participants in a poll of Crimean 
citizens recently called for a revision of the constitution. 
Evidently this is why President Yuriy Meshkov decided that 
constitution day should be celebrated on 6 May, rather than some 
other day. 
  Addressing the rally, Meshkov said that Crimea had signed a 
treaty with the administration of Moscow and that a treaty would

Constitution Day was also celebrated by patriotic forces in 
Sevastopol and by citizens of other towns.

  [Text] Simferopol -- President Yuriy Meshkov is planning 
to move to the first session of the newly elected Crimean 
Republic Supreme Soviet, due on 10 May, a package of five draft 
laws representing a concept for the peninsula's state and legal 
structure. This was announced yesterday by Oleg Rumyantsev, 
former Russian Federation people's deputy and secretary of the 
Constitutional Commission of the Russian Federation Congress of 
People's Deputies. At present, he is an expert on this problem 
in the Crimea presidential administration. The drafts that 
Yuriy Meshkov is to submit to the Crimean parliament bear on 
Crimean citizenship, its treaty-based relations with Russia and 
Ukraine, and also restructuring its executive power branch, 
according to Mr. Rumyantsev, toward creating "a strong 
presidential republic." The concept for Crimea's state and 
legal structure, commissioned by Mr. Meshkov, has been worked 
out by the Reform foundation under Academician Stanislav 
Shatalin.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Nikolayevich Klyuchnikov, chairman </F>
of the Executive Committee of the People's Party of the Crimea, 
by V. Korolkov; place and date not given: "From Opposition to 
Fruitful Work"] 
  [Text] [Korolkov] Vladimir Nikolayevich, during 
consultative meetings with deputies from the "Russia" bloc, you 
were considered to be a real candidate for the post of the 
Crimean Supreme Soviet chairman. By the way, your name was 
repeated both by independent deputies and deputies from working 
collectives and political parties. What is your opinion on this 
issue? 
  [Klyuchnikov] Along with my candidacy, some other candidates 
were also discussed. In my opinion, this issue will be 
regulated by the beginning of the first session. I do not fear 
the thought that a number of candidates for this post could be 
fielded. The key issue is that the majority of deputies from 
the "Russia" bloc, other parties and national groups understand 
that a Supreme Soviet chairman should organize the work of the 
legislature basing not on the differences and confrontation but 
on consolidation of all sane forces for the sake of normal 
legislative work which is required for the implementation of 
reforms and realization of the election promises by Crimean 
President Yu. Meshkov. 
  [Korolkov] You were one of the organizers of the Republican 
Movement of the Crimea [RDK] in August 1991. You put a lot of 
energy into the organization of this movement, headed the RDK 
Executive Council which has been the most popular opposition 
force in the Crimea recently. The RDK's ideas, along with the 
"Russia" bloc program, won. What are your next steps? 
  [Klyuchnikov] It is necessary to popularize the RDK's ideas 
otherwise the Crimean residents will stop supporting us. It 
will be difficult to do this because we were in opposition for 
more than three years while currently we have to change our 
methods and begin working constructively and creatively. It 
will not be easy for many former oppositionists, and -- God save 
them! -- I wish their process of transformation be painless. If 
they do not manage to change, I suspect that, in spite of 
performing normal legislative work, they will occupy positions 
of dissatisfied deputies or critics because this is easier and 
less responsible. I wish that the "Russia" bloc, its followers, 
and those who support our principles of legislative work, will 
form the basis for performing sane and constructive work in the 
newly elected Crimean Supreme Soviet. 
  [Korolkov] It means that the RDK's ideas are included in the 
"Russia" bloc program.... 
  [Klyuchnikov] The election platform and "Russia" bloc 
program 
are wider than the RDK's ideas notably, that over the last three 
years, specific political changes took place. Nevertheless, we 
will not reject the key ideas of the RDK and will look for 
chances to realize them within the "Russia" bloc program 
supported by the majority of the Crimean voters during the 
presidential and Supreme Soviet campaigns. 
  [Korolkov] What are the key political aims of the "Russia" 
bloc deputies' faction in the Crimean Supreme Soviet? 
  [Klyuchnikov] There is no "Russia" bloc deputies' faction 
yet 
but it is being formed and its aims are detailed by the election 
program. This is a further development and establishment of the 
Crimean statehood. For us, the future of the Crimea can be only 
with union with Russia and other CIS states. We will draft and 
adopt our own laws on citizenship, local administration, 
detailed separation of legislative, executive, and judicial 
powers, and deputy and state employees' status. The law on 
recall of deputies, which broadens the rights of the Crimean 
electorate, should be adopted by all means. The law on the 
Crimean constitutional court should become a guarantor of all 
Crimean laws and the Crimean constitution. 
  [Korolkov] However, you will not achieve any of your 
policies 
if economic issues are not resolved. What should the Crimean 
legislature do in this respect? 
  [Klyuchnikov] Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov's edicts laid 
the basis for resolving the Crimean issues. They should be 
reinforced by corresponding laws. It is very difficult to raise 
the standard of living through the acting budget and taxation 
system, for which Kiev rather than the Crimea should be blamed. 
In my opinion, the law on the Crimean Republican bank, which 
will be authorized to register subsidiaries of foreign banks, 
first of all, Russian ones, should become one of our first laws. 
To reconstruct resorts and other production sectors, we should 
seek to attract large investments to the Crimea on a legal 
footing and establish a system of legal benefits for investors. 
When adopting economic laws, we should first of all consider 
the interests of the Crimean producers. To do this, we should 
draft and adopt the law on protection of rights of Crimean 
producers. I admit that the work on drafting laws regarding 
privatization and implementation of reforms in the agrarian 
sector will be very difficult. Nevertheless, we hope to avoid 
mistakes which had been made in other CIS states, and, 
considering our experts's experience, we will draft laws 
appropriate to the specific economy of the Crimea and its 
population. 
  [Korolkov] What is your vision of the future foreign policy 
of the Crimea? 
  [Klyuchnikov] We will support Crimean President Yuriy 
Meshkov's signing of treaties with Russia and Ukraine. Our main 
goal is the resolving of the dire domestic problems -- 
primarily, economic ones -- of the Crimea at the expense of its 
foreign policy. In particular, this concerns the program 
regarding the return of the deported peoples. Crimean foreign 
policy should bolster the resolving of the issues regarding the 
Black Sea Fleet, stationing of military units, environmental 
protection, in a word, all the issues which the Crimea cannot 
resolve independently. We hope that Russia will assist us in 
our foreign policy. 
  [Korolkov] Your friends from the Union of Afghan War 
Veterans 
say that you begin your work at six in the morning and finish at 
10 in the evening. Is it really so? 
  [Klyuchnikov] I have such days, especially, of late. The 
work 
in the Crimean Cabinet of Ministers, the People's Party of the 
Crimea, which, along with the RDK, to set up the election bloc 
"Russia." [as published] But I have no right to forget the 
problems of Afghan war veterans. The state promised to resolve 
these problems but forgot about its promises. We have to earn 
the money to help our Afghan war veterans, the families of those 
who perished, and socially protect them. 
  [Korolkov] My last question is of a personal character: Have 
you time for your family? 
  [Klyuchnikov] Of course. I have two children, two growing up 
as Crimean residents, and I never forget about them. I wish 
they can grow and live in the happy land of the Crimea in peace 
and friendship with all peoples who live on our land of plenty 
and be happier than we are. I am an optimist even though I had 
to overcome many hardships but I believe in the future and fight 
for it.

  [Text] Kiev -- A regular sitting of the Interregional 
Deputies Faction -Center (MDF-Tsentr) [Mizhrehionalna Deputatska 
Fraktsiya-Tsentr] on 5 May discussed the results of faction 
members' participation in working groups preparing for the first 
session of Ukraine's Supreme Council. In particular they 
discussed adopting the rules and determining the agenda of the 
first sitting. It was recognized that faction members should 
support the adoption of temporary rules, which would combine 
everything progressive from the rules of the previous Supreme 
Council, but would give greater advantages to deputies factions 
and groups. 
  Leonid Kuchma, cochairman of the Interregional Reform Bloc, 
proposed that they take a stand on which candidate to support 
for the post of speaker by the next MDF-Tsentr session. During 
the discussion Oleksandr Moroz, Vasyl Durdynets, Ruslan Bodelan, 
chairman of Odessa oblast council, and Volodymyr Hrynyov were 
named. Expressing a personal point of view, Leonid Kuchma 
stressed that he will hardly be able to support Vasyl Durdynets, 
although he respects his executive skills. As the other 
cochairman of the Interregional Reform Bloc -- Volodymyr Hrynyov 
-- has not yet made a final decision on whether to contend for 
the speaker's seat, the decision to support one or other 
contender was postponed until the next sitting of the faction, 
planned for 10 May. 
  Leonid Kuchma told a UNIAN correspondent that he is 
convinced 
that at least several dozen deputies from among those who "have 
been forced to sign documents of other factions because of their 
official position or who have not yet adopted a final position," 
will join the MDF-Tsentr faction within a few days of the new 
parliament beginning work.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Leonid Danilovich Kuchma, </F>
cochairman of the Interregional Bloc of Reforms, by V. Katsman; 
place and date not given: "I Am Not Khrushchev: I Can 
Compromise..."] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Katsman] Leonid Danilovich, 
let me touch upon the inner political life of Ukraine. What are 
your prospects in the upcoming 26 June presidential and local 
elections? 
  [Kuchma] When I am told that we urgently require a new 
constitution, I remain a supporter of the opinion that this is 
not a key issue. Hundreds of states have lived without a 
constitution. If we had a new constitution, we would have 
violated its clauses just as we are violating virtually all of 
the laws in our state. I am a supporter of the belief that a 
new power -- able to make all people obey the law, including a 
constitution -- should appear. If the issue of shifting the 
date of elections was backed by specific measures of an economic 
nature, some anticrisis measures, or a kind of balanced program 
(in my opinion, currently, we require extraordinary measures), 
then we could discuss the issue of shifting the elections. When 
this demand is only explained by drafting a constitution, I do 
not accept this idea. According to statistics, only 27 percent 
of Ukrainian enterprises operated in March. This represents a 
complete breakdown -- extraordinary measures are required! 
Presidential elections should be held and Ukraine should 
receive a strong and stable executive branch! 
  [Katsman] Are the elections for local authorities necessary? 
  [Kuchma] I was, and still am, an adversary of holding the 
local elections. I am afraid that we will have 25 presidents of 
oblasts and the autonomous republic. I support a federal system 
in Ukraine, however, without political independence among the 
regions. We should empower regions with more economic rights 
but avoid turning them into islands of political tension. Local 
elections will strongly affect the vertical power structure. I 
am not sure that we would be able to adopt a decisive document 
if the oblast administration head is nominated for his post 
through the same popular elections as the state president (of 
course, there will be a difference in scale). Local elections 
could finally destroy the last few scraps of executive power 
that we still have. 
  [Katsman] Will the Interregional Bloc of Reforms (the 
Hrynyov-Kuchma bloc) step up its activity during the Supreme 
Council runoffs in 112 constituencies, where elections were not 
held on 27 March and 10 April? 
  [Kuchma] By all means! The bloc was organized not long ago 
(some five months ago), but we still somehow managed to make 
mistakes. For example, we virtually did not nominate any 
candidates in the Supreme Council elections. We only appealed 
for support for our joint statement with Vladimir Hrynyov. 
Therefore, this is probably the reason why our bloc's 
legislative faction won fewer seats than we had anticipated. 
The issue of toughening the rules of play arises: If you have 
agreed with some principles -- adhere to them and act 
accordingly when you are elected a Supreme Council deputy! 
This is almost a form of party discipline, but it will provide 
an opportunity to bloc forces of the extreme right and left in 
the legislature. We will seriously deal with the runoffs, but 
we are not still sure if they will be held in mid-summer. 
Vladimir Hrynyov and I set up an open bloc, so I expect the 
faction to be of a similar nature. As for me, I do not believe 
that we will not find sane people among the socialists and 
communists, as well as among national-democrats. We should 
begin working right away. I would like to convene plenary 
sessions no later than 5 May.... You know, our bloc is open for 
any and all cooperation. As for me, I am not Khrushchev, who 
had rows with all communist parties around the world which had 
stepped away from Marxist-Leninist dogma.... 
  [Katsman] You have entered the presidential campaign. What 
are your chances? 
  [Kuchma] I want to be fair with regard to those who have 
been 
nominated for this post along with myself. I assess my chances 
as equal to theirs. 
  [Katsman] Will Leonid Kravchuk participate in this marathon? 
  [Kuchma] Leonid Kravchuk is a shrewd politician. He is and 
will always remain the first president of independent Ukraine. 
I am sure that all the bad things will be forgotten. However, 
I believe that he will not participate in these elections. 
Nevertheless, we will see...

  [Text] In an interview with the news agency 
INTERFAX-UKRAINE, a Communist leader and member of the Ukrainian 
parliament Piotr Simonenko said the bloc of left-wing forces in 
the national legislature would oppose President Kravchuk's call 
for the postponement of the 26 June presidential elections. 
  According to Simonenko, the Ukrainian Communists would see 
any move to reschedule the elections as illegal and would 
insist, even in defiance of a direct presidential decree, that 
the elections be held on 26 June. 
  The bloc of left-wing forces brings together the Communists, 
Socialists and the Ukrainian Farmers' party. It has some 120, 
or more than one third, of the parliament's 338 distributed 
mandates and can block the endorsement of what it sees as 
ill-intended amendments to the national Constitution. 
  Simonenko said the Communists would support the candidacy of 
Socialist leader Aleksandr Moroz in the presidential elections. 
Most other presidential nominees, he said, had already had a 
chance to serve Ukraine but failed to perform well in positions 
of power. In principle, however, the Ukrainian Communists 
opposed the institute of the presidency. 
  According to Simonenko, the left-wing bloc would aim 
primarily to insure economic stabilization. It intended, first 
of all, to put in order the national taxation system by 
balancing the producers' and the country's interests. 
  In Simonenko's view, the producers must be given a chance to 
streamline production with the help of government-controlled 
levers. Activities in the financial and credit fields must be 
controled. Simonenko held high credit rates responsible for 
economic recession in Ukraine.

<F P=106> [Report by Vasyl Ganzha: "A Spike Should Ripen: Our </F>
Society Is Not Grown Up Enough To Have Its President"] 
  [Text] Much time has passed since the Republican Party of 
Ukraine [URP] issued its protest against the early presidential 
and local elections that endanger our statehood. The state 
lacks a legal basis for these political actions and they could 
only exacerbate the political situation in Ukraine which could 
also trigger irretrievable consequences. However, both power 
bodies and various political forces are pushing ahead with these 
elections to take advantage of the populist campaign at a time 
of mass impoverishment. Therefore, it is hardly possible that 
elections will be postponed until some later date. 
  Taking this situation into consideration, the URP convened 
its extraordinary congress on 23 April in Kiev. The key focus 
was on the issues of party tactics during the upcoming 
elections. Having analyzed the situation in the state and 
postelection realities, Mykhaylo Goryn harshly criticized the 
egoism of national democrats who cannot unite even at such a 
decisive moment for the Ukrainian nation. The URP chairman said 
that leaders of leftist political forces, who are especially 
dangerous because of their pro-imperial, pro-Russian 
orientation, wish to grab power. Former Prime Minister Kuchma 
-- whose wide powers in the industrial sector brought the 
Ukrainian economy to a ruinous state -- is not less dangerous 
than Symonenko or Moroz. All of a sudden, this person, who 
constantly sowed the seeds of disbelief in people's own strength 
and stated that we are nothing without Russia, decided to head 
the state which was always disregarded by him. 
  Levko Lukyanenko realistically assessed all possible 
candidates for president: Ivan Plyushch, Leonid Kravchuk, 
Leonid Kuchma, and Oleksandr Moroz. The Republicans have to 
elect the first two because only they are the Ukrainian 
statesmen. The honored head of the URP preferred the candidacy 
of Ivan Plyushch because our current president, in his opinion, 
lacks decisiveness in fighting for the interests of Ukraine. 
When it was necessary to use force and power, L. Kravchuk used 
continuous discussions and explanations. He is a talented 
propagandist but this is not enough for a president who heads 
the state at the beginning of its development. 
  The issue of nominating a URP candidate for president was 
also discussed. Mykola Porovskyy preferred this step because, 
in his opinion, a political force which does not participate in 
a presidential campaign, loses its prestige with the population. 
He proposed the candidacy of Mykhaylo Goryn, however, both the 
URP chairman and the majority of the URP delegates did not agree 
to this proposal. The recent elections demonstrated that our 
society is not grown up enough to elect national-democrats. As 
for the participation in the presidential elections to advocate 
party ideas and work out the party image, this action demands 
big money and their rivals have, to our regret, advantages in 
this sphere. Therefore, the URP will participate in the 
elections indirectly to fight against the leftist forces. 
  Congress discussed the political situation in the Crimean 
peninsula which, due to separatist actions by local leaders, 
threaten the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. 
Crimean developments prompted the adoption of the resolution on 
the establishment of the Group for Elimination of Consequences 
of the Crimean Crisis, which will raise spiritual and material 
resources to promote peaceful democratic and economic reforms 
and the building of the Ukrainian statehood in the region. 
Congress proposes that other political parties and public 
organizations elect their representatives for this mission and 
act in close cooperation. The resolution demands that L. 
Kravchuk use his legal power to urgently restore Ukrainian laws 
on the Crimean territory and even to introduce a direct 
presidential administration on the peninsula.

  [Text] Kiev -- UNIAN has already reported that the Central 
Electoral Commission on 5 May registered Larysa Skoryk, 
Nationwide Movement of Ukraine leader, as a contender for the 
Ukrainian presidential candidacy. Interviewed by a UNIAN 
correspondent on 6 May, she said that that report was outdated 
as she had submitted an application to the Central Electoral 
Commission for her candidacy to be withdrawn. "I was nominated 
when Leonid Kravchuk had not yet decided to take part in the 
presidential election. When that happened, I wrote a letter 
declining to run," she said. In Larysa Skoryk's words, she did 
not expect to win but wanted "to spoil a little bit the mood of 
such contenders as Leonid Kuchma." Larysa Skoryk said that in 
the event of the presidential election being held, the 
Nationwide Movement of Ukraine would back Leonid Kravchuk "who 
will undoubtedly gather 100,000 in his support." The 
organization led by her has taken part in the collection of 
these signatures. 
  UNIAN has been informed by the Central Electoral Commission 
that Larysa Skoryk's application for the withdrawal of her 
candidacy was dated 5 May. She received forms to collect 
signatures in her support on the same day.

  [Text] Kiev, 5 May -- RUKH-PRESS reports that the Kherson 
regional Rukh and "Ukraine" democratic associations have sent a 
statement to Ukraine's president demanding that an end be put to 
the political terror the document's authors say is being 
perpetrated in the oblast. The statement talks of threats 
addressed to Mykola Seredenyk, head of the Borislavskiy rayon 
Rukh and editor of the NARODNYY VISNYK BORYSLAVSHCHYNY. 
(Incidentally, the investigation into the murder of Ivan 
Seredenyk, his brother, which was committed a year ago, has not 
yet been completed.) 
  The statement's authors drew Leonid Kravchuk's attention to 
the fact that the terror, which gained momentum during the 
election campaign, has not stopped, even though the election 
campaign has finished. Svyatoslav Mohylivskyy, a former 
candidate for people's deputy, and Hryhoriy Tkachenko, a member 
of the regional Rukh leadership, were recently attacked. 
  The regional Rukh has warned the president, Oleksandr 
Melnykov, his representative in the oblast, and Vyacheslav 
Chornovil, head of Rukh: "If an end is not put to the political 
gangsterism, then we reserve the right to take resolute measures 
to defend our members and supporters."

<F P=106> [Article by Ukraine's People's Deputy Volodymyr Mefodiyovych </F>
Pylypchuk, member of the Ukrainian Supreme Council Presidium and 
chairman of the Commission for Issues of Economic Reform and 
National Economy Management: "Does the Donbass Experiment Have 
a Chance?"] 
  [Text] I must say that I would use the accountant's 
approach here. An accountant always estimates what is positive 
and what negative in a project and then comes up with a balance. 
I do not see anything positive about this experiment. Suppose 
a federalization had taken place and Ukraine's Donbass had been 
left to develop its own economy, either federal or 
state-controlled. Then the question would arise in Kiev, or in 
the state: Where to purchase coal? In Russia, where it is 
dozens of times cheaper, or in Donbass. You would, of course, 
say in Russia. 
  Let us imagine that Donbass had joined Russia, as the 
separatists want. Let us imagine for a moment that this had 
taken place, although this cannot happen without bloodshed. 
Have you imagined it? In Russia, coal is dozens of times 
cheaper than that extracted in Donbass, and the difference is 
even greater now -- even today, dozens of Russian coal mines are 
going bankrupt, because there are no markets. Tell me, whose 
coal would Russia buy? Donbass coal, which is dozens of times 
more expensive than Russia's? You cannot tell businessmen what 
to purchase -- they choose the coal and foodstuffs that are 
cheaper. Who can now say what would happen to Donbass in such a 
case? Today, Ukraine purchases Donetsk coal, because Donbass is 
our region, and we must support its existence, no matter what 
prices they set; we even allow them to be monopolists. If 
Donbass joins the Russian Federation economically or even 
administratively, Russia will not buy its coal, because it is 
too expensive. Ukraine will not purchase it, as it will prefer 
Russian or Polish coal. What will happen to the people? 
Between 5 and 7 million people will be left without means for 
subsistence. Is this an advantage? 
  Second. No single state gives away territories voluntarily; 
and Ukraine will not give away Donbass. There are examples. It 
is already the seventh year that the war has been going on in 
Karabakh. Have the warring sides made any breakthroughs? No. 
How many human lives have been lost?! The same here. If 
somebody in Donbass tries, on the quiet of the experiment, to 
separate and draw a new border between Ukraine and Russia, this 
border will be washed with blood, and much blood. 
  In this connection, I would like to appeal to normal people, 
residents of Donbass: Restrain those who are firing up your 
territory. It does not matter who does this; the same applies 
to the Crimea. Either pro-Russian or pro-Ukrainian forces, 
chauvinists, or nationalists -- one spark would suffice to set 
this territory on fire. You must come to your senses and stop 
those who are looking for trouble.

  Acting Prime Minister Yefim Zvyagilskiy said that the 
corresponding cabinet of ministers and National Bank decree has 
already been drafted and will come into force in a few days as 
one element in the preparations for the coming introduction of 
the hryvnya. The regulated rate of the national currency has 
been raised from 12,600 to 13,100 karbovantsy per U.S. dollar, 
but it will not be abolished -- that is one of the terms on 
which Ukraine is being given IMF credit. The average bank rate 
of the dollar is 45,000 karbovantsy today.

  [Text] Kiev [No dateline as received] -- In a conversation 
with a UNIAN correspondent on 6 May, Heorhiy Kopchynskyy, former 
first deputy chairman of the state committee for nuclear and 
radiation safety, who left his post several months ago, noted 
that the state of Ukraine's nuclear power now is reminiscent of 
the preperestroyka situation, when safety problems were kept in 
the background. The tendency to return to monopolism in the 
sector, secrecy, and the adoption of decisions without taking 
account of the opinions of specialists and the public has been 
observed over the course of the year. "The endeavors of the 
state committee for nuclear and radiation safety to counteract 
this," Heorhiy Kopchynskyy said, "have led to a situation where 
over time they stopped inviting us to consultations at the 
government level where the fate of nuclear power was being 
decided. Our attempts to introduce world approaches to safety 
problems evoked active counteraction on the part of the 
government. This was capped by the adoption of the decision on 
the further operation of Chernobyl nuclear power station, when 
the opponents of the decision -- the Health Ministry, the 
Environment Ministry, and the state committee for nuclear and 
radiation safety -- were not considered either in the government 
or in parliament." 
  "While supporting the existence of nuclear power," Heorhiy 
Kopchynskyy observed, "I consider the priority task to be its 
safety, which the state committee for nuclear and radiation 
safety should be observing. But when the committee becomes a 
burden for the government and decisions are taken behind its 
back, then I consider it impossible to remain there. I do not 
want to bear the responsibility for others' decisions that run 
counter to the very philosophy of safety."

  [Text] On Thursday 5 May, President Kravchuk signed an 
edict that liberalizes Ukraine's export procedures with the view 
of expanding exports of Ukrainian commodities and thus (promote) 
foreign currency income. The edict specifies in particular that 
a list of commodities are approved for which quota and licence 
issue regulations are nullified in 1994, as well as that 
licence-issue procedures are no more applicable to commodities 
not covered by the quota regulations. The cabinet is further 
instructed to draft, within a month's term, and submit to the 
Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, a law on necessary amendments to the 
cabinet edict that regulate exports of commodities and services 
and to adjust within a two-week term its own resolutions to this 
edict.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow 7 May TASS -- The upcoming Victory Day 
celebrations were one of the main topics of today's newspapers. 
  Despite the disintegration of the Soviet Union, people of 
Russia are waiting for this day to come, the newspaper 
ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI said. "Although our souls are often filled 
with worries and concerns about how to survive in this hard 
time, Victory Day returns us to the Russian roots," it said. 
  "There are no military parades anymore... But there is the 
eternal flame at the soldiers' tombs. There are war veterans. 
Many gray-hair defenders of the fatherland will get together 
for their holiday to reminisce about their war days and their 
youth," the newspaper said. 
  Its article "The Altar of Victory" reminds the readers that 
"only consensus may help the nation survive in critical 
conditions. It will always be like this in spite of differences 
in historic situations." 
  The newspaper RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA shares this opinion. It 
publishes an excerpt from the memoirs of Aleksandr Buchin, the 
chauffeur of legendary Marshal Georgiy Zhukov. 
  The military daily KRASNAYA ZVEZDA stressed the need to 
restore spiritual values in Russia. "As never before this task 
is urgent today when our society is in a spiritual crisis." For 
many young people, profit is the only goal in life. The once 
sacred notions of duty, honour and patriotism are no longer 
revered and respected. As a result, the future of the state may 
be put at stake, the newspaper said. 
  The trade union daily TRUD has started a new rubric, "How Is 
Life, Veteran?" The newspaper said that only 4,300,000 war 
veterans have survived. Many of them have been denied 
privileges that their colleagues enjoy. TRUD called on the 
heads of local administrations and local councils to adopt 
programmes of assistance for war veterans and do everything 
possible to make their life easier. 
  The newspaper NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA recalls that the countries 
of the anti-Hitler coalition, which included, apart from Russia, 
the United States, Britain and France, also celebrate May 9. 
"The war veterans of our allies also contributed to the 
victory," the newspaper said. It described Viktor Suvorov's 
book (former Soviet KGB agent who defected to the West) 
"Icebreaker" as a myth. 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA also ran a big article devoted to 
Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin's new book "The View From the Kremlin." 
The president is trying to "convince himself and others that he 
had done everything possible to prevent the October 1993 bloody 
drama and that his policy is the best and the only way out for 
Russia," the newspaper said. 
  The youth daily KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA publishes photographs 
of 
former residents of the village of Isakovo near Moscow who were 
killed in the war. Thankful villagers unveiled a war memorial 
on 9 May 1984 in their memory. "How many are there such obelisks 
in Russia -- thousands? Dozens of thousands? Ten years ago 
KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA shorthand typist Yekaterina Blagodareva 
told the story of just one because she would not have the heart 
to talk about others," the newspaper said. 
  PRAVDA carries a series of photographs of war photographer 
Aleksandr Ustinov. The events he caught on his pictures "belong 
to history -- celebrations in Moscow in May 1945, legendary 
Marshals Georgiy Zhukov and Konstantin Rokossovskiy and other 
unforgettable scenes and faces," it said.

  [Text] Moscow 7 May TASS -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin 
has called for worldwide celebrations of the 50th anniversary of 
the victory over the Nazi in the World War Two and declare 1995 
the year of memory of the WWII victims. 
  Yeltsin said the United Nations should urge all countries, 
their parliaments and governments to declare 8-9 May, 1995 days 
without shooting. 
  In his letter to the United Nations released by the 
presidential press service on Saturday, Yeltsin said that "the 
importance of the great victory won by joint efforts of the 
people of various countries cannot be tarnished even by time. 
One of its main lessons -- in order to defend peace, all 
peace-loving forces must act jointly, concertedly and actively." 
  "It is important, especially now, because there is still a 
possibility of armed confrontation between countries, blood 
continues to flow in civil, inter-ethnic and local conflict, the 
danger of the spread of weapons of mass destruction is growing," 
he said. 
  Russia believes that "it is in the interests of mankind to 
actively help step up the role and increase the effectiveness of 
the United Nations -- as a pivotal element of the system of 
collective security -- in pursuing the lofty goal proclaimed in 
its charter -- "to save the succeeding generations from the 
scourge of war."

  [Text] Moscow May 7 TASS -- Following is the full text of 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin's address to the United Nations 
organisation in connection with the 50th anniversary of the end 
of the World War II. 
  "On 8-9 May, 1995 the whole mankind will celebrate the 50th 
anniversary of the end of the World War II. The defeat of 
fascism meant a great victory of good forces over evil forces. 
But we paid a dear price for it. The war claimed over 50 
million human lives. Hundreds of thousands of towns and villages 
were razed to the ground. Hundreds of millions of people were 
left without a shelter and means to live on. 
  "There is not one family in Russia which would not be 
touched 
by the fire of that war. Our pain and sorrow will never abate, 
the grief of soldiers' widows will never be soothed. The 
tragedy of war and the happiness of victory will live in 
people's memory for ever. 
  "The importance of the great victory won by joint efforts of 
the people of various countries cannot be tarnished even by 
time. One of its main lessons -- in order to defend peace, all 
peace-loving forces must act jointly, concertedly and actively. 
It is important especially now because a possibility of armed 
confrontation between countries still exists, blood continues to 
flow in civil, inter-ethnic and local conflict and the danger of 
the spread of weapons of mass destruction is growing. 
  "Russia believes it is in the interests of mankind to 
actively help step up the role and increase the effectiveness of 
the United Nations -- as a pivotal element of the system of 
collective security -- in pursuing the lofty goal proclaimed in 
its charter -- `to save the succeeding generations from the 
scourge of war.' 
  "Our people who bore the main burden of the World War Two 
and 
sacrificed dozens of millions of their sons and daughters to the 
alter of victory have been consistently opposing the settlement 
of disputes by force. It is our conviction that there are no 
such goals which could justify the unleashing of a war. The 
preservation of peace is the supreme goal of our state. 
  "The Russian Federation calls on other countries -- members 
of the United Nations organisation, their parliaments and 
governments to do their best to stop the current armed conflicts 
and prevent new ones. 
  "In memory of millions of people who perished in the fire of 
the World War Two we propose to hold, under the aegis of the 
United Nations organisation, broad and solemn celebrations of 
the 50th anniversary of the victory over the Nazi and declare 
1995 the `year of memory of the victims of the World War Two.' 
We believe it expedient that the United Nations organisation 
address all nations of the world, their parliaments and 
governments with a call to declare 8-9 May, 1995 days without 
shooting. 
  "Let the 50th anniversary of great victory give a new 
powerful impetus to the preservation and safeguarding of peace. 
Mankind must finish the 20th century and enter a new one with 
confidence in the future."

  [Text] Russian Defense Minister General Pavel Grachev said 
that, by September 1, 1994 Russia would have withdrawn all its 
troops from other countries, both within and outside former 
Soviet territory, except for those states with which it has 
agreements to set up military bases on their territory. 
  Altogether 32,000 troops would return to Russia, Grachev 
told 
a news conference in Moscow on Friday. 
  The Black Sea Fleet, however, would stay in Crimea, and, 
unless proper social security was provided for retired Russian 
military officers living in Estonia, Russia would keep a 
military contingent there too, he said. 
  The general said additional allocations were needed to 
resettle officers and their families coming back to Russia. He 
said his ministry was spending more than half of its funds for 
those purposes. 
  Grachev said military reforms could not be successful 
without 
state support. Only at that level could the stable financing of 
the armed forces be ensured and could they be brought up to full 
strength, he said. 
  The minister slammed the Pacific Fleet for its training 
standards, which, he qualified as the lowest in the country's 
armed forces. He said there would be replacements in the fleet 
command. 
  Grachev said Russia would keep all its five arms of defense 
(the strategic missile forces, the land forces, the air force, 
the air defense forces and the navy) till the year 2000. He 
said the Defense Ministry would be paying priority attention to 
the strategic missile forces, "which are the guarantor of 
national security both today and in future."

  [Text] Eduard Shevardnadze, chairman of the Georgian 
Parliament and head of state, has met a delegation from the 
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development [EBRD]. The 
delegation was introduced to Eduard Shevardnadze by Tengiz 
Geleishvili, who has been involved for the past five months in 
developing a program suggested by the EBRD. The visitors 
expressed surprise that the Georgian Parliament did not confirm 
Tengiz Geleishvili's nomination to the post of chairman of the 
Committee of Foreign Economic Relations. 
  Part of the 2 billion ECU [European Currency Unit] allotted 
by the EBRD to the republics of the former Soviet Union will be 
used in Georgia to develop private business, revive the economy 
and industry, improve international telecommunications and reach 
financial stabilization. 
  Work on a large project is approaching its end. Taking into 
consideration the current critical situation in Georgia, a team 
working on this project has made a decision to start work on the 
Enguri hydropower station, the Rioni hydropower station, and 
other substations. Some $40 million have been allotted for this 
purpose. 
  Apart from such priorities, the program stipulates 
restoration and reconstruction of Georgian sea ports, financial 
stabilization of Georgian banks, creation of an infrastructure 
required for starting the republic's industry, and improvement 
of the network of international telecommunications. This will 
encourage business and financing of small- and medium-sized 
enterprises. 
  At the end of the meeting, Eduard Shevardnadze said: We 
believe that our relations are quite serious and large-scale. I 
have to admit that we are in a great hurry and therefore, I 
think we have to work out a joint program, which will determine 
the exact time and work details. The program will reflect 
present and future work and if events develop as we hope, normal 
working conditions will be established very soon, I am sure.

<F P=106> [Speech by Russian President Boris Yeltsin at a Victory Day </F>
rally in Moscow --live] 
  [Text] Dear veterans, fighters of the Russian Army, 
esteemed compatriots, dear Muscovites: Today we are all marking 
once again the great Russian festival of the Victory. The 
bloodiest, the most destructive war in the history of mankind 
ended 49 years ago. It ended with a thunderous Russian shout of 
Hurrah which rolled over defeated fascist Germany, over the 
liberated countries of Europe, over the whole world. 
  Probably, 9 May 1945 was the happiest day in the whole of 
the 
20th century. That happiness was brought to mankind in the 
first place by the valiant fighters of the Red Army, which 
included Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians, Kazakhs, Uzbeks, 
Georgians, and people of other nationalities who were at one in 
defending their homeland. 
  The whole of mankind bowed its head low as a sign of 
immeasurable gratitude to the Soviet, the Russian soldier, 
because without him the fate of the world could have turned out 
differently. 
  It was Russia which stopped and turned the brown plague to 
dust. And it was Russia, as often in the past, which saved the 
world in the 20th century. 
  We won victory at a very great cost. There is not a family 
which did not suffer a bitter loss, and since then it has become 
the custom to bow our heads to the memory of those who died in 
bloody battles, in bombardments, exchanges of fire, and in 
concentration camps. We remember those on the home front who 
worked till they dropped. 
  May you be for ever remembered, and with boundless 
gratitude! 
  Dear Muscovites and guests of our city, as we return to 
those 
years of the Great Fatherland War, we try to find answers to 
today's questions. What was it that helped us endure? What 
helped us to defeat that mighty army which was sustained by the 
resources of the whole of Europe? I think the most important 
thing was a firm belief in victory. Even in 1941, when the foe 
was occupying town after town, when Leningrad was blockaded, 
when the Baltic states, Belarus, and the greater part of Ukraine 
fell, when the foe was approaching Moscow -- we believed and 
knew that victory would nevertheless be ours. It was this that 
enabled everyone to do the seemingly impossible. 
  Veterans recall how difficult life was at that harsh time. 
But it was at that very time that people found strength of 
spirit. A great truth was revealed to us -- man's best 
qualities have lost none of their value. Without honesty, 
decency, charity, and self- sacrifice, we would not have been 
victorious, would not have endured. These qualities are in our 
blood, in our character. No tests of endurance can destroy them. 
  I cannot fail to mention the unity, the breath as one which 
helped us overcome all difficulties and deprivations. Today we 
know how hard it was to achieve that unity. The roller coaster 
of prewar repressions corrupted the life of millions of people, 
leaving bitterness and resentment in their hearts. But in the 
face of the chief danger, all this faded into the background. 
  Quite a few emigres -- former enemies of Soviet power -- 
sided with its defenders in order to save the homeland. 
  Today we also commemorate the anti-Hitler coalition formed 
by 
hitherto hostile states. Faced by deadly danger, they abandoned 
mutual hatred and took joint action against the common enemy. 
The second front, though opened late, did bring closer the end 
of the hateful war. It was then that the strategic partnership, 
which we are now striving to strengthen, came into being. 
  We have differences with the West, but there is also a 
unique 
opportunity to put an end to distrust between each other 
forever. The only important thing to remember always is that 
Russia must be treated with respect. Our people will never 
accept any other language from any state whatsoever. This is 
because they will always remember how much blood was shed for 
the sake of peace, and because this is the sacred precept of 
those who died for our motherland's honor and independence. 
  One of the most important lessons of the great victory is 
that the strength of unity, the strength of accord is 
invincible. This is significant for us, particularly today. We 
all want our country to become free and flourishing, and the 
people's life dignified and prosperous. Surely we can unite 
around this main aim? 
  Today I call upon all those who hold dear the name of the 
citizen of the Russian Federation [Rossiyanin], those who hold 
dear the glory of the fatherland: let us unite in peace! We 
managed to be united in the great war: I believe we can be 
united in building civic peace. 
  The first steps on this road have been taken. Many parties, 
movements, unions, and associations joined the Treaty on Social 
Accord. Let those who are always displeased grumble and let 
instigators shout away. We will continue, because the difficult 
path to peace is always better than political squabbling and 
war. Let the tears and the grief of mothers in Armenia and 
Azerbaijan, in Georgia and Tajikistan, and the bloodshed in 
Yugoslavia be a stern warning to those who value political 
revenge more than human lives. 
  By signing the Treaty on Social Accord, we did not and are 
not seeking victory. We seek overall peace. We do not regard 
as our enemy those who refused to join the Treaty. There are no 
quick solutions or simple formulas in the building of a new 
Russia. We are prepared to hold a dialogue and on-going 
consultations with parties and factions, which is the meaning of 
the Treaty on Social Accord. 
  Esteemed veterans, I know that the beginning of the war has 
a 
particular place in your memory. We retreated then. We did not 
dare look into the eyes of women and old people then. We had to 
learn to conquer in action. We mastered this difficult skill, 
though not immediately. The people gave its Army the best 
weapons in the world, the best equipment in the world, the best 
soldiers, and the best military commanders. In the name of the 
triumph of justice and as a mark of nation-wide respect and 
nation-wide gratitude, a monument to Georgiy Konstantinovich 
Zhukov, the great Russian commander and true son of Russia, will 
be unveiled in Moscow in exactly a year from now, on 9 May 1995. 
  A decision was taken today to found a Zhukov order and 
medal. 
Honor and glory to the great Russian military leader! 
  The year 1941 was especially difficult and bitter for us. 
But 1945 was a year of victory. It is important for Russia 
today to remember this during the current transformations. We 
began these transformations without the necessary experience, 
and at first we were compelled to draw on the practice of other 
countries. But now, more than two years on, we have been able 
to accumulate our own priceless Russian experience. No other 
state has it. You will read about it in any book. Now we will 
go further, clearly understanding what needs to be done in 
Russia in order to revive its greatness and dignity, and how. 
  Recent years have been especially difficult for all of us. 
Everything could very easily have been wrecked, but we held out. 
This is due in no small measure to you, dear veterans, to your 
wisdom, courage, and steadfastness, to the fact that you know 
the true price of peace and reject hysteria, panic, and cheap 
demagogy. I have no doubt that veterans will continue 
persistently to defend stability and civil peace in Russia. 
  Dear friends! Today the splendid central museum of the Great 
Patriotic War, built by Muscovites, opens here on Poklonnaya 
Gora. Many defenders of the fatherland did not live to see this 
day. Many of them could not come here because of old age and 
illness. May the memorial complex being built on Poklonnaya 
Gora be the general homage of Russia and our people to the 
heroes and simple soldiers of the war, to their feat of arms! 
  Yesterday the victory memorial was blessed by the Russian 
Orthodox Church. 
  Henceforth, this place will become one of the shrines of 
Russian history. We failed to keep safe the Church of Christ 
the Savior, or the church built to commemorate the faith and 
soldierly glory displayed in 1812. But I believe that the fate 
of the Victory Memorial will be different, will be better. I 
appeal to you, dear veterans, and to your children and 
grandchildren, our descendants: let us jointly preserve the 
Victory Memorial, let us jointly preserve our shrines! 
  In exactly one year's time, we will mark the 50th 
anniversary 
of the great victory. Preparations for this great event start 
from today. The coming year will be a year of commemoration, of 
making sense of our peacetime and wartime history. This history 
includes difficult and bitter pages. We will have to restore 
those pages which were mercilessly torn out and record those 
which have not yet been fully recorded. It is our duty to put 
in order all monuments, all graves of the homeland's defenders. 
It is our duty to restore the shining names of those who are 
still listed as missing without trace. 
  But the most important thing is that all of us, all Russian 
citizens, should change a little and become more tolerant, 
charitable, and wise; it will then be easier to deal with 
everything which poisons our lives today. As true sons of the 
fatherland, we will be proud of the heroic deeds of our 
forbears, draw conclusions from their mistakes, and will 
remember that one of the most important lessons of our history 
is the lesson of unity. When we are in agreement, we are 
strong. When we are together, we are invincible. 
  Glory to the veterans of the Great Fatherland War! Glory to 
the Russian Army! Glory to Russia! Glory to Moscow! Hurrah!

  [Text] The time is 1033; sorry for the delay. We have just 
received a recorded report by our correspondent Venediktov at 
the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier by the Kremlin Wall in the 
Aleksandrovskiy Gardens. President Boris Yeltsin of Russia is 
answering questions from journalists. 
  [Begin recording] [Yeltsin] In 1945, Russia, as a country, 
the former Soviet Union, did indeed save Europe and the world 
from the plague of brownshirts, and it is hard to imagine what 
would have happened had it not done so. The whole world should 
therefore bow its head first of all before our Russian soldiers, 
officers, commanders, that is, before those who took part in the 
Great Patriotic War, should honor the memory of those who 
perished and express gratitude to those who are alive. 
  But now is a new stage, a stage of partnership between our 
previously conflicting countries, especially Russia and the 
United States of America. Now partnership is of course 
introducing an entirely different stage. Now there is no 
confrontation as such. But nor must we lose our vigilance. 
Therefore, while we are gradually lowering the threshold of 
armaments and armed forces, nevertheless we will constantly keep 
it in parity with the United States, with NATO, and so on. At 
the same time, of course, we will cooperate more, perhaps 
carrying out joint exercises, although they have not been 
carried out before, to make our partnership really that of 
comrades at arms [druzhestvenno-boyevoy]. 
  I think that there are more guarantees of peace now than 
ever 
before, all the more so since this anniversary -- the 49th -- is 
being marked precisely at a time when the political situation in 
Russia is becoming stabilized, when there are grounds for calm, 
when there are grounds for different parties and factions 
sitting down at the negotiation table together to discuss 
questions and to hold a dialogue. It is the year when, as you 
know, the Social Accord Treaty was signed. I think it will give 
Russia a great deal, and not just Russia but the whole world, 
too. 
  I am sure that Russia will still help the West. That will 
come. 
  [Unidentified voice: "If God is willing"] 
  [Yeltsin] If God is willing, yes indeed, since the hopes -- 
and belief and hope are the most important things -- cherished 
by every soldier during the war -- the belief, the belief namely 
in victory, was the decisive factor which brought about 9 May 
1945. 
  I think that Muscovites were very glad, specially those who 
participated in the Great Patriotic War, that the glorious 
museum on Poklonnaya Gora, which we will visit today, was 
finished in time. It is, of course, a unique building. It is 
truly a tribute to the memory of all those who took part, to all 
those who did not live to see this day. 
  [Unidentified voice] Thank you to the press. We'll meet on 
Poklonnaya Gora [words indistinct]. Thank you Boris 
Nikolayevich. [end recording]

  [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS, 5/5/1994 -- Today, President 
Mircea Snegur had a meeting with the President of the Belarusian 
Supreme Soviet Mechislav Grib and Premier Vyacheslav Kebich, who 
currently conduct an official visit to Moldova, states a 
Presidential Press Service communique. Both sides stressed at 
the meeting the importance of deepening and extending the 
bilateral relations on multiple levels between the two 
countries. Snegur mentioned that "relations between Moldova and 
Belarus can serve as a model of prosperous cooperation within 
the CIS economic zone." Referring to the political aspect of 
cooperation, Snegur underlined the necessity of mutual support 
in preventing military conflicts of various sorts. "After the 
27 February elections and the opinion poll `La sfat cu poporul' 
[What People Advise] favourable conditions were created for the 
resolution of the problems in the eastern and Gagauz regions," 
mentioned Mircea Snegur. The president also noted that if 
reasonable compromises will be accepted, the situation could be 
improved in the nearest future. In their turn, the guests 
referred mainly to the presidential elections campaign in 
Belarus. They also thanked the Moldovan people for their 
support of Belarusians who suffered from the Chernobyl disaster, 
says the Presidential Press Service communique.

  [Excerpts] [No dateline as received] Recently President 
Nursultan Nazarbayev has adopted two important decrees which 
will play an important role in facilitating the land reform: "On 
Certain Issues Related to Regulation of Land Relations" and "On 
Further Facilitation of Land Relations." A KAZTAG correspondent 
interviewed Bakhyt Ospanov, chairman of the state republican 
committee for land and land tenure. [passage omitted] 
  The Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic has approved the 
average assessed value on the right to use or lease land. In 
Almaty, for example, one square meter is estimated at 50 tenge, 
in Karaganda -- 13.4, in settlements -- 1.3, in farms -- 0.7 
tenge per square meter. In Almaty Oblast the estimated value of 
one square meter of land comprises half of its cost in the 
capital. The territorial branches (regional and city 
committees) of the state committee for land and land tenure are 
allowed to increase or lower (maximum by a factor of two) the 
estimated value on the right to use or lease land depending on 
the infrastructure. The committee is also invested with the 
power of specifying and (?changing) if need be the estimated 
value depending on the data on a quarterly index of prices, 
provided by the state committee for state statistics. 
  The president's first decree establishes that citizens which 
fall under clause 16 of the law "On Citizenship in the Republic 
of Kazakhstan" have the right to obtain an allotment for 
lifelong inherited possession irrespective of the duration of 
their residence on the territory of Kazakhstan. 
  [Correspondent] Are you talking here about those 
Kazakhstanis 
who have special merits before the Republic and those people who 
have been forced to leave the Republic for political reasons as 
well as their descendants, who decided to come back to their 
historic motherland for permanent residence? 
  [Ospanov] Yes, the president considered it necessary to lift 
the earlier temporary ban and give the right to those citizens 
of Kazakhstan who have spent not less than five years in the 
republic to acquire an allotment for lifelong inherited 
possession. There are 3.2 million landowners with the right to 
a lifelong inherited possession in the Republic, including 
16,000 farms. [passage omitted].

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Vitaliy Naumenko on interview with </F>
Ukraine President Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk by various 
unidentified correspondents in Kiev on 6 May; Kravchuk remarks 
recorded] 
  [Excerpts] The president of Ukraine was asked many 
questions, touching on various aspects of the political, 
cultural, and social situation in Ukraine, our state's mutual 
relations with Russia, the world and European communities, the 
processes of nuclear disarmament in Ukraine, and so on. Next 
week, Leonid Makarovych was asked, Ukraine's new parliament will 
begin work, and you are intending to make an initiative to 
postpone the June preterm presidential elections. Has this 
initiative already been fully prepared, or will it require some 
explanations of your standpoint? This is the Ukrainian 
president's reply: 
  [Kravchuk] Not only how we will elect a president, but also 
what people, and with what powers, and what power we will form. 
This is a fundamental position. They say we have the law on the 
president [words indistinct], and that the president's status is 
determined. I am not saying that [word indistinct]. But in 
this case, all structures, all the way down to village council, 
should be compatible with each other. 
  For example, if there is the president in Kiev with his 
present powers, that is, he is the head of the state and the 
executive power, while oblasts will have parliamentary 
structures -- which is actually the case, because according to 
the adopted law on formation of the power, it is purely a 
parliamentary structure -- then we have the president in Kiev, 
but without leverage and structures in the provinces. 
Therefore, one should change either the adopted laws or the law 
on the president. That is, the draft constitution says that the 
president is the head of state with certain powers, so we should 
coordinate these two laws: the law on the president and the law 
on forming self-governing and [word indistinct] power structures. 
  There are no ambitions here. One just has to do it. If one 
doesn't, then the executive structures will be ruined after the 
elections. No vertical chain of command is envisioned. The 
adopted law does not so much as mention the president, if you 
read it carefully. At some point, it only says that state 
functions will be delegated to local government institutions, 
and that in this respect they will be answerable to the Cabinet 
of Ministers, but not to the president. 
  In other words, when this law was examined by the Supreme 
Council, there was a revolutionary hatred for the president, and 
one could already feel that the president is not necessary as 
such and that his powers should be reduced, if any remain, to 
those of a representative figure. At present, however, things 
are different. So, this is why I say: let us bring everything 
down to a logical structure, changing either this or that. Then 
one could go to the elections. 
  As for my position, why exactly I decided to run in the 
presidential elections. First, it is everyone's right to make 
such a decision, and it is not prohibited either by the 
constitution or by the law. Second, I began to be accused of 
supposedly opposing elections because I was said to be afraid of 
elections, and this idea has now gone spread through the 
country. Thus, in the present case I am going to speak in favor 
of canceling the elections (?at the level of) [words 
indistinct], who has decided to run as candidate for president. 
  These are the main points, but there are also other ones. I 
just want us to make a responsible decision based on democratic 
principles. Why am I turning to the Supreme Council? But who 
else if not the newly elected Supreme Council can today resolve 
those issues? Can the new Supreme Council avoid reforming the 
power, the political reform in Ukraine? It cannot. This is its 
obligation, responsibility, and right. It is normal when the 
newly elected parliament initiates a relevant action based [word 
indistinct] on the law, order, and constitution. 
  [Naumenko] The president of Ukraine was asked to explain 
the situation connected to the forthcoming visit to Kiev by 
Russian President Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin -- this was agreed 
by Leonid Kravchuk and Boris Yeltsin in Moscow during the last 
meeting of CIS heads of state and heads of government -- and 
also the statement by Crimea's President Meshkov that the Black 
Sea Fleet supposedly comes under the exclusive authority of 
Russia and Crimea's government. 
  [Kravchuk] I consider that our relations with Russia, with 
Russia's president, and with the Russia Government, are 
constructive. As to the fact that there was a (?corresponding) 
statement, it was interpreted slightly incorrectly. Boris 
Nikolayevich did not refuse to visit; he said only that he will 
pay the visit when the acute problems have been resolved. 
  Then there is the problem of the Black Sea Fleet. I think 
(?he did the right thing). When there is much that has not been 
resolved, it is somewhat illogical to sign, for example, a 
treaty on friendship, partnership, and cooperation when there 
are acute problems. Well, I support the Russian president's 
view that a treaty can be signed only when all the issues have 
been resolved. 
  Anything said by other persons, including Crimea's 
president, 
is merely a personal position, his personal viewpoint. This 
personal viewpoint cannot be the fundamental one in relations 
between Russia and Ukraine today. I have always stressed, and I 
stress now, that I would very much like (?Crimea), its 
president, and the [word indistinct] officials to understand 
that relations between two states, two peoples, [words 
indistinct]. Whoever wants this relationship to be one of [word 
indistinct] and partnership should make efforts to bring this 
about, and anyone doing this will be a source of pride and a 
person of great significance for his people, but not [word 
indistinct] if he makes matters more acute and creates 
confrontations. 
  [Naumenko] Do you consider, Leonid Kravchuk was asked, that 
the previous years of your presidency were years of constructive 
cooperation with the previous Ukrainian parliament, or was it 
time wasted in fruitless arguments and in the inefficient 
opposition of legislative and executive structures. Here is the 
head of state's reply: 
  [Kravchuk] I have said already and have no other point of 
view on this, that if we had managed from the very beginning, 
from the very first steps, to reach accord -- it cannot be a 
consensus, this is ruled out -- but accord and constructive work 
in parliament, constructive work between the parliament and the 
government, between the president and parliament, I am convinced 
that we would have done far more, far more, in the area of 
legislation, in the area of executive discipline, in the area of 
reforms, market reforms, and in setting up democratic power 
institutions. We would have done much more. But this did not 
happen. 
  All the time and in most cases [word indistinct], our 
relations were (?based) on mutual accusations. The executive 
structures blamed the legislative structures, sometimes simply 
undeservedly, and the legislative structures blamed the 
executive structures. This then became a kind of norm. Meetings 
began, sittings began, but everything proceeded in an atmosphere 
of mutual accusations. This did not bring any benefit. 
  I hope, I want to believe, that this parliament (?will take) 
its first steps toward constructive work. There can be no unity 
there, because there are different people with various views. 
But what is fundamental is to attempt and see the necessity for 
constructive [word indistinct] with the government, the 
president, and with all other power structures. This is the 
main thing needed to achieve progress in solving economic and to 
social problems, and foreign economic problems [words 
indistinct]. 
  [Naumenko] As is well known, the left-wing forces won a 
considerable number of deputies' seats at the elections. What 
is Leonid Kravchuk's attitude to the communist idea in general, 
the president was asked, has it changed at all? 
  [Kravchuk] The Communist Party, the communists, and the 
communist idea are different things. I have never been a 
resolute opponent of, let us say, the right, (?if one may put 
this question), the right of the individual to believe in one or 
another idea, be it in communism or capitalism. This is 
everyone's right. 
  There is the organization of the Communist Party itself. 
This is now a structure. There are (?all sorts of) structures, 
which arm themselves with an idea and want to put it into 
practice. No one can prevent anyone doing this in a 
constitutional way and within the laws of the state. As you 
have probably observed, when I (?left the party) in (?1991), I 
never [words indistinct], did not say that the communist 
ideology is an (?enemy ideology), that the Communist Party is a 
criminal organization. I have not said this. [passage indistinct] 
  As far as individuals are concerned, some individuals of the 
current Communist Party are (?a worry), because they are of the 
red mayor type, that is they want revenge at any cost. If (?for 
example), you did not defend the Communist Party, then you are a 
traitor. If you left the Communist Party, you are a traitor. 
[Words indistinct] because the party envisages the right to join 
the party and to leave the party, and no one has the right to 
apply pressure. If this is democratic [words indistinct]. 
  This is my attitude. I have an appropriate attitude to 
individuals, and I consider this a [word indistinct] standpoint. 
If one is to take this position, then the prospects [words 
indistinct]. (?He knows) that if he wants to leave he will be 
insulted, revenge will be taken, pressure will be applied, he 
will be called a traitor and then even persecuted [words 
indistinct]. Who will join such a party? 
  We simply cannot generalize about this, but should look at 
specific things. This is my position. I cannot speak against 
any organization which acts within the framework and the 
boundaries of the constitution and the law. If an organization 
does not obey the constitution and the law, there is the 
procurator's office to deal with it, there is the Justice 
Ministry, and there are other legislative, legal, and law 
enforcement bodies to handle matters within the framework of the 
law and the constitution. [passage omitted] 
  [Naumenko] On the eve of possible presidential elections, 
the relationship between Leonid Kravchuk and [former Parliament 
Speaker] Ivan Plyushch is a matter of great interest among 
people. What can the head of state say about this? This was 
the next question to Leonid Kravchuk. The Ukraine president was 
also asked to comment on the fact that for some reason our 
Ukrainian listeners, the Ukrainian audience and population 
receive most new information on Ukraine's nuclear disarmament 
from the newspaper IZVESTIYA. 
  [Kravchuk] Ivan Stepanovych [Plyushch] has said that he will 
declare his candidacy and I told him that everyone has the right 
to run president. Ivan Stepanovych and I were together for four 
years in all. We sat at the table together for one and a half 
years, I as chairman and he as first deputy. In the last few 
years he was chairman [words indistinct], and naturally there 
were contacts between the chairman and the president. I know 
that Ivan Stepanovych has his standpoints, his point of view. 
This is normal. In my speeches I have never made any kind of 
personal observations regarding the Supreme Council chairman, 
regarding Ivan Stepanovych -- not once; nowhere; never -- 
because I believe that debates should be direct. [Word 
indistinct] debates do not bring any benefit. If there is no 
(?reply) when people sit opposite each other and have the 
possibility [words indistinct] to exchange points of view, this 
is normal. One has his point of view, the other has another 
point of view. [passage indistinct] 
  I would say that the [trilateral nuclear] agreement is being 
implemented, that none of the three sides has any [words 
indistinct] to cast doubt on the agreement, which (?has been 
signed). Let us say that Ukraine is fulfilling its obligations, 
Russia is fulfilling its obligations, and the United States its 
fulfilling its obligations. Whether their dates coincide, 
whether their volumes coincide, sums of money, warheads, fuel 
elements, dates, and times is another matter. There are 
corresponding problems here. There are both objective and 
subjective problems. But they (?are being resolved). 
  As far as deactivation is concerned, we are acting in 
accordance with the agreement. The agreement does not envisage 
complete deactivation; [words indistinct] gradual 
(?deactivation) is envisaged for the present. But we are 
fulfilling those obligations we have assumed, and will continue 
to fulfill them in the interests of (?this) trilateral 
agreement. This deactivation does not mean the withdrawal of 
warheads, you understand; it means their stockpiling 
[skladuvannya], if one can use this word, at S facilities. We 
are interested in these warheads being stockpiled. We are also 
interested, because, not having a direct and full control over 
silos, over nuclear warheads -- I do not have full control, I do 
not have technical control, because this technical control is 
located directly in Moscow -- I am interested in their not being 
on alert status [na boyevomu cherhuvanni] because this is more 
peaceful both for Ukraine and for the United States, especially 
as they are all aimed [word indistinct] at the United States of 
America. That is, I am in favor of deactivating them, 
deactivating them. 
  As for what the state of play is today, on today's date, 
[words indistinct], I do not know exactly whether [word 
indistinct] 46, 36, or 26. The point is not [word indistinct]. 
The point is that we are fulfilling our (?contractual) 
obligations. 
  [Naumenko] One of the questions to the Ukrainian president 
contained a request to comment in detail on a package of US 
assistance to Ukraine, dealt with during the Ukrainian head of 
state's March visit to Washington. Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk 
explained in this connection, as follows: 
  [Kravchuk] It can be said that this has been discussed -- 
our 
problems and mechanisms for implementing the documents we signed 
in Washington, as well as Bill Clinton's letter -- during 
yesterday's meeting with the delegation headed by Burns. The 
point of the letter is that we should begin to act in three 
primary directions. The first direction is to use the $350 
million designated for economic assistance -- not the $350 
million for the dismantlement of nuclear weapons -- the $350 
million for economic assistance. This is the first direction. 
The second one is the development of investment programs -- 
where could these funds be used directly. The third direction is 
the development of trade between Ukraine and the United States. 
  Bill Clinton believes that this delegation should work in 
Ukraine in these three directions. During the meeting, we 
conceptually worked out our proposals, and, before the meeting 
with me, the delegation had had appropriate negotiations and 
consultations with governmental structures, including the 
Foreign Ministry. Thus, the point is how to use the $350 
million, beginning immediately, without further delay. 
  There was another proposal. You will recall, when the U.S. 
President was here, he said that the United States would grant 
this loan to support small business. Now, this figure has been 
put at $150 million. Then, the talk was about $50 million, now 
the amount has increased to $150 million. However, I want you, 
all of us and all those who are listening to us, to understand 
one thing. There is state assistance, state loans granted by 
other countries to Ukraine. These loans are granted under 
guarantees. They must be returned, and of course, the interest 
must be paid. The level, or the specific gravity of these forms 
of assistance is dozens, or even hundreds times lower than 
private companies' investments. 
  For instance, Hungary recently received assistance from 
other 
states amounting to five [words indistinct] well about (?$150 
million), while private investments have up to date come to $3.5 
billion. 
  Every year, the United States invests more than $50 billion 
abroad. However, who does it? General Motors, General 
Electric, Johnson and Johnson, Pepsi Cola, and others do it, 
meaning companies which have colossal capabilities. These 
investments are of a different nature. They come to a country, 
set up enterprises and joint ventures, with the state in such 
cases not undertaking any immediate guarantees. That is up to a 
joint venture. It is either viable and competitive, trading, 
selling and earning money, or its competitors and [word 
indistinct] (?displace it). 
  I want you to understand that this is not the most important 
thing. The most important thing is to create in Ukraine 
conditions for investments of private capital. 
  [Naumenko] (?On the subject of) plummeting production and 
inflation processes which, it is true, have lately been 
successfully placed under strict state control, the Ukrainian 
president was asked about his vision of economic development in 
Ukraine (?in the very near future). 
  [Kravchuk] [passage indistinct] Comparing statistics, it is 
even greater, rather than less severe, in other CIS countries. 
However, I would like to say one thing which is very important. 
For instance, Ukraine was the first CIS state to have suffered 
a blow of the energy crisis, (?which called into question our 
very independence). You may remember how quickly prices, 
inflation etc. rose. Today, we (?have reached), let us say, 
[word indistinct]. It is simply impossible for energy and other 
prices to rise any higher because nobody will any longer buy the 
goods that are manufactured. If it is twice (?the price) [words 
indistinct], it is simply impossible. 
  We have withstood that (?pressure). (?It is over now). We 
have withstood it. Now at rock bottom, as they say, we can and 
have begun gradually to advance. What does advancing mean? 
This means, and you can see for yourselves, that inflation has 
now fallen. Production in some areas is still falling, but there 
are increases too. New sectors are appearing. 
  Last year, for example, 22 percent of industrial output was 
produced by lease enterprises. We now have up to 4,000 large 
enterprises that are subject to corporatization, i.e. setting up 
(?public limited [vidkrytyy]) companies. As many as 2,000 or so 
medium- and large-size enterprises have been privatized. In 
other words, there has appeared (?a demand) for the 
establishment of new economic forms and new forms of 
relationships, which enables me to speak of our ability to 
contain the situation and advance toward the unification of 
[words indistinct]. We should advance, and we have the 
opportunity to do so in the (?present) situation. I understand 
that it will be not easy, difficult [words indistinct]. 
  [Naumenko] Because Ukraine will shortly have a newly formed 
government, the Ukrainian president was asked to dwell in 
greater detail on possible key personnel changes and 
replacements in the make-up of the government. 
  [Kravchuk] You see, choosing people now and [words 
indistinct] cannot be a purely personal matter of the president. 
I believe that when we begin nominating a prime minister, I 
think it will happen before the presidential elections -- a 
newly elected legislature has to nominate a prime minister -- I 
will hold the widest-possible consultations with the various 
factions, the deputies' groups, and I will not only hold 
consultations but I will have to know the distribution of 
forces; that a particular candidate will be accepted and voted 
for because, to put it simply, I can nominate just anybody. 
However, where are the guarantees that this person will be 
accepted? 
  Therefore, after the consultations, after such far-reaching 
discussions, I believe this could be done with respect to any 
name. Currently, we have no big claims, let us say, to such 
candidates as, well, just to anyone who is [word indistinct] 
submitted for the consideration of the Supreme Council and 
receives the Supreme Council's approval. However, I must know 
the opinion of the deputies' corps and the factions' -- 
socialist, communist, or democratic -- standing on the issue. 
All this should be agreed upon. 
  By the way, there are no specific paths for Ukraine. In all 
countries of the world, before a candidate is nominated for a 
post, the nomination should be discussed and agreed upon. When 
the voting is held, I am sure that this candidate will receive 
an acceptable number of votes. The other thing is that I will 
convince the deputies, the factions, and groups that this 
candidate is the most proper person for this reason or that. I 
will convince them, but not simply by saying that I want just 
this man and nobody else, and if you do not agree, I will not 
nominate anyone else. This cannot be done. 
  I did not have the opportunity to discuss with the deputies 
the question of a candidate for prime minister. I want to 
invite on 10 May, firstly, the group of deputies who proposed 
moving the date of elections, and also those who want to come to 
me on 10 May and hold an open discussion. I will elaborate on 
my position, why I think such and such, and they can speak out 
on their positions, and ask me questions. Well, they could 
raise the issue of the prime minister; perhaps this question 
will be raised. 
  Therefore, we should not make a secret out of this. If we 
go openly to the Supreme Council, this cannot be a secret: 
These are not -- how should I put it -- palace tricks, this is 
a serious position which should be (?occupied by a person who is 
capable of holding this position). This is not simple. This 
person should be ready [words indistinct]. What I am saying now 
is that this will be done on the basis of urgent consultations 
with all factions, leaders, and groups. After this, a joint 
decision will be adopted. 
  [Naumenko] The problem of housing in Ukraine's armed forces 
is certainly one of the most acute problems of our society. 
[Words indistinct] my journalist colleague thinks, reducing 
officers personnel. 
  [Kravchuk] We need our armed forces to ensure the protection 
of the state. This corresponds with, let us say, our (?concept) 
and doctrine approved by the Supreme Council. [passage 
indistinct] 
  As for social security, we have a program to provide 
officers 
[words indistinct] the armed forces, and also a program to 
retrain them. [passage indistinct] 
  That was the leading topic in the United States of America: 
Of the money we are being allocated to eliminate nuclear 
weapons, the main proportion today has to be used to provide 
officers with (?proper housing). [passage indistinct] There are 
many opportunities for construction. There are building 
contractors who can now do this immediately [words indistinct]. 
So I cannot say that everything is ideal there, but the program 
[words indistinct]. 
  [Naumenko] In the range of economic issues, the condition of 
government settlements with the agrarian sector of the economy 
is of key importance. The following is the Ukrainian 
president's answer: 
  [Kravchuk] [passage indistinct] So, we are capitalizing on 
every opportunity to solve as fully as possible the problem of 
settling debts to the countryside, of supporting the miners, 
(?and of) subsidies we have allocated. [passage indistinct] 
  We will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the liberation of 
Ukraine and next year the 50th anniversary of the victory. I 
would like to say -- (?I have already said) -- that Ukraine will 
fully participate in all actions within the framework of the 
CIS. I now have an appeal by (Ivan Oleksandrovych Herasymov's) 
organization of veterans to determine our position with regard 
to decorations and medals, and this we are working on. So, it 
is about support both material and moral, because the people who 
were in the war at that time deserve that attitude toward them. 
By the way, the last shots fired in Ukraine -- I mean in combat 
operations -- were heard in 1944; fortunately none have been 
fired since then. 
  [Words indistinct] we have not yet fully realized what it 
means that whole generations -- let us say, (?several 
generations) -- have not seen and do not know what war is [words 
indistinct]. This is our great victory -- that we maintain 
peace and calm in Ukraine. (?Credit) here, you know, must in 
honesty be given to the veterans. [Words indistinct] and know 
what those people lived through and how much they suffered and 
how many wounds they bear today. [passage indistinct] This will 
enable them to speak out and tell us about their hard life and 
about what they lived through, so we can make everybody respect 
them. This, you know, is the culture of our society and its 
future. [passage indistinct].

    [Editorial Report] Kiev Radio Ukraine World Service in 
Ukrainian at 1500 GMT on 6 May broadcasts a 6-minute live relay 
of a meeting with veterans in Kiev on the occasion of the 
Victory Day, where President Leonid Kravchuk made a short 
address. The following is the text of the address: 
  "Dear veterans, let me first of all congratulate you on the 
49th anniversary of the victory. There are dates in the history 
of humankind that are of immortal significance. It is there 
where the victory belongs and it is one of those events that the 
victory in the Great Patriotic War is. 
  "Its role and significance are above all in that it saved 
civilization. It -- and you as its participants -- saved our 
land and our people, and it is our victory and your direct 
participation in it that made it possible for us today -- with 
such difficulty and even in torment -- to engage in 
nation-building and the construction of a new society. This is 
why whole generations are grateful to you for the victory and 
your great, honorable deed."

  [Text] In Sevastopol, veterans are celebrating the 50th 
anniversary of the city's liberation on 9 May 1944. The streets 
and squares of this hero city have not seen for a long time such 
an enormous mass of people as that which gathered this morning. 
It was exactly half a century ago that the city was liberated 
from the fascists. Over 1,000 war veterans arrived for the 
celebrations. They laid flowers and wreaths at the fraternal 
graves and observed a minute of silence in honor of the dead. 
  At a requiem rally held on Nakhimov Square by the memorial 
to 
the heroic defenders of the city, greetings telegrams from the 
presidents of Ukraine and Russia were read. 
  The gathering greeted Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov and 
Sevastopol City Chairman Viktor Semenov.

  [Text] The fulfillment of the state plan for supplying 
Ukraine with electric energy in 1994 is impossible due to a 
number of reasons. This is the essence of a statement by 
managers of Ukraine's nuclear energy complex, which was made 
public yesterday. The statement notes that there are no funds 
for purchasing nuclear fuel and spare parts. According to the 
authors of the statement, an urgent decrease in tariffs on 
electric energy and a state credit for the Ministry of Energy 
for repaying the debt of nuclear power plants are necessary.

  [Text] A rally protesting the armed intervention of the 
United States and other NATO countries in the internal affairs 
of Yugoslavia has been held at the U.S. Embassy in the Republic 
of Belarus. The rally was organized and held by the Belarusian 
Committee of Solidarity with Serbs and Montenegrins, as well as 
the Minsk City Council of the Movement for Democracy, Social 
Progress, and Justice. 
  Participants in the rally submitted to the Supreme Soviet 
and 
the government a proposal to condemn intervention in the affairs 
of other nations, to use the authority of Belarus in the 
international arena to arrange collective activities for 
resolving all of Yugoslavia's problems at the negotiating table 
and excluding the use of force by any side, as well as to 
dissociate Belarus from the unfounded UN sanctions imposed 
against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

  [Text] The State Committee for State Security [KGB] has 
held a meeting with the KGB top managing and field leadership to 
discuss the enactment of the new KGB structure and staff. 
  As KGB Chief Henadz Lavitski stated, the aim of the reforms 
is to bring the KGB in line with its goals, its time demands, 
and to break decisively with its atypical functions. 
  Currently, KGB activities include conducting intelligence 
and 
counterintelligence, and providing power and management bodies 
with information necessary for making state decisions. The KGB 
will directly participate in the implementation of a state 
anticrime program by coordinating its activities with other 
Belarusian law enforcement agencies, strictly keeping within the 
framework of their competence and the acting legislation.

<F P=106> [Interview with Belarusian Supreme Soviet Chairman Mechyslaw </F>
Hryb by Aleh Hruzdzilovich; place and date not given: 
"Mechyslaw Hryb: `We Should Not Lose Face, Sovereignty'"] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Hruzdzilovich] You are one 
of the supporters and initiators of introducing a strong 
presidential system of power in Belarus. From where do you 
derive your confidence? Is it from your disappointment with the 
current power system, or from its disability to organize things? 
Or, perhaps, as some people state, we are heading toward 
dictatorship, and the introduction of the Presidency is the 
first, legal step in that direction? Or, perhaps, there are no 
reasons to dramatize the situation -- this is simply an option 
for the most effective model of government? 
  [Hryb] I do not know anything about those striving toward 
dictatorship; in my opinion, the Presidency will allow us to 
create a system of government from the top to the bottom. The 
new Constitution is only a foundation for this -- we need a law 
on local self-governments as well. By now, nobody is 
subordinated to anybody in Belarus. Local soviets are following 
their own paths, city soviets -- their own, and so on and so 
forth. Their powers must be determined, including their 
vertical responsibilities to the president. Without the 
controllability of the system, it is impossible to even 
establish order, not to mention any movement forward. At one 
time, I had a clash with Shushkevich over this very issue. My 
attitude toward Stanislaw Shushkevich is good, but I disagree 
with him on this issue. In a democratic society, resolutions 
are adopted by the majority -- I mean, the parliament. If you do 
not want to carry out a resolution by the majority, just make a 
statement about your disagreement and retire. What has become 
of the issue of collective security? Even though the parliament 
adopted a resolution, the speaker did not stop attacking it. 
You cannot do this. The system of government cannot work this 
way. However, the point is not only in specific people, but 
also in the ineffectiveness of the government system, in which 
every disputable question, more or less, must be submitted to a 
referendum -- on the republican, oblast, rayon, or village 
soviet level. This way, we will only be quarreling with each 
other, while issues are left unresolved. 
  [Hruzdzilovich] Regarding the issue of neutrality. In 
general, this term is still being used, but it reminds me of 
that communism which was to come about... Has neutrality, as a 
matter of fact, ceased to be a goal and transformed itself into 
a card of the political game? 
  [Hryb] We do not deny neutrality, but, for the time being, 
we do not have it; it is rather doubtful whether we will have it 
before the year 2000. Can we have neutrality with 30,000 
Russian troops armed with nuclear weapons on Belarusian 
territory? We have agreed on the withdrawal of these troops, 
and they will be withdrawn; they are already being withdrawn. 
By now, however, I think that leaving our Army without the 
support of other CIS countries would just disrupt operations and 
break it into pieces. The Army will simply cease to exist. We 
will be incapable of feeding, dressing, and equipping the Army 
with good firearms. 
  [Hruzdzilovich] Do we need the Army at all, if nobody is 
going to attack us? 
  [Hryb] One must always think of tomorrow. Nobody is going 
to attack us today, but you never know what will happen 
tomorrow, do you? Yes, we have adopted a military doctrine 
which does not envision any specific country as a potential 
enemy. However, does that mean that the Army should be 
disbanded? No, it does not. Even neutral countries have 
armies. Moreover, the concept of neutrality is subject to 
change over the course of time. Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia 
actually do not have their own Armed Forces; these forces will 
appear in about 20 years, not earlier... But if the world 
shakes, what will we do? How will we defend our sovereignty? 
Are we going to be entrapped again by this side or that?

<F P=106> [Open letter issued by the chief editors of Minsk NARODNAYA </F>
GAZETA, ZVYAZDA, SOVETSKAYA BELORUSSIYA, and MINSKAYA PRAWDA; 
date not given: "Belarusian Press on the Brink of Ruin"] 
  [Text] Dear Readers! It is perhaps for the first time in 
the history of Belarusian journalism that we address you with 
those words. 
  The newspapers that we happen to manage reflect political 
and 
socioeconomic processes in different ways. Sometimes, reality 
receives utterly contrary assessments. This is only normal. A 
diversity of opinions is one of the main illustrations of social 
democratization. 
  However, the time has come for all disagreements to be put 
aside. 
  The Belarusian press has found itself on the brink of ruin! 
  Recent days have seen yet another steep jump in paper 
prices, 
now running between 8 and 10 million rubles [R] per tonne. In 
addition, rental payments and prices for printing materials, 
publishing, and transportation services have all increased 
considerably. The costs of publishing a large-circulation 
newspaper are nearing R1 billion a week. Subscription revenues 
are only enough for a few days. It stands to reason that while 
setting prices for our publications, we tried to make them 
affordable for all segments of society. This is a goal any 
civilized state should seek. 
  Unfortunately, neither advertising nor other forms of 
commercial activities, to which our papers are forced to resort, 
can ensure the continued existence for the press. 
  We have repeatedly called upon parliament and the government 
to undertake urgent measures to protect openness. Top priority 
measures include: compensating postal workers for newspaper 
shipments, distributions, and deliveries; support of printing 
enterprises; a centrally managed system of paper distribution; 
and lower taxes. Regrettably, our requests have not been heard. 
  The situation that has now taken shape forces us to suspend 
publication of our newspapers. 
  This is not a strike, even though there are grounds to call 
one. However, aware of the great responsibility assumed by the 
press during the presidential campaign, we, for the time being, 
decline from applying this legal tool to protect our civil and 
professional rights. Editorial staffs continue to work as 
normal, and are ready to resume publication as soon as a way out 
the present deadlock is found. 
  Dear Readers: Our conscientiousness is clear in front of you 
-- we have done everything possible... 
  We will also do the impossible, and will try to publish 
issues devoted to May Day [1 May] and Victory Day [9 May], so 
that we do not spoil your festive mood. 
  [Signed] Igor Osinskiy, SOVETSKAYA BELORUSSIYA chief editor; 
Iosif Seredich, NARODNAYA GAZETA chief editor; Vladimir 
Narkevich, ZVYAZDA chief editor; Nikolay Shloma, MINSKAYA PRAWDA 
chief editor.

<F P=106> [Open letter issued by Iosif Syaredich, editor in chief of </F>
NARODNAYA GAZETA: "NARODNAYA GAZETA Will Always Be With Its 
People!"] 
  [Text] Only several issues of NARODNAYA GAZETA failed to 
appear. This also applies to SOVETSKAYA BELORUSSIYA, ZVYAZDA, 
and MINSKAYA PRAWDA. The paper received numerous bewildered 
phone calls: Are the authorities unable to help the media 
during these difficult times? 
  As for NARODNAYA GAZETA, it expects fair relations with the 
state, its founder -- the Supreme Soviet -- and the government, 
rather than help. The Presidium adopted a resolution obliging 
the state to pay for the printing of laws, decrees, and other 
legislative acts on supplementary pages. Normally, it would 
have to provide the newspaper with necessary materials and 
funds. But what really happened? Until now, our newspaper has 
not been paid for the second half of last year and the first 
quarter of this year. When a question came up about purchasing 
paper for supplementary pages for the rest of the year, a 
declaration was issued, saying: "The Supreme Soviet has no 
money..." The newspaper had to secure a bank loan of more than 
1 billion rubles [R] to buy paper for those pages, ordered by 
the newspaper's founder. We hoped that this issue will be 
eventually resolved. 
  Unfortunately, after almost two months, the paper has not 
yet 
received the money back. If it were a matter of 
R100,000-200,000, one could forget this sum, but the state owes 
the paper nearly R2 billion. 
  This is why, dear readers, we were forced to suspend the 
publication of our newspaper. Beginning today, its publication 
-- and that of SOVETSKAYA BELORUSSIYA, ZVYAZDA, and MINSKAYA 
PRAVDA -- will be resumed. Serious talks were held with the 
founder and government structures. There is every reason to 
believe that the attitude toward NARODNAYA GAZETA will be more 
fair. 
  On 4 May, chief editors of the above papers met with Prime 
Minister Kebich. We upheld the interests of both our newspaper 
and the entire Belarusian press. From the state reserves, two 
tonnes of paper have been allocated and will be distributed 
among publications commensurate with the size their circulation. 
Publications whose leadership refused to join the action of 
solidarity will certainly receive their portion. Well, life is 
always easier behind someone else's back... 
  Although the paper will not be given by the state free of 
charge, the most important thing is that it has been provided 
and there is no need to deliver it from Syktywkar or Kandapoga. 
One more thing: As V. Kebich promised, future paper purchases 
will be carried out on a centralized basis. Newspapers will 
receive financial assistance in the form of cheap credits. A 
possibility arose that taxes and tariffs on printing services 
might be lowered. Most importantly, the state will subsidize 
the postal service which, in turn, will relieve the papers from 
covering delivery and distribution costs. Also, some other 
proposals were accepted which were intended to protect openness 
by stabilizing the situation of the press. 
  True, neither M. Hryb nor V. Kebich have so far signed any 
official documents confirming the compromise reached between the 
newspapers that were forced to suspend their activities and the 
authorities. However, let us hope that the high-ranking 
officials will make good on their promises. We would so much 
like to put the crisis behind us and never see it happen again. 
We decided not to wait until all legal matters are handled 
because we know that readers look forward to receiving NARODNAYA 
GAZETA and other papers every day. So, the editorial staff will 
do its best to ensure that NARODNAYA GAZETA is always with the 
people. We want to thank all those who cared for the fate of 
our paper and who would give anything for the freedom of speech, 
democracy, and the revival of their native Belarus. 
  We would like to assure you that those cases of "truancy," 
which did not happen through any fault of NARODNAYA GAZETA, 
SOVETSKAYA BELORUSSIYA, ZVYAZDA, and MINSKAYA PRAWDA, will be 
compensated for by the end of this quarter. We will keep our 
word, esteemed readers! We hope that our friendship will become 
even stronger, more sincere, and fruitful. This is why we trust 
that subscriptions for the third quarter, which began yesterday, 
will bring good results. Let me note that the price of almost 
all national publications newspapers will reach R9,000. The 
papers accepted this low amount based on the assumption that, 
like bread, newspapers should be affordable for all social 
groups -- even though there are people for whom even this price 
is too high. This is why we call for the leadership of 
enterprises, institutions, collective and state farms, and other 
people to help those who have found themselves in a difficult 
situation. NARODNAYA GAZETA should really be in every house, 
with every family. 
  [Signed] Iosif Syaredich, NARODNAYA GAZETA editor in chief.

Agreed To Convert Ilie Ilascu's Death Penalty Into 20 Years of

  [Text] On Wednesday, 4 May, sources at the parliament in 
Chisinau revealed to EVENIMENTUL ZILEI that during President 
Mircea Snegur's 28 April meeting in Tiraspol with the separatist 
Dniester leader Igor Smirnov, they have approached the issue of 
the political prisoners [held in the self-styled Dniester 
Republic], as well as the issue of the death penalty passed on 
Ilie Ilascu. The two political leaders agreed to convert his 
death penalty into 20 years of imprisonment. 
  The same sources revealed that Nicolae Andronic, the 
chairman 
of the [Moldovan] parliamentary commission in charge of having 
the Tiraspol political prisoners freed and restoring the rights 
of deputy Ilie Ilascu, was not allowed to attend the 
negotiations by the Dniester party, because of Andronic's 
inflexible stance regarding the unconditioned release of the six 
political prisoners.

<F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast: Video report from Semipalatinsk </F>
test site by S. Polyayev] 
  [Text] Russia is prepared to extend the moratorium on 
nuclear tests. In connection with this it is envisaged that all 
Russian scientists will have left the nuclear test site in 
Semipalatinsk by the beginning of July. Incidentally, right now 
only 20 percent of the original number of servicing personnel 
remain at the site. This is insufficient to maintain the site 
properly and to ensure its security. At the insistence of the 
Kazakhstani Air Force, helicopter flights over the nuclear 
facilities without a special permit are banned. The last 
authorized flight took place 13 February this year. 
  Despite the high level of radioactivity at the test site, 
the 
facilities are not being guarded. Furthermore, the local 
authorities are seriously considering setting up a livestock 
farm on the territory of the site. The military also fear that 
abandoned equipment and cables, which could constitute a 
radioactive hazard, may be removed by pilferers. An unexploded 
nuclear charge that remains in one of the galleries also 
presents a threat. It cannot be defused because there are no 
specialists, and it cannot be detonated.

cordial greetings and good wishes. The eternal glory to the

the strong spirit of the city residents, their respect for our 
history and I saw how strong is their belief that the city will 
be the main base for the Russian Black Sea Fleet.

  [Text] In their two years of existence, Russia's armed 
forces have "risen from their knees and are today completely fit 
for war," Russian Defense Minister General Pavel Grachev said. 
  "They can solve problems not only locally but on a wider 
scale too," he said in an interview with INTERFAX on Monday, 
after a traditional Victory Day ceremony of laying wreaths at 
Moscow's Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. 
  He said several new military districts and defense areas had 
been formed. One of them is the Kaliningrad Defense Area, where 
the Baltic Fleet commander is in charge of all locally stationed 
naval, land and air forces, which thus form a single powerful 
military unit, he said. 
  The North Caucasus Military District is also ready for 
combat, and, "by dividing the Volga-Ural Military District into 
two separate districts, we made forces deployed in that region 
more mobile," Grachev continued. "Apart from that, for the same 
purpose in many districts we replaced armies by brigades or 
corps. At the moment, the creation of mobile forces and the 
replacement of air defense forces with air and space defense 
forces is nearly over." 
  But forces structure in Russia's Far East has remained 
unchanged, the minister said. "After a close analysis of all 
life and service conditions of the armed forces in that region 
we came to the conclusion that we won't change anything. We'll 
most likely be able to take the final decision only after some 
exercises in the Far Eastern region. Then it'll be clear what 
system of armed forces we need in the Far East of Russia," he 
said.

  [Text] Moscow May 9 TASS -- Several dozen thousand 
Muscovites and guests from other cities and republics of the 
former Soviet Union gathered on Moscow's Poklonny Hill on Monday 
to pay tribute to the memory of Russia's soldiers who lost their 
lives defending freedom and peace in the World War Two. 
  The ceremony, which began with an inauguration of a new 
World 
War Two museum, was attended by Russian President Boris Yeltsin, 
Defence Minister Pavel Grachev, Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov and 
other high-ranking Russian officials. 
  Yeltsin made a speech and laid a wreath at the war memorial. 
He also met with war veterans to thank them for their heroism 
and wish them good health and prosperity. 
  In an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS on Monday, Yeltsin 
said that "all this can be considered as a whole: the present 
celebrations, the upcoming 50th anniversary of the victory and 
the signing of the memorandum on civic peace and accord. All 
this raises people's mood and, as a result, there is less and 
less animosity against each other." 
  "I assess what is going on now very highly," Russian Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin told ITAR-TASS. The signing of the 
memorandum and the preparations for the 50th anniversary of the 
victory over the Nazi aim at forging unity in the country. "We 
must work for unity, so that we had a normal country and could 
live a normal life," he said. 
  "Such great anniversary unites people," Yeltsin's chief of 
staff Sergey Filatov said. As never before Russia needs 
consensus. Today's festivities are in harmony with the 
memorandum of civic peace and accord, he continued. "People are 
beginning to calm down and to believe that we will be able to 
resolve this situation, avoiding civil conflicts," Filatov said. 
  "I believe that this is not an ordinary holiday, but a sign 
of a breakthrough in what is happening in Russia," Russian 
Vice-Prime Minister Anatoliy Chubays said. He stressed that 
there cannot be economic breakthrough without a psychological 
and moral breakthroughs.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Belskiy] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 9 TASS -- The Russian opposition called 
for early presidential elections in Russia as it rallied in 
Moscow on Monday to celebrate V-Day. 
  The rally was led by former Vice-President Aleksandr 
Rutskoy, 
Communist die-hard Sazhi Umalatova, Ilya Konstantinov and other 
members of the opposition. The demonstrators marched from the 
Byelorussky Railway Station in the northwest of the Russian 
capital to Manezh Square outside the Kremlin and then to 
Lubyanka Square near the former KGB headquarters. 
  Rutskoy called on the demonstrators to "meet the 50th 
anniversary of the victory over the Nazi by a victory over the 
present regime." He stressed that there is still enough time to 
understand "whether we want to go on living like this," 
referring to the disintegration of the Soviet empire. 
  Other speakers called on all opposition forces to unite in 
order to win the upcoming presidential elections. 
  Umalatova announced her decision to run for presidency, but 
at the same time recommended former Soviet Prime Minister 
Nikolay Ryzhkov for the post of president. 
  Labour Russia leader Viktor Anpilov said that the opposition 
has got its own leaders, namely Umalatova and infamous Nina 
Andreyeva. 
  He urged his supporters to begin preparations for the 
presidential elections due to take place in 1996 and suggested 
compiling lists of candidates for preliminary voting. "Let the 
people themselves choose their candidate to the supreme state 
post," Anpilov said. 
  Konstantinov, leader of the National Salvation Front, 
stressed that "it is time to set up a single, well-organised 
opposition movement and set forth a clear-cut programme of 
action." He said "there is no confidence that the next 
presidential elections will take place in 1996 as planned." 
  Konstantinov said the opposition's immediate goal is to 
unite 
its forces and collect one million signatures required for 
holding a referendum on early presidential elections. 
  According to various reports, the rally gathered about 7,000 
people. Among its organisers are the party Vozrozhdeniye 
(Revival), the standing presidium of the Congress of Soviet 
People's Deputies, the Labour Russia movement, the All-Russia 
People's Union and the Agrarian Party of Russia. 
  The Union of Army Officers led by Stanislav Terekhov also 
took part in the rally. The union's members and war veterans 
were expected to march to Manezh Square together with the 
opposition and then part with them to lay wreaths at the Tomb of 
the Unknown Soldier by the Kremlin Wall.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Chuprin report under the "Details" rubric: </F>
"Version 10 of the State Duma Deputy's Murder: Yuriy Korablin, 
Khimki Administration Head, Puts His Own Questions to the 
Competent Organs"] 
  [Text] The business relations between Andrey Ayzderdzis, 
the deceased State Duma deputy, and Yuriy Korablin, head of the 
administration of the city of Khimki, were highly strained. 
That is what many of the mass media have been claiming since 
Ayzderdzis' tragic murder 26 April. 
  Among other things, Ayzderdzis was Korablin's rival in the 
State Duma elections, and the administration head could not 
forgive the defeat inflicted on him by his opponent: He did not 
allocate him official premises for receiving voters and tried to 
install his own people at the MDK-Bank, which A. Ayzderdzis 
directed prior to his election to parliament. 
  It has been alleged, either implicity or openly, that 
Korablin had an interest in the death of the people's deputy. 
  Yesterday the head of the Khimki administration broke the 
"vow of silence which he had given until the body of the 
deceased is committed to the earth." He held a press 
conference. He announced that "someone stands to gain from 
fueling political passions in the region and from making 
unfounded criminal accusations against totally innocent people." 
He claimed that the uproar against him in the newspapers was 
started six months ago -- while Andrey Ayzderdzis was still 
alive. 
  "It is being claimed in the press that the MDK-Bank is a 
financially impeccable firm and that I set up my own bank in the 
city and did not want any rivals. However, I have not set up 
any commercial structures, just as I did not run for the Federal 
Assembly. In Moscow Oblast there are forces which want to 
destabilize the situation in the region." 
  Yu. Korablin believes that the oblast regional 
administration 
to combat organized crime and its Chief Major General A. 
Kartashev personally are forces of that kind. 
  "Everything that is being written about me in the newspapers 
today coincides word for word with the content of a report 
compiled by that department 24 January this year," he said. 
"Since that time I and my deputies have been tailed and had our 
telephones bugged. At that time three staffers of the 
directorate had close contacts with Ayzderdzis and visited the 
MDK-Bank almost all the time. Kartashev is deliberately 
misleading the investigation." 
  Yu. Korablin calls this the 10th plausible version of the 
killing -- the first nine, the head of the administration said, 
were described in DAILY-KOMMERSANT [as published]. Nor does he 
discount the possibility that the tragedy might have been the 
result of personal "feuds" among people involved in commerce. 
He stated that the MDK-Bank concealed 1.160 billion rubles from 
taxation last year -- there is a report from the tax 
inspectorate to that effect. In addition, Yu. Korablin said, 
summing up, "a criminal group whose head was recently murdered 
while in prison had become involved in the bank's affairs." 
  The mayor of Khimki stated that the city authorities are 
organizing an independent investigation into the deputy's murder 
and have already offered 15 million rubles as reward for 
information of help to the investigation.

  [Text] The National Socialist Party of Russia held its 
founding conference in Novosibirsk. This was initiated by the 
local branch of the movement called Russian National Unity. As 
Interfax learned from its leader, Yuriy Garov, the National 
Socialist Party intends to work to improve the political and 
economic situation in Russia. 
  According to Garov, unlike Zhirinovskiy and Zyuganov, the 
national socialists can stabilize the country's economy in a 
year, "by using the 1933 experience of German national 
socialists aimed at improving the nation's genetic fund." 
  As Garov said, in its political program his party intends to 
demand that early presidential elections be held and that the 
government and other executive authorities resign. 
  However, Garov pointed out, the resignation of government 
and 
president must not be gained with the help of terrorist acts. 
When asked by Interfax's correspondent about the participation 
of Aleksandr Barkashov in the work of the founding conference, 
Garov said that the leader of Russian National Unity had failed 
to come to Novosibirsk because he was ill, and because his 
movement did not want to put his life at risk. 
  According to preliminary information, representatives from 
14 
Russian cities attended the conference.

  [Text] Members of the state customs committee of Russia 
uncovered a batch of illegal weapons on board an airliner on a 
flight from Tbilisi after it landed at Moscow's Vnukovo airport 
on Saturday, officials of the anti-narcotics department told 
Interfax.. 
  A bag containing three AKM automatic guns and six rounds of 
ammunition was found in the first section of the Tupolev-154 
aircraft after the passengers had deboarded. 
  A Russian-made sniper rifle complete with optical targeting 
and 28 cartridges as well as two pistols were uncovered in other 
bag held in the cargo bay. There was no tag on it. 
  Prosecuting officers will handle the case after police 
investigations have ended 
  Police officials say it will be hard to establish the 
identity of the arms smugglers because passengers on a flight 
from Tbilisi usually take seats as they please.

<F P=106> [By correspondent ITAR-TASS Yuriy Shcherban] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 10 May -- The SCSE [State Committee for the 
State of Emergency] court case has finally been abandoned. 
ITAR-TASS learned today at the press service of the military 
collegium of the Russian Federation Supreme Court that Judge 
Viktor Yaskin has closed this criminal case. It has not been 
closed only in the case of Valentin Varennikov, who has refused 
the amnesty announced by the State Duma. 
  The SCSE case has initially been dropped in connection with 
the amnesty, however this decision was later contested by the 
office of the Procurator General on the basis that any criminal 
case must proceed to the end. 
  The appeal was accepted by the collegium of the Supreme 
court 
and the SCSE case was sent back for a new trial. However, in 
this instance it did not come under the same article of the 
criminal code, on the basis of which the procuracy had launched 
its protest. 
  Therefore, having studied the SCSE case, Judge Yaskin has 
stopped the proceedings. 
  Although this decision does not involve Varennikov, it is 
not 
yet clear whether he will have to stand trial. At any rate, the 
military collegium of the Supreme Court of the Russian 
Federation has not taken any decision yet with regard to this 
matter.

<F P=106> [Interview with State Duma agrarian faction member A. Popov </F>
by Yuriy Strukov; place and date of interview not given: 
"Andrey Popov: `Will Bankers Begin Sowing?'"] 
  [Text] Accusations against commercial banks have already 
become traditional. Inflation, the crisis of nonpayments, 
delays in the issue of wages, merging with the criminal world -- 
that is a far from full list of the sins ascribed to nonstate 
banks. Moreover, many specialists in macroeconomics believe that 
commercial banks, controlling up to 70 percent of the country's 
financial resources, are releasing them mainly for "short-term" 
trade and middleman credits while industry and the agricultural 
sector are expiring without long-term investments. The most 
unpleasant thing is perhaps that in many cases these 
descriptions of the banks are justified. What state laws and 
actions can be used today to direct the banks' activity into the 
channel of social harmony, to ensure that their revenue goes not 
only toward improving the prosperity of commercial bankers but 
also toward benefiting society? This is considered by A. Popov, 
a member of the State Duma agrarian faction, in a talk with our 
correspondent. 
  [Popov] First of all let us describe the current situation 
in the banking world. Over the five years since the first bank 
was registered over 2,000 of these financial institutions have 
appeared in Russia. Each bank has occupied its own market 
niche. One group finances "short-term" trade and middleman 
operations, obtaining superprofits. As a rule these are small 
"fly-by-night" banks whose characteristic feature is the payment 
of quite high dividends. These banks' money is constantly in 
circulation so no effective investment return should be counted 
on here. 
  Another group is far smaller numerically but it is 
represented by well known banks with a substantial incorporation 
capital. Here the interest rate on deposits is incomparably 
lower, which is understandable: The money has been invested in 
major projects and will not produce a rapid return. It is on 
these banks that we should count in planning investments. 
  [Strukov] There is just one thing I cannot understand: Why 
do your "respectable" banks give themselves an unnecessary 
headache over long-term expenses when it is possible to effect 
an excellent money "turnover" through trade.... 
  [Popov] The point is that a number of nonstate banks has 
reached such a level of stability and concentration of financial 
resources that it is simply not to their advantage to run risks 
by investing money in rather unpredictable trade operations: If 
they do not collapse they may still substantially damage their 
reputation. And reliability is strengthened only by joint 
ownership, through investments, of industrial, agricultural, and 
civilian real estate into which bankers will naturally put 
progressive technologies. 
  [Strukov] But somehow the banks' desire to invest in plants 
and state farms is so far going unnoticed.... 
  [Popov] I disagree. This process is developing. Whereas 
last year of 13.5 trillion rubles surplus in bank accounts just 
0.5 trillion went in investments, this year the latter indicator 
increased to 3-3.5 trillion. But in one thing you are right: 
So far the state and its legislative organs are giving only 
feeble encouragement to this trend. 
  For instance, everyone knows of the very grave situation in 
the agrarian sector. God grant that we can pay off the state's 
"Gaydar" debts not to mention long-term expenses. Some large 
banks have proposed to the top organs of executive power that 
they invest in the countryside. For instance, the following 
scheme has been proposed: We invest half the resources for a 
specific program under a Ministry of Finances guarantee, the 
state pays for the other half. A sensible approach, in my view. 
On the one hand the commercial banks are not yet so wealthy 
that they can take on all concerns for the countryside. On the 
other, it is possible to halve the "agricultural" burden of the 
state budget with its deficit and to lend impetus to the 
countryside's development. 
  There is a similar situation in industry. But the government 
and the Ministry of Agriculture seem not to notice this 
initiative on the banks' part. I stress, they are not rejecting 
it but nor are they supporting it. It remains for us to pin our 
hopes on the federal assembly.... 
  [Strukov] Perhaps this position on the part of the executive 
power can be explained by the information on the allegedly 
planned introduction of a state of emergency in the economy. 
Many experts are inclined to believe that this is borne out by 
the recent Central Bank decision to raise the minimum 
incorporation capital for commercial banks to 2 billion 
rubles.... 
  [Popov] This measure on the Central Bank's part is in my 
opinion fully justified. There should be some kind of 
limitation on the dissipation of financial resources. A bank is 
a solid institution. The previous minimum incorporation capital 
-- 100 million rubles -- considering inflation can no longer 
ensure the reliability of a particular bank. Furthermore, as I 
have already said, small banks are most vulnerable to criminal 
structures. 
  As for the state of emergency, I think our economy has long 
been working in this state. If someone has only noted this now, 
then I do not think there are grounds for global conclusions.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksey Filatov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 10 TASS -- Russian Vice-Premier Aleksandr 
Zaveryukha is sharply opposed to the reported "plans to 
decollectivize" the Russian agriculture which, in his opinion, 
may produce "unpredictable social consequences". 
  Interviewed by ITAR-TASS, Zaveryukha described these 
proposals as a "rash" and blamed the radical democratic circles 
for them. 
  "Radicalism is unacceptable in agriculture. The land reform 
will yield fruit only if it develops in an evolutionary way," 
Zaveryukha said, adding that "some radical democrats dislike 
it". The vice- premier did not explain whom he meant. 
  Plans to decollectivize agriculture before the spring sowing 
campaign could be advanced only by "a man, who is poorly versed 
in agricultural production in our country, and who has no idea 
about developments in other countries," the vice-premier 
stressed. 
  Moreover, Zaveryukha noted that the overwhelming majority of 
Russian collective and state farms had already changed their 
form of property. He said that more than 90 per cent of such 
husbandries have already been turned into joint-stock societies. 
  "They are no longer collective and state farms, but 
associations of free commodity producers with their own land 
plots and shares. They are already owners. And nobody has any 
right to tell them how to work and what form of management to 
choose," Zaveryukha stressed.

  [Text] Mission Control Centre May 10 TASS -- The crew of 
the Russian space complex "Mir" is undergoing medical checks 
today. The commander and the flight engineer's cardio-vascular 
system is being checked with the help of a "chibis" 
pneumo-vacuum spacesuit imitating earth's gravitation. Doctor 
Valeriy Polyakov will carry out the experiment "sport" for 
determining optimum physical training sessions during prolonged 
space flights. 
  The cosmonauts photographed Russian central and southern 
regions this morning, in accordance with the earth's natural 
resources programme, using the "Priroda-5" photography complex. 
The space crew conducted geophysical and astrophysical studies 
and technical experiments on May 7 and 8.

  [Text] Vladivostok May 10 TASS -- Another Russian Pacific 
Fleet officer was murdered by several gunshots fired into his 
back near the entrance to his house. According to the Pacific 
Fleet Navy press service reports, the victim was returning home 
after patrolling city streets on Monday night, when he was 
suddenly attacked by two unidentified persons. The officer had 
his service revolver on his person, but he could notv use it. 
The bandits took away his pistol and documents and disappeared. 
  Lately there have been quite frequent attacks on army 
officers in the maritime territory, mainly with the aim of 
robbing them of their service arms. Major Tedeyev, who was on 
guard duty in his unit, was attacked by two unidentified persons 
two weeks ago. After murdering him, the bandits ran away with 
two pistols and cartridges. 
  The Vladivostok police department and the military 
prosecutor's office are investigating the case.

  [Text] Is it true that Afghan mojahedin are taking part in 
the war between Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan? [signed] I. 
Kirillov, Moscow. 
  Recently the 20-year-old Afghan mojahedin Bakhtlyar 
Verballakh Baberzaid [name as transliterated], was captured by 
the Karabakh side in Azerbaijan's Fizulinskiy Rayon. The young 
captive, who comes from the Afghan city of Mazar-e Sharif, told 
an INTERFAX correspondent that in his opinion there are 
2,000-2,500 Afghan mojahedin permanently in the Azerbaijan army. 
He said that up to 250 mojahedin are fighting on the 
Fizulinskiy Rayon salient alone, where he was in command of a 
detachment of 20 men. 
  The prisoner also reported that in Azerbaijan he was 
promised 
remuneration of up to $5,000 a month. For the first two months 
-- a trial period -- he was paid in local currency, 1,000 manats. 
  He said that the Afghan mojahedin are mostly used in the 
infantry, in the assault detachments since most of them have 
rich experience of warfare in mountain conditions and have an 
excellent mastery of all types of firearms, mainly 
Soviet-produced ones.

<F P=106> [Aydyn Mekhtiyev report under the "Conflict" rubric: </F>
"Another Karabakh Settlement Attempt Fails. Baku Believes That 
Middlemen Have Taken Armenian Side"] 
  [Excerpts] Negotiations on a settlement of the 
Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict, which took place on 4 and 5 May 
in Bishkek under the auspices of negotiators of a CIS 
Interparliamentary Assembly peacemaking group and the Russian 
Federation Government, did not, as many observers predicted, 
contribute to the solution of the sharp contradictions between 
official Baku and the Armenian side. [passage omitted] 
  The call on the conflicting sides to cease fire on the night 
of 9 May sounds at least strange given that by refusing to sign 
the protocol Baku has effectively assumed no cease-fire 
obligations. An official spokesman for the Azerbaijani Foreign 
Ministry, who asked not to be identified, told your NEZAVISIMAYA 
GAZETA correspondent that Russia and chiefs of the CIS 
Interparliamentary Assembly, who formally acted as middlemen at 
the Bishkek meeting, have in many instances effectively backed 
the Armenian side's demands, a stance that has become a factor 
of pressure of sorts on the Azerbaijani delegation, which 
nevertheless did not sign the final protocol. On the day when 
consultations on the Karabakh settlement started in Bishkek, the 
Azerbaijani leader left for Brussels, where a document on 
Azerbaijan's joining the NATO "Partnership for Peace" program 
was signed. According to available reports, NATO chiefs have 
stated their organization's readiness to take necessary steps to 
establish security and stability in the region. The fact that 
on his way from Brussels to Baku Geydar Aliyev made a brief 
stopover in the Turkish capital, Ankara, underlines the 
importance attached by the Baku authorities to Turkey's support 
in the current difficult situation. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Reports by Nargiz Sadykhly and Azertadzh: "Azerbaijani </F>
Members of Parliament in Bishkek"] 
  [Text] A parliamentary delegation of the Azerbaijan 
Republic left on 3 May for Bishkek for a meeting of the 
Interparliamentary Assembly of members of the CIS. 
  As Vice Speaker Afiyaddin Dzhalilov, leader of the 
delegation, declared at a briefing prior to departure, B. 
Ararktsyan, chairman of the Supreme Council of the Republic of 
Armenia, Armenian deputies, representatives of the Azerbaijani 
and Armenian communities of Nagornyy Karabakh, political 
scientists, experts, leaders of the Aland Peace Institute 
(Finland), and representatives of the Aland and Finnish 
parliaments would be taking part in the meeting convened on the 
initiative of M. Sherimkulov, chairman of the Supreme Council of 
Kyrgyzstan, and V. Shumeyko, chairman of the Interparliamentary 
Assembly, together with the Azerbaijani members of parliament 
(G. Guliyev, M. Efendiyev, Sh. Aliyev, S. Mamedov, and M. 
Zabelin). The question of a peaceful settlement of the Karabakh 
confrontation will be discussed. 
  The main issues will be a cease-fire the length of the 
front, 
the withdrawal of troops from the occupied territories, and the 
return of refugees to their permanent places of residence. 
  The Azerbaijani delegation will also seek a political 
assessment of the aggressive actions of Armenia, which has 
occupied 20 percent of the territory of Azerbaijan. Concerning 
the question of the possible deployment of a CIS peacekeeping 
force on the territory of Nagornyy Karabakh, A. Dzhalilov 
emphasized that the Azerbaijani side would accept only political 
and diplomatic mediation, and nothing else. "The cause of the 
Azerbaijani people is just. We will uphold the interests of 
Azerbaijan in every possible way," the vice speaker concluded. 
<H8>  *** </H8>
  The first positive signs emerged at a meeting in the capital 
of Kyrgyzstan of working groups of the CIS Interparliamentary 
Assembly on Karabakh. Following three hours of negotiations 
behind closed doors, journalists' questions were answered by 
Afiyaddin Dzhalilov, deputy chairman of the Azerbaijan National 
Assembly. 
  "It is hard to say whether some document will be signed at 
the meeting," the head of the Azerbaijani delegation declared. 
"Discussions are taking place, primarily concerning the 
withdrawal of the Armenian armed formations from the territory 
of Azerbaijan, the return of the refugees, and the establishment 
of a lasting cease-fire." A. Dzhalilov observed that the 
question of observers would be decided today. To the question: 
"How does the Azerbaijani delegation view this request," A. 
Dzhalilov said: 
  "We proceed from the fact that the conflict has grown into a 
war and that Armenia and Azerbaijan should resolve this by 
peaceful means. It is today a question of not burying the 
problem in the `sand,' a war is under way on the territory of 
Azerbaijan. One million refugees are living under tent-city 
conditions. Because of this, reason must prevail."

<F P=106> [Article by F. Arnfolgu: "Investigation Completed"] </F>
  [Text] On the even of the second anniversary of the fall of 
Shusha a briefing was held in the republic procuracy. 
Procurator General of Azerbaijan Ali Omarov reported that the 
investigation of the case of the betrayal of the city of Shusha 
to the enemy had been completed. More than 4,000 witnesses had 
been questioned and more than 400 expert appraisals conducted. 
The accused are the former defense minister, Ragim Gaziyev, the 
regimental commander Nail Kyazimov, and self-defense battalion 
commanders Fakhraddin Safarov and Tofig Oguz and another 
individual whose name A. Omarov refused to give. 
  R. Gaziyev is being accused of abuse of power, appropriation 
of state property in especially large amounts, and also illegal 
acquisition of weapons. N. Kyazimov and F. Safarov are being 
accused of insubordination and willful departure from their 
positions during combat actions. The last two are no longer 
living. 
  The investigation established that on the eve of the seizure 
of Shusha half of the 1,500 personnel of the Azerbaijan army 
were absent. To the question of who gave the order to withdraw 
the combat equipment from the city the leader of the 
investigatory group, an investigator of especially important 
cases under the Procuracy General, Medzhid Khasyyev, answered: 
"The technical equipment was not withdrawn from the city, it was 
in unfit condition." 
  A. Omarov stated that he deliberately did not use the word 
"treason" because he does not believe that anyone could betray 
the Motherland. In his opinion, the city fell as a result of 
the cowardice and negligent attitude toward their duties on the 
part of individuals responsible for its defense. But in society 
there has long been the conviction that Shusha and Lachin were 
victims of betrayal and political intrigues. 
  As M. Khasyyev noted, the seizure of Shusha and Lachin must 
be regarded in the context of the events and processes taking 
place in the republic at the time. He suggested that 
journalists ask the question why the parliament had not yet 
given a political-legal assessment of the occupation of these 
regions.

<F P=106> [Azertadzh report: "Protecting the Interests of the People </F>
and the Interests of the State. President's Apparatus 
Conference"] 
  [Text] On 29 April in the president's apparatus, under the 
chairmanship of President of the Republic Geydar Aliyev, there 
was an expanded conference with the participation of management 
workers of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. 
  The conference opened with an introduction by Geydar Aliyev. 
  A report was heard from Minister of Internal Affairs of 
Azerbaijan Vagif Novruzov. 
  Speaking of the activity in recent years of the ministry, 
which occupied an important position in the system of state 
structures, the speaker noted that, while implementing a number 
of measures, the Ministry of Internal Affairs had still been 
unable to handle the duties assigned to it. Serious mistakes had 
been made in the area of providing for collegial leadership and 
in the selection and placement of personnel. 
  The speaker was disturbed about the negative public opinion 
that had developed concerning the workers of the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs and local police organs, who were called upon 
to wage a battle against crime, bribery, and corruption. The 
speaker emphasized that we must not put up with the fact that 
confidence in the police organs is decreasing each day. The 
fight against crime has slackened and cases of traffic safety 
violations are becoming more frequent. 
  Analyzing the activity of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, 
the speaker noted that, having at one time been subjected to 
pressure from certain political groupings, the central apparatus 
of the Ministry of Internal Affairs has ended up incapable of 
performing the difficult tasks facing it in this difficult 
period for the republic. Although many devoted professionals 
work here, people who honestly serve the interests of the 
people, the leadership of the Ministry of Internal Affairs 
cannot organize their work correctly. The lack of unity in the 
central apparatus and among members of the collegium has led to 
serious shortcomings in the ministry's work. The atmosphere 
created in the collective has not been benevolent and 
possibilities of improving its work are not being taken 
advantage of. Serious shortcomings have been allowed in the 
organization of the activity of local internal affairs organs. 
  Having discussed problems of selection and placement of 
personnel, the speakers noted the shortcomings in this sphere. 
Sometimes new appointments were made without the knowledge of 
members of the collegium and there was a negligent attitude 
toward suggestions to regulate personnel policy. The speakers 
spoke with alarm about the fact that cases of bribery and 
corruption are encountered in the very organization that is 
called upon to fight such phenomena. 
  It was noted that the main reason for the serious mistakes 
and shortcomings in the system of the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs lies in the lack of the corresponding republic 
legislation. Police organs are still working with obsolete laws 
and regulations, which has a negative impact on the 
effectiveness of the measures taken. At the conference the idea 
was expressed that workers of the police force, which was 
previously called upon to defend the interests of the people and 
the interests of the state, should not join any political group. 
There was also discussion of the need to strengthen the 
material and technical base of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, 
the use of advanced practice for stepping up its activity, and 
the adoption of measures to reinforce social protection of 
police workers and improve the conditions for their work. 
  The results of the conference were summed up by the 
President 
of the Republic Geydar Aliyev, who discussed in detail the tasks 
facing organs of the Ministry of Internal Affairs today. 
  First Deputy Prime Minister Fuad Guliyev, state advisers 
Arif 
Ragimzade and Gabil Guseynli, and other officials participated 
in the work of the conference.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tigran Liloyan] </F>
  [Text] Yerevan May 10 TASS -- Speaking on the Armenian TV 
late on Monday evening, Davil Shakhnazarian, roving ambassador 
under the Armenian president and the republic's acting security 
minister, expressed the hope that the Karabakh conflict would be 
settled shortly, stressing that this required the posting of 
Russian peace-keeping troops in the conflict area. 
  "The withdrawal of Karabakh troops from the occupied Azeri 
territories is out of the question, unless disengagement forces 
are moved into the region, guaranteeing a ceasefire there," he 
stated. 
  "International inspectors are unable to provide such 
guarantees," Shakhnazarian stated. "The disengagement forces 
must come from Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent 
States. These are the realities that we must reckon with," he 
added. 
  Shakhnazarian believes that the Karabakh war is to end soon. 
"This war," he stressed, "can have only one end -- a lasting and 
guaranteed peace," he noted, stressing that "the present Azeri 
leadership has today come closer to a ceasefire than ever 
before". 
  "All the world recognises Nagorno-Karabakh as an independent 
military-political factor in the region," the Armenian 
president's representative said. "Azerbaijan will also recognise 
this soon," he is convinced. 
  Nevertheless, Shakhanazarian believes that Baku continues to 
pin hopes on a military settlement of the Karabakh problem. "The 
Azeri leadership's stand is changing constantly, shifting from 
one extremity to another. Such an unstable foreign policy line 
does not add confidence in the authorities of that republic in 
the world," Shakhnazaryan noted. 
  "Armenia will go on backing Nagorno-Karabakh in everything," 
he stated, admitting that many Armenian volunteers were fighting 
in Karabakh. There must be more Armenian volunteers there, and 
they must come from all over the world," Shakhnazarian believes.

<F P=106> [Interview with Armenian Foreign Minister Fahan Papazyan by </F>
Garo Khayrabedyan; place and date not given: "Armenia Has Done 
Its Bit To Normalize Relations with Turkey"] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Khayrabedyan] How do you 
view Armenia's place in the Black Sea Economic Zone [BSEZ]? 
  [Papazyan] Like Bulgaria, Armenia is a member country of the 
BSEZ. In our foreign policy we try as far as possible to react 
positively to all initiatives, and we have the same approach 
toward the BSEZ. However, the problem is that our expectations 
in this area have not been fully justified. One of the reasons 
is that this is a new organization that is only now creating its 
structures, and this process is not yet completed. In addition, 
some of the BSEZ member countries still have not established 
good relations with one another and smoothed out their 
difficulties. In particular, I would like to mention our 
relations with Turkey, which have not been settled as yet. It 
is strange that two countries that are members of the same 
organization still have not established diplomatic relations 
with one another, not to mention that our common border is 
closed. Turkey has its own explanations for this, and some of 
them are perhaps understandable, but in reality the relations 
between our two countries are such that there can be no question 
of cooperation between us at the moment. For its own part, 
Armenia has done everything possible to normalize relations with 
Turkey. We have done our bit, it now remains for the other side 
to meet us halfway. If Turkey is interested in developing and 
expanding its relations with Armenia, it should take the 
necessary steps. However, it is absolutely unacceptable to set 
conditions for this. We are often told that if we achieve a 
truce in Nagorno-Karabakh, if the self-defense units of the 
Karabakh Armenians pull out of some of the occupied regions, 
then everything will be settled. We find this approach 
unacceptable. I would like to stress that our country's foreign 
policy is based on the principle of equality with every state 
before the law. 
  [Khayrabedyan] Does Armenia intend to join the Partnership 
for Peace Program? 
  [Papazyan] It is my opinion as foreign minister that Armenia 
will join sooner or later. 
  [Khayrabedyan] Georgia has already joined, and Azerbaijan is 
about to do the same. Is Armenia not delaying things, and may 
this not have consequences for your country? 
  [Papazyan] I think there is no reason for alarm. We are not 
obliged to do everything that the Georgians, Azerbaijanis, or 
anyone else do. We have our own state policy and our own 
interests, and will join when we consider the time is most 
appropriate. 
  [Khayrabedyan] What is your view on solving the 
Nagorno-Karabakh conflict? Will the appointment of Swedish 
diplomat Jan Elliasson [name as transliterated] as chairman of 
the Minsk Group of the CSCE help toward an early settlement of 
the problem? 
  [Papazyan] It is increasingly difficult to say when and how 
this war will end. Everyone should realize that 
Nagorno-Karabakh is a party to the conflict, so it should take 
part in the negotiations. It is probable that Elliason is more 
effective, in comparison with this predecessor Rafaeli [name as 
transliterated]; he is trying to change things, but I cannot 
give an assessment at the moment. I know one thing for certain, 
namely that the conflict should be settled as soon as possible 
by peaceful means, through political talks with all interested 
parties. Until this happens, I am sure that the Armenian people 
will withstand the difficulties and wait for a just settlement.

  [Text] Sochi May 6 TASS -- Chairman of the State Duma 
Committee for the Commonwealth Konstantin Zatulin has made a 
trip to Abkhazia to specify the Abkhazian stand on the eve of a 
regular round of Abkhazian-Georgian negotiations. 
  Asked about conditions to introduce peace-makers in the 
conflict zone, Zatulin stressed it should be separating and not 
occupational troops. 
  "The introduction of peace-makers in all Abkhazian areas 
would be an insult for a party to the conflict, since it would 
entail the side's recognition as incapable de facto on its 
territory. Bearing in mind the principle of equal 
responsibility of the sides, this would also result in the 
introduction of troops in Georgia," said Zatulin. 
  In his opinion, a plan to stabilize the Abkhazian situation 
should include the introduction of separating peace-making 
troops in the area of the Inguri River, presence of 
international observers in the conflict zone and a possibility 
of flexible reaction in case of a threat of conflict resumption. 
  "I hope that the upcoming negotiations will manage to bring 
closer together the Georgian and Abkhazian stands on the issue," 
said the committee chairman.

Galiyskiy Rayon is still difficult, with armed Georgian groups 
continuing to infiltrate the territory of the rayon, attacking 
civilians and carrying out acts of sabotage. A well-informed 
source in the republican government told the ITAR-TASS

  According to the aforementioned source, about 250 armed men 
are currently on the territory of Galiyskiy Rayon, having 
crossed the confrontation line between the Georgian and Abkhaz

  [Text] Last night many people in Donetsk were awakened by 
a powerful explosion. It occurred near Ilicha Avenue, one of 
the city's central thoroughfares. The Donetsk Internal Affairs 
Administration later disarmed an installation made of five 
antitank grenade launchers assembled on a truck and prepared for 
launching. The previous evening in an alley near the Donetsk 
wine plant, some boys came across an old abandoned GAZ-51 with a 
cover over its bed. The network of wires on it looked 
suspicious, so they called the militia. The militia arrived 
immediately and established that the grenade launchers were 
aimed at a residential building located 300 meters away. The 
installation was rigged with imported automatic instruments and 
remote-controlled devices permitting it to be operated from a 
distance of 150 meters. [video shows broken windows, militia

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Kislov: "Soviet Power in Mordovia </F>
Advances Against Russian President's Positions"] 
  [Text] Republic of Mordovia -- IZVESTIYA has already 
reported the decision by the Mordovian Supreme Soviet Presidium 
to restore soviet power in city and rayons. President Yeltsin 
has directed that the republic's legal acts be verified for 
conformity to the Russian Constitution. The ink was not yet dry 
on the directive when Mordovian parliamentarians dealt yet 
another blow to the prestige of the head of state by deciding to 
abolish the post of his representative in the republic. 
  Having put a stranglehold on the Council of Ministers, whose 
chairman, Valeriy Shvetsov, was hospitalized following a heart 
attack, the deputies set about the president's representative, 
Prof. Valentin Konakov. An authoritative man in the republic, 
he occupies a firmly reformist stance and is erecting 
substantial obstacles to the implementation of the idea of full 
power for the soviets. At a closed sitting of the Supreme 
Soviet Presidium the deputies decided to propose that President 
Yeltsin abolish the institution of his representative in the 
republic. 
  Probably not hopeful that the head of state would look 
kindly 
on their demarche, they decided to take a shortcut and try to 
remove V. Konakov. 
  A report, framed in black, appeared in the prosoviet paper 
MORDOVIYA about a recent meeting between Nikolay Biryukov, 
chairman of the Mordovian Supreme Soviet, and Boris Yeltsin. It 
talks of the warm reception accorded to the Mordovian speaker by 
the president. During the conversation Biryukov apparently 
asked the president what kind of state system he had in mind for 
Mordovia -- parliamentary or presidential? To which Yeltsin 
allegedly replied that it was a matter for the republic itself. 
The speaker then raised the question of the removal of V. 
Konakov from his post, describing him as a man who had fallen 
out with the representative and executive authorities in 
Mordovia. The president apparently reacted by saying: "We can 
do without representatives like that." 
  Knowing the predilection of the speaker and his newspaper 
for 
wishful thinking, people in the republic doubt whether the 
report is authentic. But it is bound to cause serious concern. 
If the president does "abandon" Konakov the proccess of 
restoring the old order in Mordovia will be complete.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Zaynetdinov and Sergey Sergiyenko report: "It </F>
Turns Out That the Moscow Militia Has One Concern -- To Tail the 
Mayor of Khimki"] 
  [Text] The assassination of State Duma Deputy Andrey 
Ayzderdzis, which happened in the evening of 26 April this year 
in the Moscow suburb of Khimki, is continuing to agitate the 
public. A joint investigating group from the General 
Prosecutor's Office, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the 
Federal Counterintelligence Service is working in the city. All 
the available manpower and resources have been brought into 
operation. Major General Vladimir Kolesnikov, chief of the 
Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs Criminal Investigation Main 
Directorate, has practically "moved" his office to Khimki. 
  However, it seems that everything is already obvious to the 
Khimki administration. That, at least, was the claim that was 
laid on thick at a news conference that was held. 
  Notably, Khimki chief Yuriy Korablin stated that 
KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA has put out a number of exclusively ordered 
(that is, generously paid for, evidently) materials indirectly 
accusing Yuriy Vadimovich and his assistants of involvement in 
the assassination. 
  The versions published in KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA are based on 
documents obtained from state structures. The chief's unfounded 
accusations against the editorial office are good reason for a 
meeting in court. And not only for journalists. 
  As Korablin stated, the Regional Administration for 
Organized 
Crime [RAOC] under the Moscow Oblast Internal Affairs Main 
Administration is directly related to the assassination! 
Specifically, he means Major General Aleksandr Kartashov, who 
heads the RAOC. 
  "We have been reliably informed that Mr. Kartashov is today 
doing all he can to lead the investigation in another 
direction.... Is this deliberate or unintentional? Either it 
testifies to a low professional standard, or else it testifies 
to a personal interest...." 
  If the head of the Khimki administration is to be belived, 
the only thing the RAOC is doing is "shepherding" Korablin about 
day and night. "Four vehicles and eight staffers are following 
me around full time, which gives you a very unpleasant 
sensation." The RAOC commented on this information as follows: 
"One section is involved in external observation, and it only 
has three clapped-out little Zhigulis."

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Chernykh report: "Reactors To Be Peaceful"] </F>
  [Text] Tomsk -- Of the five nuclear reactors at the 
Siberian Chemical Combine in the city of Seversk (Tomsk-7) only 
two are currently operational. They are continuing to produce 
weapons-grade plutonium while simultaneously providing heat and 
power for the oblast center. Shutting down the reactors would 
have catastrophic consequences for the economy and everyday life 
in the oblast.... 
  A Russian Government delegation headed by V. Mikhaylov, 
minister of atomic energy, recently visited Washington. Along 
with foreign specialists it elaborated a plan for shutting down 
reactors producing weapons-grade plutonium once alternative 
sources of power and heat supply have begun to function. In 
this connection an intergovernmental agreement will be signed on 
ending the military use of plutonium produced after the 
conclusion of the agreement. 
  Russia proposes modifying reactors to enable them to be 
switched to a purely peaceful power generating system. 
Agreements are all very well, but what is the alternative? For 
Tomsk it could be four power stations burning natural gas. In 
Seversk it is planned to modernize the heat and electric power 
station, shutting down the gas turbines. I. Petukhov, deputy 
chief engineer of the Siberian Chemical Combine, believes that 
there are still plenty of weaknesses in the plan. It will cost 
$250 million to bring four gas-turbine stations on stream for 
the oblast center. Another $120 million will be needed to 
increase the gas pipelines' capacity. And it will cost $25 
million to reequip the assembly shop at the plant which would be 
producing the gas turbines. 
  Where will these millions come from? The U.S. side has been 
quite cautious about the possible economic support. Russia has 
been left to rely primarily on its own resources. Consequently, 
the expenditure will increase, as will the time taken to 
implement the plan. That is what people in the nuclear sector 
think. As a more purposeful idea they are proposing the 
construction of a nuclear-powered heat and electric power 
station, which will be comparable in terms of cost, but will 
have the edge environmentally.

<F P=106> [Rustam Arifdzhanov article: "Zero Hour. Senators Will </F>
Finally Be Elected in Chelyabinsk. Chechnya Not in a Hurry at 
Present"] 
  [Text] Elections in Chelyabinsk have been scheduled for 15 
May. In Chechnya they are unlikely to be held in the next few 
months. But one way or another, four seats are empty in the 
upper chamber of the Russian parliament. The time has come for 
the last amendments to the composition of senators to be made -- 
zero hour. 
  The Chechen Republic was not even intending to send its 
representatives either to the Duma or to the senate. The 
declared independence of the mountain republic simply bound 
Dzhokhar Dudayev to ignore the December elections. But we will 
talk about Chechnya a bit later. 
  Things are more interesting in Chelyabinsk. Here deputies 
were elected to the Duma, but there were no elections to the 
Federation Council. "We did not manage to prepare ourselves" -- 
that was the argument of Oblast Administration Head Vadim 
Solovyev. A short trip to Chelyabinsk convinced us they have 
not actually managed to prepare themselves even now, in May. 
Well, the sharp Urals voters are not prepared to elect a 
governor to the senate. However, perceiving this, Solovyev, 
unlike many other Russian regional leaders, did not put forward 
his candidacy. Furthermore, he did not particularly want to 
elect senators in the spring anyway (maybe that was the 
reason?). But come fall.... 
  By and large, things are clear. The head of the Chelyabinsk 
administration is already involved in a protracted and fairly 
acute conflict with the State Duma five elected by the 
Chelyabinsk voters. Naturally he did not want to add to this 
the presumably complex relations with representatives of the 
oblast who will be elected to the Federation Council -- and this 
is the chamber of parliament that the regions will consider to 
be the most important. Solovyev is inwardly not prepared for 
this. And therefore, he believed, neither was the whole oblast. 
  Nevertheless, the Chelyabinsk inhabitants will elect the two 
most worthy candidates of 13. Of course, the ordinary 
inhabitant of Chelyabinsk, Magnitogorsk, or Miass, let alone a 
villager from the outlying Bashkir or Tatar districts, will not 
know all of them by name. The following names often come up: 
Magnitka Director Anatoliy Starikov; businessman Mikhail Isayev 
(in Chelyabinsk, as in the whole of Russia, a new "Russian 
roulette" has become fashionable -- putting money into 
investment funds); unemployed Andrey Belishko -- the Chelyabinsk 
"Yeltsin," a former first deputy head of administration whom 
four attempts were made to dismiss, and who was only removed 
from his post thanks to the reorganization of the apparatus. 
People also know Prosecutor Gennadiy Likhachev. In troubled 
times the people's hopes are pinned on the prosecutor -- he of 
all people will expose all the troublemakers. 
  The latest preliminary research by Chelyabinsk sociologists 
theoretically confirms my observations. The Magnitka director 
may be getting perceptibly ahead of all the others, while 
sociologists are adding another businessmen to the list of the 
aforementioned, with the comment "strange as it may seem" -- 
Andrey Sviridonov, whom rumor is ironically glorifying as an 
"obkom" [communist party oblast committee] man. 
  The list of candidates does however contain names which are 
known not just to Chelyabinsk inhabitants. At the very last 
moment, about 10 minutes before the expiry of the registration 
deadline, General Valentin Varennikov of the State Committee for 
the State of Emergency unexpectedly put forward his candidacy, 
evidently counting on the support of carefully voting veterans 
and the personnel of military units scattered around the oblast. 
In any case, he managed to gather the necessary signatures for 
registration even without an extensive publicity campaign. 
Another Muscovite, now almost forgotten in the capital -- 
Conservative Party Chairman Lev Ubozhko -- is preparing to have 
another go here in the southern Urals. 
  However, the success of "Women of Russia" at the Duma 
elections is making the candidacy of Galina Zheltikova, acting 
chairman of the oblast committee for the management of state 
property, and the only woman among the candidates, very serious. 
Many women of Chelyabinsk, incidentally, are indeed intending to 
vote for Galina. It seems that they may persuade their men, 
some of whom have been spending time with the family 
increasingly frequently recently. There is simply nothing to do 
at work. The local defense industry has launched a shorter 
working week -- people are working three or four days a week for 
three or four hours a day. The Chelyabinsk tractor plant is 
standing idle, chock full of unwanted output. An improbable 
thing has happened at Magnitka -- the blast furnaces have not 
been put out, they are being heated up, but no steel is being 
smelted. I think that there is no need to explain what that is 
about. Continuous losses. 
  Nevertheless Magnitka feels more sorry for its director than 
indignant. And anyway, if Magnitka does vote, it will vote 
specifically for him, if only to spite Chelyabinsk. The rivalry 
between the two major southern Urals cities is just as great as 
the traditional rivalry between Moscow and St. Petersburg. 
  However, regardless of where a candidate may come from, what 
position he may occupy, and whose interests he may reflect, they 
are all similar in one regard. No one has a clear-cut program 
in the event of victory. Everyone has simple slogans and they 
are all one sentence long. And, if you reflect on it, everyone 
has the same sentence: "Vote for me and things will be good." 
What do you mean good, why, by means of what? Deputies are 
usually accused that, once they have received the long-awaited 
mandate, they forget practically all their promises. It will 
not be possible to accuse the Chelyabinsk deputies of this. 
They are not promising anything. At least nothing specific. 
There is a hope that on the last day before the elections the 
candidates will let the voters know of their programs. If they 
exist, of course. 
  The Chelyabinsk elections will surprise many people with 
their originality. The election campaign has been conducted as 
if unwillingly. It has reached the point that, on the actual 
eve of the election, the chairman of the oblast electoral 
commission has been removed from his post with the remarkable 
formula "for self-removal from work." His deputy was assigned 
the task of the elections. And an astonishing "South African" 
version of conducting elections came into being. 
  Evidently, having deemed the competence of the Chelyabinsk 
voters equal to the education of the representatives of the 
famous Zulu and Bantu tribes, people here are planning to 
conduct the elections over several days. Until the people get 
into the swing of things. They will begin them straight after 
the May holidays, and perhaps the necessary number of votes will 
be gathered by the 15th. The slow elections, including a pause, 
seem to correspond to the national character more. 
  People in the know have attributed this strange system of 
conducting elections to the frank fear of making a fool of 
yourself once again. Because if Chelyabinsk does not elect any 
senators this time either, then the decisions Moscow makes about 
the validity of the local political leadership may be very 
varied. Excuses to the effect that our people are like this, 
they are distinctive, will scarcely be taken into consideration. 
  Chechnya is also talking about distinctiveness. The economic 
situation of this republic, which has declared itself 
independent, is more difficult than that of the Urals. Plants 
here have been standing idle for a long time. Money earned 
outside Chechnya is turning into stylish automobiles of Chechen 
businessmen coming here from the rest of Russia and Turkey and a 
growth in the weaponry of detachments loyal to Dzhokhayev or his 
rival Yaragi Mamadayev. Meanwhile, ordinary people are finding 
it difficult to make ends meet, and this means Russian workers 
just as it does Chechen peasants. The Dudayev administration, 
which is worried that the opposition has started to brainwash 
Moscow offices, has been forced to hint that it too is prepared 
to reach agreement with Russia. But even if it does prove 
possible to reach agreement on relations like Tatarstan did, 
then elections to the Russian parliament are scarcely possible 
in the near future. No matter what kind of ethnic hue may be 
applied here, and Mamadayev, for example, stressing the specific 
features of the republic, is thinking about the need to create a 
special organ which would include one representative from each 
Chechen clan; people here do not want elections and are afraid 
of them. 
  Both Dzhokhayev and Mamadayev have nevertheless not 
answered the question: What has happened to the money earned 
from the sale of oil products abroad by the government which 
they both headed? The first as president and the second as vice 
premier. And whether they like it or not, they would have to 
come up with an answer at an election. 
  Moscow is evidently not really insisting on the elections 
either. There is a probability that the Chechen voter, 
disillusioned with both Dudayev and the opposition, will vote 
for the famous fellow countryman who distanced himself from the 
all-Russian political arena to Groznyy. Even if Ruslan 
Khasbulatov has lost his influence in Moscow, he is nevertheless 
very undesirable as a deputy in the State Duma and all the more 
so on the list of senators. And so the "zero hour" of the 
elections that is frightening politicians in the center and in 
the localities is moving aside. 
  Chelyabinsk and Chechnya are not simply standing next to 
each 
other in the alphabetic list of Russian components of the 
Federation. Finding themselves by chance in the same bunch of 
territories not participating in the work of the Federation 
Council, they alone have united in the non-desire or not very 
great desire of the local leaders to participate in this work. 
Dudayev is worried that, if he decides to do so, he will lose 
his main trump card -- the image of fighter for independence. 
Chelyabinsk Governor Solovyev is worried that if as a result of 
the elections he gets the wrong people in the senate, it will be 
fairly difficult to run the oblast and govern it. So what is 
happening is that in one case there are no elections and there 
will not be any. In the other case they are kind of being 
conducted, but without much enthusiasm. Little Asian 
intricacies. 
  Incidentally, the border between Europe and Asia runs 
through 
the territory of Chelyabinsk Oblast and along the Caucasus 
mountain range. It does indeed.

  [Excerpt] The eternal flame at the obelisk in Plesetsk is 
a reminder of two terrible tragedies which took place at the 
missile and space flight test range. In June 1973 nine people 
died while testing rocket technology. And in March 1980, during 
preparations for a space launch, a powerful explosion of the 
already fueled space "submarine" [submarina] occured as a result 
of technical faults. Forty-eight young people died at their 
stations. According to eye-witness accounts many of them were 
engulfed by fire and burned alive instantaneously. Others, 
finding themselves in a hopeless situation, jumped from a great 
height, smashing on the concrete only to be also engulfed by the 
raging flames. [passage omitted]

Chelyabinsk-70 by Sergey Sergeyev, identified by caption] 
  [Text] [Sergeyev over video of optical fiber production 
facilities] Using standard copper wire, it is possible to 
transmit a few dozen telephone calls. But this is optical 
fiber. It is only 125 microns thick. Yet it is possible to 
transmit up to 15,000 calls along this very thin fiber. The 
technology and equipment for the production of optical fiber was 
developed in the southern Urals, at the Federal Nuclear Center 
in the closed city of Chelyabinsk-70. 
  Several years ago, the Russian Federation Ministry of Atomic 
Power and Industry approved the state conversion program 
"Russia's Fiber-Optic Communication Systems." The main part of 
the job fell to the Urals nuclear scientists, who have acquitted 
themselves brilliantly. They proposed that, unlike foreign 
firms using natural quartz which is very expensive and in short 
supply, we should use artificial quartz, which is purer and as a 
result makes it possible to increase the throughput of 
information and enhance reliability. 
  Yet listening to Anatoliy Barulin, general designer of our 
system for the production of optic fiber, you cannot but be 
amazed. Why is a Swedish fiber-optics line being installed in 
St. Petersburg and a Japanese one in the Far East, when our 
system has a great number of advantages recognized in the West.

  [Text] The first session of the new Crimean Supreme 
Council was inaugurated in Simferopol today. The session was 
opened by Aleksandr Kruhlow, a 72-year-old deputy from 
Sevastopol, organizer of many meetings in Nakhimov Square, and 
an untiring fighter for the return of Sevastopol and the Crimea 
to Russia. The newly elected deputies were addressed by Crimean 
President Yuriy Meshkov. Sharing with them their feelings 
following their election to parliament, Meshkov said that the 
new parliament is to be subservient [kyshenkovyy] and obedient 
in its attitude to the citizens, by whom it was elected. 
Aleksandr Kruhlow, who took the floor at his own initiative, 
addressed the deputies as well as television viewers and the 
radio audience -- the session was broadcast -- with the 
question: How long are you going to tolerate an artificial 
separation of the Crimea from the fatherland, that is, from 
Russia? This problem, he emphasized, has to be resolved by the 
parliament as soon as possible. 
  The newly elected deputies were also greeted by a guest from 
Moscow, Russian State Duma Deputy Konstantin Zatulin, who 
expressed his confidence that the new parliament has the 
possibility to open a new chapter in Crimean history, and that 
the Crimea will become a promised land for everybody.

<F P=106> ["Agreement on Common Principles in the Sphere of the </F>
Development of Interethnic Relations and Ethnic Cultures in 
Ukraine" signed by 12 organizations and parties] 
  [Text] We, representatives of political parties, 
movements, ethnic culture societies, and other public 
organizations, having discussed the proposals by the Association 
"For Interethnic Peace and Harmony in Ukraine" in its statement 
of 23 December 1993, share the concern expressed there about 
Ukraine's future as an independent, indivisible, and democratic 
state. 
  Distressed by the political confrontation, escalation of 
violence, and exacerbation of relations among various social and 
ethnic groups in nearby foreign countries, as well as by the 
territorial claims upon Ukraine and adhering to democratic 
principles in resolving sociopolitical problems and defending 
human rights, we consider interethnic harmony in Ukraine to be 
one of the main preconditions for maintaining and strengthening 
our statehood. We also consider the provision of social 
stability and civic peace in our society to be one of the major 
task of all political forces of the country, especially during 
the period of the formation of new power structures. 
  Proceeding from these principles, the signatories to this 
agreement have agreed on the following main principles in their 
policy in the sphere of development of interethnic relations and 
ethnic cultures: 
  1. Observation of the ethnic and religious rights of all 
citizens of Ukraine and the revival and development of all of 
its nationalities. 
  2. Opposition to all manifestations of chauvinism, 
xenophobia, ethnic prejudice, or disrespect for national 
dignity. Such phenomena must primarily be rejected by those 
organizations from whose national midst they originate. 
  3. Protection of the rights of the individual in harmonious 
combination with respect for his ethnic rights and satisfaction 
of his ethnic cultural needs. 
  4. Provision for the rights of all nationalities and ethnic 
groups of Ukraine in the new constitution. 
  5. Satisfaction of the needs of believers of all faiths and 
opposition to the incitement of interethnic hostility. 
  We are ready to create a civic committee, composed of our 
representatives, to fulfill this agreement. 
  The agreement is open to signing by all political forces and 
public organizations.

Ukraine"

<F P=106> [Report by Omar Uarashvili: "UNA Is Anxious To Head </F>
Workers' Movement"] 
  [Text] A conference of Lvov Oblast workers, which was 
devoted to the establishment of the Lvov Oblast Coordinative 
Center of Workers Movement, was held on 23 April at the Radio 
and Television Palace of Culture in Lvov. Mykola Semenchenko, 
head of the Donbas regional council of strike committees, and 
representatives of company staffs from Rivne and Vinnytsya 
Oblasts were also invited to participate in the conference 
organized at the initiative of the Ukrainian National 
Assembly-Ukrainian National Self Defense [UNA- UNSO]. UNSO 
Deputy Commander Dmytro Korchynskyy speculated that the workers' 
movement is currently in a state of "clinical death." Therefore, 
in his opinion, the UNA-UNSO should revive the movement which 
will defend the interests of Ukrainian workers. Rostyslav 
Novozhenets, deputy chief of the Lvivprylad company, pointed out 
in his speech that, as of today, privatization is ruinous, 
because it is conducted without taking into account workers' 
demands, favoring the Mafia instead. In his opinion, the 
independent trade unions are no longer able to defend workers, 
despite the fact that they are headed by Rukh People's Deputy 
Yaroslav Kendzyor. Oleksandr Ilyuk, a representative of the 
Rivne metal-concrete construction plant, as well as other 
participants, noted that they no longer trust any civil or 
political parties and trade unions, such as Rukh or the Congress 
of Ukrainian Nationalists. In their opinion, only UNA-UNSO can 
really uphold workers' demands. Participants in the conference 
adopted a resolution to establish, under UNA auspices, the 
Ukrainian Labor Assembly which will comprise company staffs, 
free trade unions, and strike committees. Also voiced at the 
conference were appeals to workers to support UNA-UNSO 
candidates in the local elections.

<F P=106> [Volodymyr Dupak report from Zaporizhzhya: "The </F>
Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Electric Power Plant [AES] Will Not Be 
Halted?"] 
  [Text] Thanks to this week's delivery from Novosibirsk of 
nuclear fuel to the 61st-assembly Zaporizhzhya AES [nuclear 
electric power plant], the problem of fuel provision has been 
resolved for about one year. 
  As reported by the Information Center of the Zaporizhzhya 
AES, in summer, each one of the operating power units will be 
halted for a scheduled overhaul involving the reloading of fuel. 
This work will be started with Power Unit 1, which is presently 
under repair. 
  However, do not hasten to answer in the affirmative to the 
question posed in the heading. Under the pressure of the 
"Greens," sessions of the local councils of people's deputies of 
Kamyanka Dniprovska in Zaporizhzhya Oblast and of Nikopol in 
Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, adopted a decision to hold, on 26 June, 
local referendums on building storage facilities for dry used 
nuclear fuel on the territory of the Zaporizhzhya AES. 
  We hope that residents of these towns and adjacent rayons 
will trust the conclusions made by atomic specialists -- not 
only ours, but also those from the United States, Germany, 
Sweden, and Canada, where the system for dry-storing used 
nuclear fuel is already used. If the construction work takes one 
or one and one-half years longer, the Zaporizhzhya AES will have 
to start closing down power units next [1995] summer. 
  The reasons are that used nuclear fuel has not been 
evacuated 
from the plant for a long time, but accumulates in the 
reservoirs inside the sealed shells of the units. They cannot 
stretch indefinitely.

<F P=106> ["ay"-signed report: "Economic and Political Integration Is </F>
Being Pushed Systematically"] 
  [Text] Duesseldorf, 5 May -- Before the end of this year, 
Latvia intends to begin talks with Brussels on membership within 
the European Union. The head of government, Valdis Birkavs, has 
staked great hopes on the German Presidency. He told 
HANDELSBLATT that he believes he enjoys "a certain sympathy in 
Germany." 
  Birkavs also considers the country's further integration 
into 
Western Europe to be a demonstration of political stability. 
Following agreement with Russia on the definitive troop 
withdrawal, which was sealed in April and May this year, 
European policy has been given priority again. In June, the 
free trade agreement with the European Union will be initialed; 
early next year, an association or partnership status with the 
Western European Union [WEU] will be on the agenda, "and then we 
will go ahead with the EU negotiations." At the same time, 
talks are being held on Latvia's GATT membership. 
  Birkavs says that the free trade agreements, on which talks 
are currently being held between Brussels and the three Baltic 
states -- Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania -- are not fully in 
line with the agreements Brussels concluded with other Eastern 
European reform states. "For us, agricultural and textile 
exports, which are critical issues, take precedence." Both are 
aspects that in the agreements with Eastern Europe were not 
solved to the reform states' satisfaction. "Textile exports in 
particular are, for us Latvians, quite sensitive points. Even 
the Soviets used the textile sector in Latvia as a political 
lever. On the one hand, they forced the development of a 
personnel-intensive textile production, and then brought Asian 
and Russian labor to Latvia." Following the collapse of the 
Russian market, Latvia now has such export capacities, but also 
sees itself confronted with Western European import quotas, says 
Birkavs. 
  It is true that the negotiations with the European Union on 
accession could be held in parallel with those of Estonia and 
Lithuania, but according to Birkavs, they do not have to lead to 
identical results. Whereas Estonia is seeking a transition 
period of four years, Lithuania is considering an adjustment 
period of six years: "We in Latvia can well do without a 
transition period, because we have advanced our economic reform 
most consistently." This concerns not only the development of 
administrative market economy structures, but also many 
economically relevant areas. The privatization of state-run 
companies is to be completed within two years. Two-thirds of 
all production capacities will then be in private hands, while 
some parts of the energy sector (in particular gas production), 
the transport sector, and telecommunications will remain under 
public control. Inflation has been decreased to an annual rate 
of 15 percent, the time of a decline of GDP is definitely over. 
This year, a growth of 5 percent in real terms has been 
predicted. Even the capital market is in excellent shape, owing 
to a high influx of capital. However, the latter is not only 
attributable to the confidence of Western countries favoring 
investment in Latvia. It is largely also a Zhirinovskiy effect 
-- named after the Russian nationalist after whose election 
victory rich Russians safely deposited their money in Latvia. 
This apparently constitutes only a moral problem for Latvia -- 
"our borders are open, everyone can invest his money here." 
  Despite assessments in Western Europe, the "Baltic market" 
-- 
meaning political and economic cooperation with Estonia and 
Lithuania -- is functioning ever better and, surprisingly, 
"above all, since in Lithuania the socialists have returned to 
government." In September, the completion of the Common Market 
was agreed upon ("We will have to wait several months to see how 
it works"), customs were abolished, monetary policies will be 
aligned, energy cooperation has been deepened, and political 
coordination in the scope of the Baltic Council of Ministers has 
been improved. Birkavs admits that for the first time following 
independence, there have been problems and delays in Baltic 
cooperation, "but we are understanding one another increasingly

  [Text] The timetable for the withdrawal of the Russian 
Army, which Russia submitted as a supplement to the 
Latvian-Russian treaty signed on 30 April, does not include many 
Russian military facilities and Army units stationed in Latvia. 
According to information at the disposal of Ilgonis Upmalis, 
head of the Latvian bureau for monitoring the withdrawal of the 
Russian Army, 191 Russian Army units are stationed in Latvia at 
247 military facilities. The timetable submitted by Russia 
includes 155 military units and formations, as well as command 
structures. 
  Mr. Upmalis today explained that the formations of military 
facilities mentioned in the timetable and list submitted might 
include many separate military facilities. However, in this 
case it is impossible to define precisely the number of 
facilities and Army units included in the formations. According 
to Upmalis, it is planned during this week to assess the 
timetable submitted by Russia and to make a list of Army units 
which have not been included in the timetable. Then it is 
planned to submit the list to the command of the Northwestern 
Group of Russian Forces and the Latvian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs.

<F P=106> [Article by Sanita Upleja: "Second Reading of Citizenship </F>
Law Expected in Mid-May"] 
  [Text] Riga, 22 Apr -- Apparently, the second reading of 
the draft law on citizenship will take place on 12 or 19 May, 
when the plenary sessions of the Saeima [parliament] are 
scheduled. The working group established by Latvia's Way has 
prepared the draft, which is to be discussed by the Judicial 
Commission next week. 
  In accordance with the draft, the naturalization of 
noncitizens would begin on 1 January 1996. In the case of 
noncitizens who are entitled by this law to preferential 
treatment, it would be possible for them to apply from the 
moment the law becomes effective. 
  As DIENA was told by Aivars Endzins, chairman of Saeima 
Judicial Commission, the naturalization of noncitizens would be 
carried out in a set period of time and order of events, which 
will state which categories of people and in what order they 
will have the right to apply for citizenship. In the draft, 
prepared for the second reading, Latvia's Way has abandoned the 
primary principle of naturalization quotas, and due to the 
recommendations of experts from the European Council, they are 
now arranged in a precise order. 
  Beginning on 1 January 1996, noncitizens, who were born in 
Latvia and are between 16 and 23 years of age, would be able to 
apply for citizenship. The draft law foresees a five-year 
period for obtaining citizenship; at the beginning of 1996, this 
period will be completed, so it will be possible to begin 
naturalization. After that, beginning on 1 January 1997, the 
next group of noncitizens, those who were born in Latvia but are 
older than 23, will be addressed. In 1998 -- people who arrived 
in Latvia as infants. 
  According to the draft law, all other people wishing to 
obtain Latvian citizenship would be able to apply beginning in 
the year 2000. 
  The draft law foresees preferential treatment for people who 
are permanent residents in Latvia, whose relatives are of 
second- generation Latvian or Liiv origin, and their spouses, as 
well as for people who have legally arrived to Latvia before 
1940, people who were brought to Latvia by force during the 
German occupation and their descendants, and spouses of Latvian 
citizens. As A. Endzins explained, these people can submit 
naturalization applications as soon as the law becomes 
effective. The naturalization of this category of individuals 
could be finished before the next round of Saeima elections, 
therefore these people will be eligible to vote by that time. 
  The draft law on citizenship foresees that Latvian 
citizenship can be obtained by so-called Russian Latvians, whose 
ancestors were living in Latvia before 1 August 1914, and who 
now permanently reside in Latvia. 
  The draft also states that retired Russian military 
personnel 
and their family members cannot apply for Latvian citizenship, 
except in cases where they have were born or mobilized in 
Latvia, but even then the naturalization process takes place in 
due course, according to the obligations fixed by the law -- 
knowledge of the Latvian language, Latvian history, and the 
Latvian Constitution, as well as loyalty and the number of years 
[of residency] defined by the law. 
  Regarding military pensioners as well as other foreigners 
and 
stateless individuals, their status should be defined by the law 
on foreigners and stateless people, which should be adopted in 
concert with the citizenship law, stated Judicial Commission 
Chairman A. Endzins. The Juridical Commission is currently 
drafting the said law for its first reading, on the basis of 
drafts submitted by Latvia's Way and the Concord for Latvia. In 
addition, the Latvian National Independence Movement and 
"Fatherland and Freedom" have submitted their own draft laws on 
foreigners and stateless people.

  [Text] Riga, May 10 (LETA) -- The newspaper DIENA reports 
today on a possible replacement of some ministers which was 
discussed at the meeting of the "Latvia's Way" faction on 
Saturday [7 May]. However the party's official stated that 
there is no connection between the scheduled changes in the 
government and a possible breakdown of the ruling coalition. 
Some portfolio reappointments might be expected after the 
discussion on the work performed by the government during nine 
months. Apparently the changes in the government will possibly 
occur before MP summer vacations. One of the leaders of 
"Latvia's Way," Indulis Berzins, said that it is not an intended 
breakdown of the coalition which is in question. If the premier 
wishes to replace a minister this post will be offered to a 
counterpart of the coalition. In case the Farmers Union's 
officials find it necessary to leave the coalition then 
portfolios will be offered to other parties with the exception 
of right and left radicals -- "Equal Rights" and "For Fatherland 
and Freedom".

  [Text] The head of Lithuania's parliament said he was 
alarmed by Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev's recent 
statement that Russia might suspend its troop withdrawal from 
Estonia. 
  Ceslovas Jursenas, in an interview with Interfax on Monday, 
expressed the hope that Grachev had been stating his own rather 
than President Boris Yeltsin's position. 
  "Any delays with the troop withdrawal, and especially the 
deployment of an additional contingent, would not only be a 
clear manifestation of pressure on what is a sovereign state but 
would also mean disregard of the opinion and position of the 
world community and a violation of provisions enshrined in the 
documents of the United Nations, the Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe and other influential international 
organizations," Jursenas said. 
  "It is not pressure but negotiations based on principles of 
equality and mutual respect that are the only way to solve 
problems," he said.

  It indicates that a statement made by Pavel Grachev and 
Russia's policy in general on the negotiations with Estonia show 
disrespect toward the partner in negotiations and for 
international law as well as for the processes and documents of 
all Europe's members and participants, of which Russia itself is 
one [sentence as heard]. 
  Such statements made by high-ranking Russian officials 
increase tension in the region and threaten the security of the 
Baltic countries, the statement by the Lithuanian Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs reads.

  [Text] Vytautas Landsbergis, leader of the Lithuanian 
Seimas right-wing opposition, made a statement yesterday 
concerning pressure exerted on Estonia by the Russian 
militarists. 
  The statement reads: Now comes Estonia's turn, after Latvia 
had been overtaxed. Open blackmail is used by the Russian 
minister of defense, who threatens that if the conditions of his 
country are not accepted, the remaining 2,500 foreign servicemen 
will not be withdrawn from Estonian territory; even an 
additional invasion [as heard] could not be excluded. This is a 
challenge to the West, and at the same time is a test of how 
Russia would be allowed to treat Estonia -- and before long, 
Lithuania. Our nearest neighbors should come to the aid of 
Estonia while reminding the Russian militarists and the world 
that these troops have to withdraw from Estonia unconditionally. 
  If the troops remain deployed against Estonia's will, then 
it 
will prove once again that these troops remain occupational 
troops and are being used for the preparation of a new 
aggression. In turn, a big country threatening a small neighbor 
with armed force should not even apply for acceptance into the 
Council of Europe. 
  All this strangely coincides with the anniversary of the end 
of World War II. It would be beneficial for the world to be 
aware that this war has not yet ended everywhere. In Estonia, 
the foreign troops that entered Estonia 50 years ago continue to 
be deployed there against Estonia's will. In some capital 
cities of Europe, embassy buildings of the Baltic states 
continue to be seized by Russia," Landsbergis' statement reads.

  [Text] Vilnius, May 09, BNS -- A recent Baltic summit in 
Jurmala may have encouraged Russian Defense Minister Pavel 
Grachev to make a threatening statement with respect to Estonia, 
the leader of the Lithuanian parliament's rightist opposition 
said Monday [9 May]. 
  Vytautas Landsbergis told reporters in Vilnius that judging 
from Russian TV reports, Lithuanian and Latvian president's 
urged Estonian President Lennart Meri to accelerate troop 
withdrawal talks with Russia. 
  The opposition leader said is was "a big political mistake" 
to urge Estonia without urging Russia because two Baltic states 
indirectly pressured the third one. 
  Landsbergis also noted that the future of Russian troops in 
the Kaliningrad region should be discussed on an international 
level. Commenting on Russia's intentions to merge Kaliningrad 
navy, army and air force headquarters into one center, 
Landsbergis said such steps are usually done to improve the 
efficiency of operations. 
  Politically, Landsbergis said, the step would mean that 
Russia strengthens its military presence in the center of 
Europe. He said there is also a possibility that Russia wants 
to know the limit beyond which there would be strong reaction 
from the West.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladas Burbulis </F>
especially for ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA: "Will the West Open Its 
Embrace if Moscow's Position Does Not Suit Vilnius?"] 
  [Text] "Following the latest round of talks with the 
Russian delegation headed by Ambassador at Large Viktor Isakov 
on 21-22 March in Moscow, the Russian position has not changed 
but has not hardened either," Virgilius Bulovas, ambassador at 
large, member of the Seimas, and leader of the working group 
holding negotiations with CIS countries under the Lithuanian 
Foreign Ministry, stated. He announced that a document has been 
prepared and will be sent to Mr. Isakov; this document is, so to 
speak, an indirect response to the letter sent just the other 
day by Russian President Boris Yeltsin to our head of state 
Algirdas Brazauskas. 
  "We have some doubts as to whether the Russian side has 
correctly understood our objectives regarding military transit 
from Kaliningrad Oblast via Lithuanian territory. We merely 
expounded these orally at the meeting in Moscow without handing 
over the text of the appropriate document. In the letter 
addressed to Mr. Isakov we have now expounded Lithuania's 
official position on this issue," V. Bulovas said. 
  Explaining the essence of Vilnius' position on the problem 
of 
military transit, the Lithuanian ambassador said that for the 
time being the Seimas has not adopted an appropriate law and the 
republic's authorities are certainly not hindering the 
transportation of the Russian troops and weapons that are being 
withdrawn from the former GDR, thereby acting on the basis of 
bilateral agreements. He also announced that at the present 
time a statute on the transportation of dangerous military 
freight via Lithuania is being prepared for adoption. "We are 
not hiding the fact from Russia that in preparing this document 
we are consulting with specialists from other countries, and 
when the plans are ready we will discuss them with Russian 
experts." 
  The ambassador had difficulty in naming a date for the next 
meeting between the Lithuanian and Russian Federation 
delegations. Among other things, this will deal with certain 
transit conditions and also the coming into force of the 
agreement on reciprocal granting of most-favored-nation trading 
status signed by the premiers of the Russian Federation and 
Lithuania in Vilnius last November. 
  The agreement is vitally important for the republic because 
Russia is Lithuania's principal economic partner, but Moscow is 
putting forward more and more conditions, linking its 
implementation, for example, with demands for guarantees from 
Vilnius that it will ensure the normal economic activity of 
Kaliningrad Oblast. 
  "Lithuania does not intend to take any measures that would 
damage the oblast's economy. However, if Russia henceforth 
intends to pursue a policy of `time-wasting' in implementing the 
treaty, thereby pushing us -- whether deliberately or not -- 
into the embrace of the West, Lithuania will take appropriate 
measures," V. Bulovas said. 
  "We have invited one of the Russian foreign minister's 
deputies to Vilnius, and I hope that Mr. Isakov will accompany 
him. It is then entirely possible that a date for the next 
round of talks can be set. Even though I believe there is 
inadequate `groundwork' for such a meeting. But we will reach 
agreement with Russia sooner or later: There is a desire for 
agreement on both sides," V. Bulovas stressed in conclusion.

  [Text] Vilnius, May 09, BNS -- "We probably don't even 
remember such a devastated Vilnius," Lithuanian President 
Algirdas Brazauskas said in his traditional Monday [9 May] radio 
interview this week. 
  The president said he most probably made a mistake by 
persuading the parliament not to dissolve the Vilnius City 
Council last year. "It seemed then that new city leaders are 
emerging, and it was expected that conclusions would be drawn. 
But this did not happen," Brazauskas said. 
  Sharply criticizing activities of the capital's municipal 
authorities, the president recalled an incident with the French 
Lyonnaise des Eaux company, which suggested to create a joint 
water-supply company in Vilnius, but the proposal was rejected 
in a rude manner. 
  Brazauskas said the Vilnius council mixes politics with 
municipal problems. "One party even has its headquarters" in the 
municipality building, he said. 
  In Brazauskas' view, activities of Vilnius authorities 
defame 
the entire country because they fail to keep promises to foreign 
embassies, diplomats have to look for premises themselves. 
  The president emphasized that the city council is fully 
responsible for the present situation in the capital and added 
that the council's dissolution may have to be discussed soon. 
Brazauskas also urged the parliament to draft a capital city 
law.

<F P=106> [Report by Ricardas Jarmalavicius: "Another `State Coup </F>
Scenario' or Echoes of Moscow in Vilnius"] 
  [Text] Seimas [parliament] deputies yesterday found a 
"state coup scenario" in their office mail boxes, which was 
allegedly discovered on the eve of 1994 in Vilnius, near one of 
the "villas in Turniskes." Copies of the scenario were 
distributed at the request of A. Kuncinas, deputy chairman of 
the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDDP] faction. 
  This "scenario" and the "version No. 1," which caused a 
scandal in Moscow a month ago but which proved to be a 
journalists' forgery, are like two peas in a pod. 
  According to the authors of this "document," the 
implementation of the "coup" requires the incitement of society 
through a variety of methods, including the staging of strikes 
and the organization of referendums. This would allow for the 
ousting of Lithuania's current government and the legalization 
of a new one. 
  One of the LDDP faction leaders, who wanted to remain 
anonymous, told a RESPUBLIKA reporter that he had had copies of 
"those documents" as early as six months ago. However, he 
failed to "leak" them to the public (the newspaper has some 
information that those "documents" were circulated to other 
editorial offices four months ago, but no one wanted to publish 
them). The aforementioned LDDP leader says that he cannot find 
any arguments to refute that the "scenario" was written by the 
LDDP itself. The LDDP activist, who fears publicity, claims 
that he knows that this "plan" emerged immediately after the 
right-wing political forces lost the Seimas elections. 
  According to RESPUBLIKA information, the "coup scenario" 
will 
promptly prove useful for new actions scheduled by the LDDP. 
First of all, the latter intends to torpedo the referendum 
organized by the Homeland Union concerning the adoption of the 
law "On Illegal Privatization, Devalued Deposits and Stocks, and 
Law Enforcement Violations." The LDDP does not fear the law but 
the possibility of including a question about early Seimas 
elections on the referendum ballot at the very last moment. The 
LDDP can apply to the Constitutional Court with a request to 
examine whether the referendum law, which was adopted in the 
times of the Lithuanian SSR, does not violate the Constitution.

<F P=106> [Report by Jaunius Pocius: "The Military Demands"] </F>
  [Text] Captains J. Marcinkus and A. Arlauskas, commanders 
of Lithuania's only two air bases situated in Meskuiciai, 
Siauliai region, and Pajuoste, Panevezys region, voiced their 
distrust in the Seimas [parliament] National Security Committee 
[NSK] and its chairman, V. Petkevicius. 
  A statement sent to the president, the Seimas, and the 
government reads: "The NSK has changed from a controlling body 
into a dictatorial one. It is obvious that Chairman V. 
Petkevicius and the group which leads the committee have thus 
far failed to realize the functions that the NSK must perform." 
  The commanders claim that "the NSK leadership is exerting 
particularly powerful pressure on the Air Force. (...) The 
statement that the few current training fighters are sufficient 
to meet the needs of military aviation can be seen as inflicting 
damage to the prestige of the Air Force. The need to control 
our airspace and state borders is fully ignored. Regardless of 
state security interests, the Zokniai (Siauliai) airport, which 
lies in a perfect strategic location suitable for military 
aviation, was transferred to commercial interests. Its 
reinforced concrete hangars are used to store groceries, while 
military aircraft are standing under the open sky." 
  Asked to comment on this statement, A. Arlauskas, commander 
of the second air base, said that the NSK seems to be 
deliberately destroying the national defense system. However, 
everything is done to remove the guilt. 
  According to A. Arlauskas, V. Petkevicius, who recently 
visited the airports in Panevezys and Siauliai along with the 
president and the national defense minister, demonstrated his 
complete ignorance when he asked in everyone's presence: "From 
whom must we defend our airspace?" 
  Pilots were indignant over the behavior of the NSK chairman 
during his visit to Siauliai -- the latter allowed himself to 
degrade the commander of the first air base and the pilots by 
calling them "blue suckers." Captain J. Marcinkus sent a report 
to the president in connection with this. 
  Captain A. Arlauskas said that the majority of servicemen at 
the second air base are skilled aeronautical engineers. 
However, the latter are employed as guards, because the staff 
has not yet been confirmed. He claimed that there will soon 
come a time when there will be no one to manage the airport.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladas Burbulis] </F>
  [Text] Vilnius May 8 TASS -- During a meeting with 
Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas, chief of the 
International Monetary Fund's Baltic Branch Adalbert Knobl and 
IMF representative in Lithuania Peter Kornely expressed concern 
over the republic's increasing budget deficit. 
  The meeting was also attended by the Lithuanian prime 
minister, finance minister and chairman of Lithuania's bank 
board of directors. 
  National radio quoted on Sunday the IMF officials as saying 
Lithuania's deficit had exceeded the level specified by the 
memorandum which was signed by the republic's government and the 
IMF. Unless the situation over the mounting deficit is 
rectified in the near future, the International Monetary Fund 
may suspend credits earmarked for Lithuania. The IMF officials 
believe the first thing to be done by the Baltic republic is to 
cut back on budget expenditures. 
  The IMF representatives expressed regret that Lithuania had 
not yet passed a law on its National Bank, nor had it taken any 
measures to regulate activities of commercial banks. The 
officials were especially critical about reliability of 
statistic data which they said did not reflect the actual 
economic situation in Lithuania.

  [Text] Vilnius, May 09, BNS -- Inflation dropped to this 
year's record low of 1.6 percent in April, the Lithuanian 
Statistics Department said. Inflation ran at 3.3 percent in 
March, 2.9 percent in February and 4.8 percent in January. 
  But prices for personal care products and medical services 
went up by 6.9 percent, transportation and communication prices 
jumped by 6.7 percent. 
  Food, liquor and tobacco prices edged up by 0.4 percent. 
  Household operation expenses increased by 5.5 percent, 
clothing, education and recreation expenses went up by 2.7 
percent. Prices for other goods and services increased by an 
average of 2.5 percent. 
  Inflation slowed down considerably during the first four 
months of this year, as compared to last year. Inflation 
reached 25 percent in April last year, the overall rate of 
inflation in 1993 was 188.7 percent. 
  But experts suppose that inflation will jump again because 
of 
the value-added tax that came into effect May 1.

  [Text] Tallinn, 7 May, BNS -- Laar said Estonia would like 
to follow the "Lithuanian model" in pulling out Russian troops 
and does not intend to make concessions like those Latvia agreed 
upon, Estonian Prime Minister said Saturday [7 May] in an 
interview. 
  Lithuania and Russia signed in 1992 a protocol and a 
timetable for troop withdrawal, but did not conclude any 
framework agreement to regulate the issue. 
  "The Estonian Government doesn't intend to make any 
concessions to Russia," Laar emphasized in the interview with 
BNS. 
  In the premier's view, Russia's failure to propose a date 
for 
the next round of talks in essence means suspension of the 
negotiations. 
  "We are ready for talks and prepared to discuss all 
questions 
in a constructive spirit," Laar told BNS. 
  The prime minister said the withdrawal of Russian troops has 
come to a virtual standstill in recent months and that about 
2,500 troops still remain in Estonia. 
  The prime minister claimed Russia lacks the slightest wish 
to 
reach agreement and sign the prepared troop withdrawal accord. 
  Vasily Svirin, Russia's top negotiator, declared after the 
end of the latest round of talks that Russia will sign the 
agreement on the troop pullout only in a package with the accord 
on social guarantees for military retirees. He referred to the 
respective Latvian-Russian agreements initialed on 30 April.

  [Text] Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar has instructed the 
Foreign Ministry to demand from the Russian Foreign Ministry 
clarification concerning Defense Minister Pavel Grachev's 6 May 
anti-Estonian statement. The prime minister hopes that the 
Russian defense minister's statement represents his personal 
stance and not the official standpoint of Russia. The Estonian 
prime minister expressed hope that the Russian Foreign Ministry 
will refute Grachev's irresponsible and (?tension-creating) 
statement. In Mart Laar's opinion, the statement by the Russian 
minister of defense may increase (?a dangerous threat) to 
Estonian independence and sovereignty.

<F P=106> [From 7, 9 May EESTI SENUMID, P.EVALEHT, p. 1; "News </F>
Bulletin" No. 88/94] 
  [Text] President Lennart Meri interrupted his visit to 
Portugal and returned a day sooner than planned because of the 
statement by Russian Defence Minister Pavel Gratchev. 
  Gratchev announced in Moscow on Friday [6 May] that Russia 
may keep its troops in Estonia indefinitely unless the issue of 
the retired military be settled according to Russia's demands. 
He added that the forces could be increased "in order to 
protect military sites in Estonia." 
  Head of the Russian negotiations delegation Vasili Svirin 
declined from commenting the minister's threats. He had earlier 
assured that the troops stationed in Estonia will not be 
reinforced. 
  President Meri attended an international meeting in Arrabida 
near Lisbon, dedicated to the prevention of conflicts by the UN 
and the NATO. "A threat by one UN member state to use military 
force against another member -- Estonia -- is a serious matter. 
For that reason I interrupted my visit, hurried back and 
discussed the ways of countering the threat on Saturday 
evening," Meri said in his speech held on Mother's Day. 
  Tendencies of increasing reliance on force and attempts of 
realisation of the "near abroad" policy are evident in Russia's 
policy, Foreign Ministry Vice Chancellor Raul Malk commented the 
Russian defence minister's threats. Malk pointed out that the 
Gratchev statement contradicts the CSCE and the UN documents on 
the troops withdrawal from Estonia. "The Gratchev statement is a 
direct challenge to the authority of international demands. The 
Russian defence minister's threats of stopping the military 
withdrawal and reinforcement of present troops prove Moscow's 
increasing attempts to force its will on other states and 
international organisations," Malk commented. 
  He also stressed the fact that Gratchev made his statement 
while the negotiations were still going on. This can be 
understood as a way of exerting pressure on Estonia, as well as 
a Russian decision to give up negotiations, Malk said. 
  The states which remain indifferent witnesses of the 
tendencies in Russian politics will accept a grave 
responsibility, the vice-chancellor warned.

<F P=106> [From 10 May RAHVA HAAL, p.1; "News Bulletin" No. 89] </F>
  [Text] An unnamed official is quoted as claiming that the 
hasty return of President Lennart Meri was caused by an alert to 
the Defence Forces declared by Commander in Chief General 
Aleksander Einseln in connection with the statement by Russian 
Defence Minister Grachev. The same source claimed that the 
alert was later renamed regular training exercise. 
  Chief of the GHQ Colonel Arvo Sirel rejected the claims, 
declaring that the Defence Forces had held a regular exercise on 
Saturday [7 May] night in order to train the deployment of 
officers. There was no alert, he stressed, explaining that the 
GHQ has a practice of holding such sudden checkups of deployment 
every month. The date for Saturday's exercise had been agreed 
upon last December, the colonel said. 
  Russia had also reported the violation of its airspace by an 
Estonian aircraft. The Border Guard Department denied having 
alerted its forces at that time, but Director General Tarmo 
Kduts admitted the exercise and a flight of a Border Guard 
patrol aircraft. "Our aircraft did fly during the exercise, but 
in Estonian airspace. I do not know what aircraft the Russians 
are speaking about," he said. 
  Government spokesman Ain Saarna claimed to have no 
information about an alert or exercise. "I cannot comment it, 
this is a matter of the Defence Forces," he said.

ambassador to the Estonian Republic, and requested an official 
explanation concerning the statement by Russian Defense Minister 
Pavel Grachev, according to which the defense minister does not 
consider himself bound to the withdrawal of Russian armed forces 
by 31 August, but deems it possible to bring additional Russian 
armed forces into Estonia. 
  President Lennart Meri emphasized that Estonia will continue 
to strive for relations between Estonia and Russia to be 
correct, good-neighborly, and trustworthy, which has been and 
will remain the aim of Estonia's foreign policy. 
  The ambassador promised to obtain a speedy clarification, as 
demanded. 
  This report was released by the press service of the 
chancellery of the president.

  [Text] Tallinn, 7 May, BNS -- A deepening tendency to 
arm-twisting and attempts to implement the "near abroad" concept 
are becoming apparent in Russia, Deputy Chancellor of the 
Estonian Foreign Ministry Raul Malk said in a comment on the 
statement Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev made on Friday 
[6 May]. 
  Grachev told reporters in Moscow Friday that 2,500 Russian 
troops will remain in Estonia until the problem of Russian 
military retirees is solved. The minister also declared Russia 
may bring additional troops into the Baltic country to defend 
its military facilities there. 
  In Malk's opinion, Grachev's statement clearly conflicts 
with 
the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and the 
United Nations documents about the withdrawal of Russian troops 
from the Baltic states. 
  "Grachev's statement is a direct challenge to the authority 
of international requirements. By threatening Estonia with 
stopping the troop pullout and bringing in more military, the 
Russian defense minister verified Moscow's strengthening 
attempts to force its will on other states and international 
organizations," Malk told BNS. 
  Malk attached great importance to Grachev's timing of his 
remarks to coincide with the 19th round of Estonian-Russian 
troop withdrawal talks. 
  "It can be regarded as an attempt on Russia's part to 
pressurize Estonia to make concessions. On the other hand, the 
statement of the Russian defense minister can be considered as 
giving up ironing out problems through negotiation," Malk said. 
  The Foreign Ministry deputy chancellor expressed the opinion 
that the states, which observe without protest the growth of 
power policy tendencies in Russia, assume a "heavy 
responsibility."

<F P=106> ["Immediate release" from the Estonian Ministry of Foreign </F>
Affairs in Tallinn dated 6 May: "Estonian-Russian Talks Round 
Ends in Stalemate; Russians Refuse To Put August 31 Date Back 
Into Agreement, Continue Demands" -- received via Internet 
E-LIST] 
  [Text] The 19th round of Estonian-Russian troop withdrawal 
negotiations held on 5-6 May at Lohusalu near Tallinn ended in 
another stalemate today with both sides sticking to their 
positions. During this round the two sides did not discuss the 
general agreement at all. 
  At the post-talks press conference in Tallinn, Russian 
negotiator Vasiliy Svirin stated that no further troops will be 
brought to Estonia, but refused to comment on press reports that 
today in Moscow Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev 
threatened to do just that. 
  Although the general agreement has been ready for initialing 
since March, the Russian side refuses to reinsert the clause 
referring to the already agreed-upon final withdrawal date, 31 
August 1994. Despite an international obligation to withdraw 
"unconditionally," Russia continues to demand Estonian 
compliance with substantial conditions. Specifically, Russia 
has refused to initial the agreement until Estonia agrees 1) to 
pay $23 million to the Government of Russia and 2) to initial an 
agreement on pensioned military officers. 
  Although troop withdrawal cannot be linked to any other 
issues, including social guarantees for demobilized Russian 
military personnel, Estonia has continued negotiating in good 
faith. Unfortunately, the Russian side has gone beyond demanding 
Estonian residency for former Red Army troops. They state that 
Estonia must give these individuals special treatment and 
privileges over those enjoyed by Estonian citizens. Although 
years served in the Soviet Armed Forces do not count as working 
years for privatization purposes even for Estonian citizens, the 
Russian side says that years spent in the Red Army must be 
counted for their military pensioners. This demand is 
particularly egregious as the Red Army was the basic instrument 
for repression of civil liberties and human rights in Eastern 
Europe. 
  In a further setback, the Russian side declared that the 
defuelling of the nuclear reactors at Paldiski Training Center 
cannot be started before a detailed agreement is signed 
legalizing the presence of some 200 military personnel there 
plus their families until the end of the century. 
  Some progress was made in the humanitarian and border issues 
group. The next round will be in Moscow, but the Russian side 
failed to name a date, proposing that the working groups meet in 
between rounds.

  [Text] "If Russia has declared a psychological war against 
Estonia, the whole nation has to be included in a fight against 
Russia that has violated international agreements," MP [member 
of parliament] Vardo Rumessen told the parliament on Monday [9 
May]. Rumessen said that Russia was deliberately dragging on 
the inter-state negotiations to gain time. He said that 
Riigikogu [parliament] foreign committee should initiate a bill 
in connection with Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev's 
threat to bring more troops to Estonia, in which Riigikogu 
should present a categorical demand to withdraw Russian troops 
from Estonia by 31 August 1994. Rumessen, a representative of 
Estonian National Independence Party, also called for all people 
who cared about the future of their homeland to organise protest 
actions against the continued presence of Russian troops in 
Estonia.

  [Text] Estonian President Lennart Meri who Monday [9 May] 
night hosted a reception to honour Poland's President Lech 
Walesa and Mrs. Danuta Walesa said the countries shared a bitter 
experience brought about by the 1939 pact between Nazi Germany 
and communist Soviet Union and later agreements between the 
allies and had the responsibility before Europe to avoid history 
repeating itself. 
  "The historic experience of our people and us both springs 
up 
from the same soil: both reborn Poland and reborn Estonia are 
the children of Munich, the Hitler-Stalin pact, Tehran and 
Yalta," Meri said. 
  Meri said that this experience obliges the countries to 
think 
and act for Europe even if Europe neglects or does not know how 
to look into the past in order to understand the future. "Our 
experience must become European conscience," Meri said. 
  Meri said that the paradox in Western democracy lies in the 
fact that it cannot defend itself before it is too late although 
democracy cannot ever be fatally late, but the price to be paid 
later must be paid with blood and suffering. 
  Meri also touched upon Estonian-Russian relations saying 
Russia must show in action that it has cut through its ties with 
the defunct Soviet Union and that it is looking for its place in 
the world respecting the principles of international law. 
  "Estonia cannot put up with the recent situation where one 
UN 
member country threatens another UN member country with military 
measures in order to achieve political goals," Meri said on 
referring to a statement made on Friday by the Russian Defence 
Minister, Pavel Grachev, on considering increasing its military 
presence in Estonia if it felt the rights of ethnic Russians 
were not protected. 
  Estonia remains the only Baltic state with whom Russia has 
no 
formal agreement on troop withdrawal. 
  President Lennart Meri on Saturday interrupted his visit to 
Portugal to return to Estonia and discuss the situation. On 
Monday, he asked Russia's ambassador Aleksandr Trofimov to 
explain the statement of his Defence Minister.

  [Excerpts] Poland's President Lech Walesa met Estonian 
President Lennart Meri, Prime Minister Mart Laar and Riigikogu's 
[parliament] speaker Ulo Nugis during his two-day visit to 
Estonia. 
  Monday [9 May] at noon, Estonia and Poland concluded an 
agreement on avoiding double income and capital taxation. 
[passage omitted] 
  Estonian-Polish cooperation must cover all fields, from 
national security to education, President Lennart Meri told an 
improvised news conference on Monday 
  Walesa said Poland had several ideas on how to promote 
inter-state cooperation. "I am sure that my current visit will 
contribute to promoting bilateral relations and that our 
countries will only gain from it, also in the material sense," 
he said. 
  Commenting on Polish-Russian relations, Walesa said that 
civilised and democratic Russia could be a good partner to 
Poland in case it respected the same values Poland did. "As 
Poland's President I can say that I will not allow to set the 
Russian yoke on Poland again," Walesa said. 
  Both Meri and Walesa agreed Kaliningrad would be a good 
economic asset for the Baltic Sea region while it remains a 
serious source of problems as a military stronghold. 
  Laar said Estonia and Poland will in near future sign a free 
trade agreement. "Poland's President would have been willing to 
sign it at once," Laar said while adding that Estonia would set 
up an embassy in Warsaw very soon. 
  Poland's president also visited Estonia's parliament and met 
its speaker, Ulo Nugis. Nugis and Walesa also discussed the 
situation of ethnic minorities in Estonia. [passage omitted]

  [Text] A declaration of collaboration in developing a 
European security system, creating a climate for wider economic 
cooperation, and support for the idea of building a Via Baltica 
highway -- these are the most important results of the talks 
held by President Lech Walesa on the first day of his official 
visit to Estonia. Lech Walesa talked to Estonia's President 
Lennart Meri, Prime Minister Mart Laar, and Parliamentary 
Chairman Ulo Nugis. 
  The president said that it is ever more clearly visible that 
Europe is becoming a united states of Europe. That is why, he 
said, we have to create it together. 
  Referring to the withdrawal of Russian troops from Estonia, 
on whose territory there are 2,500 servicemen, Lech Walesa 
stressed that maintaining troops on foreign territory is not 
only inconvenient, but also illogical. However, he noted that 
we must show understanding for Russia, which is constantly 
withdrawing its soldiers, and for its leaders, who has to 
explain this to the Russian public. 
  In the presence of the presidents of Poland and Estonia, the 
two countries' deputy foreign affairs ministers signed an 
agreement on avoiding double taxation. 
  During a meeting with Poles living in Estonia, President 
Walesa said he would probably have to stand in the presidential 
elections. 
  Everything indicates that I shall have to stand, said Lech 
Walesa, because, as he put it, the job is not yet done and much 
work remains to be done in Poland. I feel sorry for Poland, the 
president added, and I do not want to waste the achievements of 
the last few years. 
  Poles resident in Estonia told the president about their 
problems; about a shortage of text books for learning Polish, 
and about difficulties in communication between the two 
countries. One of the participants in the meeting, a former 
Home Army soldier, recalled Solidarity achievements in the 
struggle for an independent Poland and persecution under martial 
law. President Lech Walesa said the situation has changed since 
then. He added that today Solidarity is first and foremost a 
trade union. He emphasized that the split which has taken place 
in Solidarity was necessary because a new political stage is 
being constructed. Pluralism must reign in Poland, he added. 
  The president also expressed the hope that his visit would 
contribute toward stimulating economic contacts between the two 
countries. According to him, so far both countries have not 
done enough toward this.

<F P=106> ["Remarks" by Estonian Foreign Minister Juri Luik at the </F>
meeting of defense and foreign ministers of Western European 
Union member states in Luxembourg on 9 May -- received via 
Internet E-LIST] 
  [Text] Esteemed Colleagues, Ladies and Gentlemen, 
  It is truly a pleasure to take part in today's historic 
meeting called to inaugurate the enhanced position of nine 
states from Consultation Partner to Association Partner status 
in the WEU [Western European Union]. Estonia warmly welcomes 
this step as a clear political signal that these nine states are 
regarded as having the best chance of eventual membership in the 
European Union. 
  At the same time, the new enhanced status being celebrated 
here today attests to the common values that we, the nine new 
Association Partners, share with the WEU member states. It is 
these shared values that constitute a common point of departure 
for European integration on all levels and in all phases of 
life, including defence policy. Estonia takes great pride in 
being part of a group dedicated not to old ideas, such as the 
reassertion of empire, but rather to the goals of building a 
stable Europe based on consensus and democracy. 
  As Association Partners, we will seek to take an active role 
in helping construct the new structures of European security. 
We would hope to participate as fully as possible in 
discussions held in the WEU, and through these discussions, to 
integrate our policies with the European Union's Common Foreign 
and Security Policy. 
  We regard the WEU's decision to extend Association Partner 
status simultaneously to the "Group of Nine" seated here today 
as showing great foresight. This move is consistent with the 
WEU's earlier decision to invite these nine states to be 
Consultation Forum members at the same time in the Summer of 
1992. 
  Since that time, the international political arena has 
changed significantly. For instance, all of us new Association 
Partners have joined NATO's Partnership for Peace [PfP] program. 
In the meantime, other states have begun speaking of 
condominium [as received] arrangements for assuring the security 
of Europe, as Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev did last 
Saturday [7 May] when he rejected PfP, saying that it did not 
suit Russia. In bidding for a special relationship with NATO, 
which Mr. Kozyrev has referred to as "a real partnership," the 
Russian Federation has taken upon itself to dictate the content 
of the PfP program for the other, more ordinary partners. This 
claim to special status threatens to stymie the ability of other 
states to realize their full potential under PfP. Given this 
sort of argumentation coming from Moscow, we are all the more 
gratified by the WEU's decision to extend nine states enhanced 
status. This move demonstrates the WEU's singular understanding 
that we cannot and should not draw borders in today's Europe, 
especially not borders that could once again become curtains 
wrought of iron. 
  I would turn now to an issue that is not only of vital 
importance to us but which also has become a touchstone of 
European security, namely troop withdrawals from Estonia. As 
you are all aware, our negotiations with the Russia Federation 
have come to a virtual standstill. During the more than two 
years that we have been negotiating with Russia, Estonia has put 
forth constructive proposal after proposal, which have been 
regularly and systematically rejected by the Russian side. Our 
agreement on troop withdrawals has been ready for signing since 
the beginning of March, but Russia continues to delay, 
re-opening discussion of questions that were resolved long ago. 
  Furthermore, in violation of obligations it has incurred in 
various international fora to pull the troops out in an "early, 
orderly, and unconditional" fashion, Russia continues to link 
withdrawal to other issues, primarily to so-called social 
guarantees for retired and demobilized military officers. While 
we have rejected this linkage from the start, we understand that 
Russia needs an agreement on these reserve officers, and for 
this reason have continued negotiating in good faith. Still, 
despite our best efforts, Russia continues to insist on special 
privileges for these officers, privileges above and beyond those 
rights our own citizens enjoy. 
  As you have surely heard, during our 19th round of 
negotiations, which ended last Friday near Tallinn, the Russian 
side failed to name a date for the next round of talks. 
Instead, the Russian negotiating team said a subsequent round 
would not be held until Estonia tables sufficiently constructive 
proposals as to justify holding a round. In effect, this means 
that Russia has suspended talks until Estonia gives in to its 
demands, which include, among other things, that Estonia change 
its internal legislation. Not only does this stance suggest 
that Russia has an interesting view of what compromise and 
negotiation should entail, it also suggests a rather bizarre 
concept of sovereignty. 
  And as if this ultimatum-style approach were not enough, 
last 
Friday, the same day as our negotiations ended, Russian Defence 
Minister Pavel Grachev told reporters in Moscow that if Estonia 
does not meet all of Russia's demands, Russia may not withdraw 
the troops at all, but rather may boost the military presence in 
my country. The fact that Grachev, representing one UN member 
state, threatened to invade another UN member state, at the very 
same time as withdrawal talks were going on, is unacceptable if 
not ludicrous. We are certain that the international community 
will not remain silent, but will give its clear, unmistakable, 
and public appraisal of this open intimidation. 
  I would stress here that Estonia attaches particular 
importance to participation in the political and security 
consultation mechanisms foreseen for the Association Members of 
the WEU. We are eager, for instance, to establish a liaison 
arrangement with the Planning Cell and to become involved in 
WEU-led humanitarian and rescue tasks as well as tasks of combat 
forces in crisis management. Another area of special interest to 
us is peacekeeping. As you know, along with our Latvian and 
Lithuanian colleagues, we have established a joint Baltic 
Peacekeeping Battalion. We hope to offer our joint battalion to 
the WEU for peacekeeping operations, and look forward to being 
involved in the command structures and decisionmaking processes 
that will accompany these future operations. 
  I would conclude my remarks by once again drawing your 
attention to the historic nature of our meeting here in 
Luxembourg today. Today's WEU meeting holds the same importance 
for us as did the NATO summit last January. Both 
meetings--January in Brussels and May in Luxembourg--will be 
seen by historians as marking the ascent to an entirely new 
plateau in European security. Through these meetings, Estonia 
has taken a small step toward full integration in European 
security structures. But for all of us gathered here, today's 
meeting represents a giant leap toward creating a new European 
Defence Identity. 
  Thank you.

  [Text] Tallinn, 9 May, BNS -- Paying little attention to 
publicity rather than political failure is the reason behind Pro 
Patria's declining approval figures in opinion polls, says Tiit 
Sinissaar, the chairman of the ruling coalition's senior party 
faction in the Estonian parliament. 
  According to the outcome of the latest poll by the EMOR 
agency, Pro Patria's support among voters has fallen under the 
critical 5 percent. 
  "Pro Patria has been attacked and accused from all 
directions 
and our biggest mistake is that we haven't had time beside other 
things to make publicity for our actions," Sinissaar told BNS. 
  He also said it was natural that the political party that is 
in power would lose popularity among voters. When the standard 
of living increased last fall, also the people's expectations 
began to be higher than what was actually possible, he said. 
  "Pro Patria has conducted a thorough analysis of these 
factors," Sinissaar said. "Our forecast is that the economic 
situation, and, arising from this, also the social situation 
will start to improve in Estonia in the near future," he said. 
  He added that the party has learned its lesson from the 
recent developments and is now set to better explain the 
background and aims of its activity. 
  As a first example of this, Sinissaar and Prime Minister 
Mart 
Laar wrote an article that was published in today's edition of 
the HOMMIKULEHT daily newspaper. 
  Sinissaar said he believes that the party's approval ratings 
will be on the increase soon, because "everything that the 
coalition has done in the past year and a half starts to give 
tangible results namely now."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sevindzh Abdullayeva, Viktor </F>
Shulman] 
  [Text] Baku, 9 May--At a news conference today, Russian 
Federation special envoy Vladimir Kazimirov set out Russia's 
conceptual approaches to settling the Armenian-Azerbaijani 
conflict and eliminating its consequences. The diplomat 
explained the need for the news conference by a desire to 
clarify the main points of a Russian draft plan for settling the 
armed conflict in order to dispel conjectures surrounding it. 
  In connection with this, Kazimirov stressed with regret that 
some commentators on the draft had been trying to accuse Russia 
of "a striving to implement its imperial ambitions" and "an 
obvious preference for a particular side." According to him, 
this is being done in order to discredit Russian policy in the 
region. On the other hand, he noted, certain forces understand 
that if the conflict is settled with Russia's active 
involvement, this will strengthen Russia's influence in the 
Transcaucasus, something they obviously dislike. 
  According to the diplomat, his country is pursuing the only 
goal of establishing good and efficient relations with 
Azerbaijan and Armenia. He specifically stressed that "a bias 
toward either side would be Russia's historical miscalculation, 
something it cannot afford." 
  Touching upon the much talked about issue of Russia's 
striving to station its troops in Azerbaijan under the guise of 
peacekeeping forces, the special envoy noted that "even earlier 
his country offered to bring disengagement forces into the 
region, believing this form to be the most efficient one for 
resolving the conflict." However, Kazimirov said, the 
institution of international observers cannot be efficient in 
this case, in the absence of a stable cease-fire and an end of 
hostilities. 
  According to the Russian ambassador, consensus between the 
sides has been attained to date, perhaps in the view that the 
conflict cannot be settled in one step and should be resolved 
stage-by-stage. The Russian draft plan, which consists of three 
principal stages, Kazimirov said, is based on precisely this 
premise. The first stage includes a reliably secured cease-fire 
and an end to hostilities and should take six days to achieve, 
including the disengagement of forces. The second stage 
envisages withdrawal from all the occupied territories (except 
Shusha and Lachin), a quick exchange of prisoners and hostages, 
the restoration of communications, and the return of refugees to 
their native land. The draft assigns 34 days to complete all 
this. 
  The issue of freeing Shusha and Lachin will be examined 
separately two weeks after cease-fire is established. The third 
stage is for negotiations to study the issue of Nagornyy 
Karabakh's [Nagorno-Karabakh's] status. 
  At the same time, Kazimirov did not rule out a possibility 
of 
the second and third stages taking considerably more time than 
envisaged, for "this is a very complicated process."

<F P=106> [Viktor Litovkin report: "Until Black Sea Fleet Is Divided </F>
Up, War of Nerves Continues"] 
  [Text] News agency reports are often like a psychological 
machinegun burst. It is sometimes even terrifying to take hold 
of them since you suddenly have another bomb on your hands. 
  Our correspondent in the Crimea had not had time to tell us 
of a provocative report on an allegedly political attack on the 
wife of the commander of the Black Sea Fleet before the 
editorial office received another similar report from ITAR-TASS. 
From the Ukrainian Defense Ministry's press service. They 
accuse their Russian colleagues of "preparing to hijack to 
Russia missile-carrying Tu-22 aircraft from Black Sea Fleet air 
force regiments." 
  Ukraine claims that it is planned to make this flight 
against 
the backdrop of routine tactical air exercises I called one of 
the leaders of the Navy's air forces and asked: Is this true? 
The general was indignant: "It's out-and-out lies." And he 
complained that pilots are not being allowed to fly because of 
these persistent suspicions for which there is incidentally no 
documentary corroboration. And a pilot, even a top-notch pilot, 
who has spent a month or two on the ground, is no longer a 
pilot, but at best a trainee. Well, he asked sadly, have people 
now lost the right to a profession, to earn a crust, owing to 
the political wrangling? 
  I had just cleared up the situation involving the aircraft 
when television announced: Army General Vitaliy Radetskyy, 
Ukrainian defense minister, has banned Admiral Igor Kasatonov, 
first deputy commander in chief of the Navy, from flying to 
Sevastopol to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the city's 
liberation from the fascist occupiers, a ceremony to which the 
Russian admiral was invited by 20 organizations in Sevastopol. 
  I contacted the admiral's aides. They confirmed that this 
had happened -- Kasatonov stayed in Moscow while Vice Admiral 
Ivan Vasilyev, Navy deputy commander for rear services, had to 
fly to Sevastopol. His candidacy caused no particular 
objections in Kiev's military-ministerial circles. 
  Admittedly, the fax machine has "fired" another mind-blowing 
charge -- an open letter from his former fellow servicemen in 
the Northern Fleet -- at another admiral, this time a Ukrainian: 
Volodymyr Beskorovaynyy, commander of that country's Navy. What 
epithets the admirals and captains first and second rank 
directed at him. I cannot cite them -- the paper would not 
withstand it. And all because Beskorovaynyy behaved unworthily, 
according to the men of the Northern Fleet, during the conflict 
with the Cheleken hydrographic ship. 
  Not only is it surprising that the open letter carries 30 
signatures and names with posts ranging from deputy commander of 
a formation of nuclear submarines to the commander of an 
individual unit -- a few years ago you would have been flung in 
jail for that kind of list -- but also that undoubtedly worthy 
people hope that appeals of this kind today can stop a 
particular political action. 
  I do not want to accuse anyone, much less defend anyone. I 
just want one thing -- a truce in this war of nerves and 
mind-blowing information. I realize that it is pointless urging 
politicians to behave nobly, but perhaps journalists can do so 
by declaring a moratorium on reports that cause political 
explosions.

  [Text] A delegation of the Serbian Civic Council is 
visiting Moscow. Heading the delegation is Mirko Pejanovic, 
member of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency and chairman of the 
council. Vlastimir Mijovic has the details: 
  [Begin Mijovic recording] The main goal of the Serbian Civic 
Council delegation is to acquaint Russian officials with the 
real situation in which the Serbian people of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
have found themselves. So far, Moscow has only been visited by 
representatives of the group that rejected the idea of a united 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and with arms and crimes tried to draw (word 
indistinct] ethnic borders. Through grave manipulations and 
disinformation, the impression has been created in Russia that 
all Bosnian Serbs support such an option (?embodied) in 
Karadzic's (policy). 
  In the scheduled talks, the delegation headed by Mirko 
Pejanovic will try to acquaint Russian officials with the 
concept that the Serbian Civic Council advocates, which is the 
survival of the Serbian population that is true to joint life 
and a united state. 
  Our delegation will be received tomorrow by Vladimir Lukin, 
chairman of the Foreign Committee of the Russian Duma and a very 
influential person of Russian foreign policy. The delegation 
will later meet with members of the Foreign Committee and 
representatives of all parliamentary groups. It is still not 
known whether our delegation will attend the parliamentary 
debate on the Bosnian crisis initiated in the Duma. The Duma 
leadership has still not decided whether it will hold an open 
debate or behind closed doors. If the session is open, our 
representatives will also be given an opportunity to speak. 
  In the next two days, the Serbian Civic Council delegation 
will hold talks at the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 
will also visit the patriarchy of the Russian Orthodox Church. 
Its main task is to present the situation in which the Bosnian 
Serbs have found themselves, as well as the overall political 
views of the government in Sarajevo. 
  As Mirko Pejanovic and Miro Lazovic have told us, they are 
going to convey an official invitation to Boris Yeltsin to visit 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. They will also try to arrange a visit by a 
high-level Bosnia-Herzegovina delegation to Russia. In any 
case, through the representatives of the Serbian Civic Council, 
Russian top politicians will have an opportunity to learn about 
another option that is entirely opposite to the one on the 
Serbian issue that representatives of [word indistinct] the 
Belgrade authorities have been presenting to them. 
  It is difficult to expect a major advance overnight, but it 
is certain that this visit will contribute to Russian circles 
attaining a better view of the Bosnian crisis. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Boris Pilyatskin report: "Russia Has To Make Friends With </F>
USSR's Old Friends. Nelson Mandela Will Become RSA's First 
Black President 10 May"] 
  [Excerpts] Work is being completed on a dais enclosed by 
three layers of bulletproof glass in front of the massive 
government building in Pretoria. The official inauguration of 
the Republic of South Africa's new president, Nelson Mandela, 
will take place here Tuesday 10 May. [passage omitted] 
  Russia will not be represented even by the premier. 
Admittedly, Russia's Foreign Ministry has issued a statement 
expressing a "sense of profound satisfaction" at the restoration 
of racial and social justice in the RSA and voicing hope for the 
further development of the good relations that have taken shape 
between our countries. It is, however, appropriate to note that 
these relations have taken shape only over the last two and a 
half years, while previously the USSR and the RSA were separated 
by a thick curtain of mutual hostility and enmity. 
  However, there were long-standing friendly ties between the 
CPSU Central Committee and the ANC and in particular with the 
Communist Party, which was considered one of the most dogmatic 
and obedient to Moscow in the world communist movement. Money 
and weapons passed down secret channels at Soviet taxpayers' 
expense for the "liberation struggle" in South Africa. Groups 
of gunmen were trained on USSR territory. Perestroyka put an 
end to all that. And when reforms began in the RSA as well, 
links with the "friends" were put on ice. 
  At the start of the breakup of the USSR the then Soviet 
leadership just did not care about the RSA. The Kremlin forgot 
to telephone Mandela when he came out of jail. U.S. President 
George Bush's telephone call of congratulations was virtually 
the first. The ANC leader's trip to Moscow failed to take place 
five times. The invitation from Mikhail Gorbachev was either 
awkwardly sent at a time when it was known that Mandela was 
leaving on another foreign trip or Moscow refused to host the 
South African visitor owing to internal disarray. 
  It is to Mandela's credit that he never made digs at the 
former "luminary of socialism." He only remarked when he was 
given the Nobel Peace Prize last year that the only country that 
has always helped the ANC is Norway. On the other hand South 
Africa's Communists abused Gorbachev roundly, in August 1991 
they congratulated the putschists, and they blatantly expressed 
solidarity with the Supreme Soviet in its opposition to Russia's 
president. The ANC and the Communist Party in unison with 
Russia's Communists protested the establishment of diplomatic 
relations with the RSA and President De Klerk's visit [to 
Russia]. 
  Now that the ANC has come to power Moscow has to organize 
relations from scratch. I do not think that South African 
Communists, influential within the ANC leadership, will change 
their views of the democratic transformations within Russia. 
But one can hope for pragmatism from the new RSA president.

<F P=106> [Ibrahim Humaydi report: "Russian Diplomatic Sources Deny </F>
Agreement With Syria on Debts Question"] 
  [Text] Damascus -- Russian diplomatic sources have 
confirmed to AL-HAYAH that the negotiations between Russia and 
Syria are still continuing in order to secure a mechanism 
guaranteeing a practical solution to the debts issue, the 
"obstacle" that has hampered the development of Russian-Syrian 
relations in recent years. 
  The sources said that technical experts from the two 
countries will meet shortly to agree on the method of paying 
Syria's military debts, which total some $11 billion. This sum 
includes overdue payments totaling $1.5 billion owed to the 
former Soviet Union for weapons exported to Damascus. 
  The sources went on to say that, "despite the two sides' 
agreement during the meeting early last month between Deputy 
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and President Hafiz al-Asad on the 
principle of solving the problem, the two sides still have not 
solved it." The sources said: "We need tireless negotiations." 
  Regarding the claim that Moscow has agreed to write off 
about 
90 percent of the debts, the diplomatic sources said that "it is 
not an agreement. It was an offer made during the 
negotiations." The sources pointed out that the "Syrians wanted 
to pay about 8 percent of the debts in Syrian pounds or local 
commodities, but the Russians insisted that the Syrians make 20 
percent of every payment in foreign currency." The sources said 
that the talks "are continuing between us and our friends in 
Damascus." In a statement to AL-HAYAH well informed Russian 
sources expected an agreement to be reached on writing off about 
75 percent of the Russian debts, provided Syria pays the 
remaining 25 percent and the value of the deals between the two 
countries "in hard currency and immediately." 
  The sources commended the military and trade agreements 
signed recently in Damascus during Deputy Prime Minister Oleg 
Soskovets' visit to the Syrian capital. The agreements provide 
for exporting spare parts for Syria's Russian weapons and Syrian 
factories. They also provide for Russian companies' 
participation in international tenders announced by Syrian 
public establishments, as well as participation in extracting 
Syrian phosphate. 
  The Russian sources described what has been reached so far 
as 
"an achievement" compared with the situation a few years ago. 
They pointed out that "the differences were big" between the 
two sides with regard to resolving the debts issue. The Syrians 
linked it with the political role played by the former Soviet 
Union and with whether Russia is its heir. 
  The sources said that the two sides have now agreed to solve 
the issue. They have also agreed that the Russian Federation is 
the heir of the Soviet state. They have agreed on separating 
the debts question from the other questions and from the 
political role Moscow is seeking to play in the peace process. 
The sources said that the CIS' agreement on its share in the 
Soviet Union's legacy has contributed to reaching an 
understanding with the Syrians. 
  As for the Russian initiative to convene a "Madrid-2" and 
the 
active Russian role in the peace process, the sources said that 
Moscow is seeking "to compete with Washington in the peace 
negotiations." They said that the Russian role is leading to a 
balance, and "any balance is not going to hamper the peace 
process or cause any party to adopt a hard line. On the 
contrary, it will give the parties self-confidence and enable 
them to take courageous decisions."

  [Text] The current situation on the Korean peninsula can 
be compared to continuous cloudy weather. It is not the time to 
repeat the causes for the aggravating situation on the Korean 
peninsula and tension in Northeast Asia. However, we could 
derive a series of conclusions from the current situation. 
  First, the International Atomic Energy Agency's [IAEA] 
pressure on the DPRK to accept full-scope inspections [chonmyon 
sachal] of its nuclear objects could not bring about any 
substantial results. On the contrary, it made the other party 
adhere to its position more. The IAEA inspection team keeps 
raising its conditions even though the visas for entering the 
DPRK are in its hands. 
  Regarding this, a recent DPRK statement declared that if the 
IAEA does not withdraw its demand for full-scope inspections, 
the replacement of the fuel rods of the graphite-moderated 
reactor in Yongbyon will be carried on without the participation 
of the agency's inspection team. 
  The threat of imposing international economic sanctions on 
Pyongyang is not working either. 
  Second, the DPRK is demanding a resolution of the nuclear 
issue on the peninsula through DPRK-U.S. talks. Regarding this, 
the United States has raised some conditions for the resumption 
of the talks. Consequently, a resolution is not foreseen yet. 
  Under current circumstances, Moscow has proposed an 
international conference regarding the denuclearization of the 
Korean peninsula. Some countries are supporting the proposal. 
Whether through the DPRK-U.S. talks or an international 
conference, in any case, the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula must be resolved. The sooner the resolution of the 
issue comes, the better. 
  As for the peninsula, tension around the peninsula may rise 
even more leading to an unpredictable result. All must show 
utmost effort and self-control not to turn a quarrel into an 
armed collision.

<F P=106> ["Victory Day" interview with Supreme Council Chairman </F>
Eduard Shevardnadze by Nato Oniani; place not given -- live] 
  [Excerpts] This interview will be shorter than usual 
because today is 9 May, which is Victory Day, and I know that 
you are busy. There are various opinions about this day. Some 
regard it as the day of victory over fascism. But there is also 
the opinion that it was not Georgia's war, the Georgians' war, 
and that we should not have taken part in this war, and so on 
and forth. What is your assessment of what happened 49 years 
ago today? 
  [Shevardnadze] Thank you. First I would like to greet all 
veterans and participants in the war. I know almost all of them 
in person. [passage omitted] 
  Now to that equivocal attitude. I was upset to a certain 
extent over parliament's failure to adopt a resolution 
[reinstituting 9 May as a holiday]. Some deputies have a 
different understanding of the importance of those years, and 
the contribution of the fallen heroes and those who are still 
with us today, toward the struggle for peace in the world. I 
think that people who do not understand this and believe that 
the veterans fought not for Georgia but for the interests of a 
foreign country, and that they served the interests of a 
different system, know little about the matter. [passage omitted] 
  Those who fail to understand that the 300,000 people [from 
Georgia] who, while defending their own country, sacrificed 
themselves for the freedom of other nations, have a very vague 
understanding of the essence and purpose of national movement 
and of the people who truly fought for the interests of this 
movement. 
  Although many might not have realized it at the time, or 
could have realized it subconsciously, the struggle against 
fascism was a struggle for universal ideals. The same universal 
ideals inspired the revolution of the eighties and the beginning 
of the nineties. This revolution gave freedom to nations, to 
Europe and to Georgia. Without victory over fascism, there 
would not have been the revolution of the eighties, the 
liberating revolution which brought about freedom and democracy 
in former Soviet Union republics. This is a logical chain and 
it cannot be denied. I think that people who do not understand 
it have failed to keep abreast of the times. 
  Therefore, by marking 9 May, we are paying our respects to 
the memory of people who sacrificed themselves for the freedom 
of nations and for independence, to those who fought for these 
ideals. 
  Today we talk about building a free and democratic Georgia. 
Without the cornerstone that these people laid by fighting 
against fascism, Georgia would not have gained its independence. 
[passage omitted] 
  Finally, one of the major achievements of those great years 
was the (?emergence) of the United Nations Organization and its 
Security Council. We may not be impressed by the role this 
organization is playing today [word indistinct], but without it 
our planet would not have survived. [Words indistinct] people 
who fought against fascism created a certain guarantee of a 
peaceful life for future generations. [passage omitted]

Melnik] 
  [Text] Kiev May 9 TASS -- "None of my numerous relatives 
returned from the front. The grave of my father was found quite 
recently. He died during the liberation of the fraternal 
Belarussian [Belarusian] nation," Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk said, addressing war veterans who came today to the 
Eternal Glory Park to commemorate those killed during the war 
against Nazi invaders. "There is not a family in Ukraine, the 
same as in all the former USSR republics, which has not been 
affected by the war," he continued. 
  The Ukrainian president and other officials laid flowers at 
the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. The ceremony was attended by 
government members, people's deputies, heads of diplomatic 
missions accredited in Kiev, representatives of political 
parties and movements. 
  Tashkent May 9 TASS -- By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vilor 
Niyazmatov: 
  Uzbekistan, which has a population of 22 million and some 
100 
nationalities, is celebrating the Victory Day today. 
  Every family in the republic was affected by the war in this 
or that way. About one million residents of the republic went 
to the front, and 600,000 of them never returned home. Some 
300,000 were decorated with orders and medals for their feats of 
arms, and 280 of them became heroes of the Soviet Union. 
  Uzbek President Islam Karimov and other officials laid 
wreaths today at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and the eternal 
flame in the Independence Square. After that Karimov and other 
republican leaders went to the Monument to the Mournful Mother. 
It is part of the memorial complex with graves of soldiers from 
numerous cities and villages of the former USSR, who died at 
Tashkent hospitals during the War. 
  Kishinev [Chisinau] May 9 TASS -- By ITAR-TASS correspondent 
Valeriy Demidetskiy: 
  The Victory Day coincided this year with the day of 
commemorating the dead. Before going to cemeteries to visit the 
graves of their relatives, thousands of people came today to the 
Memorial of Glory in order to honour the memory of soldiers, 
killed in the struggle against Nazism. 
  A ceremony of laying wreaths was held at the memorial in the 
morning. Under the accompaniment of the funeral march, wreaths 
and flowers were laid at the eternal flame and soldiers' graves 
by President Mircea Snegur, Chairman of Parliament Petr 
Luchinskiy, Prime Minister Andrey Angeli, representatives of 
foreign diplomatic missions and public organisations. Flowers 
were also laid at the stone where a monument would be built to 
all those killed during the armed conflict in the Dniester 
region. 
  The Victory Day was celebrated today in all the cities and 
villages of Moldavia. 
  Riga May 9 TASS -- A ceremony was held today at the Monument 
to Liberator Soldiers on the occasion of the Victory Day. It is 
the last time it was attended by representatives of the command 
of the North-Western Russian Army Group. In accordance with the 
Russian- Latvian agreements signed recently, Russian troops will 
be withdrawn from Latvia before August 31, this year. 
  War veterans, members of the Socialist Party of Latvia, of 
the Association of Russians and other public organisations 
observed the day of victory over the Nazi Germany in Riga, 
Liepae [Liepaja], Daugavpiels [Daugavpils] and other cities. 
However, official representatives of Latvian authorities did 
not take part in the celebrations. 
  After the proclamation of independence in Latvia, the 
Victory 
Day ceased to be an official holiday there. This year it is the 
third time that May 9 is an ordinary working day. 
  Sevastopol May 9 TASS -- "The Crimea is open to all," 
Crimean 
President Yuriy Meshkov said today, addressing participants in 
the celebration of the Victory Day in Sevastopol. "Today, in 
this sunny day, I congratulate you all on the occasion of the 
victory of our people and express heartfelt gratitude to all 
heroes of the Great Patriotic War irrespecting of whether they 
wore a uniform or not. Hail to our fathers, our mothers, all 
those who survived those times." 
  Dushanbe May 9 TASS -- By ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina 
Gridneva: 
  The Victory Day is being observed in a most festive way in 
Tajikistan. The decree of the Supreme Soviet proclaimed it to 
be a holiday. A mourning meeting, held today at the Victory 
Park of Dushanbe, became the feature event of the ceremony. 
Numerous participants in the rally were addressed by Tajik 
leader Emomali Rakhmonov and other senior officials of the 
republic, heads of embassies and diplomatic missions, 
high-ranking officers, officials from the republican Defence 
Ministry and peace-keeping troops, as well as war veterans. The 
Victory Day is being celebrated in all the cities of the 
republic. 
  Bishkek May 9 TASS -- By ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris 
Maynayev: 
  The Victory Day began here today in the Victory Square with 
a 
trumpet call, which signalled the beginning of a mourning 
meeting, devoted to the 49th anniversary of the victory over 
Nazism. Bishkek residents, Kyrgyz leaders, members of 
parliament, senior officials gathered at the monument to the 
motherland. President Askar Akayev laid flowers at the monument. 
  Alma Ata [Almaty] May 9 TASS -- By KAZTAG correspondent Ivan 
Zakharchenko -- TASS: 
  President Nursultan Nazarbayev laid flowers at the memorial 
complex in one of the Alma Ata parks to mark the 49th 
anniversary of the victory in the Great Patriotic War. 
Thousands of war veterans and residents of the city came there 
to honour the memory of those killed at the front. 
  "This date will always be observed by residents of 
Kazakhstan 
and of all the former USSR republics, because the victory was 
one for all," Nazarbayev said. "Unlike the territory, finances, 
economies, it cannot be divided. The victory was won by joint 
efforts of Russians, Kazakhs, Ukrainians, Belarussians, people 
of other nationalities, who shared both the grief over their 
losses and confidence in the eventual defeat of Nazism." 
  A salute will be fired in the Kazakh capital today.

  [Text] Vilnius, 7 May -- The 49th anniversary of the end of 
the Second World War will not be celebrated officially in 
Lithuania. But war veterans will undoubtedly meet up to recall 
the past and lay wreaths at the graves of their fallen 
comrades-in-arms. 
  The single official gesture related to the event was a 
statement by President Algirdas Brazauskas published today, 
which to all intents puts the occupiers and liberators of 
Lithuania on the same level. The head of state said that 
Lithuania had been occupied more than once and trampled upon by 
more than one occupier during the years of the Second World War. 
  At the same time, the president notes that thousands of 
Lithuania's citizens -- Lithuanians, Russians, Poles, and Jews 
-- had contributed to the joint struggle against Hitler. No one 
has the right to erase them from history, belittle their 
sacrifice, or wipe their names from the national memory.

<F P=106> ["News Release"] </F>
  [Text] Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar, who returned 
from a state visit to France on Thursday [5 May], told a press 
conference at the Tallinn Airport that his talks with French 
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and Foreign Minister Alain Juppe 
centered mainly on one topic -- the as fast as possible 
integration of Estonia to Europe. 
  Laar said that Balladur stressed the need for Estonia to 
conclude, as soon as possible, a free trade agreement with the 
European Union and start negotiations to conclude an associating 
agreement. Together with Foreign Minister Alain Juppe a 
concrete schedule of Estonian integration towards Europe was 
discussed. 
  Laar gave credit in Estonia's quick movement especially to 
France and Germany. 
  Another issue that was discussed at the meetings was the 
current situation of Estonian-Russian relations and Russian 
troop withdrawal from Estonia. Laar said that if there existed 
fear that Estonia was having pressure upon her to conclude 
similar agreements with Russia as Latvia did, this fear was 
unfounded. Laar said that France had offered a possibility for 
Estonian-Russian inter-state negotiations to take place in the 
framework of European stability or the so-called Balladur pact, 
which would "increase the importance of the negotiations and 
help to make clear to Russia that mainly Russia will win from 
the troop withdrawal." 
  Estonian Minister of Economics Toivo Jurgenson, who 
accompanied Laar during the visit, said that Estonian delegation 
had also met high-level economic, banking and employers union 
representatives in France. He said that Estonia got a 
preliminary promise that France will guarantee, in the nearest 
future, middle-term credits for Estonia.

military presence in Estonia that the last Russian troops in 
Estonia "do not leave Estonia through the Narva bridge but

  He said that from the Russian military headquarters premises 
in Tallinn, in front of which the pickets take place, young 
plain clothes Russian military have been continuously seen to 
"absorb" to Tallinn. Kelam added that Estonia must not allow 
such a deception. He said that it was necessary to observe 
movement of people to the premises of Russian military and out 
of them.

  [Text] Russia has proposed a three-stage plan for a 
settlement of the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over 
Nagorno-Karabakh. Vladimir Kazimirov, Russia's 
ambassador-at-large, told journalists in Baku that a cease-fire 
and disengagement of the warring sides are envisaged under the 
first stage, which would last six days. A withdrawal from all 
occupied territories, except for the towns of Shusha and Lachin, 
must take place during the second stage, which would last 34 
days. During this stage there would also be an exchange of 
POW's and refugees, who must return to their homes. Withdrawal 
from Shusha and Lachin will be tackled separately. Finally, the 
status of Nagorno-Karabakh will be examined during the third 
stage of the settlement.

  [Text] Dushanbe, 9 May -- Last night, Russian border guards 
patrolling a sector manned by the Pyanj border detachment 
thwarted an attempt by a group of Tajik opposition guerrillas to 
force their way across the border from Afghanistan. 
  Commenting on this report, Lieutenant General Anatoliy 
Chechulin, commander of Russian border guards in Tajikistan, 
said that recently, the hard-line Tajik opposition, which has 
gone to ground in the northern provinces of the Islamic State of 
Afghanistan, has markedly stepped up its provocative sallies in 
the zone patrolled by the Moskovskiy and Pyanj border 
detachments. During the past week alone Russian border guards 
manning these sectors had thwarted four attempts by small but 
well-armed groups to infiltrate Tajikistan from Afghanistan. 
  The Russian general noted that border guards, using 
artillery, had destroyed all these groups. He also declared 
that Russian border guards would suppress any further 
provocations with all the firepower at their disposal.

"Defense Industry Open to Businessmen"] 
  [Text] An exchange of opinions on the fulfillment of the 
agreements reached in Moscow between the Ukrainian, U.S., and 
Russian presidents on the elimination of the nuclear weapons on 
Ukrainian soil took place between Ukrainian Vice Premier Valeriy 
Shmarov and Nicholas Burns, head of the U.S. economic delegation 
and senior director of the National Security Council. The guest 
was also familiarized with the programs for the conversion of 
Ukraine's defense industry which propose close cooperation with 
U.S. firms. Conversion processes could be considerably 
accelerated by the involvement of small-scale business as the 
most mobile form of entrepreneurship. The U.S. side's attention 
was drawn also to problems of Ukraine's space complex, where 
there is extensive scope for cooperation.

have to cancel its trip to Sevastopol scheduled for 7 May unless 
Ukraine changes its mind and decides to let the delegation's

  The plane would land at Belbek's airport three miles north 
of 
Sevastopol, the main base of the disputed Black Sea Fleet, but 
Ukraine insists that the delegation led by First Deputy Navy

  [Text] Sevastopol, 9 May -- Several thousand people 
gathered in the center of the town on the occasion of Victory 
Day. A Rukh activist in the crowd raised a Ukrainian flag, but 
a group of unknown persons tore it away from him. 
  Activists from the Russian Movement of Crimea [RDK] and the 
Russian Movement of Sevastopol threw eggs at Ukrainian sailors 
and students of the military institute who were marching 
triumphantly along the town's central avenue on the occasion of 
the holiday. 
  In an interview on French television and with local 
journalists, Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov said in part: "A 
normal situation will be preserved in Crimea because this 
completely corresponds to the interests of the people of the 
Republic of Crimea. Everything will be calm here. Economic 
reforms have been put in motion and are progressing. Nobody 
will be able to provoke us from the outside". 
  Asked which status he is requesting for Crimea, he said: "We 
are not requesting. This timescale is not used in relation to a 
people. We are defending our inalienable right to resolve our 
economic problems and to fully serve our own economic interests."

  [Text] The debts of Ukrainian enterprises owed to their 
counterparts in other former USSR countries are rising steeply. 
According to a report by the economy directorate of Ukraine's 
Cabinet of Ministers, credit indebtedness increased by 65.3 
percent in the first two months of this year alone, and was 20.5 
trillion rubles on 1 March 1994. Debit indebtedness increased 
in the first two months of the year by 16.2 percent, and reached 
6.5 trillion rubles on 1 March 1994. In particular, Ukrainian 
enterprises were 5.4 trillion rubles in debt to their trading 
partners in Russia in January-February, and now owe them 15.5 
trillion rubles. (KIYEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI, 7 May 1994)

<F P=106> [Statement by the Press Group of Kiev's Procurator's Office; </F>
"The Boychyshyn Affair: The Search Continues"] 
  [Text] As already reported, on 18 January 1994, the Kiev 
Procurator's Office initiated a criminal case to investigate the 
fact of disappearance of Ukraine's People's Rukh [Movement for 
Perestroyka] Deputy Chairman Mykhaylo Boychyshyn. 
  A day earlier, the Internal Affairs Administration of Kiev's 
Radyanskyy Rayon initiated a criminal case to investigate the 
acts of hooliganism committed by two unknown persons on 15 
January 1994 in the building occupied by Rukh. 
  In the capital, as well as in Lvov and Odessa Oblasts, 
operational investigation groups were created to study all the 
circumstances of the incident. The groups include officials of 
the Procurator's Office, Security Service, and the Militia. 
  The search continues: In Kiev, tens of thousands of 
facilities, in particular, railroads, wooded areas, and water 
reservoirs, were examined. Similar work was conducted in Lvov, 
where the victim previously lived and worked. There, M.I. 
Boychyshyn's [internal] passport was found in a mail-box. The 
investigators' group appeals to those who have found the 
passport with a request to give their particulars to the 
militia. We also ask the person who telephoned Boychyshyn on 15 
January 1994 at 19:40 [local time] to respond. 
  The search is based upon several versions. In particular, in 
connection with his participation in the election campaign, 
financial relations with representatives of business circles, 
possible unlawful acts on the part of criminal groupings, and 
also assumptions made by Stanislav Husak from Minsk (such 
information was spread by RUKH-PRESS on 13 April) on the 
involvement of Russian special services in Boychyshyn's 
disappearance, in view of the fact that the latter intended to 
hold, in Kiev, an international conference on the Balto-Black 
Sea oil reservoir. 
  We once again appeal to all those citizens, who can provide 
any information on the circumstances of Mykhaylo Illyarovych 
Boychyshyn's disappearance, with a request to turn to the 
nearest militia department.

<F P=106> [Article by Kost Chavaha: "Dollars in a Zinc Coffin"] </F>
  [Text] Trains loaded with military equipment painted in 
white crossed the state border yesterday at the city of Chop. 
The second battalion from the Ciscarpathian Military District 
is rushing to reinforce UN peacekeeping forces in Bosnia, more 
precisely, in the hottest spot there -- the Muslim enclave of 
Gorazhde. Our young compatriots, who have given their consent 
to don "blue helmets," have already begun to count the "bucks" 
they will be paid for each day of service. Some of them will 
get $600 per month, while others will be paid $900. For this 
money, not even an unemployed American black man would agree to 
stick his neck out and risk being shot. The current misery and 
willingness to honestly, though with a great deal of risk, 
improve their family's financial situation without resorting to 
criminal activities, have forced the boys and men of Galicia to 
go to the Balkans. Watching the picturesque beaches of Balaton 
Lake roll past as they ride in the railroad cars, they do not 
yet suspect that UN technical services have already taken care 
of their front service and possible dark days await them. 
  According to Zagreb radio, additional zinc coffins have 
recently been stockpiled in military warehouses. It is no 
secret that the subsequent truce may prove unstable. Even 
though the Serbs have been forced to agree on a cease-fire and 
their cannons have been temporarily silenced, they have 
frequently violated previous agreements and shown an arrogant 
attitude toward peacekeepers. It was enough for Moscow to 
beckon Belgrade with its finger and the Serbian separatists 
recaptured the cannons seized by the Russian "blue" troopers on 
a previous day. In the vicinity of Gorazhde, Russian soldiers 
have also ended up among the UN hostages. 
  What can be said about the exceptionally obedient Ukrainian 
soldiers? By the way, they will be exposed to great military 
pressures in Bosnia. On the one hand, they will have to bend to 
the Kiev leadership, which continues to tailgate its "elder 
brother" in formulating foreign policy, while on the other hand, 
the Serbs are angry at Ukraine because it does not exhibit an 
openly pro-Russian attitude and has certain relations with 
Croatia. In addition, the Croatian Ruthenians and Ukrainians, 
as well as official Zagreb, have not abandoned their intentions 
to recapture Vukovar and other territories occupied by the Serbs. 
  Thus, the Ukrainian peacekeepers will not have to only carry 
out the instructions of the UN secretary general, but also 
permanently watch the behavior of their "elder brothers" -- the 
Russians and the Serbs. Otherwise, the Serbian cutthroats will 
not pay attention to the fact that our boys are wearing "blue 
helmets." Speaking in a generally calm manner during a meeting 
marking the anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster, Ukrainian 
President Leonid Kravchuk nervously reacted to a banner carried 
by Ukrainian "Greenpeace" activists -- who demanded that all the 
lethal Chernobyl reactors be closed down -- explaining that 
there are no ways to raise money for energy resources, without 
which Ukraine will choke. This is an open lie however, and so 
are the statements that there is no money for essential 
medicines, raw materials, and spare parts for industrial 
enterprises, which have already put workers and engineers into 
despair and made them ready to take any steps. The high 
leadership, however, has managed to shake out huge amounts of 
hard currency from the state coffers to finance the UN 
peacekeeping battalions in former Yugoslavia. 
  Of course, nobody is against additional ways of earning 
money, even if they are dangerous, but, I repeat, they must be 
decent. Why, however, should this generate further 
impoverishment among a huge part of society? It is 
understandable that officials in the capital on the Dnepr are 
trying to look honorable before the world, especially the United 
Nations, and in this way pay for the debts of the Ukrainian SSR 
to this international organization. Ukraine has already lost 
its stake in the foreign property of the former USSR to Russia. 
Since Yeltsin's Russia has pronounced itself the inheritor to 
the Bolshevik empire, why would official Kiev not ask Moscow to 
pay the United Nations for the bills of KGB agents who were 
exclusively performing assignments for the Kremlin, hiding 
behind the USSR banner? 
  Yet another question arises: Did anybody consult leaders of 
the oblasts comprising the Ciscarpathian Military District, when 
the issue of the second peacekeeping battalion first arose? 
Were the deaths of our sons and daughters in Afghanistan and 
Chernobyl not enough? Do we have to send them to the Balkan 
slaughterhouse as well? One can only hope that in the new 
parliament there will be deputies who will address this issue 
directly to Ukraine's highest authorities.

"Government Intends to Stop Paying for Commercial Television and 
Promises to Communications Workers Preferential Electricity 
Rate"] 
  [Text] Anatoliy Nazeykin, chairman of the Russian 
Federation Communications Workers Trade Union Central Committee, 
has stated in a press conference that the Russian Government 
will look at the problems of radio and television at one of its 
next sessions. According to him, this session is supposed to 
determine a specific duration of state programming and the sums 
to be earmarked for it. 
  According to Anatoliy Nazeykin, Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin, 
speaking at a recent conference on the operation of Russian post 
offices and problems of the television and radio broadcasting 
complex, held with Communications Minister Vladimir Bulgak and 
acting Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin taking part, already let 
it be understood that "the government intends to appropriate 
money only for state-ordered programming," meaning those 
programs that society needs most of all in the opinion of the 
country's leadership. As has been made clear, such would be 
children's programs, sports, general education, 
information-political, and a number of other programs of 
educational importance. The broadcasting of ads and commercial 
programs will be done "for the finances of those who need them." 
  In this question, as the trade union leader thinks, Viktor 
Chernomyrdin completely shares the position of the 
communications workers, who have repeatedly demanded that air 
time taken up by ads and commercial broadcasts be excluded from 
the state-order time and be paid for at negotiable prices, and 
that the resale to other customers of the air time meant for 
state-ordered programming and paid for from the federal budget 
be prohibited. Viktor Chernomyrdin also expressed readiness to 
solve the question of a preferential rate of payment for 
electricity for communications enterprises. 
  The government session is also expected to look at the 
question of increased budget financing in a bid to preserve the 
reception and transmission network of television and radio 
communications enterprises on the basis of the minimal duration 
of broadcasting worth up to 1.5 trillion rubles instead of the 
679 billion provided for in the draft budget. Today this is one 
of the main demands of communications enterprises work 
collectives, "therefore the trade union's Central Committee 
leaders intend to insist that it should be acted upon," Anatoliy 
Nazeykin has stated.

<F P=106> [Maks Khazin article: "Court Valued S. Baburin's Honor and </F>
Dignity 25 Times More Cheaply Than He Himself"] 
  [Text] The first court series in the protracted process of 
examining Sergey Baburin's suit against IZVESTIYA and retired 
KGB General Oleg Kalugin in respect of protecting his honor and 
dignity has ended. He was prompted to turn to the court by O. 
Kalugin's public statement to the effect that in the past S. 
Baburin had been recruited by the KGB as an agent. The 
statement was made at the conference "The KGB: Yesterday, 
Today, Tomorrow" organized by the "Glasnost" public fund and was 
at once carried by many mass media, including IZVESTIYA. 
  Not that Baburin turned to the court right away. First he 
sent a letter to the Russian General Prosecutor's Office 
proposing that criminal proceedings be instituted against the 
offender for slander under Article 130 of the Russian Soviet 
Federal Socialist Republic Criminal Code. 
  No grounds were found, however, to throw the KGB ex-general 
behind bars, although the deponent was told that the Ministry of 
Security had no information about his, Baburin's, secret 
cooperation with it. Possessing this information, IZVESTIYA 
told its readers about it in the article "Not Discovered in the 
Lists of Agents..." (No. 206, 28 October 1993). You might think 
that this was the end of the conflict and that the honest name 
of the plaintiff was restored. Not at all. He not only 
continued to insist on a court investigation but also raised the 
stakes: He increased the price of his honor and dignity from 10 
million rubles [R] in the original version of the suit to R100 
million. 
  The first information in IZVESTIYA about the distinguished 
agent appeared 23 February last year in S. Mostovshchikov's 
reportage "Yesterday the KGB, Today the Russian Ministry of 
Security, Tomorrow the KGB Again?" The court did not summon 
that author as a respondent. Rightly so: The law "On the Mass 
Media" frees both an editorial board and a journalist from the 
responsibility to reproduce speeches by delegates to various 
conferences, congresses, and plenums. 
  Nevertheless, at the final stage of the process the court 
nominated another respondent -- journalist Nataliya Gevorkyan. 
In the article "KGB Agents Can Sleep Soundly" (IZVESTIYA 27 
February 1993) she had reproduced the same Kalugin speech and 
taken advantage of her professional right to expound her own 
personal views and judgments in this regard. She paid the price. 
  The testimony of witness K. Gorbunov, who once "served" Omsk 
University along KGB lines, sounded impressive: "I did not 
recruit Baburin." Answering a question from a representative of 
the editorial board, however -- if another plaintiff, really an 
informant, had been in Baburin's place, would he, Gorbunov, have 
imparted this to the court? -- he replied honestly: No, I would 
not have told it, despite having given a written undertaking 
accepting responsibility for giving false evidence. 
  Kalugin's interests were defended by well-known attorney B. 
Kuznetsov. He asked the court to listen to tape recordings of 
conversations with another chekist (he preferred not to appear 
before the court), who in fact spoke about secret cooperation 
between the KGB and the dean of Omsk University's Law Faculty. 
Unfortunately the court refused this. 
  This was not, however, the only motiveless refusal to 
satisfy 
defense pleas. Kuznetsov submitted a document to the court -- 
Order No. 00140 of the USSR KGB chairman of 4 July 1993 [date as 
published] approving the "Statute on the Agency Apparatus and 
Fiduciaries of USSR State Security Organs." It turns out that 
"the basis of the agency apparatus is...made up of Soviet 
citizens devoted to the cause of communism and to the socialist 
motherland." They can be "CPSU members who are capable, in 
terms of their political, moral, and businesslike data and 
potential, of ensuring successful leadership of a group of 
agents or fiduciaries." It is obligatory to be "politically 
competent, to possess tough qualities and the ability to 
convince people and to exercise the necessary influence over 
them." And, of course, "sincere warmth, benevolence, and the 
ability to achieve profound mutual understanding with people" 
are definitely important features of a secret staffer. 
  Impressive, is it not? But this is still not everything. 
In the section "Work with Agents" we read: "An agent must be 
disciplined, show resourcefulness and initiative, and be able to 
operate independently"; "an agent, regardless of the form of 
recruitment, must be characterized by honesty and loyalty to the 
obligations given to KGB organs." In the opinion of the 
defense, anyone who has so many virtues has no right to complain 
that moral harm has been done to his honor and dignity. On the 
contrary, it is only possible to take pride in such a range of 
positive qualities, since by no means everybody possesses them. 
  Respondent Kalugin went still further. In his view, he not 
only did Baburin no harm with his expose but did him a good 
service, strengthened his political positions among like-minded 
people, and helped him to pick up additional votes in the last 
elections -- for which the plaintiff should be grateful to him 
and certainly not take him to court. He also asked leave to 
submit the famous order (the editorial board's representative 
joined in with this petition), but Judge S. Varenova refused. 
Now this undoubtedly important document (just like the tape 
recordings) will appear in the case only if there is an appeal. 
  Another argument of the respondents is interesting: Agents 
were legalized by the Russian Federation Law "On Operational 
Investigative Activity," which was also adopted by Baburin, 
deputy of the former Supreme Soviet. How, then, can information 
about a person's lawful activity discredit him? 
  Kuntsevskiy Intermunicipal People's Court did not satisfy 
Baburin's material demands in full, but it obliged Kalugin to 
apologize in the pages of IZVESTIYA and exacted from him R1.5 
million in favor of the plaintiff, as well as state costs in the 
sum of R225,000. R2 million and R300,000 respectively were 
levied on IZVESTIYA. They even took R500,000 for moral harm and 
R75,000 in state costs from N. Gevorkyan, who turned up right at 
the end (and to whom, incidentally, they never bothered to 
present a copy of the statement of claim, as laid down in law). 
  The state costs are particularly touching: They are not 
exacted at all in cases in this category. Although Judge 
Varenova might well not have known this, since this was the 
first time she had examined such a case. But IZVESTIYA has 
addressed this problem repeatedly, insisting that state costs be 
exacted when the statement of claim is lodged, as in all other 
civil cases. This would undoubtedly restrain the money 
appetites of those who pretend to be defending their honor while 
at the same time not forgetting about strictly prosaic worldly 
boons. 
  We will inform our readers of further movement in the case.

  [Text] In 1994, the output of grain in Russia will be no 
more than 50 percent compared to last year when its net weight 
was 99 million tons, the chairman of the Federation Council 
committee for agrarian policy, Vyacheslav Zvolinskiy, told 
INTERFAX Tuesday. 
  This year, grain crops will cover a little more than 60 
million hectares and agricultural products manufacturers could 
harvest about 100 million tons "despite all our troubles." 
  However, farm workers failed to plough nearly one third of 
arable lands last autumn. As a result, they will have to plough 
up to 20 million hectares more this spring which alone will 
result in a loss of 15 million tons of grain, he said. 
  In addition, Russia had always spread 18-19 million tons of 
pesticides every year, a quarter of which was used for grain 
crops. This year, farms do not have more than 10 kilograms of 
pesticides per hectare. This will seriously affect the grain 
output, because every million tons of pesticides results in an 
additional 4-5 million tons of grain, according to expert 
calculations. 
  Large losses - about 2-3 million tons of grain - should be 
expected this year due to the poor condition of winter crops. 
To make matters worse, too few winter crops were sown in 
comparison with the last year. Another reason for the losses is 
poor maintenance of agricultural equipment and the lack of fuel 
and lubricants. 
  Zvolinskiy stated that taking this into account Russia could 
count on only 50 million tons of grain this year. Moreover, 
"the country will receive this amount only thanks to God and the 
selfless labor of Russian citizens who, despite the fact that 
the state has not paid for the grain it purchased from them last 
year, are doing their best not to leave the land unsown this 
spring," he was quoted as saying.

<F P=106> [By BUSINESS-TASS correspondent Olga Kostromina] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 10 TASS -- An average monthly salary at 
Russian state enterprises amounted to 146,000 rubles (80 U.S. 
dollars) in the first quarter of 1994. It was 145,000 rubles in 
the material production sphere, and 148.3 thousand rubles in the 
non- production sphere. 
  The rates of salary increase amounted to 132, 124 and 132 
per 
cent correspondingly as compared to the fourth quarter of 1993, 
sources at the Russian Ministry of Economy told BUSINESS-TASS 
here today. 
  An average monthly salary in the gas industry was 666,000 
rubles (361 U.S. dollars) in March 1994 against the general 
background of 169,000 rubles (92 U.S. dollars), 416,000 rubles 
(226 U.S. dollars) in the oil-extracting industry, 367,000 
rubles (199 U.S. dollars) in the mining industry, 122,000 rubles 
(66 U.S. dollars) in the machine-building, and some 100,000 (54 
U.S. dollars) in the light industry. 
  An average monthly salary in health care lagged behind than 
in the production sphere by 20 per cent in January-March 1994, 
an average monthly salary in education lagged behind by 24 per 
cent, that in culture and arts -- by 29 per cent, science and 
scientific services -- by 22 per cent. 
  Staffers of crediting and insurance organizations had the 
largest salary in the non-production sphere in March 1994 -- 
over 380,000 rubles (206 U.S. dollars), the smallest salary was 
in the culture and arts sphere -- 110,000 rubles (59 U.S. 
dollars). 
  The increase of consumer prices was compensated by an income 
increase by approximately 89 per cent in the first quarter of 
1994. 
  The number of persons with an income less than the 
subsistence minimum is decreasing. The index is now 25.2 
million people or 17 per cent of the Russian population as 
compared to 51.7 million or 34.7 per cent in the first quarter 
of 1993.

<F P=106> [by BIZNES-TASS correspondent Oleg Deyneko] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 10 May -- The total deposits by the 
population in Russia's Saving's Bank as of 1 March this year 
amounted to about 4.7 trillion rubles [R] and the average size 
of each deposit was over R20,000. The BIZNES-TASS correspondent 
was informed of this in the Ministry of the Economy of the 
Russian Federation. However, the proportion which this money 
represents in the total amount of the population's deposits in 
Russian banks is declining, and today comprises about 60 percent. 
  In the first quarter of 1994 the monetary incomes of the 
population of Russia were 8.8 times greater than the level in 
the first quarter of last year and amounted to R53.8 trillion. 
In comparable prices this amount corresponds to 60 percent of 
the monetary incomes of the population of Russia in the first 
quarter of 1991. 
  The population spent R37.5bn (69.8 percent) of the total on 
consumption -- buying goods and services. This is 5.9 percent 
less than in the same period last year. The proportion of 
expenditure on acquiring foreign currency increased more than 
six-fold to 11.6 percent. 
  In the opinion of experts of the Ministry of Economy, this 
shows that a stratum of the population has been formed which has 
a very high and constantly increasing level of income. If one 
excludes from the population's total income the expenditure on 
acquiring foreign currency, it turns out that the monetary 
incomes of the overwhelming majority of the population in the 
first quarter of 1994 were 7.9 times greater than in the first 
quarter of last year. However, because of inflation the real 
incomes showed virtually no increase.

  [Text] Moscow, 11 May (ITAR-TASS) -- Under the headline 
"Foreign Investors Need Not Fear Tax," today's edition of the 
CIS daily newspaper DELOVOY MIR carries excerpts from an 
official statement by the Russian Finance Ministry. 
  "Foreign investment in the form of resources remitted to 
joint ventures created within the Russian Federation or in the 
form of payment by foreign individuals and corporates for 
acquisition of securities of Russian businesses, and also loans 
and credits extended by foreign banks and lending institutions 
are not to be subject to value-added tax (VAT) or special tax," 
the document says. Also exempted from tax liability are 
resources gifted by foreign states to Russian businesses and 
organizations in the form of subsidies for specific programs. 
Pursuant to existing tax legislation, resources received from 
other businesses and organizations are subject to VAT and 
special tax, the newspaper says. 
  The exception is resources paid by founder investors into 
businesses' authorized capitals, and also for the purpose of 
joint business activities. Issue and transfer of loans, and 
also transactions concerning circulation of securities (shares, 
bonds, bills etc), are exempted from VAT and special tax.

  [Text] Moscow May 10 TASS -- "The wave of strikes, which 
hit Russia in the first quarter of 1994, began to subside in the 
second half of April, when social tension in the work 
collectives of most of enterprises, organisations and 
institutions of the Russian Federation began to ease," ITAR-TASS 
was told by Vladimir Petrov, head of the labour conflicts 
service under the Russian Ministry of Labour. 
  However, according to data released by the foregoing 
service, 
a pre-strike situation is still in force at separate enterprises 
of the petroleum refining and defence industries, in the 
agroindustrial complex, and in the mining and metallurgical 
industries. 
  According to Petrov, the miners of Perm region, for 
instance, 
have still not received the 1.5 billion roubles owed to them by 
the state for unpaid wages. The agro-industrial complex of 
Orenburg region has not received wages, amounting to 29 billion 
roubles, by the beginning of April 1994. Workers of the Dukat 
beneficiation [as received] combine, Magadan region, have not 
been paid wages for three months running. 
  As noted by the head of the labour disputes service, the 
question of financing defence enterprises is particularly acute 
today. According to the Russian State Defence Industry 
Committee, the workers of this sector of the economy had 
received wages only once in four months, and the state still 
owes some such enterprises the wages they should have received 
in 1993. Along with demands to pay the owed wages and to 
increase their overall earnings, the work collectives of this 
sector of the national economy call for the solution of problems 
linked with the size of the defence order, with the sale of 
military hardware abroad, with the easy crediting of defence 
enterprises and their switch-over to the production of civilian 
goods.

<F P=106> [Article by State Duma deputy (and former Finance Minister) </F>
Boris Fedorov: "No Reason To Revise Somber Forecasts"] 
  [Text] On 20 April the IMF Board of Governors approved the 
granting to Russia of the second part of the "systemic" credit 
of $1.5 billion, while at the very end of April 1994 the State 
Duma received deficit "additions" to the budget. Highly 
symptomatic. 
  First, the IMF. On page 57 of the documents examined by the 
IMF council there is a curious table on Russia's implementation 
of its earlier pledges on financial stabilization and economic 
reforms as of the beginning of April 1994. The table contains 
15 items, and on the right it shows the progress made in 
implementing them. Now, you will encounter "not implemented" 
nine times, "partially implemented" or "uncertain" twice, and 
"implemented" four times, and all four occasions relate to 1993. 
  There are various ways of interpreting the esteemed IMF 
governors' motives and the political factors that dictated the 
positions of, for example, the "big seven." But you do not 
exactly lack evidence that things are not as fine and dandy here 
as certain officials would have it. 
  Let us look at the recent statement by the government and 
Central Bank on economic policy in 1994. At least six times it 
states the intention not to fix a currency rate or prices, not 
to implement mutual offsetting of debts, not to resume import 
subsidies or preferential credits. It is important, of course, 
to give assurances of what "we will not do." But what "will we 
do"? 
  The most important measures are the promise not to give 
extensions on earlier credit issues any longer (interesting to 
see how this would work in the agrarian complex), hold more 
credit auctions, and reduce centralized exports and imports. 
Fine, but by no means enough. The 1993 policy can and must be 
continued, but the reforms must also continue. 
  The statement says that "the unification of the monetary 
systems of the CIS states with the Russian monetary system is 
possible only through the adaptation of the states' economic 
systems...." Vague, but at least it is clear that there is a 
need to adapt, and it will take many countries years to do that. 
But adaption suddenly occurred in just a few days. How do you 
explain the feverish signing of the agreement with Belorussia 
[Belarus]? Incidentally, this is not taken into account in the 
draft budget either from the viewpoint of inflationary processes 
or from the viewpoint of promised state credits. 
  Most important is the government's objective. In this case 
it is to reduce inflation to 7 percent in December 1994 from 8 
percent in March at the time when the statement was prepared. 
Not very ambitious.... 
  But even the figures that are cited prompt questions. The 
budget projections are fundamentally important. According to 
them, the federal budget deficit will not exceed 62 trillion 
rubles [R] in 1994. Now, at the end of April, we are being 
offered a further deficit of R6.4 trillion in Central Bank 
issues, mainly in the form of a concession to the agrarian 
lobby. An obvious trend. 
  It is interesting that even the IMF experts, in their 
report, 
indicated that income had been overstated and expenditure 
understated by at least R45 trillion, which it was intended to 
find through various taxation and other measures. I dare say 
that only a fraction of the income measures are at the adoption 
stage, and there is no question of any real revenue or real cuts 
at the moment. 
  My personal view is that the hidden deficit is of the order 
of R60 trillion. If you add to this R80-90 trillion in 
potential expenditure contained in laws, edicts, and decrees 
which no one has abolished, but which are not included in the 
budget, then the optimism dwindles even further. 
  The lack of real action, the creeping increase even in the 
acknowledged budget deficit, and the deferential treatment given 
to various lobbies are bound to cause alarm. I very much hope I 
am mistaken, but at the moment I see no reason to revise my 
somber forecasts. Once again we are on the path of rising 
inflation, devaluation of savings, almost total curtailment of 
investments, and absence of economies. And it is the poor who 
are hit hardest by inflation. 
  The government's latest actions to increase the deficit 
while 
doing nothing in the economic policy sphere could well make even 
the democratic factions in parliament stop supporting the draft 
budget, which is cleary becoming simply bad, having been only 
just tolerable. If a policy adjustment has begun, it will have 
to be carried out with the support of different forces.

  [Text] Moscow May 10 TASS -- The preliminary results of the 
first stage of the poaching-control operation which ended on 
Tuesday, points to a sharp drop in fish poaching and theft of 
other marine wealth in Russian Far Eastern waters. 
  Nikolay Kudinov, commander of naval forces of Russian Border 
Troops, told ITAR-TASS today that Far Eastern sea borders are 
securely protected. "The great power will not put up with 
violations of international norms and rules any more," he 
stressed. 
  In the admiral's opinion, the operation will be also 
successful on the subsequent stages as well. "It is too early 
to sum up the final results, but one thing is clear: The 
operation will help protect Russia's national interests," 
Kudinov underlined. 
  The admiral expressed opinion that part of funds earned from 
anti-poaching activities should be channelled for the needs of 
units participating in the operation.

ZIL's assembly line resumed work today. The shutdown was caused 
by financial difficulties arising from ZIL's inability to get 
its consumers to pay off their arrears and to settle its own 
debts with suppliers. 
  It is intended that in the next two months the car builders 
will be able to maintain the pace of production -- 180 trucks 
per day. Of course, the situation is not an easy one, ZIL deputy 
engineer-in- chief Vladimir Nosov told the ITAR-TASS 
correspondent. 
  Since the beginning of the year the workforce has been 
working in a special mode -- a single four-day shift a week. 
The works' debts to suppliers in April amounted to 60 billion 
rubles, even though consumers owe the works even more. 
Production has almost been halved. Last year ZIL made 108,000 
trucks and, even though this year contracts were concluded for 
159,000 trucks, ZIL executives believe that if business carries 
on as it is now, ZIL will be able to sell only slightly over 
50,000 trucks. 
  This is why an economic development program has been 
prepared 
now which, experts believe, will enable the recently formed "AMO 
ZIL" joint-stock company to survive. Its' President Yevgeniy 
Brakov said that it provides for legal and other measures to 
return the debt owned by the consumers, primarily from Belarus, 
Ukraine, and Kazakhstan. Today, 85,000 people are working at 
the enterprise -- in the long-term it is planned to reduce this 
to 60-65,000 and to close a number of unprofitable plants and 
sections. 
  ZIL is also counting on its new technical policy: In 
particular it is intended to considerably expand the range of 
trucks both as regards horsepower and use. The first steps have 
been taken: The production has been mastered of heavy-freight 
truck-trailer combinations and tip-up trucks, before the end of 
the year it is planned to manufacture a commercial batch of 
these trucks with a load capacity of 2 - 2.5 tonnes. The 
managers of the enterprise believe that this tactic will make it 
possible to considerably increase the demand for ZIL products.

  [Text] The expenditure of the military-industrial complex 
in the draft federal 1994 budget has been increased from 37 
trillion to 50 trillion rubles. The draft is scheduled to be 
considered today by the State Duma. Aleksandr Piskunov, deputy 
chairman of the Duma defense committee, said the amendment was 
introduced after a roundtable meeting of deputies and government 
members. The meeting was convened on 5 May after a personal 
request by Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin to President Boris Yeltsin.

  [Text] President Yeltsin approved the recommendation by the 
defense committee of the State Duma on the necessity of 
increasing defense spending in the budget for the current year 
to 55 trillion rubles. The recommendation along with Yeltsin's 
"I consider it expedient to agree" were sent to Premier Viktor 
Chernomyrdin; according to a well-informed source in the 
parliament's budget, tax, banks and finance committee. 
  In the draft state budget presented by the government to the 
State Duma the item for defense totals 37 trillion rubles. Last 
week several rounds of consultations on this issue were held 
between representatives of the Duma's defense committee, the 
Defense Ministry, the Economics Ministry, the Finance Ministry, 
and the Security Council of the Russian Federation. These 
consultations were coordinated by the president's aide on 
national security Uri Baturin.

<F P=106> [Sergey Parkhomenko report in the "Lobbyism" column: "The </F>
President Agrees to a 1.5-Fold Increase in Russia's Military 
Budget"] 
  [Text] The defense lobby in the Russian parliament has 
apparently used the pause granted it by the Russian Federation 
Federal Assembly's spring holidays to the utmost. According to 
a participant in yesterday's session of the State Duma Council, 
over the two festive weeks a series of intensive consultations 
took place between leaders of the republic's Defense Ministry 
and the Duma Defense Committee on one hand, and representatives 
of the Russian Federation Economy Ministry and Finance Ministry 
on the other. Presidential national security adviser Yuriy 
Baturin took part in the negotiations on behalf of the Russian 
Federation administration. The subject of discussion was the 
proposal by the above committee, submitted officially to 
parliament as an amendment to the draft 1994 state budget 
whereby the overall limit of spending on defense items should be 
increased from 37 to 55 trillion rubles, i.e., almost one and a 
half times. 
  State Duma Budget Committee head Mikhail Zadornov refused to 
comment on these reports in detail, noting only that he "would 
be very cautious about any such proposals." Some of his 
colleagues, however, were more forthright: Journalists were 
told that the committee coordinating the entire discussion of 
the draft budget knows nothing about which sources the authors 
of the grandiose amendment intend to tap to compensate for the 
increase in state spending. 
  Nonetheless, the same sources indicate that President 
Yeltsin 
has been fairly well disposed toward the solicitation of the 
defense lobby. The text of the Duma committee proposal was sent 
to Viktor Chernomyrdin with an endorsement saying, "I deem it 
reasonable to agree" [sshchitayu tselesoobraznym soglasitsya]. 
  The presidential resolution, it should be noted, appears 
extremely interesting owing to the peculiarities of Russian 
syntax which has confronted interpreters with just another 
puzzle of the "execute" and "pardon" kind [reference to phrase 
"kaznit nelzya pomilovat" which, depending on where the comma is 
placed, can read either "To be executed, cannot be pardoned" or 
"Cannot be executed, must be pardoned"]. Its exact meaning 
depends crucially on whether the original copy of the document 
has a period or at least a comma before the word "to agree." If 
so, then the lobbyists' success is almost a foregone conclusion.

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Kholodov report: "Star Fall at the Beginning of </F>
Summer?"] 
  [Text] The Defense Ministry caused a scandal on the eve of 
the holiday. Your MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS correspondent was not 
allowed to attend a festive press conference, in which the 
minister listed the Russian Armed Forces' accomplishments in the 
two years since their creation. This is how the Defense 
Ministry's Identify Friend or Foe system operates. And this 
despite the fact that Pavel Grachev himself has repeatedly asked 
in his press conferences: Where is such and such MOSKOVSKIY 
KOMSOMOLETS correspondent, why has he not arrived?! 
  There is no wish to say anything at all -- this is just 
awful, that's all. In addition, to all appearances the Defense 
Ministry is bracing for drastic changes just around the corner. 
Observers do not rule out that the reshuffle may affect even 
the minister. Reports about Boris Yeltsin's consultations on the 
subject with Andrey Kokoshin and Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov proved to 
be not entirely groundless. Having signed the "civil peace" 
agreement with his opponents, the president appears to have 
decided to exploit the respite to deal with the most "powerful" 
of all the power ministries following the special services 
reform. 
  The president's plans may have been prompted not so much by 
his disagreements with General Grachev on the Ukrainian issue, 
but by his wish to see rather a diplomat than a troop commander 
as his defense minister. If the CIS is to be substantially 
strengthened, an enterprise on which the president is clearly 
inclined to embark presently, the clever and subtle 
Generalissimo Menshikov [Tsar Petr the Great's lieutenant] is 
preferable as a right-hand man than Marshal Zhukov.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Veronika Romanenkova and Semon </F>
Ivanov] 
  [Text] Moscow May 10 TASS -- Financial difficulties have 
led to the 50 per cent reduction of the number of Russian 
cosmonauts, trained for space flights, while trainings according 
to the "Buran" programme have been fully discontinued, because 
no launchings of this shuttle vehicle are planned until the year 
2000. 
  "The six detachments of cosmonauts previously included 
almost 
100 men, which is much more than needed by expeditions to the 
orbital piloted "Mir" station, planned until 1997," ITAR-TASS 
was told today by officials of the inter-departmental commission 
for ensuring the flight and exploitation of the "Mir" space 
laboratory. 
  Cosmonauts aged above 50, were the first to be laid off. 
Nevertheless, 54-year-old Gennadiy Strekalov, one of the most 
experienced cosmonauts, was left on the staff. 
  One will hardly have to wait long for a regular space flight 
after this reduction of the personnel, as it happened, for 
instance, with German Arzamazov, who remained a stand-by on the 
ground for 17 years running, or with Tamara Zakharova, who is 
now on maternity leave, waiting for her turn to fly. 
  The largest detachment today belongs to the Russian air 
force 
-- 17 men. The detachment of the "Energiya" scientific 
production society will number 12 men. The medico-biological 
institute also has its own 5-man detachment. 
  The fate of 12 cosmonauts, trained according to the "Buran" 
programme, is yet to be decided. They may be switched over to 
training for flights to the "Mir" station.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Pakhomov] </F>
  [Text] New York May 11 TASS -- The U.S. National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) plans to launch 
automatic space probes to the planet Pluto and the sun with 
Russia's help. Alan Stern, representative of the 
administration, told ITAR-TASS by telephone that this project, 
dubbed "fire and ice", was now being discussed at top level in 
the United States and Russia. 
  According to Stern, the idea of enlisting Russian scientists 
and experts in the programme for the exploration of Pluto, the 
only planet of the solar system that has still not been reached 
by automatic probes, is explained by NASA's current financial 
straits. According to expert calculations, the cost of launching 
two space probes by means of the most powerful American "Titan" 
carrier-rockets, would by far exceed one billion dollars. This 
made the Americans think seriously about the possibility of 
launching the Pluto probes by means of the Russian "Proton" 
carrier-rocket. 
  However, Stern said that NASA's policy towards international 
scientific missions is that every side involved in them should 
make its own contribution, not merely provide its technology or 
render paid services. The Russians, he noted, did not like the 
idea of exchanging their Proton rocket for the right to instal 
on board the American probe its instrument, weighing not more 
than two kilograms, and to paste a label with a Russian symbol 
on the external surface of the probe. The Space Research 
Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences moved to "add" a 
Russian jettisonable sonde to each of the two American probes. 
They are to be released from the probes approximately 40,000 
kilometres from Pluto and to descend: one on the surface of the 
planet and the other -- on Pluto's natural satellite Haron. The 
sondes are to carry either equipment for measuring the 
composition of Pluto's atmosphere or photo- and cine- cameras. 
  NASA has still not decided what American equipment will be 
installed on board the probes, but experts of the Pasadena Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory in California, who specialise in long-term 
projects for the exploration of planets of the solar system, 
move to install only four instruments. 
  Pluto is the most distant known planet from the sun. It was 
discovered 62 years ago. Its period of revolution around the 
sun is 250.6 years. The composition of the planet's atmosphere 
is unknown. Welsy Huntress, chief of the NASA department for 
studying the solar system, is sure that the Pluto fight 
programme should be among the first on the list of scientific 
priorities. NASA believes that it is inexpedient to further put 
off its elaboration. In order to direct a probe towards Pluto 
it is necessary to use Jupiter's gravitational field to boost 
it. This will be possible only if the space vehicle is launched 
in the period between 2001 and 2003. 
  The solar project also stipulates the launching of an 
American probe, which would split in two upon approaching the 
sun: into a Russian part carrying an optical telescope, and an 
American part -- with instruments to study the physics of the 
plasma on board.

  [Text] Moscow May 11 TASS -- Judges of the Russian 
Constitutional Court will remain in office for a term of 12 
years. This is one of the key provisions of a draft law on the 
Constitutional Court which was adopted in the first reading by 
the State Duma on Wednesday. 
  The decision on the 12-year term in office was adopted 
following long debates. The accord was finally reached today as 
lawmakers voted for the resolution. 
  Another problem which caused unequivocal reaction from 
lawmakers was a provision suggesting that the president may 
offer candidatures to the post of judges of the Constitutional 
Court. Accord on this problem has been finally reached as well. 
  The draft bill on the Constitutional Court adopted in the 
first reading today is based on provisions of the existing 
Russian Constitution which were developed and made more concrete. 
  The Constitutional Court is the organ of state control, 
independently exercising judicial power by means of 
Constitutional Court proceedings. The main principles of the 
Constitutional Court are independence, collective approach, 
glasnost, competitiveness and equality of the parties concerned. 
The Constitutional Court consists of 19 judges appointed by the 
Federation Council on the recommendation by the president. 
  The State Duma has instructed the Committee for Legislation 
and Judicial Reform to finalize the draft until June 1, 1994 and 
submit it to the Duma for final approval.

Constitutional Court. The issue of judges' terms of office 
provoked a lot of controversy during the debate. The term of 12 
years has been defined. The right granted to the president to 
suggest candidates for judges' positions in the Constitutional 
court was another important norm which also provoked a 
controversial reaction among the deputies. However, consensus 
was also achieved on this matter.

by deputy Sergey Baburin to call into question the conduct of 
State Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin over his signing of the Treaty on 
Social Accord. At today's Duma plenary session, Sergey Baburin 
proposed adding to the agenda Ivan Rybkin's performance as

  In a brief speech from the floor, Sergey Baburin told his 
fellow deputies that the Duma chairman's act of signing the

  [Text] Lack of a quorum on Tuesday prevented the Committee 
on Budgets, Taxation, Banks and Finance of the State Duma, the 
lower house of the Russian parliament, to take any decision on 
the draft national budget for this year. 
  The Duma on April 15 approved the main points in the draft, 
prepared by the government, though suggesting a few amendments 
to it. The government, around the end of the month, responded 
with a document over 40 pages long, which has already been 
considered by some of the lower house committees. 
  On Tuesday it became known that the Duma Committees on 
Economic Policy and on Relations with the Commonwealth of 
Independent States had proposed that the draft budget be turned 
down. The Defense Committee, for its part, suggested raising 
the military expenditure from 37 to 55 trillion rubles. 
  The Committee on Budgets, Taxation, Banks and Finance is 
also 
critical of the draft. Committee chairman Mikhail Zadornov said 
at Tuesday's meeting that the government had "effectively 
ignored" many of the recommendations made by Duma members. 
Thus, the house had said the document ignores social and 
economic forecasts for 1994 and fails to meet some of the 
country's social and economic priorities as formulated in 
President Boris Yeltsin's message to parliament. The Duma also 
said the draft, if passed, would impose heavier taxes on 
manufacturers and provide for unreasonable expenditure for the 
officialdom. 
  The committee, of whose 43 members only 19 came to Tuesday's 
meeting, decided to go back to the matter on May 12.

  [Text] Moscow May 10 TASS -- Main services of the Russian 
State Duma (lower house of parliament) have almost completed the 
removal to a new building in the Okhotny Ryad. The State Duma 
Chairman Ivan Rybkin and his deputies began their working day in 
the new place today. 
  The shifting of deputies to the State Duma new building was 
preceded by its sanctifying by Archbishop Istrinski Arseniy with 
a group of clergymen, in accordance with a Russian Orthodox 
Church ritual. Meeting halls of the houses and premises which 
were already open by that time were also sanctified. 
  "We had decided that representatives of the patriarchate and 
his holiness himself will be permanent guests of the State 
Duma," house deputy chairman Valentin kovalev told ITAR-TASS. 
"During talks with Archbishop Arseniy, we spoke about a whole 
gamut of questions, which are impossible to resolve only on the 
level of knowledge, they need to be resolved at, what we call, 
the level of soul and heart," the duma official noted. 
  Kovalev emphasised that the Russian Orthodox Church has 
expressed readiness to render all kind of assistance to the 
State Duma. "Archbishop Arseniy reminded us that during complex 
periods of the Russian history, such as today, fathers of the 
Russian orthodox Church gave advices to statesman, and at 
present it will also not be superflous," Valentin Kovalev said. 
  According to Kovalev, the State Duma's shifting to the new 
place will be over within this week, as planned. The house 
deputy chairman noted that many premises are in need of repairs. 
  "We felt this after shifting here," Kovalev noted. "The 
system of communications is in a bad state. This worries the 
State Duma leadership more than anything else. There are 
problems with electric wiring, water pipelines and even the 
sewage system. Valentin Kovalev said that these question will be 
discussed at a meeting to be held next Thursday with the 
participation of the Moscow City Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov.

oblast by a delegation from the Federation Council, headed by 
Petr Shershov, chairman of the security and defense committee. 
  During meetings with the leaders of Russia's enclave oblast, 
with the command of the Baltic Fleet, and the 11th Army of the 
Russian border troops, the delegation discussed the possibility 
of Russia joining the international body regulating air traffic,

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Gadzhi Shamov] </F>
  [Text] Makhachkala May 10 TASS -- The Kizlyar board of the 
Terek Cossack community, affiliated to the Russian Union of 
Cossacks, has objected to the draft of the new constitution of 
the Republic of Dagestan (southern Russia), which was put to 
nation-wide discussion by the republic's Supreme Soviet. A 
regular meeting of the board has ruled its adoption 
impermissible. This is due to the fact that the draft does not 
reckon with the interests of smaller nationalities and envisages 
the possibility of Dagestan's future secession from Russia, 
which contradicts the Constitution of the Russian Federation and 
is fraught with tragic consequences. 
  If the new constitution of the Republic of Dagestan is 
adopted in its present form, the Cossack board will rule it 
invalid on the left-hand bank of the Terek river and will demand 
the annulment of the decree of the RSFSR [Russian Soviet 
Federated Socialist Reoublic] Supreme Soviet of January 9, 1957, 
placing the Kizlyar, Tarum, and Nogaysk districts under 
Dagestan's jurisdiction. 
  The Cossacks have informed the president, the parliament, 
and 
the government of Russia about their decision, as well as the 
leadership of the Dagestan republic and the local organs of 
power.

  [Text] The press secretary of the commander of the Russian 
border troops, Colonel Aleksandr Suvorov, told INTERFAX that 
visa control posts along the Russian-Chechen border cannot be 
opened. He said this in response to the proposal made by the 
Chechen Foreign Ministry to the Russian Foreign Ministry. 
  A Chechen diplomat referred to the fact that while crossing 
the border official government delegations of the Chechen 
republic "face obstacles." 
  According to Suvorov, under Article two of the Resolution of 
the Russian Supreme Soviet of March 1, 1993 the status of the 
Russian state border is given only to administrative borders 
with republics of the former Soviet Union. This article does 
not apply to Chechnya. 
  Currently, there are no Russian border troops along the 
administrative border of Chechnya and the Russian-Georgian 
border at its Chechen section. In this connection, no obstables 
to citizens, transport or cargoes can be posed by border guards 
in these parts, Suvorov said.

  [Text] Kazakh and American Government delegations failed to 
reach mutually acceptable agreements on ways to dismantle 
missile-launching installations in Kazakhstan, First Deputy 
Defence Minister Alikbek Kasymov told INTERFAX on Tuesday. 
  According to him, a major issue at their talks concluded in 
Almaty on Saturday was the fixing of terms on a tender for the 
work of dismantling the silos, and the participation of Kazakh 
firms in the tender. However, a mutually acceptable solution 
failed to be reached. 
  Kazakhstan believes that though the tender submitted by the 
U.S. Government is "open, because of its stringent conditions 
the participation of Kazakh firms in it is problematic," 
Kasymov said. 
  Those who intend to take part in the tender are the 
joint-stock company Katep (Kazakh nuclear energy industry), and 
two holding companies -- Special Installations and Construction. 
The talks are to be continued, Kasymov said.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 88 (578) -- </F>
Compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by 
Vladimir Shishlin] 
  [Text] In an interview with Interfax a member of the Azeri 
delegation to the Bishkek meeting for a settlement of the 
Armenian-Azeri conflict has denied charges that his delegation 
was responsible for the failure of the talks. He said the 
chance that Azerbaijan would sign the documents of the meeting 
in full was actually blocked because they were signed by Nagorno 
Karabakh as the third side to the conflict. 
  Baku believes that the status of the third side should be 
given to both the Armenian and Azeri communities of 
Nagorno-Karabakh. They should attend the negotiations without 
the right to vote or sign the final documents as official sides 
to the conflict. They can sign documents only as interested 
sides, the Azeri spokesman said. 
  Meanwhile, an envoy of the Russian president, ambassador at 
large Vladimir Kazimirov has told INTERFAX that in Baku the 
chairman of the Azeri parliament Rasul Gulyev signed with two 
reservations the Bishkek protocol urging the conflicting sides 
in Nagorno-Karabakh to stop hostilities as of 0000 on 9 May. 
  In addition to a cease-fire the document signed in Bishkek 
by 
the heads of parliaments of Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh as well 
as mediators from the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly Vladimir 
Shumeyko and Medetkan Sherimkulov (the speaker of the Kyrgyz 
parliament) urges the conflicting sides to work out a mechanism 
of implementing the cease-fire, including the withdrawal of 
troops from occupied territories and sending a CIS peace-keeping 
force to the conflict zone. 
  According to Kazimirov, one reservation made by the head of 
the Azeri parliament concerns occupied territories. He insisted 
on changing the formula to captured territories. He changed the 
part of the Bishkek document speaking of the need to send CIS 
observers or a CIS force to international observers or an 
international force. 
  Kazimirov said that the changes were made by the Azeri side 
and they should be viewed as Azerbaijan's a special opinion 
because for all other signatories to the Bishkek document the 
text remains the way it was signed. [sentence as published] 
  The envoy added that under the Russian peace plan the first 
stage of six days is given for ensuring the cease-fire, the 
second of 34 days for the liberation of captured Azeri 
territories (six regions lying outside Nagorno-Karabakh), the 
exchange of POW's and hostages, the restoration of power lines 
and communications, the return of refugees to their homes. The 
third stage will begin with negotiations on the status of 
Nagorno-Karabakh. Kazimirov stressed that the future of Shusha 
and Lachin regions of Azerbaijan should also be clarified. 
  According to the Russian diplomat, Russia proceeds from the 
assumption that the conflict involves three sides: Azerbaijan, 
Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia. He felt that this is a realistic 
approach and the only one that can speed up the solution of the 
problem. 
  IF Note: According to the press service of the defence army 
of the self-proclaimed Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh, the 
Karabakh armed forces in keeping with orders from the command 
have strictly observed the unilateral cease-fire since 0000 9 
May. Meanwhile, the Azeri Defence Ministry reports that despite 
the declarations about a unilateral cease-fire at 0300 on 9 May 
Armenian forces attacked Azeri Army positions in the south of 
Fizuli region, Azerbaijan.

  [Text] The airline company KyrgyzAba Zholdary and the U.S. 
aerospace corporation Boeing have signed an agreement in Bishkek 
on leasing two Boeing-737-200 aircraft. Each aircraft 
accomodates 120-130 passengers and uses half as much fuel as the 
Ty-154. Its crew consists of only two pilots. The American 
side agreed to a four-year-long lease. The first year our 
airline company will not pay rent -- it will earn some money 
first and only then will it pay for the lease. 
  It took half a year to negotiate the deal and talks were 
held 
both in Seattle and in Bishkek. Our experts familiarized 
themselves with the manufacturing process and the system of 
servicing and utilizing. The American side will train our crews 
as a part of the lease payment and also provide us with 
technical experts. Around 20 pilots will soon go to Seattle to 
be trained there. At the end of this year, two Boeing aircraft 
will land at Manas airport. They will fly to Moscow, Tashkent, 
Istanbul, Novosibirsk, and other cities. The Boeing aircraft 
can cover the distance of 4,000-5,000 km.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Mineyev] </F>
  [Excerpt] Brussels, 10 May -- "Turkmenistan is not seeking 
NATO's help, but is striving to develop partnership with the 
alliance on a mutually advantageous basis," Boris Shikhmuradov, 
deputy prime minister of this Central Asian republic, told an 
ITAR-TASS correspondent. At NATO headquarters in Brussels 
today, he signed the outline document of the "Partnership for 
Peace" program. So, 18 countries have joined the program, 
including eight former Soviet republics. 
  Turkmenistan, the deputy prime minister said, has 
possibilities of broad cooperation with NATO member-countries in 
all spheres, including the military one. He said talks were 
underway on joint programs for training officers of the Turkmen 
Armed Forces and on cooperation in other areas of military 
construction. 
  At the signing ceremony, B. Shikhmuradov said Turkmenistan 
sees the main purpose of its participation in the program set 
out by NATO member-countries in objectively promoting a solution 
to the principal task which is strengthening Turkmenistan's 
sovereignty and turning it into a fully independent member of 
the international community. 
  Along with developing partnership relations with new 
democratic Russia, the deputy prime minister noted, his republic 
is developing cooperation with West European countries and the 
USA, Asian states, and CIS neighbors. He specifically noted 
Turkmenistan's potential role as a bridge between Europe and 
south and southeast Asia. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tigran Liloyan] </F>
  [Text] Yerevan May 11 TASS -- "If the people of 
Nagorno-Karabakh is threatened with physical extermination, the 
Armed Forces of Armenia and the entire Armenian nation will not 
sit on their hands and watch dispassionately how their brothers 
and sisters are being killed," Armenian Defence Minister Serzh 
Sargsyan said in an interview with the newspaper AZG published 
in the Armenian capital, Yerevan. 
  The minister said that Karabakh needs no large-scale 
military 
assistance at present, because the armed forces of the 
Nagorno-Karabakh Republic can effectively rebuff all attacks of 
the Azeri Army. 
  The situation at the front in Nagorno-Karabakh has sharply 
improved in favour of the Karabakh Army and the initiative is in 
the latter's hands. The Azeri Army has suffered considerable 
losses in manpower and military equipment, the minister said. 
According to his estimates, Azerbaijan has lost about 12 
thousand soldiers and officers since December 18, and 650-700 
officers and soldiers, two combat aircraft, twelve T-72 tanks, 
six armoured vehicles, four artillery guns, two tractors and 
several truckfuls of ammunition since the beginning of the April 
offensive. During the same period, Karabakh lost 70 men, three 
tanks and two armoured vehicles. 
  The Armenian minister said Azerbaijan's leaders are trying 
to 
hide the amount of their Army's recent losses in the Mardakert 
and Agdam districts and are exaggerating the losses sustained by 
Karabakh. 
  The Armenian minister rejected allegations that the Armenian 
Armed Forces are involved in battles in Nagorno-Karabakh. He 
said the Karabakh Armenians make up the bulk of the fighters in 
Nagorno-Karabakh and a few tens of volunteers of Karabakh 
extraction from Armenia cannot change the overall picture. "We 
cannot forbid small groups of volunteers from Armenia to go to 
Karabakh in order to protect their relatives and friends, no 
more than we can regard them as armed forces," he said. 
  Sargsyan said Azerbaijan's authorities are seeking to 
involve 
Yerevan in the war in order to portray the Karabakh conflict as 
a result of territorial claims of one country to another, 
instead of the Nagorno-Karabakh's people national liberation 
struggle for self-determination. Azerbaijan's leaders "are 
ashamed to admit that the small Karabakh formations have been 
routing for a number of years larger Azeri forces armed with 
modern weapons and reinforced with Afghan Mojahedins, Turkish 
instructors and Ukrainian and Pakistani mercenaries," the 
minister said. 
  The Armenian leader rejected allegations that special units 
of the Russian Army are taking part in battles on the side of 
Nagorno-Karabakh to capture Azeri positions and hand them over 
to the Karabakh military. "Frankly speaking it would be good if 
the Russian Army were really involved there. But unfortunately, 
the Azeri allegations have nothing in common with reality," 
Sargsyan said.

  [Text] Yerevan, 10 May -- Armenian Trade Minister Tigran 
Grigoryan was arrested in Armenia today. An ITAR-TASS 
correspondent learned this from sources close to the republic's 
Interior Ministry. It is reported that the minister was detained 
while receiving a bribe. 
  Tigran Grigoryan is 46 years old. He worked for many years 
as a commodity researcher in Yerevan's fruit and vegetable 
trading system, becoming chief of this department in 1986. In 
1992, he became first deputy minister, and has been the 
republic's minister of trade since May 1992.

  [Text] On May 11 at about 5:00 in the morning, after 
artillery preparations the Azerbaijani troops backed by armored 
vehicles started an attack in the Mardakert Region of 
Nagorno-Karabakh towards the populated center of Seisulan. 
  The Nagorno-Karabakh defense army's press service said the 
attack had been resisted and the Azerbaijani troops had 
retreated to their earlier positions. 
  The Karabakh defense positions on the eastern section of the 
front were subjected to artillery fire. Hostilities continue in 
the region. 
  However, the Azerbaijani Defense Ministry reported on 
continuing military actions in the northern and northeastern 
zone of the Karabakh conflict (the Azerbaijani regions of Agdam 
and Geranboi). Baku said the Armenian formations kept trying to 
break through the Azerbaijani positions.

  [Text] Dear listeners, we now present a report on the 
latest situation in the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] and the 
border between Armenia and Azerbaijan. 
  It was hoped after Azerbaijan's disclosure that it agrees to 
the protocol that was signed in Bishkek by the Russian 
Federation and Kyrgyzstan that a cease-fire will be observed on 
the front line and suitable conditions will be created for the 
implementation of the measures that have been planned to end the 
dispute. We wish to recall that the NKR leaders ordered their 
defense units to cease firing on [words indistinct]. The 
Armenian side has remained committed to that order and has 
refrained from retaliating against the fire directed on the 
Armenian defense positions in various parts of the front line. 
  However, it is common knowledge that Azerbaijan is not 
interested in observing a cease-fire and suspending its military 
operations. A significant difference exists between that 
Republic's words and deeds. That viewpoint is confirmed by the 
following: 
  Azerbaijan's troops intensely shelled NKR positions with 
artillery units at 0600 today. Later, they attacked 
(Vashkeravan) in the eastern sector of the front line. The NKR 
Defense Army Press Service has reported that Azerbaijan's 
military forces, supported by armored vehicles, also attacked 
Yarymdzha in the northeastern sector of the front line at 1015. 
A preparatory wave of artillery shelling preceded their 
onslaught. According to the information we received at about 
1100, the NKR defense units were successfully obstructing the 
enemy's attacks. 
  Tension continues to exist in other parts of the front line. 
However, the Armenian units, in an effort to avoid worsening the 
situation and undermining the cease-fire agreement, have tried 
not to return the fire of the enemy forces as much as possible. 
  According to the information we have received, an incident 
did not occur on the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan until 
this afternoon. However, the situation in the region is tense. 
  Will the agreement reached within NATO's framework for peace 
also have a bearing on the NKR front line? Who knows?

  [Text] Baku, May 9 (TURAN)--Milli Mejlis' speaker, Rasul 
Guliyev, on behalf of Azerbaijan signed the Bishkek Protocol 
according to Vladimir Kazimirov, the special representative to 
the Russia president on Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  Vladimir Kazimirov arrive to Baku and held talks with 
Azerbaijan's leadership. He noted that the Protocol calls for 
an appeal for a ceasefire. [words indistinct] responsibility to 
observe the ceasefire. However, from the information of May 9 
it became known the ceasefire was violated by both sides. He 
also said that "the Bishkek Protocol must be signed alongside 
another document that is signed by the leaderships of Armenia, 
Azerbaijan, Nagorno- Karabakh and Russia". He stated, "The 
Bishkek Protocol should be treated as an invitation to the 
fighting parties to begin implementation of Russia's settlement 
plan". The plan consists of three stages. The first stage 
involves a ceasefire and to take measures to ensure that it is 
not broken. A six-day term has been given to implement this 
stage. The second stage must include the freeing of the 
captured territories of the six regions outside of 
Nagorno-Karabakh within thirty-four days, the exchange of 
prisoners of war, hostages, corpses and free exchange of 
information about the abovementioned categories of persons, the 
resumption of transportation lines and energy lines, the return 
of refugees and displaced persons to their homes. The third 
stage is to begin the negotiation process including the issue 
concerning the status of Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  According to Kazimirov, the status of Shusha and Lachin will 
be resolved during the final stage along with the final status 
of Nagorno-Karabakh. "Shusha is like Jerusalem. Azerbaijanis 
say it is theirs, and Armenians say it is theirs. This is not a 
simple question and this question must be negotiated...it is 
more useful for Azerbaijan to accept the Russian proposal in 
order to free 6 regions according to this plan: Agdamskiy, 
Fizulinskiy, Dzhebrailskiy, Zangelanskiy, Kubatlinskiy, and 
Kelbadzharskiy. Only after this, can the fate of Shusha and 
Lachin be discussed", said Kazimirov. 
  He noted that "There are three parties to the conflict: 
Azerbaijan, Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia...this is Russia's 
position and it reflects the existing realities and on realistic 
steps can settle this problem more effectively."

<F P=106> [Aydyn Mekhtiyev report under the "Conflict" rubric: </F>
"Shusha as Jerusalem. Azerbaijan Signs Russian Peace Plan With 
Reservations"] 
  [Text] Azerbaijan has joined the protocol on a cease-fire 
in the area of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict, which was 
earlier signed by the Armenian parliament chief, representatives 
of Nagorno-Karabakh, and also mediators from the CIS 
Interparliamentary Assembly. 
  While affixing his signature to the Bishkek document, 
Azerbaijani Parliament Chairman Rasul Guliyev voiced two 
reservations. The Azerbaijani side requested that the term 
"occupied territories" be replaced with "seized territories." 
The Azerbaijani side also changed the passage setting forth the 
need to bring in CIS observers into "international observers or 
international forces." Ambassador Vladimir Kazimirov, Russian 
special envoy, said in a press conference in Baku that these 
amendments should not be seen as changes to the text itself, 
because "for all those who signed the document in Bishkek the 
text will remain just as they signed it." When asked why the 
cities of Lachin and Shusha were not included in the list of 
regions to be freed from a troop presence, he said: "The 
situation of Shusha is somewhat reminiscent of Jerusalem's. The 
Azerbaijani side says that this is its city, but the Armenian 
side does not agree." So far, the Russian plan calls for the 
cities of Agdam, Dzhebrail, Fizuli, Zangelan, and a number of 
others to be freed. Kazimirov denied a statement that Russia is 
trying to realize its imperial ambitions. He said that Russia's 
objective is to put an end to the drawn-out conflict. The 
Russian envoy recalled that the Moscow-proposed plan includes 
three stages: a cease-fire and the cessation of hostilities 
within six days; the release of all seized territories (except 
for Shusha and Lachin), a speedy exchange of hostages and 
prisoners of war, and the restoration of communications within 
34 days. The third stage involves negotiations on the status of 
Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  Meanwhile, the decision by the Azerbaijani parliament 
leadership to sign the Bishkek protocol has drawn a negative 
reaction from many opposition forces. On 10 May, a joint 
statement was passed by 12 of the republic's political parties. 
"Azerbaijani political forces do not recognize the protocol 
signed in Bishkek, because it runs counter to the interests of 
the Azerbaijani nation and effectively legally formalizes the 
separation of the cities of Shusha and Lachin from Azerbaijan," 
the appeal says. The document stresses that disengagement 
forces may only be brought into the region under the aegis of 
the United Nations and the CSCE. Representatives of 12 
political parties called on People's Assembly deputies to voice 
a protest against the Russian Federation peace plan and to annul 
Rasul Guliyev's signature under the protocol. 
  In Baku, the possibility of implementing the Bishkek 
protocol 
is assessed pessimistically, because after Rasul Guliyev signed 
the protocol, David Shakhnazaryan, the Armenian president's 
special envoy, said that the Karabakh forces were not going to 
leave the occupied Azerbaijani territories in any event unless 
peacekeeping troops are brought into the region. Azerbaijan, 
however, opposes this approach, believing that if any 
disengagement forces are to be brought in, this move must be 
preceded by a complete withdrawal of Armenian troops from the 
occupied territories.

  [Text] Baku (May 9) TURAN--Yesterday following talks 
between special representative of Russian President, Vladimir 
Kazimirov, and Azeri representatives, the Chairman of Azeri 
Supreme Soviet, Rasul Guliyev, signed the Bishkek protocol 
concerning political settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani 
conflict, reports a TURAN's correspondent. 
  Kazimirov said that "Rasul Guliyev signed the Bishkek 
document with two reservations". Instead of "captured 
territories", Guliyev wrote "occupied territories" and to the 
word "monitors", he added the word "international". 
  "These reservations practically change nothing but the Azeri 
party thinks that it is very important", mentioned Kazimirov. 
  In his answer to the whether these amendments to the Bishkek 
document forwarded by the Azeri party will be adopted, Kazimirov 
said that "this document was signed in Bishkek by the 
representatives of Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh, the Chairman of 
the Interparliamentary Assembly of the CIS, secretary general of 
the Interparliamentary Assembly of the CIS the chairman of the 
Kyrgyzstan Parliament and myself as representative of the 
Russian president. For all those who signed it in Bishkek, the 
text will remain the same. Probably, the Azeri party expressed 
it particular opinion of this text". 
  According to Kazimirov, "the document was signed by the 
representatives of the legislative bodies which have created 
important political ground for the beginning of the settlement 
to the conflict". 
  "All concrete issues coming out of the protocol must be 
settled by executive powers, or presidents, premiers and defense 
ministers", said Kazimirov. 
  Kazimirov said that during his meeting with President Aliyev 
on Sunday "they agreed to order a cease in hostilities". "On 
the other hand, I know that Stepanakert has been already ordered 
to cease hostilities since I spoke with Stepankert by phone just 
now", said Kazimirov. But according to Kazimirov "there is no 
official agreement on a cease-fire between the parties, each 
party orders a cease in hostilities itself", mentioned special 
envoy of the Russian president. 
  "The matter concerning concluding the agreement on a 
cease-fire has yet to be discussed", said Kazimirov. 
  "The fact is that Baku and Stepanakert must conclude an 
agreement over the cease-fire themselves", mentioned Kazimirov. 
"Baku sees the conflict as one between Armenia and Azerbaijan 
while Yerevan believes that this is a conflict between 
Azerbaijan and Nagorno Karabakh and Armenia is not involved in 
it. Such propagandistic sentiments by Yerevan do not allow the 
parties to move towards political settlement of the conflict. 
  Kazimirov said that the Russian party believes that "one of 
the obstacles in the way of settlement of the conflict is 
Azerbaijan's non-recognition of Nagorno-Karabakh, the party to 
the conflict". He added that "it is up to Azerbaijan to 
recognize it or not". "But recognition of the party to the 
conflict is necessary in order to know with whom to sign the 
agreement for a cease-fire". 
  Prior to the Bishkek summit, the Azeri Parliament made the 
decision to not sign the Bishkek Protocol because its provisions 
contradict the interests of Azerbaijan.

space, the world ocean and seismic research. This was decided 
by the Latvian Academy of Science today. 
  The radio radar station with a 32-meter parabolic aerial is 
situated near Ventspils (180 kilometers to the north-west from 
Riga). It is considered one of the three Russian military 
strategic facilities on Latvian territory along with the radio 
radar station in Skrunda and the military port in Liepaja. 
  The Latvian Academy stressed that the radio telescope could 
be used jointly with the Russian Academy of Science. The two 
academies had signed a protocol on intentions in late April. 
  Head of the Department for Control over Russian troop 
withdrawal in the Latvian government, Ilgonis Upmalis, 
emphasized that utilization of the station for scientific 
purposes would raise the authority of Latvian science and let 
Latvia contribute to international research programs. 
  The Russian military facility will be transferred to Latvia 
on August 31, 1994 (after Russian troop withdrawal is over).

<F P=106> ["Text" of statement issued by Estonian Prime Minister Mart </F>
Laar in Tallinn on 9 May -- received via Internet E-LIST] 
  [Text] At a press conference which took place in Moscow 
May 6, the Russian Federation's Defense Minister, Pavel Grachev, 
stated that Russia will keep its forces in Estonia as long as it 
deems necessary and even reserves the right to bring in more 
troops if necessary. 
  This kind of statement by the Russian Defense Minister can 
be 
classified as a direct threat to Estonian independence and 
sovereignty. 
  Within the framework of the CSCE and the United Nations, 
Russia has made a commitment to withdraw its troops from 
Estonia, without any connection to any other issue. The August 
31, 1994 date was offered by Russia itself. Likewise, Russia 
has no basis for tying the withdrawal of troops from Estonia to 
the withdrawal of troops from Latvia and Lithuania. 
  I hope that this statement by Defense Minister Pavel Grachev 
represents his personal opinion and not Russia's official 
position. In this connection, I have directed our Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs to request an explanation from the Russian 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the hopes that Russia's Foreign 
Ministry will refute Defense Minister Pavel Grachev's 
irresponsible and tension producing statement.

  [Text] Polish President Lech Walesa together with Mrs. 
Danuta Walesa, who were on a two-day state visit to Estonia, 
concluded their visit on Tuesday [10 May] in Tartu. 
  Walesa met Tartu Mayor Vino Kull and city government 
members, 
Tartu University Rector Peeter Tulviste and made a speech to 
students, saying that both in Poland and Estonia new era and new 
possibilities need to be taken advantage of especially by young 
people. 
  At a press conference, given by Estonian President Meri and 
Polish President Walesa at the end of the visit, Walesa said 
that his first visit to Estonia was a return visit to President 
Meri's visit to Poland last May. Walesa said that the two 
presidents had determined the conception of development of 
Estonian-Polish relations, which would be the basis for concrete 
cooperation of the governments of the two states. 
  Commenting upon Estonian-Russian relations Walesa said that 
Russia should substitute her "dictatorship policy with 
partnership policy". "The problem of Russians in her 
neighbouring countries is the result of Stalin's policy. 
National minorities, however, must be loyal to the state where 
they live," Walesa said, adding that solution to these problems 
might take several decades but that policies which we see in 
Yugoslavia should be avoided. 
  Walesa said that representatives of Polish society in 
Estonia 
assured him that they "felt very well" here. "Of course not 
everything is ideal but these people understand difficulties 
caused by reforms in Estonia. In case of goodwill it is 
possible to solve all problems that arise," Walesa said. 
  Estonian President Lennart Meri told the press conference 
that Estonia and Poland have, thanks to geographic position 
common interests in many aspects. He thanked Walesa for 
Poland's support to Estonia's demand to withdraw Russian troops 
from Estonia by August 31, 1994. Meri stated that Estonia was 
interested in Polish investments. He added that already during 
the earlier meetings of Polish and Estonian leaders 
possibilities to build a gas pipeline that would connect 
Finland, Baltics and Poland with Norwegian gas reservoirs has 
been discussed, which would help to guarantee the independence 
of states of the region from their eastern neighbour. 
  Polish President left for Poland Tuesday afternoon.

  [Text] Tartu, Estonia, May 10, BNS -- Polish President 
Lech Walesa today finished a two-day visit to Estonia which 
included talks with President Lennart Meri, Prime Minister Mart 
Laar, parliament Chairman Ulo Nugis, as well as meetings with 
MP's [member of parliament] and the country's Polish community. 
  The Polish leader today had meetings in Estonia's 
second-largest town, the southern regional capital Tartu with 
local leaders and the rector of Tartu University. 
  Walesa at a press conference before leaving Estonia today 
said the two countries should establish a common system of 
political- economic development patterns and concepts to help 
the countries in their integration with Europe. "The 
independence of one country also means sovereignty of the other 
country and, in the final account -- the freedom of Europe on 
the whole," the Polish president told reporters. 
  He said Poland has enough economic, political and military 
strength to influence Russia to take Estonia as an equal partner. 
  Walesa in his comments on last week's statement by Russian 
Defense Minister Pavel Grachev in which the Russian minister 
threatened that Moscow might leave its army units in Estonia or 
even bring in additional troops, reminded that the remarks had 
come from one single politician which didn't mean that being 
Russia's official policy line. 
  But Walesa said a problem of ethnic minorities exists in 
Estonia and added that each country must protect its ethnic 
minorities. 
  While seeking a solution to these issues one must not 
proceed 
from the concept of nationality, but must be able to see the 
people's concrete worries, the Polish leader said. 
  Estonian President Lennart Meri said Estonia is very much 
interested in attracting Polish investments. But he added that 
the politicians can only create the conditions for active 
economic collaboration, while the real work remains to be done 
by the businesses themselves. 
  Meri said that since Estonia and Poland are both equally 
lacking oil or natural gas resources of their own, they must 
join forces to build a pipeline that would connect the Baltics, 
Poland, and some other North European country with the gas 
region off the Norwegian coast. 
  The Estonian president also pointed at the political and 
cultural aspects, beside the economic ones, of the Via Baltica 
-- a car transit route planned to connect the three Baltic 
countries and Finland with Central Europe via Poland.

  [Text] Tallinn, May 10, BNS -- The Estonian Minister of 
Justice, Kaido Kama, today criticized a bill on crimes against 
humanity and war crimes submitted to the parliament by the 
legislative body's so-called KGB commission. 
  The bill, which Kama said needs taking back as immature, is 
aimed toward establishing rules for the legal prosecution of 
activists of serial executions and mass deportations carried out 
in Estonia after the Soviet takeover in 1940, during World War 
II and the following almost decade of violent suppression by 
Stalin's regime. 
  The legislation was submitted by the parliamentary 
commission 
for investigation into the activities of the KGB and other 
foreign secret services in Estonia. 
  Kama said the parliamentary commission had submitted a "raw 
version" of the Justice Ministry's bill which the ministry had 
just turned over to other departments for coordination. 
  Although Estonia has joined the respective international 
conventions, it so far lacks legislation of its own to allow to 
start criminal proceedings against persons suspected of such 
crimes, the minister said. 
  The bill is now expected to be discussed by the legislative 
body as early as this week. 
  MP [member of parliament] Enn Tarto, a former political 
prisoner who heads the parliament's KGB commission, has told 
reporters his commission has got evidence against a number of 
persons who could be convicted for war crimes. 
  "We have turned over to the State Prosecutor's Office 
materials and documents about persons who organized and carried 
out the June 13 and July 1-4, 1941, and March 25-28, 1945, mass 
deportations and the 1951 deportation of members of non-majority 
Christian denominations," Tarto said. 
  "The prosecutor's office turned these materials over to the 
Defense Police, who refused to start a criminal case. Now the 
materials have been sent back to the State Prosecutor's Office 
and the whole case hangs in the air," he added.

  [Text] Tallinn, May 10, BNS -- The Estonian Cabinet at its 
meeting today ruled to post the newly appointed director general 
of the Police Department, Uuno Ellen, also as the acting head of 
the Home Guard. 
  The ruling is aimed at following the recent practice when 
the 
national police chief simultaneously was the head of the 
volunteer law enforcement force. 
  But Justice Minister Kaido Kama also told reporters today 
the 
Cabinet had ordered the Interior Ministry to draw up within one 
month's time a draft of new Home Guard Statutes or submit to the 
government a scheme of changes in the Home Guard organization. 
  It cannot be considered normal that the head of such kind of 
a volunteer-based organization is appointed by the government 
Kama said. 
  The parliament last month adopted a law on noncommissioned 
police force. 
  Home Guard leaders claim the legislation has placed their 
organization outside the legal framework. 
  The currently effective statutes of the Estonian Home Guard 
were established under a April 28, 1992 ruling of the 
government. The head of the parliamentary legal affairs 
commission, Juri Adams, has admitted that the ruling from two 
years ago fails to effectively correspond to present-day needs. 
Adams has suggested the Home Guard could continue existing as a 
non-profit organization or a public service entity.

  [Text] Tallinn, May 10, BNS -- The parliament faction of 
the senior political party in the Estonian governing coalition, 
the Pro Patria, issued a protest against Monday's [9 May] 
lighting of a memorial fire at the feet of a statue of Russian 
soldiers killed in World War II. 
  The temporary re-lighting of the fire in the memorial at 
Tonismagi, Tallinn, was authorized by Tallinn City authorities. 
  The Pro Patria faction in its statement today reminds that 
the victory of the Soviet Union over Nazi Germany in World War 
II meant for Estonia just replacement of one occupation with 
another. 
  "Also at the meeting at Tonismagi yesterday calls directed 
against the Estonian statehood were voiced and the symbols of a 
country that occupied us -- of the Soviet Union -- used," the 
Pro Patria says. 
  Quoting the fact that the Tallinn council and City 
Government 
are headed by opposition Coalition Party leaders Tiit Vahi and 
Jaak Tamm, the statement also points out that at a time when the 
Coalition party-led municipal administration gave a green light 
to the anti-Estonian rally, also attacks by the opposition 
against the Estonian Government delegation for talks with Russia 
have escalated. 
  "The Estonian delegation has remained true to Estonia's 
interests in everything and everywhere. At the same time we are 
concerned about the using of the Russian card as a tool to 
achieve domestic political aims by some political forces. We 
cannot go to concessions over issues vital to the Estonian state 
and people," the statement reads. 
  The permission issued by the municipal administration to 
Russian organizations to re-light the eternal fire was also 
protested by another ruling coalition member -- the National 
Independence Party. 
  "Lighting of the eternal fire was a moral support to the 
occupation forces still in Estonia," the party's Tallinn branch 
said in a statement. 
  The protests came after Russian organizations had held a 
ceremony at the Tonismagi memorial before noon on Monday to mark 
the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War II. 
  Wreaths were laid at the monument Monday by representatives 
of the Tallinn veterans league, the Russian Assembly, Russian 
deputies in the City Council, and the Russian Embassy in Tallinn. 
  The ceremony was followed by an Orthodox Holy Liturgy in the 
Alexander Nevsky Cathedral at nearby Toompea.

  [Text] Moscow May 10 TASS -- There are no Georgian 
guerrilla groups in the Abkhazian Gali region, says a statement 
of plenipotentiary representative of the Georgian state head on 
settlement in Abkhazia Aleksandr Kavsadze received by ITAR-TASS 
today from the press center of the Georgian Embassy in Russia. 
  The statement refutes Abkhazian claims that 250 armed 
Georgians allegedly crossed the Georgian-Abkhazian confrontation 
line along the Inguri River to terrorize the local Abkhazian 
population. 
  Kavsadze "personally controls the regional situation and can 
say for sure there are no Georgian guerrilla groups or other 
units on territory of the Gali region. Such Abkhazian reports 
aim to prepare the public for a new wave of deportation of the 
remaining Georgian population from the Gali region."

  [Text] The leader of Georgian Union for the Liberation of 
Abkhazia Boris Kakubava said he needed only five thousand men to 
return Abkhazia to Georgian control. The Union advocates 
military action against Abkhazia. 
  Speaking on national television, Kakubava said that many men 
could be mobilized by the Union in no time at all. What he 
needed, he said, was understanding with the authorities and the 
Union's Council would soon discuss the issue with Eduard 
Shevardnadze. 
  Kakubava was confident that a united Georgia would find it 
very easy to defeat the Abkhaz separatists and mercenary forces. 
He said several hundred Georgians were fighting in guerrilla 
units on Abkhazian territory.

  [Text] Georgian-Abkhazian talks, mediated by Russia, the 
United Nations, and the CSCE, continued this morning at the 
Russian Foreign Ministry in Moscow. No precise agreements were 
reached at yesterday's meeting. On Tuesday the sides mainly 
debated the introduction of peacekeeping forces to the conflict 
zone. They talked about the option of deploying peacekeeping 
forces along the confrontation line between the armed formations 
of the warring sides, situated on the Inguri River. In 
particular, they discussed how far the troops should be 
withdrawn from the river in order to create a buffer zone, where 
peacekeeping forces could then be deployed.

  [Text] Moscow May 11 TASS -- Abkhazia expressed a protest 
to Georgia over violations of its airspace by Georgian planes 
and warned it will shoot them down. 
  A statement by the Defence Ministry carried by the press 
service of the Abkhazian parliament expressed determination of 
Abkhazia "to destroy all flying craft which violate the border". 
  Russian experts fear that the situation in Abkhazia may 
aggravate in case any of the conflicting sides resorts to 
provocations. Tensions may spiral up, they believe, because both 
Georgia and Abkhazia occupy tough positions at the current talks 
in Moscow and often ignore reached agreements.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vazha Khachapuridze, state plenipotentiary </F>
on questions concerning the settlement of the Georgian-Ossetian 
conflict and personal envoy of the Georgian head of state in the 
Shida Kartli region, by Spartak Kobulia in Tbilisi; date not 
given: "Vazha Khachapuridze: `Samachablo Was and Will Be Part 
of Georgia Where Ossetians and Georgians Will Live Together!"] 
  [Text] As is known, in accordance with a directive of the 
Georgian head of state, Batoni [Georgian polite form of address] 
Vazha Khachapuridze has been appointed as state plenipotentiary 
on questions concerning the settlement of the Georgian-Ossetian 
conflict and personal envoy of the Georgian head of state in the 
Shida Kartli region. We propose an interview with him. 
  [Kobulia] Batono Vazha, if I may be so bold and begin by 
asking you a direct question: Why were you precisely chosen 
when the decision was adopted to extend to such a degree the 
functions and powers of the head of state's personal envoy in 
the Shida Kartli region? 
  [Khachapuridze] Not only the functions and powers but also 
responsibilities (and this is the most important thing) have 
been considerably increased. Proceeding from the situation that 
has taken shape, this is fully justified. There is a real 
danger that the Georgian-Ossetian conflict could soon turn into 
a chronic Georgian disease. It is no secret that the war in 
Abkhazia and our internal political upheavals have ostensibly 
transformed events in former South Ossetia into a problem of 
secondary importance. The fact that there has apparently been 
no fighting here for some time has contributed to this. 
However, in reality, the situation has been getting more 
complex from day to day and...unfortunately, this is continuing. 
In addition, the psyche and mood of the region's Ossetian 
population is changing. In reality, many of them today no 
longer consider themselves to be Georgian citizens! If we delay 
things again, this process could acquire an irreversible 
character. Given that, let us say, former relations between the 
Ossetian population and the north [North Ossetia] are becoming 
stronger and more extensive by the day, immediate measures need 
to be adopted if we are not to lose forever this historic part 
of Georgia. 
  This is not to mention such a common plague as drug 
addiction.... I will say without exaggeration that the struggle 
against Ossetian separatism could become child's play compared 
with the struggle against drug addiction. We let slip the 
opportunity to nip the drugs business in the bud (the Georgian 
Government at the time was faced with other vitally important 
problems); it has today turned into a monster that will be 
difficult to defeat. In short, the complexity and variety of 
the problems that need to be solved have necessitated extensive 
powers and considerable responsibility. As regards my 
appointment, probably one factor in this was that I come from 
Samachablo; I grew up there and began work there. I continue to 
have close contacts and relations with Georgian and Ossetian 
circles and am able to enter into dialogue with them, which is 
so essential today. One should also take into account that I 
have normal relations with the command of the Russian 
peacekeeping forces in the region.... 
  [Kobulia] At the end of last year, our press wrote that you 
travelled to North Ossetia and established contacts with local 
sociopolitical circles. Are these contacts continuing? 
  [Khachapuridze] Of course. While we were in Vladikavkaz, we 
had fruitful meetings with North Ossetian scholarly circles, 
parliamentarians, and representatives of the Georgian 
compatriots' association. We now plan to have another meeting 
but, this time, with the participation of CSCE representatives. 
We pin great hopes on this process. There are, after all, 
hundreds of thousands of refugees from Georgia in North Ossetia 
and the local leadership is extremely interested in a peaceful 
settlement of the conflict. The main thing is that everyone is 
clearly fed up with the "hot" or "cold" war.... 
  [Kobulia] If it is not a secret, what position does 
Vladikavkaz hold regarding the question of the status of 
Samachablo? 
  [Khachapuridze] I will begin by telling you that no one 
questions the territorial integrity of Georgia. As regards its 
general status, it is natural that the resolution of this 
political problem of state importance does not and cannot fall 
within the jurisdiction of the region's state plenipotentiary. 
The Constitution will decide this, taking into account the 
interests of all national minorities and all peoples living in 
Georgia in accordance with the recognized norms of international 
law. It does not accord with Georgia's interests if we fill our 
future statehood with new time bombs as the Bolsheviks did in 
the 1920's. Therefore, I believe that, taking into account 
every moment, Ossetian and Georgian specialists should discuss 
the status issue together; after all, one should not disregard 
the fact that more Ossetians live outside the former South 
Ossetian Oblast -- in the same Georgia -- than within it. What 
rights should Ossetians living in Tbilisi, Gori, Khashuri, 
Kareli, Akhmeta, or Lagodekhi have? In no way do we want them 
to have fewer rights than their compatriots in Tskhinvali or 
Java. I am not a lawyer but I do know that all Ossetians should 
enjoy equal rights in the future Georgia. Any other Georgia 
will not be a democratic state. 
  [Kobulia] Your words have an optimistic ring about them. As 
can be seen, you view the future with hope. Upon what is this 
optimism based? After all, today's opposition blame the 
authorities for the loss of both Abkhazia and Samachablo. 
  [Khachapuridze] What opposition does not blame the 
authorities for one thing or another? To what extent these 
accusations are justified is another question. It is a fact 
that our jurisdiction has become fiction in a number of regions 
of Georgia. However, I personally have no doubt that this is a 
temporary phenomenon. Take a look at our history. How often 
and for how long have we lost this or that territory? Didn't 
the amir [Muslim governor] have his residence in Tbilisi itself? 
God forbid that even the opposition should sincerely believe 
that Sukhumi or Tskhinvali have been lost forever. The Georgian 
nation will not forgive anyone -- neither the current 
authorities nor that opposition that could itself come to power 
tomorrow -- for the loss of Georgia's ancient land. This issue 
is a double-edged sword and any attempt to use it for narrow 
political motives is extremely risky. Finally, it is not a 
particular government but the country, the entire nation, and 
posterity that loses any territory. As regards specifically 
Samachablo, it is in no way "lost." If I did not believe this, 
I would not have assumed this post. I accepted it because I 
believed that Samachablo was and will be a part of Georgia where 
Ossetians and Georgians will live together. 
  [Kobulia] We Georgians have difficulty in finding the 
"golden mean" everywhere and in everything. We have to go to 
either one extreme or the other. Now also, one part of society 
pins its hopes only on diplomacy and international organizations 
while the other believes that the only way of getting back 
Abkhazia and Samachablo is by force. As you have told us, you 
are opposed to violent methods. 
  [Khachapuridze] As a person with a certain knowledge of 
politics (I do not wish to call myself a politician), I do not 
exclude violent methods in principle; in a certain situation, 
the interests of the state demand the use of force. After all, 
hasn't the United States often used force to establish order in 
the country? You remember how they dealt with the "Black 
Panthers." As regards our case, I believe that there are no 
prospects for resolving the Georgian-Ossetian conflict by force. 
Let us suppose that, with the help of external forces, 
ultranationalist and separatist forces on the Ossetian side 
would be able to maintain temporarily independence from Georgia. 
Then what? First, this would not constitute any kind of 
independence; even Vladikavkaz itself does not recognize them. 
Second, this would bring more misfortune to the Ossetian 
people! Likewise to us. If we use force to get Ossetians to 
accept conditions that do not correspond to their legal 
interests, this will also not be a guarantee of firm and lasting 
peace. The very first minor pretext will become a catalyst for 
renewed bloodshed, destruction, and a fresh flow of persecuted 
people; there can be no victor in a civil war and, likewise, one 
cannot neutralize once and for all relapses into civil war by 
force. Only a political approach and mutual agreement are 
acceptable here, when neither side feels that it is being 
deceived. Therefore, while there remains the slightest chance 
of settling the conflict by political means, I exclude any use 
of force. We should use our power and Ossetian power against 
the common enemy -- the drugs business and the drugs mafia. 
That is why we are calling upon the help of scholars and 
experts and I view this as a great force. Kalbatoni Marika 
Lortkipanidze and Batonebi Nodar Lomouri, Zurab Porakishvili, 
Levan Toidze, Soso Tsintsadze, and Levan Mataradze are already 
actively cooperating with us. 
  [Kobulia] A final question: Today, we are talking in 
Tbilisi although any person will tell you that your place is in 
Tskhinvali. How long will it be, do you think, before we can 
meet and continue our chat in Tskhinvali? 
  [Khachapuridze] Desire always exceeds reality. There is a 
difference between optimism and illusion. A great deal of work 
is necessary before a Tbilisian can freely go to Tskhinvali and 
feel safe. We are ready to do this work and we have elaborated 
a plan for this. This is no longer an illusion but optimism 
that is based on real factors. Ossetians from Tskhinvali, Java, 
and Akhalgori will arrive in Tbilisi without fear. This is how 
it was in the past and this is how it will be in the future. I 
will add that I have three daughters and I would like one at 
least to be married in her father's native region. You will see 
how many Ossetians will be my guests there.... 
  [Kobulia] May God hear you!

  [Text] The Commander of the Georgian Navy Admiral Aleksandr 
Dzhavakhishvili stated that "there can be no transfer of part of 
the naval base in Poti to commercial structures." 
  In an interview with Interfax he said that such an idea was 
proposed by some Georgian businenessmen with the purpsoe of 
expanding the commercial port. The commander said that these 
businessmen are supported "by certain circles in the republic's 
leadership." 
  Dzhavakhishvili said that the naval base in Poti is the 
second largest in the Black Sea after Sevastopol. It has a 
training center, a modern military port, a ship-building and 
ship-repairing plants, many warehouses in which emergency 
reserves for all of the Black Sea Fleet were stored, oilbases, 
etc. "They want to give all this to commercial structures," he 
said. 
  The commander said that "if the discussion of such projects 
does not stop, the Georgian Defense Ministry will have to resort 
to tough measures." 
  He said that during the recent meeting between the commander 
of the Black Sea Fleet and the Ukrainian Navy an agreement was 
reached on periodical entries of Russian and Ukrainian military 
ships in the Poti base. "Other joint arrangements were also 
scheduled," the commander said.

<F P=106> [Badri Koplatadze article: "Reut's Deputy Has Become </F>
Defense Minister. Tengiz Kitovani Has Returned To Georgia."] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] 
<H5>  Kitovani's Return From His Travels </H5>
  During the closed session [of Parliament on 26 April], the 
recent return from Moscow of former Defense Minister Tengiz 
Kitovani was the focus of journalists' attention. Kitovani 
looked extremely self-confident and enthusiastically answered 
journalists' questions. The former minister views the new 
[defense] minister [General Vardiko Nadibaidze] with extreme 
skepticism. Kitovani believes that Vardiko Nadibaidze will be 
unable to live up to people's hopes. In addition to this, many 
problems are arising in the Army that is unaccustomed to 
Nadibaidze's style of work. 
  Tengiz Kitovani gave a similarly negative assessment of the 
personality of [former minister] Murman Omanidze. "How can I 
have a good opinion of Omanidze who has stolen so many millions 
of dollars," said Kitovani. Kitovani pointed out that Omanidze's 
rapprochement with the Union of Traditionalists was highly 
doubtful given that he [Kitovani] was the founder of the union 
along with [former Supreme Council Chairman] Akaki Asatiani. 
Regarding Omanidze's intention to become a parliamentary deputy 
for Rustavi [major industrial town southeast of Tbilisi], 
Kitovani stated: "This will be possible only if he buys up the 
whole of Rustavi." It is interesting to note that [former 
Deputy Interior Minister] Davit Zeikidze, who incurred the wrath 
of parliament, is also planning to take part in the elections in 
Rustavi. Kitovani characterized the terrorist acts that have 
been taking place in Georgia as state terror. He touched upon 
his trip to Russia and pointed out that he had visited certain 
circles there. "We should view the situation in Georgia from 
there," stated the former minister. According to him, people in 
Russia have a very bad view of Georgia and so long as 
Shevardnadze remains in power, the situation will not change. 
Kitovani explained this by saying that Shevardnadze had nothing 
to be proud of when he left Russia and, in general, according to 
Kitovani, if Shevardnadze resigns in time, the situation will be 
saved. Kitovani explained Shevardnadze's return to Georgia in 
the following way: "We brought him here so that people could 
really see the situation that would take shape. Otherwise, they 
would have constantly been pinning their hopes on Shevardnadze 
alone." 
  Tengiz Kitovani cannot see any difference between democratic 
and reactionary Russia as everyone wants to rule and conduct his 
own policies. In his opinion, we will be unable to move out of 
the sphere of Russian influence. This was already decided in 
Malta. "We had a chance to leave then. If we had been more 
clever, we would have used it," said Kitovani. "However, now it 
is necessary to establish mutual understanding with those who 
are interested in the Caucasus." Kitovani mentioned the bad 
actions of our neighbors [Russia] and reminded journalists of 
what battalions had fought in Abkhazia. Regarding his meeting 
with Zhirinovskiy, Kitovani explained Volfovich's real 
intentions. He views Abkhazia as an integral part of Russia. 
  As for Abkhazia, Tengiz Kitovani stated that it was lost and 
that there was little chance of getting it back. "Shevardnadze 
was the principal reason for our losing Abkhazia," said Kitovani 
and added that he was guilty of many crimes. He mentioned 
Shevardnadze's visit to Kazakhstan and China as being one of the 
reasons for the loss of Abkhazia. 
  In response to REZONANSI's question as to what he thought 
about the current inspection of the Ministry of Defense, he said 
that he had nothing to fear and, if there had been something, 
the whole world would have known about it by now. 
  Finally, Kitovani pointed out that Georgia should be a 
parliamentary republic and that one-man management should be 
abolished as this, in Kitovani's view, will lead us to 
dictatorship. [passage omitted]

State Committee of Human Rights and Interethnic Relations, met 
Tevfik Okayuz, the Turkish ambassador extraordinary and 
plenipotentiary to Georgia. During the conversation issues 
pertaining to the protection of human rights in Georgia and 
ethnic minorities were discussed. Kavsadze admitted to certain 
violations of human rights in Georgia. However, the very 
existence of the committee he is chairing created on the 
initiative of the head of state proves that in future human 
rights protection will become a cornerstone of state policy. 
Aleksandre Kavsadze has also said that the committee is working 
on a draft law on ethnic minorities in the Republic and this 
draft law will soon be submitted to the Supreme Council for

  [Text] Moscow May 11 TASS -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin has left for an official visit to Germany on Wednesday. 
  The complete withdrawal of Russian troops from the German 
soil is expected to dominate the agenda of the visit. The two 
countries' leaders are expected to sign an agreement on a joint 
official farewell. 
  During the visit, the sides are also scheduled to sign a 
number of bilateral economic agreements. 
  Helmut Kohl has invited Boris Yeltsin to visit his native 
town Oggersheim, ITAR-TASS learned from sources close to the

<F P=106> [Report by Yevgeniy Bovkun in Bonn and Boris Vinogradov in </F>
Moscow: "Boris Yeltsin and Helmut Kohl Will Decide How To Give 
the Russian Troops a Worthy Send-Off"] 
  [Text] A final decision on the place and nature of the 
Russian troops' send-off will obviously be the main result of 
Boris Yeltsin's visit to the FRG, which will end 13 May. The 
send-off ceremony itself, scheduled for 31 August, has 
unexpectedly caused certain difficulties. 
  In a personal letter to Yeltsin six weeks ago Kohl proposed 
starting the send-off in Weimar, one of the centers of German 
culture, and continuing it in the grounds of Berlin's Treptow 
Park. The leadership of the Western Group of Forces 
categorically rejects Weimar. The former Buchenwald 
concentration camp is in the vicinity of the city of Goethe and 
Schiller. In addition, Weimar was liberated by the Americans. 
  A compromise will most likely be found. After all, the 
farewell could also take place in Wuensdorf, near Potsdam, where 
the Russian troops' headquarters is located. 
  On 1 July Germany will take over the presidency of the 
European Union, and Helmut Kohl has already promised Boris 
Yeltsin that he will promote the question of Russia's joining 
the Council of Europe, using all his economic and political 
clout for this. Helmut Kohl constantly urges the West to treat 
Russia as a great power. 
  Everyone in Germany has made his own preparations for the 
Russian president's arrival. On the eve of it DER SPIEGEL 
published extracts from his book "On a Knife Edge," NEUES 
DEUTSCHLAND carried a lengthy interview with Aleksandr Rutskoy, 
FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE printed an article by Gorbachev aide 
Anatoliy Chernyayev, and television's second program invited 
Nikolay Portugalov, a former CPSU Central Committee adviser, to 
speak. 
  The official program has ended up tightly packed, but it has 
repeated the route of one of Gorbachev's trips: political 
meetings in Bonn, a cultural program in Speyer with a visit to 
the famous cathedral, a brief private visit [uyedineniye] with 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl in his native Oggersheim, in Rhine 
Palatinate, and then Stuttgart, the capital of 
Baden-Wuerttemberg. 
  Councillors at the German Embassy in Moscow have said that 
the visit should be rated a "nonconflict" visit or, as people 
used to say, a "friendship visit." Because there are no 
unresolved problems, still less disputes, between Germany and 
Russia today. All possible treaties and agreements have already 
been signed. Now it is only necessary to fulfill them and 
exchange opinions. 
  But, whereas all is in order with the treaties, it is 
evidently too soon to speak of a shortage of problems in 
bilateral relations. Almost 90 billion marks in aid has gone on 
nobody knows what. Economic ties are developing according to 
the old scheme. Trade remains monostructural. Russia exports 
mainly gas and petroleum products, while machine tools, motor 
vehicles, and food go in the other direction. According to the 
data for last year, more than 1,000 joint ventures have been 
registered -- which is approximately 12 percent of the total 
number of joint ventures in Russia (the FRG occupies second 
place after the United States in terms of this indicator). 
  In the foreign policy sphere Russia and Germany have more 
reasons to strive to improve cooperation. This time Boris 
Yeltsin will not be able to avoid questions about the new 
concept of relations with NATO, as Pavel Grachev announced on 
the eve [of the visit]. People in Bonn and other European 
capitals have already been pondering the riddle set by the 
Russian minister of defense. What will a partnership of two very 
great military structures be like in real life? A great deal 
must be cleared up during the talks between Yeltsin and Kohl.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Yezhov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 11 May -- Russia and Germany must look to 
the future. After the pullout of Russian troops from the 
territory of the Federal Republic of Germany, a new stage of 
national reconciliation will begin between the two countries, 
said Boris Yeltsin today at Vnukovo airport before his departure 
on an official visit to Germany. 
  According to Boris Yeltsin, he will start the Russian-German 
summit with "the most difficult question": the procedure of the 
withdrawal of the Russian troops. There is no disagreement with 
the German side as to the timetable for the pullout. The 
president said it will be completed by 31 August. However, 
there are still differences on the procedure. The Russian side 
maintains that the last Russian troops will leave Germany from 
Berlin, while the German side says that they should leave from 
Weimar. "This is not the same thing," Boris Yeltsin stressed. 
[sentence as received] 
  Boris Yeltsin stressed particularly that in the social 
sphere 
Germany had met all its obligations with regard to construction 
of settlements for the military and accommodation for officers. 
"It is the only country to have taken this approach; moreover, 
additional social commitments worth 550 million German marks 
have recently been adopted." 
  Boris Yeltsin revealed that during the visit a wide-ranging 
package of documents on economic cooperation would be discussed 
and that a mutual return of cultural valuables would not be 
raised as a separate issue.

  [Text] [no dateline as received] "I am pleased to meet the 
German people, President Weizsaecker, and my friend Helmut Kohl 
with whom we are in constant touch by phone and letter," Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin told ITAR-TASS at Cologne-Bonn airport 
on arriving to pay an official visit to the FRG. 
  Speaking about the aims of his visit, Boris Yeltsin said, 
"This is a planned visit. We have to assess the results of the 
work that has been done during the year since my previous visit 
to Germany in the political, economic, and social arenas. We 
also have to discuss the withdrawal of Russian forces from 
German territory." In this respect the Russian president 
recalled that the final date for the pullout, "up to the last 
soldier," has already been set as 31 August. "And we are 
proceeding exactly to schedule," the president said. 
  B. Yeltsin pointed out that 38 major joint projects have 
been 
drawn up since his last visit to Bonn. "The time has come to 
examine their implementation and also to discuss a couple of 
dozen future joint projects." In addition, the Russian head of 
state said, "We have to exchange views with the German 
leadership on the political situation in Germany and Russia and 
look at international issues, including flashpoints." 
  President Boris Yeltsin was met in the airport, bedecked 
with 
Russian and German state flags, by Heinrich Seimen [name as 
transliterated], the head of the protocol department of the 
German Foreign Ministry, and by Russian Ambassador to Germany 
Vladislav Terekhov and his German counterpart Otto von der 
Gablentz. 
  The automobile procession left the airport for the 
government 
guest house, Petersberg, where Boris Yeltsin will stay during 
his visit. 
  The official ceremony of his welcome, with military honors, 
will take place in the afternoon at Villa Hammerschmidt, the 
Bonn residence of the FRG federal president.

    [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian at 1625 GMT on 10 May 1994 broadcasts the 10-minute 
prerecorded series "Details," which is devoted to Russian-German 
relations in the context of Yeltsin's 11 May visit to Germany. 
Announcer Sergey Dorenko asks: "Why is Yeltsin going there? 
What do the Germans want from him?" After reminding viewers 
that the Germans have problems of their own to deal with, 
without being too concerned about those of Russia, Dorenko 
focuses attention on the fate of Chancellor Kohl. He says: 
Most people think he will lose the October elections, so maybe 
Yeltsin is going to talk to a lame duck. Perhaps the visit is a 
waste of time. 
  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, who then appears on 
screen, disagrees: "If we are talking about the figure of 
Chancellor Kohl himself, I should not be in any hurry to say 
that there is bound to be a change of leadership in October. We 
are nowhere near the elections yet. Before the elections, there 
is still the G-7 meeting. Before the elections, there is still 
the troop withdrawal, which is to be not only a line drawn under 
the past, but also the definite start of something in our future 
relations. So there is plenty to work on before October." 
  In any case, as Dorenko points out, Yeltsin will be able to 
meet Kohl's possible successor. He will be talking to members 
of the opposition. This was, in effect, confirmed by Kozyrev, 
who says: "We always meet representatives of all parties -- 
always." 
  The main bone of contention at the moment is the question of 
how the Russian troops will take their leave of Germany. 
Presidential adviser Dmitriy Ryurikov says: "The troop 
withdrawal and the farewell to the troops is a very important 
symbol, a symbol of the great period that is coming to an end 
and a symbol of what we hope will be the still more significant 
period that lies ahead. So, such symbols must be very carefully 
thought out and fine-tuned, and they can be discussed. 
President Yeltsin and Chancellor Kohl will have enough time for 
discussion. Probably both for the Germans and for the 
Europeans, a troop withdrawal and a farewell to the troops in 
Berlin is the most understandable symbol." 
  Dorenko then reminds viewers that the Germans wanted the 
farewell to the Russian troops to take place 350 km from Berlin 
[in Weimar] and a week before saying goodbye to the Western 
allies in Berlin. 
  General Matvey Burlakov, commander of the Western Group of 
Forces, is not happy, Dorenko says, but is prepared to give way. 
As Burlakov puts it: "We will take part in the function, but, 
of course, if you like, maybe with a slight feeling of 
bitterness in that we cannot carry it out properly." 
  Dorenko then suggests, over video of Russian troops loading 
their equipment on to a train, that a compromise had been worked 
out, but no one was saying anything so as not to steal the 
leaders' thunder. "The compromise will be that the ceremony will 
take place in Berlin, but still earlier than the other allies, 
because the mechanics were worked out in Gorbachev's time, and 
Yeltsin won't be able to do anything about that legacy from 
Gorbachev." 
  In a further sequence from the pre-recorded interview with 
Kozyrev, Dorenko asks the foreign minister: "Is that scenario 
already being discussed, or are they preparing for you to arrive 
angry and then, you know, they will suddenly step aside while 
you charge on into empty space?" 
  Kozyrev replies: "No, I don't think they want us to arrive 
angry. They want there to be very serious summit talks. It is 
very important to sense what your partner is thinking. It is 
very important to understand your partner's logic, not just your 
own truth, but to see the other person's truth." 
  The final topic is that of the G-7 group. Was it on the way 
to becoming the G-8, with Russian participation? Although 
Russia's economic situation is far removed from that of the 
Germans, maybe the neighboring Germans would be able, after the 
summit, to explain to the distant Americans exactly what was 
going on in Russia. "That is the real benefit that we can 
derive from the visit," Dorenko comments. 
  Kozyrev reappears and says: "We have a sufficiently advanced 
understanding on that subject with our partners, which has been 
expressed in the fact that a Russian representative has been 
invited to all stages of the preparatory process of the 
discussion of these political issues. In other words, it is not 
only the president who will work in an eight-leader format, but 
also, already at the preparatory stage, a group of eight experts 
on quite a high level are essentially at work, and they are 
preparing all these issues for discussion. I think that this is 
a very significant step toward turning the G-7 into the G-8." 
  Dorenko's final point is that no Russian officials have 
spoken to the program about economic cooperation, although it is 
of great concern to the Germans. When speaking to him earlier, 
Dorenko says, a group of German businessmen poured scorn on 
Russia's investment tax. "Imagine that you are a German," he 
cited one as saying, "and you are investing $100 million in 
Russia. For that piece of folly, you will also have to pay $32 
million to the state. Meanwhile, President Yeltsin will almost 
certainly, as he did two years ago, urge representatives of 
business circles in Germany to come to our country with their 
money," Dorenko concludes.

<F P=106> ["Own Information" article: "The New Order. Rich and Poor </F>
Countries Stand By Their Interests"] 
  [Excerpts] The contours of the new world economic order 
have been outlined in the Moroccan city of Marrakech where a 
meeting has been held of trade, foreign, and agriculture 
ministers from 112 of the 125 countries in the General Agreement 
on Tariffs and Trade and also countries with associate member 
status. 
  Russia, which has lodged an application to join the 
agreement 
in June this year, participated in this meeting as an observer 
and carefully following the course of the sessions. In the 
opinion of foreign economic relations specialists, the Russian 
Federation's entry into GATT has enormous significance from the 
viewpoint of integrating the country into the world economy. 
Let us remind readers that approximately 90 percent of the 
total volume of world trade is handled by GATT member countries, 
whose collectively formulated decisions ensure greater 
predictability of trading volumes. It is no secret that Russia 
is encountering harsh protectionist measures from international 
markets designed to prevent its commodities being imported. 
This applies in particular to Europe, which receives the 
majority of our country's trade turnover. In order to uphold 
the interests of our domestic enterprises on the world market 
and negotiate with our trading partners on an equal basis (in 
accordance with procedures formulated by GATT over the decades), 
we need to participate in GATT, an organization which we intend 
to tie ourselves to -- following established practice -- not for 
weeks or months but for a much lengthier period of time. 
[passage omitted] 
  For Russia, full GATT membership will mean that it will 
become impossible for us to arbitrarily set import tariffs 
designed, generally speaking, to protect our domestic producers' 
interests. [passage omitted]
