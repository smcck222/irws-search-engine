<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vadim Byrkin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 10 TASS -- The question of U.S.-Russian 
command-staff drill at the Totsk grounds, the Orenburg region, 
remains open. 
  The State Duma has requested President Yeltsin to revise the 
drill expediency, bearing in mind "the Russian social-economic 
situation and progress towards civic peace". On the eve of 
signing the Civic Accord Agreement, the president said he 
understands the Duma's concern and recommended the defence 
minister to hold additional consultations with the U.S. side 
with due account of "the stand of Russian law-makers and the 
public". 
  The presidential statement provoked diverse reaction both in 
Russia and abroad. Chairman of the Duma defence committee and 
member of the Choice of Russia faction Sergey Yushchenkov is 
sure the decision on holding the drill is an "exclusive 
prerogative of the executive power, which has nothing to do with 
the State Duma," and the president's stand "testifies to the 
weakness of the executive power and its poorly-considered 
actions". 
  In his turn, presidential press secretary Vyacheslav 
Kostikov 
explained Yeltsin's stand with his striving for foreign and 
domestic political decisions to help the consolidation of civic 
accord. He denies the president's concessions to "certain 
forces", or, the more so, a certain cooling of the Russian 
leadership to the United States. 
  Chairman of the Federation Council Vladimir Shumeyko told 
ITAR-TASS that "any politician should strive for increased 
combat readiness of the armed forces, and all means are 
important in this respect, including a possibility to interact 
with other armed forces". In his opinion, the drill should be 
held, and forces outraged with "the Yankee stepping on Russian 
soil" should understand "the Yankee is not an occupant but an 
ally". 
  Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev thinks the same. "The 
drill must be held to bring the two peoples closer together if 
we really want to become partners and avoid the return to the 
cold war. The Totsk drill is symbolic," it will include only 200 
servicemen on each side and a small quantity of materiel. 
  The aim of the drill is to practice the organization of 
joint 
peace-making posts in separation, evacuation of wounded and 
delivery of humanitarian aid. "We must hold the drill for the 
sake of those we are striving to protect by our peace-making 
operations," said Grachev. 
  Deputy Secretary of the Russian Security Council 
Lieutenant-General Valeriy Manilov thinks the drill can be held 
on the area of the Russian Western Group of forces or on the 
Pacific coast. In his words, the question will be revised and 
all conclusions and proposals will be used in the final decision 
with due account of the public opinion. 
  The last word is to be said by the president.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 11 TASS -- Director of the Russian 
Military and Analytical Centre, Aleksandr Konovalov, believes 
that joint Russo-U.S. exercises on the Totsk test-site near the 
city of Orenburg will help bring the people of the two countries 
closer together. In an interview with ITAR-TASS Konovalov said 
that any "statements against conducting the maneuvers are 
prompted, primarily, by situational and political considerations 
and do not meet Russia's national interests." 
  According to the military analyst, statements alleging that 
the U.S. intends to "find out" Russia's secrets during the 
exercises are groundless as well. He rejected speculations 
alleging that Americans are interested in obtaining documents 
about an air nuclear explosion above the test-site made by the 
former Soviet Union in the 1950s. According to Konovalov, the 
results of an investigation into after-effects of the explosion 
were made public and are no longer secret. Besides, a group of 
scientists had recently worked on the test-site and the results 
of their work were published and contain no secrets for the 
world public. 
  Konovolov believes that the exercises of peace-keeping 
forces 
are of principal importance since Russian troops will inevitably 
have to carry out joint peace-keeping operations, while until 
now Russian soldiers and officers had not received sufficient 
experience. There is nothing wrong if a battalion, a regiment 
or a division take a training course using methods worked out by 
the best experts and experienced officers from Russia and the 
United States, Konovalov said. 
  Such training exercises will help many Russian servicemen 
from a peace-keeping contingent to survive, he said. "The 
military will be offered a wonderful chance to communicate, to 
know each other better and it will be the best way of bringing 
the people of the two countries closer together, making war go 
back into the past," Konovalov said.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: by Nikolay </F>
Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by Vladimir Shishlin] 
  [Text] President Boris Yeltsin in an interview with 
Interfax spoke of a prevailing atmosphere of partnership in the 
world arena and Russia's drive to establish such relations with 
its former adversaries of the cold war period, notably the 
United States. 
  However, he also called for vigilance. "While going ahead 
with arms reduction, we will be seeking military parity both 
with the United States and NATO", Yeltsin said. 
  Yeltsin pointed to the significance of new forms of military 
cooperation such as joint exercises adding that "we will hold 
them in an effort to beef up the spirit of friendly cooperation". 
  Yeltsin also pointed to the strategic partnership of the 
allied nations during the Second World War. However, he 
stressed that Russia must be treated as an equal because any 
other attitude was unacceptable. 
  For his part, Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said that 
Russia was not opposed to joining the NATO-sponsored Partnership 
for Peace plan. "We are not the weaker side in negotiations and 
have no inferiority complex on that score", he said. 
  "In my view, Kozyrev went on to say, it is desirable that 
attempts must be made to approve a wider concept of Russian-NATO 
cooperation rather than a framework agreement." However, the 
minister declined to say when exactly Moscow intended to sign 
such a paper. 
  In an earlier interview with Interfax, Kozyrev said that 
Russia wanted a more serious program of partnership with NATO to 
meet the country's status and specifics. However, he denied 
that such a program would be an alternative to the Partnership. 
  Russia will formulate its position on Partnership later this 
month, Defence Minister Grachev told Interfax. Grachev is 
expected to outline it at NATO's headquarters in Brussels on May 
24 following Yeltsin's approval of the Russian formula. The 
minister said Russia disagreed with parts of the Partnership 
plan. 
  At an earlier news conference in Moscow, Grachev said his 
ministry had decided to come up with a European security plan as 
an alternative to Partnership. He said Russian experts were 
given until May 15 to work out an appropriate document. The 
minister made it clear he had discussed the idea with Yeltsin 
himself.

    [Editorial Report] Moscow Radio Moscow in Russian to 
Tajikistan at 1700 GMT on 10 May in the "Slavyanka" program of 
the Russian Defense Ministry carries a feature on the 
anniversary of the liberation of Sevastopol in World War II. 
Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev is quoted on the future 
status of the port: 
  Grachev says: "Sevastopol should be the main base of 
Russia's 
Black Sea Fleet. We consider that in addition to Sevastopol, 
the fleet should also be based in Balaklava, Feodosiya, Kerch, 
and Donuzlav where the main forces of Russia's Black Sea Fleet 
are deployed and also where units and formations are stationed. 
It is clear that we do not have the right to, and we will not 
undermine the combat readiness of the Black Sea Fleet, a 
battle-worthy and full-blooded formation of the Russian 
Federation Armed Forces, as this would create a real threat to 
the security of Russia in this region. Nor do we have the right 
to worsen the already difficult social position of many Black 
Sea sailors."

  [Text] The chairman of the State Duma committee for CIS 
matters, Konstantin Zatulin, has warned against rushing 
presidential elections in Ukraine which would endanger calm and 
stability in the republic. In an interview with 
INTERFAX-Ukraine Tuesday, he pointed out he was referring to 
Russia's experience of aggravated relations between different 
branches of state power which should be taken into account in 
Ukraine. 
  "With great difficulty, we have surmounted the worst. 
Actually, the first stage of civil war in Russia has taken 
place," Zatulin was quoted as saying. 
  The interviewee said Russia would conclude "the most 
extensive agreements, the most extensive trade and economic 
ties" with Crimea. 
  A number of unsolved issues remain, the main one being the 
future of the Black Sea Fleet and Sevastopol, he said. "Without 
support from both Russia and Ukraine, Sevastopol will find 
itself in the most difficult situation," he said. 
  Zatulin did not preclude "Russia proposing to Crimea 
participation in a package of programs, in the first place 
economic ones." The Russian deputy has been participating in the 
Crimean parliament's session since its opening.

Aleksandr Shokhin was formed in Russia for talks on economic 
cooperation and trade with Crimea. This was said in Simferopol 
on Tuesday at a session of the Crimean parliament by Chairman of 
the Russian state Duma Committee for CIS Konstantin Zatulin. In 
his words, in the near future "a Crimean-Russian 
interparliamentary group" is also expected to be formed. 
  Zatulin pointed out that "today there is a possibility to 
start a new history of Crimea." At the same time, he urged 
Crimean parliamentarians "to be more contained and to take 
balanced decisions needed for the prosperity of the Crimean 
Republic."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Denis Perkin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 11 TASS -- The Russian-Estonian 
negotiations on the withdrawal of troops are now in a blind 
alley as concerns both military and humanitarian issues 
involved, head of the Russian delegation, Ambassador Vasiliy 
Svirin said in an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS today. No 
headway was made in last week's round of talks because of the 
"non-constructive approach of the Estonian side," the ambassador 
said. 
  "The Estonian side has gone back on its earlier statements 
which Russia regarded as a basis for the withdrawal of the 
troops before August 31," the ambassador said, referring to the 
statement made by the Estonian delegation head during the 14th 
round of talks, who went on record as saying that the agreed 
provisions concerning military pensioners remained in force 
despite the fact that they were at variance with some clauses of 
the law on citizenship of Estonia". 
  In the present situation there is no need to mislead the 
public opinion and continue "negotiations for the sake of 
negotiations". For this reason the Russian delegation has come 
up with a new proposal. Each of the for main working groups -- 
on humanitarian and legal, military, economic, and border issues 
-- must prepare new versions and formulas in May to pull the 
negotiations out of the impasse. Only when it becomes clear 
that serious shifts are in the offing, the date can be set for 
the next round of talks, the ambassador said. 
  Russia has no "excessive claims" concerning social insurance 
for military pensioners and their families residing in Estonia. 
Moscow's position on this is analogous to that it upheld in 
negotiations with Latvia. A mutually acceptable solution was 
found in those talks and Russia and Latvia signed a package of 
agreements, the ambassador recalled. The successful outcome was 
made possible thanks to the political will of the two countries 
and their readiness for sensible compromise solutions, he said.

<F P=106> [Report by Igor Petrov: "Fishing Quota Will Be Established </F>
in Baltic"] 
  [Text] After two years of painstaking preparatory work a 
package of agreements relating to cooperation in the fishing 
sphere has been signed between the Russian and Estonian 
governments. 
  One of these agreements is designed to promote the 
normalization of fishing in the Baltic while another concerns 
the reciprocal use and safeguarding of fish stocks in inland 
border lakes. 
  The agreement, signed for a period of five years with an 
automatic extension, in contrast to many similar documents also 
contains a mechanism for monitoring the documents' punctilious 
fulfillment. In the opinion of Vladimir Korelskiy, chairman of 
the committee for fishing, the next step will be to establish 
scientifically substantiated fishing quotas in the Baltic and to 
elaborate measures to safeguard a fish rated as a delicacy -- 
the smelt -- in the Chudskoye, Teploye, and Pskovskoye Lakes. 
  What draws the attention is the fact that the agreements on 
the solution of practical isues affecting the two countries' 
interests were signed before Russia and Estonia had unanimously 
decided to establish offifcial borders between the states. 
  Obviously fishermen understand better than politicians that 
while the case drags one the fish, which recognize no state 
borders, could be swimming off other shores.

  [Text] [Announcer Arina Sharipova] Recently, news bulletins 
have been devoting a great deal of attention to the evacuation 
of Russian citizens from Yemen. Quite a few questions on this 
topic have arisen and our correspondent Aleksandr Peslyak today 
met the high-ranking Russian diplomat [Foreign Ministry 
Department director] Viktor Posuvalyuk. 
  [Peslyak] In the diplomat's view, the evacuation of our 
fellow countrymen from Yemen was justified. After all, it was a 
matter primarily of the life and security of women and children 
and also of some experts whose presence was not vitally 
important. 
  [Begin Posuvalyuk recording] We have already evacuated some 
340 people to Moscow. In addition, there are over 60 people in 
Djibouti and I believe that some 30-40 people are also under way 
from al-Hudaydah to Djibouti. [end recording] 
  [Peslyak] The diplomat admitted that even though the French, 
Germans, and Americans had left in large groups, Russians had 
not been evacuated by order. 
  [Begin Posuvalyuk recording] Now many need to be persuaded 
and people are weighing all the pros and cons, are looking 
closely at the situation, and making a decision sometimes at the 
last moment. [end recording] 
  [Peslyak] And, for instance, 100 Russian women with children 
who are residing permanently in Yemen, did not board the French 
navy vessel the day before yesterday. So, people themselves can 
choose whether to take the risk staying. Regarding the 
situation as a whole, in Posuvalyuk's view, it is not the ethnic 
or the religious factor which caused the civil war, but the 
alienation of the power structures of the north and south, the 
incompatibility of the economies of the two parts of Yemen, the 
falling-out of the commands of the two independent armies, and, 
as a whole, the building of different models for socio-economic 
and political development. Fighting at the point where North and 
South Yemen meet has subsided and the diplomat believes the Arab 
League could now effectively play a peacemaking role.

  [Text] Moscow May 11 TASS -- A group of experts from the 
Russian Ministry for Emergencies flew to the Tanzanian capital 
of Dar es Salaam on Wednesday. At the request of the office of 
the U.N supreme commissioner for refugees, Russia will 
participate in the operation to provide those who are fleeing 
the bloodsoaked Rwanda with humanitarian aid. 
  According to a spokesman for the Russian Ministry for 
Emergencies, the experts will examine the routes and conditions 
for Russian drivers who are expected to deliver foodstuffs and 
medicines for Rwandan refugees. 
  The Russian transport team has already worked in the former 
Yugoslavia. However, the tropical climate, health hazards, 
difficulties with the delivery of heavy-duty Kamaz trucks by air 
and unloading them require specific preparations. 
  The Russian drivers are expected to start the deliveries 
this 
month.

<F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Nadein: "U.S. Seeks Company for </F>
Invasion of Haiti"] 
  [Text] Washington -- The United States has stepped up 
pressure on the military regime in Haiti in a big way. U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who is touring Central 
and Latin America, has continued the campaign started at the end 
of the week by President Clinton's pronouncements. 
  Apparently, the secretary of state's task is to rally 
American countries to such an extent that they allocate military 
contingents to overthrow by force the regime that has held sway 
in this island state since the expulsion of democratically 
elected President Bertrand Aristide. 
  Although the U.S. Administration acknowledges that the 
people 
will be the chief victim of any blockade, it is intensifying the 
blockade stranglehold as the final means of exerting pressure 
before a direct military invasion. At the end of last year U.S. 
marines were on the verge of launching an assault on the Haitian 
coast, but the White House withheld the order to attack at the 
last minute. In accordance with Bill Clinton's doctrine, the 
United States does not intend to participate in any peacemaking 
operations (that also involve measures to restore democracy and 
the rule of law in foreign states) unless it is as part of a 
coalition. 
  The United States has frozen the Haitian leaders' deposits, 
banned them and members of their families from visiting the 
United States, and confined flights from Haiti to the United 
States to commercial flights, carried out in accordance with 
schedules that were apporoved a long time ago. 
  One factor that has contributed to the hardening of the U.S. 
line is the Haitian military authorities' gradual strengthenning 
of their regime. It is claimed that the military's reign of 
terror has led to a sharp fall in support for exiled President 
Aristide. 
  The success of Secretary of State W. Christopher's trip will 
to a large extent determine the date of the U.S. military 
invasion of Haiti. An invasion by U.S. forces without the 
support of allies on the continent, symbolic though it may be, 
is considered unlikely.

  [Text] Here is an interview given by the Russian 
president's special envoy Viktor Posuvalyuk on the Middle East 
situation. Viktor Posuvalyuk heads the Middle East and Africa 
section in the Russian Foreign Ministry. We asked him to share 
with us his opinion about the prospect of the introduction of 
Palestinian self rule after the signing in Egypt of the Israeli 
and Palestinian agreement relating to Gaza and the town of 
Jericho. Here is the exclusive interview he granted us. 
  The Russian leadership and the majority of the population 
are 
overwhelmed with the signing in Cairo of an agreement on Gaza 
and the town of Jericho. The agreement is already being 
implemented. According to the Russian diplomat, the essence of 
this step is that it is the beginning of a practical advance 
toward a final agreement in the Israeli and Palestinian 
negotiations direction and toward an autonomy for the 
Palestinians [as heard]. Simultaneously, it is an advance 
toward more security for the Israeli population. 
  Now it can be said that the Palestine Liberation 
Organization, PLO, will have to assume control of the 
territories from where the Israeli troops and police are pulled 
out. The task here is of a multifaceted nature including the 
domestic needs of the population. These problems are 
particularly acute in Gaza. 
  Further on, the Russian diplomat said that Russia wished 
that 
a switch to a Palestinian administration was not accompanied 
with any internal Palestinian confrontation or an escalation of 
strife. Russia will expect that on the contrary there will be an 
active political force in these territories that will support 
the Palestinian authority in Gaza and Jericho. 
  We in Russia will warmly welcome it if there is a consensus 
and mutual understanding between the Palestinians and the 
leaders of the PLO, the leading officers of the Palestinian 
policemen, and such organization as the HAMAS [Islamic 
Resistance movement] and other Palestinian political figures who 
hold a more radical view [as heard]. 
  This is no time for arguments or bloodshed. This is time to 
begin solving actual problems of the Palestinian people. It is 
time to move toward peace. [Words indistinct] that the agreement 
on Gaza and Jericho as the beginning of the implementation of 
the agreement signed in Washington last year, will firmly serve 
the aim of peacemaking, calmness, and toning town the pitch of 
passions inside Israel itself. 
  Concluding his interview to Radio Moscow, Viktor Posuvalyuk 
said that Russia supports the Rabin government's policy directed 
at finding a political settlement of the issue and ensuring 
peace in this Middle East region. At the same time, Mr. 
Posuvalyuk stressed, it is necessary to mention all the other 
negotiations, among which we still regard the Syrian one as one 
of the (?pilots) in the Middle East peace efforts. 
  I can confirm here that Russia has taken and will take in 
this direction a most energetic part in bringing peace to the 
Middle East.

<F P=106> [By station observer (Masenko); from the "Half An Hour With </F>
Wang Xiao" program] 
  [Text] Listeners-friends: In 1993, trade between Russia 
and China hit a record $7.7 billion, roughly one-third more than 
in 1992. China is Russia's second largest trading partner after 
Germany. Station observer (Masenko) notes: In discussing 
economic cooperation and trade between Russia and China, we 
should note qualitative changes that have taken place in this 
respect. While bilateral trade was exclusively carried out by 
the government in the past, close to 80 percent of trade is now 
being conducted directly by enterprises that are partners. 
Russia's export structure has undergone favorable changes, with 
substantial decreases in the export of raw materials and 
increases in the export of machinery products to China. The 
export volume of machinery products, for example, accounted for 
approximately 40 percent of Russia's total export volume to 
China last year. 
  Our country's manufacturers of electrical appliances and 
machinery have secured a solid foothold in the Chinese market. 
Some 170 million people in China are still without electricity. 
China's electricity shortage has greatly impeded econonic 
development. The energy development plan adopted by China has 
provided Russia with tremendous possibilities. With Russia's 
assistance, China is now building three large thermal power 
stations and will complete all 23 [as heard] powerful thermal 
power plants over the next few years. Moreover, Russia will help 
in the construction of a nuclear power plant in the northeast 
province of Liaoning. In addition to power generation 
equipment, China purchases automobiles, aircraft, metalworking 
machine tools, and construction technology from Russia. The main 
strengths of various technologies developed by Russia are very 
reliable; they are easy to apply and their costs are reasonable. 
They often play a decisive role for China's import units. 
  Despite growing trade between the two countries, the two 
sides have yet to score substantial achievements in making 
investments in each other's country. Russia now has more than 
300 joint ventures, of which only a few dozen manufacture goods 
and provide services; the majority are engaged in trade and 
serve as agents. The adoption of a prudent approach by the 
Chinese people is completely understandable. Russia is in an 
economic crisis; it offers no reliable guarantees for investment 
because it frequently changes its laws on foreign economic 
activities. All this is not conducive to the massive infusion 
of foreign capital into our country. 
  There are also other problems in the trade contacts between 
Russia and China. The two sides have openly discussed these 
problems but also say that they should be aware of key 
advantages in spite of the difficulties; that is, objectively 
speaking, Russia and China need and complement each other. 
Russia has the goods that China needs badly, and China can 
provide Russian with the goods it needs. Our two countries 
share many common points, among which are a common border 
extending more than 4,000 kilometers and largely similar 
problems that should be resolved during the process of economic 
reform. In the 1950's, China laid the foundation for its 
industry with the assistance of the former Soviet Union, which 
was actually Russia; this also played a certain role. It is 
impossible to rewrite the aforementioned segment of history. As 
their relations have entered a phase of cooperation based on 
equality and reciprocity after the two countries ridded 
themselves of ideological dogma, China cannot forget the 
assistance provided by Russia, and the two sides hope to 
maintain their partnership and ensure that their trade contacts 
will expand steadily over the long term.

  [Text] Tokyo May 11 TASS -- This year's first group of 
Japanese has left for the South Kurils in accordance with the 
programme of the visa-free exchanges between these Russian 
islands and Japan, which began two years ago. 
  The ship, which sailed today from the port of Nemuro, north 
Hokkaido, to the Kunashir island, is bringing in 48 people, 
including 24 former Japanese inhabitants of the Kuril Islands, 
nine representatives of the national movement for the return of 
the "northern territories", and 15 journalists. 
  During their stay on the Kunashir island, the Japanese 
guests 
will meet local inhabitants, will visit a secondary school and 
several enterprises. Like the previous groups of Japanese 
guests, they will live in the homes of local citizens. The 
delegation will return home on May 13. This year's second group 
of Japanese visitors will come to the Kunashir island on the 
next day after its arrival in Japan. 
  The third season of visa-free exchanges began for the 
citizens of the Kuril Islands this April, when Hokkaido was 
visited by this year's first group of Russians. The same number 
of people is expected to take part in visa-free exchanges 
between the two countries this year as in 1993, that is 400 
people from each side. A distinctive feature of the 1994 season 
is that this year's delegations will include more specialists, 
able to use their trips to the neighbouring country to exchange 
professional experience.

  [Text] A group of members of Ukraine's newly-elected 
parliament are going to propose an amendment to the Constitution 
to strip the president of much of his authority, according to 
Rukh party leader Vyacheslav Chernovil. 
  In that case the president would only be the head of state 
and not the head of state and government as today, Chernovil 
told a news conference in Kiev on Tuesday. 
  He said it would hardly be possible to postpone the 
presidential election, something proposed by President Leonid 
Kravchuk, because a motion to that effect would need the support 
of at least 170 legislators and because the preparations for the 
26 June election "have already gone too far." Nevertheless 
Chernovil expects the matter to be brought up at one of initial 
parliament sessions. 
  At the same time, he said he considered it "immoral" to hold 
a presidential election before the legislature delineated the 
future president's powers. 
  Chernovil said his party would not propose its own candidate 
to the post of parliamentary speaker "unless the Communists 
nominate their own candidate." 
  According to the Central Electoral Commission, Rukh has won 
20 seats in the new parliament, or 5.9 percent of the total 
number.

  [Text] Kiev 10 May TASS -- Four candidates for the post of 
Ukrainian president have become known here on Tuesday, including 
Leonid Kravchuk. The other candidates include socialist leader 
Aleksandr Moroz, president of the Ukrainian Union of 
Industrialists and Businessmen Leonid Kuchma, and Parliament 
Speaker Ivan Plush, ITAR-TASS was told by vice-chairman of the 
Ukrainian Central Elections Commissions Valentin Kirnenko. He 
noted that all the candidates, according to preliminary 
information, had collected the 100,000 signatures, required to 
be registered as presidential candidate. 
  According to the same source, two would-be candidates have 
asked the central commission to give them more time to collect 
the needed signatures, but were refused. According to the 
legislation in force, a presidential candidate had to collect 
the needed signatures before 6 May. Moreover, he had to collect 
100,000 "autographs" in 18 regions and not less than 1,500 in 
each of them. 
  Leader of one of the Ukrainian Rukh organisations Larisa 
Skorik voluntarily gave up the race. According to some reports, 
she plans to campaign for Leonid Kravchuk. The Ukrainian 
president still wants the presidential elections to be put off 
to a later date. In addition to a large group of MP's [members 
of parliament], his stand is backed by the right-wing centrist 
parties and movements. Kravchuk plans to hold a closed meeting 
with them today. It is not difficult to guess that they will 
work out the tactics and strategy for the session of the new 
Ukrainian parliament, which is to open on 11 May.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 88 (578); </F>
compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy and edited by 
Vladimir Shishlin] 
  [Text] At the session of the new Ukrainian parliament 
opening on Wednesday President Leonid Kravchuk is expected to 
submit a document describing the reasons for the postponement of 
presidential and local elections scheduled for 26 June. 
  Earlier the head of state told the press that the powers of 
the new president should be clearly defined. He spoke for 
harmonizing the laws on presidency and local government. 
  "If the president in Kiev is going to have the powers of the 
head of the Executive Branch of power and territories are going 
to be governed by parliamentary structures, the president will 
have no power over the provinces," Kravchuk believes. He 
accounted his decision to run for presidency to the wish to turn 
down accusations from the opposition that Kravchuk is afraid of 
elections. IF Note: The collection of signatures in support of 
contenders for presidency ended on 6 May. According to 
preliminary reports, the necessary number of signatures (100,000 
in all the 27 electoral districts and at least 1500 in 18) were 
collected for Kravchuk, the former prime minister Leonid Kuchma, 
the former speaker of parliament Ivan Plyushch, the Minister of 
Education Petro Talanchuk and the leader of the Socialist Party 
Aleksandr Moroz. 
  Already 120 members of the new parliament have expressed 
readiness to support Kravchuk in his attempt to postpone 
presidential elections. Approximately the same number of 
left-wing MP's is going to vote against the postponement. 
Experts believe that the approximate balance of forces might 
block a decision on the matter. In this case the resolution of 
the old parliament setting the date of the elections for 26 June 
will remain in force. 
  Meanwhile, some experts do not rule out the possibility that 
the subject of presidential elections is not going to be raised 
at the first sessions of the new parliament at all as it will 
focus on procedure questions. 
  On Tuesday the working group for the agenda drafted the 
procedure of beginning the session. A member of the group Yuriy 
Sherenin said the parliament should first elect the presidium 
and secretariat of the session, the accounting and credentials 
commissions. After that the coverage of the session is going to 
be discussed as well as a draft resolution on parliamentary 
groups and factions. After the adoption of this resolution an 
interval should be announced for several days to form groups and 
factions and to register them.

  [Excerpts] Today, on the eve of the Ukrainian Supreme 
Council session, the Ukrainian president held a meeting with 
people's deputies. Addressing those present, Leonid Kravchuk 
said: 
  [Begin Kravchuk recording] [passage omitted] As for the 26 
June elections, there is no common point of view on this issue 
among the people at this point. An opinion is widely held by 
power structures, local authorities, political circles, and 
working teams that it is not expedient to hold the elections for 
president as well as heads and deputy heads of local councils at 
this time. This position was also endorsed in an address by a 
group of deputies to the people and the president of Ukraine. 
Since it was the Supreme Council that made a decision on early 
presidential elections and the election of local councils, only 
the Supreme Council can rescind it. As the president and a 
presidential candidate in the next presidential elections, I 
consider it necessary to explain my position on the June 
elections to the deputies and some proposals concerning this 
issue. 
  The situation that has take shape as a result of the 
elections for president and local councils has three aspects -- 
political, economic, and legal. The political aspect. As you 
know, some time ago, I actively supported the intention to hold 
early presidential elections, seeing it as a way to assuage 
political tension in the country. However, at this very time, 
there is a great risk that the political campaign will not only 
fail to soothe this tension, but hasten destabilizing processes 
as well as the polarization of political forces and their 
confrontation. An intensive campaign to elect the state's 
leader will only step up the political fight, while today, we 
need accord and mutual understanding to carry out socioeconomic 
changes and emerge from the current crisis. Perhaps, it is not 
by coincidence that many countries, especially in the CIS, 
conclude agreements on civil peace, accord, and joint efforts to 
preserve the state. This is of extraordinary importance for 
Ukraine and presents a chance for saving the state. One should 
take into consideration the arrangement of political forces in 
the country and distinctive features of its regions, which would 
inevitably divide people on the grounds of their attitude toward 
presidential candidates. It is already clear that those 
divisions will assume very acute forms and become an obstacle to 
civil accord. A serious threat to state-building is the vague 
status of local governments. The June elections are supposed to 
determine an utterly new option for the Ukrainian state system. 
Oblast and rayon councils receive the status of state bodies, 
or to be more precise, a new and imperfect status of local 
self-government bodies. As a matter of fact, it is an attempt to 
introduce a federal type of state system because oblast councils 
are given legislative powers. Their heads are elected directly 
by the oblast's population and cannot be replaced without its 
consent -- of course, if the established principles of 
expressing people's will are respected. [passage omitted] 
  Supporting broad economic independence of the [Ukrainian] 
regions, I am not going to use it as an excuse for dividing the 
unified unitarian state into separate parts. The state's 
federalization, unmatched by clearly defined constitutional 
norms, well-considered current legislation, and mechanisms for 
relations between the center and the hinterland, will make 
society unmanageable. By the way, experience shows that it will 
take years, not one month, to create legislation and adopt the 
Constitution allowing Ukraine to become a federal state. I am 
convinced that such large-scale transformations can only be done 
based on a new constitution. In this particular case, I invoke 
our national experience. Everyone knows that contradictions 
between Ukraine and the Crimea were caused by the fact that the 
Constitution does not specify relations between the country as a 
whole and its autonomous territory. Now, we are faced with the 
threat of spreading this kind of tension to all Ukrainian 
oblasts, which may trigger a political crisis. So there are 
serious grounds to believe that the June elections, in spite all 
good intentions, can lead to abrupt changes in society and put 
the state-building process in jeopardy. I am confident that one 
should at first adopt relevant constitutional principles and lay 
the legal base, and then launch political reforms. [passage

  [Text] The leader of the Republican Movement of Crimea, 
Serhiy Tsekov, was elected chairman of the Supreme Council of 
Crimea at the Crimean parliament session which opened today in 
Simferopol. He is a staunch supporter of Crimea's statehood and 
its integration in the CIS. The Commonwealth of Independent 
States itself, Serhiy Tsekov believes, must be transformed into 
a federation or a confederation.

  [Text] As a longer range priority, Crimea must be an 
independent legal entity and form a closer union with Russia, 
leader of the local Republican Party Sergey [Serhiy] Tsekov told 
parliament on Tuesday. He believes the idea of such a union 
must be legislated upon. 
  On Tuesday, the parliament's largest Russia faction holding 
55 out of the 98 seats overwhelmingly approved Tsekov's 
candidacy for the speaker's post. 
  Tsekov himself prefers a safer option providing for 
appropriate agreements to be signed with Ukraine and Russia and 
whatever laws needed to be adopted. 
  His rival Vladimir Klychnikov has called for a balance of 
forces in parliament and the society. 
  On the diplomatic front, priority must be given to Russia 
given that the emerging situation is good for Crimea's movement 
towards Moscow, he said. Klychnikov thinks Crimea must take 
advantage of the current situation when unification trends 
pervail both in the Russian and Ukrainian parliaments. 
  The deputies are expected to elect a new speaker later 
today.

    [Editorial Report] Kiev UNIAN in Ukrainian at 1300 GMT on 
10 May carries an item on the results of the 7 May visit to 
Crimea by a Ukrainian delegation headed by acting Prime Minister 
Yefim Zvyahilskyy. At UNIAN's request, members of the delegation 
commented on the trip to meet with Crimea's leaders. 
  In the view of Roman Shpek, Ukraine's economy minister, 
"Crimea remains a political issue and one has to know how to be 
noble. It is not worth trying to convince one another on the 
telephone of incorrect approaches -- it should be done on the 
basis of an analysis of local enterprises' balance sheets. As 
far as relations with the regions is concerned, it is necessary 
to change from confrontation to cooperation." 
  Roman Shpek added that last year the Supreme Council of 
Crimea had turned down assistance from the IMF, the World Bank, 
and the International Finance Corporation. This year, however 
Crimeans asked for such help and Kiev is prepared to meet their 
requests. The minister of the economy continued: "It is worth 
studying carefully Yuriy Meshkov's economic decrees. Firstly, 
in order to bring them into line with Ukrainian legislation and 
secondly, to use the beneficial aspects of the decrees when 
reforming Ukraine's taxation system." 
  Hryhoriy Pyatachenko, Ukraine's finance minister, said: 
"Ukraine's budget relations with Crimea are set in accordance 
with the 18 February 1994 treaties between the governments of 
Ukraine and Crimea. The amount of taxation that can be received 
by the Crimean budget for 1994 is 7.4 trillion karbovantsi. 
Crimea's share in financing general state programs is 4.3 
percent or 6.2 trillion. However, according to an agreement 
Simferopol does not transfer these funds to Kiev. The Republic 
of Crimea's expenses reach 4.7 trillion karbovantsi. It has 
been agreed that Crimea should transfer just 2.7 trillion 
karbovantsi to Kiev." Hryhoriy Pyatachenko added that in the 
first quarter Crimea owed 500 billion karbovantsi because of a 
fall in production and transferred nothing to Ukraine's budget. 
  Viktor Yushchenko, chairman of the National Bank of Ukraine, 
said he considered Yuriy Meshkov's decree on "Banks and Banking 
Activity on the Territory of Crimea" to be the most dramatic 
contradiction: "I think this law was copied from the Ukrainian 
law on banks but with the difference of where it mentions the 
National Bank of Ukraine, the decree mentions the Republican 
Bank of Crimea which becomes the property of the Republic of 
Crimea." He expressed concern at the Crimeans' insistence to 
obtain the right to issue licenses for the activity of 
commercial banks. In Yushchenko's opinion talks with 
representatives of Crimea would continue, but the best option 
would be if "they repealed the legislative acts that contradict 
Ukrainian legislation." The National Bank chairman reserved the 
right to "use protectionist measures to protect the national 
currency from imported Crimean inflation."

  [Text] Simferopol, 9 May -- An extended assembly of the 
coordinating council of the Congress of Ukrainians of Crimea has 
taken place. Representatives of the peninsula's democratic 
parties, civil organizations, and movements took part. They 
decided to form a parliamentary type representative body of the 
nationalist democratic forces of with a state orientation: the 
Ukrainian Civil Council of Crimea [Ukrayinska hromadyanska rada 
Krymu]. The newly formed organization aims to guarantee the 
inviolability of Ukraine's borders, the protection and 
strengthening of Ukrainian statehood in Crimea, and maintaining 
political stability peace and inter-ethnic accord on the 
peninsula. 
  The participants of the assembly were motivated to form such 
a body by the deepening crisis of Crimea's bodies of power 
which, in the opinion of the autonomy's representatives of the 
national democrats, has recently acquired a dangerous 
characteristic.

  [Text] Kiev -- A UNIAN correspondent learned on 10 May from 
sources close to Ukraine's Supreme Council that the working 
group preparing for sittings of the new parliament will submit a 
draft resolution by the Supreme Council on deputies' groups 
(factions) for examination at the first plenary sitting of the 
first session of the Supreme Council of the 13th convocation. 
In particular the draft envisages that there should be no fewer 
than 25 deputies in the composition of each faction. At the 
same time a deputy can only belong to one faction. If factions 
are formed on party principles, then the name of the party or 
parties making up the faction should appear in its name, without 
fail. The Supreme Council chairman and his deputies will not 
have the right to be in any of the factions. The Supreme Council 
secretariat will unite those deputies, who do not express a wish 
to be in the composition of any of the recorded factions, into 
one mixed deputies' group. 
  The draft envisages the right of representatives from 
recorded factions to proportional representation in all of the 
leading Supreme Council bodies (according to a separate draft 
resolution, proposed and adopted by a sub-group preparing the 
parliament regulations, the leaders of factions should be 
included in the composition of the Supreme Council presidium). 
It has been determined that every deputies' faction will have a 
guaranteed right for its representative to speak on all issues 
of the agenda at all sittings of the Supreme Council and its 
bodies. 
  According to the draft, the parliament Speaker will be 
obliged to provide those deputies' factions, which number no 
fewer than 50-70 deputies (the first session is to determine the 
final figures), with premises, the required equipment, and also 
assistance from administrative and technical staff. All 
materials from officially registered factions will be 
disseminated to members of parliament through the secretariat. 
  In the opinion of one of the Supreme Council officials 
involved in preparing the draft, who wished to remain anonymous, 
the new regulation on deputies' groups and factions, if adopted 
by the first session, will grant considerably more rights to 
deputies' associations and give factions the opportunity to 
influence parliament's most fundamental decisions, even without 
serious amendments to the number of parliamentarians in one or 
other faction. 
  The UNIAN correspondent also learned of the lists of 
proposals by working groups regarding the formation of the 
credentials and counting commissions at the first session of the 
Supreme Council of the 13th convocation. Twenty-five names of 
newly elected deputies have been submitted to the list of 
persons proposed for the composition of the credentials 
commission, and 23 names for the composition of the counting 
commission. In accordance with the proposals of the working 
groups, these commissions are to be elected at the first plenary 
sitting, after Ivan Yemets, chairman of the Central Electoral 
Commission, has spoken, and after information on the work of the 
preparatory groups has been given.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Yu. Zvyahilskyy: `It Is By Force of </F>
Habit That We Speak About the Crisis'"] 
  [Text] Whereas inflation reached 91 percent in December 
1993, it was 19.2 percent in January 1994; 12.6 percent in 
February; and 5.7 percent in March. This enabled us to adopt a 
decision on reducing the annual rate of the National Bank to 210 
percent. At the same time, it is possible to regard the 
catastrophic decline in the volume of production from a 
different point of view: The decrease in the production of 
electric energy, for example, amounts to just 18 percent, while 
the production of some foodstuffs and the output of individual 
branches of the national economy, including metallurgy, is even 
increasing. These and other facts were quoted to correspondents 
by acting Prime Minister Yu. Zvyahilskyy during a meeting in the 
UNIAN office. 
  According to Zvyahilskyy, the government currently controls 
the situation on the currency and credits and finance markets 
and has come out decisively against the resumption of auctions 
at the Interbank Currency Exchange, which would ensure a free 
exchange rate of the Ukrainian karbovanets relative to the U.S. 
dollar. In his opinion, this is risky as long as the energy 
sources account for 68.9 percent in the country's import and 
there exists a real threat that the prices on the consumer 
market may get out of control. For the same reason, "it is 
necessary to be more cautious in accepting recommendations and 
demands of international financial organizations." 
  Asked by a correspondent "if everything is so good, then why 
are we talking about a crisis?" Yu. Zvyahilskyy shrugged his 
shoulders: "Force of habit."

<F P=106> ["Ukraine's Cabinet of Ministers Decree No. 286 on Urgent </F>
Measures for Overcoming the Payments Crisis and Normalizing the 
Operation of Enterprises" issued in Kiev on 4 May] 
  [Text] In view of the difficult socioeconomic situation 
and in order to fulfill urgent measures for overcoming

enterprises; 
  On reducing, from 1 July 1994, the value-added tax to 20

Ukraine; 
  On establishing, from 1 July 1994, the rates of excise on 
alcoholic drinks at 80 percent, table wines at 10 percent,

on Individual Types of Goods" has been adopted. The latter 
decree is meant for creating conditions for the protection of 
home commodity producers, with regard to those goods that are 
manufactured in sufficient quantities in the country. 
  4. The Ministry of Economy, jointly with the Ministry of 
Finance and branch ministries and departments, must specify and

in demand on both the internal and external markets and also 
those enterprises and organizations the results of whose

of reducing the bank rate taking into account the actual

  [Text] As reported by the Press Center of Ukraine's 
Ministry of Environmental Protection, according to the data of 
the Ivano-Frankivsk State Administration of the Environmental 
Ministry, an oil spill from a cistern of the Drohobych refinery 
occurred on 25 April. Its size is being estimated. 
  The oil found its way into the Tysmenytsya River and has now 
reached the Dniester. The plant's civil defense formation was 
put into action to clean the contaminated areas. The main oil 
flow was stopped owing to measures taken on the Tysmenytsya 
River. 
  Individual large slicks were observed in the Dniester River 
at 1400-1500 on 26 April on the outskirts of the Kolodruba 
village. 
  During the night and on the morning of 27 April, oil slicks 
were expected in the area between Rozdol and Zhuravno. Barriers 
are being set up. Chemical methods will be used for binding the 
oil.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sevastopol City Council Chairman Viktor </F>
Mikhaylovich Semenov by G. Staroverov; place and date not given: 
"Sevastopol and the Fleet Are Indivisible"] 
  [Text] [Staroverov] Viktor Mikhaylovich, how do you assess 
the current situation in Sevastopol? 
  [Semenov] The situation in the city remains very tense. 
First of all, this is explained by the still undetermined 
status of the Black Sea Fleet and Sevastopol. A recent meeting 
between Russian and Ukrainian military delegations in our city 
devoted to the Black Sea Fleet issue did not produce any 
positive results. On the contrary, they were a step backward. 
The reason is that the Ukrainian side, in my mind, adopted a 
destructive position and, in fact, avoided the Moscow agreement 
on resolving the Black Sea Fleet issue step-by-step. 
Nevertheless, the signature of Ukrainian President Leonid M. 
Kravchuk is on this pact. 
  Participants in the recent session of the Sevastopol City 
Executive Council have assessed the situation in the city. They 
have decisively denounced the discord in relations between the 
Ukrainian Armed Forces and the Black Sea Fleet. In our opinion, 
this situation was triggered by the indecisiveness and 
inconsistency of the moves by top leaders in Ukraine and Russia 
to resolve the Black Sea Fleet issue, and their ignoring of 
proposals from the Sevastopol City Council, the Crimean Supreme 
Soviet, and the Crimean president. 
  [Statoverov] Viktor Mikhaylovich, you and Crimean President 
Yuriy Meshkov did not participate in this meeting between the 
Russian and Ukrainian delegations. 
  [Semenov] To my regret, you are correct. Two seats at the 
negotiating table were reserved for us. However, Ukrainian 
Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy categorically opposed our 
participation in the talks. He explained his position by 
discussing purely military-technical issues. Of course, this 
was a lame excuse. 
  [Statoverov] What was the real reason then? 
  [Semenov] The negotiations reached a deadlock not on the 
issue of dividing ships but on the location of the base for the 
Russian Black Sea Fleet and Ukrainian Navy. This directly 
addresses the core interests of all residents of Sevastopol and 
Crimea. The position of the Sevastopol City Council and me, as 
its chairman, is exact and explicit. We support the Russian and 
Ukrainian presidents' decision on the impossibility of the 
further joint stationing of two fleets at the same base and 
issuing a proposal to the Ukrainian Navy to move its 
headquarters and other facilities to places other than 
Sevastopol. Our position is clear: Sevastopol and the Black 
Sea Fleet are indivisible. For more than two centuries, they 
shared their history, traditions, and goals. 
  [Statoverov] There is no more important issue for us, as 
Sevastopol residents, than the clarification of the status of 
our native city. On 26 June, when Ukrainian local 
administration elections are held, we will conduct a poll of our 
residents. The question will be as follows: Do you support the 
status of Sevastopol as the primary Black Sea base for Russia, 
as proceeding from the Russian-Ukrainian Protocol of 3 September 
1993? The text of the Massandra pact will be printed on the 
back of the ballot paper. 
  [Semenov] The location of the Russian Black Sea Fleet means 
the resolution of socioeconomic issues for residents of 
Sevastopol and Crimea... 
  [Statoverov] Of course. Currently, we are witnessing a sharp 
drop in production. Many enterprises have no means even to pay 
wages to their workers. Hidden unemployment is growing. 
Currently, one in every three employed people is on unpaid 
leave or is working part-time. Regular lack of energy resources 
also adds to the overall social tension. Or, for example, the 
city budget. The total sum of our expenditures adopted by the 
Ukrainian Supreme Council stands only at 873 billion 
karbovanetses. We need an additional five or six such budgets 
to live at 1993 levels. Currently, our city cannot live at its 
own expense. 
  At the same time, new prospects would open for us if the 
Russian Black Sea Fleet base was located in Sevastopol. This 
will provide us with guaranteed wages, resolve the issues of 
unemployment, housing construction, health care, and culture. 
Finally, this will have an impact on the development of the 
spiritual culture of society, bringing up the young generation 
on the heroic traditions of the Russian Fleet. This gives us 
the opportunity to establish direct economic relations between 
Sevastopol -- the chief Russian Black Sea Fleet base -- and 
Russian cities and regions. By the way, we have already 
established contacts with the Southern Rayon in Moscow and 
Krasnogvardeyskiy Rayon in St. Petersburg. 
  [Semenov] Viktor Mikhaylovich, the second round of talks on 
the Black Sea Fleet have been scheduled. What would you wish 
its participants? 
  [Statoverov] I would like that the Black Sea Fleet issue be 
resolved as soon as possible. I would emphasize one more idea: 
The definition of the status of Sevastopol is a prerogative of 
the Russian and Ukrainian leaders, however, I cannot agree that 
this issue can be resolved without the participation of the 
Crimean Supreme Soviet and president, as well as the Sevastopol 
City Council. The residents of Sevastopol hold out hope that 
common sense will prevail over political ambitions, and the 
negotiations will be held in the immediate future. I would like 
to finish our interview with words from the appeal issued by the 
Sevastopol City Council to the fraternal peoples of Russia and 
Ukraine: "The Black Sea Fleet should belong to Russia!" "The 
Black Sea Fleet Base should be located in Sevastopol!"

  [Text] Moscow, 10 May (ITAR-TASS) -- President Boris 
Yeltsin of Russia signed a federal law 8 May "On the status of a 
deputy of the Federation Council and the status of a deputy of 
the State Duma of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly." In 
this connection the president of Russia also sent a letter to 
deputies of the Federation Council and the State Duma. The text 
of this document, which was released by the presidential press 
service today, follows: 
  "Esteemed deputies! 
  "Today I signed the federal law `On the status of a deputy 
of 
the Federation Council and the status of a deputy of the State 
Duma of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly'. 
  "This was a difficult decision, in as far as some juridical 
aspects evidently require further revision and some are not in 
line with the Constitution; and there are prerequisites which 
the electorate could justifiably condemn. 
  "But there is something else I understand, too: you and your 
aides need of the law as a whole, it is necessary for effective 
legislative work. 
  "At the same time I understand that we need to live not only 
in accord with one another, but also in accord with the 
Constitution and the law. I am therefore following up this 
letter with a list of amendments which would have been submitted 
to you had I rejected the law. As guarantor of the 
Constitution, I propose you should suspend the validity of those 
normative acts which contravene the Constitution. Following 
this, I believe it to be necessary to examine the proposals 
submitted, including those which fall within the context of 
conciliation procedures, and to adopt these as amendments to the 
law currently in effect without waiting for decisions of the 
Constitutional Court. 
  "I regard this decision as one of the steps toward 
implementing the Treaty on Public Accord. I therefore believe 
it is necessary to make this letter public. 
  "Esteemed deputies! I am counting on your wisdom and 
understanding, and I hope for further fruitful cooperation." 
  [Signed] B. Yeltsin.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Larisa Kislinskaya] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 11 TASS -- Rumours about "a war of 
monsters" are over-exaggerated, spokesmen for the Russian 
Interior Ministry and the Federal Counterintelligence Service, 
Vladimir Vorozhtsov and Aleksandr Mikhaylov, told a briefing in 
Moscow today. 
  They were referring to press reports about criminal 
proceedings initiated by the Federal Counterintelligence Service 
against some high-ranking officials of the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs. 
  The spokesmen said the federal service had indeed detained 
some officials, including the former official of the Directorate 
for Punitive Action of the Moscow region administration, a 
senior investigator and a lawyer. They were caught in the 
action while handing over a major sum of money in hard currency 
and later charged with an array of crimes. But this does not 
amount to a war between the ministry and the federal service, 
the spokesman said. 
  Last year 359 criminal proceedings were initiated against 
security officials, mostly by the Interior Ministry. Twenty-two 
legal actions were brought jointly with the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service. This year 142 crimes were 
registered by the Interior Ministry. In eight cases, action was 
taken jointly with federal service agents.

<F P=106> [Report by Yaroslav Shimov: "Belorussian Economy's Fate </F>
Will Not Be Decided Before Presidential Elections"] 
  [Text] Minsk-Moscow -- The treaty on Russian-Belorussian 
[Belarusian] monetary union officially came into force 1 May -- 
insofar as the creation of a single customs area on the 
territory of the two states is concerned. There is still a 
great deal of uncertainty over the other aspects of 
Russian-Belorussian economic union. 
  According to a sociological poll conducted by Belorussia's 
[Belarus's] "Public Opinion" service, 66 percent of the 
country's inhabitants back monetary union, while 34 percent are 
against or cannot make up their minds. The idea of economic 
union with the powerful -- compared with Belorussia itself -- 
eastern neighbor is popular with a people who still have a poor 
idea however of what kind of union this is and what it is like. 
The main point is when, where, and at what rate of exchange 
Belorussians will be able to obtain the more stable Russian 
rubles instead of the rapidly devaluing "hares" (the level of 
inflation in March was around 40 percent). 
  Even Belorussia's top leaders cannot provide a clear answer 
to that question now. Supreme Soviet Chairman Mechyslaw Hryb 
did not give IZVESTIYA a specific date for money exchange. So 
Belorussians were fretting for nothing as they tried to get rid 
of "hares" during the first few days following the signing of 
the treaty with Russia. (The current rate of the Russian ruble 
against the local bills of exchange is 1:8.) There is every 
indication that the farewell to the "hare" will not take place 
very soon: There are too many questions over monetary union and 
they still have to be settled. 
  At an extraordinary Supreme Soviet session Belorussian 
deputies made the legislative adjustments necessary to ensure 
that the agreement with Russia works. But the question of the 
National Bank of Belorussia which, as a result of this 
agreement, is reduced to the level of a regional branch of the 
Russian bank, has not been resolved: One of the articles of the 
recently adopted Belorussian Constitution needs to be altered 
for that. People in Minsk are not desperately keen on doing 
that. Mechyslaw Hryb said that during a conversation with him 
the Russian president also remarked that "it is better to work 
on the text of the treaty than change the Constitution." 
  The Supreme Soviet chairman believes that the first stage in 
the implementation of the Russian-Belorussian agreement will 
make it possible to judge whether the treaty is at all workable. 
Although for Mr. Hryb himself the need for economic union with 
Russia remains axiomatic. "Our economic orientation is 
eastward," the Belorussian speaker said. "The form that this 
orientation may take is another matter...." 
  Meanwhile not only one-third of Belorussians polled by 
sociologists, but also the opposition are prey to gnawing doubts 
about the need for an economic treaty with Russia. People's 
Deputy Vladimir Novik, for instance, believes that "Belorussia 
will end up in complete financial isolation as a result of 
monetary union and bound tight to Russia. Russian Government 
strategists, rich financial corporations, and industrial groups 
can then set about sharing out Belorussia's national wealth." 
  Mechyslaw Hryb does not however see any particular problem 
in 
the possibility of Russian capital's active penetration of the 
Belorussian market since this will, in his opinion, "at any rate 
be working for us by producing goods and giving our people 
work." The latter is a particularly pressing issue for the 
Republic since many of Belorussia's enterprises are on the verge 
of closure. 
  Union with Russia, however much it means for Belorussia's 
one-sided economy, can hardly be a panacea for all ills. Their 
own economic reforms are also needed. Whether they will finally 
be implemented and in what direction will not be decided before 
23 June, the day of the presidential elections. The future of 
the Belorussian economy once again rests on the outcome of 
political battles. 
  Just six weeks remain until the election of Belorussia's 
first president, but two possibilities for the future of the 
Belorussian economy are now clear. If a moderate democrat or 
representative of the local "power party" wins, Belorussia can 
expect increasingly close rapprochement with Russia and gradual 
reforms somewhat reminiscent of the course pursued by V. 
Chernomyrdin's Russian Government. If a nationalist or 
Communist candidate is successful that may spell the beginning 
of senseless experiments, which may bring about the downfall of 
this country's economy.

  [Text] In addition to the bemedaled veterans, armed 
military details were to be placed at all Alma-Ata's [Almaty's] 
intersections on Victory Day. An unpublicized state of 
emergency has been introduced in the Kazakhstani capital. Rumor 
has it that this was due to an attack on Bulat Abilov, president 
of the Kazakhstani firm Butya. According to other information, 
the reason was the escape of two convicts. The MVD [Ministry of 
Internal Affairs] attributes it to the complex crime situation 
in Kazakhstan. 
  A city crime-fighting staff has been formed in Alma-Ata. It 
will operate until the capital of Kazakhstan becomes a safe 
city. All hotels, hostels, and suspect apartments are being 
checked over. In the last two days alone 11 kg of opium worth 
around $55,000 have been confiscated. All urban transport 
routes have begun to be "processed" as of yesterday.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 11 ITAR-TASS -- The national press leads 
with reports about the celebrations of Victory Day in Moscow and 
other cities of the country. 
  The newspapers also highlight President Yeltsin's visit to 
Germany which begins today. "Russia and Germany are entering a 
new phase in relations," according to NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. "No 
Russian soldiers will remain stationed in Germany as of this 
year. Their send-off will be an event of great importance both 
for Germany and for Russia. The format of the ceremony will be 
in the focus of talks between Yeltsin and Kohl. The Weimar 
Syndrome, for which Russia is often being rebuked because of its 
reluctance to agree to a farewell ceremony in the city of Goethe 
and Schiller, is not likely to be broached during the talks," 
the newspaper says. 
  The newspaper predicts success to the Russian president's 
visit and points out that even "the unpleasant point related to 
restitution is unlikely to overcloud the talks". 
  PRAVDA ventures in this respect that "Kohl and Yeltsin 
during 
their meeting in Bonn are to take the final decision on the 
ceremony of withdrawal of the Russian troops. Of course, the 
United States, Britain and France are Germany's long-standing 
NATO partners, who, following the blockade of 1948-1949 and the 
building of the Berlin wall, became "Berlin's defenders" against 
the communist menace". But the question now is about summing up 
the final results of the war, in which these three powers were 
Russia's allies, and not about Germany's gratitude to the 
Americans and the British for the airlifts of food to West 
Berlin". 
  As concerns the possible return to Germany of the collection 
of the Gotha Library, PRAVDA says "the most important thing in 
this respect is the creation of a precedent. It is not really 
important what Russia is going to give away this time -- a royal 
collection, a collection of paintings or the Kuril Islands. As 
soon as precedent is there, new and unpredictable claims may 
arise, just as several countries are already claiming the famous 
"Schliemann's gold". 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries a headline "Russian Have Armed 
the Yemenis to the Teeth and Are Now Washing Their Hands" under 
which it analyses the causes of the civil war in that country. 
The hand of Moscow, or rather its absence, pushed Yemen to its 
present political and economic crisis. When it abandon Yemen 
after pumping hundreds of millions of dollars in it, the Kremlin 
decided that Russia does not have any special interests in the 
south Arabian Peninsula". The newspaper stresses that "it is 
now clear that no peace can be established but through a 
political dialogue. Even if the northerners capture the main 
strategic targets, the southerners will probably retreat to the 
desert or the mountains, and the war, judging from the country's 
history, might continue for decades". 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) comments on the same and adds 
that 
"unfortunately, there is little hope for a prompt ending to the 
military actions". "Both the south and the north are swamped 
with guns, which number at least 30 million pieces," the 
newspaper says. "The heavy guns were delivered in plenty by the 
former Soviet Union and other Warsaw Pact countries. Both the 
southerners and the northerners know how to use these guns as 
may of them were trained in Russian military schools and 
academies". 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI carries an analysis of the situation 
before 
the Russian-Chechen negotiations. According to Russian 
Vice-Premier Sergey Shakhray, the negotiations will begin quite 
soon. The delegation from the Russian Federation has worked out 
a position of its own and is ready to get down to work," 
ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI announces. 
  RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA is critical of the past and the future of 
privatisation in the country. "It is now obvious that not only 
the disabled but also able-bodied Russians have a chance of 
joining in the process of redistribution of property," the 
newspaper writes. "The continuing impoverishment of the 
population and the devaluation of labour in recent months have 
finally undercut any possibility for wage-labourers to 
participate in the division of property". 
  TRUD publishes an interview with State Duma deputies Mikhail 
Mityukov and Vladimir Isakov about the law-making process in the 
lower chamber of the Russian parliament.

<F P=106> [Russian Federation president's edict No. 850 "On State </F>
Oversight and Monitoring of the Observance of Russian Federation 
Legislation on Labor and Labor Safety"] 
  [Text] With a view to ensuring the guarantee of citizens' 
constitutional right to labor in conditions which meet safety 
and hygiene requirements and to stepping up oversight and 
monitoring of the observance of Russian Federation legislation 
on labor and labor safety, I decree: 
  1. That it be stipulated that until a legislative act is 
adopted on the state labor inspectorate, state oversight and 
monitoring of the observance of Russian Federation legislation 
on labor and labor safety is implemented by the Russian 
Federation Ministry of Labor's Federal Labor Inspectorate 
(Rostrudinspektsiya) and the state labor inspectorates of 
republics, krays, oblasts, cities of federal importance, the 
autonomous oblast, autonomous okrugs, rayons, and cities which 
are subordinate to it. 
  2. That the state labor law inspectors and state labor 
safety inspectors have the right to visit unimpeded enterprises, 
institutions, and organizations irrespective of their form of 
ownership, to carry out checks on the observance of Russian 
Federation legislation on labor and labor safety, and, within 
the procedure established by Russian Federation legislation on 
administrative law violations, to impose fines on employers, 
officials, and other responsible workers at enterprises, 
institutions, and organizations irrespective of their forms of 
ownership. 
  In implementing their powers state labor law inspectors and 
state labor safety inspectors are independent of state organs 
and officials and are guided only by Russian Federation laws and 
other normative legal acts. 
  3. The leader of the Rostrudinspektsiya is the chief state 
labor inspector of the Russian Federation, appointed to and 
released from his post by the Russian Federation president. 
  The leaders of state labor inspectorates and state labor law 
inspectors and state labor safety inspectors are appointed to 
and released from their posts by the Russian Federation chief 
state labor inspector. 
  4. The Russian Federation Government must within a month: 
  submit a draft statute on the Rostrudinspektsiya; 
  determine the procedure and terms for the remuneration, 
material and consumer backup, and medical services for state 
employees in the Rostrudinspektsiya central apparatus in line 
with the relevant procedure and terms stipulated for state 
employees in the central apparatuses of federal ministries; 
  submit proposals for the ratification of the International 
Labor Organizations's convention on labor inspection (1947) and 
the International Labor Organization convention on regulating 
labor issues (1978) and also for the modifying and supplementing 
the Russian Soviet Federal Socialist Republic code on 
administrative law violations, the Russian Federation code of 
labor laws, and the fundamental principles of Russian Federation 
legislation on labor safety.

<F P=106> [Leonid Brodskiy report: "A Minister To Be in Charge of </F>
Shakhovskoy Rayon"] 
  [Excerpts] Boris Yeltsin has chosen a form of 
encouragement of opposition party leaders that is rather unusual 
for Russian political realities. Late on 6 May, the president's 
press service circulated a communique on the appointment of 
Nikolay Travkin as member of the government. The Democratic 
Party leader has become the first minister without portfolio in 
the history of modern Russia. 
  Nikolay Travkin, 48. Leader of the Democratic Party of 
Russia; head of Moscow Oblast's Shakhovskoy Rayon administration 
since 1992. Received secondary education at the Building 
Technical School in Klin, and higher education at the 
Pedagogical Institute in Kolomna. A Hero of Socialist Labor. 
[passage omitted] 
  Boris Yeltsin's haste in appointing Travkin to a position 
that does not yet exist is quite easily explainable. Travkin, 
who usually criticizes the government rather sharply, has 
surprisingly easily agreed to accept this figurehead position 
for purely juridical reasons. Being a State Duma deputy, he has 
no right to combine work in parliament with the duties of head 
of administration of Shakhovskoy Rayon. Now that he has the 
status of minister, he can do so. As for Boris Yeltsin, this 
gave him a fine opportunity to demonstrate his magnanimity 
toward leaders of the opposition who, in moment of need, show 
loyalty necessary for the president. In other words, Travkin's 
appointment as member of the government can be seen as a payment 
to the Democratic Party of Russia leader for having signed the 
agreement on social accord. 
  "The odd man out" in the story of the appointment of a new 
member of the government is, paradoxically, the head of 
government. Rumors of the impending replacement of Yefim Basin, 
chairman of the Construction Committee, with Nikolay Travkin 
that appeared shortly before the signing of the agreement could 
not naturally go past the premier. It is, however, obvious that 
he could not consent to the replacement of a politically loyal 
and experienced construction general (Basin in the past was in 
charge of the Baykal-Amur Railroad project) with a half-teacher, 
half-builder. Viktor Chernomyrdin could after all prevent the 
negative impact of Travkin's appointment to a more important 
position in the government. But he has not yet succeeded in 
solving the other problems -- which job in the White House would 
correspond with Travkin's present status (in addition to running 
Shakhovskoy Rayon), and what to do about potential ministers 
without portfolio Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, Gennadiy Zyuganov, and 
Mikhail Lapshin who have not yet signed the agreement.

  [Excerpt] Today, the official visit of a Latvian Government 
delegation to France continued. The delegation is led by Prime 
Minister Valdis Birkavs. During the visit, there was discussion 
with French officials of the possibilities for the two 
countries' cooperation in the economic, defense, and security 
spheres, as well as Latvia's participation in the European 
stability pact. Today Birkavs met French Prime Minister Edouard 
Balladur. Birkavs tells us about this from Paris, specially for 
Latvian Radio: 
  [Begin Birkavs recording] Here the main achievement is that 
within the framework of the European stability pact, (?we have 
gained) certain political guarantees in connection with the 
agreement signed on 30 April. It is clear to us that after 
signing a (?free) agreement on the European Union, France and 
Germany together support the signing of a treaty of association 
with the European Union this year. When we started talking 
about the Council of Europe, in which Latvia must also 
participate, the French side believed it was a question that was 
not to be discussed practically, because only a citizenship law 
is necessary, and we immediately received the support of 
European countries in this connection. What is also very 
positive is that we have attained the role of associate partner 
in the Western European Union [WEU], and that gives (?the right) 
to take part in the military operations of the WEU, their 
planning, in direct contacts with the planning office of the 
WEU, and also a whole range of issues connected with Latvia's 
security. [end recording] [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 88 (578); </F>
compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by 
Vladimir Shishlin] 
  [Text] President Lennart Meri believes unacceptable the 
threat of use of military methods by one UN member towards 
another UN member. This is utterly inadmissible in the United 
Nations, the CSCE, where Estonia plays an active role, he said. 
  This is how the Estonian president commented in an interview 
granted to the national television on the recent statement by 
Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev who said that Russian 
servicemen will stay in Estonia as much time as they are needed, 
and the contingent will be increased if there is need to protect 
military sites. 
  Meri is sure that the possible threat of the increase in the 
number of the Russian troops in Estonia should be the subject of 
discussion at the conference of foreign ministers of the Baltic 
States Council due to open on May 25. 
  On Monday Meri summoned Russian Ambassador in Estonia 
Aleksandr Trofimov and demanded that he should provide official 
explanations on Grachev's statement. 
  A spokesman for the Estonian president has told Interfax 
that 
Meri told the Russian diplomat that Estonia would continue to 
maintain neighborly relations with Russia, which has always been 
the main aim of the state's foreign policy. 
  Trofimov promised to provide explanations shortly. 
  Meanwhile, the spokeswoman for the Estonian Foreign 
Ministry, 
Mari-Ann Rikken described the statement by the Russian Defense 
Minister as an attempt to add pressure on Estonia's position in 
terms of the Russian troops pull-out. She described Grachev 
words as "the pressure on a small republic which is not in line 
with Russia's intention to solve problems in the spirit of 
compromise." 
  The spokeswoman believes the statement was timed to coincide 
to the 19 round of the inter-state talks which ended on the same 
day (May 6) near Tallinn. At the talks the pull-out problem was 
the main one. Rikken said that the failure of the talks where, 
contrary to expectations, the package of agreements on the 
pull-out was not initialed, "was not accidental". Russia's 
toughened stance towards the pull-out treaty which was drafted 
several rounds before, reflect the sentiments reigning in the 
Defence and Foreign ministries of Russia. 
  The spokeswoman said that Grachev's statement was probably 
intended by Russia to probe the reaction in the world. IF Note: 
The chairman of the Lithuanian parliament in an interview with 
Interfax expressed hope that Grachev statement reflects his 
personal view, not the position of President Yeltsin. "The 
delay with the pull-out, the more so, the deployment of an 
additional contingent, would be not only the manifestation of 
pressure on the sovereign state, but the ignorance of the 
opinion of the world public, the violation of the laws 
registered in the UN documents, the CSCE and other authoritative 
international organizations, he said.

  [Text] In the opinion of Butrus Butrus-Ghali, UN secretary 
general, conditions for deploying UN forces in Abkhazia are not 
available, but the Security Council could discuss the issue of 
putting Russian peace-keeping forces there to secure the return 
of refugees and carry out sowing work. Regulating the 
Georgian-Abkhaz conflict is possible only by means of resolving 
three issues which are closely linked with each other: a 
political settlement, the return of refugees, and creating 
forces for securing peace. 
  The UN secretary general stressed success in the political 
sphere will only be possible if refugees start to return to 
their homes, which, in itself, is connected with carrying out 
peace-keeping operations. 
  The sowing season is about to start and if it is missed, by 
the end of the year, the situation will be even harder. However, 
noted Butrus-Ghali, it has become clear that a wide-scale return 
of refugees and the forcibly displaced cannot take place until 
the international military presence in Abkhazia's rayons, where 
refugees and the displaced will be returning, is secured. 
Without this international presence, they are not ready to 
trust in the readiness and the ability of the Abkhaz authorities 
to secure their safety. That is why, stated Butrus-Ghali, the 
issue of deployment of international forces is a very urgent one. 
  "The Russian Federation has reported its readiness to deploy 
an advanced contingent of the United Nations, if the Security 
Council adopts the decision on creating it. I am proceeding 
from the fact that this contingent of several hundreds of 
military servicemen could be put in the rayon during several 
days after the Security Council adopts the resolution on its 
deployment," stated Butrus Ghali.

  [Text] The official visit [to Germany] by Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin beginning Wednesday cannot be described as 
"traditional", aide to the Russian president on foreign affairs, 
Dmitriy Ryurikov has told INTERFAX. Despite the fact that 
during the visit the two sides are to sign documents, for 
example, on economic cooperation, "the developing of a concept 
of relations between our countries in the post-confrontational 
period" will occupy the main place in the talks between 
President Yeltsin and leading German politicians, said the 
president's aide. 
  In view of this concept the two sides will consider the 
peculiarities of the new stage in Russian-German cooperation, as 
well as problems associated with the final withdrawal of the 
Russian troops from Federal Germany before August, 1994, said 
Ryurikov. He made it clear that a change of the initial "modest 
form" of Russian troop withdrawal from Germany may be one of the 
results of the discussion of the pullout's fine points. 
  The discussion during Yeltsin's visit "of the modality of 
the 
Russian-German relations for the coming years," believes 
Ryurikov, must lay a stable foundation for the entire system of 
contacts between the states, their economic circles, and between 
individuals. 
  Ryurikov believes that the German Chancellor's invitation to 
President Yeltsin to visit his native land is the response by 
Helmut Kohl for last year's trip with Yeltsin to Lake Baykal. 
Such meetings of the leaders "in the provinces of both 
countries" enhance better understanding of the spirit of both 
countries and peoples, said Ryurikov. 
  He said that experts responsible for concrete issues, which 
Yeltsin plans to consider during the visit, are members of the 
Russian delegation. The visit's schedule provides for meetings 
and talks between Yeltsin and Chancellor Helmut Kohl, German 
President Richard von Weizsacker, Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, 
Prime Minister of Baden-Wurttemberg, Erwin Teufel, chairman of 
the German Social Democratic Party, Rudolph Scharping, as well 
as meetings with leading business people of Germany.

  [Text] As Interfax learned from well-informed sources in 
Russia's Foreign Ministry, during his visit to Germany on May 
11-13 President Boris Yeltsin will try to talk the Germans into 
conducting the ceremony of farewell to the Russian troops in 
Berlin, not in Weimar. "The President is firmly resolved to 
reach this goal," a high-ranking Russian diplomat told Interfax. 
  According to him, "there is no logic in conducting the 
ceremony of farewell to the Western allies in Berlin, a city 
conquered by Soviet troops, and saying farewell to the Russians 
in Weimar, a city conquered by the allied troops." 
  As he said, "the striving to say farewell to the Russians in 
Weimar, where no Reichstag was stormed and no victory banner was 
hoisted, reflects the desire to erase from the memory of the 
Germans some history chapters, particularly the quadrilateral 
allied responsibility for Germany." 
  The issue of Russia's Kaliningrad Region may also be 
discussed during President Yeltsin's visit to Germany, the 
diplomat said. "This may take place during his confidential 
conversation with Chancellor Helmut Kohl," he said. 
  Moscow's attitude to Kaliningrad and Kaliningrad Region 
remains unchanged, Interfax's interviewee stressed. "This is 
Russian land, and we shall surrender it to no one," he pointed 
out. 
  According to Interfax's interviewee, "some circles in 
Germany 
are trying to kindle the issue concerning Kaliningrad's status 
in the hope that in the future it will become possible to raise 
it officially." "There will be no such possibility," he 
stressed. 
  The diplomat spoke in favor of "levelling up" ties between 
Kaliningrad Region and Germany. "It's clear that Germany, 
because of its economic might at least, will be ahead of Sweden 
or, say, Lithuania in trade with Kaliningrad Region. However, 
in terms of economic cooperation, Kaliningrad Region must not 
and will not be oriented solely to Germany," he noted.

  [Text] Head of the Odessa Military District press service, 
Vyacheslav Voronkov, stated in an interview with INTERFAX today 
that there were practically no Black Sea Fleet units remaining 
in Odessa. 
  He said the situation in the first brigade of defense of the 
Ukrainian Navy area (the former 318th Black Sea Fleet division) 
was calm. "The planned work was supervised by the new 
commander, Second Rank Captain Marchenko," Voronkov pointed out. 
  The Ukrainian Navy First brigade was set up on 12 April 
1994, 
on the basis of the dismissed 318th Black Sea Fleet division. 
The Ukrainian military leadership undertook this measure after 
the division had got involved in the incident with the Cheleken 
boat which had withdrawn hydro geographical equipment from 
Odessa without the consent of Ukraine. A total of eighteen 
servicemen of the division (most of them are officers) refused 
to swear the oath of allegiance to Ukraine and expressed their 
desire to serve in the Russian fleet. 
  The Black Sea Fleet command repeatedly stated that it had 
warned the Ukrainian authorities about the boat leaving Odessa 
and considered this action as a seizure. 
  Voronkov said former commander of the 318th division, 
Captain 
First Rank Oleg Feoktistov and other officers unwilling to swear 
the oath of allegiance to Ukraine had been transferred to Russia 
to continue their service. Feoktistov will serve on Novaya 
Zemlya (Arctic Ocean). The others will continue their service 
in Novosibirsk.

  [Text] Even on days off the upcoming elections of the first 
Belarusian president remain a popular topic among Vitebsk 
residents. The Vitebsk independent sociological agency Istina 
decided to make some preliminary conclusions regarding the 
results of its nonofficial poll. It conducted a selective phone 
poll of 364 Vitebsk residents. Already at the start the 
sociologists discovered an interesting detail: In Vitebsk 
primarily women hold control over home phones. Therefore, the 
prevailing majority of respondents is represented by the best 
half of mankind of various age and professions. They gave their 
sympathies to three leading politicians: Alyaksandr Lukashenka, 
Vyachaslaw Kebich, and Stanislaw Shushkevich. The remaining 
candidates for this prestigious post were much behind the 
leaders. Almost half of the respondents link their hopes for 
improving the situation in society and the economy with the 
president. However, one fourth of the respondents did not 
express any positive emotions regarding this issue.

  [Text] With the deadline for the signature-collecting 
campaign being only three days away, three main candidates for 
the Belarussian presidency have already submitted a list of 
100,000 signatures to the central election commission. They are 
Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich, Communist Party Chief Vassiliy 
Novikov and leader of the opposition People's Front Zenon 
Pozniak. 
  Also about to do so are former Parliamentary Chairman 
Stanislav Shushkevich and leader of the People's Accord Party 
Gennadiy Karpenko. 
  In the meantime, members of the monitoring commission of 
pro-democracy parties and movements have stated a number of 
irregularities in the election campaign. The commission 
maintains that the interior ministry was instructed to ensure 
that members of the police force should vote in favor of the 
prime minister; the defence minister at a recent meeting told 
his subordinates to vote for Kebich and against Shushkevich and 
chairman of the anti-corruption commission Aleksandr Lukashenko; 
and the collection of signatures at a number of plants in Minsk 
was held under management pressure. 
  Local observers say as the battle between presidential 
candidates becomes more uncompromising as the campaign is 
drawing to a close. 
  In a recent interview, Shushkevich accused the prime 
minister 
of trying to shift the responsibility for economic collapse, 
mismanagement and failure to carry out market reforms on the 
Russian Government and taxpayers. He said Kebich's drive for a 
closer union with Russia was used as a cover up to try to divert 
attention away from genuine government corruption from top to 
bottom. 
  On the monetary union with Russia, Shushkevich said that 
"all 
of the Russian rubles will flow back to Moscow currency 
exchanges in a week's time to cause further inflation in Russia 
and shortage of rubles and non-payment of wages in Belarus". He 
said that many in Russia were well aware of this. 
  The withdrawal of 400 members of the White Russ Slav 
Assembly 
from the support group collecting signatures in favor of 
Alexander Lukashenko came as a bomb shell, local observers say. 
  The Assembly's sudden change of heart follows WR's 
allegations saying that "Lukashenko and his associates have been 
speaking of their opposition to integration with Russia and a 
monetary union with Moscow."

<F P=106> [Report by Syarhey Chyslaw under the "Party Activists" </F>
rubric: "Democracy Under the Lash"] 
  [Text] The Civilian Control Commission [Hramadzkaya 
Kantrolnaya Kamisiya -- HKK], which was created by democratic 
parties and movements to safeguard the integrity of the 
elections, has held a regular session. An increase in the 
authority of this public association -- which was created at the 
initiative of the Belarusian Association of Servicemen with the 
United Democratic Party of Belarus, the Belarusian Popular 
front, the Belarusian Social Democratic Assembly, the Belarusian 
Peasant Party, the Belarusian Christian Democratic Union, the 
National Democratic Party of Belarus, the Party of People's 
Accord, and the Association of Belarusian Language -- was 
evidenced by the fact that it was joined by the United Agrarian 
Democratic Party, the Union of Entrepreneurs, the Belarusian 
Association of Invalids, and the Belarusian Environmental Party. 
  Participants in the session discussed the issues of 
expanding 
HKK structures throughout the Republic and concentrated their 
attention on fraud committed by certain individuals seeking 
nominations for president. With regard to these facts, the 
following press statement was released: 
  "Mr. Kebich's initiative group was being formed through 
state 
power structures. Indicative of this is an example in the city 
of Zhlobin, where a local school teacher, at his own request, 
was included in Shushkevich's initiative group. Later, it 
turned out that the same teacher, without being asked for his 
consent, was included in Kebich's support group as well. In 
this man's opinion, initiative groups in support of Kebich were 
created according to the so-called telephone rule [not further 
identified]. 
  "During the recent session of the Defense Ministry 
Collegium, 
the defense minister of the Republic of Belarus was openly 
campaigning in support of Kebich as well as against Shushkevich 
and Lukashenka, regardless of the fact that our Army is to 
remain outside of politics. 
  "At the Academy of Physical Training, the signature campaign 
in support of Kebich is being conducted under an order from the 
dean. 
  "Commanders of the Interior Troops have given orders to 
their 
subordinates to ensure that Interior Troop personnel vote for 
Kebich. 
  "Managers of the enterprises, which are members of the 
Belarusian Scientific and Industrial Association and support Mr. 
Kebich, are trying to put under their control the creation of 
district electoral commissions." 
  By the way, the HKK may be contacted by telephone at 
36-09-09.

  [Text] One can count days until the termination of the 
first stage of the presidential campaign -- the collection of 
signatures in support of candidates for the office of the first 
Belarusian president. As a BELINFORM reporter has learned, few 
of the candidates for the state's top post will clear the hurdle 
of amassing 100,000 signatures. For example, as of 11 May, the 
signature hurdle was cleared only by enthusiasts supporting 
Prime Minister Vyachaslaw Kebich and Communist Party Chairman 
Vasyl Novikaw. More than 160,000 Belarusians signed the 
petition in support of the first candidate, and 115,000 of the 
second. According to the number of supporters, the initiative 
group supporting Stanislaw Shushkevich ranks next in line. That 
group has already collected 90,000 signatures. According to the 
headquarters for support of [opposition leader] Zyanon Paznyak, 
it is too early to release information on their campaign. The 
other initiative groups simply do not cooperate with the Central 
Election Committee for Presidential Elections.

  [Text] The Belarusian Trade Union Federation has received 
an answer to its appeal -- containing a proposal to adopt a 
decision on a date for early Supreme Soviet elections -- to 
Supreme Soviet Chairman Mechyslaw Hryb. The answer reads: The 
issue has been discussed by the Supreme Soviet Commission for 
State-Building. A decision to shift the discussion of the draft 
law on introducing changes and addenda to the Law of the 
Republic of Belarus on Electing People's Deputies was adopted 
during a regular meeting of the 13th session. Together with the 
discussion of this draft law, a draft resolution on fixing a 
date for Belarusian Supreme Soviet elections will be discussed. 
It will include a date for these elections, the answer reads. 
As for the opening date of the regular session, it is unlikely 
that it will be held before we learn the name of the first 
Belarusian president. This will probably [words indistinct].

by head of our state. He described it as an interesting and 
promising proposal. On his behalf, Kanat Saudabayev emphasized

  [Text] A situation close to disastrous has taken shape in 
Kazakhstan's fuel and energy complex. Its imported fuel debts 
have topped $117 million. Reporting this, the Republic's 
business newspaper PANORAMA gives the list of Kazakhstan's 
energy creditors, which are Kirgizia [Kyrgyzstan], Turkmenistan, 
Uzbekistan, and Russia. The lion's share of the debts falls on 
the Uzbek side: Kazakhstan owes it more than $100 million for 
the use of natural gas and electricity.

  [Text] Activities by the present Kyrgyz Government in 
certain spheres are practically a failure, the Kyrgyz 
president's press service said in its statement circulated in 
Bishkek today. 
  The statement underlined that improvement of the system of 
taxation and establishment of the state budget was the main task 
of any government. The statement emphasized that since the 
state budget was not receiving taxes it could not pay wages to 
physicians, teachers, artists, and scientists. This limits the 
opportunities for the state in providing social security for 
pensioners, students and other not well-off categories of the 
population. However, the government continues to finance 
unprofitable enterprises which cannot sell their production 
freezing significant financial funds. 
  The unjustified decrees in the purchasing capacity of the 
population hampers to sell products even if the actual demand 
for it exists. This aggravates the crisis in the Kyrgyz society 
and economy. The present situation lays the agreements with 
international financial organizations like the IMF and the World 
Bank open to possibility of a wreck in what concerns the 
financing of the economic and social reforms. No preferential 
financial resources could be attracted to the Republic under 
such circumstances. 
  The statement also pointed out that the position and the 
moves of the government were absolutely illogical within the 
context of the aggravating economic and social situation. The 
government, however, keeps deferring works on development of the 
gold deposits with the participation of foreign investors for 
mutual benefits. Primarily, this means the delay in joint 
development of the Kumtor gold deposit with the participation of 
the Canadian Cameco company.

  [Text] Republican economic entities have run into debt 
amounting to millions of soms in customs dues for barter deals 
to the state. Staff at the Kyrgyz Customs Directorate are 
facing now the task of recovering this money from commercial 
structures and enterprises. This has been said by Anatoliy 
Linishenko, head of the Republican Customs Directorate, during a 
briefing at government house. Over the last year 32 million 
soms in customs duty were paid to the state budget, which 
comprises around 20-30 percent of the possible volume of customs 
dues. The reasons for this are inefficiency of the Customs 
Directorate, the open border with Tajikistan, gross violations 
of customs rules by a great number of commercial organizations, 
and other reasons.

  [Text] The Movement of Islamic Rebirth of Tajikistan was 
prepared to consider the draft agreement on a temporary 
cease-fire on the Tajik-Afghan border and will implement it 
after the agreement is signed. This was said in a statement 
circulated by the movement today. 
  The statement underlined that during the inter-Tajik talks 
in 
Moscow in April the opposition delegation had put forward a 
draft agreement on a temporary cease-fire. However, the "other 
party had not wanted even to discuss the draft which proved the 
destructive position taken by the Dushanbe regime." 
  The statement also pointed out that the Tajik opposition did 
not threaten security of Tajikistan, Russia, and CIS states. 
"We, Tajik citizens temporarily situated beyond the borders of 
our Republic, want to go back to our Motherland and live in our 
houses," the statement said. 
  "Real threat for Tajikistan and other CIS states stems from 
the forces hampering the peace settlement of the conflict," the 
statement emphasized. It also stressed that the opposition 
sought political settlement of the conflict. "We have nothing 
against the CIS Joint Peacekeeping Forces stationed in 
Tajikistan for defense from external offensives." 
  "Our struggle is not aimed against any particular country. 
This is a conflict between the Tajik opposition and a narrow 
circle of people made us leave our Republic," the statement 
underlined.

  Mr. Turajonzadeh praised the Islamic Republic of Iran's

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] Turkmenistan has embarked on the road of 
independence and intends in no way to deviate from it, said 
President Saparmurad Niyazov, 54, speaking with a group of 
Moscow journalists. 
  We are building a democratic state which, however, takes 
into 
account specific national features, he said. The main task of 
the country's leadership, he said, is formulated in the slogan 
"A Decade of Stability," which began in 1992. 
  Niyazov said that the economic reforms carried out in 
Turkmenistan, do not infringe upon the interests of the majority 
of the population--the country's citizens use free running 
water, gas, electric energy. In addition, each citizen of the 
country has the right for 146 kilos of free flour a year. 
  The president assured journalists that Turkmenistan enjoys 
freedom of speech and human rights are observed. However, he 
said, this should not run counter to the moral norms of the 
nation and centuries-old traditions. Niyazov voiced complaints 
to some news media in Russia, for example, to television, where 
on show is mainly pornography and sex. 
  Answering the question of what he thinks about worshipping 
of 
his personality in Turkmenistan, he said that in the country 
there is no such notion as personality cult. I do not consider 
myself a special person. I am a human being like all others. 
  Niyazov claims that since 1985 when he came to power, there 
was not a single case of prosecuting dissidents. We have no 
political prisoners, he said. 
  He said that the country needs a leader who, together will 
like minded people, may take up courage to solve historic tasks. 
We are going through a very difficult period in our history, 
said Niyazov. 
  He admitted that he was not satisfied with the admiring 
attitude to his personality. He said that he asked parliament 
not to celebrate his birthday for the period of his presidency 
at least. 
  Honestly, this is a burden for me. I believe we shall come 
to think about this again. Nevertheless, if there is no 
imposition, I do not see reasons for a ban for such treatment to 
the state leader, said Niyazov. 
  According to the Turkmen leader, he is tolerant to criticism 
if it refers to his activities. I do not like biassed personal 
criticism, said the president.

  [Text] Yesterday, President Islam Karimov received a 
delegation from the Swiss bank Credit Suisse led by Rayner Gut, 
chairman of the Council of Directors. During the two sides 
discussed the successful development of mutually beneficial ties 
between Uzbekistan and the world famous bank Credit Suisse. 
Exchange of views took place on developing these contacts. The 
leader of Uzbekistan noted the expediency of opening a Credit 
Suisse branch in Tashkent, stating that this would become an 
important factor in the expansion and deepening of mutual 
cooperation. 
  Rayner Gut spoke about the readiness of Credit Suisse to 
contribute toward developing the Uzbek economy, including the 
training of highly qualified specialists in banking for our

  [Text] Despite the declaration of a cease-fire as of 0000 
on 9 May, the Armenian side launched new combat operations in 
the Agdamskiy Rayon sector of the front line at 0900 today. 
Following a preparatory artillery bombardment, the enemy 
attacked Akhmadagaly in Agdamskiy Rayon. Armored vehicles 
supported the onslaught. Violent clashes are taking place 
around that town at the present time. 
  Uninterrupted positional fighting has continued in 
Gorenboyskiy, Terterskiy, and Fizulinskiy Rayons during the past 
two days. The Armenians suffered many casualties in their 
unsuccessful attacks against Gorenboy. The enemy units lost 
more than 50 men. They abandoned 12 machine guns and grenade 
launchers and fled from the battlefield. 
  The border observation posts in Kedabekskiy Rayon were fired 
on from Armenia last night. The enemy also fired on our 
positions in the Omer Pass region in the northern part of 
Kelbadzharskiy Rayon.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vadim Byrkin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow 12 May TASS -- A new cease-fire agreement 
beginning on midnight from 11 to 12 May has been mediated among 
the warring sides by Russia and the CSCE at talks in Moscow. 
  Russian envoy on Karabakh settlement Vladimir Kazimirov told 
TASS on Thursday that in contrast to the last cease-fire, which 
was unilaterally declared by Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan, 
the latest one is a commitment of three parties, a compromise 
brokered by mediators among Azerbaijan, Armenia and 
Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  "Multiple violations of previous agreements put the trust to 
political will of the leaders of the sides under a serious 
test," Kazimirov admitted. 
  He said that the agreement was signed by defence ministers 
of 
Azerbaijan, Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh. The Russian Foreign 
Ministry welcomes the cease-fire and insists on its 
unconditional fulfilment by all parties, he added. 
  "It is necessary to ensure a radical breakthrough in the 
situation, a firm turn towards peace, to consolidate armistice 
by reliable and legally-binding agreements on the final end of 
the armed conflict," the envoy stressed. 
  So far there have been no reports about violations of the 
cease-fire. 
  Later in the day Kazimirov, Chairman of the CSCE Minsk Group 
for Karabakh Jan Elison and his deputy Mathias Mosberg are 
leaving for the conflict area to meet leaders of Azerbaijan, 
Armenia, and Nagorno-Karabakh.

<F P=106> ["Text" of a statement by National Security Minister Neriman </F>
Imranov in Baku on 10 May -- recorded] 
  [Text] We all know the work President Geydar Aliyev has 
carried out during the past few months to find a peaceful 
solution to the Karabakh dispute. He has told the world that he 
is prepared to work to have the Karabakh dispute peacefully 
resolved, providing the Armenians agree to withdraw from 
Azerbaijan's occupied territories, the peaceful people are 
allowed to return to their property, the state border between 
Azerbaijan and Armenia is reinstated, and Karabakh's 
administrative, political, and economic status is outlined. 
  But the Armenian occupiers, who pretend to support peace, do 
not intend to withdraw from Azerbaijan's territory. Instead, 
they want to intensify and broaden the war. They want to occupy 
more territory in Azerbaijan. 
  The Armenian leaders' adventuring initiative during the past 
few days is disgusting. The ruling circles in Armenia and the 
political parties that support them have decided to establish 
Armenian cities and towns in Azerbaijan's occupied territories, 
including Kelbadzharskiy, Kubatlinskiy, and other rayons, by 
transferring Armenian families from Armenia and several CIS 
countries to settle in them. 
  How do the Armenian ruling circles plan to achieve that? As 
the first step, they have allocated land to the families they 
have already transferred to the rayons. They have given them 
long-term and interest-free credits and exempted their sons who 
reach conscription age from military service. They have also 
met the travel expenses of the Armenians who arrive to settle in 
Azerbaijan's rayons and taken measures to educate their sons in 
Armenia and several countries in Europe. 
  All that is a part of a planned adventurist policy to seize 
Azerbaijan's territory. Azerbaijan's people must know that 
policy's intentions and objectives. Azerbaijan's president, 
leaders, and people will not allow them to achieve their goals. 
The Armenian occupiers' policy is a defiance of the entire 
world. Considering that, Azerbaijan's people, regardless of 
their nationality, religion, and social standing, and regardless 
of which political party they support, must rally around the 
Republic's president and wage a united struggle against the 
occupiers. That is what is required.

  [Text] Baku 11 May TASS--The parliament and government of 
the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic of Azerbaijan issued an 
ultimatum to the local section of the Popular Front on Wednesday 
[11 May], demanding it to stop unlawful actions aimed at 
destabilising the situation in the Ordubad District of the 
Republic. 
  The Nakhichevan authorities also said that they will appeal 
to Azerbaijani President Heydar Aliyev to impose a state of 
emergency in the region if the situation is not normalised 
within three days. 
  The situation in the district, home base of ex-President 
Abulfaz Elchibey, worsened two days ago, following the 
appointment of a new head of the administration. Several local 
leaders and deputies refused to obey the new head and called on 
their supporters to follow their suit. 
  A group of front activists tried to seize the building of 
the 
local executive council last night. As a result of a clash with 
the police, several people were injured.

leadership: "Appeal"] 
  [Text] To Mr. Geydar Aliyev, president of the Republic of 
Azerbaijan; Mr. Rasul Guliyev, chairman of the Republic of 
Azerbaijan National Assembly; and Mr. Suret Guseynov, prime 
minister of the Republic of Azerbaijan. 
  The Azerbaijani economy is in a crisis condition; those 
citizens who live only on wages have dropped below the poverty 
line. There is no need to comment in detail on the tricky social 
and political problems such poverty has caused or may cause. If 
the impoverishment of the masses continues at the present rate, 
it will eliminate all opportunities for the democratic 
development of society and our Motherland's defense capabilities. 
  The deepening economic crisis and further impoverishment of 
the population are processes that run in parallel and are 
interrelated. The exacerbation of the economic crisis in 
Azerbaijan is caused by both objective and subjective factors. 
At the same time, the currently adopted contradictory decisions 
are a sign of vagueness of the strategic line in the economy. 
  Periodic wage increases for the purpose of neutralizing the 
tricky problems of impoverishment in the end do not solve the 
problem, since the pace of wage increases lags far behind the 
pace of increases in the cost of living. Thus, the main burden 
of economic decline falls on the shoulders of the low-income 
strata of the population, while the persons and state bodies 
whose responsibility it is to avert the crisis apparently are 
relieved of the need to conduct a firm economic policy. This 
situation cannot continue for long, however. 
  While expressing our concern in connection with the current 
situation, we believe it necessary to implement the law on wage 
indexation for the purpose of averting a further worsening of 
the population's standard of living. This law by itself cannot 
help to improve the material situation of those living on earned 
wages. By setting up a mechanism for its implementation, it is 
possible to freeze the current difficult material situation of 
the workers and avert a further worsening of it. If we begin to 
implement this law, the persons and structures currently 
shirking their responsibility for governing at the expense of a 
decline in the popular standard of living will be forced to 
conduct decisive, well-thought-out, comprehensive political 
reforms.

<F P=106> [AZERTADZH report: "Russian State Duma Delegation Headed by </F>
Sergey Baburin Visits Azerbaijan"] 
  [Text] Republic of Azerbaijan President Aliyev received a 
Russian State Duma delegation headed by Sergey Baburin, 
coordinator of the Russian Way deputy faction, currently 
visiting Baku. 
  The interlocutors spoke in favor of the restoration, 
development, and strengthening of Azerbaijani-Russian ties in 
all spheres. As the head of the Azerbaijani state put it, the 
two peoples are linked by almost two centuries of history, and 
their relations are steeped in rich traditions. It is wrong to 
discard such a legacy, especially nowadays, when times are so 
difficult for both countries. In his opinion, the difficulties 
they are encountering can be overcome only by joint efforts. 
  Regarding the situation of Russians in Azerbaijan, the 
president emphasized that they are a component part of society 
and full-fledged citizens of the Republic, which is the way it 
has been at all times. 
  According to the Azerbaijani leader, the formation of an 
objective opinion of the situation in the region could be helped 
by a visit by President of Russia Boris Yeltsin. In this 
connection he mentioned that such a proposal had been put 
forward to the head of the Russian state. 
  In turn, Sergey Baburin noted that one of the tasks this 
Duma 
delegation has set for itself is to sort out what is currently 
happening in the conflict zone. In his opinion, A NEGATIVE POINT 
IS THE ABSENCE IN RUSSIA OF COMPLETE INFORMATION ON AZERBAIJAN. 
"We are ready to assist," he said, "in ensuring that truthful 
information reaches politicians both in Russia and in Europe."

  [Text] The process of forming a national army is going on 
at a fast pace, Georgian Defence Minister Vardiko Nadibaidze 
told INTERFAX on Wednesday [11 May]. He said the main focus was 
on discipline and arms procurement rather than show. 
  The minister went on to say that until recently, there was 
no 
regular army as such and the notions such as "brigade, corps or 
regiment" were used in a loose way leading to Georgia's defeat 
in the Abkhazian war. 
  "Without a single command center, it is impossible to 
achieve 
any success," Nadibaidze said. And he added that to the best of 
his knowledge, as many as three Georgian commanders were in 
charge of military operations in Abkhazia. 
  He thinks the national army formed by conscription must 
consist of six or eight separate contingents (armor, motor 
rifle, artillery, air, and naval units), 1,000 to 1,500-strong 
each. "More importantly, they must be mobile and well-trained", 
said the minister. 
  On the Abkhaz conflict, Nadibaidze said he was in favor of a 
political rather than military solution with Russian troops 
playing a major role, especially in providing security 
guarantees to returning refugees. 
  On the relationship between the Georgian and Russian armies, 
Nadibaidze said questions of military cooperation were outlined 
in the appropriate bilateral accords. Initially, this includes 
the training of Georgian military experts in Russia and supply 
of weapons and hardware to the national army. "Parts of those 
joint plants are being implemented," he said. 
  Formerly deputy commander of Russian troops in 
Transcaucasia, 
Nadibaidze was nominated by Eduard Shevardnadze and appointed by 
parliament as the country's new defense minister on 26 April. 
  He was sworn in as minister after a farewell ceremony by 
Russian troops in Tbilisi on 9 May.

  [Text] The Georgian Defense Ministry Press Service made the 
following statement: Russia's Ostankino television program, 
Novosti, based on Abkhaz sources, on 10 May, in effect, 
broadcast misinformation alleging the entry of Georgian armed 
groups into the Gali rayon. The same source asserts that 250 
armed Georgian fighters are operating in the Gali rayon. 
  The Press Service of the Georgian Defense Ministry is 
authorized to state that this news does not correspond to the 
truth. Similar information, based on Abkhaz sources, has been 
broadcast many times before. In this particular case, it aims 
at a specific target -- to separate or wreck Georgian-Abkhaz 
talks on peaceful settlement that started today in Moscow.

  [Text] The Georgian and Abkhazian delegations to the 
settlement talks held in Moscow today signed a document on 
setting up a joint coordinating commission responsible for 
issues of mutual interest in power engineering, transportation, 
communications, environmental protection, etc. This statement 
was made by a member of the Abkhazian delegation, representative 
of Abkhazia in Moscow Igor Akhba, in an interview with INTERFAX 
Wednesday [11 May]. 
  Akhba said the commission which would be composed of four 
members from each side will start its work in Sochi on 1 June. 
  Akhba said he was confident the talks would produce an 
agreement to establish a cease-fire and troop separation on 12 
May. The final variant of the agreement had already been 
prepared, he said. The document provides for the deployment of 
peacekeeping forces along the river Inguri, the line of 
confrontation between Georgian and Abkhazian troops. Before the 
deployment, the two sides are to separate their troops each by 
12 km from the river. 
  According to Akhba, it was decided that the CIS peacekeeping 
forces would be deployed in the area. "It is more likely that it 
will be a Russian contingent," he said. U.N. officials will 
act as observers. 
  Akhba pointed out that the decision to deploy CIS 
peacekeepers in Abkhazia should be taken by CIS states in 
response to an appeal by the participants of the talks. If the 
agreement is signed, such an appeal may be sent as early as 
Thursday. Akhba did not preclude that in this case the decision 
to deploy the peacekeepers in the conflict area might be made 
within the next five days.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze has said that 
the republic's legislation is outdated. In a message to 
parliament, the Georgian leader asked deputies to take urgent 
measures to form new economic relations. This is an obligatory 
condition for the formation and development of the Georgian 
statehood, he believes. 
  Shevardnadze says in his message that the government is to 
submit shortly to parliament three different types of bills 
which should be given particular attention. 
  The first package refers to economic relations, the second 
one to the bills on legal guarantees for the protection of the 
rights of the economic subjects which take part in material 
relations. The third package has laws which, in line with the 
democratic course chosen by Georgia, should regulate 
relationships among branches of power. 
  The message says that parliament should adopt also codes of 
civil laws, criminal and labor laws as well as laws on 
administrative violations of laws. 
  As the speaker of parliament I am prepared, to speed up the 
process of law-making, to cooperate with all commissions, 
factions and individual deputies, says the message.

  [Text] Conscription of Georgian personnel for the Russian 
border troops on Georgian territory has begun according to an 
agreement between Georgia and Russia on the joint protection of 
borders. 
  Colonel Vladimir Berezin, deputy chief of the "Gruziya" 
["Georgia"] group of forces of the Caucasus Special Border 
District, said that at the initial stage Georgian citizens will 
account for 10 percent of the group's strength -- in May-June 
350 young Georgians will be conscripted into the Russian border 
units. In the future, the entire length of the Georgian-Turkish 
border will be protected by Georgian units.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Irina Schegoleva] </F>
  [Text] Sochi 11 May TASS--"The process of refugees' return 
to Abkhazia is already on, without waiting for the results of 
the work done by the Commission for Refugees and Displaced 
People," head of the Abkhazian delegation Leonid Lakerbaya told 
ITAR-TASS today after the commission resumed its work. 
According to Lakerbaya, about 24 thousand people have returned 
to the Galski District alone from areas controlled by Georgia. 
  Members of the commission have begun reviewing the 
registration procedures of the people wishing to return to 
Abkhazia. They are also discussing legal aspects of the issue. 
  "We demand only one thing: At the time of filling 
registration papers these people must commit themselves to 
respect laws of the Republic of Abkhazia and must not take up 
arms against lawful authorities," Leonid Lakerbaya added. 
  "We know the mood of our population. We are very much 
alarmed, when the talk turns to a massive inflow of refugees. 
The Republic cannot accept all people at once, as houses are 
destroyed, and there is a shortage of food and fuel. We are 
prepared to accept refugees, but in those settlements, where 
specific conditions have been created for settling them. We 
will continue this work, but in stages and without unwarranted 
hurry," the Abkhazian vice-premier noted. 
  The parties considerably differ on determining the number of 
refugees who intend to return. For example, the protocol of the 
expert group session on the question of registration procedures, 
the number of refugees is shown to be 290 thousand. At the same 
time it is assumed that 250,000 people must return to Abkhazia 
from areas controlled by Georgia. 
  The Abkhazian side emphasises that currently there are no 
more than 120,000 people in Georgia, who were forced to leave 
Abkhazia, and another 65,000 in Russia. Thus, according to 
Abkhazian records, the total number of refugees, who would wish 
to return, does not exceed 185,000. 
  The commission plans to hold its next session on 30 May to 
discuss the question of determining the extent of losses 
suffered by refugees and forced migrants.

turned to U.N. structures, foreign governments and international 
organizations after Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev's 
remarks on May 6 that Russia may suspend army withdrawal from 
Estonia or even bring in additional troops, opposition MP Peeter 
Lorents said. 
  "Unluckily it seems that this was done neither on May 6 nor 
later, and therefore one is left with the impression that the 
Estonian Government has once again let pass an extremely good 
opportunity to raise the issue of Russian troops staying in 
Estonia to the center of attention of international 
organizations and the public," Lorents, the deputy leader of the 
Coalition Party faction in the parliament said in a statement 
today. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tallinn, May 11, BNS -- Arbalett Ltd., the first 
company to give military production in Estonia after World War 
II, has plans to move into a former Russian base near Turi, 
central Estonia. 
  The base is located four kilometers from the nearest cow 
farm, away from people and can be well guarded, said Andres 
Rekker of the Defense League Fund, which owns one-third of the 
company. The concrete hangars at the base also meet the 
standards established for a military plant, he said. 
  Two-thirds of the shares in the company belong to individual 
members of the Turi unit of the Defense League paramilitary 
corps. 
  The issue of turning the base over to the company is 
expected 
to be under discussion at May 17 meeting of the government. 
  Arbalett Ltd. already has made and demonstrated in a field 
test the serial parties of explosive packages -- used as 
substitute for hand grenades in military training. The company 
is set to assemble its first combat grenades soon and hopes to 
launch production of land mines in June or July. 
  Metal shells for the hand grenades come from Erivasar, an 
Estonian company. A part of the materials necessary for the 
manufacture of grenades "is expected from a foreign country 
soon," Rekker said.

  [Excerpt] We will begin with the news from Toompea. The 
Riigikogu's plenary session is working this afternoon and has 
adopted the law on political parties. Gunnar Paal reports. 
  [Begin recording] [Paal] According to the law on political 
parties that has just been adopted, a party must have at least 
1,000 members. This is the decision taken today by the 
Riigikogu, with 65 votes in favor, four against, and three 
abstentions, as it adopted the law on political parties in its 
entirety. Constitutional Commission Chairman Mart Nutt: Will 
the law on political parties cast doubt on the future of a whole 
string of small parties? 
  [Nutt] Not at all. As is known, the parties that are already 
operating do not have to reregister according to this law on 
parties. All they must do is bring their constitutions and 
programs in line with the requirements of the new law. This 
means that if they are below the 1,000 member limit, this will 
not serve as a basis for them to wind up their activity. Also, 
the parties that will be set up before the next Riigikogu 
elections will do so according to the previous principle, which 
means the requirement is 200 members. The new requirement of 
1,000 members will come into force only after the next Riigikogu 
elections. It is aimed at strengthening parties. The parties 
operating now will drop out of the party register only if they 
fail to get any of their candidates into the Riigikogu during 
the next two elections. This is a logical path to follow 
because those parties who fail to make their mark on the 
political map, those parties have no point. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tallinn, May 11, BNS -- British Prime Minister John 
Major in a letter to his Estonian counterpart Mart Laar 
expressed Britain's support for the integration of Estonia with 
European structures and for the demand that Russian troops be 
pulled out from this Baltic country by Aug. 31, 1994, government 
spokesman Ain Saarna said. 
  The letter was delivered to Laar in London, where the 
Estonian leader is currently staying for an official visit. 
  Major in the message also says he is convinced that the 
visit 
by the Estonian prime minister contributes to the development of 
good and friendly relations between Estonia and Great Britain. 
The British premier separately mentions the economic agreements 
to be signed Thursday [12 May]. 
  Major expressed regret at not being able to meet Laar 
because 
of urgent business. 
  The Estonian prime minister today visited the CEETEX '94 
East 
European technologies and investment fair. He was scheduled to 
meet British Minister of State Douglas Hogg later in the day. 
The timetable of the visit includes a trip to Oxford in the 
evening, where Laar holds a lecture, titled "From 
Totalitarianism to Democracy." 
  On Thursday, Laar and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd sign 
two 
intergovernmental agreements in the field of the economy. 
  The president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development, Jacques de Larosiere, will host a luncheon in honor 
of the Estonian leader. Laar will also have meetings with 
representatives of the British Industrial Confederation. 
  The prime minister is scheduled to return to Tallinn late on 
Thursday. Justice Minister Kaido Kama stands in during Laar's 
visit as the head of the Cabinet.

  [Text] Today, as proposed by State President Guntis 
Ulmanis, there was an extraordinary session of the Saeima 
Presidium. The president requested a second debate on the law 
on local authorities adopted on 5 May. Ulmanis regards as 
unacceptable the provisions of paragraph 93 of the law, which 
allows for the dismissal or removal of an elected official from 
his post by the sole personal order of a minister. In his 
opinion, only the Cabinet of Ministers can dismiss or remove an 
elected official from his post. 
  The Saeima Presidium agreed to a second debate of the law on 
local authorities, allowing the Commission on State and Local 
Administration and the Judicial Commission to rule that the 
Commission of State and Local Administration will assemble the 
proposals received and prepare the laws adopted together with 
the proposals for a second debate in a plenary session of the 
Saeima.

<F P=106> [Article by Nellija Locmele: "Latvia's Way Will Not Break </F>
the Coalition With the Farmers Union"] 
  [Text] Riga, 29 Apr -- During a meeting today with 
representatives of the mass media, Latvian Prime Minister Valdis 
Birkavs expressed the conviction that Latvia's Way could form a 
coalition even without the Farmers Union, but it will naturally 
try to maintain the present coalition as long as possible, and, 
for its part, will never attempt to break it. 
  The threat to the ruling coalition arose after the Wednesday 
[27 April] vote of Farmers Union deputies in the Saeima 
[parliament] concerning the case of rescinding the mandates of 
the Saeima "five" [deputies accused of KGB collaboration], but, 
as Birkavs stated today, it was a vote of conscience which 
cannot be attributed to factional discipline. V. Birkavs also 
expressed the view that the signing of the agreements with 
Russia could mean "the end of the coalition." Nonetheless, the 
prime minister admitted that no changes in the government are 
being planned for the present time. There also have been no 
concrete proposals on this matter from the Farmers Union -- 
"there are only some attempts to increase one's own influence by 
taking advantage of the unstable situation." 
  Considering the possibilities that could result from an 
eventual split in the coalition, V. Birkavs first of all 
mentioned the creation of a new coalition which will be able to 
fulfill the economic policy of Latvia's Way, with perhaps some 
contributions regarding a few portfolios or a slight slowdown in 
the pace of reform. Latvia's Way, however, will never consent 
to a radical alteration of course. The creation of the 
coalition can be problematic, because Latvia's Way has its 
supporters in foreign policy, as well as in economic and social 
policies, but they do not represent one definite political group 
or direction. The consultations with these supporters are being 
held on an ongoing basis. V. Birkavs described it as a 
strengthening of the existing coalition. As a second 
possibility which may arise if the present coalition ceases to 
exist, V. Birkavs mentioned the support which Latvia's Way will 
render in the process of creating a new government based on 
radical national forces. At the same time, however, Latvia's 
Way will not fail to point out the losses which Latvia could 
incur.

  [Text] Today, the Latvian Bureau for Monitoring the 
Withdrawal of the Russian Army presented a request to the 
headquarters of the Northwestern Group of Russian Forces to 
inform the bureau about the schedules for withdrawing from those 
Russian military sites that are not mentioned on the schedule 
for troop withdrawal presented by Russia. Ilgonis Upmalis, the 
head of the bureau, says the schedule provided by Russia does 
not include 13 Russian military sites in Latvia, nor 26 army 
units located on warships and submarines in Riga and Liepaja. 
Upmalis also requested the leaders of the Northwestern Group of 
Forces to show the numbers and addresses of the military units 
mentioned in the schedule, as well as providing lists of the 
military personnel at the army units and their family members. 
  The schedule for troop withdrawal provided by Russia is an 
appendix to the treaty signed in Moscow on the withdrawal of 
Russian troops from Latvia.

  [Excerpt] Riga, May 11, BNS -- The decision of the Western 
European Union [WEU] to grant "associate partnership" to nine 
former Warsaw Pact members, including Latvia, Lithuania and 
Estonia, stands an important diplomatic success of the Baltics, 
the Latvian Foreign Ministry said Wednesday [11 May]. 
  The getting closer to the European Union's fledgling defense 
group opens a new stage in the road of the Baltic countries to 
comprehensive integration into European structures. 
  The cooperation will allow the Baltics to build multilateral 
military and political contacts with WEU countries with a 
prospect of becoming full-fledged WEU members in the future, 
according to the statement. 
  The associate partner status was also offered to Poland, 
Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania. 
  Latvia was represented to the May 9 meeting of WEU foreign 
and defense ministers in Luxembourg by Defense Minister Valdis 
Pavlovskis and Acting Foreign Minister Egils Levits. [passage

  [Text] Riga, May 11, BNS -- The National AIDS Center has, 
so far, registered six AIDS patients and 12 HIV carriers, the 
center's Director Andris Ferdats told BNS. 
  Two patients have died; one of them this year, Ferdats said. 
  Ferdats claims it is difficult to find how many residents 
have fallen ill with AIDS and how many are HIV carriers because 
seven to 10 years may separate the beginning of illness from the 
moment of contamination. 
  As reported, the World Health Organization and the Latvian 
AIDS Center opened a seminar for journalists Tuesday [10 May] in 
Riga. The workshop is conducted by WHO expert Marie Noelle Belot. 
  The organizers maintain that the media play an important 
role 
in the formation of AIDS-related public opinion.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladlas Burbulis] </F>
  [Text] Vilnius May 12 TASS -- Lithuanian President Algirdas 
Brazauskas denounced attempts made by right-wing forces of the 
opposition to hold two new referendums in Lithuania, including a 
referendum on early elections to the Lithuanian parliament and 
the indexation of depreciated deposits in saving banks. 
  "I see no grounds for holding these referendums and see no 
reason why such acts should be made, all the more so that those 
suggesting such a step are guided by their narrow party and 
ambitious interests and are again craving for power," Brazauskas 
said on Wednesday [11 May] night, speaking on national 
television. 
  Brazauskas said that the party, the Union of Lithuanian 
Tautinkov (STL) which has several mandates in parliament and 
numbers around 200-300 members, has been collecting signatures 
for holding a referendum on early elections to parliament. "The 
costly referendum will be to no avail, but saw discord among the 
people. This is exactly what the right-wing forces are aiming 
at," the Lithuanian president said. 
  He described the idea of holding a second referendum 
demanded 
by the Union of the Motherland (Lithuanian conservators) led by 
Vitautas Landsbergis and Gyadiminas Vagnorius as "utopia." 
According to the Lithuanian president, this party demands 
suspending privatisation since it is being carried out in 
violation of law, and 100-fold indexation of the deposits in 
saving banks made by the Lithuanian population over the past 
years. 
  "At present, 1 billion 30 million litas are in monetary 
circulation in Lithuania. If the proposals made by these 
"theoreticians" of this party are accepted, around eight billion 
litas more will appear on the financial market which will 
inevitably cause price increases, hyper-inflation and a 
multifold drop in the living standards of the population," the 
Lithuanian president said. "It is clear that Lithuanian 
conservators have set themselves populist, rather than real 
goals," he added.

    [Editorial Report] Vilnius Radio Vilnius Network in 
Lithuanian at 0700 GMT on 11 May carries a 30-minute live relay 
from the prime minister's office in Vilnius on the Value Added 
Tax and problems related to it. Lithuanian Prime Minister 
Adolfas Slezevicius made a brief comment at the beginning of the 
program concerning the latest current political events in the 
country. Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, together with other 
East and Central European countries, have become associate 
members of the Western European Union. Speaking about the 
importance of this, Slezevicius said: 
  "This is a step forward in increasing military and political 
cooperation between East and West. It is my pleasure to note 
that Lithuania, together with other Baltic countries, has become 
an associate member of the union significantly earlier than 
planned. This indicates that the European Union [EU] is 
essentially changing its position on the Baltic states; it is 
changing its stance in the sense of accelerating integration." 
  He also said that when the agreement on free trade with the 
EU was signed this summer "our aspiration to become an associate 
member of the EU will become more realistic." 
  Slezevicius did not deny that support from other Western 
countries was needed for Lithuania to achieve this objective. 
He said: "We believe that Germany -- it begins a term of 
Presidency of the EU on 1 July -- will render us assistance as 
promised by Mr. Kinkel, and, by the way, other countries also 
support us on this. I believe that we will achieve good 
progress in this sphere." 
  Speaking about the recent statement made by Russian Defense 
Minister Pavel Grachev concerning a possible increase of the 
Russian military contingent on the territory of the Republic of 
Estonia -- allegedly for the protection of the rights of the 
local ethnic Russians -- the prime minister said that this 
"causes concern" and "could only be seen as exerting pressure on 
the sovereign state of Estonia." The task of the Lithuanian 
Government, according to the prime minister, is "to express 
solidarity with Estonia and protest acts of this kind."

  [Excerpt] A statement by Adolfas Slezevicius, prime 
minister and chairman of the ruling Democratic Labour Party, was 
made public today. 
  The statement says that in the current situation of fragile 
stability in the state of Lithuania, the idea of early Seimas 
elections proposed by the Tautininkai Union and the Democratic 
Party has in essence been dictated by petty party interests and 
not by the interests of the state and the nation. 
  The most important thing now is stability in the state, the 
prime minister maintains. According to him, signs of economic 
and political stability can now be clearly seen in Lithuania, 
and this is testified by the significantly reduced inflation, 
stable national currency, and the formation of governmental 
structures. 
  Adolfas Slezevicius says that western confidence in 
Lithuania 
is growing and that investments are growing, too. This is the 
prospect for improving the currently hard life, the leader of 
the ruling party said. 
  According to the statement, early Seimas elections would be 
bring about yet more political and spiritual confusion, 
unnecessary budget expenditure, and would waste people's 
efforts. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The creation of a customs union within the CIS is a 
remote, but feasible prospect, the chairman of the State Customs 
Committee, Anatoliy Kruglov, told Interfax Wednesday. 
  Kruglov said the first steps were being made in this 
direction. In particular, a council of the leaders of CIS 
customs was set up which will be responsible for shaping up a 
coordinated customs policy of the CIS states. 
  However, the creation of a customs union should be preceded 
by the creation of a strong economic union and a single economic 
space within the CIS, Kruglov said. 
  At a news conference in Moscow Wednesday, Kruglov put a 
special emphasis on the CIS customs offices' interaction on the 
road to integration. In particular, the council had made a 
number of crucial decisions over the four months since its 
creation. 
  At the initiative of the Russian customs service, the 
council 
prepared an agreement on cooperation and mutual assistance in 
customs affairs and another agreement on the detention and 
return of illegally exported and imported cultural values. The 
two agreements were signed by the CIS heads of government on 
April 15. 
  In addition, a multilateral interdepartmental agreement on 
cooperation in tackling drug trafficking has been prepared and 
recommended for signing. 
  At present, the council is preparing drafts of CIS customs 
legislation and an intergovernmental agreement on simplified 
clearance on customs borders.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Mars Urkumbayev, Kazakhstani </F>
minister of economy, by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Akimov; 
place and date not given: "Eurasian Union Is Command of the 
Times"] 
  [Text] Mars Urkumbayev, Kazakhstani minister of economy, 
believes that a special relationship between his country and 
Russia is not a whim of politicians but a vital necessity. 
Despite all the complexities of the present reality, both 
states are actually working to create the backbone of the future 
Eurasian Union of CIS countries. It is this that largely 
accounts for President Nursultan Nazarbayev's initiative of 
transforming the Commonwealth into such a fundamentally new 
association of like-minded countries, which he advanced at the 
end of last month during his official visit to the Russian 
Federation. 
  An ITAR-TASS correspondent met with the minister and asked 
him to describe in an exclusive interview how this idea matured. 
  "Our idea is the result of an impartial analysis of the 
state 
of the two states' economies," the minister said. "They 
virtually constitute a single whole. Therefore they are not 
subject to disintegration, although in reent years certain 
`hotheads' have committed quite a few follies here, with the 
result that we are all having to pay a high price for confusion 
and unprofessionalism. 
  "For example, how will the power workers of the Urals and 
West Siberia work stably without Kazakhstani coal, if they are 
almost totally dependent on deliveries of it? Or Russian 
metalworkers, to whom our republic used to dispatch more than 8 
million tonnes of iron ore and iron-ore concentrates and pellets 
every year? 
  "There has recently been an ever greater number of 
complaints 
about paralysis in our passenger motor transport and housing 
construction. Just about everyone is blamed for this. In 
actual fact, however, the primary causes lie elsewhere. The 
republic is almost 100-percent dependent on deliveries of buses 
and timber from the Russian Federation. Until we have secured 
the reinstatement of this flow, people will continue to stand in 
line at bus stops for hours on end, and new buildings will stand 
for months without floors, doors, or window frames." 
  [Akimov] But it will not be easy to reinstate the disrupted 
ties in their former volume, not to mention deepening and 
broadening them. Last year alone commodity turnover between our 
countries fell by a factor of more than four. Do you really 
believe that in this situation it is possible to speak of any 
start of integration processes? 
  [Urkumbayev] They are already taking place. Forms and 
methods of mutually acceptable cooperation were identified at 
conferences of representatives of ministries, departments, and 
administrations of contiguous oblasts held under the auspices of 
our governments during 1992-1993, as well as in talks on a 
purely regional level. Including with the Republic of Sakha 
(Yakutia), Bashkortostan, Buryatia, and the cities of Moscow, 
St. Petersburg, and Nizhniy Novgorod. It is now a question of 
ensuring that the agreements reached start to work in full. For 
this it is necessary to remove the last remaining obstacles. 
  The chief stumbling block here has been the failure of 
payments to pass not only between individual enterprises but 
even between banks. This has now reached astronomic figures and 
runs to trillions of rubles. The lack of joint structures 
directly engaged in coordinating Kazakhstani-Russian economic 
ties and eliminating the misunderstandings that arise in their 
implementation also acts as a big brake. 
  As a result of talks between our countries' presidents our 
countries' corresponding departments have, together with the 
state banks, already begun unraveling the tight tangle of 
contradictions occasioned by mutual debts. I believe that this 
work will be completed over the next six to eight weeks, along 
with the current preparation of proposals for simplifying mutual 
payment-clearing relations between business subjects, which have 
been complicated by the introduction of national currencies in 
our countries. Consequently, in June it is quite possible to 
expect the completion of the first, most difficult, stage in the 
normalization of Kazakhstani-Russian trade and economic 
cooperation. 
  The second stage is connected with the creation of 
conditions 
for the free movement of goods, services, and capital. Here, 
too, everything seems to be starting to move. The groundwork 
has already been done for the formation of a single customs 
area. Compared with last year, Kazakhstan has already reduced 
the list of quota-regulated output by a factor of six, and 
Russia by a factor of more than seven. At the same time customs 
export duties on many types of products have been substantially 
reduced or even totally removed by mutual agreement between the 
sides. 
  There will then follow the complete lifting of customs 
duties, taxes, dues, and other tariff and nontariff restrictions 
in mutual trade and a switch to a unified trade policy with 
regard to third countries. All this, in conjunction with the 
standardization of trade and economic legislation, is to serve 
as the basis for rapprochement in other spheres of 
Kazakhstani-Russian ties, including management structures, and 
lead ultimately to a union of the two countries of which 
Nursultan Nazarbayev spoke in Moscow. It is this union in turn, 
being a kind of guarantor of fair and honest partnership, that 
must become the backbone of the Eurasian Union.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 12 ITAR-TASS -- Commenting on President 
Yeltsin's visit to Germany the newspaper SEVODNYA (TODAY) 
writes: The president of Russia hopes that with Germany's 
support Russia can become a genuine European power. "I believe 
Helmut Kohl, I believe his moral principles," President Yeltsin 
said, and this belief provides the basis for Russia's membership 
of the Council of Europe. 
  Upon his return from Germany, President Yeltsin is expected 
to submit to the Federation Council six nominees for the 
vacancies in the Constitutional Court, NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA 
surmises. 
  The same newspaper carries an article by Russian Minister 
for 
Nationalities and Regional Policies Sergey Shakhray, who says 
among other things: "One of the chief thesis of the regional 
policy is that the diversity of Russian regions and the 
multinational composition of the Russian state is not a weakness 
of Russia's. It is the country's potential might, its potential 
advantage over many other states. There is no alternative at 
present: whether the former soviet republics should or should 
not integrate within the frame of the Commonwealth of 
Independent States. The option lies elsewhere; whether this 
integration will proceed in a civilized manner, through 
voluntary and equal unification or in an uncontrolled way with 
the use of force. This is the choice Russian society is facing 
at present". 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI publishes an interview with State Duma 
Chairman Ivan Rybkin. Rybkin says that "within a short time, we 
have succeeded in establishing mutual understanding and 
interaction between the president and the State Duma, the State 
Duma and the Federation Council, the State Duma and the judicial 
branch of power. This is very, very important. It is possible 
to say that one hundred days of work is a short period of time 
to allow such a conclusion to be drawn. But ours is the time 
when one day counts for two and even for three". 
  The newspaper SEVODNYA quoted Russian delegation leader to 
talks with Estonia Ambassador Vasiliy Svirin [title and name as 
received] as saying that "Russia sees no point in continuing 
futile negotiations with Estonia". Ambassador Svirin told 
SEVODNYA that the reason for the impasse in the negotiation lies 
in Estonia's going back on the obligations it assumed earlier 
(particularly as concerns the retired Russian Army servicemen 
residing in Estonia and the refusal of Estonia to contribute to 
the building of housing in Russia for the servicemen leaving 
Estonia). In this connection Moscow has told Tallinn that the 
earlier deadline for the withdrawal of the remaining Russian 
contingent from that Baltic republic is "no longer relevant". 
  NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA (THE NEW DAILY) mentions the 
trial of the August 1991 coup plotters. "What was expected 
almost from the very beginning of the trial has now come to 
pass: The trial ended in nothing, even before it began properly. 
Although volumes of in- service reports were written and 
hundreds of witnesses were questioned, thousands of interviews 
were given and even books were published, all those who were 
involved even in the least were sure that this is one of the 
"eternal cases" which can lead nowhere". 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA quips "the trial of the century is over." It 
appears that everyone agrees to this with the exception of the 
former commander of the Soviet land forces, General Valentin 
Varennikov. In an exclusive interview with KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, 
Varennikov's lawyer Dmitriy Steiberg stressed that Valentin 
Varennikov's rejection of the amnesty is not new. Having denied 
his guilt at the moment of his arrest and then in the course of 
the examination of the case in the courtroom, Varennikov first 
spoke out categorically against the amnesty at the court session 
which followed immediately after the amnesty was announced. He 
insists that the trial continue and that he be given the 
opportunity to prove his innocence". 
  SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA carries an interview with State Duma 
deputy economist Vladimir Lisichkin, who touches upon problems 
relating to privatisation in the Russian Federation. "The 
ownership of the national wealth, which under the communist rule 
belonged to the people, was realized through the consumption 
funds. Of course there were deviations from the fair 
distribution of the wealth, but the underlying principle was 
sound. The national wealth was to be managed in a way that 
permitted every citizen to partake of it. It is silly to say 
that the people had nothing under the Soviet power and Mr. 
Chubays is now returning the wealth to the people. Mr. Chubays 
is telling us that the division of the property is proceeding 
painlessly. It is a lie. I repeat: an undeclared civil war is 
underway. And there is blood, blood flowing. Even though 
nobody seems to be objecting to privatisation." 
  PRAVDA carries an interview with Gennadiy Tretyakov, a 
functionary of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan. Concerning 
relations between Azerbaijan and Armenia, Tretyakov says: "We 
are neighbours, and we must find a way out of this war. I think 
that the preamble to negotiations can be provided by mutual 
agreement on the inviolability of the territorial integrity of 
Azerbaijan and Armenia, with every citizen, regardless of 
nationality and domicile, enjoying full civil rights". 
  St. Petersburg's best hotel, which is full up at any time of 
the year and which has accommodated presidents, ministers, 
bankers and top stars is on the verge of insolvency, the 
newspaper SANKT PETERBURGSKIE VEDOMOSTI writes about Grand Hotel 
Europe run by a Swedish company, although it is nominally 
administered by Russians and the city authorities hold a 
controlling interest in it. The economic and legal confusion in 
the country, as well as financial machinations of the foreign 
partners, who seek to bank on the chaos, have brought the hotel 
to the verge of bankruptcy, particulary since even the loans 
with which it was reconstructed have yet to be repaid.

  [Text] Bonn, 11 May (ITAR-TASS) -- A direct, scrambled 
telephone line will be set up in the nearest future between the 
Kremlin and the federal chancellor's department. An agreement 
on this was signed in Bonn today during the official visit of 
Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin to the FRG. The 
document was signed by Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev for 
Russia and by FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel for Germany. 
  "Taking account of the mutual interest in creating the 
technical wherewithal to hold confidential telephone 
conversations at the highest level," the agreement provides for, 
"as soon as technically feasible," setting up a direct scrambled 
telephone link between the Kremlin and the federal chancellor's 
department, using two channels laid along geographically 
separate routes. 
  The agreement comes into force on the day on which it is 
signed.

  [Text] Bonn May 11 TASS -- "We have agreed to see off the 
Russian troops (from Germany) in a worthy manner and add festive 
character to the event", Russian President Boris Yeltsin told a 
press conference on Wednesday adding that he and Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl had discussed the issue in detail. 
  Kohl earlier said the farewell ceremony would take place in 
Berlin where the Second World War ended. 
  The ceremony should signal an end to a certain historical 
phase, according to Yeltsin. Germany, Russia and the whole of 
Europe are entering a new era of relations, an era of 
reconciliation, he said and added that the ceremony would be a 
prologue for the celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the end 
of World War Two to be marked in 1995. 
  Yeltsin stressed that Kohl had confirmed the German position 
to politicallly include Russia into the G-7, to accept it into 
the Council of Europe and to promote an early partnership and 
cooperation agreement between Russia and the EU [European Union].

  [Text] Bonn May 11 TASS--"I am satisfied with the results 
of today's talks with President Richard von Weizsaecker and 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl. The talks were held in a sincere, 
friendly atmosphere. This has already become a good tradition 
and reflects the particularly genial relations that have 
developed between our states over the past few years", Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin told a joint news conference here on 
Wednesday. 
  According to Yeltsin, the talks demonstrated once more that 
the two sides were unanimous in their assessment of the current 
state of Russian-German relations. "The federal chancellor and I 
agreed that our two countries had proceeded far along the way 
towards each other. We have managed to solve most of the thorny 
problems inherited from the war and the post-war period. The 
agreements reached during our talks have begun working", the 
Russian president stressed. 
  Yeltsin reported that he had discussed today in details with 
Chancellor Kohl arrangements for the farewell ceremony to mark 
the complete withdrawal of Russia's West Army Group from 
Germany, scheduled for this coming August. The sides agreed 
that the ceremony should be held in style. This event, the 
Russian leader went on to say, "is designed to symbolize the 
completion of a certain historic stage and to mark the beginning 
of a new era of relations our states, and Europe on the whole, 
are to enter". The planned actions will become a sort of 
prologue to next year's celebration of the 50th anniversary of 
the victory in World War II, Yeltsin stressed. 
  According to him, Russia and Germany would like these 
celebrations to acquire an all-European scale. "We suggest that 
a political declaration to be passed at this December's CSCE 
summit in Budapest include special provisions concerning the 
50th anniversary of the end of World War II. They should 
reflect the principles of world order and international 
relations to be brought by CSCE member-countries into the 3rd 
millennium", the Russian president pointed out. 
  Yeltsin said the talks had also touched upon the issues of 
human rights and democracy. "Life has brought us to these 
objectives in different ways. Russia is presently at the stage 
of democratic consolidation, and this process cannot be called 
entirely smooth. The pace, methods and instruments of democratic 
reforms may change depending on the state of society", the 
Russian leader noted. But this process is irreversible, he 
stressed, which has been proved by the course of developments 
following last December's parliamentary elections and the 
passage of the new constitution by people's vote. The memorandum 
on civil accord recently signed by Russia's major political and 
public forces is another evidence of the fact that the 
overwhelming majority of the Russians favour further peaceful 
democratic reforms, Yeltsin said.

  [Text] Bonn May 11 TASS--"Germany remains Russia's major 
foreign economic partner," Russian President Boris Yeltsin told 
a joint news conference he gave here together with German 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Wednesday. He reported that "issues 
of economic cooperation were also in the focus of attention at 
today's talks in Bonn". 
  Under conditions of a complicated transition period Russia 
is 
presently going trough, it is difficult to avoid certain decline 
in economic ties. "Moreover, most far-sighted economic partners 
do not scale down their activity despite the temporary 
difficulties confronting Russia. I am confident that we will 
manage to overcome them", the president stressed. 
  "During the talks, we agreed to pay most attention to such 
fields of cooperation as power engineering, machine-building, 
conversion, support of small and medium-sized business, 
especially in the production sphere. We suggested using such 
effective instrument of economic relations as non-interest 
bearing commercial credit, or the so-called `swing'", Yeltsin 
said, adding that "the discussion of trade and economic 
relations between Russia and Germany will be continued on the 
second day of his visit".

  [Text] Bonn May 11 TASS -- German chancellor Helmut Kohl 
said Germany and the rest of the West are interested in a 
democratic, politically stable and economically strong Russia. 
  "We, Germans, and, I think, the majority of people in Europe 
and the West are interested in a democratic, politically stable 
and economically strong Russia," he said. 
  Speaking at a joint news conference after his talks with 
visiting President Boris Yeltsin on Wednesday, Kohl pledged to 
support by words and action Russian partners. He confirmed that 
Germany pins hopes on Yeltsin's economic reform and fully 
supports his policy. 
  He stressed the need to let Russia in in international 
organisations, including the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade. Kohl stressed that Germany will soon become president of 
the European Union [EU] and will call for the soonest possible 
signing of a cooperation accord between Russia and the EU. 
  One of the key topics discussed at the talks which will 
continue on Thursday was European security, the German 
chancellor continued. "I explained to President Yeltsin the 
meaning and goals of the decision adopted at the NATO summit 
meeting in Brussels in January 1994. We are interested in 
Russia's participation in the Partnership for Peace," he said. 
  Speaking about the Bosnian conflict, Kohl noted that Germany 
and Russia are working in the contact group with representatives 
of the United Nations, the EU, the United States, France and 
Britain in order to reach as soon as possible a comprehensive 
cease-fire in Bosnia and involve the warring sides in 
cooperation to establish a durable peace. 
  Kohl and Yeltsin also discussed bilateral relations, 
including the withdrawal of Russian troops from Germany.

  [Text] President Boris Yeltsin in a speech at the formal 
banquet in Bonn late on Wednesday dwelt at length on the course 
of Russian reforms. 
  "Our state, he said, is going through a complicated period. 
Its substance is manifested in profound changes in all walks of 
life: from the national economy down to the individual's 
mentality. The complexity of tasks we have set ourselves is not 
determined only by the gigantic size of the country. One other 
just as important factor is caused by the huge distortions 
inherited by Russia from the period of totalitarian rule". 
  It is impossible to resolve such tasks quickly and without 
pain, said the Russian president. "Any tangible results may 
follow a longer range flexible policy which, apart from the 
world experience, accounts for Russian history, Russian national 
specifics and traditions and the psychology of our society", he 
said. 
  "We are seeking to set conditions for active participation 
in 
Russian reforms by all constructive forces and at the same time, 
tough restrictions on extremists", Yeltsin stressed. "We are 
well aware that the key to resolving the current problems is in 
our own hands. No one but we ourselves can build a prospering 
society -- by dint of our people's toil, talents and energy. 
And we are confident about a success of our reforms". 
  On relations between Russia and Germany, Yeltsin said the 
present generation of Germans and Russians made use of the 
unique chance "that history has given us". "Gone from our 
relations is the feuding which has for decades worn out the 
nerves and stamina of both nations", said the president. "Today, 
we solve all arising issues to mutual benefit in an atmosphere 
of calm and well-wishing. One proof is the nature and substance 
of current talks with the federal chancellor". 
  One of the issues of mutual concern, the president went on 
to 
say, is bilateral economic relations. In his words, Germany is 
"Russia's main trading partner". However, he stressed that 
businessmen from other countries have started to overtake their 
German counterparts in the Russian market. " I do not think that 
German entrepreneurs would be willing to concede their leading 
positions. But for this, more activity is needed", said Yeltsin. 
  The Russian president offered German businessmen to open up 
direct cooperation with Russian enterprises and promote 
manufacturing contacts for years ahead without restricting 
themselves to one-off trading deals. 
  On the situation in Europe and worldwide, Yeltsin stressed 
it 
was on the change. "The bloc approach to resolving 
international issues is going into the past. But eternal peace 
is yet to come. What I mean, said the president, is not only 
the local conflicts and wars but also global challenges which 
can be met by the world community as a whole. That is why there 
is an increasing urgency for united effort". 
  Both Germany and Russia can play a stabilizing role in 
complicated global processes, Yeltsin believes. But more 
importantly, peace and security guarantees must be brought to 
Europe and adjacent regions. "What is needed is the models of 
solutions and cooperation that would not infringe on anyone's 
interests and leave anyone overboard", Yeltsin said. 
  "The new single Europe cannot be a club for a few select", 
stressed the Russian president. "By the same token, the solution 
of security problems cannot be the privilege of a few select". 
  "The wholesome political, economic and cultural architecture 
of our continent should not be allowed to isolate individual 
countries or a group of countries on the foe-friend principle 
but should try to integrate them within a single organism. It 
is not worth trying to divide Europe into high or low security 
zones", Yeltsin said. 
  In his view, "the military-political institutions of our 
continent emerging in conditions of the period of the cold war 
and confrontation are outdated and in need of internal 
transformation". "But the main thing is cooperation in the 
readjustment of the system of institutions and mechanisms which 
could work to the benefit of one democratic Europe", he pointed 
out. "The main route to this, in our view, lies through 
establishing the CSCE as an effective regional organization. In 
this case, united effort by NATO, NACC [North Atlantic 
Cooperation Council], WEU [Western European Union] and CIS can 
acquire a new substance under its umbrella". It is precisely 
this that determines Russia's attitude to the Partnership for 
Peace program, he said. 
  In his words, "the genuine partnership is an effective 
guarantee of security and stability in the continent. But this 
can be made possible only if there is a will on both sides and a 
movement towards each other." "Such an approach does no ripe 
easily even within the framework of NATO", he said. "But this in 
itself is no reason for slackening bilateral effort", said 
Yeltsin. 
  "Russia's position on this is clear-cut: we have no 
territorial claims to any state. Our defence doctrine is purely 
defensive. The Russian armed forces have no tasks other than 
defences of the country and its CIS allies, participation in 
peacemaking operations in line with international commitments", 
said the Russian president. 
  Yeltsin told the audience that "we are on the threshold of 
an 
important event in Russian-German relations. The last Russian 
soldier will soon leave the German soil. This will draw a line 
under the heavy legacy we inherited almost 50 years ago. Of 
course, our memories will take us back again and again to the 
tragic chapters of history. But this should not be allowed to 
become an obstacle to a final historical reconciliation between 
the peoples of our countries. The seeds of reconciliations have 
shot up and started to bring a rich harvest."

  [Text] Bonn May 11 -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said 
today that Germany will discuss the possibility of providing 
further support to Russia and promoting its integration into the 
world economy at the forthcoming group of seven ("G-7") 
industrial leading countries of the world summit scheduled to be 
held in Naples (Italy) in July. Kohl was speaking at a supper 
hosted by him in honour of Russian President Boris Yeltsin at 
the Petersberg Government Residency today. 
  The chancellor emphasised that the German people are for new 
democratic Russia's integration into the circle of democratic 
industrial states. This is the reason why the Germans favoured 
Russia's inclusion, as broadly as possible, into the political 
part of the "G-7" summit, he said. According to him, Germany's 
Western partners expect from Russia constructive cooperation in 
settling European and international crises. 
  Helmut Kohl recalled that the last of the Russian troops 
will 
leave the German territory in August this year. "This will not 
only be drawing a line under the post-war history of Europe. We 
are united in saying that this gives our countries a special 
opportunity for strengthening and widening new friendship and 
partnership. That is why we wish to mark the withdrawal of 
Russian military personnel together in a solemn and fitting 
form," he said.

  [Text] Bonn, 11 May--"The results of the first day of the 
visit by Russian President Boris Yeltsin to the FRG speak for 
themselves. Relations of friendship and trust justify 
themselves. The Russian-German summit meeting produced a 
resolution to the question of the withdrawal of troops from 
Germany." Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, who was 
commenting on the results of the talks at the request of the 
ITAR-TASS correspondent, said this today. 
  "I do not believe," the minister noted, "that it was right 
to 
whip up passions from all sides over this question and to make 
various statements. Everything can be settled in a normal 
manner, precisely by holding the send-off ceremony for Russian 
troops in Berlin. We will hold some cultural event afterwards 
in Weimar. Therefore, the federal chancellor's idea remains 
alive and in force. And, in essence, such solutions lay the 
foundations for the future." 
  When asked by the ITAR-TASS correspondent what he thought of 
the accord reached during the talks between Yeltsin and Kohl, 
Colonel General Matvey Burlakov, commander in chief of the 
Western Group of Forces, said: "This is a wise decision by our 
leaders."

  [Text] Bonn May 12 TASS -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin 
wants Germany which is to chair the European Union from July to 
promote its integration into international financial 
institutions. 
  "Russia should be pulled closer in Naples", Yeltsin told 
German Finance Minister Theo Waigel at the end of their Thursday 
meeting referring to the G-7 summit scheduled for July. 
  "We shall try as much as it is possible", Waigel promised in 
return. 
  According to Russian Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin, 
Yeltsin wants the G-7 to analyse the forms of insuring 
investments in Russia from noncommercial risks. He told TASS 
that the Russian leader had raised the issue at the G-7 summit 
in Tokyo, but "unfortunately the European Union is only now 
getting down to the work". 
  Shokhin added that the problems of Russian foreign debt in 
the framework of the London and Paris Clubs of creditors were 
discussed during Yeltsin's meeting with Waigel. 
  Waigel, in his turn, told TASS that the debt problem will be 
discussed in detail at his talks with Shokhin. According to 
him, Yeltsin expressed his gratitude for efficient work in 
attracting international financial institutions to reforming 
Russian economy. 
  He also said that the Russian pullout from Germany will not 
"alienate the peoples" of the two countries. "On the contrary, 
this step already now causes sympathy to Russia among citizens 
and political parties of our country", the finance minister 
stressed. 
  After the meeting with Waigel Yeltsin left for Helmut Kohl's 
home region of Rhineland-Palatinate where he is to hold several 
private meetings with the chancellor.

  [Text] Bonn May 12 TASS -- "Everything that the Russian 
Federation is doing to strengthen the integrational processes, 
by no means pursues the purpose of restoring the former Soviet 
Union and is based on purely economic considerations," Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin, currently on a three-day official visit 
in the FRG, stressed in his message, which was read out in Bonn 
today during the opening of the first general session of the 
International Committee for Economic Reforms and CIS Cooperation 
with Western Countries. 
  The head of the Russian state drew attention to some 
strategic factors in East-West economic relations, particularly 
to the fact that "the merging of the Western investment 
potential with the resources and labour force of the new 
independent states is becoming increasingly pressing in our 
days". "It is absolutely clear now that the Russian Federation, 
like the other CIS states, has irreversibly embarked upon the 
road of reforms, switching over from the centralised planned 
economy to market relations, and is fully resolved to go the 
whole hog," Yeltsin pointed out. 
  The address of the Russian president who, as noted here, 
wanted to attend the general session personally, but could not 
do it due to the busy programme of his official visit to 
Germany, had set the tune to many other speeches. 
  "I readily joined the work of the international committee," 
its vice leader and chairman of the "Deutsche Bank" supervisory 
council Friedrich Wilhelm Christians noted, "because I was sure 
that integration processes had begun in the CIS countries. The 
former republics of the Soviet Union made a big mistake when 
they presumed that each of them could survive independently 
after the USSR's collapse. This is impossible today. Not only 
much time was wasted in vain during the years that had elapsed 
since then, but great damage was inflicted upon those states, 
too," this prominent German banker who, as he said, has been 
actively cooperating for the past 25 years first with the former 
USSR and then with the CIS nations, told the general session. 
  "And after the beginning of the integration process, not 
only 
in the political but also in the economic sphere, it was time to 
think of the emergence of those countries on the world market," 
Christians noted. 
  "The Bonn general session," head of the international 
committee and Chairman of the Council of Experts of the Russian 
Government Georgiy Khizha stressed, "is an important event in 
the international economic life. "The preservation of peace, 
political stability and democracy in the CIS countries and other 
states of the world depends largely on economic and social 
progress. The work of the committee should make a substantial 
contribution to the development of real partnership, trust, and 
mutual understanding. International security in the interests 
of all the countries of the world can be achieved through 
economic cooperation," Khizha stressed.

  [Text] It has not been decided when Russia is going to sign 
the NATO Partnership for Peace program. Work is under way in 
this direction and documents earlier drafted by Russia are being 
polished. This was disclosed in an interview with Interfax by 
the head of a Russian Foreign Ministry department Yuriy Ushakov. 
  He said the documents should reflect the latest 
developments, 
including the ideas expressed during a recent debate in the 
State Duma. He said amendments are being made to the 
presentation document which has the working name "Basic 
Parameters of Cooperation with NATO". 
  Ushakov emphasized that diplomats are working hand in hand 
with colleagues from the Defense Ministry and other interested 
agencies. "I cannot say for sure what Defense Minister Pavel 
Grachev meant when he spoke of working on a new document on 
relations between Russia and NATO. We drafted the documents 
that are now being finalized but the foundation remains the 
same," he said. 
  Ushakov announced that a mixed commission on cooperation 
with 
NATO chaired by Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin held a 
regular session on Tuesday. It consists of representatives of 
the Ministries of Defense, Foreign Affairs, Finance and the 
Interior as well as the Security Council and the Foreign 
Intelligence Service. The essence of cooperation was discussed 
as well as various ways of reflecting the special role of Russia 
in cooperation with NATO. Participants agreed that cooperation 
with NATO should be expanded and the Partnership program should 
not be given up despite all its shortcomings, restrictions and 
shapelessness. The program is not ideal, the diplomat said, and 
Russia is going to make considerable changes in a document that 
is going to be worked out between Russia and NATO. 
  When asked what he meant by Russia's special role Ushakov 
replied: "This means equal partnership at all levels when the 
opinion of such a side as Russia must be taken into account 
before making decisions on key matters concerning acute 
situations in the world. This is the first and foremost 
consideration."

<F P=106> [From the "Slavyanka" program of the Russian Defense </F>
Ministry] 
  [Text] The fate of the Russian-U.S. joint command and staff 
exercises on the Totskoye test range near Orenburg remains 
unclear. There is a fairly broad range of opinions being voiced 
on this issue. At times it is even acquiring a fashionable 
political nuance. Here, however, is the opinion of Army General 
Pavel Grachev, the Russian defense minister: 
  [Begin Grachev recording] What a rumpus has now been raised 
about these exercises! We signed the agreement a year ago, and 
everyone remained silent. Now certain people have suddenly 
remembered them and there has been a hullabaloo in the State 
Duma, and there has been a stir at government level, and even in 
the [Russian Federation] Security Council. Advice is being 
extended to the president. Boris Nikolayevich and I have also 
discussed this issue and what approach to take to it. 
  If we really want mutually to get the enemy image out of our 
heads and really move step-by-step toward partnership, the 
exercises are, of course, necessary. Let the young American set 
his eyes on the young Russian. Let them have contact with one 
another. Let them tell each other about their lives. What, in 
the final analysis, is wrong in that? Moreover, they are not 
war exercises in the pure sense, but peacekeeping command and 
staff exercises, peacekeeping exercises, and, if we really 
respect one another and respect those people for whose sake we 
are engaging in peacekeeping activities, then even at the moral 
level these exercises should be held. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Andrey Lekant report in the "Relations" column: "The </F>
Americans `No Longer Love Yeltsin So Much.' Russia Thinks That 
the United States Is Indifferent To It"] 
  [Text] The fifth forum of the Russian-U.S. Aspen Dialogue, 
organized on our side by the International Association of 
Enterprise Directors [IAED] and on the U.S. side by the Colorado 
State Civil Administration Center (Aspen), ended in Sochi last 
weekend with the adoption of a final declaration. 
  This time its text was rather tough. The sides have started 
talking about a "post-romantic" period in the relations between 
Russia and the United States. The Americans expressed 
misgivings about the nature of Russian democracy which is in a 
state of lengthy transition, not excluding the possibility of an 
"enlightened authoritarianism" period being established (the 
term by Presidential Council member Andranik Migranyan). And 
they expressed doubts as to whether democratic goals can be 
achieved by undemocratic means. Greg Guroff, director of a U.S. 
State Department division, said that the U.S. press and the 
people no longer love Yeltsin as before. And support by U.S. 
politicians of actions analogous to the storming of the White 
House in Moscow will not be repeated. The Russian side however, 
in the person of IAED President Mark Masarksiy, believes that 
the return of authoritarianism is impossible because federal 
power can no longer concentrate all financing in its hands 
following the introduction of a two-way taxation system. 
  The declaration also talks about the Americans' anxiety over 
Russia's policy in the CIS states which the Russian side regards 
as a sphere of its vital interests, while the opposite side sees 
it as a zone of possible expansion by Moscow within the former 
Soviet sphere of influence. "For the United States and the 
world community, 25 million Russian-speakers in the CIS is no 
less painful an issue than the Armenians living in Azerbaijan or 
representatives of other nations in third countries," Mr. Guroff 
believes. 
  The final document also states that "U.S. policy... has lost 
an element of sensitivity to Russia's real needs in the post- 
confrontation situation." This statement was preceded by a 
speech by Aleksandr Yakovlev, director of the Russian Federal TV 
and Radio Broadcasting Service. He noted that "the United 
States' policy toward Russia is temporizing and indifferent." 
The Marshall Plan was adopted because it testified to victory 
and billions were spent on it. On the other hand, the 
revolution of the 80's and 90's in Russia was "alien" to it, and 
it gave nothing. "And this is just as well," Mr. Yakovlev 
thinks. In his opinion, in the United States there is no 
understanding that reformation of Russia has worldwide 
importance. The Americans for their part have recognized that 
their country has no coherent policy with respect to Russia. 
  The tonality of the Aspen dialogue has also changed. Whereas 
earlier the forum was of an enlightening character -- U.S. 
experts/democrats were teaching the young Russia -- now they 
want to understand what is really going on over here.

<F P=106> [Vissarion Sisnev report: "Attention U.S. Tourists. The </F>
U.S. Consulate in St. Petersburg Has Warned Fellow Nationals 
that Attending the Goodwill Games Poses a Threat to their Lives"] 
  [Text] Washington -- The American public got to know about 
this 12-page guide from an account of it by COX NEWS SERVICE 
correspondents. It is anticipated that about 5,000 sportsmen 
from many countries will participate in the Goodwill Games in 
St. Petersburg, and not only Russians but also thousands of 
foreign guests will attend. 
  It was precisely this that the U.S. Consulate in St. 
Petersburg had in mind when it put together a guide for 
prospective tourists planning to visit Russia's "northern 
capital." It is, however, not exclusively for them but also for 
business people going there at any other time. In the first 
place it is not at all advised that anyone do this alone, as 
"the criminal situation in St. Petersburg has significantly 
worsened over the last year and problems of personal security 
are more acute than ever." The guide informs them that 
"criminal acts, which are often carried out during the day or at 
times when people are at home in their apartments, are becoming 
more and more daring." 
  It goes on to say: "Criminals are better armed than ever, 
are often well informed about their chosen victims, and take 
less and less notice of the law-enforcement agencies, which they 
are stronger than and which feel besieged." Some 15 cases over 
the last six months are cited where the criminals' targets were 
consulate staffers themselves, and in one case the attack took 
place in the street in a densely populated area and no one came 
to his assistance. On one occasion a consulate staffer was 
"mercilessly beaten by four militiamen." 
  In general the U.S. diplomats have a low opinion of St. 
Petersburg's law-enforcement agencies, especially of State Motor 
Vehicle Inspection Administration staffers. For example, they 
said the following about them: "Traffic policemen go as far as 
threatening totally innocent motorists with blood tests using 
unsterile needles in an attempt to extort bribes from them." 
St. Petersburg State Motor Vehicle Inspection Administration 
staffers, the document asserts, "are well-known for using their 
power to stop drivers and extort fines from them for real or 
imagined offenses." 
  Those who travel to this city by rail are advised to wind 
wire around the compartment door's lock for the night because 
the robbers check out in advance who gives the impression of 
being vague or untogether. What is more, they have at their 
disposal a strong, colorless gas with which they knock 
passengers out. Businessmen are advised to keep a lookout for 
literally everyone, including their Russian partners, as "U.S. 
business people are with increasing frequency becoming the 
object of violent attacks, kidnappings, and extortion, which are 
sometimes planned by people with whom they have joint operations 
here." 
  Immediately after this publication appeared, there was a 
hearing in the Senate Subcommittee on Terrorism, Narcotics and 
International Communications, in which experts in this field 
spoke. Russia was more or less the main focus of the senators' 
attention, as according to CIA Director James Woolsey, the 
Russian mafia is already working in close contact with the 
Italian mafia and the Colombian drugs cartels. Senator John 
Kerry of Massachusetts added that what we are dealing with is 
the establishment of a "global mafia" and that Russian organized 
crime, embracing 3,000-4,000 groups, is in control of no less 
than 40 percent of the national economy. 
  But there is nothing in all this about which our own press 
has not written. Therefore, there is no reason to accuse the 
U.S. diplomats and politicians of anything -- what's true cannot 
be altered. Tourists and businessmen have traveled here just 
the same, though maybe not in the numbers we would have liked. 
But articles by journalists or television reports are one 
thing; people here regard them not so much with distrust as 
according to the principle: Well they have to write about 
something.... But they have another attitude toward official 
warnings from state and diplomatic organs. U.S. citizens have 
gotten used to paying attention to them, and they have saved a 
large number of their lives when on the advice of the consulate 
they have quickly packed their bags and quit a danger zone. 
  In any case the CNN radio and television corporation -- 
which 
is behind the games -- clearly took the alarm bells in St. 
Petersburg seriously, inasmuch as it considered it necessary to 
assure the public: The consulate has overreacted, it is only 
necessary to "show the same degree of caution as you would in 
New York, or Paris, or any other big city." It was also 
announced that plans are in preparation to guarantee the 
security of athletes and guests at the Goodwill Games, and, as 
has been the case with all other international sporting events, 
additional forces drawn from the militia and Army will be 
brought in to guard the participants and the sporting facilities.

  [Text] Moscow, 11 May -- The Black Sea Fleet problem has 
moved beyond the departmental framework and assumed state 
importance. A system of radical proposals on the future of the 
fleet is now being prepared by the Ministries of Foreign 
Affairs, Defense, Economy, and others. The proposals will be 
examined at the highest level, Lieutenant General Valeriy 
Manilov, deputy secretary of the Russian Federation Security 
Council, said in an interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent. 
  According to him, it is also impossible to resolve the 
question of conducting the joint Russian-U.S. command and staff 
exercises on a departmental level. We need to analyze the 
political, economic, military-technical, and financial aspects 
of the exercises, the general said. 
  Conclusions and suggestions that should also give 
consideration to the general public opinion should form the 
basis of decisions on the future of the Black Sea Fleet and on 
holding the Russian-U.S. military exercises, Manilov stressed. 
He said that the Security Council has already made its position 
clear to the Russian president, but at the same time, did not 
reveal the essence of this position.

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Kuznets report under the "Customs" rubric: "Russia </F>
Insists on Standardizing Tariffs with Belarus and Imposes 
Unfavored Nation Trade Status with Baltic States"] 
  [Excerpt] Anatoliy Kruglov, chairman of the Russian 
Federation State Customs Committee, has said that Belarus failed 
to bring its customs tariffs in line with Russian ones by 1 May 
according to the treaty on the unification of the two countries' 
monetary systems. Mr. Kruglov said also that a meeting of the 
Russian and Belarusian customs committee chiefs would take place 
next week, in which the Russian side is going to insist on 
adherence to the treaty. 
  However, Mr. Kruglov thinks, "the unification of customs 
systems" is proceeding best precisely with Russia's western 
neighbor: Only joint efforts of the CIS countries' customs 
services will make it possible to stifle smuggling. The CIS 
council of customs agency chiefs, which was set up by nine 
republics last December, has already reached agreements on the 
prevention of the illicit export of cultural values and a 
framework agreement on cooperation in customs matters. A 
similar document is being drawn up on illicit drug trading. As 
it insists on the integration of customs systems, Russia is 
pursuing an even more serious objective -- it is simply unable 
to set up and to control on its own the border that has emerged 
with the near-abroad countries. 
  Regarding the Baltic states, things stand much worse. 
According to Mr. Kruglov, Russia has begun to set up a "real 
border" with the Baltic states. Moreover, both the Baltic 
states and Russia have imposed "for political reasons" the 
unfavored nation status in trade with each other. This means 
that Russian tariff rates on the border with the Baltics will 
double automatically, a move that will scarcely boost foreign 
economic activity in the region. 
  Anatoliy Kruglov said that, as far as he knows, no new 
changes in import tariff rates have been planned; he thinks that 
"the golden mean" needs to be found in setting tariffs so that 
they will be both protectionist but not "prohibitive." As a 
matter of fact, the customs committee is not going to deal with 
tariff policy, as it has delegated this function to the 
customs-tariff council that is being set up within the Russian 
Government. The fiscal side to the tariff policy, however, will 
still fall under the committee's jurisdiction. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature; by diplomatic </F>
correspondents Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others] 
  [Text] Russia believes that the time has come for the world 
community leading members of which are going to attend the 
ministerial meeting in Geneva on May 13 to start an energetic 
political discussion with the conflicting Bosnian sides. 
Otherwise they might never agree. The statement was made in a 
Wednesday interview with Interfax by a special envoy of the 
Russian president, Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin. 
  He added that during the contacts of the last six months the 
differences between the sides deepened rather than shrank. "If 
this continues, there will be no settlement at all. Therefore 
purposeful and energetic influence on the conflicting sides is 
necessary," the diplomat said. 
  He stressed that Moscow expects the Geneva meeting of 
foreign 
ministers of Russia, the USA, Britain (permanent members of the 
UN Security Council), as well as Greece, Germany and Belgium 
(representing the EU) to work out a common strategy for a 
Bosnian settlement. 
  According to Churkin, Russia and its Western partners have 
not yet agreed on their approaches to a settlement. It is the 
purpose of the ministerial meeting to agree to the maximum on 
the approaches and a concrete program of action. So far there 
are only different ideas concerning the way the sides should be 
influenced, Churkin said. 
  On the possibility of using armed force to pressure the 
conflicting Bosnian sides Churkin said there has never been such 
an argument. Any use of force, and this has happened already, 
is prompted by extraordinary circumstances which in their turn 
stem from humanitarian reasons, the existence of safe havens and 
the protection of the UN force in ex-Yugoslavia. Security 
Council resolutions for ex-Yugoslavia did not provide for the 
transition to a diplomacy of force. It is out of the question 
to try to use force to make one of the sides do something for a 
political settlement. 
  Churkin said that by pressure on the conflicting sides he 
means the use of solely political means. 
  In his opinion the Geneva meeting can reach agreement and 
work out a coordinated plan. "Common grounds will be found. The 
question is how far-reaching these common positions are going to 
be. Only the ministerial meeting can show that," Churkin said. 
  The diplomat said that Russia's starting point is quite 
resolute, but he could not promise that the Russian side would 
manage to persuade all participants to share its views. He 
foresaw certain difficulties, but hoped that the common approach 
would be as close as possible to the initial Russian stand. 
  In Churkin's opinion one cannot say that the current 
situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina favors a political settlement. 
The situation is quite the opposite. It is not favorable for a 
political settlement because both the Bosnian Serbs and the 
Muslims are drawn too much by centrifugal forces aimed in the 
opposite direction, in the direction of further military 
confrontation, in particular in the area of Brchko. They 
believe that a political settlement is impossible in principle. 
This does not promote the peace process, of course. 
  The diplomat did not rule out the possibility that the 
Geneva 
meeting might drag out and end on Saturday morning, not on 
Friday as it is planned now.

  [Text] Moscow, 11 May -- A Russian Foreign Ministry 
spokesman today condemned the actions of Bosnian Muslims in the 
vicinity of Brcko in the north east of Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
According to UN observers, on the morning of 10 May the Bosnian 
Army, the Russian Foreign Ministry statement notes, fired 
mortars at the central part of the city of Brcko, which is under 
Bosnian Serb control. There are dead and wounded among its 
civilian population. 
  The provocative actions by the Muslim side in what is 
currently the most explosive region of Bosnia and Herzegovina, 
carried out, moreover, on the eve of the Geneva meeting on 
achieving a Bosnian settlement, could lead to the gravest 
consequences, the Foreign Ministry spokesman pointed out. In 
condemning this action Russia insistently calls on all the sides 
involved in the Bosnian conflict to show maximum restraint and 
self-control at this crucial moment. It is time finally to 
discard illusions of a possible military solution and to resume 
negotiations immediately and unconditionally. Russia will in 
every way promote precisely such a course.

  [Text] Bonn May 11 TASS -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin 
said the leaders of the United Nations, the European Union, the 
United States, Germany, Russia, Britain, France and Yugoslav 
republics must join their efforts in search of ways to resolve 
the Bosnian crisis. 
  Speaking at a joint new conference after his talks with 
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn on Wednesday, Yeltsin said 
that for holding a meeting at such a level all parties must be 
absolutely sure that they will solve the problem. It will also 
require comprehensive preparatory work, he added. 
  The president said the foreign ministers have already held 
talks and begun working on the problem.

  [Text] Vladivostok May 12 TASS -- Confrontation between the 
Vladivostok border guard service and representatives from the 
international Greenpeace organisation, who arrived in the 
maritime territory to drum up support for the protection of the 
Ussuri taiga from massive log felling and industrial pollution, 
is turning into a scandal. 
  A Greenpeace ship cannot leave the Vladivostok port for the 
Svetlaya Bay for the fourth day to inspect activities of the 
Russian-South Korean log felling enterprise. 
  Operating in compliance with Russian legislation, border 
guards approved the call only for the ship's crew members. 
  However, the bulk of the delegation consists of ecologists, 
researchers and journalists who are, in actual fact, passengers 
and, according to Russian laws, have no right to cross Russian 
territorial waters. 
  Commenting on the situation, head of the Vladivostok port 
check point Oleg Sukhanov claimed that the Greenpeace 
deliberately earns scandalous popularity on the conflict with 
authorities. 
  The ship with crew members may go to the bay without any 
problems. The rest of the delegation may go to the bay (some 
500 kilometers from Vladivostok) by other types of 
transportation, for instance, by air. 
  "Despite my great respect for the international `Greens' 
movement, we cannot permit a violation of Russian legislation on 
the protection of the state border," the border guard stressed.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Asia" program] </F>
  [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] says 
that if the DPRK replaces nuclear fuel rods without the 
participation of international inspectors and does not allow the 
analysis of the radioactive waste [pangsa pegimul], it will 
refer the nuclear issue to a special meeting of the UN Security 
Council. Station commentator Valeriy Surikov writes as follows: 
  The DPRK's announcement of its withdrawal from the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty in March 1993 rapidly deteriorated 
relations between Pyongyang and the IAEA. Since then, Pyongyang 
has not completely permitted the international inspection of the 
nuclear sites suspected of nuclear weapons development. 
  The DPRK is expected to replace fuel rods in one of its 
nuclear reactors early in May and had requested the IAEA to 
dispatch its experts to watch the process. However, the IAEA 
did not accede to the request. The IAEA notes that if it is not 
allowed to analyze the radioactive waste, watching the process 
of fuel rod replacement will not produce a desired effect. 
  With the analysis of the radioactive waste, the IAEA can 
assess if the North is developing nuclear weapons, they say. 
Thus, a new conflict broke out between Pyongyang and the IAEA. 
  Pyongyang informed the IAEA that it would replace the fuel 
rods of the reactor without the participation of the 
international inspectors. In the meantime, the IAEA warned 
Pyongyang that it is prepared to resolve the nuclear issue by 
the convocation of a special meeting of the UN Security Council. 
  It is not unpredictable where such a conflict will lead. The 
United Nations can apply economic sanctions against the DPRK. 
The United States and the ROK have long demanded such 
sanctions. However, there still is a chance to resolve the issue 
through diplomatic efforts. All the countries concerned should 
continue their efforts for the adoption of a reasonable 
decision. It should not be forgotten that the tactic of talk, 
rather than the tactic of pressure, is more desirable.

  [Text] Moscow and Pyonggang have a serious differing of 
opinions on what concerns human rights for North Korean citizens 
working on timber-cutting plants in the Far East. This was 
stated by a high-ranking Russian diplomat specializing in Korean 
issues. 
  He repeated that in accordance with the agreement between 
the 
former USSR and North Korea several thousand North Koreans are 
working on Russian timber-cutting plants in the Far East. The 
term of the agreement expired in late 1993. A Russian 
delegation has recently left for North Korea in order to discuss 
the new agreement on timber-cutting works. The Russian party 
especially insists on several provisions of this agreement. "In 
particular, we demand that human rights of North Korean citizens 
be respected in accordance with the Russian legislation and 
international standards," the diplomat pointed out. 
  He added that the issues on human rights caused "certain 
irritation" on the part of North Korea. "Our colleagues from 
North Korea state that everything is all right with them in the 
sphere of human rights. However, according to non-official 
information, North Korean representatives on the timber-cutting 
plants sometimes take the passports of North Koreans working 
there so that they cannot leave for South Korea or for any other 
third country. They do not always receive all their money," the 
diplomat said. 
  He emphasized that Russia wanted all North Koreans on its 
territory to have passports with them. "I hope we will manage to 
settle all contradictions with the North Korean leadership 
without violating the international law and the legislation of 
our countries," the Russian diplomat stated. 
  South Korean sources announced that the North Korean 
leadership was going to send back many of North Korean timber 
workers so that they do not go to South Korea. The Russian 
diplomat said he was bewildered with such information. "In fact, 
this would mean wrecking Russian-North Korean cooperation in the 
sphere of timber-cutting works and would make conclusion of a 
new agreement more difficult," the diplomat suggested. 
  However, he underlined that Russia had not undertaken to 
repatriate North Koreans unwilling to return to their home 
country. "If a person is on Russian territory and the person 
committed no illegal actions we have no reasons to hinder their 
departure to a third country," the Russian diplomat said.

  [Text] Moscow May 11 TASS--"The Russian side is satisfied 
with practically everything in the deal to sell Malaysia 18 
MiG-29 fighters and Moscow considers it beneficial," a Russian 
Foreign Ministry top official said. 
  In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Wednesday, Anatoliy 
Khmelnitskiy, head of the second Asia department of the Russian 
Foreign Ministry, said that "presently, the Russian-Malaysian 
deal estimated at about 600 million U.S. dollars is at the final 
stage of consideration. There are no serious obstacles for its 
signing." 
  A Russian delegation led by Deputy Foreign Minister 
Aleksandr 
Panov has just returned from Malaysia where it held a series of 
fruitful meetings and talks. They aimed at specifying the 
details of a large package of agreements now in the works, 
Khmelnitskiy said. 
  Apart from selling MiG fighters to Malaysia, the sides also 
discussed the possibility of launching the production of spare 
parts for them in Malaysia. Bilateral agreements between the 
two countries have committed them to establish a sound 
maintenance base and teach Malaysian pilots to fly Russian MiG 
fighters. 
  Malaysia will pay part of the deal with palm oil. "This fact 
must not worry Russian people. Malaysian palm oil is not only a 
highly nutritious product, but is also indispensable in various 
industries, including aerospace industry," Khmelnitskiy said. 
  If the deal goes through, Malaysia will be the first 
Southeast Asian country to be granted access to Russian weapons 
and military technologies.

<F P=106> [V. Voropayev video report; from the "Dalniy Vostok" program] </F>
  [Text] Although agreement on the demarcation of the 
eastern sector of the Russian-Chinese border was reached three 
years ago, the fate of the border islands near Khabarovsk still 
remains unclear. The Chinese side is claiming the Bolshoy 
Ussuriyskiy and Tarabarovskiy Islands, and if their reasoning on 
defining the line of the border is accepted the international 
boundary will be practically in the center of Khabarovsk. The 
issue of demarcation of this sector has been temporarily set 
aside and this uncertainty must worry those who live here. 
[Video shows unidentified correspondent interviewing Colonel 
General A.I. Nikolayev, commander in chief of the Russian Border 
Troops] 
  [Begin Nikolayev recording] Today's visit to Khabarovsk, to 
the Far East Border District, is a fundamental part of the 
measures Russia is taking to protect its interests in the Far 
East. There are quite a number of issues directly connected 
with Khabarovsk Kray, the Jewish Autonomous Oblast, and the Amur 
Oblast arising from problems which the border troops must solve. 
The border with China is changing and conditions on the state 
border must be such as to conform with the relations between our 
two states. All this is being done in the context of the 
discussion process currently in progress between the Russian 
Federation and the PRC. It is very important for me to find out 
how the approach developed by the Foreign Ministry and the 
Federal Border Service will be perceived in connection with the 
forthcoming signing of the Russian-Chinese border agreement. 
[end recording] 
  However, the inhabitants of the border territories are 
ignorant of this approach at present. According to newspaper 
reports, diplomatic representatives of both countries meeting in 
Beijing have not made any progress in resolving the problem of 
the islands. The only reassuring thing is that Russia is 
rejecting the PRC's territorial claims. Meanwhile, the Japanese 
magazine Sentaku, issue No. 12 of last year, reported that the 
question has been resolved and mutual agreement reached on 
handing over the disputed islands near Khabarovsk to the PRC. 
True, the Japanese magazine does not quote the source of the 
information. At the same time, Chinese maps of Heilongjiang 
Province for some time now have shown the islands near 
Khabarovsk, which the neighboring country is claiming, in the 
same colors as the Chinese territory. Understandably, all this 
is simply political fantasy. However, the inhabitants of 
Khabarovsk must be worried by the mass of reservations and vague 
wording of the sparse and contradictory information about the 
islands.

  [Text] Moscow May 11 TASS -- Chairman of the Russian 
Government, Viktor Chernomyrdin, believes that only a strictly 
balanced budget can mobilize the market. A statement to this 
effect was made by the Russian prime minister on Wednesday as he 
addressed lawmakers of the State Duma during debates on a draft 
law on the state budget for 1994. 
  According to Chernomyrdin, the suggested figures of 
budgetary 
expenditures and revenues and the budget deficit envisaged by 
the draft law and insisted upon by the Russian Government will 
enable to keep inflation rates under control. 
  If the suggested federal budget is not approved by the State 
Duma as soon as possible, the Government will be devoid of 
starting points necessary for the formation of its economic 
policy. If the Duma approves of key figures of the state 
budget, Russian lawmakers jointly with the Government will be 
able to finalize the draft in a calm and orderly way, 
redistribute funds and decide "where to channel extra funds and 
at whose expense," Chernomyrdin said.

requested and the sum on offer is so great that the armed 
forces' continued existence is at stake. For example, the 
Russian Defense Ministry is asking for 87 trillion rubles, while 
the Ministry of Finance is insisting on allocating just 37 
trillion rubles. 
  According to the Defense Ministry, the Finance Ministry has 
pared spending on the military to the bone. Arrears have been 
run up on all major expenditure items. The military is now in 
the position of having insufficient funds, not only to pay 
salaries, but also to buy food and equipment and to pay its 
bills. Lengthy delays in issuing servicemen's pay packets are 
now routine.

  [Text] The State Duma passed a federal law on state foreign 
debts and Russia's credits granted to foreign states in the 
first hearing Wednesday. 
  The draft law provides for an annual setting by a federal 
law 
of the maximum volume of credits used within a fiscal year and 
representing part of Russia's foreign debt. The maximum volume 
of foreign loans taken by the state shall not exceed the annual 
volume of payments in service and repayment of Russia's foreign 
debt. 
  The draft law envisions that Russia's international treaties 
on state loans and Russia's state credits to foreign states are 
subject to ratification whenever they exceed 100 million dollars. 
  The State Duma also passed a federal law on the maximum 
volume of state loans and Russia's state credits to foreign 
states in 1994 Wednesday. 
  According to the law, the maximum volume of Russia's loans 
in 
1994 is set at 4.7 billion dollars, while Russia's credits to 
foreign states in 1994 at 400 million dollars. 
  The two federal laws were sent for consideration by the 
Federation Council, the upper house of the Russian parliament.

  [Text] Moscow May 12 TASS -- The Russian State Duma began 
examining President Yeltsin's remarks on the Duma deputy status 
law. The Duma part of the Russian parliament's Conciliation 
Commission was formed today. It is headed by vice-Speaker of 
the State Duma Valentin Kovalev. The commission also include 
the authors of the law -- Chairman of the Duma Organisational 
Committee Vladimir Bauer, his deputy Igor Shichanin, and also 
members of the Duma Committee for Legisaltion professors of law 
Viktor Vishnyakov and Oleg Mironov. 
  "The commission has already begun its work," Valentin 
Kovalev 
told ITAR-TASS. Asked when it will be completed, he replied 
that "quite a few subtle constitutional and legislative problems 
have cropped up". Kovalev noted that "all this process is most 
extraordinary, because the president recommends the State Duma 
to suspend the action of several norms". He recalled that "the 
procedure for such a suspension was not envisaged by the 
constitutional legislation. This is why the Duma is confronted 
with several extremely difficult problems affecting its reaction 
to the letter even though it is most favourably disposed towards 
it". 
  Kovalev said that "it was first of all necessary to solve 
several procedural matters, in other words to establish our 
competence to suspend these norms and then to get down to the 
crux of the matter". He stressed that a solution would be found 
within the frameworks of the Conciliation Commission, which will 
"satisfy the Council of the Federation, the State Duma, and the 
president". 
  Kovalev said that the president's remarks were "quite 
extensive" and included almost six typewritten pages.

<F P=106> [Sergey Chugayev report: "Ivan Rybkin Is Opposition's New </F>
Target"] 
  [Text] Judging by the information emerging from the State 
Duma, the first plenary session to be held in that parliamentary 
chamber's new building -- the former building of the Ministry of 
the Economy -- on 11 May has every chance of returning us to the 
atmosphere of parliamentary political crisis so characteristic 
of the former Russian Federation Supreme Soviet. 
  This time the speaker of the chamber, Ivan Rybkin, could 
become the victim of a showdown among deputies. The opposition 
seems to have begun seriously to consider putting into effect 
the threat voiced at the last plenary session by Deputy S. 
Baburin to examine the State Duma chairman's personal file if he 
went ahead and signed the Treaty on Social Accord. Ivan Rybkin, 
as people will know, ignored the threats and signed the treaty, 
and it is to be supposed that the revenge of the former comrades 
in arms of the Russian Unity bloc will not be long in coming, 
particularly as the speaker has long caused acute irritation to 
the majority of left-wing factions by his desire to cooperate 
with the executive branch and his firm refusal to play a 
Khasbulatov role in the Duma. 
  If the "Rybkin personal file" is put on the agenda, the Duma 
chairman could be placed in a pretty difficult position. Deputy 
Baburin's initiative will not, of course, be supported by the 
right-wing factions -- Russia's Choice, Yabloko [the Yavlinskiy 
bloc], the 12 December group, or the majority of centrists -- 
the members of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord [PRES], 
Women of Russia, and New Regional Policy factions. 
  There is no reason to expect unity in the left-wing section 
in the Duma hall of sessions either. The Agrarians, who will be 
asked to oppose their own nominee, will find themselves in a 
difficult position. And the already small Democratic Party of 
Russia [DPR] faction has been split since its leader, N. 
Travkin, joined the government. So only the Communist Party of 
the Russian Federation [CPRF] faction and the small Russian Path 
group of deputies are consistent and firm opponents of Rybkin. 
  Much could be resolved here by the stance of the Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR]. From a superficial 
standpoint it would be illogical for Zhirinovskiy to oppose a 
fellow signatory of the treaty. However, it cannot be ruled out 
that the Liberal Democrat faction will form a bloc with the 
Communists on this occasion. Admittedly, this will only happen 
in the event of a guarantee that the vacated speaker's chair 
goes, for example, to A. Vengerovskiy, first deputy chairman of 
the LDPR and deputy chairman of the Duma. However, it is 
difficult to imagine the Communists and the members of Russian 
Path agreeing to pay such a price for Rybkin's resignation. 
  A far greater threat to the State Duma chairman is posed not 
by the configuration of forces in this chamber of parliament but 
by the theoretical possibility of a revision of the results of 
the election for speaker. As you will recall, Rybkin scraped a 
majority. Moreover, dubious ballot slips, which were deemed 
invalid, were discovered when the ballot boxes were opened. 
Many contentious issues also remain over the determination of 
the quorum for voting. All this gives grounds for questioning 
the legitimacy of Rybkin's election. And here the opposition 
could gain allies in the shape of a number of radical deputies 
from right-wing factions. 
  All this clamor raised over the figure of Ivan Rybkin -- 
the first person in the history of contemporary Russian 
parliamentarianism to have tried to turn parliament from a 
political club into a genuine legislative body -- shows very 
graphically that periods of political stability in Russia's life 
remain of short duration, lasting as a rule less than a month. 
The pattern here is obvious. And there is scarcely any point 
in seeking the cause of the latest potential minicrisis solely 
in the spoiling tactics of Deputy Baburin and like-minded 
individuals from the Accord for Russia movement. It is 
difficult to expect political stability in a country with an 
unstable economy. 
  This latest, expected spiral in political tension coincides 
to perfection with the advent of a new stage of economic crisis 
in Russia. Our home-produced consumer goods have begun to lose 
out in price to imported goods. In the opinion of leading 
economists in the country, the domestic economy is already in a 
crisis of overproduction. The first reaction to this was the 
demands at the start of the year to increase import duties. 
  The political forces existing in Russia today propose two 
ways out of this situation: either a drive to solve the 
nonpayments crisis by the classic method -- through the 
bankruptcy of enterprises -- or reversion to a closed economy. 
This, of course, is to protect home producers. The first path 
is long and hard. To start moving along it you need at least 
six months in order to prepare the legislative base -- to 
change, in particular, the Law on Enterprises, to introduce laws 
on bills of exchange and bankruptcy, to seek a solution to the 
problem of the depressed regions, and to do much, much more 
besides. On the other hand, if Russia does manage to complete 
this path, real grounds will emerge for discussing the 
possibility of genuine stability not just in the economy but in 
politics too. 
  Recent actions by the president indicate that he has decided 
to go in precisely this direction and has opted to pursue this 
path toward an open economy for at least two years. 
  At the same time there is a real prospect that uncompetitive 
economic structures will unite, their main demand being a 
restoration of the closed economy. The military-industrial 
complex is seen as the undisputed leader here. Its financial 
potential and links with the power structures and the special 
services could turn such an amalgamation into a powerful force 
-- and not just a political force. And the longer Russia takes 
to overcome the crisis, the greater this force's chances of 
winning victory, even by unconstitutional means, will be. The 
strengthening of imperialist and nationalist motifs in the 
policy of various parties reflects this trend. 
  Ultimately the question comes down to whether the president 
and government will manage to extricate the country from crisis 
by the next presidential election. 
  There are grounds for thinking that at the current stage of 
development of the political situation in Russia the president 
sees his main task as inducing the opposition to operate solely 
within the constitutional framework and thereby avoiding another 
threat of a putsch or coup, because since 12 December the 
opposition, contesting the president on the constitutional 
field, has been unable to pose any special danger to him. The 
campaign launched to collect signatures in favor of the Treaty 
on Civil Accord, which is designed to consolidate the 
president's constitutional role, is, I think, primarily linked 
to this. 
  Both in August '91 and last October Boris Yeltsin was 
victorious, not because he relied on the law (regrettably we 
cannot talk about respect for the law and legal standards in 
Russia today), but solely thanks to the support of the people. 
However, as the results of the elections to local organs of 
power show, this support does not appear unconditional today. 
The people are withdrawing from politics. The president is 
forced to rely more and more on the political and state 
nonmenklatura. 
  The diplomatic domestic political activity demonstrated by 
Boris Yeltsin in recent days -- the unpublicized renewal of 
contacts with Yu. Skokov, leader of the military-industrial 
complex, and the appointment of N. Travkin to the government -- 
stems, it may be supposed, from awareness of this fact. It is 
clear that the president is seeking to utilize all levers to 
prevent any change before 1996 to the strategic economic course, 
the main threat to which could be posed today by 
unconstitutional actions on the part of the opposition.

<F P=106> [Report by Pavel Anokhin: "We Have Crossed Threshold of </F>
Political Terrorism"] 
  [Text] The murder of State Duma deputy Andrey Ayzderdzis 
is still the focus of attention of Russian society. For all 
that we are now growing used to reports of contract killings, 
the crime committed in Khimki looks like a cynical challenge to 
the state. A number of politicians assess what has happened as 
an act of political terrorism. We asked several deputies to 
comment on the story that the parliamentarian's murder was 
political. 
  Vladimir Lysenko, cochairman of the Russian Federation 
Republican Party, "Yabloko" bloc faction: 
  First of all we must proceed from the fact that it was a 
man, 
not a deputy, who was killed. Unfortunately some 
parliamentarians are using the incident for political purposes. 
That is hardly sensible. Especially as it is not yet 
completely clear what lies behind this: a political act or a 
settling of scores as a result of the dead man's extensive 
business activity over the past three years... 
  Aleksandr Osovtsov, "Russia's Choice" faction: 
  I am sure that the murder is not political. If some forces 
wanted to destabilize the situation in society by killing one of 
the deputies, then, bringing to mind only the deceased's good 
side, I can say that they could have found more important 
figures.... 
  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Liberal Democratic 
Party 
of Russia [LDPR], LDPR faction: 
  Of course it is a political assassination. It is notable 
that it was committed on the eve of May Day. When another 10-20 
deputies have been put in their graves we will all understand 
and agree. 
  Father Gleb Yakunin, "Russia's Choice" faction: 
  The murder is hardly political. Nonetheless the answer may 
be learned when the criminal is caught. You say Aleksandr Men 
was killed and the killer has not yet been found? But it is not 
only in our country but also in the developed countries, where 
the law enforcement organs' system works brilliantly, that there 
are unsolved crimes. It is a pity that Zhirinovskiy is using 
the incident to build up more hysteria for his own benefit. 
  Sergey Baburin, leader of the Russian All-National Union: 
  The question of the state of the struggle against crime and 
the defense of human rights is serious. In addition to the 
tragic incident involving Andrey Ayzderdzis there have been many 
incidents of attacks on deputies and arson at their apartments. 
Now it is a case of expanding political terror and in addition 
to ordinary murders there are targeted political crimes. Today 
we have found ourselves in a qualitatively new situation -- we 
have crossed the threshold of political terrorism. And that is 
natural since the entire economic activity of the present 
executive power presupposes the formation of a mafioso-criminal 
society. 
  Georgiy Zadonskiy, "Russia's Choice" faction: 
  The murder of the State Duma deputy is the first tragic case 
in the present parliament. Several stories are being worked up 
involving personal, professional, domestic, or commercial 
motives on the basis of the figure of the victim himself. So 
far one thing is clear: It was a premeditated murder. 
  The incident should serve as grounds for a tough hearing on 
questions of crime. There are various levels of crime. And 
where organized crime arises there is a threat to the entire 
country's national security. 
  Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, leader of the "Yabloko" bloc and 
parliamentary faction: 
  In our view the problems of crime lie in the economic 
situation in which we find ourselves. Judge for yourselves: We 
have a production decline of 25 percent and unemployment is just 
1 percent. That means that an enormous number of people are 
involved in business about which the country has only an 
approximate idea. Some people are working in their private plots 
but probably most are engaged in illegal or semilegal, criminal, 
or semicriminal business. And there is also street crime, crime 
by children, with which the country is not concerned at all. 
What should we do? The government must earmark a federal 
program in the budget and show what it intends to do in this 
direction. Our government has still not set out its economic 
program in general.

  [Text] On May 9 (Victory Day) former Russian Supreme Soviet 
speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov met Chechen citizens in the mountain 
village of Benoy (southeastern Chechnya, 100 kilometers away 
from Groznyy - IF). Interfax learned that more than 20,000 
people, including inhabitants of neighboring Dagestan showed up 
at the rally. 
  Khasbulatov emphasized the necessity for normalization of 
relations with Russia. He suggested that this would contribute 
to stabilization of the situation in Chechnya and would bring 
positive changes in the lives of the Chechen poor. He stressed 
that the peoples must not suffer from the ambitions of certain 
politicians. 
  A deputy Chechen interior minister who was present at the 
rally called this an appeal to be within the composition of 
Russia and urged that there be no speculation on this sensitive 
issue. Khasbulatov replied that he had just expressed his 
opinion. "Issues on state relations are not solved during 
rallies," he remarked. 
  The Chechen presidential structures told Interfax that the 
appeal by Khasbulatov had received practically no support.

<F P=106> [Yelena Tregubova report under the "Regions" rubric: </F>
"Former Oblast Party Secretary Elected Komi President. 
Industrial Lobby Proved To Be Stronger than Agricultural One"] 
  [Text] The presidential elections in the Republic of Komi, 
which were held 8 May, were won by Yuriy Spiridonov, speaker of 
the local Supreme Soviet. According to a preliminary tally, 
Yuriy Spiridonov won 51 percent of the vote. His main rival, 
Vyacheslav Khudyayev, chairman of the republic's Council of 
Ministers, garnered 33 percent, the press service of the Komi 
Supreme Soviet reported. 
  Political figures in Komi pointed out that Vyacheslav 
Khudyayev's election drive against Yuriy Spiridonov, former 
first secretary of the CPSU oblast committee, was actively 
supported by Veniamin Osipov, former oblast party second 
secretary. It is so "wide a choice between the first and second 
secretaries" that prompted the local branch of Democratic Russia 
to distance itself completely from the election campaign, saying 
that it will back only "a new, democratic leader when he 
emerges." Komi communists, who have initially also made a point 
of distancing themselves from the elections, at the eleventh 
hour announced their support for Vyacheslav Khudyayev. Local 
observers attribute this change to the fact that Mr. Khudyayev 
"represents the interests of a significant part of the old party 
and management elite, and also the directors of the state-owned 
farms." Among local democrats, talk is under way that 
Vyacheslav Khudyayev, "who has effectively exercised supreme 
authority in the republic recently, has so energetically lobbied 
for the interests of Komi state-owned farm directors that he 
gave local agricultural chiefs 80 percent out of the centralized 
loans worth 20 billion rubles received recently virtually for 
free." 
  Meanwhile, the republic's industrialists, particularly the 
director of Komineft, the enterprise considered "Komi's main 
source of money," threw their weight behind Yuriy Spiridonov 
during the election campaign. 
  Leonid Zilberg, leader of the local Republican Party, said 
in 
a conversation with your SEGODNYA correspondent that he welcomes 
Yuriy Spiridonov's election to the post of president, "because 
he at least does not hamper very much the emergence of new 
entrepreneurial structures and attracts foreign investors to the 
republic thanks to his connections." The leader of the 
Republicans thinks that "it is precisely thanks to Spiridonov's 
efforts that today Komi has the highest investment level in 
comparison with other regions of the Russian Federation." 
  Leonid Zilberg believes, however, that "not only economic, 
but also ethnic leanings of the contenders had a role to play 
during the election campaign, because Yuriy Spiridonov is a 
Russian and Vyacheslav Khudyayev is a Komi." In the opinion of 
the Republican Party chief, "in the end, Spiridonov won the 
elections because Russians make up the majority of population in 
the Republic of Komi." 
  Other party leaders are certain, however, that purely ethnic 
considerations should not be seen as a "priority" factor for 
both contenders for the presidency, "because each of them 
expresses the interests of entirely specific elite groups all 
the same." It is expected that upon Yuriy Spiridonov's 
assumption of power his loyal allies -- Anatoliy Karakchiyev, 
administration chief of the city of Syktyvkar, and Vladimir 
Torlopov, deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers, who are 
both ethnic Komi -- will have the key roles to play in his 
future cabinet.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valentin Pavlov] </F>
  [Text] Barnaul May 11 TASS -- A three-day session of the 
Scientific Council of the programme to investigate the "distant 
radiation after-effects of the Semipalatinsk nuclear tests on 
the population of Altay territory" began here today. 
  Invited to take part in it, in addition to the participants 
of the "Semipalatinsk programme", were scientists from almost 60 
research institutes, who have discovered hitherto unknown 
documents on Soviet nuclear tests, and their opponents. 
  The participation of the latter, according to Valeriy 
Kiselev, director of the regional Medico-Ecological Problems 
Research Institute, is most important, because their views will 
allow the session to see more clearly the weak points of the 
programme and to further the ongoing investigations. 
  As distinct from previous sessions, the current one will 
work 
only in plenum, which will allow it to create new conditions for 
the inter-disciplinary interaction of various specialists: 
Physicists, chemists, biologists, physicians and social 
scientists. Such complex studies are most necessary today. 
After all, Altay, which was affected by more than 58 nuclear 
blasts in the period from 1949 to 1990, and also by the first 
explosion of a thermonuclear bomb in August 1953, was turned 
into a sort of "human survival testing ground". Only the 
picture of the 1949 explosion was modelled so far. Much work is 
yet to be done on the other tests. But the after-effect of 
Soviet nuclear tests on the Altay population is well known. 
They are more terrible than those of the Chernobyl disaster, 
because the local population was exposed not once, but many 
times over to irradiation with radionuclides with a short period 
of decay. 
  The session will analyse in detail the incidence of diseases 
among the territory's population, which was affected by 
explosions on the Semipalatinsk testing ground. According to 
Kiselev, the international scientific community expects from the 
parties to the programme a thorough analysis of the medical 
after-effects of nuclear tests, because a massive examination of 
all the people affected by radiation was carried out for the 
first time in Altay, which has involuntarily become a sort of 
research laboratory. 
  The session will discuss the results of 1993 scientific 
works 
and the main directions of further studies. Moreover, it will 
be an important landmark in the preparations for an 
international conference on the "radiation test" programme, 
which will be held in Altay this September.

  [Text] In the near future a Northern border district will 
be set up in Murmansk. It will include the territories from the 
Murmansk region to Chukotka, Governor of the Murmansk region 
Yevgeniy Komarov said at a conference in Murmansk dedicated to 
protection of Russia's northern borders. 
  He said that the border service in the Arctic region is 
being 
restructured, taking into account the development of large-scale 
ties between the Russian Federation, Norway and Finland, and the 
opening of the Northern sea route for passage of foreign vessels 
with stops in Russian ports. Besides, the need for the Northern 
border district is dictated by the increased interest of NATO in 
Russia's northern borders.

  [Text] Vladivostok May 11 TASS -- A large-scale operation, 
code-named "Foreigner", was launched on the entire maritime 
territory of the Russian Far East, beginning from 00 hours 
today. It is being carried out by Interior Ministry forces with 
the help of procurators, customs officials, and other services. 
  The main purpose of the operation is to check the observance 
of Russian residence laws and regulations by foreigners. 
  It is an open secret that the territory is now overrun by 
guests from CIS countries and other foreign states. What is 
more, their numbers can hardly be properly recorded. Many of 
them come to Russia legally, but then settle here arbitrarily, 
engaging in poaching, shady businesses, and other not very 
seemly occupations. Many come to the territory illegally, with 
forged documents, while some even have no documents at all. 
  Particularly many foreigners have settled in the Ussuri 
Taiga, which they are devastating most ruthlessly and 
impudently. Officials of the territorial interior department 
hope the operation "Foreigner", expected to last until May 20, 
will help the foreign guests to "learn the particulars" of the 
regulations in force and to respect Russia's laws.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Yuriy Grachev] </F>
  [Text] Vladivostok May 12 TASS -- It remains to see whether 
the population of the maritime territory (the Russian far east) 
will be able to survive next winter. This is how the situation 
was described by participants of an extraordinary meeting of the 
Council of the Maritime Trade Union Federation and the 
Coordination Committee for Joint Actions, which took place here 
today. The meeting discussed the extraordinary situation in the 
territory, which is deteriorating with every passing day. 
  More than one-third of the territory's production capacities 
have already come to a standstill. The number of unemployed has 
topped 10,000, according to official figures. Unofficial 
sources claim their number is five times bigger. 
  The average monthly cost of a basket of 19 staple foodstuffs 
now equals to 100,000 rubles in the maritime territory as 
against 46,000 rubles in the Russian capital and in the rest of 
the country. According to the most modest estimates, forty per 
cent of the territory's population are now below the poverty 
line. 
  The cost of power-carriers is growing and the sum of default 
payments has grown to astronomic figures due to this. For 
instance, the local enterprises owe only "Dalenergo" (far 
eastern power society) as much as 200 billion rubles. The main 
power supplier is on the verge of bankruptcy. It has no money 
even to carry out current repairs and to prepare for the winter 
season. 
  The cost of coal has increased. The local consumers were 
compelled to give up using imported and liquid fuel. The local 
resources, which have to be regularly augmented, have diminished 
to a critical level. The participants of the meeting pointed 
out that the Russian government, overlooking the region's 
specific features, was continuing to increase taxes and tariffs 
on electricity, thereby contributing to the boosting of 
socio-economic tension in the maritime territory. 
  The centre's latest instruction to raise the cost of one 
kilowatt of electricity makes the situation in the territory 
simply explosive. This view was shared by the heads of urban 
and district administrations of the territory, executives and 
managers. 
  In their opinion, preferential tariffs for electricity 
should 
be fixed to pull the maritime territory out of the social, fuel 
and power crisis. They also called for the territory's 
inclusion in the list of regions of the far north and 
application to it of the law on privileges to their population, 
paid from the federal budget. Moreover, they believe it is 
necessary to change the taxation system by differentiating it 
and substantially reducing the taxes on profits, collected from 
enterprises. 
  The meeting recommended Vladimir Ignatenko, the presidential 
representative, to urgently inform Boris Yeltsin on the 
situation in the maritime territory.

<F P=106> [Interview with new mayor of Vladivostok Konstantin </F>
Tolstoshein by Valentina Bratchikova; date not given: "Action 
is What is Needed. How to Create Equilibrium in Vladivostok"] 
  [Text] Vladivostok -- Many will remember the scandal that 
erupted over the former mayor of Vladivostok, Viktor Cherepkov. 
Our dialogue with the new mayor, Konstantin Borisovich 
Tolstoshein, began with an assessment of this situation. 
  [Bratchikova] Tell me, did it not bother you that people 
would be doubly prejudiced when assessing your every step? 
Indeed the psychological background, to be frank, is very 
complex and the rumor mill tends to compare, to lay it on thick, 
to look for mercenary intentions.... 
  [Tolstoshein] I am 42. I have managed in my time to work in 
various leading posts, so I was not particularly seeking power. 
I also know there is still plenty of life left in my batteries. 
  Everyone got tired of the endless political wrangling a long 
time ago. I said as much to my staff when I arrived in city 
hall: If you want to engage in politics, join parties or 
movements; what is required of you here is action. What are you 
missing? Independence? Initiative? Please, take what you want, 
I'm not going to stop you. But first of all we have to 
establish equilibrium in the city. We agreed on that. 
  Things were particularly disgraceful for our veterans and 
those who had fought in Afghanistan. Practically all the stores 
in the city had been privatized, but they had simply forgotten 
about these people, struck them off the list. Justice had to be 
restored. Ten or so extra retail outlets have been opened for 
their personal use and we want to win back through the courts 
the stores that were bought by fraudulent means.... 
  Remember last winter -- the city nearly froze to death due 
to 
the lack of coal and petroleum products. The city managers, 
however, were shouting from the housetops: There is enough 
fuel... To prevent a repetition of this we embarked on 
preparations for next winter before the arrival of spring. 
  [Bratchikova] So the economy began to recover swiftly... 
  [Tolstoshein] Of course, you cannot solve everything in just 
over a month. But there are areas where we must not delay. For 
example, the fight against crime. We can increase the staffs of 
law-enforcement organs, give them more funds, and buy the latest 
technology and equipment. We began by giving guarantees that 
housing would be provided for everyone who needed it. Not only 
command personnel, but warrant officers and petty officers. The 
idea is not to recruit new people and teach them ways of 
combatting the mafia, but to keep those who have proved their 
worth, prevent them from going off in pursuit of "big bucks," 
and provide their families with the basics at least. 
  [Bratchikova] How do you view the willingness of foreign 
countries -- neighbors in the Asia-Pacific region -- to give us 
humanitarian, economic, and other aid? Are we that poor and 
feeble? 
  [Tolstoshein] I believe we have not yet been able properly 
to take advantage of the fact that Vladivistok has become an 
open port. Open to cooperation, to business partnership. Five 
consulates -- it must mean something! You don't even need to go 
to the countries they represent, since much can be agreed upon 
on the spot. You just have to effect a radical, 180-degree 
change in your attitude toward foreign economic activity -- I 
discussed this recently with the heads of leading enterprises in 
the city. There are things we can teach foreigners and we have 
our fair share of natural resources -- timber, fish, minerals. 
But we have a lot to learn from them, for example, construction 
organization, entrepreneurial methods, and business skills. 
  For example, I am about to go to South Korea, where we will 
discuss the details of the joint construction of a regional 
business center in Vladivostok. They are providing the finance. 
We are providing a small plot of land in the city. Not forever, 
but on a 50-year lease. In a year's time we will have at our 
disposal a splendid, fully equipped modern center, which will 
help us organize small and medium-size business in the kray in a 
whole new way. 
  [Bratchikova] There was a big agricultural fair in 
Vladivostok recently. At it people were able to buy at 
rock-bottom prices food, agricultural equipment for work on 
subsidiary plots, and much else. Is this a once-only event or 
do you intend to continue to revive these fine, but forgotten 
traditions in the city? 
  [Tolstoshein] By means of the fair you are talking about we 
were not only doing battle with the middlemen, we were also 
demonstrating that the Maritime Kray countryside is not 
impoverished, that it is possible, indeed essential to work with 
it on mutually advantageous terms. We will continue to develop 
this kind of open trade in squares. In the next few days we 
will be holding a fish fair, where we will be offering citizens 
fresh fish and other absolutely fresh seafood they have been 
longing for... So there are many plans, and I hope they will be 
implemented.

  [Text] Ukraine's Defense Ministry has so far given no 
consideration to Russia's program alternative to NATO's 
Partnership for Peace scheme, Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaly 
Radetsky said. 
  "We are still working out our vision" of the North Atlantic 
alliance's scheme, whose implementation poses "many problems" 
for Ukraine, Radetsky told Interfax-Ukraine on Wednesday. One 
of the problems is that Ukraine's military doctrine prevents it 
from joining any blocs, he said.

  [Text] Simferopol -- After a break on 11 May, the work of 
the Crimean Supreme Council's session continued. Following 
consultations with deputies' groups, Crimean Parliamentary 
Speaker Serhiy Tsekov proposed that the candidacies of Oleksiy 
Melnykov and Viktor Mezhak for the posts of Supreme Council 
deputy chairmen be voted on for the second time. As a result of 
the vote, Oleksiy Melnykov and Viktor Mezhak became Republic of 
Crimea Supreme Council deputy chairmen. 
  Oleksiy Melnykov was born in Moscow and served in the 
Pacific 
Fleet and since 1986 in the Black Sea Fleet. He swore 
allegiance to the Armed Forces of the USSR and intends to swear 
no allegiance to anyone else. He was against Black Sea Fleet 
sailors taking an oath of allegiance to the people of Ukraine. 
In his words, there is no Black Sea Fleet problem as it was and 
is Russian. 
  Viktor Mezhak was born in Crimea. His profession is building 
engineer. He was elected as deputy of the City of Simferopol 
and Crimean Oblast Councils of People's Deputies in 1990. He is 
an activist of the Republican Movement of Crimea. He assumed 
the leadership of the People's Party of Crimea in the fall of 
1993. 
  Both deputy speakers represent the Russia bloc, as does the 
speaker, Serhiy Tsekov. 
  Fears of "the Crimean president getting a `puppet' 
parliament," expressed by Refat Chubarov, the leader of the 
[Crimean Tartar people's] Kurultay deputies' group, are, in the 
opinion of observers, proving true. 
  Parliamentary deputies then went on to address the question 
of elections to permanent commissions. Voting resulted in the 
finalization of their number. [There will be] 11 of them. [They 
are the commissions for] credentials, deputies' ethics, and 
Supreme Council work organization; legislation, legality and 
order; state construction; economic policy, and budget and 
financial matters; agrarian matters and food supply; ecology and 
land matters; social matters and health protection; military 
matters; education, science, culture and youth matters; mass 
media and public relations; and deportees' matters. 
  Tsekov said at the parliamentary sitting that it was 
possible 
the third Supreme Council deputy chairman would be elected in a 
while. 
  It has become known from sources close to government circles 
that a Crimean Government delegation, to be led by Deputy Prime 
Minister Yevgeniy Saburov, on 12 May is to fly to Moscow in 
order to sign an agreement on economic cooperation between the 
Republic of Crimea and Russia.

  [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk believes that 
the priority task of the first session of the new Supreme Soviet 
is to determine the issue on the June presidential elections, 
namely whether to hold them on June 26, as the previous 
parliament decided, or after the adoption of the necessary 
legislative basis. 
  During his meeting with the deputies of the new parliament 
on 
Tuesday in Kiev Kravchuk expressed the opinion that "from the 
very beginning the Supreme Soviet should pay attention to the 
conclusion of the work over Ukraine's new Constitution." 
  "The absence of a new Constitution makes the state's 
building 
and the work on choosing authorities for the various branches of 
power difficult," noted Kravchuk. 
  In his words, under the current situation the people will 
come to the elections having no notion "what the results will 
be." 
  At the same time Kravchuk pointed out that "it will be 
difficult to adopt the Constitution as a whole because "it is 
necessary to at least adopt serious well-balanced decrees on 
separate institutions of power to give reliable legal support to 
the election campaign."

<F P=106> [Leonid Kapelyushnyy report: "A Game of Patience with Eight </F>
Aces. The Presidential Race in Ukraine Has Begun. But the 
Elections of the New President Might Not Take Place"] 
  [Text] Odessa -- The presidential elections in Ukraine are 
surrounded by sensation inadvertently triggered by Leonid 
Kravchuk. 
  Long before the presidential race began he said in a radio 
interview with a foreign correspondent that he will not be 
standing in the future elections. 
  The nomination of election contenders took place in the 
traditional, smooth way. At the allotted time the Central 
Electoral Committee accepted the documents and issued signature 
lists to Aleksandr Moroz, leader of the Socialist Party; Leonid 
Kuchma, former prime minister; Vladimir Lanovoy and Viktor 
Pinzenik, former vice premiers; Ivan Plyushch, chairman of the 
last Supreme Council; and Nikolay Rud, a teacher at Kiev 
Technical University and a complete unknown. On the last day 
Education Minister P. Tapanchuk and V. Babich, president of the 
Ukrainian Financial Group joint-stock union, entered the race. 
Admittedly, it was known that in one rural rayon the assembly 
had nominated Leonid Makarovich but he did not respond to that 
at all. 
  It should be explained to the non-Ukrainian reader that the 
presidential elections were initiated by Leonid Kravchuk 
himself. This happened in a situation of deep crisis when the 
country was inundated by a flood of demands for the resignation 
of the president and the Supreme Council. Now a new parliament 
has been elected. There are eight contenders prepared to fight 
for the right to save Ukraine from imminent catastrophe. But 
the newly elected deputies are beginning to be canvassed by 
enterprising free agents who come bearing a letter proposing 
that the presidential elections be postponed. June 26 is not 
the right time. The old Supreme Council got its calculations 
wrong and did not think things out well. 
  Leonid Makarovich has also issued a statement agreeing that 
the elections simply must be postponed to a later date for the 
sake of preserving political stability in the country. 
  Be that as it may, the sociologists are claiming that Leonid 
Kuchma has the highest popularity rating among Ukrainian 
politicians today. People remember his speeches as premier when 
he simply screamed out loud about Ukraine's imminent catastrophe. 
  Ivan Plyushch said candidly in a recent TV interview that he 
had not intended to stand for the presidency but had decided to 
do so only after Leonid Makarovich had assured him that he would 
not be putting his own nomination forward. "Since he is not 
standing I have decided to!" I personally would have been more 
impressed by the ambitious stance and hard-won convictions and 
plans of the political leader had they not been dependent on 
Kravchuk's decision. But that is the kind of man Ivan 
Stepanovich is -- an energetic, somewhat rough and ready man who 
plays the part of the kindly village uncle but who controls his 
audience magnificently, steers the necessary decisions through 
brilliantly, and demolishes the unnecessary ones expertly. 
  I. Plyushch was sincerely confused and did not hide his 
resentment at Leonid Makarovich's sleight of hand. 
  L. Kravchuk does not have to account to anyone why he said 
one thing yesterday but is doing something different today. In 
Ukraine the president's legendary ability of being able to go 
out in the rain without an umbrella and not get wet has been 
confirmed once more. He worked things out with precision and 
bided his time perfectly before entering the campaign to retain 
the presidency. The nomination is not the main move but his 
insurance, his fall-back position. Just in case the elections 
are held. 
  L. Kravchuk believes that the present Ukrainian Constitution 
does not contain a statute on the early election of the 
president. There is a statute on the early termination of power 
as a result of impeachment and -- on the initiative of the 
citizens -- through a referendum. Thus the old parliament 
exceeded its powers. And Leonid Markovich [as published] was 
forced to accept that. 
  In Kravchuk's opinion the violation of the aforementioned 
articles makes the new elections illegitimate. And the blame 
for this situation rests on the old parliament which during four 
years' work did not find the time to adopt a constitution -- the 
only parliament in the Commonwealth not to do so. 
  If the new parliament confirms the decision of the old one, 
all the responsibility will rest on it. Not for the elections 
but for the fate of Ukraine as a whole. That is the president's 
view. And he is absolutely right. 
  In the new Supreme Council 120 deputies have signed their 
names to the protest letter against the presidential elections. 
The rest have doubts. There is not a single fortune teller 
prepared to guess how events will develop at the first session. 
  When setting out the deck of cards showing the presidential 
contenders the voter can work out in theory which card is the 
ace, but how can he tell which suit the trump cards will be?

  [Text] Kiev -- On 10 May at a meeting of the Interregional 
Deputies Group (MDF-Tsentr), more than 20 of its members agreed 
on a joint position with regard to presidential and local 
elections on 26 June. "We are convinced that the presidential 
elections must be held without fail within the time limit 
specified by the law, stressed people's deputy and co-chairman 
of MBR [interregional bloc of reforms] Volodymyr Hrynyov. The 
president's arguments on the political situation concerning the 
elections today do not stand up to criticism and the attempt to 
postpone the elections with the help of the newly elected 
Supreme Council, and by doing so to place all the responsibility 
for this step on it is, in my opinion, destined to fail." 
Leonid Kuchma, co-chairman of the MBR and people's deputy 
stressed that groups of the MBR-Tsentr and other centrist forces 
in the parliament will come up against strong pressure on the 
part of the "party of power" to postpone the elections, but the 
position of the MBR-Tsentr should be firm. "I am convinced, 
said Kuchma, that every day the presidential elections are 
postponed will be destructively reflected not only on the 
economic infrastructure but will also lead to the impoverishment 
of the wider strata of the population. 
  Members of the MBR-Tsentr group had different views on the 
local elections. While not rejecting a renewal of the power 
structures in the localities as a whole, they however, expressed 
concern with the fact the election in 25 oblasts of "little 
presidents" could seriously destabilize the executive vertical 
of power. The group will define its definitive position on the 
election to local bodies of self-government in the course of 
consultations and meetings.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "USDP: `We Are Waiting for Salutary </F>
Legislation'"] 
  [Text] The Ukrainian Peasant Democratic Party [USDP] 
believes that the new Supreme Council body is a step forward -- 
the parliament was joined by outstanding activists of the 
national democratic movement, leading economists, lawyers, 
experts in many branches, and statesmen. For the first time, 
legislators include Ukrainian nationalists who are the people of 
the future. At the same time, the session of the USDP Grand 
Council, which was held recently, posed an anxious question: 
With what will the new parliament begin? In this connection, 
participants in the session adopted an appeal to people's 
deputies which recounts "emergency" bills or, to be more 
precise, salutary bills for our economy and state. 
  In the first place, these include a law on equal trade of 
products with Russia, a law on progressive taxes, and a law on 
stopping profiteering off "cheap" Ukrainian goods on 
international markets. The USDP supports those experts who 
believe that it is necessary to temporarily cancel all quotas 
and licenses save one -- on internal consumption, that is, to 
ban exports of state commodities and property by commercial 
structures. According to peasant democrats, the new parliament 
has to stop the activity of those "joint ventures" which work 
only for the export of goods abroad. They think it is extremely 
necessary to adopt a law on private property, which would 
provide for the preservation of reasonable state control, and to 
launch obligatory privatization in the sphere of trade and 
consumer services. 
  Such "emergency" laws, the appeal notes, are intended to 
create a state budget and abolish destructive economic scissors, 
that is, the situation in which commercial structures are able 
to plunder the state, while the state, in its turn, robs the 
people -- in the first place, industrial workers, pensioners, 
and, particularly, peasants. Only after the economy is 
stabilized, will one be able to introduce the hryvna [Ukrainian 
currency], form a government, and set about on a 
still-more-difficult task -- the promulgation of a new 
constitution. In the unanimous opinion of the USDP Grand 
Council, the new parliament should not start with the 
promulgation of a new constitution, notwithstanding the nudges 
from reactionary forces and even some democrats, as well as 
President Kravchuk himself. Supreme Council deputies differ in 
their views very much, therefore discussion on a draft 
constitution may provoke a permanent and fruitless political 
argument. "People's deputies will argue, while, without a 
budget, the state will go to pieces." Whereas the budget is an 
issue, on which "leftists, rightists, and centrists may come to 
terms." 
  The USDP also appeals to the Supreme Council to not postpone 
presidential elections. "One more day of L. Kravchuk in his 
presidential post,'" the appeal notes, "is one more blow to 
Ukraine, one more step back to neocolonialism." 
  The appeal was signed by USDP Chairman Serhiy Plachynda, 
Deputy Chairman Orest Barabash, academician at the Ukrainian 
Academy of Agricultural Sciences, and Vasyl Shust, member of the 
Grand Council and a farmer.

<F P=106> [Article by S. Pyrozhkov, director of the National Institute </F>
of Strategic Studies: "The Crimea and Ukraine: Problems of 
Mutual Relations"] 
  [Text] Developments in and around the Crimean Republic are 
becoming a more and more important factor in all-Ukrainian 
political life and an object of careful attention at the 
interregional and international levels. Before our very eyes, 
the situation in the Crimea (so far only in terms of politics) 
is gaining more and more symptoms of a strategic problem, the 
resolution of which may turn out to be a tough challenge, not 
only for Ukraine and its neighbors, but also for the world 
community. 
  One can often hear complaints against the fatal mistake, 
which was, in the opinion of certain politicians and analysts, 
the restoration of Crimean autonomy. It is deemed as a 
concealed betrayal of Ukrainian statehood, as well as a result 
of a nomenklatura plot. It would be, however, hardly correct to 
boil down the restoration of Crimean autonomy to highhandedness 
and shortsightedness of certain politicians. It must be kept in 
mind that at that time, in early-1991, Ukraine's leadership was 
facing two problems. 
  First, an all-Crimean referendum was held in January 1991, 
which precisely defined the Crimeans' positive attitude toward 
the very idea of autonomy. This had to be taken into account, 
at least on the eve of the March all-Soviet referendum and 
all-Ukrainian poll. The Ukrainian Supreme Council, headed by 
Leonid Kravchuk, was trying to ensure the broadest possible 
social basis to preserve its political influence on the 
situation all over Ukraine, preventing a loss of control over 
the situation to Moscow politicians. 
  Second, Ukrainian politicians understood that if they were 
not able to reach a quick compromise, first of all with the 
Crimea, Soviet structures would interfere in the developments, 
and then, Ukraine's territorial integrity, which had been 
recently confirmed by the Declaration of State Sovereignty, 
would undoubtedly be threatened. 
  The adoption of the Constitution by the Crimean Supreme 
Council in May 1992 and the appointment of the all-Crimean 
referendum became the apotheosis of confrontation. The decisive 
resistance of the Ukrainian leadership on the one hand, and the 
pressure of the pro-Russian Republican Movement of Crimea on the 
other, called forth a great probability of social conflict. It 
was the weighed position of the Crimean Supreme Council 
Presidium and its Chairman Mykola Bahrov which made it possible 
to put the resolution of the problem on a negotiating process, 
which resulted in a moratorium on the referendum and the 
adoption of the Ukrainian law "On Division of Powers Between the 
State Authorities of Ukraine and the Crimean Republic." 
  The Crimean Constitution, altered in accordance with this 
legislation, was adopted on 25 August 1992. At that very time, 
a certain political intrigue was devised around the question of 
whether legislation on the division of powers was in force or 
not. On the one hand, the Ukrainian Supreme Council did not 
return to the question of adherence of the Crimean Constitution 
to the Ukrainian one. On the other hand, the Ukrainian 
president stated twice in the Supreme Council that legislation 
on the division of powers was in force. The Ukrainian 
Constitutional Court, which would have had to deal with this 
issue, had not yet been established at that time. 
  Thus, the development of state authorities in the Crimea was 
proceeding along these lines. Even though it was the very 
August Constitution that envisioned the office of Crimean 
president, the question of whether its provisions conform to the 
Ukrainian fundamental law was only readdressed 15 months later, 
when the presidential campaign in the Crimea was already in full 
swing. This confirmed, in my opinion, that the state leadership 
was trying to maintain the freedom of political and judicial 
maneuvers in the event of unconstitutional, extremist actions of 
the Crimean ruling structures. On the other hand, Kiev saw 
Mykola Bahrov as a moderate politician willing to accept 
reasonable compromises and able to keep the situation in the 
Crimea under control. 
  Mykola Bahrov consistently pursued the line toward expanding 
Crimea's economic powers, unconditionally regarding it as an 
integral part of Ukraine. He understood that proceeding on the 
path of economic reforms: 

  -  Would provide for the Crimeans a real confirmation of the 
advantage of Crimea's autonomous status; 
  -  Would politically 
isolate extremist forces in the Crimea of any geopolitical 
orientation; 
  -  Would ease pressure on the Ukrainian president and 
Crimea on the part of Ukraine's national-radical forces, which 
display very suspicious attitudes toward developments in the 
Crimea. 
  The June 1993 Ukrainian president's decree and the August 
1993 protocol on introducing the so-called open economy regime 
on the territory of the Crimean Republic were aimed at this very 
goal. Based on these documents, worked out was a whole range of 
fundamental socioeconomic documents which significantly expanded 
Crimean powers within Ukraine. Unfortunately, however, they did 
not become an impulse to action, due to their contradictions 
with legislation already in force. The Ukrainian Supreme 
Council's consideration of the documents concerning the 
"Europe-center" free economic zone showed that the idea of 
decentralizing economic responsibility would not be supported by 
a majority of deputies, who had already joined the election 
marathon, in which it would be the most dangerous thing to be 
accused of having an inefficient dose of old-fashioned 
patriotism. 
  In this way, Mykola Bahrov ended up in front of his voters 
with the collapsing Crimean economy, unimplemented programs for 
economic reforms, and in the crossfire of Crimean and Ukrainian 
"patriots," who have finally achieved their goals: The former 
have obtained a president sharing their political views; the 
latter will continue to consider themselves defenders of the 
nation, since in the Crimea, power was apparently assumed by an 
opponent of Ukrainian statehood and dangerous challenger to 
Ukraine's integrity. 
  It is doubtful that the situation will be changed by the 24 
February 1994 Ukrainian Supreme Council resolution which, a year 
and a half after the adoption of the Crimean Constitution, dared 
to consider a whole range of its provision contradictory to the 
Ukrainian Constitution. The same can also be said about an 
appeal by Supreme Council deputies to the Ukrainian president 
demanding the implementation of the Ukrainian law "On Ukrainian 
President's Representation in the Crimean Republic," which was 
only voiced several weeks after the adoption of a fundamental 
resolution on liquidating the office of presidential 
representatives for the issue of holding the following elections 
for local authorities and self-governments. 
  What is next? Apparently, Kiev has been left without any 
interlocutor in the political dialogue with the Crimea since 
Mykola Bahrov left the political scene. Is this true however? 
  The Crimea is currently represented by Yuriy Meshkov. It is 
interesting that his first visit in this office was to Kiev. 
There was nothing new, however, in his proposals: As a matter 
of fact, they included an appeal to continue the dialogue on 
economic issues, primarily, on implementing the important 
agreements which had previously been reached with Mykola Bahrov. 
  Actually, what can be seen in the actions of the newly 
elected president is succession. Although his campaign rhetoric 
and slogans still stand due to their inertia, the common wisdom 
saying that it is easier to win power than preserve it becomes 
more and more evident. In our hard times, it is possible to 
preserve power by only taking positive steps toward 
stabilization of the economy. One could assume, of course, that 
Yuriy Meshkov regards such developments as a coerced, temporary 
compromise on the path to real independence for the Crimea. 
There is no doubt, however, that there is an objective need to 
take into account the economic situation, the improvement of 
which obviously depends on Crimea's economic integration with 
Ukraine. 
  Undoubtedly, the social basis supporting Yuriy Meshkov's 
most 
radical steps will diminish, as changes for the better appear in 
the Crimean economy, since the majority of those who voted for 
Yuriy Meshkov did so basically because they expected changes for 
the better in the socioeconomic sphere. 
  The invitation of Yevhen Saburov to assume the office of 
Crimean deputy prime minister confirms that the Crimean 
president is reasonable enough in making the most responsible 
decisions. The well-known Russian economist-marketeer, who was 
born in Yalta, is probably the optimal candidate for this high 
office. He has the image of a man who deals exclusively with 
issues of economic transformations, reducing personal political 
ambitions to requirements essential for ensuring conditions for 
reforms. It would be very appropriate if Yevhen Saburov managed 
to carry out his plans in the Crimea, because the peninsula's 
positive experience could be used in other regions of Ukraine. 
  It should be noted that Yevhen Saburov, as early as on the 
first day of his appointment by the Crimean Supreme Council, 
announced that political stability is needed to accomplish his 
mission. He also emphasized that, in his opinion, Ukraine's 
borders must remain unviolated. By the way, the new Crimean 
deputy prime minister asked the then Ukrainian president to 
grant him Ukrainian citizenship. 
  A poll conducted in the Crimea in March 1994 showed that 
Yevhen Saburov's nomination to the office of deputy prime 
minister was fully supported by 77 percent of those surveyed, 
partially -- by 9.4 percent, and not supported -- only by 3.9 
percent, which means that the new deputy prime minister's 
ratings are very high. 
  Gradually, a situation is evolving in which Yevhen Saburov 
may become a compromising figure in the dialogue between 
representatives of both old and new political elites of the 
Crimea, as well as between Simferopol and Kiev. This provides 
for all participants in the political process substantial 
chances of reaching accord, as well as of saving political face 
in the eyes of their supporters. 
  As everybody knows, on 10 March 1994, Yuriy Meshkov issued 
the well-known decree on holding a poll. The following detail 
is very interesting. Few people paid attention to the fact that 
the main demand included in his political program -- the 
annulment of the moratorium on a referendum regarding the fate 
of the Crimean Republic -- was replaced with merely a poll in 
the form resembling a referendum. Also interesting is that when 
the issue of annulling the moratorium was put on the Crimean 
Supreme Council agenda, it got stuck in the procedural maze and 
was not even discussed, at the quiet consent of Yuriy Meshkov. 
  For his part, the Ukrainian president reacted quite 
operatively to the Crimean president's decree, annulling two out 
of three questions that were to be included on the poll, and 
which would require rather a consultative referendum, which the 
Crimean president does not have the right to approve. However, 
there were no objections to the poll (in a limited version), 
meaning that the Crimeans can absolutely legitimately put in 
force Yuriy Meshkov's decrees which have not yet been regulated 
by the legislation of the Crimean Republic. This is what Yevhen 
Saburov's team needs most, in terms of organization, to quickly 
implement reforms. 
  The U.S. Department of State has emphasized in this regard 
that Ukraine has demonstrated restraint since the new Crimean 
president was elected in January, and that the new Crimean 
leadership also wants to ease the confrontation, and that it has 
hinted that it does not demand that Crimea's status be changed. 
In the background remains the question of why were similar 
activities by the Donetsk and Luhansk Oblast Councils, which 
scheduled their own polls, not met by an adequate reaction on 
the part of the Ukrainian leadership. This once again shows 
that the Crimean problem is becoming a part of a broader 
problem, such as mutual relations between the center and the 
regions, or the administrative-territorial system of our country. 
  It is quite possible that if local elections are held in 
June 
1994 and heads of oblast councils are elected by the people, 
Ukraine will obtain 25 "regional presidents" who will wage a 
fierce battle to expand their own powers. Taking this into 
account, it is currently expedient to concentrate on resolving 
the most fundamental issues concerning the state system, as well 
as on preserving the initiative with the central authorities. 
  The situation in the Crimea requires weighed actions on the 
part of both Simferopol and Kiev. It is important to understand 
that Russia is currently not able to incorporate the Crimea, 
either in terms of politics or economics. Unquestionably, 
political pressure from Russia is possible. One must take into 
account, however, the fact that this would be hampered by the 
tripartite declaration of Ukraine, the United States, and Russia 
on nuclear weapons and security guarantees for Ukraine, the 
Helsinki Act, the negative attitude of many neighboring 
countries toward Crimea's secession, and finally Russia's 
unstable domestic situation. 
  The point is not to aggravate relations between Kiev and 
Simferopol, just on the contrary, it is to arrange them in a 
civilized manner. It is therefore expedient to hold 
negotiations with the new Crimean Government, as represented by 
Yevhen Saburov, to improve mutual relations between Ukraine and 
the Crimea. Working out concepts and programs for an open 
economy regime may become a foundation for this. 
  The options provided by legislation "On Division of Powers 
Between the State Authorities of Ukraine and the Crimean 
Republic" should be used more efficiently. This requires a new 
normative-legal mechanism for regulating the status of the 
Crimea, which would eliminate contradictions and consequences of 
actions of any state authorities. Such a mechanism could be 
defined by a normative document between the state authorities of 
Ukraine and the Crimean Republic on dividing subjects of 
authority and delegating powers while resolving social, 
economic, and property issues. Naturally, foreign policy of the 
Crimea must not contradict Ukraine's Constitution or 
international commitments. In particular, this actually means 
that the Crimean Republic cannot be considered a subject to 
international law. It is unquestionable that Ukraine must act 
as a guarantor of the rights of all nations and ethnic groups 
living in the Crimea, and it must not allow itself to assume a 
dominating position toward any of them, developing direct ties 
with all civil organizations of deported nations, including the 
Majlis of the Crimean Tatar population. 
  Delaying the resolution of the Black Sea Fleet and 
Sevastopol 
problem is becoming more and more dangerous. The Massandra 
agreements (despite the ambiguous stance of all parities' toward 
them) opened a possibility to resolve the problem by means of 
negotiations, and they provide a chance to resolve a whole range 
of military, property, and financial issues. Kiev's loss of 
initiative is leading to an interference of other entities in 
this process, and this particularly relates to the Sevastopol 
City Council and officers of the Black Sea Fleet, which 
apparently only destabilizes the situation surrounding the fleet 
and the city. 
  Ukrainian state authorities must primarily take into account 
the fact that, from an economic point of view, Sevastopol cannot 
exist as only a part of the Crimean Republic. The city's future 
is connected with preserving its status of a city subordinated 
to the center, which allows to resolve economic, financial, and 
social problems much more efficiently. It would therefore be 
expedient to adopt legislation on the status of Sevastopol city 
(there are currently two draft laws worked out respectively by a 
group of Kiev specialists and the city administration). 
  The nomination of the Ukrainian president's representative 
to 
the Crimean Republic was an important step. Currently on the 
agenda, in my opinion, should be the drafting of an agreement 
between the Sevastopol City Council and Administration on the 
one hand, and the Crimean Supreme Council and Government on the 
other, which is provided by Article 7 (Paragraph 3, Part 2) of 
the Crimean Constitution. This would allow to conclude the 
establishment of the judicial triangle: Kiev -- Simferopol -- 
Sevastopol, and its strength would guarantee, to a considerable 
degree, an optimal resolution of any possible problems. 
  Ukraine and the Crimea have yet to encounter serious 
challenges in the economic, political, and social spheres. The 
latest developments on the peninsula have shown that there is no 
other way to untangle taut knots than through dialogue and 
negotiations. Only common sense, political responsibility for 
the lives of millions of people, understanding of current 
realities, and good will in suppressing personal passions and 
needless ambitions are a trustworthy beacon for all who are 
involved in problems of the Crimea and sovereign Ukraine as a 
whole.

  [Text] The Ukrainian Navy's Military Council resolutely 
condemns provocations threatening stability in Crimea says a 
statement released by the Ukrainian Navy's press service on 
Wednesday [11 May]. 
  The document notes that "regrettably, some forces used the 
celebrations of the 49th anniversary of the victory in the Great 
Patriotic War and the 50th anniversary of the liberation of 
Sevastopol for provocations and extremist statements against 
Ukraine and its Navy." 
  "Some admirals and officers of the Black Sea Fleet ever more 
loudly voice their readiness to violate the integrity of the 
current borders, and the position of the Black Sea Fleet 
Commander Admiral Eduard Baltin, who recently said unequivocally 
that `the fleet is a power and should not be touched,' makes 
them confident of their full impunity," the statement points 
out. 
  The Military Council of the Ukrainian Navy regrets that 
"such 
a position prevails today in the power structures of Sevastopol 
and Crimea."

  [Text] Yesterday, the Center [Tsentr] deputy group held 
its regular meeting at which an appeal to Supreme Council deputy 
factions was adopted. The appeal, in particular, states the 
following: 
  We, the Ukrainian people's deputies united in the Center 
group, propose to other deputy groups and party factions to 
create a parliamentary bloc of centrist orientation. We believe 
that a union of forces taking realistic constructive stands is 
quite possible since the majority of deputies, including those 
from political parties, participated in the elections with close 
or similar programs. People hope that the new Supreme Council 
body will be able to consolidate itself around creative and 
constructive tasks, as well as take hold of the situation in 
advance and turn it around for the better. We have no right to 
disappoint them. We see the primary task of the bloc as the 
prevention of a crisis of power. We have to form working and 
permanent Supreme Council bodies and a government in an 
efficient and civilized way; without losing time and effort, to 
begin legislative work; to subject our influence to the 
processes of state development; and to establish reliable 
parliamentary control over all sectors under the powers which 
were granted to the Supreme Council by Ukraine's Constitution. 
  The first great accomplishment of the new Supreme Council 
could be the quick completion and adoption of a new Ukrainian 
constitution -- a clear determination of what kind of state we 
are building and where we are headed. 
  Second: It is very [word indistinct] to find ways out of the 
economic crisis and to immediately begin the implementation of 
balanced market reforms which can be understood and supported by 
society. Our urgent need is to accomplish economic 
restructuring, fundamentally revise and liberalize tax policies, 
and reform monetary and credit policies, as well as the banking 
system. It is necessary to take resolute steps toward the quick 
overcoming of the payment crisis and the prevention of a 
threatened halt in production. In particular, the active 
support of basic industries is necessary. 
  Third: [Word indistinct] correctives have to be introduced 
in the state's social policy. People cannot suffer any longer 
from the striking inconsistency between prices, on the one hand, 
and the level of wages, pensions, stipends, and other payments 
on the other. It is necessary that every able-bodied man be able 
to secure a decent standard of living for himself and his family 
by way of his own work, while the state should take care of 
pensioners, invalids, large families, and the other most 
vulnerable sectors of society. 
  Finally, fourth: It is a task of extreme importance to 
strengthen the peace and accord between different segments of 
society, regions, and people of different nationalities and 
beliefs. It is the patriotic task of all political forces to 
preserve Ukraine's territorial integrity and the inviolability 
of its borders. A particular urgency has been acquired by the 
problems connected with the course of events in Crimea and the 
situation surrounding the Black Sea Fleet. They are to be 
resolved on the basis of Ukraine's Constitution and current laws. 
  The above considerations can become the basis for unifying 
deputy groups of centrist orientation in a parliamentary bloc. 
Understandably, they can be specified in the process of agreeing 
on positions. They can be the basis for working out a concrete 
course of action.

<F P=106> [Article by Nikolay Zakrevskyy: "Hard Currency Discord </F>
Within the Noble Family: Kravchuk Thinks, Zvyahilskyy Decides, 
Yushchenko Protests"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Acting Prime Minister Yukhym Leonidovich Zvyahilskyy: </H5>
"Introduction of a Fixed Karbovanets Rate is Not an 
Administrative But an Economic Step...." 
  The head of the government, who sent a letter defending his 
position on "currency" issues to the Ukrainian president, is 
confident of this. KIYEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI has the complete text 
of this letter and cites its main provisions: "The exchange 
rate of the Ukrainian karbovanets, which was artificially 
reduced by the Ukrainian Interbank Stock Exchange, did not 
correspond to the purchasing power of these currencies [as 
published], because the stock exchange did not conduct actual 
purchases or sales, while the agreements, which were concluded 
there, accounted only a percentage of the currency turnover in 
our state." This is how Yukhym Leonidovich explained the reason 
for shutting down the stock exchange. 
  However, the decision to perform obligatory sales of 
obtained 
hard currency -- according to the fixed rate -- is aimed at 
"deducting part of the subsidies that enterprises receive for 
exporting products from the state budget, which will not in any 
way encroach upon the interests of export enterprises." What 
kind of subsidies does he mean? Yukhym Leonidovich clarifies: 
"In 1992-93, the National Bank issued huge loans to the 
Ukrainian Government to subsidize industry, transportation, and 
agriculture. A considerable portion of these subsidies was used 
to produce products for export. So, when exporters sold products 
for convertible currency, they received additional profits 
because of state subsidies, the falling karbovanets exchange 
rate, and exemptions from VAT and stock holdings." 
  To whisk through the Cabinet of Ministers the decision on a 
karbovanets exchange rate, Yu. L. Zvyahilskyy clarified his 
commitment to the issue -- how to put it, in advance -- to the 
Ukrainian president. What is its essence? 
  "Due to the fixed karbovanets exchange rate, the 
agricultural 
sector will be provided with fuel and lubricants, spare parts, 
and pesticides to carry out the spring sowing campaign. We 
managed to stabilize prices -- including those on food, fuel, 
and lubricants -- on the domestic market. The monthly inflation 
rate fell from some 50 percent in 1993 to 19 percent in January 
1994. The demand for karbovanetses on the Moscow Currency Stock 
Exchange remains high. The fixed karbovanets exchange rate 
promises stable conditions for buying critical imported goods, 
primarily, energy resources and timber used in mining for the 
coal industry. A stable currency rate creates opportunities to 
decrease production costs and increase production for the 
domestic market. The latest factor encourages the purchasing 
power of the national currency and stabilizes the state's 
financial system. In addition, a fixed currency rate stabilizes 
prices on products of export enterprises, which makes it 
possible to conclude long-term treaties on the delivery of 
Ukrainian goods to the global market... It also makes it 
possible to attract foreign investment to the Ukrainian 
economy...." 
<H5>  Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk: "We Should Take Into </H5>
Consideration the Opinion of the New Supreme Council and the 
Government on the Fixed Karbovanets Exchange Rate...." 
  This is how Leonid Makarovich answered my "currency" 
question 
when he was in our editorial offices. 
  The current system of a fixed currency rate prompted the 
situation when 1993 currency profits in Ukraine -- according to 
estimates made by Ukrainian and foreign experts -- constituted 
20-40 percent of the expected total, that is, some 60-80 percent 
of the earned currency remained abroad. What is your and your 
advisers' opinion on a fixed currency exchange rate? Do you 
know how to bring back the money -- earned by Ukrainian 
exporters -- which is currently not doing anything to help 
Ukraine? 
  This issue is of a broad nature, stressed Leonid Makarovich. 
Until now, there has been no single opinion on this issue. Even 
the National Bank does not have one. When representatives of 
the National Bank of Ukraine, other interested organizations, 
members of the Cabinet of Ministers, and myself held a meeting, 
our viewpoints differed once again. The current economic 
situation -- the decreasing inflation rate, cheapening of some 
products -- also speaks in favor of a fixed exchange rate. 
Therefore, we cannot simply reject this idea outright. All 
agree that when we have no national currency (we really lack it 
because the karbovanets is a deficient currency) we cannot move 
to a currency market. There exists the opinion that to 
introduce a national currency, we should cover it in our 
financial and credit relations. 
  The president's advisers support the following position: We 
require more freedom. In my opinion, before we adopt a money 
market, a fixed, or a floating exchange rate, we should analyze 
all of the pros and cons. One of the arguments against this is 
that we should change the scale of prices and salaries and 
financial indexes in the national economy. By the way, we 
should introduce extraordinary increases -- by two or three 
times. That is, the scale of cash and pricing mechanisms should 
be changed. The budget should also be changed. However, it has 
already been adopted. It would be necessary to consider the 
opinion of the new Supreme Council and the government, which 
will be nominated by it. In my opinion, this is a problem of 
our tomorrow. 
<H5>  Ukrainian National Bank Chairman Viktor Yushchenko: "Given </H5>
Hyperinflation, the Policy of the Fixed Currency Rate Will Make 
Ukraine a Multibillion Debtor!" 
  This answer, please note -- which is diametrically opposed 
to 
the opinion of the head of the government -- was contained in a 
letter from the chief banker. He addressed this letter to 
Andrey Pecherov, former chairman of the legislative commission 
for planning, budget, and prices. A stormy discussion of 
Yushchenko's letter, according to UNIAN, did not resolve this 
issue. The president's commission will probably hold a 
roll-call vote on a fixed exchange rate in the legislature. It 
would not be difficult to guess the results because there will 
not be many brave men "to turn the steering wheel by 20 points" 
from Zvyahilskyy's course. However, Viktor Yushchenko's 
position will not be the last in legislative debates. 
  "The use of the fixed currency exchange rate" when 
hyperinflation is in full swing, according to the Ukrainian 
National Bank chairman, "will lead to a further shift from the 
true market rate. The longer the fixing period, the higher the 
difference in currency rates." 
  "According to IMF experts, the volume of currency means, 
which did not return to Ukraine in 1993, stood at $1.3 billion. 
According to trade statistics from the United States, Germany, 
and Italy, the volume of Ukrainian exports and imports to these 
states is four times more than those registered in the customs 
statistics of Ukraine. 
  "Let us take into consideration the fact that the trade in 
currency to a specific group of importers at the lower rate 
simply provides them with additional income. The result of this 
policy is as follows: Given the situation of hyperinflation, 
the policy of fixing a currency rate, the limiting of exports 
and increases in imports will make Ukraine a multibillion 
debtor, because it liquidates the only source of currency 
generation -- the production of goods for export..."

  [Text] Kiev, [no dateline as received] -- The government 
and National Bank of Ukraine are, in the very near future, 
expected to issue a joint resolution making provision for a ban 
on the circulation of foreign currencies as a means of payment. 
"Notification about this will be given 60 days in advance," 
Viktor Yushchenko, the chairman of the board of the National 
Bank of Ukraine [NBU], has told a UNIAN correspondent. The ban 
is to take effect in the summer of this year. Viktor Yushchenko 
made the following comment: "Fighting dollarization has always 
been an element of national currency stabilization at a certain 
point in the financial stabilization of the state. It is the 
national currency having the exclusive right to circulation on 
the market of the state, rather than the conclusion of contracts 
in foreign currency being prohibited, that is at issue. The ban 
will concern goods trade for foreign currency and will extend to 
every single foreign currency." 
  The NBU chairman of the board recalled that at the third 
attempt dollar circulation had been banned in Russia from 1 
January of this year. In the Baltic countries, that had been 
done a year and a half ago. In Viktor Yushchenko's words, "the 
directive cannot achieve full prohibition, and even after a 
legal ban the dollar is still in circulation in Russia." The 
NBU chairman of the board did not rule out that the same 
situation could occur in Ukraine. In his words, "it is hard to 
imagine the French franc being in circulation in the Canadian 
province of Quebec only because the majority of the province's 
population is francophone." The NBU chairman of the board is 
convinced Kiev is to retain its monopoly in currency policy 
regulation. "The circulation of the Russian ruble in separate 
regions and in Crimea in particular, is out of the question."

  [Text] The Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers increased customs 
import duties on most import commodities, primarily food, with a 
resolution on 3 May. 
  The duty on boiled sausage goes up from 20 to 100 pct, 
chocolate from 10 to 100 pct, beer and wines from 20 to 200 pct, 
vodka and spirits 50 to 350 pct, dairy butter from 10 to 80 pct, 
sunflower seed oil from 20 to 60 pct, meat from 10 to 50 pct, 
tobaccos from 50 to 200 and jewelry items from 10 to 150 pct of 
customs value. 
  Duty on the majority of other goods did not change as 
dramatically, with video and tape recorders up from 20 to 40 pct 
and furs and leather clothing from 10 to 150 pct. 
  Ukrainian Presidential Advisor Valeriy Kravchenko considers 
that the adjustments to customs import duties will provide "more 
civilized methods" of protecting the interests of Ukrainian 
manufacturers. The Agriculture Ministry, for example, had made 
repeated requests for protection of the market against a flood 
of cheap food products. 
  However, Foreign Economic Relations Ministry experts believe 
that the introduction of new duties "will not have much bearing 
on the volume of imported goods on the Ukrainian market." 
Valentin Kalinin, speaking on behalf of the Ukrainian Tariff 
Control Department, said that the new duties would be payable in 
the national currency at an exchange rate fixed by the National 
Bank of Ukraine (which has stayed at 12,610 karbovantsy to the 
dollar for the last year and a half, despite rocketing 
inflation) while the goods themselves would be sold on the 
internal market at prices recalculated according to the market 
exchange rate (45,500-46,500 krb. to the dollar on 11 May). 
This will lead to a reduction in the net duty compared with the 
price of the import commodity. 
  Ukrainian Vice Premier Valentin Landik told INTERFAX-Ukraine 
that import duties would now be reviewed on a weekly basis to 
allow the authorities to keep up with market changes.

  [Text] Moscow May 12 TASS -- "Constructive relations are 
shaping up between the Russian Government and the State Duma. 
This is very important for the Cabinet of Ministers," Russian 
Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin said during the opening of today's 
meeting of the Russian Government's Presidium, assessing the 
Duma's approval of the 1944 federal budget in first reading. 
  "We met with the Duma's understanding and I believe this was 
due to our common realisation that the fate of the country was 
being decided," Chernomyrdin stressed. "We shall base the joint 
budgetary work of ministers and lawmakers on methods of 
conviction," he added. According to Chernomyrdin, the Duma's 
preliminary approval of the budget laid the beginning for 
"concrete, painstaking work, in which the government will 
persistently uphold its viewpoint after taking into account 
everything that it had missed or overlooked". 
  The head of the Russian Government said that the budget 
financing of the defence complex was a most important problem. 
"Be what it may, we shall back the military-industrial complex 
and this refers to all its ministries and departments, including 
the Russian military science. As to the defence order, it is 
necessary to balance it out, after seeing what we have on hand 
this year and without exaggerating or hushing up problems," 
Chernomyrdin noted.

  [Text] "My name will emerge in the lists of candidates for 
the presidency in the upcoming elections because a refusal to 
contest them would be immoral," Konstantin Borovoy, leader of 
the Economic Freedom Party [EFP], who arrived in St. Petersburg 
yesterday, said in a meeting with journalists. The centerpiece 
of the visit will be talks about the implementation of the EFP's 
project to lift out of the crisis the country's air space 
industry, whose main centers are located, in particular, in St. 
Petersburg and in northwestern Russia. Regarding the situation 
in the country, Konstantin Borovoy described the just signed 
agreement on public accord as "the most cynical action 
conceivable." The EFP leader, who thinks that currently the 
Russian Government is pursuing an anti-market policy, said in 
that respect that he would "not join the Chernomyrdin 
government" under any circumstances.

Aleksandr Rutskoy was excluded from the list of people invited 
to the international week of cooperation of future leaders that 
opened in Moscow today, following his call for changes in the 
existing system in Russia made at a V-Day rally on May 9. 
  In an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS on Wednesday, 
Aleksey Koshmarov, chairman of the Russian movement "Future 
Leaders of the New Millennium," said that about 200 young 
parliamentarians and members of various parties from Russia, the 
United States, France, Germany and other countries will try to 
shape up a new image of the political leader for the 21st 
century. 
  "A new type of politics must be distinctive in its 
unpredictability, ability to conduct a dialogue and seek a 
compromise, rather than conflicts," Koshmarov said. 
  He stressed that the members of the movement have been 
trying 
to avoid extremism, both right and left, since it was set up two 
years ago.

  [Text] Nikolay Travkin, leader of the Democratic Party 
parliamentary group, told Interfax that he had been appointed 
government minister to allow him to retain his seat in the State 
Duma when he returns to his duties as administration head of the 
Shakhovskoy District, Moscow Region. 
  In compliance with the Constitution he had to abandon that 
position when he was elected to parliament. But he was 
reappointed to that position and simultaneously made a 
government minister on May 1. This enabled him to retain his 
seat in parliament. 
  Travkin made it clear that he had not been given any 
instructions on what he is to be doing in the government. He 
added he had not had any talks with Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin or any other minister on his new appointment. 
  Travkin thought that the government had to include somebody 
representing local interests. He attributed all failures of the 
reform to the inability of the government to hear what local 
officials had to say about its grandiose plans. Travkin thought 
that with his new appointment the government had an opportunity 
and had to use it. 
  He dismissed press reports on a split in his parliamentary 
group in the aftermath of his new appointment. He also thought 
that his signing of the Civic Accord Pact had nothing to do with 
the appointment.

<F P=106> [Veronika Kutsyllo report in the "Cadre Reshuffles in the </F>
Russian Leadership" column: "Petr Filippov Has Become the First 
Victim of National Accord"] 
  [Text] Rumors about the resignation of Petr Filippov, 
chief of the presidential administration's Information Support 
Directorate, which have been surfacing and subsiding 
periodically in the past month, began to justify themselves by 
Victory Day: On 7 May Petr Filippov went on a vacation from 
which he will return to a new job. Some observers assess this 
resignation as a calculated strike on Filippov's "patron" Sergey 
Filatov, but signs are that this is rather the case of a person 
being victimized "in the heat of the moment." 
  Petr Filippov, 48, graduated from the Leningrad Aviation 
Technology Institute in 1967. In 1990 he became people's deputy 
of Russia. In the Supreme Soviet he headed a privatization 
subcommittee. He was a leader of the Reforms Coalition 
parliamentary faction and member of the Supreme Economic Council 
under the Supreme Soviet Presidium. In early March 1993, he was 
appointed head of the Analytical Center on Socioeconomic Policy. 
A year later he became chief of the Information Support 
Directorate. 
  Although the edict on Petr Filippov's resignation has not as 
yet been issued officially, it is clear even now that the 
struggle over this political figure between Sergey Filatov on 
one hand and the Duma's agrarian lobby together with regional 
"agriculturists" on the other has ended in favor of the latter. 
Shortly before the holidays Petr Filippov went on a vacation 
from which he will return to a new job. The latter has not so 
far been determined finally. It is only known that Filippov 
will get an appointment in one of the presidential 
administration's directorates, somewhat lower in status than his 
latest one. 
  A cause for the resignation has been the ill-fated draft 
"agricultural edict" prepared by Filippov in early April which 
provoked a storm of indignation from the agrarian lobby in the 
State Duma. As a presidential administration official told 
KOMMERSANT-DAILY, the promulgation of the draft "has caused 
tremendous damage to the president's peace-making policy." 
However, attempts to assess the appearance of Filippov's 
analytical memorandum half a month prior to the signing of the 
Public Accord Pact as a way to trip up Sergey Filatov, who 
patronizes Filippov, are in all likelihood inconsistent. 
  What is involved is a more large-scale action by the 
opposition aimed at either discrediting the president's efforts 
to achieve national accord or at forcing him into serious 
concessions. The Filippov memorandum gave the agrarians reason 
not to sign the accord pact on 28 April in spite of the fact 
that as a result of the noise they had raised, the president had 
to agree to include into the text of the pact a provision about 
the inadmissibility of "administrative measures" in the 
countryside. 
  The double defeat, together with strong pressure by the Duma 
and regional agrarians (and not only them but also some 
"highbrow" officials in the presidential apparatus who believe 
that Filippov is not only insufficiently professional but simply 
not very intelligent) has angered the president and sealed the 
fate of the well-known proponent of privatization. Even Sergey 
Filatov's cautious intervention resulted only in a softening of 
"punishment:" resignation has been replaced by "transfer to 
other duties." 
  At the same time it would be premature to think that 
Filippov's resignation means a change in Boris Yeltsin's 
position with respect to the money-losing kolhozes and 
sovkhozes. Especially if one recalls that the Filippov 
memorandum was prepared based on the experience in Shakhovskoy 
Rayon, whose forefather [praroditel] Nikolay Travkin recently 
received carte blanche to continue transformations from the 
president, who appointed him minister without portfolio. 
  Generally it can be said that Petr Filippov has suffered for 
advocating a common cause but in a rather untimely manner. And 
therefore became the first victim of the Public Accord Pact.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Larisa Kislinskaya] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 11 TASS -- Criminal charges were brought 
against Police Major-General Igor Shilov, first deputy head of 
the main criminal department of the Russian Interior Ministry. 
He is accused of illegal possession of arms, reliable sources 
told TASS on Wednesday. 
  Shilov was traced by the Moscow Department for Organised 
Crime when it arrested a certain Korneyev, a swindler with a big 
criminal record. 
  According to the sources, Shilov and his son maintained 
"corrupted links with Korneyev". 
  Investigators reportedly possess information that Shilov 
received bribes from the swindler, however head of the Moscow 
Department for Organised Crime Colonel Vladimir Rushaylo refused 
to provide any comment. 
  Shilov's son, who is an advanced student of the Police 
Academy, also faces criminal charges for illegal possession of 
weapons. 
  The case is being investigated by the Moscow prosecutor's 
office which said that a total of eight policemen are involved 
in it. Only one of them has been arrested. 
  Despite criminal charges Shilov still keeps his post. His 
and his son's apartments have been searched. The investigation 
is going on. 
  According to the "MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS" newspaper, a 
combat 
rifle with a sight and a big number of submachine-gun cartridges 
were discovered in Shilov's apartment. A big amount of 
ammunition was also found in his son's flat.

<F P=106> [Vadim Belykh article: "Trap for General. Criminal </F>
Proceedings Instituted Against Deputy Chief of Russian MVD Main 
Administration for Criminal Investigations"] 
  [Excerpts] In issue No. 85 of 6 May IZVESTIYA gave an 
account of investigation "maneuvers" concerning Major General 
Igor Shilov, deputy chief of the Russian Federation MVD 
[Ministry of Internal Affairs] Main Administration for Criminal 
Investigations. Today we publish what we have managed to find 
out about this sensitive affair from the Moscow Regional 
Administration for Organized Crime, the capital's prosecutor's 
office, and the Moscow Internal Affairs Main Administration 
Investigation Department. 
  According to reports from representatives of these three 
departments, the scandal started with a completely 
run-of-the-mill operation whereby members of the organized crime 
subdivision "grilled" a certain citizen Korneyev on suspicion of 
illegal activity. [passage omitted] 
  So far the criminal proceedings against Shilov, like the 
other militia officers, have been brought under Article 218 of 
the Russian Criminal Code for illegal possession of weapons. 
The investigation apparently has evidence directly against the 
country's number two detective that he received a television and 
video recorder, a fountain pen with a gold nib, and the promise 
of a car at a cheap price from Korneyev in the form of bribes. 
  But staffers of the Moscow Regional Administration for 
Organized Crime and of the capital's prosecutor's office are 
letting it be known that they possess information about much 
more serious transgressions by the deputy chief of the Criminal 
Investigation Main Administration and other militia staffers who 
have come to their notice. But it can be publicized only after 
the investigation has finished. 
  The editorial office has learned that Shilov, who has spent 
36 years working in the criminal investigation system, 
categorically denies all the accusations being made against him. 
Judging from his statements, the country's number two detective 
sees all the recent events as a carefully prepared provocation 
aimed directly against the entire criminal investigation 
department. The mafia is trying to remove him using the Moscow 
Regional Administration for Organized Crime with the help of 
agent-informer Korneyev. It has been learned that Shilov is 
confident that given an independent investigation all the 
accusations made against him, like those against most militia 
officers who have fallen out of favor with him, will totally 
collapse. 
  One way or another Moscow City Prosecutor's Office (which is 
now handling this sensational case) will have an extremely hard 
time. Irrespective of the reality of the case's criminal basis 
and even of the evidence gathered it has already become 
political, and will undoubtedly play its role in the conflict of 
various interests both within the MVD itself and outside it. 
  A major case of corruption in the militia's ranks could to 
some extent encourage the MVD's future to be decided on the 
pattern of its "big brother" -- the Security Ministry, whereby 
the ultrapowerful department is split up into several structures 
which are independent of each other: the Russian Administration 
for Administering Punishment, Internal Troops, etc. The Main 
Administration for Organized Crime would then become something 
akin to the American FBI. The future of the Main 
Administrations for Criminal Investigation and Economic Crimes 
looks more complex under this scenario. Separately or together 
they could be turned into federal departments or, by handing 
over some of their functions to the Main Administration for 
Organized Crime, they could be retained only at city or oblast 
level. 
  But according to a different opinion the Russian MVD itself 
has nothing terrible to fear, nobody is going to alter it. But 
enemies of the current internal affairs minister will try to 
exploit the furor over the "Shilov case" and other similar cases 
in order to remove Viktor Yerin from his post.... 
  We will very soon find out how events are going to develop 
further.

<F P=106> [Statement by Public Relations Centers of Russian Federal </F>
Counterintelligence Service and Ministry of Internal Affairs: 
"There Is No `War of Monsters'"] 
  [Text] Certain mass media have recently been disseminating 
-- as a rule, with references to unofficial sources -- various 
kinds of information about an alleged exposure of a criminal 
group of high-ranking Russian MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] 
staffers, which, according to the conclusions of these mass 
media, attests to some confrontation between the FCS [Federal 
Counterintelligence Service] (KGB) and the MVD. 
  In this connection the Public Relations Centers of the 
Russian FCS and MVD officially declare that, following a 
transfer of a large amount of currency, the FCS detained an 
internal service major, a former employee of the Moscow Oblast 
Administration Internal Affairs Main Administration Punishment 
Execution Administration (dismissed in April 1994), and a major 
of justice, a senior investigator of the Russian MVD 
Investigative Committee. These persons have now been arrested 
and charged under Article 88 (violation of regulations on 
currency operations), Article 170 (abuse of official position), 
and Article 174, Part 1 (giving a bribe) of the Russian 
Federation Criminal Code. An attorney's office staffer has also 
been arrested on a charge of committing a crime covered by 
Article 174, Part 1 of the Criminal Code. The criminal case 
which has been instituted has been forwarded for investigation 
to the Russian Federation General Prosecutor's Office. All 
three were charged 6 May. No leading employee of the Russian 
MVD is involved in this case. 
  The Russian FCS and MVD deem it necessary to draw attention 
to the fact that operational-investigative measures and 
investigative actions relating to this case are being carried 
out in cooperation with the MVD. This is the usual practice in 
such instances. The position of the Russian FCS and MVD 
leadership with regard to cases of corruption and official and 
other crimes committed by staffers of organs subordinate to them 
is well known and boils down to their resolute eradication. 
Questions of the reliability and purity of personnel and of 
their own security are topical for the whole law-enforcement 
system. For counterintelligence and internal affairs organs 
participation in exposing and stopping corruption -- not only in 
law-enforcement organs but also in other state structures -- 
constitutes the fulfillment of their immediate duties and 
functions of ensuring national security defined by current 
legislation. Coordination of the efforts of law-enforcement 
organs and special services and direct interaction and close 
cooperation between internal affairs and counterintelligence 
organs are a very important condition and an obligatory and 
natural element of successful operational-investigative work, 
particularly in the struggle against the most dangerous crimes. 
MVD and FCS staffers have recently carried out a number of 
successful joint operations which have ended the activities of 
many dangerous criminal groupings which were engaged in the 
illegal dissemination of drugs, weapons, and contraband 
antiques. Positive results have been obtained as a result of 
carrying out the comprehensive "Putina," "Tral," and "Arsenal" 
operations. 
  In this connection the Public Relations Centers of the 
Russian FCS and MVD believe that the dissemination of 
fabrications about a confrontation or "war of monsters" between 
the FCS and the MVD should be regarded as a provocation harmful 
to the common cause of combatting crime and corruption and 
ensuring the security of the individual, society, and the state.

<F P=106> [Article by Viktor Novoseltsev, executive director of the </F>
newspaper PRAVDA ZHIRINOVSKOGO: "What Lies Behind Mr. 
Navrozov's `Superarticle?'"] 
  [Text] In his very long article entitled "Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy, Super-Hitler and Super-Stalin?" in ROSSIYSKIYE 
VESTI nos. 71-73 for 20-22 April this year, Mr. Navrozov invites 
all those who want to to enter into polemics in order to "smash 
them to smithereens." Responding to this call, I spent a long 
time rereading this accumulation of stories in order to get a 
hold on something about which I could argue. The "superarticle" 
was indeed a slow read, you had to concentrate in order to grasp 
the real reasons why the article was written -- reasons 
abundantly flooded with dirty "water." And the reasons were 
quite understandable: Mr. Kozlovskiy, who praises Zhirinovskiy 
both moderately and immoderately, has become popular in the 
United States, where Mr. Navrozov obviously considers himself to 
be the sole expresser of Russian thinking. Which is why he was 
"smashed to smithereens" by the famous author who has "published 
over 200 articles in 14 Russian publications." 
  The ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI editorial office asked V. Zhirinovskiy 
"to put his counterarguments and arguments" in the newspaper but 
if the party's leader were to "counterargue" and "argue" in the 
pages of all newspapers in which the authors of such "studies" 
pour dirt on him, he would need at least 30 hours of strenuous 
work a day. That would be a good gift for our political rivals. 
  Mr. Navrozov undoubtedly considers himself a specialist in 
everything which concerns the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of 
Russia] and its leader, but it is very strange that in his 
accusations he relies on "a publication with the charming name 
`Off With Their Heads' [`k toporu']." That publication has 
never been an LDPR organ and was published by former LDPR member 
S. Zharikov, who left the party because of his extreme 
right-wing convictions. That publication has never had anything 
to do with the LDPR. If Mr. Navrozov had really been seeking 
the truth he would have found it in his own home in the United 
States in the "Viktor Kamkin" bookstore, well known to all 
emigres. The store regularly sells the newspaper PRAVDA 
ZHIRINOVSKOGO, the official organ of the LDPR. If the 
"specialist on our issue" wants to dig through our old 
publications we will be pleased to offer him a full selection of 
our newspaper's issues, which do not contain a line calling for 
war or racial or national hatred. Only the truth. 
  It is strange that Mr. Navrozov has decided to publish his 
article in Russia. If it had been published in the United 
States and had frightened the Americans the aim sought by the 
author would have been achieved 100 percent. Another wave of 
hatred and fear would have been stirred up. But what is the aim 
of the author in publishing in Russia an article which contains 
not a trace of anguish for the hungry and humiliated citizens of 
that country, in which each line contains concern only for 
citizens of Jewish nationality? That article will produce 
nothing but another wave of ordinary anti-Semitism and if that 
was the author's main purpose he can consider it achieved. 
  The LDPR's program and its leader's statements do not 
contain 
a hint of discrimination against citizens for ethnic reasons, on 
the contrary the program declares "the right to preserve 
traditions and customs, to develop one's own ethnic culture and 
freedom of religion." That is what Zhirinovskiy is blamed for. 
It turns out that Hitler too failed to warn the Jews he would 
destroy them. Forgive me, but what then of the presumption of 
innocence? Mr. Navrozov condemns Zhirinovskiy for intentions he 
has not voiced, guided solely by his own convictions formed from 
reading some dubious publications which have nothing in common 
with the LDPR. Proceeding from that principle one can accuse any 
party and any leader of criminal intentions, seeking dubious 
analogies in our history. What the author calls "the threat to 
the West" is called in the language of international relations a 
policy from a position of strength and was used by the United 
States in Grenada, Panama, and Cuba, and today under the UN flag 
the United States is pursuing this same policy the author finds 
unacceptable in Somalia and Yugoslavia. Zhirinovskiy merely 
expressed an intention, but the United States is already 
pursuing that policy, yet the author is more frightened by 
Zhirinovskiy's intentions than by the U.S. Government's specific 
actions. 
  Zhirinovskiy does not intend to "destroy the West" or to 
fight it. It will be enough for our party if the West 
interferes less in our strictly domestic affairs, especially 
since "specialists" like Mr. Navrozov are turning to us more 
frequently with their advice, thanks to which we are in our 
present situation. 
  All accusations of chauvinism, nazism, and the desire for 
world dominance are unfounded. It is simply foolish to accuse 
Zhirinovskiy of seeking world dominance. In each of his 
speeches and publications the LDPR leader accuses the United 
States of this desire and expresses himself in favor of regional 
cooperation between countries in order to rule out global 
military conflicts and criticizes the former USSR leadership for 
attempting to extend its influence to the whole world, which was 
one reason for the state's collapse. 
  The author's opinions on the "superfluidity" of 
Zhirinovskiy's thinking are surprising. It is very rash of him 
to accuse the LDPR leader of being disloyal to his ideas or 
statements. In Russia today Zhirinovskiy is one of the few 
party leaders, if not the only party leader, not to have changed 
his position by a single degree in four years. His tactics of 
struggle change, conditions change, the state is collapsing, 
former comrades in arms are shooting each other, political 
leaders are changing color more often than trees in the course 
of a year, but the LDPR is prepared to put its name to every 
document which has emerged from the party's nether regions in 
this time. What place is there here for the lack of principle 
of which the author tries to accuse Zhirinovskiy? 
  The "appeal to the officers and employees of the special 
services and special subunits of the counterintelligence organs 
and Internal Affairs Ministry." Mr. Navrozov explains it as a 
call to compile lists of people to be destroyed, although the 
document made no mention of any "destruction" but merely 
contained an appeal to uncover the criminals who are robbing our 
people and to do their immediate job of eradicating crime, and 
retribution in accordance with the law will come for today's 
mafiosi only after the LDPR has come to power, because of the 
present leadership's inability to fight this evil. Any patriot 
will support this appeal and it can only frighten Mr. Navrozov's 
friends, the "new emigres" who are flocking into defenseless 
Russia in order, under the guise of "U.S. businessmen," to catch 
a free fish in Russia's murky waters. The freeloading will soon 
end for them and they will have to answer to the U.S. tax 
administration. 
  The notorious article devoted a lot of room to the problem 
of 
selling arms abroad. Nothing about hunger in Russia, nothing 
about the Russian children who are not being born today, nothing 
about our destroyed economy, but a lot of space devoted to the 
problem of arms sales. It is true that our weapons are better 
than the Americans'. For the time being. And we will sell 
them, and if we do not then the Americans will and it will be 
the worse for us, but Navrozov will feel better. And there is 
no point in arguing about whether there will be money from arms 
sales. If we do not sell arms there will be no money and the 
military industry will wither away. Not bad thing for those who 
are paying Mr. Navrozov money for his articles. 
  And the transatlantic journalist completely disconcerted me 
with his conclusion: The Russian press, he says, writes good 
things about Zhirinovskiy and does not write bad things because 
it is mortally afraid of that gentleman. That's the limit. If 
Zhirinovskiy were to set himself the task of simply reading all 
the dirty articles about him published in the Russian press he 
would have not time even to wash, let alone to work. Yes, some 
people do write the truth, but they are few even in the 
provinces where a conscience has not yet become a source of 
laughter. Moscow journalists cannot allow themselves that 
luxury. As for our "red-brown" press, as the authors puts it, 
we are indeed make efforts not through fear but for the sake of 
our conscience, the only thing is that under the present regime 
this is difficult in the face of the "yellow" press. 
  Mr. Navrozov from the height of his moral position 
complained 
that the word "dictatorship" which sounds like the word 
"slavery" to Americans is an ordinary word to Russian ears, but 
he has forgotten to add that U.S. democracy found its feet by 
relying for a whole century on the forced labor of slaves. The 
fine articles of their constitution did not prevent the 
democratic Americans from using people with a different color 
skin as work animals. The American path of development is 
unacceptable to Russia, we do not intend to rob other peoples by 
exporting cheap raw material from underdeveloped countries in 
exchange for chewing gum, and the Americans would not allow us 
to do so, realizing that two such parasitical states will not 
survive on one earth. The best option for the United States is 
a weak Russia mining its own mineral resources for U.S. needs 
and for that to happen the United States needs to "keep" its own 
man in the Kremlin, but if Zhirinovskiy gets there.... 
  Mr. Navrozov's article is correct. For the Americans. It 
was for them that he wrote it. 
  In approaching one more subject which, in my opinion, seems 
the main one in the article I am criticizing, you cannot help 
feeling awkward. In Russia you can openly call the Russians 
cattle and Russia a land of fools (or the motherland of goats, 
as MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS did) if you are a citizen of another 
nationality but god forbid that a Russian say anything 
prejudiced about a person of another nationality. You will 
immediately be known as a fascist. And dragged through the 
courts. So Russians are tying themselves into knots in their 
own country, thinking up terms like "persons of a criminal (or 
commercial) nationality." 
  Our party is in favor of full equality for people 
irrespective of sexual, racial, ethnic, or religious 
differences, but for that we must first of all give Russians 
equal rights wit regard to other ethnic groups. We must abandon 
the double standards for treating ethnic groups, we must allow 
Russians to rid themselves of their occupiers' complex. After 
all, we were not the ones who killed Indian children to acquire 
their ancestors'land, we were not the ones who used Africans as 
working animals. We worked on the outskirts of the empire in 
the same way and perhaps even better than others and we deserve 
equal rights with other peoples living on the same land as us. 
  The aim of Navrozov's article is not only to discredit 
Zhirinovskiy. The topic of Zhirinovskiy is only the tip of the 
iceberg. The author persistently puffs up the Jewish topic, 
dividing the world into Jews and non-Jews. Presenting the 
fascist challenge banner to the Russian people, he is convinced 
this banner will never fly over a zionist movement thanks to the 
enormous harm done to the Jewish nation by German 
national-socialism. Yet far more Russians were killed in that 
war! A double standard again? We should all know the 
description of national-socialism adopted in Germany today: 
"National-socialism is the determination of a person's 
nationality on the basis of his blood." In that connection what 
do the Jews' attempts to "accuse" Zhirinovskiy of being a Jew 
look like? And in general what is the purpose of this whole 
campaign? To prove that such a talented man could only appear 
in a Jewish environment or, by using ordinary anti-Semitism, to 
turn Russian voters away from a leader they do not like? Both 
purposes are undoubtedly vile and in addition are a very clear 
example of double-dyed national-socialism of the German type. 
  The charge leveled against Mr. Kozlovskiy that "in a good 20 
years in the West he never once spoke of his national origin" is 
also loathsome. From that it follows that a Jew who does not 
advertize his nationality is violating some special Jewish laws 
while a Russian who asserts that he is Russian is transgressing 
some other Jewish laws. The double standard once again, and it 
stinks. 
  Somehow it is unseemly even to mention the literary worth of 
this article. Reading Navrozov is harder than listening to 
Gorbachev. I feel very sorry for our emigres who encounter this 
kind of thing in "Russian" newspapers. I want to advise Mr. 
Navrozov not to take the trouble to paraphrase Russian sayings. 
The saying "the elder tree is in the yard and uncle is in Kiev" 
of itself signifies the meaningless nature of what has been said 
and does not require the interference of "specialists," and nor 
indeed does anything concerning our domestic life.

which presently numbers 148.4 million, is steadily decreasing. 
Over the past year, it fell by 300,000 people. 
  According to the State Statistics Committee, this trend is 
revealed in the country's 49 regions accounting for over 60 per 
cent of Russia's entire population. The decline was especially 
marked last year in the Chukchiy autonomous district, the 
Magadan and Kamchat regions, where is ranged from four to nine 
per cent. Demographers see the main reason for it in a sharp 
decrease in the birth rate, with the death rate continuously 
growing. Thus, the birth rate shrank by 220,000 people, while 
the death rate increased by 330,000. The situation is even more 
alarming in northwestern Russia and in most of the central 
regions, where the death rate exceeded the birth one by 2 to 2.4 
times. At the moment, the former indicator is less than the 
latter one only in North Caucasian republics, the Chukchiy 
autonomous district and in the Tyumen region. 
  Experts note that the natural decrease in population is to a 
certain degree compensated for by ever increasing migration. 
Inter- state migration nearly doubled over the past year and 
reached a post-war high of 430,000 people. It is noteworthy 
that almost two thirds of the country's territories accepted 
migrants. The inflow of migrants to such areas as the central 
black-earth region, the Krasnodar territory, the Rostov and 
Oryol regions exceeded by three times the average level across 
Russia. At the same time, the population outflow from the 
Chukchiy and Kamchat peninsulas, the Sakhalin island, the 
Chechen and Ingush Republics remained quite intensive.

  [Text] At 1400 today, the Ministry of Communications 
reports, the transmitter relaying Russia's radio on 261 kH on 
the longwave will be switched off. This has been caused by an 
unpaid electricity bill. It is not for the first time that the 
problem of payments has emerged. It is not the company's debt 
which is at issue; the funds have not been provided from the 
state budget. The Government is intending to consider, in the 
nearest future, the problem of state radio and television -- 
specifically volumes of broadcasting and necessary funding. 
  We do regret, on our part, that our listeners will be unable 
to listen to Russia's Radio on its usual frequency, due to the 
fact that these problems are as yet unresolved.

  [Text] Since the beginning of the year, 48,403 crimes have 
been uncovered in the Russian economic sphere, which is 16 
percent more than in the same period last year, the chief 
directorate on economic crime of the Russian Federation Interior 
Ministry has reported. 
  Experts point out the rising trend in violations of rules on 
currency operations. These have increased by almost 150 
percent, and number 3,800 cases. Most crimes of this kind 
concern illegal operations with hard currency and precious 
metals and stones. 
  As usual, the biggest increase among economic crimes is in 
crimes linked with the manufacture and sale of counterfeit money 
and securities.

  [Text] During 1992 Russia received 10.5 billion dollars in 
the form of foreign credits allotted by different countries, 
banks and companies. Among Russia's biggest creditors are 
Germany (4.5 billion dollars), the US (1.8 billion dollars), 
Italy (1.05 billion dollars) and France (554 million dollars). 
  This information was given in a paper circulated among the 
State Duma deputies on Wednesday. Today the State Duma will 
consider the draft law on state foreign borrowings on the part 
of Russia and on state credits given to Russia by foreign 
countries and on the upper limit of foreign borrowings and 
credits which may be granted to Russia by a foreign country in 
1994. 
  The paper underlined that the total sum of the received 
credits had been reduced to 4.46 billion dollars during 1993. 
Germany remained the biggest creditor (2.4 billion dollars). 
France had second place with 680 million dollars. The US was 
the third biggest creditor - 671 million dollars. Italy was the 
fourth - with 228 million dollars. 
  During this year Russia expects to receive 2.8 billion in 
foreign credits, including 850 million dollars from Germany, 525 
million dollars from Italy, 485 million dollars from the US, 350 
million dollars from Japan. Great Britain will allot 190 
million dollars, the EEC 150 million dollars and France 85 
million dollars. 
  In 1993 the foreign credits were distributed among different 
sectors of the Russian economy as follows: the agriculture and 
the food industry received 2.02 billion dollars; industry - 817 
million dollars; the transport and communications 724 million 
dollars; the municipal economy and environment 482 million 
dollars and the medical industry 295 million dollars. A total 
of 120 million dollars were spent on purchasing medicine. 
  In 1994 the foreign credits are expected to be distributed 
as 
following: the agriculture and the food industry will receive 
490 million dollars; industry - 1.97 billion dollars; the 
transport and communications - 450 million dollars; the 
municipal economy and environment - 140 million dollars and the 
medical industry - 280 million dollars. A total of 370 million 
dollars will be spent on purchasing medicine. 
  Another paper cited the terms of credits allotted by the 
former USSR and Russia to India, Cuba, Algeria and Pakistan. 
For instance, India was allotted 830 million dollars in 1992 
for the delivery of Russian "special property" and services. 
The term of the credit in 1994-1995 proceeds from a 5 
pct-annual rate. Repayment of the credit by India provides for 
a ten pct-advanced payment. A total of 90 pct of the sum will 
be repaid over seven years through the delivery of goods from 
India. 
  In accordance with the agreement on economic and technical 
cooperation between Russia and Cuba signed in July 1993, Cuba 
received 350 million dollars under a 4 pct-annual rate. The 
credit is to be paid in 1993-1995. Cuba must pay the credit 
through goods deliveries over 10 years.

  The State Duma adopted a law on Wednesday allowing the 
government to borrow as much in order to keep the balance and 
grant not more than 400 million dollars in credits to other 
countries. 
  Aleksandr Zhukov, one of the authors of the law, said this 
will be enough to finish facilities in foreign countries, the 
construction of which has been suspended.

  [Text] The volume of currency interventions carried out by 
the Central Bank of Russia during the first quarter of 1994 was 
a little more than one billion dollars. This was announced to 
the Financial Information Agency by sources in the Central Bank 
of Russia today. 
  The same source said that initially the sum of currency 
interventions by the bank had exceeded the total volume. 
However, by the end of the quarter the Central Bank of Russia 
bought back a part of the hard currency on the currency market. 
  Currently, the Central Bank of Russia is pursuing a 
moderately tough policy aimed at lessening the fluctuations of 
the dollar, the source pointed out. The same source suggested 
that more energetic or decreased influence on the currency 
market was determined mostly by economic reasons and the 
exchange rate of the dollar. 
  In early 1994 the Central Bank of Russia officially stated 
that during the first three weeks in January it had spent more 
than one billion dollars for currency interventions. According 
to the Central Bank of Russia, the total volume of its currency 
resources sold on six Russian stock exchanges last year was 14.7 
billion dollars (2.8 billion dollars in 1992). For late 1993 
the resources of the Central Bank of Russia amounted to 4.4 
billion dollars. At that moment the currency resources of 
Russian commercial banks were put at 12 billion dollars. 
  Chairperson of the Central Bank of Russia, Viktor 
Gerashchenko, announced during the parliamentary hearings in the 
State Duma that the bank planned to increase its currency 
resources from 4.5 billion dollars to 9.5 billion dollars by the 
end of 1994. He stressed that the bank had begun to carry out 
moderate interventions on currency market instead of the 
intensive ones. Thus, the Central Bank of Russia intends to 
lessen the difference between the inflation rate and the 
exchange rate of the U.S. dollar on the stock exchanges.

<F P=106> [Ivan Zhagel report: "Increased Revenue From Customs Duties </F>
Proposed While Reducing Their Scale"] 
  [Text] The government has made significant adjustments to 
the revenue items in the amplified draft budget which has been 
submitted to the Duma. In particular, it is planned to increase 
the receipts from export and import duties to 8.6 trillion 
rubles [R], whereas they were R6.2 trillion in the previous 
draft. 
  Everyone still remembers the struggle waged over customs 
duties this year. At first the government intended to introduce 
new customs duties in January, then a special decree was adopted 
10 March on this question, which proposed to increase import 
duties no later than 15 March. In the end, under pressure from 
the public and from businessmen, the government admitted that 
the issue had not been dealt with very well, and there followed 
a further postponement of the deadline for introducing the new 
duties -- 1 July. 
  Naturally, the size of duties on a number of groups of 
commodities must also be reexamined or amplified, and, on the 
basis of the logic of the entire previous discussion of this 
question, revised downward. However, as follows from the latest 
draft budget, a reduction in the rates of import duties is 
lead...to an increase in payments into the budget to the tune of 
R2.4 trillion. 
  Incidentally, when sending the government the draft budget 
for further work, the Duma also insisted on increasing revenue 
from import duties. But, as Mikhail Zadornov, chairman of the 
Duma Committee for the Budget, Taxes, Banks, and Finances, said, 
this will be done not by increasing the rates, but as a result 
of abolishing a huge number of duty exemptions on imports which 
were previously handed out indiscriminately. 
  Incidentally, M. Zadornov cited some very interesting 
figures. Thus, in accordance with the memorandum on economic 
policy recently signed by the government and the Central Bank, 
it is planned to restrict the average rate of duties to a level 
of 15 percent. Naturally the Ministry of Finance, as part of the 
government, is also guided by this figure. However, 
realistically speaking, in the latest draft budget, when 
calculating revenue from import customs duties, the Ministry of 
Finance was proceeding on the basis of an average rate of 3.6 
percent. That is, an enormous number of exemptions for imports 
are being cut, as well as the allowance being made for the 
situation whereby people are simply going to avoid making the 
required payments. Therefore a reduction in customs rates plus 
the abolition of various exemptions may have a significant 
positive effect. 
  The abolition of exemptions on imports may degenerate into 
protectionism for our sectoral monopolies, for instance, 
automobile manufacturers and producers of agricultural output. 
Therefore, while repealing the exemptions, it is important on 
the other hand to restrict the maximum rates of import customs 
duties by legislation. And here the fact that the Committee for 
the Budget, Taxes, Banks, and Finances is preparing a change in 
the Law on Customs tariffs which, according to M. Zadornov, will 
establish the upper limit for rates at 20-30 percent, cannot 
fail to be encouraging. And if the government wants to exceed 
this level, then a special decision will be required from the 
legislators.

  [Text] According to the Russian Economy Ministry, passenger 
use of public transport in the first quarter of this year 
decreased to 113.5 billion passengers, or by 8.7 
passenger-kilometers (by 7 percent) in comparison with the same 
period last year. The passenger use has decreased on all types 
of transport, with rail transport by 10 percent, air transport 
by 9.4 percent, and road transport by 2.5 percent. 
  Experts believe that the decline in transport use is caused 
by price rises on rail and air transport that are ahead of 
people's ability to pay. 
  In the first quarter railway freight transport has gone down 
by 22 percent and totalled 36.7 million tonnes. 
  Maritime freight transport has seen a decrease of 4 million 
tonnes, or 19.7 percent, mainly caused by a decrease of 16 
percent of the total number of available vessels. Another 
reason for the decrease in maritime transport is the fact that 
there was no imported grain and there was a drop of 47 percent 
in freight transport to the Far North and areas of equal status. 
  Road transport accounted for 166 million tonnes of freight, 
which is 122 million tonnes, or 40 percent less than during the 
same period last year. 
  The volume of freight transported by air was 95,000 tonnes, 
or 22 percent less than in the first quarter of last year.

<F P=106> ["Russian Federation Finance Ministry Appeal to Russian </F>
Federation Citizens: Beware of Speculators"] 
  [Text] A critical situation has currently formed in the 
securities market, whereby dishonest entrepreneurs are 
exploiting the population's lack of experience in matters of 
acquiring securities and the imperfect nature of legislation and 
are, to their own selfish ends, getting rich for no good reason 
on other people's money and undermining the population's trust 
in honest participants in the securities market. With the aim 
of protecting the interests of investors and ensuring the normal 
functioning of the securities market, the Russian Federation 
Finance Ministry proposes that all interested citizens should 
follow the following recommendations in buying and selling 
securities: 
  1. First of all, gather as much information as possible 
about who is issuing the securities you intend to buy (that is, 
the issuer). 
  If they are being issued by a bank or a credit institution, 
then find out how long it has been functioning, what its 
authorized capital is, and what types of banking operations it 
has a license for. 
  2. Make sure that the securities are state-registered, and 
study carefully the prospectus for the issue of securities 
registered by the financial organs. 
  3. Never trust advertisements. You can only make a decision 
to invest your money in securities on the basis of a 
comprehensive analysis of the securities issue prospectus, the 
accounts and the nature of the activity of the issuer, and the 
general situation in the market where the issuer in question is 
working. 
  4. When concluding security deals, only use the services of 
professional participants in the securities market (investment 
institutions which have the appropriate licenses). 
  5. Make sure that the seller is the owner of the securities 
or an employee of an owner of the securities. If the seller of 
securities is operating on the instructions of the owner of the 
securities (on the basis of a commission contract or a contract 
of agency), then he should be an employee of an investment 
institution and have a first-category certificate of 
qualification (that is, you must demand a photocopy of the 
license granting the right to conduct activity as an investment 
institution and a photocopy of the first-category qualification 
certificate). 
  6. It is recommended that deals concerning the purchase and 
sale of securities are drawn up in the form of a written 
contract in which the following must be determined: the 
procedure for transactions on the deal, the procedure for 
entering a new owner in the shareholders' register, the 
procedure for paying taxes on transactions involving securities, 
and so on. 
  7. Register the deal at an investment institution, bank, or 
with the issuer from whom you are buying the securities. 
  8. As practice shows, the investment of funds in bills of 
exchange and granting loans by concluding loan contracts are the 
most risky at present. You do not need any state registration, 
nor do you need special permission (licenses) in order to issue 
bills of exchange and conclude loan contracts, and that is 
precisely why these financial instruments are most often used by 
dishonest entrepreneurs with the aim of deceiving the 
population. At the same time, as a rule neither the issuer of 
the bill of exchange nor the borrower reveals any information 
about his financial position or type of activity in the loan 
contract. Remember that, when you conclude a loan contract, you 
are entering into a civil-legal relationship with the borrower 
and, in the event of a conflict, you can only defend your 
interests via a court. The specific nature of a bill of 
exchange is such that the absence of even one obligatory element 
makes it invalid. If you are not familiar with the rules of 
composing bills of exchange, the circulation of bills, and civil 
legislation, do not invest money in these financial instruments, 
regardless of the high interest rates you may be promised. 
  If you do decide to buy bills of exchange, then you should 
know that the most reliable are the bills of exchange of major 
banks and banking syndicates. 
  9. Remember that investing money in non-state securities 
practically always involves risk. The fact that the securities 
you are buying have passed through state registration is no 
guarantee that the funds you have invested will be returned, or 
of the reliability and profitability of these securities. The 
basic axiom for investment activity in the securities market 
states that, the higher the profitability of the security, the 
greater the risk of investing in such a security. 
  10. Do not give in to general trends of investing your money 
at an interest rate which exceeds the average market interest 
rate many times over. 
  Remember that the founders of joint stock companies are 
answerable to other shareholders only within the limits of 
personal contributions to the authorized capital. Investments 
in joint stock companies with a small authorized capital and a 
declared issue exceeding the authorized capital thousands and 
millions of times over are extremely risky.

<F P=106> [Concluding part of two-part article by Vasiliy Krivokhizha, </F>
deputy director of the Russian Institute for Strategic Research: 
"Future of the Russian Nuclear Potential"] 
  [Text] When it comes to discussing the necessary number of 
nuclear munitions in the strategic force structure, most Russian 
military specialists (and this is confirmed, incidentally, by 
very numerous research models of the new strategic situation) 
agree that the number of 3,000-3,500 warheads set by the START 
II Treaty is enough for Russia to deter any aggressor with a 
retaliatory strike, even more so with a counterstrike. As for 
the counterforce potential of Russia's strategic nuclear forces, 
at 3,000-3,500 warheads, as previously at 10,000-13,000 warheads 
(initial level) or 5,000-6,000 warheads (START I Treaty), it is 
indeed far less than that of the U.S. strategic nuclear forces. 
  The change in the structure of Russia's strategic nuclear 
"triad" is a most important aspect of the START II Treaty and 
has far-reaching consequences. At a time of strategic offensive 
arms cuts, the question of shaping the optimum structure for the 
nuclear "triad" that Russia will have at its disposal in the 
early 21st century acquires particular significance. 
  Approximately 60 percent of Russia's nuclear might (number 
of 
warheads) is currently concentrated in silo-based 
ground-launched or road- and rail-mobile ICBM's, 30 percent is 
on missile-carrying submarines, and 10 percent is carried by 
strategic aviation. The U.S. nuclear "triad" currently looks as 
follows: 25 percent ground-launched ICBM's (silos only), 55 
percent submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and 20 percent 
free-fall bombs and all types of cruise missiles. In accordance 
with the average figures laid down by the START II Treaty, by 
the year 2003 both sides will have approximately the following 
structure in their strategic nuclear forces -- 15-30 percent 
ground-launched ICBM's, 50-55 percent on submarines, and 15-35 
percent on aircraft. As, for instance, Academician R.A. Golosov 
of the Russian Federation Academy of Natural Sciences and 
certain other specialists claim, the United States will in 
practice retain the existing correlation of strategic nuclear 
forces within the "triad" framework, whereas Russia will be 
forced to sharply alter the structure of its nuclear "triad," 
weakening its main component -- ground-launched strategic 
weapons. In R.A. Golosov's opinion, implementation of the 
treaty will damage the country's interests from both the 
military-strategic and economic viewpoints. From these 
standpoints the START II Treaty can be seen as inequitable and 
as failing to ensure equality in counterforce potential, thereby 
not promoting the maintenance of strategic stability in 
relations between Russia and the United States. 
  It is no secret that implementation of the START II Treaty 
will indeed leave the U.S. side with a number of advantages -- 
specifically in counterforce potential. But this situation also 
existed in the past, and has not been eliminated by any of the 
previous treaties, including START I. A positive aspect of the 
new treaty is that it creates conditions under which the U.S. 
interest in building up its counterforce potential is 
significantly diminished both by reducing the number of U.S. 
warheads capable of hitting defended precision targets, and by 
Russia's reducing the number of targets on its territory which 
would have been most attractive to a counterforce strike -- 
primarily, heavy ICBM's. The Russian side is also reducing its 
counterforce potential, since it too will pledge to eliminate a 
certain number of missiles with the ability to strike defended 
targets and with the possible ability, in the U.S. side's 
opinion, to be used in a first strike. 
  From the standpoint of the prospects for the nuclear 
disarmament process there is a clear possibility in the very 
near future for a further change to the structure of the nuclear 
"triad" which could be initiated -- for various reasons -- by 
both the U.S. and Russian sides. Leading Russian specialists in 
the strategic stability sphere and experienced military 
diplomats are, in particular, not ruling out the emergence of a 
U.S. proposal for a further stage of disarmament, comprising 
further cuts in or the total elimination of ground-launched 
missiles. This proposal has some attractive reasoning behind 
it. We understand, for instance, that first counterstrike 
missiles would be targeted exclusively on naval and air bases 
and other important military installations and would pose less 
of a threat (by excluding the Strategic Rocket Forces) of 
destroying civilians and land ecosystems. But this step is 
unacceptable to Russia because of the qualitative superiority of 
the U.S. naval component over the Russian naval component (as 
already mentioned above). Consequently, Russia needs to retain 
its land-based component -- that is, the Strategic Rocket 
Forces. With a view to equalizing the combat survivability 
[ustoychivost] of Russian and U.S. strategic submarines -- which 
would enhance overall strategic stability -- it would be 
expedient for Russia to propose to conclude an agreement with 
the United States to restrict ASW systems along the lines of the 
ABM Treaty. 
  In connection with a number of articles in recent months it 
would be a good idea to talk separately about the need to 
preserve such a component of the Strategic Rocket Forces' 
ground-based grouping as mobile missile systems. Since Russia 
is allowed to increase the number of these installations under 
the START II Treaty, these are the systems that have been 
particularly "under fire" from the media. 
  The concern felt by the people writing these critical 
articles for the fate of Russia's strategic nuclear arms is 
entirely understandable. Nonetheless, I would like to object to 
many of the points raised in these articles. 
  The usual argument cited in disputes by supporters of the 
complete retention of silo-based ICBM's is the claim that a 
missile in a silo that can be prepared for firing in the space 
of one minute and has protection up to 100 kg per square 
centimeter is a more reliable weapon than a mobile missile that 
takes on average around an hour to prepare for firing and is 
protected up to 1 kg per square centimeter. 
  We should dwell on these figures. The accuracy of modern 
missile systems is such that a silo-based missile with a 
protection level of 100 kg per square centimeter (the silo's 
coordinates will be known) is guaranteed (with a probability of 
close to 100 percent) to be hit by a single megaton-class 
nuclear munition. According to the research done by relevant 
Russian Federation Defense Ministry organizations (arguments in 
the newspapers never usually worry about checking if their 
results were correct or their methodology appropriate), in order 
to hit a single road-mobile missile system an enemy would have 
to use more than 10 such nuclear munitions to cover the entire 
potential deployment region (position area). A mobile system's 
survivability is ensured not only by the size of the position 
area, but also by choosing terrain with the requisite camouflage 
and protective qualities, and by camouflaging the system itself 
-- something that people often forget to take into account. 
Modern mobile systems can travel over roadless terrain and not 
merely, as is often claimed, on metaled roads -- in other words, 
they are not just "road"-mobile. Road-mobile systems are only 
"vulnerable" to a surprise "nuclear strike" by U.S. submarines 
when the mobile systems are at their garrisons, as U.S. 
President George Bush insisted during the negotiations. But 
even in this instance, if there were a rise in tension in the 
world -- and much more so if there were a threat of nuclear 
attack -- road-mobile systems could be moved out of their 
garrisons into their combat position areas. Consequently, the 
survivability of mobile systems is not lower but actually 
considerably higher than that of silo-based systems. 
  In this connection it would seem logical to give up 
silo-based missiles. But if the launch command (for a 
counterstrike on our part) were given in good time, the 
silo-based missiles would escape an enemy strike thanks to their 
high level of combat readiness -- in other words, the missiles 
would leave the silos before the impact of the nuclear explosion 
of enemy warheads came into play. This, needless to say, is if 
it proved possible to carry out a counterstrike. If not, then 
this is yet another argument in favor of mobile systems. 
Moreover, mobile systems allow for different basing modes 
[formiruyut mnogovariantnost], which strengthens deterrence. 
Admittedly, silo-based missiles require less expenditure than 
mobile missiles -- they are more resistant to sabotage and to 
the use of precision nonnuclear weapons. But why do we need to 
view one basing mode as an alternative to another? The optimum 
structure for the Strategic Rocket Forces, ensuring reliable 
deterrence under different strategic situations with different 
amounts of economic and material expenditure, is to combine 
silo-based and road-mobile missile systems, which it is planned 
to preserve within the Strategic Rocket Forces after 2003 -- 
provided, of course, that financial considerations do not alter 
the situation. 
  The view that "it is not difficult to knock out a mobile 
system" and that it would take overpressure of only 4-5 
kilopascals to topple one over is known to be incorrect. 
Overpressure of 4-5 kilopascals (0.04-0.05 kg per square 
centimeter) in a nuclear shock wave propagated through the air 
merely corresponds to a mass airflow velocity of around 40 
km/hour. Such a small level of overpressure poses a threat only 
to glass windows. Overpressure an order of magnitude (more than 
10 times) greater would be needed in the nuclear shock wave 
propagated through the air in order to topple a road-mobile 
transporter-erector-launcher and its missile, and then only if 
the nuclear munition exploded precisely at right-angles to the 
launcher, rather than at an acute target angle [tochno na 
traverze ustanovki, a ne na ostrykh kursovykh uglakh]. This 
pressure in the shock wave corresponds to a gas flow velocity of 
more than 300 km/hour. 
  It is interesting to note that in the late eighties the 
official U.S. position at the START talks boiled down to a 
bilateral ban on the deployment of mobile land-based strategic 
missile systems. This was due to the U.S. side's doubts about 
the ability of national means of verification to detect the 
deployment of these missiles and by the special approach taken 
by Congress -- for a whole host of reasons -- toward approval of 
the program for the development [sozdaniye] of mobile missile 
systems in the United States. But, first and foremost, the U.S. 
position was due to the U.S. reluctance to see an overall 
improvement in the combat survivability of the USSR's strategic 
nuclear forces (this was not a major problem for the United 
States itself because of the existence of a powerful and, to all 
intents and purposes, equally "mobile" sea-based component in 
its strategic nuclear forces). 
  Ultimately, the U.S. position shifted in favor of an 
agreement to the deployment of single-warhead road-mobile 
missile systems, on condition that measures were implemented to 
verify the number of deployed missiles in this class and, by 
agreement, the number of such missiles by type -- which was to 
all intents and purposes carried out under the START II Treaty. 
  Here we can note that criticism and a continual desire to 
argue have become part and parcel of our political life. This 
is natural for our life today, but we need -- at least in some 
measure -- to retain our consistency and objectivity. Otherwise 
we will find ourselves in a situation where a U.S. agreement to 
mobile systems will cause justifiable suspicion about their 
motives from some of our experts, while a failure to agree on 
their part will produce no less justifiable doubts from other 
experts as regards the competence of the Russian delegation to 
the talks. We can also note the contradictory nature of the 
approaches taken by the Americans. When the official U.S. 
position was to ban road-mobile missile systems, a group of U.S. 
experts drew up some very noteworthy recommendations for their 
delegation members: 
  -- since mobility is the most effective means of enhancing 
the survivability of strategic missiles during a nuclear first 
strike, the negotiations with the Russians should not raise the 
question of a total ban on them, leaving open the possibility of 
the United States' developing this component for the land-based 
grouping of its strategic nuclear forces; 
  -- under no circumstances should a situation be created in 
which the combat survivability of road-mobile missile systems is 
even slightly diminished as a result of demands to allow the 
sides access to accurate information on their deployment and on 
the observance of the treaty restrictions on the number of 
land-based mobile missiles. It was thought sufficient to 
stipulate merely the term, acceptable to both sides, of 
"cautious" on-site inspections and the utilization of national 
means of verification, provided that the side undergoing 
inspection retains all the advantages relating to the difficulty 
of determining the precise location of the missiles at any 
specific time. 
  In conclusion, I would like to note that we can already make 
a confident forecast about the existence of different approaches 
to the way in which the treaty will be seen by deputies, 
different factions, Defense Ministry representatives, and so 
forth. Obviously, there is a desire on the part of many military 
experts as a whole to assess the treaty as a relatively isolated 
phenomenon in international life and to look only at its 
military-strategic and military-political aspects. At the same 
time, the attitude taken by the corps of deputies to the START 
II Treaty will reveal a closer linkage with Russia's domestic 
life and with the voters' direct interests -- and this attitude, 
despite the extensive discussion of the treaty's provisions in 
the press, has not yet been finally formulated. It is likely 
that in the course of preparations for the START II ratification 
hearings, the corps of deputies will demand that the problems 
relating to the multifaceted and, perhaps, contradictory impact 
of the START II Treaty's implementation on the development of 
the political, economic, and social processes under way in 
Russia be clarified. 
  Attention will most probably be fixed on issues such as the 
reasons for the positive assessment of the treaty (and even, in 
a number of cases, the lobbying for it) by representatives of 
the military-industrial complex and the professional military; 
the correlation between the treaty's provisions and the emergent 
system of new state policy and our sphere of national interests; 
the treaty's impact on the pace and direction of scientific and 
technical progress in Russia, on the elaboration of new advanced 
technology, on the implementation of our national space program, 
and on the closure or adaptation [rasformirovaniye ili 
pereprofilirovaniye] of existing military educational 
establishments; the economic and environmental consequences for 
specific regions, the cost of implementation, and so forth. The 
corps of deputies will only take an objective view of the 
ratification of the START II Treaty if issues of interest to a 
wide range of the Russian population -- rather than just those 
to which military specialists and diplomats are trying to 
restrict themselves -- are discussed. Thus, the range of 
problems which it will be necessary and sufficient to resolve in 
order to reach a decision on the treaty remains very vague and 
is tending to expand. 
  The emergent situation and the increased distrust of 
"departmental" views which the new Duma may follow the Supreme 
Soviet in expressing are in line with the realities of political 
life in Russia, will be transient (as the experience of other 
countries shows), and will focus attention yet again on the need 
to improve expert assessment of the decisionmaking process 
within the framework of the formation of our new democratic 
institutions. 
  At the same time, in purely military terms it is clear that, 
in order to reliably deter any aggressor, it will be necessary 
to preserve the triad in the structure of Russia's strategic 
nuclear forces (the Strategic Rocket Forces plus sea-launched 
and air-launched strategic nuclear systems) and a rational 
structure for the Strategic Rocket Forces -- silo-based and 
road-mobile missile systems. Only this kind of structure will 
be able to have the requisite combat readiness, survivability, 
and military flexibility with the optimum financial expenditure 
in the foreseeable future. The expenditure point is of no 
little importance to Russia. The switch to a dyad (Strategic 
Rocket Forces plus sea-launched strategic nuclear forces or some 
other combination) is for Russia -- and this cannot be said of 
the United States -- unjustifiable for economic and efficiency 
reasons. Moreover, statements about a dyad are, as a rule, 
restricted to the most general arguments and are not backed up 
by any kind of serious calculations. 
  Russia's main task in the context of strategic offensive 
arms 
reduction is to further improve its strategic nuclear forces, 
not least as regards enhancing the operational safety of 
aviation missile systems. If the START II Treaty is ratified 
and the structure and components of our strategic nuclear forces 
are improved, Russia will have a sufficient deterrent potential 
and will not be left "defenseless in the face of the threat of 
nuclear blackmail." A necessary condition for this is the 
implementation of an armaments and military hardware development 
program that meets the demands of Russia's military doctrine, 
the present-day political and strategic situation in the world, 
and the real level of military danger to our country. Only in 
this event will the Russian eagle be able to hang on to its 
nuclear sword, which plays a key role in protecting Russia's 
national interests and actual integrity -- at least until such 
time as the economy and domestic stability become effective 
components in our national might.

<F P=106> [Mikhail Berger article: "When the Military Wants To Seize </F>
the Treasury, It Needs Neither Tanks Nor Special-Purpose Troops. 
One Mercedes Is Sufficient"] 
  [Text] It became known Tuesday evening that the Russian 
president had agreed to the proposal by the State Duma Defense 
Committee to increase defense spending this year to 55 trillion 
rubles [R]. This committee's proposals, sent to the premier, 
bear the endorsement of Boris Yeltsin: "I deem it expedient to 
agree." 
  As is known, the figure of R37.1 trillion for defense 
features in all the versions of the government draft, including 
the one submitted once again to the Duma for discussion 11 May. 
Back at the beginning of March, when the sum of the proposed 
military spending became known, the military department together 
with the military-industrial complex mounted an extensive 
campaign for the radical revision of that figure. Upward, 
naturally. 
  Until very recently, however, the military was losing this 
war for money. Blackmail by military industrialists, who had 
declared at the beginning of March that such a budget would lead 
to the closure of 3,000 enterprises in the military-industrial 
complex, failed to make the expected impression. Pavel 
Grachev's March memorandum to Boris Yeltsin had no direct 
consequences, although, according to the newspaper SEGODNYA, it 
gained the president's endorsement: "I share the defense 
minister's concern." 
  Two months later -- two months which the military lobby, to 
all appearances, did not waste -- there came a series of 
conferences of interested persons and departments in this 
regard. They culminated in a discussion of the problem with 
Yuriy Baturin, the president's assistant for national security. 
Everyone there naturally claimed that national security demands 
a sharp increase in defense spending. 
  Two months ago the military's appetite extended to R80 
trillion. Given the total budget expenditure planned at the 
time of R183 trillion, this meant that almost 44 percent of all 
state spending would go on defense. 
  It should be pointed out that even high-ranking nonmilitary 
experts in the government were speaking of the unrealistically 
low level of defense spending planned for this year. Their 
chief argument was that the sector of the economy associated 
with defense cannot be cut back as fast as the whole of the rest 
of the country's economy. 
  The maintenance of personnel (wages, clothing allowance, 
etc.) accounts for the lion's share of the expenditure. This 
part cannot be sharply reduced for the very reason that an 
officer being transferred to the reserve must receive 20 times 
his monthly salary and other benefits, which add up to a tidy 
sum. In such a situation it is cheaper for the Ministry of 
Defense to maintain the military than to reduce it. 
  There are grounds for believing that the chief internal 
spring of the military's financial activeness is the fact that 
it has ALREADY PLACED THE DEFENSE ORDER FOR 1994 IN THE SUM OF 
R28.3 TRILLION, WHILE THE EXISTING BUDGET GIVES IT NO MORE THAN 
R5.5 TRILLION FOR THIS 
  At the last conference with Baturin the chief opponent of 
the 
military lobby (ex officio, at least) -- Andrey Astakhov, deputy 
minister of finance -- showed sympathy toward the sphere which 
he supervises. He said that it is necessary to add to the 
military's money, but within the limits of the overall figures 
for state expenditure already defined. 
  There are no grounds for doubting that only the first part 
of 
the deputy minister's sentence will be taken on board. 
  True, the new figure for military spending remains just a 
project at present. Acting Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin's 
telephone conversation with the premier on this subject, which 
took place Wednesday morning, did not turn this proposal into 
the government's position, but neither did it cancel it out. 
  If the military succeeds in seeing this operation to seize 
the treasury through to its logical end, it will receive 28 
percent of all the state expenditure in the present budget or 
almost half of the budget's actually expected income. The 
existing draft budget allocates 20 percent of expenditure to 
defense. 
  Knowledgeable people in the government say that if 
parliament 
approves a 50-percent increase in military spending, it will be 
practically impossible to avoid allocating this money, 
regardless of actual income. It will be sufficient for 
Grachev's Mercedes to drive peacefully into the Kremlin. A very 
tough instruction to the Ministry of Finance follows after every 
such drive: Allocate money! Money will be allocated even if 
this takes half the treasury's money, even if Russia is left a 
country with the largest number of servicemen per head of the 
civilian population.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Ostanin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 11 TASS -- Moscow's Military Court 
confirmed on Wednesday that the dismissal of Colonel Stanislav 
Terekhov from the army was legal. 
  Terekhov was sacked on September 23, 1993 by Russian Defence 
Minister Pavel Grachev for violation of the contract and 
disobeying his commanders, ITAR-TASS learnt from sources close 
to the Defence Ministry. 
  Terekhov, who is also chairman of the Union of Army 
Officers, 
was detained on charges of plotting an attack on the 
headquarters of CIS united armed forces after President Boris 
Yeltsin dissolved the parliament last autumn and has been in 
custody since then. 
  Terekhov did not deny the charges, but said he was against 
using guns. He was released under amnesty earlier this year. 
  Additionally, Terekhov is charged with participation in May 
Day riots in 1993 which killed one and injured dozens of people.

<F P=106> [Own correspondent Vladimir Gundarov report from </F>
Severodvinsk under the "In Brief" rubric: "At Present, Ships 
Are Also Born in Pain"] 
  [Text] The creation of the "Severodvinsk" nuclear-powered 
submarine -- KRASNAYA ZVEZDA reported the laying of its keel in 
late December -- has entailed painstaking efforts from the first 
days of building work. The shipbuilders are not satisfied with 
the quality of design documents, which, according to 
specialists, can bear no criticism. This is not the sole reason 
for wrecking the timetable of work on the building stocks, 
however. According to M. Zhukov, who is responsible for 
commissioning the ship, the main reason are undersupplies of 
metal and steel work because "Sevmashpredpriyatiye" 
[Severodvinsk Engineering Enterprise] does not have money to pay 
to supplier plants in advance.

  [Text] It is a pleasant and rare occasion considering the 
days we live in -- a five-year treaty of cooperation between the 
Smolensk AES [Atomic Electric Power Station) and the Belorussian 
[Belarus] Energy Ministry has been signed. 
  The document envisions mutually advantageous terms of 
technical and material assistance, and the provision of 
scientific and technical information. 
  This event was preceded by another, no less important event 
-- a 750-kilovolt power transmission line originating at the 
"Belorusskaya" substation at the Smolensk AES was put in 
operation. 
  The 750-kilovolt power transmission line was constructed 
jointly by builders and operation personnel of Smolensk's 
Desnogorsk and of Belorussia. A large group of builders and 
operation personnel of the Smolensk AES were awarded 
certificates of honor of Belorussia's Supreme Soviet and the 
Ministry of Power Engineering for this successful work.

  [Text] Moscow -- On 9 June, enterprises of the Russian 
defense complex will halt the output of civilian products and 
consumer goods for five to ten minutes, and will accompany this 
action by blowing their sirens. A decision to this effect has 
been made by the Central Council of the sectoral trade union in 
support of the initiative of "defense workers" of Novosibirsk, 
Vladimir, Kirov, Moscow, and a number of other oblasts. "We 
hope to impress the government, which continues to ignore the 
needs of the sector's working people," said the union leader 
Sergey Shuklin. Simultaneously, he intimated, it was suggested 
that work collectives discuss at the rallies, meetings, and 
conferences whether it is wise to go over to the extreme form of 
protest -- a strike. In Shuklin's words, military-industrial 
complex working people "do not demand any subsidies or 
privileges, and only insist on the most essential thing -- to be 
paid on time and to keep their jobs."

<F P=106> [From the "Today" newscast: Report from the Baltiyskiy </F>
Zavod shipyard in St. Petersburg on cruiser Petr Velikiy by 
Sergey Dedukh and Vladimir Spirenkov] 
  [Text] Despite defense budget cuts and the decline of the 
arms industry, Russia continues to build warships. An NTV 
camera team was able to visit the Baltiyskiy Zavod shipyard in 
St. Petersburg where the nuclear cruiser Petr Velikiy is being 
built -- the biggest surface ship currently under construction 
in Russia. Until now no TV company has managed to visit this 
ship, although interest remains high. 
  The building of the cruiser Petr Velikiy -- a giant ship and 
a unique technological creation -- began in 1988. After the 
unfinished ship was launched, difficulties with funding set in. 
For some 18 months the cruiser and its builders waited for their 
fate to be decided. 
  In his day, [Tsar] Peter I encouraged merchants to form 
guilds which then built ships with their own resources. The 
Ministry of Defense cannot resort to such simple solutions. 
Major banks were invited to furnish the funds for the ship 
which is to become the pride of the Russian Navy. But the 
present-day financiers showed no interest in this project. The 
money was nonetheless found, and construction and finishing 
operations are to be completed by the fall of next year. The 
Defense Ministry leadership regards the Petr Velikiy as a 
priority project. 
  [Andrey Kokoshin, Russian Federation first deputy defense 
minister] The Armed Forces need this ship, and so does the 
country, despite the difficult situation it is in. Even in this 
difficult situation the country cannot permit such unique 
creations to remain unfinished. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] The Petr Velikiy is the latest 
modification in a series of four similar ships. The cruiser is 
nuclear-powered. And these are the tubes for launching cruise 
missiles. Apart from them the cruiser will be armed with 
large-caliber guns, torpedoes, and anti-aircraft guns and will 
be able to carry two helicopters. The cruiser will have a crew 
of 780, most of whom are already taking part in building the 
ship. The workers, who have carried on working even after their 
pay was no longer forthcoming, are promising that the St. 
Andrew's flag will be hoisted on the Petr Velikiy in September 
of next year in time for the celebrations of the 300th 
anniversary of the Russian Navy. It is envisaged that the 
cruiser will serve in the Pacific. 
  Apart from Russia, only the United States has ships of this 
kind. 
  Sergey Dedukh and Vladimir Spirenko reporting for NTV from 
St. Petersburg.

  [Text] At the present time there is no evidence whatsoever 
to suggest that the leaking of corrosive products and 
plutonium-239 from the torpedo warheads on board the Komsomolets 
atomic submarine could do any significant harm to the fishing 
industry of countries fishing in the Norwegian and Barents seas. 
This conclusion is contained in a report by experts of the 
State Ecological Commission of Russia's Ministry for 
Environmental Protection and Natural Resources. The experts say 
that, even if the most pessimistic forecasts prove correct, the 
dose which could be received by man if the plutonium escapes 
into the environment is significantly less than the annual 
permissible maximum which the human body can absorb. The 
conclusions of the expert commission were released by the press 
center of Russia's Ministry for Natural Resources.

  [Text] Bishkek, 11 May -- The presidential press service 
published a statement today in the newspaper SLOVO KYRGYZSTAN 
[WORD FROM KYRGYZSTAN] in which it tried to evaluate the 
political, economic, and social situation in the Republic. The 
document emphasizes that the current government has not dealt 
with the tasks of taxation and budget replenishment. 
Administration of the budget is practically uncontrolled. 
People are becoming more impoverished, resulting in an 
oversupply of goods. Every fourth enterprise is losing money, 
and, at the same time, not a single one has been declared 
bankrupt. 
  The major stabilizing factor of the sociopolitical situation 
is the slow down in the inflation rate, says the statement. It 
protects a wide range of the population with fixed incomes from 
falling standards of living. This also creates conditions for 
attracting investment to production. The president is now 
taking urgent steps aimed at improving the situation. 
  At the same time, contractual relations related to 
preferential financing of economic and social reforms with 
international financial organizations are on the brink of 
breakdown. 
  In light of the lowered living standards of working people, 
the government's policy, aimed at slowing down the settlement of 
the issue on developing gold mines and attracting foreign 
investment on a mutually beneficial basis, seems to be 
illogical. Incidentally, President Askar Akayev and deputies of 
the regional soviet of (?Karakol) will examine issues of the 
government's policy with regard to the Kumtor gold mine today. 
  The statement ends with the words: "We are building a 
democratic state that is capable of implementing laws for the 
benefit of our people. This is our decision and we are not 
deviating from this path."

  [Text] In his interview with Interfax Levon Zubaryan, aide 
of the Armenian president, reconfirmed the information about the 
preparation for a meeting between Armenian and Azerbaijani 
presidents on the settlement of the Karabakh conflict scheduled 
for the near term in Moscow. At the same time he reported that 
the precise date is as yet unknown. According to Zubaryan, 
"preparatory diplomatic work is being carried out with the 
mediation of the Russian side." 
  In Zubaryan's words, this meeting has been foreseen by the 
protocol signed on the results of the meeting between 
representatives of the parliaments of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and 
Nagorno-Karabakh under the mediation of the CIS 
Inter-Parliamentary Assembly on May 5 in Bishkek. 
  One of the items of the protocol says that the appeals to 
cease fire in the conflict zone should be fixed "in the near 
term by signing a reliable and legal agreement which would 
stipulate a mechanism preventing resumption of any military and 
hostile actions, withdrawal of forces from the occupied 
territories, restoration of communications, return of refugees, 
and continuation of the negotiation process."

  [Text] Dear listeners, we now present a report on the 
latest situation in the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] and the 
border between Armenia and Azerbaijan. 
  The reports we received from the NKR a short while ago 
indicate that the situation is far from being stable. The 
reason is the Azerbaijan military forces' systematic violation 
of the cease-fire understanding. The Azerbaijan National Army 
[ANA] units have intensely shelled the NKR defense positions 
with artillery and then attacked them. It must be noted that 
the Armenian side has tried to refrain from retaliating against 
ANA attacks to create an opportunity for the implementation of 
the measures in the protocol that was signed in Bishkek. 
However, they have not always been able to do so. 
  Apparently certain forces in Azerbaijan wish to obstruct the 
peace talks. The war serves the interests of those circles that 
believe that their political ambitions are more important than 
the people's interests. The maintenance of the fighting [words 
indistinct]. However, we hope that Azerbaijan's leaders will 
honor their signatures on the protocol signed in Bishkek and 
will work to implement its provisions, otherwise the 
confrontation may deepen. That state of affairs would not be in 
Azerbaijan's favor. 
  Undoubtedly, Azerbaijan has realized that the maintenance of 
the confrontation [words indistinct]. However, the combat 
operations have not been halted and the situation has continued 
to be unstable. The NKR Defense Army Headquarters has disclosed 
that the ANA units launched an attack on [place name indistinct] 
in Mardakertskiy Rayon at 0500 this morning. A preparatory 
artillery barrage preceded their onslaught, but their attack 
failed to achieve its objective. The Armenian defense forces 
counterattacked and forced them to withdraw to their previous 
positions. As usual, the ANA units suffered many casualties. 
  A high-level agreement has been reached to end the fighting, 
so why should the war continue? 
  The combat operations were not limited to Mardakertskiy 
Rayon. The NKR defense positions in Askeranskiy Rayon in the 
eastern theater of the war were also shelled by artillery units. 
There were combat operations in that part of the front line 
this afternoon, too. 
  The ANA units shelled the Armenian defense positions in 
Askeranskiy Rayon yesterday. Later they attacked Yarymdzha in 
Mardakertskiy Rayon. However, their attacks were rebuffed. 
Dozens of ANA officers and men have been killed over the past 
three days in Azerbaijan's unjust war for Armenian territory. 
  No incidents occurred in the border between Armenia and 
Azerbaijan last night and this morning. We hope that this will 
continue.

  [Text] Russia continues to put pressure on Estonia over 
the retired military tying this issue to the resumption of 
inter-state negotiations, became evident from an interview given 
to ETA by the head of the Russian negotiating team, Vasiliy 
Svirin. 
  "We cannot understand why Estonia has adopted such an 
inhuman 
attitude towards the retired military," Svirin said. "If Estonia 
abandoned that position we could solve many problems we face," 
he said while adding that Russia does not intend to postpone 
inter- state negotiations. 
  Russia's position is that recent rounds have ended without 
results and have become negotiations for the sake of 
negotiations, Svirin said adding that no agreements have been 
initialed. 
  Therefore, Russia has proposed that all four working groups 
meet in Moscow and draw up proposals in order to come out of the 
deadlock. 
  "When those proposals are ready, we will together with 
Ambassador Vaino Reinart decide when the next round of 
negotiations will take place and the Ambassador has agreed," 
Svirin said. 
  Estonia's position is that the retired Russian military 
should leave the country. 
  Latvia recently went to a compromise with Russia allowing 
some 20,000 Russian ex-officers to stay in Latvia.

  [Text] The Latvian army has not conscripted soldiers for 
compulsory service since the end of April. The call-up was 
suspended due to lack of funds in the budget needed to maintain 
and train soldiers. Aleksandrs Doniks, head of the state 
service department, told the LABRIT newspaper that the call-up 
has been suspended until the number of soldiers on compulsory 
service falls and there is enough money to maintain them. 
  According to estimates made by the Defense Ministry at the 
beginning of this year, the maintenance of a soldier for the 
duration of his service costs approximately 1,050 lats, 
excluding the funds needed to buy machinery, arms, and 
ammunition. If the call-up is suspended for a longer time, then 
toward the fall there will be a shortage of about 750 soldiers 
on the border.

  [Text] Bonn, 11 May--"A new, complicated era will begin in 
bilateral relations after the withdrawal of Russian troops from 
Germany this August." Russian President Boris Yeltsin made this 
statement today before starting talks with German Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl. 
  The Russian opposition has been saying that "Germany will 
turn away from Russia completely after the withdrawal of Russian 
troops and will not help with its reforms, as it had been doing 
very actively in recent years under the leadership of Helmut 
Kohl." Answering this opposition, Yeltsin said: "I trust Helmut 
Kohl--his high moral standards, his decency, and his great 
political experience. An era of national reconciliation between 
two countries and two peoples--of Russia and Germany--will 
begin." 
  The Russian leader stressed that Russia wanted to be a full 
member of all European organizations. He reminded that Germany 
would be chair of the leading bodies of the European Union 
beginning 1 July 1994. "And, of course, we hope for support 
from Germany for Russia's participation in all of the European 
and international organizations," Yeltsin said. He especially 
stressed the importance of Russia as a European state. "Russia 
is a European country, and one should not forget this fact," 
the president said. 
  "During the course of today's hopefully peaceful, normal, 
human, but, of course, political and principled talks, I am sure 
that we will achieve together with my friend Helmut Kohl a full 
understanding and will settle the problems that we are facing 
today. They are there, and it is futile to make a secret of 
them," the president noted.

  [Text] Bonn, 11 May -- Russia's President Boris Yeltsin and 
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl have begun their talks at the FRG 
chancellor's department in Bonn. The talks are being held 
behind closed doors. They will subsequently be continued with 
other delegation members taking part. 
  It is thought that the issue of finalizing the withdrawal of 
Russian troops will be one of the main topics on the agenda of 
the consultatons between B. Yeltsin and H. Kohl. Considerable 
attention will also be focused on the problems of economic 
cooperation between the FRG and Russia, and topical 
international political problems. 
  B. Yeltsin and H. Kohl will today hold a joint news 
conference on the results of the talks in Bonn.

<F P=106> [Report by Valeriy Konovalov: "Agriculture Reaps Money </F>
Harvest in Parliament"] 
  [Text] The Russian State Duma deputies returned to the 
discussion of the draft federal budget for this year on 11 May. 
A significantly updated document was submitted for their 
perusal following the work done on it by the government 
commission in conjunction with representatives of Duma 
committees. As a result the parameters of the proposed budget 
underwent rather major alterations. 
  Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin told deputies that the 
amendments amount to increases in the expenditure and revenue 
parts of the budget. But the proportions have significantly 
shifted in the direction of increased expenditure. 
  It is envisaged that budget revenue will now increase by 
3,776.5 billion rubles [R] and will thus be R124,477 billion. 
Where will it come from? Primarily from the 1 July change in 
customs duties and corresponding change in value-added tax. The 
tax collected specifically for the needs of the agro-industrial 
complex and coal industry is to increase by a little over R1 
trillion. Revenue will also be swelled as a result of duty 
changes and increased revenue from privatization. As we can 
see, all these sources are rather problematic, and the 
implementation of them will depend on many factors. 
  As for expenditure, the situation is far more definite. This 
part will certainly be implemented. The plan is for expenditure 
to increase by R10,188.3 billion. That will make it R193,324 
billion. As a result the budget deficit will rise from R62 
trillion to R68.847 trillion, constituting 9.5 percent of gross 
domestic product. 
  What is the increase in state expenditure? The lion's share 
goes to the agro-industrial complex. As Sergey Dubinin 
explained, a solution has been found which will not have serious 
inflationary consequences, since the increased budget 
appropriations will be accompanied by reduced Central Bank 
credits for the countryside. The components of the Federation 
will be allocated more than R5 trillion on a repayment basis to 
give agricultural producers advances and to purchase products. 
Moreover, the agro-industrial complex will be allocated more 
than R2 trillion from the budget for other purposes. 
  There is yet another item on which more budget money will be 
spent -- social and cultural needs. An extra R968.4 billion is 
to be allocated for this purpose. Nearly half of it will go to 
the media, mainly television and radio. An extra R345 billion 
is to be allocated for the purchase of drugs. 
  According to the minister, the protracted examination of the 
budget was a lesson for the government and for parliament, so 
the intention is to submit the draft budget for next year to the 
deputies by September.

  [Text] Before the end of 1994 the European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development will allocate credits amounting 
to $100 million to Moldova. The parties reached this agreement 
in the course of the negotiations between the Moldovan 
delegation and the EBRD leadership late April in London, the 
republic's Prime Minister Andrey Sangeli declared to Financial 
Information Agency. 
  In particular, a $26-million credit will be channeled for 
the 
reconstruction of seven wine-producing factories and financing 
of the construction of a glass factory in Kishinev [Chisinau] 
with the participation of foreign investors. A $20-million 
credit is to be used to support Moldova's fuel and energy 
complex (in particular, for the reconstruction of the central 
heating station in the city of Beltsy and for the financing of 
the governmental program on energy economy). The EBRD intends 
to open a credit line totalling $20 million to back private 
entrepreneurs in Moldova. 
  The order and conditions of credits are to be finally 
coordinated in August 1994, underlined Sangeli, however, it is 
suppose that for the Republic's commercial banks the interest 
rate on credits would not exceed 10 percent. 
  Until now the International Monetary Fund and International 
Bank for Reconstruction and Development have rendered assistance 
to Moldova. The total volume of their financial aid to the 
republic has exceeded $300 million.

<F P=106> [Report by Lyudmila Feliksova: "Moldavia [Moldova]: The </F>
Leu Is Still Keeping Afloat, But Industry Is Drowning"] 
  [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] -- There have not been that 
many successes in the economic life of Moldavia. But there has 
been one: The leu, contrary to gloomy forecasts, which 
predicted for it the fate of the Ukrainian karbovanets, is still 
keeping afloat. Supported by nothing but transfusions from 
international financial organizations, the leu is nevertheless 
remaining stable. It is the hardest currency among the CIS 
republics, the "Logos-press" economic review maintains, citing 
specific figures in confirmation. At the beginning of January 
the exchange rate stood at 364 Moldavian lei to U.S.$100, and at 
the end of March at 399 to $100, i.e. an increase in the dollar 
against the leu of just 9.6 percent, which is not that much. 
  Michael Blackwell, IMF representative in Moldavia, also 
makes 
an optimistic assessment of the national currency's position. 
The rate of inflation has fallen sharply. Whereas it stood at 
50 percent in December, in February it was down to 26 percent. 
The IMF representative predicts 1-3 percent a month by the end 
of the year -- no higher than in other developed European 
countries. M. Blackwell sees as the reason for this stability of 
the leu the strong reform program chosen by the Moldavian 
Government and the rigid control over the financial policy of 
the National Bank, which has limited total credit and is abiding 
strictly by the memorandum signed with the IMF. If the National 
Bank continues to keep to the chosen line, Blackwell believes, 
then soon "healthy economic growth will begin" in Moldavia, 
while the strong currency will make enterprises adopt "more 
rational decisions." 
  So the leu is stable, which cannot, alas, be said of the 
state of Moldavia's industrial potential. It is steadily 
declining. The nonpayment of wages for several months in many 
sectors has become a chronic illness in the Republic. 
  Far from everyone in Moldavia shares the IMF 
representative's 
optimism. In particular, A. Muravskiy, parliamentary deputy 
from the Agrarian Democratic Party, believes that the IMF 
financial policy resembles the actions of surgeons who treat all 
diseases in just one way -- with a surgical operation. 
International consultants rigidly apply the same yardstick to 
Nicaragua, Poland, and Moldavia, regarding them as some 
experimental test bed. But only a few people are familiar with 
the memorandum, which the chief program of the financial policy, 
and it can be judged only on indirect signs. These are not very 
reassuring. "If the optimum point is not seized," Muravskiy 
remarked, "a social storm could blow up and sweep aside both 
this parliament and this government." 
  The Moldavian Union of Industrialists believes that it is 
the 
anti-inflationary monetary policy according to other people's 
prescriptions that has put the Republic's industry in a grave 
financial position, and it has demanded that the memorandum be 
examined in parliament with a view to amending it. 
  Prime Minister A. Sangheli has reaffirmed, however, that the 
government will not alter the chosen course and will take the 
path of reforms. 
  The very near future will evidently show whether Moldavia 
will succeed in improving the health of the economy or whether 
the leu's stability will remain a local "economic miracle."

  [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau], 11 May -- The leadership of 
Moldavia [Moldova] and the unrecognized Gagauz Republic have 
taken steps toward a peace settlement within the Gagauz problem. 
A meeting of the sides' parliamentary commissions is to take 
place in Kishinev on 12 May. They will discuss the draft law on 
the legal status of the Gagauz settlements. Today, it was 
discussed at a closed sitting of the commission of the Gagauz 
Parliament, which was attended by its president, Stepan Topal. 
The draft law grants the Gagauz people broad self-government 
within a single Moldavia. 
  According to Komrat (Gagauz capital) sources, disagreements 
appeared between the sides yesterday. They relate to the 
articles of the draft law, which define the status of the Gagauz 
rayons, their administration, and the division of powers between 
the republic's central leadership and local bodies. 
  Komrat's spokesmen proposed that changes should be made to 
the draft law, which envisages setting up the "Gagauz-eri" 
national and territorial entity in southern Moldavia. They 
insist on adopting their own constitution and are against the 
proposed procedure for appointing judges and heads of power 
bodies, which provides for their appointment by collegiums of 
the relevant Moldavian ministries. Kishinev disagrees with this. 
  Despite this, it looks as if the sides have managed to draw 
up compromise decisions, which will be discussed at tomorrow's 
meeting.

  [Text] The Russian leadership continues a policy of 
blockade and isolation against the Chechen republic, a statement 
of the Chechen Foreign Ministry transferred to Interfax on 
Wednesday says. 
  "For us the fact of forming a delegation led by Vice-Premier 
Sergey Shakhray for talks with the Chechen republic by 
resolution of the Russian government dated May 3 is just another 
step of such a policy," the statement says. 
  "However in reality this delegation of the Russian 
Federation 
turned out to be formed for talks with the leadership of the 
Chechen opposition who have already arrived in Moscow," the 
Chechen Foreign Ministry notes. "The will of the Chechen people 
and efforts of its legitimate president aimed at the settlement 
of relations with the Russian Federation are ignored once again." 
  The Chechen Foreign ministry urged all international 
organizations and the press "to condemn actions by the Russian 
leadership running contrary to the norms and principles of 
international law."

  [Text] Kiev May 11 TASS -- The newly elected members of the 
Supreme Soviet (parliament) of Ukraine have set about working in 
a business-like manner. 
  Ivan Yemets, chairman of the Central Electoral Commission, 
opened the inaugural session on Wednesday. 
  According to Yemets, a total of 338 deputies were elected to 
the parliament; 168 of them represent various political parties, 
and communists make up a fourth of these. 
  The party of Narodnyy Rukh has six percent of the seats, 
while the Peasants' Party holds five and the Socialist Party -- 
four percent. 
  Twelve women were elected to parliament. 
  The legislators represent various nationalities: Ukrainians 
account for 75 percent of the total number, Russians -- for 20 
percent. 
  At the suggestion of a working group which prepared the 
inaugural session, the legislators elected an interim presidium, 
which brought together Vasiliy Dudinets, former first deputy 
parliament speaker; Aleksandr Moroz, chairman of the Socialist 
Party; Petr Simonenko, communist leader; Vitaliy Masol, former 
Ukrainian prime minister; and Vyacheslav Chernovil, leader of 
the Narodnyy Rukh. 
  Participants in the session are tackling organizational 
issues. 
  It was announced that Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk 
would deliver a report "On Political and Social and Economic 
Situation in the Country" before the deputies at an early date. 
  Progress reports prepared by the government and chairman of 
the governing board of the National Bank will also be heard. 
  President Kravchuk participates in the parliament session.

  [Text] Simferopol, [no date as received] -- A session of 
the Crimean Supreme Council continued on 11 May. As expected, 
the election of the chairman of the autonomous republic led to 
the first parliamentary crisis. 
  The morning session discussed the election of deputy 
speakers 
of the Crimean Supreme Council. Sehiy [Sergey] Tsekov proposed 
Oleksiy Melnykov, deputy head of the Republican Party of Crimea 
and head of the party's Sevastopol branch, and Viktor Mezhak, 
head of the People's Party of Crimea, for this post. After a 
long and stormy discussion, Oleksiy Melnykov's candidacy was 
rejected; 44 voted in favor and 46 against. Viktor Mezhak's 
candidacy was also rejected (24 for and 53 against with 17 
abstentions). The chairman of the Crimean Supreme Council 
announced a break until 1500 for consultations regarding new 
candidates. 
  During an interval, deputies discussed the possibility of 
nominating Admiral Oleksandr Frolov, deputy commander of the 
Black Sea Fleet responsible for combat training, and Refat 
Chubarov, deputy chairman of the Majlis of the Crimean Tatar 
people and leader of the Kurultay's deputies group. 
  Commenting on the situation, Leonid Hrach, first secretary 
of 
the Communist Party of Crimea, noted: "I did not expect such a 
level from our parliament. It is possible to have a middle or a 
low level but what I see is simply primitive. Progressive 
forces among the deputies will hardly make contact with the 
present leadership of the Supreme Council, or to be more 
specific, with the leader. Such a situation will, in my 
opinion, last for about another two months, until the next 
round."

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] The set of amendments that President Boris Yeltsin 
made to the law on deputies' status has now been made available 
to Interfax news agency. 
  In a paper of May 10, Yeltsin says that parts of the law he 
endorsed on May 8 were in breach of the country's Constitution. 
  The president contests the deputy's right to unimpeded 
access 
to all government bodies--both federal and local--, and to visit 
plants, offices and agencies, army units and public groups--on 
the grounds that this has no relation to the parliament's law 
making activity. Nor is he for the deputy being entitled to 
free access to any government official and the latter being 
bound to give a prompt reply to his questioning. 
  Yeltsin thinks that the law as it is now will vest the 
parliament with legislative, executive and controlling functions. 
  He is also opposed to a broader interpretation of the 
deputy's right to a prompt reply to his questions on the grounds 
that this will not be an expression of the legislature's 
controlling function. 
  Yeltsin thinks it necessary to bring the provision on 
further 
guarantees of parliamentary immunity in line with the 
appropriate clause of the Constitution. 
  He also wants to amend parts of the law concerning the 
conflict between parliamentary and civil service duties. 
Yeltsin insists that the period that members of the armed 
forces, police or prosecuting officers spend carrying out 
parliamentary duties must be put on their usual work record and 
they must be allowed to resume their former jobs when their term 
in office expires. 
  Yeltsin says the law on the deputies' status was adopted in 
breach of the constitutional procedures. Any bill providing for 
federal spending is subject to government approval, something 
that the authors of the law have failed to obtain, he said. 
  Yeltsin pointed to the abundance of mistakes of a legal 
nature, terminology and style in the law saying he authorized 
his envoy Aleksandr Yakovlev to brief the State Duma about them 
in the order of the day.

<F P=106> [Sergey Chugayev article: "Who Will Take on the Sin of </F>
Violating the Constitution: the President or the Legislators?"] 
  [Text] As already reported, on 8 May the Russian president 
signed the federal Law "On the Status of the Deputy of the 
Federation Council and the Status of a Deputy of the State Duma 
of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly." 
  At the same time B. Yeltsin addressed a letter to the 
Federal 
Assembly deputies in which he pointed out that the decision to 
sign had been difficult, since the law contains 
"obvious...contradictions with the Constitution." In the very 
near future the legislators are to be sent a list of the 
president's amendments, which the head of state proposes that 
the deputies should adopt without waiting for the Constitutional 
Court's decision. 
  In all, it is expected that there will be four amendments. 
In particular, the right of deputies, recorded in the law, to 
freely visit all organs of state power without exception, to be 
received without delay by leaders of all ranks, and to receive 
answers to their questions within reduced times is to be 
disputed. The right, proposed in the law, to put a deputy's 
question, the inclusion of additional guarantees of a deputy's 
immunity in the text of the law, and also the possibility 
granted to servicemen-legislators not to be discharged but 
merely to suspend their service in the Armed Forces while 
carrying out their duties as a deputy have also been deemed not 
in accordance with the Constitution. 
  It is hard to regard the president's step of signing a 
rather 
debatable document as anything but a continuation of the policy 
of achieving civil accord in the country. The demonstration of 
a desire to cooperate with parliament really makes an 
impression. From this aspect the only question is whether 
Yeltsin will succeed in breaking the well-known trend whereby 
all previous similar gestures were regarded by his opponents 
exclusively as a weakness. 
  In the opinion of expert jurists, however, the president's 
signature on the law, which he himself has publicly described as 
running counter to the Constitution, could have by no means so 
clear consequences. The prehistory of the appearance of 
Yeltsin's signature on the document seems characteristic in this 
connection. 
  According to available information, the Law on a Deputy's 
Status elicited a highly suspicious attitude in the President's 
Staff when it was still being discussed in parliament. In the 
opinion of jurists on the Presidential Staff, it essentially 
means the Sovietization of the Federal Assembly. They believe 
that the legislators have been unable to overcome the 
stereotyped idea of the people's deputy which took shape during 
the years of Soviet power -- the stereotype of someone clever 
with voters' affairs, a pusher for the interests of his own 
enterprises, and a regional lobbyist, although, as stated in 
Article 1 of that same law, the chief and only task of the 
deputy is to exercise legislative power. An analysis of 
deputies' letters received in the staff of the president and the 
government confirms this thesis -- an absolute majority of them 
represents lobbying for their own interests or narrow group 
interests. 
  But the jurists were chiefly concerned at the fact that the 
legislators had shown a desire to correct the Constitution not 
by making amendments to the Fundamental Law but by adopting 
legislative acts. 
  The leaders of the power structures also came out 
unexpectedly against the law. As a result, even S. Filatov, 
head of the President's Staff, started tending toward a 
presidential veto of the document. Of the president's immediate 
entourage, virtually only G. Satarov believed that the law 
should still be signed. A draft edict on a presidential veto 
had been prepared by the State Legal Administration. At the 
last moment, however, to all appearances, Satarov's opinion 
outweighed the opinion of the rest, and Yeltsin signed the law. 
A casualty of these contradictions was the State Legal 
Administration, debarred from further work on the law. 
  A number of jurists believe that the president should not 
have recognized the unconstitutionality of the law. By signing 
it, he assumed responsibility for the constitutionality of the 
law and himself violated the Constitution. According to 
available information, the leadership of the State Legal 
Administration under the president sent Yeltsin a letter which 
states, in particular, that, by signing the law, the president 
publicly recognized his double violation of the Constitution and 
that his political opponents are most likely making use of this 
circumstance.

  [Text] Belarus intends to propose considering the division 
of non-military ships of the former USSR's fleet at a CIS 
summit. As Interfax learned in the press service of the CIS 
Executive Secretariat, at the initiative of the Belarussian side 
a meeting of CIS experts is scheduled for next week to discuss 
this issue. 
  In the meantime, a high-ranking official of the Belarussian 
Foreign Ministry, who requested anonymity, told Interfax "this 
idea most probably will be once again killed, because the states 
who are currently owners of non-military ships of the former 
USSR are unlikely to allow this issue to be put on the agenda of 
a CIS summit." 
  The source believes that a significant number of former 
Soviet non-military ships have already been privatized or 
mothballed for a long term. In his opinion, "the time to 
achieve the fleet's division may have been irreversibly missed."

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 13 ITAR-TASS -- Most national newspapers 
lead with reports and comments on President Boris Yeltsin's 
visit to Germany. 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI says "Peace in Europe depends not only on 
Russia and Germany, but their good relations can help develop a 
pan- European security system". The newspaper remarks that one 
of the sensitive issues, concerning the withdrawal of Russian 
troops from Germany, was successfully solved during Yeltsin's 
visit: the last Russian troops will leave on August 31 from 
Berlin, as Moscow insisted, and not from Weimar, as Bonn 
proposed". 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA reports from Bonn that the two countries 
"have succeeded in lifting the shadow which weighed down on 
Russo-German relations lately in connection with the departure 
of the Russian western army". The newspaper stresses that the 
second day of the Russian president's visit to Germany witnessed 
"a special, trustful relationship which has taken shape between 
the leaders of Russia and Federal Germany". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA stresses that "Yeltsin secured a version 
of the Russian troop withdrawal from Germany which is acceptable 
to Russia", while German Chancellor Helmut Kohl "was attuned to 
Moscow's sentiments" 
  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, who accompanies 
Yeltsin on his trip, said "The results of the first days of the 
visit are evident. Solutions have been found which suit both 
countries, and -- most importantly -- a basis has been laid for 
building a common future". 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries a banner "Yeltsin has won the 
battle of Berlin", but admits that Kohl, who was yielding on the 
Berlin question, proved to be indomitable on another point: the 
withdrawal of the Russian troops and the units of our Western 
allies in the anti-Hitler coalition will "proceed separately". 
  The newspaper also mentions shifts in Russia's standpoint on 
cooperation with the North Atlantic alliance: "Helmut Kohl 
succeeded in "keeping the honorable guest from Moscow on track 
for "Partnership for Peace". 
  TRUD reports on the press conference held by the two 
leaders, 
which "revealed the scale of their conversations, their 
efficiency, and their reciprocal movement towards concord". The 
German side supported Russia's striving for integration, the 
newspaper says. The Russian president and the federal chancellor 
stressed that the visit reflected the frank, friendly and 
trustful character of relations between Russia and Germany. 
  PRAVDA says that "talks between the two politicians 
confirmed 
what had been expected: There will be no joint farewell to all 
the four powers of the anti-Hitler coalition, on which Russia, 
and especially its military insisted". The newspaper says that 
no headway was made in solving yet another pressing problem -- 
the exchange of the cultural values which the sides captured 
during World War Two. 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI publishes an interview with Yevgeny Yasin, 
head of the Russian president's analytical centre. The 
prominent economist proclaimed that Boris Yeltsin and Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin are at present "the mainstays of 
political stability in society, which is absolutely needed for 
reforms to continue". 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA comments on the fact that the State Duma 
refused to give the army its "survival minimum" by turning down 
the Defence Ministry's request for an addition of 18 trillion 
roubles to the defence budget. According to the newspaper, the 
cut in the defence budget will lead to a "further obsolescence 
of the army's military technical potential, the curbing of 
restructuring in line with the military reform". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA rebuffs Zbigniew Brzezinsky's statement 
that calls for partnership between Russia and the United States 
are premature. According to the newspaper, "Partnership is 
possible and necessary, although it can hardly be comprehensive, 
simple and smooth at the present stage". 
  The same newspaper carries an interview with Lithuanian 
President Algirdas Brazauskas, who stresses the importance of 
"cooperation of equals" between Russian and his country. The 
Lithuanian president said that "despite complications, present 
relations between lithuania and Russia can be characterised as 
good".

<F P=106> [Report by Valentin Zhdanko under the "Belorussia" rubric: </F>
"Aleksandr Lukashenko Has Lost Slavic Sobor Support. This May 
Enable Kebich To Get Rid of Main Rival in the Race for 
Presidency"] 
  [Text] The "Belaya Rus" Slavic Assembly was the first and 
the biggest political organization to have spoken up in support 
of the candidacy of Aleksandr Lukashenko in the race for the 
presidency and to have actively joined the campaign to collect 
signatures for his nomination. It is this pan-Slavic 
organization that formed the backbone of Mr. Lukashenko's 
initiative group. Its supporters lead the election campaign in 
the provinces -- they were heads of a number of rayon groups 
that collected signatures. 
  It became known late on 10 May that some 100 Slavic Assembly 
activists suddenly declined to support Mr. Lukashenko further 
and that they would stop collecting signatures for his 
nomination. The move is being motivated by Aleksandr 
Lukashenko's alleged retreat from his earlier declared 
principles of joining Russia in a confederative state and his 
taking the liberty of voicing critical remarks about the 
recently signed Russia-Belorussia [Belarus] treaty merging their 
monetary systems. Besides, Lukashenko brought into his ranks 
people who, in the opinion of the Slavic Assembly's leaders, far 
from help the candidate's election program to be ideologically 
consistent. In particular, helping to put together its economic 
part is Valeriy Tsepkalo, former economic adviser to ex-speaker 
Stanislaw Shushkevich. 
  The sudden split in the camp of Mr. Lukashevich's supporters 
may have an appreciable influence on the outcome of the campaign 
to nominate candidates for the presidency. Aleksandr Lukashenko 
has lost a sixth of his initiative group, and chances are that 
he may be short precisely this number of votes to be registered 
as a candidate. The collection of signatures ends 15 May, 
several days from now. 
  Many observers believe that the sudden difficulties plaguing 
Mr. Lukashenko did not arise without some help from the team of 
Premier Vyacheslaw Kebich. Aleksandr Lukashenko's rating, 
according to recent sociological polls, was much higher than the 
prime minister's. Getting rid of a rival before taking the issue 
to the polls would be in this situation the more effective and 
logical move on the part of Mr. Kebich.

  [Text] One of the possible Belarusian presidential 
candidates, Aleksandr Lukashenko, who led the former 
parliamentary commission for combating corruption, told voters 
in Gomel: "Belarus's KGB has audio and video tapes which show 
that the present Parliament Speaker, Mechyslaw Hryb, had 
contacts with representatives of criminal structures." 
Lukashenko demanded that the chairman of the State Security 
Committee, Gennadiy Lavickiy, "show this material to the public." 
  In the meantime, Lavickiy told INTERFAX that his committee 
"has no such materials," and that Lukashenko's statement "is too 
cheap even for a primitive political provocation." 
  At his meeting with voters in Gomel Lukashenko dismissed the 
charges that he opposes the agreement on unifying the Belarusian 
monetary system with Russian. "I do not oppose it," he pointed 
out. "However the documents on unifying the two monetary systems 
are a political show, since Belarus has gained nothing from it 
in real terms, and Moscow does not want to speak with the 
Belarusian government." According to Lukashenko, "a truly 
equitable agreement with Russia can be signed only by his own 
team, if he is elected president."

Technical Committee in the Belarusian Defense Ministry, by Valer 
Kalinowski under the "Demilitarization of Belarus" rubric; place 
and date not given: "Disarmament, Like an Arms Buildup, Costs a 
Lot of Money"] 
  [Text] Belarus has been and, most likely, will remain the 
most militarized country (in terms of arms per 1,000 residents) 
in Europe. It is obvious that we do not need so many weapons. 
Yet disarmament, like an arms buildup, costs a lot of money. 
Foreign aid does not fully cover all of our expenses. When 
Belarus resolved to dismantle its nuclear weapons as well as 
shouldered the burden for disarmament within the framework of 
the Treaty on the Reduction of Conventional Armed Forces in 
Europe, it was an undoubtedly humane step that cannot be 
disputed. However, we must know how the process of 
demilitarization in Belarus is going on and what problems are 
being encountered. Our correspondent asked Vasil Puhachow, head 
of the Belarusian Defense Ministry Scientific and Technical 
Committee, to tell us about these issues. 
  [Kalinowski] How is nuclear disarmament in Belarus being 
conducted, and to what degree is it being financed by Russia? 
  [Puhachow] This is regulated by appropriate interstate 
agreements, of which the Republic of Belarus is a successor. 
These agreements determine the list of sites, while the 
schedule of withdrawal of strategic nuclear forces has been 
prepared by Belarus and Russia at the governmental level. The 
withdrawal of forces is fully financed by the Russian side. 
Russia has also obliged itself to return all cleared sites to 
appropriate environmental conditions. Some of the missiles have 
already been withdrawn. In Pastavy, for example, launch sites 
are already cleared out, but practically no rehabilitation work 
has been carried out there as of yet. Earlier, the region of 
Smarhon was a deployment site for old missile systems and SS-25 
missiles. According to an agreement, fixed structures there 
have been blown up. Naturally, blowing up the fixtures is far 
from the best way of disarming, therefore, I am not sure if it 
is possible to restore the land at that site in the future... 
Along with representatives of our National Agency for Control 
and Inspection, I was in this, now desolate, village. The 
environmental situation is not being controlled seriously by 
anybody there... Naturally, the term of withdrawal has not yet 
expired; in addition, monetary problems are plaguing both the 
Belarusian and Russian Governments... 
  [Kalinowski] You assume that Russia will withdraw its 
missiles, but the environmental problems will be left to us? 
  [Puhachow] No, I hope that Russia will meet its commitments 
and, by way of joint efforts, we will return evacuated sites to 
their proper condition. 
  [Kalinowski] Are nuclear weapons in Belarus being maintained 
in a state of combat readiness? 
  [Puhachow] Yes. There are Russian units, temporarily 
deployed on our territory, which will operate as a single organ 
until 1996-97. 
  [Kalinowski] I have heard that the Ukrainian president has 
the possibility of blocking any hypothetical launching of 
missiles from Ukrainian territory. Have we such a mechanism, 
too? 
  [Puhachow] There is an appropriate agreement on the 
intergovernmental level, which regulates the participation of 
Belarus in the resolution of any such problems. 
  [Kalinowski] Who controls the withdrawal of rocket forces 
from our side? 
  [Puhachow] The Defense Ministry has a special group in the 
National Agency for Control and Inspection to deal with this. 
The group is headed by General Major Ya.I. Nikulin. 
  [Kalinowski] Following the visit of the Pentagon chief, U.S. 
Defense Secretary W. Perry, to Belarus, there were rumors that 
Belarus will receive more U.S. aid for its demilitarization than 
other states. Is that true? 
  [Puhachow] Yes. The United States has come up with an 
initiative known as the Nunn-Lugar law (these are the names of 
U.S. senators who proposed this law) to all nuclear states of 
the former USSR. This law regulates assistance to CIS countries 
in dismantling nuclear weapons, and is seen by the United States 
as the most efficient political mechanism for achieving this 
goal. Due to the Supreme Soviet resolution on the withdrawal of 
nuclear weapons, Belarus was the first country to establish 
contacts with the United States for cooperation in the sphere of 
demilitarization. Initially, only a "framework" agreement was 
adopted on 22 October 1993, which was called "On dealing with 
consequences of disastrous situations and the prevention of 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction." Following the 
provisions of this fundamental agreement, five other documents 
were signed: 
  1. On supplies of equipment for dealing with the 
consequences of a disastrous situation, for a total of $5 
million; 
  2. On the establishment of a permanent communications line 
between Washington and Minsk (it is already established and 
operational); 
  3. An agreement on the creation of a system of export 
controls in the Republic (with an approximate cost of $10 
million); 
  4. On conversion and demilitarization, including the 
construction of housing for servicemen (as of today, 10,000 
servicemen's families are without housing); 
  5. On resolution of environmental problems in 
demilitarization -- here, the largest sum of assistance is 
expected -- $25 million. 
  The Americans are very willing to cooperate -- primarily on 
this last problem -- promising to supply necessary equipment, of 
which we are lacking -- devices for remote sounding and for 
detailed analysis of soil in areas vacated by military units. 
It is foreseen that a map of environmental pollution will be 
prepared and first-priority measures to restore these areas for 
the national economy will be worked out jointly. In particular, 
People's Deputy Volkaw is already conducting very active work to 
set up rehabilitation centers for Chernobyl children at former 
strategic military sites, which are ecologically clean. We are 
planning to cooperate on this program, in particular, in 
Pastavy... 
  [Kalinowski] My colleague, Ales Kastsen, has reported in 
ZVYAZDA on the dubious environmental conditions at this site. 
  [Puhachow] As of today, we do not have at our disposal an 
adequate estimate of the environmental situation in the 
Republic, not to mention at former military sites. At the 
beginning, one must carry out a general examination and take 
samples -- only then may we make conclusions about soil 
conditions, determine the flow of water currents, and so on. I 
think that some of your colleagues' fears may be substantiated. 
  [Kalinowski] Let us return to the agreements with the United 
States and detail what the system of export controls means. 
  [Puhachow] It concerns controls over exports of dual-purpose 
goods, or so-called critical technologies, which can be utilized 
in creating weapons of mass destruction. This is a topical 
problem. The presence of a system of export controls in a 
country is considered by the West as the first necessary element 
for including this country in the global market system. 
Therefore, the United States is willing to cooperate in this 
area. 
  [Kalinowski] How much U.S. material assistance has been 
allotted and how much of it has already been utilized? 
  [Puhachow] It is envisioned that we will receive $100 
million in 1994. However, it should be added here that the 
agreements signed by the U.S. side do not provide for some 
direct financial investment in Belarus, that is, assistance will 
be rendered in equipment, training, services... 
  [Kalinowski] By U.S. firms? 
  [Puhachow] Yes. Originally, by U.S. firms. In their turn, 
they may either hire cheap labor (for example, to build housing) 
or conclude contracts with our subcontractors. Still, the 
general contractors will be U.S. firms. True, the creation of 
U.S.- Belarusian joint ventures is not excluded. In special 
situations, for example, the environment, the possibility of 
Belarusian firms carrying out certain work financed by the 
United States has been stipulated. 
  [Kalinowski] In this way, the U.S. Government is taking care 
of not only Belarus, but also of its business interests? 
  [Puhachow] Such a strategy has been chosen. Of course, this 
is not the best version for us, because we, particularly in the 
housing sector, require purely financial means. This way, as it 
was resolved, a large percentage of allotted means will go to 
middlemen. Unfortunately, we are not able to control it for the 
time being... With regard to your question about the volume of 
U.S. assistance, which has already been realized in Belarus, the 
total sum amounts, for the time being, to 10 percent of those 
agreements concluded for last year. 
  [Kalinowski] How were these means utilized? 
  [Puhachow] For the establishment of the permanent 
communications line, supplies of equipment for dealing with 
disaster systems, the creation of the system of export control, 
and the organization of retraining centers for officers. 
  [Kalinowski] Is the U.S. assistance commensurate to our need 
for demilitarization? 
  [Puhachow] I would say that this assistance has a rather 
political nature, since $100 million, which is to be allotted to 
assist us, will not suffice to resolve even a single 
environmental problem. Demilitarization is a very complex and 
expensive process. The experience of Western firms testifies to 
the fact that the treatment of 1 cubic meter of polluted soil 
cost 700-900 German marks... Another complex problem for us is 
the detoxification of liquid rocket fuel and oxidizers. They 
must be removed from the territory of the Republic by some 
means. Russia refuses to accept such shipments. On the other 
hand, it is known that literally a spoonful of such rocket fuel 
can poison the entire water table. As of today, there is no 
other technology for utilizing toxic fuel other than burning it. 
However, burning costs a lot of money, as well. The German 
firm "Buk" has implemented a system for burning solid rocket 
fuel -- it cost hundreds of millions of marks... 
  [Kalinowski] How high are our expenses for the reduction of 
conventional arms? 
  [Puhachow] Taking into account our cheap labor force and 
certain deviations from environmental norms, experts estimate 
that the destruction of our tanks, BMP personal carriers, and 
aircraft under the Treaty on the Reduction of Armed Forces in 
Europe will cost us $33 million. 
  [Kalinowski] Excuse me, but Lithuania or Latvia have no 
tanks at all. These countries would probably like to buy them. 
Is it not better to sell our tanks to them, regardless of how 
low the price may be? 
  [Puhachow] That is a justified question. This could be 
possible if a more far-sighted policy were adopted during the 
negotiating process. However, the current agreement does not 
allow us to exceed the quota that was specified in the agreement 
on destruction. It was agreed that we would destroy them -- and 
we should do just that. An inspection commission takes into 
account only those pieces of equipment that are brought into a 
state of uselessness and cannot be updated or restored. Only 
such items are registered. There is also an agreement allowing 
us to reequip a certain number of BMP personal carriers and 
tanks for utilization in the national economy. Specialists at 
the 140th Tank Repair Plant have already prepared drafts and 
models of fire engines which are fairly effective in putting out 
forest fires. There are also projects for installing telescopic 
cranes on tank or BMP undercarriages, as well as numerous other 
ideas. However, taking into account the short service life of a 
tank engine or its "voracity," such a project cannot be 
competitive. 
  [Kalinowski] It is because they were intended to serve for 
purposes other than work. Let us leave the conversion of tanks 
and speak about the conversion of enterprises in the military 
industrial complex... 
  [Puhachow] Actually, there was never such a thing as the 
military industrial complex in Belarus. We had a number of 
enterprises -- totalling 100 -- which participated in the 
production of completing units, blocks, and elements of military 
equipment. Yet, unfortunately, we had, and still have, no 
integrated system, no complex. Due to the halt in orders for 
our products from Russia and Ukraine, as well as to the fact 
that those enterprises are incapable of satisfying the needs of 
our Army, our military industrial complex has been brought to 
such a state of crisis. Despite the fact that about 40-50 
percent of Belarusian industry had been engaged in military 
production, as of today, only 3-5 percent of the listed 
requirements of the Belarusian Army can be satisfied by our 
industry. Our country is compelled to buy completing units, 
blocks, and assemblies in Russia or Ukraine... The means that 
these purchases, unfortunately, cannot be utilized in our 
economy. 
  [Kalinowski] It seems that Belarus cannot be classified as 
an arms exporter. 
  [Puhachow] That is true. Belarus will not be an exporter of 
arms. Our Republic has never produced completed arms, and we do 
not produce them now.

<F P=106> [Report by BELINFORM correspondent Mikhail Zhuravovich for </F>
TASS] 
  [Text] Minsk, 12 May -- "The economy of Belorussia 
[Belarus] has reached the point beyond which it will find itself 
in a very deep crisis, and it will be far more difficult to get 
out of it than it is still possible to do so at present," Sergey 
Ling, the Belarusian economics minister, said in an interview 
published today in the NATIONAL ECONOMIC NEWSPAPER. According 
to him, one of the reasons behind the recession is the mass 
reciprocal nonpayments that have led to stoppages in production. 
The debts of Belarusian enterprises to the republics of the 
former USSR already exceed 1.3 trillion rubles and they 
themselves are owed 890 billion rubles. The total amount of the 
deficit is not in the Republic's favor. Sergey Ling underlined 
that "at present, there is no economic mechanism that could 
smoothly, without ruining production, regulate the problem of 
nonpayments, nor do measures exist to ensure that payments are 
made. What is happening is that a process is taking place when 
old debts are being gradually pushed to the back into the 
background. At the same, new debts are being incurred." 
  The Republic's economist also noted that Russia' is 
responsible for the lion's share of mutual nonpayments. It 
constitutes half of the total debt. That is why one can reckon 
that the treaty on the merging of the monetary systems will make 
it possible in general to take this problem off the agenda. At 
the same time, "the National Bank should react more actively to 
the situation. At present, it is spending too much time on 
criticizing others, and is adopting a duplicitous position 
regarding the unification of the monetary systems. What is 
needed here, first and foremost, is a constructive committed 
work that will make it possible to extricate the economy from 
its present situation," Sergey Ling underlined.

  [Text] The National Bank of Belarus is not in favor of 
introducing Russia's customs duties in relation to third 
countries on the territory of the republic, because Russian 
export and import rates do not take into account the 
specifications of the Belarus economy. A correspondent from a 
financial information agency has learned this from a source at 
the Belarus Parliament. 
  According to the available information, a few days ago a 
parliamentary commission for the economic reform received an 
official reply from the National Bank of Belarus on its queery 
about the bank's stance with regard to the treaty on the 
unification of the monetary systems of Belarus and the Russian 
Federation, signed by the prime ministers of the two countries 
on 12 April in Moscow. The official reply makes it clear that 
the National Bank is critical of the treaty and believes that 
the gain from lifting customs duties is minimal in comparison 
with the burden of maintaining Russian strategic forces deployed 
on the territory of Belarus, which will fall on the Belarus 
state budget.

  [Text] The working meeting of the Belarusian Supreme Soviet 
commission for planning, budget, and finances has addressed the 
issue of noncash accounts between enterprises. Representatives 
of the Belarusian National Bank, the Ministry of Finances, the 
High Economic Court, and the Cabinet of Ministers participated 
in its work. The experts emphasized that given the recent 
economic slump, the breakdown of monetary and credit policies, 
the process of trading in [products] and balancing mutual 
accounts between suppliers and consumers has considerably 
exacerbated. As a result of inadequate finances, working 
capital is slow to be replenished. Debts for gas, electricity, 
and thermal energy are growing. Though current legislation 
regulates mutual accounts between economic sectors rather 
efficiently, some legal acts, particularly Clause No. 16 of the 
Law on the National Bank of Belarus, must be supplemented. The 
commission adopted a decision to discuss this issue at the 
session of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet and the Supreme 
Soviet session; to repeal and declare a range of legislative 
acts -- formulating economic pressure on enterprises -- as no 
longer effective; to task the Belarusian National Bank with 
determining the amount and mechanism for applying economic 
sanctions when balancing the noncash accounts of those who 
violate the law.

  [Text] The building of the first waste processing facilites 
dealing with the treatment of solid household and industrial 
nontoxic waste was begun in the village of Barba, Vetkovskiy 
Rayon, Gomel Oblast. Construction is to be completed by late 
(?1994). Then, this processing complex will begin treating the 
waste from Gomel enterprises. The cost of construction is 
covered by some 100 Gomel enterprises with which the Gomel 
Executive Commission signed agreements on sharing expenditures 
for this project. Gomel authorities had to make this decision 
when Dorofeeva, chairman of the State Committee for Ecology, and 
the Belarusian Government refused to earmark financial 
assistance to them. According to Alyaksandr Titov, chairman of 
the Gomel Office for Ecology and Radiological Security, he does 
not understand why the State Committee for Ecology does not use 
this unique occasion to work out the technology of construction 
and operation of this complex to eventually free the city from 
dumping grounds.

  [Text] Magadan Oblast gold, coal, power, and transport 
industry leaders made an effort to reach agreement among 
themselves. They have signed an economic agreement freezing 
prices on the goods and services that each produces. It is 
presumed that this measure will enable them to hold down the 
growth of expenditures on Magadan Oblast's basic end product -- 
gold. 
  Kolyma gold may have become the most expensive in the world, 
and that means, not competitive. The governor of Magadan Oblast 
is convinced that other Far East territories, whose products 
cannot find a market either in Russia or abroad due to pricing 
distortions, should take similar steps. It is difficult to 
forecast the effectiveness of the Magadan agreement, because it 
is doubtful that order can be restored in one isolated oblast at 
a time of general economic anarchy and helplessness.

<F P=106> [Sergey Smirnov report: "Ubozhko Wants to Ride Into The </F>
Kremlin on a Tractor"] 
  [Text] Chelyabinsk -- There are 13 contenders for the last 
two Russian Federation Council seats in Chelyabinsk. 
  Last December there was a whole host of politicians trying 
to 
fight their way into the Duma. It was packed here -- the 
candidates had to push and shove -- but when it came to the 
Federation Council the elections were null and void -- no one 
wanted to run! 
  Now, however, there are 13 contenders for the last two seats 
in Russia. An ominous number. But the "temporarily nonworking" 
ex-general V. Varennikov probably is not superstitious about 
such things. He has visited Chelyabinsk twice. He addressed 
the public who, as the local newspapers reported, greeted his 
speeches with applause and shouts of approval. 
  All sorts of people are being attracted to Chelyabinsk 
Oblast. General Makashov was here on the eve of the presidential 
elections. Zhirinovskiy perorated from atop a tractor at the 
Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant. Federation Council contender Lev 
Ubozhko, chairman of the Conservative Party of Russia, did not 
give a fig for this Zhirinovskiy: "When I speak, there will be 
nothing that that...can do!" As a politician he rates himself 
above Zhirinovskiy and as for Yeltsin -- even more so. Lev the 
Terrible! 
  The oblast administration, it seems to me, is watching these 
elections with a certain unease. All last year Vadim Solovyev, 
the head of the administration fought the oblast Soviet (or 
rather the Soviet fought him). After the putsch the deputies 
were turfed out and a lull ensued. But the apparatus settled 
down into the comfortable, well paid jobs. Where the means 
exist the ends are not hard to achieve. The opposition has been 
biding its time in the shadows but has been very actively 
promoting its candidates into a place in the sun. Who knows how 
the Federation Council deputies will behave toward the 
administration? The Duma deputies, for example, have already 
brought up the big guns -- a commission from the Russian 
president's apparatus has already come for a heart to heart talk 
with Solovyev. 
  The only calm people here are surely the voters. Calm with 
regard to the elections, of course. And keeping your cool when 
whole districts are without water and the city is up to its ears 
in garbage is no easy matter. Hardly anything is going to 
change after the elections either.

<F P=106> [Article by Alla Prozorova, kray administration press </F>
service: "Are the New Power Rates That Terrible?"] 
  [Text] Contrary to the opinion that has set in--not 
without help from the mass media--the Maritime Kray economy is 
currently being strangled by factors other than electric power 
rates. This thesis was advanced yesterday by kray Vice Governor 
Sergey Demin in response to rumors circulating in the kray 
regarding the expected increase in electric power and heat rates. 
  As proof he showed the percentage of January-March 
expenditures on electric power in the totality of components 
comprising the production cost at major kray enterprises. The 
Bor Association--7.7- 8.5 percent. The Khrustalninsk Tin 
Production Joint-Stock Company-- 5.9-9.5 percent. The 
Slavyanskiy Ship-Repair Plant--3.6-9.6 percent. The Ussuri 
Locomotive Repair Plant--1.72-1.38 percent. The figures show 
eloquently, said the vice governor, that what is ruining the 
economy is the other "flank." That is, first, high taxes--most 
of them federal, as the president of the Russian Federation said 
in his message to the Federal Assembly "On Strengthening the 
Russian State." Second, the wages paid by an enterprise that 
respects its workers. Since the mandatory minimum wage of 14,632 
rubles [R] cannot be qualified as respect for labor (and this is 
the figure built into the labor remuneration fund), the 
enterprises are compelled to take the necessary extra 
remuneration out of the profit part, which is subject to 
additional tax on profit. And third, rail transportation rates 
that are too high. 
  In the latter case, a closed-loop circle of financial 
problems analogous to that in other sectors is at work. 
Therefore, the most likely solution lies in reducing the tax 
burden imposed by the government on producer enterprises, and 
correspondingly, increasing output. 
  "So far, I have not seen," said Sergey Demin, "any 
government 
documents on the subject of repealing a certain decree, No. 
1001. There is a document on procedures for forming rates, which 
gives the regions the right to set them. The kray administration 
will do its best the keep down as much as possible electric 
power rate increases. But objectively, as in the rest of the 
world, this is very difficult to achieve, since prices for 
components--fuel, materials, and transportation--change." 
  Elaborating on the trends, Sergey Demin recalled that in 
keeping with Decree No. 1001, subsidies for Maritime Kray to 
deal with the energy problems were set at R17 billion in 1993. 
Over the winter the kray managed to add to this amount another 
R111 billion (a total of R128 billion). This money permitted us 
to "survive" until spring. Because Maritime Kray enterprises owe 
the energy sector more than R200 billion for electric power and 
more than R100 billion for heat. So, despite the share of 
electric power costs not exceeding 6-12 percent of production 
costs, enterprises do not pay energy suppliers for months. This 
situation will lead to a catastrophe within the next five-six 
months: The kray will not be ready to ensure the supply of heat 
for itself by the 1994-95 winter season.

  [Text] Tallinn, 12 May, BNS -- Estonian Foreign Minister 
Juri Luik attended on Wednesday [11 May] a session of the 
Council of Europe [CE] committee of ministers in Strasbourg. At 
the top of the agenda were expansion of the Council of Europe 
and the CE Vienna declaration on combating anti-Semitism, racism 
and other manifestations of intolerance. 
  Foreign Ministry spokesman Juri Arusoo told BNS that most 
representatives from the CE member states underscored that 
Russia, in order to become a full member of the CE, must 
withdraw its troops from Estonia and Latvia. Arusoo said the 
participants affirmed no exceptions in admission to the CE can 
be made for Russia. 
  Luik emphasized in his address that Russia, to gain full 
membership in the CE, must pull out its troops from the Estonian 
territory, abandon the "near abroad" concept in its foreign 
policy, and give an unequivocal assessment to the events in 
Estonia in 1940. 
  The session discussed the Vienna declaration that was 
adopted 
by the October meeting of the CE member states' heads of state 
and government. 
  Luik signed on Wednesday in Strasbourg the 11th protocol of 
the European Convention on Human Rights, which introduces some 
amendments in the mechanism that controls the implementation of 
the convention. 
  The protocol foresees the formation of a permanent European 
Court of Human Rights to interpret the convention. The court 
will accept petitions about human rights violations from 
individuals, groups of people, and states. 
  The signed protocol comes into force from the moment of 
ratification. The Estonian parliament also has to ratify the 
human rights convention and ten other protocols pertaining to it.

  [Text] Russian Navy Baltic Fleet Commander Vladimir Yegorov 
failed to arrive in Estonia today in order to supervise Russian 
troop withdrawal. The plane carrying Yegorov and a group of 
officers was refused landing in the Amari airport which remains 
in the disposition of the Russian Armed Forces. 
  Estonian Foreign Ministry Press Secretary Mari-Ann Rikken 
told Interfax that the appropriate notification had been 
transmitted by the Russian Embassy in Tallinn only two days 
before. She underlined that the internationally accepted norms 
demanded at least fifteen days for consideration. No 
information on the officers accompanying Yegorov had been given. 
Rikken said this had made impossible to authorize them to come 
to Estonia. 
  However, Russian Military Attache in Estonia Anatoliy 
Chizhikov told Interfax that Russia and Estonia had an agreement 
giving five days for consideration of notifications on landing 
of military jets, although such issues were as a rule resolved 
within one or two days. Chizhikov pointed out that the Russian 
Embassy had received no clarification on new terms for 
consideration of such notifications and refused to comment on 
the decision by the Estonian Foreign Ministry.

  [Text] Tallinn, 12 May, BNS -- The Russian side has still 
not announced the date when the dismantling of the nuclear 
reactors in the former Russian naval base in Paldiski is to 
begin, Juri Tikk, the special representative of the government 
in Paldiski, told BNS. 
  Justice Minister Kaido Kama told BNS early in May that the 
dismantling will probably start on 15 May. In accordance with 
the agreed procedure, Russia is supposed to inform the Estonian 
authorities of the starting date a week in advance. Tikk 
declined to confirm or deny the operation going ahead on 15 May. 
  Tikk claimed both parties are prepared to immediately begin 
the dismantling of the reactors. He said, however, that the two 
containers for the removed nuclear fuel have not yet reached 
Paldiski. Still, it is not clear why the Russian side keeps 
putting off the operation, Tikk told BNS. 
  The government allocated earlier this month 1.4 million 
kroons to cover the expenses of the dismantling. Kama said a 
large share of the sum comes from foreign aid contributions made 
specifically for the purpose. 
  A special ministerial commission was formed at the end of 
April to monitor and regulate the removal of the nuclear 
reactors from Paldiski. Earlier the same month the Cabinet 
ruled to enforce a special regime in the Pakri peninsula where 
Paldiski is located for the duration of the dismantling. Also, 
a special rescue unit was formed to ensure safety of the 
operation.

  [Text] Tallinn, May 12, BNS -- The broadcasting bill that 
passed Wednesday [11 May] the second reading in the parliament 
allows the state-owned Estonian Radio and Estonian Television to 
include advertising in their broadcasts. 
  Under the bill, advertisements may amount to five percent of 
the daily broadcasts over one Estonian-language and one 
Russian-language radio channel. 
  Private radio and TV stations are allowed to spend 20 
percent 
of their airtime on advertising. Tiit Sinissaar, chairman of 
the Pro Patria parliamentary faction, therefore voiced the 
opinion that granting state radio and TV permission to 
advertising broadcasts does not affect the activity of private 
stations. 
  The legislators carried Wednesday a motion stipulating that 
Estonian Radio and Estonian Television are independent legal 
persons which jointly administer the radio and TV broadcasting 
center. The motion put forward by the Liberal faction, under 
which the radio, the television and the broadcasting center 
would form one single organization, found no support in the 
parliament. 
  The motion to include a "principle of political balance" in 
the broadcasting law was also rejected. According to the 
proposal, a radio or TV station, which allows airtime to a 
political party, should give other parties at their request the 
same amount of time on the air. 
  Sinissaar told reporters it would at present be impossible 
to 
observe such a principle of balance. 
  "We have about a score of competing political parties and if 
this principle was implemented dividing airtime between parties 
would be the principal occupation of the radio and TV stations," 
he said.

  [Text] President Guntis Ulmanis met with Russian Ambassador 
Aleksandr Rannikh today. The Russian ambassador came at the 
president's invitation to discuss relations between the two 
countries. The Latvian president's letter to Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin was submitted to the ambassador. 
  Speaking of progress in implementing the Latvian-Russian 
agreements, Rannikh was concerned about Latvia's insufficient 
practical work in the area of the Skrunda new radar station. 
The Russian ambassador also told the president that at the 
beginning of June the last Russian Navy warship will leave 
Liepaja port and thus the Russian Navy will have completely left 
Latvia. 
  During the talks the opinion was expressed that the Latvian 
and Russian executive powers must act more responsibly and 
energetically so that the scheduled visit by Russian Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to Latvia can take place by the end 
of May. 
  Both the president and the ambassador assessed Latvia's 
recent joining of the Western European Union as an associate 
partner as a big success by Latvian diplomacy. Rannikh said 
that this event is evidence of the unified support by Europe and 
the Western European Union, which is an institution of European 
security, for the package of Latvian-Russia agreements signed in 
Moscow.

  Ulmanis handed the letter over to Russian Ambassador

Latvian- Russian relations. 
  Rannikh voiced his concern over "insufficient Latvian

president's office told BNS. 
  The ambassador told Ulmanis that the last Russian warship 
would leave the Liepaja seaport early in July, thus, marking the 
complete withdrawal of Russian naval forces from Latvia. 
  The officials pointed out that Latvian and Russian executive 
institutions should act more responsibly and energetically to 
allow for Russian Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin's visit to 
Latvia later this month. 
  Ulmanis and Rannikh also assessed the recent Latvian joining 
to the Western European Union [WEU] in the status of "associate 
partner" as a major achievement of the Latvian diplomacy. 
  Rannikh claims that the event confirms the unanimous WEU and 
European Union's backing to the signed package of

  [Excerpts] Riga, 12 May (LETA) -- "It was the first 
official visit of a representative from independent Latvia both 
to South Africa and the African continent," said the Saeima's 
[parliament] chairman, Anatolijs Gorbunovs, on his arrival in 
Riga from South Africa on Wednesday [11 May]. He participated 
in the inauguration ceremony of the first black president, 
Nelson Mandela. [passage omitted] 
  Speaking of his meeting with the South Africa's new 
president, Nelson Mandela, the Latvian speaker stressed that Mr. 
Mandela is energetic and has a great deal of ideas. However, 
Mr. Gorbunovs, declined to speculate on the development of the 
events in this African country, because relations between the 
black and white remain tense there. Mr. Gorbunovs drew a 
parallel between Mr. Mandela and Mikhail Gorbachev, who led 
Russia to democracy and was deprived of his post of the 
president because of the political struggle in the USSR.

<F P=106> [Yevgeniy Bovkun and Boris Vinogradov report: "Boris </F>
Yeltsin Believes Helmut Kohl, Who Promises That Germany Will Not 
Turn Its Back on Russia When Its Troops Leave"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- The Russian president and the FRG 
chancellor have eliminated with surprising ease the 
misunderstandings over the Russian troops' withdrawal procedure: 
The send-off will take place in Berlin 31 August, without the 
allies. They will leave, as agreed earlier, in September. 
There will be a meeting of the two countries' cultural figures 
in Weimar. The annoying incident in bilateral relations is 
considered closed. As Boris Yeltsin said, his friend Helmut 
Kohl detected the mood of the guest from Moscow and of the 
Russian public in his first sentence. Sacrificing election 
considerations, Helmut Kohl found within himself the courage to 
abandon in time a procedure that was humiliating for the Russian 
Army. 
  General Matvey Burlakov, commander of the Western Group of 
Forces, declared with relief that "it is even simpler" to leave 
separately [ukhodit po otdelnosti]. 
  Boris Yeltsin proposed appending the final period mark to 
the 
past at the conference of heads of state and government of the 
CSCE countries which will be held in Budapest in December. In 
the president's opinion, new principles of an international 
structure for the year 2000 must be formulated there. The 50th 
anniversary of the end of World War II can also be a suitable 
moment for the collective drawing of a line under the past. 
  Military topics were thereby virtually exhausted in the 
talks. The establishment of Russia's closer relationship with 
NATO was postponed to a future date. Helmut Kohl confirmed the 
FRG's fidelity to the "partnership for peace" concept. 
President Yeltsin replied that he cannot sign this document 
until the Russian side has drawn up and agreed an additional 
protocol taking into account the special features of the 
3-million-strong army with its unique armament, which not one 
Western state possesses. 
  A protocol amending the "partnership for peace" concept for 
Russia's part will start to be prepared within the next few 
days. German commentators point out that Russia is increasingly 
confidently declaring its geopolitical interests and the need to 
reckon with it as a great power. Kohl, incidentally, did not 
stint epithets when recalling Russia's greatness and its 
historical role in Europe's development. 
  To all appearances, Moscow diplomats still do not know which 
way Germany will go after it has seen off the last Russian 
soldier. Will its desire to support the Russian reforms not 
cool, preferring closer and more reliable partners in the West? 
Much attests that it is already pretty tired of being one of 
Moscow's most active and generous helpers. Boris Yeltsin 
believes in the chancellor's decency and political experience 
and considers him the guarantor of a further strengthening of 
bilateral ties. But what if another chancellor accedes to power 
here in November, after the Bundestag elections? 
  In conclusion, about the work of the Russian officials who 
organized the visit. They operated in the best traditions of 
the stagnation period. On a directive from the Russian Embassy 
the texts of Boris Yeltsin's after-dinner speeches were kept in 
the press center's desk practically until the need for them had 
evaporated. On the eve of the news conference the press service 
not only decided who would put questions to the president and 
the chancellor but also thought up these questions itself. In 
the space of some two years, if you recall his previous visit to 
the FRG, the president has been clothed in impenetrable 
bureaucratic armor.

<F P=106> [Pavel Shinkarenko report under the "Visits" rubric: "Peace </F>
in Europe Depends Not Only on Russia and Germany. But Their 
Good Relations Will Help To Create an All-European Security 
System"] 
  [Text] Boris Yeltsin began the second day of his official 
visit to the FRG by meeting with Rudolf Scharping, chairman of 
the Social Democratic Party of Germany. The conversation took 
place in the Petersberg Palace, where the Russian president was 
staying, and was of the nature of personal contacts between two 
political leaders. After this Boris Yeltsin visited the cities 
of Dadeyskhaym [name as transliterated] and Oggersheim and 
called at the private home of Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl. 
According to the diplomats who prepared the program of the 
visit, the visit to the German chancellor's home places was a 
response to last year's trip to Lake Baykal by Boris Yeltsin and 
Helmut Kohl. It is believed at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
that such meetings between the leaders "deep inside the two 
states" help to better understand the spirit of both countries 
and peoples and to strengthen mutual trust. 
  But even having left the capital, the leaders did not, I 
believe, stop the dialogue begun in the previous day's official 
talks. Although a great deal had already been done on 
Wednesday. One of the most delicate tasks was safely resolved -- 
that of the venue for the ceremony marking the final withdrawal 
of the Russian troops from German territory: It will take place 
in Berlin 31 August, as Moscow had been insisting, and not in 
Weimar, as proposed by Bonn. "The war ended in Berlin, so what 
question can there be of Weimar?" Colonel General Matvey 
Burlakov, commander in chief of the Western Group of Forces, 
explained our position. "Since it is a question of eliminating 
the consequences of the war, the ceremony must be held in 
Berlin." The Germans, as we see, have conceded. "My aim," 
Helmut Kohl declared for his part, "is to ensure that the 
Russian servicemen's send-off is worthy and respectful and is 
conducted in a spirit of friendship." 
  Despite its complexity, the subject of the Russian troops' 
send-off did not dominate the talks which the Russian Federation 
president had with the German leaders. A very wide range of 
questions of interaction and cooperation between Russia and the 
FRG was discussed during the conversation with President Richard 
von Weizsaecker, in the confidential conversations with Helmut 
Kohl, and in the enlarged meetings of the two delegations (the 
Russian Federation president was accompanied by Vice Premier 
Aleksandr Shokhin, Ministers Andrey Kozyrev, Pavel Grachev, and 
Yevgeniy Sidorov, and also Vladislav Terekhov, Russian 
Federation ambassador to Bonn). 
  As soon as the Russian president's aircraft arrived at 
Bonn/Cologne Airport from Moscow Wednesday morning, Boris 
Yeltsin made it clear that the visit was of a "planned nature." 
He said that 38 major joint projects have been prepared during 
the two years since his previous visit to Bonn. "The time has 
come to audit the way they are being implemented and also to 
discuss some 20 future joint projects," he remarked. 
  Boris Yeltsin and Helmut Kohl confirmed yet again that 
Russia 
and Germany regard each other as equal partners, on the state of 
whose relations the fate of European and world politics largely 
depends. At the same time the Russian Federation president 
emphasized that the ensuring of peace throughout the European 
continent depends not only on bilateral relations between the 
FRG and Russia. But the fact that the two greatest states on 
the continent can reach agreement on complex problems attests 
that it will also be easier to work with other countries in 
order to have a unified security system in Europe. 
  One element of it could be Russia's joining the 
"Partnership for Peace" program. To judge from Boris Yeltsin's 
statement, Moscow agrees with this NATO initiative in principle. 
But Russia cannot sign this document without a special protocol. 
"There must be one more document, which would stipulate specific 
questions concerning Russia's special features, including, for 
example, the fact that we have an army of 3 million men," he 
said. 
  This position is obviously shared by Bonn also. Moreover, 
acknowledging Russia's status as a great power, the FRG is 
sincerely interested in the success of the democratic and market 
reforms being implemented by its leadership and is prepared to 
continue giving it what support it can to surmount the present 
difficulties, as well as for further integration into the 
international community. Chancellor Kohl welcomed, in 
particular, the idea of turning the "G-7" into the "G-8" by 
means of including Russia. This question will be discussed, he 
said, in Naples at the meeting of the heads of the seven most 
developed industrial countries scheduled for July, and Germany 
will promote Russia's integration into international 
organizations in every possible way. "Any other development 
would be disastrous," Helmut Kohl emphasized. 
  Another complex topic of the dialogue in Bonn was the 
problem 
of the return of cultural assets lost by both countries as a 
result of World War II. The work of the commission set up by 
the two countries' Ministries of Culture has not yet produced 
results. An accord has now been reached that in the future this 
commission will work to a rigid schedule approved personally by 
the leaders of both countries. But we do not intend to 
interfere in the commission's work. Let professionals make the 
decisions, Boris Yeltsin remarked. 
  Today is the final day of the visit. Boris Yeltsin will 
spend it in Stuttgart, one of Germany's major industrial and 
cultural centers.

  [Text] Bonn May 13 TASS -- German Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel told the Russian president on Friday that Germany is 
ready to promote Russian integration into European organisations. 
  "We have stated our readiness to help Russia in its joining 
all European structures which are important for it at present -- 
the Council of Europe, GATT. We also intend to support your 
country in joining the trade regime, which will be set up after 
the elimination of Cocom [Coordinating Committee for 
Multilateral Export Control], and surely, (in joining) the 
`Partnership for Peace'", he told reporters describing his talk 
with Boris Yeltsin. 
  The problem of mutual restitution of cultural valuables 
seized during the Second World War was also raised. "We 
understand the delicacy with which the Russian side treats the 
issue. But I once again drew the attention of the president to 
the great importance of the problem for us", Kinkel told TASS.

  [Text] Bonn May 13 TASS -- Russia wants to repay its debt 
to Germany with MiG-29 fighter planes and is ready to ship them 
immediately if Bonn agrees, according to Russian Economics 
Minister Aleksandr Shokhin. 
  "If Germany takes MiG-29 planes we are ready to ship them", 
he told TASS on Friday and quoted President Boris Yeltsin as 
saying that "if necessary hundreds of fighters will arrive at 
local (German) airports in two days". 
  Shokhin added that one major project has been practically 
agreed upon during the visit of the Russian president to 
Germany. Bonn is to grant Russia a 500-million mark easy-term 
credit for buying railway cars produced in former east Germany. 
  Shokhin explained that it was impossible for Russia to 
manage 
the deal without the easy-term credit. Early this year Russia 
informed Bonn that the problem of shipping railway cars to 
Russia was irresolvable without privileged terms. The German 
Government met the Russian request although it was fraught with 
a certain confrontation with the Organisation of Economic 
Cooperation and Development, Shokhin said. 
  This is a 10-year easy-term credit granted under government 
guarantees, Shokhin said and added that the terms are suitable 
for Russia and will not negatively affect its budget deficit.

  [Text] Responding to a question from a NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA 
correspondent, Russian Federation Culture Minister Mikhail 
Shvydkoy stated that "according to Culture Ministry 
information," the Russian president had set off for talks with 
Chancellor Kohl bringing along none of the books and other 
valuable objects in the so-called restitution category, or in 
other words, those taken to the USSR from the territory of 
Germany during the war and during the early post-war years. 
Hence the rumors about Boris Yeltsin's making a gift to the 
German side of the world-famous rarity -- the Gutenberg Bible -- 
are just rumors. But, alternative sources report, books from 
the Gotha Library may still be delivered to Germany toward the 
visit's end.

  [Text] Moscow May 12 TASS--In reply to Russian press 
reports on difficulties in bilateral trade, which had allegedly 
arisen through the fault of the German side, the FRG Embassy in 
Moscow has asked BUSINESS-TASS to publish its press statement, 
explaining the German view on this question. 
  The document notes, specifically, that, taking into account 
the new German federal lands' difficult adaptation to the market 
economy, the members of the Organisation for Economic 
Cooperation and Development (OECD) had agreed to grant Germany 
easy terms for crediting export trade during the transition 
period. Such credit guarantees were issued to the sum of 8.2 
billion German marks in the period from 1992 to 1993. This 
meant that German companies could export their goods to Russia 
while payment for such deliveries was guaranteed on easy terms, 
within the limits of the indicated sum, by the "Hermes 
Kredit-Versicherungds-Ag" company. 
  The point is that the German Government does not handle 
administrative and technical matters linked with the insurance 
of export credits. This job is entrusted to the foregoing 
private firm, but decisions to grant credits are made by four 
ministries: the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economics, 
the Foreign Ministry, and the Ministry for Economic Cooperation. 
  The embassy's statement points out that the conclusion of 
many contracts with Russian firms on the basis of the above-said 
preferential guarantees was delayed for different reasons and 
now they can no longer be applied, because the preferences were 
annulled beginning from January 1, 1994. The authors of the 
statement claim that the Russian side was notified about all 
this in advance. 
  Nevertheless, export guarantees for goods delivered to 
Russia 
are still being granted, but now on general terms, corresponding 
to the international practice and on agreement with credit 
insurers within the OECD. For instance, advance and 
intermediate payments, amounting to no less than 15 per cent of 
the total cost of the deal, have to be made if it is financed 
for a term of over 360 days. No preferential period is 
envisaged. 
  Therefore, the statement of the FRG Embassy notes, there is 
no deterioration of crediting terms, simply the period for 
granting temporary preferences has expired.

<F P=106> [Ravil Zaripov and Igor Yavlyanskiy report under the </F>
"Visits" rubric: "Final Parade Imminent"] 
  [Excerpt] Bonn -- You will not believe it but Yeltsin 
brought good weather with him to the banks of the Rhine. As the 
government airplane approached the Bonn-Cologne airport, the fog 
which until then had formed a thick shroud over the 
Siebengebirge drifted off somewhere. 
  Boris Nikolayevich alighted from the airplane when the sky 
had already cleared and a gentle sun was shining. We, of 
course, are no experts in physiognomy but will make so bold as 
to assert that the Russian president stepped onto German soil in 
a good frame of mind. He even found an opportunity to give a 
short interview by the steps of the airplane, though this was 
not stipulated by the protocol. 
  "I want to sum up with my friend Helmut the results of the 
two-year period since my last official visit to Bonn. We will 
discuss -- what is more for the final time -- the arrangements 
for withdrawing our troops from the FRG. Right down to the last 
soldier. We intend to firmly insist that the celebratory 
ceremony be held in Berlin." 
  Matvey Burlakov, commander of the Western Group of Forces, 
is 
one of those who intend to insist to the end that Berlin is the 
location. In addition to the arguments which have already been 
presented, he added his own simplehearted soldier's argument: 
"But 31 August (the completion date for our troops' withdrawal) 
is a working day in Germany. Who will we have to take our leave 
of? It is necessary to organize the send-off on a nonworking 
day so that people come. It would be desirable to hold a 
meeting in the Reichstag." 
  During the current visit, the heads of state will not sign 
agreements and protocols. The only exception that has been made 
is for the so-called "red" telephone -- the direct link between 
the Kremlin and the Federal Chancellery. Foreign Ministers 
Andrey Kozyrev and Klaus Kinkel will confirm its right to exist 
by adding their signatures. 
  Informed sources in the FRG Ministry of Foreign Affairs tell 
us that the German leadership views this visit as an opportunity 
to give Boris Nikolayevich "moral support." Bonn officials will 
do all they can to make the high-ranking Russian guest feel that 
he is head of a great power. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Leonid Vorontsov] </F>
  [Text] Berlin, 12 May -- A detailed scenario for the 
farewell ceremony for the Russian forces leaving Germany will be 
drawn up by the end of this week and presented to President 
Boris Yeltsin and Helmut Kohl for final agreement, Pavel 
Grachev, the Russian defense minister told the ITAR-TASS 
correspondent. The defense minister arrived today at the 
Western Group of Russian Forces, where he will spend two days 
getting himself acquainted with the progress in the preparations 
for the farewell ceremony, and will discuss the details of the 
final stage of the event with the group's commanding officers. 
  Pavel Grachev pointed out that "the only right decision" was 
made yesterday at the highest level concerning the farewell 
ceremony for the Russian forces in Berlin, with the Russian 
president and the German chancellor attending. "Now it is our 
turn to get down to business" -- the Russian defense minister 
said. 
  Pavel Grachev said that the main political outcome of 
yesterday's Russian-German summit was that the leaders of two 
major European countries had confirmed their striving for closer 
cooperation not only in bilateral relations but also in ensuring 
security throughout the continent. 
  Replying to a question on Russia's concept for relations 
within the framework of NATO's "Partnership for Peace" program, 
the defense minister said that thorough preparation work is 
continuing on the Russian concept. After it is agreed on by the 
Russian Federation Security Council and the Russian president, 
Pavel Grachev will present it to Brussels on 24 May. In 
connection with this he noted that it is a question not of an 
"alternative" document but only of Russia presenting its views 
as a great power on its role and place in the "Partnership for 
Peace" program. 
  The defense minister recalled that Boris Yeltsin stated in 
Bonn yesterday that an agreement on this program was reached in 
principle and that readiness was expressed to join the programme 
after Russia's views are presented and it's role in this program 
defined.

  [Text] [Begin recording] [Correspondent] Yeltsin and Kohl 
reached a decision on the sendoff ceremony for Russian troops in 
Berlin. [Video shows Defense Minister Pavel Grachev being 
interviewed] 
  Pavel Sergeyevich, now that the president and the chancellor 
have reached agreement on holding the ceremony in Berlin, can we 
say that all the problems connected with withdrawing our troops 
from Germany have been settled? 
  [Grachev] You cannot say that all the problems connected 
with 
withdrawing our troops have been settled. The fact is there are 
fundamental political decisions by the chancellor and our 
president. The ceremonial sendoff of the troops will take place 
from Berlin. Now the onus is on us. 
  [Correspondent] There were plenty of discussions in the 
German press about the Russian military insisting, I emphasize 
insisting, that the ceremonial sendoff be with the Allies. In 
order for there not to be any misunderstanding here, perhaps you 
could comment on this. 
  [Grachev] This is really a misunderstanding. I do not want 
to say that this is some sort of provocation, provocative 
questions; no, this is purely and simply a misunderstanding. 
We were not insisting, we were not even suggesting that the 
withdrawal should be organized together and simultaneously with 
the Allies. The timescale was laid down a long time ago. [end

  [Text] Bryansk May 13 TASS -- "Russia cannot be made a 
training ground for the American Army," Russian Federation 
Security and Defence Committee Chairman Pyotr Shirshov said in 
an interview with ITAR-TASS. 
  Commenting on forthcoming joint Russian-American exercises 
to 
be organized on the Totsk training ground in the Orenburg 
region, Shirshov said that for organizing such an arrangement at 
first a legal procedure must be devised. "We do not have any 
laws, in compliance with which foreign troops could be invited 
to Russia," deputy to the Federal Assembly from Bryansk said. 
  Regarding the possiblity of Russia's participation in NATO's 
"Partnership for Peace" programme, Pyotr Shirshov called it a 
"danger for Russia". In his opinion, by participating in this 
programme Russia does not gain anything from the point of view 
of any access to NATO strategies and workings, and 
simultaneously, the Russian Army "becomes transparent to the 
North Atlantic bloc."

ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI: "`Aspen Dialogue' Demonstrates Divergences 
of Views"] 
  [Text] Russia and the United States are leaving behind the 
romantic period in their relations begun by M. Gorbachev and 
continued by B. Yeltsin. Nowadays the representatives of our 
and the U.S. establishment hold diametrically opposed viewpoints 
on the majority of Russia's foreign and domestic policy 
questions. These divergences were also demonstrated by the 
Aspen Dialogue, a Russian-U.S. forum which took place in Sochi 
1-6 May. This was the fifth in the series of dialogues, which 
was launched in August 1991 by the International Association of 
Enterprise Directors [IAED] headed by Konstantin Zatulin -- now 
chairman of the State Duma Committee for CIS Affairs and 
Relations with Fellow Countrymen -- and the International Center 
for Civil Administration (United States) in Aspen, Colorado. 
  The Americans, who included prominent figures from the 
Department of State, politicians, and political scientists -- 
inquired during the forum primarily about the new Russian 
realities and expressed misgivings about a return to 
authoritarianism in Russia. The case made by Presidential 
Council Member Andranik Migranyan that the suprapresidential 
powers given to Boris Yeltsin by the new Constitution will make 
it possible to consolidate the democratic transformations in 
Russia produced a cautious reaction by members of the U.S. 
delegation. They asked: "Is there a hope that the present 
enlightened authoritarianism in Russia will create democratic 
institutions, which will continue operating after 1996?" And 
they added that the Americans feel skeptical about autocracy as 
a means of promoting democracy. 
  Furthermore, Greg Guroff, director of the Department of 
State's World Development Agency, stated that the "U.S. press" 
and people no longer love Yeltsin as much as they used to and 
that there will be no repetition of the U.S. politicians' 
support for actions similar to the storming of the White House 
in Moscow. 
  The opinion of IAED President Mark Masarskiy was listened to 
with interest in this debate. He believes that "the 
regionalization of the economy and the federalization of the 
state will hinder a return to authoritarianism in Russia." In 
his opinion, the mere fact of the two-tier [dvukhkanalnyy] tax 
system will not allow the federal center to concentrate 
financial resources in its hands and without those resources 
power is not power at all. 
  There was an equally keen exchange of opinions on mutual 
relations between the two great powers. "U.S. policy toward 
Russia is one of temporizing and indifference" -- that position 
was expressed by Academician Aleksandr Yakovlev, well known in 
the United States as the number two man after Gorbachev, who 
helped to bring down totalitarianism across one-sixth of the 
globe's surface. Aleksandr Yakovlev is convinced that the 
United States carried out the Marshall Plan to revive West 
Europe after World War II solely because that plan was a 
continuation of its victory. But for the United States the 
revolution of the 1980's and 1990's in Russia was "alien." 
Whereas billions of dollars were spent on the Marshall Plan, 
nothing has been spent on aid to Russia. "Indeed, there is no 
need to," Aleksandr Yakovlev declared. However, the academician 
also noted with regret that in the United States there is no 
understanding of the fact that "the reform of Russia is of 
worldwide significance, especially for the creation of a 
postconfrontational situation." From that viewpoint, he 
believes, it would be wise for the United States and the Western 
powers to assist Russia's entry into the world community because 
that process is also proving very difficult. 
  The U.S. delegates to the forum agreed that their country 
does not have a clear policy toward Russia or a clear picture of 
what is going on in our country. That was demonstrated by a 
movie about Russia which David Shipler, a U.S. journalist who 
for many years was THE NEW YORK TIMES Moscow correspondent, 
brought to Sochi. Presented as an "intellectual product," this 
movie was, in the opinion of the Russian participants in the 
forum, a superficial reportage which did not reflect the essence 
of the Russian political process even in the slightest. 
  The participants in the Aspen Dialogue displayed a mutual 
lack of understanding about the future of the CIS as well. When 
the Russian politicians, in particular Konstantin Zatulin, 
chairman of the State Duma Committee for CIS Affairs and 
Relations with Fellow Countrymen, explained to the participants 
in the forum that Russia cannot leave the 25 million Russian 
speakers living in the neighboring foreign countries to the whim 
of fate, the Americans immediately countered that by saying: 
"Does that mean that the United States must bear the 
responsibility for the entire English-speaking population of the 
world?" They refused to take into account Andranik Migranyan's 
arguments that "Russia is not indifferent to the direction of 
the development of the CIS republics because instability and 
conflicts in the Commonwealth countries influence the domestic 
political situation in Russia itself." 
  The mutual lack of understanding of the two states' 
politicians stems, in A. Yakovlev's opinion, from the burden of 
the old ideological cliches, from the legacy of Sovietology -- a 
"lost science in a lost era." 
  However, as for the creation of an atmosphere of trust 
between the two powers, this, according to the U.S. 
representatives, cannot be formed "centrally" but must develop 
"from the grass roots." The question repeated most often by the 
U.S. delegation at the forum was about the preferable forms of 
aid to Russia. In Mark Masarskiy's opinion, since small and 
medium business is the natural environment for the development 
of democracy, that is where aid must be given first of all, 
bypassing the government. But ITAR-TASS General Director 
Vitaliy Ignatenko noted that the press remains an important 
instrument of democracy and if the world community does not want 
to lose the free flow of information from Russia and the CIS 
countries this flow cannot be left without injections of finance 
otherwise it will dry up. 
  The Aspen Dialogue showed once again how difficult the path 
toward mutual understanding is and that it is not only the 
politicians who have to shoulder those difficulties.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Nadein report: "Russian Government's Cavalier </F>
Attitude Clouds Opening of Washington Exhibition"] 
  [Text] Washington -- In an attempt that is desperate 
rather than just bold, the Russian Union of Industrialists and 
Entrepreneurs [RUIE] has brought several hundred examples of our 
advanced technology to the U.S. capital, set them up in 
Washington's best exhibition hall, lodged in hotels 450 leading 
people from all over Russia, set the lowest possible price for a 
visit to the exhibition ($10), and sat back to wait for success, 
trusting that the event will at least prove promising to the 
degree where people say: "You never can tell." 
  But even with such a sense of humor you do not feel like 
joking here. You get the impression that the exhibition's 
organizers did not burden themselves too much with the questions 
of where, when, for what purpose, and for whom they were holding 
it. 
  There are no industrial enterprises in Washington. Not one. 
The city lives on three sources of income: the government, 
tourism, and social benefits from the state. "We have not 
mounted the exhibition for gapers but for professionals," RUIE 
Chairman A.I. Volskiy said on opening it, as though responding 
to this doubt. "There is no particular need to entice 
professionals, for they themselves will come running to exhibits 
such as we have here." 
  The experienced A. Volskiy probably employed this approach 
inherited from the Soviet philosophy of waiting in line ("If a 
commodity is good, a buyer will turn up") not out of stagnant 
conservatism but out of grim necessity. The exhibition, which 
his union spent a whole year preparing, was in desperate need of 
money. Just three days before it opened, it was on the verge of 
ruin. "If Moscow Mayor Luzhkov had not opened credits for us at 
the last minute, the exhibition simply would not have happened," 
V.A. Nikulin, Volskiy's deputy in the RUIE, said. 
  When and how the Entrepreneurs' Union, which has gotten 
deeply into debt with this exhibition, will manage to justify 
Moscow's credit is a special question. It is only clear that in 
business contacts no special hopes should be pinned on 
governmental structures. Both presidents, B. Yeltsin and B. 
Clinton, did the exhibition the honor of signing greetings 
messages almost a month before it started. The U.S. President 
was magnanimous: "Today more than ever the development of the 
world economy has become dependent on trade expansion and access 
to world markets. Competition among countries is growing, and 
under these conditions not one of them can manage without 
developing and strengthening political and economic ties which 
contribute to countries' prosperity and well-being. This 
dependence has been manifested particularly vividly in the 
growing friendship of Russia and the United States. From joint 
space research and solutions for ecological problems to the 
development of advanced telecommunications systems our two 
peoples are marching at the front of the world community of 
nations." 
  B.N. Yeltsin was more specific in his greetings message and 
emphasized the promising nature of "large-scale" U.S. 
investments in Russia's economy and of joint work in the markets 
of third countries. 
  It is already known that the contract part of the exhibition 
is bound to succeed, since, according to Volskiy, approximately 
50 contracts agreed beforehand will have been signed by the time 
it closes. But there is doubt about the accuracy of this 
figure, since too much is unpredictable in the course of it -- 
all the innovations, alas, are of an unpleasant nature. 
  Above all, Oleg Soskovets, Russia's first deputy prime 
minister, refused at the last minute to fly in to participate in 
the exhibition. "When Soskovets was picked for the trip here, 
everything was proceeding OK, we reported here. The Americans 
raised (their participation) to the level of Secretary Brown. 
Now an arms deal with Malaysia has unexpectedly -- well, maybe 
not for IZVESTIYA, but for you -- unexpectedly cropped up, and a 
huge number of MiG-29's are being sold to it. Soskovets is 
snatched away from our trip and dashes off to Malaysia to sign 
this contract. Naturally, this side also lets its commerce 
secretary go to South Africa for the ceremony along with Hillary 
Clinton, the President's wife, and Vice President Gore." 
  This was how Volskiy explained this strange situation, when 
a 
Russian Government leader is "snatched away" from a previously 
agreed program, as a result of which the U.S. side is obliged 
urgently to send its secretary further out of Washington, so as 
not to find himself in an awkward situation and to respond to 
the cavalier attitude of his Moscow colleagues. 
  As for the "huge deal," about which A.I. Volskiy deemed it 
necessary to speak "off the record," naturally Washington knew 
of it the day the accords were reached, i.e. 6 May. But it 
cannot have occurred to anyone here that the sale of 18 fighters 
(precisely this is the extent of the "huge deal") to Malaysia 
would take place at the expense of a provocative gesture toward 
America's government and business world. 
  To all appearances, since the first beginnings of a market 
in 
our life too little time has passed for our leaders to realize, 
not just in mere words but really and truly, the importance of 
business and businessmen at the end of the second millennium AD. 
It is possible that our Oleg Soskovets will still somehow come 
to an arrangement with Secretary Brown. Governments do not bear 
grudges. But U.S. businessmen, who over the past 200 years have 
never had experience of functioning under a government which 
takes 93 percent of their profit and so are none too tolerant of 
loutishness from their own capital, are still less inclined to 
tolerate it from someone else's. 
  If you compare the level of the technologies exhibited, then 
President Clinton's words about a people marching "at the front 
of the world community" are largely justified. But the poor 
organization, the wretched staging, the plainly unsuccessful 
venue, and the arrogant disdain of our own government place the 
exhibition "Russian Technologies-94" clearly in a ranking below 
similar events conducted in the United States not only by 
countries such as Brazil or South Korea but also the Czech 
Republic, Poland, and Romania. 
  The commercial training of the Russian guests is altogether 
beneath all criticism. Although the majority of them are 
splendid professionals with a profound and comprehensive 
knowledge of their own technologies, they freeze with ineptness 
or blush like maidens at such a simple and natural question as: 
How much? Some were offering their products for sale on the 
U.S. market at such fabulously low prices that visitors could 
not help thinking about perfidious Russian dumping. They would 
be talking with a representative from Kaluga and would be 
astounded, as he himself was astounded, to learn that products 
analogous with his cost not $3 in Washington stores, as he was 
sincerely convinced, but a whole $30. 
  Just as irreproachably naive were not only vendors of car 
mirrors and distinctive picture-frame moldings but also 
developers of superaccurate missiles for the Navy. They too 
were flummoxed by the questions: How much? When will you 
deliver? How will you train personnel? 
  In the hotel where the leaders of Russian enterprises and 
scientific research establishments, which frequently do, in 
actual fact, march at the front of the "whole planet," are 
staying, the prudent management disconnected the telephones in 
the rooms in advance. In America, as is known, a hotel guest 
pays not only for international calls but also for calls within 
the city itself. Experience shows that Russians vacate their 
room, refusing to pay not only for local calls but also for 
lengthy intercontinental calls. 
  If RUIE Chairman A.I. Volskiy conceived this exhibition as a 
demonstration of his own organizing abilities, then the 
experiment should be considered perfectly successful. It was 
very difficult, very troublesome, and very expensive to hold 
such an event. But if solid business contacts had been planned 
as the desired result, then resources should be saved up for the 
next time, when the chief motive will be not "they will come 
running themselves" but "the customer is always right." 
  The exhibition will last three days and will end Thursday 12 
May. Provision has not been made to continue it in other U.S. 
cities.

  [Text] Geneva May 13 TASS -- Russian envoy to former 
Yugoslavia Vitaliy Churkin believes the Vienna agreements on the 
borders of the Muslim-Croatian federation in Bosnia need to be 
thoroughly analysed in order to determine how they affect the 
Bosnian Serbs. 
  "It is necessary to find out how do they correspond to the 
general settlement process which also includes Bosnian Serbs", 
he told TASS late on Thursday adding that "in particular, the 
size of the territory on which the parties plan to create the 
Croatian-Muslim federation needs an attentive consideration". 
  The Russian envoy also said that the work of the "contact 
group" which spent two weeks in Bosnia-Herzegovina will become 
"an element of the general mosaic" to be discussed on Friday by 
foreign ministers of Russia, the United States and five EU 
countries.

<F P=106> [Maksim Yusin report: "War in Bosnia: Russia and the EU </F>
Fail To Surmount Differences with the United States"] 
  [Text] On the threshold of the meeting of the foreign 
ministers of Russia, the United States, France, Britain, 
Germany, Belgium, and Greece scheduled for 13 May in Geneva the 
"Great Powers" have failed to surmount the serious differences 
preventing them from working out a coordinated position. 
  The Russian and French diplomats who initiated the Geneva 
talks had hoped to be able to persuade the Americans to alter 
their approach -- which would have enabled Russia, the United 
States, and the EU [European Union] finally to act as a united 
front and put effective pressure on the opposing sides in 
Bosnia. To judge from recent statements by Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher and other U.S. officials, there is little 
chance of this. 
  Washington is still skeptical about the plan proposed by the 
EU and supported by Moscow for a repartition of Bosnia, under 
which the Serbs are to get 49 percent of the republic's 
territory and the Muslims and Croats 51 percent. It has also 
proved impossible to find a common language on the question of 
sanctions against Yugoslavia. Russia has long been demanding 
that they be lifted. The Europeans are prepared to agree to a 
gradual easing of sanctions in exchange for Serb compromises. 
As for the Americans, they are categorically opposed to any 
indulgence for Belgrade. 
  The Russians and West Europeans in turn stubbornly reject 
the 
U.S. idea of lifting the embargo on arms deliveries to the 
Bosnian Government. Moscow is afraid that this step will alter 
the correlation of forces to the Serbs' disadvantage and will 
inspire the Muslims to new offensive operations. The EU 
countries fear for the fate of their peacemakers, who could end 
up hostages in the event of the conflict's escalation. 
  In the opinion of informed Russian Foreign Ministry 
personnel 
the Geneva talks will be very complex. The sides will hardly be 
able to form a single approach to all key questions and thereby 
prepare the ground for a summit meeting on Bosnia, the need for 
which has been stated repeatedly by Moscow. 
  There is a more modest but, so people on Smolensk Square 
believe, perfectly attainable goal: to advance a joint 
initiative for a cease-fire on all fronts in Bosnia. This would 
make it possible to remove the tension in the region of the 
Serb-controlled city of Brcko, around which large Muslim and 
Croat forces have been concentrated. If the Bosnian government 
troops succeed in taking the city and cutting the narrow 
corridor connecting Serb regions in Bosnia with Yugoslavia, the 
Serbs' position will deteriorate sharply, and the war will 
commence a new spiral. 
  The aim of Russian diplomacy is to prevent such a 
development 
of events and to make the warring sides sign an armistice. The 
Serbs, who have seized practically all the territories that they 
wanted, are to all appearances ready to agree to a cease-fire. 
The hardest task is to convince the Muslims of this -- which is 
only possible if the Americans come out decisively in support of 
an armistice. How ready they are for this must come to light 
during the Geneva meeting.

France -- on problems of a Bosnian settlement. 
  The meeting aims to work out a common position on the 
Bosnian 
problem and to pave the way for the resumption of talks between 
the conflicting sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Excerpts] Athens, 12 May (ITAR-TASS) -- "All initiatives 
concerning the fundamental interests of stability and security 
in Europe are best to be implemented within the CSCE framework." 
Such is the position taken by the Russian diplomacy on the pact 
for stability in Europe which is planned to be signed on 26-27 
May in Paris, as members of the Russian delegation that took 
part in a preparatory meeting of senior officials held in Athens 
on Thursday told an ITAR-TASS correspondent today. 
  The meeting was attended by delegations from almost all 
European countries, the United States and Canada, as well as 
seven international organizations including the United Nations, 
CSCE, the European Commission, WEU [Western European Union] and 
NATO. The CIS countries were represented by delegations from 
Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Moldova. Armenia and Azerbaijan 
were present as observers. [passage omitted] 
  As ITAR-TASS correspondent learned, Russian diplomatic 
circles are especially concerned about the question of borders. 
Russia believes that this question should be considered only on 
the basis of such fundamental principles of the CSCE as 
inviolability of the borders, respect for territorial integrity 
of the states and their sovereignty. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Sychev report: "European Union Gives Us Two and </F>
a Half Freedoms"] 
  [Text] European Union [EU] and Russian experts have 
completed work on a draft partnership agreement that will be 
discussed by the EU Council early next week at foreign minister 
level. 
  This agreement is not identical with the accords that some 
of 
our former CEMA partners in East Europe have with the EU. The 
Common Market agreed on free trade with them right away. Russia 
represents an economy that is large for the EU, and Brussels 
will not agree to harmonization with it without careful 
consideration. Nevertheless a treaty with Russia is desirable 
for Moscow. It provides a legal footing for trade and economic 
relations with the EU. 
  The prepared draft constitutes an interim agreement. It will 
operate until late 1997, when a decision is to be adopted on 
whether it should be supplemented with a statute on free trade. 
In its current form Moscow will receive two and a half of the 
four freedoms operating with the EU -- freedom of movement for 
goods, services, capital, and manpower -- namely freedom of 
movement for services and capital, and the phased liberalization 
of commodity exchange. 
  In the opinion of Foreign Ministry experts, the EU's 
agreeing 
to grant Russia the same advantages that other members of GATT 
enjoy was a very important gain for Moscow. Through not taking 
part in that organization Russia has often fallen victim to 
restrictive measures introduced against its competitive goods. 
Moscow will now obtain the right to demand observance of GATT 
norms within the EU -- provided, of course, that it meets them 
itself. 
  It only proved possible to make a breakthrough on two 
problems that remained unresolved until recently -- Russian 
exports of nuclear materials and the status of West European 
banks in Russia -- as a result of contacts by telephone and fax 
between Sir Leon Brittan, EU commissioner for trade, and 
Aleksandr Shokhin, deputy chairman of the Russian Government. 
  Moscow insisted that there should not be deliberate 
discrimination against Russian exports of fissionable materials 
but encountered dogged opposition from Paris. France also 
produces nuclear materials and is afraid of an influx of a large 
quantity of cheaper Russian output. The compromise goes like 
this: Moscow's demand has been met, but the EU reserves the 
right to use commercial means to protect the market until the 
term of the agreement expires, consulting with Russia on every 
occasion. 
  As for Western banks, it has been decided that the Russian 
president's restrictive edict will be abrogated in 1995.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Aleksandr Krylovich </F>
and Vladimir Taranov] 
  [Text] Moscow May 12 TASS -- A decision on granting the 
status of "associated partnership" to nine countries of central 
and eastern Europe as well as the Baltics, which was adopted at 
the meeting of the Council of Ministers of the Western European 
Union [WEU] in Luxemburg on May 9, does not evoke a uniform 
response, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Mikhail Demurin 
told a briefing here on Thursday. 
  "We regard this action as an attempt to find a new model for 
military and political cooperation on a limited space in 
Europe," he noted. In the opinion of the Russian diplomat, this 
is at variance with the need for building a truly pan-European 
system of security and stability. 
  It is a mistake to bank on cooperation in which there is no 
place for such a country as Russia. Such a trend, if it picks 
up steam, is fraught with raising artificial barriers and 
creating a threat for a new split in Europe, Demurin underlined. 
  "We support another way based on the principles of really 
broad cooperation between all European states. We stand out for 
the WEU to become, in future, part of a pan-European structure 
under the aegis of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe," the spokesman continued. 
  He pointed to Russia's serious interest in developing a 
constructive dialogue and practical cooperation with the WEU as 
well as its member countries.

  [Text] Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin and member of 
the Federal Council, Head of the Swiss Economics Department 
Jean-Pascal Delamuraz signed a bilateral agreement on trade and 
economic cooperation in Moscow today. 
  Chernomyrdin suggested that Russian-Swiss cooperation had 
good perspectives since the commodity turnover between the two 
countries had doubled last year. Chernomyrdin said they had 
also discussed attracting foreign investments to Russia and 
education of Russian businessmen in Switzerland. Chernomyrdin 
announced that they had also considered possible activities of 
the Credit Suisse bank on Russian territory. He promised that a 
way would be found for the Swiss bank to start its work in 
Russia. However, Chernomyrdin had mentioned the Russian 
president's decree limiting activities of foreign banks in 
Russia. 
  Jean-Pascal Delamuraz said his delegation including leading 
Swiss economists intended to negotiate with the Russian vice 
premiers, ministers and the chairperson of the Central Bank of 
Russia on a number of issues concerning bilateral cooperation.

<F P=106> [Vadim Prokopenko report under the "Topic of the Day" </F>
rubric: "Ownerless Atomic Bomb Waiting for Its Fate To Be 
Decided for Over Three Years"] 
  [Text] "Following the breakup of the Soviet Union the 
Belovezhskaya agreement, the Almaty declaration, and agreements 
among the CIS heads of state say that everything that is on the 
territory of each state is its property. The Baykonur 
cosmodrome and the Semipalatinsk test site are the property of 
Kazakhstan.... So Russia has nothing to do with them," Nursultan 
Nazarbayev said in a speech at UN headquarters in New York in 
1994. 
  But it does. Russia very directly has something to do with 
the Semipalatinsk test site. No matter how Nursultan Nazarbayev 
wanted to stun the whole world community in the golden hall at 
UN headquarters with his presidential authority, he has to give 
Russia's atomic specialists their due. 
  Back in May 1991 a physical irradiation experiment was 
prepared at installation 108-k in the granite Degelen mountain 
"in order to improve military equipment." This means that a 
tunnel 592 meters long was driven through a mass of granite 
around 20 km in diameter at a depth of at least 126 meters from 
the surface. A small (by present-day standards) atomic bomb 
with a yield of 0.4 kilotonnes, equivalent to 400 tonnes of TNT, 
was set up at one end of this tunnel 108-k, and specially 
designed objects were set up at the other end. When the bomb 
was detonated, the articles would receive the full impact. 
Scientists would bring them to the surface, study the damage, 
and refine the latest achievements of the Soviet Union's 
military thought. On whose territory, I would remind you, both 
Russians and Kazakhs lived until the end of 1991.... 
  In August 1991 the Kazakhstani president closed the 
Semipalatinsk test site, but the atomic bomb remained deep 
within Degelen mountain. It could in principle have been 
detonated long since. But in big-league politics Kazakhstan had 
employed the tactic of a state which had voluntarily renounced 
nuclear arms, and an underground explosion with that kind of 
yield would have been noticed by satellites all around the 
world.... 
  A decision was made to remove the atomic charge and the 
military equipment back in 1992. Since then talks have been 
under way at the highest state level. Kazakhstan has even 
recruited U.S. specialists. They have insistently recommended 
that this problem be entrusted to Russia. 
  "We have experience of unearthing atomic charges. Through 
the history of the test site there have been several known cases 
of buried charges' suffering technical failure," according to 
Anatoliy Matushchenko, a specialist from the Russian Federation 
Ministry of Atomic Energy. "A joint Russian-Kazakhstani group 
is now starting work and is to implement a project formulated by 
the All-Union Scientific Research and Planning Institute of 
Industrial Technology (Moscow) and draw up an estimate of 
expenditure. The whole job could take more than six months, but 
it must be done before winter sets in. The Russian side will 
cover all the expenditure. By all accounts this will amount to 
in excess of 1 billion rubles...." 
  Everything that is removed from under the ground will be the 
property of the Russian Federation. Corresponding agreements 
have already been signed to this effect. No one, not even 
Kazakhstan representatives, will be able to see the irradiation 
facilities or touch the bomb that has spent over three years 
underground. Incidentally, nuclear charges have never been 
stored for so long out of storage facilities. So in this 
respect the Semipalatinsk experiment will prove unique in its 
own way.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Aleksandr Krulovich </F>
and Vladimir Taranov] 
  [Text] Moscow, 12 May -- The Russian Foreign Ministry today 
called on the Tajik opposition, military, and political 
groupings in Afghanistan and the involved states to do 
everything possible in order not to allow the situation on the 
Tajik-Afghan border to aggravate. Mikhail Demurin, deputy 
director of the Press and Information Directorate of the Russian 
foreign policy department, said this addressing a briefing today. 
  He said that "one of the priorities in Russian foreign 
policy" at present was to assist in settling the Tajik conflict 
and to restore peace and calm in the country. In the diplomat's 
words, great importance is being attached to the continuation of 
the inter-Tajik talks that started with the Moscow round. The 
world's response to its results shows that "great hopes are 
being linked with the progress of the dialogue." 
  Demurin stated with regret that this approach was not being 
shared by everyone--the recalcitrant part of the Tajik armed 
opposition, supported by Afghan mojahedins, is concentrating its 
forces on the border. This is increasing the danger of 
"large-scale hostilities," the Russian Foreign Ministry 
spokesman said.

  [Text] The Russian Foreign Ministry has welcomed the 
agreement on ceasefire in Nagorno-Karabakh and insisted that it 
be strictly implemented by all parties. This was announced by 
an official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry, 
Mikhail Demurin, at a briefing in Moscow today. 
  He said it was necessary to achieve a breakthrough in 
development of the situation, to turn to peace and to confirm 
the armistice with a legally binding agreement which would put 
an end to the armed conflict once and for all. 
  Demurin announced that the agreement on ceasefire had been 
reached on May 12 late at night by the Armenian and Azerbaijani 
defense ministers and the commander of the Nagorno-Karabakh army 
with a significant contribution made by Russia and the chairman 
of the CSCE Minsk Group on Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  "Contrary to the ceasefires unilaterally declared by 
Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan this agreement provides for 
mutual obligations of the parties and a compromise reached with 
the participation of the mediators," Demurin stressed.

  [Text] Moscow May 12 TASS -- The determination of Moldova 
and its breakaway Dniester region to improve their mutual 
relations is designed to subdue the entire conflict, the Russian 
president's special envoy for Moldova Vladillen Vasev said on 
Thursday in an interview with TASS, commenting on the joint 
statement signed by the Moldovan and Dniester leaders. 
  The document signed the other day is quite constructive and 
can lay down a good basis for further negotiations on the whole 
set of problems facing the confronting sides, Russia's envoy 
stressed. 
  "Both sides have come to understand that the situation 
developing in Moldova and its Dniester region calls for a 
pragmatic approach. As a result, the sides managed to find 
mutually acceptable variants of conflict settlement", he noted. 
  Vasev laid a special emphasis on the fact that the signed 
document stressed the need for defining the state and legal 
status of the Dniester region. "This is to considerably 
facilitate further efforts aiming to draw the conflicting sides 
closer together", he pointed out. 
  The sides also reached a compromise on a transition period 
and a gradual acquirement by the Dniester region of its state 
and legal status, the Russian diplomat reported. 
  There has recently been certain progress in relations 
between 
Moldova and its separatist province, which agreed upon 
approaches to solution of the most pressing problems. "However, 
I would warn against excessive optimism at the moment, since a 
lot of differences remain to be settled yet, including through 
Russia's mediation", Vasev stressed.

  [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] May 12 TASS -- Commander of the 
Russian 14th Army, deployed in the Moldovan break-away Dniester 
province, Aleksandr Lebed has accused the leadership of the 
self-proclaimed republic of attempts to blame Russian military 
for the worsening economic situation. 
  The general rejected accusations by Dniester Bank Chairman 
Vyacheslav Zagryadskiy, quoted by local media, that the field 
bank of the Russian Army allegedly bought 39 billion of Dniester 
roubles (interim currency made from old Soviet banknotes by 
sticking a special stamp with a portrait of Russian 
Field-Marshal Aleksandr Suvorov). The Army was buying Dniester 
roubles in order to undermine the economy, the banker claimed. 
  "There is not a single Dniester rouble in the money-box of 
the Army field bank", the general told ITAR-TASS today adding 
that the economic catastrophe of the region had been caused by 
its "incompetent and thieving leadership". 
  This is not the first time that Lebed accused Dniester 
leaders of financial embezzlements and corruption.

  [Text] The Council of Europe "played up" to the 
representatives of the Baltic states, first of all to Estonia, 
when it linked Russia's membership in it to the withdrawal of 
Russian troops from the Baltic countries, a senior member of the 
Russian Foreign Ministry told Interfax. 
  According to him, the Council of Europe "is not quite 
impartial" in its attitude to the presence of Russian troops in 
the Baltic countries. 
  In comments on the statement by Belgium's Foreign Minister, 
Willy Klaas, to the effect that the presence of foreign troops 
in sovereign states against their will violates the basic 
principles of the Council of Europe, the diplomat said: "We have 
repeatedly explained to our partners in the Council of Europe 
that this is a historic reality. Russia never deployed its 
troops in the Baltic countries. Stalin and other Soviet rulers, 
not the leaders of the Russian Federation, should be blamed for 
it." 
  According to him, Russia "displayed good will", when it 
placed the former Soviet troops deployed in the Baltic republics 
under its own jurisdiction in February of 1992, and began to 
withdraw them gradually. "It would have been interesting to 
watch the Baltic states' reaction, if we had not done so (as a 
matter of fact, we did not have to do it). They would have 
obtained on their soil armed men for whom no one is 
responsible," the diplomat said. 
  "We shall remove our troops from Estonia in the near future, 
agreement or no agreement. As regards Latvia, this problems has 
been almost resolved. Even if Russia's membership in the 
Council of Europe is delayed for a couple of months, it will not 
be too momentous for us, since the issue of time is not of 
fundamental importance," he stressed. 
  At the same time, the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman 
Mikhail Demurin said in Moscow today that the leadership of the 
Council of Europe had spoken in favor of the rapid acceptance of 
Russia. 
  He said that Russia could become a full member in the first 
half of 1995.

<F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast: Video report by Ye. Sokolova] </F>
  [Text] Despite the fact that the Russian side has not yet 
furnished Estonia with a timetable for the withdrawal of its 
forces, the withdrawal itself is, according to the military, 
proceeding strictly on schedule. 
  The headquarters of the Navy in Tallinn is left with only 
support units under its command. Ninety percent of the property 
from the torpedo and mine depot has already been shipped out by 
rail and road. Only a few bits and pieces remain. The 
workshops for overhauling torpedoes are deserted. Equipment is 
being sold to the Estonian side. It will be possible to make 
use of it for civilian purposes. Unserviceable and obsolete 
equipment is being abandoned. It would be very expensive to 
ship it out, and the Ministry of Defense is refusing permission 
to sell it off as scrap metal. It is clearly afraid of a 
repetition of the problems experienced in the Western Group of 
Forces. So we are abandoning thousands of tonnes of metal, to 
the joy of the local scrap merchants. 
  Unlike the Ground Forces units, the Navy units are not being 
withdrawn but are being disbanded on the spot. Only one in 
three officers is being offered a new posting. This means that 
two-thirds of them will end up homeless in our vast motherland. 
Those with less than 20 years of service will not even get a 
service pension. What is to become of them? Will they just 
become vagrants in naval uniform? Who will answer for the fact 
that people who are having to listen daily to being called 
"occupationists," people who have given the best years of their 
lives to the Navy, are being abandoned to their fate?

  [Text] Moscow May 12 TASS -- Russia called on warring 
Yemeni leaders to stop fighting and said it is ready to promote 
an end to the conflict and help ensure peace in the country. 
  "The government of the Russian Federation again insistently 
calls on the warring sides to immediately cease fire and reach 
an agreement on armistice", the Russian Government said in a 
statement on Thursday. 
  "The Yemeni leaders should find strength to make the final 
choice towards a peaceful political settlement of 
contradictions. Moscow is sure that peaceful ways out of the 
Yemeni crisis do exist", according to the statement. 
  "Moscow believes that Yemeni leaders realise the 
inadmissibility and senselessness of the continuing bloodshed, 
the inevitable consequences of the fratricidal war for the 
future of the Yemeni people", it added. 
  "In the current critical situation it is especially 
important 
to be above emotions and settling accounts, to show state 
wisdom, abide by common sense and long-term interests of the 
country and its citizens", according to the document. 
  The government stressed that the tragic developments in 
Yemen 
cause great concern and reiterated that it is ready to actively

  [Text] The Russian government considers it unacceptable to 
change unilaterally the present international regulation of 
navigation in the Black Sea gulfs and hopes that Turkey will 
review its position on this issue. This was said in a note sent 
by the Russian Foreign Ministry to the Turkish Embassy on April 
29 in connection with the adoption of a navigation regulation in 
the Black Sea gulfs by the Turkish government, an official 
representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry Mikhail Demurin 
said at a news briefing in Moscow on Thursday. 
  In his words, "a number of articles of the regulation 
adopted 
by Turkey envisages the procedure of passage through the gulfs 
and considerable restrictions up to the complete ban on such 
passage for certain categories of vessels depending on their 
length, draft, cargo, etc." Demurin said that these articles of 
the regulation go beyond issues of navigational safety and 
contradict international convention. 
  In Demurin's opinion "the steps taken by the Turkish side 
regarding the gulfs can create unnecessary complications in this 
region. They should be perceived as an attempt to replace 
international regulation on this issue by domestic legislation."

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Sychev report: "Moscow Has Still Not Decided </F>
Whether To Cancel Syrian Debts. Reports of Russian Generosity 
Were Exaggerated"] 
  [Text] It has not been ruled out that a small portion of 
Syria's debts to the Soviet Union, which have now been inherited 
by Russia, will be written off. A Russian Ministry of Foreign 
Economic Relations staffer refused to be drawn on how far 
Moscow's generosity would extend while negotiations are still in 
progress. 
  Some Arab newspapers have been quick to report that an 
agreement was signed during the visit to Damascus by Russian 
First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets and that Russia canceled 90 
percent of Syria's debts. 
  Yuriy Mikhaylov, advisor to the vice premier, who was in the 
delegation along with representatives from the Ministry of 
Foreign Economic Relations, has stated that no agreement on debt 
was reached, although there are high hopes of resolving the 
problem this year. 
  The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations staffer reported 
that the exact total of Syria's debts is in the order of $11 
billion. Of this total, almost $4 billion are overdue payments. 
Moreover, the USSR gave Syria a total of $205 million in freely 
convertible currency. The rest is composed of ruble loans, 
mainly to acquire arms and military equipment in the USSR, and 
also interest. 
  Damascus has in fact been pressing for the bulk of the debt 
-- which has emerged as the result of unproductive spending on 
military purposes -- to be written off, for repayment conditions 
to be relaxed, and first and foremost for the right to pay in 
installments over 20 years. Moscow favors the fulfillment of 
the contractual obligations relating to every loan and the 
repayment of the debt by 2005, at least with regard to the 
foreign currency loans. It is envisaged that the remaining 
amount will be paid off by deliveries of commodities (Syria has 
approximately 70 commodity categories which are in demand on 
world markets), by financing Russian institutions in Syria, and 
also via reinvestment in the local economy. 
  The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations is convinced of 
Syria's creditworthiness. Before the collapse of the 
transaction clearing system, when Russia stopped meeting its 
commitments, Damascus was punctually paying off 400-500 million 
clearing rubles a year in order to cancel its debts. By 1994 
Syria had paid back a total of $5.2 billion. Its present 
financial and economic well-being is not causing any concern to 
specialists, and it is undoubtedly a major trading partner of 
ours. 
  Following the cooling of relations between the USSR and 
Egypt, Syria remained Moscow's only strategic partner in the 
Near East. Russia intends to preserve this special relationship. 
  Political factors, and also the bid price (going rate) of 
Syrian debt on the world debt market will be taken into account 
in determining the percentage of the debt to be written off, if 
indeed things reach that stage, the Ministry of Foreign Economic 
Relations staffer said. In any case we are only talking about 
fairly insignificant sums and certainly not 90 percent of the 
debt. This concession, the ministry claims, does not create a 
dangerous precedent for debt negotiations with other countries.

  [Text] Moscow, May 13 (YONHAP) -- North Korea keeps 
shunning a Russian expert's witness of the disintegration of a 
submarine they had purchased from Russia supposedly for use as 
scrap, it was learned here on Friday. 
  Officials at the Russian Defense Ministry said his Ministry 
had several times asked North Korea to accept a Russian expert's 
witness of the disintegration of a discarded Russian submarine 
delivered to them last December. But, North Korea has not 
affirmatively responded, they said. 
  Western sources here said North Korea seems to have already 
begun disintegrating the submarine. 
  "As they reject a Russian expert's presence, there is the 
strong possibility that they may recycle the submarine for 
military purpose," the sources said. 
  They said that despite North Korea's rejection of such 
witness, the Russian Pacific Fleet has decided to deliver more 
discarded submarines to North Korea. 
  Last November, North Korea signed a contract with Russia for 
the purchase of 12 discarded Russian submarines for use as 
"scrap." 
  The contract provides for a Russian expert's witness of the 
disintegration of the submarines delivered so as to dispel the 
possibility of them being recycled militarily in North Korea. 
  One of the submarines was delivered to North Korea last 
December and a North Korean tugboat is presently in Vladivostok 
preparing to tow another.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Aleksandr Krylovich </F>
and Vladimir Taranov] 
  [Text] Moscow May 12 TASS -- Russia warned North Korea on 
Thursday that if the human rights of its lumberjacks in the 
Russian Far East are not observed, it will not prolong a 
corresponding agreement with Pyongyang. 
  Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Mikhail Demurin told a 
briefing that a Russian delegation is leaving soon for North 
Korea to discuss a new agreement on timber processing in 
Khabarovsk and Amur regions as the latest one expired in 1993. 
  "The Russian side believes that the most important article 
of 
the new document should become the provision, according to which 
the rights of citizens of the People's Democratic Republic of 
Korea working in Russia should correspond to Russian legislation 
and international norms", he said. 
  Russian press reports said that the rights of North Korean 
workers are being rudely violated by their authorities. 
  "If no agreement (on human rights) is reached Russia will 
consider itself free from the rights and obligations fixed in 
the earlier agreement", Demurin stressed. 
  He also informed that Russian-North Korean talks at the 
level 
of deputy foreign ministers began in Moscow on Thursday. "The 
sides plan to consider the whole complex of bilateral relations 
and international problems", according to Demurin. 
  He explained that this includes political and economic 
relations, key aspects of the situation on the Korean Peninsula, 
including the nuclear non-proliferation problems and the Russian 
proposal to convene an international conference on security and 
nuclear-free status of Korea.

<F P=106> [Report by Mikhail Kozhukhov: "Kim Il-Song's Loggers Will </F>
Remain in Siberia After All, and They Can Flee from There to 
South Korea If They Wish"] 
  [Text] The fate of the 7,000 loggers from South Korea 
felling timber in Khabarovsk Kray will be decided at talks 
opening in Pyongyang. 
  The stumbling block at these talks -- this is the third 
round 
-- is differences between Moscow and Pyongyang over the legal 
status of the loggers in Siberia. The old agreement, signed 
back in the time of developed socialism, allowed the Korean 
authorities to dispense justice in the logging camps in 
accordance with North Korean laws. But the agreement expired 
last December. 
  Moscow does not rule out the probability of violations of 
the 
code of the builders of communism occurring in the logging 
camps: You cannot really expect refined behavior from operators 
of the "Druzhba" gasoline-driven saw, even if they are dedicated 
to the chuche idea. But Moscow is nonetheless insisting that 
citizens of the "land of morning freshness" -- North Korea -- 
working in Siberia should now enjoy all the democratic rights 
enjoyed by the citizens of the "country building capitalism" -- 
Russia. For example, the right to strike, an eight-hour working 
day, and the opportunity to move anywhere, provided they have 
papers. 
  "If these demands are not heeded there will be no 
agreement," 
Valentin Moiseyev, chief of the Russian Foreign Ministry Korea 
department, said. He described as "rubbish" an AP report the 
other day that North Korea has lately been evacuating its 
loggers from Siberia, in order to deprive them of the 
opportunity to "choose freedom" and flee to South Korea. 
  Citing sources in the South Korean capital, the agency 
insists that at least 170 fugitive loggers have taken refuge in 
remote camps in the taiga in the hope of being able to get to 
the southern part of the historic homeland. Pyongyang regards 
them as having been "kidnapped" by Seoul, where a special 
commission has even been set up to resolve matters related to 
the resettlement of former loggers. Seoul is rather afraid that 
there might by spies working for Kim Il-song, not to mention 
criminals, among them. The problem is complicated by the fact 
that the fugitives have to be taken at their word: Their 
identity cards are permanently held by the labor camps they have 
left. 
  Valentin Moiseyev tends to take a sardonic view of stories 
of 
supposed atrocities by Pyongyang special services in Khabarovsk 
Kray. According to Foreign Ministry data, only four fugitive 
loggers have gotten to South Korea so far, and illegally at that 
-- which, as a matter of fact, was unnecessary: Russia would 
neither help nor hinder loggers wishing to go either to North or 
to South Korea. 
  The talk of tortured dissidents and of a prison regime in 
these logging camps may turn out to be untrue, if only because 
Kim Il-song's loggers are little different from the so-called 
Soviet workers abroad who resisted evacuation from Iraq during 
the war in the Persian Gulf or from battle-torn Yemen. The 
loggers are highly paid by North Korean standards, and many of 
them bribed officials at home to get the chance to wield an ax 
in Siberian temperatures of 60 below. 
  According to Valentin Moiseyev, the North Koreans' selfless 
work in the Siberian taiga means a net profit for our country. 
Two-thirds of what they fell -- and that is three million cubic 
meters of timber per year -- stays in Russia. 
  It is not inconceivable that the problem of fugitive loggers 
will be touched on at the talks with DPRK Deputy Foreign 
Minister Li Yen Gu [name as transliterated], who is in Moscow. 
The story is that the senior diplomat's talks will cover the 
whole range of bilateral relations, including Russia's proposal 
on holding an international conference on security problems on 
the Korean peninsula.

<F P=106> [Report by Armen Khanbabyan in the "Armenia" column: "The </F>
Risk of War Has Given Way to the Risk of Peace. Yerevan and 
Stepanakert Are Content With the Results of the Bishkek Meeting"] 
  [Excerpt] Armenian parliament speaker Babken Ararktsyan 
believes that realism has triumphed at the meeting in Bishkek. 
Its main achievement, according to him, has been the 
recognition by all the participants in the negotiations of some 
political realities, without which the advance to peace is 
impossible. These are: a stable cease-fire, recognition of 
Nagorno-Karabakh as a party to the conflict, and lifting all 
blockades -- and only after this, discussions about the status 
of the region. Ararktsyan stressed several times that the 
proposed plan is based on a "land in exchange for peace" 
formula, which carries a substantial share of risk for Armenia 
and Karabakh. But in exchange Armenia and Karabakh will get 
territories, from which their troops will be pulled out, as well 
as the lifting of the blockade, and peace. Both acquisitions, 
in Ararktsyan's opinion, are fairly fragile because the blockade 
can be easily resumed and peace breached. But Yerevan and 
Stepanakert are ready to take "the risk of peace" even with 
minimum guarantees, which provided a foundation for their 
signing the Bishkek protocol without any provisos. 
  Baku's hesitations, on the other hand, were quite lengthy. 
Yerevan is inclined to believe that they were primarily related 
to the fact that Azerbaijan lacks a coherent policy with respect 
to the CIS and, secondly, its hope to secure support in NATO 
headquarters and in Ankara, which Geydar Aliyev has visited. 
And only when it became clear that NATO is not disposed toward 
serious military support of Azerbaijan, and Ankara confined 
itself to purely rhetorical statements, was it decided to sign 
the protocol, although with some qualifications. The addition 
of the word "international" to the term "observers" apparently 
suits Yerevan and Stepanakert no less than it does Baku. True, 
the replacement of the definition "acquired [zanyatyye] 
territories" by "captured [zakhvachennyye] territories" does not 
seem just so unequivocal because this immediately raises the 
question of who exactly captured them. On this count, 
incidentally, Vladimir Shumeyko, in his closing statement in 
Bishkek, said that during the discussion of this point the 
Karabakh side agreed even to the term "occupied" 
[okkupirovannyye], but demanded the specification that these 
territories were occupied precisely by the Defense Army of the 
Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. At the time this was assessed as an 
aspiration toward indirect affirmation of status, and the 
formulation was rejected. 
  Even so, neither Yerevan nor Stepanakert so far has any 
official confirmation that the Azerbaijan side has really signed 
the protocol. According to Ashot Antinyan, adviser to the 
Armenian parliament speaker, "Apart from a telephone assurance 
by Rasul Guliyev, we have no other evidence about this." The 
speaker's aide furthermore expressed a certain amazement over 
the fact that of the two [authorized] copies [ekzemplyary] of 
the text of the protocol, one is in St. Petersburg, at the 
headquarters of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly, and the 
other is in Bishkek, and therefore it is not clear which of them 
has been signed by the head of the Azerbaijan parliament. 
Duplicates [Kopii] in such cases have no legal validity. 
According to Arkadiy Gukasyan, foreign minister of the 
Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, neither has anyone in Stepanakert 
seen the text signed by Guliyev. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Seyran Bagdasaryan, chairman of </F>
the special commission of the Supreme Council of the Republic of 
Armenia on Artsakh, recorded by M. Grigoryan: "Who Is Who -- Was 
Clearly Shown by the Meeting in Bishkek"] 
  [Text] As we know, on Saturday a news conference was held 
by the speaker of the Armenian parliament, B. Ararktsyan, where 
he told journalists about the meeting in Bishkek of 
parliamentary delegations of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and the 
Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, but the press center of the Supreme 
Council of the Republic of Armenia, for incomprehensible 
reasons, did not consider it necessary to invite a correspondent 
from GOLOS ARMENII to it. We asked a member of the Armenian 
delegation and chairman of the special commission of the Supreme 
Council of the Republic of Armenia on Artsakh, Seyran 
Bagdasaryan, to share his impressions. 
  The meeting in Bishkek, which by stretching things a great 
deal might be called negotiations, was planned back last fall 
during a meeting on the Aland Islands, whose delegation, 
incidentally, also came to the capital of Kyrgyzstan. A fair 
amount of weight was added to the Bishkek meeting by the 
participation in it of the chairman of the Interparliamentary 
Assembly of the CIS, V. Shumeyko. Since it was planned for the 
top people of all three countries -- the Azerbaijan Republic, 
the Republic of Armenia, and the Nagorno- Karabakh Republic -- 
to participate, it was suggested that the range of issues be 
broad and significant, the more so since the meeting was 
preceded, as we know, by a trip to Moscow by the chairman of the 
Azerbaijan parliament, Guliyev, during the course of which an 
agreement was signed for interparliamentary cooperation of the 
two countries. All this showed that the groundwork for Bishkek 
had been done fairly well. 
  But expectations were not met from the very beginning: 
Instead of Guliyev, Azerbaijan "jokingly" sent his deputy 
Dzhalilov. And this was when the night before Shumeyko had 
personally received Aliyev's assurances that the chairman of the 
Assembly would arrive in Bishkek the next morning. For Shumeyko 
and Shirinkulov this was, one might say, a "cold shower," 
exacerbated even more by the personality and behavior of 
Dzhalilov, who came as the leader of the delegation from the 
Republic of Azerbaijan. The explanation that Aliyev was in 
Brussels and therefore, Guliyev could not come was not taken 
seriously. 
  All this showed that the Azeris certainly did not come with 
serious intentions and were merely trying to take advantage of 
the meeting for their own irritating propaganda statements and 
tricks. Predicting this, the delegation from Armenia prepared a 
number of statements and documents in response. Unfortunately, 
our misgivings were confirmed: Instead of a greeting, the Azeris 
offered worn-out cliches about aggression, seizure of territory, 
etc., etc. In my view, this more likely produced the opposite 
reaction. B. Ararktsyan, conversely, in his speech suggested 
discussing all possible approaches in the most serious way. 
  A document prepared by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of 
Russia headed by V. Kazimirov was distributed. It was called 
the "Bishkek Protocol" which essentially in the style of appeals 
presented suggestions to participants in the meeting. I 
consider a key feature of the document as well, incidentally, as 
of the whole meeting, to be the appeal to the heads of the CIS 
states to immediately discuss and resolve the issue of creating 
a contingent of peacekeeping forces in the CIS. 
  But from the very beginning of the negotiations there was a 
fairly heated "dialogue" between the representatives of 
Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh, in which the delegation from 
Armenia was fairly restrained, thus emphasizing that the main 
problems lie on the plane of mutual relations of these two 
parties. Incidentally, there is no truth to the rumors that the 
Karabakh delegation was not allowed into the negotiation hall on 
the first day. The Karabakh delegation consisting of K. 
Babulyan and A. Gukasyan was very active, demonstrating their 
natural right to be called leaders of the Nagorno-Karabakh 
Republic and to represent it. 
  As for the Azeri parliamentarians, they basically used the 
same old cliches they used two years ago and a similar primitive 
approach could not but surprise the other participants in the 
meeting. 
  Be that as it may, work was started on Kazimirov's document, 
and if the delegation from Armenia fully supported it with small 
corrections, Azerbaijan from the very beginning started to 
demand that representatives from the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic 
be excluded from those who signed it. In my view, their 
behavior was based primarily on their refusal to accept the 
point about the creation of peacekeeping forces in the CIS. 
Such a "work style" on the part of the Azeri delegation forced 
Shumeyko and Shirinkulov to get together for a couple of hours 
with the leaders of the delegations. Essentially Shumeyko's 
authority was on the line and his desire to bring the two sides 
to common ground was quite understandable. But this looked 
rather strange if not ridiculous: Almost every hour Dzhalilov 
ran out of the office and disappeared into the corridor, after 
which he was almost forced to return (even, excuse me, from the 
toilet). And he would disappear at precisely those moments when 
it seemed that everything was ready for signing. After his 
return everything would begin all over again. Dzhalilov wasted 
time and, if I may say so, simply made fools out of all the 
participants, stating that he had to coordinate the text with 
Baku. 
  Unfortunately, as a result, changes were made in the 
document that weaken it a fair amount. Dzhalilov demanded that 
a point be included concerning occupation of 20 percent of the 
territory of the Republic of Azerbaijan, to which K. Baburin 
responded that he would agree under the condition that they 
specified precisely who would occupy it: troops of the 
Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. Toward the end of the meeting the 
leader of the Azerbaijan delegation stated that in general, he 
was not authorized to sign anything at all. In his concluding 
speech, Shumeyko clearly summed everything up, stating, in 
particular, that Nagorno-Karabakh had to be recognized as a 
party both to the conflict and to the negotiations -- without 
this, no solution would be found. The Azeri delegation ended up 
in simply an odious position and this, incidentally, was felt by 
its members themselves, with whom we had numerous meetings. Our 
opponents accused us of causing Russia to return to the region 
and this could lead to an encroachment on the independence of 
our states. They also suggested direct bilateral negotiations, 
but we know quite well what attempts at such contacts can lead 
to. 
  I think that now Aliyev is playing out the Western "part" of 
his policy, trying to straddle the fence. But his game is so 
transparent that only naive people could fail to see through it, 
and the response, it seems to me, will be appropriate for his 
policy. 
  As for the Bishkek Protocol, it is so weak on the plane of 
concrete content that even in Baku they considered it necessary 
to announce its signing. Nonetheless one can say simply that 
the Azeris lost in Bishkek--and mainly in terms of their 
political image in the world. And, conversely, the Karabakh 
representatives, who signed the document and committed 
themselves to a unilateral cease-fire, took the political 
initiative in the region to a certain degree. 
  At the last hour, speaking at a session of the Armenian 
parliament on 9 May, speaker B. Ararktsyan announced that the 
night before he was told by telephone from Baku that Azerbaijan 
had agreed to sign the Bishkek protocol.

  [Text] Dear listeners, we now present a report on the 
latest incidents in the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] and the 
border between Armenia and Azerbaijan. 
  The situation on NKR's front line continues to be unstable. 
Regardless of the protocol Azerbaijan signed in Bishkek, that 
Republic has violated the cease-fire by intensely firing on the 
Armenian defense positions with various types of arms. 
Furthermore, it has launched extensive attacks with armored 
vehicles every day. The situation in Mardakerskiy and Agdamskiy 
Rayons is tense. However, it must be stressed that the effort by 
the Azerbaijan Military Command Headquarters to take the 
initiative at the front line has not achieved its objective. As 
usual, the NKR defense forces have repulsed the enemy attacks 
and forced Azerbaijan's units to retreat after suffering 
casualties and losing military equipment. 
  A short while ago the NKR Defense Army Headquarters Press 
Service disclosed that Azerbaijan's military forces had attacked 
the NKR defense positions in Agdamskiy Rayon this morning. A 
wave of artillery shelling preceded their onslaught. However, 
they failed to achieve their goal. The NKR units rebuffed their 
attack and forced them to retreat after suffering casualties and 
losing military equipment. 
  According to the NKR intelligence units, Azerbaijan has 
begun 
to deploy additional military units in Mardakertskiy Rayon's 
northern areas. [passage indistinct] 
  An enemy infantry unit made up of 300 men attacked [place 
name indistinct], Yarymdzha, and [place name indistinct] in 
Mardakertskiy Rayon yesterday. Their attack was preceded by an 
intensive wave of artillery fire. Violent clashes took place in 
the region. The NKR forces not only blocked the attack, but 
also counterattacked. Initial reports from the area said the 
Azerbaijani units lost 60 men, while two men were killed and 11 
were wounded on the Armenian side. 
  Clashes occurred in the western side of [place name 
indistinct] in Agdamskiy Rayon yesterday afternoon. Meanwhile, 
the enemy shelled the NKR defense positions in the direction of 
the Omar Pass in the northern part of Fizulinskiy and 
Kelbadzharskiy Rayons with artillery. No one was hurt. The 
Armenians [words indistinct] return the fire. The military 
operations continued throughout the day. The NKR military units 
launched counterattacks. They completely liberated [place name 
indistinct] in Mardakertskiy Rayon. 
  In short, [words indistinct]. But no noticeable change has 
occurred in the operations zone. 
  The situation on the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan 
has been relatively peaceful during the past few days.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature compiled by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] INTERFAX has learned that a confidential meeting 
between Azerbaijani leader Heydar Aliyev and other officials and 
the plenipotentiary representative of the Russian president for 
the Nagorno-Karabakh settlement, Vladimir Kazimirov, could be 
held Thursday [12 May]. 
  Besides other issues, the meeting will focus on the date and 
agenda of the Azerbaijani-Armenian summit planned to be held in 
Moscow. 
  IF Note: In an interview with INTERFAX, Armenian 
Presidential Assistant Levon Zurabyan confirmed the possibility 
of such a meeting under Russia's auspices. He said pleparatory 
diplomatic activities were carried out through the mediation by 
the Russian side. As has been reported, the 
Azerbaijani-Armenian summit planned to be held during the CIS 
April summit was disrupted. Armenia has been maintaining that 
the reason for the disruption was Azerbaijan's reluctance to 
accept the Russian plan for the settlement in Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  In an interview with INTERFAX, Kazimirov pointed out that an 
Azerbaijani-Armenian summit could be useful on a rather advanced 
stage of consideration of the draft settlement agreement," based 
on the Russian design. 
  Kazimirov pointed out the main provisions of the Russian 
settlement plan. The first stage is "short, but crucial and 
complicated" -- the establishment of a cease-fire. The second 
stage involves a shift to the elimination of consequences of the 
armed conflict, including a withdrawal of troops from the 
occupied territories, exchange of prisoners of war, hostages, 
bodies of the killed, information of those missing in action or 
killed, re-introduction of the transport and power lines and the 
repatriation of refugees to their permanent locations. On the 
third stage, political talks on the future legal status of 
Nagorno-Karabakh will be launched. 
  "Whenever the sides are close enough to signing such a draft 
agreement, such a meeting in Moscow will be possible," Kazimirov 
was quoted as saying. 
  Zurabyan said the Moscow summit was envisioned by a protocol 
signed at the meeting of Armenian, Azerbaijani and 
Nagorno-Karabakh parliamentarians in Bishkek on 5 May through 
the mediation of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly. 
  IF Note: Azerbaijani Parliamentary Speaker Rasul Guliyev who 
signed the document with a number of stipulations came under 
harsh criticisms by the parliamentary opposition, the National 
Independence Party lead by Etibar Mamedov. According to the 
party, Guliyev committed high treason by signing the Bishkek 
protocol "together with the leader of the Supreme Soviet of a 
non-existent so-called Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, Karen 
Baburyan." The party said Guliyev "created all necessary 
conditions for the recognition of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic 
as a subject of the international law and open the possibility 
for concluding an agreement which would legalize the deployment 
of Russian troops in Azerbaijan." 
  In the meantime, Nagorno-Karabakh Foreign Minister Arkady 
Gukasyan did not preclude that the reports on Azerbaijan's 
signing the Bishkek protocol on the settlement in 
Nagorno-Karabakh on 8 May were another tactical step by Baku. 
In Gukasyan's opinion, only the deployment of peacekeeping 
forces was capable of putting an end to the bloodshed. 
  Azerbaijani Defense Minister Mamadrafi Mammadov, his 
Armenian 
counterpart, Serzh Sargsyan, and the Nagorno-Karabakh troops 
commander, Samvel Babayan, signed an agreement Wednesday 
midnight to cease-fire as of 0000 on 12 May, Interfax learned 
from well-informed sources from in Stepanakert. 
  Meanwhile, the Nagorno-Karabakh Army press service reported 
fierce fighting along the frontline, despite the cease-fire 
agreement signed. The press service said that after a heavy 
shelling Azerbaijani troops attempted to break the 
Nagorno-Karabakh defense near the village of Yusifdzhanly of the 
Agdam district at about 0700 Thursday. 
  The Azerbaijani Defense Ministry reported Armenian units had 
tried to develop their offensive on Geranboi and Agdam yesterday 
night.

  [Text] The Foreign Minister of the self-proclaimed 
Nagorno-Karabakh Republic Arkady Gukasian does not rule out the 
possibility that reports about Azerbaijan signing the Bishkek 
protocol of a settlement in Karabakh on 8 May is another 
tactical move on the part of Baku. He said Stepanakert has not 
yet received the protocol signed by the speaker of the Azeri 
parliament Rasul Guliyev. 
  In a Wednesday [11 May] interview with INTERFAX Gukasian 
said 
that in reality the Azeri side is psychologically not ready for 
the peaceful settlement of the conflict. He named as evidence 
the situation on the front-line where Azeri troops continue 
attacking Karabakh positions. 
  Gukasian stressed that a political settlement is impossible 
without guarantees of a complete cease-fire. He also declared 
that Nagorno-Karabakh should be recognized as a conflicting 
side. In his opinion only the deployment of a peace-keeping 
force in the conflict zone can stop the bloodshed.

  [Text] The chairman of the CSCE Minsk Group for 
Nagorno-Karabakh, Ian Eliasson, his deputy Mathias Mosberg, and 
the Russian President's envoy for settling the conflict in 
Karabakh, Vladimir Kazimirov, are expected to arrive in Baku on 
Thursday [12 May], Azerbaijan's Foreign Ministry told INTERFAX. 
  As INTERFAX learned from the State Counsellor for 
Humanitarian Issues, Gabil Guseinli, their goal is to review 
developments in the area of the Armenian-Azeri confrontation, 
and discuss further steps aimed at settling the conflict 
politically. 
  According to him, the guests will also visit Yerevan and 
Stepanakert. In Azerbaijan Kazimirov and the CSCE officials may 
inspect Azeri refugee camps, Guseinli said. 
  As a consistent supporter of a peaceful solution to the 
conflict, Guseinli stressed, Baku "welcomes the efforts of any 
countries and international organizations proclaiming their 
willingness to help in resolving the conflict and to undertake 
certain mediatory functions." Therefore Azerbaijan will welcome 
any steps suggested by the CSCE and Russia with a view to 
restoring peace in the area, the state counsellor said.

  [Text] Moscow, 12 May -- Representatives of the Abkhazian 
side at the Georgian-Abkhazian talks in Moscow have said that 
they are against the deployment of CIS or Russian troops on the 
entire territory of the Abkhazian region. They justifyg their 
stance through the fact that the United Nations has not yet 
adopted a resolution on the deployment of peacekeeping forces in 
the Abkhazian region. 
  According to observers, the Abkhazian side's stance is just 
an excuse in order not to compromise.

  [Text] The Georgian delegation at the Moscow talks on 
settlement of the conflict in Abkhazia decided today to finish 
drafting the agreement on cease-fire and separation of the 
forces discussed over the two last days. This was announced by 
a member of the Georgian delegation, First Deputy Foreign 
Minister Mikhail Ukleba in an interview with INTERFAX. 
  He pointed out that at the moment the document was not 
ready. 
Ukleba said it should be finished so that it reflects the main 
idea of ensuring the safe return of refugees and displaced 
persons. He added that this was the main purpose of deployment 
of the peacekeeping forces in the conflict zone. 
  Ukleba stressed that this did not mean the talks had been 
wrecked since the consultations would continue on Friday [13 
May]. 
  He suggested that the document would be prepared by 13 May 
in 
the evening. "I do not how much ready we will be for its 
signing," Ukleba emphasized. 
  In accordance with the draft, the Georgian and Abkhazian 
formations must be withdrawn for 12 km away from the Inguri 
River creating a 24-km buffer zone where the CIS peacekeeping 
forces would be deployed. They are expected to be formed of 
Russian military contingency. UN observers will also be 
stationed in this zone. 
  Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze stated in parliament on 
12 May that the talks in Moscow were "very difficult."

  [Text] Igor Akhba, envoy of the so-called Abkhazia to the 
Russian Federation, has declared that it is all the same for 
Abkhazia who plays the role of peacekeeping forces -- UN forces 
or CIS special units. According to Akhba, the key issue is the 
deployment of forces solely in the buffer zone. 
  The clause in the agreement on the deployment of troops in 
the conflict zone, unexpectedly for the Georgian side, was 
presented by representatives of Russia, the UN, and the European 
Union. 
  In the opinion of Georgian delegation members, the Abkhaz 
version of the settlement of the conflict suits the UN, the 
European Union, and Russia, because should CIS troops rather 
than UN forces enter the conflict zone, the issue of financing 
the troops will automatically be resolved as the CIS states and 
Georgia will have to undertake this task. 
  According to some analysts, Georgia's signing of this 
document could exacerbate the domestic political situation in 
Georgia. 
  Talks are continuing in Moscow.

<F P=106> [Interview with Polish Ambassador to Lithuania Jan Widacki </F>
by Gintaras Vinickas in Vilnius on 2 May: "Jan Widacki: `One 
Must Look to the Future'"] 
  [Excerpts] [Vinickas] There is a hope that the visit of 
Polish President Lech Walesa to Lithuania and the signing of the 
Lithuanian-Polish bilateral treaty will be a new beginning in 
relations between our two countries. What is your view on the 
prospects for such an opening? 
  [Widacki] The signing of the bilateral treaty was an 
important moment in the relations between our two countries. 
However, this was not some unexpected event, but the result of 
extensive preparatory work. I suppose that the signing of this 
treaty will be followed by a more rapid and broader development 
of ties. The treaty ends period and begins a qualitatively new 
one in our relations. It raises our ties to the European and 
world levels. 
  In view of the new relations, one should not think about the 
past -- mutual injustice and postwar grudges. Neither France 
nor England, or Germany think about them. Otherwise today we 
would not have either the European Union or other structures of 
this continent. I repeat once again that the treaty must close 
the past. One must look to the future. 
  By signing this document, both parties demonstrated their 
maturity to join the Union. I believe that West Europe has 
realized this. 
  [Vinickas] Signed agreements are normally subject to 
ratification. What procedure does Poland have in this respect? 
  [Widacki] If we seek to sign an agreement, we also want to 
ratify it. Each government wants this to occur as soon as 
possible. According to the Small Constitution in Poland, 
bilateral treaties are ratified by the president, and the fact 
is publicized. 
  The Polish Sejm ratifies those agreements, which require 
amendments in the law, or which entail financial changes. 
[passage omitted] 
  Poland does not see any obstacles, and if it becomes clear 
that Lithuania is ready to ratify the treaty, this will be 
promptly accomplished in Poland. There is no threat that the 
president will not ratify a treaty, which he himself has signed. 
  [Vinickas] Both Poland and Lithuania have people who opposed 
the treaty before the signing without knowing its contents. 
What would you tell those people now? 
  [Widacki] I think that these people speak the same language 
on both sides, and they need one another. Since they criticized 
the treaty without reading it, I propose that they read it very 
attentively. I am convinced that people who opposed this treaty 
will change their mind after reading it. I also believe, 
however, that someone will try to discern things that are not 
there. We already know the interpretation of one Lithuanian 
politician [reference to Center Movement leader R. Ozolas] that 
the treaty empowers us to return the former property of Polish 
social organizations. However, the treaty does say a word about 
this. He read what was not written.... I think that this is a 
psychological phenomenon. 
  [Vinickas] The situation at the Polish-Lithuanian border is 
like laughter through tears. So much has been written and said 
about it.... Do you expect the situation to improve anytime 
soon? 
  [Widacki] [passage omitted] It is difficult to say today 
whether it will be easier to cross the border, let us say, 
beginning in September. I think that the large flow of people 
is linked with a difference in prices between our countries. A 
few years ago, people would bring various goods from Lithuania 
to Poland, sell them there, and return with dollars in their 
pockets. The situation seems to have changed today: They are 
going to Poland with dollars for shopping. I suppose that when 
prices become equal, there will be fewer traders, who currently 
constitute the majority of people crossing the border. The 
crossing points may even be overly large in the future. 
  There are two border check points for cars and one for 
trains 
on our 100-km-long border -- such is its approximate length. No 
other border of this length has so many crossings. This 
situation is unnatural from the economic viewpoint. 
  [Vinickas] While on a visit to Lithuania, President L. 
Walesa 
evaded any comments on the current situation in Poland. A 
general strike was announced immediately after his return home. 
Even today (the interview was conducted on 2 May -- G.V.), the 
situations seems to remain serious. Could you comment on this? 
  [Widacki] Reform and all changes demand that society express 
its wishes and attitudes. Society must pay some price for the 
introduction of market relations and changes. 
  How can one introduce market relations and protect the 
community against their painful effects at the same time? One 
must find the golden mean between economic requirements and 
social needs. From the economic point of view, it is clear that 
a mine or, let us say, a foundry must be closed down. However, 
what do thousands of workers have to do? One must find the 
golden mean. While searching for it, one commits many mistakes 
and applies improper methods which lead to strikes. [passage 
omitted]

Black Sea Fleet missile-carrying Tu-22 aircraft are complaining 
they are not being allowed to fly. They say the explanation is 
the persistent suspicion of the local authorities. The 
Ukrainian Ministry of Defense says the pilots are preparing to 
fly the aircraft away to Russia. With the directness 
characteristic of the military, the aircrew call these 
statements complete and utter lies.

    [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian at 1625 GMT on 12 May, in its "Details" program, carries 
an eight-minute report by Sergey Dorenko on the Social Accord 
Treaty, showing first some extracts from today's proceedings of 
the signing of stage three by various organizations from the 
world of sport, schools, tourism and also women's organizations, 
and then extracts of what the opposition is doing to rally its 
supporters, showing scenes at a festival of the former DEN 
newspaper, attended by Aleksandr Rutskoy. 
  Interviewing Rutskoy in his study early today, Dorenko asks 
him why he is not at the Kremlin signing the Social Accord 
Treaty. Rutskoy gives his reasons. Asked about his plans to take 
power, Rutskoy says: "As you know, the deadline for elections 
to parliament runs out in 1995. That's the first stage. I will 
do everything to ensure that the majority in parliament -- not 
20 or 25 percent, but 90 percent -- are representatives of the 
Social Patriotic Party, the social patriotic movement. The next 
stage will be the preparations for the presidential elections in 
1996." Asked if he will be standing as its candidate, he said 
he is too modest to call himself a leader or an ideologist. He 
says that depends on other people who listen to him or read what 
he writes. "If I see someone capable of implementing these ideas 
which are set out here, then I will stand down," he says. 
  Dorenko states that "Aleksandr Rutskoy is preparing to 
disappoint his allies with the supposition that it is 
unproductive to have more than one emperor. This will hardly 
delight other leaders. Moreover, Aleksandr Rutskoy is capable of 
rapidly disappointing the opposition if he tells his allies the 
same as he told us about his views of the future structure of 
Russian life. Rutskoy advocates combining popular capitalism 
and broad state socialist participation." 
  Over further footage of today's opposition festival, Dorenko 
points out that Ruslan Khasbulatov was expected to appear, but 
failed to do so. Dorenko sums up the program with the surmise 
that Rutskoy has lost his opportunity, pointing out that he does 
not suit all the opposition hierarchy and that they may have to 
seek a candidate from "less problematical personages."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Belskiy] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 12 TASS -- Russian Former Vice-President 
Aleksandr Rutskoy called upon all opposition forces to unite in 
a bid to take power in the country. 
  Speaking at a meeting held today in Moscow "Izmailovo" 
sports 
complex, the leader of last year hard-line revolt in Moscow, 
said addressing leaders of different opposition parties and 
patriotic movements: "It is high time to stop arguing who is 
right and who is wrong. We have one objective, we have one 
motherland... Everyone must realise that unity is power now". 
  Rutskoy reiterated his declaration of May 9 that the main 
task of the opposition is to spare no efforts ensuring that "the 
next Victory Day (May 9, 1995) would be marked without the 
regime which rules now". 
  The meeting was attended by the most influential opposition 
leaders, such as Viktor Anpilov (Labour Russia), Sergey Baburin 
(Russian All-National Union), Ilya Konstantinov (Front of 
National Salvation), Generals Makashov and Achalov. 
  Meanwhile, Russian television aired an interview with 
Rutskoy 
in which ex-vice-president practically denied the proclaimed 
intention to come to power before next spring. 
  In the televised interview Rutskoy declared a contradicting 
plan according to which a would-be social-patriotic party, 
apparently headed by Rutskoy himself, shall win up to 90 per 
cent of seats in the parliamentary elections in 1995, and then 
enter presidential election race scheduled for 1996.

  [Text] The spokesman for the chairman of the State Duma, 
Dmitriy Biryukov, has said that the appeal by Former Vice 
President Aleksandr Rutskoy, made at the opposition rally at 
Lubyanka Square on May 9, in which he promised to mark the 50th 
anniversary of the victory over fascist Germany by "victory over 
the present regime", does not correspond to the "sentiments of 
millions of Russians who celebrated the May 9th holiday as a day 
of national accord". This is said in the Biryukov's statement 
sent to the media. 
  The spokesman is sure that under the difficult social and 
political situation in the country, "one cannot but recollect 
the promises given by those who were amnestied by the decision 
of the State Duma [no closing quotation mark as received]. 
  He said that some statements made on Victory Day "indicate 
that some people forgot their promises." 
  Biryukov said that the amnesty was not an unconditional 
action permitting further statements and actions. 
  He believes that public statements which could lead to a 
violation of the balance in relations between the authorities 
and the country's groupings should attract the attention of the 
Russian Prosecutor's Office.

<F P=106> [SEGODNYA report: "Sergey Shakhray To Be Deprived of </F>
Ministerial Portfolio"] 
  [Text] SEGODNYA has learned from reliable sources that 
even before his visit to the FRG began, Boris Yeltsin signed an 
edict on relieving Sergey Shakhray of his post of minister for 
the affairs of nationalities and regional policy. He will be 
replaced be Nikolay Yegorov, who is currently administration 
chief of Krasnoyarsk Kray. Mr. Shakhray will retain the post of 
deputy prime minister, however. All his deputy ministers -- 
particularly, Messrs. Kotenkov and Abdulatipov -- have also been 
fired. 
  Observers infer that Sergey Shakhray's removal may have been 
prompted by the increasing clout of the Federation components' 
political elites following local elections. In addition, Sergey 
Shakhray's successful efforts to obtain funds to implement 
programs for the North could not but encounter stiff resistance 
on the part of southern Russia's lobby.

  [Text] In is believed in the presidential administration 
that rumours about Sergey Shakhray's dismissal from his 
ministerial post are to some extent well-founded. A 
presidential administration official who asked not to be 
identified explained the emerging reports by the fact that the 
Russian Government had recently decided, with Sergey Shakhray's 
active contribution, to finance three programs for the north, 
which had seriously affected the financial interests of the 
south of Russia. Another important factor was the unsuccessful 
policy toward the Cossacks and Chechnya. In particular, no one 
had authorized him to conduct talks with the Chechen opposition.

  [Text] Moscow May 13 TASS -- The press service of the 
Russian Government confirmed that Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin had a 20-minute meeting with nationalist leader 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy on Thursday, but refused to give any 
comments. 
  "Government services refrain from any comments on the matter 
so far", a spokesman of the press service told TASS. "One can 
judge about the essence of the talk only from what the LDPR 
leader said", he added. 
  Zhirinovskiy told reporters after the meeting with 
Chernomyrdin that he had proposed to the prime minister to 
replace some of the ministers with members of his "shadow 
cabinet". 
  Zhirinovskiy is mostly against Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev and Privatization Minister Anatoliy Chubays.

  [Text] LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] leader Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy has ended a meeting with Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin by raising the question of the party's involvement 
in government management. 
  In an interview with Interfax, Zhirinovskiy spoke of 
offering 
three possible options to the Prime Minister. Under the first 
option, the LDP wants three ministerial posts in the so-called 
power structures -- defence, police and counter-intelligence. 
  If not, the party is ready to settle for the posts of 
justice 
minister and prosecutor general. 
  The final option provides for the posts of economics 
minister 
and chairman of the state property committee. 
  Zhirinovskiy said the prime minister would now contemplate 
the proposals while "we will also think of what position to take 
towards the government in future".

  [Text] The Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) is in 
favor of a one-party government and a multi-party parliament, 
LDPR leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy told students of the Moscow 
State University today. 
  Zhirinovskiy announced that at his meeting with Premier 
Viktor Chernomyrdin on May 12 he demanded that the interior and 
foreign policy of Russia be altered and the government's 
composition be changed. 
  "Currently, the government consists of people who either did 
not participate in the December elections or failed at them," 
Zhirinovskiy pointed out. He added that Russia must be ruled by 
a winning party meaning the LDPR. "I said all this to 
Chernomyrdin. Now we only demand that representatives of our 
party be included in the government," he stated. 
  Zhirinovskiy promised that as soon as he became president he 
would primarily eliminate the national republics in Russia, 
establish a East European union and order the power structures 
to fight crime within three months. 
  He said Moscow could show how to tackle crime. Zhirinovskiy 
proposed that Moscow be made a closed city for a six-month 
period in order to get rid of all criminal groups. He believes 
that such measures could be carried out in other Russian cities 
as well so that criminals be forced from Russia to the Caucuses 
and Middle Asia. "After this we will close the borders and here 
is the problem of crime solved," he reassured. 
  Zhirinovskiy suggested that Russia must take measures in 
order to lift sanctions against Iraq and Yugoslavia stating that 
they "need arms and we need food they could give to us." He 
stressed with regret that the present Russian foreign minister 
was working for the U.S.A. which was willing to make Russia a 
feeble country. 
  Zhirinovskiy said young people needed an idol and urged 
students to make the author of the book "The Last Breakthrough 
to the South" (ie. Zhirinovskiy) their idol . He emphasized 
that rock was the means used by the West in order to make fools 
of young people. 
  Zhirinovskiy called on the students to be against any 
revolutions, perestroykas and reforms since they did nothing but 
harm and were destroying the state. He found about 600 
listeners among students of the Moscow State University.

  [Text] Moscow May 12 TASS - Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's far 
rightist Liberal-Democratic party of Russia [LDPR] suggested 
conducting a police operation to clean sweep Moscow of 
criminals. For this purpose a special regime should be imposed 
on the Russian capital similar to the one which was in effect 
during Olympic games of 1980. 
  The LDPR faction in the State Duma suggested today that the 
parliament should consider a bill on the special regime in 
Moscow for a term of six months. 
  "During this period of time the government of Moscow backed 
by law enforcement bodies could cleanse the capital of all guest 
criminals and socially dangerous elements", a statement of the 
LDPR press sevice said on Thursday. 
  Zhirinovskiy's party believes such measure "will be praised 
by Muscovites who are living now under conditions of the 
unprecedented orgy of crime, violence, and hooliganism". 
  According to the press service, Muscovites "identify this 
orgy with the present rule of democrats". 
  Back in 1980, a few weeks before the begining of the Olympic 
games Moscow police and security staged a remarkable operation 
evacuating practically all prostitutes, tramps and petty 
criminals to at least 100 kilometres from Moscow. The operation 
was a success and carried out within a few days. But, of 
course, it was far less prostitutes and tramps in Moscow in 1980 
than it is now.

  [Text] Moscow May 12 TASS -- "We know who assassinated 
Deputy of the State Duma Andrey Ayzderdzis," said Chief of the 
Criminal Investigation Department of the Russian Interior 
Ministry, Lieutenant-General Vladimir Kolesnikov, at a meeting 
with journalists on Thursday. Kolesnikov heads a group of 
investigators responsible for solving this murder case which 
evoked strong indignation. 
  The general pointed out that the suspect had not been 
detained yet. In the interests of the investigation he declined 
to say whether the suspect was the culprit or a hired assassin. 
The general said that the murder was committed for a mixture of 
commercial, political and criminal reasons. The general pointed 
out that during the investigation law enforcement bodies 
established a whole group of people suspected of committing a 
number of other crimes. 
  Kolesnikov said that as soon as the investigation is over, 
the investigators will expose misinformation on the case 
published by the press, especially in part concerning 
accusations against regional law enforcement bodies. 
  As for discontent at the slow pace of the investigation 
expressed by the mayor of the Khimki region, Yuriy Korablin, 
Kolesnikov said that he would not let any officials put pressure 
on the investigation. "There are superior bodies to resolve all 
arising problems, for instance, the general prosecutor's 
office," Kolesnikov said.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Another Attempt on a Deputy's Life?"] </F>
  [Text] The shooting which occurred on the night of 30 
April-1 May involving independent State Duma Deputy Sergey 
Skorochkin claimed two victims. Duma Security Committee 
Chairman Viktor Ilyukhin informed deputies of this during 
yesterday's plenary session of the Federal Assembly's lower 
house. 
  He noted that the reason for the shooting was a conflict 
between Skorochkin and a group of people who, according to the 
deputy, "did not let the parliamentarian's automobile pass in 
the direction of his home" in the city of Zaraysk, Moscow 
Oblast. Skorochkin reported that after the conflict had been 
resolved one of those who had not allowed the deputy's car 
through -- Tbilisi inhabitant Irakliy Shanidze -- started to 
take an assault rifle out of his car. But the deputy managed to 
snatch the weapon, after which he headed for the local internal 
affairs administration to report the incident. However, 
according to Skorochkin his passage on the way to the internal 
affairs administration was again blocked by Shanidze, who was 
carrying another assault rifle. At this time local inhabitant 
Oksana Guseva was nearby. Shanidze shot at the deputy, who 
managed to get out of the way. But Guseva was killed. In turn 
Skorochkin shot and killed Shanidze. 
  At present, Ilyukhin stressed, the Russian Federation 
General 
Prosecutor's Office is considering whether Skorochkin acted 
within the bounds of necessary self-defense.

<F P=106> [Fedor Sizyy report: "There Was No Portfolio for Minister </F>
Travkin"] 
  [Text] It is no longer possible to find Nikolay Ilich 
Travkin in Shakhovskiy Rayon. He has left for Moscow, his 
secretary replied on the telephone. But to all appearances 
member of the Government, Minister N. Travkin, appointed on the 
eve of the holidays by Russian presidential edict, still does 
not have a working position in the capital. Just try finding a 
brand-new member of the government when you do not know what 
range of issues he has actually been put in charge of. Maybe, 
with his Hero of Socialist Labor medal, he is in charge of 
construction? Or maybe, knowing that he is closely associated 
with Stanislav Govorukhin, he is in charge of the fight against 
corruption? 
  A polite tenor voice over the telephone from the president's 
press service passed me on to his government colleagues: 
"Travkin has been appointed one of their number, after all." 
There were no further explanations. 
  At the government press service a surprised female voice 
replied: "What, has he actually been appointed?" On the off 
chance, I phoned around several more numbers of the service 
whose name anyway indicates absolutely clear tasks -- the public 
relations department. It is staggering that no one could tell 
me anything sensible. In my search for Minister N. Travkin in 
the vast "White House" labyrinths I resolved to perform an 
almost heroic act and phoned the office of Government Apparatus 
Leader V. Kvasov. His assistant promised to help me collect the 
necessary information. Alas, after exactly one hour I was 
handed on yet again -- to Sergey Surov, deputy section chief at 
the government press center. 
  "It was not the government apparatus that prepared the 
edict. 
What is more, it says that Travkin has been appointed a member 
of the government but certainly not a minister. We have no 
comment to make," S. Surov replied. 
  [Sizyy] "Is this appointment a surprise to you?" 
  [Surov] "Let's say yes. But I do not believe that the 
matter is closed yet. I think that you could get some kind of 
explanation from the president's staff," S. Surov said, bidding 
me good-bye. 
  People are now saying that Nikolay Travkin is the first 
minister without portfolio in modern Russian government history. 
And that his appointment has a direct connection with the 
Democratic Party of Russia leader's signing of the agreement on 
national accord. Meaning that the Russian Government is becoming 
a government of "those in accord."

  [Text] At a Thursday session the Russian cabinet approved 
on the whole a draft federal program for protecting the 
territory of the Russian Federation against the appearance and 
spread of dangerous infectious diseases of human beings, animals 
and plants as well as toxic substances. The program covers a 
period between 1994 and 1997. 
  The head of the State Sanitation Control Agency Yevgeniy 
Belyayev, who submitted the document, said that the necessity 
for the comprehensive program is prompted by the growing flow of 
migrants to Russia, the worsening of the epidemiological 
situation in CIS and certain foreign countries as well as a 
sharp increase in imports of poor-quality, harmful goods. 
  Belyayev said that in 1993 his agency had to ban the sales 
of 
1000 big batches of imported food. A total of 18.2 percent of 
imported alcoholic drinks do not meet medical standards. The 
same applies to 7.3 percent of canned food. 
  The official said that 11 cases of cholera were registered 
in 
Russia in 1993, all of foreign origin. In each case three 
million rubles were spent to prevent an epidemic. 
  The draft program provides for the formation of a network of 
sanitary control bodies on the borders, sea and air ports and 
railway stations. 
  At the federal level 77 checkpoints should be constructed or 
modernized in centers for forced migrants, 10 quarantine posts 
at railway stations, nine veterinary laboratories, 25 plant 
laboratories and 143 plant quarantine posts on borders. 
According to Finance Ministry estimates, in 1994 this will 
require 26 billion rubles of spending.

  [Text] Moscow, 12 May (ITAR-TASS) -- The Russian Government 
has approved the Charter of the Russian Telegraph News Agency 
adopted by the ITAR-TASS staff. It is this abbreviation, which 
has already become well-known, that has been confirmed by the 
resolution. 
  The government of the Russian Federation has become the 
founder of the state central news agency set up on the basis of 
the decrees by the Russian president on 22 January 1992 and 22 
December 1993,and organized as a state enterprise. ITAR-TASS 
has been recognized as the successor to the former Telegraph 
Agency of the Soviet Union [TASS]. 
  ITAR-TASS' main tasks are to cover state policy and public 
life of the Russian Federation, to collect and quickly circulate 
news and comments about events in Russia and abroad in all 
spheres - politics and economy, social life and culture, science 
and technical achievements, and sports. The agency's task also 
includes providing information to the state bodies of the 
Russian Federation and to the local and foreign media, 
enterprises, institutions, public associations, and citizens. 
  The resolution says that the founder appoints to the post 
and 
releases from the post the agency's general director and his or 
her deputies. In his or her turn, he or she approves the 
members of the ITAR-TASS collegium which defines the agency's 
news policy and its current and future tasks, and makes 
decisions regarding the development and the financial and 
economic activity of the agency. 
  The State Committee for the Management of State Property of 
the Russian Federation has been instructed to legalize the 
ITAR-TASS ownership of property which belongs to the state and 
property bought with money from the federal budget and used by 
the agency while implementing activity specified by its Charter. 
  Under the Charter, ITAR-TASS builds its relations with 
Russian and foreign legal and physical persons in all spheres of 
economic activity on the basis of treaties. The agency has been 
granted the right to participate in the establishment and work 
of international organizations, associations, societies, 
foundations, enterprises, and other economic entities in Russia 
and abroad.

  [Text] Moscow, 12 May -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin 
has congratulated the workforce of the All Russian Television 
and Radio Company on the occasion of its third anniversary, 
which is marked today. 
  "I well remember the first broadcasts of Russian radio and 
Russian television," the Russian leader commented. "These 
events were a true festival of democracy and glasnost, the 
enthusiasm of journalists, and the sincere desire to tell and 
show the truth. 
  "Not everything worked out or is working out. There are not 
a few problems, faced with which, I know, one sometimes loses 
heart. But stand firm and I am sure that you will succeed 
honorably in travelling the difficult path of our Russian 
reforms. 
  "I will never forget that many-hours-long broadcast of that 
awful October night [Russian TV's special all-night program 
during the conflict with the Supreme Soviet in October 1993], 
which has become a masterpiece of television. I bow before your 
courage and loyalty to your professional duty. I believe in the 
enormous creative potential of your workforce. I wish you new 
successes," the president of Russia stressed.

<F P=106> [Journalist Andrey Dmitriyev report: "U.S. Publisher Fails </F>
To Rescue NOVOYE VREMYA"] 
  [Text] The contract between the editorial office of NOVOYE 
VREMYA weekly and U.S. citizen Charles Bausman has been 
canceled. The "NTI" joint-stock company, set up jointly on an 
equal footing, will most likely be wound up in the near future. 
  The editorial office was forced to conclude the contract 
with 
the U.S. publisher last August as an alternative to the 
increasingly complicated relations with the "Novoye Vremya 
Publishing House," headed by Sergey Dubov, former staffer on the 
magazine and entrepreneur. The magazine's financial position 
deteriorated following Dubov's murder this February. 
  At the same time the editorial office leadership had begun 
to 
realize that the contract with the American would not bring the 
promised prosperity. The contract itself testifies to the 
naivete of the journalists who signed it and the U.S. 
businessman's romantic aspirations. The $100,000 invested in 
the joint business by the magazine and the $50,000 by Mr. 
Bausman personally is clearly an inadequate sum to revive the 
once-popular magazine, whose print run has fallen to 30,000 
copies. 
  Consequently the U.S. side's expenditure has already 
exceeded 
the $150,000, most of which went on the purchase of a computer 
publishing system, and the magazine is on the brink of 
bankruptcy. The contract has been canceled despite the fact that 
work on a new model of the magazine has been virtually completed 
and talks with a Finnish print shop have been held. 
  NOVOYE VREMYA, which is in debt to the MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA 
print shop and "Rospechat," cannot continue to publish the 
weekly's next issues. 
  The editorial office is counting on getting its affairs in 
order by subletting part of the four-story building it rents in 
downtown Moscow. An active search for investors has begun in 
Russian financial circles.

<F P=106> [By BUSINESS-TASS correspondent Robert Serebrennikov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 12 TASS -- "The approved state budget is 
more realistic than ever before: it offers an opportunity to 
follow an economic course chosen by the government as well," 
said Acting Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin, commenting on the 
Duma's decision to approve a draft law on federal budget of the 
Russian Federation for 1994 in the first reading. 
  "According to specified data, the budget was endorsed at 
194.4 trillion rubles for expenditures and 124.4 trillion rubles 
for revenues. The top limit of the budget deficit was estimated 
at 70 trillion rubles, or 36 per cent of budgetary expenditures. 
A decision was adopted to look into the problem of more 
rational use of funds envisaged as financial aid to subjects of 
the federation," Dubinin said in an interview with ITAR-TASS. 
  However, leader of the Russia's Choice faction Yegor Gaydar 
believes that the approval of the federal budget by the State 
Duma means that a negative tendency which appeared in spring, 
1994 will continue to develop. The essence of this tendency is 
a step-by-step increase in subsidies, growing expenditures 
envisaged by "investments and subsidies" articles with 
simultaneous cuts in social allocations, in particular, for 
culture, science and education. 
  In an interview with BUSINESS-TASS prominent Russian 
economist Grigoriy Yavlinskiy said that the federal budget in 
its present form will not change anything and the situation in 
the country will be the same as it was before. "Lawmakers do 
not realise that the budget is the money of all citizens which 
should be correctly used to prevent the situation from getting 
worse," Yavlisnkiy said.

  [Text] Russian acting Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin told 
Interfax Thursday that he considered the State Duma's passing of 
the draft federal budget for 1994 at first hearing as a 
recognition of the economic policy pursued by the government. 
  Dubinin said the collection rate of taxes fluctuated around 
60 percent at the moment, which is obviously insufficient. The 
Finance Ministry put forward a number of proposals to increase 
the tax influx to the state budget. In part, the proposals 
involve taxation bodies' registering all accounts of 
enterprises, including hard currency ones, and collecting taxes 
directly from the accounts. 
  At the same time, Dubinin pointed out that the tax basis 
shrank due to an economic decline. He said taxes collected in 
the first quarter of 1994 were equal to seven percent of the 
gross domestic product against 10 percent last year. In March, 
the situation was stabilized at last year's level, he added. 
  Dubinin supported further improvement of the existing 
taxation system which needed adjustment rather than reformation. 
"The existing set of taxes may be reduced, but not changed for 
another one," he pointed out. Dubinin put a special emphasis 
on the fact that the federation items had been granted the right 
to impose their own taxes, a right which it would be "very 
unreasonable to take away from them."

  [Text] Confidence in government policy has been obtained 
from the State Duma. This was stated at a news conference today 
by the acting finance minister. Sergey Dubinin noted that 
deputies' criticisms will be taken into account in the 
finalization of the budget. Therefore, he did not rule out the 
possibility of a future reduction in the state's administrative 
apparatus in favor of increased expenditures on science. 
Dubinin said that the government will endeavor to submit the 
1995 budget to parliament as early as September. Moreover, it 
will be drawn up while taking into account a reform of taxation 
policy. The supervision of all the accounts of enterprises, 
including their hard currency, will be more strict. 
  Dwelling on privatization, Dubinin said that it has not 
brought the budget any real revenue, since the ideology behind 
it was based from the outset on a free handout of state 
property. Forecasting the level of inflation, Dubinin noted 
that it would be under 10 percent. By the end of the year, a 
level of between 5 and 7 percent is quite realistic. In his 
view, the exchange rate for the dollar will not rise above 3,000 
rubles.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Ivantsov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 12 TASS -- The output of fuel and energy- 
carriers continues to slump in Russia. The production of oil 
dropped by 15 per cent in the first quarter of this year as 
compared to the corresponding period of 1993, the output of coal 
-- by 9 per cent, gas -- by almost 1 per cent, light petroleum 
products -- by 12-18 per cent, and electricity -- by 4 per cent. 
  In general, the slump in this sector of the economy remained 
at last year's level and equalled to 6.5 per cent, ITAR-TASS was 
told at the Russian Ministry for Fuel and Energy. 
  In expert opinion, the output of energy resources was 
negatively influenced not only by the general recession, but 
also by such factors as default of payments, which reached 19 
trillion roubles in the fuel and energy complex alone, regularly 
delayed budget allocations, and further reduction of 
investments. Along with general economic factors, experts link 
the dropping oil output of the recent years with the growing 
share of deposits on the developed oilfields that yield to 
extraction with great difficulty. 
  The marketing of refined products is another factor 
responsible for slumping oil production, because the consumers 
have turned insolvent. This explains the stoppage and closure 
of about 15,000 oil wells, which brought down oil extraction by 
approximately 4-4.5 million tonnes. 
  The fuel sector's financial "hunger" has had a negative 
effect on the processing of crude oil and the production of 
light petroleum products. Their volumes dropped by 15 per cent 
in the first quarter of this year as compared to 1993, which 
equals to more than eight million tonnes.

  [Text] Mikhail Shmakov, leader of the Federation of 
Independent Trade Unions of Russia, outlined in a letter to the 
Kremlin chief of staff and the chairman of the Yeltsin-sponsored 
Public Chamber, the Federation's own view on the Civic Accord 
which it signed in Moscow 28 April. 
  To begin with, the Federation says there can be no question 
of a moratorium on strikes. The unions, it says, reserve the 
right to collective action if the government fails to comply 
with accords on pay and work conditions, employment, and social 
security guarantees. 
  The Federation insists that the government must clear its 
debt of back wages in the first half of 1994 rather than later 
in the year and help keep intact the existing system of free 
secondary and vocational education, something that the Accord 
does not guarantee. 
  The Federation also demands that its special view is made 
known to the conciliatory commission and used as a basis for 
further talks with government officials on controversial points 
of the Accord.

reduced consumption from 5 million to 2.8 million tonnes last 
year, since bread is no longer being used to feed livestock. At 
the same time he noted that distortions in pricing policy are 
leading to a situation whereby bread is being produced in Russia 
using a calculation of 200,000 rubles [R] for 1 tonne of wheat, 
even though agricultural producers are selling bread at R70,000 
per tonne. The vice premier also reported that as of today 
stocks of meat, butter, and sugar are concentrated at depots in 
large quantities. In Zaveryukha's opinion these products are 
unwanted because many food products have been imported into 
Russia.

<F P=106> [Report by Yelena Berezneva: "Expect a Big One. Vice </F>
Premier A. Zaveryukha Promises Russia Will Have Its Own Grain in 
Abundance"] 
  [Text] At the beginning of May the bulletins on spring 
field work in a number of regions resembled dispatches from the 
front: 
  Rain in Kirov Oblast is proving a serious obstacle to 
sowing. 
  Equipment readiness in Novgorod Oblast is very 
unsatisfactory. One-third of tractors and trucks are out of 
action. The fuel and seed situation is critical owing to the 
tardy provision of credits. 
  In Bryansk Oblast a shortage of mineral fertilizers (some 
farms can only meet 10 percent of their needs) could reduce the 
grain yield by more than one-third. 
  The Orenburg farmers have won back some tracts of land from 
the spring floods and attacked the furrows, but the situation is 
complicated by the fact around two million hectares of scheduled 
fall plowing was not carried out last year. 
  The workload is enormous, while the countryside is 
experiencing more than just the traditional problems with spare 
parts, fuel, and seed. The main problem both for kolkhozes and 
for private farmers is finance and materials for the spring 
sowing which is already under way. But there are other problems 
as well. According to Buryat republic plant protection station 
data, a massive plague of locusts is expected in the fields. 
Modern chemicals to combat locusts have been purchased, but the 
treatment of the land has been delayed because of the shortage 
of fuel.... 
  Spring has brought some very unsettled weather to the North 
Caucasus, the Central Chernozem area, and southern part of the 
Volga area. According to Agriculture Ministry data, nearly 
one-fifth ( a little over twice as much as last year) of the 
sowings of winter crops in Russia is either dead or too thin. 
Winter crops have suffered most, as we know, in the breadbasket 
oblasts of Belgorod, Voronezh, Rostov, and Volgograd, and also 
in the Kuban -- between 29 and 40 percent. 
  It was confirmed by the Agriculture Ministry arable farming 
main administration that the pace of this year's sowing work is 
somewhat higher than last year. But because of the lack of 
money natural resources are slow to get to farms. Only 16,500 
tonnes of spring grain crop seed have been delivered -- more 
than 100,000 tonnes are required. Farmers are still missing 
one-third of their seed beets and one-half of their corn seed. 
  The schedule for supplies of lubricants had been only 
50-percent implemented by the end of April. The tractor pool is 
64,000 down on last year. There are 28,000 fewer plows, 44,000 
fewer cultivators, and 41,000 fewer seeders. 
  The land is being worked to death. By 5 May only 69 million 
tonnes of organic fertilizers had been spread on the fields, 
which is half as much as in the first four months of 1993. 
There has been a 50-percent reducion also in the liming of 
fields and the provision of mineral fertilizers. Fertilizer 
application this year will be 75 percent down on the average for 
1986-1990. For that reason alone the shortfall in the grain 
harvest could be 13-15 million tonnes, according to Agriculture 
Ministry expert forecasts. 
  Nonetheless, Vice Premier A. Zaveryukha's forecasts were 
optimistic when he spoke with journalists the other day. He 
announced that this year's sowing of grain crops is one million 
hectares ahead of last year's pace. Despite the very difficult 
weather conditions and unprecedented financial and material 
problems Russia will have its own grain this year. The gross 
harvest should be 90-100 million tonnes. The country does not 
intend to buy any grain abroad. The government is expecting its 
own commodity producer -- the Russian peasant -- to feed us this 
time. 
  If our commercial structures go about importing grain, that 
is their business. If the West provides some extra grain in the 
form of humanitarian assistance, no one will object. But the 
state will not spend a kopek more on grain imports, Zaveryukha 
stressed repeatedly. 
  On the one hand this optimism will seem to many to be 
premature and unwarranted -- the reports from the regions are 
very worrying, after all. Maybe he should not be forecasting a 
decent Russian harvest when the sowing campaign is not even 
over. The grain harvest is counted in the fall, as everybody 
knows. And we in Russia waste up to 50 percent of the crop, 
according to Academician A. Nikonov, director of the agrarian 
institute. 
  On the other hand I personally find A. Zaveryukha's optimism 
reassuring. Thank goodness, the government has at last found a 
voice, formed its own position: Make plans with the support of 
the peasants for a more efficient sector, beginning with the 
practice of providing harvest credits, right through to 
integrating production, the processing industry, and trade. 
  Four to six weeks ago the impression was that the executive 
authorities' eyelids would droop whenever there was a mention of 
a program to develop the agroindustrial complex, not reacting at 
all to the call to help a countryside that had been bled white. 
The government is no longer silent. So I would like to believe 
in harvest-94. No matter how unrealistic today's good forecasts 
may appear. 
  ...It is an amazing country with an amazing countryside. Not 
long ago the people feared that there might be no sowing at all, 
because there was no equipment, fertilizer, or seed and no money 
to buy it all. But no. Field work is in progress. And, most 
amazing of all, at a faster pace than last year.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 12 TASS -- "The Russian military budget 
of 37 trillion roubles, approved by the State Duma for the 
current year, does not guarantee the survival of the Russian 
Army, ITAR-TASS was told by head of the Defence Ministry's chief 
budget and finance board Colonel-General Vasiliy Vorobyov. 
  In the opinion of the Defence Ministry, all the articles of 
the military budget are underfinanced. Particularly alarming is 
the problem of cash allowances to servicemen. The Russian 
Finance Ministry monthly issues funds for this purpose which are 
not enough to pay allowances to one-third of the officers and 
noncoms. Under the new budget 50 per cent of the personnel will 
get their cash allowances with intervals, sometimes lasting from 
two to three months. "The situation is also alarming as regards 
allocations for armaments, military hardware, property, capital 
repairs and maintenance, scientific and technological needs," 
Vorobyov stated. 
  Shortage of money for the minimum requirements of the Army, 
the latter's insolvency has brought about a situation when some 
regional authorities have begun to cut off electric power supply 
to military installations, ensuring Russia's security. For 
instance, power workers of Archangel region had cut off power 
supply to a considerable part of the local strategic missile 
forces testing ground. Notifications are being received 
regularly by anti-aircraft defence units, including their 
central command station. "It is clear to everybody, even to a 
person poorly versed in national security problems, that such a 
situation is frought with very dangerous consequences," the 
general stressed.

<F P=106> [From the "Special Report" feature] </F>
  [Text] The Soyuz defense enterprise today [11 May] secretly 
tested underground missiles [podzemnye rakety] at the Moscow 
region aviation systems testing ground. So why is all this 
called an underground missile? 
  [Vyacheslav Kuriolvich, section head of Soyuz scientific and 
production association, identified by screen caption] Because it 
moves through the ground like other missiles do through the air. 
  [Correspondent] Underground missiles can travel deep 
underground, even in areas which are inaccessible for other 
equipment. There are three reasons why defense specialists have 
developed this underground apparatus. 
  First, a critical mass of used missiles has built up in 
Defense Ministry stores. This fitting [ustanovka] gives them a 
second life. The people who developed it made it in such a way 
that once the missile has burrowed into the earth, it comes back 
up again, and can be used 10 more times. 
  The second reason: Over the past 10 years, four explosions 
have taken place in military stores, as a result of which people 
were killed. So.... 
  [Kurilovich] This is one of the best ways of getting rid of 
weapons. If they just lie around, somebody will use them. 
  [Correspondent] And the third reason, also important: In the 
context of conversion, which has begun in Russia, and the 
related possibility of unemployment for defense industry 
workers. The (?Grab) underground missile promises new work. 
  But the (?Grab) underground missile is not the first 
development of this kind. Even during his first visit to 
America, Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev boasted to the Americans 
that Russia had developed an underground vessel which burrowed 
through the earth at a speed of 60 meters per hour. But all the 
tests were secret, because the military laid down secret 
communication lines with the aid of this apparatus. 
  The basis of today's underground missile system is the Grad 
multiple launch rocket system [MLRS]. Grad is a weapon of mass 
destruction with a 20-square kilometer destruction zone. 
  The service life of a Grad launcher is 15-20 years. The 
military think the underground Grad can be used for economic 
purposes, in particular for laying down electricity lines in 
inaccessible mountainous areas. 
  [Vyacheslav Vlasov, section head at aviation systems testing 
ground -- identified by screen caption] It is not only the Grad 
rockets, but certain types of air-to-air missiles [AAM] that can 
also be used for these purposes. 
  [Correspondent] Incidentally, it is not only the military 
that is developing uses for underground missile systems. The 
Moscow Aviation Institute has thought of an original (?Grab) 
system for burying radioactive fuel underground. 
  The Soyuz scientific and production association [NPO] takes 
the missiles to the testing ground in the Moscow region in 
armored trucks under guard. 
The military parts are detached from the barrel of the missile 
and replaced by a steel drilling head at the testing ground. 
The head weighs five to seven kilos, and just as in a normal 
surface missile there are 20 kilos of powder [porokh] in the 
underground missile. 
  So, the same safety rules as for testing surface missiles 
apply when testing underground missiles. Everybody on the 
testing ground during the explosion must be in a secure shelter. 
The shock wave throws huge lumps of earth many meters, and this 
is not safe. But an exception was made for NTV. 
  [Kurilovich] It's your risk, it's your life. [Words 
indistinct] the real shell flies 30 kms. 
  [Correspondent] The missile travels at 4 meters per second. 
The depth of the shaft can be up to 30 meters, with a diameter 
of up to 150 centimers. Isn't all this offensive for somebody 
who has worked a long time? 
  [Vlasov] Well, in theory of course it's offensive. But it 
would be even worse if they were to use these things for their 
original purpose.

<F P=106> [Article by Marshal of Aviation Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov: </F>
"From Reasonable Sufficiency to Sufficient Reasonableness"] 
  [Text] Today there is an excessive amount of talk about 
selling weapons: Should we do it or not, is it profitable or 
not, is it moral or not. The common characteristic of this talk 
is that it is futile, and sometimes harmful. 
  This is a matter of a state monopoly, and it should be in 
the 
hands of people vested with certain powers and, naturally, 
possessing high professional and civil qualities. This is 
essentially why broad discussion of the problem of arms exports 
is futile. 
  Another issue connected with the excessive boom in 
information about this topic is directly harmful, since as a 
result our rivals, clients, and ill-wishers get the opportunity 
to take advantage of this information. I am no advocate of 
covering up the disgraceful phenomena that take place here 
(dubious deals, the misappropriation of proceeds, 
unscrupulousness on the part of the participants, and so forth). 
What I am talking about is excessive loquacity, and not about 
the negligence of certain individuals, but about the essence of 
our state interests. Because while we are throwing up our hands 
in horror, sighing, and lamenting we may lose the market once 
and for all without ever having learned to trade. 
  And it is the sacred truth that we have never traded in 
arms, 
because we always supplied them on the basis of secret and 
non-secret talks between contracting parties' top people, often 
according to the principle: "Do you respect me, do you support 
my socialism?" And if you do respect me and support it, you can 
have a consignment of tanks or aircraft on a credit of around 30 
or 40 years (until the final victory of communism on the planet). 
  We garnered so much respect that nowadays many countries and 
regimes that respect us owe us several tens of billions of 
dollars which they are very unlikely to repay either today or in 
the future. 
  It is now very difficult to name the annual sums that our 
state used to make in those days out of arms sales and it is 
even more difficult to determine where the money went. 
Especially as for a number of reasons this question interested 
few people then, and of those who were on top of it, "some are 
no longer with us, and others are far away." 
  But the most important point was that this money was not 
spent on the reproduction of our industry, but frittered away in 
our struggle for a bright future on a world scale. 
  Since the latter half of the eighties there have been a 
number of trends and phenomena in world arms exports which 
Russia must take into account if it is to avoid serious losses. 
  The main trend of the "new era" is that the world arms 
market 
has begun to shrink both in real terms and in current prices. 
This stems from a number of political, economic, and strategic 
factors. The Cold War has ended (at present more in notional 
terms than in reality) and there has been progress in the sphere 
of cuts in conventional arms. The conversion of defense 
enterprises is under way (and not only in our country). 
Economic difficulties in the Third World countries -- our 
traditional partners in arms exports -- have worsened. UN 
sanctions have been tightened up, again mostly against our 
traditional and most solvent partners. Some importer-states now 
have their own military industry. 
  Simultaneously with this factors tending in the opposite 
direction, namely directed toward increasing arms exports, have 
emerged and are beginning to operate. New "trouble spots" have 
emerged on the map of the world. The world community and its 
numerous agencies have proved unable to settle conflicts by 
political means. The structure of demand in the world arms 
market has changed, and the market is now more geared to 
purchasing modern and state-of-the-art models of military 
hardware. Countries which in the recent past were regarded as 
arms importers are attempting (with some success) to break into 
the arms market. 
  Analysis of these two trends shows that, despite a 
reduction in the volumes of arms exports on the world market, 
the market will not vanish. Competition will sharpen, and the 
market will acquire a clear craving for state-of-the-art arms 
systems and technologies. 
  These trends have affected Russia from two directions, but 
their tendency is the same -- willy-nilly to squeeze Russia out 
of the international market. The first is based on "purely 
Russian" factors which we encounter daily and hourly: the 
general mismanagement and laxity which parasitizes on 
shortcomings in the economic reform and the controllability of 
the state. Its essence is that overly large numbers of 
"experts" and "specialists" in the delicate matter of arms sales 
have appeared in Russia since the early nineties. On the most 
plausible pretexts (social protection, saving producers, and so 
forth) they are setting up state and "quasi-state" funds, 
organizations, and other parasitical structures (on the 
principle that every cockroach considers itself a homeowner). 
  They have got their eyes on this "tasty morsel," are 
competing with each other to the detriment of our state, and are 
locked in covert and overt struggle against each other, with the 
result that clients are confused, the market is lost, and our 
country's prestige in the eyes of potential and actual partners 
declines. They view us as an unstable country, with all ensuing 
consequences. 
  The answer to the eternal question "Who benefits by this?" 
is 
clear -- our competitors benefit, as do all these newfound 
parasitical structures and particular (but numerous) individuals 
who do not care about the country's interests. They want 
profits, offices, imported cars, foreign travel, and more 
profits. 
  The aforementioned "purely Russian" features are certainly 
harmful, dangerous, and criminal. They must be stopped (rooted 
out) "by revolutionary means" -- I will not shrink from that 
expression. But there is another aspect which is just as 
dangerous -- dangerous in that in a few years we may find 
ourselves in a position where we not only have nothing to sell, 
we have nothing to defend ourselves with either should the need 
arise. 
  I will be revealing no secret if I say that our 
military-industrial complex is in extremely profound crisis 
today. The roots of that crisis go back to the late eighties, 
but it has emerged most clearly since 1991-1992. 
  The liberalization of prices emphatically changed the 
conditions of enterprises' economic activity, the main essence 
of which was the decline in demand for many types of output. 
Galloping inflation, the continuous rise in prices, and the 
ineffectiveness of the credit system led to insolvency on the 
part of the state and, of course, of enterprises. 
  This was followed by a sharp decrease in the volume of 
production of both consumer goods (especially metal-intensive 
goods) and military output (equally metal-intensive), which 
resulted in a sharp decrease in metal consumption by our 
industry. 
  I will cite just one example, that of aluminum. Aluminum 
production in Russia declined by only 8 percent from 1990 
through 1993, while consumption declined by 50 percent, but 
exports from Russia more than tripled. The regions received 
sales quotas. But, lacking trade experience, they began to seek 
middlemen, often dubious ones; the latter in turn began to find 
insolvent and unscrupulous partners (see the analogy with arms 
sales?). The market was flooded with aluminum. 
  As a result aluminum prices on the international market have 
almost halved ($1,950 per tonne in 1989, $1,000 per tonne in 
1994). 
  Thus less and less metal is being produced and consumed in 
our country, exports are increasing, and prices are falling. 
(This applies not only to aluminum but also to other raw 
material commodities.) 
  It is easy to see that unless this process too is stopped, 
we 
will be forced to close our production capacities and to switch 
to exporting metals, energy sources, and other raw material 
resources. Who benefits by this? Not Russia, of course. 
  By way of illustration I will tell you the value of certain 
goods in the international market. Reducing them to weight 
terms, 1 kg of a modern fighter is worth $3,000, 1 kg of a 
civilian aircraft is worth $1,000, 1 kg of electronics is worth 
$100, and 1 kg of metal shovels is worth $1 (the same as 1 kg of 
aluminum). 
  It is easy to see that it is very profitable to sell modern 
fighters, like other military and civilian products. They 
embody the highest scientific potential, the most complex 
technologies, huge labor resources, and the best trained 
specialists. It is not only stupid but criminal to destroy and 
lose all this. 
  On the other hand it is also unreasonable and unprofitable 
to support the military-industrial complex in its old form. 
Especially as the leaders of the military-industrial complex 
themselves not only are aware of but also understand the 
necessity of reform. Their only "shortcoming" is boundless 
faith in the strength of the state and its structures, where, 
though there has been talk of reasonable sufficiency in defense 
building and of the need for conversion, downsizing, and 
privatization, they have never answered the questions that are 
most important to producers: What to cut and by how much, which 
defense enterprises should be privatized, what to convert and 
how much, what arms does our Army need, what science and 
production infrastructure should be left for the future, how 
many production capacities should be modernized to produce 
promising weapons, and how many should be kept in reserve for a 
special period? 
  You will agree that these are the tasks primarily of state 
organs, not of the "Red directors," who are having an 
increasingly hard time between the hammer and the anvil, namely, 
between silent state structures and uneasy labor collectives. 
  The main shortcoming of state structures today is that there 
is no integrated concept for the reform of the 
military-industrial complex in the light of the country's real 
defense needs both today and in the future. The ministries and 
departments studying these problems (the Defense Ministry, the 
State Committee for the Defense Industry, the Ministry of 
Finance, the Ministry of Economics) are unable to resolve them 
alone. Gathered together, they defend departmental interests. 
There is no organ such as the Council of Ministers 
Military-Industrial Commission (which existed under the USSR). 
But there is a military-industrial complex that is flying off 
the rails, there are the remnants of our arms and strategically 
important raw materials flying abroad. 
  Thus it is easy to see that where we should be engaging in 
reform, survival, and rescue there are no reformers and 
rescuers, but where there is something to sell there are swarms 
of them, and, along with the economic damage, this is leading us 
to moral degeneration: People are being torn away from 
productive labor, gradually turning into storekeepers to whom 
the state's interests mean nothing. And this is just as much of 
a danger as losing the military-industrial complex. 
  What am I proposing should be done? First, in view of the 
creation of "Rosvooruzheniye," the state company for the export 
and import of arms and military equipment, all other 
organizations, structures, and funds must be debarred from the 
arms trade. 
  Second, we must urgently adopt a legislative and legal basis 
regarding the arms trade, placing this process within the 
mainstream of state interests and under the state's control in 
such a way as to ensure that both amateurs and "professionals" 
at making easy money cannot pass through the legislative 
barriers and enter it. 
  Third, we must elaborate a concept for the reform of the 
military-industrial complex which could be made up of a number 
of harmonized, coordinated, and interconnected state programs: 
an armaments program clearly defining our Army's real needs 
both today and for the future; a program of military-technical 
cooperation with foreign countries (especially with the CIS 
states) taking into account Russia's long-term interests and the 
potential and features of our traditional and potential 
partners; a program for the recycling and destruction of arms, 
military equipment, hardware, and ammunition that our Army does 
not need and that are unsuitable for the national economy and 
unacceptable for sale on the external arms market, tasking 
reserve production capacities with this, thereby also retaining 
the requisite number of them for a special period; a program for 
the conversion and reduction of science and production 
capacities or for tasking them with producing consumer goods on 
the basis of technologies as close as possible to military 
output. 
  Fourth, on the basis of these state programs we must carry 
out a kind of inventory of all the science-and-production 
capacities of the military-industrial complex in strict 
accordance with the concept for its reform and in order to reach 
a decision and leave the necessary capacities, convert duplicate 
ones, allow surplus ones to be privatized, cut unnecessary ones, 
and provide work for reserve ones. 
  Fifth, we must impose strict order in the sale of 
strategically important raw materials. I am convinced that if 
we carried out a total inspection of all deals regarding these 
materials since 1992 and returned all the financial proceeds to 
our country, the budget deficit would decrease substantially and 
the authority of state structures would increase. 
  There are a few special areas. Reducing the number of 
different models and versions of military hardware and arms. No 
country in the world can stand diversity here (around 100 models 
and versions of combat aircraft in the air force alone). Add to 
that the plethora of types of ammunition, fuels and lubricants, 
and spares. And you get a really mind-boggling picture. 
  There is a need for the strictest standardization. The time 
has also come to preclude the duplication that is all too rife 
in scientific development work too. There is a need for 
measures to shorten the time between projects on paper and their 
actual implementation, maybe even via the sale of these projects 
or developed prototypes to long-term and reliable partners. The 
proceeds could be used to develop and introduce new arms systems 
for our own use.... 
  The successful solution of these most important state 
problems, in my view, involves a switch from reasonable 
sufficiency to the principles of sufficient reasonableness, and 
not only in defense building but also in other spheres. 
  The aforementioned directions are largely organizational and 
do not require much material investment. They will take time, 
the desire, responsibility, and resolve. And they will bring 
savings and profitability. 
  But, of course, before that and during the transitional 
period the profound reform of the military-industrial complex 
and its upkeep will require considerable funds. The state lacks 
these. Therefore there is no point in waiting for something to 
turn up. 
  There is a great deal of talk at the moment about creating 
financial and industrial groups in the defense complex. This 
has its supporters and its opponents. I don't want to be the 
repository of ultimate truth, but I must say that, despite a 
number of shortcomings with respect to authorization to set them 
up, these are a kind of lifebelt for the military-industrial 
complex. And the potential shortcomings can be balanced and 
eliminated via organization and monitoring on the part of, once 
again, state structures and their organs without leaving 
everything to the hapless producers and all kinds of financial 
entities -- especially those with a dubious reputation -- that 
are dying to get their hands on them. 
  We need a plan, we need conditions, there must be a 
mechanism 
based primarily on state interests. For instance, we need a 
strict tender imposing certain requirements on banks wishing to 
be founders of financial and industrial groups. 
  On the other hand, we also need state aid to these financial 
and industrial groups: to some in the form of subsidies, to 
others in the form of exemption from certain types of taxes, at 
least initially. But at any rate the process must be regulated 
and controlled by the state. Because if the state leaves this 
to the mercy of fate, there are grounds for believing that these 
financial and industrial groups will abandon the state. And 
this too is not in Russia's interests.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "In the Interests of Developing </F>
Promising Technologies"] 
  [Text] The first sitting of the presidium of the Russian 
Academy of Rocket and Artillery Sciences (RARAS), recently 
reinstated by a Russian Federation presidential edict, has taken 
place in Moscow. Taking part in the sitting was Andrey 
Kokoshin, Russian Federation first deputy defense minister. 
  The Russian Academy of Rocket and Artillery Sciences, he 
underlined in his address, is supposed to be an important body 
bringing together leading scholars in various fields. Its main 
task is to develop promising technologies for weapons systems 
using artillery and rocket arms. Among these are a series of 
baseline military technologies that occupy an intermediate 
position, as it were, between basic research and applied 
development. 
  In the words of the first deputy defense minister, among the 
Russian military technology priorities is the creation of 
intelligent weapon systems capable of striking primarily the 
"nerve centers" of the opposing side's armed forces, and putting 
out of commission the enemy's combat equipment. 
  Despite the enormous difficulties of financing the defense 
needs, the Defense Ministry is doing all it can to ensure 
progress in these priorities. And here we have, in the past two 
years, a whole range of world-level achievements, Colonel 
General Anatoliy Sitnov, chief of armaments of the Russian 
Federation Armed Forces, pointed out in his address. 
  The RARAS presidium also discussed a range of specific areas 
of scientific research and development in line with the 
decisions made by the Russian Defense Ministry Council on 
Military-Technical Policy.

<F P=106> [Interview with Andrey Nikolayev, commander in chief of the </F>
Russian Border Troops, by Dmitriy Kholodov: "A Border Is a 
Relative Term. Border Troops Commander Andrey Nikolayev: 
"`Keep Out'-- an Absolutely Incompetent Approach" -- place and 
date not given] 
  [Excerpts] As he left the post of first deputy chief of 
the Russian Armed Forces General Staff "to become a border 
guard," Nikolayev is said to have "coaxed" many of his former 
subordinates to follow him. There are about 40 of them, who are 
called "watermelons" because they are green as border guard 
shoulder boards on the outside, but inside they are as red as 
army shoulder boards. They have brought along lots of new things 
to the border troop service. Nikolayev has tested new methods 
of command and control of the border troops by setting up a 
"mini-general staff," particularly the central command post, 
something hitherto unheard of in the border troops. 
Coordination between the army and the border troops has been 
established on the Tajik border. The practice of publishing 
intelligence reports on the eve of mujahidin assaults helps 
maintain a more or less peaceful existence. 
  Of all newspapers, the commander in chief of the Russian 
Border Troops has given MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS his first 
interview. 
  [Kholodov] Andrey Ivanovich, one of these days marks 
precisely nine months since you were placed in command of the 
border troops. This is a period sufficient even to give birth to 
a baby. Have you managed to push through any changes in the 
border service? 
  [Nikolayev] Even recently the Russian Border Troops have 
been merely a main service of the Security Ministry. It has 
been for four months now (from 1 December) that they turned into 
a federal service that, according to its status, is not simply a 
ministry, but an agency that shapes state policy in the area of 
border protection. Now the border is not merely a line where a 
border guard in uniform fulfills his service duties, but a 
frontier from which the state begins. [passage omitted] 
  [Kholodov] Are you subordinate to the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service director? Can he, say, "summon" you? 
  [Nikolayev] I report only to the president. 
  [Kholodov] In addition, you have become a member of the 
Security Council and your agency has turned from a command into 
a main command... 
  [Nikolayev] Not quite so. We are "the Federal Border 
Service -- the Main Command of the Border Troops." [passage 
omitted] 
  [Kholodov] The length of the Russian state border is 
60,932.8 km. Of them, 14,000 km (more than 80 percent of the 
land border) are new borders that have effectively not been 
formalized from the point of view of international law. In 
1993, 43 million people crossed the Russian border, which 
amounts to a 21-fold increase against previous years. 
  [Nikolayev] The very concept of border protection has also 
changed. The old "compression concept" said that Russia should 
draw back into its territory. It has a border and the border 
must be protected. But a question arose: Where do Russian 
interests lie? Where should its security be protected? We say: 
We must ensure Russia's security along its national borders and 
also along advanced lines within the Commonwealth. Why should 
we set up a new border with Kazakhstan that is over 6,500 km 
long? There is no infrastructure there. But everything we need 
is on the old border. Then why shouldn't we protect it jointly, 
defending Russian interests THERE? Internal borders within the 
CIS, however, should be made transparent. They tell us: You 
want to restore the borders of the USSR. But first of all we 
want to ensure Russia's national interests. The Russian state 
spent ages to reach those borders to throw them away overnight. 
  [Kholodov] Then, a question. Why should borders be 
transparent only within the Commonwealth? For instance, 
wouldn't Azerbaijan like to have a transparent border with 
Turkey or Iran? 
  [Nikolayev] Everyone says: We are sovereign. But Russia is 
also a sovereign state. We have presented Azerbaijan with a 
choice: Either it takes part in the joint border protection 
system that includes Russia, or we will close the 
Russian-Azerbaijani border, something we have actively been 
doing at present. They say: We want this border to remain 
transparent. Then ensure our interests on the "external" 
border, and we will not erect this one. We have already signed 
treaties with Armenia and Georgia. Russian border guards 
protect the border there and are financed on a shared basis -- 
50:50 with Armenia and 60:40 with Georgia, including soldiers, 
officer personnel, and contractees. Moreover, in the Caucasus 
we had to build a border in an unconventional way -- in two 
lines. The first one is drawn along the former USSR border. 
But owing to civil wars the Caucasus is currently oversaturated 
with arms and drugs; because of an open border between 
Azerbaijan and Iran everyone may walk there whichever way he 
likes. This is why we are setting up the second line of border 
control in the North Caucasus. This is not a troop line -- 
there are no fences there, only border checkpoints and 
operational units, including troops, that ensure control in 
between these points. 
  [Kholodov] Can you estimate how much money Russia will 
have to throw away on restoring the border? 
  [Nikolayev] Finances are for the most part Azerbaijan's 
problem. We, too, can take part by providing technical 
assistance. We are interested in having the border patrolled by 
aviation. And, of course, the Caspian Sea. If we fail to draw 
a clear line there at this stage, say, Gasan-Kuli-Astafa, then 
there will be a free zone inside the sea and everyone will be 
able to set up rigs even outside Astrakhan. 
  [Kholodov] And another "Putina" [anti-poaching operation 
launched this year in the Far East] will have to be launched? 
  [Nikolayev] I do not think we will wait for a situation that 
has necessitated "Putina" in the Far East to come about. 
Starting the second half of May, or in June at the latest, we 
will start combating poaching in the Caspian, Black, Azov, and 
Barents Seas. 
  [Kholodov] A global "Putina?" 
  [Nikolayev] "Putina" is not at issue. For instance, in the 
Kaliningrad area there are contentious matters with regard to 
drawing our sea border with Lithuania. According to 
international law, it must be drawn perpendicularly to the 
coast. The Lithuanians interpret this provision in a different 
way. So, a divergence angle is emerging. There is oil and gas 
within the angle. Large deposits at that. Today we sent a 
joint note with the Foreign Ministry to notify the Lithuanian 
Foreign Ministry that our ships will carry out border protection 
there. They are protecting not only biological reserves -- fish 
or crabs, as "Putina" does -- but mineral resources as well. 
  [Kholodov] As a matter of fact, the Baltic border has 
already become a legend. They say that Estonia ranks nearly 
first in the world in nonferrous metal exports that are taken 
out of Russia. Can't a stop be put to this? 
  [Nikolayev] When a civilian says -- "Close the border" -- he 
should bear in mind that currently 1 km of it costs 1 billion 
rubles. As for the Baltics, we must have a tight border with 
them. 
  [Kholodov] With dogs and a fence? 
  [Nikolayev] I would not say so. The form will be different, 
but some sectors will be covered by artificial obstacles and 
radar equipment. The dogs will be there, too, because at 
present a dog virtually cannot be replaced with anything else. 
  [Kholodov] But the Baltics, too, have once been a zone of 
Russian interests, haven't they? 
  [Nikolayev] A zone of interests is not only where our troops 
are present on another state's territory. For instance, in 
Belarus we do not have our border guards at all. But there is 
an agreement whereby Belarus, represented by its border troops, 
undertook to ensure Russian interests on its western border. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Kholodov] How do you see the future of the border troops? 
  [Nikolayev] I see them as a civilian agency that will 
include a military structure. The military function will not be 
of key importance. The main thing will be cooperation -- in the 
protection of borders with neighbors, checkpoints, operational 
work, including the exposure of criminal groups. 
  [Kholodov] Why shouldn't we set up a civilian agency at 
once? An agency that will include a customs service. After all, 
you are protecting the same thing -- the border -- aren't you? 
  [Nikolayev] I think that in the long run, in 5-10 years or 
so, their convergence is possible. But this is not a mechanical 
process. This won't do -- you, you, and you will work together. 
In the customs service, they have a different area of 
expertise. Although -- in exceptional cases -- we sometimes do 
take over customs control. 
  On the other hand, the struggle against smuggling. "Putina" 
-- the struggle against unauthorized fishing -- is a concern of 
the fisheries committee. But the committee does not have the 
money -- an entire fleet has to be deployed for this purpose. 
  [Kholodov] Does it pay, I mean what you have already 
deployed there? 
  [Nikolayev] It is even hard to estimate how much it pays. 
We are working for the long-term prospects -- to restore the 
reserves of salmon, crabs, and so forth. The border has to be 
protected anyway, whether they try to sneak in or not. But now 
we need to be economical -- we may well sell fishing licenses 
where the situation allows. I have told Viktor Stepanovich 
Chernomyrdin -- people should see the results. We should earn 
money. It's no use striking an attitude of a dog in the manger 
-- neither eat ourselves nor let others eat.

  [Text] The Pacific Fleet has changed the composition of 
ships taking part in the Putina-94 operation aimed at combating 
illegal sea fishing in the Far East. 
  Throughout several weeks of the first stage, from April 20 
to 
May 10, two trawlers controlled the catch and the use of fish 
resources of Russia in the Aniv Bay. They are to be replaced by 
two sea trawlers which will patrol in the Sea of Japan, Interfax 
was told by a spokesman for the Pacific Fleet. 
  During the first stage of the operation, crews of over 20 
Russian and four foreign vessels were brought to justice, 
Interfax was told by the commander of the Pacific Border Guard 
District, Major General Vitaliy Sedykh. 
  He said that about 700 vessels, including 200 foreign ones 
were spotted in Russia's economic zone. Of this number, over 
100 Russian and over 20 foreign vessels have been checked. 
  Besides the Pacific Fleet, taking part in the operation were 
vessels of the Pacific Border Guard District, vessels of fish 
protection organizations Primorryba and Sakhrybvoda, staff 
members of the federal counterintelligence service and of the 
Far Eastern customs department.

<F P=106> [Report by Pavlo Kushch: "For Full Happiness -- President </F>
Charodeyev?"] 
  [Text] During last June's political strike, Donetsk 
miners, having learned that the current generation will hardly 
survive on the promised five dollars [per month], were demanding 
early presidential elections. As of late April, the desire to 
hold early presidential elections remained unchanged -- the 
Abakumov Donetsk mine nominated Ukrainian Supreme Council 
Chairman Ivan Plyushch as a candidate for the office of 
Ukrainian president. 
  As for representatives of local parties and movements, they 
still hesitate to nominate their own candidates, except for 
left-wing forces. The Liberal Party of Ukraine [LPU] is not 
doing this, because its leader, Ihor Markulov, has not yet 
reached the age required by legislation to run for president. A 
candidate whose position is closest to that of the party can 
count on support from LPU. It has not been ruled out that 
Leonid Kuchma will become such a candidate. According to the 
well-known rule that from all miseries people elect the least 
painful, the former prime minister was most often named at an 
expanded coordinative conference of the Civil Congress of 
Ukraine [HKU]. Nevertheless, the HKU has not yet decided which 
presidential candidate to support, despite the fact that it was 
considering the nomination of former People's Deputy Oleksandr 
Charodeyev as the party's candidate. 
  Meanwhile, political parties are paying much attention to 
the 
local elections. The lead, as always, is held by the 
communists. For instance, at its oblast conference, the LPU 
nominated current Oblast Council Chairman V. Chuprun (former 
chief of the LPU Donetsk Oblast Committee), as a candidate for 
the office of oblast council chairman. Rayon committees of the 
Communist Party are not wasting time either. As candidates for 
rayon council chairmen, they are primarily nominating people 
with impressive party experience.

  A decision is now passed by a majority of 169 out of the

170 earlier. As for amendments to the Constitution, there 
remains the same norm as before, which is 300. 
  Decisions on the inclusion of issues on the agenda are

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] Presidential elections on 26 June may deprive the 
president, government and parliament of the political clout on 
the regions, President Leonid Kravchuk told the new parliament 
late on Wednesday [11 May]. As an urgent priority, he offered 
the deputies to consider rescheduling presidential and local 
elections until a later date. 
  Kravchuk insists that presidential elections must follow the 
creation of a proper legislative basis for government 
functioning and the adoption of a new constitution. 
  In his view, parliamentary approval is needed of laws on the 
presidency and local government before the elections can be 
held. These must provide for an executive presidency and 
sweeping powers to regional council heads, Kravchuk believes. 
  He also spoke of a risk that the presidential and local 
election campaign might lead to polarization and a bitter power 
struggle instead of defusing social tension at a time when "we 
are in need of consensus and tolerance". 
  Kravchuk believes that the danger of power erosion is 
increased because of the specifics of the economic situation in 
Ukraine whose predominantly state sector is in need of central 
government. 
  In his view, further experiments in government reform may 
wreck the levers of economic management while political 
instability push back the international financial agencies 
willing to provide economic aid to Ukraine. 
  "The dispute between Ukraine and Crimea are known to all and 
sundry. There is a risk that it may spread to other regions," 
Kravchuk said. 
  IF Note: Some Crimean leaders consider Kravchuk's drive for 
rescheduling the presidential election as a desire to try to 
cling to his office as long as possible. Crimean Vice Premier 
Yevgeniy Saburov said that "Kravchuk ought to have set an 
example of civilized behavior by stepping down in a dignified 
manner." In an interview with INTERFAX, he said that "a 
democratic changeover of government is when the politician is 
seen off with honors but not when he is driven out of power or 
tries to hold back to his office with tooth and nail." Stepping 
down in time is the main thing in a democratic society, Saburov 
believes. 
  Meanwhile, the rescheduling question is not even on the 
parliament's preliminary agenda. 
  The Ukrainian Central Electoral Commission reports that the 
following have received the 100,000 signatures required for 
registering as presidential candidates: President Leonid 
Kravchuk, Chairman of the Union of Industrialists and 
Entrepreneurs Leonid Kuchma, ex-speaker Ivan Plyushch, leader of 
the Ukrainian socialists Aleksandr Moroz and Education Minister 
Petr Talanchuk.

  [Text] A considerable part of deputies of the Ukrainian 
parliament do not share the opinion of President Leonid Kravchuk 
concerning the postponement of presidential elections scheduled 
originally for 26 June. This was said in an interview with 
INTERFAX-Ukraine by member of the temporary presidium of 
parliament Vasiliy Durdynets who was commenting on Kravchuk's 
proposal. 
  Durdynets noted that in the issue of elections "there are a 
number of questions which should be seriously discussed" in 
permanent parliamentary commissions and then the issue should be 
put to the vote. "I hope that the deputies will show enough 
responsibility and common sense," he said. 
  Leader of the Ukrainian Conservative-Ukrainian Party Stepan 
Khmara believes that the deputies will not back the president's 
proposal to put off the elections. In his opinion, the 
president's appeal makes him "seem simply weak and helpless," 
"his unconvincing arguments are simply ridiculous." 
  "We consider it necessary to postpone the elections until 
the 
end of the year, because the presidential campaign today could 
disturb peace in the country," chairman of the All-Ukrainian 
Society Prosvita Pavlo Movchan stated. However, that does not 
mean that Prosvita supports Kravchuk's candidacy, he added. "He 
has made enough mistakes and senseless actions." 
  One of the leaders of the Ukrainian Communist Party Boris 
Oleynik said that there is a certain sense in arguments in favor 
of the postponement. In his opinion, that may violate the 
balance in society. 
  At the same time, Oleynik said, the faction of Communists 
believes that "there should be no violations of the law--the 
elections should take place." 
  "In the president's proposal we don't see the main thing we 
are looking for--an explanation of what he is going to do before 
the elections if they are postponed," leader of the major 
faction of the old parliament Novaya Rada Ivan Zayets told 
INTERFAX-Ukraine. In his opinion, the elections will not be 
postponed.

<F P=106> [Report by Yuliya Pshenko: "Yaroslav Kendzyor Calls on </F>
Ukrainian Patriots To Send All Forces Against Kuchma"] 
  [Text] Ukrainian People's Deputy Yaroslav Kendzyor, at a 
news conference held at the Lvov Mayoralty, divided deputies of 
the new parliament into four tentative blocs. Thus, according 
to Yaroslav Kendzyor, the first bloc -- purely communist -- 
comprises 138 deputies. The second one, "left center," which 
was named by him, is composed of deputies from the so-called 
"party of power," as well as deputies from the Party of 
Democratic Revival of Ukraine and the Labor Party, and it 
comprises 72 legislators. The right center comprises 53 
deputies from Rukh and the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists. 
Only five people's deputies comprise the right wing. These are 
representative of the Ukrainian Conservative Republican Party 
and the Ukrainian National Self-Defense. 
  Yaroslav Kendzyor believes that if the left and right wings 
of the center unite, they will have the same number of deputies 
as the communist bloc. Therefore, a battle for so-called 
independent deputies will be waged in parliament. 
  Commenting on the presidential elections, Yaroslav Kendzyor 
said that "the candidacy of Leonid Kuchma is the most 
dangerous." Moreover, Yaroslav Kendzyor confidently told 
journalists that "there have been reports that Kuchma will be 
supported in the elections by certain political and business 
circles in the United States." He also called on all Ukrainian 
patriots to vote for a candidate who will be able to strip 
Kuchma of as many votes as possible.

<F P=106> [Report by Tatyana Korobova: "Crimean Communist Leader </F>
Announces His Opposition to Meshkov"] 
  [Text] The news conference, which was unexpectedly called 
by Crimean Communist leader Leonid Grach, generated a sort of 
furor because -- for the first time since the presidential 
elections, during a time of euphoria, which was cooling down but 
still alive -- a force declared its open opposition to the new 
authorities. Currently, the Communist Party of Crimea [KPK] has 
some 48,000 members. Leonid Grach received more than 13 percent 
of the vote and ranked third in the presidential elections. In 
the Supreme Soviet elections, communists were supported by fewer 
voters -- they won only two out of 14 seats -- because voters, 
in general, voted for "Russia's Bloc." The development of 
events in the Crimea finally upset the KPK, and Grach voiced 
concern over this very fact after the news conference. 
  We have learned about Meshkov's plans to reform the 
executive 
bodies -- to liquidate executive commissions within the local 
soviets and nominate interim heads of administrations. Grach 
believes that this "destruction of some old bodies will at least 
bring about some order in the state." 
  Communists voice doubts over the moves of the new government 
(half of this government consists of Moscow residents). In the 
opinion of Leonid Grach, "they are failures in science and, to a 
greater extent, failures in practice." 
  The management is experiencing a vertical split, the 
government is going to manage the state through duty-shifts 
[vakhtovyy metod]. The KPK cannot, in Grach's opinion, remain 
aloof when "the Crimea is undergoing humiliating experiments." 
Moreover, management "has not only been left without a local 
staff, but the basis for an open `witch-hunt' has been 
prepared." The depth and tragedy of this precipice, into which 
Crimea is headed, are both deepening, according to Grach, due to 
the government's inefficiency, the president's lack of 
competence, and a generally low level of education (in the 
sphere of legal knowledge within the state). Those, who learned 
the classic adage -- divide and conquer -- take advantage of 
this situation. "I state with full responsibility that if a 
shot is fired in the Crimea, it will not be the result of 
political or interethnic tensions. Residents of the Crimea 
should understand: They will be armed to fight for ownership," 
said Grach. Having rebuked Yevgeniy Saburov for the 
"anticommunist yearning after the Moscow model," Grach voiced 
surprise over the government's immense expenditures on their own 
needs, and said that their holiday hotel "More" -- their 
headquarters in Alushta -- was built as an imitation of the 
Zavidovo Hotel in Moscow. 
  Leonid Grach is convinced that, despite the utmost discord 
between Kravchuk and Meshkov and lack of direct contacts between 
Yeltsin and Meshkov, they are objectively assisting one another. 
Kravchuk believes that the worse the situation in the Crimea is, 
the better for him, while Russia simply behaves like an owner in 
the Crimea. As to the question of why Russia behaves like an 
owner in the Crimea, Grach answers without thinking: "Shokhin's 
Russia." 
  The KPK leader also confirmed that communists, who during 
the 
elections had supported Meshkov with some reservations, 
currently represent an opposition because "they cannot sacrifice 
anything -- except rallies, tents, and rejected resolutions -- 
to the fatherland." 
  Reiterating that the Crimea will not overcome the economic 
crisis alone and the union of fraternal republics should be 
restored on a new basis, Leonid Grach said that the KPK 
considers Leonid Kuchma the most proper candidate for Ukrainian 
president.

  [Text] Representatives of Crimean political and public 
organizations continue to picket the Ukrainian Supreme Council 
building in Kiev. Here is our correspondent, Igor Kulinichenko, 
reporting from the site. 
  [Begin recording] [Kulinichenko] The picket near the Supreme 
Council building is in progress. It is being conducted by 
representatives of political organizations who came here from 
the Crimea. I see slogans that read: Get Russian military bases 
out of our Crimea! Cancel Crimean autonomy -- Threat to 
Ukrainian statehood! Stop Mafia from seizing power in the 
Crimea! We protest against sale of Sevastopol, a Ukrainian 
naval base! Only Ukrainian laws and Constitution should govern 
the Crimea! Protect Crimean Ukrainians against self-will of 
Meshkov and his clique! -- and many other slogans. People are 
really demanding these things. I am going to go over to one of 
the protesters and ask him to introduce himself. 
  [Vlasenko] My name is Pavlo Vlasenko. I am deputy chairman 
of 
the All-Ukrainian Prosvita [Education] Society. 
  [Kulinichenko] First of all, what do you think we should do 
to make all people in the Crimea, including Crimean Ukrainians, 
happy about the policies pursued by the Crimean parliament and 
the government of Yuriy Meshkov? 
  [Vlasenko] It is impossible to make everyone happy. We 
should do what is warranted by international laws and Ukrainian 
interests. That is what we should do. The Ukrainian people, who 
have more rights to this than those who kick up a row. [sentence 
as heard] We believe that first and foremost, one should bring 
all of Crimean legislation in line with Ukrainian laws. Second, 
we believe that the previous Supreme Council made a mistake when 
it agreed to autonomy in the first place. It should be revoked. 
Or, if it is not revoked, one should at least introduce 
presidential rule in the Crimea. Because, given the present 
situation, the government invited from Moscow by Meshkov is out 
to completely rob Ukraine, through the Crimea. The methods of 
governing which they are proposing, such as the watch method and 
so on, humiliate us as Ukrainian citizens. Do we not have 
intelligent people? Of course, we do. Why should Moscow rule 
us? Foreign troops must be withdrawn. We consider Russian 
troops to be foreign troops in the Crimea. They should be 
pulled out immediately. The Black Sea Fleet issue must be 
resolved. We consider Sevastopol a Ukrainian city. We are not 
the only ones who think so. The principle of inviolability of 
borders should be preserved and strengthened, first of all, by a 
decision of the Ukrainian Supreme Council. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko and </F>
Mikhail Melnik] 
  [Text] Kiev 12 May TASS -- The Ukrainian parliament voted 
today to reject mandates to two of the 338 newly-elected 
deputies, president of the international foundation "Ukraine's 
Business Diaspora" Vladimir Grinev and president of the concern 
"Blasko -- Black Sea Shipping Lines" Pavel Kudyukin. 
  The parliament decision can be described as highly 
controversial and leaving many questions open. Actually, the 
two deputies sort of fell a victim to the imperfect election law 
which, in particular, stipulates that elections should be held 
on an alternative basis. In case in question, Grinev's and 
Kudyukin's rivals, who polled less votes in the first round of 
parliamentary elections, withdrew three days before the second 
round. Nevertheless, the Central Election Committee authorized 
the second round, which brought both deputies into Ukraine's 
parliament. But the Credentials Committee qualified the case as 
an irregularity, and the parliamentary session voted to deny 
deputy's mandates to the two candidates. 
  On the face of it, the parliament decision cannot be 
questioned. However, two more deputies found themselves in a 
similar situation. These are Ivan Vasyura, head of the 
collective agricultural enterprise in the Cherkasy region, and 
Oleg Panasovskiy, director of the Uglegorsk thermal plant. 
Describing them as "good lads," the session approved their 
deputy's mandates. 
  Such a different approach can be accounted for by Grinev's 
and Kudyukin's "naughtiness." 
  Grinev is known to be a prominent reformer. Earlier, he 
stepped down as deputy parliament speaker because he could not 
agree with the line pursued by the parliament. As a co-chairman 
of the inter-regional reform bloc, he criticized the government 
and parliament, accusing them of being incapable of pulling the 
country out of crisis. Certainly, far from everybody liked 
this, including many current lawmakers. 
  Black-sea trouble-maker Pavel Kudyukin is notorious for the 
much- spoken-about "Blasco" scandal. Lawmakers remember 
numerous inspections of the activities of the shipping lines 
management, which was accused of wasting the fleet's assets and 
embezzling large sums in hard currency. However, the case was 
not brought to court. 
  Thus, Ukrainian lawmakers were guided today by personal 
considerations rather than by law. But what should voters do in 
this situation?

  [Text] A capsule containing Cesium-137, a highly 
radioactive substance, was stolen from the incineration workshop 
of a facility in the Ukrainian city of Nikolayev about two days 
ago, a correspondent for INTERFAX-Ukraine reports. Police have 
so far failed to track down either the culprits or the capsule 
which is believed to have been sawn up. 
  Spokesman for the Ukrainian security services Anatoliy 
Sakhno 
described the incident as very serious indeed. 
  Three of the plant employees have been sent for medical 
treatment in Kharkov and Kiev following symptoms of exposure to 
excessive radiation and about ten others are examined locally. 
  Unconfirmed reports speak of background radiation levels on 
the plant's premises rising. It is believed that parts of the 
capsule may have been thrown in the plant's water reservoir.

  [Text] The Ukrainian cabinet has passed a resolution on 
efforts to stabilize power supplies in the economy. In keeping 
with the resolution the State Committee for Nuclear Energy 
should guarantee the commissioning of power units at Rovno, 
Khmelnitsky and Zaporozhye nuclear power stations on time. It 
also provides for the commissioning of facilities to extract and 
process uranium ore and produce zirconium. 
  The state committee should draft a plan of forming a 
currency 
fund for purchasing equipment and licences for the producing 
nuclear fuel and storing wastes through exporting electricity 
generated at nuclear plants. 
  Earlier the Deputy Chairman of the state committee Nur 
Nigmatulin told INTERFAX-Ukraine that even with the 14 
functioning nuclear power units Ukraine suffers from electricity 
shortages. According to him, to cover the deficit Ukraine has 
to commission six reactors at Khmelnitsky, Rovno and Zaporozhye 
stations, which will require over 1 billion dollars.

<F P=106> [Report by Valeriy Polyushko: "According to U.S. Satellite </F>
Surveillance, There Is a Huge Oil Deposit in Priazovye"] 
  [Text] A representative of a Texas oil company paid an 
unexpected visit to Priazovye rayon, in Zaporozhye Oblast. At a 
meeting with local authorities, he stated that according to U.S. 
satellite surveillance, there is a huge oil field in this rayon 
and the adjacent stretch of Azov Sea, no smaller than the famous 
field in Kuwait. N. Ormandzhi, deputy chairman of the oblast 
administration, told a ZAPORIZKA PRAVDA correspondent that the 
U.S. oil expert had offered Zaporozhye residents assistance in 
surveying oil deposits, which he believes, lie about 1.5 km 
below the surface. CIS-made drilling equipment cannot drill 
deeper than 500 meters. 
  In the words of the guest, his company, if a relevant 
agreement is signed, is ready to immediately allocate $10 
million for exploratory and test drillings, and will demand no 
compensation in the event of a negative result. 
  After the American toured the region, he asked for some 
preliminary documentation, and promised to return in May. By 
that time, the authorities need to make a decision. 
  However, the "Krymgeologiya" and presidential representative 
in Priazovye rayon, N. Kalayanov, is very much in doubt that 
there are oil deposits in the region. On the other hand, some 
20 years ago, local residents often found some greasy liquid in 
local rivers, the color and smell of which was reminiscent of 
oil condensate that is always found near oil deposits. 
  While it remains to be seen whether U.S. experts will find 
oil in the rayon, natural gas has already been found here, and 
plenty of it. According to N. Oramndzhi, the size of gas 
deposits may amount to 5 billion cubic meters -- or even larger, 
because the 100-meter-deep layer runs way beyond the rayon's 
boundary. 
  The "Krymgeologiya" state enterprise, with which the state 
administration signed an agreement, has already started drilling 
12 wells. Each of the wells will enable extraction of as much 
as 1,000 cubic meters of gas per day. Experts estimate that 
construction costs of those wells, 1.8 billion rubles, will be 
earned back within eight months. Those estimates are well 
grounded -- back in 1936, the first experimental gas-filling 
station in the country was built in Priazovye rayon, and it 
supplied natural gas to boiler-houses and automobiles until 1950. 
  So, gas is already in the rayon. There might also be oil. 
Moneybags from Texas would not throw their money down the drain.

  [Text] Kiev 13 May TASS -- A plan for socio-economic 
development of Ukraine in 1995 aims primarily at overcoming 
inflation, stabilizing economic output, and raising the people's 
living standards. 
  The plan was considered on Thursday [12 May] at a session of 
the collegium of the Ukrainian Economics Ministry. It also 
highlights demonopolizing national economy; fostering small 
businesses; forming stock market and implementing agricultural 
reform. 
  The participants in the session also discussed a national 
programme called "Ukraine's oil and gas -- 2010", which provided 
for a comprehensive evaluation of opportunities to increase both 
national oil and gas production and reserves. 
  At present, Ukraine's own gas and oil production may meet 9 
to 11 percent (4 mln tonnes) of its oil consumption needs and 18 
to 20 percent (18 bln cubic meters) of its gas consumption needs. 
  An effective use of its natural resources may enable Ukraine 
to stabilize and, in the long run, increase its oil and gas 
production to a measure.

  [Text] Creation of the standing legislative Commission for 
Military Issues, Security, and Protection of Servicemen's Rights 
became a sensation at yesterday's session of the Crimean Supreme 
Soviet. A report delivered by Mykhaylo Kukushkin, head of the 
commission and commander of the Black Sea Fleet Air Force 
Administration, shows that the commission will be seeking 
substantial powers. In his words, the deputies should watch the 
movements of all troops on Crimean territory. All military 
exercises in the Crimea and visits by military ships to local 
ports can only be conducted when permitted by the Crimean 
president. The new commission intends to assume control over 
the activities of the Crimean Security Service.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Be Careful General! You Are Not at </F>
Maneuvers..."] 
  [Text] On 29 April, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry 
Collegium held a meeting. During the meeting, important issues 
concerning military life were discussed. According to a 
reliable source, after the chairman summed up the meeting and 
set objectives, a very excited Major General Vladimir Petenko, 
the president's adviser for military issues, appeared in the 
room. The supreme commander's envoy made a curious proposal to 
the generals present in the room -- to initiate in the military 
the emergency collection of signatures supporting the present 
head of state as a presidential candidate. 
  This appeal bewildered the top brass just a little bit. Many 
generals surely recalled the old good times when the high staff 
would send an instruction suggesting (!) that they ensure active 
participation of the personnel in some social or political 
event. This was a written document, while an oral "supplement" 
specified the exact degree of "support," which the commander had 
to provide, no matter what. 
  Now, everything is handled more elegantly; no one is sending 
any dictates. Instead, they provide oral instructions uttered 
in a commanding tone. But have those people bothered to think 
what a disservice they are doing to the president? How will 
those directives be met in the military -- by the 70,000 
officers and warrant officers who have been left without a place 
to live and spend half of their miserable salary on rent? What 
should soldiers -- the main "supporters" -- feel when they 
cannot even buy a decent tube of toothpaste with their 
allowances? 
  Yes, organizers of this undertaking should have first 
thought 
what they think this Army really is -- the defender of the 
Homeland or a group of people who can be manipulated at will?

  [Text] Simferopol [no date as received] -- Mykhaylo 
Kukushkin, chairman of the Republic of Crimea Supreme Council 
Commission for Military Issues, Security, and Servicemen's 
Protection and chief of a Black Sea Fleet naval directorate, 
told journalists: "We do not need the units and subunits of the 
National Guard of Ukraine that are deployed on our territory. 
What we do need is to form the Republican Guard of Crimea only 
from the peninsula's citizens. I am convinced that the deputies 
will support me in this." In Mykhaylo Kukushkin's words, 
military ships should only be able to sail into the ports of 
Crimea on coordination with the Crimean president. 
  Some data suggests that a draft document on setting up the 
Republican Guard of Crimea has already been prepared and will in 
the very near future be submitted for consideration by the 
Crimean parliamentarians.

  [Text] Kishinyov [Chisinau] does not agree that the 
withdrawal of the Fourteenth Russian Army from Moldova be 
synchronized with granting a special juridical status to 
Transdniestria. This was stated by Moldovan President Mircea 
Snegur at his meeting with Deputy U.S. State Secretary, Chief 
Coordinator on the New Independent States James Collins in 
Kishinyov today. Snegur said the issue was being discussed with 
Russia. 
  Snegur stressed that no Russian military base could be 
established on Moldovan territory. Information on its 
establishment was not more than an allegation by the media, he 
added. 
  James Collins stated that the participation of Moldova in 
international organizations and its signing of the NATO 
Partnership for Peace program proved once again that the 
Republic was moving towards democratization of its society. He 
highly appraised the general vision of possible ways of 
settlement of the problems in Transdniestria and the centers 
mostly populated by Gagauz displayed by the Moldovan leadership.

  [Text] Tallinn, May 12, BNS -- Estonian Prime Minister 
Mart Laar and British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd today 
signed in London two agreements on economic issues, the Foreign 
Ministry press service told BNS. 
  The treaty on the promotion and protection of investments 
lays down the parties' obligations and rights in reciprocal 
protection of investments. 
  The parties undertake to give allround support to the 
investments made by each other's investors and create conditions 
for them that are not less favorable than those for a third 
country's investments. 
  Both parties guarantee adequate compensation to investors in 
the event of damage to investments and promise not to 
expropriate the property of investors of the other party. The 
treaty lays down rules concerning resolving of disagreements and 
exceptions to them. 
  The treaty will be submitted for ratification in the 
parliament. It is concluded for a period of ten years and upon 
expiration of the term will be extended until one of the parties 
initiates and completes the procedures to repeal it. 
  The other agreement signed today concerns avoiding double 
taxation and preventing tax evasions. 
  The treaty lays down rules and conditions for imposing taxes 
on the income of permanent residents of both parties if those 
incomes derive from both Estonia and Great Britain. 
  The objective of the treaty is to avoid a situation when 
persons who get income in both states must also pay tax on them 
in both. It provides for exchange of information between both 
countries' competent organs to implement the treaty and prevent 
fraud.

<F P=106> [Video report from Germany by L. Ogorodnikov and V. </F>
Kondratyev; from the "Ostankino" newscast] 
  [Text] [Ogorodnikov] The second day of the Russian 
president's visit to Germany started in the German Government 
guest house in Petersberg, a Bonn suburb, with meetings with 
Rudolf Scharping, Social Democratic Party chairman and prime 
minister of Rhineland-Pfalz, and Johannes Rau, minister 
president of North Rhine-Westphalia. 
  [Kondratyev] Both politicians aspire to the highest posts in 
the state. Rau has chances of replacing Richard von Weizsaecker 
as federal president as early as 23 May and Scharping is 
aspiring to the post of Helmut Kohl himself in October of this 
year. This meeting, apart from a discussion of topical 
political problems, undoubtedly gave the Russian president the 
opportunity to get better acquainted with the way the mechanism 
of interrelations between the ruling parties and the opposition 
functions in a democratic state. 
  [Ogorodnikov] Two hours later Boris Yeltsin and Aleksandr 
Shokhin held talks with Theo Waigel, chairman of the Christian 
Social Union and federal finance minister. The head of the 
German Finance Ministry said that the problem of Russian foreign 
debt was discussed -- it is assessed at 87 billion German marks 
-- and also the possibilities of changing the mechanism of 
granting Russia new credits. Russia's Deputy Prime Minister 
Shokhin said that an accord has been reached on Germany granting 
a 500 million [currency not specified] preferential loan for 
purchasing railway cars from the former GDR. A big question 
mark hangs over many other projects, inasmuch as Russia does not 
intend to settle in hard currency or oil and is offering in 
exchange deliveries of military equipment, in particular MiG-29 
fighter aircraft. Officially Bonn's attitude to this an 
approach is fairly skeptical. 
  The military theme was also discussed in Petersberg today. 
Defense Minister Grachev stated this in an interview with the 
Ostankino TV company; he provided a few details of the 
discussion of the August ceremony between the leaders of the two 
countries. 
  [Kondratyev] At this point the official part of the stay in 
Bonn has been completed. A program is beginning which could be 
described as lightweight. The point is that Helmut Kohl invites 
those to whom he wants to show his special liking to 
Rhineland-Pfalz, the region of his birth. There, in a cozy 
litte restaurant and in the chancellor's private residence, 
partaking of Kohl's favorite dishes, the statesmen are 
continuing the conversations begun in Bonn. 
  [Ogorodnikov] These meetings, rare and unusual in West 
German 
politics, and the heightened marks of attention must show, not 
so much, as they put it here, the male friendship between 
Yeltsin and Kohl as the fact for Russians that Germany regards 
Yeltsin as the guarantor of market reforms and that warnings 
alleging that after the withdrawal of Russian troops from 
Germany the German leadership will turn its back on Russia and 
will not take it seriously are unfounded. Yeltsin himself, in 
turn, who is in every possible way demonstrating his good 
relationship with the chancellor, said that he believes in 
Helmut Kohl, in his honesty and decency. The process of the 
genuine reconciliation of the two great peoples after the 
withdrawal of the Western Group of Forces will enter a new era.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Speyer TASS [no date as received] -- Taking a break 
from talks on European security, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl 
gave Russian President Boris Yeltsin a tour on Thursday of the 
region in Germany's southern Rhineland-Palatinate state, where 
the chancellor lives when not in Bonn. 
  Yeltsin and Kohl travelled to a small picturesque town of 
Speyer on the Rhine bank, where they toured the Romanesque 
11th-century cathedral, the world's biggest when it was built. 
  About 3,000 people greeted Yeltsin on the square in front of 
the cathedral. Among them, there were a lot of migrants from 
former Soviet republics. A group of ethnic German migrants from 
Kazakhstan were carrying a poster reading "Glory to the Russian 
people". "We wish you every success, Boris Nikolayevich", the 
gathering chanted. 
  A former militiaman of the Kazakh city of Barnaul, Ivan 
Gros, 
told TASS that ethnic Germans "highly appreciated yesterday's 
statement by the Russian president as regards Russia's German 
community. If the situation in localities changes for the 
better, I am confident that the number of people seeking to move 
to Germany will decrease drastically. So far, people are guided 
by economic considerations. Nevertheless, most ethnic German 
migrants are missing their motherland badly", he admitted. 
  Before the tour about the cathedral, the Russian president 
told reporters that the second day of his visit to Germany was 
not so intense as the first one. However, he stressed, today's 
meeting in Bonn with leaders of the opposition Social Democrats 
(SPD) enabled me to better understand the power balance in the 
country ahead of this year's election. On the whole, talks 
never cease -- in the bus, in the car, at the table, Yeltsin 
noted.

<F P=106> [Article by Vyacheslav Yelagin, section chief in the Russian </F>
Federation Foreign Ministry Press and Information Department: 
"Russia-Germany: Growing Mutual Interest"] 
  [Text] After the collapse of the former USSR, foreign 
analysts and some Russian political scientists maintained that 
it would take many years for Russian-German ties to become 
consistent and dynamic in nature. But those forecasts were not 
to be realized. 
  The regular meetings held between our countries' leaders are 
the best indicator of the scale of bilateral relations in the 
political sphere. Perhaps no other state leader in Europe 
maintains such close contacts with the Russian Federation 
president as Chancellor Kohl: There are reciprocal visits and a 
constant exchange of opinions with Boris Yeltsin by telephone 
and in the form of personal messages. Yesterday the Russian 
president arrived in Germany on an official visit, and in August 
he will take part in the send-off ceremony for the Russian 
troops. 
  The cooperation between the two states rests on a 
strengthening treaty and legal basis. Twenty five 
intergovernmental and interdepartmental agreements have been 
signed in the recent period alone. 
  Germany is now one of Russia's main economic partners. It 
accounts for 17 percent of our foreign trade turnover. Russia 
is a very important partner for the FRG in the east. Fifty-five 
production-sharing contracts, mainly in machine building, are 
now in operation between the two countries' companies. More 
than 100 companies in production, trade, transport and dispatch, 
insurance, and other areas of cooperation have been set up in 
Germany using Russian capital. A considerable amount of our 
exports to the FRG go via them. 
  The German side is helping the process of privatization in 
Russia. The spectrum is diverse, ranging from the formation of 
the legal bases of private enterprise to joint research efforts 
and specific projects. For example, a company promoting 
economic reforms in the Moscow Oblast is operating with active 
German government department support and oversight. The 
Wintershall Erdgas Handelshaus joint venture is functioning 
successfully. 
  Enterprises with German share capital on Russian Federation 
territory number more than 1,700. Germany is entering into 
cooperation with Russia in the implementation of international 
space projects. It also intends to make its contribution to the 
program of implementing projects of ours in chemical production, 
power generation, capital construction, and aircraft 
construction. Business relations are being set up between our 
two states' regions. 
  Sessions of the Russian-German Cooperation Council for 
Economic, Scientific, and Technical Cooperation are held 
regularly. A bureau for a representative [delegat] of the 
German economy has been opened in St. Petersburg. Special 
bursaries for Russian graduates of higher educational 
institutions studying management, economics, and production 
organization are being established in a number of German 
concerns, for example, Daimler-Benz AG. 
  The FRG government intends to promote the involvement of 
German private capital in Russian reforms. According to 
experts' figures, German companies, with a total capital of $4.2 
billion, make up 60 percent of foreign investors in Russia. 
  The FRG has helped in no small way the development of 
relations between Russia and the EU. Moscow and Bonn are 
stepping up their cooperation at the UN and CSCE level. It has 
stated its readiness to support Russia's membership application 
to the Council of Europe and is in favor of the creation of 
strategic partnership relations between Russia and NATO. 
  Bonn has welcomed Russian diplomacy's efforts to unblock 
the crisis situation over Sarajevo. The stances of Russia and 
the FRG regarding the solution of the Yugoslav crisis coincide 
to a large extent and there are no substantial disagreements. 
  All-around contacts are maintained in the military sphere. 
Joint maritime exercises involving naval combined units will be 
conducted this year. Troop exercises at the level of tactical 
subunits are planned in the future. A center for training and 
retraining our servicemen returning from Germany in civilian 
specialisms was recently opened in the Russian capital with FRG 
financial assistance. The sides are cooperating effectively in 
the sphere of eliminating nuclear and chemical weapons. 
  A joint Russian-German commission for the reciprocal return 
of cultural treasures removed during World War II has begun 
work. Consultations on events to mark its 50th anniversary are 
being held. 
  The problem of the ethnic Germans on Russian Federation 
territory is a very important aspect of Russian-German 
relations. A protocol was signed in July 1992 which envisages 
cooperation in the phased restoration of the Russian Germans' 
statehood and better provision of facilities in areas where they 
represent a high proportion of the population. This year the 
FRG will allocate 65 million German marks [DM] for these 
purposes. For the first time Russia's draft budget earmarks 30 
billion rubles likewise. Thanks to these measures, it has been 
possible to check somewhat the growth of repatriation of Russian 
Germans to Germany. 
  But our relations are not unclouded. Touching on problems in 
the economic sphere, reciprocal trade turnover last year, 
according to preliminary figures, was DM20.5 billion as against 
DM21.8 billion in 1992. The worrying thing is that Moscow has 
not to date been able to repay the debt of approximately DM40 
billion accumulated since Soviet times. True, an 
intergovernmental accord consolidating the foreign debts of 
Russia and the former USSR was signed in September 1993. We 
have been granted a 10-year deferment of payment on DM8 
billions' worth of debt. 
  The question of German investments in the Russian economy is 
critical. The amount of investment is substantially less than 
in, say, a country like Hungary. This year new arrangements 
regulating the cost of export credit guarantees have been 
introduced through the well-known FRG company Hermes: We now 
have to put 15 percent up-front in order to obtain credit 
guarantees. This makes it less interesting for us to take them 
up. 
  But these sore points can be treated. Boris Yeltsin's visit 
to our friendly neighboring country will undoubtedly make a 
substantial contribution to further deepening all-around 
Russian-German parnership links.

  [Text] The memorandum on political partnership in the name 
of nationwide accord, social stability and unity of the Kyrgyz 
people will not be signed on 13 May, as was expected. INTERFAX 
learned this from sources close to the Kyrgyz Government. 
  This document was supported by all political parties, 
public, 
cultural and national centers. The memorandum was expected to 
be signed by Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev, parliament's 
Chairman Medetkan Sherimkulov, Premier Abbas Dzhumagulov, the 
Assembly of Kyrgyz Peoples and nine registered political parties. 
  The signatories were meant to undertake to refrain from 
actions which could deteriorate the political situation and 
trigger off public disorder, to back the policy of the 
republic's leadership and to hold consultations on all major 
issues of interior policy. 
  INTERFAX learned that some connection had been suggested to 
exist between non-signing of the memorandum and the president's 
press service's statement circulated on 11 May accusing the 
government of failure in taxation and budget policy. The 
government considered this as quite unexpected actions, which 
might lead to negative consequences. 
  According to some sources, Dzhumagulov had intended to sign 
the memorandum but postponed the signing when the situation 
mentioned above emerged and went on a working visit to a Kyrgyz 
region.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: reports by </F>
diplomatic correspondents Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and 
others] 
  [Text] The next round of talks between the Tajik leadership 
and the opposition may take place in early June, Foreign 
Minister Rashid Olimov told INTERFAX on Thursday [12 May]. 
  According to him, at present the special envoy of the U.N. 
Secretary General for Tajikistan, Ramirez Perez-Bollon, is in 
Tehran. Later he is planning to go to Islamabad. He is 
expected to visit Dushanbe on 25-27 May. The U.N. deputy 
Secretary General for political issues, Marek Golding, is to 
arrive in Tajikistan's capital together with him. "The U.N. 
officials will indicate the final date and place for the talks, 
since earlier we agreed that these questions belong to their 
competence," Olimov said. 
  As he said, the Tajik leadership has "enough good will to 
continue the negotiating process." "At the moment the state of 
inter-Tajik dialogue provides reason for cautious optimism," the 
foreign minister said. 
  According to him, the main thing is that the "negotiating 
mechanism has been switched on, and the two sides agreed to 
continue their peace dialogue." "We stand for carrying out the 
talks in a constructive channel, not in the channel of continued 
confrontation," Olimov pointed out. 
  At the same time he deplored the "regular insinuations 
launched into the news media by some members of the Tajik 
opposition." "The allegations that the leadership of Tajikistan 
wants no peaceful settlement, that it is interested in building 
up Russian military presence in order to crush the opposition, 
are totally groundless," the foreign minister stressed. 
  According to him, the "factor of Russian influence" in 
Tajikistan has "largely cultural, not military, foundations." 
"Unfortunately, last year we had to involve Russian troops in 
the guarding of the Tajik-Afghan border in accordance with the 
CIS collective security treaty. We had to resort to that 
measure. Russian troops were stationed in Tajikistan to ensure 
the safety of our republic and protect its sovereignty, not to 
threaten someone," Olimov said. 
  "When the threat to security in Tajikistan stemming from the 
opposition militants entrenched in Afghanistan ceases to exist, 
the issue of Russian troops will get resolved by itself," he 
noted. "Unfortunately, armed opposition groups persist in 
launching regular sallies from neighboring Afghanistan. This is 
a fact we cannot get away from. In our view, some people are 
too eager to destabilize the situation in Tajikistan and resolve 
this issue by military means. They are using the threat 
allegedly stemming from Russian troops in our republic as a 
cover for this," Olimov said. 
  The leadership of Tajikistan "is in a peaceful mood, and it 
is trying to ignore the speculations concerning the "Russian 
factor," the head of Tajik diplomacy pointed out.

"Struggle for the Post of Turkmenistan President Has Already 
Commenced. Rumors Around the Republic Speak of Possible Coup 
d'Etat"] 
  [Text] According to information from trustworthy sources, 
the state of health of Turkmenia [Turkmenistan] President 
Saparmurad Niyazov continues to worsen every day, and he is 
planning a new course of treatment in Houston (United States), 
where he recently was operated on for blood vessel problems, or 
in Turkey. For this reason he has been absent of late from 
ceremonial events including those held in his honor. The 
Turkmenia president's press service denies information on 
Niyazov's deteriorating health while rumors are circulating in 
the Republic about a possible coup d'etat. 
  The rivalry for the Turkmenian presidency is already on. 
Those intending to compete for the position of head of state 
are Agriculture Minister Payzgeldy Meredov, and Kurban Orazov, 
head of the Mary Oblast administration. Notably, according to 
information from trustworthy sources, both "rivals" will not 
stop short of a coup d'etat in the president's absence. 
  Payzgeldy Meredov has headed the republic's agricultural 
agency for many years, and he makes his own decisions on the 
destinies of Turkmenian cotton by setting prices and export 
quotas. As his comrades-in-arms think, he has amassed a vast 
fortune selling cotton and is the country's wealthiest man. 
  Kurban Orazov has long been head of the republic's Mary 
Oblast in addition to heading Turkmenistan's central electoral 
committee. 
  President S. Niyazov, who once gambled on these men, lately 
has been preferring Valeriy Otchertsov and Boris Shikhmuradov, 
vice prime ministers for the economy and politics. They, 
however, enjoy no prestige among the republic's inhabitants 
because they do not know national peculiarities, traditions, and 
the local language. Both vice prime ministers are openly 
hostile to one another and compete for influence with President 
Niyazov. 
  Valeriy Otchertsov is a more devoted follower of President 
Niyazov. In Soviet times, he held the position of second 
secretary of the Komsomol Central Committee and, being Moscow's 
protege, controlled local leaders' activities. 
  Local observers believe that rumors of a possible coup are 
being spread mainly by P. Meredov's men in order to psych up the 
public for this event. The majority of the Turkmen leadership 
gamble precisely on Meredov, regarding Vice Premiers Otchertsov 
and Shakhmuradov as temporary executors of the current 
Turkmenistan president's will. 
  In the meantime, leaders of the Turkmenian opposition based 
in Moscow are alarmed at the rumors being spread about a 
possible coup d'etat in Turkmenistan, and they firmly state that 
the opposition, in the shape of the "Turkmenistan" fund 
organization, has enough resources and potentialities to hinder 
this. 
  Characterizing the information about a possible coup d'etat 
in Turkmenistan, Murat Esenov, an opposition leader and the 
"Turkmenistan" fund general director, stated in an interview for 
your SEGODNYA correspondent that the actions of P. Meredov and 
K. Orazov could entail undesirable consequences for the country. 
Due to the absence of a social base and prestige among the 
population, they intend to gamble on the "power" ministries in 
the struggle for power. Therefore, heads of these ministries 
should take into account the experience of their close neighbors 
Tajikistan and Afghanistan, where civil war erupted after a 
similar situation had developed. 
  Answering questions from your correspondent, Murat Esenov 
confirmed information on the deteriorating state of health of 
the head of state and added, "We would be glad to see the 
president in good health and compete with him on a legal basis 
in the 1997 presidential elections. Members of the opposition 
will by all means insist on holding them irrespective of the 
referendum results on extending President Niyazov's powers.

  [Text] A three-year program for Turkmenistan's 
socioeconomic development was proposed at today's meeting of the 
republican parliament in Ashgabat. Our correspondent says it 
was drafted by President Niyazov. The program is entitled "10 
Years of Prosperity" and contains specific presidential 
proposals. These include, for example, the idea that there 
should be a change in the ratio between the proportion of wages 
devoted to living expenses and the proportion set aside as 
savings. The leaders of contemporary Turkmenistan claim that 
citizens should be able to save 30-40 percent of their income 
and that all the necessary conditions have been created in the 
Republic for this.

  [Text] Moscow May 12 TASS -- The bill on the Russian land 
code undoubtedly became the main issue discussed on Thursday by 
the Presidium of the Russian Government. Following numerous 
remarks by ministers and heads of departments, the bill was 
adopted as a whole. 
  A decision was made to submit the land code to the Russian 
Parliament lower chamber on June 2 after it is finalised. 
  "The land code which is still a bill, interferes with 
reforms", Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin summed up speeches on this 
top priority issue for Russia. "The absence of the legislative 
basis retards reforms in the agricultural sector and blocks 
channels for domestic and foreign investors. 
  "On the other hand, we must not leave unsettled issues and 
legal contradictions," the premier stressed. 
  Vice-Premiers Sergey Shakhray and Anatoliy Chubays spoke 
about the above problems when discussing the land code bill. 
They were interested in how members of the Russian Federation 
will behave themselves when the land code is adopted. 
  They also asked why the bill favours the principle of state 
regulation of land relations at the expense of the rights of 
owner, including foreigners. The vice-premiers suggested that 
the document be finalised by the Government without shifting 
this task onto legislators. 
  The Government Presidium also approved the bill on civil 
defence as a whole.

  [Text] Moscow, 12 May (BUSINESS-TASS) -- Russia's foreign 
debt (not counting its indebtedness to Eastern European 
countries and overdue commercial payments) at the start of 1994 
exceeded 80 billion dollars. That figure is cited in a 
memorandum drawn up by the State Duma Committee on the Budget, 
Taxation, Banks, and Finances. 
  The annual payments that Russia was committed to make under 
the schedule for servicing debt and repaying principal in 
1992-93 were in excess of 20 billion dollars. However, thanks 
to successful negotiations with creditors Russia was able to 
limit itself last year to paying out only 2.2 billion dollars. 
During the current year the Russian Government intends to pay a 
further 4.7 billion dollars. 
  Last year Russia obtained from foreign governments credits 
totalling 4.4 billion dollars. The biggest creditor was 
Germany, which provided 2.4 billion dollars. The top three 
creditors also included France (providing 680 million dollars) 
and the United States (providing 671 million dollars). Our 
eastern neighbor, Japan, provided only 140 million dollars in 
credit, but nevertheless, it outstripped Canada, Turkey, and the 
Netherlands. 
  In 1994 the government is expecting to obtain credits 
totalling 2.8 billion dollars. Germany will keep its lead in 
this sphere. It will be followed by Italy, the United States, 
and Japan, which is proposing to increase the amount of its 
credit by 150 percent. 
  Almost half of the foreign credits last year went to 
agriculture and the food industry, in the main for grain 
purchases, while the rest went to industry, transport, 
communications, municipal services, environmental protection, 
the medical industry, and the purchase of medical supplies. 
  In 1994 it is planned to direct the credits in the main to 
industry and agriculture. A total of 650 million dollars will 
be earmarked for the medical industry and the purchase of 
medical supplies. In comparison with last year it is planned to 
reduce 13- fold the outlay of credits for the purchase of 
grain--to 100 million dollars. 
  At the same time, Russia has continued providing foreign 
states with credit. In particular, credits have been issued 
over the past two years to India, Cuba, Algeria, and Pakistan 
totalling 1.8 billion dollars.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the Russian </F>
Federation State Duma, by ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI chief editor Valeriy 
Kucher; date and place not given: "Fifth Attempt To Establish 
Russian Parliamentarianism"] 
  [Text] People of a pragmatic disposition sometimes feel 
uncomfortable in Russian political circles even though they hold 
key posts. Maybe the urge to engage in exciting politics is so 
strong in our consciousness, after the years oppressed by 
stagnation, that we are inclined to deify the destroyers and the 
romantics rather than giving due credit to cautious and 
responsible politicians. 
  In the ruling strata they are, so to speak, in the dugout, 
although they are on the team. It is not surprising that 
pragmatists are required to make considerably more sacrifices 
and produce more proofs of loyalty to democracy than are 
indulged in by their suspicious colleagues who are also their 
opponents. 
  It is probably for this reason that State Duma Chairman Ivan 
Petrovich Rybkin has not yet established his image. Maybe this 
is partly his personal "fault" too -- as a man who does not go 
in for showy moves, although on occasion, maybe, this is a 
mistake: Populism, as a temporary measure, is sometimes 
necessary. 
  The feigned refusal to recognize Ivan Rybkin as an 
independent political figure, the emphasis on the bare facts of 
his resume, and also the deliberate cultivation of the image of 
a "turncoat" and "traitor" and the underestimation of his 
strategic potential, are damaging not so much to his personal 
authority and the prestige of the legislators, as to the 
prestige of state power in general. It is time people realized 
this! If all this is true, what kind of Duma have we elected, 
if that is the kind of speaker it has? Are we capable of 
electing worthy rulers at all? 
  A study of the logic of the establishment of the new power 
in 
Russia (and that is ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI's main topic) requires us 
to look frankly at the political figures of today -- without 
party blinders, myths and gossip, or dogmas, and especially 
without devising cages of official powers for them. Asking 
questions does not mean eulogizing, and doubting does not mean 
rejecting. 
  I feel that Rybkin's "novelty" as a politician is more or 
less unique. He differs from previous figures who have declared 
centrist positions but have soon drifted to right or left, in 
that one camp has not accepted him, and the other has rejected 
him. The way to the right and to the left is now closed for 
him, he is objectively obliged to remain in the center, and he 
has a unique opportunity to construct a centrist stance. 
  Rybkin also differs from other politicians in that he does 
not repudiate his own past. He is moving toward the supporters 
of the new Constitution, becoming a kind of bridge between those 
in power and the opposition. You can reject that. You can 
assess it however you like. But you have to reckon with it. 
  Ivan Petrovich Rybkin is on his way. What lies in store for 
him and how he will then behave, nobody can know. Although the 
experience of his 100 days as speaker reveals much about the 
personality of this politician. Read our interview with him on 
page 2: 
  [Interview begins] [Kucher] The State Duma's two-year term 
could be a crucial period for the future of Russian 
parliamentarianism. I am not talking about the quantitative 
parameters of its work. Let us leave aside, for the moment, the 
number of laws adopted and to be adopted. I am talking about 
the fact that there is a historic opportunity, in these two 
years, to lay the foundations of a real parliamentarianism for 
our country, provided, of course, that we can shake off the 
spirit and traditions of the Supreme Soviet, which unfortunately 
are transferred from one Duma building to another along with the 
deputies.... Is it possible that ridding parliament of features 
that are alien to it could help it to move from the flanks 
toward the center? 
  [Rybkin] I agree with you that Russia has long needed a 
proper lawmaking process. There are many gaps in this. At 
times, everything hangs by a mere thread. But I would not 
repudiate a single day of the history of Russian 
parliamentarianism. When people say that our parliament does 
not have much history, I do not accept that conclusion. What 
about the people's assembly in ancient Novgorod -- is that not 
part of our heritage? Or take the Zemskiy Sobor [assembly] 
which elected the czar in the terrible Time of Troubles. Then 
there was the State Council and the senate. There have been 
four State Dumas in Russia. I have carefully studied their 
history, and I am familiar with both the happy and the tragic 
chapters. And I have arrived at the firm conviction that the 
idea of centrism is the dominant idea. 
  When this center was found, and there was support from the 
left and right wings, Russia lived peacefully and pursued the 
reforms it had undertaken. But when people leaned toward one 
wing, they suffered very serious upheavals. Therefore the 
people who championed the idea of the center are very dear to me 
as historical figures. 
  [Kucher] You left the leadership component of the CPRF 
[Communist Party of the Russian Federation] on your own 
initiative, giving preference to the Agrarian Party of Russia. 
Does this step on your part confirm that you pin your hopes of 
creating a center party on the "agrarians"? 
  [Rybkin] People tell me: The Agrarian Party is a 
conservative party. To some extent that is true, because it 
conserves the attitudes that form the genetic basis of the 
people. This is a weakness, but also a great strength. Every 
society must understand that it will have prosperity when the 
peasants enjoy success. Some 40 percent of the national product 
is created in the agro-industrial complex. That is the reality. 
And it is so not because some people support or do not support 
the Agrarian Party, although I myself am an agrarian -- I have 
had links with the peasants for the greater part of my life. If 
the peasants start to live prosperously, the Agrarian Party 
itself will be a party of the middle stratum, which is to say, 
the center. Those industrial workers who are able to live as 
well as the peasants will join the party. And I very much want 
the stratum of those who are prosperous to be a big one, and the 
center to be big. The country will thereby be strong. 
  [Kucher] What do we want, in the last analysis? What are we 
building? Should we give all this some kind of name, define 
it?... 
  [Rybkin] We should stop trying to delude people with all 
kinds of definitions. We have gone through the whole range of 
concepts. Let us turn our gaze to the north. There, life is 
more difficult, it is more difficult to build, to organize life. 
The ruling Social Democrats in Sweden, for instance, do not 
give any name to the society they live in. But the gulf between 
those who are very rich and those of average prosperity is 
three-, four-, or fivefold. In our country we never had this 
normal kind of inequality, it was abnormal, and now it is even 
more so. The gulf is enormous. So all the levers of influence 
must be used to prevent society from becoming so sharply 
stratified: through tax inspection, self-restraint, and 
properly perceived state interest, and by appealing to 
entrepreneurs' patriotic feelings. 
  We have seen all this before in Russia's history, when 
businesspeople respected its laws and understood their role in 
the country's prosperity. I am not calling for a return to the 
past. But I know that many of the present representatives of 
national capital are well disposed toward cooperation with the 
state as partners. The $1.5-2 billion that goes abroad every 
year could and should be brought back home. Not directly, of 
course, not by way of administrative pressure, but with the help 
of economic measures, that is, voluntarily. The law must be 
applied to those who steal. But for those who cannot yet find 
scope in Russia for their minds and talents and who have to 
invest the capital they have earned at 5 percent in a foreign 
bank rather than receiving an income of 500 percent in their 
native state -- for those people it is simply essential that we 
find guarantees for their work. Maybe through the creation of 
transnational corporations or by other means. 
  I have always believed that our people have fine qualities 
which you cannot buy for any money. Saint-Exupery called this 
the luxury of human contact. In Russia there has always been 
plenty of this. It must be valued. Handed down from generation 
to generation. 
  [Kucher] You touched on the subject of the people's 
historical memory. I would like to ask you a question directly 
concerning recent political history. You once stressed in an 
interview that you attach particular value to the Lenin of the 
times of the NEP [new economic policy]. Does that mean that you 
advocate some kind of new approach to assessing the activity of 
the Bolsheviks in Russia? 
  [Rybkin] I feel profoundly Russian by my origin and by my 
roots. At the same time I feel I am an inhabitant of Russia who 
grew up in a multinational environment. Therefore nothing in 
Russia's history is alien to me. Everything that happened 
belongs to me. 
  I am a pragmatist. Therefore I am convinced that from all 
our hard-earned experience we should adopt what is most 
necessary and important. Our pride in our compatriots' 
greatness of spirit and mind should not be based on short-term 
considerations whereby one person is trampled underfoot in order 
to elevate another. All historical figures have been focal 
points for great good and great evil. The bigger the figure, 
the more significant the manifestation of both of these. 
  Everything that was done by Peter I, by Alexander I or 
Alexander the Liberator -- all this passed through my family's 
history in one way or another. After the 1861 reform and the 
abolition of serfdom my forebears, who had fought, received 
parcels of land. They received this gift as a great benefit and 
clung to that land. The time of great upheavals came: the 
Japanese and First World Wars, the revolution. It was a peasant 
country. Something had to be done. But not the way they did 
it! And by 1920 this had become clear. My forefathers were 
freedom-lovers and refused to be brought to their knees, as many 
other citizens of Russia are refusing now. Because you can 
injure a person, and eventually he will understand and forgive. 
But you cannot humiliate him -- he will never forgive that. 
Every ruler who has real power must understand that. 
  So then the NEP came along -- the wise new economic policy. 
The peasant finds himself in his accustomed market, he has room 
to maneuver. The peasants always lived in market conditions, 
albeit restricted or specific. Without the market of those 
days, I and my two brothers and two sisters would never have 
received higher education. The ruble, which was in the same 
state of upheaval as now, became gold. 
  All these are elementary facts. I am repeating them in order 
to emphasize a simple thought: that if you are the leader, that 
is to say you are in the lead, in front of the others, it is 
incumbent on you to look ahead a pace or two, and not lead the 
others while walking backwards yourself. 
  [Kucher] Could you name the strong and weak aspects of our 
government? 
  [Rybkin] You mean, starting in 1991? 
  [Kucher] For the sake of argument. 
  [Rybkin] My sympathies are with the government headed by 
Yegor Timurovich Gaydar for their efforts, vigor, and desire to 
reform the economy. But I am frankly convinced that a 
thoroughly monopoly-based economy cannot be taken by a cavalry 
attack without injuries and errors. If we are thinking in terms 
of a system, we must understand that the reforms should involve 
dismantling, not destruction. An explosion is always a 
revolution. Bang -- then dust. But by dismantling a component 
and putting a new one in its place, we can change the system as 
a whole. The peasant who has rotting beams in his house knows 
how to do this without destroying the whole structure. 
  Some of the people from that government still remain, and 
they are working with Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin. For the 
most part they are well-trained people with a good knowledge of 
theory. They have gained substantial experience over these 
years. Unfortunately, this has affected Russia painfully. It is 
distressing to see this. I do not want to engage in "if 
only's." Indeed, when they took on the job, there were not many 
volunteers. Now they are living through a difficult time. 
  But the government operates as it deems necessary. It is 
inclined to heed parliament's opinion. Relations between us are 
equal, although we are rather critical about some of the 
government's steps. But we do not bear a grudge. In the 
committees there is the opportunity to discuss things with the 
vice premiers. In parliament's "Government Hour" (on Fridays) 
it is no problem for the ministers to justify or adjust their 
own viewpoint. There was admittedly a time when some of the 
young deputies raised the question of no confidence in the 
government. Not more than 16 percent of those present voted to 
put this question on the agenda. 
  [Kucher] A situation very often arises in the government 
when it is necessary to act quickly, but an appropriate law does 
not yet exist. What is your attitude to the idea that the 
federal executive power could make broader use, in economic 
practice, of its own decrees and other normative acts? 
  [Rybkin] The formula that forms the basis of the 
government's activity permits it to draw up practical, 
well-thought-out documents and adopt laws in a transparent form, 
with all interested parties playing an active part in this 
process. The federal budget was submitted to parliament 23 
March, and was adopted on 25 March. 
  We must not drift into an "emergency" attitude, although 
where it is necessary, in the interests of the cause, to 
regulate something by means of a government decree, this must be 
done, and likewise where a presidential edict is needed. But we 
must create a sound legislative basis, among other things as 
regards formulating the budget. There are those who assert that 
the Duma will not be able to adopt more than 30 laws in the 
remaining time, but that statement is unfounded. 
  [Kucher] What does the concept of "an independent political 
figure" mean for you personally? 
  [Rybkin] Everything relating to my duties. What you call 
independence is prescribed in the Russian Federation 
Constitution. It clearly states what I can and what I am not 
entitled to do. Some people believe that these aren't sufficient 
rights for the State Duma. I don't think so. The entire 
lawmaking process passes through the State Duma -- this imposes 
a tremendous obligation and a tremendous responsibility. 
Coordinating this work, organizing internal procedures -- all 
this complex process falls on my shoulders. But I believe that 
I am truly independent if I can heed the opinion of deputies and 
rely on it. The State Duma Standing Orders and other documents 
empower me to represent the Duma's interests in all 
organizations and power structures inside and outside the 
country. This represents a pretty broad range of questions and 
powers. But I repeat yet again that I constantly measure my 
actions against the sentiments of State Duma deputies and the 
State Duma Council and try never to take any step without them. 
Furthermore, there are always deputies around me and I have the 
chance to consult with them. When I was young and less 
experienced and was chairing faculty meetings I would listen to 
people and think: I was about to make such-and-such a decision 
but, having listened to them, I have fundamentally altered it. 
Thank God I listened, and thank God I altered that decision. It 
is important not only to listen but also to hear what people are 
saying -- this is also a sign of independence. 
  [Kucher] You are sometimes accused of having betrayed your 
ideals, some people regard you as a defector... 
  [Rybkin] On the subject of political retreats and 
defections. It seems to me that people who talk like that are 
maybe the ones who have lost contact with the world, whereas I 
move in the same direction as the world.... I live a real life, 
while they have their heads in the clouds. 
  [Kucher] Historians and analysts are attempting to predict 
Russia's future, arguing among themselves. What do you think 
about its future? 
  [Rybkin] There is a great deal that is artificial and 
divorced from real life in the arguments about whether Russia 
will become great power or not. I simply say that Russia has 
never ceased to be a great power. And never will. 
  [Kucher] What is your view of how Russia will build its 
relations with the republics which have made the break and gone 
their own way, as they say? 
  [Rybkin] I simply say that Russia is self-sufficient enough 
to weather any crisis. And we are weathering it. 
  Those who have made a wrong move will probably soon realize. 
We learn by comparing. We all have to seek our own solution. 
But I am convinced that many will try to get closer to Russia. 
How this will be formalized -- by a Treaty of Georgiyevsk or of 
some other kind -- I don't know. But I do believe, for example, 
that the Russian-Belorussian [Belarusian] treaty and the things 
it offers is the correct path, particularly for fraternal 
peoples. 
  I see a mixed economy for Russia. It is hard to say what the 
balance between private and state ownership will be. State 
ownership accounts for 22 percent in the United States, for 
example, 33 percent in Germany, 40 percent in Austria, and 10 
percent in Japan. The current figure in our country is 70 
percent. But even that figure is wrong. State enterprises are 
no longer what they used to be. We have not thought through the 
flotation process. And the people who work there have not gone 
into this in depth. Grabbing a controlling block of shares for 
itself, an enterprise follows the old tradition of begging the 
government for additional subsidies. We have instituted many 
different "levels," whereas the fact is that everything that's 
nonstate is private. 
  A mixed economy is a strength. Admittedly many of our 
industrialists have forgotten that the word industry is related 
to the concept of being industrious and doing something, not 
just sitting back and waiting for some kind of economic 
pluralism to appear. 
  As for the political aspect, a multiparty system is 
developing in the country. But this does not mean things will 
be as they are now, when it is very easy to register a party 
with neither a program nor social support. By tradition Russia 
will evidently have a center party, a left-wing party, and -- on 
the right -- a liberal democratic party. But I don't think that 
the right-wing party will be identical to the one that is 
currently active. 
  [Kucher] It would be interesting to hear your assessment of 
the State Duma's first four months of work.... 
  [Rybkin] I would like to talk not some much about lawmaking 
as about the fact that we have managed in a short space of time 
to find mutual understanding and cooperation between the 
president and the State Duma, the State Duma and the government, 
the State Duma and the Federation Council, the State Duma and 
the judiciary. This is a very, very important factor. 
  It can be said that a hundred days is not a very long period 
to draw such a conclusion. We live in times when one day counts 
as two or even three. Because the State Duma has been granted 
only 24 months of activity. Four months have already gone. And 
we are very aware of this. 
  A detailed plan of law-drafting activity has been adopted. 
It identifies priority legislative acts which are extremely 
necessary to back up economic reform in Russia. I would say, 
however, that we are not talking so much of even backup for 
immediate needs as of the longer term. And this is very 
important. In addition, the plan for law-drafting activity 
incorporates the wishes of all those with legislative initiative 
rights. 
  What parts of this plan are already being implemented? First 
and foremost laws forming the legal framework of the new state: 
civil and land codes and water and air laws, which establish and 
consolidate the new ownership relationships in Russia. New 
criminal, criminal-procedure, and administrative-law codes are 
currently being elaborated. 
  I regard it as a big plus for the State Duma that when we 
were shaping the administrative structures (the chairman of the 
State Duma and his four deputies, committees, and commissions) 
we followed not the path of enshrining the advantages which the 
party majority achieved during the elections but the path of 
proportional representation for all the factions and deputies' 
groups. Which was a considerable surprise to Russia and the 
rest of the world. This meant the main objective was achieved -- 
what emerged was not a list-driven majority based on the number 
of supporters of a given faction or group, but a real, sensible 
majority. Without which fruitful activity by the State Duma 
would be inconceivable. 
  It is virtually impossible to get all deputies without 
exception to agree in the course of Duma plenary sessions. We 
had to consider the experience of the United States, France, 
Germany, Austria, and a number of other countries where work on 
a draft law starts in committee and is conducted on a multiparty 
basis there. 
  Thus our chamber of the Federal Assembly -- to the surprise 
of many opponents -- very quickly structured itself, determined 
its forms and methods of work, and started operating -- getting 
down, that is, to its main job of lawmaking. 
  In my view the existence of a strong "common sense" bloc in 
the Duma was evidenced by the amnesty decree. I am deeply 
convinced that without the decision adopted by the Duma it would 
be impossible, first, to get Russia out of crisis; second, to 
avoid suspicion, hoping for the worst, and the possibility of 
settling scores; third, to amnesty -- literally forgive -- not 
only the "Lefortovo inmates" but every last one of the political 
participants, on both sides, in the 21 September-4 October 
events, thereby halting the wave of hatred and vengefulness; and 
fourth, to give thousands of Russians with their new-found 
freedom the chance to join in constructive work for the benefit 
of the fatherland. 
  The "common-sense bloc" made its weighty voice heard when 
working on the agreement on achieving social accord in Russia. 
  In my view, that document is an important step strengthening 
Russian statehood. It is an original Russian version of the 
Moncloa Pact, which saved Spain from a rerun of the Civil War 
after Franco died. [interview ends] 
  The old Supreme Soviet's departure from the political scene 
also brought in its wake the disappearance of one its invariable 
attributes -- the "video" record documenting deputies at work. 
We can no longer see how Ivan Rybkin chairs sessions or what 
he talks to deputies about and how. In fact he rarely appears 
on television. Instead we are starting to get more frequent 
assessments of his activity in the newspapers, and the 
dissatisfied voice of the opposition is growing stronger. But 
why? It has become demonstrably clear to me, for example, that 
you can only call Ivan Rybkin a communist or a liberal by 
stretching the truth an awful long way. He is neither. Because 
he is a legislator in the post of chairman of the State Duma. 
His predecessors, Lukyanov and Khasbulatov, were nothing but 
Supreme Soviet manipulators. Men with different styles and from 
different schools, but still typical party tyrants. 
  Rybkin is a professional administrator, a statesman. No way 
has he sold out to Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin, as some of his 
dogmatic colleagues believe; it is just that, on becoming Duma 
chairman, he acquired a new status obliging him to leave his 
political views outside the Federal Assembly door. It cannot be 
ruled out that he has learned lessons from the recent past. But 
he was most likely pushed in this direction by his own 
experience as an engineer, political scientist, and diplomat. 
  Deputies are difficult customers. They have their own views 
of life, but they have a good sense of what a statesman is. 
  What awaits Ivan Rybkin in the future? 
  In answering this question I am not even attempting a 
prediction, merely citing facts. He is an outsider among his 
own people but not at home among those on the other side. His 
own people evidently cannot forgive him his "treachery": 
Baburin has already suggested that Rybkin be moved from the 
speaker's chair to a deputy's seat. They are hardly likely to 
back off, and a threat to Rybkin from that quarter is always a 
possibility. 
  The other side, the democrats, who initially had a sharply 
negative attitude to Ivan Petrovich, are gradually coming to 
recognize his worth and will evidently forge closer contacts 
with him unless they frighten themselves and, by proxy, their 
colleagues, and start squabbling among themselves again. 
  I wish to reiterate that Ivan Petrovich Rybkin is doomed to 
be in the center. He is able and, it seems to be, ready to 
reshape an assembly with Supreme Soviet morals into a real 
Russian parliament. 
  Possibly he will persist for a long time yet in linking the 
idea of creating a center to the spirit of the Agrarian Party. 
Unless life thrusts a new kind of middle-class person into the 
arena. 
  But let's not try to guess. 
  Time will tell.

Measures To Combat Crime," has come into force in the Kuban. In 
accordance with this decree mass surveillance and preventive and 
investigations measures were carried out in the course of four 
days; around 10,000 militia officers took part in these 
measures. The "catch" was fairly considerable and diverse. 
During the operation 344 crimes were detected, including 22 
cases of premeditated murder, 16 cases of deliberate aggravated 
assault, 25 robberies and muggings, 140 cases of embezzlement of 
state and private property, and 12 thefts of firearms and 
munitions. Fifty illegally held weapons were seized and 14 
stolen cars were restored to their lawful owners; money and 
valuables to the tune of 15 million rubles were seized from 
criminals. Eighty five criminals hiding from investigation and 
justice were found. The kray's hotels, stations, and markets 
were checked in a search for "casual workers."

  [Text] An explosion shook a residential area in Chechnya's 
capital, Groznyy, on Tuesday [10 May]. It killed four people 
and injured 10 more. Interfax's correspondents report that an 
armed unit of the Chechen opposition, Ruslan Lobozanov's group, 
is based there. 
  A prominent official from Chechnya's Interior Ministry told 
Interfax that the mine was set by another criminal group for the 
purpose of revenge. It was placed between the 3rd and the 4th 
storeys of a building. The blast claimed the lives of two 
Lobozanov militants and killed two local residents. 
  It is believed that this is a continuation of the events 
that 
took place earlier this year, when nine people died in an armed 
clash between Lobozanov's men and another grouping. Lobozanov's 
gang lost two men in that fire exchange. 
  After Tuesday's blast Lobozanov's men went in the direction 
of their enemy's headquarters. According to the Interior 
Ministry, it is doing its best now to stop the armed conflict 
from getting out of control.

  [Text] Vilnius 12 May TASS -- "In spite of the 
difficulties, current situation in the Russo-Lithuanian 
relations may be described as good. (The relations) are 
developing in accordance with the guidelines mapped out in the 
(bilateral) agreement of 25 July 1991 and the joint declaration 
signed by the Russian and Lithuanian presidents on 30 August 
1993," said President Algirdas Brazauskas of Lithuania in an 
interview with the "MEZHDUNARODNAYA ZHIZN" ("INTERNATIONAL 
ARENA") journal that comes out in Russia. 
  The whole text of the interview will be published in the 
next 
issue of the journal, but the official "ECHO OF LITHUANIA" daily 
published several excerpts from it on Thursday [12 May]. 
  "The visit of Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin was 
of great importance. (The two parties) signed during his visit a 
package of agreements on 18 November 1993. 
  ``One of the most important agreements -- the one on 
exchanging the most favoured nation status in trade and economic 
relations -- has not been put into effect as yet, unfortunately. 
Lithuania has fulfilled its treaty commitments - now it is 
Russia's turn,'' said Brazauskas. 
  According to him, there is no mention of Lithuania in the 
long list of 130 countries, which trade with Moscow in "free 
trade" and "most favoured nation in trade" format, although the 
relevant agreement has been signed. This is "disadvantageous 
and detrimental to both parties," he said. 
  "In our opinion, such economic statement has no future," the 
Lithuanian president emphasized in this connection. 
  Commenting on a recent exchange of messages with Russian 
President Yeltsin and telephone conversation with Chernomyrdin, 
Brazauskas said that, in his opinion, it was possible "to 
eliminate existing difficulties in our relations, which surfaced 
recently."

  [Text] Kiev 12 May TASS -- "We all are overwhelmed with 
the warmest feelings towards the Russian people and its 
legislators," the Ukrainian newly-elected parliament said in 
today's address to the Russian State Duma. 
  In their address, issued at the parliament's first session, 
Ukrainian lawmakers said they strongly believed in mutual 
understanding and ability of both parliaments to settle 
differences between newly-independent states by means of 
reasonable political bargaining and compromises not infringing 
upon the vital interests of the Russian and Ukrainian peoples. 
  It is noteworthy that Ukrainian lawmakers unanimously agreed 
with the wording of the telegram, but radical nationalists 
demanded that the telegram be written in the Ukrainian language, 
which is still unlikely to change the content of the address.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Lyudmila Aleksandrova and </F>
Lyudmila Yermakova] 
  [Text] Moscow May 12 TASS -- More than one hundred leaders 
of sport, youth, child, tourist, and women's organisations of 
Russia took place in the third stage of the Social Concord 
Agreement signing ceremony, which took place in the Kremlin 
today. 
  Signatures were previously attached to the agreement by the 
heads of Russia's executive and legislative branches of 
government, leaders of political parties and public 
organisations, and heads of industrial, business and financial 
associations. 
  Speaking during the signing ceremony, Chairman of the State 
Duma Ivan Rybkin expressed profound satisfaction with the 
progress of the signing procedure. "There were so many 
organisations wishing to sign the document," he noted, "that it 
was impossible to have them all sign the agreement 
simultaneously." Rybkin said this was "a very reassuring 
symptom". 
  Comparing the present Russian society with a very sick 
person, Rybkin said that this spring marked the beginning of 
changes and new tendencies, which will undoubtedly improve the 
national climate. He noted that substantial changes had 
occurred in the country after the December 12, 1993, elections. 
The Duma chairman believes that the Russian society today 
realises that nobody has any right to lay claim to political 
monopoly or, even more so, to undivided donimation. "If we want 
civil peace in Russia, we are simply `doomed' to concord," he 
noted. 
  Rybkin said that the formation of a bloc of political 
forces, 
capable of adopting serious and balanced decisions, was among 
the results of the current social changes in the country. He 
pin- pointed the president, the Federal Assembly and the Russian 
Government as the key figures of the current political process. 
"The most influential public forces," he stressed, "are 
definitely striving for civil peace and concord." 
  Rybkin described the Social Concord Agreement as another 
step 
towards strengthening Russia's statehood. He believes the 
document's special importance lies in the fact that its 
signatories have pledged to act jointly in order to eliminate 
the reasons leading to possible manifestations of mass 
dissatisfaction. "The agreement," he stressed, "envisages 
methods to eliminate conflicts among various political forces." 
  Noting that the Social Concord Agreement was not a panacea, 
Rybkin said that it was in the interests of concord not to 
dramatise the prevailing situation, but to use all the possible 
ways to improve it. 
  "Today's signing of the agreement by youth, sport, women's 
and charity organisations," head of the presidential 
administration Sergey Filatov said, "shows that not only 
politicised sections of our society are eager for concord." 
Interviewed by ITAR-TASS, he stressed that today's signing 
ceremony had confirmed that all the sections of the Russian 
society "solidarise with those who are working for concord." 
Filatov said that new groups of organisations were ready to sign 
the agreement. The next stage of the signing ceremony will be 
held in the Kremlin on May 19. Representatives of the artistic 
and scientific intelligentsia want to sign the document. They 
will be followed by an "industrial group" -- heads of large 
enterprises and concerns. A similar initiative is being 
displayed in the regions.

  [Text] The conciliatory commission for implementation of 
the civil accord treaty will possibly be chaired by First 
Vice-Premier of the Russian Federation Oleg Soskovets, head of 
the Russian presidential administration Sergey Filatov told IF's 
and RIA's correspondents on Thursday. 
  Filatov believes that Soskovets is a preferable candidate 
since this post requires a personality [word indistinct] the 
situation in the country well, especially in the economics. 
  Filatov thinks that it is so important, because the working 
groups implementing the civil accord treaty will focus in the 
first place on economic and social problems. 
  Filatov said that several "round-table" meetings will be 
organized on the issues embraced by the treaty: political 
stability, the overcoming of the socio-economic crisis, the 
federative structure, national security, science and culture. 
  These round-table meetings, Filatov said, will become kind 
of 
working centers and the first stage of conciliatory procedures, 
in the course of which concrete documents will be prepared. 
  "The conciliatory commission is designed to control the 
activities of "the round-tables" and to solve controversial 
issues which failed to be resolved at a lower level," Filatov 
said. 
  He noted that direct connection will be established between 
the commission and the president who "will take final decisions 
and give orders to specific organizations." 
  Filatov said: "There is a plan of legislative works which 
will be published soon. A group is already working in the 
administration: it prepares draft agendas for the round-tables, 
in particular, a document is under preparation regarding the 
concept of a new tax policy." 
  Filatov suggested that the conciliatory commission which 
will 
number 27 members will start working at the end of May.

  [Text] Kiev -- Ivan Kyshko, member of the Central Electoral 
Commission for the election of the president of Ukraine, 
informed a UNIAN correspondent on 11 May, (the last day for 
submitting lists of signatures in support of contenders for the 
presidential election) that documents from district electoral 
commissions on the results of collecting signatures have been 
received by the Central Electoral Commission. According to the 
documents, Ivan Plyushch, Leonid Kravchuk, Leonid Kuchma, 
Oleksandr Moroz, Volodymyr Lanovyy, and Petro Talanchuk have 
gathered the required number of signatures (100,000). According 
to Ihor Kyshka, Valeriy Babych, Ivan Valenya, and Mykola Rud, 
who were unable to gather the required number of signatures 
within the established time limit, have withdrawn from the 
election campaign. 
  With regard to the candidacies of Volodymyr Lanovyy and 
Petro 
Talanchuk, the Central Electoral Commission is clarifying 
information concerning the demands of the law on collecting 
1,500 signatures in 18 oblasts. 
  As a UNIAN correspondent learned from informed sources, the 
final number of signatures gathered is as follows: Leonid 
Kravchuk -- 270,000; Leonid Kuchma -- 210,000; Ivan Plyushch -- 
130,000; Petro Talanchuk -- 120,000; Oleksandr Moroz -- 120,000; 
Volodymyr Lanovyy -- 100,000.

  [Text] Moscow, May 15 (YONHAP) -- North Korea and Russia 
had talks here recently on the loggers, nuclear and other 
pending issues but failed reach any substantial accord on key 
matters, a diplomatic source here said on Saturday. The meeting 
took place between visiting North Korean Vice Foreign Minister 
Yi In-kyu and his Russian counterpart, Vice Minister Aleksandr 
Panov, on May 12-13. 
  On the loggers issue, the source said, Yi reiterated the 
Pyongyang stand that North Korean law, too, should be applied to 
their loggers in Siberia because he argued they are not simple 
foreigners but workers engaged in a specific duty agreed on 
between the two countries. 
  Vice Minister Panov was said to have rejected the North 
Korean demand, stressing that all foreigners staying in Russia 
are subject to human rights protection under Russian law 
regardless of the purpose of their stay in Russia. 
  As they failed to iron out their difference, the two 
officials decided to seek a compromise agreement during the 
meeting set to take place in Pyongyang shortly to discuss the 
question of concluding a new logging agreement. 
  Also at the meeting, Yi complained South Korea tries to 
induce some of their loggers in Russia to defect to South Korea, 
asking Russia to foil the scheme. Panov rejected the North 
Korean argument, telling them to produce the evidences, if any, 
of such scheme, the source said. 
  On the nuclear question, the Russian vice minister advised 
North Korea to accept international inspection of their nuclear 
facilities, the source said. He also urged Yi to see to it that 
his country accept a meeting of eight countries Russia had 
proposed to discuss the nuclear issue. 
  In reaction, the North Korean said that his country's policy 
is to resolve the nuclear issue through dialogue and that they 
would affirmative study the idea of eight countries meeting once 
the idea takes a concrete shape. 
  In the economic area, the two sides agreed to take a set of 
steps to reinvigorate their hitherto sluggish economic 
cooperation. 
  The measures they agreed included the promotion of 
joint-venture schemes and industrial partnership in the far east 
area of Russia, and staging of economy-related meetings often. 
  The North Korean vice minister further expressed concern 
about South Korean Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae's visit to 
Moscow last April. 
  Vice Minister Panov said Yi's visit was part of military 
exchanges between two neighboring countries, the source said.

  [Text] The Baltic Assembly urged Russia to recognize its 
responsibility for the damage caused by the USSR to the Baltic 
states during the occupation years. This was stated in the 
resolution on relations with Russia adopted by the Baltic 
Assembly. The session of the assembly finished in Jurmala today. 
  The resolution called on the Russian leadership to stop 
psychological pressure on Estonia and to withdraw the Russian 
troops by August 31, 1994. The resolution also demanded that 
Russian recognize the unsettled territorial problems in 
relations with Latvia and Estonia created by the USSR and 
refrain from pressure on the Baltic states when signing and 
implementing mutual treaties. The Baltic Assembly insisted that 
Russia officially recognize the fact of occupation of the Baltic 
states by the USSR in 1940. 
  The assembly adopted one more statement saying that any 
threat or form of pressure against one of the Baltic states will 
be regarded as that against all of them. This document appeared 
after the recent statement by Russian Defense Minister Pavel 
Grachev on possible introduction of additional Russian military 
contingency to Estonia. 
  A total of 108 documents were adopted by the assembly. This 
includes the treaty on cooperation between Latvia, Lithuania and 
Estonia, the provision on the Baltic Council of Ministers and 
agreements on cooperation in the sphere of energy supply, 
environment and others. 
  The Baltic Assembly confirmed the preparedness to cooperate 
with the Western European Union and NATO and with Western Europe 
countries. 
  The present session elected new leadership of the assembly. 
Lithuanian parliament's Vice Speaker Egidijus Bickauskas was 
elected its President. 
  The Baltic Assembly is the inter-parliamentary consultative 
and coordinating body uniting Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. It 
was set up in the end of 1992.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Gubarev article: "The Russian Atom and the </F>
American Ultimatum"] 
  [Text] It is already clear that the G-7 countries, to 
whose meeting in Naples Boris Yeltsin has been invited, has 
prepared a surprise or, to be more accurate, an ultimatum for 
him. The Russian president will have, together with his 
partners, to advocate the shutting down of the Chernobyl AES 
[nuclear electric power station]: Yeltsin's influence on 
Ukraine, it is said, will be crucial.... He will then be 
required to provide guarantees that Russian AESes where 
high-power pressure-tube reactors are in use will also be 
gradually withdrawn from operation. If Yeltsin does not agree, 
the Western countries "will deny aid." A similar ulltimatum has 
already been received by Ukraine: Economic aid to Kiev now 
depends directly on the shutdown of the Chernobyl AES reactors. 
  The "softening-up fire" prior to the decisive attack on the 
nuclear power industry of Ukraine and Russia was carried out at 
the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] session of experts 
held in Vienna. It is common knowledge that a commission set up 
by this international organization analyzed the condition of the 
Chernobyl AES. And although commission members were unable to 
prepare their findings prior to the Vienna conference and did 
not present their conclusions, the IAEA's decision was 
conclusive: It is essential to close down the reactors at 
Chernobyl and shut down the station, because it is "too old." 
The IAEA and other international organizations will help run 
other Ukrainian AESes only if Chernobyl is shut down. The IAEA 
is making precisely those recommendations in the runup to the 
G-7 meeting in Naples. The IAEA leadership is in a hurry: Only 
a little time remains before July, so they have decided not to 
wait for the special commission's findings. 
  The Ukrainian delegation has naturally disagreed with the 
IAEA. Western countries promised assistance, particularly as 
regards modernizing the power units at Chernobyl, a long time 
ago, but not a single dollar has been forthcoming. And to 
dismiss the AES at Chernobyl as "old reactors" is, to put it 
mildly, unjust. For the last two years the AESes of Russia and 
Ukraine have operated more stably and reliably than those in 
America, France, Sweden, and Germany. It is those countries 
which are the leaders in terms of the number of times safety 
systems have been activated. And the term "old" can only make 
specialists smile. More than 150 nuclear power units, of which 
around 50 are in the United States, are far "older" than the 
high-power pressure-tube reactors. Consequently, when they were 
designed and built, the safety requirements were quite 
different: Not a single one of those units meets requirements. 
  What, then, has produced the attack on the former USSR's 
nuclear power industry? The point is that in market relations 
economics and politics are closely allied. Russia, for example, 
has quit the arms markets. And now the United States sells 
weapons in countries which previously looked to us. 
  Uranium is next in line. Here competition is very tough, 
because selling uranium is a profitable business: It is small 
wonder that our country has always been subject to restrictions. 
The shutting down of reactors will enable Western and U.S. firms 
to penetrate not just East Europe but Ukraine and Russia too. 
Again, we are talking about billions of dollars. 
  Unfortunately, we ourselves are aiding and abetting our 
Western competitors. Russia's nuclear power stations receive 
scant finance. Loans to carry out maintenance and modernization 
are lacking and wages are constantly paid late. Where else 
could you find a country where the staff of nuclear power 
stations such as the Kursk AES have received no wages for six 
months and have declared a hunger strike in protest? Highly 
skilled specialists in any other country are not just well paid 
but are the state's pride and joy.... Perhaps we should accept 
the "ultimatum" of the world's leading countries and close down 
the AESes? But we must realize that we would then turn from 
being an exporter to an importer of energy. And no one will 
supply us with energy for free. So are we going to live by 
candlelight?

  [Text] Moscow May 16 -- The military leaders of Armenia, 
Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh are meeting in Moscow today to 
compare notes, with the mediation of the Russian Federation, on 
further steps towards the settlement around Karabakh. 
  The CSCE's Minsk conference on Karabakh Jan Eliasson [as 
received] told ITAR-TASS in Moscow that he hopes that the 
forthcoming Moscow meeting will become an important phase in the 
process of the settlement of the Karabakh issue. Eliasson 
called for the participation of international observers in 
ensuring the implementation of the ceasefire accords. The 
mechanism of international verification was in the focus of the 
consultations held by the joint mission of the Conference for 
Security and Cooperation in Europe and Russia in the region. 
  The Russian president's special envoy Vladimir Kazimirov, 
and 
the leaders of Armenia's defence ministry and the Karabakh army 
flew to Moscow from Yerevan on Sunday night to join the 
conference on Monday.

<F P=106> [Liana Minasyan report under the "Settlement" rubric: </F>
"South Ossetian Issue: Russia Is the Sole Mediator. 
Quadrilateral Talks Loom Ahead"] 
  [Text] A Georgian-Ossetian meeting (including both South 
Ossetia and North Ossetia) devoted to the problems of refugees 
and those subjected to forcible resettlement has been held in 
Vladikavkaz at the initiative of the CSCE mission. The meeting 
was attended by Aleksandr Tsvetkov, chief of the CSCE mission 
(Ukraine); Vazha Khachapuridze, plenipotentiary representative 
of the Georgian head of state; Znaur Gassiyev, first deputy 
chairman of the South Ossetia Supreme Soviet; and Yuriy Sedakov, 
chairman of the North Ossetia parliamentary committee for 
national policy and foreign affairs. 
  The sides concluded that the return of refugees has been 
complicated by the absence of a political settlement to the 
Ossetian-Georgian conflict, and agreed on the need immediately 
to set up expert groups to prepare quadrilateral talks between 
Georgia, South and North Ossetia, and Russia. 
  One of the most complex matters in the upcoming talks will 
be 
the state and legal status of South Ossetia. By the time the 
negotiations begin, a protocol of intentions will be signed, 
modeled on the Dagomys agreement on South Ossetia, and a range 
of matters to be discussed will be determined. North Ossetia 
took an active part in the preparation of the current meeting 
because, according to Yuriy Sedakov, the practice where 
hostilities have ended, but talks have not yet started, may lead 
to yet another round of tensions. 
  The second contentious matter -- the status of peacekeeping 
forces -- has also yet to be resolved. It is known that members 
of the CSCE mission question the legality of the current 
trilateral status of these forces because they include former 
combatants. 
  However, Vakhtang Rcheulishvili, deputy speaker of the 
Georgian parliament, thinks otherwise: he is even ready to 
admit that the Tskhinvali procedure for deploying peacekeeping 
forces may be repeated in Abkhazia. He said: "Similar problems 
-- separatism and status -- require similar solutions. But they 
cannot be absolutely identical. The same problems will be 
discussed in both Georgian- Abkhazian and Georgian-Ossetian 
negotiations, the only difference being our approach -- we 
oppose the internationalization of the Ossetian problem and 
raising it to the level of the CSCE or the United Nations. 
Russia will be the sole mediator in the settlement of this 
problem."

<F P=106> ["Russian National Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 14 ITAR-TASS -- Most national newspapers 
continue to cover and comment on President Boris Yeltsin's visit 
to Germany and his meeting with Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl. 
KRASNAYA ZVEZDA says that as a result of the successful visit 
Russia is now entering a new phase in relations with the West, 
and not as a loser. "But let us not give in to illusions. The 
new stage in relations with the West will not be simple. Our 
policy is now facing a double danger of lingering 
confrontational prejudices on the one hand and a belief in 
exclusively good-natured intentions of our partners on the 
other". 
  Russia's federal budget approved by the State Duma on first 
reading is another subject highlighted by many newspapers. 
ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI quotes Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin as 
saying "even prejudiced observers cannot fault the government in 
this case. We expect the deficit of the federal budget to reach 
68.8 trillion roubles, not to exceed 9.5 percent of the gross 
domestic product. The expenditures are increased by 10.1 
trillion roubles to amount to a total of 103.3 trillion roubles. 
Revenues will grow on a more modest scale, by 3.7 trillion 
roubles, to amount to a total of 124 trillion roubles." The 
minister added that "culture and health services will get an 
additional 968.4 billion roubles, and the allocations to support 
the mass media, particularly radio and television, will increase 
by 434 billion roubles." 
  State Duma Economic committee Chairman Sergey Glazyev 
disagrees. NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA quotes him as saying at a press 
conference that "the government has not made any substantial 
modifications in the budget. The policy behind the budget is to 
share out the resources between the fuel-and-energy and the 
agricultural sectors. It completely ignores the priorities set 
forth in the president's message on the state of the nation, 
which call for support of the science-intense industries and 
conversion of the defence industries to civilian production". 
  PRAVDA is sceptical about the draft federal budget: "Can one 
really rely on the articles of the budget, while the slump in 
production slides to 50 percent and while inflation gallops 
ahead of any forecasts of its mythical decline? How are 
factories and plants expected to pay taxes if they are not 
working?" 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA cites informed sources as saying that 
"on the desk of the president of the Russian Federation there 
lies a decree, already signed by Boris Yeltsin, dismissing 
Sergey Shakhray as the minister of nationalities, while 
retaining him as vice- premier in the Government of the Russian 
Federation". The newspaper believes that "Shakhray's 
resignation is due to the struggle between the regional elites 
of the north and the south. Being a minister, Shakhray 
succeeded in obtaining the endorsement of several agreements on 
the development of the northern territories, as a result of 
which the south was deprived of some state orders and budget 
infusions". 
  Shakhray himself explains in ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI why the 
government adopted a resolution to change the mechanism of state 
support and supplies of goods and foods to northern areas of the 
country. He says in particular that "the disruption of economic 
ties in the far northern areas and territories equal to them, 
sharp cuts in mining for raw materials, including oil, and the 
growth of transportation rates have placed under threat the 
delivery of vitally important goods to the population of the 
region". Shakhray also says that "many needs of the northerners 
are fully met only through supplies from other parts of the 
country. In the eighties, these supplies were financed through 
the crediting system, which is no longer possible at present". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA publishes an article by State Duma 
international affairs committee Chairman Vladimir Lukin, who 
says that "lately our foreign policy has been getting rid -- 
fully in words and to a certain degree in deeds -- from its 
pro-Western orientation. But there still remain many problems 
which have yet to be resolved on the path of overcoming this 
infantile syndrome". 
  SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA continues to comment of the "case" of 
Army 
General Valentin Varennikov who rejected the recent amnesty and 
is now working toward the institution of criminal proceedings 
against those who are to blame for the disintegration of the 
Soviet Union. The newspaper publishes an interview with Valentin 
Varennikov's defence lawyer Dmitriy Steinberg, who thinks that a 
new trial would not be long. "True. Everything will depend on 
whether the people whose testimony the court wants to hear, 
including (former Soviet President Mikhail) Gorbachev, will 
choose to turn up for questioning," the newspaper comments.

  [Text] Moscow May 13 TASS -- By ITAR-TASS correspondent 
Pavel Kuznetsov] 
  [Text] The State Duma (lower house of the Russian 
Parliament) 
adopted on Friday bills on corruption control and on amendments 
and addenda to the Criminal Code and the Criminal Procedural 
Code of the Russian Federation in the first reading. 
  A heated debate between factions preceded the approval. 
  Viktor Ilyukhin, chairman of the lower chamber security 
committee, who submitted the bills to legislators, noted that 
the need for their adoption is predetermined by the fact that 
crime in Russia has substantially changed its forms and 
substance. 
  According to the chairman, the number of the convicted for 
bribe- taking substantially decreased as compared with the 
1980s, which indicates that legislation is utterly outdated. 
  He stressed at the same time that mobs, using loopholes in 
the present laws, "influence the adoption of political decisions 
up to the level of member republics of the Russian Federation". 
  Ilyukhin reported that he has information showing that the 
underworld is laying hands on 55 per cent of capital and 80 per 
cent of voting shares in the country. The chairman stressed 
that the bill was drafted by specialists from the Prosecutor's 
Office, courts, the tax service, the Interior Ministry and the 
Federal Counterintelligence Service. 
  He noted that, in the opinion of foreign experts, measures 
in 
the bills aimed at fighting bribe-taking and corruption are 
"very lenient". 
  Representatives from the Russia's Choice, Yabloko and 
Russia's Women factions opposed the adoption of the bills in the 
first reading. Their main arguments were that the bills 
indicate an extremely broad range of people who can be held 
responsible for bribe-taking and corruption, while the state 
should, in fact, ensure control over incomes of the entire 
population. 
  Ilyukhin's opponents claimed that the mechanism of the bills 
will not permit to bring to court high-ranking grafters. 
  The Party of Russian Unity and Accord and the Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) supported the bills on the 
whole but suggested that they should be finalised, taking into 
account remarks at today's debate, and adopted in the first 
reading in the near future. 
  Advocates of the bills noted that their opponents poorly 
studied the documents and intend to dump them. They also 
claimed that fight against bribe-taking and corruption should be 
started from the lowest levels and that all law-breakers should 
be put in the dock, irrespective of their posts whether he is an 
engineer at a house- repair administration or a high-ranking 
politician. 
  LDPR leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy expressed a special 
opinion, noting that the bills are necessary. Nevertheless, 
their adoption will be useless. "The Duma is not ready to fight 
corruption in its ranks," he underlined. 
  "Therefore, it cannot fight corruption on a nation-wide 
scale," he claimed. This notwithstanding, Liberal Democrats 
voted for the adoption of the bills in the first reading.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 16 TASS -- State Duma member and former 
finance minister Boris Fedorov, an arch rival of chief banker 
Viktor Gerashchenko, resumed attacks on the Central Bank of 
Russia by proposing his own lawbill on the main financial 
institution of the country which caused bitter opposition of its 
representatives. 
  Deputy Chairman of the Central Bank Aleksandr Khandruyev 
told 
the Duma subcommittee on credit and monetary policy on Monday 
that the lawbill is "contradicting the constitution in the main 
provision regarding the independence of the Central Bank from 
executive and legislative authorities". 
  Fedorov proposed to set up an observers' council for the 
Central Bank. Besides, he envisaged a possibility for the 
Finance Ministry to temporarily suspend the activities of the 
Central Bank which cannot be done even by the president and the 
prime minister. 
  Khandruyev said that the lawbill establishes "collective 
leadership" for the bank which contradicts the constitution. 
  Fedorov fired back by saying that he was surprised by "the 
unconstructive position of the Central Bank". 
  Khandruyev's bitter criticism of the document was not shared 
by other people participating in the discussion. 
  Deputy Finance Minister Andrey Kazmin qualified the lawbill 
as "a serious attempt to establish a law of direct action for 
the Central Bank". Chairman of the Association of Russian Banks 
Vyacheslav Zakharov said the document "favourably differs" from 
the one drafted by the Central Bank itself, but admitted that 
the influence of the Finance Ministry, which Fedorov used to 
head, can be seen in it. 
  The subcommittee recommended the Duma to consider Fedorov's 
lawbill as an alternative to the draft of the Central Bank.
