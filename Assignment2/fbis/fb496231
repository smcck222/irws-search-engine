  [Text] Exercises by the Armed Forces of Kirghizia held 
the other day were marked by a shower of stars on commanders' 
shoulder boards. 
  By an edict of President Askar Akayev, four Kirghizian Army 
officers were simultaneously promoted to the rank of major 
general. Competent sources in the Defense Ministry claim that 
the Republic, whose Armed Forces number barely 15,000, now has 
22 serving majors general and three lieutenants general. True, 
the actual commander in chief, President Akayev, holds the 
modest rank of reserve colonel.

<F P=106> [Report by Yuriy Razgulyayev from Bishkek: "Sociology Is a </F>
Pseudo-Science in Kirgizia. This Is What Askar Akayev's Staff 
Has Decided"] 
  [Text] The results of a public opinion poll conducted in 
Kirgizia [Kyrgyzstan] by Professor K. Isayev, a well-known 
scientist, if published, could have caused a real sensation. 
But newspapers that regularly published similar materials did 
not find space for them this time around. 
  Let us disclose at once the reasons for this carefulness. 
According to the poll service, Askar Akayev, who has always been 
unrivalled in popularity ratings, ranked only... seventh! 
Topping the list is Apas Dzhumagulov, current prime minister, 
whose view on reform differs fairly significantly from that of 
the president. 
  Frankly speaking, this is a scandal. The desire of the 
"ruling circles" to delay the dangerous publication appears 
entirely natural. Instead, SLOVO KYRGYZSTANA, the government 
newspaper, has published an article entitled "Who Profits from 
Populism in Sociology?" Apparently it is not hard to guess what 
its thrust is. 
  But still, a complete "conspiracy of silence" regarding the 
poll has never materialized. Opposition newspapers published 
its results and gave their commentaries. 
  The article "refuting" sociology was followed by a statement 
from the presidential press service and vehement denunciations 
in televised addresses. But maybe they should have given a 
thought to it instead of getting so excited, shouldn't they? 
After all, a rating, for all its subjectivity, cannot drop by 
itself. 
  Right on the eve of the poll, the local press carried a 
report on removing K. Shakirov from the post of finance 
minister. He gave his relatives huge interest-free loans from 
the budget. Earlier, the parliament's controlling chamber named 
dozens of high-ranking officials engaged in tax evasion. Among 
them there was a brother of the president's chief of staff. 
People have noticed that blue Volvo cars presented to the 
president and other republican leaders by the notorious Siabeko 
firm have disappeared from parking lots outside White House 
entrances. They have been replaced with black Mercedes. Buses 
and trolleybuses in the city are running less and less 
regularly, however. I think it is these incidents, not 
Professor Isayev's mistakes, that have combined to play a 
malicious joke on President Akayev's popularity rating.

  [Text] The situation on the Tajik-Afghan border has been 
deteriorating over the past seven days, Chief of the Collective 
Peacekeeping Forces' Staff Colonel-General Grigoriy Bessmertniy 
told INTERFAX in an exclusive interview on Thursday [19 May]. 
  He said that due to general warming the high-mountain passes 
have become easily accessible to the opposition militants and 
that Tajik opposition military formations daily shell border 
posts from the rear and from Afghanistan. Attempts to cross the 
border have also become more frequent, he said. 
  He announced that on Thursday morning, footprints of about 
40 
people who had penetrated into Tajikistan had been discovered in 
the section controlled by the Khorog border-guard detachment. 
"The trespassers have not be found yet," he said. 
  Bessmertniy believes that preparations for the Muslim 
sacrifice festival, marked on 20 May, is containing a 
large-scale offensive by Tajik militants. 
  He also noted that the situation was particularly serious in 
the section running along the Ishkashim, Khorog, and Kalaikhum 
regions of the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region. The 
peacekeeping forces are not strong enough to block the mountain 
passes and roads linking Afghanistan and Tajikistan. 
  Although Kazakhstan signed the agreement on participation in 
the peacekeeping forces twice -- on September 24, 1993 and on 
April 15, 1994 -- it has not yet sent in its contingent, said 
Bessmertniy. 
  He announced that according to border guards, the armed 
opposition is concentrating forces in the Ishkashim direction. 
These forces are extremely mobile, well-prepared for warfare in 
the mountains, are equipped with the most up-to-date 
radio-communication equipment, know the terrain very well and 
have guides. 
  He said that no attempts had been made lately to start talks 
with the armed opposition, as was done last winter. He also 
said that the peacekeeping forces were ready to participate in 
the inter-Tajik talks, which, he said, would only benefit the 
parties concerned. 
  He said that the armed opposition was accumulating forces 
and 
armaments. "Only Allah knows what will happen in this region in 
the near future. Judging by all accounts, the situation on the 
Tajik-Afghan border will deteriorate," said Bessmertniy.

  [Text] Over the course of five days, Russian border guards 
carried out an operation to destroy gunmen in the rear sectors 
of the 11th and 12th posts of the Moskovskiy border guard 
detachment in Tajikistan. Since the beginning of May, gunmen 
have fired almost daily on details and military cantonments of 
the Russian border troops. According to preliminary 
information, which INTERFAX obtained from the press office of 
the Russian border troops, more than 20 gunmen of the Tajik 
opposition were killed and a large quantity of weapons and 
ammunition was seized during the operation.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Gridneva] </F>
  [Text] Dushanbe 20 May TASS -- The leaders of Tajikistan's 
security agencies have categorically rejected allegations about 
mass unrest and political ultimatums presented to the Tajik 
leadership by residents of the Gissar border region. Colonel 
Nikolay Madzhar, the chief of the Tajik Interior Ministry's 
public order directorate, told ITAR-TASS that the social and 
politic situation in the region remained stable and under full 
control. 
  The colonel admitted that a few small scale meetings had 
been 
actually held in the district administrative centre of Gissar, 
at which demands were voiced to put an end to criminal outrage 
in the district and ensure personal security of its inhabitants. 
  The meetings were provoked by a tragic incident which had 
occurred in Gissar on 5 May, in which eight people were killed 
in a bloody clash between two armed and uncontrolled groups. 
But the incident was not political in character. 
  According to the colonel, Tajikistan's Interior Minister 
Yakub Salimov arrived on the scene on the same day and the 
security forces detained more than ten instigators of the clash. 
The investigation is controlled by the minister and the 
Republic's chief prosecutor in person. 
  Colonel Madzhar said Tajikistan's leader Emomali Rakhmonov 
met representatives of the relatives of the people who were 
killed in a clash and assured them that the guilty militants 
would be punished exemplarily. 
  The colonel said certain political forces in the Republic 
and 
the Gissar region have been trying to use the Gissar incident to 
reach their own selfish ends. 
  Tajikistan's Security Minister Major-General Saydamir 
Zukhurov said the situation in the Gissar district was no source 
of alarm, because "political confrontation in that district is a 
fruit of sick imagination of the forces which are against peace 
and stability in the Republic and are not averse to using any 
methods to attain their own objectives."

  [Text] Tokyo 19 May TASS -- Uzbekistan President Islam 
Karimov departed the city of Osaka for home at the end of his 
first visit to Japan. During his stay in the land of the rising 
sun, the Uzbek leader held talks with Japanese Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata, was receieved by the Japanese emperor, met with 
representatives of the country's business circles, and visited 
the cities of Kyoto and Osaka. 
  Offical Tokyo gives the results of Karimov's visit high 
marks, a high-ranking official in the Japanese Internal Ministry 
told ITAR-TASS. "We think that the president's visit laid the 
basis for the development of friendly relations between 
Uzbekistan and Japan," he said. 
  The main event of the four-day visit were the talks, held on 
Tuesday, between the Uzbekistan president and Premier Tsutomu 
Hata. The two sides adopted a joint declaration which laid out 
the fundamental principles which are to guide Tokyo and Tashkent 
in the development of their mutual relations. In the document, 
the Uzbek side expresses support for according Japan the status 
of a permanent member of the UN Security Council. 
  The two signatories declared their intention to cooperate 
closely within the framework of the UN and other international 
organisations and their desire to expand the political dialogue 
between the two countries. 
  After adopting the joint declaration, the Uzbekistan and 
Japanese internal ministers signed a joint document stating that 
both sides consider that all the treaties signed by the 
former-USSR and Japan, which concern Uzbekistan remain in force 
between Japan and the now-independent republic. 
  During the Japanese-Uzbek summit meeting Tsutomu Hata 
announced that his country would give the Central Asian Republic 
an additional five million dollars in medical aid. The total 
sum of medical aid which Tokyo has pledged to Uzbekistan is now 
up to 15 million dollars.

Into Russia?"] 
  [Text] The opposition newspaper AZATAMART has published a 
sensational statement by Edvard Oganesyan, a Dashnak Party 
leader, director of the Foundation for Russian-Armenian 
Relations, and former chief editor of Radio Liberty's Armenian 
programs, which claims, in particular, literally the following: 
"Incidentally, we have learned from Russian official circles 
that the Armenian Government has already signed an agreement on 
the Republic's incorporation into Russia. This fact is being 
persistently concealed from the people, although I do not think 
that the people will condemn their president because of this. 
This information is still unofficial, but if the facts about 
the signing of the agreement are confirmed, the government's 
initiative can be understood only if the agreement was signed 
with Russia's real masters." 
  How did the Armenian authorities react to this report? Levon 
Zurabyan the president's press secretary described this 
information as "gibberish and a completely groundless 
fabrication."

<F P=106> [Report Yuriy Golotyuk in the "Nagorno-Karabakh" column: </F>
"The Cease-Fire Agreement May Be Signed After All. Everything 
Depends on the Azerbaijani Side"] 
  [Excerpt] As Armenian presidential aide Levon Zarubyan 
told SEGODNYA's correspondent yesterday, so far there is still a 
hope that the Azerbaijani side within the next few hours or days 
will sign an accord for a cease-fire in Karabakh and on military 
and technical aspects of disengagement of the warring sides. 
Because Russia, Armenia, and Nagorno-Karabakh have actually 
signed this document already, the accord will automatically come 
into effect. The presidential aide refused to say in how many 
days in this event Russian peace-keeping troops will appear in 
Karabakh, pointing out that "the document's details are 
confidential." 
  Mr. Zarubyan stated that the proposed option for a Karabakh 
settlement "is generally very favorable to Armenia because it 
essentially attests to its military victories, whereas for 
Azerbaijan it highlights its military failures." The Armenian 
presidential aide suggested this was the reason for Azerbaijan's 
unwillingness to sign the accord. 
  Other officials in Yerevan and Stepanakert yesterday 
refrained from comment on the results of a Moscow meeting 
between the defense department chiefs of Armenia, Azerbaijan, 
and Nagorno-Karabakh. On his return to Yerevan, Armenian 
Defense Minister Serzh Sarkisyan only stated the following, "God 
knows: Whether or not the Azerbaijanis will sign this document 
does not depend on us." He also voiced confidence that "the 
agreement will still be signed in the very near future." The 
diplomatic department is pinning serious hopes on a visit to 
Baku by Vladimir Kazimirov, the Russian president's special 
envoy, for talks on a settlement in Nagorno-Kazabakh. Yerevan 
believes that Mr. Kazimirov will possibly manage to sway the 
Azerbaijani side. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Yerevan ("AZG" daily), 05/19/94 -- "Armenia greets 
and appreciates the heavy burden of a disengager, which Russian 
Federation took," said acting spokesman of the President Levon 
Zurabyan regarding the recent meeting of Defense Ministers in 
Moscow. The Azeri delegation didn't sign the agreement for some 
reasons, and left for Baku to continue discussions. 
Nevertheless, the atmosphere of the Moscow meeting was such 
that the sides were close to a peaceful resolution of the 
conflict. "The fact is, there is no military euphoria neither 
in Mountainous Karabakh nor in Azerbaijan today," Zurabyan said. 
  Presidential spokesman considered a success the fact that 
Mountainous Karabakh was recognized as an equal side for the 
first time, and fully participated in negotiations. 
  Regarding the document, developed in Moscow on 17 May, 
Zurabyan said that its essence was in coordination of 
military-technical aspects of the cease-fire. It gives details 
about implementation of the cease-fire, the limits, to which the 
Azeri and RMK [Republic of Mountainous Karabakh] troops must be 
withdrawn, defines the order of stationing the observers, which 
will include military representatives of Russia, Armenia, 
Mountainous Karabakh, Azerbaijan, as well as CIS and CSCE member 
countries. "Armenia pays great importance to the CSCE 
participation in the observers mission and believes, this will 
significantly strengthen stability of the cease-fire," said 
Levon Zurabyan. Moscow meeting prepared a new agreement, called 
"An agreement on stopping the military conflict and eliminating 
its consequences," which will be signed on a highest level. The 
agreement stipulates withdrawal of armed forces from occupied 
territories, lifting the blockade and return of refugees. 
According to Zurabyan, this agreement will open the way for 
discussing the RMK status within the CSCE framework.

  [Text] Sergey Yushenkov (Russia's Choice faction), chairman 
of the Duma Defense Committee, said at a press conference that 
participants of closed parliamentary hearings on defense 
expenditure for 1994 have decided to insist on increasing 
spending from the planned 37 to 55 trillion rubles when 
discussing the second reading of the federal budget. 
  According to Yushenkov, cutbacks in defense spending at the 
moment were passing the point after which a breakdown would 
begin. 
  Deputy Chairman Aleksandr Piskunov said that President 
Yeltsin supported increasing defense spending. 
  First Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin said that over 
60 percent of the defense budget went on social expenditure 
linked to the unprecedented withdrawal of troops from foreign 
countries, including from former Soviet republics and the 
construction of housing for officers. 
  Answering an Interfax question on where additional 
expenditure would come from, Yushenkov said that the income part 
of the budget could be reconsidered. 
  He said that merely by cancelling privileges in foreign 
economic activity, income could be increased by five trillion 
rubles. Certain individual parts of budget could also be 
reconsidered, he said, such as expenditure on maintaining the 
state apparatus.

  [Text] [Correspondent Aleksandr Gerasimov] An increase in 
military expenditure, according to Sergey Yushenkov, the 
chairman of the Duma's Defense Committee, has practically been 
agreed with the president and the government and the Security 
Council. The additional 18 trillion [currency not specified], 
if they are approved by parliament, will be used for social 
provisions for servicemen and purchasing weaponry. At the same 
time, it is thought that the deficit in the state budget will 
not change by a ruble. The first 5 trillion rubles, the Defense 
Committee believes, can be obtained, for example, by removing 
privileges for foreign economic activities. The Defense 
Ministry has painstakingly substantiated its demands. Sergey 
Yushenkov described them with an artistic figure of speech. 
  [Begin Yushenkov recording] The situation is forming in such 
a way that the cuts in defense expenditure are going beyond a 
certain physiological frontier beyond which begins collapse. 
[end recording] 
  [Gerasimov] At the same time, it can be claimed that the 
original demands from the military for 87 trillion rubles were 
deliberately high. According to one version, the Defense 
Ministry was acting in accordance with the old Russian 
tradition--the more you ask for, the more you will be given. A 
second--put forward by Andrey Kokoshin, the first deputy defense 
minister--says that their experts were counting on higher 
inflation. 
  [Begin Kokoshin recording] Of course we would have preferred 
there to have been higher estimates of military expenditure, but 
taking into account the changes that are rapidly taking place in 
our economy, of course this level is closer to what is genuinely 
needed today to ensure the country's security. [end recording] 
  [Gerasimov] One way or the other, the military it seems are 
close to repeating the achievements of the agro-industrial 
complex-- they are receiving what they have demanded. What 
effect this will have on the economy or on the military itself 
will become clear after the budget is finally adopted by the 
State Duma. But now it is already obvious how badly thought 
through was a budget inside of which 18 trillions can be moved 
from one area to another. [video shows defense committee

<F P=106> [Unattributed report from ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, ITAR-TASS </F>
column under the "Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow" rubric: "Press 
Will Not Survive Without Concessions"] 
  [Text] "The only way of preventing an information vacuum 
is to provide the Russian mass media with tax, financial, and 
customs concessions." 
  Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko voiced that 
opinion at a meeting with journalists yesterday. As you know, 
he has sent the State Duma a draft law "On State Protectionism 
Toward the Russian Mass Media" by way of a legislative 
initiative. 
  Vladimir Shumeyko believes that all the mass media, apart 
from promotional and erotic publications, should be exempt from 
profits tax. The draft law that he is proposing contains the 
following stance: "The editorial offices of mass media, 
publishing houses, printing enterpries, television and radio 
companies, news agenices, and a number of other organizations 
'are not liable to value added tax, tax on enterprises' land and 
property, or profit tax in respect of the proportion payable 
into the federal budget.'" 
  The government has sent a similar law to the State Duma.

  [Text] Geneva, May 15, RIA -- We have come to the 
conclusion that the word "partnership" in the phrase partnership 
for peace should be given a deeper meaning, said Russia's 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. It will not be difficult to 
sign the existing Partnership for Peace document, and Russia has 
nothing against the framework agreement. 
  But since Russia believes that this document should be 
amended to take into account Russia's specific features and its 
relations with NATO, it will need time to draft the said 
document. It will not take long and the document is expected to 
be signed and formalised as a protocol, as President Yeltsin 
said in Bonn. Anyway, our intentions are serious and we are 
working hard to draft the document as soon as possible, Kozyrev 
said.

  [Text] Brussels, May 19, RIA -- "Russia's cooperation with 
NATO should be in line with its possibilities and intentions," 
NATO information department chief Francois Vilaneque told RIA. 
Commenting on Moscow's intentions to win a special status in 
relations with NATO, he compared the Partnership for Peace 
Programme with a restaurant in which every visitor chooses a 
dish to his or her taste. "Russia is a client like any other," 
said the department chief, "on accepting the programme, it has 
every right to build and develop its relations with NATO as 
believes most useful for her." 
  The NATO session in Brussels this week confirmed its former 
position: The Partnership for Peace Programme includes standard 
principles for all states joining it and cannot grant advantages 
to anybody. Having accepted its principles, every country 
chooses forms and volume of its individual participation in 
accordance with its wishes and capacities.

security system. Speaking at a press conference Friday he said 
the region where strategic interests of Russia, Japan, China, 
and the United States are closely intertwined lacks a mechanism 
to dovetail them. 
  He said Russia saw as its long-term strategic goal the 
formation of a collective security system involving all states 
situated in the region, and voiced confidence this initiative 
would be backed up by all states interested in maintaining peace 
and stability in the region.

  [Text] Moscow, May 12, RIA -- The State Duma's Committee on 
CIS Affairs and Liaison with Fellow-Countrymen, plans to propose 
a law on the granting of most favoured nation treatment, 
Konstantin Zatulin, committee chairman, told a news conference 
today. 
  This law, in his view, and also the use of a Russian 
military 
presence and economic levers could help to resolve conflicts in 
hot spots of former Soviet republics. 
  Zatulin told a RIA correspondent that such a regime could be 
granted to Byelorussia [Belarus], Turkmenia [Turkmenistan], 
Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan], Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. 
  "I would not grant it to Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, 
while 
in the case of Ukraine it is necessary to hold appropriate talks 
at first," noted Zatulin. 
  He further said that the committee he heads is now working 
on 
a declaration on principles of relations with former Soviet 
republics. 
  The document is planned to be completed by parliamentary 
hearings on problems of fellow-countrymen in the near abroad, 
scheduled for the end of June.

  [Text] Bucharest, May 6, RIA -- Foreign police officers 
will assist their Russian colleagues in combating the 
illegitimate transfer of capital from Russia to European 
countries. 
  According to Yuriy Melnikov, chief of the Interpol National 
Central Bureau in Russia, an understanding on this score was 
reached in the course of the 23rd European Interpol Regional 
Conference. 
  In the words of Melnikov, due to certain telecommunications 
measures, the system of prompt contacts between police services 
of 44 countries incorporated in European Interpol will be 
enhanced. The direct dialogue with colleagues from other 
countries, noted Melnikov, helped us clear up some particularly 
acute problems facing Russian law-enforcement officers, such as,

foreign make, including laser guns being bought by Russian 
Mafiosi.

<F P=106> ["U.Sd."-signed report: "Delamuraz Visits Moscow"] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 12 May -- At the beginning of a two-day 
visit to Moscow, Jean-Pascal Delamuraz, head of the Chief 
Department of Public Economy, on Thursday [12 May] signed a 
bilateral trade and economic agreement with Russian Prime 
Minister Chernomyrdin in Moscow that contains important 
regulations of the GATT Agreement. Trade between Switzerland and 
Russia currently stands at a relatively low level. The 
agreement will replace similar agreements that were concluded 
with the Soviet Union. In a news conference after the signing, 
Delamuraz made it clear that the agreement laid down the most 
important GATT principles for trade with Russia -- first of all, 
the principle of the most-favored-nation status and 
non-discrimination. Of major importance are also the 
regulations on improving the protection of the rights to 
intellectual property and the definition of those areas of 
economic cooperation that should be intensified with priority. 
  In a news conference, Delamuraz, who has been accompanied to 
Moscow by leading representatives of the Swiss business, made a 
point in stating that he was the first representative of the 
Swiss Government to visit the new Russia. He described as most 
successful and constructive his talks with Chernomyrdin. In 
answering a question regarding the banker's discretion, 
Delamuraz emphasized that Switzerland would try to strictly 
apply the money laundering article. In connection with the 
issue of aid, he referred to the East Europe credit, a sizable 
part of which will go to the CIS countries. 
  Before his departure, Delamuraz described trade between 
Switzerland and Russia as insufficient and far beneath what was 
possible -- and quite rightly so: In 1993, the official trade 
volume was 700 million Swiss francs, which is hardly worth 
mentioning compared to the 2 billion francs in the Soviet era 
(which was not a lot at the time either). Imports to 
Switzerland reached 376 million francs, while exports to Russia 
stood at 327 million francs. Compared with the previous year, 
this means an increase by 12 percent (imports) and 23 percent 
(exports); however, in view of the almost insignificantly low 
overall trade volume, these figures are hardly relevant. The 
5-percent growth in imports in the first quarter of 1994 and the 
80-percent increase in exports should not be overestimated, 
either, particularly since the Russian Government currently 
appears to be greatly inclined to deter potential investors with 
a flood of regulations and duties.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Conclusion of Delamuraz' Visit to </F>
Moscow"] 
  [Text] Moscow, 13 May -- The chief of the [Swiss] 
Department of Public Economy, Jean-Pascal Delamuraz, reported 
that, during his talks in Moscow, he encountered a high degree 
of realism, determination, and willingness for reform. 
Concerning the financial problems of Swiss companies, a 
solution is to be achieved before the end of the summer. 
  Delamuraz continued his talks with the Russian leadership on 
Friday [13 May]. As he pointed out during a brief news 
conference at the Swiss Embassy, he met with a high degree of 
mutual trust, remarkable openness, and particularly clear 
concepts. His talks were never characterized by naivete or 
uncertainty, Delamuraz stated. He is convinced of the 
willingness of the Russian Government to continue the reforms. 
The Russian side was aware of the numerous existing problems, 
it wants to tackle them, and showed no signs of discouragement. 
  On Friday Delamuraz held talks with, among others, Deputy 
Prime Minister Chubays, who is responsible for privatization, 
central bank leader Gerachenko, and Duma chairman Rybkin. 
During his meeting with Chubays, Delamuraz was assured that the 
work that has been commenced will be completed successfully. 
The head of the Department for Public Economy had the 
impression that the Russians know that important decisions still 
have to be made. Delamuraz inquired about the possibilities and 
conditions of foreign participation in the privatization and 
stated that Switzerland believes that access for interested 
foreign companies should be facilitated. 
  The head of the economic delegation that accompanied 
Delamuraz to Moscow, Andres Leuenberger, stated that he has the 
feeling that privatization has now become irreversible. 
However, he does not believe that there will be a boom of Swiss 
investments in Russia in the near future. 
  The specific issues that Delamuraz discussed with the 
Russian 
leadership included unsettled claims by Swiss suppliers and 
Yeltsin's decree which canceled a decision by the government 
last November and which limited the activities of Western banks 
to business with so-called nonresidents. A total of 83 Swiss 
companies have reported claims vis-a-vis the former Soviet Union 
that are not covered by the export risk guarantee. The 
unsettled sums involve a total of approximately 320 million 
Swiss franks. However, it can be assumed that the real claims 
are even higher because not all Swiss companies have contacted 
the Swiss Embassy in Moscow. 
  According to Delamuraz, progress has been achieved 
concerning 
a solution to this -- old -- problem. He was assured by the 
Russian side that the issue will be tackled before the end of 
the year. A decision on the bank decree is expected by June.

<F P=106> [Report by Kenneth Gooding in London and John Lloyd in </F>
Moscow: "De Beers in Russian Diamond Accord"] 
  [Text] De Beers of South Africa stepped back from a 
potentially serious conflict yesterday by agreeing to consider 
changes to its $5bn (3.3bn pound) diamond marketing contract 
with Russia. 
  At the same time the Russian government representatives 
agreed "to take necessary steps" to stop rough (uncut) diamonds 
leaking from Russia through unofficial channels to the west 
where they threatened to destabilise the market. 
  Trade sources suggested that, after the Russians were 
publicly rebuked by De Beers in December for breaking the 
contract, the flow of unofficial diamonds eased but recently it 
had been increasing again. 
  There were sighs of relief in the diamond trade yesterday 
because Russia supplies about 25 per cent of the diamonds De 
Beers sells through its London-based Central Selling 
Organisation [CSO]. The CSO controls more than 80 per cent of 
the world's trade in rough diamonds. 
  In 1990 De Beers lent Russia $1bn, shipped some of the 
Russian stockpile to London as collateral and signed the 
five-year marketing agreement. This permits Russia to sell 5 
per cent of its rough diamond output directly to the west for 
"market testing". 
  While there are no indications that Russia wished to end the 
contract with the world's most successful cartel, some officials 
have been pressing for the federation to keep a bigger share. 
Mr Yevgeniy Bychkev, head of Komdragment, the Russian diamond 
and precious stones committee, who was in the Russian 
negotiating team this week, is demanding that Russia be able to 
keep 25 per cent of its rough diamond trade. 
  The De Beers team was headed by Mr Nicholas Oppenheimer, its 
deputy chairman and chairman of the CSO. According to diamond 
trade sources he stepped in at the last moment because 
relationships had become strained. 
  Mr Gary Ralfe, who negotiated the Russian contract and 
publicly castigated Russia for breaking it, was previously 
expected to head the De Beers team. He was in Moscow with Mr 
Oppenheimer, however. Mr Richard Wake-Walker, previously De 
Beers' representative in Moscow, quit the group recently after 
being replaced by Mr Ray Clark. The Diamantaire trade 
newsletter suggested Mr Wake-Walker "advocated a flexible 
negotiating strategy with Russia while Mr Ralfe and Mr Clark 
appear to be taking a tough, no-concessions approach". 
  The large delegation with which Russia faced Mr Oppenheimer 
included representatives from the Sakha diamond-producing 
region, as well as the Russian diamond committee and the 
Ministries of Finance and Foreign Economic Affairs -- among whom 
the right approach is still being debated. Russia's need for 
increased income from exports has been aggravated by the recent 
fall in the oil price, its main export earner -- and by the 
virtual disappearance of its manufactured goods from the world 
market. 
  A joint communique yesterday said "the parties remain 
committed to the existing agreement, pending their agreeing on 
any modification. They are also committed to the stability of 
the international diamond market and to taking the necessary 
steps to curtail Russian rough gem diamonds reaching the market 
outside the current marketing arrangements."

  [Text] Khabarovsk, May 6, RIA -- Speaking at a press 
conference in Khabarovsk, Viktor Ishayev, head of the Khabarovsk 
territory's government, said that the government agreement 
between Russia and China, signed by Mikhail Gorbachev and his 
foreign minister Aleksandr Bessmertnykh in 1991, must be 
abrogated. Mr. Ishayev said that the agreement harmed the far 
eastern regions of Russia and the country as a whole and accused 
its authors of having failed to take into account many economic 
and historical factors. 
  Taking advantage of that agreement, the Chinese authorities 
want their civilian and military ships to be given free passage 
in the Russian waters along the Rivers Ussuri and Amur and 
demand that Russia cede to China a number of islands in the Amur. 
  "We want to trade and improve relations with China, but in 
doing so we shouldn't harm our own interests," Mr. Ishayev said.

  [Text] Beijing, May 15, RIA -- Satisfied with the talks 
with Chinese colleagues, Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the State Duma 
of the Federal Assembly of Russia, pointed to the importance of 
restoring Russo-Chinese parliamentary contacts at a briefing at 
the end of his delegation's second day in China. 
  "The talks are conducted in a businesslike and serious 
atmosphere," he said. The Russian delegation "is accumulating 
information vital for cooperation." The sides expressed 
interest in developing contacts between the north-eastern part 
of China and Siberia, exchanged opinion on international 
problems and discussed the situation in the planet's hot spots. 
  Rybkin said that good relations developed between the State 
Duma and the Russian Government in the past four months. He 
also said about potential candidates to the post of the Russian 
president: "We will continue to be short of leaders until we 
establish elections of administration heads." When asked if he 
would run for the post, Rybkin replied that many people don't 
suspect the burden of responsibilities of the president.

  [Text] Moscow, May 19, RIA -- A State Duma delegation has 
returned from China in the early hours of May 19. It was 
staying there since May 14 at the invitation of the Chinese 
parliament's standing committee. The Russians met with state 
and communist leaders, visiting several enterprises and free 
economic zones. 
  According to Speaker Ivan Rybkin, the reforms must be 
implemented in a capable manner, with due respect toward history 
and traditions. He also stressed the need for economic and labor 
incentives. For his part, Mikhail Lapshin, leader of the 
Agrarian Party, says Russia shouldn't have destroyed the old 
system and that it ought to have borrowed some useful aspects as 
China had done. Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the Duma's 
foreign-affairs committee, stressed that the trip had corrected 
a small infatuation with Western-style politics and economics, 
saying that the Chinese economic-reform experience was quite 
interesting.

to Russia for constructing a floating plant to utilise 
radioactive waste in the Russian Far East, the JAPAN TIMES 
reports today with references to governmental sources. In 
exchange for aid, Russia has promised to refrain from dumping 
waste in the Sea of Japan. The agreement was reached earlier 
this month. The project is worth several million dollars. 
Funds for this purpose are to be allocated from the amount of 
US 100 million, which Japan promised to Russia and other 
republics of the former USSR for the elimination of nuclear 
weapons. It is planned that the project, where liquid waste is 
to be condensed into solid matter and then sent to land-based 
storages, will be completed early in 1995.

<F P=106> [Report on Interview with Russian President Boris Yeltsin by </F>
Peter Millar in Moscow; date not given, with additional 
reporting by Matthew Campbell; from the SUNDAY TIMES News Review] 
  [Text] Moscow at the fag end of winter is filthy at the 
best of times. These are not the best of times. 
  On the barren earth outside the city's Kiev station -- which 
daily disgorges economic refugees from the hyper-inflated 
poverty of the Ukraine -- Moscow council' s perennial workforce 
of shabby, prematurely aged, thirtysomething women empty rubbish 
bins on to dirty plastic sheets, drag the contents to a dusty 
patch of dried mud amid bare trees, and set fire to them. 
  In the background stands the Slavyanskaya, the Russian 
flagship of an American hotel chain and host to President Bill 
Clinton during his Moscow visit. Only three years old and an 
emblem of the new world order in the heart of the old evil 
empire, its bathtaps now spit brown water speckled with grit. 
An entire floor is undergoing major renovation, as if even the 
hotel's concrete casing has fallen victim to Russia's incurable 
ailment: attrition of the soul. This has been a long, cold 
winter, spring has been late in coming and nobody knows what the 
summer may bring. 
  The furthest east of Europe's great cities, 
schizophrenically 
straddling the invisible fault line with Asia, Moscow today is 
being devoured by its inhabitants: a metropolis in the grip of 
gangsters, drug-pushers and pimps. A society where the state 
once ruled by fear, and commerce was a crime, has been replaced 
by a jungle in which commerce is ruled by fear and anyone who 
indicts crime is blown away by a shotgun-wielding hitman on his 
doorstep. 
  Russia today is trapped in a moral miasma, a fin de siecle 
social and cultural wasteland; the old idols have fallen, but no 
new order has emerged to take the place of the toppled totems; 
in the maw of chaos, there is only one fixed point -- demigod or 
demagogue -- Boris Yeltsin. 
  In four years, the big man has slowed down. He may be 63, 
but his build is as imposing as ever, his bearing as erect, 
though now it hints at stiffness, even arthritic pain. The blue 
eyes are no longer as bright or as penetrating, more inclined to 
glaze over on a warm afternoon. These have been a world-shaking 
four years by anyone's standards. 
  In the spring of 1990, he was still a wild card on the 
fringes of Russian politics: a former Gorbachev ally ousted from 
the ruling Communist party politburo and cast into disgrace, but 
against the odds he climbed slowly back up the moving ladder of 
the crumbling Soviet power structure. He operated from a 
nondescript office on a high floor of one of the drab tower 
blocks on the broad thoroughfare then called Kalinin Prospect 
(after one of Stalin's stooges), but has since been renamed New 
Arbat Street. Yeltsin then was a man in the grip of obvious 
ambition: for power and for revenge on those who had humiliated 
him. 
  Today, behind a formal gilt desk in the opulent splendour of 
the Kremlin palace, with a chess clock in front of him to 
dictate his timetable, he shows the stress left by the 
intervening years. Years that saw him become Russia's first 
democratically elected president, the crucial step in the quiet 
internal coup that stole the heartland of the Soviet empire from 
under Mikhail Gorbachev's feet. Unexpectedly, he became a global 
symbol of freedom and bravery as he stood on top of a tank to 
defy plotters who wanted to turn back the clock. 
  Last October, though, it was Yeltsin who gave the orders to 
spill blood on Moscow streets, sending in tanks and reluctant 
troops to storm the parliament building he had once defended, 
and end a stalemate with the remnants of the old regime. He has 
a right to look tired. 
  He becomes animated only when asked if he might ever be 
forced to revisit that dark hour last October when he had to go 
cap in hand to the military and beg them to follow his orders, 
uncertain how they would reply. 
  "Today," he suddenly booms, grasping a pair of pencils like 
the hilt of a sword and banging on the table, "today, the army, 
the security service, the foreign intelligence service, the 
ministry of internal affairs are all loyal to the president and 
to the nation. They are marching behind him." 
  He pauses for dramatic effect before adding in a low growl: 
"And they will continue to march behind him." 
  So would he ever again doubt his grip on the forces of law 
and order? The answer is a brusque, definitive "Nyet". Then, 
with the glimpse of a half-smile that remains part of the man's 
charm: "At least I hope not." 
  The question today is what did he save, and for whom? His 
very assertiveness has created a vacuum of reasonable men around 
him, an absence of obvious successors. In a quiet, serious 
voice, he concedes: "I am very troubled by this. Two or three 
years soon fly past. It is a very difficult and complicated 
task in this time to bring up a president who would be supported 
by the whole people, by all 120 million voters." 
  He is dismissive of the man the West has demonised, Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy, leader of the extreme right. "Zhirinovskiy has no 
hopes," he said. "Russians have been suffering for seven 
decades with totalitarian regimes, so they are not likely to be 
seduced by right-wing dictators. I'm sure of that." 
  It is not so easy to dismiss the Zhirinovskiy cocktail: a 
well- stirred, fervent pan-Slav patriotism that embraces 
outspoken nostalgia for the Soviet Union as a Russian empire and 
has managed to unite new fascists and old communists marching 
together under red banners and orthodox icons. 
  Yeltsin's dilemma remains his obligation to keep a weather 
eye on Western reaction to any crackdown that could be 
considered a slip back towards repression, yet still pre-empt 
politically organised disturbances that could hide a fresh 
attempt at revolution. 
  "It's high time we made these parties obey the force of the 
law," he snarls. 
  Yet the unexpected success of Zhirinovskiy's faction in the 
December elections and the surprisingly solid showing of the 
communists have influenced Yeltsin's rhetoric, reintroducing 
hints of old cold-war-speak to reassure those who believe the 
country has been sold out to the West in exchange for a delivery 
note for a mess of pottage. 
  Yeltsin had implied he would sign Nato's "partnership for 
peace" pact by the end of March, but is now dallying: "There are 
no political reservations... but some technical problems still 
need clarifying." 
  Despite a personal appeal by William Perry, the US secretary 
of defence, Yeltsin has ordered the postponement of the first 
joint Russian-American military manoeuvres, which would have 
been held on Russian soil, to avoid jeopardising an accord 
reached with his opponents in parliament to allow the easy 
passage of much-needed economic legislation. 
  This is a man who cannot be seen to be cowed. The suggestion 
that biological warfare research, which The Sunday Times 
revealed had been continuing behind his back, might still be 
going on, is rejected testily. "I can be sure," he says, 
"because my decree set up a very serious commission that checked 
all the points and the whole programme has been shut down. We 
suggested to the Americans that they join the commission to go 
to see any points they like." 
  Yet the increasingly common public perception that 
once-mighty Russia has become an American client state is one 
that rankles not just with Yeltsin's concerns about voting 
patterns but with his patriotism. In a private meeting with 
chiefs of his Foreign Intelligence Service (the overseas 
espionage wing of the former KGB) 10 days ago, he called for 
increased vigilance against the CIA, accusing the American 
intelligence service of continuing to try to recruit agents in 
Russia, adding that "certain powers" had an interest in "keeping 
Russia paralysed". 
  There is no doubt that the man who has consistently played 
the Western card in Russian politics is bitter that the West has 
not yet come up trumps in terms of material support: "Such sums 
aren't coming. In Tokyo (at the G7 economic summit) they said 
$44 billion. We received $1.5 billion. I don't know what will 
happen in Naples. I think they are more interested in their own 
difficulties, even though we are all in one boat." 
  It is with obviously sad pragmatism and no small touch of 
self- conscious irony that the first Russian leader since 1917 
to see and accept his country's interdependence on the global 
economy finds himself forced to criticise the short-sightedness 
of others. Of Moscow's Western partners he has words of praise 
only for Germany and dismisses Britain's contribution to the 
Russian reform process as "one of the last". 
  Yet he clearly expects little else. "What we want is an end 
of discrimination against Russia in terms of trade, economic co- 
operation, membership of international organisations and so 
on... We don't want special conditions, but we also don't want 
to be subject to discriminatory clauses." 
  External discrimination and insufficient aid are not the 
root 
of Russia's problems. The transition from dictatorship to 
democracy, from sick centralised superpower to healthy, wealthy 
market economy remains wrapped in trauma. At the heart, with 
tentacles embracing every aspect of the embryonic economy from 
small shops to banking, is a home-grown mafia with no conception 
even of what the law ought to mean in a society that has been 
turned on its head and shaken. 
  Yeltsin's analysis and prognostications sound glib at best, 
at worst over-optimistic and ill-informed, reminiscent of the 
most fatuous of old-style Soviet statements, as if his 
presidential absolutism gave him the power to halt crime by 
making it illegal. "We have passed a decree on reinforcing the 
struggle against organised crime in the country and it has 
produced positive results. At present the rate of increase in 
criminality has been contained. It is down five times compared 
to the same time last year." 
  Thankfully, realism intervenes: "But we cannot say we are 
satisfied... We are recruiting more policemen, we are producing 
more of our own equipment and importing from abroad to furnish 
our police up to the level of other countries." 
  His grounds for optimism, though, are those of socialist 
utopians down the ages: "I think that changes will be seen here. 
With the improvement of the economy and the material standard 
of living, crime will decline." Maybe, Boris, maybe. 
  Meanwhile the wages of sin are good enough for the new rich 
of Russia; on a late midweek evening in the Teatro grill at the 
back of the Metropol Hotel next door to an electronically 
protected, used- car lot that clogs the once proletarian 
pavements, sharp young men in designer sports jackets 
brandishing mobile telephones like the fly whisks of oriental 
despots are ordering Canadian lobster and French champagne. 
There is something of egalitarianism left: they share their 
table with burly minders in leather jackets. The moll is there 
too, complete with tumbling Barbie doll peroxide locks and a 
crotch-hugging micro skirt. 
  The cynical view is that not only has Russia's moral and 
social switchback ride made the mafia inevitable, but also in 
the medium term it may even be necessary. Its single-minded 
dedication to the individual profit motive makes it an armed and 
lethal third force against those who would restore state 
collectivism. 
  A period of anarchic semi-lawlessness -- like the American 
west in the 1880s or Chicago in the 1920s -- may be the 
purgatory that Russia will have to go through to emerge with any 
semblance of sanity. How long it will last is anyone's guess, 
but it will last longer than Yeltsin. 
  To paraphrase John Reed, the American chronicler of the last 
Russian revolution, the wrong-headed one of 1917: I have seen 
the future, and it scares me like hell.

  [Text] Moscow (DPA) -- Upon his departure for a three-day 
official visit to Germany, Russian President Boris Yeltsin said 
that the Russian troop withdrawal from Germany should be 
followed by a "phase of national reconciliation." Yeltsin told 
journalists at Vnukovo Airport that he expected difficult talks 
with Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Russia's debt problem and 
the issue of the farewell ceremony for the Russian armed forces 
in Germany. 
  Yeltsin confirmed that Germany is meeting all its social 
obligations, including the construction of housing for the 
troops returning from Germany. "Germany is the only country 
that is strictly fulfilling its obligations," the president 
said. "They (the Germans) have even made available an 
additional sum of 550 million German marks to step up the 
construction of soldiers' housing." 
  According to Yeltsin, Germany as an economic power ranks 
third in the world. That is why Russia must above all put its 
stakes in Europe on cooperation with Germany, Yeltsin said. 
Yeltsin does not intend to discuss in Bonn the return of 
artistic items that were taken during World War II. He said 
that this was a matter to be dealt with by "the specialists." 
"They will find a solution, and the politicians will listen to 
them."

<F P=106> [Interview with Viktor Ilyushin, chief adviser of Russian </F>
President Boris Yeltsin, by Jochen Piest and Matthias Schepp; 
place and date not given: "Germany is Our Closest Partner"] 
  [Text] [STERN] What does Boris Yeltsin want to achieve in 
Bonn? 
  [Ilyushin] Even now, Germany is our closest partner. As a 
result of such a visit, the relations will become even more 
intensive and even more friendly. 
  [STERN] However, the relations are not completely unclouded. 
There is a controversy between you and the FRG Government over 
the farewell for the Russian troops in eastern Germany. Russia 
wants a joint parade with the Allies, while the West is against 
it. 
  [Ilyushin] Kohl and Yeltsin will find a dignified form. 
  [STERN] Kohl and the West do not know either whether Russia 
will accede to the NATO program, "Partnership for Peace," like 
other former Eastern Bloc states. 
  [Ilyushin] Proceed on the assumption that Russia's position 
is determined by its president. Controversies in the Cabinet 
are natural. This is democracy. 
  [STERN] Will Russia accede to it? 
  [Ilyushin] Russia will sign it. However, in the dialogue 
with NATO, Russia's place and role indeed have to be clarified. 
It is a mistake not to reckon with Russia in world politics. 
This is shown by Yugoslavia's example. 
  [STERN] Rumors that President Yeltsin is fatally ill and 
that the West might lose its guarantor of a predictable Russian 
foreign policy continue to be heard. 
  [STERN] I work with him every day -- for 12, 14 hours and 
more. A sick man would not be able to keep this up.

  [Text] Moscow, May 19, RIA -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin, at a meeting with the country's top economic 
executives, today described the situation in Russia's economy 
and reforms as "near to a collapse". 
  He was talking with heads of plants, companies and financial 
groups -- both state-operated and market-based ones. Taking 
part in the meeting was Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin. 
  Although the "pre-collapse" state, according to Yeltsin, is 
typical of not all enterprises, still "such a danger exists". 
The president said that he had "discussed in detail" the 
situation in production and the economy with the prime minister, 
outlining measures for its improvement. Political issues were 
not touched upon, for they are "more or less defined". 
  The president believes that the political situation is 
"sufficiently favourable for foreign investments in the Russian 
economy". 
  Following this discussion, said the president, the 
government 
has drafted eight decrees linked with the improvement of the 
economy. 
  "In order not to make a mistake," Yeltsin addressed the 
audience, "we have invited you to look together into the 
decisions which we have not yet adopted but would like to adopt". 
  Then the meeting went on behind closed doors.

  [Text] Bonn, May 13, RIA -- Russian Vice-Premier and 
Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin told a RIA correspondent 
here yesterday that restrictions on Russian exports cost his 
country up to three billion dollars a year. He said that Russia 
lost vast sums of money from restrictions on the sale of 
uranium, aluminium, fertilizer and commercial space launches. 
In some cases, Mr. Shokhin said, Russia is still considered a 
communist country with a centrally-controlled economy, although 
more than half of all Russian enterprises are now in private 
hands. We have more private enterprises than some other 
countries, he said. 
  Mr. Shokhin said that this year Russia will revise its 
entire 
tax system and may reduce import taxes. The Russian 
vice-premier said that the Russian Government regarded as its 
major task the search for non-inflationary methods of containing 
production decline, which reached 26 per cent during the first 
four months of the year. According to the vice-premier, the 
Russian Government is now actively engaged in drafting laws 
designed to encourage foreign investment. Some of the bills 
have already been submitted to the Russian parliament. 
  Predicting imminent changes in the investment climate in 
Russia, Mr. Shokhin urged Russia's foreign partners to 
co-operate more actively with the new market structures rather 
than count on the central government guarantees. He reported 
that Russia would be gradually adopting new forms of investment 
guarantees, such as mortgage, the sale of products for rubles 
and guaranteed re- conversion of rubles into hard currency.

<F P=106> [Report on article by Russian Prime Minister, Victor </F>
Chernomyrdin, on Russia's commitment to economic reform: "No 
Exits on the Road to Market"] 
  [Text] In the past three months the west's view of Russian 
reform has undergone a significant evolution. 
  From the panicky statements about a "reactionary turn in the 
economy" to the forecasts of a burst of hyperinflation which 
prevailed in January, the world's media has begun to offer a 
more considered and objective view. And though at the beginning 
of the year some ultra-radicals, including some of our own in 
Russia, called on the west not to give a cent to the "red 
directors" who had taken control of the Russian government, the 
International Monetary Fund still took the symbolic decision to 
assign to Moscow the second tranche of a $3bn loan in exchange 
for commitments to market reform. 
  What happened in these first 10-12 weeks of this year to 
justify the IMF's decision? There was no great turnover of 
ministers in the Russian government. The economic reform 
programme, adopted in August 1993, did not change. Most 
significantly, events themselves have refuted the unscrupulous 
allegation that our course would change, an allegation that 
proceeded simply from the political ambitions of those who made 
it. 
  The continuation of reform, financial stabilisation and 
structural change remain the core of Russia's economic policy. 
The economic evidence of the first three months of this year 
attest to that. Between February and April, the monthly rate of 
inflation fell to 10 per cent. We do not expect the picture to 
change in May. In the planned 1994 budget, the deficit is pegged 
at 9 per cent of gross domestic product. By observing these 
parameters, we will see inflation lowered to a monthly rate of 
7-8 per cent by the end of the year. 
  To achieve this goal we must adopt the most resolute 
measures 
aimed at limiting the budget deficit and the emission of 
credits. In particular, we took a difficult decision to increase 
state revenues by changing a range of previously-fixed taxes, 
customs and excise duties. And we did that against the backdrop 
of a 25 per cent fall in production in the first quarter of this 
year compared to the corresponding period in 1993. At the same 
time we continued to carry out a tight monetary policy to which 
the central bank interest rate -- significantly higher than the 
inflation rate in the past few months -- bears witness. 
  It is vitally important that every member of the Russian 
government fully understands that a strong rouble is the 
indispensable condition for the revival of the Russian economy, 
and the Russian state as a whole. Naturally, as elsewhere in 
the world, ministers will lobby for more resources. However as 
every member of the Russian government knows, the important 
thing is not the amount of money they receive; rather it is that 
the money they get should have a real and lasting worth. It is 
counter-productive to have a currency which in one month alone 
loses about a quarter of its value. Such has been the fate of 
the rouble. 
  Our common task is thus clear: to ensure that Russian 
citizens should know that everything their government does is 
directed towards protecting the purchasing power of the rouble, 
so that with these roubles Russian citizens will be welcomed 
anywhere in the world. 
  The question naturally arises as to why we do not introduce 
an even tougher financial policy and limit even more tightly 
budgetary expenditure so as to bring down inflation more 
rapidly. We are told by critics that in other countries, in 
eastern Europe and the Baltics for instance, the authorities 
have managed to achieve financial stabilisation more quickly. 
And when we insist, in defence, that Russia is fundamentally 
different from these countries, our critics retort that all 
countries are different but that economic laws work in the same 
way everywhere. 
  Posing the question in this way reveals an inadequate 
understanding of the specifics of the Russian situation. In a 
small state the government can follow what happens in every 
large enterprise and, where needed, take urgent action: in 
Russia, however, the geography of the country significantly 
reduces such a possibility. 
  If a disaster strikes a small country and its economy grinds 
to a halt, the world community will come to its aid. Even 
Russia, in spite of its worsening economic crisis, continues to 
help its neighbours in trying to overcome their poverty. Indeed 
Russia's donor status vis-a-vis the member countries of the 
Commonwealth of Independent States is parallel to that of the 
Group of Seven leading industrialised countries vis-a-vis Russia. 
  In other words, while economic laws work the same in all 
countries, the possibility of a government responding to them 
depends on the historic particularities of that country's 
economy. 
  For 70 years, the former Soviet totalitarian economy 
accumulated vast structural disparities. Tackling these 
problems demands prolonged effort and huge expense. It is clear 
that we cannot sanction mass closures of our exhausted plants 
since that would usher in an unsupportable rise in unemployment 
and sharply worsen both the political and the social situation 
in the country. Besides, it would be simply unreasonable, since 
many enterprises have significant reserves with which to improve 
their financial position. All industrial enterprises should get 
the chance -- and that means time -- to overcome their present 
difficulties. 
  Today, we can define three groups of basic industries in 
Russia: 
  Enterprises that have successfully completed a period of 
adaptation to new market conditions and are already increasing 
turnover. 
  Enterprises which have yet to undergo such a period of 
adaptation, but which display the necessary potential to do so 
and have some hope of succeeding. It is these enterprises which 
should get help from the government. This group is by far the 
most numerous. 
  Enterprises which are beyond salvation and should be closed 
down in accordance with the law on bankruptcy. A list of such 
companies is already prepared. We do not, however, want to 
throw the baby out with the bathwater; and we cannot ignore the 
social consequences of each step on this road. 
  Imagine a provincial Russian town, built up around a big 
defence plant set up some years ago. The entire population of 
the town -- maybe 100,000 people -- works at the defence plant, 
including those engaged in the service sector. Assume that the 
plant has long since ceased to have any social use and no longer 
receives orders. Should we shut the enterprise without 
considering the consequences for its employees? 
  Consider another example: a northern mining town with a 
population of 50,000 which was established to work the coal 
reserves. The extraction of the coal is carried on with huge 
losses, the reserves are near to exhaustion, the equipment is 
obsolete and the cost of transporting the coal has gone up 
several times. There is no other settlement for 500km. There 
are hundreds of such cities and towns throughout Russia. 
  What should be done? We have no choice but to study 
carefully each case and patiently find a solution. 
  We do now feel there is some understanding in the west for 
these problems. The talks last month between the Russian 
government and representatives of the Group of Seven during the 
annual meeting of the European Bank of Reconstruction and 
Development in St Petersburg showed that our colleagues in the 
US, the UK and other countries recognise the importance of 
assistance in the social sphere. They intend to take an active 
part in the search for a way to separate out from the 
enterprises the social components traditionally provided by 
them, such as schools and kindergartens, so as not to threaten 
the basic living conditions of millions of people. The issue 
here is the possibility of channelling the international credit 
given to Russia towards the resolution of, above all, social 
problems. We can cope with the other issues ourselves. 
  We recently finished a round of talks in Moscow with the 
IMF; 
our approach met with understanding and support. Our relations 
with the IMF, to which we have furnished the most complete 
information both on the economic situation on what we intend to 
do to correct problems in that sphere, have become a symbol of 
our new openness in economic matters. We believe that the 
agreement with the IMF will lay a good foundation for our talks 
with the Paris and London clubs of sovereign and commercial 
creditors on the restructuring of Russia's foreign debt which we 
inherited from the Soviet Union. Successful co-operation with 
our creditors should also assist our efforts to achieve 
financial stabilisation. 
  The further integration of Russia into the world economy 
fully accords with our interests. We have left behind the 
former artificial exchange rate of the rouble, the state 
monopoly of internal trade and other former obstacles and 
limitations. We welcome foreign investment in the Russian 
economy and very much count on attracting further foreign 
investment -- even though we understand that much will depend on 
the success of our economic reforms and the improvement of the 
legal and tax regimes for foreign investors. 
  At the same time we will continue to insist on the 
establishment of equal trading relations, on the ending of the 
discrimination against Russian exports. In that regard, we are 
determined to push through Russia's application to join the 
General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs. In the near future 
Russia will take its proper place in the system of world trade 
and it will benefit both Russia and its trading partners. 
  I know that much of this appears over-optimistic. Indeed the 
country has still to emerge from its deep economic crisis. At 
the same time, we see the first signs that our efforts are 
bearing fruit. The privatisation of small businesses -- shops, 
restaurants, workshops -- is almost complete. As a result, the 
look of Russian cities is changing: in place of the dejected 
and sombre queues to which we were accustomed we see smart 
advertising hoardings and attractive, lively goods. We count on 
the privatisation of the larger companies to produce the same 
positive effect. 
  The first stage of privatisation, based on the use of 
vouchers issued free to every citizen, will soon be complete. 
From 1 July the remaining shares in state hands will be sold 
not for vouchers but for money. This new approach should 
replenish the state budget and also strengthen the financial 
position of the enterprises themselves. 
  The strengthening of political stability is also an 
enormously important condition for successfully addressing the 
economic crisis. Last year, a new constitution was endorsed by 
the people in a popular referendum, marking the end of the 
long-drawn out and weary confrontation between the executive and 
legislative powers. The other important step in the development 
of the democratic process was the holding of parliamentary 
elections, also in December. 
  There are differing views on the results of the December 
parliamentary elections. Yet the first 100 days of the federal 
assembly's work shows that the new parliament is a great 
improvement on the old Supreme Soviet. We count on close 
co-operation between the government and the parliament as a 
necessary condition for the creation of a legal base for the new 
economic environment. Political stability has been further 
strengthened by the achievement of a civil accord of national 
reconciliation, a process led by President Boris Yeltsin and now 
endorsed by a broad range of Russian political parties, 
enterprises and associations. 
  In today's Russia we are seeing a new beginning: a time for 
those who know how, and have the ability, to do business. We 
are now living through the trough of the economic crisis. In 
the next few months we can make a break from the basic negative 
tendencies which have held back our development in the past two 
or three years. 
  I am certain that we will make the break. Russia has only 
one path to tread -- that of reform, and it will not depart from 
it.

  [Text] Moscow, May 12, RIA -- Russia is determined to 
increase its arms exports in 1994 by 50 per cent and raise their 
value to 3.5 billion dollars. 
  This was revealed in an interview with RIA today by Viktor 
Glukhikh, head of the State Committee for Defence Industries. 
  The main budget receipts, according to him, are expected to 
come from spare parts for and service maintenance of sold combat 
equipment. 
  At the same time, Russia intends to export tanks, aircraft 
and small arms. 
  The main markets for Russian military equipment are Eastern 
Europe, China, India and Syria, said Glukhikh, assuming that up 
to 50 per cent of Russian arms exports will go to China and 
India. 
  At the same time, he noted that Russia will supply MIG-29 
warplanes to Hungary as repayment of the former USSR's external 
debt. 
  As for Syria, the matter mainly concerns, according to him, 
spare part supplies. 
  He also said that a contract is soon to be signed on the 
delivery of 18 MIG-29 planes to Malaysia. The negotiations have 
lasted almost two years. 
  In Glukhikh's opinion, recent media reports that Russian 
warplanes may be sold to Pakistan are too optimistic. He thinks 
this deal will be very difficult to conclude because of the 
opposition of Western competitors. The same kind of opposition 
exists in the United Arab Emirates. 
  Glukhikh noted that Russia also feels opposition in 
promoting 
military and technical cooperation with South Korea. But 
despite this, talks are under way on the joint development of 
anti-missile systems. 
  Notable progress has been achieved also in conversion, in 
the 
establishment of joint ventures in optics, electronics and 
engineering.

  [Text] Cheboksary, May 18, RIA -- Russia starts to 
dismantle production facilities capable of manufacturing 
chemical weapons, said Vice-Premier Oleg Soskovets after 
visiting the Khimprom amalgamation in Chuvashia formerly 
cranking out chemical munitions. 
  The factory stopped producing chemical weapons in 1987, but 
the production facilities stood in place and could be 
re-activated when needed. 
  Oleg Soskovets and Chuvashian President Nikolay Fedorov 
decided to compile a schedule, before September 1, 1994, of 
phasing out chemical-capable production facilities.

  [Text] Moscow, May 19, RIA -- Russian troops will start 
receiving a new submachine gun already this year, said Chairman 
of the State Committee for Defence Industries Viktor Glukhikh. 
  The new gun developed by designer Ivanov is called Abakan 
and 
is said to surpass the Ak-74 currently used in the Russian Army. 
Glukhikh noted that Abakan has already been field tested and 
turned out to be a high-precision weapon. Its calibre is 
traditional for the Russian Army (7.62) and magazine contains 30 
cartridges. 
  Glukhikh said it was too early to say when the Army would 
adopt new submachine guns and speak about their exports.

Affirms That Some Countries Hope To Link Signing of EU/Ukraine 
Agreement To NPT Membership"] 
  [Text] On the occasion of Sir Leon Brittan's visit, the 
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoly Zlenko reproached a number of 
EU Member States with wanting to postpone signing of the 
agreement between Ukraine and the EU until Kiev belongs to the 
Non Proliferation Treaty [NPT]. "For the moment we are unable 
to say exactly which countries are involved, but we reject such 
an approach. We cannot accept such a link because Ukraine has 
done everything to speed up joining NPT", he told a press 
conference. Sir Leon Brittan said he was satisfied Ukraine was 
proceeding with nuclear disarmament despite the Kiev 
parliament's failure to join NPT.

  [Text] Moscow, May 20, RIA -- "The situation in Simferopol 
was general calm last night and in the morning and Ukrainian 
forces remain inactive," the defence advisor to the Crimean 
president, Petr Chernyatevich, told RIA over the telephone. He 
assumed their reserve is explained by the telephone conversation 
between Leonid Kravchuk and Boris Yeltsin yesterday. 
  "However, the Crimeans are apprehensive about the 
declaration 
of the Ukrainian president that his country will take care of 
preserving territorial integrity," he said, explaining that some 
hotheads in "power" ministries could be taken too far by these 
words. He was also apprehensive about the presence of the 
Ukrainian swat squads and leaders of the Interior Ministry in 
the Crimea. 
  The Crimean parliament will convene for a regular session 
today and debate the Crimean Constitution, it was reported.

  [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau], May 17, RIA -- The Christian 
Democratic Popular Front of Moldavia [Moldova] views the current 
dialogue between the leaders of Moldavia and Transdniestria 
[Dniester] as a blow at national interests. 
  The Front's current statement notes that the negotiating 
process signifies the admission of equality of the 
Transdniestrian Moldavian Republic. 
  A RIA correspondent was told by sources close to the Front's 
leadership that it also has a negative vision of the CSCE 
mission's participation in the negotiating process because it 
becomes a supporter of Russia's imperial policy.

  [Text] Yerevan ("LRAGIR", "AZG", "RESPUBLICA ARMENIA" 
dailies), 05/10/94 -- Armenian "Lraber" TV program reported in 
the evening of May 6, the employees of the Armenian National 
Security Department (ANSD), together with their Russian 
colleagues and Russian Procurator's Office, arrested in Moscow 
"Sheremetevo-2" International Airport the former President's 
Counselor on National Security Vahan Avakhyan, who was returning 
from Sofia. Avakhyan was delivered to Yerevan on the same day 
and is charged with an attempt of exporting secret information 
from Armenia. This is, in fact, the first case when ANSD has 
caught a spy in Armenia. 
  Vahan Avakhyan has left Armenia at the beginning of this 
year. At the end of February his wife, Zaruhi Yavrumyan, was 
arrested in the "Zvartnots" Airport of Yerevan, attempting to 
take away computer diskettes, containing secret information. 
After capturing the diskettes, ANSD has been tracing every step 
of Vahan Avakhyan, who left for Bulgaria by that time. Yerevan 
was aware of his decision to visit Moscow and knew the precise 
time of his arrival to the Russian capital, where he was caught 
immediately after leaving the airplane. "SNARK" reports, Former 
Counselor of the President, former member of the "Karabakh" 
Committee Ashot Manucharyan will be a witness in the action 
against Avakhyan. Meanwhile the acting ANSD Chairman David 
Shakhnazaryan reported, Manucharyan refuses to evidence in this 
regard. 
  It is not clear yet, for Secret Services of what country V. 
Avakhyan worked. But evidently, as long as Russian secret 
services are actively participating in investigations, Lubyanka 
seems not being indifferent to this country too.

  [Text] Tbilisi (DPA) -- According to Georgian Foreign 
Minister Aleksandr Chikvaidze, the West should back the former 
Soviet republics against Russia. This is what he said in a talk 
with Hans-Jochen Vogel, former chairman of the Social Democratic 
Party of Germany [SPD], in Tbilisi on 6 May. "Our republics 
need support; then Russia will also take them into 
consideration," he said. The foreign minister suggested "a 
program of the West comparable to the Marshall Plan for setting 
up market economy infrastructures." He said that this was 
particularly necessary for the "explosive" Caucasus region. 
  Following his two-day visit to Tbilisi where he also met 
with 
chief of state Eduard Shevardnadze, Vogel planned to fly on to 
Moldova on 6 May.

  [Text] Vilnius, May 11 -- "Good will on both sides is 
necessary to sign an agreement. If one side has no such will 
there will be no agreement. So what is this comedy for?," 
Polish Ambassador to Lithuania Jan Widacki said at a press 
conference after Lithuania had suspended signing a TV agreement 
with Poland. 
  Director of the Broadcasting Centre of the Lithuanian TV 
Petras Uzpelkis said in the Lithuanian TV main news bulletin on 
Tuesday that the Polish side extorted its visit to Lithuania 
while the truth is it was invited by the Lithuanians and 
Uzpelkis participated himself in the preparations, Widacki said. 
  Uzpelkis tried to explain on TV why he had stopped an 
agreement while he said to a Polish delegation to Vilnius that 
it was not his decision. 
  There is no conflict between the Polish TV and the Baltic 
Television, that are to broadcast their programmes on the same 
channel, as it was announced in Lithuanian press. The board of 
the Lithuanian Television and the Ministry of Communications are 
partners for the Polish side and they can decide about TV 
broadcasting in Lithuania, the Polish ambassador added. 
  He concluded that such a treatment of the Polish delegation 
does not make Lithuania a reliable partner. Both sides lose 
when the agreement is not signed.

  [Text] Vilnius, May 12--The Union of Poles in Lithuania 
(ZPL), a socio-political organization, will not be allowed to 
take part in the local government elections to be held in 
Lithuania this autumn. The Lithuanian parliament took a binding 
decision on this question on Thursday. 
  The parliament on Thursday did not agree to vote again on an 
amendment to a bill under which only political parties 
registered under the law on parties will take part in the 
elections. The amendment had been first forwarded to the 
parliament by Social- Democrats. The ZPL Sejm faction tabled a 
motion to take a vote on the amendment again. 
  The ZPL members expressed their disapproval of the decision. 
The authors of the clause envisaging that only political 
parties should take part in the elections deny that it is 
allegedly aimed against Poles, but the Polish community received 
it like this. Bitterness is all the greater as the decision 
came soon after signing the Polish-Lithuanian treaty. 
  ZPL Deputy Artur Plokszto said the decision was absolutely 
incompatible with present tendencies in Europe to de-politicize 
local governments. He said the ZPL now would have to decide 
whether to register as a political party or whether to give up 
participation in ruling in regions inhabited by Poles. The 
decision is to be made by the ZPL main board on Friday.

  [Text] Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, 20 May -- Viktor Yerin, Russian 
Federation minister of interior, ended his visit to Sakhalin. 
At a news conference today on the results of the trip, the 
minister stressed he came to Sakhalin to acquaint himself with 
the work of the Interior Ministry bodies in the island oblast 
and to resolve the question of giving aid to the leadership of 
the oblast's directorate of internal affairs. The minister 
announced that in accordance with the results of a check that 
was carried out prior to his visit by an Interior Ministry 
commission, a number of responsible officials of the oblast 
directorate had been punished and measures were worked out to 
strengthen law and order on Sakhalin and in the Kurils. 
  In connection with the Putina-94 operation that is being 
carried out in the Russian Far East, Viktor Yerin described it 
as very expedient in the struggle against organized 
international crime. The minister believes concrete contacts 
between the island's Interior Ministry bodies and the police of 
Japan's most northerly island, Hokkaido, could be very 
beneficial.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "`Siemens' Technology Introduced in </F>
St. Petersburg"] 
  [Text] The Russian-German "Interturbo" enterprise has set 
up serial production of 150-megawatt gas turbines, assembled 
using Siemens technology. In electric power stations using, for 
example, the steam and gas energy production cycle, such 
turbines generate almost double the output produced by the 
industrial energy systems of thermal electric power stations. 
Interturbo, which was set up by Siemens and the St. Petersburg 
firm LMZ, was initially geared toward production of "high 
technology" goods enjoying a stable demand in power engineering 
worldwide. 
  In the first phase of the enterprise's work the St. 
Petersburgers are to assemble units from components delivered 
from Germany. At the same time the infrastructure for the 
production of components and machine parts in Russian plants is 
to be set up. Within a few years deliveries of these items will 
dominate the list of turbine components, so the 
production-sharing program envisages. The high quality of 
Interturbo's ouput is confirmed by the international certificate 
issued by experts of the German Technical Oversight Association.

  Looking for a way out from the current situation, the

whole thing is held up for want of funds. Anatoliy Shumilov,

interested ministries and departments which will perhaps make 
the optimal decision.

  [Text] The procuracy of the Pacific Fleet has established 
the reasons for the vast explosion at the fleet's aviation 
(bomb) store. According to the procuracy, one of the servicemen 
learnt that some of the things stored at the dump contained 
precious metals and decided, with his friends, to remove them. 
They found the munition they were seeking and began to dig into 
it with a bayonet. When the munition unexpectedly burst into 
flames the soldiers could think of nothing better to do than to 
run away. 
  As a result of the subsequent fire and explosion about 200 
wagon-loads of munitions went up into the air and great material 
damage was caused to the neighboring villages.

  [Text] The administration of the Maritime Territory (the 
Far East) is to review the location of arms depots, Vice 
Governor Valentin Dubinin told Interfax on Thursday. 
  This decision was taken after an explosion on the arms depot 
in Novonezhino, not far from Vladivostok, on May 14, which 
inflicted serious damage on the neighboring villages. 
  Dubinin also stated that the Novonezhino depot would be 
eliminated and that he opposed he idea of turning the Maritime 
Territory into an "arms graveyard" (a large part of the 
ammunition stored in Novonezhino was produced in the 1940s). 
  Commenting on the dismissal of Pacific Fleet Commander 
Georgiy Gurinov following the explosion, Dubinin said that this 
move would hardly influence discipline on the Pacific Fleet. 
"The government must pay servicemen on time and as much as they 
need. How can one talk about discipline when servicemen do not 
receive their salaries for months?" he said.

  [Text] In a recent issue of Interfax-Exclusive you met the 
Vice-Premier of Tatarstan Ravil Muratov who thinks that his 
republic has not fully used the possibilities offered to it by 
the treaty with Moscow on the separation of powers. This time 
FARID MUKHAMETSHIN, the chairman of the Tatar parliament, 
expresses his opinion. 
  IF: Do you think the leadership of Tatarstan has properly 
used the situation of the past two years for conducting economic 
reforms? 
  MUKHAMETSHIN: The cabinet managed to offer social security 
to the population which is important. However, not burdened by 
big payments to the federal budget last year and having 
advantageous conditions for oil experts the government should 
have used the situation more actively and launched economic 
reforms creating favorable conditions for small and medium-sized 
business. Unfortunately, the government was more concerned about 
the optimal distribution of the shrinking means it had than 
about finding new sources of increasing the budget. 
  During the latest session of parliament the Tatar budget 
came 
under justified criticism. An analysis of the revenue and 
spending indicates that the government approach to the economy 
is conservative. 
  IF: In the absence of its own economic program can Tatarstan 
collect the planned revenue by increasing the tax burden of 
unprofitable companies and impoverished population? 
  MUKHAMETSHIN: The parliament approved the budget on 
condition that the government works out an anti-crisis program 
within a month's time. If the government has collected merely 
400 million rubles in the first four months, one can hardly 
expect it to collect three trillion by the end of the year. 
Therefore the main task of the cabinet now is to define 
priority industries and companies that will be given tax 
benefits, to work out an effective policy of credits and agree 
with the federal government on a program of reducing mutual 
debts that now total two trillion. 
  IF: If this was not done in two years, why do you think the 
cabinet is going to find a way out of the crisis in one month? 
  MUKHAMETSHIN: I think a month is enough. The anti-crisis 
program will rely on the resources of Tatarstan as well as 
outside resources. Today many companies have their own programs 
and some have even partly carried them out. They should only be 
helped and by the end of the year they can stabilize their 
finances. 
  The bankruptcy law should be used and the anti-monopoly 
committee should be forced to work. Being a part of the 
economic space of the Russian Federation Tatarstan naturally 
attaches great significance to coordinating its economic policy 
with the federal government. This implies the opening of 
centralized credit lines for agriculture and related industries, 
investments in federal programs etc. 
  The agreement signed with the Russian government allows the 
Tatar National Bank to vary lending rates and this should also 
be used. But it must not be forgotten that Russia has the same 
problems as we do. We intend to take most active part in 
working out federal programs. The Tatar government might invite 
outside economists to work on our economic strategy. Talks are 
under way, but it is too early to name anyone personally. 
  IF: The parliament did not raise the question of a separate 
economic policy. Moreover, the prime-minister has declared that 
Tatarstan will follow the political line of Russia. 
  MUKHAMETSHIN: An absolutely independent economic policy is 
hardly possible today. However, one should not say that 
Tatarstan intends to drift along with Russian reforms. Local 
conditions will be taken into account and appropriate amendments 
made. 
  IF: Do you think there is a cabinet crisis in Tatarstan? 
Some political forces believe that the prime-minister must 
resign giving his place to a reformer. 
  MUKHAMETSHIN: I think it is too early to speak of the 
resignation of the cabinet. Everything is going to depend on 
the implementation of the anti-crisis program. 
  IF: Was the budget debate during the latest session natural 
or was it a manifestation of the conflict between the parliament 
and government? 
  MUKHAMETSHIN: The budget is always lobbied by certain 
groups: industrialists, farmers, bankers, that is why its 
adoption is always a compromise. During the debate I did not 
notice any wish of MPs to call of the replacement of some 
cabinet members or the cabinet as a whole even though its 
capacity to carry out radical reforms was questioned by some 
speakers. 
  IF: Some observers believe that during the past two years 
the Tatar leadership has been more concerned about political, 
domestic and foreign problems than an economic strategy. Do you 
agree with that? After all social security, support for 
agriculture are largely a survival program. Do they have a 
future or will they have to be curtailed? 
  MUKHAMETSHIN: It is true that much money was spent to keep 
up stability. The leadership felt that this is necessary 
otherwise the public would have turned its back on reforms. Now 
a new stage has begun and we must protect the rights we received 
from the federal government to prove the vitality of sovereign 
Tatarstan. After signing the treaty with Moscow on the 
separation of powers the entire responsibility for reforms lies 
on local leaders.

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Lukashov report in the "Regions" column: "Mintimer </F>
Shaymiyev Is Against the Idea of Creating a Volga Peoples 
Confederation"] 
  [Text] A a press conference in Kazan, Tatarstan President 
Mintimer Shaymiyev first commented on the idea of establishing a 
Confederation of Volga Peoples which has been repeatedly 
proposed by national movements in the Volga republics. 
According to the Tatarstan President, "this idea is unfeasible 
and nonviable because the majority of the republics and oblasts 
in the Volga area (excluding Tatarstan) have signed the 
Federation Treaty." "It is primarily up to the Russian 
leadership to think about such problems and also to make sure in 
particular that the treaties and agreements already signed 
should work. If these documents only remain on paper, such 
ideas are bound to persist," Mintimer Shaymiyev said. 
  True, such a position, according to Mr. Shaymiyev, does not 
refer to the sphere of "small-time diplomacy" -- the conclusion 
of horizontal accords with neighboring republics and oblasts. 
Here, on the other hand, in his opinion, "a very interesting 
development occurs." After the privatization of local 
enterprises, a substantial portion of shares is retained by the 
republics' governments. 
  According to Mintimer Shaymiyev, in the very near future "we 
should think what to do with these shares" and whether it is not 
a good idea to trade part of them, for instance, for shares of 
related enterprises in neighboring regions. This form of 
cooperation and integration, in the Tatarstan President's 
opinion, will be most effective.

  [Text] The first stage of Operation Putina has been 
completed. The aim of the operation was to protect Russian 
economic interests in its territorial waters. In other words, 
to combat illegal fishing. Border troops; officials from the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Customs, the Taxation Police, 
Primorrybvod [Maritime Kray Fishery Department], Sakhalinrybvod 
[Sakhalin Fishery Department]; and naval personnel took part in 
the operation. Captain First Rank Aleksey Velikanov, deputy 
chief of the Pacific Border District Maritime Department, tells 
us about the results of the first stage of Operation Putina. 
  [Begin Velikanov recording] The first stage of Operation 
Putina '94 ended on 10 May. The results are as follows: During 
the operation, more than 800 vessels, of which nearly 300 were 
foreign, were found in Russian territorial waters and exclusive 
economic zone. One hundred and fifteen [Russian] and 24 foreign 
vessels were inspected. Twenty [Russian] and four foreign 
vessels were cited for breach of fishing regulations. The 
offending [Russian] vessels were fined more than 200 million 
rubles. The Japanese fishing vessel was fined $15,385 and 
fishing permits of the three remaining foreign vessels were 
revoked. Losses estimated at approximately 20 billion rubles 
were averted through the resources of those who took part in the 
operation. Various resources, namely the Pacific Border 
District, the Pacific Fleet, Primorrybvod, Sakhalinrybvod, the 
Environment Protection Committee, Spetsmorinspektsiya [Special 
Maritime Inspection], as well as the Pacific Fleet and Border 
District aviation took part in the operation. 
  The next stage of the operation is planned for the latter 
part of June. However, this does not mean that in the interim 
the security of the exclusive economic zone and the state border 
will be relaxed. Already, the customs and border troops in 
Korsakov, Sakhalin Oblast, early this morning detained two 
vessels engaged in the illegal transfer of crabs. They are both 
currently under investigation. [end recording]

  [Text] Baku, 18 May (AZERTAC)--The item of the Bishkek 
Protocol was not included in the agenda of the today's session 
of the Azerbaijani Parliament. 
  A group of MP's, who consider the document conflicting with 
the interests of the republic, proposed to discuss this item. 
According to them, signing the Bishkek Protocol, the 
Parliament's speaker Rasul Guliyev has exceeded his commission. 
The MP's also consider the fact that the Azerbaijani 
Parliament's speakers signature is affixed near the signature of 
the representative of the Armenian community of Nagorno-Karabakh 
"a de facto recognition of the so- called Nagorno-Karabakh 
Republic." 
  Concerning this item, the Parliament's speaker said that 
there was "too much attention" devoted to the Bishkek Protocol 
and that, firing the passions against the document, some forces 
in Azerbaijan were trying to use it "as a means of political 
struggle". According to Rasul Guliyev, this document is just "a 
protocol of intentions which is without legal effect. It has 
only the recommendation character" and no consent of the 
Parliament was required for the signing of the document which is 
not a subject to ratification. 
  [Baku AZERTAC in English at 1632 GMT on 18 May, in a 
Baku-datelined item, adds the following: 
  ["Thirteen MP's attempt to place the item of the Bishkek 
Protocol signed by the Parliament speaker Rasul Guliyev on the 
agenda resulted in an unexpected break announced by the speaker 
today. (The Bishkek Protocol has been rejected in the Parliament 
earlier.) On failing to achieve their goal, they blamed Rasul 
Guliyev's deed in their statement and left the Parliament hall. 
They are convinced that the Parliament speaker exceeded his 
commission by signing the protocol."]

  [Text] Ibragim Nabi Ogly, our special correspondent in 
Ankara, has interviewed President Demirel. We now present the 
report he has dispatched to Baku: 
  [Begin recording] [Nabi Ogly] Have you studied the recent 
packages for the settlement of the Karabakh dispute? Can you 
comment on the matter? 
  [Demirel] We are confronted with conditions that change 
every 
day. The Armenians cannot achieve anything by fighting and 
occupying Azerbaijan's territory. Turkey cannot agree to the 
occupation of Azerbaijan's territory. The Armenians are 
neighbors of Turkey and Azerbaijan. They have been entrapped. 
In view of that, the most reasonable approach by Armenia would 
be to agree to abandon its attempts to occupy part of 
Azerbaijan's territory by force. 
  The Armenians have occupied a significant part of 
Azerbaijan's territory. No solution can be found to resolve the 
dispute if they do not withdraw. The Armenians may rely on 
whoever they wish, however, they are faced with significant 
problems. Fighting a war with Azerbaijan is depleting their 
resources. 
  It is a fact that 1 million people in Azerbaijan have become 
refugees. That is a pitiful and shameful situation. I cannot 
think of anything more tyrannical than forcing those people to 
abandon their homes and property. 
  Azerbaijan is the side that has suffered. An injustice has 
been done to that republic. Finding a peaceful solution to the 
dispute will, as I have already mentioned, depend on the 
Armenians' withdrawal from all the occupied territories, 
including Terterskiy, Kelbadzharskiy, Agdamskiy, Fizulinskiy, 
Lachinskiy, and Shushinskiy Rayons. Azerbaijan's territorial 
integrity is acknowledged by the entire world. Regarding the 
situation in Karabakh, the status there can be discussed later.

<F P=106> ["Text" of a Azerbaijan Ministry of Defense Press Service </F>
communique dated 18 May -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] The mass media have made conflicting reports over 
the past few days on the outcome of the talks held by the 
defense ministers of Russia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia in Moscow. 
The Azerbaijan Ministry of Defense Press Service deems it 
essential to outline the following: 
  An agreement on a cease-fire was reached at the talks. It 
was also agreed that there should be an opportunity for the 
negotiating parties to work on the final document in a peaceful 
atmosphere. The document was not signed because several of its 
paragraphs were not consistent with each other. An experts 
group is working on it. The defense ministers of Russia, 
Azerbaijan, and Armenia will hold a new round of talks when the 
experts conclude their work. 
  Meanwhile, the situation in the operations zone has been 
relatively peaceful during the past few days. However, our 
military positions in various parts of the front line have been 
fired upon. Sadarak in the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic was 
also fired on with PDM's [not further specified] and mortars 
last night. Azerbaijan's military forces ignored these 
provocative activities and refrained from returning fire.

final document on realization of Moscow protocol dated 18 
February 1994 -- which was signed last Tuesday by the heads of 
defense departments of Russia, Armenia, and Nagorno-Karabakh -- 
is capable to end bloodshed and open way to a long-term peace in 
Karabakh region," told in his interview to SNARK today the head 
of International Organizations Department in Karabakh Foreign 
Office, Massis Mailyan. 
  "Regretfully, he observed, Azerbaijan has not yet joined

  [Text] Baku, 19 May (SNARK)--Condemning the actions of the 
Azerbaijani leadership, the Political Center of political 
parties and organizations of Azerbaijan, established last Sunday 
[15 May], made a statement. 
  The statement said that being unable to defend the 
territorial integrity of the republic, the resist the 
aggression, to improve the conditions the people of Azerbaijan 
live in existing Azerbaijani authorities intensify the struggle 
against the opposition to conceal the discontent caused by the 
fact that Azerbaijan signed the "shameful" Bishkek Protocol. 
The capture of the headquarters of the People's Front, military 
encroachment upon the office of the National Independence Party 
and the editorial office of the "MILLIYET" newspaper, the 
attempt to capture the editorial office of the "AZADLYQ" 
newspaper, use violence against the participants of peaceful 
meeting in Ordubad, the dispersal of the women's demonstration 
in Baku, closing of the "BMT" private TV channel, introduction 
of the political censorship, persecution of some of the 
Parliament's deputies and some other facts witness the 
intensification of the struggle against the opposition. 
  The latest appearance of Milli Majlis speaker Rasul Guliyev, 
who had signed the Bishkek protocol, on TV is considered an 
attempt to convince people, by scaring them, that it is 
impossible to reject that document, as well as a try to spread 
capitulative trends. 
  The statement demands to stop the persecution, otherwise the 
authors of the statement would take to retaliate actions. It is 
also stressed that all responsibility for possible consequences 
would rest with the present Azerbaijani leadership. 
  The statement was signed by the following parties: "Ana 
Torpag" ("Motherland"), United Azerbaijan, Revival and Progress, 
"Dogru Yol" ("The Right Way"), "Dunyavi" ("Secular"), "Yurdash" 
("Compatriot"), National Independence, "Musavat," "Unanimity of 
Turkish World," People's Liberty, "Chagdash Turan" 
("Contemporary Turan"), People's Front, Independent Democratic 
Party, Democratic Party of Businessmen, as well as Azerbaijani 
National Department of the World Society on Human Rights' 
Observance.

Republic [NKR] has signed its first interstate treaty. As SNARK 
newsman reported from Simferopol, the comprehensive treaty 
between Nagorno-Karabakh and Crimean Republic was signed by the 
NKR Defense Committee Chairman Robert Kocharyan and by Crimean 
Republic President Yuri Meshkov. Parties observed that the 
signed document will serve a good basis for cooperation in 
political, economic, cultural, and other spheres. 
  The treaty has been signed during the visit of Karabakh 
delegation in Crimea who attended the meetings related with 50th 
anniversary of Crimean Tatar deportation.

May]. Masis Mailyan, adviser to the Nagorno-Karabakh Foreign

Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh, which was reached with the 
mediation of Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev. 
  Mailyan added that the cease-fire is a good prerequisite for 
Azerbaijan to join an understanding on the order of realising 
the Moscow protocol of last 18 February. 
  The adviser noted that the Karabakh military leadership 
returned to Stepanakert on Wednesday evening and expects 
Azerbaijan to join a protocol on ceasefire and disengagement of

Activity of International Organisations" -- TURAN headline] 
  [Text] Baku, 19 May (TURAN) -- "The U.S. back the principle 
of territorial integrity and sovereignty of the states," said 
the U.S. Ambassador to Azerbaijan, Richard Kauzlarich, at 
today's press conference in Baku. "The U.S. do not intend to 
stay aside from the settlement of the Karabakh conflict. The 
warring parties have to realize that the conflict must be 
settled as soon as possible. One will not be able to achieve 
any other purposes without that," said Kauzlarich. 
  The U.S. Ambassador said that "they say that we must point 
to 
the culprit of the conflict. We think that it will not help to 
settle the conflict." 
  Answering to the question concerning the international 
mediation in settlement the Karabakh conflict, Richard 
Kauzlarich noted that the U.S. accept the mediatory attempts of 
Russia only within the international organisation's framework, 
in particular CSCE. He said that all the members of CSCE should 
be involved to the process of observers' sending to the conflict 
area. 
  American ambassador noted that mediatory success can be 
provided only in case of the actions not only of some countries, 
but of international organisations. 
  In respect with the CSCE activity, Kauzlarich said that this 
organisation, during last two years practically had not chances 
to realise its peacemaking potential. "During this period both 
parties turned away from the attempts of CSCE," said the 
ambassador. 
  He also noted that in case of signing the oil contracts with 
American companies, Azerbaijan can hope on obtaining the status 
of most favour in trade with U.S.A.

  [Text] Baku, 19 May (TURAN) -- Twenty-seven members of the 
Milli Mejlis support Bishkek Protocol and they addressed an 
appeal to the Azeri nation. 
  The appeal reads that "a six-year-old war of Armenia against 
Azeri nation worsened socio-economic and military-political 
situation and presently it also threatens to the state system." 
  "We have to seek for peaceful ways to put an end to this 
devastating war." 
  The deputies stood against "a wide campaign several 
political 
parties and media waged today." 
  "We condemn the activities of those parties, which are aimed 
against the achievement of national unity and civil consent and 
which are not in the interests of Azerbaijan." 
  The deputies consider Bishkek Protocol as a move aimed at 
end 
of the war and the achievement of peace in Azerbaijan. 
  The document mentions that the signing of Bishkek Protocol 
does not mean that the UNO [United Nations Organization] and the 
CSCE will not take part in the peacemaking mission in the region 
since Russia cannot take part in the process of peace 
restoration alone. 
  The deputies hope that "the Azeri Government will protect 
normal mediatorial efforts further more." 
  The members of the Milli Mejlis accused the opposition of 
using Bishkek Protocol for political purposes, that is to cause 
instability in the republic and come to power. 
  The appeal was when 17 members of the Milli Mejlis left the 
Parliament building in token protest of the intention of the 
authorities to accept the Russian settlement plan. The deputies 
consider that this plan infringe on Azerbaijan's interests and 
they will fight against its putting into execution.

  [Text] Moscow 20 May TASS -- Azerbaijan's Defence Minister 
Mamadrafi Mammadov, who arrived in Moscow on Thursday, has not 
yet signed the protocol on ceasefire and disengagement of the 
warring troops, which was prepared for signing on 17 May. 
  Azerbaijan's Ambassador to Russia Ramiz Rizayev told 
ITAR-TASS that the Moscow meetings between the Azeri minister 
and Russia's Deputy Defence Minister Georgiy Kondratyev have 
failed to identify "common approaches, and Mamadrafi Mammadov 
intends to meet Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev today. 
  Azerbaijan insists on the withdrawal of the Armenian troops 
from the territories captured simultaneously with the ceasefire 
and disengagement of troops. It calls for recording this 
provision in the protocol. "We would like to combine the first 
and the second phases of the settlement of the conflict," 
Azerbaijan's ambassador told ITAR-TASS. 
  According to Ramiz Rizayev, Azerbaijan's proposals have met 
with support in principle of the Russian minister of foreign 
affairs, Andrey Kozyrev. 
  Experts of the Russian Defence Ministry do not think that 
Pavel Grachev will agree to the amendments to the protocol 
proposed by Azerbaijan. The protocol as is has already been 
signed by representatives of Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh and 
Russia.

  [Text] The Georgian Army has not as yet been ordered to 
withdraw its troops from the line of conflict with the Abkhazian 
formations along the Inguri River in order to create a security 
zone. This was announced to INTERFAX by Georgian Defense 
Minister Lieutenant-General Varden Nadibaidze today. 
  The Georgian-Abkhazian agreement signed in Moscow on 14 May 
says that international observers and a CIS peace-keeping 
contingent mostly composed from the Russian forces will come to 
this security zone after the conflicting parties withdraw their 
troops 12 km away from the Inguri River. There will be 2,500 or 
3,000 servicemen in the CIS peace-keeping forces. 
  Nadibaidze stated that the Georgian Army would carry out all 
orders received from the commander-in-chief and Georgian leader 
Eduard Shevardnadze. 
  However, Chief of the Russian Transcaucasian Troops Group 
press center, Colonel Gennadiy Dolgachev, said in an interview 
with INTERFAX that the peace-keeping contingent was likely to be 
formed from the Russian Transcaucasian troops.

  [Text] At the session of parliament in Georgia on Thursday 
[19 May]. Opposition parties again demanded to disavow the 
agreement on cease-fire and the disengagement of troops, which 
was signed in Moscow on 14 May following the results of the 
Georgian-Abkhazian talks. The document envisages the withdrawal 
of the Georgian and Abkhazian units from the line of 
confrontation passing along the Inguri River, the deployment in 
the "buffer zone" of peacekeepers. The opposition believes that 
the materialization of the document will lead to the loss of 
Abkhazia. 
  Deputy Irakly Tsereteli demanded that question be raised on 
confidence to the head of state Eduard Shevardnadze. If this is 
not done before 26 May, Day of Independence, he said, people 
will do this, instead of parliament. 
  The argument caused by the signing by Georgia of an 
agreement 
on the settlement, nearly broke the session of parliament on 
Tuesday. 
  Commenting in an interview with INTERFAX on the demands to 
hold early parliamentary elections, leader of the Republican 
Party, Ivlian Khandrava said that he did not see any legitimate 
mechanism for holding them. 
  The only way, he said, is the consent of two-thirds of the 
current parliament which is impossible to obtain. All the rest 
steps, including referendums and decisions by the head of state 
would not be legitimate, he said.

  [Text] Moscow May 19 TASS -- President Boris Yeltsin plans 
no major reshuffling of the government although he assesses some 
spheres of its activities as unsatisfactory, according to 
presidential spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov. 
  "The president does not intend to follow the practice which 
is usual for such situations in the West and will not put the 
blame on the partner by reshuffling or changing the cabinet", 
the spokesman told reporters on Thursday. 
  "Nothing radical is in store", he stressed and said that 
rumours about a possible dismissal of Privatisation Minister 
Anatoliy Chubays are "inventions and bluff". 
  But Kostikov admitted that the president had expressed 
"serious remarks" to Viktor Chernomyrdin during their 6-hour 
long meeting on Tuesday because of poor implementation of 
presidential decrees and economic decisions. 
  However, "the president and the prime minister act in a 
coordinated way and there is no talk about a crisis of trust 
between them", according to Kostikov. 
  "There are serious remarks, tough criticism on the part of 
the president. The actions of the government are assessed by 
the president as unsatisfactory in a number of aspects, but 
there is no misunderstanding", he stressed. 
  After the signing of the Civic Accord Treaty the president 
and the government "acquired a sufficient degree of political 
confidence which allows them not to hide disagreements which 
exist between them. In conditions of a greater stability there 
is a possibility to raise questions in a sharper way without 
fearing they would affect the political situation", Kostikov 
said.

<F P=106> ["Russian Press Keen on Latest Changes in Government" -- </F>
ITAR- TASS headline] 
  [Text] Moscow May 20 ITAR-TASS -- "The premier strengthens 
positions," IZVESTIYA daily concludes its analysis of the latest 
changes in the government. 
  Many national newspapers have been closely watching these 
changes for days. "Observers have no doubt that Chernomyrdin's 
position is now so firm that the president cannot afford any new 
appointments to the government without his consent," IZVESTIYA 
elaborates. As an example, the newspaper mentions the 
appointment of the Democratic Party leader, Nikolay Travkin, to 
the cabinet in order to strengthen contacts with the State Duma. 
  "Shakhray's release from the post of the nationalities 
minister should hardly be construed to mean the weakening of the 
premier's positions. Inter-ethnic problems have traditionally 
been a prerogative of the president's staff, while the prime 
minister has been on the sidelines. Moreover, Shakhray's 
achievements were not over impressive for a struggle to ensue 
between the president and the premier around this figure," the 
newspaper muses. 
  The newspaper calls "symptomatic" changes at the level of 
second persons in the ministries. On Chernomyrdin's initiative, 
the decisions on dismissing the deputy ministers of economics 
and finance, drafted by the government staff, have been shelved. 
On the contrary, economist Yakov Urinson, a former Gosplan 
(State Planning Committee) staffer known in the 
liberal-democratic circles as one of the first and few old-style 
staffers to actively support market reform ideas, has been given 
a status equal to that of minister by Chernomyrdin's decision. 
Sergey Aleksashenko, who has fortunately been rescued from the 
sacking, is "a young financier known as a first-class specialist 
with liberal views on the economy". 
  The newspaper cites analysts who believe that the 
equilibrium 
in the government can be seriously tipped if Soskovets, 
Zaveryukha and co. prove to be stronger. "In this situation, 
the premier has to support the camp of pro-market liberals in 
his cabinet in order to safeguard the economy and his own 
political future". 
  "The role of the prime minister has enhanced sharply in 
recent month," according to VEK, a newspaper of the business 
community. 
  "The fragile centrist balance, which took shape after Viktor 
Chernomyrdin came to head the cabinet of ministers is being 
artificially broken down. It is possible that we will soon see 
another series of incomprehensible resignations and 
appointments, leading to the emergence of an absolutely new 
ruling elite structure," the newspaper warns. 
  VEK surmises that "a question has been raised about creating 
a coalition government with the participation of the main 
opposition forces, which agreed to sign the national 
conciliation pact". It points to the appointment of Travkin as 
cabinet member and the premier's meeting with Zhirinovskiy, 
reportedly to discuss the possible bringing of an LDPR man into 
the government. 
  The press, particularly the CIS publishing organ "THE 
BUSINESS WORLD", highlight the presidential press secretary's 
assertion that there is no crisis of confidence in relations 
between the president and the prime minister. "Political 
concord is in evidence. But in the course of their recent 
meeting, the president voiced a number of tough remarks about 
the cabinet relating to the shortfalls in conducting economic 
reform."

  [Text] Moscow May 19 TASS -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin does not believe that the "irreconcilable opposition" 
who hold rallies in Moscow streets is a real force. The true 
opposition is being formed in the Russian State Duma, 
presidential spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov told reporters on 
Thursday. 
  "The irreconcilable opposition is very small and is of 
marginal character. These forces are a byproduct of political 
life, have no social support and resort to harsh language 
because of that", Kostikov said, but added that this does not 
mean that Yeltsin sees no danger of political extremism. 
  Yeltsin believes that "the true opposition is currently 
being 
formed in the State Duma which is a normal phenomenon", 
according to Kostikov. The president is ready to hold 
discussions with it, but if the Duma encroaches on his powers 
the "attempts will be cut short", the spokesman warned. 
  Yeltsin believes that relations with Duma have a favourable 
character in general, but regrets that the lower chamber has 
spent much time discussing its privileges rather than lawbills. 
There are "elements inherited from the tactics of the former 
Supreme Soviet which consisted in unlimited expansion of 
functions of deputies and of the legislative body", Kostikov 
said and added that at present "the State Duma is cautiously 
intervening into the powers of the executive authority". The 
president has so far quietly reacted to that and sent a letter 
to the Duma with his remarks. 
  Yeltsin believes that the situation has become more stable 
in 
the country after the signing of the civic accord treaty. 
"Political forces which stand for accord are undoubtedly 
dominating the forces of confrontation and political revenge", 
Kostikov said.

<F P=106> [Report by Vasiliy Kononenko: "B. Yeltsin Prepared To Meet </F>
With D. Dudayev and Include New `Party People' in Government"] 
  [Text] A routine briefing by V. Kostikov, the Russian 
Federation president's press secretary, 19 May in the Kremlin 
confirmed Moscow's intention to begin serious contacts with 
Groznyy officials. 
  In view of the acute economic and political crisis there are 
indications from Chechnya of the desirability of unofficial 
talks with the Russian leadership. The indications are coming 
both from the Chechen opposition and from Dzh. Dudayev. There 
has been no reaction from Russian power structures so far. But 
B. Yeltsin no longer sees any insuperable obstacles to talks 
with Groznyy, and the appointment of N. Yegorov to the post of 
new leader of the Ministry for Nationalities Affairs is meant to 
step up work in this sphere. We do not yet know whether S. 
Shakhray will participate in the talks with the Chechnya 
representatives. The press secretary announced that the 
president has not accepted his resignation. 
  V. Kostikov once again explained the president's position on 
the actions of the intransigent opposition in the shape of A. 
Rutskoy and his associates. B. Yeltsin is keeping a close eye 
on the way the "intransigents" are beginning to raise their 
heads, remembering the unfortunate experience of collaboration 
with the former Supreme Soviet. He is aware how far they might 
go. The events of 9 May showed that the opposition does not 
always engage in civilized ways of achieving its ends. So the 
president intends to take a tough line on any actions outside 
the Constitution. At the same time, as the press secretary 
noted, B. Yeltsin is not against all activity by the opposition, 
as shown by his words: "We do not want to create some kind of 
police state. But as far as uncivilized methods of political 
struggle, crime, and corruption are concerned, in such cases the 
authorities will take a tough line." 
  At the end of the briefing, when I asked whether the 
president was afraid of Khasbulatov's returning to big-time 
politics (some analysts are forecasting his "resurrection," 
saying that he will grab power in Groznyy), the press secretary 
indicated that the president did not see this as a serious 
danger. Nonetheless, it is probable that certain changes in 
Moscow's stance on Groznyy are linked to this factor. 
  I was able to talk recently on this topic with other members 
of the president's immediate entourage. Summing up what they 
said, I can construct the following scenario. Dzh. Dudayev has 
undergone his own political evolution. The Kremlin, aware of 
the need to strengthen the Federation, is now inclined to 
acknowledge Dudayev as the legitimate president of Chechnya and 
hold talks with him. There may be talks in the very near future, 
leading to a meeting between B. Yeltsin and Dzh. Dudayev. 
  At the briefing the press secretary made another curious 
admission, citing the president's opinion (he had talked with B. 
Yeltsin the day before). According to him, the president 
intends to employ the practice of expanding party representation 
in the cabinet of ministers. This pronouncement should be seen 
as a signal, if you consider what the other representatives of 
the power structures said on the topic in conversation with me. 
Although the idea of including N. Travkin in the cabinet of 
ministers came from V. Chernomyrdin, the president described it 
as fitting in perfectly with the process of achieving accord and 
he is prepared to discuss the inclusion of representatives of 
other parties in the government. As my interlocutors stressed, 
this does not mean that the process will snowball and posts will 
be artificially made available for "party people." 
  V. Kostikov denied rumors that S. Filatov and A. Chubays are 
about to resign.

<F P=106> [Nika Stark report under the "A Meeting with Industrialists" </F>
rubric: "President Checks His Course"] 
  [Text] After a lengthy and difficult conversation with 
Viktor Chernomyrdin about the state of the Russian economy on 
Monday, Boris Yeltsin decided to hold a meeting with industry 
chiefs to sound them out on a number of draft economic edicts 
which have been prepared for signing. The meeting took place 
yesterday -- it started in the Kremlin and finished up in a 
presidential city residence. The fact that the president 
decided to personally check out the views of the industrial 
bosses shows that Yeltsin's displeasure with the progress of 
reform has really reached a critical point. 
  More than a dozen industrialists were invited to attend the 
meeting. According to information received by KOMMERSANT-DAILY 
from the presidential press service, they included Vladimir 
Kadannikov, general director of the AvtoVAZ car plant; Aleksandr 
Dondukov, general director of the Yakovlev Design Bureau; and 
Aleksey Sharkov, general director of the Uraltransmash plant. 
Although initially it was expected that the Russian government 
would be represented at the level of deputy prime ministers, the 
premier himself arrived in the Kremlin. 
  The meeting focussed on three main subjects: centralized 
credits, mutual nonpayments, and bankruptcies. Boris Yeltsin 
started the conversation by stating that the political situation 
in Russia is getting more stable and that normal conditions for 
investment have already been created. These words, however, did 
not elicit great enthusiasm in the audience. 
  The Russian industry leaders who have managed to live 
through 
reform were asked to familiarize themselves with eight draft 
edicts on "improving economic health" that the president is 
going to sign in the near future. The edicts deal with what 
Boris Yeltsin sees as the three most important problems of the 
Russian economy. In addition, KOMMERSANT-DAILY learned, they 
also cover matters concerning relations between the president 
and the government. Initially, the president planned to sign one 
blanket edict as early as 19 May, but after the meeting with 
Viktor Chernomyrdin he decided to split it into a number of more 
specific documents. 
  Presidential press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov told 
journalists even before the meeting began that Boris Yeltsin 
opposes centralized credits: "Given on a large scale, they lead 
to inflation." According to Kostikov, Yeltsin also believes that 
bankruptcies cannot be avoided altogether because supporting the 
enterprises that are "obviously unviable would be to burdensome 
for the state." 
  How the edicts "ran by" the industrialists is not known yet. 
It is clear, however, that the president's turning to them for 
advice in itself, which does not look like a simple political 
gesture (otherwise a statement on its results would certainly 
have been adopted), proves that Yeltsin is seriously 
dissatisfied with the government's performance, although 
excluding Viktor Chernomyrdin personally, Kostikov said. 
<H5>  Commentary by the Economic Policy Department </H5>
  The last official meeting Boris Yeltsin held with Russian 
industrialists took place in the fall of 1991. At the time, on 
the eve of price liberalization and a drastic change in economic 
policy, the president's guests included members of the 
Industrial Union deputy faction, which was made for the most 
part of state enterprise directors. KOMMERSANT-DAILY 
correspondents who attended the largely symbolical meeting noted 
how confidently the president felt among economic managers, who 
demonstrated to him their political conformism, apparently the 
last trump card of the old economic elite that retained some 
vestiges of political clout thanks to the existence of the 
Congress of People's Deputies. 
  At the end of 1991, the president and Yegor Gaydar, a rising 
political star, needed to insure themselves against resistance 
from directors when discussing what was then the main question 
of economic policy: granting the president extra powers to 
carry out economic reform. Without them, the Gaydar team's 
plans could not be put into practice. Having won the confidence 
of provincial economic managers, Yeltsin subsequently also 
received the requisite powers at the Fifth Congress. 
  What is it that the president and his new star, Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, are trying to insure themselves against this time 
around? Evidently, the key question for them is post-voucher 
privatization and the related tide of bankruptcies that will 
engulf the largest manufacturing enterprises in the first place. 
Without drastic layoffs they do not stand any chance of 
surviving. In this situation, the president would like to make 
the directors his allies, not an enemy who, as ZIL director 
Yevgeniy Brakov once remarked, are ready "to bring people onto 
the streets under any banner." Both the Kremlin and the White 
House fear that this could happen once the edicts on resolving 
the nonpayment crisis, described by spokesmen for the 
authorities as "a tough, imperative document," go into force. 
After all, all talk by the country's leaders with the economic 
elite about "boosting investment activity," taxation policy, and 
customs regimes boils down to one simple business principle: 
"Scratch my back and I'll scratch yours."

  [Text] Moscow May 20 TASS -- Liquid radioactive waste 
products of the "Zvezda" works in Primorye maritime region will 
be dropped into the Pacific Ocean, unless urgent measures are 
taken to collect, preserve and process them, the press centre of 
the Russian Ministry for Emergencies announced on Thursday. 
  In expert opinion, the situation at the works is 
controllable 
so far, but in three months all the available tanks for 
collecting the waste products will have been filled to capacity. 
  The Russian Government instructed the ministries and 
departments concerned to suggest possible wayouts. The Ministry 
for Emergencies, the Ministry for Nuclear Industry, the Ministry 
of Public Health and naval forces proposed several ways to solve 
the problem, but they cannot be realised for lack of funding.

  [Text] Moscow, 19 May (ITAR-TASS) -- Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin today sent greetings to the organizers of the 
All-Russia Days of Protection Against Ecological Danger. The 
text of the message has been issued by the president's press 
service: 
  "To the organizers of, and participants in, the All-Russia 
Days of Protection against Ecological Danger; 
  The All-Russia Days of Protection Against Ecological Danger 
are taking place in our country for the first time, from 15 
April to 5 June 1994. I wholeheartedly welcome the initiative 
to stage them. 
  I regard the action as timely and necessary. 
  Protection of the natural environment is one of the Russian 
state's priority tasks. To ensure ecological safety, the 
government is drawing up a long-term state strategy that 
envisages widespread use of the vast potential of Russia's 
military-industrial complex. I think it will also be useful to 
have special ecological subunits within the Russian Army that 
will be able not only to eliminate the serious ecological 
consequences of their activities, but also to clean up 
industrially polluted areas, especially in ecological disaster 
zones. 
  It is our common duty to combine our efforts and do 
everything possible to see that our towns and villages are 
green, and that the air, land, and water at our places of work, 
in our enterprises, around our own homes and throughout our 
motherland are pure. Russia needs a program of ecological 
regeneration. Such a program can only be drawn up by the whole 
of society--the government, parliament, entrepreneurs, parties, 
scientists, and public ecological organizations. I support the 
idea of convening an all-Russia congress on ecology and 
environmental protection to adopt such a program. 
  Having inherited our native natural conditions from our 
ancestors, we, the people of Russia, are obliged to bequeath 
them to our children and grandchildren in all their original 
beauty. I sincerely hope that the All-Russia Days of Protection 
Against Ecological Danger will help us all to recognize the 
importance and responsibility of this task. 
  I wish you success, dear friends, in the noble cause of 
preserving Russia's natural environment. 
  [signed] B. Yeltsin."

  [Text] Moscow May 20 TASS -- Russian nationalist leader 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and his Liberal Democratic Party faction 
stormed out of the State Duma on Friday in protest against a TV 
report claiming that he had paid his faction members 500 US 
dollars each for voting in favour of the draft budget. 
  Zhirinovskiy told lawmakers that his party "can no longer 
tolerate lies and slander in the press". He added that in 
retaliation he had designed "a complex of measures", but did not 
elaborate. 
  The scandal erupted after Nikolay Svanidze, an anchorman of 
the "Podrobnosti" (details) news programme of the Russian TV 
announced that Zhirinovskiy is paying his party members. 
  Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin told lawmakers that his deputy 
Mikhail Mityukov had sent a message to Oleg Poptsov, head of the 
Russian TV, demanding to sack Svanidze. 
  However, the anchorman told TASS on Friday that he is ready 
to submit proofs of his statements in court. 
  Svanidze denounced Zhirinovskiy's demands to sack him until 
a 
court ruling is passed. "I could have with the same success 
demanded to keep the LDPR leader from work in Duma", he said and 
added that he is ready to invite Zhirinovskiy to clarify the 
scandal in the "Podrobnosti" programme.

  [Text] The Russian government has, in a bid to improve 
cooperation with western nations in arms sales, passed a 
resolution granting manufacturers of arms and military hardware 
the right to seek foreign partners independently and sign 
contracts with them for the export of their surplus products 
after meeting the government order. 
  Moscow has thereby virtually eliminated the Rosvooruzheniye 
concern's monopoly of the arms trade. The concern was set up at 
the end of last year and, according to Russian Vice-Premier and 
Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin, should have become a 
"holding of other organizations currently involved in arms 
trading." However, leading arms designers and manufacturers 
objected to the formation of the concern, seeing in it a threat 
to the new arms export mechanism created after the break up of 
the USSR. 
  Under the new government resolution, arms exporters must 
prove their suitability to engage in foreign trade and be 
registered accordingly. They negotiate and pass tactical and 
technical specifications for certain types of arms and military 
hardware to partners from countries with which arms trade is not 
prohibited. Arms manufacturers also have the right to select 
agents from a list of organizations which have permission to 
engage in foreign trade in arms. 
  Russian arms exports have fallen in recent years from 
approximately 10 million dollars to approximately 2.2 million 
dollars.

  [Text] The Russian president's chief of staff, Sergey 
Filatov, said that, with Nikolay Yegorov's appointment as 
minister of the affairs of nationalities and regional policy, 
Russia would resolve its disputes with its separatist republic 
of Chechnya much sooner. 
  "We are concerned about the crime problem and the position 
of 
the poor in that republic," Filatov told Interfax correspondent 
Vyacheslav Terekhov on Thursday. "It's not the status of 
Chechnya or any legal matters that we are concerned about but 
the maintenance of peace around Chechnya," which is being 
threatened today by tension between Chechnya and another Russian 
republic, Dagestan, he said. 
  "We would like to preclude further impoverishment and even 
lower living standards in Chechnya. Those matters are giving 
President Boris Yeltsin a lot of concern," Filatov said. 
  Yegorov replaces Sergey Shakhray, recently dismissed by 
Yeltsin as minister of the affairs of nationalities and reginal 
policy.

<F P=106> [Interview with Emil Pain, member of the Presidential </F>
Council, by Teymuraz Mamaladze; place and date of interview not 
stated: "Glitter and Poverty of Conflictology"] 
  [Text] The cobblestone -- the classic weapon of the 
proletariat -- has been rejected by the activists of the 
independent trade union of Russian miners. Were any latter-day 
Ivan Shadr to think of portraying a hegemon's class impulse he 
could sculpt him raising a weighty volume on conflictology -- 
the science of settling disputes by peaceful means. Meeting for 
their spring seminar in Saltykovka near Moscow, the miners 
strenuously studied the basics of this science. 
  The miners' extraordinary initiative required the commentary 
of a knowledgeable person. I found him in the shape of Emil 
Pain, member of the Presidential Council, who in this capacity 
leads the nationalities policy working group and the problems 
section of the president's analytical center. 
  [Mamaladze] What do you think of it, I asked Russia's chief 
conflictologist. 
  [Pain] It is very symptomatic that the miners turned to 
conflictology. It is as symptomatic as the signing of the 
social accord treaty. It looks as though the idea of accord is 
being confirmed in society as a significant value. 
  You remember how back in the fall of last year words about 
war were widely current and various political groups called 
themselves fronts. Today the majority of these forces are 
arguing about who is more geared toward accord and who is its 
main expresser. 
  [Mamaladze] And how do you explain this change? 
  [Pain] Partly by what is called "metal fatigue." The 
Russians are tired not only of their own quarrels but also of 
conflicts in nearby foreign parts. After all, the umbilical 
cord of the common state has not yet been cut and everyone is 
feeling their pernicious consequences. 
  To some extent the conflicts beyond Russia are saving it 
from 
its own conflicts. The experience of bloodshed is sobering. 
During the nine months of the Tajik conflict over 50,000 people 
have been killed and nearly four GNP's have been lost. Some 
20,000 killed and a destroyed economy -- that is the result of 
the Armenian-Azerbaijani war. There is much the same "harvest" 
in Georgia. 
  [Mamaladze] That is entirely correct as regards the 
umbilical cord. Sergey Yulyevich Vitte -- and he was from 
Tbilisi and knew about the matter at first hand -- said: "Until 
the troubles end in Russia it is impossible to end the troubles 
in the caucasus." If talk has turned to "salvation" then we 
must speak of a viewpoint quite widespread in the post-Soviet 
states: These conflicts are advantageous to Russia as a 
political lightening conductor on the one hand and on the other 
as a means of restoring control over key geopolitical zones. 
  [Pain] Political interest is a leading element of all the 
major conflicts we know which have developed into interethnic or 
regional wars -- Karabakh, the Dniester Region, South Ossetia, 
Abkhazia, Tajikistan. That means, first, the interest of 
seizing power when the political opposition uses outbursts of 
hostility to crush a rival. Second, this involves holding on to 
power -- those who have it use the energy of a conflict to 
switch dissatisfaction to particular ethnic or political groups. 
Finally there is the interest of expanding power, when an 
outside force turns interethnic or intergroup clashes into a 
tool for expanding its spheres of influence. 
  In any conflict these interests are present and interwoven.. 
  It is another question whose interests were expressed by, 
for 
instance, the Confederation of Peoples of the caucasus operating 
in Abkhazia or by the cossacks in the Dniester region or 
Abkhazia.... 
  [Mamaladze] ...Or in Moscow in the fall of last year with an 
association of politicians, retired military men, and gunmen 
from the Dniester Region and Abkhazia for whom the conflicts 
blazing far from Moscow were fields for their own battles and a 
nutrient medium. 
  [Pain] Yes, here too political forces came onto the state 
and also used outside conflicts in the interests of the struggle 
for power like, for instance, the internal conflicts in Georgia 
involving the parties of war and the Zviadist opposition. I 
once made a special analysis of the timetable for the 
opposition's acts of provocation and Shevardnadze's initiatives 
to reach peace in Abkhazia -- each peacemaking step was followed 
by a response which thwarted it. 
  [Mamaladze] Yet the same happened with Yeltsin's 
initiatives. By analyzing the relevant timetables we would have 
obtained approximately the same picture. Incidentally, it would 
have reflected quite clearly the surprising synchronization of 
the actions of some politicians here in Moscow, the authorities 
in Gudaut, the Conference of Peoples of the Caucasus in the 
North Caucasus, and the Zviadists in Georgia. 
  I do not think they needed the services of conflictology. 
  [Pain] In actual fact conflictology would be suitable for 
everyone as long as expectations are not made excessively high, 
of course: The myth of the omnipotence of science is an 
offshoot of the myth of the omnipotence of the state. In the 
West conflictology is achieving quite considerable successes 
when the sides want to reach agreement, realizing how much they 
are losing from the unabating conflict situation. 
  In ethnopolitical conflicts as a rule the groups which do 
not 
want conciliation gain the upper hand. Then apart from 
political interests there are operating alongside them, in 
parallel or interwoven, the pragmatic criminal interests of 
mafia groups which extract colossal profits from the trade in 
weapons, drugs, and hostages, from the appropriation of 
property, and the establishment of control over sources of 
material benefits. 
  [Mamaladze] According to some figures this business based on 
blood brings its participants a profit of tens of millions of 
U.S. dollars. And all this is shielded by the banner of the 
national idea. In this connection it would be of some use to 
touch on the role of various ideas in the kindling of conflicts. 
For instance, history interpreted in a self-seeking way is most 
often used to justify claims to territory and status. 
Historians pave the way for detachments of gunmen. Their 
disputes over "who came to this land first" are transferred to 
the battle fields, turning into bloody disputes between the 
peoples. 
  [Pain] Where there is no developed legal consciousness, no 
developed legal and political culture, and they do not yet exist 
and cannot exist in post-totalitarian societies, they are 
replaced by so-called historical or mythological truth. 
Conflicts contain no more powerful detonator than myth.... 
  [Mamaladze] In other words we are dealing with the 
exploitation of a myth for political purposes? 
  [Pain] Undoubtedly. In general I must say that a kind of 
"philosophy of prejudice" as the basis for making political 
decisions is taking shape before our eyes. 
  For instance, after the 12 December elections many 
politicians in Russia concluded that nationalism was growing and 
that it was necessary to use it to consolidate society. That 
idea is utterly illusory and at the same time extremely 
dangerous. The plans to adapt nationalist slogans to the aims 
of consolidating society have not been successfully implemented 
in Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan, or Lithuania. Still less will 
this be successfully done in Russia now, in an atmosphere of 
people's mounting revulsion toward politics. 
  To judge by the polls of the All-Russia Center for the Study 
of Public Opinion on Social and Economic Questions 
Zhirinovskiy's party is losing its supporters more rapidly than 
all other political parties. The same studies show that today 
no more than 1-2 percent of Russians support the so-called 
national patriotic movement -- that is far lower than support 
for national movements in any other state of the former Union 
except perhaps for Belorussia [Belarus]. The leaders of the 
cossack movement, whose influence has also been greatly 
exaggerated, also failed to gain support not only at the 
parliamentary elections but also at the local ones. 
  At the same time just talking about the need to grant 
special political rights to the ethnic majority or some other 
population group, the cossacks, for instance, can be enough to 
arouse national separatist feelings in some republics of the 
Federation. 
  I consider the anti-Western feelings which are developing in 
a particular political environment, for instance the Duma 
environment, to be a very dangerous prejudice. This prejudice 
can not only cast Russia's foreign policy back to the Cold War 
but can also drastically aggravate the domestic political 
situation since the revival of the ideas of the West's intrigues 
intensifies the atmosphere of fear and suspicion in society. 
  But on the other hand the West is not lacking as regards 
prejudices against Russia. You are simply amazed at how 
powerfully some Western minds have been gripped by the prejudice 
that the position of Russians in a number of countries of nearby 
foreign parts is merely a question of acts of provocation by a 
few Russian groups of nationalist orientation and not of the 
problem of legal and actual discrimination that really exists. 
  [Mamaladze] Some of your Presidential Council colleagues 
have developed the concept of Russia's special rights and 
interests throughout the post-Soviet area, a kind of Russian 
"Monroe doctrine." After it had been widely publicized you 
could not convince the politicians and public of adjacent 
countries that their fears regarding Russia's neo-imperial 
ambitions were unjustified. 
  Please open the doors of the presidential kitchen. Is the 
opinion that there are too many cooks in this kitchen and that 
each has his own recipe for stew a prejudice? 
  [Pain] I am no expert in political cuisine. I shall merely 
say that indeed too many cooks spoil the broth. We have about 
10 departments studying the problem of interethnic relations and 
conflicts. 
  But it must not be forgotten that there is a president and 
the role of his personal decisions is great. If in some 
critical situations he had not taken personal control their 
greater aggravation could have been forecast. 
  [Mamaladze] I remember about two years ago there was talk of 
a single state system for preventing conflicts in the Russian 
Federation. Is it taking shape somehow? 
  [Pain] No, and I would not pin too much hope on such a 
system. As long as there is disagreement in decisionmaking 
because of contradictory department interests, no institution of 
power will definitively and fully ensure accord in society? 
  [Mamaladze] And the Treaty on Accord? 
  [Pain] It is only the precursor of the authorities' ability 
to lead matters toward the coordination of interests. But 
neither this act nor the structural innovations themselves can 
in themselves do what society as a whole cannot do. 
  [Mamaladze] You mean that so far it cannot rid itself of 
traditional ideas and feelings? 
  [Pain] In society several ideologies exist at the same time 
-- extremely popular and just as contradictory.. The ideology 
of the classic imperial approach and its most colorful and 
consistent expresser -- Mr. Zhirinovskiy. The ideology of soft 
"respectable" expansionism in the approaches to the post-Soviet 
area -- "we must annex not everything but only what can easily 
be grabbed." Finally, there is the ideology of complete 
isolationism, manifested so clearly during talks on the 
unification of the monetary systems of Russia and Belorussia. 
  [Mamaladze] So where are these ideas actually circulating -- 
in society or in the corridors of power? 
  [Pain] Public opinion polls show that 70 percent of Russians 
oppose the imperial idea in the "Zhirinovskiy" or respectable 
packaging. You only have to put the question specifically: "Do 
you want an association in which the inflation level will 
increase still further?" for the majority to answer "no." 
  How the authorities interpret and use public feelings is 
another matter. These people today are more great 
power-oriented, more nationalist, than the population. I 
repeat, there is no mass chauvinism, there is the "philosophy of 
prejudice" which serves the political interests of certain 
groups in the power structures, and it is particularly dangerous 
when it is made out to be the voice of the people. 
  [Mamaladze] Who is making this out? Which authorities? 
  [Pain] A very substantial proportion of the middle-echelon 
management apparatus and local apparatus -- the former party and 
economic aktiv. "We do not have the right to fail to consider 
the masses' feelings," they say, as though they were not 
speaking on their own behalf. In fact this is nothing other 
than attempts to grab the banner of great-powerdom from the 
opposition, which has monopolized this idea and will not 
surrender it for anything. 
  [Mamaladze] We are talking in the building of the former 
CPSU Central Committee, your office once belonged to a 
department chief. Someone called you and those like you 
"democratic flies" which have flown into the thick soup of 
autocracy. What are you doing here? To what extent are the 
results of your research called for by those for whom you work? 
  [Pain] Clearly not 100 percent. Even ideally they cannot by 
called for 100 percent: There is a big difference between the 
responsibility of the expert and the responsibility of the 
political decisionmaker. But our opinion -- I am not only 
talking of myself -- is heeded and some ideas are put to work, 
often producing a positive result. 
  [Mamaladze] I would be delighted at this fact but reality 
prevents it. "Nationally minded people" continue to nurture 
destructive plans. The experience of bloodshed is by no means 
sobering, on the contrary.... Some "preserved" conflicts are 
smoldering under the "cover" of emergency measures. Territorial 
wars are continuing. And talks on a full-scale political 
settlement of conflicts are being disrupted before our eyes time 
after time. 
  What is your prediction on this score? 
  [Pain] There are no eternal conflicts, sooner or later they 
subside -- that is the postulate of conflictology, checked by 
historical practice. And although, most unfortunately, 
interethnic wars have a corrupting effect on specific people, 
adapting their awareness toward the horrors of living in an 
atmosphere of violence and fear, "metal fatigue" does 
nonetheless ensue. The politicians' task is to catch that point 
in the conflict's trajectory at which talks will produce the 
best result. 
  Despite the disappointing results of the talks an analysis 
of 
the situation leads to the prediction that a favorable political 
situation will take shape in a number of trouble spots. An 
understanding is developing of the fact that military victory 
cannot be one either by our own forces or by those of a "third 
party." 
  However much we may be concerned for peacekeeping operations 
they will not achieve their aim unless they are supported by the 
implementation of joint interests. Armies are good when you 
have to separate sides but it is not armies that extinguish 
conflicts but banks, corporations, joint ventures, and projects 
for mutually advantageous undertakings. And I can only rejoice 
that this idea is finally in political circulation on an equal 
footing with formulas for demilitarizing conflict zones and the 
safe return of refugees.

  [Text] Moscow May 19 TASS -- "The signing of an agreement 
on civic accord which began 20 days ago gave a positive impetus 
to socio-political processes in the Russian Federation. The 
document changes the character of political relations in the 
country and creates a basis for the beginning of the unification 
of all strata of Russian society," said Chairman of the 
Federation Council Vladimir Shumeyko, opening a signing ceremony 
which took place in the St. Vladimir Hall in the Grand Kremlin 
Palace today. 
  Representatives of creative associations, scientific 
organisations, workers of culture and science put their 
signatures under the agreement. 
  The process of signing the agreement began by a ceremonial 
act in the Kremlin attended by the Russian president, prime 
minister, representatives of both chambers of the Russian 
parliament, representatives of the subjects of the Federation, 
leaders of a number of parties, public and religious 
associations. The agreement is open to representatives of any 
political forces coming out for peace and accord in the country, 
for strengthening state power and surmounting the socio-economic 
crisis.

  [Text] MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS has learned from reliable 
sources that yesterday the president turned down a resignation 
request from Major General Yevgeniy Savostyanov, chief of 
Moscow's directorate of the Russian Federation Federal 
Counterintelligence Service [FCS]. 
  Rumors of Savostyanov's imminent resignation had been around 
for several weeks. The request was finally written but turned 
down. Various things are being said about the major general's 
wish to resign. According to one guess, Savostyanov decided to 
go into politics. Many staffers in his directorate however 
think their boss is simply in a hurry. MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS 
has information that Sergey Stepashin, FCS director, would like 
to see Cherkasov, the current chief of the St. Petersburg FCS 
directorate, occupying the Moscow directorate. Stepashin has 
been friends with Cherkasov for a long time and he interceded 
for him at the time of the repeat certification procedure.

"Shumeyko Is a Cossack, Although He Has a Ukrainian Surname"] 
  [Text] Yesterday journalists were invited to the 
Federation Council for another rendezvous with Vladimir 
Shumeyko. In his characteristic manner the speaker of the upper 
chamber of parliament talked a lot, mainly in hints. From 
Shumeyko's replies to written questions submitted the previous 
day the journalists learned that Vladimir Shumeyko is a Cossack, 
although he has a Ukrainian surname, that he was most 
comfortable in the post of general director of a Krasnodar 
plant, where "there was real power," and that he, Shumeyko, has 
many pluses as a politician: communicability and loyalty to his 
political ideals regardless of the political situation. 
Vladimir Filippovich admitted that at first he had had a hard 
time in Moscow because of his provincial origins, but then life 
hardened him. 
  Answering the journalists' meticulous questions about the 
cadre leapfrogging going on in the state, Shumeyko did not hide 
the fact that he was directly involved in forming the Cabinet of 
Ministers just once -- in December 1992 -- and even then on the 
president's direct orders. He made literally this assessment of 
the present premier's activity: "Russia is lucky that 
Chernomyrdin is the premier at this stage." Vladimir 
Filippovich spoke severely of Shakhray, who had resigned the 
previous day, declaring that this will have no effect whatever 
on the state of interregional problems, with the possible 
exception that "with Yegorov's accession the resolution of these 
problems will move from the theoretical phase to the phase of 
their practical resolution." 
  Shumeyko was understanding about Nikolay Travkin's recent 
ministerial appointment, declaring that Russia needs people with 
practical experience. The speaker of the Federation Council did 
not deny that he has close ties to the president, but exactly as 
much as is necessary to engage in joint state activity. 
  He complained: "I have been told repeatedly that I am 
Yeltsin's man, and he constantly transfers me now to parliament, 
now to the executive. But I have never been unfaithful to 
myself: I favor strong state power, and this is why I am in the 
president's team."

  [Text] The suit filed by the procurator general's office 
against the pilots' union was heard today at the Moscow city 
court. [video shows O.A. Yegorova, captioned as member of the 
civil commission of the Moscow city court] 
  [Yegorova] The court decided that the strike, announced and 
carried out by the pilots' union of the Russian Federation, is 
illegal. In accordance with the 20 May 1991 law on procedures 
for resolving collective labor disputes, in particular Article 
12, which states that public transportation, which includes 
civil aviation, cannot settle its problems, disputes, or 
conflicts through strikes. 
  [Announcer] Union representatives, who in general agreed 
with 
the court's decision, nevertheless think that the law providing 
for such situations contains contradictions. According to the 
new Constitution of the Russian federation, they do have a right 
to strike in order to settle their labor disputes. 
  Right now pilots are discussing their demands at the Labor 
Ministry. Their main demand is an increase in pensions. 
According to the pilots' union, veteran pilots receive from the 
pension fund only one-fifth of the sum paid to the fund by the 
civil aviation department.

"Danger of Pressure From Lobby Groups"] 
  [Text] For the few months it has been in power Viktor 
Chernomyrdin's government has managed to achieve a positive 
result as regards curbing inflation, but there is a danger that 
the cabinet, under pressure from agrarian and 
military-industrial complex lobby groups, will make undesirable 
adjustments to monetary and credit policy. This was stated by 
Yevgeniy Yasin, leader of the Russian Federation president's 
analysis center. 
  In his opinion the rate of the reforms has slowed down 
somewhat in the same period. "We could and should have moved 
faster," he said. Yasin believes that the government's main 
task is "not to hold up the processes begun in 1992 but to 
provide the opportunity to implement the transformations at the 
level of enterprises and regions."

<F P=106> [Yuriy Rytov article under "Social Focus" rubric: "The Cost </F>
of Strikes"] 
  [Text] It seems that strikes have become a truly national 
affliction in the conditions of our undeveloped democracy (not 
to be confused with "developed socialism"). Everyone is 
striking: miners and metallurgists, teachers and ambulance 
personnel.... 
  While 18,200 people participated in strikes in the first 
quarter of last year, the figure was 114,500 in the first 
quarter of this year. And second place in the list of strikers, 
after the Trojans in the fuel and energy complex (87,000 
people), was taken by education workers (24,700). 
  It hardly need be explained why these people are striking. 
Very tough labor conditions and low wages (as applied to these 
two polarized spheres of people's activity) are inducing them to 
take extreme protest measures. 
  This fact cannot fail to draw the attention of independent 
experts. Why exactly are two extremes -- the working class 
elite and the intelligentsia elite -- coming together in protest 
actions? 
  The answer is unusually simple. These two particular social 
categories of the population have felt the greatest loss -- both 
material and moral -- during the ill-considered and hasty 
economic reforms. 
  We will recall that the profession of schoolteacher has 
always enjoyed special esteem in Rus. Soviet rule did 
substantial damage to that prestige. Yet there were still 
zealots in our country who valued their work much more highly 
than immediate worldly benefits. But that is not why teachers, 
who have been suffered material harm for the umpteenth time, are 
striking now. Schools are collapsing -- their world is 
collapsing. Demanding money for teaching peasant children -- 
excuse me, but this does not happen in any civilized country. 
  And the miners? They were always considered the pride of the 
working class. Now it would seem that a completely democratic 
procedure to coordinate the interests and mutual demands of 
workers, employers, and executive branch organs has been devised 
-- a trilateral commission. 
  But the whole trouble is that the agreements being adopted 
are not being implemented, and the fault lies with the 
executive. This is what causes many strikes: the failure to 
implement tariff agreements, the budget debt as regards the 
financing of research and maintenance and repair work, the poor 
level of technical equipment, a lack of resources for acquiring 
medical and school equipment, etc. 
  But strikes are by no means destroying the national 
economy's 
work. Maybe that is why the powers-that-be have a calm attitude 
to them. For instance, in the first quarter of this year output 
worth a total of only 8.8 billion rubles [R] was lost as a 
result of strikes. This includes R8.2 billion in the fuel and 
energy complex. 
  A drop in the ocean when compared to the losses we are 
incurring because of the continuing objective production 
recession (25 percent for the first half of the year, according 
to expert estimates). 
  But besides the material harm there is the damage to morale, 
which can lead to social cataclysms. Unfortunately nobody wants 
to take that into account.

<F P=106> [Article by Irina Goryacheva, chief of the Russian </F>
Federation Government Economics Trends Center Analysis and Price 
Forecasting Administration: "Energy Getting Dearer, But Not For 
Everyone Equally"] 
  [Text] Average price growth for energy resources in April 
was 9.6 percent. Electricity was up most -- by 14.4 percent -- 
while prices for raw-material energy resources increased by 9.2 
percent, and oil refining industry output was up by 4.6 percent. 
As a whole, the main types of energy resources have increased 
by 90 percent since the start of the year, including increases 
of 120 percent for raw materials, 90 percent for electricity, 
and 60 percent for petroleum products. 
  Among the types of raw-material energy resources surveyed 
(oil, coal, and gas) the biggest price rise this April was for 
coal -- 17.4 percent (6.5 percent in March, an increase of 80 
percent since the start of the year). The variation in the 
average price of coal in different economic regions was 2.2. 
times. 
  Among raw-material energy resources the smallest rise over 
the month was recorded for oil -- up 6.5 percent (19 percent in 
March, an increase of 110 percent since the start of the year). 
Oil prices varied by up to 2.5 times in different economic 
regions. 
  The increase in the price of oil-refining industry products 
was 4.6 percent in April -- up 60 percent since the start of the 
year. The largest increase over the month was recorded for motor 
vehicle oils (up 50.4 percent). Since the start of the year the 
biggest increases have been recorded by motor vehicle oils (up 
110 percent), lubricating oils (up 80 percent), and fuel oil and 
bitumen (70 percent). The largest regional variations in the 
price of the refined petroleum products surveyed were for diesel 
fuel and bitumen at around three times. 
  In April, as in March, the rate of increase in retail prices 
for gasoline (10.9 percent) exceeded the change in the average 
price charged for it by producer enterprises (5.6 percent). The 
average retail price for gasoline in the Russian Federation was 
284 rubles [R] a liter -- 80 percent higher than producer 
enterprises' prices (R156). 
  Power station prices for electricity increased by 14 percent 
in April. This increase was mainly recorded at power stations 
in the Northern and Central Regions -- up 24 percent. Rates at 
power stations in the Central Chernozem and Far East Regions 
remained virtually at the March level. In late April the 
average price of 1,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity in Russia 
was R31,000. The highest electricity charges continued to be 
recorded in the Far East Region (R45,000), while the lowest were 
in the East Siberia Region (R18,000).

  [Text] Moscow May 20 -- A Gorizont communications and 
telecasting satellite was launched from Site 81 of the Baykonur 
Cosmodrome at 05.01, Moscow Daylight Saving Time, on Friday by 
Russian Space Defence Forces (SDF). 
  The satellite was lofted into space atop a heavy-duty 
three-stage Proton-K booster rocket with a Dm-2 boost section. 
  This is the second Gorizont satellite launched under a 
contract between Russia and the U.S. Rimsat company (the first 
one was launched on November 18, 1993). 
  The contract provides for the launching of seven Russian 
satellites -- three Gorizont ones and four Express ones -- 
within the period of September 1993 to March 1996. They are put 
into geostationary orbits with fixed postions over the Pacific 
Ocean region. The full value of the contgract is 150 million 
U.S. dollars. 
  The successful launch was watched by Rimsat company 
representatives, a spokesman at the SDF press centre told 
ITAR-TASS. 
  The launch was the 210th one since 1967 when a Proton-K 
booster rocket was used for the first time and the 188th 
successful one.

  [Text] Moscow May 19 TASS -- Russia sets up a new structure 
in its armed Forces -- mobile forces which will include rapid 
deployment forces and instant reaction forces, Colonel-General 
Vladimir Semyonov, commander-in-chief of these forces, told a 
news conference at the main headquarters of the land forces 
today. 
  According to the general, these changes are envisaged by the 
military reform and requirements of the main provisions of 
Russia's military doctrine. Vladimir Semyonov called the 
establishment of the mobile forces a "coerced measure". 
  "We were forced to do this due to the current political 
situation in Russia and the new views developed by military 
science and strategy," the commander-in-chief said. 
  The mobile forces, the colonel-general noted, will be used 
at 
a "threatening period". With the outbreak of local and other 
conflicts, Vladimir Semyonov noted, these forces will be moved 
to the necessary regions "for a short period of time". For 
instant- reaction forces this period will be twenty-four hours 
and for rapid deployment forces -- several days. 
  The commander-in-chief determined some tasks to be resolved 
by the mobile forces: The inadmissibility of spreading of local 
conflicts, the localization of large scale conflicts and the 
creation of conditions for strategical deployment of Russian 
Armed Forces. 
  The colonel-general believes that the mobile forces will be 
best staffed in the Russian Armed Forces. They will also 
include units and subunits of land and airborne troops, military 
transport and combat aircraft and other units from fighting 
services and branches of arms.

  [Text] Presidential spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov quoted 
Yeltsin as saying that the administration did not believe the 
Duma-approved 37 billion rubles defence budget was adequate 
enough to meet all of the Army's outstanding requirements. 
However, despite verbal declarations of sympathy with the 
Russian Army's hardships, it was this budget that opposition 
parties such as Liberal Democrats, Communists and others had 
approved in its first reading, Kostikov said. 
  In his words, there is a ploy behind the parliamentary move 
aimed to put the Army on a ration so as to bring it into head on 
collision with the president. "The president is well aware of 
this behind-the-scenes political gambling". 
  On the country's further defence spending, Kostikov said 
that 
it would make no sense to increase military expenditure given 
that the Russian Army was to be trimmed down. But to try to 
keep it at last year's level proceeding from the 1993 prices was 
a different matter altogether, Kostikov said. 
  However, he made it clear that an increase in this year's 
defence budget would not be made at the cost of public spending.

  [Text] Moscow May 19 TASS -- The Russian president stands 
for preserving the defence budget at the last year's level in 
comparable prices, without precluding its possible moderate 
growth, presidential press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov told a 
briefing on Thursday in reply to an ITAR-TASS question. 
  However, Boris Yeltsin does not intend to yield to lobbying 
and to permit its sharp rise: such a disbalance is fraught with 
an increase in social tension. 
  The press secretary called attention to the fact that 
"communist-Zhirinovskiy opposition", speaking in words about 
their loyalty to the army, voted at the Russian parliament lower 
house for a minimum defence budget for tactical reasons. 
  According to Kostikov, it wants to give hand-outs to the 
army, causing dissatisfaction there, and to put it at 
loggerheads with the president. 
  Kostikov also expressed the president's concern over the 
continued campaign in some media against Russian Defence 
Minister Pavel Grachev. 
  "The president does not see clearly reasons behind it. There 
are no real grounds to say that there is misunderstanding 
between the president and the defence minister," he stressed. 
  "The president declares his full political and moral support 
for Pavel Grachev. But at the same time, he does not want to 
show that he has no serious claims to the minister," Kostikov 
continued, adding that Yeltsin is not satisfied with progress of 
the military reform.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Minister Is Unclothed!"] </F>
  [Text] President Yeltsin has refused to approve the new 
Russian army uniform sported by Pavel Grachev and the entire 
Defense Ministry. Grachev's service jacket has been deemed 
reminiscent of a Latin American dictator's outfit. It is 
noteworthy that Pavel Grachev has worn his uniform illegally. 
Being part of the Russian state trappings, it is subject to 
approval by a special legislative enactment. 
  Several hundred billion rubles has been spent on designing 
the "Grachev-style" uniform. Under the orders of the USSR 
Defense Ministry still in effect, a new uniform, just like any 
other innovation, should have been first tested in a particular 
military unit in what is called "experimental wearing" so as to 
identify and take into account all the shortfalls and wishes by 
the military and then have it approved. This has not been done: 
The new uniform was simply presented to the top brass. 
Emulating their bosses, lower-ranking Defense Ministry 
apparatchiks also donned it. At present yet another new uniform 
is hastily being designed, based on Russian national traditions. 
  Interestingly, the designers of the "Grachev" uniform seem 
to 
have vanished into thin air: no one knows who they are. As 
MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS has learned, Colonel Ivan Prekhno, chief 
of the Uniform Design Department, is about to resign.

<F P=106> [Ilya Bulavinov report under the "Generals on Military </F>
Budget" rubric: "The Army and Hope Are the Last To Die"] 
  [Text] The Army does not indulge the press with 
information too much. This is the reason why a news conference 
by a high- ranking commander always promises something 
interesting. The meeting with journalists by Colonel General 
Vladimir Semenov, commander in chief of the Army, which is 
scheduled for today, is doubly interesting: it will be held on 
no specific occasion, but against the background of shock 
experienced by the top brass following the allocation of what 
the Defense Ministry sees as a negligible sum for the military. 
General Semenov himself is known for his views that have been 
fairly frequently at odds with Pavel Grachev's, in particular, 
on ways of military organization in Russia. 
  The officially stated subject of the news conference -- "The 
State and Development Prospects of the Army in the Conditions of 
Military Reform" -- scarcely holds any interest for a wider 
range of readers. Obviously, following cuts in the military 
budget "the state and development prospects" of the Army are far 
from bright. All the more so because these troops will receive a 
lesser percentage of the defense appropriations than others. 
Ironically, General Semenov, who formerly fiercely opposed the 
current contract system of manpower acquisition, will evidently 
have to be the first to halt this practice because of a lack of 
funds. 
  What is of much greater interest, however, is how General 
Semenov will comment on the overall military budget, not just 
the army budget. Observers do not rule out that he, being a 
well-known opponent of Pavel Grachev in military affairs, may 
express the opinion held by a part of the top brass displeased 
with the defense minister's inability to squeeze out sufficient 
money for the Armed Forces. If General Semenov dares criticize 
the minister's policy, this may mean that a serious opposition 
to Grachev has emerged in the Armed Forces. To criticize 
without the appropriate support would be rather dangerous even 
for so high-ranking a commander: recently even multi-star 
generals live in constant wait for drastic reshuffles. 
  If General Semenov does no overstep the limits of the news 
conference agenda, however, this will also be full of meaning. 
The refusal to exploit as advantageous a subject as the budget 
to criticize an opponent will prove that to all appearances the 
battle for the Armed Forces' money is not over yet and the 
generals still pin their hopes on Grachev. If this is so, any 
criticism of Grachev can be put off until better times, for the 
infighting could only harm "the common cause:" A high-ranking 
ministry official told your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent that 
"the main thing is to get the money, and what will happen 
afterward is our own business." KOMMERSANT-DAILY will report the 
results of the news conference tomorrow.

  [Text] Russia is starting the destruction of chemical 
weapon manufacturing equipment. A decision to this effect was 
made by First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets following his 
visit of the Khimprom company in Chuvashia which used to 
manufacture chemical shells. 
  The production of chemical weapons was discontinued in the 
factory in 1987 but the equipment capable of doing so has 
remained intact. Soskovets and Chuvashia's President Nikolai 
Fyodorov ordered the compiling of a schedule for the 
stage-by-stage destruction of the equipment. 
  Viktor Glukhikh, chairman of the State Defense Industry 
Committee, told Interfax that this decision marked the beginning 
of a large scale process in the country. The reluctance on the 
part of the U.S. to sign the appropriate convention might, 
however, hinder the process, he said.

<F P=106> [Otto Latsis article: "Russia's Weapons -- The Threat to </F>
Their Security. People Involved in Accidents With Weapons and 
Ammunition Talk on This Topic"] 
  [Text] The usual process will doubtless follow in the wake 
of the blast at the ammunition dump near Vladivostok: A 
commission will be set up to investigate the causes, criminal 
proceedings will be instigated "in the light of the facts," 
promises will be made to get the bottom of the matter and report 
all the details to the public, and then there will probably be a 
desire to forget about what has happened as quickly as possible. 
But even if some day we do find out something reliable and 
noteworthy regarding the circumstances which led to this 
incident, it is already too late to be satisfied with such 
information. 
  Let us recall the accidents of statewide and even 
international significance which Russia's Armed Forces have 
"bequeathed" to us over a short period in the Vladivostok area 
alone: Two terrible explosions at ammunition dumps; the tragedy 
on Russkiy Island (regarding which, it was recently announced, 
no proper conclusions have yet been reached); and the 
international furor occasioned by the dumping of radioactive 
waste. The problem of processing and storing this waste has not 
yet been resolved. And across the country as a whole? Merely 
listening to an account of the attack carried out by a single 
mentally unbalanced soldier, without any special preparations, 
on the guard of a nuclear missile complex in the Altay is enough 
to make your hair stand on end. What would happen if a gang of 
blackmailers were to repeat this "experiment" with special 
preparations? After all, bandits -- whether in the capital or 
the distant backwoods -- and participants in armed conflicts in 
CIS countries open fire daily using firearms that have been 
seized, stolen, or bought from our Army. 
  We need to look the truth in the eye: Russia's weapons have 
become one of the principal threats to its security. We can and 
must pinpoint and eliminate omissions in the organization of 
weapons and ammunition storage, strengthen discipline, and so 
forth. But in addition we must acknowledge that the military 
shield forged during the 50 years since World War II is so heavy 
that it threatens to crush us. 
  I am not talking about buttressing those serving in the 
Russian Armed Forces today. The problem was created by the 
generation of political and military leaders who have just 
retired. It became evident when Stalin, through his support for 
North Korean aggression, frightened the Western world with the 
threat of communist expansion, and it deepened when Khrushchev, 
by frightening the world with enormous superbomb tests, refused 
to heed the warnings of the bomb's creator A.D. Sakharov; 
finally, the problem took on a disastrous turn when the Brezhnev 
team switched from a policy of military sufficiency to one of 
military parity. Defense parity not backed up by industrial 
parity proved too much for our economy and exhausted it even 
more than the inefficient antimarket system, thus making 
spasmodic and ill-prepared reforms an inevitability. Parity 
isolated the Soviet Union politically. Finally, having turned 
the heads of the political and military leaders of the time, 
defense parity dragged our military into Afghanistan, Africa, 
and Latin America, even across the equator. 
  Hopefully, bitter experience has convinced our current 
leaders that such a policy is ruinous. But it is not enough 
merely to realize this, it seems. Events such as the explosion 
near Vladivostok demonstrate that there is another purely 
technical or technical-economic problem: We clearly lack the 
funds to properly ensure the upkeep of our hypertrophied defense 
industry. The problem is compounded by the fact that all this 
coincides with the extremely complex task of withdrawing troops 
from both inside and outside the CIS and the worsening of 
servicemen's social hardships. The need for expenditure to 
improve the upkeep of hardware is directly at variance with the 
need to spend money on the upkeep of personnel. There is just 
one way out: Cut the Armed Forces' weapons and manpower more 
quickly and decisively than has been done up to now. 
  It is apparently more expensive to cut back the Armed 
Forces than it is to continue funding them. The following 
example is cited: When an officer is discharged early into the 
reserve, he must be paid 20 times his monthly salary. This is 
an unconvincing example, as any economist will immediately 
recognize. One-shot items of expenditure should never be 
directly compared with ongoing expenditure. If severance pay is 
viewed as an investment made in order to reduce current 
expenditure in the future, then reimbursement in 20 months' time 
is an excellent time frame by any economic standard. 
  According to data from INTERFAX, this year Russia will need 
600 billion rubles [R] to recycle its military hardware. 
Overall, the recycling program will cost R3.5 trillion in 1994 
prices. This was announced by Russian First Vice Premier Oleg 
Soskovets at a joint session of the collegium of the Russian 
State Committee for the Defense Sectors of Industry and the 
Udmurtia Council of Ministers held in Izhevsk Monday [16 May]. 
O. Soskovets also announced that by the year 2000 we will have 
to recycle 150 submarines, 7,500 tanks, and 20,000 artillery 
pieces and other types of hardware. 
  It makes sense to find the money to accelerate this process 
even at the cost of cutting expenditure on state investment in 
the national economy. Because the payoff could in fact come 
even earlier if we bear in mind that an able-bodied officer 
could leave the Army and get involved in productive activity, 
and that the material resources that are currently spent on the 
upkeep of superfluous weapons could be channeled into social and 
economic objectives. But, most important of all, here we have a 
case where not everything can be measured in terms of an 
economic transaction alone. It is worth any amount of money to 
reduce the risk of accidents like the one at Vladivostok, let 
alone the incident in the Altay.

  [Text] It is now known that the Pacific Fleet Command is 
planning to move an old TNT-5 tanker carrying a load of liquid 
nuclear waste from Bolshoy Kamen harbor (Maritime Territory) to 
a safer place, possibly Pavolsk Bay. A final decision is to be 
taken this week. The other tanker, TNT-27, also laden with 
nuclear waste, is to stay put at Bolshoy Kamen because experts 
do not put its seaworthiness in question. 
  Last month, the regional committee for nuclear safety 
decided 
to dump a new load of nuclear waste from the TNT-5 tanker in 
prescribed parts of the Sea of Japan, its head Yevgeniy 
Stomatyuik told INTERFAX. The decision follows a deterioration 
of the vessel's state after last winter leading to a number of 
faults in its drainage, pipelines and valves and cracks in its 
engine department, he said. 
  Last October, TNT-27 dumped a load of about 1,000 cubic 
meters of liquid nuclear waste of low radiation levels in to the 
Sea of Japan. 
  At the same time, the regional administration had pledged 
not 
to dump any more waste from the TNT-5 tanker until after the 
question of when and who will finance the construction of a 
reprocessing facility in the region has been resolved. 
  The problem was also high on the agenda of last month's 
meeting by a Russian-Japanese commission of experts. Two 
options were suggested: The facility is to be either sea or 
land-based.

  [Text] "The Ukrainian leadership's decision to deploy a 
group of national guards and specially trained troops in the 
Crimea is fraught with serious consequences primarily for 
Ukraine itself. It cannot fail to give rise to concern in 
Moscow," a senior member of Russia's Foreign Ministry in charge 
of Russian-Ukrainian relations told INTERFAX on Friday. 
  According to him, "now the danger of displaying extremism by 
both Kiev and Simferopol, with all the ensuing consequences, is 
greater than ever before." 
  "We do not back the Crimean radicals, of course. 
Nevertheless Ukraine, which is, speaking figuratively, in 
another weight division, should behave as it befits a big 
power," the diplomat said. 
  So far the Crimean people have acted in the framework of 
democratic procedures, without violating Ukrainian legislation, 
he noted. "As regards Kiev, it is not quite clear how it 
interprets democracy and contemporary international law. To 
despatch troops is not a good way out of the situation," said 
INTERFAX's interviewee. 
  According to him, "if events in the Crimea develop in the 
same vein, this might grow into a long-term conflict." "The 
experience of the former Yugoslavia shows that playing with fire 
ends in a big blaze," he said. 
  Ukraine "can hardly find anything wrong in Russia's 
behavior," the diplomat pointed out. "It's characteristic that 
neither Russia's president and government nor parliament have 
made any official statements or taken sharp steps so far," he 
said. 
  Nevertheless, Kiev "has not abandoned its attempts to find a 
foe from without," said INTERFAX's interviewee. 
  On Wednesday the press service of Ukraine's president 
released a statement to the effect that "dangerous processes in 
the Crimea are stimulated by some Russian politicians, whose 
actions acquired the signs of open interference in Ukraine's 
internal affairs of late." "We do not even want to comment on 
such statements; Let them remain on Ukraine's conscience," the 
Russian diplomat said.

  [Text] Moscow May 20 TASS -- The Black Sea navy command 
today called on all the political leaders, involved in the 
current events in the Crimea, to do their best to settle all the 
arising disputes by peaceful political means. 
  Political instability in the Crimea and the situation around 
naval bases, says an official statement issued by the Black Sea 
navy press centre today, engenders moral and psychological 
tension in military units. No matter how the situation 
develops, the Black Sea navy will not be able to keep aloof of 
the processes occurring around it. This alarms the command of 
the navy, its officers and noncoms. 
  The statement says that not a single regional conflict was 
solved by armed force over the past twenty years. The wars in 
Nagorno- Karabakh, Yugoslavia and Abkhazia show that the 
ordinary people suffer from the hostilities, but not those who 
unleash them. The Black Sea navy command relies on the wisdom 
and good will of the peoples and the political representative 
they had elected. 
  The winter training is about to end on the Black Sea navy. 
The press centre's statement says that exercises of different 
forces are proceeding according to schedule. Taking part in 
them are warships, auxiliary vessels, and aircraft.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Yezhov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 20 May -- Many aspects of partnerly 
cooperation between Russia and the North Atlantic alliance will 
be decided during Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev's 
forthcoming visit to Brussels, during which he will attend the 
NATO Council meeting. This was stated today by Vitaliy Churkin, 
Russian Federation deputy foreign minister, after talks between 
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Alain Juppe, French 
foreign minister. 
  Vitaliy Churkin stressed that Russia has not officially 
raised the question of special status for itself in the event 
that it joins NATO's Partnership for Peace program. At the 
moment, consideration is being given to an appropriate way of 
reflecting a special form of relations between Russia and NATO. 
The Russian side believes that these relations will be 
extensive and meaningful. The official name for this program of 
cooperation also has to be decided. The scope of the 
interdepartmental consultations on our side goes far beyond 
anything which the countries of Eastern Europe and the CIS 
states, which have already joined Partnership for Peace, are 
prepared to discuss with NATO. Among other things, Russia's 
nuclear status has to be taken into account, the deputy minister 
said. 
  Vitaliy Churkin described Pavel Grachev's forthcoming visit 
to Brussels as unprecedented. The defense minister will meet 
the 16 ministers of defense of the countries belonging to the 
North Atlantic Assembly.

  [Text] Moscow welcomes the discussion by NATO of the 
possibility of granting Russia a special status, Director of the 
Russian Foreign Ministry's Department for European Cooperation, 
Yuriy Ushakov, told Interfax. 
  He said that "judging from this discussion, many of our 
ideas 
concerning partnership and Relations with NATO are being 
heeded." "We are optimistic about NATO's determination to 
discuss relations with Russia. This is a move in the right 
direction, because for natural reasons relations between Russia 
and NATO have gone beyond the Partnership for Peace program," he 
said. 
  To quote Ushakov, Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev's 
visit to Brussels, scheduled for the next week, has two main 
goals. "Firstly, it implies the discussion of the military 
doctrine and high-level contacts with NATO. And secondly, 
Grachev intends to discuss Russia's participation in the 
Partnership program and consolidate the conceptual foundation of 
our cooperation with NATO," he said. 
  He pointed out that the Partnership for Peace program was 
mostly oriented to military cooperation. "At the current stage, 
this is not the most important thing for us. Russia is 
interested in real partnership, above all political and 
economic," he went on to say. 
  He announced that Grachev would inform the NATO officials of 
the Russian ideas of partnership with NATO. "We do not intend to 
slow down our dealings with NATO. The essence of our relations 
with NATO is far more important for us than any framework 
documents similar to the Partnership for Peace program,," he 
said. Russia's partnership with NATO has been developing even 
without the Partnership for Peace program which does not add any 
essential elements to our cooperation," said Ushakov. 
  No statements will be made in Brussels concerning the date 
of 
Russia's joining this program, he continued. 
  The Russian Defense Ministry welcomed the NATO discussion of 
granting Russia a special status in the Partnership for Peace 
program, the Defense Ministry told Interfax on Thursday. 
  Military experts noted, however, that it was not yet clear 
what was actually meant by the term. Neither is it clear how 
Russian representatives will be able to influence decisions 
taken by the participants in the Partnership for Peace program. 
  Experts believe that the definition of Russia's status may 
have the decisive impact on whether or not Russia will join this 
program. "The final decision is to be taken by Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin," said Ushakov. 
  As we reported earlier, Grachev's visit to Brussels and his 
speech at the NATO headquarters, had been scheduled for May 24 
and 25. Firstly, the visit implies the discussion of the 
military doctrine and high-level contacts with NATO. And 
secondly, Grachev intends to discuss Russia's participation in 
the Partnership program and consolidate the conceptual 
foundation of our cooperation with NATO. On his way to Brussels 
(May 23), Grachev is to make a stop-over in Germany where he 
will visit the Western Army Group and hold talks with German 
bankers.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Boris Krivoshey and </F>
Aleksandr Krylovich] 
  [Text] Naples May 19 TASS -- The attempts to put to the 
question the agreed format of the annual summit of the Group of 
Seven (G7) industrialized nations which is due to be held soon 
in the Italian city of Naples, will not promote the success of 
the forthcoming meeting, Grigoriy Karasin, Russian Foreign 
Ministry spokesman, told a briefing here today. 
  A number of foreign news media, he stressed, have been 
publishing materials lately the authors of which "are 
interpreting the format of the oncoming G7 summit differently 
from the earlier agreed one and reported by the Italian side to 
all participants of the meeting". 
  In this connection, Grigoriy Karasin noted, "in the course 
of 
meetings, consultations and exchanges of messages between 
leaders of the Group of Seven and Russia it was agreed that the 
Russian side would participate from the very beginning in 
discussing all political problems the results of which would be 
reflected in a statement by the Italian prime minister presiding 
at the summit on behalf of eight leaders." 
  Thus, the Russian diplomat says, the summit in Naples will 
become a meeting of the "political Group of Eight", for the 
first time in history. 
  According to the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman, the 
practical realisation of this formula has already begun. 
Specifically, he said, Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia Sergey 
Lavrov took part in a meeting between deputy heads and directors 
of political departments of foreign ministries of the G7 and 
Russia who were drawing up a political agenda for the 
forthcoming meeting of heads of state and governments in Naples. 
  Economic problems of interaction between Russia and the G7 
have already been discussed according to a formula "seven plus 
one", Grigoriy Karasin emphasised.

  [Text] France was the only European Union country at a 
session of the EU Council not to support the package of 
agreements reached by Russian Vice-Premier Aleksandr Shokhin and 
Deputy Chairman of the EU Commission Leon Brittan on May 2 in 
Moscow. 
  Deputy Head of the Russian Foreign Economic Relations 
Department for Multilateral Cooperation Maksim Medvedkov told 
Interfax that to adopt the package, approved by all other EU 
members on May 16, would make the prospect of the Agreement on 
Partnership and Cooperation between the Russian Federation and 
the European Union being initialled and then signed in June or 
July a reality. 
  The Shokhin-Brittan agreements concerned ways to settle the 
two most burning issues in Russian economic relations with the 
EU: the conditions for the activity of foreign banks in Russia 
and trade regulations for substances used in the nuclear 
industry, particularly uranium, which has become a true 
stumbling block. 
  Medvedkov said that France was afraid that Russian uranium 
exports would deliver a blow to its own nuclear fuel exports to 
EU countries. He said he doubted that France had any other 
reason to veto the Shokhin-Brittan deal or the signing of the 
partnership and cooperation agreement itself. 
  He said France was simply making the latest in a series of 
attempts to tailor the regulations governing uranium sales to 
its own requirements but without providing so much as a hint of 
an argument in defense of its position. 
  "France's fears are economically groundless and are more 
abstract in character," Medvedkov commented. Paris was 
concerned, for example, that Russia would try to inundate Europe 
with its uranium at some future date and alter the existing 
market. "That assumption too is unfounded, since EU restrictions 
on the export of fissile substances exist, and there are other 
Euroatom rules which are binding for Russia," he said. 
  Russia and France will discuss this complex issue and other 
difficulties associated with the signing of the Agreement on 
Partnership and Cooperation between Russia and the EU during the 
current visit by French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe to Moscow.

  [Text] Moscow May 19 TASS -- Struggle against nationalism 
in all its manifestations, for strict observance of human rights 
should become a top priority area of cooperation between Russia 
and the Council of Europe, said here on Thursday Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev at a meeting with Miguel Angel Marinez, 
president of the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe. 
  The minister noted that the Russian side feels concern over 
the position of the Russian-speaking people in the Baltics. 
  Kozyrev confirmed Russia's desire to join the Council of 
Europe and expressed hope that the practical solution of this 
issue will not take more than one year. 
  The minister noted that May 21 marks another anniversary of 
Andrey Sakharov's birth, a date which traditionally fills the 
hearts of honest Russian people with a hope for the successful 
continuation of the cause of this outstanding champion for human 
rights. 
  "I believe that Russia will be Sakharov's Russia rather than 
Zhirinovskiy's," stressed Kozyrev. He underlined that the 
operating Constitution and democratically elected Russian 
parliament are a guarantee that the present changes will be 
irreversible.

  [Text] Chairman of the Council of Europe Parliamentary 
Assembly Miguel Martinez was sure that Russia would be admitted 
to the Council of Europe at its session in February, 1995. This 
was stated today at the meeting between Miguel Martinez and 
Russian State Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin. 
  Martinez recognized that some members of the Council of 
Europe Parliamentary Assembly had certain doubts on admission of 
Russia. He stressed that he was trying to talk three or four 
leading states into supporting the idea. 
  Miguel Martinez emphasized that several stated would regard 
the presence of Russian troops in Estonia and Latvia as an 
obstacle to Russia's admission to the Council of Europe. 
Martinez himself did not see the problem as one of basic 
importance. 
  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev received Miguel 
Martinez on the same day. 
  Kozyrev said that the Russian leadership was attracting much 
of attention to dynamic development of relations with the 
Council of Europe, the Russian Foreign Ministry told Interfax. 
  Kozyrev suggested that adoption of the new constitution and 
the free democratic elections in Russia had solved all 
key-problems related to the admission of Russia to the Council 
of Europe. He hoped that Russia's application for admission 
would be considered timely.

  [Text] French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, who is on an 
official visit to Russia, today met Chairman of the State Duma 
Ivan Rybkin. Our correspondent Stanislav Bozhenkov was at the 
meeting. We have him on the air. 
  [Bozhenkov] The chairman of the State Duma noted that this 
was the first time a French foreign minister had visited the 
Duma in 80 years. He briefly recounted the work of the Russian 
Duma and its committees to the French guest. Incidentally, 
Chairman of the State Duma Committee on International Affairs 
Vladimir Lukin was present at the meeting. 
  Speaking on the tasks which face the State Duma, Ivan Rybkin 
indicated that we have still to build the complete structure of 
a legal state. We are working in cooperation with the president 
and the government and the Federation Council, Ivan Rybkin said. 
The chairman of the State Duma stressed the need for accord in 
society. The result of this had been the signing of the Treaty 
on Public Accord. This was a necessary condition for carrying 
out reforms. 
  Ivan Rybkin went on to say that he would like to see France 
taking a more active part in our complex affairs. He also 
pointed out the importance of Russia's involvement in the work 
of the Council of Europe. 
  This is my first official visit to Russia, Alain Juppe said 
in the course of the conversation. Bilateral economic and 
political cooperation were at the center of the agenda of the 
Russo-French talks, the French minister pointed out. Also the 
improvement of the two countries' cooperation in solving 
pressing international problems including settling the Bosnian 
crisis and strengthening the stability and security of Europe. 
  Speaking on Russia's involvement in the solution of global 
problems, Alain Juppe said that the Group of Seven should become 
the Group of Eight. My aim, the French minister said, is to 
give the relations between our two countries the character of a 
real partnership.

  [Text] Moscow, 19 May -- Paris welcomes NATO's readiness to 
provide Russia with a special status in the framework of 
"Partnership for Peace" that would correspond to Russia's 
specific character, Alain Juppe, foreign minister of the French 
Republic, told journalists in Moscow on Thursday. 
  France, he said after his talks with Andrey Kozyrev, 
attaches 
great importance to bilateral cooperation with Russia. We are 
trying to encourage partnership between the Russian Federation, 
on the one hand, and Europe and various European institutions, 
on the other. France would like Russia to join the Council of 
Europe. "We are also pleased with the fact," the French 
minister continued, "that the Atlantic Union is ready to give 
special status to Russia that would correspondent to its 
specific character." 
  Juppe said that during the talks in Moscow the situation in 
former Yugoslavia was discussed. You know that our countries 
have been working a lot together on this problem. A few days 
ago Russia, the United States, and the European Union states 
succeeded in adopting a joint document. One must not slacken 
pressure now--it is necessary to continue together to persuade 
the parties in the Bosnian conflict to end hostilities.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Dmitriy Gorokhov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 20 TASS -- Foreign Ministers Andrey 
Kozyrev and Alain Juppe noted during their Thursday evening 
talks here that Russia and France were closely cooperating in 
the effort to settle international crises. The negotations 
confirmed the desire of both sides to "step up the political 
dialogue", which was noted by the French foreign minister during 
his interview with ITAR-TASS on the eve of the visit. 
  A hot line will be opened shortly between the Kremlin and 
the 
Elysee Palace. It will help the presidents of the two countries 
to hold important and urgent consultations whenever necessary. 
The two foreign ministers signed a corresponding agreement 
after a talk which lasted for two and a half hours. But already 
now, the coordination of actions between the sides is very 
close, especially when it comes to protecting the interests of 
their citizens. 
  Thus, the Russian Foreign Ministry has highly appreciated 
the 
French assistance during the evacuation of Russian citizens from 
Yemen. Juppe told journalists that Paris was grateful to Moscow 
for its role in the liberation of French hostages, captured in 
the Bosnian conflict zone. 
  The talk, Kozyrev said, has confirmed the importance of 
permanent contacts at political level. The sides have discussed 
several key problems, including the Russia-European Union 
agreement, which is now in the making. The sides also touched 
on the French proposal to conclude a "stability pact" in 
Europe, which will be discussed at a conference in Paris next 
week. They also discussed further approaches to the Bosnian 
settlement. 
  The French minister described as "exemplary" the interaction 
displayed by Moscow and Paris at present in their approaches to 
the situation in former Yugoslavia. Both countries are actively 
working on the Bosnian problem. Russia, the United States, and 
the European Union were able to adopt a joint document a short 
while ago. At present, the French minister believes, the sides 
should not relax their pressure. It is necessary to further 
exert joint influence on the sides involved in the Bosnian 
conflict in order to make them stop the hostilities. 
  According to Juppe, France attaches great importance to 
bilateral cooperation with Russia. It is striving to conduce 
Russia's partnership with Europe in various European 
institutions. Paris wants Russia to join the Council of Europe. 
"We are also glad," the French minister noted, "that the 
Atlantic union is ready to grant Russia within the Partnership 
for Peace programme a status that would be in keeping with its 
specific character."

  [Text] Late Thursday evening French Foreign Minister Alain 
Juppe summed up the results of three-hour talks with his Russian 
counterpart Andrey Kozyrev by saying Paris is in favor of Moscow 
enjoying a special status in relations with NATO. 
  Kozyrev, in turn, described cooperation between Moscow and 
Paris as a mainstay for new Europe. He hoped Juppe's official 
visit to Moscow would contribute to the cordial understanding 
between the two countries and would help remove objections to 
the conclusion of a formal agreement between Russia and the 
European Union. France opposed, among other things, the export 
of nuclear materials. 
  Juppe hoped he would be able to convince the other 
member-nations of the European Union to voice their own view of 
the problem, with the result that the European Union and Russia 
would, after all, sign an agreement. He said France favors an 
agreement between Russia and the European Union. 
  Juppe thanked the Russian leaders for help in the efforts to 
release eleven French nationals in Bosnia. The French were 
taken hostage on a humanitarian mission near Sarajevo. 
  Kozyrev thanked France for help in the evacuation of Russian 
citizens from Yemen. 
  Kozyrev said that in addition to bilateral relations he and 
Juppe discussed some international issues, including the Bosnian 
developments. Both felt that more pressure must be exerted on 
the conflicting communities for the sake of a cease-fire. 
  In response to a question from Interfax, Kozyrev said that 
Moscow assigned priority to relations with France. He described 
his French counterpart as a good friend and a remarkably 
cultured and intelligent person. 
  It would be premature, Kozyrev said in response to another 
question from Interfax, to try to prognosticate the impact of 
Kiev-Crimea relations on relations between Kiev and Moscow. 
  Kozyrev declined comment on the recent killing of three 
Russian citizens in Algeria. He told a French newsman that the 
situation in Algeria was very complicated. 
  Kozyrev and Juppe agreed to have a hotline between the 
Moscow 
Kremlin and the French Elysee. The two Foreign Ministers 
exchanged also exchanged [as received] archive materials. 
France received part of the French archives which, due to a 
variety of reasons, fell into Moscow's hands, and Russia 
received some Russian archives which had been in France.

  [Text] Moscow, 20 May -- An agreement on partnership and 
cooperation between Russia and the European Community [EC] will 
be ready for initialling in June this year. This was stated 
today by Russian Federation Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy 
Churkin upon completion of Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's 
talks with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe. 
  Vitaliy Churkin said Alain Juppe assured Viktor Chernomyrdin 
of France's readiness in the near future to join Russia in 
resolving the question of the trade in products of the nuclear 
cycle. The special position adopted by France in this area has 
so far held back the talks on concluding a cooperation agreement 
between Russia and the EC. Russia and France are, of course, 
major producers of fuel for nuclear power stations and compete 
in European markets. 
  A number of questions relating to bilateral trade-economic 
cooperation were also discussed at the talks. Alain Juppe 
handed Viktor Chernomyrdin an invitation from French Prime 
Minister Eduard Balladur to visit France in the second half of 
this year. The invitation was accepted.

  [Text] Col-Gen [Vladimir] Semenov, commander in chief of 
ground forces, said the recent talks in Moscow on the Karabakh 
conflict must be regarded as abortive as the Azerbaijanis have 
failed to sign the final document. A similar assessment was 
already made by Col-Gen [Yevgeniy] Podkolzin, commander of 
airborne forces. He also believes airborne forces cannot be 
dispatched to the region without the consent of Baku 
authorities. However, according to the SNARK agency, Russian 
Defense Minister Pavel Grachev does favor the dispatch of 
Russian forces to the Karabakh region.

Ivanov] 
  [Text] Moscow, 20 May (ITAR-TASS) -- It is planned to hold 
a routine meeting of Russian and Kazakhstan experts at the end 
of May to discuss questions of concluding a treaty on leasing 
the Baykonur complex. But before that, on 20 May, it is 
expected that Oleg Soskovets, Russian deputy premier and 
cochairman of the interstate commission on Baykonur, will visit 
the cosmodrome. 
  Oleg Soskovets will be present at the launching of a Proton 
carrier rocket which is to put into orbit the second Gorizont 
space apparatus under a commercial contract with the U.S. 
company Rimsat. The deputy premier will also acquaint himself 
with the state of affairs at Baykonur. 
  The agreement between the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan 
"On the basic principles and conditions for using the Baykonur 
cosmodrome" signed on 28 March by the presidents of the two 
countries should be ratified by the relevant state bodies of 
Russia and Kazakhstan in the near future. After this, the sides 
must conclude the actual treaty on the leasing; specialists on 
the interstate commission are already working on drawing up the 
treaty. 
  However, the problems in "space" relations beteen Russia and 
Kazakhstan did not end with the signing of the agreement. The 
most acutely disputed issue at present is the size of the rent. 
The agreement sets the rent at $115 million a year. But the 
Kazakh side asserts that this is only the "starting price." In 
reality, Russia should pay $480 million a year for Baykonur. 
The difference between 115 million and 480 million can be made 
up by Russia's allocating to Kazakhstan satellite communications 
systems, the results of studies of Kazakhstan's natural 
resources, and also by training Kazakhstan's specialists in 
space equipment. 
  The Russian specialists are bewildered at such an "arbitrary 
interpretation" of the document. They consider that 115 million 
is the total size of the rent which already includes the price 
of services provided for Kazakhstan.

only RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA, TRUD and MEDITSINSKAYA GAZETA are 
published in the republic.

  [Text] Moscow May 19 TASS -- The first session of the joint 
intergovernmental Russian-South Korean economic, scientific and 
technical commission session, planned to open in Seoul on 
Thursday, has been put off, but can be held sometime later in 
Moscow, high-ranking sources in the Russian Foreign Ministry 
told ITAR-TASS. 
  According to the sources, head of the Russian delegation, 
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economics Aleksandr 
Shokhin "due to purely internal circumstances" cannot undertake 
the trip to Seoul on the aforesaid dates. An appropriate 
explanation has been conveyed to the South Korean Foreign 
Ministry. At the same time, a suggestion has been made to hold 
the session in Moscow before the forthcoming June 1 to 4 visit 
to Moscow by South Korean President Kim Yong-sam, especially as 
a number of important problems of economic cooperation between 
the two states are expected to be discussed at the session on 
the eve of the high level visit. 
  "We are now waiting for a response to this proposal," the 
high-ranking Russian diplomat, who wished to remain 
unidentified, said. He emphasised that the Russian side is 
deeply interested in holding the commission's session and 
attaches great significance to it. 
  In turn, sources in the Russian Government told ITAR-TASS 
that Aleksandr Shokhin could not fly to Seoul, as he has been 
charged with "very important tasks" by Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin. The possibility of replacing Aleksandr Shokhin by 
another Vice-Prime Minister Viktor Yarov at the session was also 
considered. But later it was decided that since Aleksandr 
Shokhin has a better understanding of the range of problems, it 
will be "illogical to replace him by another person at the last 
moment." 
  The informed government sources noted that Aleksandr Shokhin 
is "fully involved" in making preparations for the visit to 
Moscow by Kim Yong-sam. For the time being, planned for the 
next week visit to Beijing by Shokhin remains in force which is 
to take place directly before the beginning of Viktor 
Chernomyrdin's official visit to Beijing from May 26 to 29.

  [Text] Seoul May 20 -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin on 
Friday sent a personal message to President Kim Yong-sam of the 
Republic of Korea about a postponement of the first session of 
the Russian-South Korean Intergovernmental Commission for 
Economic Cooperation, according to diplomatic sources in Seoul. 
  The sources said the letter explains that the commission's 
session, which was previously scheduled to be held on Seoul on 
May 20, has been postponed because Aleksandr Shokhin, 
vice-premier and minister of economics, cannot arrive in South 
Korea "due to purely domestic problems". 
  Yeltsin suggested that the commission hold a session in 
Moscow before Kim's visit to Russia. The visit is scheduled for 
June 1-4.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: By correspondents </F>
Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others] 
  [Text] Russia and the People's Democratic Republic of Korea 
are interested in overcoming the current lull in bilateral 
relations and broadening contacts in the political, economic and 
other spheres, which is clear from the visit of North Korean 
diplomats led by the deputy foreign minister, Director of the 
Russian Foreign Ministry's Information and Press Department 
Grigoriy Karasin said during a briefing on Thursday. 
  He announced that the North Korean delegation had held talks 
with deputy foreign ministers Igor Ivanov, Aleksandr Panov and 
Georgiy Mamedov. 
  To quote Karasin, the talks dealt with the establishment of 
inter-parliamentary contacts, with the resumption of the work of 
the inter-governmental consultative commission for economic, 
scientific and technical problems, with the creation of joint 
ventures, with broadening direct contacts between Siberian and 
Far Eastern regions, and with the drafting of a new agreement on 
joint lumbering in the Khabarovsk Territory and Amursk Region. 
  Karasin stated that nuclear problems had been discussed in 
great detail. "Russia favors tougher observance of the 
nonproliferation regime in Korea in accordance with the 
nonproliferation treaty and with the agreement on guarantees 
between North Korea and the IAEA," he said. Moscow also 
welcomes North Korea's latest steps to facilitate the IAEA 
inspection of the north Korean nuclear facilities which began 
last March. 
  The possibility of replacing the armistice agreement with a 
peace agreement which North Korea would like to sign with the 
U.S. was also discussed. "Russia believes that at the current 
stage, armistice is the only way of safeguarding peace in Korea. 
It can be replaced, though, on the basis of mutual agreement of 
all the parties concerned," he said. 
  He said that the North Korean delegation had expressed a 
positive attitude to the Russian proposal on convening an 
international conference on the settlement of the situation in 
the Korean peninsula. "Both parties are convinced that the 
problems facing the Korean Peninsula must be settled peacefully, 
through talks, without pressure and with due account taken of 
the interests of all states," said Karasin.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Platkovskiy article: "Kim Il-song Has Not </F>
Forgotten Gorbachev's `Treachery,' But Is Not Averse to Giving 
Yeltsin a Game"] 
  [Text] There are certain signs that Russia and North Korea 
are overcoming their period of estrangement. 
  In the opinion of Russian diplomats, a turning point in 
Pyongyang's policy emerged during the talks at deputy foreign 
minister level held in Moscow. 
  Dialogue between Moscow and Pyongyang came to a standstill 
in 
1990, when diplomatic relations were established between the 
USSR and South Korea -- a state which is still not recognized in 
the North. The DPRK accused Mikhail Gorbachev of "selling out 
to the puppets in Seoul for $3 billion and betraying true 
friends." 
  Since the collapse of the Union and the appearance of new 
leaders in Moscow the North Korean leadership has maintained the 
utmost coldness in relations with Russia. Nina Andreyeva and 
Lyudmila Zykina have become the most cherished visitors in 
Pyongyang. 
  Now, when North Korea is under pressure from the United 
States and its allies, who are demanding that nuclear programs 
be brought out into the open, Pyongyang is solely reliant on the 
support of China, its traditional ally. Moscow's attempts to 
act as mediator in the nuclear dispute had so far been rejected 
by the North Koreans. However, at these recent talks there was 
a shift in Pyongyang's stance. 
  As IZVESTIYA was informed by Valentin Moiseyev, department 
leader in the Russian Foreign Ministry, for the first time the 
North Korean side made a positive assessment of Moscow's 
initiative to hold an international conference on questions of 
the security and nonnuclear status of the Korean peninsula with 
the participation of Russia, the United States, China, Japan, 
the DPRK, South Korea, and representatives of the UN secretary 
general and of the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
  Moscow diplomats want to ensure that Russia has the 
opportunity to influence the situation. Moscow is very 
concerned by the fact that the United States is threatening the 
DPRK with international economic sanctions. It will be Russia, 
which maintains trading and economic links with North Korea, 
which will have to pay the price here, and not the United 
States, which has no such links. 
  It is important, according to our diplomats, to maintain 
balanced, friendly relations with both North and South Korea. A 
clear tilt toward Seoul has now emerged. 
  The talks did not touch on questions of military-technical 
cooperation. However, according to available information, 
Russian Defense Ministry circles do not rule out the possibility 
in the first instance of supplying the North Korean Army with 
spare parts for its military hardware: The bulk of the 
equipment in the DPRK is Soviet-made. Our military experts 
think that it will thereby be possible to obtain additional 
levers of influence on the North Korean leadership. 
  Meanwhile Russian diplomats continue trying to persuade the 
North Koreans of the need to observe the requirements stemming 
from the Treaty on the Nonproliferetion of Nuclear Weapons. The 
latest attempts were made during the last consultations. They 
were unsuccessful.

<F P=106> [Sergey Shakhray article: "Strategy Needed for Relationship </F>
With China"] 
  [Text] Reform began in China seven years before it began 
here, and it has been more successful. The reason is that the 
Chinese had already had their fingers burned once from trying to 
introduce a foreign (Soviet) development model and had paid a 
huge price for it. 
  The successful progress of reform in China should generate 
close interest from us. We should hardly be expected to blindly 
borrow the experience of "special economic zones" -- we do not 
have a Russian diaspora able, like the "overseas Chinese," to 
pay for 60-90 percent of the development of their native 
provinces. We should not copy the experience of creating "small 
industries" in the countryside -- we do not have a 
200-300-million surplus peasant labor force. Even the very 
attractive "open-door policy" could hardly be replanted here -- 
the Chinese did not have such highly developed industry, 
science, and technology when they gave the "green light" to 
foreign exports and capital investment in strategically 
important sectors. 
  Instead we should learn the political techniques of 
preserving the unity of the state and stability in society. The 
Chinese miraculously averted the collapse of power during the 10 
years of turmoil that were the "Cultural Revolution," and are 
now showing their skill in combining the interests of elites in 
the capital, regions, and sectors, the party and military 
nomenklaturas, and state, private, and foreign enterprises. It 
is this political stability that has made China attractive to 
foreign investment and loans -- which came to $110 billion in 
1993. 
  One way or another, the Chinese success stands out 
particularly against the backdrop of the prolonged crisis in 
Russia and the even more disastrous situation in the adjacent 
regions of Siberia and the Far East. Around 32 million people 
currently live there, but by 2010, if there is no change in the 
current unfavorable economic and demographic trends, there will 
be no more than 8-10 million people left in the endless expanses 
east of the Urals. By then Russia's GNP, according to certain 
academic estimates, will be only 75 percent that of China. For 
the first time in the four centuries of Russo-Chinese relations 
the Middle Kingdom will have overtaken us in its development. 
  A new batch of problems has been created by the rapid 
development of economic ties between Russia and China, 
particularly border regions. Real estate is being illegally 
bought up by entrepreneurs from the other side of the Amur, and 
illegal immigration has become widespread. In certain 
population centers the number of "guests" already exceeds the 
number of Russians. Typically, even the relevant organs have no 
accurate figures on the scale of this phenomenon. But 
unofficial estimates range from several hundred thousand to 2 
million! Meanwhile the local authorities are giving the 
"go-ahead" to the creation of permanent "Chinatown"-style 
settlements -- Chinese "ghettos" such as exist in certain cities 
in Europe, America, and Southeast Asia. In developing 
"fraternal" ties with adjacent Chinese regions, the leaders of 
our settlements and cities are often guided by immediate 
advantage and proceed solely on the basis of local interests. 
And general state interests are suffering. I see the main 
reason for this as being that these -- state -- interests have 
not yet been clearly formulated. 
  Yet another problem has been brought about by the 
disintegration of the Soviet Union and the formation of 
sovereign Central Asian states in the area where Russia and 
China meet. Additional factors -- primarily ethnic and religious 
-- have emerged to complicate an already difficult situation. 
It seems that China is a clear winner -- after all, the 
subdividing of the "soft underbelly of Russia" gives it 
extensive opportunities to make economic and other inroads. But 
the prospect of an ethnic and religious "renaissance" in the 
Central Asian states -- and still more the prospect of an 
interstate union being set up on the basis of the idea of the 
economic, cultural, and religious integration of "Greater 
Turkestan" -- cannot fail to put Beijing on its guard. It knows 
that relatives of the Kazakhs, Tajiks, Uzbeks, Kirghiz [Kyrgyz], 
and Uighurs make up a considerable proportion of the 
representatives of PRC "ethnic minorities" -- who account for 90 
million of the PRC's 1.2 billion citizens and inhabit around 60 
percent of its national territory. 
  Some of the problems of Soviet-Chinese relations -- 
primarily 
border problems -- have been transferred to the Central Asian 
states. But they do not yet have the potential to effectively 
resolve these problems. As a result, Russia has to all intents 
and purposes been left with its former level of political 
responsibility in this region. The military-strategic area is 
being preserved here within the borders of the former USSR -- 
this was confirmed by a recent conference of the leaders of 
border services in the CIS countries. Moreover, the Russian 
Federation is continuing the traditions of the Russian Empire 
and the USSR in their many centuries of relations with the 
Middle Kingdom. 
  Thus, there are obvious problems in our ties with our 
largest 
neighbor on the Eurasian landmass. They can only be solved by 
having a unified state strategy that envisages at least 
short-term programs for developing relations with China for the 
federal center and Federation components, as well as a policy 
agreed with the sovereign states of Central Asia. 
  In elaborating a federal program, we undoubtedly need to 
proceed on the basis of the major documents signed during 
President Yeltsin's state visit to Beijing in December 1992. 
This program should include measures for the priority 
development of Siberia and the Far East, including incentives 
for migration, tax breaks for enterprises of all forms of 
ownership and for investors, and improvements in the provision 
for the military. We should recall the experience of the 
settlement of the Far East in the Russian Empire and allocate a 
proper role to the Cossacks, whose forebears opened up the 
region and served the state in protecting its borders. We need 
to tighten up procedures on the border and in the adjoining 
region, and prevent the creation of "Chinatowns" that could 
become a major irritant to locals and a source of complications 
on an interstate scale. Of course, Moscow will also have to 
undertake some major spending, including subsidies from the 
state budget. The vagaries of market relations will not be 
evenhanded in the competition between our economic structures 
and those of China -- Russian entrepreneurs will have to be 
protected by corresponding laws and administrative measures, 
while not "cutting off the oxygen supply" to our partners on the 
other side of the Amur. 
  I would like to say a few words about the other problems on 
the Russo-Chinese border, which stretches for 4,375 km. In 
deciding the issue of the ownership of several islands on the 
Amur and Argun Rivers we need once again to take account of both 
state and local interests. In our talks with the Chinese I 
think we should also use the tactic of joint economic 
exploitation of disputed territories. 
  Special mechanisms of collaboration with China should be 
created for Russian Federation components directly participating 
in Russo-Chinese cooperation. Clearly, it would be expedient to 
develop such mechanisms in the form of targeted federal regional 
cooperation programs that include a system of preferences and 
exemptions. The federal authorities should provide the program 
participants with a clear-cut plan for cooperation, changes in 
regional quotas, tax breaks and customs concessions, and access 
to centralized credit resources and subsidy funds. Particular 
attention should be devoted to the system of the functioning of 
Chinese citizens on Russian territory -- capital inflows should 
not be accompanied by the Chinese population becoming 
established. 
  As for cooperation with the Central Asian states, Moscow 
must 
take the initiative in concluding a range of bilateral and 
multilateral treaties on mutual relations with the PRC. For 
instance, the idea of economic development for the Semirechye 
zone in the area where the Russian, Kazakhstani, and Chinese 
borders intersect looks attractive. 
  We need to do everything in our power to ensure that the 
processes of rapid Chinese development, the coming revival of 
Russia -- of which I am confident -- and the inevitable process 
of the creation of a Eurasian union or confederation of Eurasian 
states do not counteract each but interact, complement, and 
strengthen each other. Relations with China are too important 
to Russia to be allowed to drift.

  [Text] Moscow May 20 TASS -- The Chinese Embassy in Russia 
expressed "concern" over the visit of the Dalai Lama to Moscow. 
Spokesman of the embassy Zhang Zhiming told TASS on Friday that 
"China views the activities of the Dalai Lama as political in 
their essence and aimed at splitting the country". 
  The Chinese Embassy "attentively and with great concern 
follows the activities of the Dalai Lama" in the Russian 
capital, he added. 
  The spokesman stressed that Russian-Chinese relations are 
developing in a good way and that the basic principles of such 
relations had been fixed in a number of agreements. "The 
Chinese side hopes that the Russian Government will abide by the 
principles regarding the Dalai Lama", he stressed. 
  The spokesman expressed hope that the stay of the Buddhist 
leader in Moscow will not acquire an official character. If he 
holds meeting with any officials this may result in 
complications", he warned. 
  On Thursday sources in the Russian Foreign Ministry said 
Dalai Lama is on a private visit and no official contacts with 
him are planned. Russia views Tibet as an integral part of 
China and treasures relations with that country, according to 
the sources.

  [Text] Moscow May 19 TASS -- "I do not share the view that 
Latin America is far from Russia's foreign policy interests", 
the speaker of the Russian parliament's upper house, the 
Federation Council, said on Thursday. 
  Vladimir Shumeyko met with newsmen ahead of an official 
visit 
by a Federation Council delegation to Latin America, which is 
due to start on Sunday. During the tour, the Russian delegation 
will visit Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela and Ecuador. 
  According to the speaker, Russia can profit considerably by 
using the experience of democratic consolidation in Latin 
American countries. 
  In particular, he said, has gone through processes in its 
development very similar to those underway in Russia, namely a 
transition from early democracy to authoritarian rule, then to 
renewed democracy and market relations. 
  Shumeyko also believes that Argentina has one of the most 
perfect civil codes on peace, which proves to mature democracy 
in this South American country. Apart from this, Argentina has 
already achieved national accord, which Russia is seeking at the 
moment. 
  The present-day Russia is not guided by ideological 
considerations when choosing its partners, the Federation 
Council speaker noted. The main motivation is just mutually 
beneficial contacts. The potential foe such contacts with Latin 
American countries is enormous, and they should be certainly 
stepped up. 
  Shumeyko confirmed his profound respect for Cuban leader 
Fidel Castro. "During my visit to Cuba, I had three-hour talks 
with Fidel, which showed that his assessment of the current 
political and economic situation, as well as of the global 
processes, has very little to do with its interpretation by the 
mass media", the speaker stressed. "Politicians of this level 
should not be spoken about in passing. Fidel Castro is the 
world's property, and I will never go back on my words".

  [Text] The Baltic region problems occupied a significant 
place at the Russian-Finnish summit. Here is what Foreign 
Affairs Minister Andrey Kozyrev told our observer Yuliy Semenov 
and other journalists. 
  [Begin Kozyrev recording] There is to be a meeting in 
Tallinn 
on cooperation between the Baltic Sea states. Finland has given 
us support in implementing our initiative on creating the post 
of commissar for democratic institutions and human rights, 
including the rights of persons belonging to ethnic minorities. 
I have to say that there was a very difficult debate literally 
right up to the last few days, and I was even considering not 
going to this meeting at all unless there was agreement on this 
issue. But now Finland, Finnish diplomacy has taken the part 
of, what I would call, mediator, and has helped to work out a 
compromise that gives this commissar a clear mandate to tackle 
human rights issues in the Baltic states. 
  We discussed in detail the tasks of this regional 
institution 
in general. Lastly, we have expanded bilateral ties; we 
discussed issues of regulating border crossings, in order to 
make such crossings simpler though, of course, controllable. We 
discussed matters relating to regulating the issuing of visas. 
We agreed to speed up the signing of a bilateral agreement on 
this score. One of the basic favorable factors of 
Russian-Finnish relations is the fact that we do not have any 
territorial problems. Neither side has any territorial claims 
on the other. These matters have been fully resolved by 
bilateral agreements and fully dealt under the principles of the 
CSCE. Incidentally, this is one of the issues that we will 
definitely be raising at the meeting of Baltic Sea states, so 
that Latvia and Estonia do not put forward any territorial 
claims. The existing borders are unshakable and, strictly 
speaking, no one with any sense contests them. It is true that 
such claims are being put forward by Estonia, but we are 
counting on assistance, perhaps even from the Finnish side and 
other states, in defending this principle without which 
stability as a whole would simply collapse. 
  We are conducting bilateral talks on the matter of, say, the 
withdrawal of troops and we do not need any mediation here but, 
of course, we value and welcome friendly participation and when 
our Baltic neighbors give sensible advice. As for the problem 
of human rights, including the rights of ethnic minorities, this 
problem is an international one, because we cannot allow double 
standards and the violation of human rights in any country or in 
any region of Europe. This is not a problem for Russia alone. 
It is a problem for everyone. 
  That is why the post of CSCE commissar for the rights of 
ethnic minorities was created who, incidentally, works primarily 
with the Baltic states. And now, to assist this commissar, the 
post of commissar for the Baltic Sea states is to be created. 
We believe that the high standards that have been achieved in 
Finland, Sweden, and other Baltic Sea countries in the human 
rights area and the rights of ethnic minorities should be 
applied in the Baltic states as well. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Pavel Shinkarenko report under the "Visits" rubric: "Boris </F>
Yeltsin and Martti Ahtisaari Have `Coordinated Positions.' The 
Finnish President's First Official Visit to Moscow Ended 
Yesterday"] 
  [Text] At a dinner in honor of the eminent Finnish guest, 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin noted that the present leaders 
of Russia and Finland not only value the positive undertakings 
of their predecessors but also "intend to build on them." It 
was thus stressed that Russo-Finnish relations are a 
"significant factor for stability in northern Europe and the 
Baltic region," and consequently it is necessary to "constantly 
coordinate positions." 
  As ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI has learned, no joint documents were 
signed on the basis of the results of the talks. But the fact 
that President Ahtisaari was accompanied on his trip by a large 
group of Finnish entrepreneurs is indicative. The two 
countries' businessmen did not waste time on protocol matters 
but sought to use the top-level talks to consolidate their 
economic positions in Russia. Especially since both President 
Yeltsin and President Ahtisaari regarded with approval the 
development of direct contacts not only between state 
enterprises but also at the level of private firms. The figures 
are as follows: In 1993 Russo-Finnish trade turnover was more 
than 40 percent up on the previous year and totaled almost $2.5 
billion. Furthermore, cooperation is developing not only at 
state level but also between firms and individual enterprises. 
Finnish companies are showing greatest activeness in Russia's 
border regions -- St. Petersburg, Karelia, and Leningrad and 
Murmansk oblasts. Special energy-saving and rational forestry 
use programs have been prepared for those regions. Projects for 
the development of mobile radio telephone systems, the 
modernization of highways and railroads, ports, and border 
transport crossings are being developed. A program of 
cooperation in the assimilation of oil and gas deposits in the 
northern regions of Russia is justn one of those being prepared. 
  It is to be presumed that President Ahtisaari's visit to 
Moscow and his talks with Boris Yeltsin and Viktor Chernomyrdin 
will give fresh impetus to mutually beneficial cooperation.

  [Text] Kaliningrad May 19 TASS -- Visiting Swedish Foreign 
Minister Margaretha af Ugglas has expressed concern about high 
concentration of Russian troops in the Kaliningrad region, 
Russian enclave bordering on Poland, Lithuania and Estonia. 
  "Kaliningrad may become an important link in developing 
cooperation both in the Baltic Sea region and with Russia," said 
Ugglas, who made a one-day trip across the Kaliningrad region on 
Thursday. 
  Ugglas became the first foreign foreign minister to visit 
the 
region since the Second World War. 
  She met with Yuriy Matochkin, head of the regional 
administration, and held a news conference. She declared for 
constructing a transbaltic highway and some facilities for 
environmental protection here, developing cooperation between 
the twin cities and in the field of arts and science. 
  "Sweden belongs to those countries which strive to involve 
Kaliningrad in practical cooperation between the countries of 
the baltic sea region. I intend to discuss it with Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev in a week's time, at the meeting 
of foreign ministers of the Baltic Sea region in Tallinn," she 
emphasized. 
  According to her, Sweden has alloted two million Swedish 
Kronas to fund an international research into the economy of the 
Kaliningrad region with a view to attracting foreign investments. 
  The Swedish foreign minister left Kaliningrad for Stockholm 
on Thursday.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondents Aleksey Bukalov and </F>
Dmitriy Polunin] 
  [Text] Tirana May 20 TASS -- New democratic Russia, 
committed to the values of freedom and progress, can and should 
play an important role in European politics, conforming to its 
status of a great power, Albanian President Sali Berisha said in 
an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS here on Thursday. 
  "There were different periods in relations between our two 
countries: 'From love to hatred'," the Albanian leader noted. 
Present-day Albanian-Russian relations are based on equality and 
mutual respect. 
  Cooperation between Albania and Russia in the international 
arena is of great importance for the establishment of peace in 
the Balkan region, Berisha stressed. He also favoured broader 
bilateral relations in the economy, politics and culture. 
  Speaking on Thursday at the ceremony of launching a factory 
of the Coca Cola firm in Tirana's suburb, where foreign 
journalists accredited in Rome were invited, the Albanian 
president said of his country's readiness to liberalise the 
economy and invite foreign investments. 
  In the past, legislation forbade the participation of 
foreign 
capital in the Albanian economy. It will now play the key role 
in the country's transition to the market model of development. 
  Albania hopes for an inflow of foreign investments in the 
power industry, agriculture and the food industry as well as in 
the tourist industry. The president noted in this connection 
that his country has rich natural resources and cheap labour. 
  The new course of the Albanian leadership for openness and 
international cooperation offers broad opportunities for the 
development of the national economy, the president continued. 
  This course has opponents inside the country. But the 
overwhelming majority of Albanians support the policy of 
reforms, he added. 
  The Albanian leader also touched on some pressing foreign 
policy issues in his speech. He said that Albania is following 
with great concern the development of the Bosnian conflict, 
advocates the immediate end to combat operations and expresses 
readiness to cooperate closely with the international community 
in a search for a peaceful settlement. 
  The president dwelt at length on Albania's relations with 
neighbouring countries. He pointed to the successful 
development of Italian-Albanian relations and also stressed that 
his country is interested in a stable situation in the Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and seeks normal contacts with 
Greece. 
  Berisha, together with Premier Aleksander Meksi and other 
cabinet members, opened the Coca Cola enterprise built with 
Italian and American assistance. The factory with a capacity of 
16,800 bottles per hour was built for [as received] 80 days. 
  Albania has become 197th country where the Coca Cola company 
puts out its soft beverage.

  Kravchuk said about the need to divide the fleet in line 
with 
the Moscow understandings of 15 April (according to the 
understandings Russia possesses 80 pct of the Fleet and Ukraine 
-- 20 percent). 
  The Ukrainian President voiced the need to attach a special

<F P=106> [Report by UKRINFORM correspondents Viktor Demydenko and </F>
Mykhaylo Melnyk: "Ukraine Is Fulfilling Its Obligations on 
Withdrawing Nuclear Weapons"] 
  [Text] The process of dismantling and transferring 
[nuclear] warheads from Ukraine to Russia is under full control 
and is in conformity with the schedule. As of today [14 May], 
180 warheads have already been transferred to the Russian 
Federation. This was stated today [14 May] by Ukrainian 
President Leonid Kravchuk during the opening of the Kiev Spring 
Fair. 
  "It is no secret for anyone that the nuclear missiles 
deployed on the territory of Ukraine are not controlled by it, 
since the nuclear `button' is in Moscow. Besides, Ukraine has 
never even tried to possess such formidable weapons," continued 
the president. He confirmed Ukraine's intention to fulfill in 
full the "tripartite agreement" signed, at the beginning of this 
year, by the presidents of Ukraine, Russia, and the United 
States. 
  "When we signed the agreement, we hoped that other nuclear 
countries would follow suit and would start disarming," 
continued Leonid Kravchuk. "Today, I have information that, in 
fulfillment of the accords reached during the Moscow meeting, 
the United States, too, intends to destroy, on a very large 
scale, its nuclear arsenals," stated the head of the Ukrainian 
state. 
  According to him, by the end of May, all U.S. missiles aimed 
at Ukraine will be recoded. "Therefore, the time is coming when 
our states actually proceed from words about friendship and 
cooperation to concrete deeds," emphasized Leonid Kravchuk.

<F P=106> [Report by Gennadiy Klyuchikov: "Number of Officers </F>
Decreases, Whereas That of Officers' Unions -- Increases"] 
  [Text] Information has flashed through Russian media about 
a congress of the Officers' Union [SO], held under heightened 
secrecy somewhere in a Moscow suburban area. The main issue on 
the congress agenda was the creation of a network of military 
political structures in the system of power ministries both in 
Russia and other former USSR republics. It addition, it was 
envisioned that this structure would be under the rigid control 
of Moscow. 
  Congress participants, who represented analogous 
organizations in their countries, including Ukraine and the 
Crimea, expressed their wish to transform themselves into 
republican branches of the SO and actively work for the 
restoration of Soviet power in all the Republics of the 
"disintegrated, but not annihilated, USSR." 
  It is known that the SO has a fairly strong position in the 
central apparatus of the Defense Ministries of Russia, Ukraine, 
and Belarus. SO leaders did not hide that they have pertinent 
information from these ministries on what is going on in the 
higher echelons of power, including top-secret documents. 
  The leadership of the Ukraine Officers' Union firmly denies 
any participation by its delegates in this congress. Does this 
mean that another, virtually unknown, officers' union is 
operating in Ukraine's Armed Forces? 
  Our Defense Ministry has seemingly not heard of either the 
SO 
congress or of the participation of Ukrainian Army 
representatives in it. Defense Ministry leadership will have to 
find out who consented to the Ukrainian servicemen's 
participation in the Moscow congress. However, some conclusions 
can be drawn right now. The main conclusion is quite clear: 
The Army is not a place for any unions, since it always tends 
to be politicized and struggling for power, inevitably splitting 
servicemen into "good guys" and "bad guys."

<F P=106> [Report by Taras Petriv: "The European Union Adheres to </F>
Accords, but Sometimes `Slightly Hampers' Their Implementation"] 
  [Text] The Agreement on Partnership and Cooperation 
between Ukraine and the European Union will be signed on the 
island of Corfu during the European Council summit conference on 
24-25 June. Western analysts regard this as a significant step 
of assistance on the part of the European Union to the present 
Ukrainian leadership in implementing economic reforms and as an 
achievement by Ukrainian diplomacy. The visit to our state by 
the deputy chairman of the EC Commission, Commissioner for 
External Economic Issues Sir Leon Britten, has undoubtedly 
contributed to the successful completion of the debates on the 
possibilities and the date for signing the document. Aware of 
his positive attitude toward Ukraine, Ukrainian officials 
eagerly looked forward to his arrival, as they hoped that 
concrete problems would be resolved. However, the road toward 
the signing was not easy, and Britten's negotiations in Kiev 
were far from simple. 
  The "lightening struck" during his talks with L. Kravchuk, 
when they started discussing the possibilities of signing, at 
the highest level, the Agreement on Partnership and Cooperation 
between Ukraine and the European Union. President Kravchuk 
expressed a desire to have this procedure over as soon as 
possible, whereas the EC commissioner hinted that some people in 
Brussels were linking it with Ukraine immediately joining the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. After talks with Minister of 
Foreign Affairs Zlenko, Britten stated that the European 
Community never linked the two issues and promised to make every 
effort to reassure those who were putting forward such demands. 
At the same time, he appealed to the Ukrainian leadership with 
a request to speed up the process of discussion of the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty in parliament. The head of the Ukrainian 
foreign policy department responded to that very sharply and 
stated that such a turn of events had not been expected and 
could be taken advantage of by certain political forces. It 
became clear from what he said that there exists a "third" 
party, which again wants to put Ukraine in a difficult situation 
and again create difficulties for it in the international arena. 
In Zlenko's opinion, it is now important, first of all, to 
fulfill the Ukrainian-U.S.-Russian tripartite statement on 
nuclear weapons. It is worth adding that some people in 
Brussels may have reasoned that the chairman of the EC 
commission had to sign such a historic document with whoever 
would be in power in Ukraine in the future. 
  Britten's meeting with Vice Premier Landyk, Minister of the 
Economy Shpek, and other members of government left more 
optimistic impressions. They said that President Kravchuk would 
appeal to the European Community with a letter on granting 
Ukraine free assistance in food worth 200 million ECU, so that 
our state could sell some of its own agricultural products for 
hard currency and use the resulting money for purchasing the 
means for plant protection. However, one can only hope for any 
assistance if all the obligations are fulfilled. As is known, 
Ukraine was to have paid 4.5 million ECU to the European 
Community by 20 April. This sum is the interest on credit. 
Unfortunately, not only did our state fail to pay the debt, but 
did not even notify Brussels when it would pay it. The 
Ukrainian side accounted for the delay by the difficult 
situation in the agrarian sector: The sowing campaign has ended 
and we are ready to repay the debts. 
  In addition to that, Britten stated that, for political 
reasons, anti-dumping measures against Ukraine cannot be used by 
any means. The European Community can also offer considerable 
assistance in building two power units at the Rivne nuclear 
power station [AES]. For that, Kiev must agree to closing down 
the Chernobyl AES. The Ukrainian ministers outlined a wide 
range of issues where our country may need technological and 
expert assistance and stressed that it is much easier to work 
with the European Community than, for example, with the IMF. 
  The fourth round of talks on the Accord on Partnership and 
Cooperation between Ukraine and the European Community was 
completed very quickly, and then the document was initialed by 
Zlenko and Britten. It is now essential that, once it is signed 
at the highest level, the European Union would agree to conclude 
a so-called provisional accord, which would make it possible, 
even now, to implement the clauses of the principal document, 
without waiting for its time-consuming ratification by all 12 
members of the body.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko, </F>
Mikhail Melnik] 
  [Text] Kiev, 19 May -- "We shall act decisively and 
consistently in the defense of the territorial integrity of 
Ukraine. We shall act within the bounds of the Constitution, of 
our powers, precisely proceeding from the fact that the Crimea 
is a component part of Ukraine, as registered in the 
constitutions of our state and the Republic of Crimea." This 
was stated by President Leonid Kravchuk at a press conference 
today. 
  He dwelt on the latest events in the Crimea when the Supreme 
Soviet of this autonomous republic intends to examine the issue 
of restoring a number of clauses of the Crimea's Constitution in 
the edition of 6 May 1992. In particular, this relates to the 
inclusion of the Crimea in the composition of Ukraine, to dual 
citizenship, the setting up of military formations and others. 
"If the Supreme Soviet of the Crimea adopts these documents, I 
shall immediately submit to the parliament of the Ukraine a 
draft decision on suspending their effect," the President said. 
  "Solving these issues is exclusively within the competence 
of 
the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine," Leonid Kravchuk stressed. 
Ignoring this fundamental situation registered in the law "On 
Demarcation of Powers Between the Bodies of State Power of 
Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea," is fraught with serious 
consequences for those who set foot on that path. 
  "For each society, for each state, there is a pale beyond 
which no one is allowed to step," the president pointed out. 
Those who ignore this, those who are guided by ambitions and by 
other principles, should remember that their actions are 
unlawful. They should know that such actions, will primarily 
have an effect on the entire population of the Crimea. Those 
who, ignoring the existing legislation and international legal 
norms, cause the situation to heat up, will have to answer for 
this. No one will evade the responsibility, regardless of what 
high regalia and powers he might be in cooperation with, the 
head of the Ukrainian state stressed.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 19 May -- "The Ukrainian leadership is 
making attempts to destabilize the situation in the Crimea, 
provoke a conflict, and use it as an excuse for disrupting the 
presidential elections in Ukraine. By doing this, the present 
leadership in Kiev is trying to stay in power," Crimean 
President Yuriy Meshkov said in an exclusive interview with 
ITAR-TASS this evening. 
  According to him, the Ukrainian leadership had made an 
attempt to eliminate presidential power in the Crimea in the 
past, and on 19 May, Leonid Kravchuk by his decrees reorganized 
the Crimean power ministries. These moves by Kiev, Yuriy 
Meshkov thinks, might seriously aggravate the situation in the 
republic. 
  In his opinion, the redeployment and increased activity of 
the Ukrainian Armed Forces units have been noted on the 
peninsula's territory. Thus, on the night of 18 May, an 
aircraft carrying Valentyn Nedryhaylo, the first deputy interior 
minister, and a special purpose group, secretly arrived in 
Simferopol where they attempted to seize the republic's Interior 
Ministry. 
  Yuriy Meshkov said that on 19 May the Crimean Supreme 
Council 
approved the ministers of internal affairs, security service, 
and justice and, in his opinion, this will make it possible to 
guarantee peace and order in the republic. "If need be," he 
said, "we have enough forces and equipment to prevent the 
situation from getting out of control." 
  The Crimean president also said that, in order to guarantee 
stability, he was prepared to accept compromise decisions but 
not at the expense of Crimean statehood. In particular, Yuriy 
Meshkov said, at his request the Supreme Council suspended the 
discussion of restoring the Crimean Constitution of 6 May 1992. 
  Yuriy Meshkov also told ITAR-TASS that he had accepted the 
proposal by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk to send a 
delegation of Crimean deputies to Kiev to discuss issues of 
mutual interest. 
  In the opinion of Yuriy Meshkov, in the evolved situation 
Russia should not allow Ukraine to resort to taking inadequate 
measures against the Republic of Crimea.

<F P=106> ["What is Happening in Crimea?" -- UNIAR headline] </F>
  [Excerpts] Simferopol, 19 May -- [passage omitted: 
Kuznetsov's allegations of attempt to storm Crimean Interior 
Ministry] The press service of the main center for public links 
of the Ukrainian Interior Ministry considers that this is 
"another attempt to deceive the public of Crimea and Ukraine." 
In reality, all that happened was that a commission from 
Ukraine's Interior Ministry headed by Valentyn Nedryhaylo, 
Ukraine's first deputy minister of internal affairs, arrived in 
Crimea. [passage omitted] 
  Because the Crimean side was not informed ahead of time of 
the arrival at 0300 [on 19 May] of the Ukrainian internal 
affairs commission headed by Valentyn Nedryhaylo, who was 
accompanied by 15 "special force [spetsnaz] troops," the 
commission considers that this was a blatant violation. 
Valentyn Nedryhaylo also admitted that representatives of the 
power department acted "rather improperly." But in the words of 
the "spetsnaz" themselves, there was no attempt at an assault. 
  By way of confirmation, Oleksiy Tkach, a representative of 
Ukraine's Interior Ministry press center, demonstrated video 
scenes of all the night's events to representatives of the 
television and radio company "Crimea." 
  It is interesting that after General Kuznetsov's speech at 
the session of the Crimean Supreme Council, deputies appointed 
him minister of internal affairs of the Republic of Crimea.

  [Text] Speaking at the session of the Crimean parliament 
today, Valeriy Kuznetsov, the new interior minister, described 
Kiev's actions as an attempted coup d'etat. 
  In his turn, Vladimir Kryzhanovskiy [Volodymyr 
Kryzhanovskyy], Ukrainian ambassador to Russia, commented on the 
developments in Crimea of last night and today as follows: 
  [Begin Kryzhanovskiy recording] What coup can they be 
talking 
about in the Crimea? A parliamentary session is being held 
there today, it is working calmly and taking decisions which may 
be right, or not quite right, or wrong. You know, special 
purpose troops can be sent to any part of Ukraine at any time -- 
but do I, as an ambassador, need to know about these things? 
Crimea is Ukrainian territory in the same sense as 
Ivano-Frankovsk, or Donetsk, or Zhitomir, or Odessa. All right, 
supposing special troops did go there -- so what? Do you think 
I am very much concerned about the movement of a mere 10 or 15 
servicemen from the special troops around Ukraine? All is quiet 
in Ukraine, a session is in progress in Crimea -- so what coup 
d'etat are we talking about? [end recording]

<F P=106> [Announcer-read statement by the Ukrainian Defense Ministry; </F>
passages within quotation marks spoken in Russian] 
  [Text] We will begin with a statement by the Ukrainian 
Defense Ministry Press Service. 
  The world public has again been misled, reads the statement. 
Again referring to a "source close to the Black Sea Fleet 
headquarters," I read the original, ITAR-TASS circulated 
misinformation on 19 May as if 1,000 special purpose troops from 
the Ukrainian armed forces have arrived on the territory of 
Crimea over the last 24 hours. The same "source" reported the 
concentration of 300 Ukrainian servicemen in the vicinity of 
Sevastopol. 
  The Ukrainian Defense Ministry Press Service declares that 
this statement is a provocative lie, evidently aimed at 
aggravating the political situation on the peninsula, which is 
tense even without this, to the limit and provoking yet another 
splash of anti-Ukrainian hysteria. 
  As earlier, the familiar special propaganda methods of the 
Black Sea Fleet Press Center, which is carrying out open 
subversive activities on the territory of the sovereign state -- 
Ukraine, can be seen through these malicious falsehoods. 
Obviously, there are forces standing behind these vain 
attempts, who are used to cheap populist tricks of the 
totalitarianism times, and who use them to slander our state in 
the eyes of the world public and sow mistrust among the peoples 
of Ukraine. 
  I would like to remind you that this was a statement by the 
Ukrainian Defense Ministry Press Service.

  [Text] Oleksandr Yemets, Ukraine's minister for 
nationalities and migration, believes that Ukraine and Crimea 
could find a "common language" were it not for the interference 
of external forces. Speaking in an interview with 
Interfax-Ukraine Thursday the minister, who is in Simferopol, 
also said that it was impossible to predict the influence of 
external forces on the Crimean leadership. 
  Yemets linked the activities of Russian politicians in 
Crimea 
with the fact that "certain Moscow groupings want to control the 
privatization process in Crimea." 
  Yemets said that threats to the constitution and the 
territorial integrity of Ukraine "will also cause us to react 
firmly." 
  "No-one will solve Crimea's problem by political 
adventurism," he said. 
  Yemets stressed that if Ukrainian property or Ukrainian 
citizens in Crimea were threatened by any kind of force, then 
"force will be answered by force."

  [Text] The FRANCE PRESSE AGENCY has reported, quoting 
sources in the Ukrainian president's entourage, that Leonid 
Kravchuk is planning to introduce direct presidential rule in 
the Crimea. However, the final decision will depend on the 
consultations currently held between Russia, Ukraine, the United 
States, and Crimean authorities. The consultations began after 
more than 1,000 Ukrainian servicemen were sent to the peninsula 
last night. 
  The Ukrainian Interior Ministry today denied the report that 
the troops had been brought in but confirmed the fact that the 
Crimean Interior Ministry had been transformed into the Crimean 
Directorate for Internal Affairs of Ukraine, and that Colonel 
Vladimir Chernyshov had been appointed its head.

  [Text] The state of emergency may be introduced in Crimea 
only by the Ukrainian parliament, head of the Ukrainian 
president's internal-policy service Nikolay Mikhalchenko told 
INTERFAX-UKRAINE. 
  He also said that "as the guarantor of the Ukrainian 
Constitution, the president will act within the limits of his 
powers." 
  He stated that the Crimean authorities had interpreted the 
attempts to find a compromise and work constructively as a sign 
of Ukraine's weakness. 
  "Today, we are responding, perhaps with a delay, to the 
extremist moves by certain Crimean political quarters," he said. 
  He laid the responsibility for a possible conflict on the 
central Crimean authorities who, he said, are pushing Crimea to 
the conflict. 
  He also denied the reports about the landing of additional 
Ukrainian forces in Crimea and about an attempted seizure of the 
Crimean Interior Ministry. 
  "We did and do act in strict accordance with the 
Constitution, but our patience may come to an end," he said. 
  On 20 May, the Crimean parliament intended to adopt a 
resolution on restoring the Crimean Constitution adopted on 6 
May 1992, which said that relations between Crimea and Ukraine 
shall be regulated by agreements. Presently, Crimean-Ukrainian 
relations are based on the Ukrainian law on the delimitation of 
powers between the Ukrainian and Crimean authorities.

Interfax-Ukraine today. He emphasized that the RUKH definitely 
stood for restoration of lawfulness and preservation of the 
territorial integrity of Ukraine. He suggested that Ukrainian 
President Leonid Kravchuk must assume control over the Crimean 
power structures rather than be waiting. 
  Ukrainian Peasant Party leader Sergey Dovgan announced to 
Interfax-Ukraine that a Ukrainian parliamentary delegation had 
left for Crimea. "We hope they will manage to persuade Crimean 
deputies to make more weighed decisions," he said. 
  The Agrarian parliamentary faction speaks in favor of talks 
on Crimean issue, Dovgan stressed. However, he added that these 
issues must be resolved on the basis of the Ukrainian 
constitution. 
  A leader of the UNA-UNSO (the Ukrainian National Assembly -- 
the Ukrainian National Self-Defense) ultra-nationalist 
organization Oleg Vitovich told Interfax he gave his complete 
backing to representatives of the Ukrainian organizations 
picketing the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet and demanding to annul 
the autonomy of Crimea. 
  Vitovich suggested that the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet must 
assess the activities of the president and the former 
composition of the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet which had led to the 
present situation in the Ukrainian-Crimean relations. He 
believes that the Crimean problems should be solved in Crimea 
rather than in Kiev.

  [Text] Kiev, 19 May -- By today's decrees Ukrainian 
President Leonid Kravchuk has reorganized the power ministries 
[defense, interior, and internal affairs] of the Republic of 
Crimea, despite the fact that he does not have a constitutional 
right to do so. 
  Main directorates will be set up on the basis of the 
Ukrainian Security Service and the Interior Ministry. They will 
be subordinated directly to the Ukrainian Security Service 
chairman and the Ukrainian Interior Minister. Administrative 
and service premises, armaments, means of transport, and 
property which in the past were used by the Security Service and 
the Interior Ministry of the Republic of Crimea are being handed 
over to them. 
  Major General Ivan Kolomitsev has been appointed by Leonid 
Kravchuk as chief of the main directorate of the Ukrainian 
security service in Crimea. 
  ITAR-TASS has learned that by decision of the Cabinet of 
Ministers, an additional post of deputy minister and chief of 
the Main Directorate of Internal Affairs in the Crimea has been 
introduced onto the staff of the central apparatus of the 
Ukrainian Interior Ministry. Militia Colonel Valeriy Chernyshov 
has been appointed to this post. 
  By decree of the Ukrainian president, the Ministry of 
Justice 
of the Republic of Crimea has also been reorganized into the 
main directorate of justice in the Crimea. From now on it will 
be subordinate to the Ukrainian Ministry of Justice.

  [Text] The new Crimean Supreme Council has taken yet 
another step toward deterioration of relations with official 
Kiev. At its session yesterday, the Crimean legislature 
approved, with a majority of votes, the nomination of General 
Lepikhov, who was nominated by [Crimean] President Yuriy 
Meshkov, as chief of the Crimean Security Service. In this way, 
it ignored the decree issued by Ukrainian President Kravchuk 
reorganizing the Crimean Republic Security Service and the 
Ukrainian Security Service [SBU] General Department in the 
Crimea. The SBU press service in Kiev emphasizes that the main 
goal of the reorganization is to increase centralization of the 
service leadership and the effectiveness of its fight against 
organized crime in the Crimea, where it is assuming more and 
more dangerous forms. 
  Through the NOVYNY television and radio agency, the press 
service also reports that Crimean President Meshkov has 
practically ignored a wire sent to him by SBU Chief Yevhen 
Marchuk. The wire informs him that the SBU General Department 
in the Crimea, established in accordance with Leonid Kravchuk's 
decree, shall remain unchanged, in terms of its function, staff, 
and number. 
  The press service also reports that SBU First Deputy Chief 
Valeriy Malikov is currently in Simferopol with a group of SBU 
workers. They are preparing materials concerning the fight 
against organized crime in the Crimea, which will be examined at 
the next meeting of the SBU Collegium.

  [Text] The Crimean Republic Supreme Council has taken 
another step towards exacerbating relations with official Kiev. 
By a majority vote at its session on 19 May, it approved the 
appointment of General [Volodymyr] Lepikhov to the post of 
chairman of the autonomy's security service. He was nominated 
by President Yuriy Meshkov. The directive on reorganizing the 
Security Service of the Republic of Crimea into the Security 
Service of Ukraine Main Directorate in Crimea, signed by 
Ukrainian Head of State Leonid Kravchuk, has thus been ignored. 
  The [Security Service of Ukraine] press service in Kiev 
emphasizes that the principal aim of the reorganization is the 
need to enhance the centralization of leadership and the 
effectiveness of this service in fighting organized crime in 
Crimea where the scale of it is ever more threatening. 
  The press service at the same time reports via the TV and 
radio agency Novyny [News] that Crimean President Meshkov has 
effectively ignored (?a coded telegram addressed to him) from 
Yevhen Marchuk, head of the Security Service of Ukraine, where 
he is informed that the Security Service of Ukraine Main 
Directorate in Crimea, set up in accordance with Leonid 
Kravchuk's directive, is to remain unchanged in performing its 
functions (?in order to retain effectiveness). 
  The press service also reports that (Valeriy Malikov), 
Security Service of Ukraine first deputy chairman, and a number 
of his staff are now in Simferopol. They are preparing materials 
on the situation with fighting organized crime in Crimea, which 
will be under consideration at the (?next) sitting of the 
Security Service of Ukraine Collegium.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS and UKRINFORM correspondents] </F>
  [Text] Simferopol/Kiev/Moscow May 19 TASS -- The Crimean 
parliament postponed on Thursday the scheduled vote on 
reintroducing items of a 1992 draft constitution of the Crimean 
Republic which envisaged greater autonomy of the republic from 
Kiev. 
  The decision was taken upon the demand of Crimean President 
Yuriy Meshkov. Later, the president presented his explanations 
for the postponement of the vote to a parliament closed-doors 
meeting. Earlier Meshkov had been repeatedly calling on the 
lawmakers "not to heighten temperature" on the peninsula. 
  Amid mounting tension in the Crimea, Ukrainian President 
Leonid Kravchuk disbanded on Thursday law enforcement ministries 
of the self-style peninsula republic. 
  According to a presidential decree which was signed on 
Thursday, Crimea's Interior Ministry was reorganised into a 
department of the Interior Ministry of Ukraine directly 
subordinated to Kiev. 
  Thus all local police forces with their premises, weapons, 
transport means and other property were made responsible only to 
Kiev. 
  Similar decrees have put under Kiev's control, Crimean 
Security Service and Ministry of Justice making bringing their 
status down to that of departments of respective Ukrainian 
ministries. 
  By these decrees Kravchuk also appointed heads of the 
aforesaid departments. 
  The regional parliament fired back and formally confirmed 
the 
appointment of Valeriy Kuznetsov full-fledged interior minister 
of the Crimea. Earlier he was appointed to the post by Crimean 
President Yuriy Meshkov. 
  Earlier today the Crimea-based Black Sea Fleet reported that 
for the past 24 hours some 1,000 Ukrainian home guards and 
special forces had been dispatched to the Crimea including a 
group of saboteurs now deployed close to Sevastopol, the main 
base of the Black Sea Fleet. 
  In his angry message the Ukrainian president today warned 
the 
Crimean parliament against "the revision of basic principles of 
relations between Ukraine and its integral part -- the Republic 
of Crimea". "The violation of these principles might lead to 
conflict situations and other unpredictable consequences", 
Kravchuk stressed. 
  The Ukrainian president was even more resolute in his 
telephone conversation with President Boris Yeltsin that took 
place later in the day. 
  The Ukrainian president's press service quoted him as saying 
that "Ukraine would take appropriate measures to preserve 
territorial integrity of the state". 
  The Crimean parliament at its closed-doors meeting decided 
to 
postpone until Friday the discussion on reintroducing items of a 
1992 draft constitution of the Crimean Republic which envisaged 
greater autonomy of the republic from Kiev. 
  The lawmakers voted against a proposal to send a delegation 
to Kiev for negotiations with Ukraine's leadership. 
  In retaliation to President Kravchuk's decrees bringing 
Crimean law enforcement bodies under direct control of Kiev, the 
lawmakers appointed Vladimir Lepikhov chairman of the Crimean 
Security Service, and Lyubov Yeliseyeva-Bora minister of justice.

  [Text] We are continuing to follow events in Crimea with 
great attention. The Crimean Supreme Soviet is continung its 
work in Simferopol. Our correspondent Yevgeniy Novikov reports. 
  [Novikov] At the morning session the deputies were addressed 
by Viktor Mirak, deputy chairman of the Crimean Supreme Soviet. 
He said that during the night of 19-20 May there was a 
telephone conversation between [Crimean President] Yuriy Meshkov 
and Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk. Viktor Mirak said that 
no mutual understanding was reached during the conversation. 
Therefore, Yuriy Meshkov asked that the deputies be told that at 
the session it would be expedient to continue discussion of the 
question of restoring the 6 May 1992 Crimean Constitution. 
Meshkov, himself, is not present at the session. According to 
some reports the Crimean president is on a visit to the Kuban 
[Russia's Krasnodar region]. 
  After hearing Viktor Mirak's report, the deputies began 
discussing the question of restoring the Crimean Constitution. 
The Crimean Tatars group announced that it would not take part 
in the voting on restoration of the Crimean Constitution, giving 
as their reasons that this could exacerbate relations with 
Ukraine. Nevertheless, the 1992 Crimean Constitution was 
restored by a majority vote. This Constitution declares the 
Republic of Crimea as an autonomous state constructing its 
relations with Ukraine on the basis of treaties and agreements. 
This decision by the deputies caused a storm of applause from a 
well-attended rally taking place outside the Crimean Supreme 
Soviet building. 
  After a break for dinner, the session will continue its 
work. 
  [Announcer] I would add that a message from Ukrainian 
President Leonid Kravchuk was read at the session. In the 
message the head of state demanded that the Crimean deputies 
should unconditionally implement the provisions of the Ukrainian 
law on delimitation of powers between the bodies of state power 
of Ukraine and the Crimean Republic.

  [Text] Today's session of the Crimean parliament adopted a 
law restoring the Constitution of 6 May 1992, INTERFAX reports. 
This Constitution envisions that the legal basis of relations 
between Ukraine and Crimea will be a treaty. It also stipulates 
that inhabitants of the peninsula are entitled to dual 
citizenship. 
  As has already been reported, Ukraine's President Leonid 
Kravchuk earlier warned that if the Crimean Supreme Soviet 
restores the Constitution, he will immediately ask the Ukrainian 
parliament to suspend the decision.

  [Text] Intensive consultations are under way in Kiev 
following the Crimean parliament's decision to reinstate the 
republic's constitution of May 6, 1992, presidential spokesman 
Nikolay Mikhalchenko told Interfax-Ukraine. 
  "President Kravchuk and Speaker of Parliament Aleksandr 
Moroz 
are meeting to discuss the issue and I hope the president will 
address the deputies today," he said. 
  On Wednesday, Kravchuk said that if Simferopol took a 
decision to bring back its constitution, he would ask the 
Ukrainian parliament to rescind it. 
  Mikhalchenko said that Simferopol's decision was out of line 
with the Ukrainian basic law and therefore, illegal. "The 
decision would lead to the setting up of a confederation in 
Ukraine which is a unitary state," he said.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 20 TASS -- The parliament of the Crimea, 
an autonomous republic of Ukraine, voted on Friday to restore 
the Crimean Constitution of May 6, 1992. Votes against it were 
cast only by 14 deputies from the Crimean Tatars," ITAR-TASS has 
learned by telephone from Petr Chernyakevich, the Crimean 
president's aide for military affairs. [no opening quotation 
marks as received] 
  Chernyakevich described the parliament's decision to restore 
the 1992 Constitution as a correct step. "If this decision had 
been blackballed," Chernyakevich said, "the Ukrainian president 
would have obtained additional means to influence the situation 
on the peninsula." 
  Speaking about the current situation in the Crimea, 
Chernyakevich noted that it was on the whole tranquil. In his 
opinion, this was largely due to the mass media, which drew 
public attention to Ukraine's recent steps, which could have 
destabilised the situation in the Crimea. 
  At the same time, Chernyakevich noted that movements and 
redeployment of Ukrainian troops were spotted on the border with 
the Crimean republic. It is reported that the Ukrainians are 
setting up field hospitals and are trying to place Crimean 
defence units under the control of the Ukrainian National Guard. 
  Chernyakevich also expressed anxiety about the Ukrainian 
president's decree to reorganise the Crimean ministries for 
internal affairs, security and justice into departments 
subordinated to the central Ukrainian ministries.

  [Text] Sevastopol, Ukraine, May 20 (AFP) -- The Black Sea 
Fleet, shared between the Ukraine and Russia, threatened Friday 
[20 May] to intervene in Crimea after the region's parliament 
adopted a new constitution effectively declaring independence 
from Kiev. 
  "It is clear that whatever the development of the situation, 
the Black Sea Fleet cannot remain outside events unfolding 
around it," the Fleet's Press Office said in a statement.

<F P=106> [Report by Viktor Yadukha from Sevastopol in "Crimea" </F>
column: "Ukraine Is Getting Ready To Make War" -- two last 
paragraphs are report by Pavel Felgengauer] 
  [Text] In spite of denials by the Ukraine Defense Ministry 
and the Navy Press Center, on 19 May in a conversation with 
SEGONDYA's correspondent a high-ranking officer at the Black Sea 
Fleet headquarters confirmed information about the landing near 
Sevastopol of Ukrainian Special Force and National Guard units 
with a total strength of approximately 1,000 men. 
  The troops were landed in two groups at the Belbek and Cape 
Khersones airfields, whereupon they were assigned to Ukraine 
Navy units. The officer advised that in Kherson Oblast, in the 
village of Chernobayevka, a Ukraine military field hospital has 
been set up. whose personnel are making no secret that they are 
getting ready to receive casualties with bullet and 
fragmentation wounds. 
  Furthermore, Ukrainian troops are being concentrated around 
the city of Izmail where a Black Sea Fleet brigade of combat 
boats is located. According to unconfirmed reports, the 
storming of the unit has been set for 25 May. 
  From 18 to 22 May the Black Sea Fleet command is holding 
"scheduled" -- the word the Navy Press Center makes a point of 
emphasizing -- exercises. They involve more than 20 battleships 
and submarines, aircraft, helicopters, and fleet coast 
installations. 
  On Thursday a session of the Crimean parliament heard Acting 
Internal Affairs Minister Maj.-Gen. Valeriy Kuznetsov announce 
that on the morning of 19 May a detachment of the Ukraine 
Special Forces, under the command of Ukrainian First Deputy 
Interior Minister Nidrigaylo, attacked the Interior Ministry 
headquarters in Simpferopol. Crimean militia forces managed to 
repulse the attack. Prior to that President Kravchuk issued an 
order transforming the Crimean Interior Ministry into a regional 
directorate of Ukraine's Interior Ministry, including a new 
post: "deputy minister -- chief of the Crimea Directorate." 
  Local parliament deputies believe that military preparations 
in Sevastopol, Izmail, and Simferopol are elements of an overall 
plan to destabilize the situation on the peninsula. Political 
observers suppose that an armed confrontation on the peninsula 
could become a pretext for postponing or cancelling presidential 
elections in Ukraine which bode no good to its present 
leadership. 
  According to some reports, Thursday's closed session of the 
Crimean parliament considered the question of introducing a 
state of emergency on the peninsula. 
  Sources in the Defense Ministry in Moscow confirmed to 
SEGODNYA's correspondent that the 1st Ukrainian Mobile Air 
Brigade, created on the basis of the 98th Paratroopers Brigade, 
part of which was evacuated to Russia, is, according to 
intelligence reports, "making preparations" for a possible 
seizure of a river vessel (craft) brigade in Izmail. Mobile Air 
Brigade servicemen earlier took part in the seizure of a ship 
division in Odessa. 
  The Ukrainian Mobile Air Brigade is located in Bolgrad and 
could be moved to Izmail within several hours. The command of 
the river vessel brigade has been "warned about a coming 
provocation" and, if necessary, could obviously offer resistance.

  [Text] On Friday the Crimean parliament adopted a 
resolution under which all residents of the republic of draft 
age should pass military service in the army on the territory of 
the peninsula. Deputies also decided to suspend sending draftees 
out of Crimea and to draft them for serving in Crimea and in 
Black Sea Fleet units. 
  At the same time the Crimean parliament ordered the military 
commissar of Crimea, Volkov, to fulfill this resolution. 
However, Volkov said at the session that he would not be able 
to fulfill the resolution because he is subordinate directly to 
Commander-in-Chief, Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk. Volkov 
also said that "it is impossible to have all draftees stay in 
Crimea." 
  In the meantime, Vice Commander of the Black Sea Fleet, 
deputy Aleksandr Frolov said at the session that "the commander 
is ready to receive all draftees from the Republic of Crimea." 
  On the same day the republic's parliament formed a 
delegation 
which will leave for Kiev in a few days for talks on the return 
to the first version of the Crimean Constitution of May 6, 1992. 
The delegation is led by Chairman of the Crimean parliament 
Sergey Tsekov. The delegation includes, Refat Chubarov, one of 
the leaders of the Crimean Tatars and the faction Kurultay of 
the Crimean Tatars in the Crimean parliament.

  [Text] Simferopol -- The session of the Crimean Supreme 
Council continued its work on 20 May. At the morning sitting, 
Leonid Hrach, Communist Party of Crimea first secretary, made a 
speech in which he called on deputies to "maintain common sense 
and not unleash a military conflict." However, deputies decided 
to renew the text of the 6 May 1992 version of the Republic of 
Crimea constitution (69 deputies voted in favor and 2 
abstained). In accordance with the text of the constitution, 
mutual relations between the Republic of Crimea and Ukraine 
should be built on the basis of agreements and treaties. The 
constitution also mentions dual citizenship and creating Crimean 
military formations. 
  Before the vote, the Crimean Tatar Kurultay's [congress] 
group announced it would not take part in the voting. People's 
Deputy Oleksandr Kruhlov, leader of the Sevastopol branch of the 
National Salvation Front of Russia, promised "in the event of a 
military conflict, 80,000 Kuban cossacks would defend the 
Crimean constitution." 
  As Vyacheslav Lebedyev, the Crimean president's press 
secretary, said Yuriy Meshkov and acting Minister of State 
Affairs Viktor Minin flew to Krasnodarskiy Kray at 8.30 "in 
connection with the recent signing in Moscow of an 
intergovernmental agreement between the Republic of Crimea and 
the Russian Federation." It is expected that Yuriy Meshkov will 
return to take part in the parliament's work in the second half 
of the day. 
  General Valeriy Kuznetsov, Crimea minister of internal 
affairs of the republic -- appointed on 19 May by the parliament 
-- reported to an UNIAN correspondent, "the situation on the 
peninsula is quiet, the employees of the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs of Crimea are fulfilling the duties they are charged 
with." According to him, Colonel Valeriy Chernyshov, chief of 
the Main Directorate of Internal Affairs in Crimea under the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine -- appointed by Leonid 
Kravchuk's decree -- is now in Simferopol, "and if he wishes to 
visit the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Crimea, we shall let 
him in. However, he does not command anyone and the fulfillment 
of the duties he was charged with by the president of Ukraine is 
out of the question." 
  The deputies to the Crimean parliament elected a 
plenipotentiary commission to hold negotiations with the Supreme 
Council, the Cabinet of Ministers, and the president of Ukraine, 
consisting of Serhiy Tsekov, chairman of the Supreme Council; 
Serhiy Nikulin, chairman of the commission for legislation; 
Refat Chubarov, chairman of the Kurultay group; Deputies 
Volodymyr Klychnykov, Yuriy Podkopayev, and others. 
  Commenting at UNIAN's request on the developments at the 
Supreme Council of Crimea, Leonid Hrach, chairman of the 
Communist Party of the Republic of Crimea, said after such steps 
by the Crimean parliament, Ukraine has all grounds to take any 
measures. "I hope the Supreme Council of Ukraine will show 
political wisdom and will become a balance between the emotions 
and the legal space which exists in Ukraine and in Crimea," he 
said. 
  Commenting on the report on the concentration of Spetsnaz 
[special-purpose forces] in Crimea issued by the TV company 
Ostankino, Valeriy Kuznetsov, Crimean internal affairs minister, 
said there were around 60,000 Ukrainian servicemen on the 
peninsula and therefore Ostankino's data were correct. 
  Interviewed by a UNIAN correspondent, Mykola Mykhalchenko, 
official in charge of domestic policy issues at the Ukrainian 
presidential service, stated: "The Ukrainian president's 
position is this: There is a boundary, which can be maintained 
by the central leadership of Ukraine, and it may not be 
overstepped." In Mykola Mykhalchenko's view, actions by the 
parliament of Crimea overstep the boundary of common sense "and 
one has to take the path of compliance with the constitution 
across the whole of Ukraine's territory." Also, he does not 
rule out that in the very near future a Ukrainian presidential 
directive or appropriate actions by the parliament of Ukraine as 
a reaction to the [Crimean parliament's] anticonstitutional 
decision can be expected. 
  In an interview with a UNIAN correspondent during a break in 
the work of the Supreme Council of Ukraine, Ukrainian Acting 
Prime Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy stated: "I think we now must 
turn to economic sanctions against Crimea. The republic is in 
debt to Ukraine, up to date owing over 1.5 trillion karbovantsi. 
We must turn to sanctions like those used by Russia against 
Ukraine. We have enough levers such as, for example, the supply 
of water and electricity." Yukhym Zvyahilskyy said the 
government was now working on appropriate steps. "I would not 
call it an ultimatum. This is a tougher approach to our 
relations", added Yukhym Zvyahilskyy.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko and Mikhail </F>
Melnik] 
  [Text] Kiev May 19 TASS -- "When electing Aleksandr Moroz 
chairman of the supreme soviet of Ukraine, deputies were guided, 
in my view, not only by political considerations but also by 
their own opinion of the personality of the contender", 
President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine said in reply to a question 
by ITAR-TASS about his attitude towards Wednesday elections. 
  During four years of work in the previous composition of the 
supreme soviet, Aleksandr Moroz was taking an active position in 
the parliament, had his own point of view on political, economic 
and legal problems of current life and upheld them quietly and 
with good reasoning, the president noted. 
  "I do not remember a case when he offended someone in the 
heat of a debate or showed haste in making decisions. By having 
elected Aleksandr Moroz deputies hope that he will be able to 
unite all of them for constructive work," Leonid Kravchuk 
pointed out. 
  "For me this is also a determining factor. We may have 
unlike and even quite different viewpoints on processes of 
social life but the main thing for us is Ukraine with its 52 
million population. We will be guided by these considerations 
in the future," the Ukrainian president stressed. 
  Leonid Kravchuk expressed the hope for fruitful cooperation 
with the new head of the parliament. "If a man has no vanity but 
has self-control, his own stand and appropriate culture, it is 
always possible to find common ground with him," the Ukrainian 
president noted.

  [Excerpts] Kiev [no date as received] -- UNIAN has already 
reported that on 18 May Oleksandr Moroz was elected chairman of 
the Supreme Council of Ukraine by a majority vote. [passage 
omitted] 
  A UNIAN correspondent asked people's deputies to comment on 
the result of the ballot: 
  Volodymyr Lanovyy of the "Reforms" group: "This is just the 
first stage. Let us wait for the election of 112 people's 
deputies. It is also possible that parliamentary activity will 
be paralyzed by the formation of a government from the body of 
people's deputies. Apart from that, Oleksandr Moroz only won by 
a few votes. I hope the final stage of the parliamentary 
election will change the situation, because everything will be 
decided today by the communist majority rather than by Oleksandr 
Moroz." 
  Mykhaylo Pavlovskyy from the "Statehood" group, who once put 
himself forward for the post of Supreme Council chairman but 
withdrew his candidacy: "I am an optimist. That is why I think 
one should search for the way out of any situation. There is no 
tragedy, although the result is not what we had hoped. One 
should work constructively." 
  Vyacheslav Chornovil of the People's Movement of Ukraine 
group: "Had I known earlier than today about behind-the-scenes 
games by [President] Leonid Kravchuk, who could get rid of his 
competitor in the presidential election, the forecasts made 
could have been different. I consider the result of the 
election to be a national tragicomedy. 
  Yuriy Buzduhan, a leader of the Social Democratic Party of 
Ukraine, who on principle did not join any of the groups: 
"Compared with the former Supreme Council, this is a step 
forward. Why? Because the majority in parliament came to power 
legitimately and, naturally, will take responsibility for its 
actions. The future will show to what extent the people of 
Ukraine were sensible in electing this deputy and this Supreme 
Council chairman. I believe Oleksandr Moroz will be a 
consolidating force, and this will be his most difficult task. 
I do not rule out the possibility of him asking Vyacheslav 
Chornovil to be his deputy." 
  Stepan Khmara, chairman of the Ukrainian Conservative 
[Republican] Party, who is not a member of any group: "One has 
once again to admit that the national democrats made a mistake, 
were defeated, pushed aside, lost their moral prestige, and let 
the old cadre stay in power."

  [Text] INTERFAX-Ukraine has been informed that Ukraine's 
new parliament speaker Aleksandr Moroz said at consultations 
with representatives of parliamentary fractions and deputy 
groups on 18 May that he may consider the proposal to postpone 
presidential elections in the Republic if President Kravchuk 
made the corresponding legislative initiative. 
  Moroz, the leader of the Socialist Party, was elected 
speaker 
of the new parliament Wednesday [18 May]. He was also 
registered as a candidate for the presidency at the elections 
due 26 June. 
  He assured journalists that his running for the presidential 
elections, "if they take place, will not have any bearing on his 
work in parliament." 
  Moroz has repeatedly insisted that the elections be held on 
26 June and on no other date. However, he told a May Day 
demonstration that the Ukrainian president could be elected by 
the parliament. 
  Moroz believes that the supreme executive body in the 
republic ought to be the cabinet of ministers and that the 
president should be the head of state. 
  He told deputies after being elected speaker that his main 
position was the "independence for Ukraine and the building of a 
Ukrainian state." "The one thing that unites us is Ukraine 
itself," he stated. 
  In an interview with journalists, Moroz called for "order in 
relations governing ownership" to be imposed, complaining that 
those relations were currently "verging on the criminal." "I 
support the most radical measures in that respect," he said.

  [Text] Thursday's evening session of the Ukrainian 
parliament failed to take place because around 120 deputies 
refused to register. 
  The deputies, who came from the Rukh, Statehood, Unity and 
center fractions, were protesting the offer of the post of 
deputy speaker to Aleksandr Tkachenko. 
  The left wing Ukrainian Peasants' Party nominated Tkachenko, 
a former agriculture minister, for the post. 
  Rukh leader Vyacheslav Chornovil appealed for deputies not 
to 
register and confer among fractions on their own candidates for 
deputy speaker. 
  The speaker himself, Aleksandr Moroz, said he would give the 
media a list of the names of the deputies who had refused to 
register for the session. Those deputies, he said, were 
obstructing "constructive" work in parliament. 
  Communist leader Petr Simonenko in an interview with 
Interfax 
Ukraine criticized the national democrats, saying that "we have 
come to parliament to work and they are getting in our way." 
  The rebel deputies meeting Thursday evening must present 
their candidates for the post of deputy speaker by Friday's 
morning session of the Supreme Soviet.

  [Text] Kiev [no date as received] -- The press service of 
Ukraine's Economy Ministry stated yesterday that reports of 
considerable consumer goods and services retail price and tariff 
rises, to be expected in May or June of this year, have appeared 
recently in some of the mass media. Interviews and statements 
on this are making purposeful references to a draft resolution 
that allegedly has already been drawn up by the ministry, the 
adoption of which would lead to a new round of inflation and a 
fall in the population's living standards. 
  The press service of Ukraine's Economy Ministry states in 
connection with this that no plan of general retail price and 
tariff rises has been developed. On the contrary, the 
government's moves to stabilize the economy have resulted in 
reducing inflation from 90 percent in December of last year to 
six percent in April of this year. Approximately the same level 
of inflation has been forecast for May. Of course, 
insignificant fluctuations in retail prices as a result of this 
or that factor are not ruled out. Ministry of Economy 
specialists expect, for example, that tariffs on city 
transportation services may rise, which will have to be approved 
by local authorities.

deterioration of the people's living standards. The press

  [Text] "We must gain access to the world arms market," 
Chief of the [Ukrainian] Armaments Staff Lieutenant General Lev 
Gnatenko [Ihnatenko] stated ruing a briefing in Kiev on 
Wednesday [18 May]. He said that Ukraine might sell air to air 
missiles, radars, guidance and automatic fire control systems 
and armored equipment. 
  Gnatenko also said that six months ago, the Ukrainian 
Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations established an agency 
(Ukroboronservis) dealing with the arms issues. It has 
established contacts with a similar agency in Russia 
(Rosvooruzheniye) and is currently coordinating prices on 
military equipment manufactured in both countries. 
  To quote Gnatenko, there is a state arms development program 
to last until the year 2010 providing for the creation of a 
network of research centers. He said that whereas the former 
Soviet Union had about 40 research institutes working on arms 
projects, Russia has 37 now and Ukraine none, although research 
centers are attached to many of the former defense enterprises. 
  He told journalists that in 1995-96, Ukraine would put on 
orbit a satellite of its own. 
  Speaking about arms production Gnatenko said that Ukraine 
has 
built or nearly built 10 warships. 
  He also announced that a program was being developed for the 
production of firearms at five Ukrainian factories, including 
the Kiev Machine-Building Plant and the Dnepropetrovsk Yuzhnyy 
Machine- Building Plant, the latter will manufacture firearms on 
the basis of the Kalashnikov sub-machine-gun and the former 
firearms of its own design. 
  He complained that the budget spending on armaments and 
components was insufficient. In 1994, only 8 percent of the 
required money was allocated for this purpose. 
  He said in this connection that Ukraine had had talks with 
Russia on selling about 40 strategic bombers in exchange for 
space parts for individual types of armaments and maintenance 
services.

  [Text] Kiev [no date as received] -- Lieutenant General Lev 
Ihnatenko, chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces' armaments staff, 
told a briefing for journalists on 18 May that, in compliance 
with accords on the withdrawal of nuclear weapons from the 
territory of Ukraine, it is planned to send 200 nuclear warheads 
to Russia this year. Thus far, he said, 180 nuclear warheads 
have already been removed. As for the future destiny of 
strategic bombers, with 42 heavy bomber aircraft remaining on 
the territory of Ukraine -- 19 Tu-160's and 23 Tu-95M's -- the 
lieutenant general stressed that in exchange for the transfer of 
these aircraft to Russia, Ukraine would like to be able to have 
other aircraft of the Ukrainian Armed Forces technically 
maintained and spare parts supplied for various weapons systems. 
A settlement of this issue by the Russian side is forthcoming. 
  Lev Ihnatenko also noted that although only 25 percent of 
the 
research and development institutions's requirements have been 
met, work on the creation of up-to-date armaments systems, 
including precision weapons, is continuing.

  [Text] Crimea, Kiev, 19 May -- "In conditions when the 
informational and organizational-parliamentary aggression by 
Russia in Crimea is being continued, we deem it necessary to 
stop the transfer of nuclear weapons from the territory of 
Ukraine," says the appeal of the People's Movement of Ukraine 
(Rukh). Further on the document states that the desire to drag 
through the Supreme Council of Crimea the Constitution of 6 May 
1992, separate citizenship of Crimea and the dual citizenship as 
well as the decision on liquidating the Ukrainian republican 
status of Sevastopol; the setting up of its own ministry of 
internal affairs and security service; the demands that the 
Sevastopol naval base should be transferred to the Russian Black 
Sea Fleet; the demands that the Ukrainian armed formations 
should be withdrawn from Crimea -- this is far from being the 
full list of the violations of the Constitution of Ukraine and 
Helsinki accords, and the illegitimate actions by the president 
and the Supreme Council of Crimea aimed at splitting Ukraine, 
igniting civil war and escalating conflict between Ukraine and 
Russia to the limit when its solution becomes possible only by 
means of armed struggle. 
  "All these actions by irresponsible helmsmen of Crimea are 
encouraged by the deputies to the State Duma of the Russian 
Federation with the president of Russia being aware of this. 
  "We demand that the world community should take resolute 
measures aimed at stopping the interference in the affairs of 
the sovereign Ukrainian state on the part of the government 
officials and the State Duma of Russia and guaranteeing security 
and territorial integrity of Ukraine. 
  "We demand that the Supreme Council and the president of 
Ukraine should take effective measures so that the Constitution 
and the laws of Ukraine be abided by in Crimea and that 
Ukraine's territorial integrity be ensured," says the appeal by 
Rukh.

  [Text] Issues concerning supplies of modern weapons to the 
Ukrainian Armed Forces and use of the country's unique 
industrial and scientific-technical potential became the center 
of attention at a briefing held yesterday at the Ukrainian 
Defense Ministry. Lieutenant General Lev Hnatenko, first deputy 
chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces Armaments and chief of the 
Armaments General Headquarters, spoke with journalists in detail 
about Ukraine's implementation of international agreements on 
nuclear disarmament and reduction of conventional weapons. He 
emphasized that, despite economic hardships, Ukraine is able, 
and should, produce military equipment which would be comparable 
to the world's best standards and become competitive on world 
markets. 
  Lt. Gen. Hnatenko also reported on certain problems of 
material provisions in the process of servicing already existing 
weapons. However, the main conclusion is that the Ukrainian 
Armed Forces is equipped with all necessary means to perform its 
tasks, which are aimed at protecting Ukraine's sovereignty and 
territorial integrity.

  [Text] The Ukrainian Committee for Oil and Gas has decided 
to halt gas supplies to 2300 enterprises in the republic which 
have failed to settle accounts for supplies received, the 
committee's chairman Mikhail Kovalko told a press conference in 
Kiev Thursday. 
  He said that the enterprises' debts for gas ran to 15 
trillion karbovantsy, and that was making it difficult for 
Ukraine to pay for gas imported from Russia and Turkmenistan. 
  A spokesman for the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers told 
Interfax Ukraine that the republic currently owed the Russian 
Gazprom joint stock company around 600 million US dollars. 
However, Gazprom was due to pay Ukraine 100 million dlrs for 
the transportation of Russian gas through Ukrainian territory. 
  "A protocol signed by Vice-Premier Valentin Landik in Moscow 
in April states that our Russian partners and ourselves will 
make a monthly analysis of the repayment of the Ukrainian debt 
for gas," Kovalko said. 
  He also said "despite the difficulties paying, Gazprom is, 
for the time being, supplying gas to the agreed volumes." 
  Kovalko also said that "this will assist with preparations 
for next winter in that we can pump around 2 billion cubic 
meters of gas into our reservoirs."

<F P=106> [Statement by the Lithuanian Government "On the Homeland </F>
Union's Proposal To Adopt by Way of Referendum the 
Constitutional Draft Law `On Illegal Privatization, Devalued 
Deposits and Stocks, and Law Enforcement Violations'" issued on 
10 May in Vilnius] 
  [Text] Having considered the draft law "On Illegal 
Privatization, Devalued Deposits and Stocks, and Law Enforcement 
Violations" submitted by the Homeland Union (Lithuanian 
Conservatives), and the commentary presented by its Executive 
Council Chairman G. Vagnorius [former prime minister], the 
Government of the Republic of Lithuania states that this draft 
law is just another attempt of the Homeland Union to push 
through an unconstitutional law. The enactment of its 
provisions would set Lithuanian people against one another, 
fool, and impoverish them even more, while the effects of all 
this would be blamed on the president and the Government of the 
Republic of Lithuania. 
  The current Lithuanian Government does not avoid fair and 
harsh criticism. At the same time, it does not specifically 
engage in the analysis and criticism of shortcomings of former 
governments. Given such slander and reckless appeals, however, 
the government must say to the countrymen what sort of draft law 
this is, and what goals the Homeland Union leadership is 
pursuing. 
  The draft law links in a populist manner and deliberately 
confuses three problems: Compensation of devalued deposits, 
privatization of state property, and long-term property 
indexation. Undoubtedly, the key problem is the compensation of 
deposits, which inhabitants had in Savings Bank accounts before 
26 February 1991. At that time, the Lithuanian population had 
almost 2.8 million accounts at the Savings Bank, that is, this 
problem is pressing to nearly everyone, particularly to older 
people. The total of deposits was 7.1 billion rubles [R]. 
However, only R0.4 billion were kept in the Lithuanian Savings 
Bank accounts, and the remaining R6.7 billion -- in the USSR 
Savings Bank. In fact, G. Vagnorius' government did not do 
anything to make Russia return those deposits, and it chose the 
easiest way for deceiving people by urging depositors to leave 
their money intact in savings banks. Incidentally, procuring 
cattle from inhabitants and having no real resources, G. 
Vagnorius' government also urged inhabitants to leave their 
money in savings banks. It promised to change those deposits 
according to a more favorable exchange rate when introducing the 
national currency. 
  The program of G. Vagnorius' government, which the Supreme 
Council of the Republic of Lithuania approved on 13 June 1991 
(the resolution was signed by current Homeland Union Chairman V. 
Landsbergis), included a pledge to protect the inhabitants' 
deposits in savings banks against inflation -- "by adding the 
interest and, thus, increasing it in accordance with the 
officially approved inflation rate (in percent) over a period of 
interest review." Incidentally, it is this incorrect economic 
policy of G. Vagnorius' government that brought the largest wave 
on inflation to our country with its rate exceeding 50 percent 
in certain months. Therefore, it is understandable why former 
Lithuanian officials, V. Landsbergis and G. Vagnorius, who were 
fully responsible for restricting the payment of deposits to 
inhabitants and for their complete devaluation, have now chosen 
such an immoral political method, and they dare and continue to 
try to amass a political fortune from this problem. 
  Misleading the country's population, the Conservatives 
are urging it in a populist move to adopt by way of referendum 
their proposed draft law, because otherwise illegal 
privatization will not be prevented, and inhabitants will lose 
the savings that are backed by assets subject to 
privatization, while the economy and living standards will 
continue to decline. G. Vagnorius stresses in particular 
that if "we prevent the distribution of state property without 
privatization, it will be possible to exchange the 1991 ruble 
for more litas rather than just one." At first glance, this is 
a very attractive appeal. It is very difficult for people to 
realize why the current government is categorically 
speaking out against the adoption of such a draft law. 
  First, inhabitants lost their savings long ago, 
while the proposal to index them and other similar payments more 
than a 100 times is not based on any real possibilities. 
  Compensation of savings and the restoration of the 
Lithuanian 
Savings Bank assets according to the proposed 100-fold 
indexation alone would require about 8 billion litai [Lt]. One 
can expect most Lithuanian people, particularly of retirement 
age, who were already deceived by G. Vagnorius' government, to 
come for their indexed deposits all at the same time. However, 
the draft law does not envision the manner in which banks can 
unrestrictedly pay indexed deposits until the assets transferred 
to them are sold, and the sale of these assets will become 
complicated due to their small value. Nor does the law envision 
who will cover losses for banks if the property is sold at a 
price lower than its indexed nominal value. It will not be easy 
to privatize the remaining state property because the objects 
that enjoyed the greatest demand (and had the lowest prices) 
were sold at the beginning of privatization, when G. Vagnorius' 
government was in power. 
  If the rules for indexing and paying deposits proposed in 
the 
draft law were applied, the money supply in circulation would 
increase almost eight-fold and would exceed Lt9 billion, while 
the current money supply is a bare Lt1.040 million. The absence 
of an adequate amount of goods and services on the market would 
immediately cause hyperinflation (unrestrained price rise) which 
would gradually lead to the inevitable impoverishment of all 
inhabitants, including depositors. This would have a 
particularly painful effect on a large part of the population 
which does not keep its savings in banks, as well as on 
employees of budget offices, because there would be no chance of 
increasing their wages in accordance with the inflation rate. 
Hyperinflation would destroy the Lithuanian economy and would 
fully devalue the national currency. The same conclusion was 
drawn by the World Bank experts after studying the draft law. 
  Second, while reiterating to the Lithuanian 
population about the possible indexation of deposits by using 
finances received from the sale of state property, G. Vagnorius 
should understand that it is his government that is primarily 
responsible for distributing almost the entire state assets for 
investment coupons for half price. Under this law, two-thirds 
of the property subject to privatization could be sold for 
investment coupons, that is, Lt712 million (two-thirds out of 
Lt1.068 billion), while the actual sum was Lt1.313 billion, that 
is, more than there was property for privatization. Although 
people were allowed to use investment coupons to buy apartments 
and land, or to privatize the property of agrarian enterprises 
(Lt343 million in investment coupons were used for this 
purpose), the amount of investment coupons issued for the 
privatization of state assets under the law on the primary 
privatization of state property exceeded the sum assigned by law 
as being Lt257.7 million. Therefore, the possibilities of 
commercial privatization are highly restricted in our country. 
Certainly, the policy of utilization of investment coupons is 
typical of all post- communist countries. However, sums of 
investment coupons or other forms of state property payments 
considerably differ in various states. For example, they 
account for 25 and 20 percent of the entire state assets in the 
Czech Republic and Slovenia, respectively. Meanwhile, in our 
country, investment coupons account for 82 percent of state 
property. Privatization in Estonia and Latvia is exclusively 
commercial -- only for money. 
  Such a mode of state property privatization did not grant 
any 
possibilities to accumulate larger finances that could be 
utilized to compensate devalued deposits. However, it is 
already impossible to return to the former stage and change the 
privatization of state property, or to nationalize the long-term 
property that is privatized, because this would mean nothing 
else but a new nationalization. The sacred principle of 
property inviolability, contained in the Lithuanian 
Constitution, would be violated. This would discredit our 
government not only inside the country but also on the 
international scene, because private property is preserved and 
protected throughout the world. 
  Third, the deceitful and reckless statement that 
"in early 1993, the majority of the Lithuanian Democratic Labor 
Party [LDDP] in the Seimas [parliament], as well as the 
government, made some inadmissible amendments to privatization 
laws and resolutions, which allegedly legalize the appropriation 
of state assets and the property of true stockholders for "its 
own people".... The denationalization of industrial enterprises 
is even simpler. Since last spring, a "group of friends" 
[reference to managers linked with the LDDP] has mostly 
"transferred them" to stock companies without any privatization, 
or without paying either in litas or investment coupons." 
  Under Article 31 of the law on state-run enterprises adopted 
back in 1990 (G. Vagnorius actively participated in its 
drafting), and under G. Vagnorius' government resolution No. 51 
"On the Increase of Capital Stock at State-Run and State Stock 
Enterprises With Their Own Resources," issued on 27 January 
1992, enterprises were granted the right to enlarge their 
capital stock with residue profits, by issuing free or partially 
paid stocks in line with the law. This was the key method for 
restoring devalued working capital of enterprises due to 
hyperinflation, and for accumulating resources necessary for 
investments. 
  An increase of the stock capital in line with the law on 
state-run enterprises changes only the ratio of state and stock 
capital, while the total sum of state capital remains 
undiminished. Therefore, the change in the status of an 
enterprise prevents the privatization of its state property, 
because in this case the state acquires the stockholders' rights 
defined in Article 14 of the law on stock companies of the 
Republic of Lithuania. Such a process cannot be called 
privatization or the appropriation of state property. 
  A commentary to the draft law often mentions a "group of 
friends." However, these are not representatives of the 
government or the Mafia, but collectives of enterprises that 
became lawful stockholders. These are people who, under the 
provisions of the law on state-run enterprises, allocated 
residue profits for the enlargement of the stock capital, who 
did not "eat up" residue profits in the form of bonuses or other 
payments, and who did not put any additional pressure on the 
consumer market. So, what is their guilt, and why do the 
Conservatives propose to take away their amassed property? 
  Resolution No. 456 "On Privatization Rules for State-Run and 
State Stock Enterprises, Non-Residential Facilities or Buildings 
Leased From State Offices and Organizations With Private Capital 
Investments," issued by G. Vagnorius' government on 12 June 
1992, authorized the transfer of leased non-residential 
facilities to private capital enterprises as a state property 
contribution. The value of those facilities was assessed by the 
experts' commission, while the Central Privatization Commission 
was allowed to raise it to market prices. Between 1992 and 
1993, lawfully leased facilities or buildings were transferred 
to 77 private capital enterprises. The residue value of these 
facilities is Lt38,400. The experts' commission assessed them 
at Lt3.5 million, while the Central Privatization Commission 
increased their value to Lt6.2 million. Nine commercial banks 
received leased facilities as a state property contribution with 
the residue value of Lt78,700, and the Central Privatization 
Commission enlarged the latter to Lt10 million. Since this 
resolution ran counter to the law on primary privatization of 
state property, the current government amended it by resolution 
No. 178 on 16 May 1994. 
  This repeatedly demonstrates that in pursuing selfish goals, 
the Homeland Union leadership can bring the most absurd charges 
against the Seimas majority and the current government. 
  Fourth, the Conservatives' proposal to index the 
long-term property of enterprises, including that of agrarian 
entities, offices, and organizations, in accordance with its 
structure as of 1 May 1992, and with the overall rate of 
devaluation, is totally unacceptable. With the privatization 
process under way, the structure of capital has essentially 
changed, and one cannot return to what is nonexistent. 
  Government resolution No. 206 of 28 March 1994 established 
the ratio of property indexation considering the date this 
property was acquired, and the fact that the volume of 
production in industry and other sectors of the economy have 
declined by about 50 percent in comparison with 1991. 
Therefore, the effectiveness of long-term property has also 
dropped by half, and it would be incorrect to estimate it 
according to the full rate of devaluation, which the Statistics 
Department is doing. A large part of the country's long- term 
property comprises outdated equipment and technologies, which 
had to be worn out. However, former government resolutions 
continuously reduced the depreciation of the principal means of 
production. During the first indexation, the depreciation of 
long- term property was reduced twice, while during the second 
indexation -- four times. This way, the true value of capital 
goods became distorted. Therefore, government resolution No. 
206 of 28 March 1994 envisions the indexation of the primary and 
residual value in accordance with different ratios, by restoring 
relevant depreciation. The surplus of the reviewed property is 
ascribed as the state and stock capital registered before 1 
April 1994. 
  The indexation of long-term property is mandatory for 
state-run and state stock enterprises, while private companies 
are only urged to accomplish this. Stockholders themselves must 
demand from their managers the indexation of their long-term 
property. Following the indexation of long-term property and 
capital of enterprises, stockholders' capital is also indexed, 
that is, the nominal value or the existing number of stocks is 
increased. Therefore, stockholders will not incur any losses. 
Thus, it is totally incomprehensible on what grounds G. 
Vagnorius calls the resolution of the current government on the 
indexation of long-term property "just another deliberate 
deception of people" and impertinent arbitrary rule; why, in 
his opinion, the value of the restored property "does not go to 
its owners, that is, the true stockholders or the state; and 
why is this property transferred in an unconstitutional manner 
to a "group of friends," who has recently acquired stock 
unlawfully or who has appropriated assets in some other way." 
Is it not an attempt to discredit the current government at any 
cost and to mislead the Lithuanian population? 
  Fifth, having done nothing or not having 
fulfilled their promises to protect the inhabitant's deposits 
against inflation, the Conservatives are now proposing in their 
draft law (Paragraph 6 of Article 4) that the government assign 
$6 million from the Lithuanian hard currency reserve to fully 
compensate the deposits that were kept in the Lithuanian branch 
of the USSR Foreign Economic Relations Bank. This is a tempting 
proposal. However, we would like to ask G. Vagnorius on this 
occasion why his government, which intended to compensate 
inhabitants' devalued savings, wasted rather than preserved $5 
million before the introduction of the litas by buying some 
totally unnecessary medical equipment from the Canadian company 
"Asmar." G. Vagnorius' government did not do anything to regain 
from the USSR Foreign Economic Relations Bank the deposits of 
physical and juridical persons estimated at $148.9 million, with 
$95 million among them accumulated for the reconstruction of the 
Klaipeda state oil enterprise, even though there were 
possibilities for this. Large finances were also wasted to 
acquire arms and supply the national defense system and the 
government security service. The Seimas Commission for 
Investigating Economic Crimes has established that G. Vagnorius' 
government distributed several tens of millions of U.S. dollars 
without Supreme Council approval. Meanwhile, this money could 
be amassed to compensate the devalued investments. 
  The current government, in cooperation with the Seimas, is 
looking for ways to compensate inhabitants' lost savings. In 
its 15 December 1993 resolution No. 1-338, the Seimas approved 
the rules of indexing inhabitants' savings accumulated before 26 
February 1991, and established that beginning in 1995, 
compensations for inhabitants' deposits will be estimated and 
paid in accordance with the amount of finances saved in the 
Income Restoration and Compensation Fund. The Seimas approved 
the statute of this fund on 26 April 1994 by its resolution No. 
I-444. This fund is formed with budget reserves, as well as 
with money earned from the privatization of state property and 
the sale of state stocks on the securities market, and with 
dividends received for the state capital in stock companies, and 
other resources. Under the current rules, by 1 May of this 
year, the government has paid more than Lt108 million in 
compensations, and it plans to pay another Lt100 million in 
early 1995. 
  Government resolution No. 176 issued on 16 March 1994 
defined 
the rules of partial compensation for the deposits which 
inhabitants kept at the Lithuanian branch of the USSR Foreign 
Economic Relations Bank (a similar decision was also adopted in 
1993). The Finance Ministry received $1.2 million from the 
Government reserve fund to pay compensations to former 
depositors of the aforementioned bank. As of 1 May, there were 
$845,000 paid out of this fund. After the total assigned sum is 
paid out, 1,081 persons (out of the total of 2,107 depositors at 
the given bank) would receive full compensation for the 
appropriated money. 
  In addition, the return of appropriated deposits is the 
issue 
of heated debate in negotiations with Russia. 
  Sixth, the Conservatives want the draft law to act 
retroactively and recognize as unlawful the actions of 
enterprises in increasing the stock capital with residual 
profits and by other legal measures contained in laws and 
resolutions drafted and adopted during the times of G. 
Vagnorius' government. 
  This draft law has quite a number of inconsistencies and 
contradictions with the current law of the Republic of 
Lithuania. It is also full of inaccuracies and provisions 
regulating such relations that cannot be the subject matter of 
this law. Moreover, under Part 3 of Article 69 of the 
Lithuanian Constitution, this draft law could be presented as 
constitutional only if it is included in the list of 
constitutional laws, drafted by the Lithuanian Seimas. 
  Following the universally accepted principle of the division 
of powers, the lawfulness of some government actions should be 
considered by the Constitutional Court rather than by way of 
referendum. 
  By submitting this draft law, the Homeland Union is seeking 
not to restore justice but to set Lithuanian people against one 
another even more, to paralyze the economic and social policy 
conducted by the current government, to cause chaos in the 
country's economy, to impoverish the people, and to discredit 
the Lithuanian Government through this. 
  Realizing the meaningless and absurd nature of this move, 
the 
Government of the Republic of Lithuania appeals to all 
Lithuanian people not to yield to the temptation of Homeland 
Union's populist proposals, and not to vote for this draft law. 
We can improve our lives through patient daily work rather than 
through referendums. 
  [Signed] The Government of the Republic of Lithuania 
  [Dated] 10 May 1994

Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh" -- TURAN headline] 
  [Text] Baku, 19 May (TURAN) -- Today early in the morning 
Azerbaijan's Defense Minister, Mamed-Rafi Mamedov, left for 
Moscow, the source from Azerbaijan's Defense Ministry told TURAN. 
  As was reported, earlier Baku refused to sign the document 
concerning truce due to the fact that Armenia insisted on the 
settlement of two questions at a time: the introduction of 
Russian troops into the conflict zone and discussion of the 
status of Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  Defense Minister Mamedov said that this proposal contradicts 
preliminary agreements and then left the talks. 
  Yesterday special envoy of Russian president, Vladimir 
Kazimirov, arrived in Baku to incline Azerbaijan to sign the 
truce agreement. 
  On the same day President Aliyev conducted phone talks with 
Pavel Grachev. During the phone talks, President Aliyev said 
that Baku considers the terms of the truce as "humiliating ones" 
and asked to take this point into account. However, Grachev 
mentioned that "he cannot interfere into internal affairs of 
Azerbaijan and he is waiting for an answer to Russia's 
proposals." 
  All these facts prove unofficial data that Moscow 
intensified 
its pressure on Baku after it refused to sign the document. 
Every time Moscow puts forward more and more difficult 
conditions.

  [Text] Vice Premier Sergey Shakhray will be carrying out 
the duties of deputy to the head of the Russian government until 
the signing by the president of a decree on being relieved of 
these duties. The final decision on his future in the 
government Shakhray does not intend to take until his meeting 
with Premier Chernomyrdin and President Yeltsin. This was how 
Shakhray commented to the information by an Interfax 
correspondent that Yeltsin had not accepted Shakhray's 
resignation. 
  Shakhray announced his resignation on Wednesday after he had 
been removed by Yeltsin's orders from his other government post 
as minister of nationality and regional affairs. 
  According to Shakhray's press service, he puts the 
president's evaluation, voiced by Kostikov, of his personal 
traits "on the conscience" of Press Secretary Kostikov. The 
latter had voiced criticisms of Shakhray while quoting the 
president on Thursday at a briefing in the Kremlin. Kostikov, 
quoting the president's words, in part said that Shakhray is 
marked by "a certain political fickleness and a desire to 
accumulate many (governmental) posts, and has political plans 
that don't always meet the true interests of Russia."

  [Text] Boris Yeltsin did not accept Sergey Shakhray's 
resignation from the post of vice premier, Vyacheslav Kostikov, 
press secretary of the president, reported today. He also 
denied rumors that preparations for a major reshuffle are under 
way in the top echelons of power in Russia, in particular that 
Sergey Filatov is going to be dismissed from his post as head of 
the presidential administration. 
  In the meantime, Sergey Filatov himself considers that the 
arrival of the new minister for nationalities will considerably 
speed up the settlement of the Russian-Chechen issue. 
  State Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin is convinced that this became 
possible largely thanks to Sergey Shakhray's successful work. 
  [Begin Rybkin recording] Sergey Mikhaylovich Shakhray did a 
great deal to remove the little splits that have appeared 
between Russia and Chechnya. I think this should be said to his 
credit -- naturally, together with the president -- that the 
treaty on dividing powers between the center and Tatarstan as a 
region has been concluded. I think the fact that the Chechen 
Republic has joined the negotiating process also bears witness 
to the diplomatic activity and sophistication of Sergey 
Mikhaylovich Shakhray. It is hard for me to say how the new 
minister will tackle his job. I think questions relating to 
inter-ethnic relations are very subtle questions -- extremely 
so, I would say -- and this fine tissue of relations should be 
woven by the hands of professionals of the highest class. [end 
recording] 
  Incidentally, Interfax has learned from well-informed 
sources 
that since Sergey Shakhray announced his resignation from the 
post of vice premier, several Russian regional leaders have 
appealed to the leadership of Russia not to accept his 
resignation. Among them are the presidents of Tatarstan and 
Bashkiria, and the head of the Karelian government. 
  As for Chechnya, Presidential Press Secretary Vyacheslav 
Kostikov expressed an opinion that a personal meeting between 
Boris Yeltsin and Dzhokhar Dudayev may take place in the near 
future. He said Russian-Chechen relations are the most painful 
issue of all, but added that some progress is beginning to show 
in the matter.

<F P=106> [Andrey Aderekhin report: "Kuban Governor N. Yegorov </F>
Replaces S. Shakhray"] 
  [Text] Krasnodar -- Nikolay Yegorov, former governor of 
Kuban, has been appointed Russian Federation minister for 
nationalities affairs and regional policy. 
  Yegorov said in an interview with the newspaper KUBANSKIYE 
NOVOSTI on the eve of his appointment that the president had 
made the offer to him 6 May and proposed that he start acting as 
minister for nationalities affairs and regional policy after the 
public holidays. The governor accepted that proposal. 
  Yegorov has shown himself to be a very thrifty politician in 
Krasnodar Kray. As much as five years ago he was chairman of 
the "Rodina" Collective Farm in Labinskiy Rayon. After August 
1991 he became the deputy of V. Dyakonov, the first governor of 
Kuban. Some time later, however, he moved to the opposition, to 
the kray soviet, and took Dyakonov's place after his removal 
from power. At the time of last fall's events Yegorov broke off 
relations with the kray soviet, which had supported the White 
House. He was elected a deputy of the Federation Council. At 
the beginning of this year the administration head finally 
abandoned his former friendship with the soviets, decreeing the 
termination of the kray soviet's powers and the abolition of its 
apparatus. 
  Yegorov has never been a fervent supporter of Boris Yeltsin, 
although he has been sufficiently cautious in his public 
pronouncements. People in the governor's entourage liked to 
repeat that all this political fighting was happening in Moscow, 
while in Kuban it was necessary to get on with their own 
business -- not politics but economics. Premier V. Chernomyrdin 
repeatedly made approving remarks about Yegorov's business 
qualities, describing him as a strong leader and economic 
planner who constantly pestered the government with his regional 
problems. 
  The question of Yegorov's move to the Russian Federation 
Government had evidently been long in preparation. Back in 
March, after Yeltsin's meetings in Sochi with the kray's 
governor, people in the administration told journalists that 
Yegorov's efforts to shape new relations between the center and 
the region had been evaluated positively by the president. They 
were referring to the president's and the premier's consent to 
the signing of an agreement on the delimitation of powers 
between the center and the kray. The specific provisions of the 
document were not reported, although it was announced that this 
agreement would make it possible to realize in practice the 
principle enshrined in the new Russian Federation Constitution 
of equal rights for the components of the Federation. 
  In the opinion of some observers, Yegorov's appointment as a 
minister will significantly strengthen the positions of the 
Federation Council, which is headed by Vladimir Shumeyko, who 
also comes from Krasnodar Kray, in influencing the shaping of 
regional policy.

  [Text] Moscow, May 19 (AFP) -- Russia's former vice 
president Aleksandr Rutskoy said he was questioned Thursday [19 
May] by the prosecutor's office after calling for the overthrow 
of his arch- rival President Boris Yeltsin at rallies earlier 
this month. 
  Rutskoy, speaking during a telephone interview with AFP, 
said 
he answered all of the prosecutor's questions in writing, 
filling two and a half pages. 
  Rutskoy on May 9 urged the overthrow of Yeltsin during a 
victory day rally to mark the 49th anniversary of the end of 
WWII in Europe. 
  He told his audience at the time that by the 50th 
anniversary 
celebration of the conflict's end, Yeltsin's "police state" 
would no longer exist. 
  He made similar comments at another opposition rally May 12. 
  But on Thursday he said he told prosecutors that he had 
meant 
was that the government should be changed through 
"constitutional means." 
  "I did not violate the constitution which guarantees each 
Russian citizen the freedom of ideas and expression," he said. 
  The prosecutor's office has questioned various other people 
who took part in both rallies and is to decide Friday whether to 
launch an official investigation. 
  Rutskoy and several other leaders of the failed October 1993 
revolt against Yeltsin were amnestied by the new legislature in 
February.

  [Text] "The war of nerves between Kiev and Simferopol was 
doomed to aggravate," a member of Russia's Presidential Council, 
Emil Payn, told Interfax in comments on developments in and 
around the Crimea. 
  According to him, on the one hand, a negative impact on the 
development of events was made by the tough stand taken by the 
Kiev authorities toward the Crimea as a means of consolidating 
the polarized Ukrainian society on the eve of presidential 
elections. On the other, the Crimean leadership showed no 
particular inclination for compromises, being disposed to take 
decisions made by Kiev too nervously, said Payn. 
  According to him, energetic measures designed to cool the 
situation should be taken by the Russian authorities urgently. 
Such steps should be addressed to both Simferopol and Kiev. 
"They must be not threats, but purely diplomatic measures -- 
statements and actions aimed at preventing the conflict from 
further aggravating," Payn said. 
  He drew attention to the one-sided coverage of the 
developments in and around the Crimea by some Russian news 
media, in particular television, whose solidarity with the 
Crimean authorities might stimulate Simferopol's tough stand 
toward Kiev.

  [Text] Kiev, 19 May (UKRINFORM-TASS) -- The statement 
released for publication today by the Main Center for Public 
Relations, attached to the Ukrainian Internal Affairs Ministry, 
reads the following: 
  "Certain mass media, `Ostankino' Television and Radio 
Company 
in particular, have been whipping up the situation around the 
Republic of Crimea. Exaggerated importance is consistently 
given to the subject of the latest personnel reshuffle in the 
leadership of the internal affairs bodies of the autonomous 
republic. 
  The Chief Public Relations Center of Ukraine's Interior 
Ministry has been instructed to inform the media and the public 
of the Interior Ministry's position on this matter. 
  The current situation was analyzed at the Interior Ministry 
of the Republic of Crimea on 19 May. A team from the Ukrainian 
Interior Ministry recently worked in the Republic of Crimea and 
documents relating to the practical aid provided to official 
bodies and departments of the interior were discussed at the 
meeting. 
  Among the questions discussed was the issue of incorrect 
actions that occurred when Aleksandr Plyuta, the interior 
minister of the Republic of Crimea, was dismissed from his post 
and a former army general, Valeriy Kuznetsov, took his place. 
We emphasize once again, as we have done many times before, 
that all such issues are to be decided solely by the interior 
minister of Ukraine, in accordance with Ukraine's law on militia. 
  Valentyn Nedryhaylo, Ukrainian first deputy interior 
minister, who attended the meeting, read out Ukrainian President 
Leonid Kravchuk's decree turning the Crimean Republic's Interior 
Ministry into the Ukrainian Interior Ministry's Main Directorate 
of Internal Affairs in the Crimea and making it directly 
accountable to the Ukrainian Interior Ministry. In accordance 
with the decree, administrative and service premises, weapons, 
vehicles, and other property are being handed over to the Main 
Directorate of Internal Affairs in the Crimea. 
  Also read out was a Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers decision 
on changes in the complement and structure of the Ukrainian 
Interior Ministry, providing for the introduction of an 
additional post-- Ukrainian deputy interior minister, who is 
also head of the Ukrainian Interior Ministry's Main Directorate 
of Internal Affairs in the Crimea. By order of the Ukrainian 
interior minister, the post has been filled by Militia Colonel 
Valeriy Chernyshov, a Russian, born in 1952, and a graduate of 
what is now the Ukrainian Academy of Internal Affairs, who has 
over 20 years' experience of working in internal affairs bodies. 
V. Chernyshov was born in the Crimea's Bakhchisarayskiy Rayon 
and worked for over 12 years in operational commanding positions 
in Crimea's internal affairs bodies. Over the past few years he 
has served on the staff of the Ukrainian Interior Ministry as 
deputy head of the Main Directorate for Criminal Investigations. 
  Disregarding the decree of L. Kravchuk, the president of our 
state, on 19 May, the Supreme Soviet session of the Crimean 
Republic appointed Valeriy Kuznetsov to the nonexistent post of 
interior minister of the Crimean Republic. 
  A dangerous precedent has thus been created that may have a 
negative effect on the activities of the internal affairs bodies 
as a whole and help to destabilize the peninsula's crime 
situation, which is already extremely tense."

<F P=106> [Statement by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk on the </F>
Crimean situation from a news conference given for editors of 
regional newspapers in Kiev on 19 May -- recorded] 
  [Text] Ukraine has done everything possible, and I am not 
exaggerating anything at this point, to satisfy both the 
political and legal problems that have arisen in Crimea, namely: 
Crimea, the population of Crimea, the authorities of Crimea, at 
that time the oblast council of Crimea, brought up the issue of 
granting autonomy to Crimea and held a referendum, as they say, 
and the Supreme Council decided to grant autonomy to the Crimean 
Republic. 
  When the issue of delimitation of powers arose, a law, 
although with a delay, was adopted. When the Crimean 
authorities raised the question of broader economic 
independence, this was granted to Crimea. That is to say, 
Ukraine was responding, and, what is more, it was responding 
sincerely and, let us say, with all good intentions to all those 
political, legal, and, partially, economic issues, because not 
everything is easily resolved. 
  When they elected the president in Crimea, I congratulated 
him, invited him to visit Kiev, and here in this building, an 
agreement was reached during talks, not in the documents that we 
wanted to work with Crimea constructively, that we would do 
everything possible so that its economic independence could be 
expanded. However, the condition of the state's territorial 
integrity, its, let us say, status, stipulated by the 
Constitutions of both Ukraine and Crimea, was a determining 
factor. It seemed to me then that we had come to this 
understanding. But right after this, they began to take steps 
of an absolutely opposite nature. Each decree, at least those 
that were issued on political issues, unitlaterally contradicted 
not only the Ukrainian Constitution but the Constitution of 
Crimea itself, not only Ukrainian laws, but Crimean laws as 
well. That is to say, virtually all, as they say, enforceable 
enactments were ignored. 
  And now, the situation has reached the point where it has 
been officially announced that Crimea wants to secede, strictly 
speaking, from Ukraine, and its leaders are declaring that this 
is the drift, so to speak, at first toward their own state and 
then toward Russia. Both the chairman of the newly elected 
Supreme Council and other Crimean figures were saying this. 
  This is why time has come for us to declare: ignoring the 
legislation of Ukraine, ignoring the realities, ignoring the 
anxiety over Crimea existing in the world, and ignoring 
international legal norms, stipulated both in the documents of 
the United Nations Organization and the Conference on Security 
and Cooperation in Europe, Crimea wants to unilaterally adopt 
documents that go beyond the Ukrainian Constitution, its laws, 
and the law on the delimitation of plenary powers. 
  This is why we have made a decision that if they do not 
abide 
by these fundamental provisions of principle, we shall act 
resolutely and consistently to defend Ukraine's territorial 
integrity and its state. I have issued decrees on subordinating 
the Crimean bodies of internal affairs directly to the minister 
of internal affairs of Ukraine, all the security services of 
Crimea to the chief of the Ukrainian Security Service, and all 
the judicial bodies to the Ukrainian minister of justice. 
  I will further act within the framework of the Constitution, 
in the constitutional regime. If the Supreme Council adopts the 
documents you have mentioned, I will immediately submit to the 
Ukrainian Supreme Council a draft resolution on stopping the 
resolutions of the Crimean Supreme Council. That is to say, we 
shall act, I emphasize this, within the framework of the 
Constitution, our plenary powers, strictly proceeding from the 
fact that Crimea is a constituent part of Ukraine, as is written 
in the Constitutions of both Ukraine and Crimea. Any revision 
of this fundamental provision of principle, entails inevitable 
grave consequences for those who carry this out. 
  Everybody must understand that there is a limit for any 
society and for any state that no one is allowed to exceed. 
This limit is the territorial integrity of the state. And he 
who wishes to ignore this, to be guided by his ambitions and, 
let us say, other principles, he must know that he acts contrary 
to laws, he must know that grave consequences are possible, he 
must know that these grave consequences will occur, first and 
foremost, in Crimea itself, and will be experienced by the 
population of Crimea. And those who provoke these consequences 
will be responsible for this, no matter how high his regalia and 
plenary powers, as they say.

  [Text] The Riigikogu adopted the broadcasting law today. 
According to this law, Estonian Radio and Estonian Television 
will continue as independent legal entities. The Riigikogu 
concluded that it would be unjustified to merge the two. Both 
Estonian Radio and Estonian Television may broadcast advertising 
material for up to five percent of the day's broadcasts. This 
permission has been given in order to provide them with proper 
funding. 
  The Riigikogu will set up a broadcasting council before 
taking its summer recess. The council will be the top authority 
for both Estonian Radio and Estonian Television. It is expected 
to be set up in June. 
  As recommended by experts, several clarifications were 
included in the broadcasting law. For example, the procedure 
for issuing broadcasting licenses to privately owned 
broadcasting stations has been made more specific. 
  The law adopted today regulates the rights and obligations 
of 
the electronic media, including those on the basis of which 
private radio stations operate in Estonia.

  [Text] Tallinn, May 19, BNS -- Russia will definitely not 
be admitted to the Council of Europe [CE] before next year, 
parliament Deputy Chairman Tunne Kelam told reporters today 
after his return from Poland. 
  Kelam, who holds the post of CE Parliamentary Assembly vice 
president, attended May 16-18 sessions of CE Parliamentary 
Assembly committees in Warsaw. 
  The parliament deputy chairman affirmed at the news 
conference that the session of the joint committee focused on 
expansion of the Council of Europe. Three members of CE 
Parliamentary Assembly start June 13 a fact-finding mission to 
Russia to put together a report to the council on the situation 
there. Kelam said the joint committee suggested the three be 
accompanied by persons who are better informed about the state 
of affairs in the former Soviet Union. "Attention must be paid 
also to Ukraine, and Moldova, too, has applied for CE 
membership," Kelam told reporters. 
  Kelam said the bureau of CE Parliamentary Assembly discussed 
how Estonia has been fulfilling its obligations as a CE member. 
He noted that, according to the report presented to the bureau, 
Estonia has done its best. Besides, the country will most 
probably ratify the European Human Rights Convention before the 
end of the year, he added. 
  The Warsaw meeting approved a draft agenda for the upcoming 
assembly session, which includes expansion of the Council of 
Europe and its relations with the United Nations, as well as 
reports by the leaders of several European states. "Also, during 
the session Secretary General-elect Daniel Tarschys will assume 
his post," Kelam noted. 
  During his stay in Poland Kelam met with the deputy chairman 
of the Polish parliament to discuss setting up groups of friends 
of Estonia and Poland in the two countries' legislatures. 
  On his way back from Warsaw the parliament deputy speaker 
stopped over in Stockholm where he met with local Estonians.

  [Text] Vilnius, May 18, BNS -- Lithuanian Foreign Minister 
Povilas Gylys on Wednesday [18 May] returned from Brussels where 
he attended a meeting between the foreign ministers of the 
Baltic states and their counterparts from Belgium, Greece, 
Germany, which presently make up the presidency troika of the 
European Union [EU]. 
  The Lithuanian minister spoke about the course of free trade 
talks with the EU on behalf of all three Baltic states. He said 
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are interested in completing the 
talks by July. 
  Gylys emphasized that free trade agreements with the EU are 
very important to the three Baltic countries, considering their 
economic reforms and further integration into the EU, the 
Lithuanian Foreign Ministry said. The Lithuanian minister 
expressed hope that EU members will understand the economic 
difficulties encountered by the Baltics and will make mutually 
acceptable decisions in the fields of agriculture, fishing and 
textile industry. 
  Gylys urged the EU to start talks on associate membership 
with the Baltics as soon as possible and to discuss the issue at 
the upcoming EU summit in June. The minister said it is 
necessary to intensify the dialogue between the Baltics and the 
EU more and suggested to include Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania 
into the political dialogue between the EU and Central European 
states according to a 12-plus-6-plus-3 formula. 
  Minister Gylys praised the Western European Union's decision 
to grant associate status to 9 East and Central European states. 
"The step is a specific example of integrating the Baltic states 
into Western European structures."

  [Text] Vilnius, May 19, BNS -- Swedish Foreign Minister 
Margaretha af Ugglas completed her one-day visit to Lithuania 
Thursday [19 May] morning and left for Russia's Kaliningrad 
region, where she intends to meet with the head of the region's 
administration. 
  During her stay in Lithuania Wednesday, af Ugglas met with 
President Algirdas Brazauskas, Foreign Minister Povilas Gylys 
and visited the Ignalina nuclear power plant. 
  Asta Skaisgiryte, head of the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry's 
Northern Europe Division, said the Swedish minister has a 
negative attitude toward nuclear plants, but when she saw 
Ignalina's reactors, fire-prevention and safety systems, she 
seemed to be quite satisfied with the situation at the plant. 
"When there's no order, the chances of an accident are much 
higher," the minister said. 
  A Swedish expert working at Ignalina showed and explained 
how 
Sweden helps Lithuania to make its plant safer. Af Ugglas said 
she is satisfied with the work done. 
  The Swedish minister's meeting with her Lithuanian 
counterpart was mainly devoted to cooperation between Baltic and 
Nordic countries. Gylys and af Ugglas discussed preparations 
for a meeting between Nordic and Baltic foreign ministers, who 
intend to gather Aug. 31 in the Lithuanian seaside resort of 
Palanga. 
  Before Palanga, Nordic countries are expected to discuss 
possibilities to represent consular interests of the Baltic 
states in countries where Estonia, Latvia and Estonia do not 
have their diplomatic missions. Nordic countries already set up 
a joint working group to deal with the matter. 
  Gylys and af Ugglas also discussed Kaliningrad's 
demilitarization. The Swedish minister said she intends to 
inform Matochkin about Sweden's official position regarding the 
need to reduce Russia's military potential in Kaliningrad.

  [Text] Vilnius, May 19, BNS -- Lithuania welcomes Swedish 
Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas' position that the number 
of Russian troops in the Kaliningrad region must be reduced, the 
Lithuanian Foreign Ministry said in a press release Thursday [19 
May]. 
  "The Kaliningrad region is an anomaly in the Baltic Sea 
region because of the huge army and navy forces concentrated in 
this area," af Ugglas was quoted as saying by the Lithuanian 
ministry. The Swedish minister, who visited the region 
Thursday, reportedly expressed hope that Russia will demonstrate 
its preparedness to reduce its military potential in Kaliningrad. 
  The Lithuanian ministry said efforts to raise the issue of 
Kaliningrad's demilitarization on an international level and to 
integrate the region into international cooperation processes 
would significantly contribute to enhancing security in the 
Baltic Sea region.

  [Text] Vilnius, May 19, BNS -- Having met in Vilnius 
Thursday [19 May], Lithuanian and Belarusian defense ministers 
expect to establish permanent neighborly partnership relations. 
  A delegation of Belarusian defense officials, headed by 
Defense Minister Col. Gen. Pavel Kazlowski, met with Lithuanian 
Defense Minister Linas Linkevicius, Parliament Chairman Ceslovas 
Jursenas and visited the Gelezinis Vilkas (Iron Wolf) field 
brigade. 
  Both ministers agree that the 720-kilometer 
Lithuanian-Belarusian border is an incentive to cooperate. This 
argument seems to be above the differences in defense concepts. 
  Lithuania links its security guarantees with integration 
into 
NATO, while Belarus is a member of the collective security 
system of the CIS. But Linkevicius and Kazlowski maintain that 
the fact cannot hinder bilateral cooperation. 
  Linkevicius told reporters that contacts would be easier if 
Belarus joined NATO's "Partnership for Peace" program. 
  The Belarusian Government is now discussing the degree of 
the 
country's possible participation in the program, Kazlowski said 
at a press conference. 
  The Belarusian minister said relations with the Baltics are 
especially significant to Belarus. Kazlowski said his country 
would like to learn more about Lithuania's experience in 
creating its armed forces. 
  The two ministers agreed to set up working groups to 
continue 
the dialogue started in Vilnius and to determine areas for 
possible cooperation.

<F P=106> [Video report by correspondent Yelena Masyuk] </F>
  [Text] [Masyuk] Today, the followers of Lenin's cause met 
in Gorkiy Leninskiye at a closed coordinating meeting of 
Communist Parties active on the territory of the former USSR. 
Oleg Shenin, the chairman of the Council of the Union of CPSU 
Communist Parties, noted in his opening speech that the 
dictatorial and criminal regimes in the republics of the former 
USSR are gaining strength and if communists are idle, then, 
according to Shenin, the people will not forgive them. 
  [Shenin] All the program documents of all the Communist 
Parties say that they will strive to restore a single union 
state. 
  [Masyuk] At today's conference the leaders of Communist 
organizations discussed two issues. Firstly, the social and 
political situation on the territory of the USSR and methods to 
strengthen the Communist movement. The second question--a draft 
concept for restoring a renewed union. The concept's author is 
Yegor Ligachev. 
  [Ligachev] The concept contains the main principles for the 
restoration of a single union state in accordance with the will 
of the people. 
  [Masyuk] Can it be said that the Russian Communist Party is 
the leader among the Communist Parties of the CIS countries 
today? 
  [Gennadiy Zyuganov, Russian Communist Party leader] There is 
no leading, directing party. There is unity of action. 
  [Masyuk] In the intervals between sessions a small number of 
Communists visited the local Lenin Museum. 
  Why did you decide to all meet together in Gorkiy 
Leninskiye? 
  [Shenin] I think that it was so as once again to remind all 
those who came here and ourselves of the responsibility we bear 
toward the founders of our parties. 
  [Masyuk] Yelena Masyuk, Aleksey Chervyakov, the NTV 
television company. [video shows: meeting in progress,

  [Text] Moscow May 21 TASS -- Marshal Yevgeniy 
Shaposhnikov, former commander-in-chief of the allied armed 
forces of the Commonwealth of Independent States, believes that 
the Black Sea Fleet should be divided between all the countries 
of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) rather than 
between Russia and Ukraine. 
  Expressing his private opinion in a speech over Russian 
television on Saturday, he said that, since Ukraine did not join 
the CIS Treaty on Collective Security, it should be given 
one-eleventh part of the fleet. 
  The rest of the fleet should be used to protect the CIS 
interests in the Black Sea area. 
  Shaposhnikov also suggested that if any CIS country is 
unable 
to finance its part of the fleet, it can hand it over under the 
control of any other CIS country and receive for it a 
compensation in the form of oil, coal and other minerals.

  [Text] Russian participants in the CIS consultative bodies 
for cooperation in different spheres of the economy decided at 
their meeting today that a coordinating-consultative council 
must be created under the Russian Ministry for Cooperation with 
the CIS states. 
  This council will implement the economic strategy of Russia 
towards the CIS states. 
  The council will be headed by Russian Minister for 
Cooperation with the CIS Vladimir Mashschits. It will also 
include representatives of the Central Bank of Russia, the 
Customs Committee, the CIS Inter-State Bank currently being 
established, other CIS bodies and the directors of the Russian 
big state and private companies. 
  The council will concentrate on assistance to the CIS 
transnational financial and industrial structures and on 
coordination of activities of Russian departments in these 
spheres. 
  The council was given the right to submit its proposals and 
recommendations on implementation of the treaty on establishment 
of the Economic Union to the government. The appropriate 
agreement was signed in September, 1993. 
  Deputy Minister for Cooperation Marat Khusnutdinov said the 
main problem for the CIS states was that on non-payments. The 
debt of the neighboring countries to Russia for the delivery of 
energy supplies is 2.5 trillion rubles. 
  The first meeting of the new council planned for June will 
focus on possible establishment of a payment union, conversion 
of all CIS currencies, development of border trade and 
simplification of the customs procedures.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 20 TASS -- NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on a new 
spiral of confrontation between Simferopol and Kiev: 
  "The first session of the newly-elected Crimean parliament, 
resumed on May 19, began in a stormy manner. Before an agenda 
was formulated, the floor was given to Valeriy Kuznetsov, 
Crimean acting minister of the interior, at the request of 
President Yuriy Meshkov. 
  "Kuznetsov told the deputies that a plane with 
Colonel-General Valentin Nedrigailo [Valentyn Nedryhaylo], 
Ukraine's first deputy minister of the interior, and 
special-purpose troops on board had landed in Simferopol on the 
night from May 18 to 19. 
  "An unambiguous military coup is looming with the dismissal 
of Crimean Acting Interior Minister Kuznetsov from his post, 
speakers at the session maintained." 
  NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA (NEW DAILY NEWSPAPER) on the 
Crimean parliament session: 
  "The rather smooth session of the Crimean parliament was 
unexpectedly interrupted when Major-General Valeriy Kuznetsov, 
Crimean acting interior minister, took the floor, telling the 
deputies that a plane with General Nedrigailo and 15 
special-purpose troops had secretly arrived in Simferopol on the 
night of May 18 to 19. The unwelcome visitors immediately tried 
to seize the Crimean Interior Ministry building. But they 
attempt was repulsed." 
  The newspaper SEGOGNYA (TODAY) points out that, despite 
denials by the press centre of the Ukrainian Defence Ministry 
and the Navy, a ranking officer at the headquarters of the Black 
Sea Fleet confirmed information that Ukrainian National Guard 
and special- purpose units, at an aggregate strength at about 
1,000, had landed near Sevastopol in two groups, at Belbek and 
Chersonesus Cape airfields, after which they dispersed among 
Ukrainian naval units. 
  "The officer said a Ukrainian field military hospital had 
been set up in Chernobayevka village in Kherson region. 
Hospital personnel do not conceal from anyone that they prepare 
to receive the wounded with bullet and shrapnel wounds." 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) on possibility of seizure of 
Black 
Sea Fleet facilities by Ukrainian troops: 
  "According to data available with the editorial office, 
Ukrainian armed forces consider the possibility of yet another 
action to seize Black Sea Fleet facilities, this time those of 
the Izmail-based brigade of river ships. 
  "The First Ukrainian Air Mobile Brigade, which is notorious 
for its involvement in the seizure of a Black Sea Fleet naval 
unit based in Odessa, is taking a number of preparatory measures 
in this respect. 
  "To all appearances, the Ukrainian Defence Ministry has not 
abandoned hopes to resolve Black Sea Fleet problems by force, in 
defiance of the agreements, reached by the presidents of Russia 
and Ukraine in Moscow on April 15. The command of the brigade 
of river ships and local authorities have been warned about a 
provocation which is being prepared (and which, according to the 
newspaper SEGODNYA, is slated for May 25 -- note by ITAR-TASS)." 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA reports that an Azerbaijani Defence 
Ministry delegation, led by Minister Mamadrafi Mammadov, 
returned to Moscow on May 19 to carry on the discussion at the 
Russian Defence Ministry about a ceasefire accord in 
Nagorno-Karabakh and disengagement of the warring sides. 
  Mammadov is due to meet Pavel Grachev on Friday. The 
Azerbaijani delegation, after consultations in Baku, suggests 
that the agreement (which has already been signed by the defence 
ministers of Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh) be visaed in a 
package with an overall settlement plan which envisages a 
time-frame for the withdrawal of Karabakh troops from occupied 
territories". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an article by Zbigniew 
Brzezinski, former assistant to the U.S. President on national 
security affairs, about an erroneous U.S. strategy with regard 
to Russia. 
  For a number of years, U.S. policy with regard to Russia 
fluctuated between indulging in wishful thinking and cold 
realism. A dose of tough geopolitics, mixed with friendly 
sentiments towards the Russian people and also with sympathy for 
the aspirations of non-Russians, stands much more chances to 
fashion a worthy continuation for an earlier and historically 
successful strategy of deterrence, Mr. Brzezinski writes. 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI runs an interview with Yevgeniy Kozhokin, 
director of the Russian Institute for Strategic Studies, who 
singles out the following main areas of the institute's 
research: Russia's national security, the ex-Soviet states, 
European security, Russia's economic priorities, military policy 
and defence industry conversion to civilian production, and 
ecology. 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries the first instalment of an 
extensive interview with former Russian Vice-President Aleksandr 
Rutskoy who makes an evaluation of the October 1993 events. 
  In the second instalment of the interview, which is to be 
published in the newspaper's next issue, he describes in detail 
the "Lefortovo period". 
  TRUD runs an interview with Nikolay Gonchar, head of the 
Federation Council's committee on budget and finance, and former 
chairman of the Moscow city Council. 
  "We have no such danger as fascism (this notion has been 
taken liberties with). The danger is in something else: The 
people begin to wait for a dictatorship and want a 'strong arm'. 
The wounded sense of pride and the humiliation of the country 
are the main reasons. Not even the decline in the people's 
living standards", Gonchar said.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, May 21 (ITAR-TASS) -- The ROSSIISKIE VESTI 
newspaper prints a series of articles by Russian intellectuals 
under the general heading "Who Will Not Kill War, Will Be Killed 
by War". They explain why they signed the social accord treaty. 
  Here is what actor Mikhail Ulyanov, chairman of the 
Theatrical Artists' Union, says in this connection: "Men of 
culture and arts are sons and daughers of their people, who sing 
their songs, guess their thoughts, protect their interests and 
laud the homeland. 
  "But they need peace to do all this. If it brings our 
society even by a jot to wisdom, calm and accord, we must sign 
this document." 
  Noting that ceremonies of signing the above treaty continue 
in the Kremlin, the TRUD newspaper deplors that events which 
took place in the country last week, "happened not in line" with 
this agreement. 
  Writing about the declared all-Russian strike of civil 
aviators (although most flights were made according to 
schedule), the newspaper notes that even if politicians agree on 
a temporary moratorium in the struggle for power, "it is highly 
improbable that armistice will come into effect in the social 
sphere in the near future, since the social and economic 
situation is not improving." 
  The KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper singles out the events in and 
outside the Crimea. "If a conflict flares up, it will eclipse in 
its scale everything we encountered before," the newspaper 
claims in its commentary. "Because it will inevitably involve 
the Black Sea Fleet which has not been divided up to this time." 
  The newspaper expresses hope that the worst forecasts "will 
not come true and that the recent contacts between the Russian 
and Ukrainian presidents will calm down the situation". 
  At the same time, KRASNAYA ZVEZDA draws a parallel between 
the situation in the Crimea and the one which preceded "the 
bloody and protracted wars in Karabakh, Abkhazia and the 
Dniester area". 
  The NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA calls attention to a decision taken 
on Friday by the Crimean parliament to reinstate the 
constitution of 1992, pointing that its many provisions are at 
variance with the Ukrainian Constitution and the hitherto 
operating fundamental law of the Crimea Republic. 
  The newspaper carries an interview with Lilya Budzhurova, a 
Crimean parliament member from the Council of Crimean Tatars, 
claiming that Crimean parliamentarians "made the first step to 
destabilise the political situation not only in the Crimea but 
in Ukraine as whole". 
  According to Budzhurova, this "will be a conflict not only 
between the Crimea and Ukraine: Russia will be also drawn into 
it". 
  The same newspaper concentrates on preliminary results of a 
successful operation carried out by law enforcement officers on 
may 19 to free hostages from a currency exchange point captured 
by criminals on the Frunzenskaya Embankment in Moscow. 
  The KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper notes in an article about 
privileges that the government appropriated over nine times more 
funds than last year "for the medical centre at the Russian 
Government", despite a very modest increase in outlays for the 
country's public health. 
  Nearly 24 billion roubles or 6.7 per cent of all 
appropriations for public health, the newspaper continues, "will 
be used to treat the bureaucratic elite of the poor state". 
KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA sums up by saying that "the struggle 
started against privileges can be regarded as completed ... 
with a victory of the privileged". 
  The SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA prints a full text of explanations 
given by former Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy at the Moscow 
prosecutor's office in connection with directions given by 
acting Prosecutor-General of Russia Ilyushenko to examine 
legality of public statements by opposition leaders on May 9 and 
14, current. 
  The newspaper singles out Rutskoy's words that to change 
radically the present situation in the country, "we now need a 
new idea, a spiritual and moral idea meeting the interests of 
people and homeland". 
  In turn, the PRAVDA newspaper summarises the above 
explanations by Rutskoy where he claims that "President 
Yeltsin's autocratic regime is now reigning the country". 
  The newspaper features an article on unemployment in Russia. 
"Although 1,400,000 people receive officially unemployment 
benefits in Russia, according to various but concurring 
estimates, between 15 and 20 million people (20-25 per cent of 
all labour force) work part-time or do not receive wages at 
all," PRAVDA writes.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Yermolin report: "Could 18 Trillions Be Found?"] </F>
  [Text] An expanded sitting of the State Duma Defense 
Committee chaired by Sergey Yushenkov on Thursday was devoted to 
the upcoming second reading of the draft law "On The 1994 
Federal Budget." While the spotlight was certainly on the 
defense budget, the main question was -- what can and should be 
done to add the needed 18 trillion rubles [R] to the budget. 
  Vyacheslav Mozgalev, spokesman for the Ministry of the 
Economy, put it straight that given the planned defense 
appropriations (R37 trillion) Russia could have no defense as 
such as early as by August. That is to say there is also a 
clear realization in the government quarters (something one 
could have hardly doubted) that the defense appropriations in 
the draft law are absolutely inadequate. The Finance Ministry, 
that eternal opponent of the Defense Ministry, in the shape of 
its spokesman Andrey Astakhov generally agreed that it is hard 
to maintain the army with this money. 
  Attempts were made at the session to pry open some "hidden 
reserves." By hiking the tax on super-profits? It was 
instantly recognized as being naive because only the lazy do not 
conceal the real profits of their enterprises today. What about 
levying a tax on paychecks, not those in publicly financed 
organizations but those in the "private" sector that exceed one 
million and more? What else? To levy an additional (defense) 
tax on commercial banks and, of course, to wring out the 
greatest possible amount from privatizing state property? 
  All agreed that the planned privatization revenues in the 
draft budget are absurdly low. Some other suggestions were 
voiced and accepted for discussion. Still it was obvious to 
everyone that an increase of the budget deficit through 
additional state appropriations is inevitable.... 
  The Finance Ministry spokesman tried to accuse the military 
of slowing reforms, as if suggesting that this is the crux of 
the matter. This was objected to by First Deputy Defense 
Minister Andrey Kokoshin and Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, 
chief of the Russian Federation Armed Forces General Staff. 
They gave facts, too. The general truth that "reforms are 
costly" was illustrated in particular by the following example. 
The lack of funds for converting and recycling arms and 
military equipment makes it necessary to preserve the subunits 
and units to maintain these arms and equipment. For example, 
some 1,500 sailors serve on obsolete nuclear submarines of the 
Northern Fleet. Clearly, you cannot leave a nuclear reactor 
untended. But this is no longer either armed forces or defense. 
This is a security threat in a sense. As is the 40,000 tonnes 
of chemical weapons for whose destruction not a brass copper has 
been earmarked yet. Or take such a question as discharge of 
100,000 officers under the forces reduction plan. This means 
paying each 20 monthly salaries, discharge money, providing 
housing.... There is no money for all that, although that is no 
compensation for the great number of those wishing to accuse the 
army of lacking reform. 
  Generally, one could hear at the session so many depressing 
facts and statistics that someone unprepared and of vulnerable 
mind would be better off not knowing them. Recognizing that it 
is important to probe at the reasons for why we have ended up in 
such a fix, Sergey Yushenkov still urged the audience to think 
about short-term prospects, about what should be done.

<F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] [Announcer Igor Vykhukholev] The State Duma of 
Russia's Federal Assembly also intends to hear a report on the 
situation in the Crimea during this evening's session. 
  [Correspondent Vlada Vishnevskaya] At the request of a 
section of deputies, the Duma's Committees on International 
Affairs, Security, and Defense will today report to the lower 
house on the situation that has developed over the Crimea. A 
substantial proportion of the Duma's session was taken up with a 
debate on a draft resolution setting up parliament's own TV and 
radio service. Diametrically opposed points of view were 
expressed during the debate. Russia's Choice deputies pointed 
out the similarity between the new TV and radio service and the 
former Supreme Soviet's Parliamentary Hour. The Democratic 
Party, the Communists, the Agrarians, and Liberal Democrats, on 
the other hand, said that the Duma should refuse outright to 
grant interviews to the Russian TV and Radio Company and deprive 
it of Duma accreditation. 
  The LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] group walked 
out en masse during the morning session. Explaining the reasons 
for this decision, its leader, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, said: 
  [Begin Zhirinovskiy recording] For six months now the LDPR, 
the party, its leader, the group and the deputies, the entire 
State Duma, and the activities of the supreme legislative body 
have been subjected to a stream of lies and slander. It is not 
just a question of [words indistinct] Svanidze. We are not 
bothered by [word indistinct] as a person. It is the position 
of Russian television and the mass media. The LPDR group cannot 
put up with this any longer. These are (?unacceptable) lies. 
So, we will take a range of steps. [end recording] 
  [Vishnevskaya] The first of these measures was the boycott 
of 
the Duma session. Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's move succeeded, it 
has to be said. In the absence of a quorum the session was 
broken off at midday. 
  [Vykhukholev] The meeting of the lower house resumed at 
1600. 
You will hear the details in our next newscast.

<F P=106> [Sergey Chugayev report: "LDPR Faction Launches Boycott of </F>
Duma Sessions"] 
  [Text] The State Duma's morning plenary session 20 May 
began with a long-expected action: The LDPR [Liberal Democratic 
Party of Russia] faction (60 deputies) walked out of the hall of 
sessions as a protest against TV journalist N. Svanidze's 
well-known report on the "Podrobnosti" ["Details"] program. 
  A similar threat had been delivered at the previous session. 
But on that occasion the LDPR faction in the event decided to 
participate in the Duma's work in exchange for the chamber 
leadership's agreeing to send a letter to the RTR [Russian 
Television and Radio] leadership, suggesting that N. Svanidze be 
dismissed. 
  However, V. Zhirinovskiy, who returned on the eve of the 
session from a tour of the country, evidently proved to be not 
satisfied with this decision, and withdrew his faction from the 
hall anyway. Neither the persuasion of the Communists and the 
Agrarians, nor even a decision to submit as the first item on 
the agenda a draft Duma resolution on the creation of the 
house's own television and radio broadcasting service, was of 
any avail. At the same time V. Zhirinovskiy announced that his 
faction is suing V. Svanidze for 560 million rubles. It was 
also announced that writs are being issued against Ye. Gaydar 
and IZVESTIYA for the publication of the "Russia's Choice" 
leader's article on V. Zhirinovskiy. The session also 
repeatedly heard calls for all Russian television journalists to 
be deprived of their accreditation. However, these calls did 
not meet with support. 
  However, by walking out of the Duma's hall of sessions the 
LDPR faction did not manage to achieve its main goal -- to wreck 
the quorum. On the contrary, supporters of the formation of yet 
another parliamentary television company found themselves facing 
the risk of remaining in the minority, since the "Russia's 
Choice" and "Yabloko" [Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin] factions 
categorically opposed this idea. 
  The main part of the debates was devoted to allegations from 
supporters of parliamentary television of the nonobjectivity of 
media coverage of legislators' activity. In the opinion of 
representatives of factions -- notably the Communist Party -- 
the creation of a Duma television and radio broadcasting company 
would rectify the situation, since it would give all deputies 
the opportunity to address voters directly on two state 
television channels. If the decree is adopted, television 
viewers could have the opportunity to hear roughly 30 minutes' 
of speeches from the State Duma deputies every day.

  [Text] Whether the Treaty on Monetary Union with Russia

the Republic's Council of Ministers, told a public meeting in 
Grodno Oblast. 
  He also stressed that "this is not so much monetary union as 
economic union, and it is being signed not for two or three 
months but for centuries to come. I am confident that this 
union will go ahead, just as I am confident that Ukraine will 
also join it." According to the prime minister, in the near 
future Tajikistan will also state that it is joining the 
economic union.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 96 (586): </F>
Compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by 
Vladimir Shishlin] 
  [Text] The prime ministers of Belarus and Russia, 
Vyacheslav Kebich and Viktor Chernomyrdin, on Thursday met in 
Moscow to discuss the implementation of the two countries' 
monetary union treaty. 
  Kebich said after the meeting, held behind closed doors, 
that 
he had asked Chernomyrdin to speed up the provision of a loan 
Russia had promised to Belarus. "The prime minister of the 
Russian Federation promised assistance in this matter," Kebich 
said. 
  Sources in the Belarusian delegation told Interfax that 
Kebich, in explaining his request for an earlier arrival of the 
200-billion-ruble loan, said that lack of cash forces many of 
Belarus's enterprises to delay the payment of wages to their 
workers. 
  At the same time, the Belarusian delegation said it realized 
that Russia was unable to give Belarus or any other member of 
the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) any loans without 
approval by parliament. The Belarusians also mentioned that a 
Russian 1994 national budget the draft of which the legislature 
has passed at the first reading would limit Russia's total loans 
to other CIS countries to 185 billion rubles. 
  The above-mentioned sources in the Belarusian delegation 
said 
the Russian government had assured Belarus that it would do its 
best to provide the loan earlier but had given no specific dates. 
  Kebich said that "today it is extremely important not only 
to 
carry through the unification of the monetary systems of Belarus 
and Russia but also to find ways of forming a political and 
economic union of the Slav states." Talking to reporters, he 
said that such a union might subsequently be joined by 
Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and other CIS countries. In his view, 
the union member states need not have a single currency, namely 
the Russian ruble."Setting up an interstate bank would be enough 
to solve (their) economic problems," he said. 
  Kebich said disagreements between Belarus and Russia over 
the 
status of the National Bank of Belarus (NBB) remain an obstacle 
to the materialization of the two countries' monetary union. 
The Russian Finance Ministry wants the NBB to be a branch of 
the Central Bank of Russia, which, Kebich said, Belarus cannot 
accept. 
  He also believes the exchange of Belarusian rubles for 
Russian ones by bank transfer could be done at a rate of four or 
five Belarussian rubles to one Russian ruble. He said the rate 
was based on the cost of consumer goods in the two countries, he 
said. 
  In the meantime, NBB chief Stanislav Bogdankevich called the 
conditions made by Russia at the second round of monetary union 
talks unacceptable. He told a news conference in Minsk that he 
was against Belarus and Russia having a single budget. As for 
Russia's offer to provide credits to close Belarus's budget 
deficits, he described that as "totally unacceptable." Apart 
from that, Bogdankevich still considers Article 5 of the 
monetary union treaty unconstitutional. "I did not initial that 
fundamental article, which provides for what is effective 
abolition of the National Bank of Belarus," he said. "Therefore 
the document is no more than a letter of intent." "The treaty 
cannot be signed on those terms. Negotiations are needed to take 
us back to our mutually advantageous positions," he said. 
  Kebich's spokesman Vladimir Zametalin said the prime 
minister 
considered it his moral duty to carry through the work he had 
begun two years ago despite any pressure or resistance to 
Belarus's union with Russia. "What is today needed for real 
unification are not declarations or promises but persistent 
practical measures," Zametalin quoted Kebich as saying.

<F P=106> [Report by Konstantin Smirnov under the "Ruble Zone" rubric: </F>
"What Is Healthy for a Prime Minister, Is Deadly for a Banker"] 
  [Text] In Belorussia [Belarus], the struggle has 
heightened in the top echelons over the Republic's joining the 
ruble zone. The Russian and Belorussian prime ministers, Viktor 
Chernomyrdin and Vyacheslav Kebich, have agreed in Moscow to 
step up Belorussia's "ruble Anschluss," while Stanislav 
Bogdankevich, Belorussian National Bank chairman, told a 
briefing in Minsk yesterday that the bilateral treaty on the 
unification of money systems was "stillborn." 
  The clash between the prime minister and Belorussia's chief 
banker over the republic's "rublization" cannot be called a 
sensation. While Vyacheslav Kebich, as a high-ranking Minsk 
official put it, is ready "to lie under a roller" for the sake 
of the Republic's joining the Russian Central Bank's zone of 
responsibility, Bogdankevich has always been skeptical about 
attempts to solve Belorussia's monetary problems at the expense 
of the Russian ruble (which has been an open secret for all). 
In particular, a bill on the introduction of a national 
currency, drawn up at the Belorussian National Bank, has been 
sitting at the Belorussian parliament for nearly a year now. It 
is symptomatic, however, that the National Bank chairman has for 
the first time made public his flatly negative attitude to a 
ruble union with Russia. 
  Stanislav Bogdankevich's demarche may be attributed at least 
to two reasons: the corporate and the national ones. First, 
Belorussia's "ruble Anschluss" is possible only by lowering the 
status of the Belorussian National Bank to a branch of the 
Russian Central Bank, which will remain the sole money creation 
center of the two states. If Belorussia opts for its own 
currency, however, and summons up the courage to launch economic 
reform, the role of its National Bank in shaping its economic 
policy is bound to grow. Hence, a clear conclusion for 
Bogdankevich -- it is better to be a Belorussian Gerashchenko 
than an assistant of Gerashchenko from Moscow. 
  Second, Bogdankevich's statement that the ruble union with 
Russia is unwelcome may boost the presidential bids of 
Vyacheslav Kebich's rivals, primarily former Belorussian 
parliament speaker Stanislav Shushkevich, who hold a negative 
view on the Republic's accession to the ruble zone. 
  To all appearances, the Russian Government will not react 
officially to Stanislav Bogdankevich's latest statement. 
However, if in the end the currency unification of Russia and 
Belorussia fails to materialize, benefits granted to Belorussia, 
first of all the lifting of Russian export tariffs on 
commodities destined for the Republic starting 1 May, may be 
cancelled.

  [Text] As we have already informed, a Belarusian military 
delegation headed by Defense Minister Pavel Kazlowski paid a 
one-day working visit to Lithuania on 19 May. The delegation 
held meetings with Seimas [parliament] Chairman C. Jursenas and 
Defense Minister L. Linkevicius. According to our correspondent 
in Vilnius, it was resolved to create working groups of both 
states for preparing documents on cooperation between the 
Lithuanian and Belarusian Ministries of Defense. During the 
news conference, held at the Lithuanian Seimas at the end of the 
visit, L. Linkevicius stated that the meeting with P. Kazlowski 
was devoted to issues related to the formation of a structure of 
both states' defense systems and other common problems. 
"Notwithstanding the fact that Belarus participates in the CIS 
collective system of security, there were no barriers to a 
normal dialogue," Linkevicius said.

<F P=106> [Dispatch from Chisinau] </F>
  [Text] Mr. Mircea Snegur, president of the Republic of 
Moldova, denied that relations between the Republic of Moldova 
and Romania have cooled down of late. In an interview granted 
to Radio Free Europe, he said that this idea, which is being 
intensively aired, does not correspond with reality. We will 
squash this idea very soon, President Snegur said. 
  Positively assessing the post-electoral social and political 
situation in the Republic of Moldova, he said that it enabled 
the country's leadership to start a dialogue with the Tiraspol 
authorities. Referring to the issue of granting a special 
status to the rayons on the left bank of the Dniester River, 
President Snegur said that a possible draft bill in this respect 
will take into consideration a decentralization and the 
assignment of functions to local self-administration bodies, but 
within the framework of a single state, the Republic of Moldova, 
with a single constitution and foreign policy and a single Army 
and police force. Mircea Snegur said that the negotiations will 
be difficult, because the Dniester side insists upon the idea of 
federalization or confederalization. He also emphasized the 
need to solve all differences by political means. 
  At the same time, President Snegur reiterated that the 
withdrawal of the 14th Army of the Russian Federation from the 
territory of the Republic of Moldova should not be synchronized 
with the granting of a special legal status to the rayons on the 
left bank of the Dniester. 
  In the aforementioned interview, President Mircea Snegur 
reiterated that, within the CIS bodies, the leadership of the 
Republic of Moldova only participates in the discussion of 
economic problems and does not participate in the discussion of 
military issues.

  [Text] The Russian-Moldovan talks on the status and 
pullout of the 14th Russian Army called for mid-May have been 
moved back. There are substantial changes in the composition of 
the Moldovan delegation, primarily connected with the 
resignation of its head, Anatoliy Taranu, extraordinary and 
plenipotentiary ambassador of the Republic of Moldova to Russia. 
He is supposed to be replaced by Nicolae Osmochescu, deputy 
foreign minister of the Republic of Moldova and international 
law specialist, who has been asked to lead a group of experts 
from Chisinau at the talks with Tiraspol. 
  The Moldovan delegation decided to make some concessions in 
the latest round of talks. Backing down on its previous demand 
that the Army be withdrawn by 1 July 1994, it suggested that the 
withdrawal be carried through during one or two years. In the 
opinion of Anatoliy Tiranu, it is not ruled out that Moldova 
could decide on even greater concessions: from approving a 
longer duration of the Army's stay on its territory to assigning 
it the status of a military base.

  [Text] The Press Service of the organization "Ukraine's 
State Independence" has got hold of a document under the title 
"A Special Status for the Dniester Region (Considerations on 
Possible Legal Foundations)," which had been compiled by a 
"plenipotentiary representative of the president of the Russian 
Federation to the negotiations on the political settlement of 
the conflict in the Moldovan Republic's Dniester Region." 
Russia proposes that "a special status" for the Dniester Region 
be established by means of which Russia could actively influence 
Moldova's domestic and external policy. In accordance with the 
document handed over to the Moldovan side for consideration, the 
elected legislative body of the Dniester Region "may suspend the 
action on its territory of laws and normative acts of the 
Moldovan Republic, if they are at variance with the special 
status...." (Section 7). Thus, a foreign state grants a regular 
administrative region of sovereign Moldova the status of a fully 
autonomous enclave. The 10 sections of the Russian project are 
aimed at creating a separate state, which will be Moscow's 
vassal.

  [Text] Brussels, 20 May -- Kazakhstan is the second CIS 
state -- following Ukraine -- to have finished drawing up an 
agreement on partnership and cooperation with the European 
Union. This document was initialled in Brussels on Friday [20 
May]. The ITAR-TASS correspondent learned in the Kazakhstan 
embassy that the agreement will be signed by President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan and the European Commission chairman in 
the coming months. 
  The agreement represents a political document encompassing 
diverse forms of cooperation. It lays the basis for development 
of relations between Kazakhstan and the European Union and is 
designed to promote the expansion of bilateral cooperation 
between this Central Asian republic and each of the 12 countries 
of the European Union. This is essentially the first agreement 
between independent Kazakhstan and such a major international 
association as the European Union. 
  Two more joint documents are now being drawn up to regulate 
relations between the sides in individual spheres of 
cooperation, and in particular, in issues relating to power 
engineering and nuclear materials.

  [Text] A top Russian Space Agency official has told 
INTERFAX that Kazakhstan had, in his view, been taking liberties 
if its interpretation of the agreement on the main principles 
and conditions of the use of the Baykonur launch site signed 
between Boris Yeltsin and Nursultan Nazarbayev on 28 March was 
anything to go by. 
  The Moscow agreement fixed Russia's annual payments to 
Kazakhstan for the lease of Baykonur at 115 million U.S. dollars 
to include space facilities and associated services. 
  However a Kazakhstan governmental team said Thursday [19 
May] 
it had prepared a draft for putting that agreement into 
practise, a draft which set annual payments of 480 mln dlrs. 
According to Almaty, the 115 mln dlrs were a fixed payment, not 
the whole sum Russia must pay Kazakhstan for its space 
facilities. 
  The RSA official, who had been directly involved in the 
drafting of the Moscow agreement, told Interfax that he was "at 
a complete loss" as to where the 480 million dollar figure, 
which completely altered the Moscow agreement, had come from. 
  However, he said it would be "premature to dispute the draft 
before the lease agreement itself had been ratified by the 
Russian and Kazakh parliaments and had come into force." 
  The official also said that RSA chief Yuriy Koptev would be 
contacting Kazakh Vice-Premier Galym Abilsiitov regarding the 
size of the lease payment for Baykonur. 
  Kazakh officials are currently putting the finishing touches 
to the document before referring it to Prime Minister Sergey 
Tereschenko on 23 May. They say the document should be ready 
for signing by the prime ministers of both countries on 15 June 
1994. 
  However, the RSA said that date was unlikely.

Television announcer Andrey Skryabin. 
  Niyazov is shown seated at a desk in a large room with 
journalists seated at two rows of tables. After greeting the 
viewers, President Niyazov answers questions put by a number of 
journalists on, among other things, the the development of 
Turkmenistan, a Euro-Asian union, cooperation within CIS and 
bilateral relations, debts, social protection for the 
population, economic plans in the near future, privatization, 
trade unions, relations with the East, and state support for 
agriculture. 
  Niyazov welcomes the journalists and thanks them for showing 
a keen interest in the political and economic changes taking 
place in Turkmenistan. He then says: 
  "It is important that we see Russia not as a state that has 
already become separate, but as the main and leading force of 
the CIS, whose position strikes us very much by its equality, by 
mutually beneficial cooperation, by respect for the sovereignty 
of the independent states that have been formed. Therefore, we 
-- all members of the government present here -- cordially 
welcome you to Turkmenistan, and I am ready to reply to your 
questions." 
  Skryabin asks the first question: "What development concept 
do you adhere to? Which is the most acceptable to you for the 
development of your state?" 
  Niyazov replies: "We chose a secular, democratic path of 
development, which is laid down in our constitution. The 
constitution was discussed nationwide and was adopted by the 
mejlis after a referendum." 
  The next question is asked by Andrey Polishchuk from 
NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA: "Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev 
proposed not that long ago that a Euro-Asian union should be 
formed. I would like to know your personal point of view on 
that proposal." 
  Niyazov replies: "What is that Euro-Asian union? Does 
anybody know what sort of union that is? Is it just a sign to 
replace the CIS, or is it a new, natural kind of commonwealth or 
a new confederation? What is it? I simply do not see the 
mechanism, function, or task of that Euro-Asian union, and I 
fail to understand why a group arose immediately that supported 
it, a group that rejected it. But I can say just one thing: the 
CIS has begun to be formed as a community of independent states. 
After the collapse of the Soviet Union, it was very difficult 
to form independent states, to acquire political independence, 
economic independence, to establish every state. And the 
process is difficult now since we are so bound together by 70 
years of economic ties we cannot tear ourselves away from one 
another. But that process must happen now. History cannot be 
turned back to its original stage. It's my opinion that 
everybody should cooperate with each other on equal and mutually 
beneficial terms, of course, without harming each other. It 
even occurs in families that brothers can have their own 
economic calculations, but one does not get by at the expense of 
the other. 
  "We support the strengthening of the Commonwealth of 
Independent States but on equal terms. Therefore, I think at 
the first stage there should be more concrete bilateral 
cooperation, bilateral agreements between the states of the CIS, 
and the CIS itself should through framework agreements determine 
overall direction. Therefore, objectively, it is simply unable 
to create strict structures now. We must take account of the 
realities. The Commonwealth should exist, but it has to go 
through a transitional stage in which each of us has to overcome 
difficulties and not on the basis of mutual accusations but 
taking account of the real interests of each. In this 
connection, I would like to say an economic court of the 
Commonwealth was formed. Today, the countries of the CIS owe 
Turkmenistan 1.3 billion dollars. Ukraine owes around 800 
million dollars; Georgia owes more than 200 million dollars. 
Many countries owe us, but we are not issuing ultimatums, nor 
are we appealing to any courts to have a concrete solution to 
that. We realize all countries are going through an economic 
crisis. We simply ask that the debt is acknowledged and 
formulated through state agreements, that there is 
accountability. The former Union no longer exists. Today we 
are buying goods at world prices from all countries of the CIS, 
but when fuel and energy resources are at issue, a more casual 
approach is taken. Therefore, there should be equality in 
everything." 
  Correspondent Albert Belyayev from "Kultura" asks Niyazov 
about the role of culture in the political course pursued by 
Turkmenistan, and what percentage of the national budget is 
allocated for cultural purposes. 
  Niyazov replies: "I will tell you briefly that we must 
develop our national culture, and for that purpose, we allocate 
seven to 10 percent of the budget to culture." He adds that 
Turkmenistan had great respect for the Russian culture, which 
has had a very strong impact on it, but in his view every 
country should be able to absorb those aspects of the world 
culture that are the most appropriate to its traditions and 
customs. 
  He then is asked by Natalya Polezhayeva from ROSSIYSKAYA 
GAZETA whether the fact that there were numerous streets, 
villages, towns, and monuments dedicated to him did not indicate 
a beginning of a personality cult. 
  Niyazov replies: "I would like you to understand that a 
personality cult cannot emerge in a free society, with a market 
economy, private property, and other systems. There is no such 
thing. But I can tell you that since I started working in 
Turkmenistan in 1985 there was not a single arrest for political 
dissent. There is not a single political prison in 
Turkmenistan. There is no violence. Right now we are going 
through a transition period. And during a transition period 
there is a need for a national leader who, together with his 
like-minded allies, must carry out all these major state and 
social changes. I am not talking about myself. Maybe if there 
was someone else, the attitude would have been the same." 
  Correspondent Skryabin asks Niyazov about his portrait on 
the 
national currency and about his attitude to the celebration of 
his birthday as a national holiday. 
  Niyazov says: "I must tell you that we have had lengthy 
discussions about bank notes. There were proposals from the 
rank and file, but I was against it for a long time. There have 
been enough major figures in the 800-year history of 
Turkmenistan who could have been depicted on banknotes." He 
adds that unfortunately no realistic portraits of these figures 
have been left. And when a meeting of more than 1,000 Turkmen 
elders proposed to have his portrait on the national currency, 
Niyazov "took it as an honor, not flattery." "There is no need 
for false modesty. It was an honor for me that the elders have 
proposed to have my portrait on the national currency." He then 
adds that in fact it was not his portrait that was important to 
him, but rather the exchange rate of the national currency. 
  As for his birthday, Niyazov says he did not want and does 
not want any celebrations. He says he had even drafted a decree 
that would have banned the celebration of his birthday for the 
duration of his term in office. However, parliament has 
rejected it. He said he would still try to pass another law 
that would allow people, if they so wish, to celebrate his 
birthday after the end of his term in office. 
  Asked by Anatoliy Yurkov from RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA about social 
protection provisions in Turkmenistan, Niyazov says: 
  "From the first day of the creation of an independent 
Turkmenistan, we have decided to carry out reforms, state and 
structural changes only if they have no negative effect on the 
majority of the population. This is our main criteria. In the 
process of political and economic reform, we always measure 
everything against the social protection of the population. 
Within the first year we said to the people that everyone would 
have free gas and electricity. This is what we produce here, 
and this is what we can offer to other countries without 
depriving ourselves. 
  "The same thing with water. We have water and the 
possibility to provide the population with good drinking water 
free of charge. This is not luxury. Once we freed our people 
from this burden, it had the opportunity to use its income for 
other needs. At the same time we also had the opportunity to 
increase people's wages. But the state is not wasting the money 
either. We have cut our investment in the industry. We have 
told the industry to develop itself through profits. We only 
provide assistance to projects of national importance and 
profitability, such as the building of a railway from 
Turkmenistan to Iran, another railway from western Turkmenistan 
along the coastline to Russia, and another one from eastern 
Turkmenistan to Afghanistan, the building of new airports, new 
sea ports, and communications systems. I think that 
Turkmenistan will continue to develop its infrastructure, but 
only by using local raw materials, such as textiles, gas 
refining, chemical products, and agriculture. As for heavy 
machine-building, it does not make sense to build a tractor or a 
car plant, or an aircraft plant in Turkmenistan. It simply does 
not make economic sense." 
  Anatoliy Druzenko from IZVESTIYA then asks why, since all 
leaders of new independent states come from the socialist past 
and could have gotten together and sorted everything out, this 
is not happening. 
  Niyazov replies: "One must be a realist. There is no turning 
back. If we say that we are all independent, be it politically 
or economically, let us then have proper relations, rather then 
having a union and someone as a coordinator. It does not work 
anymore. There is no turning back. We may come to some sort of 
integration, but right now everyone must live through this 
disintegration. This is the most effective disintegration." 
  Niyazov then says everyone must live through this difficult 
period, but there must be a joint effort to make it work, rather 
than look for something new in the light of present 
difficulties. 
  He says: "We favor joint spiritual values, economic links, 
political links. We need them. But they must be civilized. I 
must tell you that the latest CIS meeting went very well, and 
many good decisions were taken. There was a divergence of 
opinions, however. We must take into consideration various 
opinions. We cannot force everyone to have the same opinion. 
I, as a representative of my nation, may have a different 
opinion on one or other question. So, why must I sign something 
I feel will not be accepted here? This is why we must not rush. 
The CIS is a slow process and will not spring up from a single 
resolution. It must remain voluntary and mutually beneficial." 
  Dmitriy Murzin from FINANSOVYE IZVESTIYA then asks Niyazov 
to outline his vision of the economic structure in Turkmenistan. 
  Niyazov says: "As for the internal economic structure, we 
are 
not in a hurry to implement privatization. We are afraid to 
privatize trade outlets in the first instance, as you did it in 
Moscow, because then state resources have to be pumped into 
these trade outlets since there are no producers. We have 
decided to create producers of goods in the first instance. We 
have already started privatizing public catering outlets and 
communal services. As for factories and plants, all works of up 
to 500 employees will be sold through auctions, to both 
foreigners and our own people, but with a guarantee to provide 
their own raw materials and to improve production for the next 
five years. They will have to abide by Turkmen laws and pay 
taxes. This suits us, because it creates jobs, the state 
receives an income, and like this the industry will be fully 
privatized. As for large enterprises of more than 500 to 1,000 
employees, 50 percent of their shares will be sold off, while 
the state will retain the remaining shares for the next five 
years. We will sell off 49 percent of shares. 
  "We already have a large number of land owners, and we have 
also distributed more than 150,000 hectares of land. I am a 
land owner myself. I have 58 hectares of land. I plant and 
grow there. We have allowed members of the government and 
ministers to have private property." 
  He then adds that they have developed a number of laws to 
prevent ministers and other individuals in positions of power 
from using state assets and funds for personal gain. 
  "We are not destroying cotton growing and cattle breeding 
collective farms, some of which are very profitable, where 
employees have a high standard of living. These ones we will 
keep. However, all the unprofitable ones will be sold off. We 
are setting up new agricultural units. We can give up to 50 
hectares of land to those who want new land. If an individual 
wants up to 500 hectares, he must sign a declaration that he 
will produce something on this land for at least two years, 
rather than leaving it to his children, while the money is 
there. No, this is not allowed." 
  Yuriy Sovtsov from TRUD asks then whether Niyazov envisages 
the role of emerging trade unions as his opponents or his 
supporters. 
  Niyazov replies: "It is true that trade unions had no 
tangible influence on every day life of workers. They may have 
had some political influence, but as far as workers' lives were 
concerned, this was well known all across the Union... [pauses]. 
There were no decent canteens or accommodation or any other 
proper service on factories, but no one took care of this. 
Instead, everyone was busy politicking. The link between grass 
route level trade unions and workers was severed. When the 
financial support disappeared they disintegrated somewhat as 
well. But a new trade unionist movement has been set up through 
membership contributions, which is self-sufficient, and workers 
have also become more demanding. Individual trade unions have 
been given new functions. They are in the process of being set 
up. We are supporting them, not financially but as a body that 
takes care." 
  Niyazov is then asked by Valentin Simonov from KOMSOMOLSKAYA 
PRAVDA to tell -- honestly, if he can -- whether he regards the 
absence of criticism of him in the local press as an advantage 
or as a hindrance to his state activities. 
  Niyazov says: "Not only I, but many others have difficulty 
accepting public criticism. We must be honest with ourselves. 
I do not accept personal criticism of, say, my tastes, but if I 
am criticized as a public figure for some mistakes in the 
economic or political management, I can accept it easily. These 
are two different things. 
  "But when personal insults are used to pad out public 
criticism, this is not normal criticism. Criticism must be 
civilised." 
  He then says that from his experience of traveling abroad, 
he 
can say he has never seen anywhere else the kind of criticism 
mated out by the media in Moscow. He goes on to say that this 
confused kind of intermingled criticism of personal and public 
qualities in political figures comes from the 70 years of Soviet 
rule. In his view, only when his ministers will not have to 
worry about their financial future -- for example, become 
private owners of industrial or other estates -- will they be 
able to think independently. He says: 
  "Even if I encourage criticism right now, they will not 
criticize me. Maybe five or 10 will. Therefore, it would be 
silly to artificially create criticism of myself. Does this 
mean that if I want to be called a democrat, I must create an 
opposition, pluralism, set up a multiparty system, create a 
group that will try to get to the top on the basis of the right 
to criticize, rather than on the basis of its own program, a 
program that would be to the benefit of the people?" 
  Nail Bikkenin from the journal SVOBODNAYA MYSL then asks him 
to explain how the specific characteristics of the East apply to 
Turkmenistan. 
  Replying to the question, Niyazov says that East and West 
had 
different cultural traditions and often did not understand each 
other. There were good and bad people both in the East and 
West, and it would be wrong to let the Russians' opinion of 
Turkmenistanis be influenced by stereotypes. 
  Aleksandr Lisin of VECHERNYAYA MOSKVA tells Niyazov that 
Muscovites are interested to know more about his personality and 
asks whether there is a politician or some other famous man whom 
he regards as his role model. 
  Niyazov says there is no single person who has influenced 
him 
in this way, but adds: "Since my childhood I have regarded as 
my ideal only the ideas of the Communist Party, and people 
should not be judged too severely for being impressed by them. 
But then I discovered that these ideas cannot be be implemented 
at the present stage and that our real mentality is very unlike 
the things we say." 
  He goes on to say that equality, peace, and cooperation 
will always remain mankind's great ideals. 
  Niyazov then says that when he joined the USSR Politburo in 
1985, he used to admire Mikhail Gorbachev, but his attitude to 
that leader gradually changed by 1989-90. "I like certain 
things about Churchill's politics, some things about 
Mitterrand's, and some about Li Peng's. Generally speaking, for 
some reason, my only ideal is Friedrich Engels: when I read his 
works, I think they are logical and consistent, and he impresses 
me as a philosopher and political economist; he rather than 
Marx. That's about it." 
  The last question is from Aleksandr Kharlamov of SELSKAYA 
ZHIZN, who asks about Niyazov's attitude to state subsidies for 
agriculture. 
  Niyazov replies: "In Turkmenistan, we know that at this 
transitional stage, agriculture will not survive without 
subsidies. Profits from the sale of oil and gas should be 
redistributed. This happens in all civilized states. We should 
not say: this branch is not profit- making, so we shall close it 
down." 
  Skryabin then thanks Niyazov, who says in conclusion: 
  "Our way of political and economic development, our moral 
and 
cultural values are typical of our own people. I am not 
imposing them on you and not preaching them to you, just telling 
you about us. At the same time, we respect all states and their 
form of development, their political and economic reforms." 
  Thanking the journalists who attended the meeting, he adds: 
  "We regard Russia as a great country with which we shall 
maintain friendly relations whatever may happen. It is our 
long-term policy to respect the policy Russia has chosen and to 
cooperate with it on a mutually beneficial basis."

  [Text] Vladikavkaz May 21 TASS -- The situation in parts of 
north Ossetia under the state of emergency remains tense, 
according to reports from military sources. 
  Shooting broke out five times in the Prigorod district last 
night. On the whole, the situation is under control of the 
Russian army and local law enforcement bodies. 
  Head of the temporary administration Vladimir Lozovoy said 
in 
his address to the population that "attacks on civilians and 
police and army check points and hostage taking continue in the 
zone of the state of emergency. It is outrageous when members 
of local administrations become organisers of and accomplices in 
unlawful actions. Heads of bodies of power and power structures 
who are unable or unwilling to carry out their duties to ensure 
law and order will be called to account. I call on the citizens 
of North Ossetia and Ingushetia to resist provocations of 
extremists who use any means to thwart the settlement of the 
conflict."

  [Text] Krasnodar May 20 TASS -- Regional heads of North 
Caucasian republics attending a conference in Baku have appealed 
to the Russian president, asking him to lift sanctions against 
Abkhazia. 
  Participants in the conference believe that lifting economic 
sanctions will step up the process of the settlement of the 
conflict in the region. Head of the republics of Adygeya, 
Dagestan, Ingushetia, Kabardino-Balkaria, North Ossetia, 
Karachayevo-Cherkessia, the Krasnodar, Stavropol, Rostov regions 
and South Ossetia took into account that after signing 
agreements with the participation of the Russian Federation 
conditions for normal and stable life are being created in the 
region. A tendency for the restoration of cultural and economic 
ties has been growing. 
  This question was not included in the agenda of the 
conference and was raised in the course of discussions, 
journalists were told after the conference since they were not 
admitted. 
  The conference was attended by Russian Minister for Affairs 
of Nationalities and Regional Policy, Nikolay Yegorov, who 
answered journalists' questions. 
  Participants adopted an address to President Yeltsin in 
connection with his message to the people of the Northern 
Caucasus on the occasion of the 130th anniversary since the end 
of the Caucasian war. The address says that the people of the 
Northern Caucasus accepted Yeltsin's message with gratitude, 
believing that by the mercy of fate the Russian president put 
the last stop to the Caucasian war.

  [Text] Groznyy (Chechnya) May 21 TASS -- The Chechen 
Republic marked the 130th anniversary since the end of the 
Caucasian war with a parade of the best units of the emerging 
Chechen army in its capital city Groznyy on Saturday. 
  Dzhokhar Dudayev, republican president and 
commander-in-chief

Valentin Vlasov, 48, to be its chairman. Up to now, Vlasov has 
been mayor of Archangelsk. Valentin Vlasov considers the 
establishment of a government is not merely another change of 
labels, but an attempt to set up an effective executive body 
which matches up to contemporary requirements.

<F P=106> [G. Kukevich video report; from the "Dalniy Vostok" program] </F>
  [Text] This event is significant not only for the Amur 
Oblast residents, but for all of the state. Up till now, there 
was not a single border marker at the eastern Russian-Chinese 
border, neither at a land nor a river zone. Today, we are 
adopting a practice of organizing state borders that is 
generally accepted in the world. [Video shows interview with A. 
G. Laskov, chief of demarcation group No. 5] 
  [Begin Laskov recording] There are two demarcation groups 
working in our oblast -- Nos. 4 and 5. I can also say that the 
length of the border on the Amur Oblast territory is 1,281 km. 
The demarcation working groups, which are part of the 
commission, started field work in early May last year. We were 
preparing foundations for border markers, and determined their 
topographic coordinates. Now, the new stage is erecting the 
border markers. Overall, our group will erect 48 border markers 
in Amur Oblast, and group No. 4 will erect 50. In other words, 
98 border markers are to be erected in 1994-95. The 
hydrographers group will determine the location of the main 
fairway. Appropriate documents are being drafted on all of 
these points, and the end result of our work is a protocol 
describing the location of the state border line. After this 
work is concluded, the border with China will be as in the rest 
of the civilized world. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Anatoliy Yershov report: "Nizhniy Novgorod Governor </F>
Rumored Dismissed"] 
  [Text] Nizhniy Novgorod -- Over the past few days Nizhniy 
Novgorod newspaper editorial offices and the radio and 
television have been sent on official oblast administration 
notepaper copies of a letter from Governor B. Nemtsov asking the 
Russian president to relieve both him and Ye. Krestyaninov, the 
president's representative in Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast, of their 
duties. 
  The reason for this resignation is that economic reform in 
the oblast has allegedly been a disaster, a wave of 
anti-Semitism is on the rise, and, under these conditions, 
"people must not be fooled any longer...." Whereas before there 
were sometimes rumors about Governor B. Nemtsov's possibly 
transferring to work in Moscow, this time the "resignation 
question" regarding the two oblast leaders has turned out to be 
a crude forgery. 
  IZVESTIYA was told by Ye. Krestyaninov that the appropriate 
organs will now be investigating just who sent these letters to 
the mass media.

newspapers in Rostov Oblast have been left without their 
favorite periodicals. "Molot," the biggest publishing house in 
Russia's South, has discontinued printing such newspapers as 
ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI, RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA, ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, and 
SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA. Awaiting their turn are GUDOK, SOVETSKIY

<F P=106> [Article by V. Nugmanov: "From the City Soviet Session: </F>
Budget Deficit and Emergency Budget"] 
  [Text] Budget deficit and emergency budget--these were 
undoubtedly the words most frequently heard on the first day of 
the 18th session of the Kazan City Soviet which opened 
yesterday. Indeed, the city's economy had a deficit overall of 
6.3 billion rubles [R] at the end of 1993, and predictions for 
the current year show this could grow to R181 billion! City 
authorities have therefore been forced to adopt emergency 
financial measures. True, inroads have somehow managed to be 
made in mending the deficiencies of last year's budget, 
primarily through diligence on the part of the tax inspectorate 
and efforts by the city administration and a number of 
enterprises. But now, how do we "leap over the financial abyss" 
of the current year? 
  V. Titov, director of the city's Finance Administration, 
cited a number of emergency measures in his presentation during 
the session aimed at extricating the city from its crisis: 
replenishment of the working capital of city enterprises, the 
introduction of promissory notes in clearing-account 
transactions, and even state regulation of prices and wages, etc. 
  In her supplementary report, T. Antropova, chairman of the 
Planning and Budget Commission of the city soviet, also 
attempted to locate nontraditional sources of revenue, not 
overlooking the prospect of conducting lotteries and auctions, 
or even of collecting revenue from the Kazan Racetrack. 
  Deputies taking part in the debates also proposed their 
solutions for fortifying the "financial health" of the city. 
Thus, G. Naumov called for the establishment of a municipal 
bank with all its appropriate infrastructure, following the 
example of a number of Russian cities. D. Galyautdinov focused 
attention on "hot" facilities that "fell out" of the 1994 
budget. In particular, in his view there is no way Kazan can do 
without a new trolleybus depot and a number of new automated 
telephone exchanges. 
  Adoption of an emergency budget will assist in resolving a 
number of burning issues. Following the allocation of R6.4 
billion to meet the city's electric transport needs, the 
acquisition and replacement of 48 streetcars and 55 trolleybuses 
and the modernization of water and sewage networks become 
entirely real prospects. 
  G. Kobelev, chairman of the Budget and Planning Commission 
of 
the Tatarstan Republic Supreme Soviet, then took the floor. 
Along with the stunning information that the total nonpayments 
amount throughout the republic had reached the astronomical 
figure of R1 trillion, he provided favorable information 
concerning the expected gradual lowering of the interest rate on 
bank credits by the end of the year to 190-100 percent, the 
planned adoption of a number of new Tatarstan Republic laws, and 
an anticrisis program.

Wednesday [18 May] night, the government's spokesman Ain Saarna 
told ETA on Thursday. Both Ministers were to present their

work of the government, Saarna said. 
  The coalition board met to discuss the situation in the

resign. Clarity is necessary not only to the government, but 
also the nation, the board said. [passage omitted]

Olesk have stated that they will continue work in the government 
on the basis of the [1992] coalition agreement. These ERSP

  [Text] The presidential press service forwarded to Estonian 
Radio a statement by President Lennart Meri in response to the 
joint statement from the Riigikogu speaker and the prime 
minister. According to the joint statement issued by Riigikogu 
Speaker Ulo Nugis and Prime Minister Mart Laar, the president's 
welcoming speech [on 17 May] to the diplomatic corps accredited 
to Estonia did not reflect the official position of the Republic 
of Estonia. 
  President Lennart Meri notes with regret in his response 
that 
the prime minister's attempt to embroil the Riigikogu speaker in 
political games may turn the current government crisis into a 
constitutional crisis. The president states the text of the 
welcoming speech was drafted by Toivo Klaar, head of the Foreign 
Ministry's foreign policy department, at his request and with 
the knowledge of the foreign minister. According to the 
president, this fact could not have been unknown to Prime 
Minister Laar, and if it was, it is a sign of impermissible 
shortcomings within the state apparatus. The president 
considers particularly dangerous for the Estonian national 
security policy the fact that five days before the conference of 
the foreign ministers of the countries on the Baltic Sea, the 
prime minister has begun to resolve the government crisis with 
foreign policy arguments, involving top state officials and 
incomplete information. 
  In his statement the president says a government crisis is a 
customary manifestation of parliamentary democracy. The 
president considers it impermissible to set party political 
interests above the national interest of the Republic of Estonia.

  [Text] Tallinn, May 20, BNS -- President Lennart Meri on 
Thursday [19 May] received Russian Ambassador to Estonia 
Alexander Trofimov, the president's press service told BNS. The 
ambassador informed Meri that Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev is 
going to take part in the upcoming Baltic Council foreign 
ministers' conference in Tallinn. A time was set for a meeting 
between Meri and the Russian foreign minister. 
  Meri hoped the forthcoming conference offers a good chance 
to 
drop from the agenda and regard as closed the issue of military 
retirees. Under Estonian legislation, military pensioners are 
issued residence permits in accordance with the aliens law and 
the government order annexed to it. The applications will be 
considered on a case-by-case basis. The president suggested 
that, on humanitarian grounds, the procedure might begin with 
the eldest applicants. 
  According to Trofimov's information, there are at present 
5,170 Russian military retirees residing in Estonia aged 60 and 
over; the 50-59 age group comprises 3,870 people; and 1,660 
retired military are below 50 years of age. The Russian 
ambassador announced that 43,000 aliens residing in Estonia have 
Russian citizenship. 
  The parties also exchanged thoughts about the activity to 
date of the Remigration Fund, the president's press service 
informs.

<F P=106> [Article by Liga Laizane: "Size of Defence Forces Decreased"] </F>
  [Text] Riga, 13 May -- The number of soldiers engaged in 
mandatory military service in the Defense Forces has been 
reduced because the state lacks financial means for their 
support, DIENA was told by Juris Kvelde, state secretary in the 
Defense Ministry. From the beginning of May, the mobilization 
of the mandatory state military service is canceled, due to the 
fact that the number of soldiers currently serving in the Army 
exceeds the number envisioned by the state budget for 1994 -- 
4,323. In the beginning of April, there were 4,600 soldiers 
serving in the Defense Forces. 
  The Chief of the Defense Forces Headquarters, Juris Arness, 
told DIENA that the reduction will be even larger -- the forces 
will be limited to 3,891 soldiers. According to him, the budget 
foresees a 10 percent reduction in the number of mobilized 
soldiers. However, the persons exceeding the number fixed by 
the Ministry of Finance cannot be released if they have not 
served a specific period of time. 
  As DIENA was told by J. Kvelde, Latvia does not have any 
document or plan other than the defense concept adopted in 1992, 
which determines the number and development of separate 
structures of the Defense Forces. It specifies that the defense 
forces should number 9,000 people. The only law that 
effectively regulates this number is the state budget law for 
1994 prepared by the Ministry of Finance. Raisa Bika, 
representative of the Budget Department in the Ministry of 
Finances, reported to DIENA that they have determined the number 
of soldiers for which support is available, and that the Saeima 
[parliament] has adopted this law. 
  Officers of the Defense Forces are of the opinion that the 
reduction will have a negative effect on the activities of the 
Forces. Janis Adamsons, commander of the border guards brigade, 
told DIENA that at present they do not feel a lack of manpower, 
but in the autumn there will be approximately 750 fewer people. 
The largest segment of the mobilized soldiers -- 3,000 -- are 
serving in the border guards brigade.

<F P=106> [Article by Baiba Melnace: "Saeima Adopts Law on Taxes"] </F>
  [Text] Riga, 12 May -- At its Thursday [12 May] plenary 
session, the parliament adopted several laws and amendments 
regulating the collection of taxes in the state. 
  Amendments to the law on banks grant a priority right to the 
state budget to collect money from bank accounts of enterprises, 
and only thereafter can banks collect their due amount of 
credits and credit interest. Thus far, it has been the other 
way round -- first, banks collected their dues from the 
creditor, and later the budget. "This law will facilitate 
better collection of taxes," said Andris Piebalgs, chairman of 
the Parliament Budget and Finance Committee. 
  The law on the turnover tax envisions that products 
manufactured and sold by cooperative companies of farmers and 
fishermen, with their annual income not exceeding 30,000 lats, 
are exempt from this tax. Until now, only individual farmers 
and fishermen were exempt. 
  Amendments to the law also ensure that school textbooks, 
scientific literature, first editions of works in the 
vernacular, and children's literature from a list affirmed by 
the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science, are free from 
the turnover tax. 
  In his conversation with DIENA, A. Piebalgs emphasized that 
the limit of income -- 30,000 lats per year -- is very high. In 
other European countries, such reductions are granted, if the 
income does not exceed the equivalent of 7,000-10,000 lats. It 
must be noted that only those who themselves manufacture and 
sell their goods, can be freed from the turnover tax, so as to 
prevent dishonest utilization of this law, for example, in case 
a farmer would like to sell machines without paying the tax. 
  The draft law submitted by the "Fatherland and Freedom" 
faction, which foresees that, beginning 1 June, articles of food 
are not subject to the 18 percent turnover tax, has been 
conveyed to the parliament commissions for consideration. A. 
Piebalgs predicted that this draft law will not be considered at 
the spring session, before the summer recess. 
  Regarding reductions of income tax, property tax, and profit 
tax for social organizations, foundations, and enterprises, 
amendments have been introduced foreseeing reduced rates also in 
the first half of 1994. 
  During the first reading, two draft laws on gambling and 
lotteries were also adopted. A. Piebalgs stated that after the 
adoption of these laws, the state budget will receive an 
additional million lats, but in this case the most important 
matter is to introduce order in the system of gambling and 
lotteries as a separate kind of business. This would allow the 
protection of gamblers, and at the same time the obtaining of 
data on the number of people dealing in this business in Latvia, 
as well as money for the budget.

  [Text] Moscow May 23 TASS -- The Russian prime minister is 
holding an emergency conference on the latest developments in 
the Crimea, the press service of the Russian Government informed 
ITAR- TASS. 
  The press service has been unable to specify when Russian- 
Ukrainian negotiations on the subject at the prime ministerial 
level will begin today. 
  The political situation in the Crimea has been growing 
increasingly tense since the Crimean Parliament passed a law to 
restore the constitution of the Republic of Crimea adopted on 
May 6, 1992. The constitution provides for greater independence 
of the peninsula in relations with Ukraine. 
  Kiev regards this move as a manifestation of separatism and 
a 
threat to Ukraine's territorial integrity.

  [Text] Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev regards the 
concentration of Ukrainian troops in Crimea as potentially 
explosive. According to the information coming in, the defense 
minister said, about 400 Ukrainian special purpose troops are 
concentrated in the airport area near Simferopol. Five hundred 
Ukrainian servicemen have been deployed at the Cape of Khersones 
and, in the area of Sukhaya Bolka, on the eastern outskirts of 
Sevastopol--200 servicemen. When troops are being brought in 
and concentrated in an area, Pavel Grachev said, they can start 
military activities at any moment. The minister gave assurances 
that he had given the order for decisive action to stop all 
provocations directed against the Black Sea Fleet, regardless of 
who commits them.

<F P=106> [Pavel Felgengauer report under the "Crimea" rubric with the </F>
general heading: "General Grachev: `If Troops Are Being Pulled 
Up, an Armed Conflict Is Virtually Unavoidable'"] 
  [Text] Russian Defense Minister General Grachev believes 
that the Crimea situation could cause "a serious conflagration. 
If troops are being moved up, an armed conflict is virtually 
inevitable." The Russian Defense Ministry has been receiving 
reports about the concentration of Ukrainian troops in Crimea. 
There are around 400 Ukrainian special-purpose troops in the 
area of the Belbek airport (10 km north of Simferopol); 500 
contract servicemen landed on the cape of Khersones; and 200 
Ukrainian national guards (primarily from Ukraine's western 
oblasts) are on Sevastopol's eastern outskirts (Sukharnaya 
Balka). Reinforcements amounting to another 200 men are also 
expected. 
  Russian intelligence agencies are checking reports that the 
1st Ukrainian Mobile Air Brigade in Bolgrad has been put on full 
alert. Currently the brigade is under the command of General 
Babich (former chief of staff of the 98th Airborne Division). 
General Grachev knows him as "a competent and decisive officer" 
who is "capable of a great deal." 
  Black Sea Fleet units have been ordered to "stop any 
provocations in the most decisive fashion." Presently, 
facilities of the Crimean Internal Affairs Ministry have been 
protected by special-purpose army units and the OMON [Special 
Purpose Militia Detachment] of the Crimean Internal Affairs 
Ministry.

  [Text] The chairman of the Crimean parliament said it was 
the duty of the legislature to restore Crimea's constitution of 
May 6, 1992, and thereby put the peninsula's relations with 
Ukraine on the basis of a treaty. "I cannot see any other option 
-- there is simply none," Sergey Tsekov said at a news 
conference in Simferopol on Saturday. 
  He said that, as the legislature discussed the matter, some 
of its members made more drastic proposals, namely for a 
referendum on the status of the peninsula. Restoration of the 
1992 constitution is "the mildest form of relations with 
Ukraine," Tsekov said. 
  Answering a question by Interfax-Ukraine, he said the 
ultimate objective of the Russia Bloc is to make Crimea an 
independent state and then unify it with Russia, although the 
peninsula might be "reunified" with Russia "together with 
Ukraine." 
  "Many of the problems, above all economic ones, can only be 
solved by the integrating Ukraine with Russia," Tsekov said. 
  He said nothing today poses a threat to Ukraine's 
territorial 
integrity. 
  Asked about troop movements in Crimea, Tsekov said, "There 
are such movements, but they are normal routine troop movements. 
No emergency measures have been planned." 
  He ruled out that the Crimean parliament would be dissolved, 
for that, he said, would be illegal. "There are sensible 
people" in Ukraine's leadership, who "will not allow an 
aggravation of the relations with Crimea," he said.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 23 May (ITAR-TASS) -- "The vacation season 
in Crimea has begun." This was how Emil Pain, head of the 
conflict forecasting department of the analysis center under the 
Russian president, reacted to an ITAR-TASS report about 29 
Ukrainian armored personnel carriers appearing on the outskirts 
of Simferopol. 
  In an interview with the ITAR-TASS correspondent the analyst 
noted that the situation around Crimea is getting close to a 
critical point. "All the signs of an uncompromising fight for 
the integrity of the state are there. But strong-arm methods in 
taming separatists proved unsuccessful in Azerbaijan, Georgia, 
Moldova, and Serbia alike," Emil Pain said. "But history never 
teaches anything," he noted. 
  Unlike many experts, Emil Pain puts the blame for the crisis 
not only on Ukrainian but also on Crimean politicians. He 
believes it is possible to speak of the "irresponsibility" of 
Yuriy Meshkov's supporters, who could have carried out the 
Crimean authorities' policy without a confrontation with Ukraine. 
  "It was inexpedient to make a decision to change the Crimean 
Constitution on the eve of the vacation season, because its 
success could have improved the economic situation in the 
peninsula," the scientist believes. But he thinks that "Yuriy 
Meshkov seems to have forgotten that Abkhazia's beaches are no 
worse than Crimea's beaches, and that no one would wish to spend 
a vacation in an area of hostilities." 
  The political scientist stated with alarm that most armed 
conflicts have begun with a change in a certain territory's 
political status. "This time there should not be a military 
clash, because the price to pay for it would be not the future 
of Crimea but global security," he said.

  [Text] Moscow, 21 May. (ITAR-TASS) -- The Press and 
Information Department at the Russian Foreign Ministry today 
distributed the following report: 
  "On 20 May Ukraine's Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko sent 
the Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev a letter informing 
him of the decision adopted by Crimea's Supreme Soviet to 
restore the constitution of the Republic of Crimea of 6 May 
1992, which he believes could pose a threat to Ukraine's 
internal political stability and cause tension in relations 
between Russia and Ukraine. 
  "The letter underlines that, in the event of a further 
escalation of the situation, Ukraine retains the right to take 
all necessary measures to safeguard unconditionally the state's 
territorial integrity, in accordance with its Constitution and 
law and in observance of the norms of international law. 
  "In a reply message, Kozyrev says that the possibility of 
tension arising in Russian-Ukrainian relations because of Crimea 
cannot but cause concern and he agrees that international legal 
principles should be observed everywhere. But no less important 
is respect for the sovereign will of the peoples, restraint, and 
the need to exclude the use of force. All the problems arising 
between Ukraine and the sovereign republic of Crimea -- as part 
of Ukraine -- should be settled exclusively by political means. 
  "The situation in Crimea confirms once again the need for 
settling as soon as possible the questions of the Black Sea 
Fleet, proceeding from the accords between the presidents of 
both countries. Russia is ready for this, the letter from 
A.V.Kozyrev says in conclusion."

<F P=106> [Maksim Yusin report: "Kiev Has No Grounds for Accusing </F>
Kremlin of Inflaming Conflict in Crimea, Russian Foreign 
Ministry Believes"] 
  [Text] "Our stance regarding Crimea remains immutable. 
The peninsula is an inalienable part of Ukraine. We are ready 
to develop economic relations with the Republic of Crimea 
without placing those relations on a political level," Russian 
Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Krylov told IZVESTIYA. 
  According to Krylov, Moscow is interested in a political 
solution of the problems between Kiev and Simferopol. On the 
morning of 20 May the Russian Foreign Ministry still had no 
clear picture of what was actually happening on the peninsula. 
"We were receiving contradictory information," Krylov said. 
"If the reports that only `planned exercises' are being carried 
out in the Crimea are corroborated, then, given the tense 
situation, advance notification was necessary to avoid any 
unnecessary fuss." 
  Another high-ranking Foreign Ministry staffer, who wished to 
remain anonymous, voiced the hope that the Crimean leadership 
will show restraint and will not take matters to the point of 
confrontation with Ukraine: "According to the information at 
our disposal, Yuriy Meshkov has adopted a moderate stance and 
has advised the Supreme Council to defer examination of the 
question of restoring the Constitution of Crimea in the form it 
was adopted 6 May 1992." Moscow fears that if parliament does 
nevertheless go ahead and makes changes to the Constitution, 
this will result in a new bout of tension. IZVESTIYA has been 
given to understand that Moscow is in favor of the Crimean 
legislators' deferring examination of this explosive issue. 
  According to information from Smolensk Square [Russian 
Federation Foreign Ministry], the diplomatic departments of 
Russia and Ukraine are in constant contact. According to our 
Foreign Ministry, Kiev has no grounds at all for accusing the 
Kremlin of inflaming the conflict: Both President Yeltsin and 
the Foreign Ministry have repeatedly stated that Russia has no 
territorial claims on Ukraine and will not interfere in its 
internal affairs. At the same time IZVESTIYA's interlocutors did 
not deny that the increased number of trips made to the Crimea 
by Duma deputies, who sometimes make provocative statements, is 
destabilizing the situation.

Crimea is being monitored. At the same time, he said, yesterday 
the Ukrainian minister of internal affairs sent all town and 
rayon departments telegrams with orders to obey instructions 
from Kiev only. Valeriy Kuznetsov assessed this step by the 
Ukrainian leadership as a provocation aimed at destabilizing the 
situation on the peninsula. 
  The duty officer of the Black Sea Fleet staff told TASS 
that, 
following the completion of routine exercise, all units and 
subunits of the fleet are in their permanent places of 
deployment. They are not carrying out any maneuvers at present.

  [Text] Moscow May 23 TASS -- Russian Deputy Prime Minister 
Sergey Shakhray and President of Tatarstan Mintimer Shaymiyev 
are going to propose to Ukraine and the Crimea to settle their 
dispute like Moscow and Tatarstan did. 
  Shakhray told reporters on Monday that the example of 
Tatarstan can show to the leaderships of Ukraine and the Crimea 
"how it is possible to settle relations between a strong centre 
and a strong region". 
  In Tatarstan secessionist moods were strong until Moscow 
agreed to sign a bilateral share-power agreement with it. 
Kazan, in its turn, agreed to participate in elections to the 
new Russian parliament which failed in the republic mostly 
because the local leadership was against them. 
  "We want to remind the Ukrainian and Crimean leaders that 
relations between Moscow and Kazan could have developed along a 
very bad scenario in their time, but Russian and Tatar leaders 
had common sense enough to embark on the path of compromises and 
concessions", Shakhray said and added that the situation 
"normalised politically and economicaly" after the share-power 
deal between Moscow and Kazan was reached.

  [Text] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's nationalist Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) has expressed indignation over 
Ukrainian troops' "attack on the building of the Interior 
Ministry of (Ukrainian autonomous republic of) Crimea in order 
to change it into a so-called Central Department for Crimea of 
the Interior Ministry of Ukraine." 
  "Your government, Mr. Kravchuk, has already plundered 
Ukraine 
and run down what was a rich land," the LDPR says in a statement 
received by Interfax on Friday. "Now it is stealing Russian and 
Turkmen gas and oil transported through your territory." 
  Kravchuk "wishes to sell the Black Sea Fleet (disputed by 
Russia and Ukraine) for scrap metal, to sell everything that can 
be sold, in order to flee the devastated country when its people 
rise and demand reunification with Russia," the party says.

  [Text] Moscow May 20 TASS -- "Russia is interested in a 
more serious and substantial format of relations with NATO than 
the Partnership for Peace program envisions," Russian Defence 
Minister, Army General Pavel Grachev announced today. 
  "This approach, in our view, rules out surprises and 
unilateral measures, especially of military character, in the 
fields in which we must cooperate as closely as possible," 
General Grachev said after his meeting with French Foreign 
Minister Alain Juppe. 
  "We will put forth another plan for partnership, which has 
already been approved by the president of Russia," Grachev 
indicated. Its basic principles consist in Russia's joining the 
program with account being taken of its significant role and 
place in the European security system and the United Nations. 
In addition, Russia cannot limit itself to the signing of the 
standard framework document, the minister said. "We shall work 
to prepare a larger-scale program of cooperation between Russia 
and NATO, based on parameters of practical participation in its 
implementation," the Russian minister stressed. 
  These parameters are political partnership, partnership in 
the military and other fields. On their basis, "we shall 
propose drawing up a large-scale program for Russia's 
cooperation with Partnership for Peace. Only if they are 
approved, Russia will be able to sign the NATO program," Grachev 
said. 
  The minister said he would also set out in his report at 
NATO 
headquarters in Brussels on May 24 Russia's views on prospects 
for the development of the European security system. The accent 
will be placed on the need to ensure the leading role of the 
Conference of Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) in the 
process of forming a regional security system for the 
Commonwealth member-states within the collective security 
treaty, as well as on Russia's vision of the main parameters of 
cooperation with the North Atlantic alliance. 
  Grachev reiterated that his main objective was to tell NATO 
about the main provisions of the Russian military doctrine.

  [Text] Moscow May 22 TASS -- On his way to Brussels, 
Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev is to make on Monday a 
stop-over in the town of Wunsdorf in west Germany. While in 
Wunsdorf, he is scheduled to visit the headquarters of Russia's 
Western Army Group in Germany, as well as to meet with officials 
of the Deutsche Bank to discuss the funding of Russian troop 
withdrawal from Germany, a spokesman for the Russian Defence 
Ministry told TASS. 
  On Tuesday, the Russian defence minister will arrive in 
Brussels. Later in the day, he is to address the NATO leadership 
and defence ministers with a report on the basic principles of 
Russia's military doctrine. 
  On Wednesday, Grachev is scheduled to have a series of 
bilateral meetings with NATO defence ministers, including with 
his U.S. counterpart William Perry. He will also attend a joint 
meeting of NATO defence ministers, which is to concentrate on 
European security and on prospects for NATO's political and 
military cooperation with Central and East European states, as 
well as with the CIS. At this meeting, the Russian defence 
minister is expected to expound on Russia's attitude towards 
NATO's Partnership for Peace programme. 
  On the eve of his visit to Brussels, Grachev told reporters 
that Russia was interested in a more "serious and substantial 
format of relations with NATO than the one envisaged by the 
Partnership for Peace programme". 
  "We will offer an alternative scheme of partnership, already 
approved by the Russian president. Its essence is that Russia 
should join the programme with due regard for its significant 
role and place in the system of European security and the United 
Nations", the Russian defence minister pointed out. 
  Russia attaches much importance to Grachev's upcoming visit 
to Brussels. President Boris Yeltsin expects the NATO 
leadership to recognize the special status of Russia as a great 
power. This "can be done either through a protocol within the 
Partnership for Peace framework, or through a separate bilateral 
document between NATO and the Russian Federation", Yeltsin told 
TASS on Friday. 
  From May 26, the Russian defence minister will start an 
official visit to Belgium. He is due to meet his Belgian 
counterpart Leo Delcroix and to visit some military 
installations. On May 27, Grachev will return to Moscow.

<F P=106> [Interview with Russian President Boris Yeltsin's security </F>
adviser General Valeriy Manilov by Andrzey Rybak; place and date 
not given: "Cudgels Out!"] 
  [Text] [Rybak] President Yeltsin returned contentedly 
from his trip to Germany. Are the Russian people sharing the 
joy about the withdrawal of his troops from Germany? 
  [Manilov] The soldiers' withdrawal from Germany is certainly 
causing mixed feelings in the people. There are people who do 
not want to put up with it. But on the serious political level 
there are no doubts: The withdrawal is an important and 
positive step -- an expression and part of the new Russian 
geopolitics. When Russia gave German unification its blessing, 
all of us were aware that it had to be followed by the armed 
forces' withdrawal. 
  [Rybak] At the same time, however, U.S. troops remain in 
Germany. Is Russia thus abandoning the principle of parity in 
geopolitics? 
  [Manilov] In former times, we insisted on parity in every 
respect -- and at any price. We counted every gun, every tank, 
and every nuclear warhead -- and compared our figures with those 
of the Americans and NATO. When we lagged behind, the arms 
production had to be increased. But the world cannot be pressed 
any longer into such primitive schemes. We understood that and 
agreed to the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, without insisting 
on a similar step for NATO. 
  [Rybak] Will Russia, with the troop withdrawal, not lose a 
joker in the game about the Americans' withdrawal? 
  [Manilov] I think that it is time to put an end to the 
policy of cudgels. We no longer want to threaten with our arms 
potential. But the other side also has to make concessions. We 
say: "One cannot untie a knot with one hand." Least of all one 
that is so firmly tied as European security policy. 
  [Rybak] Before Germany's political unification, it was 
stated that NATO will not spread to the East. However, the GDR 
area was immediately integrated. Was Russia cheated? 
  [Manilov] Indeed, NATO did not keep its promise. This was a 
bitter experience. And not the last one. There are, for 
example, the bombing attacks in Bosnia. Would it have been so 
hard to reach for the telephone and to brief us? Formally, NATO 
was perhaps not forced to do it, but the point is the principle 
of partnership, which requires certain dealings with each other. 
  [Rybak] In view of such experiences, has the Russian 
leadership considered slowing down the troop withdrawal from 
Germany? 
  [Manilov] The punctual withdrawal from Germany was never 
questioned officially -- even though it resulted in great 
technical and social problems for us. This step was important 
to us in principle. In this way, we wanted to give a signal and 
to provide the new German-Russian relations with a solid 
foundation. Europe's stability depends on these relations. 
  [Rybak] Was the German debate on the troop farewell 
humiliating for Russia? 
  [Manilov] Many Russians felt this. Unfortunately, the 
German leadership lacked any sure instinct in this question. It 
has not understood the symbolic significance of this ceremony: 
We hope for joy and also a little bit of gratefulness. After 
all, the war against fascism cost millions of Russians their 
lives. Those who forget this and slam the door shut offend our 
national pride. Perhaps, however, someone also deliberately 
wanted to put bitterness into the cup of joy. 
  [Rybak] What do you mean by that? 
  [Manilov] There are extremists who would like to torpedo a 
German-Russian partnership. I could envisage that they are not 
at home at the Rhine. 
  [Rybak] You mean pressure from the United States? 
  [Manilov] I cannot rule out this scenario because the Weimar 
plans did not exactly show a European hand. We in Europe have 
lived together for centuries and have learned to act somewhat 
more sensitively. 
  [Rybak] Unfortunately, there are still a few things that are 
poisoning German-Russian relations. For example: Will Russia 
return the German art treasures? 
  [Manilov] Yes, this is another delicate problem. I do not 
doubt that the art treasures will finally be returned. However, 
we still have to clarify some points and Germany also has to 
return its booty. 
  [Rybak] Many Russians regard the German art treasures as a 
compensation for war damage. Rightly? 
  [Manilov] This attitude is wrong. We certainly have to talk 
about compensation. But the national cultural heritage must not 
be abused for it. In this way, we would hurt the Germans' 
pride. I will have the question of the return of cultural goods 
dealt with in the Security Council. 
  [Rybak] With its rejection of NATO's "Partnership for Peace" 
[PFP] program, Russia is causing confusion. Only one month ago, 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev announced Russia's accession. 
What is going on? 
  [Manilov] Russia is supporting the partnership idea and is 
prepared for accession in principle. However, we do not want 
this partnership to remain only an empty declaration. Before we 
sign it, we want to know first of all what all that means and 
what rights and duties we have. There are a lot of questions 
that have to be clarified. 
  [Rybak] Does Russia insist on a special status in the 
partnership? 
  [Manilov] What does a special status mean? Russia is a 
permanent member of the UN Security Council, a major nuclear 
power. Nobody should forget these realities. It has to be 
ensured that no decision of global importance may be made 
without us. However, there is also another problem: Some 
states regard the partnership as a protective shield against the 
Russian "danger" and want to establish a "cordon sanitaire" at 
the Russian border. What kind of partners are they? Russia 
must not be isolated! The whole partnership would be useless 
without us.

  The popular front united the Crimea's patriotic movements, 
including the Russian Party, the Russian Patriotic Assembly, the 
Brotherhood of Crimean Slavs, the women's League, the 
All-Crimean Voters' Movement for the Crimean Republic. 
  At its founding meeting, the popular front cited its main

  [Text] Moscow May 20 TASS -- Russian Defence Minister Pavel 
Grachev and French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe who is on a 
visit in Moscow, discussed the situation in "flash points" in 
the Commonwealth of Independent States. 
  Speaking of the Georgian-Abkhazian confrontation, Grachev 
said that the conflict has a trend for expanding, which affects 
Russia's security as well as its vitally important interests in 
the region. 
  The defence minister stressed that Russia has been 
constantly 
playing a mediator's role aimed at settling the 
Georgian-Abkhazian conflict politically but, regrettably, it 
does this mission single-handed. 
  Neither international peace-making organisation nor members 
of the Commonwealth of Independent States take an active part in 
its settlement. 
  Grachev also said that 2,500-3,000 blue helmets will be 
dispatched to the region in compliance with the agreement on 
ceasefire and disengagement of forces in Abkhazia, signed in 
Moscow on May 14. 
  They will be stationed along the Inguri River on the 
Abkhazian side as well as in the Galskiy district and the 
Kodorskoye Gorge. 
  As for the Armenian-Azeri conflict, Grachev informed Juppe 
of 
the drafted plan for a Karabakh settlement which was signed by 
Russia, Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh in Moscow on May 17. 
  Azeri Defence Minister Mamedrafi Mammadov was recalled to 
Baku on the same day all of a sudden. According to Grachev, 
this was evidently prompted by the aggravation of the situation 
at the republican parliament. 
  At the same time, he did not preclude a chance that this was 
done for political purposes in order to win time and to invite 
the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe to 
participate in a peace mission and to settle the Karabakh 
conflict under its aegis. 
  If the plan for settling the conflict was signed, Grachev 
noted, Russia would dispatch a peace-keeping force to the region 
on May 24. According to the minister, the Azeri defence minister 
is already in Moscow for the second day. 
  In Grachev's opinion, the essence of his arrival is to sign 
the plan for ceasefire and disengagement of the sides in the 
zone of the Armenian-Azeri confrontation by June 1 after some 
allegedly domestic issues are settled by President Geydar Aliyev. 
  Grachev stressed that Russia would not step back on the plan 
in any way. "The plan is very good. It can really bring 
peace," the minister noted.

  [Text] Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev met French 
Foreign Minister Alain Juppe at the Russian Defense Ministry 
today. During their conversation the ministers exchanged 
opinions on the problems of settling the situation in the 
Caucasus and Bosnia, as well as Russian participation in the 
American "Partnership for Peace" program. Alain Juppe showed 
most interest in the Russian plan for settling the 
Georgian-Abkhazian conflict. As Pavel Grachev stated, in 
accordance with the 14 May agreement, 2,500-3,000 Russian 
peacekeepers will be sent to the conflict zone. They will take 
up positions along the Inguri river, Galskiy Rayon, and the 
Kodorskoye Gorge. 
  Speaking about the prospects for joining the "Partnership 
for 
Peace" program, Pavel Grachev stressed that Russia is not 
demanding special conditions for itself, but believes 
cooperation with NATO countries must not be limited by a 
framework agreement. Therefore at his meeting with NATO 
leadership in Brussels he will put forward a broad package of 
specific proposals on cooperation between Russia and the North 
Atlantic bloc countries in the political and military spheres.

  [Text] France has agreed in principle to accept the 
Shokhin- Brittan formula concerning trade regulations for 
substances used in the nuclear industry, notably uranium, at 
talks between French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and Russian 
officials in Moscow, Interfax was informed by Maxim Medvekov, 
the Russian Foreign Economic Relations Ministry official in 
charge of bilateral cooperation. 
  France was the only EU [European Union] country at a session 
of the EU Council on May 16 not to back the agreements reached 
by Russian Vice-Premier Aleksandr Shokhin and the EU 
Commission's Vice- Chairman Leon Brittan in Moscow on May 2, 
thereby putting the signing of the Agreement on Partnership and 
Cooperation between the EU and the Russian Federation in June or 
July this year under question. 
  Shokhin and Brittan agreed that general trading standards 
would apply to uranium and other fissile substances, but with 
some exceptions. France objected to the formula, but was unable 
to provide any serious arguments to back its objections, 
offering only abstract fears that the European market could 
become inundated by Russian uranium some time in the future. 
  The sides did manage to untie the knot in Moscow, Medvedkov 
said, agreeing on minor technical adjustments to the formula. 
  Now, he said, practically all obstacles to the signing of 
the 
agreement between Russia and the EU in June or July had been 
removed, but he could not be absolutely certain until the draft 
agreement had been approved by the EU Council on June 13.

<F P=106> [Russian Federation Federal Assembly State Duma Appeal "in </F>
Connection with the Situation on the Territory of the Former 
Yugoslavia"] 
  [Text] Moscow, 13 May 1994 -- The Russian Federation 
Federal Assembly State Duma believes that in the situation which 
has taken shape a real opportunity has appeared for establishing 
peace on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. 
  In this connection the State Duma appeals to all sides 
taking 
part in the conflict to cease all hostilities immediately and to 
embark on talks to establish peace. For its part the State Duma 
is prepared to render all-around assistance to set up dialogue 
between the sides involved. 
  The State Duma appeals to all parliaments of the world to 
prevent decisions which could destabilize the situation in the 
former Yugoslavia and primarily those leading to the violation 
of the embargo on arms supplies to any of the warring sides. 
  The State Duma suggests that the parliaments of states 
adjacent to the territory of the former Yugoslavia hold an 
international conference with the participation of UN and CSCE 
representatives on ways of overcoming the crisis in the Balkans.

  [Text] In Bosnia, much now depends not on politicians but 
on the military. Vladimir Solovyev, the Ostankino correspondent 
in Yugoslavia, managed to interview specially for our program 
the man who is probably the most belligerent of the war leaders, 
the Bosnian Serbs' commander, General Ratko Mladic. What does 
he think of the prospects for a peaceful settlement? 
  [Begin recording] [Solovyev] In the Serb Republic and in 
Yugoslavia he is called the Serbian Zhukov. In the West, some 
regard him as a war criminal. Others study his victories in 
military staffs and academies. Fifty-year-old Colonel General 
Ratko Mladic commands the army of the Bosnian Serbs, the largest 
and the most efficient army in the Balkans. 
  [Mladic, in Serbo-Croatian, with superimposed Russian 
translation] Our people hold two things sacred -- the land and 
the woman, because they give birth to new life. We never 
declared war on anyone. We are defending ourselves, our ancient 
land, our women and children, our monasteries and churches, our 
culture. Look, even now, during the war, throughout the Serb 
Republic, from Banja Luka to Trebinje, there are Croats and 
Muslims who are not fighting against the Serb nation and who 
enjoy all the rights of our citizens. 
  [Solovyev, in Serbo-Croatian, with superimposed Russian 
translation] Mr. General, what do you think of the possible 
division of Bosnia-Herzegovina? What share of the territory 
would Bosnian Serbs agree to have? 
  [Mladic] This is inevitable, and we do not demand more than 
we own. Serbs used to have most of the territory in Bosnia- 
Herzegovina. The 1910 land register shows that nearly 90 
percent was theirs. The Serb nation stands for peace, and we 
propose that our adversaries sign an agreement on a universal 
and lasting end to the feud and the hostilities throughout 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, with the separation of forces along the 
present front lines. And let politicians solve all disputed 
issues later in conditions of peace. 
  [Solovyev] Do you think peace is a long way off? 
  [Mladic] As far as we are concerned, there can be peace 
right 
now. But looking at it strategically, the forces that unleashed 
this war and their sponsors have not yet reached their goals, 
either by force or by ruining Yugoslavia. They do not need 
peace at present. Therefore I am somewhat pessimistic. I do 
not believe that they want peace soon, because they profit 
immensely from the war. 
  [Solovyev] What do you think of UNPROFOR's [UN Protection 
Force] ability to bring peace to Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Mladic] One cannot generalize, but most UN soldiers and 
officers do what they have to do quite well. But unfortunately, 
there are some who forget about their peace-keeping mission and 
openly side with the Croats or Muslims. I have to say that so 
far not one UNPROFOR soldier has been hurt on the territory of 
the Serb Republic. I am sure this will continue to be the case. 
I would like to assure the parents of Russian and Ukrainian 
soldiers with UNPROFOR that they are perfectly safe on our 
territory and that the people welcome them as a force of peace. 
  [Solovyev] One last question: what is your greatest dream? 
  [Mladic] Peace. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] If General Mladic were to put his assurances 
about striving for peace into practice, I think the entire 
international community would breathe a sigh of relief. But 
somehow I find it difficult to believe.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Aleksandr Krylovich] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 20 May -- If Russia makes its proposals 
about an international conference on security and the 
nuclear-free status of the Korean peninsula more concrete, North 
Korea is ready to study them and reply in concrete terms, Son 
Song-pil, DPRK ambassador to Moscow, told journalists today. 
  He said: "The attractive side of the Russian initiative is 
the desire to resolve the nuclear issue in the region through 
talks, without the use of force and threats, based on the 
principle of equal rights." According to the ambassador, only 
methods based on the use of force and pressure have been applied 
to his country so far. The United States, the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and certain states have frequently 
used such methods. Son Song-pil said: Regrettably, Russia has 
also been unable to refrain from using them, and for a while it 
toed the line of the U.S. Administration with respect to the 
issue of nuclear safety on the Korean peninsula. This has 
caused relations between North Korea and the Russian Federation 
to cool in the past few years. Now some aspects of their 
bilateral relations have started to inspire hope, and the 
present Russian initiative reflects this hope. 
  Answering an ITAR-TASS correspondent's question about the 
obstacles preventing the nuclear problem from being solved 
immediately, Son Song-pil spoke primarily about the IAEA's 
so-called "double standards" when estimating the level of 
nuclear activity of different states. He said conclusive proof 
of this is the 70 kg of plutonium that is unaccounted in 
Tokaymura, Japan, and only recently made public. Given the 
well-developed and efficient system of monitoring the security 
of nuclear installations by this international organization, 
this incident can only signify that the IAEA is "far from being 
impartial." The North Korean ambassador does not rule out that 
the plutonium found in Japan is "merely the tip of the iceberg" 
and that thorough and unbiased inspection could lead to the 
discovery of other serious Japanese violations of the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty.

  [Text] Moscow May 23 TASS -- Russia is not selling weapons 
to North Korea at present, but has the right to do so as no 
international sanctions have been imposed on Pyongyang. 
  "At present there are no international sanctions against the 
People's Democratic Republic of Korea. Therefore, Russia, as 
any other country, has the right to ship to North Korea purely 
defensive systems of armaments and spare parts to them on a 
commercial basis", a high-ranking government source told TASS on 
Monday. 
  Pyongyang's foreign debt to Moscow, which remains from the 
time of the former Soviet Union, exceeds three billion US 
dollars and impedes commercial operations with North Korea, 
according to the source.

Vladimir Novikov] 
  [Text] Murmansk, 22 May -- Russian and British foreign 
ministers began talks here today at the suburban hotel Ogni 
Murmanska. Welcoming the British visitor, Andrey Kozyrev noted 
that the two countries' cooperation during the war was closely 
linked with the port of Murmansk. "We remain allies after the 
ideological blackout that drew our countries apart," he said. 
"We are now returning to the natural state of partnership." 
  "You will be the first foreign minister from another country 
to visit the strategic base of the Russian Navy in Severomorsk," 
Kozyrev went on. "It is very important that the deadly missiles 
are no longer targeted at Britain, same as British Trident 
missiles are no longer targeted at Russia. This too is an 
example of new partnership." 
  The head of the Russian Foreign Ministry also noted that the 
meeting of the two ministers was taking place in a private 
hotel. In his view, this showed that despite all the 
difficulties, the spirit of enterprise had opened itself a way 
in this land of great opportunities. 
  "It is particularly interesting to me to visit Murmansk," 
Douglas Hurd said in his turn. "Older generation Britons, among 
whom I have many friends, went with the convoys across the 
dangerous Arctic waters, threatened by German submarines. This 
was the brightest page in their lives. I am looking forward to 
seeing the city that, among other things, is the administrative 
center of the Russian foreign minister's constituency, and to 
visiting the military base in Severomorsk. The reasons why this 
is important to me lie both in the past and in the present." 
  D. Hurd said he was confident that Murmansk would attract 
large foreign investments because of its vast mineral resources 
and the kray's geographical location.

  [Text] It looks as though someone planned an attempt on the 
life of Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales, when he visited St. 
Petersburg between 16 and 19 May. On 16 May, security guards 
discovered a plastic bag containing a time bomb between the 
doors of a shop of the British firm Littlewoods in Tukhachevskiy 
Avenue. The alarm hand connected with the firing device and 
four kilograms of TNT pointed at eight o'clock. Had the 
explosive device gone off, the shop would have been blown to 
pieces. The Prince of Wales did visit Littlewoods, but at 
another time.

  [Text] Groznyy, 22 May -- Today a three-day international 
conference entitled "Genocide in the USSR: Policy, Practice and 
Ideology" ends in the Chechen capital. The recurrent theme of 
the conference has been the continuing policy and practice of 
genocide not only on the territory of the former Union, but also 
in other regions of the world. Video documentaries have been 
presented to the forum dealing with acts of mass genocide in 
Tajikistan, Ingushetia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Abkhazia, and 
Bosnia, as well as historical materials on the spiritual and 
physical destruction of the people in Chechnya. 
  At the end of the conference's second day a speech was made 
by Dzhokhar Dudayev, president of the Chechen Republic-Ichkeria, 
who demanded the continuation of the Nuremburg trials for the 
organizers and ideological inspirers of the policy of genocide 
on the territory of the former Union in the present stage. 
Impunity engenders new crimes, Dudayev said. Touching on the 
stance of the international community, the Chechen president 
noted with regret that it remains an indifferent observer of the 
evil deeds being committed against peoples all over the world. 
  Dudayev declared the complete bankruptcy of the United 
Nations, an illegitimate body in which authority is illegally 
usurped by a narrow group of political clans in the person of 
the so-called five permanent members of the UN Security Council. 
This situation contradicts the fundamental interests of the 
international community, Dudayev said. 
  The president of the Chechen Republic-Ichkeria appealed to 
the states and countries of the world to recognize all the 
riches and resources of the planet as the exclusive property of 
the most high, and the right of all peoples to use these 
resources without regard to state borders and formations. In 
particular, Dudayev proposed as a first step that a water supply 
line should be laid from the icy peaks of the Caucasus to the 
Middle East, where water is the main cause of instability, 
bloodshed, and war. Today the conference will end its work 
after adopting a number of fundamental documents.

  [Excerpts] Moscow, 20 May -- In an interview for ITAR-TASS 
today, the Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama, who lives in 
exile in the Indian city of Dhamsala, expressed his hope that he 
would one day return to his homeland. "I hope to return to Lhasa 
at some time, to the Potala palace, the residence of the Dalai 
Lamas," said the former ruler of Tibet, who left Tibet after the 
bloody clashes between the local population and the Chinese Army 
in 1959. 
  The Dalai Lama said he "would find ways and channels to hold 
a referendum on the future of Tibet." He said that in the 
referendum the population would be given the choice of several 
alternatives. One of these is supported by advocates of the 
"middle way" who do not demand the complete separation and 
independence of Tibet from China. The Dala Lama, himself, is 
one of these. A different point of view is held by many young 
Tibetans who insist on complete independence for Tibet. [passage 
omitted] 
  The Dalai Lama stated that the unique Tibetan culture was on 
the verge of disappearing. At the same time he stressed his 
readiness to hold talks with Beijing on the basis of the 
principle that Deng Xiaoping, the architect of Chinese reforms, 
put forward with regard to Taiwan and Hong Kong -- "one 
country-two systems" -- extending it to the present Tibetan 
autonomous region of the PRC. 
  Sharing his impressions about present day Moscow, which he 
has already visited several times, the Dalai Lama said "a lot 
more cars" have appeared on the streets and "many houses are 
under construction near the capital," which in his opinion is 
evidence of development. But a much more striking change is that 
"previously in Moscow it was difficult to communicate with 
ordinary citizens, but now Muscovites converse willingly, they 
ask questions and show a new openness of views and emotions." 
  "I think this is very important," the Buddhist spiritual 
leader stressed. He advised Russians "to create something new 
in the economic sphere" to avoid the drawbacks of the "Western 
economic model." 
  On Saturday the Dalai Lama leaves for Delhi. During his stay 
in Moscow, the PRC embassy in Russia expressed "serious concern" 
about the activity of the Tibetan spiritual leader, which in the 
opinion of Chinese diplomats, was directed "at splitting China."

  [Text] Moscow May 22 TASS -- The Dalai Lama said he will 
find means and ways to hold a referendum on the future of Tibet. 
  In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Saturday before his 
departure from Moscow where he was on a three-day visit, the 
Dalai Lama said he remains hopeful that he will return to China 
one day and step into the Tibetan capital of Lhasa and the 
Potala, the former palace of the Dalai Lama. 
  The Dalai Lama fled Tibet after bloody clashes between the 
Tibetan population and Chinese police in 1959 and has been 
living in India ever since. 
  He said that Tibetan culture is on the verge of extinction 
and confirmed his readiness to hold talks with China on the 
basis of the principle "one country -- two systems" proposed by 
architect of chinese reform Deng Xiaoping for Taiwan and Hong 
Kong. He believes this principle could also be applied to Tibet. 
  The Dalai Lama was in Moscow at the invitation of the 
Russian 
Academy of Sciences and the International Foundation for the 
Survival and Development of Mankind. He held informal meetings 
with Russian parliamentarians and Moscow officials and public 
figures, and took part in a seminar on global security and 
conflict settlement. 
  On Friday [20 May], the Dalai Lama attended an international 
prayer for peace which he served together with representatives 
of the Russian Orthodox, Islamic, Judaic and Buddhist clergy. 
  Kindness is the basis of human being and people of Russia 
must remember this, the Dalai Lama said. He called on the 
citizens of Russia to believe in themselves and not to abandon 
their hope for a better future. 
  The Dalai Lama said he was impressed by changes in Russia 
and 
the greater openness of society and people who eagerly joined in 
conversation with him in the street, asked questions and did not 
try to hide their opinion and emotions. 
  He believes Russia should come up with something new in the 
economic sphere in order to avoid the flaws of Western economies. 
  The Dalai Lama flew back to India today.

  [Text] In the meantime, Vladimir Shumeyko, the head of the 
Upper Chamber of the Federal Assembly, has left for a tour of 
five South American countries. Though the chairman of the 
Federation Council has enough invitations to keep him travelling 
for a whole year, he has decided to rediscover for Russia the 
far-away Latin American continent. Speaking to our 
correspondent Vyacheslav Osipov before the tour, the speaker of 
the Upper Chamber said that Russia has stopped dividing 
countries into Third World states and developing states, and 
added in the way of explanation: 
  [Begin Shumeyko recording] Russia's international policy has 
this underlying principle: We are not looking for 
ideologically- close friends any more. Today we are choosing 
partners on the basis of mutual advantage, so that our relations 
could contribute to our mutual development, primarily in 
economic terms. One thing that should be very closely 
monitored, first of all, is Russia's interests, which should 
take precedence. As for partners, we will be able to find them 
anywhere. [end recording] 
  Continuing the conversation, our correspondent said that 
Georgadze, Podgornyy, and Vorotnikov [leaders of the Brezhnev 
period] had made lengthy tours of Latin America -- but it would 
be an overstatement to say that this had contributed to 
expanding mutual contacts. So, what is the objective of the 
visit to Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, Chile, and Ecuador? Is 
Shumeyko hoping to use the experience of those countries in 
reforming the Russian social and economic life? 
  [Begin Shumeyko recording] Yes, no Soviet and, later, 
Russian 
leader has visited those states since 1982, which was a long 
time ago. Take Argentina, for example, which has gone through a 
stage very similar to the one we are going though now. That 
country managed to reach a political consensus at a certain 
stage, there are two parties now and the country is developing. 
They adopted a normal civic code -- a very good one, in fact, 
which allows Argentina to develop a market economy and 
democracy. We keep looking for some outstanding examples -- 
like the United States, or Japan, or some place else. My 
preliminary acquaintance with the South American continent has 
shown that today the Russian state has no right to ignore it. 
We can learn a lot from them in terms of our economic 
development. If we want to integrate our relationships, our 
legislative systems should be brought closer to each other. We 
should start by studying, to a degree, their existing laws and 
experience. We are expecting good results from this trip. I do 
not want to be compared to Georgadze, Vorotnikov, and the like 
-- but you will see for yourselves. [end recording]

  [Text] Santiago May 23 TASS -- Chile has accumulated rich 
experience in democratic transformations and economic 
development which can be fruitful for Russia, Vladimir Shumeiyo, 
the speaker of the Federation Council, told reporters upon 
arrival in the Latin American country on Sunday. 
  He is to meet Chilean President Eduardo Frei Ruiz and hand 
over a message from Boris Yeltsin to him. 
  Shumeyko said he is satisfied with the current state of 
bilateral relations and, in particular, in trade and economic 
cooperation. "The long-standing ties between Russia and friendly 
Chile are based on principles of mutual respect and equality", 
the speaker of the upper chamber of the Russian Parliament 
stressed. 
  Chile is the first leg of Shumeyko's trip to Latin America. 
"I do not share the opinion that Latin America lies far away 
from Russian interests", he said and added that the experience 
of certain countries of the region in democratic transformations 
and economic reforms can be useful for Russia. 
  Shumeyko, who is accompanied by heads of Russian privatised 
companies, including president of the major "Lukoil" oil firm 
Vagit Alekperov, is to visit Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela and 
Equador.

  [Text] Moscow, 22 May -- Today Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev expressed gratitude to the Government of Pakistan 
and to Afghan leaders for their specific action to implement 
accords reached between us during visits to Islamabad and Kabul. 
The matter concerns the handing over on 16 May in the residence 
of Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of two former Soviet 
POW's seized by a group supporting Golboddin Hekmatyar during 
the war in Afghanistan. 
  After many years of imprisonment and deprivation in camps 
run 
by the Afghan opposition, the two Russian men, Yuriy Stepanov 
from Bashkiria and Aleksey Olenin from Kuybyshev Oblast, have 
been allowed to return home. 
  I welcome the release from captivity of Aleksey Olenin and 
Yuriy Stepanov, the Russian foreign minister said today. Their 
return home was made possible by the constant attention of the 
Russian leadership to the problems of finding and freeing former 
Soviet POWs captured in Afghanistan, and to the joint efforts in 
this area of the Foreign Ministry, other Russian departments, 
and the Committee for Affairs of Soldiers Serving Abroad, the 
Russian foreign minister said. 
  Kozyrev expressed hope that constructive interaction between 
the leaderships of Russia, Afghanistan, and Pakistan will 
continue, in order to solve the humanitarian problem of POW's as 
soon as possible. 
  According to Russian Defense Ministry figures there are 290 
of our soldiers missing in Afghanistan. It is known that 60 or 
70 of them are alive. Leonid Biryukov, head of the section for 
the finding and freeing of missing soldiers of the Committee for 
Affairs of Soldiers Serving Abroad under the council of CIS 
heads of government, who cited these figures to the ITAR-TASS 
correspondent, expressed confidence that all the Afghan war 
veterans who had been separated from their homeland would 
certainly be reunited with it. The complex work to rescue our 
soldiers captured in Afghanistan will continue.

  [Text] On May 18, in Interfax's material concerning 
cooperation between Russian and Pakistani secret services in the 
efforts to free former Soviet prisoners of war published in News 
Bulletins and in Diplomatic Panorama, the press secretary of the 
director of Russia's Intelligence Service, Tatyana Samolis, was 
quoted as saying that former Soviet prisoners of war still 
remained in Pakistan. 
  In her Friday's interview with Interfax Samolis explained 
that some former Soviet servicemen taken prisoner "in the Afghan 
war" still remained abroad. 
  According to Samolis, she did not mean any concrete country, 
in particular Pakistan. 
  Members of Russia's Foreign Ministry explained to Interfax 
that former Soviet servicemen are held on Afghan soil. "Had our 
prisoners of war been in Pakistan, the Pakistanis would have 
extradited them long ago," a high-ranking Russian diplomat told 
Interfax's correspondent.

  [Text] Moscow May 20 TASS -- Director of the Middle East 
and Africa department of the Russian Foreign Ministry Viktor 
Posuvalyuk told ITAR-TASS by telephone today that the number of 
Russians in Algeria had substantially decreased during the 
recent period due to the evacuation of the wives and children of 
Russian specialists and employees of different organisations. 
Their total number now equals to 1,100 people. Various ways 
are being studied to ensure their security, including probable 
further reductions, he stressed. However, the recall of Russian 
experts from several sectors of the economy, which are vitally 
important for Algeria, is linked with definite difficulties, 
which may affect both friendly Algeria and Russia. 
  Touching on his Thursday meeting with Algerian ambassador to 
Moscow, Posuvalyuk explained that the demand to toughen security 
measures in order to protect Russian specialists, handed to the 
Algerian side, was "worded in the most resolute form". The 
sides also discussed ways to "approach the very concept of this 
security from a new angle, in particular, to lodge the Russians 
more compactly, which would make it easier for the Algerian law 
enforcement bodies to ensure their protection". 
  The ambassador stressed the difficulties with which the 
Algerian police was now confronted. It was decided to establish 
closer contacts of the Russian Embassy and the Algerian 
contractors with the local security services.

<F P=106> [Marina Ryklina report: "Russian Convoy on African Soil"] </F>
  [Text] A special detachment from the Russian Ministry for 
Affairs of Civil Defense, Emergency Situations, and Elimination 
of Natural Disasters, comprising 15 drivers, communications 
workers, medics, and translators, flew out of Moscow to Tanzania 
18 May. Two transport aircraft -- an Il-76 and an An-124 
"Ruslan" -- delivered 10 "KamAZ" trucks, spares, and 
communications systems to the African continent. 
  According to figures from the World Food Program, there are 
already more than 320,000 refugees in Tanzania from neighboring 
Rwanda -- where an interethnic war still rages. Every day more 
than 1,500 people are arriving in the quest to escape. The 
United Nations is so far succeeding in supplying food to the 
world's largest refugee camp at Benako [name as transliterated]. 
  Within the framework of the recently concluded agreement to 
support the humanitarian aid operations, the Office of the UN 
High Commissioner for Refugees has appealed to its partner -- 
the Russian Ministry for Affairs of Civil Defense, Emergency 
Situations, and Elimination of Natural Disasters -- asking it to 
take part in transporting international humanitarian cargo to 
Rwandan refugee camps. Following this request an advance party 
from the Ministry for Affairs of Civil Defense, Emergency 
Situations, and Elimination of Natural Disasters went to 
Tanzania to arrange the routes for the delivery of the cargo and 
look at security problems, the conditions under which Russian 
drivers would be living, and funding issues. Our participation 
in this action will be effected on the basis of the United 
Nations reimbursing our transport costs, detachment members' 
pay, and certain other expenses.... 
  Meanwhile the Ministry for Affairs of Civil Defense, 
Emergency Situations, and Elimination of Natural Disasters is 
already installing a special communications system which will 
make it possible to monitor the Russian convoy's progress all 
along the route.

  [Text] On return from Baku, Thursday [19 May], President 
Yeltsin's plenipotentiary emissary for Nagorno-Karabakh Vladimir 
Kazimirov told Interfax that Azerbaijan wanted an agreement on 
the withdrawal of the Armenian forces from the occupied Azeri 
territories to supplement the protocol negotiated by the 
Armenian and Azeri defense ministers and the commander of the 
Karabakh defense forces under the mediation of the Russian 
defense minister. Kazimirov met with the Azeri leaders in Baku. 
  Whether a formal agreement would be concluded, was 
immaterial 
to Baku but, Kazimirov said, Baku wanted a solution for that 
problem. It seeks that the Armenians withdraw as soon as 
hostilities are ceased in what it seen as the occupied areas. 
  The protocol was signed on May 17 by mediating Defense 
Minister Pavel Grachev of Russia, his Armenian counterpart Serge 
Sarkissyan and the commander of the Karabakh forces Samvel 
Babayan. In addition to a cease-fire, it calls for the presence 
of observers and the disengagement of the conflicting forces in 
the disputed zone. Without signing the document, Azerbaijan's 
Defense Minister Mamadrafi Mammadov left Moscow for Baku. 
  Kazimirov hoped the Armenians would meet the Azeri demand. 
Understanding had been reached in principle, he said, on 
Armenian withdrawl from the occupied areas. The Armenians would 
withdraw as soon as they were sure that the hostilities were 
over and there was no threat to Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  Kazimirov refused to confirm that the leaders of the 
conflicting parties would possibly meet by June 1. Moves were 
being made, he said, but uncertainty always remained when it 
came to setting deadlines. Although they were perfectly 
understandable from the human point of view, high emotions bred 
nervousness, and even made one doubt the possibility of a 
non-violent settlement. This kind of conflicts never ended 
under anaesthesia, Kazimirov said, they always ended in pain, if 
not agony. 
  Addressing the political role of Russia in the efforts to 
settle the Karabakh conflict, Kazimirov said Russia could not 
afford to discontinue mediation because its interests were at 
stake.

<F P=106> [Pavel Vasilyev article: "Nagorno-Karabakh: The Lull </F>
before the Peace?"] 
  [Text] Under the plan proposed by Russia on Monday at the 
meeting of the defense ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan and 
the commander in chief of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic's 
defense forces, the Russian Federation president was due to sign 
a detailed plan today for the introduction of Russian 
peacemaking and disengagement forces into the region of 
hostilities in Nagorno-Karabakh and in five days' time, on 24 
May, the actual disengagement of the opposing forces was due to 
begin along the entire front. But the process has been 
suspended. Temporarily, according to the Foreign Ministry and 
the Defense Ministry. The representatives of Armenia and 
Karabakh accepted the Russian plan, but the Azerbaijan defense 
minister needed additional information and left for Baku without 
signing the document or taking leave of his colleagues. Special 
envoy Vladimir Kazimirov, leader of the Russian delegation at 
the talks, then went to the Transcaucasus. On Tuesday and 
Wednesday he discussed the prevailing situation with local 
political leaders on the spot. It transpired that the protocol 
had not been signed "because it contained certain defects." And 
in particular because a session of parliament had been fixed for 
Tuesday, at which deputies were demanding a report on the 
Azerbaijan leadership's actions in connection with the situation 
in Karabakh. 
  In the conflict zone itself calm is being maintained at the 
moment. On the whole the sides are fulfilling the cease-fire 
accords reached in Moscow. 
  Is there a hope that the lull which has set in will end in a 
peace agreement? Well-informed Azerbaijani sources are accusing 
Yerevan of disrupting the detailed peace settlement plan, while 
the Armenian permanent mission blames Baku for the breakdown of 
the talks. Nevertheless, no one is rejecting the idea of direct 
contacts between the defense ministers and the commander in 
chief of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic through the mediation of 
Army General Pavel Grachev. At the Russian Foreign Ministry 
they also believe that the chance of peace has not been lost and 
that 24 May could mark the start of a new life for the two 
neighboring peoples. Colonel General Georgiy Kondratyev, 
Russian deputy defense minister, who is responsible for the 
peacemaking forces' activity, has even expressed confidence that 
Azerbaijan will sign the protocol in the near future. And Pavel 
Grachev himself tends to view the military's actions as an 
effort to achieve peace. Even though, in his words, certain 
forces still exist which "are getting rich out of the Karabakh 
war." In addition, "the people who give the order to wage war 
never go to the front line; they always command from the rear," 
Pavel Grachev added. 
  Time will tell whether these hopes are well founded.

  [Text] Russian peace envoy for Nagorno-Karabakh Vladimir 
Kazimirov says that there could be no cease-fire in the disputed 
territory unless peacekeepers have been sent there. In an 
interview with Interfax, he spoke of no other alternative being 
envisaged for the time being. 
  At the same time, Kazimirov stressed the forces that the 
military officials of Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh and Russia had 
agreed on sending to the area of conflict were not intended to 
disengage troops. Instead, they were designed to ensure the 
security of military observers including one common and three 
regional headquarters and a large number of stationary 
observation posts and mobile observer groups.

  [Text] The Russian Finance Ministry believes that it is too 
early to discuss Tajikistan's joining the ruble zone, Deputy 
Russian Finance Minister Andrey Kazmin told the Financial 
Information Agency. 
  He emphasized that this issue could be considered only in 
the 
distant and not in the near future as Tajikistan would prefer. 
  By the end of 1993 Tajikistan was the only republic of the 
former USSR where old issue rubles were still in circulation. 
This led to the complete collapse of the Tajik monetary system. 
Trying to remain in the ruble zone, Dushanbe made quite a risky 
decision and seized old issue rubles without introducing its own 
currency units. 
  This resulted in crisis. To overcome it the Russian 
government agreed to allot a credit of 120 billion cash rubles. 
Tajikistan has already received 80 billion rubles of it. 
  The Russian Finance Ministry believes that Tajikistan must 
focus on restoration of its own monetary system. Tajikistan 
must introduce its own currency together with Russian rubles. 
This seems to be the most reasonable alternative in the present 
situation, Kazmin pointed out. 
  He referred to the April memorandum of the Russian 
government 
and the Central Bank submitted to the International Monetary 
Fund. The memorandum said that the merging of the Russian 
monetary system with the monetary systems of the CIS states 
could be carried out only if the economic systems of these 
states would suit the purpose. The economic potential of 
Belarus, which has signed such an agreement with Russia, 
significantly exceeds that of Tajikistan. However, many 
problems must be settled before the Russian-Belarussian treaty 
is implemented. 
  Russian Acting Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin has recently 
recommended that Tajikistan introduce its own national coupons 
and cover its expenditures without Russian credits. Dubinin 
announced that Russia had already printed coupons for Tajikistan.

  [Text] New Delhi May 21 TASS -- A visit to India by Viktor 
Samoilov, managing director of Rosvooruzhenie, a state 
export-import company on weapons and combat materiel, ended on 
Saturday with signing several contracts on the construction in 
the republic of missile boats, frigates and escort ships. 
  He was received by Indian Minister of State for Defence M. 
Mallikarjun, had meetings with commanders of land, air and naval 
forces and visited shipyards in Bombay and Goa. 
  "The visit confirmed that Russian-Indian cooperation in the 
military and military-technical spheres has a long-term 
prospect," Samoilov said in an interview with ITAR-TASS. "We 
mapped out cooperation programmes for land, air and naval forces. 
  "A long-term plan has been drafted to build warships at 
Indian shipyards with Russian participation: over ten missile 
boats and some ten frigates and escort ships. One of them will 
be launched for running tests late this year." 
  Russia will supply all the main units, component parts and 
arms for these ships, he stressed. This means that new jobs 
will be created at Russian munitions factories. 
  Speaking about a Russian visit by Indian Premier P.V. 
Narasimha Rao and his talks with the Russian leaders, Samoilov 
said that the sides would discuss, among other things, military 
cooperation.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Filatov, chief of President Yeltsin's </F>
staff, by correspondent Voskoboynikov; date and place not given] 
  [Text] [Voskoboynikov] Sergey Aleksandrovich, could it 
happen that you, like Sergey Shakhray, might have to find out 
from the newspapers about being removed from a official position? 
  [Filatov] Well, this is a difficult question. You see, I 
think it is a ridiculous thing that a person finds out from the 
newspapers or radio that a decree has been signed on his 
dismissal or removal, so to speak. The procedural system had 
not worked properly in this instance. Unfortunately, things 
like this do happen time from time. 
  [Voskoboynikov] Vyacheslav Kostikov, the Russian president's 
press secretary, said that Shakhray's plans were not always in 
line with Russia's real state interests. Nevertheless, 
President Yeltsin has decided to leave Shakhray in the position 
of Vice Premier. Why? 
  [Filatov] Well, you know, Shakhray's activities have been 
beneficial. Since the creation of the Russian Federation we 
have seen the important work he has been carrying out in one or 
another sector he has headed. That is why I think these 
circumstances were probably taken into account. Of course, his 
work is beneficial to the government and it is most likely that 
this was behind the president's decision to keep Shakhray.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Shakhray, former Russian minister of </F>
nationalities and regional policy, by an unidentified 
correspondent; place and date not given; from the "Novosti" 
newscast -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] Sergey Mikhaylovich, many people 
link your dismissal as minister for the affairs of nationalities 
and regional policy with your stand at the talks with Chechnya, 
and with the situation in the North Caucasus in general. Is 
that really the case? 
  [Shakhray] I do not think there is a direct link here. Even 
if there is, I still believe that decisions on personnel matters 
should be made by the prime minister and the president on their 
own, without prompts or recommendations from Chechen President 
Dzhokhar Dudayev, as some hinted was the case. I should like to 
say this is not a question of a certain personal stand of mine. 
There is a presidential message in which the policy toward 
Chechnya is formulated; there is a State Duma resolution. 
Therefore, I believe that all the federal bodies of state 
power--the Federation Council with its head, the State Duma, and 
the government--should act along the lines that have been 
defined, both in political and in legal terms, rather than 
conjure up some inventions of their own. After all, there 
should be elementary order in the country. 
  Incidentally, my resignation statement is connected with the 
breach of elementary procedures and order. On the one hand, I 
have been retained as a deputy prime minister in charge of the 
nationalities and regional policy, and on the other, a minister 
of whom I have not heard anything has been appointed to cover 
the same area. 
  [Correspondent] Do you foresee any more serious changes in 
the cabinet? 
  [Shakhray] I believe there will be no drastic upheavals and 
reshuffles. 
  [Correspondent] You mean, there will be no such proposal 
from 
the prime minister himself? 
  [Shakhray] You may have noticed that the prime minister, 
using his vast experience, believes that an old hand is better 
than two new ones. He prefers not to change his personnel, his 
ministers, as one changes one's gloves, but to work with the 
cadres he has. My personal feeling is that Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin will not allow any reshuffles in the 
government.

  [Text] Meanwhile, the new Russian minister of nationalities 
and regional policy affairs is ready to take up his duties. Our 
correspondent reports from Krasnodar with the details. 
  [Correspondent S. Shcherbal] The 43-year-old governor of 
Kuban, Nikolay Yegorov, who has not been released from that post 
yet incidentally, arrived in Moscow today to take up the seat as 
minister of nationalities and regional policy affairs, which he 
has inherited from Sergey Shakhray. 
  [Begin recording] [Ingushetia President Ruslan Aushev] We 
see 
Nikolay Dmitriyevich's appointment as a hopeful sign, and we 
heads of republics and regions must of course help him formulate 
policy. 
  [Yegorov] In my work as a Russian government minister, I 
don't intend to do anything revolutionary, especially in the 
sphere of interethnic relations. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] At one time you did try to use 
harsh measures to extinguish a number of hotbeds of interethnic 
tension that flared up in the kray. In your capacity as 
minister, do you plan to use these sorts of harsh measures on a 
Russia-wide level to extinguish conflicts? 
  [Yegorov] If it is necessary to use harsh measures, if the 
situation demands it, then I do indeed have enough strength and 
will to do that. 
  [K. Zatulin, chairman of State Duma committee for CIS 
affairs] Alexander Dumas the elder commented that blood in the 
south flows more quickly, thus any indigent nobleman from the 
south of France, from Gascogne, who went to Paris would make a 
career for himself faster than his far richer comrade from the 
north, from Normandie or Picardie. I think that what goes for 
France is typical for the south of Russia, too. [end recording]

  [Text] [Ioffe] Sergey Filatov is far from being a noisy 
sort of politician, he is very proper and even affable, and then 
all of a sudden there is a huge fuss in the newspapers about his 
resignation. 
  [Filatov] It was news to me just as to everyone else, all 
the 
more so in that there is nothing behind it all. That is the 
most interesting bit. Two months ago there were attempts to 
bring the president's first aide Viktor Vasilyevich Ilyushin and 
myself into conflict... 
  [Ioffe] On what grounds, if I may ask? 
  [Filatov] Actually, it is hard to say, but I reckon that 
there are nevertheless, a number of political forces that on the 
one hand, want to put their own people in, of course. 
  [Ioffe] Sergey Aleksandrovich Filatov cited the words of 
Gennadiy Zyuganov, to the effect that his party has its men at 
all level. 
  [Filatov] There are lots of people who do not like accord. 
  [Ioffe] As for relations with Viktor Ilyushin, Filatov said 
these have always been good, and will continue to be, for both 
men are busy getting on with the job.

to our commentator after a conference to mark Academician

  [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin is not working on 
any amendments to the Constitution concerning the division of 
powers, Kremlin Chief of Staff Sergey Filatov told INTERFAX. 
(Recently, there have been rumors about the intention of the 
president to submit to the State Duma a number of amendments to 
further delineate the powers of top state bodies -- IF). 
  Filatov emphasized that the Civic Accord Pact had not been 
clear enough on which provisions of the Constitution may be 
amended. He recognized that development of society would make 
it necessary to amend the Constitution. "However, introduction 
of any amendments will be carried out jointly by all power 
structures," he stressed. 
  Filatov did not agree with the point of view of some 
influential politicians who prognosticate a kind of revenge by 
the Soviet system, primarily at the local level and later at the 
federal one. Namely, Chairman of the Russian Movement for 
Democratic Reforms Gavriil Popov shares this concern. 
  Filatov reassured that the principle of division of powers 
was working both in the center and at the level of the 
federation's constituent members. He sees no threat of 
restoration of the Soviet system at the regional level. 
  Filatov believes that the tendency of local representative 
bodies influencing the executive power is not dominant. 
However, he admitted that such attempts took place, "especially 
at the level of the republics." Filatov cited Mordovia as an 
example. A surveying commission composed of legal experts from 
the government and the president's administration, has lately 
come back from Mordovia. The commission concluded that most of 
the recent decisions adopted by the Mordovan Supreme Soviet 
contradicted the Russian Constitution, Filatov pointed out. 
  He made it clear that the Russian president had no intention 
to solve this problem by force. Filatov said that after the 
conversation which had been held with the chairman of the 
Mordovan parliament, it was now possible to hope that the 
parliament's decision on restoration of the Soviet system at the 
regional level would be reviewed.

  [Text] Moscow May 20 TASS -- The recent murder of State 
Duma deputy and member of the new Regional Policy faction Andrey 
Aizderdzis provoked indignation of Russian political circles and 
President Boris Yeltsin, says a statement of Presidential Press 
Secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov. 
  A number of State Duma factions even suggested to remove 
Interior Minister Viktor Yerin from his post. 
  The president has studied the investigation materials, 
motives and circumstances of the murder. In his opinion, the 
Interior Ministry acted swiftly and professionally. The 
ministry's measures against crime and corruption have improved 
as well. 
  Vyacheslav Kostikov was authorized to state that the 
president see no reasons for disciplinary measures as regards 
Viktor Yerin and has full confidence in the Interior Ministry. 
  "He is confident of competence, high professional and 
personal qualities of Viktor Yerin. The question of Yerin's 
removal from his post will not be raised," says the statement.

spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov said in a statement issued in 
Moscow on Friday. This follows a proposal from a number of 
parliamentary factions that the minister be dismissed following 
the recent assassination of Russian deputy Andrey Aizderdzis. 
  The president has examined materials related to the case and 
thinks the ministry's actions to be prompt and impeccable, the 
statement says. It also quotes Yeltsin as saying there has been 
certain progress in the ministry's campaign against crime and 
corruption. 
  The spokesman said the question of Yerin's dismissal was not 
on the agenda.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F>
Nilolay Zherebtsov and Andrey Petrovsky] 
  [Text] Kremlin Chief of Staff Sergey Filatov in an 
interview with Interfax was airing views on Moscow's relations 
with Russian regions. 
  IF [INTERFAX]: What are the center's priorities in relations 
with regional governments? 
  FILATOV: One of the main priorities is the signing of power 
sharing agreements with different parts of the country. The 
negotiating process is under way with Kabardino-Balkaria, 
Bashkiria and Russia's western exclave of Kaliningrad. It will 
take some time to adopt an appropriate federal law. In the 
meantime, each individual republic or region tries to resolve 
the power sharing issue with Moscow in its own way. In my view, 
there are no serious rifts, let alone conflicts, between Russian 
regions or ethnic groups. The main difficulties are economic 
ones. 
  IF: Despite recession, Russia appears to have been spared 
the trouble of major ethnic conflicts, doesn't it? 
  FILATOV: I think it is most important to take advantage of 
the atmosphere of ethnic harmony to be able to meet the economic 
targets the government announced early this year. The thing is 
the government had failed to halt last year's production slump 
because of bitter political confrontation having, as it were, to 
start afresh this year.. 
  But there must be a certain sequence in what we do. The 
government tried to put a firm lid on inflation which has led to 
a further fall in output. What we need most during this painful 
stage of redistribution of labor is political stability. 
  The government faces a formidable job of luring new 
investment and technologies, providing job training programs and 
arranging redistribution of the workforce. It also has to 
contemplate the arrangement of public work and decide what is to 
be done with a would be army of unemployed. 
  Yesterday, I had a meeting with the students of the Moscow 
Energy Institute only to face a barrage of criticism, most of it 
quite justified. I told the audience that most of its 
suggestions could have been put in place in normal conditions 
but when the government had to do so many things at a time. 
  I am sure we will overcome all hardships on the path of 
reforms if people realize the need for civic peace. We will 
manage to achieve the economic targets the president set early 
this year. 
  More importantly, it must be realized that we have had to 
live in warlike conditions for the past 80 years. Millions of 
people have died in various wars. Now is the time to get away 
from the negative trend and banish the very thought of civil 
confrontation.

  [Text] Moscow May 20 TASS -- A difficult situation which 
developed in the Russian economy was the major issue of the 
meeting between Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Chairman of 
the Lower House of the Russian Parliament Ivan Rybkin. 
  Upon completion of the meeting Rybkin informed lawmakers of 
the State Duma about its results. Rybkin pointed out that the 
two discussed problems connected with insolvency in industry and 
measures for the prevention of further production decline. 
  Rybkin said that they discussed measures to be taken by the 
State Duma to give a legislative support to the Treaty of Civic 
Accord. 
  Much attention was given to the budget-94 draft law which 
will be discussed by the State Duma in the second reading and in 
particular, to articles of the draft law concerning needs of the 
Army, education, culture and science. 
  Rybkin said that he had informed the Russian president that 
a 
presidential decree and a resolution of the Russian Government, 
under which a block of buildings in the Okhotny Ryad Street were 
transferred to the State Duma, were not fulfilled by some 
organisations which had not moved out from the building given to 
the State Duma as its new residence. Rybkin voiced satisfaction 
that after his conversation with the Russian president all 
organisations ignoring the resolution were given a strict 
warning to move out until May 26.

  [Text] Moscow May 20 TASS -- According to some 
information, former Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy plans to 
resign as chairman of the Free Russia People's Party (FRPP) and 
to concentrate on the creation of a people's patriotic movement 
"Power". 
  Rutskoy had been a ringleader of the abortive state coup in 
Moscow last October and had been put into prison along with 
other conspirators, following the collapse of the coup. He was 
amnestied by the Russian parliament together with other leaders 
of the coup in a move to reach civic accord in the country. 
  However, he claimed in an interview with the KOMSOMOLSKAYA 
PRAVDA newspaper on Friday that he was not guilty of anything, 
and there was no need to amnesty him. He said that the amnesty 
(incidentally, railroaded through parliament by his supporters 
and opposed by President Yeltsin) was issued by those who were 
eager to cover facts behind the October tragedy. 
  Speaking of party affairs, Vassiliy Lipitskiy, chairman of 
the FRPP Board, claimed in an interview with journalists on 
Friday on the eve of the opening of the second FRPP congress 
that it is too early to speak about the creation of the 
movement and that it will not compete the FRPP in any way. 
  The congress will adopt several documents, including a 
statement formulating the FRPP's tasks for the nearest future, 
which is, in actual fact, tantamount to a party programme. 
  According to the Board chairman who now is the actual leader 
of the party, the FRPP should also decide whether to sign the 
social accord treaty. "It is more likely, the results will be 
negative. But in any case, the party will examine unilateral 
obligations to preserve civil peace," Lipitskiy stressed. 
  Asked by ITAR-TASS about the party's relations with Rutskoy, 
the Board chairman replied that the former vice-president "was 
always somewhat independent of the party, and its members got 
accustomed to this". 
  He expressed doubt that there would be a serious discussion 
at the congress concerning Rutskoy's leadership, although, he 
admitted, "there is critical attitude to some of his 
pronouncements" among party members. 
  In Lipitskiy's opinion, the former vice-president "has his 
basis of support which is expanding". 
  The Board chairman pointed to the Russian Agrarian Party and 
some small parties of social democratic orientation as his 
party's closest allies. Lipitskiy said that the FRPP occupies 
the centrist position, which means social democratic orientation 
under the present conditions in Russia. 
  The Board chairman noted that the Civic Union bloc, of which 
the FRPP was a member, can be recreated only on a new basis. 
Its former idea of partnership between industrial managers and 
hired labour turned to be out of date under the present 
conditions, which predetermined the union's defeat at the 
elections.

  [Text] Moscow May 21 TASS -- Former Vice-President 
Aleksandr Rutskoy who was amnestied by the new Russian 
parliament some time after the abortive state coup in Moscow 
last October, delivered on Saturday an opening speech at the 
second congress of the Free Russia People's Party (FRPP) which 
he heads. 
  He called on the party to take its bearings, spurning down 
"time-serving positions and timidity" and to become a core for a 
broad popular patriotic movement which will take power. 
  He blasted the mass media, spreading, according to Rutskoy, 
"provocative rumours" about his possible withdrawal from the 
party's chairmanship and his differences with party members. 
  "The party should decide who will be its leader to remove 
contradictions and rumours, he continued. Rutskoy also insisted 
that the FRPP should determine its clear-cut position which, 
according to the former vice-president, should concentrate on 
striving for early presidential elections and replacing "the 
anti-popular police regime". 
  "A political party occupying a time-serving position, cannot 
lead the popular masses," Rutskoy added. 
  Acting at future elections as a single whole, patriotic 
forces will win the victory, he claimed. 
  According to the FRPP chairman, the aims of a mass patriotic 
movement will include national cultural and spiritual revival of 
Russia, "restoration of great Russia within the borders of the 
Soviet Union, establishment of law and order in the country and 
creation of a socially oriented economic system. 
  The congress is attended by 149 delegates from 60 regional 
organisations. The forum will debate several documents, 
including a programme-setting statement and several resolutions. 
  Besides, as chairman of the FRPP board Vassily Lipitskiy put 
it, the party will possibly change its name. It regards itself 
a social democratic organisation, and some party members suggest 
that these words should be introduced into its name.

  [Text] The Honorary Chairman of the People's Party of Free 
Russia, ex vice-president Aleksandr Rutskoy has declared that 
the party's prime task must be a fight for early presidential 
elections. Speaking at the opening of a party congress in Moscow 
on Saturday, he called the current official Russian policy 
"economic terror" and stressed that there currently was "an 
unpopular police regime" in power. 
  In Rutskoy's view, the December 12, 1993 elections showed 
the 
collapse of the centrism concept. "There can be no center 
between the robbers and robbed", he noted. In his words, time 
has come to decide whether to agree with "the police regime" or 
form an opposition to it. He believes the party should initiate 
the merger of opposition forces "in a mighty social-patriotic 
movement, capable of leading the people and winning elections." 
The goals of this movement, he said, will be national, 
cultural, and spiritual rebirth of the country, "restoration of 
Russia as a great power within the USSR boundaries:, fight 
against crime, and creation of a prosperous socially-oriented 
economy. 
  At the same time, Rutskoy admitted that adapters continued 
to 
work in the party along with those planted to destroy it. "I 
cannot extend a hand to those who at the most critical moment 
waited to see who would prevail", Rutskoi remarked and added 
"time has come to get rid of the junk." However, he recognized 
as justified the criticism addressed to him that he had paid 
neglected internal party activity and had quite often failed to 
consult party officials bodies in decision-making. [sentence as 
received] 
  Recalling what happened in Moscow in October of 1993, he 
declared: "We will never forget the died [as received] heroes , 
nor will we ever forgive those who shot at parliament." 
  Attending the Congress are 126 delegates from 60 regional 
organizations. The delegates are to endorse a comprehensive 
party declaration and elect the steering bodies. 
  [Moscow INTERFAX in English during the same cast runs an 
additional report: "`Confrontation being stirred up in society, 
may end in a social explosion, because people's tolerance has 
certain limits,' the Honorary Chairman of the Free Russia 
Popular Party, former vice-president of the Russian Federation 
Aleksandr Rutskoy said. 
  ["In his opinion, the Russian president, the State Duma and 
the Federation Council should `listen to the voice of common 
sense and to take a decision on early presidential elections.' 
  ["`If the elections are announced, and one of the parties, 
for example, the Free Russia Popular Party puts forward my 
candidacy, I am not going to refuse,' Rutskoy said. In his 
words, `time is working not for the benefit of those in power.' 
  ["Rutskoy also said that the faction Russia's Choice in the 
State Duma behaves itself `in an insulting way' to the leader of 
the Liberal Democratic Party Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. `No matter 
what convictions Zhirinovskiy holds, he should not be called `a 
fascist,' Rutskoy said." (Quotation marks as received)]

<F P=106> [Video report by correspondent Aleksandr Poklad] </F>
  [Text] [Poklad] The second congress of the People's Party 
of Free Russia [PPFR] was held in Moscow today. A number of 
program documents were adopted and the powers of Aleksandr 
Rutskoy as party leader were confirmed. Having harshly 
criticized the policies of the existing power structures, he set 
the task of creating a nationwide social patriotic movement on 
the basis of the party to which centralism and compromise should 
be alien. In the end, this means the organizational formation 
of an uncompromising opposition, although Aleksandr Rutskoy 
himself is against such a term. 
  [Begin Rutskoy recording] If we are talking about an 
opposition, then it has to be uncompromising. Why not 
uncompromising? What is the point of an opposition otherwise? 
The opposition is there so as not to agree with what is 
happening in the country today, and can you agree with it? [end 
recording] 
  [Poklad] The PPFR program directives are little different 
from the aims proclaimed by many other parties. However, two 
tasks can be singled out--the restoration of the state within 
the frontiers of the USSR and the holding of early presidential 
elections in Russia. The delegates also spoke in favor of 
stepping up work with various sectors of the population and 
increasing the party's electoral readiness. 
  The prospects for the Social Patriotic Movement that 
Aleksandr Rutskoy is trying to organize are as yet unclear. 
However, today it is already possible to say that the 
uncompromising opposition has obtained a leader in him. 
  [Announcer] We have just received a report that the PPFR has 
changed its name to the Russian Social Democratic People's Party 
[Rossiyskaya Sotsial-Demokraticheskaya Narodnaya Partiya]. 
Aleksandr Rutskoy has been voted its chairman by a huge 
majority.

<F P=106> [Georgiy Satarov commentary: "The Commission's Purpose Is </F>
to Ensure a Process of Constant Conciliation"] 
  [Text] The Russian president's message to the Federal 
Assembly is effectively the first document of its kind to 
contain a separate section dedicated to the civil society. 
  Back in March a group of independent experts was formed to 
prepare a concept for the president's legislative initiative in 
this sphere. A parallel movement to achieve accord in our 
society has begun. 
  The Treaty on Social Accord includes proposals on the 
coordinated discussion of the major problems. Hence the idea 
has arisen -- both in development of the message and of the 
Treaty on Social Accord -- to discuss jointly a range of 
problems connected with support for the establishment of a civil 
society in Russia and, in fulfillment of that Treaty, to try to 
advance that area of legislative work organizationally, 
professionally, and in a skillful way. 
  However, bearing in mind that there are quite a few sources 
of legislative initiative and that to date, unfortunately, they 
are operating in a completely isolated and uncoordinated way, 
there must be some kind of blueprint which makes it possible to 
link the legislative process and sets of laws. 
  Work is now being completed on the creation of a mechanism 
for the activity of a conciliation commission, whose main task 
is to ensure a process of constant conciliation in accordance 
with the Treaty. The commission will have to support the work 
of the permanent "roundtables" which correspond to the various 
sections of the Treaty -- "Political Stability in Society," 
"Socioeconomic Policy," and "The Security of the Citizen and 
Society." 
  It is on the activeness of all the parties signatory to the 
Treaty that the speed of the formation of the conciliation 
commission and the "roundtables" will depend. The president's 
structures are working on this problem, and working pretty 
strenuously.

  [Text] The current crisis in Russia is unprecedented in 
world history and is characterized by the geopolitical, social 
and moral break-up of society, said leader of the Communist 
Party of Russia, Gennadiy Zyuganov, addressing students and 
professors of Moscow University Thursday. 
  He said that operating in Russia is the regime of colonial 
democracy where the U.S. dollar dominates, English is commonly 
used and Russian culture is deteriorating. Zyuganov believes 
that events are developing in Russia along three lines: Russia 
is turning into a mafiosi-criminal state, the country is on the 
brink of a civil war or the coalition of left-wing and patriotic 
forces may come to power. 
  Stressing that a civil war in a country which has 27,000 
nuclear warheads could cause a catastrophe, Zyuganov expressed 
hope that the situation will develop along the third channel. 
He said that representatives of the Communists, the Agrarian 
Party and other opposition organizations had managed to stand at 
the head of local bodies of power in 70 territories of the 
Russian federation. 
  He said that only a "constructive program" could become the 
basis for civic peace in Russia. Such a program would include a 
change of political course, with priority given to power 
engineering, agriculture, science and culture, combating crime, 
the elimination of social inequality, the scrapping of 
privatization and the restoration of the Union. 
  He believes that the country is now like a nuclear reactor 
which is being overused. Under these conditions, he said, 
operators must be sure to press the right buttons at the right 
moment, otherwise there may be an explosion, said Zyuganov. 
  He also gave a characterization of certain well-known 
politicians. He said that Yegor Gaydar had settled into the 
wrong office and found himself unable to look out the window and 
introduce corrections in the course of reforms. 
  Anatoliy Chubays, he said, deceived everybody with the 
privatization campaign and is "now selling out Russia wholesale 
and retail." He said that later generations will denounce 
Gennadiy Burbulis for being the cause of the Soviet Union's 
break-up. 
  Zyuganov said that the state post was too difficult a job 
for 
Ruslan Khasbulatov. And that only at the second stage of his 
political career he understood his mistakes but it was too late 
to correct them. 
  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy resembles a younger brother of Boris 
Nikolayevich Yeltsin and in essence the LDP platform differs 
little from what the present executive power is doing, he said. 
  Zyuganov also said that at the moment the Communist Party 
has 
550,000 members which is two times more than in all other 
parties. The scale of public opinion leans to the left, he 
emphasized. 
  About 500 people listened to the speech by the leader of the 
Communist Party leader. Two-thirds of the audience were elderly 
people rather than students, despite taking place in the Moscow 
State University..

  [Text] Communist parties of the former Soviet republics are 
about to adjourn after a two-day closed-door conference at 
Gorkiy Leninskiye near Moscow. 
  Chairman Oleg Shenin of the Council of the Union of 
Communist 
parties -- the Communist Party of the Soviet Union told Interfax 
Communist parties of all the former Soviet republics, excluding 
Kazakhstan, attended the conference. Russia was represented by 
the Communist party of the Russian Federation (Gennadiy 
Zyuganov), the Communists' Union (Aleksey Prigarin) and the 
Russian Communist Workers' party whose delegation was led by 
First Secretary Viktor Tyulkin. The leader of the party's 
Moscow organization Viktor Anpilov took no part in the 
conference. 
  According to Shenin, the Communist parties exchanged views 
in 
a constructive and open spirit. They agreed the union of their 
republics must be restored and, Shenin said, they must 
coordinate action. 
  The conference discussed the possibility of holding a second 
congress of the peoples of the Soviet Union in the fall of 1994. 
The event would be expected to focus on the restoration of the 
unitary state. The conference is to close with decisions on the 
celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Soviet Union's 
victory in World War II and Lenin's 125th birthday anniversary.

<F P=106> [Lev Sigal report in the "Opposition Is Looking for a </F>
Leader" column: "No Accord in the Name of Zorkin Is Working Out 
Yet"] 
  [Text] The Accord in the Name of Russia has so far failed 
to emerge as a powerful opposition super-movement. The founding 
conference of this organization, scheduled for Thursday, did not 
take place because organizational and technical preparations for 
it were not completed in time. As KOMMERSANT-DAILY predicted in 
its 13 May issue, the majority of opposition leaders today are 
not particularly interested in the accord. 
  The prospects for the Accord in the Name of Russia project 
still look uncertain. The movement initiators will apparently 
have to abandon their plans to encompass the entire opposition 
or at least a greater part of it. Ilya Kostantinov, the leader 
of the once notorious National Salvation Front, told 
KOMMERSANT-DAILY that he for one does not know anything about 
the organizational efforts by Mr. Zorkin and company and 
expressed doubt that the accord's founding conference will ever 
take place. 
  Apart from project coordinator Valeriy Zorkin, some activity 
toward the accord is being shown by Aleksandr Tsipko, Sergey 
Glazyev, Aman Tuleyev, and Petr Romanov. At the same time the 
initiative group has somewhat distanced itself from Aleksandr 
Rutskoy, who is now engaged with his own "Russian" organization, 
The State [Derzhava], as well as from Aleksandr Prokhanov. The 
initiators have shifted to the center somewhat and, unlike the 
ex- vice president, act on the assumption that the hopes for 
early presidential elections are unrealistic and therefore do 
not consider the question of presidential candidates. True, 
they say that Mr. Zorkin would like to see Aleksandr 
Solzhenitsyn as leader of the nation. 
  No doubt, the more time elapses between the emergence of the 
idea of the Accord and its structural organization, and the more 
stable the political situation in the country becomes, the 
farther the interests of the movement initiators are drifting 
apart. 
  Thus, observers point out that Gennadiy Zyuganov can now act 
independently. Aman Tuleyev and Petr Romanov are playing out a 
Siberian regional card; some other people would like to create a 
kind of industrial division of the Agrarian of Democratic Party. 
In this light, it is only "an opposition leaders club" whose 
formalization appears more or less realistic. Importantly, no 
one here possesses any substantial monetary resources; only 
communists and agrarians have human resources; and only Mr. 
Zorkin is trying to create an apparatus. So far, as movement 
cofounder Vasiliy Lipitskiy told KOMMERSANT-DAILY, a conference 
of movement supporters has been scheduled for 28 May which will 
apparently proclaim itself a National Council. The organizers 
hope for large and representative delegations to arrive from 
Siberia, Central Chernozem Region, and the South of Russia. 
Apparently the failure of the unification project will indicate 
that the crisis in the opposition has aggravated further. 
KOMMERSANT-DAILY will report on the conference results on 31 
May.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Ivanova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 20 TASS -- Twenty per cent of Russians 
surveyed said they approve of the work of President Yeltsin. 
About the same number had a good opinion of local authorities 
as well, according to a survey conducted by the "Public Opinion" 
fund among the country's urban and rural residents. 
  Answers to sociologists' questions concerning the future 
presidential elections revealed two tendencies. The first shows 
that, no matter who the presidential candidates are, from one 
fifth to one quarter of the respondents do not intend to vote. 
  The second trend shows that President Yeltsin still has the 
highest rating among possible candidates for the presidency. 
When asked to imagine that Yeltsin and Zhirinovskiy were the 
only candidates to pass the first round, 27 per cent of 
respondents said they would vote for Yeltsin, while 11 per cent 
favored the Liberal Democratic leader. In the same situation 
Yeltsin came out on top of former vice-president Aleksandr 
Rutskoy 21 to 11 per cent, and proved more popular than his 
current prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, 15 to 8 per cent. 
  The sociologists' inquiry was answered by, with differences 
according to the particular question, from 1139 to 2468 
respondents.

<F P=106> [Vitaliy Korionov article: "An Ally? A Client? An Enemy?"] </F>
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Many will remember that soon 
after he took the Kremlin throne, the incumbent president 
described Russia's position as a country staying "in the 
antechamber": Soon another "revelation" followed: Apparently 
Russia needs to be "raised from its knees." And now other 
countries have been asked to use "vy" [formal mode of address] 
in talking with Russia. [passage omitted] 
  In its time Turkey was called "the sick man" of Europe. Now, 
increasingly, foreign press describes Russia as a seriously 
ailing state with a heart ready to break. Zbigniew Brzezinski 
reflects: If Russia is not an enemy anymore, what is it then: an 
ally, or a client, or simply an enemy that has suffered a defeat? 
  We shall not discuss today the main reason for Russia's 
deplorable condition. Yet one cannot but admit that the present 
policy makers indeed possess an exceptional talent for 
destruction. It is not just anyone that is capable within a few 
years of bringing one of the "superpowers" to its "knees," 
moreover with its own hands. [passage omitted] 
  The rapid destruction of Russian industry and agriculture 
and 
the downfall of science make Russia's position on the world 
arena all the more shaky. It would be naive to suppose that the 
Western business world would seriously reckon with a country on 
the verge of an economic catastrophe. To be sure, red carpets 
are being unrolled before the Russian president. But what is 
happening in reality? [passage omitted] 
  At the end of August the last Russian soldiers will leave 
Germany -- the soldiers who, at the command of the whole world, 
made a decisive contribution to smashing the Nazi regime. Yet 
representatives of western states -- participants in the 
anti-Hitler coalition -- refused to take part in the sendoff 
ceremony. What cunning political calculations lie behind this? 
  Yet Russia's humiliation does not stop here. From an 
interview that the Russian president had with DER SPIEGEL we 
have learned an amazing piece of news: Yeltsin has called on 
the Bundeswehr "to take on peace-keeping missions not only in 
Yugoslavia but also in the restive CIS states." An excellent 
"present" to the peoples of the former USSR on the 50th 
anniversary of our Victory in the Great Patriotic War! 
  Seeing such policy by the Kremlin, the Pentagon is stepping 
up pressure on Moscow, demanding that joint U.S. and Russian 
military exercises be held in Russia's heartland. "The working 
people of Orenburg and Volga regions, as well as all people of 
Russia," says a joint statement issued on this occasion by 14 
public organizations of the region and titled "U.S. Troops Have 
Nothing To Do On Our Soil", are pained to see how, in the course 
of and anti-people's reform, the country's military and economic 
might and its political authority are falling. The ever growing 
unceremoniousness, with which Western powers are openly 
interfering in Russia's internal affairs, arouses anger and 
indignation." 
  Many of the world's press publications also see Russia's 
national humiliation in the unscrupulousness shown toward Moscow 
by the NATO countries delivering air strikes on Bosnia, not 
deeming it necessary even to inform Russia about them in advance. 
  The picture will be more complete if it is recalled that 
gentlemen reformers have driven the country into the trap of 
powerful Western financial centers. The clutch of the IMF and 
the World Bank is merciless. According to THE WALL STREET 
JOURNAL, Russia already owes the West more than $80 billion, of 
which $32 billion is to be paid this year. Experts on this 
problems, for instance, French Professor Bernard Notain, warn: 
"The ongoing enslavement is setting the stage for a subsequent 
dismemberment of the country." 
  The logical question is: Who in fact has brought Russia down 
to its knees and forced it out into the antechamber? 
  FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU states, "Russia is in no position to 
demonstrate that cooperation with it can be fruitful, and 
therefore it is merely imitating activity, conditioned by 
helplessness." 
  Where will the leaders -- who rather than ensure effective 
protection of the country's national interests, are only capable 
of imitating policy -- steer Russia?

<F P=106> [Irina Savvateyeva report: "Premier Strengthening </F>
Positions"] 
  [Text] The last few weeks have seen some quite active 
personnel changes in the government. The best-known are the 
elevation of Nikolay Travkin and the removal of Sergey Shakhray 
from a ministerial position. There have also been other, 
less-noticed events which are nonetheless very symptomatic. 
  The edict on Travkin's appointment as minister without 
portfolio was drawn up by the Presidential Staff. But analysts 
agree that the Democratic Party leader's promotion to the 
corridors of executive power did not happen without 
Chernomyrdin's knowledge. It is entirely possible that the 
initiative even came from the premier. At any rate, observers 
consider it beyond dispute that Viktor Stepanovich's position is 
now so strong that the president can no longer afford to make 
any changes to the government without the consent of its leader. 
  Why is Travkin needed? 
  World experience shows that it is usually representatives of 
major political structures that are appointed minister without 
portfolio. And, in terms of their influence, such ministers are 
often equivalent to deputy premiers. 
  But it does not seem as though Travkin was in a position to 
claim such a role. The faction he heads in parliament is one of 
the smallest -- with just 15 people. The party he created is 
virtually collapsing. 
  Apropos of which, analysts believe that the Democratic Party 
of Russia [DPR] has no future. Its regional structures are 
coming apart at the seams. Thus, in early 1994 the DPR's entire 
Volgograd cell -- the largest political structure in the region, 
with no less than 2,000 members -- left to join "Russia's 
Choice." 
  Judging by everything, Chernomyrdin by no means needs 
Travkin 
because he is a DPR member. The newspapers have been 
speculating about his possible appointment as the government's 
plenipotentiary representative in the Duma. Official sources 
are not confirming this report, but it is entirely possible that 
Nikolay Ilich was asked to join the government precisely to 
strengthen contacts with deputies. Ultimately, he may not be 
called an official representative, but to all intents and 
purposes that is what he will be. 
  Analysts are assuming that Travkin could quite easily take 
on 
this role. First, he has a great deal of experience of 
political work. Second, he has the image of a sound, 
down-to-earth regular guy. So it may well be assumed that 
Travkin could be used in the Duma as Chernomyrdin's envoy above 
all with a view to conducting behind-the-scenes talks with 
representatives of factions for whom Nikolay Ilich's figurative 
and accessible way of setting out an argument is far more 
convincing than academic speeches by professors and other such 
know-it-alls who are "former laboratory chiefs." 
  However, Viktor Stepanovich might also have some problems 
with Nikolay Ilich: Travkin is not somebody else's team player. 
He is a leader and highly ambitious. Although.... 
Chernomyrdin is said to be very good at cutting people down to 
size. He is not a man to be trifled with.... 
  As for Shakhray's removal from the position of minister for 
nationalities affairs, this initiative most probably came direct 
from the president and his entourage. It is thought that the 
main cause of their differences was their different approach to 
the settlement of relations with Chechnya. 
  This question might seem to be a separate issue, but it 
touches on some serious problems. Resolving it today will mean 
laying the last brick in the foundations of the Russian state 
and ending the period of its initial construction. 
  The relieving of Shakhray of his duties should hardly be 
seen 
as weakening the premier's position. First, interethnic 
problems have traditionally been the prerogative of the 
Presidential Staff, and the premier kept away from them. 
Second, observers consider Shakhray's achievements in this post 
not to have been significant enough to result in a 
behind-the-scenes struggle over him between the president and 
the premier. 
  But let us leave the vice premiers to one side. Over the 
past few weeks there have been some interesting events at deputy 
minister level. The chronology is as follows. Decisions were 
drawn up by the government apparatus for a closed session of the 
Cabinet of Ministers Presidium on the dismissal of Yakov 
Urinson, first deputy minister of economics, and Deputy Finance 
Minister Sergey Aleksashenko. But, on Premier Chernomyrdin's 
initiative, the question of their dismissal was not examined at 
the presidium session -- both received a reprimand. And the 
other day, by a Chernomyrdin directive, Deputy Minister Yakov 
Urinson was accorded status equivalent to a minister. 
  I would note for reference purposes that Sergey Aleksashenko 
is a young financier. He is known as a top-ranking specialist 
who has liberal economic views. He is known for his independent 
behavior and judgments. Yakov Urinson is a career state 
planner. In liberal democratic circles he is known as one of 
the first and few apparatchiks of the old school who actively 
supported the idea of market reform. He is said to be 
particularly favored and respected by Chernomyrdin. 
  It seems as though there have been some major clashes over 
these two people (above all, Urinson) between apparatus leader 
Vladimir Kvasov and the premier himself. 
  The premier's desire of late to support the liberal-market 
wing of the government is due to a desire to preserve some 
balance of power within the Cabinet of Ministers. 
  After the too-independent Yegor Gaydar and Boris Fedorov 
were 
"forced out" of the Cabinet of Ministers, Chernomyrdin was left 
one-on-one with emboldened sector lobbyists whose appetite and 
the pressure they exert are constantly increasing and already 
pose a serious threat of catastrophic inflation. 
  The drama of the situation is also increased by the fact 
that 
the leader of this camp -- Oleg Soskovets -- is number two in 
the government. Chernomyrdin has been forced to leave 
operational work to him increasingly frequently of late, because 
the premier himself is becoming an increasingly political figure 
-- he has to control relations with parliament and the 
presidential structure. 
  But Soskovets, left to his own devices with the economy, 
seems to have been making a lot of mistakes. For instance, at 
the recent congress of the Association of Russian Banks he 
suggested that the bankers use one-third of all their banking 
funds to invest in production, and half of their 
currency-dealing profits to support the agro-industrial complex. 
It is hardly surprising if, after such statements, money which 
had hitherto remained here starts flowing out of the country. 
  Thus, the balance in the government is being seriously 
upset. 
Analysts believe that there is a very great likelihood that 
Soskovets, Zaveryukha, and Co. will prove the stronger. In this 
situation the premier has been forced to support the camp of the 
liberal free-marketeers in the government in order to save the 
economy and his own political future. 
  This camp, which has now been considerably weakened, is 
represented primarily by Aleksandr Shokhin and Sergey Dubinin. 
But the role of Yakov Urinson has considerably increased of 
late. And this is why. Acting Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin, 
as insurance against the anger of dissatisfied lobbyists, is not 
refusing any money to anyone, but is proposing that the money be 
found from investment funds. And Urinson is in charge of 
investment. So it is not the acting finance minister but 
Urinson who has to tell those desperate for money that the cash 
is not there. 
  It is curious that the anti-Urinson campaign in the 
government (along with the anti-Aleksashenko campaign) is being 
headed by Vladimir Kvasov, leader of the apparatus, who has 
clearly been staking a claim recently to the status of 
independent politician. It is obvious that the civil servants' 
leader cannot be said to wield the same clout as the premier. 
Observers believe that Kvasov would be out of the picture in a 
trice if he started really annoying Chernomyrdin. 
  In short, Viktor Stepanovich is not currently to be envied. 
What he needs in the government now is another Fedorov -- only 
one who talked a bit less and was able to look like a 
subordinate when required.

  [Text] Moscow May 20 TASS -- Economic measures designed to 
combat the crisis in Russia were discussed by President Yeltsin 
and the State Duma speaker during their meeting in the Kremlin 
today, the Russian president told journalists. 
  According to Yeltsin his conversation with Ivan Rybkin 
carried on the four-hour discussion the president had with 
industrialists and entrepreneurs on Thursday concerning a 
package of presidential decrees on economic reform which are 
being prepared now. 
  Yeltsin stressed that the press misrepresented his statement 
on the possible collapse of the economy on Thursday. "The 
collapse may occur if we do not take steps to overcome the 
crisis. We must make all efforts not to let the worst to 
happen," the president said.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 23 TASS -- President Boris Yeltsin signed 
six economic decrees on Monday which, according to his economic 
adviser Aleksandr Livshits, allow the government to speed up 
reforms. 
  Livshits told a briefing that "true reforms in the Russian 
economy have not begun yet" and that the presidential decrees 
will help to initiate them. 
  One of the documents instructs the government to submit a 
lawbill to parliament which will decrease the major taxes by 
10-20 per cent, including the VAT and profit tax, and grant an 
easy taxation regime to joint ventures engaged in production. 
The total number of taxes is also to be decreased. 
  Another decree abolishes the system of quoting and licensing 
exports which Livshits called "an atavism of socialist economy". 
Privileges in import duties are also cancelled. 
  Besides, Yeltsin ordered enterprises to pay their debts to 
each other and wages to employees by converting finances on 
their hard currency accounts. The absence of circulating assets 
can no longer be used as an explanation for non-payments. 
  Another decree obliges all legal entities to register with 
taxation services before opening bank accounts. Otherwise they 
will be fined and then closed. 
  "Now the government has a normative base to boost reforms, a 
base which, regrettably, the parliament does not hurry to 
provide. The government has to initiate a concrete programme of 
actions", Livshits said.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Yezhov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 20 TASS -- Russia has her own way of 
entering the market, her own model of development, announced 
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin on Thursday at a meeting with 
the heads of enterprises and organisations in the spheres of 
industry, construction and transportation. The meeting was held 
immediately after another signing ceremony during which business 
and organisation heads affixed their names to the Treaty on 
Social Accord. 
  Chernomyrdin stressed that the treaty is a historically 
important document which creates the conditions for the 
stabilisation of Russia's political and economic life. Russia 
is paying a steep price for reforms, the premier noted, and gave 
a detailed account of the economic situation in the country. 
  The prime minister declared that the government's number one 
task was to keep spending within the parameters of the budget. 
A series of presidential decrees and governmental resolutions 
have already been prepared with the goal of improving the 
economic situation and strengthening the Policy of Social 
Accord. These steps are designed to "redirect the restructuring 
of the economy in favor of the domestic producer", he said. 
  The premier reffered, in particular, to the lowering of 
several tax rates this year, to the cancellation of taxes on 
investments, to the significant lowering of customs duties on 
oil, gas, aluminum, pulp and the other main components of the 
Russian export, as well as the cancellation of quotas and 
mandatory licensing for exports. This summer will already 
witness the lowering of the amount companies are required to put 
into the social security fund, which is one form of taxes. As 
the government implements its plan to sharply improve the 
efficiency of the tax-collecting agencies, it hopes to be able 
to reduce the over-all tax load by 10 to 20 per cent next year. 
  According to Chernomyrdin, the government envisions 
requiring 
banks to report the opening of an account by a firm, and also 
taking additional measures on debt circulation, including the 
possibility of extinguising the debts of unviable enterprises by 
confiscating their property. 
  The premier especially pointed out the necessity of 
strengthening executive discipline on every level. "Without 
discipline we will not be able to do anything in this country", 
he emphasized. 
  He said that regulatory measures would be adopted to 
decrease 
the salary gap in various sectors of the economy, including in 
the government.

Relations May Merge With Ministry of the Economy"] 
  [Text] All economic policy should be coordinated from one 
center, which could be the Russian Federation Ministry of the 
Economy. So said Yevgeniy Yasin, leader of the Russian 
Federation Presidential Staff Analysis Center, in an exclusive 
interview for a BIZNES-TASS correspondent. 
  What would the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations do, 
given that there are no state foreign economic associations? It 
would be expected to work out customs tarrifs, foreign economic 
regulation, and so on. But these instruments also constitute 
highly important instruments of structural policy. 
  "So it is that, from my viewpoint, the concentration of 
forces in the Ministry of the Economy is the sensible option for 
the purposes of hammering out a uniform economic policy. There 
are a number of new people right now who think rationally and 
who are capable of taking decisions which would be useful to the 
country," Yevgeniy Yasin concluded.

<F P=106> [Yelena Yakovleva report: "Can Russia Get By Without </F>
Importing Grain? We Will Know the Answer in the Fall"] 
  [Text] Will Russia be buying grain abroad this year or 
will it make do with its own resources? 
  Despite the frequent statements by Vice Premier Aleksandr 
Zaveryukha to the effect that there are enough grain reserves in 
the country to enable us to do without imports, this issue is 
keeping Western business circles in a state of tension. 
  For example, the British weekly PUBLIC LEDGER has stated 
that 
"some Russians" made an appearance on the U.S. market at the 
beginning of May and "intimated that they require grain 
immediately" (250,000 tonnes of durum wheat and 150,000 tonnes 
of soft wheat). These Russians were Leonid Cheshinskiy, 
president of the "Roskhleboprodukt" RKK [expansion unknown], and 
Aleksandr Belik, president of the "Eksportkhleb" Joint-Stock 
Company. 
  Petr Tolstopyatenko, deputy director of the "Zerno" firm 
(the 
former Main Administration for Grain Purchases) confirmed that 
this trip did take place, but it does not provide an answer to 
the question of whether or not Russia will import grain. It is 
impossible to give an answer to this question until spring 
sowing has been completed, which will not be before 1 June at 
the earliest. In his opinion, the prospects for the Russian 
harvest are good: Crops sown in the fall have wintered well, 
and the area sown in the spring is getting bigger without any 
exhortations or goading, since the production of this sort of 
wheat is highly profitable. 
  According to Tolstopyatenko, the country possesses both 
"emergency" state reserves of grain (approximately 18 million 
tonnes) and nonstate reserves. Thus, kolkhozes and sovkhozes 
have been holding 700,000 tonnes of wheat in storage at their 
elevators since last harvest. There are reserves of millet for 
making course-ground millet, oats, and corn for making groats. 
So rumors about the need for immediate supplies have been 
exaggerated, most likely by the Western press. At least, Leonid 
Cheshinskiy did not recognize himself in the story as it was 
portrayed by the Western press. 
  Andrey Sizov, general director of the "SovEkon" research 
center, explained that L. Cheshinskiy and A. Belik did indeed 
visit the U.S. Department of Agriculture at the beginning of May 
and asked the price of U.S. grain. But they were talking about 
a commercial deal rather than state purchases. The independent 
firm "Roskhleboprodukt," pursuing its private interests, wanted 
to buy 400,000 tonnes of wheat for its own money without taking 
out government loans to do so, which used to be the norm. 
  Asked why the corporation should wish to purchase grain 
abroad when, according to A. Zaveryukha, reserves of home-grown 
grain total 18 million tonnes and there is probably even more 
stored away in kolkhoz barns, Andrey Sizov replied that the 
corporation is doubtless making preparations for a coming grain 
price war. This very day the Russian Agriculture Ministry 
announced that agricultural producers are asking 180,000-200,000 
rubles per tonne of grain. If the high cost of transportation 
and storage is added to this, Russian grain could work out more 
expensive than grain from overseas: The Russians were offering 
the Americans grain at $100 a tonne (including freight). All 
the indications are that "Roskhleboprodukt" is looking for a 
cheap commodity to beat down the price of grain from the new 
harvest on the Russian market. 
  It is true that the Americans did not sell their grain at 
$100 a tonne, thinking this to be too cheap. But there is also 
the European market, where grain is traditionally more expensive 
while transportation is cheaper. 
  In Andrey Sizov's opinion, "Roskhleboprodukt's" emergence on 
the world market as an independent commercial organization is 
well timed: The state would be obliged to purchase U.S. grain 
since it is bound by credit relations. But the fact that the 
market can be exploited is in itself gratifying. 
  And so A. Zaveryukha's assurances remain valid, he is 
responsible for state reserves and has the right to draw his own 
conclusions. The "Roskhleboprodukt" corporation has announced 
its presence in the world market on the basis of its own 
commercial interests, the harvest forecasts will be clarified at 
the beginning of June, and we will get a precise answer to the 
question of whether our country can do without grain imports in 
the fall. 
  According to data from "SovEkon," the chances of exporting 
Russian grain abroad are not very great. For example, the 
country has small rye reserves, but rye is not much in demand on 
the world market. 
  Reorienting ourselves toward imports from CIS countries is 
also an unreliable option: Last year our trading partner 
Kazakhstan delivered 1 million tonnes of grain under the 
intergovernmental agreement instead of the promised 3 million 
tonnes. Judging by the weather and fuel problems that have been 
dogging the Kazakh harvest, supplies are unlikely to increase 
this year.

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Kholodov report: "It Turns Out that Admirals Can </F>
Sink, Too. Underwater Currents in the Pacific..."] 
  [Text] Despite strict official explanations, many officers 
at the Defense Ministry and the General Staff are more and more 
often comparing the explosions of the Pacific Fleet arsenals 
with those that rocked the North Caucasus during the withdrawal 
of the Russian Army from the area. One is getting the 
impression that the Defense Ministry is "disarming" itself in 
this unconventional fashion by destroying excess reserves 
without taking any unnecessary trouble. Suggestions that Admiral 
Gurinov, commander in chief of the Pacific Fleet, may have been 
fired for reasons other than the latest explosion also incline 
one toward this theory. 
  The situation at the Northern Fleet, say, is hardly any 
better, if not much worse. While an arsenal blew up at the 
Pacific Fleet, the Northern Fleet saw a much more serious 
incident: nuclear materials were stolen twice within a month 
there. But the fleet commander has emerged from the incidents 
unscathed. 
  Once he arrived in the fleet following the tragedy on the 
Russkiy island last year, Admiral Gurinov launched a flurry of 
activity, trying to create some semblance of a Navy out of the 
Pacific Fleet, or rather out of its remnants. But the inertia 
of disintegration had gone so far that the energetic admiral was 
scarcely able to accomplish anything within so short a period. 
Meanwhile, Grachev waited for reports of drastic change. But 
no rosy reports were forthcoming. Gurinov reported to Moscow 
that the situation was extremely unfavorable in virtually all 
areas. Moreover, on that same Russkiy island several more 
tragic incidents occurred, also because of paralysis; it was 
ordered to keep them strictly secret. The fleet continued to 
degenerate. Furthermore, the new commander appeared to have 
decided to put an end to lavish receptions for ministerial 
commissions, a move that added fuel to the fire. 
  But according to an old tradition of top authorities in 
Russia it was "something personal" that appears was the last 
straw. A Japanese company undertook to mediate the sale of the 
Pacific Fleet's 12 decommissioned diesel submarines to North 
Korea. Somehow the State Property Committee also stuck to the 
deal drawing on support from a very high-ranking official at the 
Defense Ministry. Once the first two submarines were sent to 
North Korea for dismantling, a universal outcry was raised that 
the North Koreans could use the submarines as combat ships 
(after repairs and the installation of weapons). Journalists 
demanded explanations from the Pacific Fleet command. 
  Then the angered admiral Gurinov took a step unheard of in 
the Armed Forces. In his interview for a major news agency he 
said that the deal was for some reason sponsored by the State 
Property Committee and was struck at the consent of the defense 
minister, who did not even think it necessary to advise the 
Pacific Fleet commander of what percentage of the deal the fleet 
would get. A number of informed sources at the Defense Ministry 
started openly saying that Gurinov's career after that could be 
considered finished. 
  At a meeting of the Defense Ministry collegium in early May, 
where the level of combat training of the Army and the Navy in 
the first six months of this year was assessed, Grachev, as the 
saying goes, razed the Pacific Fleet to the ground. 
  Naval commanders are becoming increasingly petty. These are 
not Ushakov, Nakhimov, or Kornilov. This time, Russia has lost 
yet another "unlucky" admiral. To all appearances, he fell 
victim to intrigues at the ministerial palace, not battles for 
improving the fleet's combat readiness.

<F P=106> [Boris Glebov report under the "Details" rubric: </F>
"Ammunition Explosion Undermined Admiral's Career"] 
  [Text] The blowing up of ammunition dumps of the Pacific 
Fleet's Air Force has evidently irreversibly undermined the 
official career of Admiral Georgiy Gurinov, commander of the 
Pacific Fleet. But his removal from his post and the 
appointment of Vice Adm. Igor Khmelnov to act as commander have 
certainly not sent the Pacific Fleet's officers into great 
raptures. Moreover, many of the fleet's cadre officers are 
openly voicing their categorical protest at such a substitution. 
  One Pacific Fleet officer, who asked not to be named, 
declared that the fleet's officers are displeased because Vice 
Adm. Khmelnov (until recently Adm. Gurinov's deputy) does not, 
unfortunately, command significant authority in the Pacific 
Fleet. Moreover, some Pacific Fleet officers directly name Vice 
Adm. Khmelnov among those probably responsible for the recent 
disaster (the blowing up of the Pacific Fleet Air Force's combat 
supplies)! 
  The point is that directly after a similar explosion in the 
Pacific Fleet last year it was Vice Adm. Khmelnov who was 
entrusted with investigating the causes of what happened and 
taking measures to prevent the possibility of a repetition of 
such disasters in the future. The vice admiral reported back on 
the work done. Now a year has passed, there has been a new and 
far more terrible disaster...and Pacific Fleet officers are 
amazed that Vice Adm. Khmelnov is at once being appointed to 
command the fleet, and is being appointed at a time when we can 
still see the smoking ruins of the weapons dumps for whose 
safety Vice Adm. Khmelnov personally was responsible.... 
  Flagrant sloppiness and negligence in guarding the arsenal 
caused the Pacific Fleet's aviation dumps to blow up. 
  The Pacific Fleet's counterintelligence staffers have 
established that one of the sentries, during his rest period 
after being relieved from his post, found an electrical assembly 
of a missile's solid-propellant booster in the dump's grounds 
and started taking it apart with a knife. Another sentry of the 
same shift was nearby. A blow from the knife caused the 
propellant charge to ignite, and the sentry could think of 
nothing better to do than to throw the burning electrical 
assembly into a thicket of last year's grass, which at once 
caught fire. A stack of rockets was nearby! The fire embraced 
it, and a few minutes later an explosion thundered forth. 
  The sentries fled the scene without taking measures to 
extinguish the fire or notifying the unit's command. 
  The garrison's military prosecutor's office has instituted 
criminal proceedings in this regard, and the investigation is 
continuing.

<F P=106> [Ilya Bulavinov report under the "News Conference by Army </F>
Commander in Chief" rubric: "Pavel Grachev Comes To Know His 
Friends in Need"] 
  [Text] Even at a critical time when the Army's fate 
effectively hangs in the balance, the Russian top brass have 
remained true to the principle of unity of command and only come 
closer together in the face of an "external" threat of 
underfinancing. This at least was proved by the results of 
yesterday's news conference by Colonel General Vladimir Semenov, 
commander in chief of the Army. 
  General Semenov started his speech with comments on the 
KOMMERSANT-DAILY material published on 19 May, which spoke about 
the possible heightening of tensions among top commanders of the 
Russian Armed Forces following the adoption of the 1994 draft 
federal budget. The general pointed out as an unquestionably 
positive development that the spirit of the Defense Ministry 
collegium "under the current minister" differs significantly 
from what it was before 1991. In his view, commanders are now 
free to voice their opinions on various problems, whether or not 
they coincide with those of the minister At the same time, if 
the collegium makes any decision "we are obliged to implement 
it." Precisely this scenario was predicted, among others, by 
KOMMERSANT-DAILY observers in the material cited by Mr. Semenov. 
  Given that, one could make a more accurate suggestion. The 
generals' reluctance to use as auspicious a subject as the 
budget for criticizing the minister's activity appears to 
testify not only to Pavel Grachev's firm positions at the 
ministry itself, but also to a lack of serious complaints about 
him from Boris Yeltsin. The latter suggestion was confirmed by 
Vyacheslav Kostikov, who said at a briefing yesterday that the 
president fully supported Pavel Grachev politically and morally. 
Otherwise, the generals, who tend to be keenly sensitive to 
upcoming political upheavals, would not have spoken so kindly 
about their current boss's activity. 
  As for the content of the news conference, General Semenov, 
as expected, complained of a lack of money. Nonetheless, in his 
words, the Army's prospects do not look altogether hopeless.

    [Editorial Report] Moscow Mayak Radio Network in Russian at 
1830 GMT on 20 May, in an item from the "Slavyanka" program of 
the Russian Defense Ministry, carries a report on the 
controversy over the defense expenditure projected in Russia's 
federal budget. It includes undated interviews with Sergey 
Yushenkov, Russian State Duma defense committee chairman, and 
Russian Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin. On the subject 
of a reduced defense budget, Yushenkov says the following: 
  "A situation is emerging whereby the reduction of 
expenditure 
on defense is already, if you like, crossing a definite 
physiological boundary beyond which disintegration begins. In 
principle, it is no longer possible to reduce defense 
expenditure, because all of this could assume a catastrophic 
appearance. 
  "In this connection, I'll just cite one instance linked to a 
recent event: the explosion of the stores on the turf. This 
was a direct consequence of the Defense Ministry being neither 
properly funded nor sufficiently equipped to maintain, store, 
and guard these munitions. Sixty-five trillion rubles is the 
minimum figure." 
  On the effect underfunding is having on Russia's 
technological defense capability, Kokoshin says: 
  "Our misfortune and our greatness is that traditionally 
everything we have that is most valuable has been concentrated 
in the defense complex. If we lose that now, we will find 
ourselves hurled back 10 years. We wouldn't recover from that 
for a very long time. History won't forgive us if we lose that 
now." 
  The Mayak reporter then reports that Yushenkov suspects the 
cuts are not based on economic considerations alone, saying: 
"In the opinion of Sergey Yushenkov, it cannot be ruled out 
that certain forces have an interest in seeing a sharp cut in 
defense outlay. In this way they are counting on aggravating 
the social tension in the armed forces and using it for their 
political aims."

<F P=106> [Video report by correspondent Aleksandr Gerasimov; from the </F>
"Itogi" program] 
  [Text] Last week passions again broke out around the 
Russian budget. As our program predicted last week, the Defense 
Ministry attempted to increase budget expenditure on the Armed 
Forces and the military-industrial complex. Apart from that, 
Vladimir Shumeyko, the speaker of parliament's upper chamber, 
stated somewhat unexpectedly for the uninitiated, that the 
Federation Council will not approve the law on the draft budget 
in its current form. 
  [Gerasimov] The Russian military, deeply offended by the 
amount allocated to them by the state budget last week, 
conducted a mass attack on legislators on the eve of the 
adoption of the budget by the State Duma. The State Duma 
Defense Committee, concerned by the results of the 
underfinancing of the Army, came out with a decision on 
increasing the military share from 37 to 55 trillion rubles. 
The last time that financing of troops took up 30 percent of 
the state budget was in the USSR in 1940 before the Second World 
War. 
  However, this circumstance in no way reflects the real 
situation. Today, 60 percent of defense expenditure is on social 
provisions. The withdrawal of troops from the distant and near 
abroad, unprecedented in history, and support for the 
infrastructure of military bases eat up a significant part of 
the budget. 
  According to Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin, the 
Army is up to its ears in expenditure. For several years 
exercises have not been above regimental level and the number of 
inspection trips has fallen sharply, as has the receipt of new 
equipment. Andrey Kokoshin claims that 55 trillion does not 
mean a luxury life for the military, but money to stop the 
collapse of the Army. [Video shows Kokoshin addressing news 
conference] 
  [Begin Kokoshin recording] It is absolutely not question of 
our are preparing for a major war, although you always have to 
be vigilant in this regard, and to a certain degree, defense 
capability is one of the main factors in preventing war. But 
the fact is that we need a minimum level to provide for the 
viability of the Armed Forces and preserve the unique defense 
producers, and preserve the opportunities for the Armed Forces, 
when the country is richer, when the country gets to its feet, 
to get hold of first class military equipment. [end recording] 
  [Gerasimov] In the meantime, the Federation Council has 
seriously worked on support for the military budget. Its 
speaker, Vladimir Shumeyko, last week visited the Ivanovo 
strategic missile forces division. In his opinion, the Army 
today is the only stable institution of Russian statehood and it 
is dangerous for the state to save money on it. Vladimir 
Shumeyko said That the upper chamber of the Federal Assembly 
will only approve a budget that will be capable of strengthening 
the Armed Forces. 
  [Begin Shumeyko recording] What does 55 mean? Is it enough 
or not? I am not prepared to go into these figures with you 
today. I am far from simply relying on figures. Until we sit 
down and check each article on each branch of the Armed Forces 
calmly, maybe it will not be 30 or 55. Because I have spoken 
with Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin and know how difficult it 
is for the government today, how difficult it is to make 
allocations to the military in these conditions where there is a 
lack of revenue in the budget, especially when the 
agro-industrial complex is making demands, and so on. It will 
be necessary to defend every kopeck. Maybe it will be 57 or 48. 
[end recording] 
  [Gerasimov] At the same time, according to a statement by 
General Vorobyev, the chief military financier, the money 
allocated by the Defense Ministry is barely enough to pay off 
the debts for supplies of equipment and weapons. The military 
budget approved by the State Duma in its first reading may 
deprive Russia of its strategic nuclear forces, the basis of 
ensuring national security. A new system created on the basis of 
solely Russian enterprises and constructors bureaus must replace 
the missile complex reaching the end of its guaranteed life. If 
this program is disrupted, then by the year 2000 Russia will 
have only 90 strategic missile launchers, which will lead to the 
complete destruction of nuclear parity with the United States. 
  Igor Sergeyev, the commander in chief of the Strategic 
Missile Forces, thinks that at current levels of finance the 
introduction of new missiles will be postponed indefinitely and 
his department will not be in a condition to carry out its 
present volume of tasks. 
  [Begin Sergeyev recording] We have to start their 
introduction in 1995 to replace the 300 launchers that we have 
destroyed up to the present time, in accordance with the quota 
where the Americans chose 3,500 and we chose 3,000. We believe 
that this will be sufficient, but they needed to be assembled, 
they will not just appear. As of today, if you take 100 percent 
of the finance planned for this area, at the present time we are 
financed only for four percent. [end recording] 
  [Gerasimov] The combination of arguments produced by the 
military to justify the necessity of increasing their share of 
the budget will most likely convince the legislators, moreover, 
since the State Duma is the only state body that has not yet 
expressed a positive attitude toward additional finance for the 
Army. The president and the Cabinet of Ministers have already 
supported an increase in the budget to 55 trillion rubles. The 
military's main ace is that political sympathy in an as yet 
unstable society remains on their side.

    [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First 
Channel Network in Russian at 0600 GMT on 22 May 1994 broadcasts 
the 30- minute "Test Range" program entitled "How To Stay 
Afloat," which reports on the apparently successful efforts of 
St. Petersburg's Zvezda Association, which produces ship 
engines, to survive in the absence of orders from the Russian 
Navy. This it achieved by laying off half its work force and 
soliciting orders abroad. The program includes extensive video 
of the factory's workspace, as well as footage of a 5000 hp 
engine, described as unique by the factory's chief designer, and 
a high-speed coastal patrol vessel named `Zubr' being built 
along with the Almaz Works. 
  While the focus was on Zvezda, the theme of the program was 
the decline of the Russian Navy and the advances of its' U.S. 
rival. 
  The voiceover introduced the program thus: "At the start of 
the last decade our country had the reputation of being a great 
naval power and possessed -- after the United States -- the 
second most powerful navy. People were afraid of us and 
therefore respected us. Now they are not afraid and have no 
respect. Otherwise, our submarines would not run into American 
submarines off our northern shores, Japanese fishermen would not 
catch fish in our territorial waters, and the Chinese would not 
set a new demarcation line at their discretion on the Amur 
border river." 
  During the program, the following snippets of information on 
the dire state of the Russian Navy entitled "for your 
consideration" were displayed on-screen at intervals: 
  "The Russian Navy's share of the military budget is 50 
percent less than that of the French Navy, a factor of 2.5 less 
than that of the British Navy, and a factor of four less than 
that of the U.S. Navy." 
  "In the opinion of specialists, the level of the fall in 
ship-building production during the implementation of conversion 
programs should not exceed eight to 10 percent a year. 
Production in Russia has fallen by more than 40 percent. This 
threatens the fleet with losses." 
  "Russia's shipyards have not begun building any new surface 
vessels in two years. Submarines are being scrapped that have 
done 15 years' service instead of the requisite 25. The number 
of submarines has been halved over the last six years. The 
Mediterranean and Indian Ocean squadrons have ceased to exist." 
  "In the opinion of U.S. specialists, the military capacity 
of 
the Navy will double by the year 2000 in comparison with 1993 as 
a result of ship perfection. In Russia, out of the 548 ships 
that made up the military structure of the Navy in 1992, there 
will remain 300 obsolete ships by the year 2000."

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Sychev report: "Moscow Introduced Arms Trade </F>
Monopoly in November, and Revoked It in May"] 
  [Text] The Russian Government has authorized industrial 
enterprises in the military-industrial complex and weapons 
manufacturers to export their own military equipment and 
supplies, and to sign contracts with foreign partners and 
cooperate with them. 
  This decree was adopted right in the wake of the president's 
decree dated 18 November of last year, which established a state 
monopoly in Russia on military-technical cooperation; the state 
company "Rosvooruzheniye," formed several months ago, was 
entrusted with its implementation. 
  The reestablishment of a monopoly was attributed to the fact 
that the liberalization of the arms trade which had been 
conducted over several years had led to substantial currency 
losses because of the commercial incompetence of enterprises, 
competition between establishments which had the right to enter 
foreign markets, and the emergence of a large number of 
parasitical intermediary firms. By and large, whereas in 1987 
the USSR sold approximately $22 billion worth of arms, in 1993 
Russia was only able to earn around 2 billion. 
  Does the government decree repeal the presidential edict? 
The president's press service advised IZVESTIYA to think for 
itself. The Interdepartmental Commission for Military-Technical 
Cooperation Between the Russian State and Foreign Counties 
believes that there are no contradictions between the two 
documents. The draft decree was prepared over a period of 18 
months, Nikolay Bogdanov, senior secretary of the commission, 
said. It was reexamined after about 20 general designers and 
directors of military-industrial complex enterprises sent the 
president an appeal demanding that the manufacturer be given 
back the right to sell his own output independently on foreign 
markets. The president instructed the commission to sort the 
matter out. 
  The investigation resulted in a decision being adopted by 
the 
commission -- in whose work representatives of all institutions 
and firms interested in military-technical cooperation are 
participating -- to submit the draft decree for ratification by 
the government. 
  Only the manufacturers will be able to trade in arms. 
Private trading companies and middlemen have been excluded from 
the lists of possible contenders, Nikolay Bogdanov said. 
Furthermore, every enterprise will have to undergo strict 
attestation and obtain a license. A decision will be adopted by 
members of the commission on the principle of consensus. The 
"Rosvooruzheniye" State Company fully retains the functions of 
price control. 
  According to Marshal of Aviation Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov, the 
president's representative in the "Rosvooruzheniye" State 
Company, who has been entrusted with the functions of monitoring 
the observance of legality in the arms trade, it will be 
impossible to avoid the expansion of the number of participants 
in military-technical cooperation. Both manufacturers who offer 
the commodity and consumers exist throughout the world. 
Relations between them are regulated by tough laws and are put 
into practice under state supervision. The complexity of 
Russia's position is that it does not have a law on arms trade. 
  Marshal Shaposhnikov believes that the government decree 
will 
be implemented gradually, which will make it possible to adopt a 
law, a draft of which has already been prepared. Every 
application for a license by an enterprise will be studied 
carefully.

<F P=106> [Leonid Zavarskiy report: "`Rosvooruzheniye' Company Press </F>
Conference. A Small-Caliber Show to be Held In Vladimir"] 
  [Text] The "Rosvooruzheniye" state arms company held a 
news conference in Vladimir yesterday devoted to a firearms and 
small-caliber artillery weaponry show from 24 to 28 May. While 
rather representative delegations of potential foreign buyers 
are expected to be on hand at the show, "Rosvooruzheniye" 
representatives seem to be worried by other problems. 
  Russia has two fairs selling its arms -- in Nizhniy Novgorod 
(heavy combat equipment) and in Vladimir (small arms). As was 
announced at the news conference, the May exhibition in Vladimir 
will showcase many of the latest models of small and special 
arms including models not yet mass-produced. They are mainly 
portable submachine guns (in particular the "Vikhr" and the 
9A-93 model) superior to the Israel's Usi, as well as individual 
weapons of an "enhanced stopping power" -- the "Gyurza" pistol, 
and the "Udar" 12.7mm revolver. Right there at the show (it 
will cost 170 million rubles) one would be able to buy sporting 
guns made in Tula and Izhevsk plants. 
  The troubles involved in arranging the show are much less 
than the anxiety clearly plaguing the "Rosvooruzheniye" company. 
The point is that the government decree of 8 May 1994 grants 
weapons manufacturers the right to independent external economic 
activity. According to Colonel Aleksandr Semenov, deputy chief 
of the "Rosvooruzheniye's" regional policy administration, the 
decree does not rule out cooperation between the company and the 
manufacturers as regards marketing, looking for customers, and 
pricing. However, Mr. Semenov said, the "Rosvooruzheniye" is 
yet to make sense of the decree whose issue came for the company 
as somewhat a surprise. "Rosvooruzheniye" representatives were 
more specific talking in the press conference lobby -- they 
thought the government decree clashes with the president's edict 
under which the company was set up. According to one guess, the 
decree was just a "tranquilizer" given to the arms manufacturers 
many of whom "reacted rather nervously to the setting up of a 
state monopolist in the shape of the "Rosvooruzheniye."

<F P=106> [V. Voropayev report over video; from the "Dalniy Vostok" </F>
program] 
  [Text] Representatives of the Pacific Fleet consider the 
concern of domestic and foreign nature conservationists about 
the problem of liquid radioactive waste in the Maritime Kray 
unfounded. Valeriy Danilyan, chief of the fleet service of 
radioactive and chemical defense, related at a meeting with 
Greenpeace movement activists that the radioactivity of this 
waste was so low -- 0.07 to 0.08 curie -- that it could be 
compared to the background radiation of the Sea of Japan, and 
did not endanger it in any way. Furthermore, the economic 
expenses of constructing an unnecessary, in principle, complex 
for processing the waste promise to be very substantial. 
However, international experts do not share such a complacent 
attitude, and believe that both Russia and Japan, which 
volunteered to help it, procrastinate in an unforgivable manner 
in solving the problem of utilization of nuclear waste in the 
Maritime Kray.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Veronika Romanenkova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 20 TASS -- "The now existing 
inter-governmental agreements on the processing of radioactive 
wastes on Russian territory may be revised. In any case, the 
Inter-departmental Commission for Ecological Safety of the 
Russian Security Council has moved to include without fail an 
article in those documents, laying down that the processed 
wastes should be returned to the countries from where they had 
arrived," Chairman of the Commission Aleksey Yablokov stated 
here today. 
  There are several legislative acts in Russia today, 
regulating the processing of foreign radioactive wastes on its 
territory. For instance, the law on the protection of the 
environment prohibits the import and storage of such wastes on 
Russian territory. However, Russia's inter-governmental 
agreements with Finland, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and the 
former German Democratic Republic stipulate that wastes from 
nuclear power plants, built in those countries with the 
participation of the USSR, should be processed in Russia. No 
such document was signed with Hungary. Yablokov said that 
Russia could, in principle, continue the job of processing 
radioactive wastes, but only at the request of foreign states, 
on a commercial basis, and with their obligatory "repatriation". 
  There is a special plant at Chelyabinsk-45, but it is able 
to 
process wastes only from nuclear-propelled submarines and 
VVER-type reactors. The construction of the Krasnoyarsk-26 
plant, designed to process wastes from RBMK (Chernobyl-type) 
reactors, has still not been completed. More than two trillion 
roubles are needed to finish the project. Yablokov said that 
the Russian Ministry for Atomic Energy was planning to meet a 
part of this sum by concluding an agreement with Hungary. 
However, the money that it will get from this is obviously not 
enough, the specialist said. 
  Yablokov also believes that "it is high time to revise the 
closed nuclear cycle concept", used until now. According to 
this system, enriched uranium and plutonium from nuclear power 
plants were used to make nuclear warheads. But since they are 
no longer needed, radioactive materials could "simply be kept 
for several tens of years" in special storages. They would lose 
much of their radioactivity by the end of that period and could 
be safely buried.

  [Text] While there are currently more than 50 nuclear 
research plants in operation on the territory of Moscow, none of 
the working nuclear reactors have safety devices such as 
protective hoods, for example, measuring up to safety standards. 
Nevertheless, only three reactors have been shut down since 1992 
on the site of the Kurchatov Research Center, and they could be 
back in use again shortly. This has been advised by Vladimir 
Kuznetsov, chief of the Moscow inspectorate of the State

  [Text] Flight Control Center, 23 May (ITAR-TASS) -- The 
flight of the unmanned transport craft "Progress M-22" has been 
completed. The separation of the space cargo craft from the 
"Mir" complex was effected at 0457 Moscow time today. After 
orientation in space and braking, with the aid of the craft's 
engine installation, the "Progress M-22" craft went into a 
descent trajectory, entered the dense layers of the Earth's 
atmosphere, and ended its existence. 
  For Viktor Afanasyev, Yuriy Usachev, and Valeriy Polyakov, a 
routine cycle of geophysical research is planned for today. The 
cosmonauts are to carry out surveys of the Earth's land masses 
and oceans and carry out a number of experiments to obtain 
information about the state of the Earth's ozone layer. 
  In order to determine the dynamic characteristics of the 
"Mir" complex, comprising a complicated space system, the 
"Rezonans" experiment will be carried out.

  [Text] Yerevan ("GOLOS ARMENII" - Past), 05/21/94--The 
Azeri Defense Minister Mamadrafi Mamedov made a declaration on 
May 18, which particularly says: 
  "Mass media have been spreading rumors about the 
negotiations 
between the Armenian and Azeri Defense Ministers in Moscow. The 
Azeri Defense Ministry press service declares in this regard 
that a cease fire has been established as a result of 
negotiations allowing the sides to calmly work on the final 
document. As long as no agreement was reached on several 
points, this document wasn't signed. A group of experts is 
currently working on it, and when they are finished, a new 
meeting between the Russian, Azeri and Armenian Defense 
Ministers will be organized. 
  A relative calmness established at the several sections of 
the front during the last few days. Nevertheless, several our 
positions have been shelled. The village of Sadarak in 
Nakhichevan was shelled during the night of May 18. In all 
cases the Azeri side didn't return the fire." 
  Mamedov arrived to Moscow again on May 19, and met Russian 
Deputy Defense Minister Georgiy Kondrayev. No details about the 
meeting are available.

  [Text] The opposing sides in the Nagorno-Karabakh front 
line have refrained from launching intensive combat operations. 
However, the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] Defense Army Press 
Service has disclosed that over the past few days Azerbaijan has 
violated the relatively peaceful situation. That republic's 
military forces have been firing on the NKR defense positions. 
For example, this morning Azerbaijani units fired on the NKR 
positions in the northeastern part of the confrontation lines 
with mortars. The Armenian side remains committed to the 
cease-fire agreement and has held back from returning the fire. 
  Meanwhile, the Armenian Ministry of Defense Press Service 
has 
disclosed that the relatively peaceful situation in the 
northeastern part of Armenia was disrupted again yesterday. The 
defense positions around Vagashen in Idzhevanskiy Rayon were 
fired on with infantry combat vehicles at 1405. No one was hurt. 
  The same source also noted that no other incidents occurred 
on Armenia's border last night and this morning.

  [Text] Yerevan ("LRAGIR", "AZG" dailies), 05/21/94 -- 
Commenting on the results of negotiations in Moscow, Acting 
Chairman of the RMK [Republic of Mountainous Karabakh] Supreme 
Council Karen Baburyan said that "Azerbaijan is trying to fail 
(the implementation) of Russian and other projects, clearly 
understanding that stationing of disengagement troops in the 
conflict zone would be a serious obstacle for restarting 
military operations against Mountainous Karabakh. Nevertheless, 
all conditions necessary for stopping the war are present today, 
and peace completely depends on the will of the Azeri 
Government. Karabakh will do its best to reach stability in the 
region." 
  The RMK military observers believe Baku is trying to build 
an 
image that Russia is unable to create peace in Transcaucasia. 
Therefore, the declaration of Russian Deputy Defense Minister 
Georgiy Kondratyev about Russia having to stop the mediation 
efforts, if Azerbaijan doesn't sign the agreement, is quite 
understandable.

measures were discussed yesterday at the meeting of Armenian and 
Nakhichevan delegations. 
  As SNARK was told today in the Armenian Defense Ministry, 
Azerbaijan side has acknowledged that tension at the border is 
sometimes caused by Nakhichevan combat units which thus try to 
justify their unwillingness to fight in Karabakh. Nakhichevan 
representatives also consider possible the provocations by 
Peoples Front of Azerbaijan attempting to destabilize the 
situation in Nakhichevan Republic. 
  Negotiating parties agreed to undertake adequate measures to 
prevent the possible border incidents. 
  There were no serious incidents along the entire Armenian 
border during the last day, informed the Defense Department.

  [Text] Stepanakert, 21 May -- Robert Kocharyan, chairman 
of the State Committee for the Defence of Nagorno Karabakh, has 
said that the Nagorno Karabakh republic and the Crimean republic 
intend to "be persistent in implementing the accords reached". 
He told a news conference today about the results of the visit 
to the Crimean Peninsula by an official Nagorno Karabakh 
delegation. 
  A communique on the results of the meeting has been signed 
between the Nagorno Karabakh republic and the Crimean republic, 
as well as an agreement on trade and economic and cultural 
cooperation. 
  It is envisaged that there will be an exchange of 
representative offices and that privileges will be granted on 
transit freight and other things. On the political level, the 
sides came to agreement on coordinating actions, and also on 
possible joint steps in respect of a political settlement of the 
problems facing the two republics. Crimea's President Yuriy 
Meshkov may make a visit to Nagorno Karabakh in return. 
  Evaluating the current situation in Crimea, Robert Kocharyan 
commented that this was an attempt by the Ukrainian leadership 
to oppose any deepening of Crimean sovereignty. Karabakh has 
already passed this stage, and in Robert Kocharyan's view, this 
will have a consequence for Crimea and will only strengthen its 
sovereignty.

were concentrated in the Gali region. The number is constantly 
increasing. There is also a high concentration of military 
technology. The center reported it had evidence to show that in 
the night of May 20-21 Abkhazia was planning wide scale 
operations to put an end to the peace talks and provoke a new 
escalation of the conflict. 
  The Georgian Defense Ministry calls on the leaders of Abkhaz 
armed formations to withhold from any military actions which 
could lead to renewed bloodshed.

  [Text] Moscow May 21 TASS -- The situation in the Galskiy 
District where, according to the Georgian Defence Ministry, 
concentration of Abkhazian troops was registered on Friday, has 
not changed, Georgian Defence Minister Vardiko Nadibaidze said 
in an exclusive telephone interview with ITAR-TASS on Saturday. 
  According to the minister, the situation "is closely 
monitored", and no additional massing of troops and combat 
materiel was registered. 
  As the Georgian Defence Minstry reported earlier, the 
concentration of armed groups numbering over 500 and an increase

  However, apprehensions about "a planned large-scale 
operation" have not been confirmed so far.

  [Text] An officer from the Georgian Defense Ministry press 
center said in an interview with Interfax that the reports on 
the armed clashes between the Georgian and Abkhazian formations 
in the Inguri River on May 19 evening given by the Abkhazian 
military departments was "more misinformation." 
  The Georgian Defense Ministry press center affirmed that 
yesterday there had been no military action on the line of 
confrontation between the Georgian and Abkhazian troops. The 
same source suggested that the misinformation was aimed at 
torpedoing the peace settlement and hampering the return of 
Georgian refugees to Abkhazia. 
  The Abkhazian Defense Ministry announced this morning that 
two Georgian formations had tried to break through the Abkhazian 
troops near the Inguri River Hydro Electric Power Station. The 
Georgian formations had met resistance and had been forced to 
retreat. One Abkhazian soldier was killed and two wounded. 
  As a result all Abkhazian armed forces were put on alert. 
  The Abkhazian government stated that there had been more 
provocations on the part of Georgia. A total of seven Abkhazian 
servicemen had been killed by Georgian sabotage militants in May 
alone. 
  The Abkhazian government stressed that such actions were 
violating the Moscow agreements and laying the peace settlement 
open to violations.

  [Text] Tbilisi, 22 May -- Georgia's Defense Minister 
Lieutenant General Vardiko Nadibaidze issued instructions today 
on the introduction of military patrols in places where all six 
of the republic's military garrisons are deployed -- Tbilisi, 
Kutaisi, Rustavi, Akhaltsikhe, Telavi, and Gori. 
  This measure, adopted by the recent deputy commander of the 
Group of Russian Forces in the Caucasus, is aimed at preventing 
crimes by the rank and file and officer corps of the Georgian 
Army. 
  The situation as far as violations of the law is concerned 
is 
complicated by the fact that there are no legislative acts in 
Georgia regulating the ownership of short-barrelled weapons. 
Thus, citizens have free access to pistols and revolvers.

  [Excerpts] Here is what Eduard Shevardnadze said at the 
meeting in the parliament hall dedicated to the festivities to 
be held on Georgia's Independence Day. 
  [Begin Shevardnadze recording]] This will be a demonstration 
of what our troops are, what guarantees we have to defend our 
statehood if needed. [passage omitted] 
  I would like to ask the organizers of the festivities to pay 
specil heed to refugees in Tbilisi as well in other places. 
Unfortunately, we are not rich but a kind word and basic 
concern can be spared in order that the refugees can feel that 
this is their celebration and their festival and that the 
Georgian state is concerned with their interest and is ready to 
protect each of its citizen and every family. [passage 
indistinct] We have taken an immense commitment. I request 
everyone to get to work. If our intentions do not come true and 
we fail to justify all hopes and redeem a promise given to our 
people and refugees in the first instance, a day will come when 
we will have to answer to these people for everything. That is 
why posing any obstacles is inadmissible today. The authorities 
must be given an opportunity to bring their endeavor to an end. 
The aim of all of us, including parties and political forces 
who are raging a battle against the authorities, is to secure a 
positive completion of the cause. Their target is the same. I 
do not believe that they are fighting to overthrow the 
government. They are fighting for a safe return of refugees, 
for getting guarantees of security. They doubt that ours is the 
right way. But only time can show whether the way is right or 
wrong. Therefore, while discussing this issue today, I have 
regarded it necessary to say a few words about this. 
  I request all political parties, their leaders, members of 
parliament and leaders of public organizations to participate in 
these festive arrangements actively. [passage omitted] 
  Lack of hope can drive the country to destruction. Our whole 
history has been a struggle for freedom, for independence, for 
hope. The hope saved Georgia. I appeal to all political parties 
to establish this hope on 26 May and let us all try to 
demonstrate unity and integrity for the sake of the country.

<F P=106> [Mirian Lebanidze article: "The Liberal-Democrats Have </F>
Joined the Opposition"] 
  [Text] A year and a half has passed since the second 
national elections in Georgia. The fall of Gagra [in Abkhazia] 
was the first serious blow to Eduard Shevardnadze's prestige. 
Since then, the head of state's popularity has been on the 
decline. He has bequeathed the return of Abkhazia and the 
restoration of [Georgia's] statehood to "grateful generations" 
and united a fragmented Georgia to the CIS. 
  Joining the CIS has thinned out the parliamentary majority. 
On 5 May, the Liberal-Democratic National Party [LDNP] declared 
itself as [part of] the opposition. Party leader Batoni Mikheil 
Naneishvili delivered a report to Parliament in which he exposed 
the incorrectness of the political course chosen by Shevardnadze. 
  Joining the CIS became the main reason for the Liberals' 
dissatisfaction. Their first protest followed the statement 
made by Speaker of Parliament Goguadze [on the necessity of 
Georgia joining the CIS]. "We felt that this idea was not 
implanted in him by the Holy Ghost," stated Batoni Naneishvili 
(in a speech delivered in Parliament, he assessed such an action 
by a deputy as a "minor prank"). 
  The Liberal-Democrats had earlier been united with the 
Greens 
Party in an alliance of "liberals" and were viewed as supporters 
of the head of state, although, as Naneishvili said, they had 
often criticized Shevardnadze in private. Following the events 
connected with joining the CIS, their party was completely 
ignored. In spite of Naneishvili's statements, no one paid any 
attention to them. They, however, continued to wait and are 
still waiting for the government to see the results of the 
mistakes that have been made. 
  The LDNP previously kept in the background. On 5 May, they 
decided to emerge from the shadows. 
  In Naneishvili's statement of 5 May it is stated that the 
personnel policy chosen by the head of state is unable to 
satisfy the demands of the state. The Cabinet of Ministers 
approved by him is unable to conduct reforms. It is made up of 
old appointees who are used to "doing nothing." Shevardnadze 
and his government are demanding the restoration and expansion 
of "old ties," which the LDNP views as absurd: They are 
creating an association of enslaving ties characteristic of the 
Soviet period. Naneishvili called the policy being conducted by 
the head of state and his supporters as "reactionary." 
  Following such a non-liberal statement, the LDNP is 
demanding, first and foremost, that Georgia leaves the CIS. 
They believe that it is necessary to follow a completely 
different political course, one that will be totally dissociated 
from the CIS. It is Mikheil Naneishvili's belief that it will 
be possible for Georgia to free itself completely from Russia's 
influence if the government shows itself to be resolute and if 
it orients itself toward the West. 
  The LDNP has distanced itself from those supporting the 
government but it has also been unable to side with the 
opposition. According to Naneishvili, they have found themselves 
between the devil and the deep blue sea: They criticize 
Shevardnadze but do not demand his resignation. They are hoping 
to see something undone that cannot be undone. The Liberals 
remain liberals.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tengiz Pachkoriya] </F>
  [Text] Tbilisi May 20 TASS -- More than 62 per cent of 
Georgian residents surveyed recently by the newspaper SVOBODNAYA 
GRUZIA (FREE GEORGIA) answered negatively when asked if they 
considered the Russian-dominated CIS peace-keeping troops a 
reliable guarantee of the safe return of refugees to Abkhazia. 
  The newspaper's survey, published on Friday, had the goal of 
determining Georgian society's opinion of the four-sided 
agreement on a ceasefire and withdrawal of forces, which was 
signed in Moscow on May 14. Twenty per cent of the inhabitants 
of Tbilisi and Georgia answered positively to the above 
question, while about 15 per cent did not express an opinion.

  [Text] Russia and Georgia have concentrated on settling 
border and customs problems. Chairman of Georgia's Border 
Department Viktor Lordkipanidze told Interfax that a special 
Georgian commission was set up to demarcate the border between 
Russia and Georgia. 
  He also announced that the economic border with customs 
offices was to be defined next week. The Georgian customs 
office will be located in Gantiadi and the Russian one in Adler. 
The motorway customs offices will be located in Gantiadi, Roki, 
Mamisoni and Kazbegi (Georgia) and in Adler, Nizhni Zaramag and 
Verkhny Lars (Russia). 
  Lordkipanidze also said that talks were underway on the 
demarcation of the state border. The final variant will be 
chosen with due account taken of both countries' interests, he 
said. 
  He said that the customs offices would be opened in the near 
future, perhaps earlier than a political decision on the issue 
would be taken.

  [Text] The Azerbaijani leadership seeks peace, Azerbaijani 
President Geydar Aliyev stated at a meeting with refugees from 
the Karabakh Region on Saturday. His address to the refugees 
was televised. 
  Aliyev said that the Azerbaijani leadership had been 
maintaining contacts with the CSCE and the Russian leaders in 
order to ensure permanent ceasefire and to eliminate the 
consequences of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. 
  Aliyev commented on relations with the opposition and on its 
reaction to the Bishkek protocol. "The leadership made the right 
move having signed this protocol. For Baku it meant only 
ceasefire," he emphasized. 
  Aliyev condemned activities of the opposition deputies who 
had recently left the parliament and had organized a rally in 
Baku on Saturday. "Political parties should not act through 
rallies and mass actions of protest. They must consult the 
official bodies and interact with them," he pointed out. 
  Aliyev announced that people had been sending telegrams and 
calling from many Azerbaijani regions asking for an opportunity 
to come to Baku and to settle the accounts with the opposition. 
He said the fear of the opposition that Russian troops could be 
brought to Azerbaijan was in vain. "No Russian troops will be 
brought to Azerbaijan," Aliyev reassured. 
  Press Secretary of the National Independence opposition 
party 
(led by Etibar Mamedov) Rauf Mirgadyrov suggested in an 
interview with Interfax that after his statement Aliyev would 
have practically no chance to achieve any accord with the 
opposition.

  [Text] Russian Federation troops will not be brought into 
Azerbaijan, President Geydar Aliyev of Azerbaijan has declared. 
He denied opposition accusations that the country might lose 
its sovereignty. According to Aliyev, political parties should 
consult and interact with the official bodies instead of holding 
rallies and mass protest actions. The Azerbaijani leader 
reiterated that the authorities acted correctly in signing the 
Bishkek protocol on a cease-fire. 
  Meanwhile, the situation in the conflict zone remains 
relatively calm. The Azerbaijani Defense Ministry reports only 
rare cases of shelling of its territory from Armenia. 
  The headquarters of the Azerbaijani National Independence 
Party has been raided. The premises were blockaded by 200 
policemen, who announced they intended to find weapons. 
However, the press service of the republican Interior Ministry 
refuses to comment on this report, saying it knows nothing about 
the incident.

  [Text] Twenty-two Azeri opposition parties formed a 
national resistance movement on May 19 in Baku. 
  Their leaders met at the headquarters of the National 
Independence party. They said the movement was formed to 
counter "all attempts to introduce a Russian or Commonwealth 
army contingent in Azerbaijan." 
  The movement is to work to protect democracy and 
Azerbaijan's 
sovereignty and insure the return of the Armenian-occupied Azeri 
territories, the restoration of the republic's territorial 
integrity and the inviolability of the national frontiers. 
  According to preliminary reports, the national resistance 
movement is planning to hold a rally on May 21 to protest the 
possible introduction of Russian or Commonwealth peacekeepers in 
Azerbaijan. 
  A peacekeeping contingent can be introduced in Azerbaijan 
under a protocol that was discussed, under Russian mediation, by 
the Armenian and Azeri Defense Ministers and the commander of 
the Karabakh defense forces earlier this week. The Azeri 
minister refused to sign the protocol. The Azeri leaders link 
its signing to the conclusion of a comprehensive political 
agreement on Nagorni Karabakh. In their view, the captured 
territories must be returned to Azerbaijan, the refugees must be 
repatriated and moves must be made to revive the Karabakh 
economy.

  [Text] During the National Assembly meeting under President 
Geydar Aliyev yesterday, a group of deputies called for a debate 
on the Bishkek protocol and proposed that it be included on the 
meeting's agenda. It will be recalled that the media gave 
significant coverage to the protocol for many days. 
  The speaker of the parliament outlined his position by 
saying 
that a debate on the protocol is unnecessary, that a lengthy 
debate had already been held. The debate of the protocol was 
not included on the agenda, and seventeen deputies walked out of 
the meeting. Commenting on the matter, Deputy Kamuran Rakhimov 
said the following: 
  [Begin Rakhimov recording] Creating a confrontation when our 
country and people are faced with complex problems is 
meaningless. The Bishkek protocol and the effects it will have 
on Azerbaijan's future were discussed at the meeting. It was 
noted that the protocol's main objective is to end the fighting. 
That is in the interest of all the people in Azerbaijan. How 
long should we prolong the war? How long should we witness the 
death of our young men and attend the funerals of the martyrs? 
So, the main objective should be to end the war and establish 
peace. In fact, that is the Bishkek protocol's main objective. 
  The walk-out by a group of deputies from the National 
Assembly cannot be justified in any way. I am convinced that 
they will realize that state of affairs. [end recording]

  [Text] A senior source in the Ukrainian president's staff 
has criticized Russian President Boris Yeltsin's comments on a 
telephone conversation he had on Friday with his Ukrainian 
counterpart, Leonid Kravchuk. 
  The comments, made in a television interview, "do not 
reflect 
the real content of the conversation," the source told 
INTERFAX-Ukraine. 
  He said Yeltsin's words that "the main thing is that neither 
Ukraine nor Russia should interfere in Crimean affairs" were 
"surprising." They suggested that Russia, in its relationship 
with Crimea, would like to have the same status as Ukraine, of 
which Crimea is part. 
  As for Yeltsin's statement that Ukraine must not use force 
against Crimea, the source said, "Ukraine is an independent 
state, and the methods it uses to solve its internal problems 
depend solely on the will of its people and parliament. 
Undoubtedly those methods would meet the Constitution and laws 
of Ukraine. Ukraine has observed and does observe international 
legal standards." 
  "What was also surprising was the rhetoric of the Russian 
president, who was speaking about the Ukrainian president in a 
disrespectful and admonishing manner," the source continued. 
  "The statement of the president of the Russian Federation 
would be much more constructive if he appealed to the 
separatists in the Republic of Crimea not to put in jeopardy 
peace in the region," the source summed up.

  [Text] Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko said he 
and his Russian counterpart Andrey Kozyrev realized that the 
actions of the leadership of the Ukrainian autonomous republic 
of Crimea did not meet the interests of either Russia or Ukraine. 
  "We have agreed to hold joint consultations in case of any 
unforeseen developments," Zlenko told reporters on Saturday [21 
May] commenting on a telephone conversation he had had with 
Kozyrev the same day. 
  Zlenko said the conversation had made it clear that "Russia 
will refrain from any interference in the current situation in 
Crimea." He expressed the hope that Ukraine and Russia "will 
manage to set in motion a negotiation mechanism that would help 
find a solution to the problem." Ukraine will not use force in 
Crimea "unless the other side provokes it," he said. 
  Some sources told INTERFAX-Ukraine that, following the last 
telephone conversation between the Ukrainian and Russian 
presidents, a Ukrainian government delegation, led by acting 
Prime Minister Yefim Zvyagilskiy, was leaving for Moscow on 
Monday to discuss the division of the disputed Black Sea Fleet, 
a friendship and cooperation treaty between the two countries 
and the Crimean problem. 
  On Friday, Zlenko said in a letter to Kozyrev that the 
Crimean legislature's decision to restore the Crimean 
Constitution approved on 6 May 1992, jeopardized political 
stability in Ukraine and might cause tension between Ukraine and 
Russia. He said that, in case of further trouble in Crimea, 
Ukraine might take all measures allowed by its constitution and 
legislation to preserve its territorial integrity. 
  Kozyrev, in a reply to Zlenko, said the possibility of 
Russian-Ukrainian tension over Crimea was bound to cause 
concern. But it is important "to respect the sovereign will of 
peoples, show restraint and rule out the use of force. All 
problems arising between Ukraine and the sovereign Republic of 
Crimea -- forming part of Ukraine -- must be settled solely by 
political means," the Russian minister said. 
  "The situation in Crimea once again proves the need to solve 
the problems of the Black Sea Fleet as soon as possible, on the 
basis of the agreements between the presidents of the two 
countries. Russia is ready for this," Kozyrev said

  [Excerpts] The largest Black Sea Fleet exercises for some 
time have ended in the Crimea. Approximately 30 ships, coastal 
units, and aviation took part. Subunits and ships are now in 
their usual places of deployment and there are no troop 
movements. The maneuvers demonstrated the fleet's high degree 
of combat readiness. [passage omitted] 
  On the whole the situation remains calm throughout the 
peninsula, but according to the latest figures there are now 
approximately 50,000 Ukrainian soldiers in Crimea, and their 
number continues to increase. Mainly they are special purpose 
units.

  [Text] The Ukrainian Defence Ministry issued a statement 
Friday [20 May] night saying that "a group of unidentified 
gunmen had tried to seize a strategic facility of the Ukrainian 
Anti-Aircraft Defence Force in Sevastopol." 
  It notes that "properly organized defence of the facility 
and 
resolute actions by Ukrainian servicemen became obstacles to 
criminals." 
  A well-informed source in the Ukrainian Defence Ministry has 
reported to Interfax that ten gunmen attempted to capture the 
Ukrainian Anti-aircraft Defence Command Post in Sevastopol on 19 
May. The Ukrainian guards on duty at the facility frustrated 
their attempt. 
  The statement stresses that the Crimean parliament's 
decision 
on army service for Crimeans exclusively in the peninsula "makes 
the Ukrainian side weary." "Not only does the document is at 
variance with Ukraine's constitution and defence potential 
requirements but it builds up tension in society and in the 
Army," the statement says. 
  It underlines that the "Ukrainian Army units deployed in the 
Crimea are subordinate to Ukraine's Defence Ministry and carry 
out orders from the Ukrainian Supreme Army Commander in the 
interests of ensuring the territorial integrity of our state, 
its defence potential and inviolable frontiers." 
  Speaking in parliament in Simferopol Saturday morning, the 
Crimean Security Service Chairman Vladimir Lepekhov denied that 
the Ukrainian anti-aircraft command post had come under attack 
Tuesday night. 
  Meanwhile, as Interfax has found out from a source close to 
Crimean parliament, Ukrainian guards and special troops are 
being massed in the peninsula. Some 250 national guards arrived 
in Sevastopol Friday night and have set up a camp on the grounds 
of the Ukrainian naval academy in the city. 
  Up to 400 more Ukrainian guards are expected in Sevastopol 
shortly.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko and </F>
Mikhail Melnik] 
  [Text] Kiev 21 May TASS -- The Ukrainian Navy press 
centre protested on Saturday plans to transfer to Sevastopol "a 
reinforced tank battalion and an anti-aircraft anti-missile 
battalion of the coastal defence formation of the Black Sea 
Fleet in the near future." 
  A statement released by the press centre earlier today said 
that the battalions will be included in the black Sea Fleet 
marine brigade. 
  It also said that part of their officers have already moved 
to Sevastopol for permanent residence. The statement stressed 
that without notification and consultation the Black Sea Fleet 
commanders adopt a decision to bring in strike forces in 
Sevastopol. The press centre voiced concern about the fact that 
the Black Sea Fleet, which is under direct control of the 
presidents of Russia and Ukraine, has made it its practice to 
conduct exercises, move troops and send large numbers of ships 
to sea without notification of the Ukrainian Side. 
  The press centre expressed "strong protest against the 
unilateral actions of the Black Sea Fleet commanders which 
hamper the stabilisation of the situation in Sevastopol and the 
Crimean region, and hinder the development of normal and 
genuinely friendly relations between Ukraine and Russia." 
  The Ukrainian Navy "confirms its readiness to solve the 
existing problems in a civilised way and hopes for the prudence 
of the Black Sea Fleet commanders, as well as all those on whom 
peace and calm on our land depends," the statement said.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "To New Airfields?"] </F>
  [Text] Ukraine expressed its readiness to transfer to 
Russia nationalized strategic bombers -- but for a lot of money. 
The Defense Ministry of the Russian Federation believes that 
our state presently has 42 heavy bombers at its disposal, while 
the Russian Air Force has 77 such machines. The Russian Army 
finds it difficult to deploy new aircraft because the financing 
of their serial production has been halted. As a result, in 
accordance with the plans by the Russian Federation's Ministry 
of Defense, the Air Force will remain without changes until the 
year 2000. "If Ukraine does not agree to our terms, the 
aircraft will remain on its territory," stated a representative 
of the Russian Federation's Ministry of Defense. This was 
reported by the information agency ITAR-TASS.

  [Text] Today, Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk received 
George Soros, a well-known financier, [word indistinct] and U.S. 
public figure. There was a conversation, a significant part of 
which was held in the absence of press representatives. Various 
aspects of further aid to Ukraine on the part of the Soros 
Foundation were discussed during the conversation. 
  Leonid Kravchuk emphasized that in our state they highly 
assess the humanistic activity of this foundation and are 
grateful for the aid that is so necessary today for the 
Ukrainian state. 
  After the conversation George Soros granted an interview to 
journalists in which he, in particular, emphasized that during 
his meeting with the president, apart from stating positive 
factors of cooperation with our state, they also discussed an 
issue on exempting from taxation separate kinds of aid extended 
by the Soros Foundation to Ukraine. This will significantly 
expand the possibilities of its activities in Ukraine.

an appeal calling on the Ukrainian president and Supreme Council 
to take effective measures for the Constitution and laws of 
Ukraine to be implemented in Crimea and the territorial 
integrity of the Ukrainian state to be ensured. Under the 
conditions of Russia's continuing informational, organizational, 
and parliamentary aggression in Crimea, the People's Movement 
deems it necessary to halt the withdrawal of nuclear weapons 
from the territory of Ukraine, the document stresses. 
  Rukh also appeals to the UN Security Council and the

them to prevent Ukraine from being taken to pieces and being 
plunged into a civil war.

    [Editorial Report] Kiev Radio Ukraine World Service in 
Ukrainian at 1925 GMT on 21 May carries a 37-minute live 
interview with Mykola Mykhalchenko, domestic policy adviser to 
Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, by Mykola Marynenko. 
Reception is fair to unmonitorable. 
  Marynenko begins by commenting on the seriousness of the 
situation in the Crimea and on misinformation in the mass media. 
He asks Mykhalchenko to give his opinion on the situation. 
Mykhalchenko replies: 
  Mykhalchenko replies: "I would like to say first that the 
situation in the Crimea right now is, unfortunately, very, very 
dangerous. One of the sides in the Crimea--that is, the 
extremist forces of the Russian community--has in fact reached 
an abyss. Thus, it is now evident that there could be a civil 
war, and the latest events plainly show this." 
  Mykhalchenko says he has been in the Crimea recently and 
noticed that the Crimean Tatars were ready to act very 
resolutely if the policy of separating Crimea from Ukraine and 
joining it to Russia did not stop, fearing another deportation 
of the Crimean Tatars, this time forever. He notes that 
pro-Russian separatist forces in Crimea are being destructive 
while Russia is calling for mutual understanding. 
  Marynenko asks Mykhalchenko about the closed Ukrainian 
parliament session on 20 May. Mykhalchenko replies: "The 
Ukrainian president gave objective information to the deputies 
of the newly elected Supreme Council about the situation in the 
Crimea, showing them our possibilities for keeping the situation 
under control. He said-- this is not word for word but the 
general sense of it--that Ukraine has reached the final stroke, 
that one cannot retreat now, and that the president is prepared 
to act vigorously and firmly, and so on. He proposed a whole set 
of actions for keeping the Crimea as part of Ukraine and for not 
allowing [word indistinct] a civil war there. Unfortunately, I 
repeat unfortunately, our parliament again adopted a half-way 
decision only to suspend all of these documents, which 
facilitate the operation of the documents adopted by Crimea's 
parliament: One should revoke unconditionally and so on." 
  Mykhalchenko adds that a considerable number of the deputies 
in the Ukrainian Supreme Council acted against Ukrainian 
interests and that they said in parliament that events in Crimea 
should be allowed to take their course. He dwells on the fact 
that the Crimean Tatars did not take part in voting on the 
decision in the Crimean Supreme Council, that they do not 
support the separation of the Crimea from Ukraine, and that 
their position is important. 
  Marynenko asks Mykhalchenko what President Kravchuk can do 
if 
the Ukrainian Supreme Council does not agree to his proposals. 
Mykhalchenko replies: "The Supreme Council is the highest 
legislative authority in Ukraine, but Ukraine's president is the 
guarantor of statehood. Ukraine's president is the guarantor of 
the Constitution, whatever kind of constitution it is, and the 
president should defend the current Constitution. I think the 
president will act vigorously and do everything possible to 
preserve Ukraine's statehood, so that territorial issues are 
resolved only in accordance with the Constitution." He adds 
that the people of Ukraine will be the judges of the Ukrainian 
Supreme Council. 
  Marynenko brings up the fact that Russia and Crimea 
concluded 
an agreement without going through Kiev, to which Mykhalchenko 
replies that Ukraine informed the United Nations and other 
international organizations that Crimea does not have the right 
to sign international or political agreements on its own or even 
to hold talks on these issues. He dwells on Russia's history of 
dictatorship and says that Russia trains other states to view 
its policy towards its neighbors as policy not based on 
international law, but on force. 
  Marynenko questions Mykhalchenko about the recent telephone 
conversation betwen Presidents Kravchuk and Yeltsin. 
Mykhalchenko replies: "The point is that in this conversation, 
as far as I know, Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk raised the issue of 
mutual relations between Ukraine and Russia, saying that the 
signing of a broad political treaty between Ukraine and Russia 
should be accelerated as should the dividing up of the Black Sea 
Fleet. The events in the Crimea were undoubtedly touched on. 
Leonid Makarovych posited that the situation really is entering 
a dead end now, that the president of Ukraine cannot expect 
something because there is nothing to expect, and so on, and 
that he will act firmly according to these circumstances. 
Undoubtedly Yeltsin did not agree with this position, but the 
president of Ukraine made no promises that he will not act 
purposefully or vigorously. Leonid Makarovych said that he 
would act within the framework of Ukraine's Constitution, which 
gives the president many possibilities for various courses of 
action. That is, Leonid Makarovych did not promise to be 
passive. He made a promise to act within the bounds of Ukraine's 
Constitution. This is his right." 
  Marynenko mentions that Yeltsin said that the Crimea is a 
sovereign autonomous republic. Mykhalchenko mentions the 
difference in Russia's policy toward Crimea as an autonomous 
republic within Ukraine and its policy toward autonomous 
republics within the Russian Federation, and says that the 
Crimea cannot be both sovereign and autonomous. He says that 
when he was in the United States recently none of the officials 
he spoke to there had any doubt that the Crimea was autonomous 
within Ukraine or that it was essentially a regional authority. 
  Asked about the treaty between Ukraine and Russia, 
Mykhalchenko replies that President Yeltsin said he would not 
sign an agreement until the Black Sea Fleet issue was resolved. 
Mykhalchenko doubts that Russia will resolve the Black Sea Fleet 
issue or that it would agree to the signing of a treaty. He 
says that the Black Sea Fleet is used to intimidate Ukraine. 
According to Mykhalchenko, although Crimean Vice Premier 
Yevgeniy Saburov has Ukrainian citizenship, other members of the 
Crimean Government do not, even though this is against Ukrainian 
law. The interview ends with Mykhalchenko saying that Ukraine 
sometimes reacts belatedly to the actions of Crimea's 
extremists, mentioning the possibility of civil war, and 
stressing that the Crimean Tatars will not allow another 
deportation.

  [Excerpts] Passions have been running high lately in the 
Crimea, but today the situation is somewhat less tense. Very 
probably this is because talks are going to take place tomorrow 
between the government delegations of Russia and Ukraine 
concerning the situation on the peninsula. It will be recalled 
that Kiev's delegation will be led by Yuhym Zvyahilskyy, the 
acting prime minister. What results does Simferopol expect of 
this meeting? Our correspondent is talking to Vyacheslav 
Lebedev, the press secretary of the Crimean president. 
  [Begin Lebedev recording] The negotiating process has begun, 
and both Russia and Ukraine realize there is a need for talks, 
so the results are bound to come -- not at once, perhaps, but 
there will be results. The very fact talks are taking place 
will have a positive influence on developments in the Crimea. 
As for the situation in the Crimea, the president is in control 
-- that is, of the things he can control. He cannot, for 
example, control the fleet, and the troops are also being 
controlled by someone different. [end recording] 
  If the representatives of Russia and Ukraine discuss the 
situation in the Crimea tomorrow, then talks between the 
parliamentary delegations of Simferopol and Kiev will take place 
on 24 May. [passage omitted] And what is the current situation 
like? Once more, here is the press secretary of the Crimean 
president: 
  [Begin Lebedev recording] The situation is normal and quiet. 
The tension exists only on the top level and is largely 
internal. We realize the presidential election in Ukraine is 
scheduled for 26 June and Kravchuk is making his last attempts 
to play the Crimean card and disrupt the election or put some 
sort of pressure on the deputies. We shall try to defend 
ourselves and not give him a pretext to introduce a state of 
emergency and thus avoid the election. It is by this that the 
present situation has been caused and these difficulties are 
mainly temporary. [end recording] [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Melnik] </F>
  [Text] Kiev, 23 May (TASS) -- Some politicians in Ukraine 
have been blaming President Leonid Kravchuk for the situation, 
which has taken shape in the Crimea. Sergey Golovaty, for one, 
said during his appearance on national television on Sunday that 
"the president of Ukraine has shown indecision with regard to 
the leadership of the autonomous republic. We are now in a 
state where Leonid Kravchuk is no longer able to do anything 
because he is three years late. Any actions of his can now 
exacerbate the situation even more." 
  Sergey Golovaty said the only way out of the situation 
consists in "bringing all the latest decrees and resolutions of 
the parliament and the president of the Crimea in line with 
Ukraine's legislation." 
  Former vice-premier, Igor Yukhnovsky, stressed that "Ukraine 
cannot do without the Crimea and will do everything possible to 
preserve its territorial integrity." Some other parliament 
members called for direct presidential rule in the Crimea.

  [Text] Thirty minutes ago we made contact with Yevgeniy 
Saburov, the Crimean head of government, to get his views on 
what is going on in Simferopol. 
  [Begin Saburov recording] The reaction by Kravchuk was 
completely uncalled for. When you ask for the law to be 
observed, you cannot then introduce a state of emergency. That 
is true, unless you have some ulterior motives, so to speak. As 
for ulterior motives, I do not know who thinks they are 
ulterior. They are all out in the open, completely open to view. 
  Here we are talking about the Ukrainian presidential 
election. Everything that is happening in Crimea is linked to 
this issue alone. It is the only way for Leonid Makarevich 
Kravchuk to call off the presidential election. Therefore, 
strictly speaking, it will be completely inaccurate to talk 
about Ukraine here. Here we should be talking about a number of 
characters in the Kiev leadership who are prepared to risk a lot 
in pursuit of their own goals. 
  So, how far are they prepared to go? This, incidentally, is 
a matter for their consciences. [end recording]

<F P=106> ["Statement" of the Christian Democratic Party of Ukraine on </F>
the situation in the Republic of Crimea] 
  [Text] As has become known, Crimean Republic's President 
Meshkov is planning to hold a conference of leaders of the 
autonomy on 20 May 1994, whose agenda includes: the introduction 
of separate Crimean citizenship and dual citizenship; the 
organization of Crimea's Armed Forces; the removal of Ukraine's 
Armed Forces from the peninsula; and joining CIS by the Crimea 
as an independent state. 
  Russia's high statesmen and politicians are taking a lively 
part in anti-Ukrainian activities. Special landing units of 
Russia's Armed Forces are being transferred to the Crimea. 
Crimea's population, as well as all the Ukrainian people are on 
the eve of a tragedy. 
  This threat ensued as a consequence of the capitulative, 
indecisive, and incompetent policies of Ukrainian President 
Kravchuk who demonstrated his inability to carry out his oath -- 
which he swore on the Holy Scripture when assuming his high post 
-- to protect state sovereignty and the territorial integrity of 
Ukraine. The irresponsibility of Ukraine's highest statesman in 
this fateful moment is striking -- instead of safeguarding 
national interests, peace, and stability in the Crimea, Mr. 
Kravchuk pays a visit to Donbass in his search for support for 
canceling presidential and local legislative elections. 
  Today, history gives Mr. Kravchuk the last chance to restore 
people's trust in him: He must defend the law in the Crimea, 
prevent Ukraine's citizens from terrible consequences of 
political adventurism of Crimean Zhirinovskiy's, and stop the 
escalation of the anti-Ukrainian campaign which will inevitably 
lead to bloodshed, violence, and a breakdown of the state. 
  [Signed] The Central Council of the Christian Democratic 
Party of Ukraine

Russian at 1625 GMT on 20 May broadcast the regular "Details" 
program presented by Sergey Dorenko, which was devoted to a 
nine-minute video report by correspondent Vladislav 
Flyarkovskiy. Before introducing this report, Dorenko briefly 
commented on the Crimean crisis, saying: 
  "The Crimean Supreme Soviet today restored the peninsula's 
Constitution, a highly autonomous Constitution, and everyone was 
expecting a response from Kiev and possible clashes. But the 
day passed off without clashes. We spoke to Crimean Prime 
Minister Yevgeniy Saburov over the telephone and he, in contrast 
to us, said that he was more interested in the problem of 
Crimea's sewerage system, and that he did not share our fears 
today."

  [Text] The Ukrainian Supreme Council set up a working 
commission this evening for conducting talks with Crimea. It 
has been revealed that Simferopol's delegation at these talks 
will be headed by Sergey Tsekov, head of the Crimean Supreme 
Soviet. Yevgeniy Saburov, the head of government of the Republic 
of Crimea, expressed a hope in an interview with our radio 
station that the talks will be successful, the conflict 
resolved, and the situation in the Crimea will remain quiet. 
  [Begin Saburov recording] We continue to work in a calm 
manner. Crimea does not respond -- tries not to respond -- to 
provocations. Crimea is living its normal peaceful life. The 
Crimean Government is at the moment working on a report about 
the socioeconomic situation in the Republic, which is very poor. 
The Kiev leaders are disseminating false reports that the 
situation in Crimea is unstable and unquiet and because of this 
people are not coming here very much. I would like to tell you 
that the situation in Crimea is absolutely stable and quiet. No 
one is really interested in these bickerings between 
authorities. The weather here is marvelous and we look forward 
to seeing you all! [end recording]

<F P=106> [Video report by correspondent Nikolay Filippov, including </F>
recorded comment by Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov and Crimean 
Deputy Prime Minister Yevgeniy Saburov] 
  [Excerpts] [Filippov] It is said that history repeats 
itself twice. Today, just as two years ago in May 1992 [when 
the Crimean parliament adopted its own constitution], all 
attention is fixed on the Crimea. [passage omitted] 
  [Meshkov, interviewed in a study] There are politicians who 
are called hawks, but who should probably more accurately be 
called concussed. Among such politicians are several ministers 
who wear military uniforms and who are not now hiding their 
intentions to begin military actions immediately. Under 
pressure from them and evidently with their blessing, the 
military contingent in the Crimea has been increased 10-fold, 
contrary to current legislation that encompasses Crimean 
legislation as well. In violation of their own legislation the 
Crimea is being flooded with military formations. 
  [Saburov] There is no talk of changing borders. It is 
rubbish to say that the Constitution talks of a separation. It 
is written there: The Crimea is within the composition of 
Ukraine. Then it is said that we are rushing things. This 
Constitution was adopted on 6 May 1992. Kiev asked us to wait. 
How long can we wait? [passage omitted] 
  [Saburov] When the first deputy internal affairs minister 
attacks the Crimean Internal Affairs Ministry at 2.30 a.m....it 
is just laughable. It is simply not decent. They are not 
giving the credits promised and agreed for agriculture because 
you are somehow not behaving yourselves quite right there. 
  [Filippov] So, the situation is repeating itself. Once again 
there is a Crimean Constitution, and once again there is a 
Ukrainian ultimatum. Again troops are being sent in and the 
situation on the Black Sea fleet--the fate of which, just like 
the Crimea's, has not been decided by the two presidents--is 
heating up. 
  [Meshkov] I had no intention of worsening relations with the 
Kiev administration. I do not want to worsen our relations in 
the period before the Ukrainian presidential elections, or by 
worsening relations give those forces that are already obliged 
to leave the political scene the opportunity to preserve their 
power.

  [Text] Moscow 21 May TASS -- Crimean President Yuriy 
Meshkov called for guarantees of the implementation of the 
three-party agreement on the Crimea signed by Russia, Ukraine 
and the United States. 
  Speaking on Russian television on Saturday [21 May], Meshkov 
said that "we recognise our responsibility both to the people of 
Ukraine and the people of Russia" for possible consequences that 
the current developments may entail. He stressed that the 
Crimea's "willingness to work things out" must be "supported and 
guaranteed by all sides." 
  He described as "understandable" the situation when "the 
most 
acute problem of the Black Sea Fleet" based in the peninsula "is 
being solved without the participation of the Republic of 
Crimea." Meshkov emphasised that the problem "affects residents 
of the Republic of Crimea" and their interests. 
  He confirmed his intention "to solve all disputes on the 
basis of mutually beneficial and mutually acceptable terms." 
Meshkov said that at first the Crimea and Ukraine must sign an 
agreement in order to stabilise the situation and create 
conditions for signing an agreement between Russia and Ukraine. 
  He stressed that this must be done in exactly this order, 
not 
vice versa. The president warned that the opposite may put the 
Crimea outside the settlement process and have a negative impact 
on the talks.

  [Text] Having restored the Crimean Constitution to its 
previous version, the Crimean Supreme Council session is 
continuing to surprise everyone with its highly productive work. 
Only two hours after adopting the law on restoring the 
constitutional foundations of statehood on the peninsula, it 
adopted a resolution on compulsory military service for Crimean 
citizens. According to this document, sending Crimean 
conscripts to serve in other regions of Ukraine is halted 
simultaneously with the adoption of the resolution. They will 
be sent outside the Crimea only with their consent. The Supreme 
Council charged military commissars of the Crimean Republic and 
Sevastopol with ensuring implementation of this resolution. 
  Explaining the adoption of this resolution, the deputies 
were 
referring to the bullying of conscripts [words indistinct], as 
well as an anti-Crimean syndrome apparently widespread in the 
Ukrainian Armed Forces, predominantly in western oblasts. At 
the same time, Crimean Military Commissar Oleksandr Volkov, 
assured that, according to agreements reached with the 
autonomous republic, conscripts have not been sent to these 
oblasts for a year and a half. He also noted that the 
implementation of this resolution is unrealistic due to the lack 
of efficient material utilization and education in the Crimea.

secretary of the Odessa military district commander, refuted 
reports by the "Ostankino" TV company about Ukrainian troops 
movements, which took place in Crimea. He said information 
about the movement of Ukrainian tanks in the vicinity of the 
village of Tylovoye, about the deployment of a field hospital in 
the village of Chernobayevka, and about the movement of the 
special purpose troops do not correspond to reality. The 32d 
Army Corps also remains in its deployment site. A routine 
inspection is being carried out in the Odessa military district 
units. A similar inspection will get under way in Crimea on 23 
May.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: By correspondents </F>
Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and others] 
  [Text] "The Ukrainian leadership's decision to deploy a 
group of national guards and specially trained troops in the 
Crimea is fraught with serious consequences primarily for 
Ukraine itself. It cannot fail to give rise to concern in 
Moscow," a senior member of Russia's Foreign Ministry in charge 
of Russian-Ukrainian relations told INTERFAX on Friday [20 May]. 
  According to him, "now the danger of displaying extremism by 
both Kiev and Simferopol, with all the ensuing consequences, is 
greater than ever before." 
  "We do not back the Crimean radicals, of course. 
Nevertheless Ukraine, which is, speaking figuratively, in 
another weight division, should behave as it befits a big 
power," the diplomat said. 
  So far the Crimean people have acted in the framework of 
democratic procedures, without violating Ukrainian legislation, 
he noted. "As regard Kiev, it is not quite clear how it 
interprets democracy and contemporary international law. To 
despatch troops is not a good way out of the situation," said 
INTERFAX's interviewee. 
  According to him, "if events in the Crimea develop in the 
same vein, this might grow into a long-term conflict." "The 
experience of the former Yugoslavia shows that playing with fire 
ends in a big blaze," he said. 
  According to INTERFAX's interviewee, actions taken by the 
Ukrainian leadership can largely be attributed to the current 
political situation. "The striving of some Ukrainian politicians 
to score additional points on the eve of presidential elections 
can be understood, but when it grows into troop movements, it 
can hardly be viewed as normal," he said. 
  Ukraine "can hardly find anything wrong in Russia's 
behavior," the diplomat pointed out. "It's characteristic that 
neither Russia's president and government nor parliament have 
made any official statements or taken sharp steps so far," he 
said. 
  Nevertheless, Kiev "has not abandoned its attempts to find a 
foe from without," said INTERFAX's interviewee. 
  On Wednesday the press service of Ukraine's President 
released a statement to the effect that "dangerous processes in 
the Crimea are stimulated by some Russian politicians, whose 
actions acquired the signs of open interference in Ukraine's 
internal affairs of late." "We do not even want to comment on 
such statements; let them remain on Ukraine's conscience," the 
Russian diplomat said. 
  According to him, Kiev's argument is that it must take the 
necessary steps to maintain Ukraine's territorial integrity. "An 
attempt to shift the issue of territorial integrity to another 
plain is in evidence. Russia has declared more than once that 
it lays no claims on the Crimea, viewing it as an integral part 
of Ukraine, to which it has no territorial claims. Nevertheless 
some Ukrainian politicians persist in speculating on the 
"Russian factor," the diplomat said.

  [Text] The press center of our state's Foreign Affairs 
Ministry reported today the deep concern of the world community 
in connection with the Crimean events, directed at changing the 
legal status of the autonomous republic as a constituent part of 
Ukraine. Their disquietude is also evoked by tendencies, which 
lead to tension in interethnic relations on the peninsula and 
threaten peace and calm in the region. The report by the press 
center of Ukraine's Foreign Affairs Ministry notes that the 
European and world community, in the person of official factors 
and the mass media, is expressing its support for the principles 
of Ukraine's territorial integrity and the inviolability of its 
borders. They are also calling on political forces, which are 
destabilizing the situation in this region, to a balanced 
approach and the understanding of their responsibility to 
mankind.

  [Text] Kiev, 20 May (UKRINFORM-TASS) -- A statement by the 
Ukrainian Foreign Ministry press center was distributed today to 
the mass media. It says: 
  "On 20 May, the Supreme Soviet of Crimea adopted a law on 
`The restoration of the constitutional bases of the statehood of 
the Republic of Crimea,' thus making an attempt to restore 
Crimea's Constitution to its 6 May 1992 form. This law is 
unconstitutional and illegal. It is leading to tension in 
interethnic relations on the peninsula and in Ukraine as a 
whole, and brings into question the legal status of the Republic 
of Crimea as a constituent part of Ukraine, which represents a 
direct threat to the territorial integrity of Ukraine and peace 
and stability in the region." 
  In this connection A.M. Zlenko, Ukrainian foreign affairs 
minister, has sent letters to the UN secretary general, chairman 
of the Security Committee, CSCE chairman, NATO secretary 
general, heads of other international organizations, and foreign 
affairs ministers of other countries. In his letters the head 
of the Ukrainian foreign policy department stresses, in 
particular, that this unlawful decision, provoked by 
irresponsible policies of the present Crimean leadership, is 
aimed at undermining Ukraine's constitutional structures and its 
territorial integrity, and cannot be qualified as anything other 
than an open attempt by separatist forces to jeopardize internal 
political stability in Ukraine and bring about tension in 
relations between Ukraine and Russia. This puts in danger peace 
and stability in the region and in the whole of Europe, which, 
taking into account a complex current situation in this part of 
the continent, can have grave negative consequences. 
  "Today, when the European countries participating in the 
Conference on the Pact on Stability in Europe have agreed on the 
exceptional importance of the unconditional preservation and 
consolidation of the principles of territorial integrity, and 
the inviolability of existing borders as a guarantee of peace 
and security in Europe, such separatist strivings by the 
leadership of the Republic of Crimea could lead to the further 
erosion of these fundamental international legal principles, 
upon which European stability is based. 
  "In the event of the situation escalating further as a 
consequence of irresponsible steps by extremist forces in 
Crimea, Ukraine reserves the right to adopt all necessary 
measures to ensure unconditionally the territorial integrity of 
the state in accordance with its constitution and existing 
legislation, while observing the norms of international law."

  [Text] A statement by the press center of Ukraine's Defense 
Ministry: 
  Certain political forces are continuing to exacerbate the 
already tense situation around the Crimea. Confirmation of this 
is the attempt by a group of unidentified armed people to seize 
a command post of a unit of Ukraine's air defense troops in the 
town of Sevastopol. However, the precisely organized guarding 
of the facility and the resolute actions by servicemen of 
Ukraine's Armed Forces were an obstacle in the criminals' path. 
  The telephone call by Mr. (Mykhaylov), an aide to the 
president of the Republic of Crimea, to Lieutenant General 
Mykhaylo Lopatin, commander of Ukraine's air defense troops, 
also evokes certain reflections. The former employee of the 
Personnel Department [Osobovyy Viddil] of the USSR KGB was 
suddenly interested in what the Ukrainian air defense forces 
would do in the event of the unsanctioned appearance of aircraft 
from foreign states over the Crimea. 
  The press service of Ukraine's Defense Ministry confirms the 
reply by the commander of the air defense forces that in cases 
of violations of Ukraine's air space the air defense troops will 
act in accordance with the regulations on combat duty, employing 
the necessary forces and means. 
  In this context, the latest resolution by Crimea's Supreme 
Council on Crimeans undergoing military service only on the 
territory of the peninsula also puts one on one's guard. This 
document not only runs counter to Ukraine's current legislation 
and the demands of the state's defense capabilities, but also 
creates additional tension in society and among the troops. 
  The press service of Ukraine's Defense Ministry states that 
military formations of Ukraine's Armed Forces deployed in the 
Crimea are subordinate to the Defense Ministry of Ukraine and 
will carry out orders of the supreme commander in chief of the 
Armed Forces and the defense minister of Ukraine in the 
interests of ensuring our state's territorial integrity, its 
defense capabilities, and the inviolability of its borders. Any 
provocative actions directed against Ukraine and its Armed 
Forces will continue to be resolutely repulsed.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko and </F>
Mikhail Melnik] 
  [Text] Kiev, 21 May -- The Ukrainian Defense Ministry has 
described as "nothing but rumors" the reports in the Russian 
media on the concentration of Ukrainian troops near Sevastopol 
and Simferopol. 
  "This blatant lie is being circulated with references to 
Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, which is surprising, to 
say the least," said the Ukrainian Defense Ministry's press 
service today. "It remains to be guessed whether this is another 
political ploy of the Russian defense minister or merely his 
habitual trust in dubious sources of information." 
  The Ukrainian Defense Ministry's press service is authorized 
to declare that "the interference of the Russian Federation 
Defense Ministry in the affairs of the united Black Sea Fleet 
which, under the Yalta agreement, is subordinated directly to 
the presidents of Ukraine and Russia, stands in the way of a 
civilized solution to the fleet division issue and creates a 
dangerous tension in the situation in the Crimea."

  "We will not reckon with something or somebody. The Crimea 
is an integral part of Ukraine, and we will give it to nobody at

provoked this situation will be the first to carry full 
responsibility," said the minister.

<F P=106> [Video report by correspondent Murtazin; from the "Novosti" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] Today, Leonid Kravchuk held a meeting to discuss the 
political situation in Crimea. The president of Ukraine intends 
to cancel the decision taken by the Crimean Supreme Soviet to 
restore the Crimean Constitution of 6 May 1992, according to 
which legal relations between Ukraine and Crimea are on a treaty 
basis and the people of Crimea have the right to dual 
citizenship. Earlier on television, Kravchuk announced that he 
will act decisively and consistently within the Constitution to 
protect Ukraine's territorial integrity. 
  At the same time, in Kiev, the republic's Supreme Council is 
meeting behind closed doors and the president is expected to 
speak. He intends to persuade the deputies to cancel the verdict 
by the Crimean Supreme Council and will most likely get approval 
for introducing a regime of special rule in Crimea. 
  [Announcer Nelli Petkova] Our correspondent has just 
reported 
that Ukraine's Supreme Council has adopted the following 
decision: To recommend that Crimea's Supreme Soviet reexamine 
and cancel its constitutional decision. If it fails to do so, 
in 10 days a decision by the Ukraine's Supreme Council on 
suspending the acts in question adopted by the Crimean 
parliament will automatically come into force. This decision 
was made at about 2000 Moscow time. 
  The deputies then started to set up a special deputies' 
commission, which, along with people's deputies from Crimea, 
will go to Simferopol to settle all these problems.

  [Text] Kiev, [no dateline as received] -- At the evening 
plenary session of the Ukrainian Supreme Council held behind 
closed doors today, the president of Ukraine submitted a draft 
resolution of the Supreme Council of Ukraine "On stopping the 
effect of the Law of the Republic of Crimea `On restoring the 
constitutional fundamentals of the statehood of the Republic of 
Crimea.'" It, in particular, states that today the Supreme 
Council of Crimea, as a matter of fact, restored the provision 
of the Constitution of the Republic of Crimea in its 6 May 1992 
wording, which deals, first and foremost, with the establishment 
of relations between Crimea and Ukraine on the basis of treaties 
and agreements, and the introduction of Crimean citizenship. 
All this is a step toward Crimea's secession from the 
composition of Ukraine, which violates the territorial integrity 
of Ukraine, its state sovereignty, and contradicts the 
principles of international law. 
  According to the legislation currently in force, the top 
state power bodies in the Republic of Crimea have no right to 
solve the issues that are within the competence of the state 
bodies of Ukraine. The volume of the plenary powers of the 
Republic of Crimea cannot be changed without the consent of the 
Supreme Council of Ukraine. 
  The resolution envisages "with the aim of protecting state 
sovereignty and ensuring the supremacy of the laws of Ukraine on 
its entire territory TO STOP [capitals as per original text] the 
effect of the Law of the Republic of Crimea of 20 May 1994 `On 
restoring the constitutional fundamentals of the statehood of 
the Republic of Crimea' as such that contradicts the declaration 
on state sovereignty and the Constitution of Ukraine." The 
Supreme Council of Ukraine proposes that the parliament of 
Crimea should bring the Constitution of the Republic of Crimea 
in line with the Constitution and the legislation of Ukraine 
within 10 days. 
  Today, political leaders, parties, and public organizations 
expressed their attitudes toward the decisions by the Supreme 
Council of Crimea. 
  Vasyl Durdynets, chairman of the parliamentary group 
"Tsentr" 
[Center]: 
  In general, my attitude toward any sanctions is very 
cautious. But with regard to the concrete situation in Crimea, 
when Ukraine allocates its last money, withdrawing it from other 
regions (for example, 50 billion karbovantsi were transferred to 
Sevastopol on 18 May), while the leadership of Crimea 
intentionally continues to act contrary, sanctions on the part 
of Ukraine would be logical and legitimate in order to bring 
those who stake their all against our state down to earth. 
Probably, it is not expedient to resort to extremities and 
introduce a state of emergency, however, I do not know any state 
that would respond to such actions of its region so reluctantly. 
I believe that in the last resort we will appeal to the world 
public. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Mykola Zhulynskyy, people's deputy of 
the Supreme Council of Ukraine: 
  I am extremely worried about what I have seen in Crimea of 
late. First and foremost, this is the opposition between the 
Majlis of the Crimean Tatar people and President Yuriy Meshkov. 
The Crimean Tatars favor Ukraine's territorial integrity and 
openly declare that they smell gunpowder in the air. In my 
opinion, Yuriy Meshkov is provoking the aggravation of the 
situation. Serhiy Tsekov, chairman of the Supreme Council of 
Crimea, whom I met at a mourning ceremony in connection with the 
50th anniversary of the Crimean Tatars' deportation, declared 
that he was inclined to the necessity of setting up a commission 
of the Supreme Council of Crimea to hold consultations with the 
representatives of the Supreme Council of Ukraine on issues of 
Crimean Tatars and relations between Ukraine and Crimea. (As 
UNIAN reported today in a special release, such a commission, 
chaired by Serhiy Tsekov, was set up at the Supreme Council of 
Crimea session on 20 May). 
  The People's Movement of Ukraine [Rukh], in its appeal to 
the 
citizens of Ukraine, states that the actions by the Supreme 
Council of Crimea endanger Ukraine's territorial integrity and 
lead to igniting a fratricidal war as a result of which peace in 
Ukraine and, therefore, in the entire European and Black Sea 
region, is endangered. The appeal asserts that all the actions 
by the "helmsmen of Crimea are encouraged by the deputies to the 
Russian Federation State Duma, with the president of Russia 
being aware of this." In the opinion of the authors of the 
appeal, the interests of the 700,000-strong Ukrainian population 
in Crimea and also the interests of the Crimean Tatars are 
totally ignored. 
  Stepan Khmara, people's deputy, chairman of the Ukrainian 
Conservative Republican Party: 
  This antistate act must be stopped by the most radical 
means, 
because this is an attempt upon the integrity of the state. 
Yuriy Meshkov and his company must be arrested as conspirators. 
The president's veto is insufficient at this point, more 
radical actions are necessary, all structures must be involved 
to protect the state. 
  Volodymyr Marchenko, people's deputy of Ukraine, one of the 
leaders of the Socialist Party of Ukraine parliamentary group: 
  Socialists will not agree to Crimea's secession from 
Ukraine. 
The territorial integrity of the state envisages Crimea within 
the composition of Ukraine. This is unequivocal. 
  Participants in the Political Parties Club, which is taking 
place in Kiev (the Ukrainian Party of Justice, the Party of Free 
Peasants, the Constitutional-Democratic Party of Ukraine, the 
Social- Democratic Party of Ukraine, the Democratic Party of 
Ukraine, the Ukrainian Republican Party, People's Movement of 
Ukraine, the Labor Congress of Ukraine, and the Congress of 
Ukrainian Nationalists), adopted an appeal to the president and 
the chairman of the Supreme Council of Ukraine "in connection 
with the aggravation of the political situation in Ukraine, 
first and foremost, connected with Crimea" to hold a joint 
meeting for consultations and the soonest possible solution of 
the existing problem.

  [Text] The Presidium of the Sixth Crimean Supreme Council 
today adopted a law of the Crimean Republic on restoring the 
constitutional foundations of the Crimean Republic's statehood. 
Thus, the fundamental law of the Crimean Republic from 6 May 
1992 was restored on the territory of the peninsula. 
  In this way, the deputies ignored an appeal by Ukrainian 
President Leonid Kravchuk, asking them not to take such a 
dangerous step aimed at encroaching upon Ukraine's territorial 
integrity. (?As early as yesterday), Crimean President Meshkov 
asked the deputies to temporarily suspend the debate on this 
issue. Deputies, however, did not listen. 
  Arguments in favor of restoring the constitution in its 
previous form were voiced at the session, mainly referring to 
the Crimean people's [word indistinct] and will expressed during 
a presidential poll. It was emphasized that a return to the 
previous constitution does not mean Crimea's secession from 
Ukraine. Article (?11) of the constitution from 6 May 1992 
states that the Crimean Republic is a part of Ukraine, and that 
its relations with Ukraine are based on agreements and treaties. 
The law of the Crimean Republic on restoring the constitutional 
foundations of the Crimean Republic's statehood was adopted 
without including it on the agenda; 69 out of 83 deputies 
present at the session voted for adopting it. The session also 
appointed a delegation for talks with the Ukrainian Supreme 
Council.

  [Text] "The Crimean and USSR referendums of 20 January and 
17 March 1991, public opinion surveys in the republic and the 
spring elections to the Supreme Soviet of Crimea this year... 
The fervor of the patriotic movement of Crimeans have 
demonstrated beyond doubt the irreversible desire to return to 
the bosom of their age-old homeland -- Russia." The above 
statements are contained in the drafts of addresses seen by 
deputies of the Crimean Supreme Soviet today to the Ukrainian 
parliament and Russian State Duma. 
  The draft address to the Ukrainian parliament, adopted at 
its 
first reading, states that "the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet would 
be making a gesture of profound wisdom if it stated on behalf of 
Ukraine, a brethren nation, that the transfer of Crimea to 
Ukraine by Russia in 1954 without the consent of its citizens 
was unjust and an illegal voluntarist act by irresponsible 
individuals." 
  The draft says the Crimean people should have the right to 
decide to which country it should be joined. For its part, the 
Crimean Supreme Soviet is prepared to adopt the necessary 
resolution and hold a nationwide referendum on the issue, 
monitored by Ukraine and the United Nations. The question would 
be worded in the appropriate manner and bear the signature of 
the Supreme Soviet of Crimea. 
  The draft address to Russia's State Duma contains an appeal 
to "finally... Approve and bring to life the Russian Supreme 
Soviet's resolution of 21 May, 1992, on a legal assessment of 
the decision by the RSFSR authorities in 1954 to alter the 
status of Crimea." 
  In accordance with section two of the resolution, the 
Crimean 
Supreme Soviet is prepared to adopt the necessary resolution and 
hold a nationwide referendum on the issue with an appropriately 
worded question. 
  "The Supreme Soviet of Crimea is counting on decisive 
decisions being made jointly with the state Duma on the speedy 
and final definition of Russian federal status for Crimea," the 
draft reads.

  [Text] Sevastopol, 20 May -- Leonid Hrach, head of the 
Communist Party of Crimea, commenting on today's decision by the 
Crimean Supreme Council to renew the operation of the autonomy's 
Constitution in its 1992 form, called on the parliamentarians to 
stop and not to let the decision, which was adopted, provoke a 
military conflict in the Crimea. "If blood is spilled in the 
Crimea, we will not be able to talk about conducting any kind of 
reforms," he emphasized. Mr. Hrach addressed a proposal to 
Yuriy Meshkov, the president of the autonomy, to begin talks and 
consultations with Ukraine's leadership. 
  Incidentally, 69 out of 73 deputies (there are 98 deputies 
in 
Crimea's Supreme Council) voted to renew the Constitution of 
Crimea in its 1992 form. The group of Crimean Tatars (14 
persons) refused to take part in the voting. 
  The statement by the Crimean Supreme Council's press center, 
which was disseminated today, says that the inclusion of this 
issue on the session's agenda had been done "at the will of the 
people of Crimea."

    [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian at 0715 GMT on 21 May, in a "How Shall We Live?" 
program, carries a 45-minute live studio discussion of current 
developments in the Crimea. The Russian guests include Ramazan 
Abdulatipov, deputy chairman of the Federation Council; Marshal 
Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov; Emil Pain, member of the presidential 
council; and academician Valeriy Shchegortsov. Crimean guests 
include President Yuriy Meshkov and Vice President Yevgeniy 
Saburov through a link-up studio in Simferopol. 
  Yuriy Meshkov begins by saying: 
  "The name of this television program is How Shall We Live? 
My reply is that we shall live normally. Those who have packed 
their suitcases and are planning to go on holiday to the Crimea 
don't need to unpack. What is happening and what is behind it? 
Typical political games. In this particular case they have 
been generated by a forthcoming event in Ukraine -- the 
Ukrainian presidential elections. And all the games are around 
this event. It is important not to go too far with these games. 
  "As for the Crimea, all is quiet here. We have no reason to 
be alarmed. But, naturally, this does not mean that one can 
forget about us, give us up, and not help us to resolve 
problems, which Russia's involvement would obviously help in 
tackling." 
  Ramazan Abdulatipov says: 
  "Most of the Crimean problems are political. They must be 
resolved by politicians. Yuriy Aleksandrovich Meshkov was 
absolutely right when he said politicians, instead of resolving 
the problems...[pauses]. I have dozens of agreements signed by 
the Russian and Ukrainian presidents. In fact, these agreements 
are not being implemented by either side. To a larger degree, 
they are not being implemented by -- I don't want to attack the 
Ukrainian side now -- they are not being implemented by the 
Ukrainian side, in fact. 
  "I agree the present problem has been whipped up by the 
current political struggle in Ukraine. Because Ukrainian 
politicians were frightened by the fact that socialists and 
communists were coming back to take part in the parliamentary 
elections. And under the circumstances a new spur of 
nationalism is needed -- I would put it that way -- and to stir 
up nationalism, especially in western areas, the Crimean factor 
is being used, instead of resolving the matter in the interests 
of the Black Sea Fleet sailors, in the interests of Russia and 
Ukraine. 
  ``Moreover, and I would like to stress it again, it is 
impossible to find a single person in Russia who would admit 
that the Crimea is part of Ukraine. But this does not mean in 
any way the problem should be resolved by strong-arm methods 
destroying the integrity of the existing Ukrainian state. I 
would like to stress again that people and, above all, the 
military, become hostages of politicians. These people should be 
released.'' 
  Emil Pain adds: 
  "I have been studying conflicts for a long time. It happens 
practically every time that there cannot be one side in a 
conflict. If there is a conflict brewing, both sides are adding 
gunpowder to it. Therefore the rule that says look at yourself 
first and ask yourself whether you are doing everything right 
should be addressed to the Crimean leaders and the Crimean 
parliament." 
  Meshkov says: 
  "What circumstance cannot be changed by anyone? The 
circumstance that geographically the Crimea is connected with 
Ukraine and Russia. Nobody can change the geographical position 
and, as far as I know, nobody is going to encroach upon it. 
  ``But there is another circumstance that does not depend on 
politicians and that cannot be changed by anyone. The 
circumstance that before 1954 [when the Crimea became part of 
Ukraine following a decree by Nikita Khrushchev] and after 1954, 
the people of the Crimea were and remain part of the Russian 
people. It is another matter that administrative redivisions 
inside the Soviet Union have introduced new circumstances, and 
it would be wise to take these circumstances into account. 
  ``From the start, from the moment the Crimean president was 
elected, our moves, I mean, the moves of the government, and 
they were fully approved by the Crimean people, were aimed at 
achieving economic prosperity. And with this aim, economic 
reforms have been and are being implemented, economic relations 
are being established, and treaties are being signed with the 
subjects of the Russian Federation.'' 
  He adds: 
  "In the same way we can and must resolve the mutual problems 
arising in our relations with the Kiev administration. There is 
no other way. And we don't want any other way. Our only desire 
is to solve all problems causing tension in our relations. 
There is a way and a method of resolving problems by treaty. 
And it has been tried and approved by Russia already. It is a 
solution to the problem, and it has already been confirmed that 
it is possible. It is necessary and it produces positive 
results. 
  ``We put forward the same proposal to the administration in 
Kiev. In return, you have already heard what has been taking 
place and what is artificially being whipped up to implement 
narrow individual political aims. 
  ``I don't share the optimism of my colleagues in the Russian 
studio that the Ukrainian president will keep his word. You 
know, we have had so many opportunities to see the exact 
opposite. Evidently the efforts of public opinion should be 
mobilized to alleviate the task of the Ukrainian president in 
keeping his word.'' 
  Yevgeniy Saburov says: 
  "First of all, misunderstanding around the Constitution 
should be explained. Some disinformation is being spread that 
this is an act of secession, so to speak. This is absolutely 
wrong. The constitution states plainly that the Crimea is part 
of Ukraine. In fact, only one clause is at issue -- the treaty 
question. We have been exhausted by the fact that we cannot 
understand what we can and cannot do." 
  Back in Moscow, the announcer reads out messages from 
viewers 
who express concern over the future of the Black Sea Fleet. 
Marshal Shaposhnikov says: 
  "All these processes began at the end of 1991 and are still 
going on now. In practice they have not been resolved because 
of political ambitions. What can I propose? The navy of the 
former USSR consisted of four constituent parts: the Pacific, 
Northern, Baltic, and Black Sea. As regards the first three, 
there are no problems. They belong to Russia and nobody else is 
laying claim to their constituent parts. 
  ``As for the Black Sea Fleet, there are three sides at 
present which, in my opinion, are legally aspiring to some part 
of it -- Russia, Ukraine, and Georgia. As one knows, there are 
11 states in the CIS. Most of them signed the CIS collective 
security treaty. Ukraine did not sign the treaty. Consequently, 
one-eleventh of the Black Sea fleet should be given to Ukraine. 
As for the remaining parts of the fleet, ten-elevenths of it 
should be subordinated to the CIS combined armed forces, which 
would ensure collective security in the Mediterranean region 
where, as one knows, there is an American presence with nuclear 
missiles. This part, the main part of the Black Sea fleet, 
could watch moves by our partner -- we hope it will be our ally 
one day but at present peace is fragile, as one knows -- in the 
interests of the whole of the Commonwealth and not one 
individual side. With financial quotas and so on. If it is 
difficult for some CIS states, even members of the CIS security 
system, to support their one-eleventh of the fleet, they can 
delegate their part to a third party; for example, in exchange 
for oil, gas, coal, metal, grain, for anything in fact." 
  Abdulatipov says: 
  "It is a very serious problem. More than 50,000 Ukrainian 
troops are concentrated in the Crimea at present. Literally a 
few days ago special purpose troops were redeployed there. The 
Berkut, Sokol, and other groups have been redeployed there. I 
received this information from Sevastopol this morning. The 
situation is that any provocation might lead to a wide-scale 
conflict. Therefore, it would be a good thing for our 
politicians to start negotiating and implementing the agreements 
that have already been signed." 
  Emil Pain adds: 
  "I am ready to admit and I think one should admit that the 
Russian media are biased in their coverage of the problem. For 
example, our TV link today is between Russia and the Crimea. 
Yet we are talking of Ukraine all the time. It would be 
perfectly reasonable if Ukraine were taking part in the program. 
  ``I don't think we should go into details about the origin 
of 
the word Ukraine. It is an independent state at present 
recognized by the UN. The Crimean constitution says the Crimea 
remains part of the Ukrainian state. I think certain complaints 
should be made to the Crimean leadership. And if we are talking 
here about how to help the Ukrainian president to keep his 
promise not to use force, to a large degree this depends on the 
actions of the Crimean leadership. You are talking of 
negotiations, but unilateral actions are a very bad condition 
for any negotiations. I am not talking here of the content of 
the constitution adopted by the Crimean parliament, but it is an 
absolute fact that the parliament adopted it unilaterally." 
  In return, Meshkov says: 
  "I would like to remind you that the most acute issue, the 
problem of the Black Sea Fleet, was excluded from the competence 
and involvement of the Crimea by a decision of the Kiev 
administration. Ukrainian Defense Minister Radetskyy, he was 
perhaps the first official in the Kiev administration who 
isolated the Crimea from Ukraine when he categorically refused 
to allow the Crimean Republic, representatives of the Crimean 
president, to participate or at least to be present silently at 
the talks on the Black Sea Fleet. This situation is unthinkable 
for any sensible person, and it is quite difficult to understand 
it from the political point of view, since the problem is being 
resolved on Crimean territory. This problem concerns the 
citizens of Crimea and directly touches upon our interests. And 
not to take them into account is physically impossible, but it 
seems it is possible politically." 
  He adds: 
  "Our intention is to reach an agreement, to resolve all 
points at issue, not to walk away from them but to resolve them 
on mutually beneficial and mutually acceptable conditions. And 
a treaty would make it possible to define the range of problems 
and solve them. And I would like it very much if first of all 
there could be a treaty between the Crimea and Ukraine to 
stabilize the situation and define and create preconditions for 
a treaty between Ukraine and Russia, which is inevitable and 
necessary, I think. But only that way round -- no other way at 
all -- since otherwise we should be prevented from resolving the 
points at issue. 
  ``I don't think our non-participation will have a beneficial 
effect on the results of the talks. We realize our 
responsibility to the people of Ukraine and to the people of 
Russia since we are part of it. We are aware of possible 
consequences of preserving and implementing a tripartite 
agreement between Russia, Ukraine, and the United States. But 
we would also like, and, I think, we are entitled to expect, 
that our wishes to reach an agreement will be supported and 
guaranteed by all the parties.'' 
  Yevgeniy Saburov says: 
  "The Crimea can make no claims whatsoever on Ukraine and the 
Ukrainian people. We Russians and Ukrainians are fraternal 
peoples. We have a lot of Ukrainians here. We do not really 
make any distinction by nationality. What is under discussion 
here is a particular Kiev administration that has appeared at a 
particular time and seems to be a temporary one, rather than 
confrontation between the Crimea and Ukraine, which is being 
whipped up artificially."

  [Text] We have received a statement from the press service 
of the commander of Ukraine's National Guard: 
  As has become well-known, Valeriy Kuznetsov, Crimea's 
minister of internal affairs, has disseminated false information 
that the subunits of Ukraine's National Guard, which are 
deployed in Simferopol, were supposedly brought to combat 
readiness and received an order to storm the town's vital 
facilities. In truth, the Simferopol guardsmen's military unit 
personnel are in their barracks. 
  On the evening of 21 May, Viktor Mezhak, first deputy 
chairman of the Crimea's Supreme Council, visited the unit with 
a group of deputies, who ascertained that the guardsmen had 
normal everyday concerns unconnected with some kind of emergency 
preparations. In particular, Aleksandr Kostikov, commander of 
the unit, reported that he had not received any orders and had 
not given the order to his subordinates to prepare for any 
emergency actions. 
  And here Valeriy Kuznetsov resorted to deceit to have a 
reason for his own provocative actions. At about 1800 [1500 
GMT] on 21 May, the minister brought the employees of the 
Crimean Internal Affairs Ministry to increased combat readiness 
and armed them with automatic weapons. He ordered them to carry 
out reinforced protection of the television and radio center, 
the telephone exchange, and the Supreme Council of Crimea. 
  The press service of the commander of Ukraine's National 
Guard states: The guard's subunits are in the places of their 
permanent deployment. The citizens of Simferopol may be calm. 
Ukraine's National Guard is not preparing for the assaults 
invented by Mr. Kuznetsov.

  [Text] Moscow/Kiev 22 May TASS -- The situation on the 
Crimean Peninsula remains rather tense. According to a 
spokesman for the Crimean president, 29 Ukrainian armoured 
personnel vehicles entered the regional capital Simferopol on 
Sunday [22 May] night. With this in view, the Crimean Interior 
Ministry reinforced its units securing key government buildings, 
including the main broadcasting centre and parliament 
headquarters, the spokesman reported. 
  According to reliable military sources, the armoured 
vehicles 
brought by railway are now deployed at the station of Simferopol. 
  The Black Sea Fleet's combat units are staying at their 
usual 
locations, a spokesman for the fleet's headquarters told TASS. 
Because of the volatile situation in the Crimea, the fleet 
reinforced the guard of its installations, but there are no 
manoeuvres or redeployment. 
  Meanwhile, in an interview with national television on 
Sunday 
night, Ukraine's First Deputy Interior Minister Valentin 
Nedrigailo denied reports about sending Ukrainian armoured 
personnel vehicles to Simferopol. According to him, the 
situation in the Crimea and Ukraine is quite calm.

  [Text] First Deputy Ukrainian Interior Minister Valentin 
Nedrigailo called allegations of an impending armed 
confrontation in Simferopol as a stupid statement. He told 
INTERFAX-Ukraine on Sunday [22 May] evening that people were 
walking across the city and nothing was happening. "This is a 
state of illness" when one imagines intervention and troops in 
the streets, he remarked. 
  Nedrigailo pointed out that there had been complete mutual 
understanding and confidence between the Ukrainian and the 
Crimean interior ministries. He added that the Ukrainian 
National Guard units were carrying out their law enforcement 
duties together with Crimean police officers. 
  Commenting on the information concerning Ukrainian armored 
vehicles in Simferopol, Nedrigailo said their arrival in 
Simferopol had been made known long ago. First Deputy Crimean 
Parliament Chairman Viktor Mezhak and a group of Crimean 
parliamentarians had been present when the armored vehicles 
arrived on Saturday. 
  Nedrigailo announced that about twenty armored vehicles had 
come. Non-official sources said that there had been about 29 
armored vehicles arriving in Simferopol. 
  It is just normal equipment of the National Guards with 
armored carriers, Nedrigailo emphasized.

  [Excerpts] Kiev, [no dateline as received] -- At the 
Crimean Supreme Council's plenary sitting on 21 May, Crimean 
President Yuriy Meshkov congratulated the deputies on the 
adoption of the Crimean law "On restoring the constitutional 
basis of the Republic of Crimea's statehood" and declared that 
the constitution he had sworn allegiance to was that adopted on 
6 May 1992. 
  Yuriy Meshkov gave an account of his tour of Krasnodar on 20 
May, where he took part in the work of the Association of 
Socio-Economic Cooperation between North Caucasian republics, 
krays, and oblasts. At the association's sitting in Krasnodar, 
Crimea was admitted to this North Caucasian organization as an 
associate member. In Yuriy Meshkov's words, preparations for 
Crimea's entry into the association had been under way for six 
months, especially since his election as president. During his 
stay in Krasnodar, the Crimean president also took part in the 
work of the Grand Assembly of Cossack Host Atamans and met 
representatives of the Krasnodar kray public. [passage omitted] 
  Crimean Supreme Council Deputy Viktor Mezhak informed the 
deputies that, under the accord of 21 May with the head of the 
Supreme Council of Ukraine Secretariat, a Crimean Supreme 
Council delegation, to be led by Crimean parliamentary speaker 
Serhiy Tsekov, would meet a Ukrainian Supreme Council 
delegation, to be led by Borys Oliynyk, in Kiev next week.

Mikhail Melnik] 
  [Text] Kiev, 21 May -- The Ukrainian Supreme Council has 
suspended the Crimean law that reinstates the constitutional 
foundation of statehood for this autonomous republic. The 
resolution adopted by the Ukrainian Supreme Council proposes 
that within 10 days the Crimean Supreme Council bring the 
Constitution of the Republic of Crimea in line with the 
Constitution of Ukraine and the law on the division of powers 
between the bodies of state power of Ukraine and the Republic of 
Crimea. 
  The Ukraine Supreme Council considers that the Crimean 
parliamentarians, by adopting such a decision, intend to build 
future relations between Ukraine and Crimea on the basis of 
agreements and to introduce Crimean citizenship. In their 
opinion, this is a step toward Crimea's seceding from Ukraine. 
This violates Ukraine's territorial integrity and state 
sovereignty and contradicts the recognized principles of 
international law. According to previously adopted legislative 
acts, the supreme state bodies of the Republic of Crimea do not 
have the right to decide issues that lie exclusively within the 
competence of Ukraine's state bodies, and the volume of the 
powers of the Republic of Crimea cannot be changed without the 
permission of the Ukrainian Supreme Council. 
  The resolution, which has been signed by Aleksandr Moroz, 
head of the Ukrainian parliament, will be deemed invalid if the 
Crimean Supreme Council abolishes the law on the reinstatement 
of the constitutional foundation of the statehood of the 
Republic of Crimea.

  [Text] The Crimean legislature is ready to hold talks with 
Ukraine's parliament, but it will not accept conditions set by 
Kiev, the head of the Russia parliamentary faction, Sergey 
Nikulin, who leads the parliamentary commission on legislation, 
law, order and national development, told Interfax-Ukraina on 
Saturday [21 May]. 
  A Crimean parliamentary delegation led by the Speaker, 
Sergey 
Tsekov, is expected to meet with a Ukrainian parliamentary 
delegation in Kiev on Tuesday. 
  As we already reported, on Friday Ukraine's parliament urged 
the Crimean parliament to cancel its Thursday's resolution 
issued to revert to the Crimean Constitution adopted on 6 May 
1992. 
  Besides, Ukraine's parliament suspended the bill adopted to 
restore the Crimean Constitution of 6 May 1992. Under that 
Constitution all relations between the Crimea and Ukraine are 
built on the basis of agreement, and the people of the Crimea 
are entitled to "dual citizenship." 
  Ukraine's parliament adopted a resolution suggesting that 
the 
Crimean parliament should annul its decision within 10 days.

  [Text] Kiev, 21 May -- "The leadership of Ukraine has 
taken a series of measures aimed at destroying the statehood of 
the Republic of Crimea. It threatens to use force, including 
military force," says an appeal of the Supreme Council of the 
Republic of Crimea, which was adopted today. It is addressed to 
the United Nations, the UN Security Council, the Conference for 
Security and Cooperation in Europe, the president of the Russian 
Federation, the Russian Federal Assembly, and the people of 
Ukraine. 
  The document says, among other things, that "the Crimean 
Supreme Council adopted the law on restoring the constitutional 
foundations of the statehood of the Republic of Crimea on the 
basis of a poll taken among the Republic's citizens. This means 
that from now on the authority in economy, education, culture, 
and local self-government will be executed entirely by the 
people of Crimea." 
  The Crimean parliamentarians think that "not a single item 
in 
the Constitution of the Crimean Republic infringes upon the 
territorial integrity of the Ukraine, nor does it lead to any 
revision of the existing state border. Chapter 3, Article 9 of 
the Constitution states: "The Crimean Republic forms part of 
Ukrainian and determines its relations with that state on the 
basis of a treaty and agreements." The Crimean Supreme Council 
confirms its adherence to the principles enshrined in the 
Helsinki Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation 
in Europe. 
  The Crimean Supreme Council expressed the hope that the 
international community will not permit lawless acts on the part 
of Ukraine's organs of state power nor any violation of the 
rights and freedoms proclaimed by the "Universal Declaration of 
the Rights of Man."

  [Text] We have already talked about the Crimean situation a 
few times today and now we have our correspondent in Simferopol 
Vladimir Plotnikov on the line to the Mayak studio. Hello, 
Vladimir, we're listening to you. 
  [Plotnikov] Good afternoon. There really is a lot to say on 
the subject of Crimea, and Sergey Tsekov, chairman of the 
Crimean Supreme Soviet, has just finished a news conference in 
Simferopol. I'm sure that you'll get more information about that 
later, but I'll tell you now what the gist of it was. 
  Well, first of all, he was saying that the situation is 
tense; listeners already will know that, though media reports 
are very contradictory. According to Sergey Tsekov himself, the 
situation is tense but under control. There are no public 
disorders whatsoever, and the resorts are functioning normally. 
The weather's great, too. 
  The session of Crimea's Supreme Soviet went on today. One 
way or another, the deputies touched on future relations between 
Simferopol and Kiev and, as Sergey Tsekov said, they will 
develop on the basis of talks and, first off, on the basis of 
legality. A delegation of the Crimean Supreme Soviet has been 
formed for talks on the problems in Crimeo-Ukrainian relations. 
But it would be best if such a meeting was held in Crimea. 
That would enable the situation to be examined more deeply on 
the spot. 
  The main point at the talks will be the economic question. A 
telephone conversation has taken place between the presidents of 
Ukraine and Crimea, but Sergey Tsekov was unable to reveal any 
of its contents. The Crimean Supreme Soviet has still to 
receive any signals from Moscow either on the reaction of the 
Russian State Duma to Crimean events. 
  The Ukrainian defense and interior ministries are continuing 
to shuffle leading officials and deploy troops in Crimea without 
consultaion with the leadership of the autonomous republic. 
They are thus ignoring the law on delegation of 
responsibilities between Crimea and Ukraine. 
  A picket in support of the Crimean president and Supreme 
Soviet and the 6 May constitution is still outside the Crimean 
Supreme Soviet building, but there are less people on the square 
now and the cossacks have disappeared. On the whole, a pause 
has settled over the war of decrees and in the relations between 
Crimea and Ukraine. Clearly, a sort of status quo is emerging 
before the start of the talks. The talks may be held in about 
10 days' time.

  [Text] Ukraine's Supreme Council has adopted a resolution 
on halting the operation of the law of the Republic of Crimea on 
renewing the constitutional basis of the Republic of Crimea's 
statehood: 
  On 20 May 1994, the Republic of Crimea's Supreme Council 
adopted a law on renewing the constitutional basis of the 
Republic of Crimea's statehood, which renews clauses of the 
Republic of Crimea's Constitution in its 6 May 1992 form. These 
clauses in the Constitution were changed in September 1992 by 
the Republic of Crimea's Supreme Council itself in accordance 
with the law of Ukraine on the delimitation of powers between 
the state authority bodies of Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea. 
  Above all, it is about establishing relations between the 
Crimea and Ukraine on the basis of treaties and agreements and 
about introducing Crimean citizenship. This is a step toward 
Crimea leaving the composition of Ukraine, which violates the 
territorial integrity of Ukraine and its state sovereignty, and 
runs counter to the universally recognized principles of 
international law. 
  In accordance with Article 75 of Ukraine's Constitution, the 
Crimean Autonomous Republic is a constituent part of Ukraine and 
can resolve independently only those issues attributed to its 
authority. The competence of state authority bodies of the 
Republic of Crimea is determined by the above-mentioned law of 
Ukraine on the delimitation of powers between the state bodies 
of Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea. In accordance with 
Article 11 of this law, the higher bodies of state authority of 
the Republic of Crimea do not have the right to resolve issues 
belonging to the exclusive authority of the state bodies of 
Ukraine. The extent of the powers of the Republic of Crimea, in 
accordance with Ukraine's legislation, cannot be changed by the 
Republic of Crimea without the consent of Ukraine's Supreme 
Council. 
  Taking account of the above, and with the aim of protecting 
state sovereignty and ensuring the supremacy of the laws of 
Ukraine on all of its territory, and in accordance with Point 31 
of Article 97 of the Constitution of Ukraine, Ukraine's Supreme 
Council resolves: 
  1. To halt the operation of the law of the Republic of 
Crimea 
of 20 May 1994 on renewing the constitutional basis of the 
Republic of Crimea's statehood as such that runs counters to the 
Declaration on Ukraine's State Sovereignty, the demands of 
Articles 31, 70, 75, and 77 of the Constitution of Ukraine, and 
the laws of Ukraine on the delimitation of powers between the 
state authority bodies of Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea and 
on citizenship of Ukraine; 
  2. To propose that the Republic of Crimea's Supreme Council 
brings the Republic of Crimea's Constitution into line with the 
Constitution of Ukraine and the laws of Ukraine on the 
delimitation of powers between the bodies of state authority of 
Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea within 10 days. 
  3. That this resolution loses its validity from the moment 
when the Supreme Council of the Republic of Crimea revokes the 
law on renewing the constitutional basis of the Republic of 
Crimea's statehood. 
  You have been listening to Ukraine's Supreme Council 
resolution on halting the operation of the law of the Republic 
of Crimea on renewing the constitutional basis of the Republic 
of Crimea's statehood.

  [Text] Kiev, 21 May (AFP) -- Ukraine said Saturday [21 May] 
it would not use force against Crimea unless separatists there 
resort to armed provocation, after telling the UN and NATO that 
moves by the republic threaten regional peace and stability. 
  "We will abstain from using force, unless of course another 
party launches armed provocations," Ukrainian Foreign Minister 
Anatoliy Zlenko told AFP. 
  On Friday Crimean deputies voted to restore a 1992 
constitution, a move tantamount to a declaration of independence. 
  Ukrainian lawmakers retaliated late Friday, giving the 
pro-Russian Crimean assembly 10 days to reverse its decision and 
"conform with the laws and constitution of Ukraine." 
  "I think we will have enough strength, will and 
self-restraint to find a settlement" to the crisis, Zlenko told 
AFP. 
  "We will take all the measures based on international law to 
assure the territorial integrity of the state," he added.

  [Text] On Saturday [21 May] the Crimean parliament voted to 
suspend the resolution of the Ukrainian parliament dated 20 May, 
which in turn, suspended the law "On the restoration of the 
Constitution in the Republic of Crimea." 
  As it was reported earlier, on Friday the Ukrainian 
parliament suspended the Crimean law "On the restoration of the 
Constitution in the Republic of Crimea" and offered the Crimean 
parliament to put its legislation in line with the Ukrainian 
Constitution within 10 days. 
  Leader of the Russia faction, chairman of the Crimean 
parliamentary commission on legislation, law and state Sergey 
Nikulin told INTERFAX-Ukraine that the parliament was not going 
to cancel its law "On the restoration of the Constitution in the 
Republic of Crimea." At the same time, he said: "We are ready 
for dialogue with the Ukrainian parliament." 
  On Saturday the Crimean lawmakers issued an address to the 
UN 
Security Council and the CSCE, the president and the Federal 
Assembly of the Russian Federation, the people of Ukraine. The 
address confirms that "not a single article of the Crimean 
Constitution violates the territorial integrity of Ukraine or 
leads to the review of the current state border." 
  The address notes that "Ukrainian mass media backed by 
Ukrainian officials launched a campaign aimed at discrediting 
the constitutional bodies of Crimea, disinforming the 
international community." The Crimean parliament points out 
that the law "On the restoration of the Constitution in the 
Republic of Crimea" aims to provide the Crimean people with 
broad powers in the spheres of economy, education, and culture." 
  The Crimean parliament expressed hope that the international 
community would prevent the Ukrainian state power bodies from 
committing illegal actions.

  [Text] Simferopol, 21 May -- Serhiy Tsekov, chairman of the 
Supreme Council of Crimea, has held a news conference at which 
he pointed out that the Republic of Crimea is not going to 
secede from Ukraine, and its decision is dictated not only by 
political but, first and foremost, by economic reasons. Mr. 
Tsekov pointed out that there is an agreement to hold 
negotiations on this issue between the parliaments of Ukraine 
and Crimea; according to him, a Ukrainian delegation, headed by 
Boris Oliynyk, will probably arrive in Simferopol. Otherwise, 
the Crimean delegation, headed by Serhiy Tsekov, would go to 
Kiev. 
  Concerning the signing of certain documents by the executive 
authorities of Crimea with the leadership of Nagorno-Karabakh, 
the chairman of the Crimean parliament pointed out that he sees 
nothing wrong in the fact that some friendly documents have been 
signed between the two states. Besides, the documents between 
the regions, according to Mr. Tsekov, are to be ratified by the 
Supreme Council of Crimea.

  [Text] "During the talks with the Ukrainian leadership we 
want to prove that we do not violate the Ukrainian 
constitution," leader of the Russia bloc faction in the Crimean 
parliament, Chairman of the Commission on State, Legislation and 
Law Sergey Nikulin told INTERFAX-Ukraine on Sunday [22 May]. 
  Nikulin is a member of the Crimean parliamentary delegation 
which is expected to meet the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet 
delegation in Kiev on Tuesday in order to discuss the present 
situation. 
  "I do not think that the talks can fail. We have not only 
political goals. We want the Ukrainian people to see what in 
fact is happening in Crimea," Nikulin pointed out. 
  He repeated that the Crimean parliament would not annul its 
law on restoration of the constitutional basis of the Crimean 
statehood adopted on 20 May 1994. 
  This law by the Crimean parliament re-established the 
Crimean 
Constitution of 6 May 1992. In accordance with this version of 
the Constitution, relations between Ukraine and Crimea must be 
based on treaties and agreements and Crimean inhabitants have 
the right for dual citizenship. 
  Nikulin stressed that the Russia bloc stood for a union on 
the treaty basis both with Ukraine and Russia. "We have never 
wanted to withdraw Crimea from Ukraine. I hope this issue will 
not be raised," he added. 
  However, he emphasized that the issue on a new state status 
of Crimea could be considered if Ukraine made life of Crimeans 
within the composition of Ukraine unbearable. 
  On possible reunification of Crimea with Russia, Nikulin 
said 
there was no such purpose as a state reunification. However, he 
admitted that certain Crimean parliamentarians spoke in favor of 
this. He said that the Crimean parliament would be satisfied 
with the maximum of economic and cultural rights within the 
composition of Ukraine. 
  Nikulin confirmed that the Crimean parliament had no claims 
to the Ukrainian troops on Crimean territory since the troops 
had the right to be stationed in Crimea. He added that certain 
statements on the part of some Crimean politicians were just 
their point of view.

  [Text] "The situation in Crimea is normal," Crimean 
Interior Minister Valeriy Kuznetsov told INTERFAX on Sunday [22 
May]. "The ministry staff are working according to plan. 
Officers on duty keep working, while the others are having a 
rest," he said. 
  To quote Kuznetsov, the Crimean interior ministry units were 
not put into a state of combat readiness on Saturday. 
  "Only individual precaution measures were taken," said 
Kuznetsov. 
  He said that on Saturday evening, he was informed that the 
Ukrainian national guards had planned to seize the Crimean TV, 
radio and communication centers, and the buildings of the 
parliament, Cabinet and bank. "A group of Crimean deputies, who 
visited a unit of the Ukrainian national guard, could see that 
the national guards were ready and wanted to do so. Moreover, 
national guards themselves told the deputies that such a task 
had been assigned to them," said Kuznetsov. 
  He also announced that on Sunday this information was 
partially confirmed by Ukraine's First Deputy Interior Minister 
Valentin Nedrigailo, who admitted that at his request the task 
of establishing control over the Crimean TV center had been 
assigned to the national guards. "The TV center and the 
parliament building are always guarded by the police," said 
Kuznetsov. 
  He pointed out that no weapons had been given either to the 
police or to the special unit Berkut, because both of them were 
always armed. Berkut units daily patrol the streets. On Sunday 
they detained a 29-men strong grouping. On Saturday Berkut 
units were asked to find out what was happening near the 
parliament building, so they came to the place, assessed the 
situation and went away, he said. 
  Kuznetsov admitted that he had issued the order to enhance 
vigilance and that he had put only part of the personnel into a 
state of alert. "Now everything has got back to the initial 
situation. We are working tranquilly and are not planning any 
moves," he said. 
  To quote Kuznetsov, Crimea remains part of Ukraine. "If Kiev 
does not explode the situation, everything will go tranquily," 
he said. 
  He said that the hysterical campaign (over the Crimean 
parliament's decision to restore the constitution of 1992 -- 
INTERFAX) had been launched by the forces which intended to foil 
presidential elections scheduled for 26 June, not by the whole 
of Ukraine. 
  He pointed out that he meant President Kravchuk in the first 
place. [sentence as received] He noted, however, that other 
forces' attitude to the Crimea was "not quite loyal," either. 
  He believes that Crimea's position in relation to Kiev is 
similar to the position of Tatarstan in relation to Russia prior 
to the conclusion of the bilateral agreement. "Who has suffered 
from the agreement signed by Kazan and Moscow? The same might 
be said about Crimea," said Kuznetsov. 
  Kiev is absolutely unpredictable, he went on to say. "But if 
the Kiev politicians show common sense, everything will be 
normal: there are no reasons for fanning tensions. All problems 
can be solved at a negotiating table," he said. 
  He expressed hope that the talks between the Russian and 
Ukrainian prime ministers, to be held in Moscow on Monday, would 
be a success. "I think this meeting will confirm once again 
that all disputable issues must be tackled through talks. No 
one has the right to issue the order to use force," he said. 
  He pointed out that the political events had not had any 
impact on the crime situation in Crimea. 
  He acknowledged, however, that at this dramatic moment the 
interior ministry personnel were alarmed. 
  He said that the people of Crimea had the right to a choice 
within the limits not affecting the territorial integrity of 
Ukraine. "Nothing has changed. The constitution has been 
restored, but Crimea has not drifted away from Ukraine. One 
must simply give Crimea economic independence, so we could take 
care of our people on our own," said Kuznetsov.

  [Text] Today, the board of Ukraine's Internal Affairs 
Ministry held an extended meeting. It examined the situation in 
the Republic of Crimea and adopted an appeal to the Supreme 
Council and president of the Crimean Republic, as well as the 
board's appeal to the interior bodies' personnel. It says, in 
particular, that a dangerous precedent was set for ignoring the 
laws of the Ukrainian state, which is having a negative effect 
on the functioning of interior bodies in Crimea and, first of 
all, the state of law and order. An explosive situation is 
being provoked and mounted, suspicion and mistrust for the 
Ukrainian authorities is being planted. 
  The board of Ukraine's Internal Affairs Ministry is placing 
all responsibility for the current developments in Crimea and 
the possible unforseen consequences on Mr. Valeriy Kuznetsov, 
appointed to the abolished post of the Crimean internal affairs 
minister, and the forces that had created conditions for this. 
  Appealing to the Supreme Council and president of the 
Republic of Crimea, the board of Ukraine's Internal Affairs 
Ministry is counting on them to exercise foresight, wisdom, and 
consideration in their decisions concerning issues that relate 
to the functioning of such an important armed formation as 
interior bodies. The appeal also contains an expression of 
confidence that the Crimean leadership will revise their earlier 
decisions.
