<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Vladimir Akimov and Amangeldiy </F>
Akhmetalimov] 
  [Text] Alma Ata [Almaty] May 25 TASS -- "The Euro-Asian 
union may spring up from the mutual integrational urge of the 
CIS countries. The restoration of the former union or the 
establishment of some sort of a confederation is out of the 
question. The new union must be a logical culmination of the 
basically new community of states, former members of the USSR, 
which now make up the Commonwealth of Independent States, 
provided they are really interested in the establishment of 
deeper and more effective multilateral relations," press 
secretary of the Kazakh president Nurlan Danenov told the 
newspaper "KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA". 
  Interviewed by ITAR-TASS, he said that he was compelled to 
make this statement due to recent speculations around 
Nazarbayev's Euro- Asian union idea. In his opinion, the Kazakh 
president's statement on the Euro-Asian union, made during his 
official visit to the Russian Federation last March, was now 
being used for unseemly political purposes. Some analysts are 
trying to use the differing approaches of some CIS leaders to 
Nazarbayev's proposal in order to drive a sort of wedge between 
the commonwealth members. 
  The press secretary expressed the conviction that the CIS 
potential was still not exhausted. "The commonwealth has already 
played and continues to play an important role in the legal 
corroboration of inter-state relations within it, contributing 
to the civilised `divorcement'of the republics after the 
collapse of the Soviet empire. However, the pace of the 
intergrational processes, mildly speaking, could have been much 
faster. Most telling is the absence of structures that would 
ensure the fulfilment of the already concluded agreements. 
Dissatisfaction with this state of affairs was behind the 
Euro-Asian union idea," Danenov noted. 
  As to press allegations that "President Nazarbayev had 
allegedly dropped the Euro-Asian union idea, well, they can 
evoke nothing but surprise. The idea was not officially raised 
anywhere. There was nothing but a call to exchange views on the 
possibility of finding ways for promoting constructive 
cooperation with CIS countries that are particularly important 
for Kazakhstan and which experience the same need for our 
republic. Hence, the Euro-Asian union subject can in no way be 
officially excluded from further discussion," Danenov explained.

<F P=106> [Nataliya Ablova article: "If I were Nursultan.... Having </F>
Swallowed Sovereignty, It Seems the Central Asian Republics Do 
Not Wish To Set Up a Eurasian Union"] 
  [Text] A meeting between [Kyrgyzstan President] Akayev, 
[Uzbekistan President] Karimov, and [Kazakhstan President] 
Nazarbayev at the beginning of May on the shores of Lake 
Issyk-Kul created much fuss and bother in the CIS, particularly 
in Russia. Moscow journalists tried to call their colleagues in 
Bishkek, but the latter had no idea themselves about what was 
happening in Cholpon-Ata -- the meeting was closed to 
journalists. 
  Recently a number of Kirghiz [Kyrgyz] politicians have 
started thinking about the problem of reestablishing the former 
Union, stipulating that this new union will be quite a different 
sort of association. Unfortunately there cannot be another 
kind: It is either one or the other. Either we go back to the 
old unitary state, and in doing so shed the blood of all those 
who disagree with this idea. Or we must independently swallow 
the troubles and savor the joys of our new existence. The 
prospect of a Eurasian confederative state is still a long way 
off and will only be realized given very intelligent leaders and 
very patient peoples. And it must be agreed that this prospect 
is more of a wish than a possibility. 
  Calls by various Kirghiz parliamentarians, and also by the 
leaders of the newly fledged parties, to at least begin this 
process by uniting the Central Asian states therefore sound 
extremely naive. Even these countries which are so close in 
ethnocultural and geographical terms have in the space of under 
three years of independence had enough time to go their separate 
ways. Let us ask ourselves whether the peoples and rulers of 
the Central Asian states want to establish a confederation with 
common borders and supranational organs of government and 
justice, and let us try to answer this question honestly. 
  The situation is clearest of all in Turkmenia. 
What the people of this republic think is "a complete and utter 
mystery." In conditions of totalitarian censorship and the 
suppression of the slightest political activity, it is 
impossible to say anything about the expression of the popular 
will. For the time being the Turkmenbashi [President Niyazov] 
speaks for the people, and he is unequivocally opposed to 
uniting with anyone in the solar system. During a recent CSCE 
seminar a certain person "close to the emperor" let it be known 
openly that the commanding elite of Turkmenia had made a simple 
calculation: The money earned by selling off oil and gas would 
suffice until 2030. It would then be clear whether a market 
economy should be introduced and whether or not Turkmenia should 
unite with anyone. 
  Everything is also clear as far as Tajikistan is 
concerned. Nobody in their right mind would take steps to 
unite with a state where a civil war is far from over. Clan 
feuds, the onslaughts of the intransigent opposition, refugees, 
Afghan infiltration.... Outsiders want to put an impenetrable 
wall between themselves and all these problems, they are in no 
mood for unification! 
  Three countries remain: Kazakhstan, Kirghizia, and 
Uzbekistan. It was the presidents of these three states who 
attended the get-together at Issyk-Kul. 
  Kazakhstan. Everyone knows that Nursultan 
Nazarbayev is a convinced supporter of any form of unification 
with former Union states. But he is more interested -- indeed 
principally so -- in union with Russia. Such an association 
would resolve some of Kazakhstan's economic problems. It would 
take the heat out of the problem of the northern oblasts, where 
the population is primarily Russian. This is an unbearable 
burden, despite the shared expenditure on maintaining Baykonur 
and reprofiling the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site, a burden 
which is pressuring the Kazakhstani president and pushing him 
toward integration. However, Russia (or its present government, 
to be more precise) is not desperate to unite with Kazakhstan or 
with Central Asia as a whole. We will not dwell on Russia's 
reasons, but the Kazakhstani population is by no means entirely 
on its leader's side. The ruling elite has already had time to 
savor the sweet taste of independence, and is not keen to see 
the status quo changed just like that. 
  Uzbekistan. Of all Kirghizia's closest 
neighbors, this is the most complex partner Karimov 
undoubtedly dreams of leading the region. He is extremely 
irritated both by the popularity of the pragmatic Nazarbayev and 
by the favors being shown by the West to Askar Akayev, "pupil 
No. 1" in the school of democracy; Karimov currently realizes 
that there is nothing he can do to oppose the strength and 
prestige enjoyed by the Kazakhstani leader, whereas he is 
perfectly well aware of Kirghizia's weak points: The Uzbek 
population in the south of the republic, which sets its watches 
to Tashkent time, and Kirghizia's dependence on deliveries of 
Uzbek energy sources. Like the wise politician he is, the Uzbek 
president is skillfully playing his trump cards in his contacts 
with Kirghizia, managing without too much difficulty to secure 
its silence and submission. But fear is not a basis for 
possible unification. 
  So what about Kirghizia? Does it want a union of 
Central Asian states? Kirghizia needs transparent borders, 
freedom of trade, a common economic area, and stability. And no 
more. It is frightening even to think about the establishment 
of common supranational structures in the elective, executive, 
and judicial branches.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, May 26 (ITAR-TASS) -- The ROSSIISKIE VESTI 
newspaper singles out a report on the recent decrees by 
President Boris Yeltsin, repealing quotas and licences on 
exported goods and services. The newspaper notes that all firms 
and organisations operating on world markets will work on equal 
terms. 
  Efficiency of their deals will be determined not by quotas 
set by beaurocrats but by demand and supply. 
  The newspaper runs a commentary on whether Russia joins 
NATO's "Partnership for Peace" and on what conditions. Writing 
about the discussion of this issue in Brussels where Russian 
Defence Minister Pavel Grachev is now on a visit, ROSSIISKIE 
VESTI calls as justified a thesis that cooperation with 
industrialised nations is a priority question for Russia. 
  "If we are invited to military cooperation," the newspaper 
notes, "may be it would be good to link this issue with opening 
European markets for Russian goods." 
  The NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper carries an interview with 
Director of the Federal Counterintelligence Service Sergey 
Stepashin, which he gave on the eve of a meeting between Boris 
Yeltsin and the service's leadership (to be held on Thursday). 
  Stepashin criticises "some newspapers, radio stations and TV 
companies" which have turned, in actual fact, into ordinary 
commercial firms. He calls on them to reject "good profits" if 
information suggested to them "smacks of bad taste or is 
supplied by shady people". 
  Speaking of the "classic" presence of Western secret 
services 
in Russia, Stepashin expresses confidence that nobody plans to 
destroy Russia. However, "many do not want this huge state, 
when it takes to its feet, to become a rising political and 
economic competitor to Western countries". 
  Writing about the Russian-Ukrainian Government talks on the 
Black Sea Fleet in Moscow, the same newspaper singles out a 
desire of the sides "not to declare simply agreement in the 
spirit of contacts between the presidents but to come to a real 
agreement". 
  This means, the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA continues, that 
"politicians in Kiev start understanding the danger of 
protracting the fleet's crisis, since the fleet's problem, 
coupled with the political crisis in the Crimea as well as 
relations between Kiev and Simferopol, can turn into a dangerous 
detonator for aggravating the situation". 
  Noting that the talks on the Black Sea Fleet are not over, 
the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper points to the need for greater 
caution in forecasting their results, since experience shows 
that the sides repeatedly came to an understanding on the Black 
Sea Fleet, which would be later interpreted in their own 
individual ways. 
  "Let us hope that this will not be the case with the present 
talks," the daily says. 
  The TRUD newspaper writes about growing unemployment in the 
Russian Federation. Referring to data from the Russian Labour 
Ministry, the newspaper notes that "real joblessness is assessed 
between two and six million people now". 
  In this connection, the daily prints readers' letters 
demonstrating how national industry "dies away". One of them 
reads: Russia's only factory producing trolleybuses in the city 
of Engels works part-time. 
  All grounds around the factory are packed with ready-made 
machines, since there are no purchasers. This is despite the 
fact that Russian cities are in dire need of new trolleybuses. 
  This situation has developed due to the fact that the 
government stopped subsidies to public transport, and local 
authorities have no funds to replace old machines. 
  The PRAVDA newspaper censures a television report on 
Wednesday that there is only one million jobless people in 
Russia. "The concealment of real data on unemployment," the 
newspaper notes, "can aggravate a social eruption brewing in 
Russia." 
  Referring to information of the international labour 
organisation, PRAVDA writes that there are some seven million 
jobless in Russia, and the figure will rise to ten million by 
next december. 
  The KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper writes about fires 
inflicting huge material damage on the country. According to 
the daily, "the quantity of damaged areas rose by 50 per cent 
last year as against the previous figure. 
  Fires afflicted 15 million hectares in the forest and 
non-forest zones, destroying timber and other materials worth 
110 billion roubles. Moreover, fire-fighting operations 
resulted in a damage worth 200 billion roubles. 
  The St. Petersburg-based NEVSKOYE VREMYA newspaper informs 
its readers of a scandal which erupted at the end of a 
conference at the Svetlana Joint Stock Society, one of the 
largest in the city. 
  The conference which discussed the results of a labour 
contract between the local and the management over the past 
year, lasted three days and ended in a no-confidence vote in the 
factory's managing director Vladimir Bashkatov who was accused 
of "red-tape and ducking talks with the trade union". 
  If the manager is not sacked, it was announced that some 
workers will go on a hunger strike right at workshops.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Aleksandr Mineyev and Vladimir </F>
Smelov] 
  [Text] Brussels May 25 TASS -- Russian Defence Minister 
Pavel Grachev told ITAR-TASS upon completion of his meeting with 
the U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry that Perry's reaction 
to the Russian concept of expanded cooperation with NATO was 
"even". 
  "Apparently, this is connected with the fact that the U.S. 
side is not aware yet about main parameters of our proposals to 
this effect which will be submitted to the acting U.N. secretary 
general on Wednesday," Grachev said 
  During Grachev's talks with Perry which continued over an 
hour the sides discussed problems of bilateral cooperation, 
Grachev said. "Our cooperation is growing stronger day-by-day 
and we are reaching a greater degree of mutual understanding," 
Grachev said. 
  Grachev felt at ease in the U.N. Headquarters. He arrived 
twenty minutes ahead of schedule, wearing an elegant dark-blue 
suit, while Perry was about six minutes late. However, this did 
not affect the constructive atmosphere of the talks and was 
fully compensated by a continuous discussion. 
  Grachev confirmed that Russia makes no conditions concerning 
its participation in the Partnership for Peace programme. "We 
have a broader vision of cooperation and interaction with NATO 
than other countries. We suggest such directions for 
partnership which are characteristic only of Russia and some 
other NATO member-states. For instance, this concerns nuclear 
weapons and nuclear control, non-proliferation, reduction and 
elimination of nuclear arsenals and the transfer of such weapons 
along the Russian territory," Grachev said. 
  Parameters for interaction with NATO suggested by Russia 
today will be used as a basis for a document suggested to be 
prepared. The document can be drawn either in the form of a 
protocol of intentions, an agreement or a programme, which does 
not matter," Grachev said. " The most important thing is that 
apart from other relations of partnership, suggested to all 
countries, Russia offers additional proposals which are not 
characteristic of other states. Russia does not intend to impose 
anything on anyone and look for its own "warm place" in the 
system of partnership, Grachev said. 
  Perry described Grachev's speech outlining the new Russian 
military doctrine as a historic event of great importance. He 
pointed out that the United States welcomed Russia's readiness 
to join the Partnership for Peace programme without amy 
preliminary conditions. He pointed out that during the talks 
the two sides discussed problems pertaining to holding joint 
military exercises on the Russian territory. Considerable 
attention was paid to cooperation in the field of nuclear 
non-proliferation, and in particular, to North Korea's nuclear 
problem and bilateral efforts made by the Russian Federation and 
the United States for the Bosnian settlement. 
  After the fifth consecutive meeting between the Russian and 
the U.S. ministers the two sides are working in the atmosphere 
of more close contacts, resolving problems of ensuring security 
in different regions of the world, the U.S. defense secretary 
said.

  [Text] Brussels May 25 TASS -- Russian Defence Minister 
Pavel Grachev met with British Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind 
at the NATO headquarters in Brussels on Wednesday to discuss 
Russia's concept of partnership with NATO. 
  In an interview with ITAR-TASS, Grachev said that European 
security is not only NATO's prerogative. Security should be 
ensured by joint effort of all political and military 
structures, he added. 
  Speaking about bilateral cooperation, Grachev noted that an 
agreement has been reached to send to Britain about 60 junior 
Russian officers for military training. 
  Additionally, working groups will be set up this year to 
study prospects for holding joint Russian-British military 
manoeuvres next year. 
  Rifkind expressed satisfaction with the fact that Russia has 
confirmed its intention to join the Partnership for Peace 
programme. 
  In his address to the NATO leaders earlier today Grachev 
said 
that Russia is ready to develop broad and constructive 
cooperation with NATO and called for devising an "active 
mechanism" of bilateral consultations on all problems concerning 
European and global security. 
  Grachev said that "Russia is ready to develop genuine and 
all 
embracing strategic cooperation with NATO. NATO's partnership 
for peace programme should play a role in this process." 
  However, he stressed that the programme "is not a 
comprehensive answer to the realities of the new epoch" and is 
only the first step towards building a new strategic alliance in 
the name of peace and security. 
  Russia is interested in broader relations with NATO to 
correspond its (Russia's) weight and position in the system of 
international relations, Grachev said. He emphasised that 
Russia does not claim any privileges, but is seeking to develop 
and expand the very concept of partnership between the East and 
West. 
  He said Russia is also ready to develop cooperation with 
NATO 
in coordination of military policies, peace-keeping operations, 
military planning and training, as well as disarmament, arms 
control, conversion, non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and 
nature protection.

  [Text] Moscow, 25 May -- The numerous alarming reports 
coming in from the Crimea are creating an agitated mood among 
the population of the Crimea itself, as well as that of Ukraine 
and Russia. 
  Meanwhile, the summer vacation period is approaching. The 
Crimea is known to be a holiday resort traditionally popular 
with the residents of Russia, Ukraine, and other CIS states. If 
a "frontline" atmosphere is artificially created, hundreds of 
thousands of people may succumb to groundless fear and will thus 
be left without a place to spend their vacation in. 
  Russian President Boris Yeltsin has instructed his press 
service to make it clear to the public that the situation in the 
Crimea is giving no cause for concern. The calm atmosphere and 
the entire infrastructure required for normal peaceful rest are 
being maintained in the Crimea. The president's press service 
gave this message to the ITAR-TASS agency.

  [Text] The State Duma (the lower house of Russian 
parliament) has called both on Kiev and Simferopol for "a show 
of restraint and wisdom and renunciation of hasty or emotional 
actions". "We are aware of how hopeless and fatal can be any 
attempt to try to resolve by force controversial issues relating 
to a popular drive for self- determination", its appeal adopted 
late on Wednesday says. This was approved without discussion on 
Speaker of Parliament Ivan Rybkin's proposal. 
  The Duma speaks of "perceiving with hope a report on the 
first moves" for dialogue and consensus that Ukrainian and 
Crimean deputies made during talks in Kiev. 
  The Russian deputies expect their counterparts on both sides 
not to allow irresponsible politicians to endanger public peace 
and security because of their one-off considerations. 
  For its part, the Duma is prepared "with the delicate 
situation being taken into account" to do all it can to help 
towards the searches of compromise on the basis of the 
Russian-Ukrainian treaty of November 19, 1990. 
  "For the past two centuries, Crimea has served and we are 
sure, will continue to serve the interests of the fraternal 
nations of Ukraine and Russia", the appeal says.

  [Text] Today the talks between the Russian and Ukrainian 
governmental delegations on division of the Black Sea Fleet and 
the basing of Russian military ships in Crimea were continued in 
Moscow at the level of experts. 
  Russian experts are led by Russian Foreign Ministry Envoy, 
Chief Russian Negotiator at the talks with Ukraine Yuriy 
Dubinin. Ukrainian experts are headed by Vice Premier Valeriy 
Shmarov. 
  Interfax learned that behind the closed doors the experts 
were working on the second version of the draft 
inter-governmental agreement on the first stage of settlement of 
the Black Sea Fleet issues put forward by the Russian party. 
The first version has been rejected due to disagreement on some 
of its provisions. 
  Sources in the Russian delegation told Interfax that Moscow 
wanted to reveal the issues on which there existed principal 
discord which demanded a political decision by the two 
countries' supreme leaders. The main problem concerns the 
basing of Russian and Ukrainian military ships. Moscow wants 
Sevastopol to be the main base of the Russian Navy in Crimea. 
Russia proposed that the Ukrainian navy be based in Balaklava 
and Donuzlava. Kiev wants a part of the Ukrainian Navy's ships 
and headquarters to be based in Sevastopol as well. 
  Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Tarasyuk told 
Interfax that last night the Ukrainian experts had worked on the 
draft document. He hoped that the parties would reach a final 
agreement on Wednesday. 
  Interfax learned that on Wednesday morning Russian Premier 
Viktor Chernomyrdin and acting Ukrainian Premier Yukhym 
Zvyahilskyy were working independently. 
  Zvyahilskyy had a telephone conversation with Ukrainian 
President Leonid Kravchuk in the morning in which he requested 
additional instructions on the talks with Moscow from the 
Ukrainian leader.

several 
members of the Russian government. He also received a group of 
Chinese journalists and commented on the purpose of his official

  [Text] Moscow May 25 TASS -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin and Acting Ukrainian Prime Minister Yefim 
Zvyagilsky, heads of the Russian and Ukrainian official 
delegations to the talks on the disputed Black Sea Fleet, will 
not sign an agreement on the division of the fleet today, a 
Russian Government official said. 
  The official said that the working groups will continue 
discussion for another 30 minutes and may adopt a joint 
communique. 
  Both delegations have contacted their presidents via the hot 
line several times and Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin met with his Ukrainian counterpart Yefim Zvyagilsky 
to discuss the issue. 
  The Ukrainian delegation agreed on Wednesday to return to 
one 
of the four variants of fleet division proposed by Russia and 
rejected by Ukraine earlier. 
  The stumbling block at the talks which have been underway 
for 
three days is the disagreement over the location of the 
Ukrainian and Russian navies.

  [Text] Moscow, 25 May -- The Ukrainian delegation at the 
Moscow intergovernmental talks on settling the problem of the 
Black Sea Fleet has agreed to continue work on one of the four 
Russian options for dividing the fleet which had earlier been 
rejected. As a reserve, the Russian party has one more option 
-- the "presidential" -- which is still to be revealed. 
  An ITAR-TASS correspondent has learned on the sidelines of 
the talks between the Russian and Ukrainian government heads 
that the attempt to harmonize the positions of the parties, 
which are at times mutually exclusive, is experiencing great 
difficulties. The talks process has already gone on for three 
days. The chief stumbling-block lies in the conflicting 
approaches of Moscow and Kiev to the principle of separate bases 
for the national fleets. 
  Both delegations have held repeated consultations with their 
presidents using the telephone "hot" line. Russian Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and acting Ukrainian Prime Minister 
Yefim Zvyagilskiy met several times today. However the main 
work is being done by the working group of experts. 
  It is expected that the sides will draw up the final text of 
the intergovernment agreement on beginning the division of the 
Black Sea Fleet. If this happens, the document will be signed 
by Viktor Chernomyrdin and Yefim Zvyagilskiy, the heads of the 
delegations of Russia and Ukraine at the talks. 
  One way or the other, the talks will end this evening, since 
Viktor Chernomyrdin leaves for an official visit to China after 
2000.

  [Text] Moscow May 25 TASS -- Acting Ukrainian Prime 
Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy intends to convey a message by the 
Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk to the Russian Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, pertaining to problems of the 
division of the Black Sea Fleet, ITAR-TASS learned from 
well-informed sources which follow the talks on the Black Sea 
Fleet between the Ukrainian and Russian leaders which are 
underway in Moscow. 
  The intregovernment talks which have been going on for three 
days have come to a deadlock. Today, the talks continue at the 
level of working groups of experts coordinating principles of 
the division of the Black Sea Fleet, its infrastructure and the 
separation of national naval bases. 
  Due to the fact that by 15:00 p.m. the sides had failed to 
reach a unanimous decision on a number of principally important 
problems, in particular, on naval bases in Sevastopol. [sentence 
as received] It was decided to finalize these problems at a 
separate meeting. "Nevertheless, we are prepared to continue 
talks as long as necessary," said leader of the Ukrainian 
delegation to the talks, Yukhym Zvyahilskyy. 
  Russian special envoy Yuriy Dubinin told journalists, 
commenting on the situation which developed at the talks, that 
there is a package of documents on the Black Sea Fleet signed by 
the Russian and Ukrainian presidents. In principle, the package 
contains all provisions which might decide the fate of the Black 
Sea Fleet. "We are attending to matters of translating adopted 
decisions into life," Dubinin said.

  It has just been reported that Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin met with acting Ukrainian Prime Minister Yukhym 
Zvyahilskyy in the framework of intergovernment talks on the 
Black Sea Fleet. Zvyahilskyy handed over a message from the 
Ukrainian president to the Russian prime minister. 
  Experts belonging to the delegation of the two countries 
continue work at problems which caused controversy at the talks, 
in particular, these problems pertain to the separation of 
national naval bases, ITAR-TASS learned from sources close to 
the talks. The Russian side acquainted its Ukrainian colleagues 
with four variants of the Black Sea Fleet division, including 
its ships, infrastructure and separate naval bases. It was 
reported that another reserve "presidential" variant was 
prepared.

  [Text] Russian and Ukrainian officials meeting in Moscow to 
discuss the future of the Black Sea Fleet have failed to reach 
any agreement after three days of intensive negotiations. 
  Speaking afterwards, Ukrainian Vice Premier Valeriy Shmarov 
said that although the two sides had toiled in two shifts for 
three days, there was still some work to be done because a 
sharing out of the Fleet demanded great attention. He said the 
two delegations were close to agreement on Wednesday, but had to 
break off the talks to "clarify some technicalities". 
  Shmarov said the two delegations were due to meet in about 
10 
or 12 days to sign an agreement on the first stage of sharing 
the Fleet. 
  Russia's envoy Yuriy Dubinin has pointed to the constructive 
atmosphere prevailing at the talks. He was confident that all 
of the remaining technicalities would have been resolved to 
enable the prime ministers on both sides to sign the final 
agreement in 10 or 12 days from now.

--from the "Novosti" newscast] 
  [Text] The military council of the Black Sea Fleet has 
expressed the firm conviction that the situation on the Crimean 
peninsula is becoming more stable and interference by power 
structures to overcome the political crisis is completely out of 
the question. 
  According to the estimates of experts from the Ministry of 
Defense of the Russian Federation, the deployment of military 
equipment by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine throughout the 
territory of the Crimea does no pose any danger from a military 
point of view. The Black Sea Fleet is capable of intercepting 
any provocations in the region. [video shows military experts

  [Text] [Tarasov] Four days of work out on the high seas 
have seen the ships of the Black Sea Fleet running through 
various combat training exercises to fend off underwater, 
surface, and air attacks from any likely adversary. The 
exercises were led by Vice Admiral Vitaliy Laryenov, first 
deputy commander of the Black Sea Fleet. In his judgment, the 
sailors coped well with the tasks set. But in general the 
results of the exercises would have been far better but for the 
regular disruption of drills and combat training due to 
shortages of financial and material resources. It is indicative 
that these latest exercise, completed without any hiccups, 
involved inducted personnel. As we know, nowadays warship crews 
are made up equally of citizens drafted both from Russia and 
Ukraine. Nevertheless, according to the sailors themselves, the 
long promised carve-up of the Black Sea Fleet is inevitable. So 
what is required now is the most vigorous action on the part of 
top Ukrainian and Russian officials.

Chernomyrdin who has arrived at the Beijing Airport, said in an

  The programme of the premier's four-day visit provides for 
talks with Chinese Premier Li Peng, a meeting with the Chinese

hope that the sides will take important decisions and sign 
documents during his visit, which will give a new impetus to the 
development of mutually advantageous bilateral relations. 
  "We should have good, normal and friendly relations with 
China," the premier stressed. 
  Apart from the official welcoming ceremony and the first 
talk 
with Li, the premier's programme for Thursday provides for a

  [Text] Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin stated that 
Russia intended to develop cooperation with China. He told 
journalists that Russia and China must have normal friendly and 
even fraternal relations. On the evening of May 25 Chernomyrdin 
will leave for China for a four-day working visit. 
  He announced that a large package of agreements was expected 
to be signed during his visit to Beijing. These agreements 
cover the following areas: the Russian-Chinese state border 
regime, cooperation in the sphere of environmental protection, 
sea navigation, water resources in the border regions close to 
the Amur and Ussuri rivers, cooperation in the sphere of 
agriculture, avoidance of dual taxation and cooperation in the 
sphere of communications. 
  Chernomyrdin emphasized that in 1993 the trade turnover 
between Russia and China had increased by 30 pct and amounted to 
about 8 billion U.S. dollars. He called this a success and 
added that during the previous years the trade turnover had been 
decreasing. This tendency was overcome only last year. 
  Chernomyrdin stressed the importance of friendly relations 
between the two countries since they had a common border of 
6,000 kilometers. He added that there was all necessary grounds 
for such relations. 
  Chernomyrdin suggested that China had not forgotten the 
contribution of the ex-Soviet Union to its development. He said 
that many graduates from Soviet higher educational 
establishments occupied high posts in China. Chernomyrdin 
pointed out that Russia was ready to receive Chinese students 
and to send Russian students to study in China. 
  He added that Russia could participate in modernization of 
Chinese enterprises built with the assistance from the USSR. 
Chernomyrdin remarked that the potential for development of 
bilateral relations was not being used efficiently enough. 
  Chernomyrdin suggested that there were big opportunities in 
the sphere of military-technical cooperation. He stressed that 
Russia had military-technical capabilities which must not be 
ruined even under the conversion program and which could work 
for export. 
  Chernomyrdin recognized that there existed problems in 
Russian- Chinese relations which must not be kept secret. A 
number of such problems were connected with cooperation in the 
neighboring regions. He was sure that there must be no 
barter-relations in trade. Chernomyrdin spoke in favor of a 
search for mechanisms for mutual account settling. 
  The Russian government's apparatus told INTERFAX that during 
his visit to China Chernomyrdin would be accompanied by Vice 
Premier Aleksandr Shokhin, Agriculture Minister Viktor 
Khlystun, Environment Minister Viktor Danilov-Danilyan and 
Transport Minister Vitaliy Yefimov.

  [Text] Tallinn, 25 May -- The withdrawal of troops from 
Estonia will free Russia's hands and it will be able to defend 
the rights of its fellow countrymen living in that republic more 
effectively. Thus spoke Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev 
at a meeting today with representatives of the Russian-speaking 
population. According to him, when the last soldier leaves, 
Moscow will be able to step up economic, political, and 
psychological pressure on the Tallinn authorities and thereby 
provide all the necessary guarantees for not only military 
pensioners but the non-native population of Estonia as a whole. 
  The minister told his fellow countrymen about the results of 
the meeting of the foreign ministers of the member-countries of 
the Council of the Baltic states which was held there. He said 
that the "problems of the Russian-speaking population and 
military pensioners raised by the Russian delegation found wide 
response among the other participants in the conference." The 
head of the foreign relations department of the Russian 
Federation told them about progress in the implementation of the 
state aid program to compatriots living abroad. He lamented 
that the 35 Russian departments participating in it "are not 
always free from the prejudices of the cost-led economy." It 
seems that the Foreign Ministry which he heads is no exception 
since the Russian Embassy in Tallinn still has no "secret" 
telephone link with Moscow. 
  In conclusion Kozyrev replied to numerous questions from 
those present and assured them that Russia "will not leave its 
fellow- countrymen abroad to the mercy of fate." 
  Also today, the foreign minister of the Russian Federation 
left Tallinn for Paris to attend an international conference 
which opens tomorrow on signing the pact on stability in Europe.

  [Text] The CIS peace-keeping forces, mostly composed of the 
Russian military contingent, are to be introduced into the zone 
of the Abkhazian conflict before June 10. The latest date for 
their deployment is June 15. The operation will be supervised 
by Deputy Commander of the Russian infantry troops, 
Lieutenant-General Aleksandr Sokolov. Interfax learned this 
from sources in one of the delegations currently negotiating in 
Moscow on deployment of the peace-keeping forces. The 
negotiations are expected to end today. 
  The Abkhazian delegation is headed by Abkhazian Defense 
Minister Sultan Sosnaliyev. Georgian Defense Minister Varden 
Nadibaidze leads the Georgian delegation. Russia acts as a 
mediator and is represented by high-ranking military officers. 
  In accordance with the agreements reached on May 14, the 
peace- keeping forces will be deployed in the security zone 
which will lay on the Inguri River after the Georgian and 
Abkhazian troops are withdrawn twelve kilometers from it. The 
size of the peace forces is expected to be about 2,500-3,000 
servicemen. 
  Interfax learned that a group of Russian officers may leave 
for Abkhazia on Thursday in order to define specific regions for 
deployment of the peace-keeping forces.

nuclear technology used by North Korea. Even if IAEA inspectors 
get access to the nuclear wastes and to the rods of the reactors 
supposedly used for the development of atomic weapons, even if 
they get a chance to analyse these materials, they will not be 
able to decide for sure whether Pyongyang is developing a 
nuclear bomb or not," the expert stated. In his opinion, this 
explains North Korea's stand on the inspection of its nuclear 
facilities. "If North Korea allows the IAEA to carry out a 
thorough inspection," he said, "this will only increase 
suspicions that Pyongyang is hiding something from the 
international community, because IAEA experts will not be able 
to arrive at any definite conclusion." 
  The Russian expert believes that suspicions about North 
Korea's efforts to develop nuclear weapons could be fully 
dispelled or, on the contrary, confirmed only if a 
representative international team of experts would carry out a 
lasting and broad examination of North Korean nuclear 
facilities, tantamount to permanent control over them, which 
should continue for several months. "The several days, during 
which a IAEA inspection will last, cannot resolve the problem of 
North Korea's nuclear programme," he noted. 
  Stressing that this was merely his personal opinion, the 
expert said that he doubted very much the existence of nuclear 
weapons in North Korea today. "This is why it is necessary to 
continue the efforts to solve this problem through a dialogue 
with Pyongyang, and not by means of punitive sanctions against 
the Korean People's Democratic Republic," he stated.

  [Text] On 24 May, according to the schedule of the 
Civilian Defense of Minsk Oblast, a planned quarterly exercise 
was held to observe laboratory control networks, as well as to 
practice a complex of radiation protection measures in Myadel 
Rayon of Minsk Oblast. According to (?information) received 
from the State Hydrometeorological Committee [Halowhydromet], 
the State Committee for Nuclear Control [Dzyarzhatamnahlyad], 
and the management of the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant, at 1200 
[0900 GMT] on 25 May, the radiation level around the Ignalina 
Nuclear Power Plant was within the normal limits. At the 
station itself, beginning in April, one energy unit has been 
under a scheduled repair. Operation of the second energy unit 
was halted for economic reasons, and it does not produce 
electric energy.

  [Text] Alarming rumors are spreading throughout the 
Crepublic faster than radiation. Namely, radiation is the 
reason for civil unrest. Therefore, our correspondent Anatol 
Awcharenka has phoned the Halowhydramet [State 
Hydrometeorological Committee]. 
  [Begin recording] [Awcharenka] Good day, Ivan Ivanavich 
[Matveyenka]! The Studio of Information Programs of the 
republican radio has resolved to address you to get the most 
competent information, since you are the head of the Republican 
Center for Radiation Control and Environmental Monitoring. The 
point is that our studio has received hundreds of telephone 
calls this morning -- perhaps, you have received them, too -- 
asking what has happened at the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant. 
Is there some emergency situation? 
  [Matveyenka, in Russian] We also have received such calls. 
The Halowhydramet is monitoring the radiation level continually 
throughout the entire territory of the Republic. Measurements 
of the gamma irradiation rate are being taken at 53 control 
points everyday. In the 100-km zone of the nuclear power 
stations, located around Belarus, measurements are being taken 
every three hours. There are no changes in the radiation level 
in the entire Republic. 
  [Awcharenka] Have you phoned the Ignalina Nuclear Power 
Plant? 
  [Matveyenka] We phoned the Ignalina plant as early as 
yesterday. The radiation level around the nuclear plant is 
normal. The nuclear plant has not been in operation for about a 
month now. However, civil unrest has apparently arisen due to 
the fact that the Staff of Civilian Defense... 
  [Awcharenka, interrupting] Republican Staff? 
  [Matveyenka] ... the Oblast Staff of the Civilian Defense 
conducted exercises in Myadel Rayon and has determined in 
exercise conditions [dal vvodnyye] that the radiation level at 
Naroch [river] is above normal. 
  [Awcharenka] And hence the panic among our population? 
  [Matveyenka] Yes, well, the Staff of Civilian Defense 
perfected the actions of these organizations for iodine 
preventative treatment [pauses]... the actions of those bodies 
concerned with these questions. Therefore, such a panic arouse. 
Such a panic, an alarm, arises frequently. However, 
fortunately, all this does not correspond to the existing rumors. 
  [Awcharenka] Apparently, Ivan Ivanavich, this has happened 
because these exercises were not planned [pauses]... 
  [Matveyenka] Absolutely right. These exercises were not 
planned. However, they cannot be planned beforehand. If all 
these exercises are announced beforehand, then they will not be 
exercises. Therefore, all these questions [pauses]... 
apparently, the radio should give information about the holding 
of such exercises, in all the services. 
  [Awcharenka] Ivan Ivanavich, we have been informed by our 
listeners, who phoned in the morning, that children are not 
allowed to go to kindergartens, that schools changed their 
schedules -- the school summer holidays will begin earlier. 
What can you say about that? 
  [Matveyenka] I want to [word indistinct] assure them that 
the radiation level is normal in the entire territory of the 
Republic. I have information before me on the computer that at 
0900 [0600 GMT] this morning there were 14 microroentgens per 
hour in Minsk... 
  [Awcharenka, interrupting] Let us review the norm. 
  [Matveyenka] Naturally. Before the Chernobyl events, the 
gamma irradiation rate on the territory was 10-20 
(?microroentgens) per hour. Therefore, everything is within the 
normal limits. And, throughout the territory of Belarus, I can 
read [pauses]... in the region of Braslav -- 11 microroentgens, 
in Slutsk -- 16 microroentgens, in Marina Gorka -- 11 
microroentgen. Everything is within the normal limits. 
  [Awcharenka] Thank you for such competent information. I 
will remind our listeners that we have phoned Ivan Ivanavich 
Matveyenka, head of the Republican Center of Radiation Control 
and Environmental Monitoring. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Belarusian Defense Minister Pavel Kozlovskiy </F>
by Nikolay Mirgorodskiy; date and place of interview not stated: 
"Of Sovereignty and a Kalashnikov Cartridge"] 
  [Text] Colonel General Pavel Pavlovich Kozlovskiy, the 
republic's defense minister, is extremely busy and, I thought, 
it would be problematic for him to find even a little time to 
talk with a journalist. But the Defense Ministry immediately 
gave a date and time for the meeting. And the talk began with a 
very topical theme: preparation for the celebration of Belarus' 
liberation from the German fascist invaders. 
  [Kozlovskiy] Actually the Defense Ministry is already taking 
part in these events. The army is quite unable to stand aloof 
from the nationwide holiday. A state commission which includes 
representatives of the Defense Ministry has been created for 
holding the celebrations. A special badge has been approved 
which will be presented to the veterans of the republic's 
liberation. However banal it may sound now, the military units 
are assuming patronage of the veterans, helping them, and 
tending the monuments and graves. A special plan has been 
compiled. 
  [Mirgorodskiy] Comrade minister, do you believe a Belarusian 
army has been established and what traditions -- before and 
after the October period or relating to recent years -- have 
been most acceptable to it? 
  [Kozlovskiy] We are in favor of the good army traditions of 
all periods and generations being preserved. But the traditions 
of recent generations of the USSR Armed Forces are more 
important. Fraternity, mutual assistance, friendship, honor -- 
these are sacred concepts for any soldier and officer. There is 
no doubt that we do not have the right to forget the many years 
of history of the Belorussian Military District. Outstanding 
military leaders served here and sophisticated equipment was 
tested. If we are able to retain the links and traditions of 
the generations, that will have a beneficial effect on the 
army's combat capability. And it is now in the process of 
reform which according to the plan ends in late 1994. The 
establishment of the armed forces is proceeding on the basis of 
the republic's legislation. But to ensure that they acquire 
their own national identity we still have a great deal of work 
to do. 
  [Mirgorodskiy] You mentioned that the Belorussian Military 
District used to test sophisticated models of weapons and 
equipment. So they are not being tested now? And in general 
where do you get weapons, equipment, fuel, uniforms, spare 
parts, and food supplies? 
  [Kozlovskiy] A fine question. You should have put it to 
some deputies who accuse the army of every sin. Yes, previously 
there was a single supply system for the armed forces. The 
Belorussian Military District was considered the best in the 
Union. Moscow gave it everything. Today the situation has 
changed. The tough system of centralized material supplies has 
been destroyed. We have been obliged to embark on bilateral 
agreements with Russia, Ukraine, Poland, and other countries in 
order to maintain our combat readiness. 
  Once again difficulties with finances have arisen. If only 
the power gave us as much as we need for arms. But alas! We 
are obliged to engage in commercial activity, for which we are 
mercilessly and perhaps sometimes rightly criticized. But the 
main function of any army, you will agree, is in no way trade 
and commerce. 
  [Mirgorodskiy] The unit's banner. It is sacred to any 
serviceman. Its loss is shameful. How do matters stand with 
regard to our units' old combat banners? Will they be kept in 
the ranks or replaced with the white, red, and white flag? 
  [Kozlovskiy] We delivered an appeal to the Supreme Soviet 
Presidium on the retention of the units' combat banners, orders, 
and names. They are our history, our memory. In the republic's 
top instances there is a proposal to approve the national banner 
of the Republic of Belarus Armed Forces with all attributes. We 
believe that both banners -- the old and the new -- should be in 
the ranks together. 
  [Mirgorodskiy] Let us suppose that some adversary has 
decided to attack the republic. Will the Belarusian army be 
able to defend us? 
  [Kozlovskiy] The troops are in a state of combat readiness. 
That is unequivocal. The question lies elsewhere. Is the army 
prepared alone, and I stress that, alone, to deliver a fitting 
rebuff to a potential foe? It all depends on the level of the 
conflict. Of course, the army will fight, but it is nonetheless 
better to defend ourselves in alliance with other friendly 
states. At least it is far more reliable. 
  [Mirgorodskiy] How much money has been earmarked for the 
Defense Ministry this year? 
  [Kozlovskiy] About 4 percent of the republican budget. This 
money should be enough only for the army to survive. 
Incidentally, for your information in Russia 20 percent of 
budget funds are earmarked for this purpose. 
  [Mirgorodskiy] You say we are short of equipment. But to 
judge by the recent rapturous newspaper articles we are 
destroying it quite successfully: destroying tanks, aircraft, 
and missiles. That is illogical.... 
  [Kozlovskiy] It is all logical. If logical is part of our 
reality at all. We are fulfilling international treaties. 
Although it is permitted to use some of the equipment in the 
national economy and as exhibits. A painful subject. But even 
the vehicles we are reequipping for use for civilian purposes 
are not, alas, finding customers. Moreover we have the right to 
sell only those tanks, for instance, which were allowed to have 
according to the quota. The others must be scrapped. 
  [Mirgorodskiy] And where does the metal go? 
  [Kozlovskiy] To Khlobin to be melted down..... 
  [Mirgorodskiy] Let us turn from strictly army questions. 
And let us talk a little about politics. The presidential 
election campaign is about to begin. How will the army take 
part in it? 
  [Kozlovskiy] The army by law is outside politics. But no 
one has deprived the soldiers and officers of the right to vote. 
Campaigning work will not be carried out in the military 
collectives. As you know, there are no political parties in the 
army. So that each person will make his choice independently. 
  [Mirgorodskiy] We have touched on the subject of the 
shortage of fuels and lubricants, spare parts, and ammunition. 
But how are exercises proceeding? According to a curtailed 
program? 
  [Kozlovskiy] Combat training is being carried out in full. 
Various simulators are being used, including those developed at 
our own firms. We are merely trying to restrict the troops' 
movement. 
  [Mirgorodskiy] It is known that the officer cadres are not 
trained in all specialities in Belarus. How is the Defense 
Ministry recruiting the specialists it needs? 
  [Kozlovskiy] We are now short of about 1,500 junior 
officers. We are developing our own academy and schools are 
being reoriented. Cadres are also being trained abroad. One 
month of training for a cadet costs $300-350 [figure as 
published]. Is that expensive? Undoubtedly. Now those cadets 
who arrived to study during the existence of the USSR are 
completing their study in our schools. But few are expressing 
the desire to serve in Belarus. Because a Russian officer's 
salary is considerably higher than a Belarusian's. 
Incidentally, our draftee soldier receives half the minimum 
wage. 
  [Mirgorodskiy] Let us complete the subject of money with the 
following question: What is the actual cost of one artillery 
round (as a comparison a pair of shoes used to be cited) and one 
cartridge for a Kalashnikov assault rifle? 
  [Kozlovskiy] One artillery round, depending on the shell, 
costs $100-600. A Kalashnikov cartridge costs 25 cents. You 
can do the sum and make the comparison.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature] </F>
  [Text] Prime Minister Andrey Sangheli says his government's 
main priority is to try to carry out an economic restructuring 
which provides either for winding up or updating the loss making 
enterprises. He believes this can help slow down production 
slump, stimulate the manufacture of competitive products and set 
conditions for the development of more promising sectors to 
update the country's economic potential. 
  In an interview with INTERFAX, Sangheli said that the state 
sector would continue to be the backbone of the economy though 
after being reformed. The government sees restructuring as one 
of the important directions for enhancing the manageability of 
the state sector. 
  Sangheli said that "management machines" would be set up in 
sectors depending on their specifics: from direct government 
support to sectors such as power generation and transport down 
to corporations, holdings, stock companies with the 
participation of state capital. He said that as a form, stock 
holding companies were more preferable than others. On the 
other hand, this can help privatize state property by the use of 
bonds (Russian-style privatization vouchers--IF). On the other, 
it will help plants achieve greater economic self-reliance, give 
them an opportunity to merge with their counterparts, promote 
stable contacts with related industries and lure foreign 
investment if need be. 
  Starting from this month, said the prime minister, large 
profit-making businesses will be put for sale for privatization 
vouchers on a regular basis. Together with the reorganization 
of state and leasing businesses into stock companies, the 
government plans, starting from July, to launch a massive 
campaign for selling state-run businesses as integrated property 
complexes and to finalize privatization of retail trade, 
catering and services later this year. 
  Sangheli said that a group of large state enterprises would 
be transformed into closed-end stock companies with a government 
stake running at more than 80 percent. The operation of such 
businesses also involving private investment is to be regulated 
both by existing and new laws. Government regulation is needed 
to help retain their production capacity and carry out measures 
for the conversion or updating of production. 
  Sangheli said that under a parliamentary resolution, part of 
the state-owned businesses in a number of sectors were not 
subject to privatization. These, he said, will be transformed 
into stock companies, wholly government-owned or with foreign 
participation, but with the government holding to the 
controlling package. The government is also to remain in 
control of businesses relating to its natural monopoly. 
  The government is planning to bring a new law on state 
enterprises and work out a package of measures to enforce it. 
  Sangheli also spoke of government plans to launch a campaign 
this year to reorganize debtor plants. Expertise is also to be 
held in the next two years of key sectors of the economy to test 
out their possible advancement from the point of view of new 
technologies and socioeconomic policies.

<F P=106> [Arkadiy Pasechnik report from Chisinau: "If You Want To </F>
Live, Learn To Shoot"] 
  [Text] The Moldovan parliament has adopted at its first 
reading the Law On Control over Individual Weapons, or more 
simply, on the right to own such weapons. 
  This development, as should have been expected, has drawn a 
mixed reaction in the republic. Some people welcome the 
decision, but most citizens are worried, expecting a new, this 
time even more dangerous surge in crime rates. These worries 
are far from groundless. According to the Moldovan Internal 
Affairs Ministry, this year alone the number of crimes involving 
firearms has almost trebled against 1993. Specialists think 
that lots of the weapons involved are still kept from the armed 
conflict on the Dniester in the summer of 1992. Plus, of 
course, what has been obtained recently on the side by criminal 
gangs that clash in increasingly frequent bloody showdowns. 
  So, an ordinary person also needs the chance to defend 
himself, runs the argument taken up by those favoring the open 
sale of weapons. Yes he does, the law's opponents counter, but 
such weapons will be too expensive for the ordinary person for a 
long time to come. Look, a citizen does not have enough money 
even to pay for his apartment. As a result, the right to armed 
defense could become an exclusive privilege of the rich. 
  Most important, as readers point out in the local press very 
frequently, the adoption of such a law will mean that the state 
recognizes its impotence in ensuring the security of its own 
citizens.

  [Text] INTERFAX has reported that President Boris Yeltsin 
had a meeting with Deputy Prime Minister Sergey Shakhray in the 
Kremlin today. The head of state once again objected to 
Shakhray's resignation from the post of deputy chairman of the 
government. Sources close to Sergey Shakhray's circle have said 
that this problem no longer exists. During their conversation 
the president and the deputy prime minister also discussed 
issues relating to regional policy, questions of the 
implementation of the bilateral treaty with Tatarstan, and 
relations with Chechnya.

  [Text] Moscow May 25 -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin 
signed a decree today approving the federal programme for the 
strengthening of the struggle against crime for 1994-1995 which 
was earlier adopted by the security council. 
  The implementation of this programme envisages consolidation 
of efforts by the law enforcement bodies, state institutions and 
society as a whole, a spokesman for the press service of the 
security council of the Russian Federation told ITAR-TASS on 
Wednesday. 
  The document approved by the president provides for the 
unification of economic, political, legal, educational and 
organisational measures aimed at combining the interests of an 
individual citizen and society. 
  The top priority direction in the struggle against crime is 
the establishment of corresponding legislative, and 
organisational and legal foundations, measures for the 
prevention of crime, and stopping crimes against life, health 
and property of citizens. 
  Special attention is paid to checking malfeasance, economic 
and organised crime, and offenses in the armed forces of the 
Russian Federation.

<F P=106> [Yuriy Gladkevich article: "Russian Production Tired of </F>
Waiting for Reforms. Russian Federation Presidential Edicts 
Initiate Them"] 
  [Text] A lot of water has passed under the bridge since 
Russia was declared a land of reform. Whole oceans have flowed 
by while our legislators have waffled. The Russian Government 
(in one form or another) has repeatedly attempted to channel 
these reforms in the main direction -- that of improving the 
economy, boosting production, strengthening the country's power, 
and enhancing the people's prosperity. But, alas, the planned 
results have not been achieved. 
  Throughout these years many Russian and foreign specialists, 
assessing the Russian leadership's practical policy, have 
repeatedly noted its contradictory and inconsistent nature in 
the economic sphere. Industrial production, particularly in 
relation to high-tech and labor-intensive output and to sectors 
ensuring our economic and defense might, has steadily fallen, 
depressed by various crises. 
  The country is getting close to a situation where the 
economy, as the head of state recognizes, is on the verge of 
collapse. 
  Only one thing can save it -- slowly transferring the 
reforms 
to the production sphere. Under these conditions the action 
taken by Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who has signed a 
package of highly important edicts (on the abolition of quotas 
and the licensing of goods for export; on certain issues of 
fiscal policy; on the reform of state enterprises; on additional 
measures to normalize transactions; on the restoration of tax 
payment discipline; and on the consolidation of the Highways 
Fund into the Russian Federation budget) may be of decisive 
importance. 
  In the opinion of experts, the first five of these edicts 
should have a decisive impact on the situation in Russia. The 
lifting of export quotas, for instance, should stimulate the 
further liberalization of Russian exports and remove the 
administrative barriers in the way of exporter enterprises. But 
this does not mean that the mechanism for monitoring their 
activity will be destroyed. The system of foreign exchange 
controls will continue to operate, and the institution of 
specialized exporters will be maintained and could even be 
strengthened in the future. Quite clearly, enterprises 
themselves can count on a lowering of export tariffs, which will 
have a favorable impact on their business. 
  The second edict instructs the Russian Federation Government 
to submit draft laws to the Federal Assembly which would reduce 
the number of taxes and make it possible to lower the main taxes 
-- income tax and value-added tax -- by 10-20 percent on 
average. This measure is very necessary, since enterprises are 
being crushed by the burden of taxation, which makes it harder 
for their output to compete in the world market, rendering it 
inordinately expensive. This edict also establishes 
concessionary taxation for enterprises using foreign capital and 
engaged in the production sphere. 
  Sanctions have also been tightened up against enterprises 
owned by the federal government which violate the state's rights 
as their owner. Currently the leaders of certain state 
enterprises are very actively manipulating funds and budget 
resources for their own interests -- for instance, federal 
appropriations are "put to work" on the interbank market, and 
the profits go straight into the pockets of the tricksters. 
  Enterprises discovered to be acting in this way and not due 
for privatization will be immediately redesignated as 
treasury-funded [kazennyye] (the most stringent form of state 
ownership). 
  The measures to normalize transactions envisage the 
introduction of strict chronological sequence [kalendarnaya 
ocherednost] being followed for payments from current accounts. 
If, say, an enterprise has no funds in its ruble accounts, it 
is obliged to convert money from its foreign-currency accounts 
and settle up with the other party. I think that even if this 
measure does not end the growth in mutual nonpayments between 
enterprises -- which is forcing many of them into extremely 
difficult positions -- it will at least stop the problem getting 
any worse. 
  For entirely understandable reasons, the military are 
particularly interested in whether these edicts will be able to 
improve the situation in the defense industry. It is no secret 
that, for various reasons, the military department sometimes 
cannot even afford the output of military-industrial complex 
enterprises, and it owes the defense industry a lot of money. 
As for mutual nonpayments between enterprises -- it is hard to 
calculate just who owes whom how much. Add to this the pressure 
of the tax burden and it is clear that if this situation 
persists for a while longer, we run the risk of witnessing the 
wholesale bankruptcy of Russian arms, combat hardware, and 
systems producers. Almost 80 percent of military-industrial 
complex enterprises have already reached this point, and the 
number of potential bankruptcies is growing. We must assume 
that the signing of the aforesaid edicts will improve the 
condition of the severely ailing defense sector. But 
specialists believe that a full recovery will only come about 
when the first set of "healing" edicts is backed up by new ones. 
  In complete agreement with this, it seems, is Aleksandr 
Lifshits, leader of the president's group of experts, who stated 
that the main task is to keep inflation reasonable and switch 
the reforms to the sphere of production -- the very sphere that 
forms the foundations of our power, the improvement of the 
economy, and the implementation of the reform program as a 
whole. The Russian Government, we understand, has so far 
received only an incomplete "guidance document." But even this 
is already a considerable normative basis for stimulating the 
reform process -- a process which the country's parliament was, 
regrettably, unable to come up with in good time.

  [Text] The faction of the Russian Liberal-Democratic Party 
of the State Duma expressed sharp protest against the article by 
Yegor Gaydar "Stavka na negodayev" "Stake on Villains" published 
in the newspaper IZVESTIYA on May 17 in which the leader of the 
Russia's Choice faction stated that all "classic signs of a 
fascist party, ideology, and personality exactly apply to 
Zhirinovskiy and his Liberal Democratic Party." 
  A statement of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] made 
public 
in the State Duma on Wednesday draws attention to the fact that 
Gaydar addressed these and many other insults to deputies of the 
Liberal Democratic Party faction, all members of the party and 
12 million voters who cast ballots for this party in elections 
December 12, 1993. 
  Gaydar's reforms, which turned out to be unsuccessful in 
conditions of a socialist political economy "made 90 percent of 
Russian citizens miserable and suck all blood out of the body of 
the great power during "the shock therapy" period, authors of 
the LDP statement note. "As for your ethnic policy it would be 
better if you leave the State Duma and move to live to the 
Caucasus or Central Asia -- any Russian living in these regions 
would be glad to exchange apartments with you," the statement of 
the Duma's LDP faction transferred to INTERFAX says. 
  The faction also believes that the intensive activities of 
Yegor Gaydar aimed at retaining power, will finally lead to 
"Russia becoming the first multi-party fascist state in the 
world."

  [Text] Six State Duma deputies gave official notice 
Wednesday that they were leaving the Liberal Democratic Union of 
December 12. This decision was taken by five former members of 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic Party -- Viktor 
Kobelev, Aleksandr Pronin, Vladimir Novikov, Vladimir Borzyuk 
and Tatyana Bulgakova as well as Deputy Andrey Volkov. 
  Aleksandr Pronin told INTERFAX they had decided to leave 
because of disagreements with the line taken by the Union's 
leader Boris Fedorov and also the desire not to be in the same 
group as Andrey Makarov. 
  Another serious reason for the exit of the six was the fact 
that the leadership of the "Decembrists" had kept secret from 
ordinary members the fact that the leadership had met recently 
with President Boris Yeltsin and were therefore representing 
no-one but themselves. 
  "If Zhirinovskiy is openly practicing deceit, then the 
leaders of the Decembrists are doing it behind people's backs," 
said Pronin. 
  He said that the six deputies would not join any other 
factions but rather form an autonomous deputy group.

<F P=106> [Natalya Gorodetskaya report under the "Conflict" rubric: </F>
"Russian Federation President Urges Ingushis and Ossetians Not 
to Let Themselves Be Provoked. Ingushetia Accuses Temporary 
Administration of Inaction"] 
  [Text] Vyacheslav Kostikov, the Russian president's press 
secretary, circulated a statement yesterday regarding extremist 
statements and actions that have become more frequent in the 
Ossetia-Ingushetia conflict zone. The statement says that 
extremists on both sides are trying to involve in the conflict 
the Russian soldiers and officers performing a peace-keeping 
mission. "The Russian authorities do not intend to tolerate the 
crude violations of human rights and legality in the zone 
subject to the state of emergency rule," the statement points 
out. Urging the citizens of North Ossetia and Ingushetia "to 
resist provocations," Boris Yeltsin draws attention to the fact 
that the law and order forces in the state of emergency zone 
have all the necessary powers and equipment to suppress 
manifestations of extremism and to protect civilians from 
violence, the statement says. 
  In the meantime, Ingushetia President Ruslan Aushev's chief 
of staff Ruslan Pliyev has stated that it is the Temporary 
Administration, or rather its inaction, that is to blame for the 
worsened situation in the state of emergency zone. In his 
opinion, the taking of six Ingush hostages by Ossetians on 19 
May is a logical consequence of this inaction. In his opinion, 
the leaders of the Temporary Administration in the state of 
emergency zone should be replaced, and its headquarters should 
be located on neutral territory rather than in the capital of 
North Ossetia, Vladikavkaz. 
  The Ingushetia president's press service addressed another 
statement to "Ostankino." The statement says: "People have 
been held hostages for the fifth day running in conditions of 
constant threat to their lives. In the meantime the central 
mass media and the "Ostankino" channel have been relaying 
various reports from North Ossetia, but there has not been even 
a word about Ingushi hostages." Glossing over facts and 
one-sided information, in the view of the press service, does 
not promote stability in the state of emergency zone.

  [Text] Moscow, 25 May -- A decision to set up a Television 
and Radio League [Liga televideniya I radio] was taken today by 
representatives of over 100 all-Russian and regional state and 
independent radio and TV companies. Anatoliy Lysenko, general 
director of the All-Russia Radio and TV Company, was elected 
chairman of the body while it is being established. 
  The league will be a body of the Union of Journalists of 
Russia. In an interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent, Union 
Chairman Vsevolod Bogdanov voiced the hope that the league will 
be able to exert considerable influence on the framing of 
legislation in the TV and radio broadcasting field, will become 
a collective body defending the interests of the "electronic" 
press, and will enable a number of topical professional issues 
to be resolved. At the first organizational meeting, Grigoriy 
Shevelev, Ostankino's first deputy chairman, was instructed to 
take charge of the work of setting up an academy of radio and 
television. Other areas of the league's activities were also 
outlined.

<F P=106> [Undated announcement by Russian president's press secretary </F>
Vyacheslav Kostikov: "In the Spirit of Civil Accord"] 
  [Text] In connection with the signing of a package of 
economic edicts encouraging activity by the government and 
legislative organs in the sphere of increasing the pace of 
economic reform, Russian President B.N. Yeltsin has sent letters 
to State Duma and Federation Council deputies explaining the 
motives behind the presidential initiative in the economic 
sphere. 
  The president points out to the deputies that his actions 
arise both out of actual constitutional prerogatives and out of 
the Treaty on Social Accord. In his letter B.N. Yeltsin informs 
the deputies that, acting in the spirit of civil accord, 
immediately after signing the package of economic edicts he 
instructed the government to submit draft laws based on the 
edicts to the deputies for their consideration. So the edicts, 
insofar as they impinge on the jurisdiction of the Federal 
Assembly, will remain valid until the relevant federal laws are 
adopted. 
  Moreover, on 24 May the president proposed that V.S. 
Chernomyrdin, I.P. Rybkin, V.F. Shumeyko, and B.N. Topornin, 
chairman of the Public Chamber under the president, immediately 
set up a working group representing a wide range of public and 
social interests in order to stimulate the speediest adoption of 
amendments to tax legislation.

<F P=106> [Vsevolod Orlov report: "The Economy Should Be Economical. </F>
Taxpayer! Here Is a Package for You. It Is Hard To Resist 
Reporting on the Package of Edicts Recently Signed by the 
Russian President"] 
  [Text] They presuppose the following: 
  1. The abolition of quotas and licenses for export shipments 
by all enterprises, as well as concessions on export duties in 
addition to those laid down by Russian legislation (naturally 
this does not apply to interstate agreements concluded 
previously). 
  2. The government's submission to the Federal Assembly of 
draft laws reducing the number of taxes, lowering the rates of 
basic taxes -- profits and value-added tax -- by 10-20 percent, 
and prescribing preferential taxation for enterprises involving 
foreign capital employed exclusively in the production sphere. 
What is more, there are to be changes in the taxation of 
individuals. 
  3. The creation of "state-funded" enterprises, in other 
words enterprises whose leaders have limited rights but bear 
full personal responsibility for the activity of the enterprises 
in their charge. In this connection there will no longer be 
federal enterprises in full state ownership, while those already 
created will either be eliminated or turned into "state-funded 
houses." Production units which are ineffectually managed and 
not liable to privatization will provide an additional base for 
the creation of "state-funded enterprises." 
  4. The establishment of chronological reporting 
[kalendarnaya otchetnost] on payments from enterprises' current 
payment accounts and the creation of a federal bills of exchange 
chamber. 
  5. The introduction of strict responsibility for tax 
evaders: The first violation incurs a heavy fine, the second 
results in the elimination of the enterprise. 
  The adopted edicts may quite easily be regarded as a step 
toward administrative control of the economy. But has anyone 
said that Russia does not need those kind of steps? Triumphant 
privatization reports do of course provide inspiration for fresh 
achievements. However, state enterprises also produce output 
and, incidentally, workers at these enterprises have the worst 
social protection of all, creating a heightened danger of 
strikes in the state sector. State-funded enterprises may elicit 
bad associations with Stalinist methods of managing industry. 
But there must nevertheless be a clear distinction between 
concerns and corporations that have, as a result of 
privatization, legalized the position of monopolized feudal 
estates and state enterprises. The latter should come under 
tight state control. That is the reality of a mixed economy. 
  The president's edicts on the whole give rise to the sense 
of 
attempting to cut the Gordian knot of Russian economic 
management with albeit several blows. Whether good, bad, or 
mediocre, clear and comprehensible rules of play have to be 
established some day. The tax situation is abnormal -- so here 
is legislation which precludes supplementary interpretation and 
here are punitive measures to be applied against those who do 
not give a damn about it. I must particularly point out that 
tough measures are being taken against taxpayers at the same 
time as guarantees of an improvement in the tax climate 
(although it is of course better for there to be an improvement 
first and then tough measures). There is a problem involved in 
granting export concessions, quotas, and licenses with unclear 
regulations that permit heaps of violations -- all three should 
be abolished (I think that certain countries that live off 
reexporting Russian resources are becoming somewhat jumpy). 
There is an interesting aspect to the problem of payment 
defaults: A debtor's ruble account is empty but his 
hard-currency account is full. There may be a solution: In 
that situation the hard currency should be immediately converted 
and the debts paid.... 
  I would very much like to write the words "and so on," but 
that is regrettably where the adopted measures stop.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Kucherenko report: "Russia's President Has Signed </F>
Six Edicts Aimed at Accelerating Reforms"] 
  [Text] In the opinion of A. Livshits, leader of the group 
of experts under the Russian Federation president, these 
documents mark a switch of the reformers' main effort to the 
production sphere and the imposition of order in the matter of 
mutual payments. 
  Many difficulties lie in store for us here, however. In the 
abolition of export quotas and licenses, for example. Such 
privileges really do not exist in the developed world, since 
everyone there has equal rights to foreign economic activity -- 
pay only the customs duties that are laid down for everyone. In 
Russia, however, many programs at federal level, and 
particularly at regional level, are funded exclusively out of 
the duty-free export of valuable raw materials. This is how 
local authorities and even giants at federal level secure 
currency for their projects. Now all their calculations have 
been canceled out. This means that we cannot avoid another 
struggle at the top, opposition, and lobbying to repeal this 
edict. All the more so because the president already tried to 
impose order in the granting of foreign economic privileges last 
year -- an attempt that failed then. 
  Let us take the edict "On Some Questions of Tax Policy." We 
can only welcome the termination of the practice of granting 
privileges which make holes in the budget, the lightening of the 
tax burden, and the transfer of sectoral nonbudget funds to the 
federal budget, under strict control. Here is the rub, however 
-- how can this be combined with the figures for big state 
expenditure, which requires big taxes? The authorities probably 
reckon on collecting more taxes, since entrepreneurs and 
industrialists will breathe a sigh of relief and will stop 
evading their payment. But our tax service is far from perfect, 
and so a new round of budget battles cannot be ruled out. 
  Those who wrested privileges from the government and who 
hold 
nonbudget funds that are not under the control of the center -- 
sectoral and regional lobbies -- will not surrender their 
positions without a fight either. They have a great arsenal of 
weapons: Strike threats, moans about the deplorable state of 
industry, refusals to pay money into the federal treasury, 
surges of separatism. It seems that the implementation of this 
edict will be a serious test of the organization and strength of 
Russian central authority. 
  A similar "trial of strength" will also be provided by the 
document "On Additional Measures To Normalize Transactions and 
To Strengthen Payment Discipline...." For, as the Central Bank 
admits, we have no laws today that demand rigid discipline in 
payment for goods and services. The system of control over 
enterprises' compliance with financial discipline has also been 
destroyed. It is possible to recall the sad fate that befell 
the edict on the introduction of promissory notes. The demand 
for currency accounts to be used to clear debts in the absence 
of working capital treads on the corns of those same powerful 
lobbies that have plastered industry with a mass of 
commercial-middleman structures. 
  Strong resistance will also be elicited by the edicts on 
ranking "naughty" enterprises with the state's controlling 
packages as rigidly controlled state enterprises. For a 
significant stratum of managers who are accustomed to dealing 
with state property as though it were their own private property 
has been formed in the country in the space of a few years. 
They also learned a long time ago how to avoid paying taxes by 
spreading enterprises' funds out among several bank accounts, 
and the edict on restoring discipline of tax payments could put 
an end to those liberties. 
  So we could be witnessing normal economic measures, delayed 
by two years, marking the start of a tricky political campaign.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Ostanin] </F>
  [Text] Vladimir May 25 -- "Russia has not lost its leading 
positions in the production of firearms and hand guns. We have 
something to show and of what to be proud," Major-General 
Nikolay Zlenko, representative of the general staff of the armed 
forces of the Russian Federation, who arrived today in Vladimir 
at the military exhibition as a member of a government 
delegation, told ITAR-TASS on Wednesday. 
  According to the general, the high rating of Russian 
firearms 
is confirmed by a keen interest to them shown by buyers from 17 
countries of the world including the United States, Britain, 
Germany and Israel. 
  Despite the difficulties in financing the Russian military- 
industrial complex, the defense ministry of the Russian 
Federation is still interested in advertising its products and 
the permanent participation in exhibitions of armaments and 
materiel, the major- general pointed out. 
  In reply to a question by ITAR-TASS about participation of 
the defense ministry in the conversion of defense industry to 
peace-time production, Nikolay Zlenko said that this 
participation was reflected in dozens of displayed exhibits. 
  According to the general, the defense ministry has become a 
sponsor of a series of developments of hunting rifles on the 
basis of a Kalashnikov submachine gun, in particular a "saiga" 
carbine. 
  The defense ministry, Nikolay Zlenko said, also financed the 
designing of a rifle for a farmer "of-93", various kinds of 
ammunition including for a gas pistol. 
  This work, the general noted, will be continued with due 
account for maintaining of the military potential and mobilizing 
possibilities of defense enterprises in Russia.

  [Text] Major General Vladimir Osadchiy, a key figure in the 
Main Military Budget and Financing Directorate of Russia's 
Defence Ministry, said that the social aspect has become 
decisive in the reform of Russia's armed forces. 
  Osadchiy believes that if the military budget is implemented 
in its present form then half of all servicemen will not be able 
to receive their pay within the term set by law. Two to three 
months without pay would lead inevitably lead to a worsening of 
the already difficult situation among the troops.

<F P=106> [Nikolay Burbyga report: "Russia's New Armaments Under </F>
Threat"] 
  [Text] In the opinion of First Deputy Defense Minister 
Andrey Kokoshin, in 1993 the Defense Ministry managed, despite 
the difficult financial situation, to make headway in 
implementing a number of very important priorities in 
military-political policy endorsed by the president and the 
Russian Security Council. 
  This applies first and foremost to the qualitative 
improvement of a number of elements of the strategic nuclear 
forces, including battle management systems, communications 
systems and automated command-and-control systems at the 
tactical level, several types of precision weapons, electronic 
warfare systems, servicemen's personal gear and equipment, and 
the creation of a multirole fighter-bomber. 
  However, the results of all this work are under threat in 
1994 because of the drastically deteriorating situation as 
regards the financing of defense needs. As your IZVESTIYA 
correspondent was told in conversation by specialists from the 
Defense Ministry Committee for Military-Political Policy, if 
current financial trends are maintained a complete stoppage of 
work on creating new armaments systems can be expected. 
Resources today no longer suffice even to pay the wages in 
scientific research institutes and design bureaus carrying out 
defense orders.

<F P=106> [Andrey Nikolayev report under the "Threats" rubric: </F>
"Military-Industrial Enterprises Could Go Bust. Defense Sector 
To Mark 9 June With Whistles"] 
  [Text] Defense sector trade union chairmen have sent an 
appeal to State Duma and Federal Assembly deputies expressing 
their "concern over repeated cuts in the expenditure on weapons 
and military hardware procurements, military research and 
development in the draft federal budget for 1994." In the 
opinion of the trade union leaders, the government should have 
"canceled the state order that is already being carried out" 
altogether because there will be just enough money to repay 
debts for products already manufactured and to operate weapons 
and equipment. In this case, however, around 80 percent of 
defense enterprises will go bankrupt, 1.4 million workers will 
be laid off, and it will take around 30 trillion rubles to pay 
unemployment benefits alone. The spending cuts and the 
cancellation of the state order, the trade union activists 
think, will bring about a situation where "the country will be 
stripped of its means of defense and will have to procure 
armaments and military hardware abroad." 
  Given that, the trade union chairmen of the aviation, 
defense, general-purpose engineering, and radioelectronic 
industries wrote: "The workers collectives insist that the 
financing for weapons and military hardware procurements and 
military research and development should stay at the level 
established by the 1994 state order," and also that credit lines 
be opened for conversion programs and measures taken to increase 
the budget revenues "by creating incentives for production 
growth, fully collecting taxes, and organizing the sales of 
weapons, military hardware, and civilian products to foreign 
countries in the most efficient fashion with producer 
enterprises being directly involved in such sales." 
  According to information received by your SEGODNYA 
correspondent at the Central Council of the All-Russia Trade 
Union of Defense Industry Workers, the trade union executive's 
decision to suspend the production of civilian and non-food 
consumer goods at the enterprises for 5-10 minutes on 9 June "to 
support demands that wages be paid and jobs retained" still 
remains valid. All trade unions of the defense industry have 
given their backing to the action during which sirens, whistles, 
and so forth will be switched on at military-industrial 
enterprises. It is expected that on 9 June rallies and meetings 
will take place at many defense enterprises to discuss whether 
an all-Russia strike in the military- industrial sector should 
be called in the near future.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Veklich report: "Defense Sector on Its Knees"] </F>
  [Text] Novosibirsk -- Sixteen of the largest enterprises 
in Novosibirsk Oblast have closed down either partially or 
completely. While carefully fulfilling state orders and 
retaining the mobilization capacity required for them, the 
Novosibirsk defense sector has still not received payments of 41 
billion rubles due to it from the budget. 
  According to Anatoliy Yakovlev, chief of the Novosibirsk 
Oblast Administration's Machine Building and Defense Sectors of 
Industry Department, around 70 appeals have been sent to top 
organs of power. So far they have met with silence. Enterprise 
trade unions are planning a protest for 9 June.

  [Text] Moscow May 25 TASS -- Bashkortostan became on 
Wednesday the second republic after its neighbouring Tatarstan 
to sign a power-sharing treaty with Moscow. 
  The signing ceremony crowned a final round of negotiations 
between Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin and Bashkir 
President Murtaza Rakhimov. 
  The package of signed documents includes agreements on 
economic cooperation, on foreign trade, on sharing powers in 
defence industries and state property ownership, on crime 
fighting and environment protection among others. 
  Drafted agreements on budget and banking relations remained 
unsigned as the parties failed to reach compromise in these 
fields.

  [Text] The Russian president's visit to Tatarstan scheduled 
for May 30-31 is a planned trip the head of state makes to 
various regions of Russia, Presidential Aide Anatoly 
Korabelschikov told Interfax. He pointed out that after Moscow 
and Kazan signed the Mutual Power Delegation Treaty, this visit 
had no political underlying. 
  According to Korabelschikov, the president will pay special 
attention to bringing on-line the motor plant damaged by a fire. 
The plant belongs to the association KamAZ, one of the biggest 
truck-manufacturing associations in Russia. During his visit, 
Yeltsin plans to examine principally new engines designed there, 
in particular the engines of new city buses. 
  The president is also interested in the creation of a 
financial and production group by KamAZ, Togliatti car-making 
plant and Avtovazbank. Such groups created in various regions 
of Russia are called to stimulate the development of 
top-priority branches of the economy, Korabelschikov said. 
  In Kazan, Yeltsin plans to meet with the Tatar leadership 
and 
visit a number of agricultural enterprises.

  [Text] It seems that residents of Bolshoy Kamen will be 
able to heave a sigh of relief -- the Pacific Fleet intends to 
transfer the run-down TNT-5 tanker containing liquid radioactive 
waste to a less populated location, possibly Pavlovsk bay, where 
a whole complex of measures to prolong the tanker's life will 
begin. However, it is possible that a different place will be 
chosen, where the dilapidated vessel will await completion of 
the construction of purification facilities, which may also take 
quite a long time.

  [Text] Dear listeners, we now present a report on the 
latest situation in the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] and the 
border between Armenia and Azerbaijan. 
  We welcome the fact that the combat operations in the 
confrontation zone have been suspended. The agreement for a 
cease-fire has rarely been violated, but Azerbaijan has to be 
blamed for the violations of the agreement. That Republic's 
military units have intermittently fired on various points of 
the Armenian front line. The NKR defense units have refrained 
from returning the fire. 
  Regrettably, Azerbaijan has violated the cease-fire. The NKR 
Defense Army Headquarters Press Service has disclosed that 
Azerbaijan's military units tried to capture a strategically 
important hill in the Gadrutskiy and Fizulinskiy sector of the 
front line at about 0300. The NKR defense units repulsed the 
attack. No one was hurt on the Armenian side. 
  The Armenian Ministry of Defense Information Center has 
informed us that the situation on the border between Armenia and 
Azerbaijan has been relatively peaceful. No incident has 
occurred in that region. 
  We hope that a completely peaceful situation will be 
established on the border as soon as possible.

<F P=106> [AZERTADZH report: "`We Aspire to the All-Around Development </F>
of Cooperation With the United States'"] 
  [Text] "I welcome the arrival in the republic of such a 
representative delegation from the United States of America. We 
aspire to the all-around development of relations between the 
United States and Azerbaijan and in this context attach 
importance to the meeting with you," Geydar Aliyev, president of 
Azerbaijan, declared, receiving on 15 May a U.S. delegation 
headed by James Collins, special adviser to the U.S. secretary 
of state and senior coordinator of U.S. policy in respect to the 
new independent states (CIS). The delegation, which had come to 
Baku to study the prospects of the cooperation of the two 
countries, also included Joseph Presel, chief of the State 
Department Regional Conflicts Desk and U.S. representative in 
the CSCE Minsk Group, and representatives of the Departments of 
Defense, Treasury, and Energy. 
  Having expressed his respect for the leadership and people 
of 
the United States of America and the President of the country, 
Geydar Aliyev emphasized that he viewed with optimism the future 
of Azerbaijani-American relations and a strengthening of 
relations between the two countries. We value highly the efforts 
of the United States, he said, aimed at support for the new 
states that have formed since the disintegration of the former 
USSR. Considering that attempts are being made to deprive these 
republics, ours included, of sovereignty and independence, the 
support of the United States was and remains a powerful factor 
restraining these attempts. 
  Speaking of the military conflict between Armenia and 
Azerbaijan, which has essentially grown into a war and which is 
seriously damaging the sovereignty and territorial integrity of 
Azerbaijan, the president of the republic emphasized: "Our 
position is unequivocal--the conflict must be settled 
peacefully, and relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan and the 
question of Nagornyy Karabakh also must be discussed only at the 
negotiating table. Operating in this direction, we are 
cooperating actively with the CSCE and its Minsk Group, of which 
the United States is a member, and on which we pin big hopes." 
  As Geydar Aliyev observed, the development of Azerbaijan's 
economic relations with other countries, the United States 
included, will play an enormous part in a strengthening of the 
republic's independence. In the president's opinion, the United 
States also has an interest in the establishment of mutually 
profitable relations with Azerbaijan--a state with strong 
economic potential--cooperation in the sphere of the development 
and use of the oil deposits included. We hope, he announced, 
that the negotiations between the State Petroleum Company of 
Azerbaijan and Western firms, of a consortium of which the 
American Amoco and Pennzoil companies are a part, will be 
concluded successfully. As you know, a stage of the negotiations 
is taking place currently in Istanbul, and I hope, the head of 
state observed, that the signing of oil contracts will be 
possible upon their conclusion. Geydar Aliyev also expressed the 
hope that cooperation in the sphere of oil production would make 
it possible to expand contacts in other spheres also, 
emphasizing that a strengthening of Azerbaijani-American 
relations would be of importance for economic cooperation 
between the two countries. 
  Other matters connected with the prospects of the 
development 
of bilateral relations were discussed also. 
  Rasul Guliyev, chairman of the Supreme Council, Fuad 
Guliyev, 
first deputy prime minister, State Counselor Vafa Guli-zade, 
Gasan Gasanov, minister of foreign relations of the republic, 
and Richard Dale Kozlaric, ambassador of the United States in 
Azerbaijan, were present at the reception.

  [Text] President Geydar Aliyev of Azerbaijan has expressed 
satisfaction over the course of talks on two offshore oil 
projects in the Caspian Sea between the Azeri Government and a 
consortium of Western companies. 
  At a meeting with consortium representatives in Baku on 
Tuesday, the president spoke of Baku's willingness to strike a 
fair deal which would mark a new stage in the development of the 
country's oil industry. 
  The consortium includes British Petroleum, Statoil of 
Norway, 
Turkish Petroleum Corporation and U.S. Amoco, Pennzoil, McDermot 
and Unocal. Also attending was a representative of Russia's 
LUKoil company which was awarded a 10 percent stake of 
Azerbaijan's share of some 30 percent. 
  Aliyev described as a success the latest round of talks 
which 
ended in Istanbul (Turkey) on May 20. He said the negotiations 
would resume in a month. 
  On taxes and oil tariffs, Aliyev said these technicalities 
were subject to negotiation. 
  He tried to allay fears about the uncertainty of the Caspian 
Sea's status, saying Azerbaijan was firmly in control of its 
territorial waters.

  [Excerpt] Baku, 25 May -- For the first time since the 
split which occurred two weeks ago following the withdrawal of 
15 members of parliament [MPs] in protest against the signing by 
the republic of the Bishkek protocol, the sitting of the 
National Assembly of Azerbaijan started this afternoon with a 
full quorum. 
  Speaking on behalf of the "rebel" MPs, Tofik Gasymov, who 
had 
been foreign minister under the Elchibey regime, explained that 
their decision to return to the meeting hall was taken in order 
"not to provide any more reason to the authorities for slander 
and blackmail." However, he stated, the group of MPs he 
represents remain of the same opinion. "We are against not only 
the Bishkek protocol, but also the introduction of Russian 
troops into the region in the guise of CIS peace-making forces," 
he stressed. The Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict should be 
settled, in his view, within the framework of the United Nations 
and the CSCE. He also feels that to solve this complex problem 
it is necessary to return to the trilateral peace initiative of 
Russia, Turkey, and the United States. As for separation forces 
and international observers, the MP is convinced that they can 
be brought in and stationed in the conflict zone, but only after 
the appropriate decision by the UN Security Council. 
  More hardline was the speech by Etibar Mammadov, the leader 
of the influential opposition party--National Independence of 
Azerbaijan--who announced his resignation as a member of the 
National Assembly. According to his assertion, over recent days 
the republic has seen a campaign of blackmail unfolding against 
the opposition, which differs from the authorities in approaches 
to settling the conflict. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Baku (May 24) TURAN--Behaviour of the authorities 
shows that they intend to urge the opposition on open and forced 
confrontation. It is not a secret that parliament's crisis on 
May 18 was intendedly provoked by the authorities. They knew 
that the irritated opposition would leave Parliament's session 
and would prefer to conduct a rally. Dispersion of the 
demonstrators, arrests and slaughter of the deputies and party 
leaders on May 21 just poured oil in the flame. 
  Yesterday the police seized and beat the deputy and the PFA 
leader, Ibragim Ibragimli. On the same day the Milli Majlis 
made a request to President Aliyev to reduce the quorum in the 
Majlis from 34 to 26 voices. The approval of this request by 
President Aliyev means that any his proposals will be 
immediately adopted by legislative body of the country. 
  The opposition is put in the following conditions: Either it 
will capitulate and resign itself to dictatorship or it will put 
resistance. 
  The authorities commit outrages and realizing the danger of 
it, they try to make their activities legal. 
  The conflict between the opposition and the authorities 
takes 
place on the background of worsened geopolitical situation and 
due to this fact foreign forces urge Azerbaijan on confrontation 
with elements of civil war. Probably, the foreign forces intend 
to remove the current president. However, he will not leave his 
office easily and the situation can lose control. One should 
take into account that Azerbaijan is at the state of war and 
civil confrontation in the Republic can cause serious 
consequences.

<F P=106> ["Appeal to Mr. G. Aliyev, President of the Azerbaijan </F>
Republic, and the National Assembly of the Azerbaijan Republic"] 
  [Text] The appearance of the private television company 
VMTI has played an appreciable role in the life of independent 
Azerbaijan--which is experiencing a difficult sociopolitical 
situation--by contributing to the establishment of principles of 
freedom of thought and pluralism and to the formation of 
democratic institutions of power. 
  From the day it was created VMTI television set for itself 
the goal of serving the people who are experiencing a difficult 
period in their history, who are tired of political cataclysms. 
By advocating human and national cultural values, the 
television company has contributed to the development of high 
aesthetic taste in the viewers. This is why in a short period 
of time VMTI has been able to win the sympathies of a broad 
viewing audience. 
  Any success begins with creative competition. The newly 
created television company has helped in all ways to develop a 
high level of professionalism among television workers. There 
is still much for the television channel, which is not even a 
year old, to do along this path. But as in other areas of our 
life, obstacles have appeared on the path to the new--in this 
case the television company. The sudden closure of VMTI, which 
was founded in compliance with existing legislation, has evoked 
protest from the intelligentsia. 
  We, the undersigned, request that you provide for the 
restoration of democratic norms and overturn the illegal 
decision to close down the private television company VMTI. 
  Respectfully, 
  Anar [Azeri writer], Mikhail Abdullayev, Fuad Poladov, 
Dzhevanshir Kuliyev, Rafig Guseynov, and others.

  [Text] The signing of a Declaration of National Accord and 
Unity took place in Tbilisi today. The ceremony was opened by 
Academician Aleksandr Javakhishvili. Participants in the 
meeting were addressed by the head of state, who spoke about the 
great importance of the document. 
  This was followed by the signing of the declaration by 
representatives of various public and political organizations. 
Among the many signatories were the Association of Georgian 
Professional Unions, the Liberal Democratic Party, the People's 
Front, the Green movement, the Russo-Georgian Cultural Society, 
the National Democratic Party, and the Citizens' Union. 
  At the end of the ceremony our correspondent spoke with 
Eduard Shevardnadze and Giorgi Chanturia. 
  [Begin recording] [Shevardnadze] I think that this is the 
beginning of a very important movement. I cannot say that the 
declaration will solve all problems. However, the fact that it 
was signed by such reputable political associations, forces and 
public organizations and that we were all united by several 
principles stemming from national interests, means that we have 
embarked upon the path of unity in our struggle for the 
salvation, independence, and democratic development of the 
country. 
  As for the parties that are not represented here today, some 
of them have stated that they need some time to make up their 
mind. I think that if we do well and observe these principles, 
they will also join us, and a single front that is to lead us to 
a single Georgia will finally be formed. 
  [Chanturia] Unfortunately, we have not recently had the 
luxury of holding political events like this. This is 
undoubtedly a political event. I know that there will be many 
demagogues and populists saying that the mere signing of 
something does not mean much [words indistinct]. 
  If we agree on these important principles, it will mean that 
we have a future. Opponents may say that some forces will not 
observe these principles. Those who will not are not going to 
benefit from doing so. This declaration gives us an opportunity 
to use it against any organization which has signed it and is 
not observing it. 
  In any case, this document should have been signed. The 
signing of this document has started off a major process. It 
may be not so conspicuous, since there is no waving of flags and 
destruction. Nevertheless, a very important political process 
has started. I hope that if this process gains sufficient 
momentum, we will be saved and will emerge as a state and a free 
society. Not only will we defend and retain our independence, 
but we will regain some of the lost ground as well. [end

<F P=106> ["Text" of Declaration of National Unity and Accord signed </F>
in Tbilisi on 25 May 1994] 
  [Text] We, the undersigned [as received], remaining loyal 
to the ideals of 26 May and realizing our immense responsibility 
to the country and its future, recognize that stability and 
consolidation are the necessary preconditions for the 
implementation of the unswerving will of the citizens of Georgia 
to build an independent and democratic state and strive for an 
open society. 
  Despite differences in the positions of various political 
forces, the basic principles shaping the country's future which 
are shared by a large proportion of the citizens of Georgia are 
to be laid down. A single state mentality, civic patriotism, 
and striving for a common goal must become the foundation for 
national consolidation. 
  We agree to the main principles in order to establish 
national accord and unity in the country. Our unswerving and 
undeviating principles are the following: 
  1. [word indistinct] the independence and territorial 
integrity of Georgia. 
  2. Adherence to democratic ideals, efforts to build a civic 
society, and strict observance of human rights. 
  3. Tolerance, compassion, and protection of the rights of 
ethnic minorities. 
  4. Implementation of economic reforms. 
  5. Establishment of law and order, uncompromising struggle 
against corruption, terrorism, and illegal drugs business, and 
support for the law-enforcement bodies. 
  6. Securing Georgia's rightful place in the world and the 
Caucasus region. 
  7. State and military construction. 
  8. Refusal to resort to violence or to forging alliance with 
special services of foreign countries, and shunning social and 
other forms of destabilization in order to achieve political and 
other goals. 
  9. Solving all state issues constitutionally, and deciding 
the issue of power through elections or, if necessary, pre-term 
elections. 
  By achieving national consensus we will clearly demonstrate 
that the building of an independent and democratic state in 
Georgia is the unswerving will of the Georgian people, which 
they are capable of implementing. 
  Our aim is an independent, strong, single, and democratic 
Georgia, which we all must build in unity, accord, and respect 
for one another.

  [Text] Tallinn, May 25, BNS -- The first day of the Baltic 
Sea states' foreign ministers meeting yesterday didn't bring 
about an agreement in the Russian troop withdrawal deadline. 
  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev after his meeting 
with President Lennart Meri didn't give any definite assurances 
that the troops will be pulled out from Estonia by Aug. 31, 
1994, like Estonia and Western states insist. 
  Both Kozyrev and Meri, however, sounded optimistic. "I would 
like to sound as promising as possible because it is our common 
desire to open up a new page of relations," Kozyrev said after 
the meeting. 
  The Estonian president, too, said he had a "friendly and 
fruitful discussion" with Kozyrev about the still unsolved 
questions that Russia and Estonia need to resolve. 
  The two parties seem to have come closer on the main 
stumbling block, the issue of the 10,000 Russian military 
pensioners in Estonia. Estonia insists that most of retired 
servicemen should leave the country, whereas Russia has rejected 
this demand and is seeking social guarantees for the military 
retirees. 
  "I understand that the Estonian leadership is also 
determined 
and eager to look into the question of military pensioners in 
order to solve this too," the Russian foreign minister told 
reporters. 
  Meri said after the meeting both sides agreed that the 
military pensioners issue isn't linked with troop withdrawal. "I 
would like to add that we discussed in a very frank way the two 
problems which are not interlinked with each other," he said. 
  Kozyrev didn't comment on this statement, although Russia 
has 
previously always maintained the opposite. Even before his 
departure for Tallinn yesterday, the Russian foreign minister 
said the military pensioners issue is a part of the troop 
withdrawal question and that the two cannot be treated 
separately. 
  Meri also claimed Kozyrev "fully agrees that we will 
proceed" 
according to the Estonian legislation and government decisions. 
Yet it is those same laws and decisions that have earlier 
invited Russian protests because they don't guarantee that all 
retired servicemen may remain in Estonia. 
  Kozyrev said there are some difficulties in solving the 
military retirees issue. "Some of them are probably related to 
existing legislation and decisions," he said. 
  The Russian foreign minister wouldn't commit his country to 
a 
troop withdrawal deadline, but assured Russia wants to have the 
troops out as soon as possible. The speed of pullout depends on 
how quickly the problems can be ironed out, he said, and added 
that "there is still time to meet this deadline." 
  The Estonian president, on the other hand, claimed he hasn't 
the "slightest doubt" the troops will be withdrawn by the Aug. 
31, 1994 deadline. 
  At those words, Kozyrev simply grinned. 
  On his way to the presidential palace Kozyrev made an 
unscheduled stop on a Tallinn street corner where he spoke to 
city residents. He asked a Russian woman if she was happy with 
her life in Estonia. 
  "Life here is in some ways better than in Russia," she said, 
but complained that Estonian citizenship laws were too tough. 
  Other Russians the foreign minister spoke to grumbled about 
economic hardships caused by Estonia's radical free-market 
reforms. 
  An Estonian said he was afraid that Moscow might restore the 
former Soviet Union and reabsorb the Baltic states. 
  "Russia doesn't want to establish the old U.S.S.R. -- 
never," 
Kozyrev responded. 
  Some 2,500 Russian troops are still in Estonia, the only 
Baltic state that hasn't reached agreement with Russia on troop 
withdrawal. The 12,000 Russian military in Latvia will be pulled 
out from that Baltic nation by Aug. 31 according to the 
agreement signed April 30. Russian forces left Lithuania 
already last year. 
  Kozyrev's visit to the former Soviet republic was his first 
since Estonia regained its independence in 1991.

<F P=106> [From 26 May EESTI SENUMID, PAEVALEHT, p 1; "News Bulletin" </F>
No. 101/94] 
  [Text] Thursday, May 26 -- Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev defended the memorandum submitted by Russia and declared 
that Russia's attempts to develop "friendly and goodneighbourly 
relations with Estonia include the use of harsh terms". He also 
predicted that even harsher language would be used at his 
meeting with the Russian speakers in Tallinn. 
  The foreign minister told the listeners in the Slavic 
Culture 
Centre that Russia is developing a government programme for the 
aid and protection of the compatriots living abroad. A special 
commission will be formed, which could operate more efficiently 
than the Foreign Ministry with its diplomatic protocol. Kozyrev 
added that Russia is particularly interested in the pensioners' 
issue and problems of privatisation and enterprise. 
  He declared that the border issues will not be discussed and 
demanded that all retired military, including former KGB and GRU 
intelligence officers, must receive social guarantees as well as 
automatic citizenship. Describing the situation in Estonia, 
Kozyrev commented that, speaking as a private individual rather 
than a diplomat, he would have to ask for the ladies to leave 
the hall.

  [Text] Tallinn, May 25, BNS -- A general meeting of the 
Tallinn branch of Pro Patria yesterday decided to put forward 
parliament Chairman Ulo Nugis' name as new party chairman in 
preference over Prime Minister Mart Laar. 
  Most party members who spoke at the meeting criticized Laar 
and stated their support for Nugis. 
  The speakers voiced apprehension that, if Pro Patria 
continues under Laar's leadership, the party may not attain the 
5-percent threshold vote at the next parliamentary elections. 
  Nugis, too, was critical about the premier's performance and 
advised him to resign. 
  Pro Patria convenes in Tallinn June 11 to discuss election 
of 
new party chairman and the situation in the government and the 
ruling coalition. 
  The party council ruled on Monday [23 May] that election of 
new chairman doesn't automatically imply replacement of premier. 
Laar, on the other hand, asserted on Friday that he regards Pro 
Patria congress decisions as binding for himself. "If Pro Patria 
elects a new chairman I'll resign," he said.

<F P=106> [Statement by Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis over the </F>
phone from the United States on 25 May; from the "Labrit" 
program -- recorded] 
  [Text] There were three serious meetings with UN 
Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and members of the 
Security Council, and in the afternoon with U.S. President 
Clinton. 
  During all three meetings, the main issue was and remains 
the 
withdrawal of the Russian Army, its timetable, guarantees, and 
how not to allow, under any circumstances, this timetahle and 
these guarantees to be shaken in some way. I think that I 
received such guarantees in full from all three talks, and I 
would like to say today that there is no doubt that the troops 
will be withdrawn from Latvia in several months. 
  The second most important issue we discussed was the Skrunda 
radar station, what status it should have, how we will control 
the it, why there have to be guarantees so that after four 
years, the Skrunda will no longer be in Latvia, and so on and so 
on. All these issues caused rather lively discussions. So, for 
example, the United Nations Organization has not yet considered 
this issue seriously from the angle of guaranteeing the status 
of the Skrunda radar station. And during the talks with the 
Russian ambassador, we ascertained that after our talks in 
Russia, these instructions have, nevertheless, been (?brought) 
here and I think that within a few days, such guarantees will 
also be officially drawn up at the United Nations Organization. 
  The next issue was human rights, though this time it was no 
longer so acute and during the talks we were nowhere near to 
being reproached. I think that it is to a certain extent the 
success of both the Latvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 
Latvian diplomats that, with our stance on concluding the 
agreement with Russia, we showed both Latvian political maturity 
and Latvia's wish to listen to foreign states and to enter the 
world as a serious state with serious intentions, so that we 
never return to the system of CIS countries, which is being 
formed at the moment. But when we were speaking about human 
rights issues, we agreed then that this autumn, Hoze Lasso, high 
commissioner of the United Nations Organization, would visit the 
Nordic countries, Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia, to find out 
that human rights are no longer violated, nor have they ever 
been violated in the past. 
  We were talked a lot with UN leaders and with U.S. leaders 
about the necessity for both U.S. leaders and UN leaders to 
visit Latvia and find out how Latvia is developing and evolving. 
And I think that we have reached a certain agreement on these 
issues. Time will show which people will arrive and what they 
will give to Latvia. 
  With the U.S. President we not only talked about the 
agreement, but we also talked about future Latvian economic 
development. We said that to a certain extent American capital 
would have to come to Latvia, where the government would 
guarantee the use of the capital or would guarantee the 
inviolability of this capital, or something of the kind, so that 
the capital would be able to come more safely to the Baltic 
states. 
  And finishing this subject, I raised the issue of Estonia, 
because Baltic unity is of primary importance in all these 
issues. And I once again underlined that Latvia supports Estonia 
in all its requests. One of the issues I raised was the issue 
of the Paldiski base in Estonia, whose nuclear waste or nuclear 
energy may to a certain extent influence the future ecological 
and environmental protection situation in the Baltics. 
  While discussing Baltic security, we touched on three 
issues: 
the Skrunda radar station, the Paldiski base, and Kaliningrad -- 
because there is nowhere else in the world where there is such a 
level of concentration of armed forces, as in Kaliningrad. I 
think that we received some support from both the United Nations 
and the United States, and also from the Security Council. 
  And as a proposal for our future Latvian strategy, we 
brought 
up the issue that perhaps in two or three years, it would be 
necessary to hold in Latvia a summit meeting of all heads of 
government, at which issues of how to use all the funds left 
over from the reduction of militarism, from arms reduction, from 
the withdrawal of troops, and so on would be discussed; so that 
it will be possible to direct all these funds toward the 
protection of the environment. And, as we laughed with President 
Clinton, we would be able to set up a green program on a world 
scale, which would take the place of militarism, 
totalitarianism, and armament.

  [Text] Riga, May 25, BNS -- The Russia-based AL-KODS 
newspaper declines to retract an article accusing Latvian 
President Guntis Ulmanis of collaborating with the former Soviet 
security service. 
  The information that Ulmanis was a secret agent dubbed Hugo 
was given to the newspaper by a former Soviet Union KGB 
(Committee for National Security) employee, the paper's 
publisher Shaaban Hafiz Shaaban told BNS by telephone. 
  Shaaban, who is a Jordanian citizen, claimed that the 
information was "absolutely reliable" because the paper's staff 
had an opportunity to look into the respective documents, 
testifying Ulmanis' linkage to the notorious structure. 
  The name of the article's author, Ainars Vagris, is a 
pseudonym of a Russian-Latvian, Shaaban said. 
  As many as 3,000 copies of the AL-KODS newspaper are 
circulated in Latvia. The newspaper's title means "The Sacred 
City" and it aims, according to its motto, to "combat Zionism 
and its impact on the world politics and economy; to liberate 
Palestine from Zionist gangs." 
  The Moscow Chamber of Information Disputes said May 19 that 
AL-KODS was an unlawfully registered publication because the 
respective Russian laws barred foreign citizens from publishing 
activities. 
  To protest the article, the Latvian prosecutor general sent 
his Russian counterpart a letter on May 18 describing the 
publication as libel and injury to the honor and dignity of the 
Latvian president and the entire Latvian state institution. 
  Ulmanis himself has assessed the article as unprecedent 
provocation against the Latvian president and the Latvian state.

<F P=106> [Article by Liga Laizane: "Ten Organizations Were Refused </F>
Registration"] 
  [Text] Riga, 10 May -- The Latvian Ministry of Justice has 
refused to register approximately 10 social and political 
organizations whose statutes do not correspond with Latvian 
legislation. 
  As DIENA was informed by Maris Krumins, chief of the 
department for registration of mass information media and social 
organizations in the Ministry of Justice, this is not a large 
number, in comparison with the total number of registered 
organizations. Thus far, the Ministry has registered 763 social 
organizations, 134 foundations, 306 sports organizations, and 
35 political organizations. 
  Registration was denied on 19 July 1993 to the Latvian 
Communist Union [LKS] headed by Igor Lopatin, on the grounds 
that activities of a communist party in the Latvian Republic are 
forbidden. 
  On 9 August 1993, registration was also denied to the 
Latvian 
Union for Protection of Veterans [LVTAS], whose leader is 
Alberts Lebedevs. This organization was established, after the 
activity of the Council of War and Labor Veterans, which took an 
active part in the August coup, was forbidden on 10 September 
1991. 
  The LVTAS statutes state that it is a social organization 
uniting, on a voluntary basis, war veterans, retired and reserve 
officers, and Russian Army military personnel as well as civil 
staff of the military facilities, residing permanently in 
Latvia, and their family members. This organization also was a 
collective member of the Baltic Region Officers Union, which in 
turn is a member of an Russian officers association forbidden in 
Russia. 
  On 12 August 1993 the veteran organization applied to the 
court with a complaint against the Ministry of Justice, for 
refusing it registration. Until now, two court sessions have 
been held, and the third is due in late May. At their third 
annual conference on 19 March of the current year, the veterans 
mentioned as their main goal the registration of their 
organization. The organization is still active and comprises 
3,300 members, as DIENA learned at the conference. 
  The Ministry of Justice has also declined to register the 
recently established "League of the Apatrids [people without 
homeland]" [LAL]. The Minister of Justice Egils Levits states 
in the refusal that inhabitants who are not Latvian citizens 
cannot carry out political activities in the Latvian Republic. 
Nonetheless, LAL is setting as its goal the stimulation of the 
activities of the noncitizens in Latvia. In their appeal, they 
say that the goal of LAL is to integrate the noncitizens in 
Latvia and to serve as their representative. At the meeting on 
9 May, LAL disseminated a poll with the names of the candidates 
for the representative organ of the League. 
  Besides the above mentioned organizations, the Ministry of 
Justice refused to register a similar veteran organization in 
Liepaja, the 11th regiment of dragoons organized by lieutenant 
Mihail Ustinov, and the club for breeding "Gladiator" guard 
dogs. Also the organizations bearing the same name as those who 
already have been registered have been refused registration -- 
the second Liberal Party, and the second Latvian National 
Independent Movement.

  [Text] The air force commanders of the three Baltic states 
have agreed on cooperation in air space control and the training 
of air force pilots. An agreement signed at the Lithuanian 
Meskuiciai air force base confirms the intent to set up a joint 
air space control system. Representatives of the Baltic states 
note technical and financial advantages of such integration and 
the intention to join corresponding NATO structures. It will 
probably take 5 to 10 years to create a joint Baltic air space 
control system. 
  The Baltic representatives also decided to set up a joint 
training center for air force pilots in Lithuania. Estonian air 
force pilots took their first training flights on Lithuanian 
planes at Meskuiciai base today. 
  Lithuania's air force, with four L-39 jet training fighters 
of Czech production, two transport L-410 planes donated by 
Germany, and several dozen AN-2 planes and helicopters, is the 
strongest among the Baltic states and the most experienced. 
  Two of the four Lithuanian jet planes and one helicopter 
will 
demonstrate their combat skill on Saturday [28 May] on a 
military airfield near Riga during celebrations devoted to the 
75th anniversary of the Latvian air force.

  [Text] Vilnius, May 25, BNS -- The director of the 
Ignalina nuclear power plant, Viktor Shevaldin, categorically 
denied reports that an accident as if occurred at the plant. 
  Rumors about an accident reached Lithuania Wednesday [25 
May], first from Belarus and later from Latvia. Shevaldin even 
received telephone calls from the Belarussian atomic energy 
inspection. 
  "The rumors are completely groundless. Both reactors are at 
a standstill and there were no accidents," Shevaldin told BNS. 
  Ignalina's first reactor is still undergoing maintenance 
repairs which started March 26. The second reactor was shut 
down April 12 when excess energy appeared at Latvian 
hydroelectric power stations. 
  Shevaldin said neither of Ignalina's reactors should be 
started earlier than June 20 and added that public announcements 
will be made in advance. 
  Povilas Vaisnys, head of the Lithuanian Atomic Energy Safety 
Inspection, said the rumors that were set afloat Wednesday are 
"misinformation," which may be related to political process in 
one of the neighboring countries that he did not specify. The 
official said "it's all quiet at the Ignalina nuclear plant."

  [Text] Local elections will be regarded as having taken 
place when at least one-fourth of the electors participate. 
  The Seimas did not pass today the whole law on local 
elections, but established during the voting on individual 
articles of the law that the elections will be valid when 25 
percent of the electors participate. 
  Local elections should take place this autumn or winter. The 
candidates for the elections may be nominated by political 
parties and political organizations. This rule is opposed by 
the Union of Lithuanian Poles, which organized a picket at the 
Seimas building today. The picketers demanded that public 
organizations of the national minorities be allowed to take part 
in the Seimas and local elections. They said in a statement 
that no national minority in Lithuania has its political party 
but takes part in political life through its public organization.

<F P=106> [Undated "Statement by the Press Center of Ukraine's </F>
Ministry of Foreign Affairs"] 
  [Text] On 20 May 1994, the Crimean Supreme Council adopted 
the law "On the Restoration of the Constitutional Principles of 
the Crimean Republic's Statehood" having thereby made an attempt 
to restore the Crimean Constitution in its 6 May 1992 variant. 
This law is unconstitutional and illegal. It leads to an 
exacerbation of interethnic tension on the peninsula and in 
Ukraine as a whole and raises the question of the legal status 
of the Crimean Republic as a constituent part of Ukraine. This 
creates a direct threat to Ukraine's territorial integrity and 
peace and stability in the region. 
  In this connection, Ukraine's Minister of Foreign Affairs 
A.M. Zlenko sent letters to the UN secretary general, the 
chairman of the Security Council, the chairman of the CSCE, 
NATO's general secretary, leaders of other international 
organizations, and ministers of foreign affairs of foreign 
countries. In his letters, the head of Ukraine's external 
political department stresses, in particular, that this illegal 
decision, provoked by the irresponsible course pursued by the 
present Crimean leadership and aimed at undermining Ukraine's 
constitutional power and its territorial integrity cannot be 
qualified in any other terms than an open attempt on the part of 
separatist forces to weaken the internal political stability in 
Ukraine and provoke tension in the Ukrainian- Russian relations. 
This creates a threat to peace and stability in the region and 
in the whole of Europe, something which may have far-reaching 
negative consequences, in view of the present complicated 
situation in this part of the continent. 
  Today those European countries, which are participants in 
the 
CSCE, have admitted the exceptional importance unconditionally 
to maintain and strengthen the principles of territorial 
integrity and inviolability of existing borders, as a guarantee 
for European peace and security. Such separatist aspirations on 
the part of the leadership of the Crimean Republic may result in 
further erosion of these fundamental principles underlying 
European stability. In the case of a further escalation of the 
situation as a result of the irresponsible steps by the 
extremist forces in the Crimea, Ukraine reserves the right to 
take all the necessary measures for an unconditional protection 
of the state's territorial integrity in conformity with its 
constitution and current legislation and with an adherence to 
the norms of international law.

  [Text] Kiev, 25 May -- Ukrainian Internal Affairs Minister 
Andriy Vasylyshyn has delivered an address to the leadership and 
all personnel of internal affairs agencies in Crimea. 
  The address reads, in particular: "The non-performance by 
the 
Crimean autonomy's authorities of the Ukrainian presidential 
directives and their deliberate disregard for Ukraine's 
Constitution and legislation are causing tension in the 
situation on the peninsula. All this is increasing pressure on 
the personnel of internal affairs agencies". 
  The Ukrainian Internal Affairs Ministry's collegium regrets 
that Crimean militiamen have to work "under difficult conditions 
which were artificially created," the minister points out. "We 
hope that the necessary decisions will be taken in the very near 
future, with the help of people's deputies of Ukraine and the 
Republic of Crimea, to stabilize the situation in Crimea." 
  The minister's appeal makes the following requests: 
  "To convey to members of staff our certainty that the bodies 
of internal affairs in Crimea will further remain within the 
single structure of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine; 
  "To remain calm, confident, and loyal to their oath, to 
prevent the illegal use of arms, to treat citizens with respect, 
to strictly abide by laws when detaining citizens and making 
them answerable, and to prevent violations of the administrative 
legislation; 
  "To step up the struggle against crime and its most 
organized 
forms, to restore order in the streets and in public places, and 
in so doing to pay special attention to instructing special duty 
squads at a high professional level; 
  "To establish efficient interaction with the Main 
Directorate 
of the Security Service of Ukraine in Crimea, the procurator's 
office, the subunits of the National Guard and military units, 
and with other departments with the aim of improving adherence 
to law and order and legality in Crimea. 
  "Today peace and accord and citizens' security in Crimea are 
in your hands. Do not let yourselves get involved in political 
games."

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Karmalito] </F>
  [Text] Simferopol 25 May TASS -- Crimean President Yuriy 
Meshkov welcomed the latest developments in relations between 
the Crimea and Ukraine as hope-inspiring. 
  In an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS on Wednesday [25 
May], Meshkov said that the road to a compromise lies between 
the search for mutual understanding through bilateral 
negotiations and destructive policy pursued by Kiev. 
  Attempts by certain Ukrainian circles to provoke 
confrontation in the Crimea have failed. The negotiation 
process has been set in motion in order to bring together the 
positions of the two sides and find solutions to the existing 
problems and conflicts, Meshkov said. 
  He noted that Kiev continues its policy aimed at undermining 
executive power in the Crimea and destabilising the situation in 
the Republic. 
  Speaking about the decision to set up a working commission 
of 
Ukrainian and Crimean deputies to iron out disagreements, 
Meshkov expressed hope that the reached "elementary 
understanding" will be preserved. 
  "We have outlined an array of measures which both sides are 
ready to carry out. This is a step forward towards solving the 
existing problems," he added. 
  Asked about the Russian-Ukrainian talks on the Black Sea 
Fleet, the Crimean leader stressed that it would be "somewhat 
premature" to make assessments because there have been no 
official reports about the results of the talks.

<F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report under the general heading: "Crimea: Talks </F>
in Progress; No Easing of Tension"] 
  [Text] The formation of a 2,500 to 3,000-strong Ukrainian 
National Guard brigade is continuing in Crimea. This is what 
Major General Valeriy Kuznetsov, Republic of Crimea internal 
affairs minister, told an ITAR-TASS correspondent yesterday in 
an exclusive interview. 
  V. Kuznetsov pointed out that this military buildup is 
"unnecessary and atypical" of Crimea, which is already "awash 
with military formations and combat equipment." At the same 
time, he noted, Ukraine is indoctrinating and sounding out army 
units on the matter of the personnel's willingness to take 
practical action in the event of the introduction of a state of 
emergency in Crimea.

  [Text] Speaker of the Crimean Parliament Sergey Tsekov says 
Simferopol would be prepared to settle for a power sharing 
agreement with Kiev similar to that between Russia and 
Tatarstan. In a speech in Kiev late on Tuesday [24 May], he 
called for the adoption of one sweeping act to settle 
differences between Ukraine and Crimea. 
  Tsekov believes that the current tension follows not only 
Simferopol's recent decisions, but also a string of inconsistent 
political moves towards Crimea over the past 18 months. 
  He said that under the Republic's constitution of 6 May 
1992, 
Crimea is part of Ukraine and "that's all there is to it." 
  Parliamentary delegations on both sides ended talks in Kiev 
late on Tuesday by deciding to offer their legislatures to set 
up a joint working group to iron out differences. 
  In the meantime, a Ukrainian parliamentary commission has 
given the Crimean parliament three more days in which to repeal 
its resolution of last Friday to restore the Republic's 1992 
Constitution.

results of the negotiations between the Crimean and Ukrainian 
legislative delegations in Kiev, Supreme Soviet Chairman Serhiy 
Tsekov suggested electing a working group to continue 
negotiations and to search for coordinated (?decisions). Five 
lawmakers were elected and will reinforce the group according to 
their own discretion. 
  The session then resumed a discussion of issues included on 
the agenda adopted earlier. The deputies heard a report by 
Crimean Deputy Prime Minister Yevheny Saburov on ways to 
overcome the bitter economic crisis. Special emphasis was 
placed on the problem of investments, privatization, and 
banking. Yevheny Saburov then answered deputies' questions.

    [Editorial Report] Kiev Ukrayinske Radio First Program 
Network in Ukrainian at 1205 GMT on 25 May carries a 40-minute 
"Independence" program moderated by Alla Storozhenko and 
attended by People's Deputy Borys Oliynyk, head of the Ukrainian 
Supreme Council commission, and People's Deputy Yuriy Kostenko, 
member of the commission, who participated in the 24 May 
Ukrainian-Crimean negotiations. 
  Borys Oliynyk begins by denying mass media reports that the 
situation in Crimea is critical. He says that the Supreme 
Council commission had been set up and had met the Crimean 
delegation to "receive first-hand information" on the situation 
in the peninsula. According to Oliynyk, Crimean representatives 
assured him that the situation in Crimea is "under control." 
This was confirmed by "appropriate Ukrainian functionaries." 
Oliynyk says that "the problem should be resolved on an 
interstate level." In his opinion the Ukrainian delegation 
applied a "proper benevolent approach" in its talks with Crimean 
counterparts and "managed, to some extent, to halt the 
development of processes undesirable for Ukraine, Crimea, all 
the neighbors, and the world community." 
  Yuriy Kostenko confirms that the parties were trying "to 
find 
solutions and avoid accusations, because everybody understood 
the responsibility for the situation." Kostenko then quotes 
head of Crimean delegation Serhiy Tsekov who presented the 
situation in Crimea as "complex, however devoid of traits 
depicted by the mass media." Tsekov reportedly denied reports 
that Ukraine is building up its military presence in that 
region. According to Tsekov, "a war of laws" is being waged 
between Crimea and Ukraine, but the actual situation is 
"absolutely different" from that depicted in Russian mass media. 
Tsekov said that he had held a news conference in Crimea aimed 
to "alleviate tension built up by media reports." 
  Tsekov is quoted as having said that "a number of Crimean 
problems demanded that this kind of resolution be passed by the 
Crimean legislature." According to Tsekov, these are "bitter 
economic problems," opposition against "the isolationist policy 
of the Ukrainian leadership," and the Meshkov party's desire to 
live up to their pre-election commitments. Tsekov reportedly 
said that the issue of dual citizenship is "extremely urgent" 
for the Crimeans. 
  Rejecting claims about Ukraine's isolationism Kostenko, who 
was a member of the delegation at the Ukrainian-Russian 
negotiations on the Black Sea Fleet, says that it was often due 
to the rigid stance of the Russians that agreements were not 
reached on certain issues of contention. Among all the reasons 
that allegedly prompted the adoption of the legal acts by the 
Crimean legislature, Kostenko singles out the fact that Meshkov 
and his accomplices are trying to carry out their electoral 
promises and adds: "This problem cannot be resolved by the 
Ukrainian Supreme Council without goodwill on the part of the 
other party." 
  Oliynyk points out certain ambiguities in the Ukrainian 
Constitution which permit dubious interpretation of certain 
provisions. He asserts that the two sides "regulate their laws 
so as to make them explicit." He adds that it should be stated 
that Ukraine is an independent sovereign state, while Crimea is 
an autonomous territory. According to Oliynyk, the fact that 
Crimean legal acts contradict Ukrainian laws and the 
Constitution was written down in a joint communique issued by 
the two parties. Ukraine, in its turn, acknowledged "the 
inefficiency of decisions regarding Crimea, passed by Ukraine's 
superior bodies of power." Speaking about Crimea's economic 
problems, Oliynyk cites the figure of "hundreds of billions 
karbovantsi" earmarked by Ukraine for the needs of the 
peninsula. The Ukrainian delegation suggested that a working 
group be set up to coordinate mutual claims and "put our 
relations in order." 
  Kostenko quotes Article 70 of the Ukrainian Constitution, 
which envisions that Ukraine's territory cannot be changed 
without the Ukrainian people's consent. The issue of Crimean 
secession can be resolved solely by means of a nationwide 
referendum. Kostenko says that the only way to resolve the 
situation is "to suspend the validity of acts destabilizing the 
legal situation in Ukraine." Kostenko brings up the fact that 10 
days have been given to bring the Crimean Constitution in line 
with Ukrainian laws. Five days have elapsed and if nothing is 
done in the remaining period of time "the Ukrainian president 
will take steps to protect Ukraine's territorial integrity." 
Crimean bodies of power are forming their own army, 
subordinating law-enforcement agencies, and the like. Kostenko 
stresses that "Ukrainian and Crimean executive bodies may 
overstep the limit behind which a peaceful solution will be 
practically impossible." The two delegations agreed to address 
their legislatures with appeals to suspend the observance of 
their decisions so that a coordinating group has time to draft 
proposals on how to appease the conflict. Kostenko points out 
that "although everybody seemed to agree to this option in 
private talks"..."the Crimean delegation refused to address its 
legislature." Kostenko adds that the Crimean Supreme Soviet is 
to discuss the issue of suspending the validity of its decisions 
at its 26 May session. 
  Evaluating the results of talks, Oliynyk says that one 
statement was approved by both delegations: "The Ukrainian 
Supreme Council Commission suggests that the Ukrainian Supreme 
Council and the Crimean Supreme Soviet discuss within three days 
the issue of suspending the validity of acts adopted on 20 May 
1994 for the period of activities of the joint working group." 
In Oliynyk's opinion, the two delegations did what they could 
in light of current realities. 
  Kostenko points out that Refat Chubarov, a representative of 
Crimean Tatars, attended the negotiations and stressed that "the 
optimal solution for all the ethnic groups residing in Crimea is 
autonomy within the Ukrainian state." 
  Completing the program, Oliynyk says that he believes in a 
"positive outcome" of the developments incited by "political 
profiteers." Kostenko adds that once Ukraine's economic 
problems are resolved there will be no grounds for Crimeans' 
discontent. The other important factor determining further 
development of events is Russia's stance. Kostenko believes 
that if Russia abandons its policy of inciting the conflict, the 
latter "will have no future."

<F P=106> [Interview with Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy </F>
by Anatoliy Smetanin: "The Army Will Defend the Homeland and 
Its Sovereignty and Integrity"] 
  [Text] [Smetanin] What instructions have you received from 
the supreme commander in chief regarding the Crimean crisis? 
What are the Army's actions in this complex situation? 
  [Radetskyy] We have received clear and distinct 
instructions: to keep to the Ukrainian law and Constitutions in 
all our actions and perform our basic functions -- defend our 
Homeland and its sovereignty and integrity. 
  In the Crimea, 32d Army Corps, Ukrainian Navy, air force and 
anti-aircraft units are stationed... They operate in a regular 
mode, except that their commanders were instructed to reinforce 
protection of the command stations and depots with ammunition, 
equipment, and arms. And I tell you, this measure was not 
overreaction. 
  On 19 May, Lieutenant General Mikhail Lopatin, anti-aircraft 
force commander, reported to me that in the vicinity of 
Sevastopol, where the command station of one of the 
anti-aircraft combined units is located, 18 camouflaged men, 
driving a GAZ-66 truck, attempted to seize this station. They 
were politely shown out. 
  The commander also reported his conversation with one of the 
Crimean President Meshkov's aides who asked what would be the 
reaction of the Ukrainian anti-aircraft force if certain 
airplanes or helicopters attempted to land in the Crimea. There 
could be only one answer: the most harshest measures would be 
applied to them. In other words, they want to test the reaction 
of our Armed Forces. We will do our best to make sure that our 
skies are clear. 
  [Smetanin] Did you talk about the Crimean issue with your 
Russian counterpart? 
  [Radetskyy] What does Pavel Grachev have to do with 
developments in the Crimea? Nothing. It is as if I asked him: 
how are things in, for example, in Kaliningrad or Ussuriysk? 
The Crimea is in Ukrainian territory, so it is our business. 
  Another thing is how you cover the events. The Black Sea 
Fleet press center, headed by Grachev's namesake who stirs up 
emotions and provides false information, is by no means an 
example to follow. No one else but the center sent a wire to 
Ostankino (containing, however, the request not to make public 
its contents) claiming that there are 1,000 Ukrainian special 
troops allegedly stationed in Bilbek and that movement of tank 
columns and armored personnel carriers can be observed... 
  We heard about this information, or more precisely, 
disinformation. No tanks, planes, or APCs were used in 
connection with the situation in the Crimea. 
  [Smetanin] The Crimean situation forced many parties and 
movements to reveal their position on the issue and suggestions 
how to resolve it. For example, Rukh considers it necessary to 
suspend transportation of our nuclear weapons to Russia. What 
is your opinion? 
  [Radetskyy] I am a military man. The transportation of those 
weapons is carried out according to the trilateral agreement by 
the presidents of Ukraine, Russia, and the United States. We 
drafted the transportation schedule and strictly follow it. 
Only the Supreme Council can change it or halt this process. 
We will implement its decisions -- all to the last letter. 
This is why I will not comment on that kind of statements. 
  In all my time as defense minister, I have never judged any 
parties or movements, because I believe that the Army should 
stay away from it. We are grateful to their leadership for 
their understanding of our, let us say, neutrality. 
  [Smetanin] You said that tension in the Crimea is generated 
by the presence of the Black Sea Fleet there. Will, and when, 
the negotiations be continued on this issue? 
  [Radetskyy] The negotiations will certainly be continued. It 
is in our interests that the Black Sea knot be untied. The most 
important thing here is to determine the fleet's status. Now, 
it is considered to be a kind of common fleet, subordinate to 
the Ukrainian and Russian presidents. But as a matter of fact, 
it is ruled by Russia. We should clearly divide it into the 
Ukrainian and Russian fleets and deem the latter the fleet of a 
foreign state with all consequences of this. 
  We will soon come up with our proposals to start 
negotiations. 
  [Smetanin] Do you not think that those negotiations cannot 
be 
held in the Crimea? 
  [Radetskyy] I absolutely agree with you, because it would 
bring nothing but political fights. The delegations should meet 
in some neutral place.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko and </F>
Mikhail Melnik] 
  [Text] Kiev, 25 May -- "Personnel of the Security Service's 
Main Directorate in Crimea are continuing to carry out their 
duties of protecting the security of the state in a precise and 
organized manner, in spite of the difficult political situation 
that has arisen around the regional branch of the special 
service." Thus, reads a release for the mass media circulated 
today by the press center of the Ukrainian Security Service. 
  The main task for staff of the Ukrainian Security Service's 
Main Directorate is vigorously to campaign against corruption 
and organized crime, to protect the region's economy from 
criminal violations, and to maintain peace and calm in the 
Republic of Crimea, the document stresses. Furthermore, the 
Security Service is closely collaborating with the internal 
affairs and procuracy bodies. The requirement to provide the 
president, the leaders of the parliament, and the Supreme Soviet 
of Crimea, and local authorities with full and objective 
information in the interests of resolving the autonomous 
republic's vital issues also remains in force.

<F P=106> [Report by Yuriy Selivanov from Odessa under the "Ukraine" </F>
rubric: "In What Mountains Is Vitaliy Radetskiy Going To Fight? 
Army Exercises Have Taken Place in the Carpathians"] 
  [Text] The Carpathian-based mountain training center of 
the Ukrainian Army has engaged the personal attention of 
Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskiy. In mid-May he 
attended the combat training drills of motorized infantry, tank 
and artillery units that were held in the mountains. The 
minister was displeased with the degree of his subordinates' 
readiness to operate in mountainous terrain and recommended that 
unit commanders "place particular emphasis" on the subject. 
Curiously, the last time close attention was paid to the 
troops' mountain training was at the beginning of the 1980s, 
when the Soviet Army invaded Afghanistan and effectively proved 
themselves unable to counter the mujahidin operating in local 
mountains. 
  It seems unlikely, however, that the Ukrainian Army is 
planning a new march to Kabul. Still, the mountain ambitions of 
the Kiev minister are entirely explicable if one recalls that 
the sole mountainous area on Ukrainian territory excepting the 
Carpathians is the Crimean peninsula. The stepped-up mountain 
training of Ukrainian Army units could be interpreted as a clear 
sign of Kiev's comprehensive preparations for the forcible 
settlement of the Crimean problem. Moreover, one should realize 
that so specific and purposeful an activity by the Defense 
Ministry indicates that the stage of making a political decision 
in principle on the matter is long past. Apparently, it is the 
existence of a specific mission that explains Mr. Radetskiy's 
concern over the state of the troops' mountain training. 
  However, one cannot read without a smile a report by the 
Kiev-based GOLOS UKRAINY newspaper which, while analyzing the 
Ukrainian troops' combat readiness, cites an inadequate grasp of 
the state language by soldiers and officers as one of the main 
reasons for the drawbacks exposed, something that "jeopardizes 
the command and control of troops." I think that the Ukrainian 
journalists' fears about a lack of command and control of troops 
are somewhat exaggerated. Vitaliy Radetskiy and all his 
subordinates have a perfect grasp of Russian, in which they 
actually express themselves when discussing any more or less 
serious matters.

<F P=106> [Undated "Statement by the Press Service of Ukraine's </F>
Ministry of Defense"] 
  [Text] The Russian mass media continue disseminating 
gossip [plitky] on the concentration of Ukrainian troops in the 
areas of Sevastopol and Simferopol. Open lies are carried with 
references to Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation 
Pavel Grachev and this, mildly speaking, gives rise to surprise. 
It only remains to wonder whether this is yet another political 
trick on the part of the Russian military ministry or its habit 
to rely upon dubious information sources. 
  Moreover, General Grachev makes statements whose content 
indicates that the Black Sea Fleet is commanded by the Defense 
Ministry of the Russian Federation. Besides, the fleet receives 
orders and directives from the Russian military department. 
Recently, Pavel Grachev ordered to decisively "counter all 
provocative actions with regard to the Black Sea Fleet 
facilities...." 
  The Press Service of Ukraine's Ministry of Defense is 
authorized to state that the interference by the Ministry of 
Defense of the Russian Federation into the affairs of the united 
Black Sea Fleet, which, in accordance with the Yalta accord, is 
directly subordinated to the presidents of Ukraine and Russia, 
impedes a civilized resolution of the problem of dividing the 
fleet and creates a dangerous tension in the Crimea.

  [Text] Moscow, 25 May -- The all-hands assembly of fleet 
commanders in Sevastopol, which, according to some Ukrainian 
mass media, provoked a negative response in Kiev, is not linked 
to the recent events in Crimea. According to the press center 
of the Black Sea Fleet, the commanders of formations, groupings, 
and units gathered today at the headquarters of the Black Sea 
Fleet to sum up the results of winter training. It was noted at 
a sitting of the military council that the fleet had 
successfully carried out its tasks in the past six months and 
was prepared to implement the programs of summer training. 
  The sitting of the military council devoted particular 
attention to the problem of injuries of servicemen during 
military training and operating the equipment.

  [Text] The distribution of iodine preparations to families 
in Chernihiv Oblast created panic among the population. In view 
of that, a news conference was held at which presidential 
representative in the oblast Valentyn Melnychuk stated that it 
had been a purely preventive measure, which had nothing to do 
with a "new" accident at the Chernobyl Atomic Electric Power 
Plant [AES]. Serhiy Parashyn, general director of the plant, 
assured journalists that his collective had "rendered such an 
accident impossible." In his opinion, the idea of closing down 
the Chernobyl AES has been artificially spread at the initiative 
of certain circles in the West. The people who are mainly 
interested in this are those trying to obtain funds from 
Ukraine's budget for implementing expensive projects.

  [Text] Kiev, 24 May -- Opposition leader Vyacheslav 
Chornovil, said that what had taken place during a closed 
parliamentary session was a communist coup carried out under the 
leadership of Supreme Council Chairman Oleksandr Moroz. In his 
view, the election of deputy chairmen of the Supreme Council was 
carried out with numerous procedural violations, without 
announcing a continuation of plenary sittings of the Supreme 
Council, and the discussion of candidates lasted for only 30 
seconds. 
  As the leader of Rukh said during a conversation with a 
UNIAR 
correspondent, the Supreme Council Secretariat was not issuing 
copies of the verbatim record of the sitting to representatives 
of the Center group and the right-wing bloc. Chornovil believes 
that the possibility of falsifying the record exists. 
Representatives of four deputies' groups, Rukh, Center, Reform, 
and Statehood protested against the violation and said they were 
not prepared to take part in plenary sittings unless the 
election is declared invalid. Mr. Chornovil also said that 
obviously, deputies of the Center group and right of center 
groups would have to refuse to participate in forming the 
Cabinet of Ministers.

  [Text] United Nations, 25 May -- Ukraine is calling upon 
the United Nations to support its possible actions in Crimea "to 
ensure unconditionally the territorial integrity of the state." 
Thus runs a letter from Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy 
Zlenko to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali which was 
distributed today as a General Assembly and Security Council 
document. 
  "On 20 May 1994, the Supreme Rada of the Republic of Crimea 
adopted a decision on re-enforcing the constitution of the 
Republic of Crimea of 6 May 1992. This act is aimed at changing 
the legal status of the autonomous republic as a component part 
of Ukraine," it indicates the document points out. Having 
described these actions by the Crimean parliament as "a 
violation of the Constitution of Ukraine," A. Zlenko stated that 
"a threat is thereby being created to peace and stability in the 
region and in Europe as a whole." 
  The minister expressed the hope that "the UN secretary 
general will personally show understanding and support" for the 
actions of the government of Ukraine in "averting the possible 
negative consequences of the anti-constitutional decision 
adopted by the Supreme Rada of Crimea." In the event of a 
deterioration in the situation, Ukraine reserves the right to 
take all the necessary measures to provide for the territorial 
integrity of the state, the document stresses.

  [Text] Kiev [no dateline as received] -- UNIAN has already 
reported that Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy is 
continuing his official visit to the NATO headquarters in 
Brussels. Ukraine's Defense Ministry press service has announced 
that Vitaliy Radetskyy spoke at a conference of North Atlantic 
Council member countries' defense ministers today. The 
Ukrainian defense minister emphasized, in particular, that 
"overcoming artificial isolation from Europe and returning 
Ukraine to the range of leading European states" was one of the 
most important tasks in Ukraine's military political course. 
  Vitaliy Radetskyy also said that Ukraine was in favor of 
creating a versatile all-European system of security on the 
basis of existing international institutions. Ukraine's 
immediate membership in these structures will provide the 
necessary external guarantees of its national security. The 
Ukrainian defense minister pointed out that Ukraine did not see 
any reasons why CIS countries could not join the "Partnership 
for Peace" program. "It would also be desirable if Russia were 
among the partnership members. The footing, however, should 
undoubtedly be equal for all," said the Ukrainian defense 
minister. 
  The press service of Ukraine's Defense Ministry reported 
that 
Vitaliy Radetskyy met U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry and 
David Collenette, Canadian national defense minister, and 
discussed issues of military cooperation and developments in 
Crimea with them. The Defense Ministry's press service added 
that both William Perry and David Collenette expressed concern 
at the escalation of tension in Crimea, highly commended 
Ukraine's balanced and constructive position on normalizing the 
situation, and confirmed respect for the territorial integrity 
of Ukraine. 
  Also today, the Ukrainian defense minister met George 
Joulwan, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander in Europe.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vitaliy Makarchev] </F>
  [Text] Kiev 25 May TASS -- The implementation by Ukraine of 
the international agreement which obliges it to transfer its 
nuclear weapons to Russia is a separate issue and must not be 
connected with other problems, British Foreign Secretary Douglas 
Hurd said. 
  During his talks with Ukrainian top officials Hurd said that 
ten days ago EU [European Union] leaders discussed ways to 
expand ties between Brussels and Kiev and ensure control over of 
Ukraine's's part of the Soviet nuclear arsenal. 
  Despite attempts by some EU countries to interconnect these 
two issues, the European Council decided not to condition the 
signing of a comprehensive cooperation agreement with Ukraine on 
the full withdrawal of nuclear weapons from its territory, Hurd 
said. He also called Kiev to join as soon as possible the 
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
  Ukraine's participation in the treaty is very important not 
because the European Union is suspicious of Ukraine, but because 
it is much more concerned about the reaction to the current 
state of affairs from the countries seeking to obtain nuclear 
weapons, he said. 
  He said the EU believes the assurances received from 
Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk and his government that the 
agreement on the withdrawal of nuclear weapons will be strictly 
observed. He emphasised that neither Britain nor the European 
Union link the withdrawal of nuclear weapons with any of the 
existing problem. 
  Hurd called on the Ukrainian Parliament to give guarantees 
of 
the implementation of the agreement. Parliament Chairman 
Aleksandr Moroz assured Hurd that the lawmakers are strongly 
against nuclear weapons in Ukraine. 
  The British foreign secretary noted that there is only one 
way to solve the nuclear problem in Ukraine -- strictly observe 
and implement the agreement on the withdrawal of nuclear weapons.

  [Text] During the two days of negotiations the Ukrainian 
and Russian delegations have never reached a mutually agreed 
decision on the Black Sea Fleet. After the consultations of the 
heads of the Ukrainian and Russian Governments with Ukraine's 
President Leonid Kravchuk, the first variant of a joint document 
appeared under a conventional title agreement between the 
governments of Ukraine and the Russian Federation on the first 
stage of settling the Black Sea Fleet issues. It is unclear as 
yet what the second, the third, and the subsequent stages will 
be, and how many stages at all are to follow. 
  Experts worked up this agreement. However, none of the sides 
was satisfied with the last variant, despite the fact that the 
delegations were trying to find a compromise solution. 
  According to Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy 
Shmarov, 
the stands have been brought closer to each other. However, 
there are key points that we failed to solve. Only mutual 
respect for the laws of both countries can lead to a concrete 
result, he pointed out. 
  Sevastopol became a stumbling block. The Russian side refers 
to it in the document as the main base of the Russian Black Sea 
Fleet, claiming its right to the whole city, where there will be 
no place for Ukrainian sailors and ships. 
  Ukraine is ready to grant Russia the base in Sevastopol; but 
it does not agree to give up the whole city for the base. 
Besides, as Ukraine's Acting Prime Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy 
said, Russia insists that the entire shore-based infrastructure 
should be passed to it, something Ukraine cannot agree to, which 
is only natural. 
  Unexpected for the Ukrainian side was also the solution of 
the issue on dividing the ships that came up at the previous 
meeting in Sevastopol. This has been reported by Colonel 
General Ivan Bizhan, Ukrainian deputy defense minister. The 
Russians declared that Ukraine had already received a certain 
part of the ships apportioned to it, proceeding at this point 
from the very understated data on the current quantitative 
composition of the Black Sea Fleet. With such an apportioning 
offered by Russia, Ukraine will receive only a minimum of the 
ships and will be deprived of the entire shore-based 
infrastructure. In the end, it will cease to be the master of 
its own land. 
  Despite a number of nonessential differences, the 
delegations 
again took their seats at the negotiating table today.

<F P=106> ["Own Information" report: "Friendship Is All Very Well, </F>
but Let's Keep Our Smokes to Ourselves. The West Is in No Hurry 
To Allow Russia Access to Advanced Technologies"] 
  [Text] Another pillar of the Cold War -- the notorious 
COCOM [Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls] 
-- is apparently not long for this world. Having existed for 44 
years, it formally ceased to operate at the end of March. It is 
therefore natural to ask: What happens now, what can Russia 
expect now that it has suffered from COCOM's sundry bans and 
restrictions? 
  U.S. Department of State spokesman Mike McCurry announced 
that this matter was discussed in detail during a meeting 
between U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev in Vladivostok. It is also the 
focus of attention at the U.S.-Russian consultations currently 
being held at expert level and "at the highest level." It is 
expected that Russia will be able to take part in all aspects of 
the new international agreement on export control procedures 
which is to replace COCOM. 
  It is intended to formulate this procedure by October this 
year. But for the time being, the Department of State spokesman 
indicated, the 17 COCOM member countries "have agreed to retain 
during the transitional period the potential to exercise control 
at national level over the trade in goods appearing on COCOM's 
lists." At the same time members have been instructed to apply 
national export laws and display extreme vigilance regarding 
trade in products which could have serious consequences if 
supplied. In other words, during the entire transitional period 
-- until October -- and in the interests of national security 
(of the United States, Japan, and the other COCOM member 
states), a tough licensing policy will be retained in respect of 
anything that has been manufactured using complex technologies. 
  M. McCurry explained that we should not expect to see any 
changes regarding control of exports to the DPRK and the 
delivery of military technologies to Russia and China. Nor 
should countries which support terrorism entertain any rosy 
hopes. The new licensing rules will be introduced almost solely 
with regard to telecommunications equipment designed for 
civilian use. 
  Let us remind readers that the list of products banned by 
COCOM for export to former communist bloc countries includes 150 
items which now need to be reviewed. However, according to data 
in the JAPAN TIMES, this will not apply to approximately 10 
categories of state-of-the-art dual-purpose technologies and 
materials. These include coding devices and heat-resistant and 
highly porous composite materials and coverings used in the 
aerospace industry, for example in the manufacture of Stealth 
aircraft. 
  Regarding the structure and tasks of the new international 
organ, the newspaper stresses that it is primarily designed to 
counter the dangerous proliferation of weapons in Third World 
countries such as Libya and Iraq whose actions pose a threat to 
the world community. 
  In the opinion of William Raynsh [surname as 
transliterated], 
who has been appointed U.S. deputy secretary of commerce by 
President Clinton, Russia and the other former Soviet republics 
are unlikely to be among the founders of the new organization. 
We expect these countries, he indicated, to try to achieve the 
same objectives using their own export control systems, and they 
will be able to join our organization in the future. 
  So is COCOM on the way out? It is, but only to remain in 
place, it seems: So control-free times are not just around the 
corner.

<F P=106> [From 26 May EESTI SENUMID, RAHVA HAAL, PAEVALEHT, </F>
HOMMIKULEHT, p 1,3; "News Bulletin" No. 101/94] 
  [Text] Thursday, May 26 -- The foreign ministers' meeting 
of the Baltic Sea Countries ended yesterday with the passing of 
a joint communique stating considerable development of the 
political contacts and economic cooperation of the member 
states. The communique calls for turning the Baltic Sea area 
into a region of special economic growth. 
  The ministers expressed support to the EU-Baltic free trade 
negotiations and hoped that a friendship and cooperation 
agreement between the EU and Russia could be concluded soon. 
  More attention was paid to improved cooperation in transport 
and energetics, especially in the use of seaports. The need for 
simplified border crossing procedures was also stressed. 
  The communique welcomed democratic reforms in the Baltic 
states, Poland and Russia, stressed the importance of the troops 
withdrawal from Lithuania and Latvia and reiterated the "speedy, 
complete and orderly withdrawal" demand. The dismantling of the 
Russian nuclear reactors in Paldiski and technical and legal aid 
to the process was mentioned. 
  The statute of the Euro-faculties was approved and it was 
decided to open another faculty in the Kaliningrad region. 
  The Baltic Sea Countries Council senior officials committee 
is to consider the forming of a permanent secretariat. The 
meeting will also consider Iceland's appeal to join the council. 
  Poland was elected next chairman country of the Council. 
The foreign ministers' meeting established the post of another 
human rights commissioner. Danish lawyer Ole Espersen was 
appointed Special Commissioner for Democratic Institutions and 
Human Rights. 
  Espersen commented that his tasks include the protection of 
human rights and ethnic minorities and added that private 
individual, groups of persons and organisations are free to 
appeal to the commissioner. But he pointed out that he cannot 
deal with all council member countries at once, due to the 
limited resources and manpower. He met the representatives of 
the Estonian Institute for Human Rights yesterday. 
  Representative of the EU sir Leon Brittan offered a 
possibility to form a free trade area between the EU and the 
Baltic Sea countries outside the union. Free trade has a 
central position in the relations between these states and the 
EU and it would not be too early to think of a common trade 
region, he stressed. 
  The border issues between Russia and Estonia were not 
mentioned at the meeting, contrary to the earlier promises of 
the Russian foreign minister. Kozyrev unexpectedly announced at 
the news conference that Russia has no border disputes with 
neighbouring countries and that the issue will not be raised at 
the Paris conference either. Estonian Foreign Minister Juri 
Luik, however, stressed that Estonia will bring up the border 
subject, as the Balladur Pact conference is the best opportunity 
for discussing it.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondents Aleksandr Mineyev and </F>
Vladimir Smelov] 
  [Text] Brussels, 25 May -- "Russia is ready for a genuine, 
fully-fledged strategic partnership with NATO. NATO's 
Partnership for Peace program also has a part to play in this 
process." This was stated in Brussels today by Russian Defense 
Minister Pavel Grachev addressing a meeting of the North 
Atlantic Cooperation Council [NACC] at the defense minister 
level. Twenty-five states, including NATO countries and states 
of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, belong to this 
organization. 
  However, he said that this program "is not a comprehensive 
answer to the realities of the new era." It is merely the first 
step toward the emergence of a fundamentally new strategic 
community of allies working for peace and security. Russia, the 
minister stressed, is interested in a broader relationship with 
NATO, one which would be in keeping with its weight and position 
in the system of international ties. We are not claiming any 
privileged status, he explained. The issue at stake is the 
nature of the partnership itself. The states of both West and 
East ought to have an equal interest in deepening it. 
  Today the Russian side presented NATO with a document 
containing the parameters of Russia's involvement in the 
implementation of Partnership for Peace. At the same time, 
Russia proposes that a start be made on preparations for a 
large-scale program of cooperation between Russia and NATO, 
based on these parameters, and that a framework document be 
signed once these preparations are complete. 
  In the political sphere Russia proposes the establishment of 
an effective mechanism for mutual consultations on the entire 
range of problems involving European and world security. This 
would function both on a regular basis and in emergencies. This 
mechanism would be a practical step toward a future system of 
collective security and stability in Europe under the aegis of 
the CSCE. In the military sphere, Russia is ready to develop 
cooperation with the alliance and its partners in such areas as 
the coordination of joint military activity, peacekeeping, 
transparency in the field of military planning and military 
activities, and training of personnel. It also expects to 
strike up a partnership in other areas as well, such as 
disarmament and arms control, conversion, non-proliferation of 
weapons of mass destruction, and environmental protection. 
  Commenting on this document, P.Grachev stressed that the 
Russian Federation advocates the creation of a qualitatively new 
system of international security, above all in Europe. In 
contemporary circumstances, the inevitable contradictions 
between the national interests of various states -- 
contradictions that used to be eased by the rigors of bloc 
discipline -- have come to the foreground. Therefore, it is 
essential to spot these differences in time and prevent them 
from becoming factors of military danger or threat. 
  There are several stumbling blocks hampering the 
organization 
of genuinely equitable bilateral cooperation with NATO, 
P.Grachev went on to say. Specific forms and means of securing 
cooperation in the sphere of military technology have not been 
defined. This could bring about a fresh escalation of the arms 
race. A mechanism of cooperation between Russia and NATO in 
crisis situations needs to be worked out. 
  Russia's position, the minister said, is that the 
strengthening of anti-crisis mechanisms should proceed on an 
all-European scale through speeding up the transformation of the 
CSCE into an authoritative, fully-fledged political structure. 
In the process, the NACC must become an independent body -- 
though with close CSCE links -- working for all-European 
military-political cooperation and prevention and settlement of 
crisis situations and armed conflicts. In due course the NACC 
could become the military component of a future bloc-free system 
of European security. The CSCE and the NACC could exercise 
constant supervision and coordination of the efforts of the WEU, 
the EU [European Union], and the CIS in the sphere of 
strengthening cooperation and mutual security. 
  P. Grachev declared that Russia did not intend to use the 
Collective Security Treaty (CST) concluded in Tashkent between 
the CIS countries as an instrument of confrontation with Europe 
or Asia, let alone turn it into a closed military bloc.

  [Text] Moscow, 26 May (ITAR-TASS) -- President Boris 
Yeltsin called on Russian counterintelligence to intensify its 
counter measures against foreign special services which have 
stepped up their activities on Russian territory recently. 
  Speaking today at a conference of leaders of the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service [FSK], he set out the main 
objectives facing the FSK. ITAR-TASS has learned that, among 
other things, Boris Yeltsin called for greater efforts to 
forestall interethnic conflicts and a greater drive against 
organized crime, terrorism, and the drugs mafia. Success in 
these areas, the president believes, will help to boost the 
prestige and authority of counterintelligence agents in society. 
  The FSK, Boris Yeltsin stressed, must also safeguard the 
country's economic security. In order to meet these objectives 
the security organs must be strengthened, the president 
believes. Attestation carried out within the FSK has helped to 
increase their professionalism, he said. Boris Yeltsin 
expressed hope that counterintelligence agents will cope with 
the tasks they have been set.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 98 (588)] </F>
  [Text] President Lennart Meri called Estonian-Russian 
relations "a No.1 priority in the foreign policy." However, 
relations between his country and Russia, in his opinion, "can 
be based only on the Tartu Peace Treaty" of 1920. 
  IF Note: According to this treaty, Estonia included parts of 
the present Pskov and Leningrad regions of Russia of the total 
square of about 2,000 square kilometers. The Russian side has 
repeatedly stated that the Tartu Treaty had lost the [sentence 
incomplete as received]. 
  As the president noted at a meeting with residents of the 
Parnu city and the district, the Tartu Treaty "allowed the 
Estonian people to realize the right for self-determination," 
and in this his sees its "eternal value." 
  As Interfax was told in the presidential press service, Meri 
hopes that "problems which so far have shadowed the 
Estonian-Russian relations, should find a constructive and 
practical resolution." 
  In the meantime, Tallin's aspiration to declare the Tartu 
Treaty a basis for Russian-Estonian relations was described by a 
high-ranking Russian diplomat as "judicially absurd." In an 
interview with Interfax he said that Meri's statements about the 
of this treaty cause "regret." 
  "Obviously, if Russia recognizes this treaty, it will have 
to 
exchange prisoners of war and those interned with the Estonian 
side, to confirm the existence of `the neutrality zone' in the 
Finnish Gulf and to implement many other provisions of the 
treaty which have become hopelessly old," the Russian diplomat 
said. 
  He expressed hope that during a scheduled meeting between 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and the Estonian 
president in Tallinn, bilateral relations will be discussed "in 
a constructive spirit." "Russia's position remains the same: 
The Tartu Peace Treaty became invalid after Estonia joined the 
USSR in 1940," the diplomat concluded.

  [Text] [no dateline as received] On 25 May Ukraine's 
President Leonid Kravchuk visited the manuscripts department of 
the Taras Shevchenko Institute of Literature. During his 
meeting with employees of the institute he said it has become 
possible to split the solution of the Crimean issue into four 
stages: The first three envisage the division of the Black Sea 
Fleet, the determining of the sites for its bases, and the 
solution of the social and economic problems facing the 
peninsula. In the fourth and final stage, political 
arrangements should be worked out for settling all the problems 
around Crimea. "I always raise this question: Are we with 
Russia or under Russia?" Leonid Kravchuk asserted. 
  Touching on today's political situation in Ukraine, Leonid 
Kravchuk said that in political life, unfortunately, there is a 
repetition of something that occurred in 1990.

<F P=106> [Galina Sapozhnikova: "Kozyrev Believes in Commissars"] </F>
  [Text] Tallinn -- The third Baltic Council conference, 
which took place Wednesday [25 May], was attended by foreign 
ministers from 10 large and small sea powers including Russia 
and Sweden. The council was established two years ago in 
Copenhagen and authorized to jointly resolve problems of 
economic cooperation, the environment, illegal immigration, and 
organized crime. 
  But the main event for the country was the arrival in 
Tallinn 
of Andrey Kozyrev. Russian-Estonian talks had become 
stalemated, the last meeting between politicians at this level 
having taken place back in December 1992. So everyone was 
eagerly expecting Kozyrev in Tallinn. 
  In an exclusive interview with KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA, the 
minister said: "We have nevertheless managed to create the post 
of supreme commissar for national minorities' affairs. He works 
mainly in the [former Soviet] Baltic countries. We have 
prevailed on the Council of Europe, which was quick to grant 
Estonia membership, to send a mission to Estonia; this mission 
now works there practically full time, and is also making fairly 
serious demands that the regime relating to our compatriots 
should be adjusted. And finally, this forum sees the 
appointment of a new commissar whose task includes strengthening 
democratic principles. But what kind of democracy are we talking 
about if almost one-third of the population are considered 
foreigners? You know, in order to secure ratification of this 
mandate, I was even obliged to issue a threat that I would not 
come to this meeting."

<F P=106> [Mikhail Ivanchikov report under the "CIS Deadlocks" rubric: </F>
"We Will Divide Up the Fleet and Then Go Off and Vacation in the 
Crimea"] 
  [Text] The Russian-Ukrainian talks in Moscow on the future 
of the Black Sea Fleet are still far from over, although there 
is a decision in principle now -- it has been resolved to divide 
the whole fleet virtually in half, with 169 ships going to the 
Russian side and 164 to the Ukrainian side. 
  However, confusion over the lists -- what should go to whom 
-- is delaying a resolution. This essentially simple solution 
to the situation -- taking everything and dividing it all up -- 
brings a wry smile to fleet officers' faces. After such a 
division it will scarcely be possible to speak of the Russian 
and Ukrainian fleets' possessing even basic combat 
effectiveness, because the Black Sea Fleet was created as a 
single entity to carry out fully defined tasks. Moreover, 
another perfectly natural question arises here: Is Ukraine 
capable of maintaining such an enormous structure on its own, 
given the republic's very grave economic situation? And even 
that is not all. Financial difficulties aside, a whole raft of 
other problems arise, particularly cadre problems. It is not 
clear how and where the Ukrainian Navy commanders will train the 
officer personnel for their own fleet. 
  But the division of the ships is only part of the solution 
to 
the problem. The Russian ships will continue to be based in 
Sevastopol. Howver, the status of that city has still to be 
defined. The Russian side would like everything to remain as it 
was, but that does not suit Ukraine. A Russian military base in 
Sevastopol is fine; but Sevastopol as a whole as a Russian 
military base is not. 
  The delicate issue of the fate of the Black Sea Fleet is 
being decided on this occasion not by the presidents but by the 
Russian and Ukrainian heads of government, even though 
previously Kravchuk and Yeltsin were dealing with this problem 
on their own. The faulty-telephone ploy -- the premiers 
themselves are not authorized to make any kind of final decision 
without the sanction of their presidents (Chernomyrdin and 
Zvyahilskyy are obliged to continually consult their chiefs) -- 
also drags out the negotiations. It is no secret that relations 
between Borya and Lenya (which, according to Boris Nikolayevich, 
is how the chiefs of Russia and Ukraine used to address each 
other not so long back) have markedly cooled of late. As the 
saying goes, friendship is all very well, but money is a serious 
matter. And the reason for this was Yeltsin's message to 
Kravchuk after the official Ukrainian authorities stated that 
they were ready the pay the highest price for Crimea. Boris 
Nikolayevich did not beat about the bush: The Ukrainian 
authorities should not try to resolve the Crimean issue from a 
position of strength. Leonid Makarovich had a ready response: 
He stated that the Russian president's message to him was not 
in keeping with international norms, which, translated from 
diplomatic into colloquial language, means "Keep out of our 
business!" 
  Meanwhile, as many analysts note, inflaming passions over 
the 
Crimea plays into Kravchuk's hands. The upcoming presidential 
election has no attraction for Kravchuk. His only chance of 
remaining in the saddle is to postpone or call off the election 
altogether. However, that is a high-risk venture as, if he 
fails to keep the situation under control, in the eyes of 
international opinion he will lose the image of a politician 
who, despite everything, was able to avoid the worst-case 
scenario and keep Ukraine from collapsing. 
  Moscow has gladly joined in this game. Both legislators and 
representatives of the executive -- literally all of them -- 
have expressed their opinions on the Crimean events. 
  Taking their cue from the "battle of the iron chancellors," 
the local "Napoleons" have likewise gotten down to political 
business. Thus -- to the annoyance of the current Crimean 
authorities -- pro-Ukrainian forces have announced the creation 
of a Crimean Rada, that is to say, a parliament. This is the 
third legislative authority now in being on the peninsula: A 
Crimean Supreme Council and a Crimean Tatars' assembly function 
in one way or another. 
  While the politicians are crossing swords, the people of the 
Crimea are worried by something else: What effect will the 
current battles have on the vacation season -- after all, the 
more vacationers, the greater the takings. It is to be hoped 
that the inhabitants of the peninsula will not be the losers in 
this situation.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 27 TASS -- Russian newspapers on Friday 
run reports by their own correspondents and news agencies about 
the seizure of a bus near Mineralnye Vody by terrorists, the 
situation concerning the Crimea, the forthcoming arrival of 
world-famed writer Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn in Vladivostok, and 
the Russian president's meeting with the leaders of the Federal 
Counter-Intelligence Service (FCS). 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries excerpts from the president's 
report at the all-Russia meeting of the FCS. 
  "The country acutely needs reliable, intensively working 
special- purpose agencies. It is essential to remove the burden 
of totalitarian legacy and at the same time counter disruptive 
sentiments that hindered the work of fcs personnel," the 
newspaper quotes the president as saying. 
  NOVAYA YEZHIDNEVNAYA GAZETA (NEW DAILY NEWSPAPER) on the 
all- 
Russia FCS meeting: 
  "A wave of resignations and transformations in 1991-1994 has 
demoralised the FCS which lost both skilled personnel and 
monopoly on investigation operations". 
  ROSSIISKIYE VESTI interviewed Sergey Filatov, chief of the 
presidential staff. "The circulation of rumours about personnel 
changes in the top echelon of powers turns nearly into a system. 
I would even say that leaks of information have become an 
instrument of political struggle". 
  Asked what renders state personnel unstable, Filatov said: 
"The frequency of personnel changes is influenced by the 
socio-economic condition of society and by the outcome of 
struggle between political forces". 
  Filatov views this as a transient phenomenon in present-day 
conditions, "because sometimes compromises are achieved through 
personnel reshuffles. A compromise in politics makes it 
possible to ease tension in society and stabilise the situation". 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA continues to publish a series of 
interviews with Aleksandr Rutskoy. In this instalment, the 
former vice- president describes the "Lefortovo period". 
  "I pondered a good deal, assessing in-depth the entire 
spectrum of causes and circumstances that put Russia in the 
hardest crisis situation. Simultaneously I was writing two 
books The Collapse of a Power and The Finding 
of Faith. The former analyses all events that took place 
in the Soviet Union and Russia from 1990 to the October tragedy 
of 1993. 
  "After The President's Journal was published, I 
had to supplement my book with yet another chapter, taking a 
look at the October events from the position of the democratic 
press and the `Journal'. Mass media hyped stories about Supreme 
Soviet snipers but none of them turned up either in Lefortovo, 
Butyrki or Matrosskaya Tishina prisons. Hence the question -- 
which side the hired killers-snipers were from?". 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) on the Crimean issue and 
Ukrainian- Russian talks: 
  "Despite the optimism with which some participants in the 
Moscow meeting spoke about the positions of the sides drawing 
closer together, the talks ended in failure, since from the very 
outset the Ukrainian side manifested a desire to resolve 
domestic problems at the expense of neighbours, as was the case 
during the talks on the nuclear disarmament of Ukraine". 
  PRAVDA on the same subject: "One still feels that it is 
beneficial for certain forces in Ukraine to maintain a 
heightened interest in the Crimea". 
  The newspaper quotes the Ukrainian publication NEZAVISIMOST, 
which shares the Rukh movement sentiments, as writing as 
follows: `The outcome of presidential elections, just as the 
future of Ukraine and the Crimea, is at stake. Leonid Kravchuk 
would either be out of reach for competitors, or he would lose 
the elections completely long before June 26'. 
  ROSSIISKAYA GAZETA analyses the recently issued six 
presidential decrees: 
  "Unfortunately we must note that upon the cancellation of 
quotas and licences which are taken stock of by means of 
computers, we shall have to rely fully on the strict observance 
of rules by customs personnel and on their integrity. Will that 
work?"

  [Text] Beijing May 27 ITAR-TASS -- Russian Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin and Chinese Premier Li Peng on Friday held 
talks in Beijing. The agenda covered aspects of political, 
trade, economic, scientific, and military technical interaction 
of the two countries. 
  Before the two delegations sat down at the negotiating 
table, 
Chernomyrdin and Li Peng had a one-to-one conversation. "Russia 
and China -- for all the differences of their internal 
conditions -- have identical purposes of creating full fledged 
social-market economies and integrating in the world economy," 
the Russian prime minister said. 
  Chernomyrdin praised the results of cooperation between 
Moscow and Beijing last year when the value of bilateral 
commodity turnover reached a record-high amount of 7.68 billion 
dollars, but admitted that problems still existed which impeded 
the free development of mutually beneficial Russo-Chinese ties. 
He pointed to certain economic difficulties, the shortfalls in 
agreements and the backwardness of transport communications and 
infrastructures. 
  We think it advisable to strengthen the role of the centre 
in 
our trade and economic relations. We should also think about 
upgrading the level of cooperation," he said. 
  The Russian prime minister recalled that more than one half 
of trade exchanges between Russia and China is carried out as a 
simple commodity exchange. "This form is exhausting itself ever 
more," he stressed. 
  According to Viktor Chernomyrdin, the economic ties between 
Russia and China can be made more effective by investments of 
entrepreneurial capital. A case in point is the use of Russian 
natural resources and the building of agricultural projects. 
  Another promising direction, according to Chernomyrdin, is 
the creation of a flexible banking infrastructure and 
interaction in the field of civil aviation, nuclear power 
engineering and peaceful uses of space. 
  As concerns border issues, the chairman of the government of 
the Russian Federation pointed to the significance of their 
resolution in the interests of the further strengthening of 
bilateral relations. This work continues, he said. 
  The head of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Russian 
Federation assured the Chinese premier that Moscow's position 
with regard to Taiwan is immutable. "We proceed from the 
assumption that only one China exists, and Taiwan is its 
inalienable part. Russia does not maintain official interstate 
relations with the island," he stressed. 
  Chernomyrdin invited Li Peng to pay an official visit to 
Russia. 
  In his opening address to the two delegations, the Chinese 
premier said good mutual understanding relating to many problems 
had been achieved during his one-to-one conversation with 
Chernomyrdin. He expressed the hope that Sino-Russian 
cooperation would develop, particularly in the economic sphere. 
  "China and Russia are great powers. The Chinese and Russian 
peoples are great nations. The two countries have a common 
border. China is interested in a steady expansion of 
comprehensive relations with Russia," Li Peng stressed. 
  He emphasized in particular the significance of the inter- 
governmental agreement, the signing of which will become "a big 
step" forward towards the turning of the Russo-Chinese frontier 
in an area of peace and friendship." 
  The head of the Chinese Government also expressed the hope 
that friendly relations between the Chinese people's republic 
and the Russian Federation would strengthen peace in the whole 
world. 
  As concerns trade and economic cooperation, the two sides 
agreed that the economies of China and Russia are "largely 
complementary" and expressed the desire to further expand this 
interaction, Li Peng said. 
  Russo-Chinese inter-governmental agreements were signed as a 
result of the talks.

  [Text] Beijing May 27 ITAR-TASS -- The military technical 
ties between Russia and China are being developed 
"constructively across a relatively broad range" due to a 
longstanding tradition of interaction, Russian Deputy Defence 
minister Andrey Kokoshin said in an exclusive interview with 
ITAR-TASS in Beijing. 
  The arms systems China has were developed on the basis of 
Soviet samples and are "genetically" related. For this reason 
the Chinese market is attractive to Moscow, which "views the 
development of such ties positively," Kokoshin said. 
  As concerns specific projects, the Russian deputy defence 
minister pointed to a contract for the delivery to China of 
several combat aircraft of the Su-27 series. 
  "it is a very good machine. It can remain in service until 
the year 2020 or even 2025 if properly modernised, I mean its 
armament and onboard equipment," Andrey Kokoshin explained. He 
stressed that "our Chinese friends made the right choice."

<F P=106> [Gennadiy Charodeyev report: "Strict Visa Regulations No </F>
Obstacle to Chinese Criminals"] 
  [Text] The first Russian-Chinese consultations on consular 
questions in Beijing highly rated the joint actions of the two 
countries' law enforcement organs: It has become safe again to 
travel on the Beijing-Moscow train. IZVESTIYA was informed of 
this by Grigoriy Karasin, chief of the Foreign Ministry 
Information and Press Department. 
  According to Chinese special services data, over 70 
gangsters 
have been arrested. At least 140 violations of the law have 
been detected, including fights, robberies, rape, and 
hostage-taking on trains, as well as criminal offenses in Moscow. 
  The Chinese criminals decided to head for Russia and Hungary 
posing as businessmen and students. But few reached Budapest, 
they settled mainly in Siberia and the Far East. 
  The criminals' calculations proved correct. Because the 
Chinese victimized "their own," they did not attract the Russian 
militia's attention for a long time. Finally, after receiving 
the signal from China, the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs 
sent a snatch squad onto the Beijing-Moscow train. The first 
four bandits were seized first and the militia arrested the 
others later. 
  Karasin reported that Moscow had spoken up for the Russian 
citizens detained in the PRC as "hostages." Russia's claims to 
the former USSR's property in 11 Chinese cities were also 
discussed. 
  An entry and exit visa procedure was introduced in January 
for Russians and Chinese holding general civilian foreign 
passports. But in recent months variant interpretations by the 
sides have emerged regarding the range of people who are also 
entitled to receive free multiple visas for official trips. It 
has been agreed to settle this question as well.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Platkovskiy report: "Clinton the Businessman at </F>
Loggerheads With Clinton the Democrat. Most-Favored-Nation 
Status Given to China, But Not Russia"] 
  [Text] After agonizing reflection, President Clinton has 
adopted a decision to extend China's most-favored-nation [MFN] 
status in trade. He also intends to give up the policy of 
linking trade with the state of human rights in China altogether. 
  The president was subjected to powerful pressure from both 
sides. Human rights lobbyists demanded that Beijing be taught 
about civilized norms of behavior. The financial-industrial 
lobby warned of increased unemployment in the United States if 
multibillion Chinese orders were lost. Overcoming an inner 
divide, Bill Clinton nevertheless came to the conclusion that 
economic interests are more important than democratic principles. 
  Most-favored-nation status releases trade between two 
countries from barriers in the form of duties and tariffs. In 
the Americans' estimation, refusal to extend the status 
(following the events on Tiananmen Square, a procedure for 
renewing this status is conducted every year) would entail 
irreparable damage to American companies' positions in the 
Chinese market. U.S.-PRC trade turnover last year was over 27 
billion. Boeing, for example, obtained fantastic profits by 
selling China the most airplanes. American manufacturers are 
counting on being able to secure very major deals with China, 
whose import demand in the next five years is estimated at $400 
billion. 
  A year ago Bill Clinton made a commitment to secure progress 
from Beijing in terms of the observance of human rights. In the 
past few months the Chinese authorities have released a number 
of dissidents. But at the same time, as our Beijing 
correspondent Vladimir Skosyrev reports, new arrests have been 
made. The fate of Wei Jingsheng, the civil rights activist who 
is the most popular in the West, and who disappeared from 
Beijing two months ago, is unknown. 
  American human rights activists are angry at the President's 
unprincipled attitude, pointing out that the Beijing leadership 
is doing nothing to initiate democratization. This subject is 
not fashionable in the major Washington offices at the moment. 
They are more concerned about how to use partnership with China 
to strengthen the U.S. position in Asia and worldwide. American 
diplomats are also counting on the hope that Beijing will help 
them cope with the unruly Kim Il-song, who is developing his own 
nuclear weapons. 
  Meanwhile all the indications are that the developing 
cooperation between Moscow and Beijing is causing a certain 
amount of concern in Washington. Russian business is obviously 
no competition against American business in the Chinese market. 
However, the weapons trade and stepped-up contacts between the 
Chinese and Russian military are making the Americans nervous. 
  Moscow is denied privileges that China has in trade with the 
United States. Russia has still not been granted 
most-favored-nation status.

  [Text] Chinese ships, naval vessels included, will be 
allowed to navigate Russian border rivers in the Khabarovsk 
region's shores only in day time. Such a decision has been 
taken by the regional administration, which, pending the 
completion of appropriate bilateral diplomatic activity, imposed 
new rules for navigation on the border rivers. 
  From now on the Chinese side must inform a Russian border 
official about the number of ships, their names, and time of 
their passage one day in advance of sailing. However, vessels 
must keep clear of the shores, nor are they allowed to land 
people, accept them or cargoes on board, catch fish or engage in 
any research. 
  The Russian Foreign Ministry has been asked to speed up the 
drafting of complete rules for sail by Chinese ships from the 
Ussuri river into the Amur river and back. 
  As the commander of Naval Forces of the Russian Border 
Troops, Vice-Admiral Nikolay Kudinov has told INTERFAX, the 
issue on navigation on the Amur and Ussuri rivers will be 
discussed during a visit to China by Russia's Premier Viktor 
Chernomyrdin. 
  Last year's bilateral talks on the issue ended inclusively 
[as received].

<F P=106> [BIZNES-TASS correspondent Irina Bolshova report "especially </F>
for ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA": "Moscow-Beijing: Green Light for 
Trade"] 
  [Text] In 1993 China became Russia's second biggest 
trading partner after the FRG, with a commodity turnover of 
around $7.7 billion, Oleg Davydov, minister of foreign economic 
relations, stated in connection with the forthcoming visit to 
China by an official Russian delegation headed by Russian 
Federation Government Chairman Viktor Chernomyrdin. 
  But a number of essential problems must be solved for the 
further development of bilateral economic relations, the 
minister noted. For example, the transportation backup for 
Russian-Chinese trade remains an acute problem. Owing to the 
absence of real possibilities for freight transportation, 25-30 
percent of contracts do not come to fruition. Therefore, the 
expansion of the capacity of existing border crossings and the 
opening of new ones is necessary, as are the more active use of 
transit routes through Mongolia and Kazakhstan, the creation of 
joint transportation and transport construction companies, and 
the more active introduction of container transport. 
  In the minister's opinion, there is an increasingly urgent 
need for a partial revision of the terms of settlements under 
the 10 July 1985 intergovernmental agreement on economic and 
technical cooperation in the building and modernization of 
industrial facilities in the PRC. At the present time the 
clearing system of settlements under this agreement has lost its 
advantages and has effectively been reduced to interstate 
barter. At the same time the interests of Russian organizations 
have been significantly damaged as a result of the adoption by 
the Chinese side of a so-called "clearing" exchange rate of the 
Swiss franc [SFr] against the yuan (artificially lowered, 
according to the estimates of the Ministry of Foreign Economic 
Relations, by 23-24 percent) and the restriction on the range of 
Chinese companies supplying barter [vstrechnyye] goods in Russia. 
  Oleg Davydov cited the problem of paying off loans granted 
by 
China to the former USSR as one question which has been "left 
hanging." The problem of the former USSR's debt to China on 
clearing transactions (around SFr808 million) and on the two 
state loans given in 1990-1991 to purchase consumer goods and 
food totalling SFr1.5 billion must be finally settled. The 
question of China's debts to the former USSR -- around SFr66 
million provided for the construction of the Wusu-Alashanhou 
highway -- also needs to be resolved.

<F P=106> [Valeriy Golovin report under the "Talks" rubric: "The </F>
Foreign Ministry Is Authorized To State..."] 
  [Text] Khabarovsk -- "The misgivings of people in the Far 
East about the possible transfer to the PRC of two large islands 
in the Amur River near Khabarovsk are absolutely groundless. 
According to all the realities of history, they belong to 
Russia. I am sure that in time the Chinese side will come to 
accept our logic and our arguments," Genrikh Kireyev, Russian 
Foreign Ministry special envoy and chairman of the Russian 
delegation at the border talks in China, stated at a press 
conference in Khabarovsk. 
  The Russian diplomat was meeting with journalists from 
central and local newspapers after the latest working meeting of 
the members of the Russian-Chinese joint demarcation commission 
had ended in this city. G. Kireyev also refuted rumors that 
2,000 islands will be transferred to the neighboring country 
during the demarcation process. In all there are 1,845 islands 
in the border rivers -- the Ussuri, the Amur, and the Argun. 
Legally speaking, they have never belonged to anyone. The 
demarcation will make it possible to remove that contradiction 
for the first time. Bearing in mind that the border line runs 
along the fairway of the navigable rivers, it may be presumed 
that one-half of the islands will be deemed Russian, the other 
half Chinese. 
  The Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman did not agree that 
there is no single approach at government level to the 
assessment of the border problem in the east of the country. 
The members of the Russian delegation at the talks have a 
single directive -- to uphold Russia's interests above all, he 
stressed. 
  However, the participants in the press conference still had 
some uncertainty over the unhindered passage of Chinese ships, 
including naval ones, along the fairway of the Amur River near 
Khabarovsk. This is indeed envisaged by the border settlement 
agreement between Russia and the PRC of 18 May 1991, which 
finally enabled the demarcation work to begin. That agreement 
says that special rules for such traffic must be devised. But 
this has not been done yet. Meanwhile, ships from the PRC sail 
here freely, often without even notifying the Russian side. 
This is causing a negative reaction from the local authorities.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Andrey Kirillov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 25 May -- Russia intends to develop trade 
and economic relations with China with all the means at its 
disposal, adhering to the "generally accepted rules of the game" 
in political issues, Mikhail Belyy, director of the First Asia 
Department at the Russian Federation Internal Affairs Ministry, 
said to the ITAR-TASS correspondent in an exclusive interview. 
  Belyy mentions this year's visits to China by Kozyrev and 
Chernomyrdin, and to Russia by Jiang Zemin that promise to boost 
contacts. 
  "The Russian side is satisfied with the current level of 
cooperation. Last year bilateral trade reached a record 
level--7.68 billion U.S. dollars, while direct ties between 
enterprises and firms prevail. A considerable volume--more than 
2 billion dollars--falls to the share of cross-border trade." 
  Belyy stresses the need to assess the present state of the 
economy and for the Russian Government to achieve a constructive 
partnership with China, both bilaterally and internationally. 
  Replying to a question as to whether the Chinese side is 
concerned about Russia's intention to take part in the 
"Partnership for Peace" with NATO, M. Belyy said: "We are 
explaining to the Chinese side that this program does not 
represent any kind of threat to China. It would seem that China 
has an understanding attitude to this issue and there will be no 
serious problems." 
  Belyy continues that major international problems will be 
discussed and stated that "we are interested in strengthening 
multilateral cooperation with China in regional and world 
affairs." He adds that documents are to be signed on the 
Russian-Chinese frontier, cooperation in environmental 
protection, on the regulation of material and water resources in 
the Amur and Ussuri River basins, and on agriculture. 
  Replying to a question as to whether military agreements are 
being examined, the Russian diplomat asserted that no military 
deals will be signed. Normal business ties exist between the 
military departments, he added. A short time ago a batch of 
SU-27 aircraft was sold to China, there will possibly be 
additional deliveries. China is interested in acquiring a 
licence for the production of the SU-27, the conditions of this 
deal are being discussed. Russia is not however, preparing to 
sell China an aircraft carrier. In arms trading, Moscow, he 
noted, is guided by the principle of not harming its own 
security. We are also refrain from selling weapons that will 
destabilize the situation in the region. He also rejected as 
false the newspaper reports on possible "exercises" with the 
Chinese Armed Forces or "joint maneuvers" on Russian territory. 
  Replying in conclusion to a question about the "Taiwan" or 
"Tibet" aspect of Russian-Chinese relations, M. Belyy stressed 
that with regard to Taiwan the development of ties is 
progressing along purely unofficial lines. The Russian diplomat 
expressed the opinion that "they have an understanding attitude 
in China toward the recent stay in Russia of the Buddhist 
spiritual leader the Dalai Lama as well. Therefore, one should 
not dramatize this question."

  [Text] The Americans have offered Russia assistance in 
building a burial site for radioactive waste. However, they 
have also stated that nuclear waste from the United States 
should be accepted at the burial site as a condition for doing 
so. Germany has also come forward with a similar proposal. 
Viktor Kutsenko, a representative of the Ministry of 
Environmental Protection and Natural Resources, said this in an 
interview for the RIA agency. He stressed that Russia would not 
agree to the country being turned into a dumping ground for 
nuclear waste.

  [Text] Russia is in favor of reaching agreed-upon decisions 
on the major provisions of a treaty on banning nuclear tests as 
soon as possible (by next spring), the director of the Russian 
Foreign Ministry's press and information department, Grigoriy 
Karasin, said in connection with the talks resumed by the 
Disarmament Conference in Geneva. 
  Russia's Foreign Ministry views these talks as a major 
direction of its efforts in the current year, he stressed at 
Thursday's briefing. He pointed to Moscow's intention to 
"contribute to the endeavors to create favorable conditions for 
next year's conference on extending the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty." 
  According to the diplomat, "Russia favors a realistic and 
evolutionary approach to developing the system of international 
control over the implementation of a treaty on banning nuclear 
tests, which would provide for using at its initial stage 
seismic methods, instruments for surveying radioactivity in the 
atmosphere, and on-site inspections."

  [Text] Three-day talks between the Ukrainian and Russian 
government delegations in Moscow on division of the Black Sea 
Fleet ended without result. 
  Vice-Premier Valeriy Shmarov told journalists that the sides 
took "time out of 10-12 days" after which an agreement on the 
first state of the Black Sea Fleet's division may be signed "on 
the basis of almost prepared text of the document." 
  He noted that despite efforts of both delegations "which 
worked for three days in two shifts," work has not been 
completed because every "subject of the division required great 
attention." Shmarov pointed out that the delegations of Russia 
and Ukraine "were on the verge of the document's readiness," 
however "some technical details had to be specified." 
  In the opinion of a member of the Ukrainian delegation, 
Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Tarasyuk, the final document was 
not signed at the talks "not at the fault" of Kiev. He believes 
that the Ukrainian delegation "showed enough flexibility and 
readiness for compromise." Tarasyuk said that the Ukrainian 
side offered during the talks five various drafts agreement. 
  At the same time he believes that the Moscow talks allows to 
speak about "burgeoning breakthrough," which "justifies the 
delay with the signing of the document." 
  Tarasyuk hopes that within 10 days Ukraine and Russia will 
manage at the level of experts to specify and coordinate 
conditions of the division of the Black Sea Fleet and the 
Russian Naval bases in Ukraine.

  [Text] Yuriy Dubinin, who led the Russian delegation at the 
recent talks with Ukraine, has no doubt that the issues 
connected with dividing the Black Sea Fleet which remain 
unresolved "will necessarily be thrashed out." 
  As he told INTERFAX on Thursday, the talks between the 
Russian prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, and his Ukrainian 
counterpart, Yukhym Zvyahilskyy, held in Moscow recently "cannot 
be qualified as useless." "The premiers and the two 
delegations did a lot of work and resolved virtually all the 
questions relating to the implementation of instructions issued 
by the presidents of Russia and Ukraine on April 15. A 
resolution has been drafted. There are only a few elements that 
need to be additionally studied and settled," he said. 
  The diplomat refrained from divulging the essence of the 
"elements that still need to be settled" and the agreements 
already reached. "We agreed with our Ukrainian partners that 
none of us will reveal the details of our future accords or 
allow `leakages'," he said. 
  Nevertheless Dubinin said that only a few issues remain to 
be 
settled. 10 to 12 days were allotted for this, he confirmed. 
"We hope that after that an agreement will be signed," he noted. 
  According to Dubinin, the proposed agreement will be signed 
by the two countries' prime ministers. "This might take place in 
Moscow. After all the site of the next meeting is not of 
paramount importance," he said. 
  When asked whether the latest frictions between Ukraine and 
the Crimea were under discussion in Moscow, Dubinin said: "I 
heard not a single word about those problems."

  [Text] The Black Sea Navy Command regrets that the 
negotiations between Russian and Ukrainian Prime Ministers in 
Moscow ended inconclusively. A senior naval officer has told 
Interfax that the Ukrainian side did not display enough 
flexibility over the issue on separate naval bases for Russia 
and Ukraine. 
  In his opinion, the Russian negotiating team accepted a 
tough 
compromise, that was not simple to do, as it offered Kiev to 
deploy Ukrainian ships close to the key Balaklava base near 
Sevastopol. The officer disclosed that the area is the chief 
submarine base for the Black Sea Fleet. 
  "If the Ukrainian delegation accepted the proposal, the 
naval 
command would confront the problem of submarines' redeployment. 
But Kiev ignored even such an offer by Moscow," the officer 
said. 
  In his opinion, the only reason for Kiev's intransigence is 
the lack of funds to modernize wharfs, build headquarters, and 
develop an infrastructure at a new place. 
  Meanwhile, he recalled that the Black Sea Navy Command had 
already cut electricity supply to some Ukrainian army units. 
  "If Kiev fails to pay off the debts, the command reserves 
the 
right to apply similar sanctions to other Ukrainian military 
units," he said.

  [Text] Moscow May 26 TASS -- Russian navy 
commander-in-chief Felix Gromov believes that the major 
achievement of the three-day Russian-Ukrainian talks in Moscow 
was that the sides switched from general declarations to a 
concrete discussion of the Black Sea Fleet share deal. 
  He told TASS on Thursday that "a basis had been laid for 
future goal-oriented work". 
  According to the admiral, during the ten-day break in the 
talks experts from both sides will specify the list of ships of 
the fleet, will study all its bases and assess the cost of the 
navy and shore facilities. 
  It has been agreed in principle that Ukraine will get 18 per 
cent of the fleet, according to Gromov. 
  He said that both the Russian and Ukrainian delegations came 
to the Moscow talks with their own plans of solving the dispute. 
However, a common variant was drafted on the first day and 
became the subject of all discussions. 
  The second round of talks is to be held in Kiev.

<F P=106> [Video report by correspondent Mikhail Svetlichnyy] </F>
  [Text] [Svetlichnyy] Russian Defense Minister Pavel 
Grachev's official visit to Belgium that began today is 
undoubtedly closely connected to the NATO Council session that 
ended on Wednesday, and in whose work the Russian minister took 
part for the first time. It was the Belgian side's active 
support that to no small degree helped on this. 
  At today's news conference, Pavel Grachev stressed the 
special role played by Belgium and Defense Minister Leo Delcroix 
in bringing NATO and Russia closer together. The Russian 
minister said that the timescale for signing the partnership 
documents now depends not on Russia but on NATO, on how quickly 
it examines the parameters for partnership proposed by Russia. 
  In an interview for the NTV company, Belgian Defense 
Minister 
Leo Delcroix noted that it is simply necessary to take into 
account the weight and significance of Russia as a great nuclear 
power. For Russia is not Albania, with all due respect to 
Albania, he noted. 
  If relations between Russia and the western partners are 
more 
predictable, then evidently this cannot be said of the former 
eastern bloc allies. A question from a Polish journalist to 
Pavel Grachev on his attitude toward Poland's joining NATO 
seemed more than just strange, for according to her they are 
seriously afraid of complications in the internal political 
situation in Russia. 
  [Begin recording] [Grachev] What can we say when it is heard 
from the mouth of this Polish girl that they are saying that 
Poland wants to join NATO in order to ensure its future safety 
against the processes going on in Russia. What is this, a 
challenge? 
  But of course we will consider that this is a lack of 
understanding. At state level our Russian-Polish relations are 
good, and I hope that they will be strengthened. 
  [Svetlichnyy] During these two days have you had the feeling 
that some states participating in Partnership for Peace, present 
like you at the meeting, are playing a game against Russia? I 
mean the two days of the session's work. 
  [Grachev] You know I do not want to draw any final 
conclusions. But those states that make up NATO, or are part of 
NATO, I have reached the unambiguous opinion that these states 
want to see Russia inside Partnership for Peace. As regards 
other states who have signed up, you know it is still early, I 
repeat, to draw any conclusions. 
  There were no open yeses or noes. We will see. [end 
recording] 
  [Svetlichnyy] Today the Belgian and Russian defense 
ministers 
laid wreaths at the eternal flame in the center of Brussels. 
This may not just have been a formality. The Belgian minister 
has said that his country is ready to be an intermediary between 
Russia and NATO. One has the impression that it is frequently 
much simpler for Russia to talk with W. European NATO member 
countries than with her former E. European allies.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondents Aleksandr Mineyev and </F>
Vladimir Smelov] 
  [Text] Brussels May 26 TASS -- Defence Ministers Pavel 
Grachev of Russia and Leo Delcroix of Belgium emphasised today 
the role of Belgium as a major mediator and connecting link in 
development of relations between Russia and NATO with a view of 
their further rapprochement. They addressed a joint news 
conference here after today's talks. 
  Yesterday, Grachev started his official two-day visit to 
Belgium. It was mostly thanks to Delcroix that the Russian 
defence minister met for the first with his NATO counterparts on 
Tuesday. At that meeting, Grachev delivered an hour-long report 
on Russia's new defence doctrine and expounded upon Moscow's 
views of European security issues. Apart from this, he 
delivered to NATO Russia's proposals for parameters of 
partnership with this organization. 
  At today's news conference Grachev told reporters that 
Russia 
would sign shortly a framework document of NATO's Partnership 
for Peace programme, but only proceeding from the said 
parameters. The date of signing depends on how soon NATO will 
consider the Russian proposals. Their analysis at the expert 
level is being already carried out. Then, Russia expects NATO 
ministers to discuss and approve the proposals. After this, the 
two sides will just have to settle technical issues. "Now all 
depends not on Russia only", the minister pointed out, stressing 
the point at issue was exactly proposals, not any terms. 
  When asked about Russia's idea of a mechanism of 
consultations with NATO, Grachev said since Russia was not a 
member of the North Atlantic Alliance, it had no right to demand 
to be informed and consulted on what country should be admitted 
to NATO and when, but certainly it will make its own conclusions 
about this. Consultations with NATO should above all concern 
peacekeeping missions. In this connection, the Russian defence 
minister recalled that he had criticized NATO's air strike upon 
Bosnian Serb positions, which was launched without preliminary 
consultations with Russia. 
  "Russia does not only want but will remain a great power", 
Grachev said. But it does not mean that Russia intends to exert 
pressure upon Central and East European countries or to direct 
them. "We favour equal partnership with these states upon mutual 
consent", he pointed out, adding that Russia views cooperation 
with other CIS countries as a top priority. 
  The Belgian defence minister told reporters that Grachev's 
meetings with NATO senior officials had promoted better 
understanding between Russia and the North Atlantic Alliance. 
Delcroix believes Russia is highly influential in the world and 
it requires an adequate treatment if NATO countries would like 
it to join the Partnership for Peace Programme. 
  Delcroix also reported that today's talks, at which the two 
ministers addressed each other not only as colleagues but as 
personal friends as well, concentrated on the NATO's partnership 
initiative, Russia's military doctrine and the situation in 
Bosnia.

<F P=106> [ITAR-TASS observer Tamara Zamyatina article: "Russia-NATO: </F>
Will Partnership Come About?"] 
  [Text] The question of whether Russia will subscribe to 
NATO's "Partnership for Peace" program, and on what terms, is 
being decided now while Russian Federation Defense Minister 
Pavel Grachev is in Brussels, which houses the headquarters of 
the North Atlantic bloc. 
  A few days before Pavel Grachev arrived in Belgium, a group 
of Moscow journalists and scientists of the Russian 
Sociopolitical Center along with your correspondent visited 
Brussels, where the NATO leadership devoted the maximum 
attention to us to explain the essence of the partnership 
program. 
  Let me remind you that the invitation to states belonging to 
the North Atlantic Cooperation Council and to CSCE countries to 
subscribe to the partnership program was approved by the 16 NATO 
countries 10 January 1994. The framework document of this 
agreement proposes that each country should make an individual 
contribution to military cooperation with NATO and that joint 
peacemaking, rescue, and humanitarian operations should be 
conducted. 
  Eighteen countries, including several CIS states, have 
already responded to NATO's invitation to join the partnership. 
In June their representatives will take their seats in a 
specially prepared office and will commence joint work. 
  But Russia, as is known, has put to NATO the condition that 
its great-power status be recognized and that our country be 
granted special powers within the framework of the "Partnership 
for Peace" program. Pavel Grachev's position was even more 
rigid: He repeatedly advanced a demand for preliminary 
consultations between the leadership of the North Atlantic 
alliance and Russia in the event of decisions being adopted on 
the forced establishment of peace in conflict zones. 
  NATO Deputy Secretary General von Moltke and also other 
leaders of the alliance, with whom we associated closely, told 
us gently yet adamantly that the North Atlantic alliance is 
prepared to take Russia's special status into account and to 
conclude an individual bilateral agreement with it, but only 
outside the program, participation in which presupposes equal 
terms for all countries. 
  To judge from the answer to a question which I put to the 
president of Russia on the eve of the Russian Federation defense 
minister's visit to Brussels, Boris Yeltsin gave Pavel Grachev 
instructions to defend the position declared by Moscow: To join 
the partnership, but to stipulate the simultaneous signing of a 
large-scale agreement between NATO and the Russian Federation. 
Thus, the question of Russia's joining the partnership remains 
open, as before. 
  The misgivings that the Russian authorities have about the 
NATO program are accounted for both by the fact that the USSR's 
former Warsaw Pact allies have joined the North Atlantic bloc 
alliance and, particularly, by the recent bombing strikes 
against Bosnian Serb positions in the former Yugoslavia, which 
were not agreed with Russia. 
  Proceeding from this, Russian politicians are focusing 
attention on the military aspect of the partnership program. On 
the one hand, they are concerned about the question of 
obligations relating to the joint ensuring of democratic control 
over defense forces, about which our military are, naturally, 
unenthusiastic. On the other hand, the problem of 
standardization of the NATO partners' military equipment, which 
could deprive Russia of sales markets for its armaments, is 
being raised repeatedly. 
  At the NATO headquarters, in response to misgivings of this 
kind, we heard arguments which merit attention. Participation 
in international structures really does bind countries in a net 
of obligations, Mr. Leroy, leader of a department, told us, but 
what is bad about that if joint obligations restrict states with 
regard to drastic actions without prior consultations? For this 
constitutes concern for collective security. 
  Developing this argument, NATO experts said that Russia's 
failure to subscribe to the partnership program would give our 
internal opposition a clear trump card, and in that case there 
will be an increased potential danger of Russia's being drawn 
into conflicts. 
  Another counterargument by the Russian military against 
subscribing to the partnership porgram was the opinion that 
participation in it will mess up the CIS countries' collective 
security treaty. But, first, eight former Soviet republics have 
already joined the partnership with NATO. Second, overall 
membership of the program would be capable of ensuring global 
security "from Vancouver to Vladivostok." 
  In addition, it is also impossible to disagree with the 
argument that it is better to influence decisionmaking -- which 
Russia seeks to do within the framework of the European and 
world community -- by being within the structure and not being 
isolated. 
  On the other hand, the thesis that economic cooperation with 
developed countries is the priority for Russia seems fair. If 
we are invited to military cooperation, why not link this 
question to the opening up of European markets to goods from 
Russia? 
  Otherwise we get an undisguised picture of the desire of the 
United States and West Europe to bind Russia with obligations to 
maintain stability and security without reinforcing its 
membership of the partnership program with economic cooperation. 
Without the latter it will not be easy to find considerable 
additional funds in the Russian budget for Russia's dues for the 
"Partnership for Peace" program. Having adopted the political 
decision to subscribe to it, Russia still retains the right to 
draw up a bilateral agreement with NATO.

<F P=106> [Anna Kozyreva article under the "Partnership" rubric: "Our </F>
Diplomacy Is Wavering Between Pyongyang and Seoul"] 
  [Text] The forthcoming official visit to Moscow by ROK 
President Kim Yong-sam, scheduled for 1-4 June, has again drawn 
attention to the problem of Moscow's mutual relations with the 
two Korean capitals, Pyongyang and Seoul. 
  The ROK ranks among the 10 leading trading powers in the 
world and, in some economic sectors, is even a serious 
competitor to the West. Furthermore, a number of experts 
believe that South Korea's experience is more appropriate for 
Russia than America's or Europe's. If you take into account the 
geographical proximity of Russia to South Korea, too, it is 
perfectly possible to talk about the highly favorable 
opportunities for cooperation between the two countries. 
  Despite that fact, business contacts between Moscow and 
Seoul 
have been developing less successfully than expected after the 
establishment of diplomatic relations in September 1990. And 
the plans were ambitious. The sides gave each other 
most-favored nation trading status, established telegraph and 
telex communications, and opened direct air communication 
between the capitals and sea communication between Vladivostok 
and Pusan. As a result trade turnover increased rapidly. 
However, in 1992 it had already begun to decline and in 1993 
South Korea's total volume of trade with the CIS countries 
amounted to just $2 billion. Russia, meanwhile, exports mainly 
raw materials and the South Koreans, despite having a high 
regard for its high-tech goods, are in no hurry to buy them. 
  As a result, a series of highly promising projects have not 
been implemented. For example, Hyundai and Lucky Goldstar 
International proposed taking part in oil exploration work in 
Kalmykia, in laying an oil pipeline from Yakutia via the DPRK to 
South Korea and China, in modernizing the Izhorskiy Plant in 
Leningrad Oblast, and in investing $53 million to create a 
number of joint ventures with Soviet partners. In addition, 
there was a proposal to build a business center and a large 
hotel in the region of Nakhodka and Vladivostok ($50 million) 
and a polypropylene plant in Tobolsk ($30 million), and to 
develop a coal mine in the settlement of Yelginskiy ($200 
million). And so on. Now Seoul's decision to allocate the 
former USSR $3 billion is viewed in South Korea as a mistake by 
the then President No Tae-u. And part of that money remains 
frozen. 
  This topic was discussed at the Institute of the Far East 
and 
the following aspect was noted. When it established official 
contact with us, the ROK expected that Moscow would be able to 
put pressure on the DPRK in the ROK's interests. Seoul would 
also have been happy if Russia had made a statement on the 
USSR's involvement in the launching of the Korean War of 
1950-1953. But those hopes were not fulfilled and interest in 
Russia began to wane. 
  "Life shows that mutual relations with Seoul cannot be built 
without taking into account Pyongyang's opinion," Roald 
Savelyev, acting director of the Center for Korean Studies, 
believes. "Bias in favor of one of the partners could weaken 
our position in the region as a whole." 
  Roald Vasilyevich stresses in this regard that observing 
balance in mutual relations with the two Koreas is especially 
important for Russia. Take, for instance, timber procurement 
work in the Far East. For a long time North Korea's forestry 
workers treated our timber reserves quite barbarically. Thus it 
was decided to entrust this work to the South Koreans. The 
logic behind it was this: The South has more sophisticated 
timber felling techniques and has a more solicitous attitude to 
nature. That was indicated by the following fact: Just 
previously the ROK leadership had suspended the activity of 
Dusan Elektro Matriyel [name as transliterated], a leading firm 
in the microelectronics and computer industry, for dumping over 
300 tonnes of phenol in the Naktong River. A country which 
takes such care to protect the natural environment, it was 
thought, will set a good example to all timber producers. In 
fact it all proved otherwise. The international environmental 
organization Greenpeace, which monitored the work of the South 
Koreans, sounded the alarm: Russia's forests are still being 
plundered. 
  Of course, facts such as these are not meant for analysis 
at top level. We have the relevant articles in the criminal law 
which are supposed to prevent excesses of this kind. But the 
example is instructive. It testifies eloquently how dangerous 
illusions can be. 
  Political confusion also slowed down the construction of the 
oil pipeline from Yakutia via North Korea to South Korea. 
Pyongyang took a highly negative view of the fact that the USSR 
established diplomatic relations with Seoul. As a result the 
North Koreans sharply curbed their relations with us. Moscow 
played its part here, too, which led to the creation of a 
certain tension on the borders and in the region as a whole. 
Today Russian diplomats tend to blame it all on the USSR 
Foreign Ministry. However, in recent years they themselves have 
been pursuing the same line. 
  "Our interests, first and foremost the interests of 
security," Roald Savelyev says, "demand very precise and 
verified actions in dealings with the two Korean states. Yes, 
Pyongyang has North Korean interests to care about, Seoul has 
South Korean interests. But Moscow too must defend Russia's 
national interests. In the past we gave the North strenuous 
support in the spirit of internationalism but then we began to 
support the South equally determinedly. And as a result we 
reduced our ties with Pyongyang without acquiring new ones with 
Seoul." 
  The breakdown in economic relations was especially painful 
for us, my interlocutor believes. We built quite a few 
industrial facilities in North Korea, including 
battery-production and miniature electric motor plants, in the 
expectation of receiving output for our own needs. Now the 
agreements have been suspended and in Russia there is a shortage 
of vehicle spares, miniature motors, and many other products. 
  Are improvements possible? Undoubtedly. For that to happen, 
in the opinion of our experts, it is necessary to remove the 
seat of tension on our borders where there is permanent 
confrontation, not just political but military, too. There is a 
35,000 strong U.S. corps in the South, and Patriot missiles are 
being brought in there now. There are also disputes over 
Pyongyang's nuclear program. The unification of the two 
countries, not as "total" as in Germany, of course, would lead 
to an improvement in the situation in the region. But even 
before that Russia must not lose the positions that it has won 
both in the north and the south of the Korean Peninsula. 
  I should like to hope that Kim Yong-sam's forthcoming visit 
will take place in the spirit of the establishment of truly 
equal and mutually beneficial relations. There is a Korean 
proverb: "They dug the well together, but only one drinks." We 
must make sure that we are not the partner who is left out.

<F P=106> [Sergey Tsekhmistrenko report under the "Situation in the </F>
Former Yugoslavia" rubric: "Vitaliy Churkin: The World Has 
Seen Russia's Objectivity"] 
  [Text] Yesterday, talks on a Bosnian settlement began in 
France between representatives of the contact group (including 
Russia, the United States, the EC, and the UN) and the parties 
to the Bosnian conflict. The talks are held according to a 
decision by the great powers' foreign ministers that was reached 
in Geneva two weeks ago. There is every reason to hope that 
this time an agreement on halting hostilities in Bosnia will be 
reached. This is what Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy 
Churkin said in an exclusive interview for KOMMERSANT-DAILY 
observer Sergey Tsekhmistrenko. 
  According to Vitaliy Churkin, Russian diplomacy has 
conducted 
intensive work since Geneva, primarily to convince the Bosnian 
Serbs to sit down at the negotiating table. Presently one can 
state that their attitude to the Geneva documents is on the 
whole fairly positive. This conclusion can be drawn at least 
from the fact that the Serbs, who control over 70 percent of 
Bosnia, calmly reacted to the Geneva plan of Bosnia's 
territorial partition that gives 51 percent to the Muslim-Croat 
federation and 49 percent to the Serbs. At the negotiations that 
have just begun the Bosnian Serbs are represented by Momcilo 
Kraisnik, "the chief specialist on work with maps," who has 
already established fairly good contacts with Muslim Prime 
Minister Haris Silaidzic. The Serbs have also refrained from 
escalating hostilities, something for which the Geneva 
communique also called. 
  Unfortunately, the Russian diplomat observed, the 
Muslim-Croat side has so far not shown any desire to conduct a 
constructive dialogue. Mr. Churkin emphasized in particular 
that this conclusion should not be interpreted as "Moscow's 
pro-Serb stance:" Russia is holding an objective stance 
regarding all parties to the conflict, which was confirmed by 
events in Gorazde. At present, representatives of the newly 
created federation (where the Muslims call the shots) question 
many provisions of the Geneva plan, including the principles of 
territorial partition and the cessation of hostilities for four 
months. One is getting the impression that the Muslims are also 
deliberately trying to delay the settlement in Gorazde by 
refusing to sign a special agreement with UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Force] (the Serbs have already signed it) so as to 
have an excuse to avoid halting combat operations in all of 
Bosnia. 
  To all appearances, Mr. Churkin said, the opinion seems to 
be 
still holding sway in the Muslim leadership that much more could 
be gained on the battlefield than by dialogue. However, there 
are more than sufficient reasons to hope for success at the 
current negotiations. This, in turn, will pave the way to a new 
meeting of the great powers' foreign ministers, which could also 
be held in Geneva (but this time in the Russian mission, not the 
U.S. one -- there should be parity after all!) in mid-May. 
  Events in Bosnia have somehow relegated to the back burner 
other hot spots in the former Yugoslavia, including the 
situation around Croatian Serb Kraina. Mr. Churkin did not hide 
his disappointment with the fact that, having started their 
dialogue with signing a cease-fire agreement, the sides have 
gotten bogged down in matters of procedure, for instance arguing 
over the venue of their next meeting. Changes in the leadership 
of Serb Kraina have also played a part. As a matter of fact, 
when at his first meeting with Milan Martic, the new president 
of Serb Krajina, Mr. Churkin said that Moscow's attitude to 
Krajina leaders would largely depend on how they cooperate in 
the investigation of the circumstances accompanying the murder 
of two Russian citizens, journalists Viktor Nogin and Gennadiy 
Kurennoy. 
  In that regard IZVESTIYA's hint in its 24 May issue that the 
Foreign Ministry has allegedly prevented publication of the 
results of the investigation by a commission of Supreme Soviet 
deputies under Vladimir Mukusev was not correct, Mr. Churkin 
said -- "no Russian diplomat has ever thought of interfering in 
an investigation proceeding from political considerations, 
either major or minor, at least in the two years that I have 
been holding the post of deputy minister."

Andrey Krasnoshchyokov and Andrey Shtorkh] 
  [Text] Paris May 26 TASS -- The collective initiative of 
the European Union to hold a conference on the "Pact on 
Stability in Europe" is in tune with Russia's care about the 
strengthening of stability on the European continent, Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev stated speaking at the 
international forum which opened at the UNESCO headquarters in 
Paris today. 
  The present conference, the top Russian diplomat noted, is 
yet another attempt to "tackle seriously the extremely dangerous 
manifestations of aggressive nationalism, xenophobia, ethnic and 
religious intolerance". 
  Russian foreign minister reiterated that the initiative to 
organize this conference concerned nine states of Central and 
Eastern Europe which agreed to it. They are preparing to become 
members of the European Union and wish to discuss the problems 
connected with the condition of national minorities and fraught 
with possible complications. 
  It is quite natural, Andrey Kozyrev said, to seek to link 
this work to the context of the Conference for Security and 
Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) and rely on support from the 
countries participating in the all-European process. 
  "Certainly, within this framework Russia is prepared to make 
its own contribution in such a form which will be considered 
expedient," the Russian foreign minister elaborated. 
  He believes that the main thing is that the chosen 
negotiating model -- the organizing of regional tables -- should 
not lead to duplication, to weakening of the existing 
international institutions and negotiating mechanisms but 
concentrate on concrete steps for the establishment of 
inter-ethnic relations and the guarantees of the rights of 
national minorities. 
  "This is particularly necessary for the three Baltic states 
-- Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania," Andrey Kozyrev stressed. 
  The problem of national minorities is inseparable from the 
general establishment of goodneighborly relations, the Russian 
minister said, and the work on the "Pact on Stability in Europe" 
is to become yet another contribution to the formation of 
unified Europe of partnership and prosperity which must succeed 
not only Cold War but also uncertainty of the post-confrontation 
period. In this context, he noted, discussing of issues related 
to state borders just as national minorities, should be held 
exclusively within the framework established by the Conference 
for Security and Cooperation in Europe. 
  "The enhancement of the effectiveness of the CSCE and its 
transformation into a supreme political organization on the 
European continent is a key element of the concept of the 
all-European partnership put forward by Russia," Andrey Kozyrev 
stressed. 
  The head of the Russian foreign office expressed hope that 
the forthcoming summit meeting will strengthen a special role of 
the CSCE and its responsibility for the general development of 
European affairs. In the near future, he said, Russia will 
submit comprehensive and concrete proposals on these issues. 
  The merit of the present Paris conference, the minister 
emphasised, is that this forum is considering the problems of 
stability "from the angle of democracy and human rights but not 
in the military context". At the same time, he noted, military 
and political aspects must find its place in the course of wider 
efforts. 
  In this connection Andrey Kozyrev dwelt on mutual relations 
between Russia and NATO. Russia, he said, will join "the 
Partnership for Peace" program and sign a corresponding 
framework document with NATO along with a substantial program of 
cooperation which certainly will reflect a special role of 
Russia as a nuclear power". 
  "We stand for the deepening of equal partnership between 
Russia and NATO without mutual vetoes and surprises," the 
foreign minister accentuated. 
  Andrey Kozyrev expressed confidence that the Conference on 
Stability in Europe would be an important link in the process of 
forming the all-European future which may become a reality only 
with the help of joint efforts by all states.

  [Text] Paris, 26 May (ITAR-TASS) -- During the interval 
between plenary sessions of the Conference on Stability in 
Europe a meeting was held at the initiative of France between 
French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, French Foreign Minister 
Alain Juppe, and Andrey Kozyrev. Galina Sidorova, political 
adviser to the Russian foreign minister, told ITAR-TASS that the 
French leaders thanked the Russian minister for his agreement to 
take part in the conference and for Russia's active support for 
the idea of holding it. 
  The main subject of the conversation was ways of deepening 
relations between Russia and the principal European 
institutions. The Russian side believes that this process has 
not yet gathered sufficient momentum. The French leaders, for 
their part, called for the earliest possible conclusion of an 
agreement on partnership between Russia and the European Union 
[EU]. They stressed that Paris no longer sees any obstacles to 
completion of the negotiating process. All outstanding issues 
were settled during the recent official visit to Russia by A. 
Juppe. As we know, the main differences concerned conditions 
for trade in materials of the nuclear fuel cycle. 
  France considers that the conclusion of an agreement on 
partnership with the EU must be followed by further integration 
of Russia with other European organizations. 
  The entire atmosphere of the talks and the fact that the 
Russian minister was the only participant in the conference 
received by the French leaders so early in the conference 
testify to the present level of Russian-French cooperation, 
including cooperation in the preparation of this important forum.

    [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian at 1625 GMT on 26 May, in the framework of its "Details" 
program, carries a 10-minute report by Vera Kuznetsova on the 
visit by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev to Paris, where 
he participated in the international conference on stability in 
Europe. She interviews Kozyrev in the lobby of the conference 
hall in Paris. 
  Stating that the visit took place at the time of acute 
complications in Russia's relations with Ukraine, the Kuznetsova 
points out that Kozyrev did not try to intrigue against Ukraine 
in Paris but, on the contrary, reiterated that Russia respects 
the territorial integrity of Ukraine. 
  She adds that Kozyrev was the only foreign minister to be 
received by French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur after the 
conference today. She then asks Kozyrev why he was given such 
preferential treatment. Kozyrev replies: "I think one of the 
reasons is the intensity of the Russo-French dialogue and, in 
fact, our conversation was a direct sequel, as it were, to the 
conversation that took place between President Yeltsin and 
French Foreign Minister Juppe in the Kremlin a short while ago. 
In actual fact, the prime minister asked me the same questions 
and requested that we discuss our present position with regard 
to the points agreed during the conversation with the president. 
So this is not really my own achievement but a continuation of 
the dialogue begun by the president in the Kremlin." 
  Asked to explain what "points" he mentioned, Kozyrev said: 
"First and foremost, the agreement between Russia and the 
European Union. It is high time we reached the home straight, as 
the saying goes. I should say that after the meeting between 
the president and Mr. Juppe and our negotiations today, we are 
very close to finalizing this agreement; we are literally inches 
away from it, so we acknowledged our great progress on this 
matter. 
  "The second point is Balladur's plan itself, which we are 
discussing at the conference here. We have certain concerns 
about the border issues, among other things. In his speech. M. 
Balladur interpreted the question of borders in such a way -- 
and this is also how this is stated in the text of the document 
-- that the point under discussion is how to improve the climate 
on the borders by creating transparent borders, facilitating 
trade, simplifying travel regulations etc. Of course, there can 
be no doubt that we are very interested in these things. But 
some politicians in the Baltic countries -- I am just back from 
Estonia -- have a different approach to the question of borders." 
  Kuznetsova then asks Kozyrev if by this statement he means 
that Russia recognizes the territorial integrity of Ukraine with 
the Crimea as its part and that the Crimean issue should not 
reemerge in the future. Kozyrev answers: "We recognize 
Ukraine's integrity because it is a member of the United 
Nations, the CSCE, and the CIS, and because it has been 
recognized within its present borders. And of course we support 
the principle of inviolability of borders which means that 
countries should not lay territorial claims upon each other and 
should not resolve such issues by force. At the same time, this 
principle leaves to the population of certain regions the right 
to determine their will -- naturally, by peaceful and not 
military means -- so that subsequently the border can be changed 
through talks. Thus, the will of the population of the region 
in question is needed together with a peaceful negotiating 
process. That is, this principle does not mean that borders can 
never be redrawn but it creates certain civilized procedures for 
this." 
  The interviewer reminds Kozyrev that he described the format 
of the Paris conference as "12 plus 9" and asks what status 
Russia had at this meeting. Kozyrev replies: "The format of the 
conference is as follows: There are the 12 states of the 
European Community and 9 candidates who have agreed to discuss 
with these members of the European Union questions relating to 
ethnic minorities etc, so that the Union should not admit as 
members those states that could explode. As a European state 
and as a member state of the CSCE, we are ready to participate 
in the discussion of these questions because we are all one 
family and we are not indifferent to the way in which these 
questions will be tackled." 
  Kuznetsova then says it is almost settled that Russia should 
join the European Union, the G7 and the NATO's Partnership for 
Peace shortly, and asks Kozyrev whether he considers Russia's 
claim to a special role in the partnership justified. Kozyrev 
replies: "Yes, certainly. It would simply be unnatural if we 
forgot about the special role we have thanks to our being a 
nuclear power if for nothing else. No other participant in this 
partnership is a nuclear power. This may be a mere trifle, but 
a pleasant one, I should say."

<F P=106> [Aleksey Portanskiy report: "Italians Will Have To Be </F>
Persuaded To Grant Debt Deferment"] 
  [Text] The Russian Government has sent a letter to members 
of the Paris Club of creditor countries agreeing to hold a 
meeting in Paris 3 June on the question of extending the 
deadlines for payments of the former Union's debts due in 1994. 
This was reported Tuesday [24 May] by Russian Government Vice 
Premier A. Shokhin. 
  Let me remind you that at the beginning of April last year 
we 
concluded the first agreement with the Paris Club on 
restructuring the former USSR's debts, which gave the country an 
important financial breathing space. But that agreement applied 
only to payments due in 1993 and it has already formally 
expired. However, Moscow agreed with its creditors that it 
would remain in force until there is a new agreement. 
  Originally $4.7 billion was allocated to service the debt 
this year, which represents only a fraction of the total sum due 
for payment in 1994. In cutting all state expenditure, the 
State Duma has reduced this figure to $4.1 billion. But even 
this may not be final -- the Italians' position could cause 
adjustments to be made. 
  The point is that in the last years of the USSR's existence 
Moscow clearly accumulated an excessive amount of loans, a fair 
number of them from Italy. Hard bargaining over this has been 
going on with the Italians for many months now: We say that 
these debts are Soviet but they insist that they are Russian. 
Accordingly, if we get our way, the matter in dispute -- the 
round sum in foreign currency -- will be subject to 
restructuring along with the rest of the Union's debts, or to 
put it simply -- we will pay later. But if Rome comes out on 
top we will have to pay now. Here everyone realizes that Moscow 
is trying to maintain Russia's creditworthy image by not 
accumulating purely Russian debts. 
  The Italians have enlisted the support of Paris Club members 
in its claims. But our resources are limited in any case. 
Hoping that our creditors are sufficiently well aware of this, 
we are saying that we are prepared to pay Italy but in that case 
there is unlikely to be anything left to pay other creditors.

<F P=106> [Sergey Kozlov report in the "Russia -- Kazakhstan" column: </F>
"Alma-Ata Has Not Given Way to Moscow Over the Issue of Dual 
Citizenship. But In Two Months the Situation Could Change"] 
  [Text] The question of dual citizenship, which in the last 
few months (especially since Kazakhstan introduced its own 
currency) has become one of the most problematic issues in the 
dialogue between Moscow and Alma-Ata [Almaty], was also a 
central point in the Russian-Kazakh talks that have just ended. 
The Russian delegation at the meeting in Alma-Ata was headed by 
Abdulakh Mikitayev, chairman of the Commission on Citizenship 
under the Russian Federation president. Acting also as Boris 
Yeltsin's personal envoy during this visit, he conveyed a 
message from him to Nursultan Nazarbayev. Mikitayev also met 
with representatives of Russian public organizations from 
Alma-Ata and Taldy-Kurgan. Judging by the results of the 
talks, the main Russian-Kazakhstan contradictions were not 
resolved this time either. Alma-Ata still does not accept the 
idea of dual citizenship while Moscow (true, not so decisively 
as before) is trying to keep this subject on the agenda of the 
negotiations. 
  "We believe," Abdulakh Mikitayev stressed after the meeting 
with Kazakhstan officials, "that this institution will become a 
token of trust between states. Therefore the signatories to 
this agreement will confirm to their citizens that they will 
live in peace and friendship in the future." 
  The Kazakhstani officials' main argument against dual 
citizenship is that it could affect the evolution of the young 
state. Alma-Ata also maintains that in this event, more than 
half the Kazakhstan population would be placed in a privileged 
position compared to the indigenous population. But, according 
to Mikitayev, all these problems could be settled through 
separate bilateral agreements. 
  Speaking about the problem of loyalty which could emerge, 
according to some experts, the head of the Russian delegation 
said that the Russian draft resolution on the issue "contains no 
such notion as 'dual loyalty'; at any rate, we do not stipulate 
it. Loyalty can be only with respect to the state where a person 
resides permanently." Legal grounds for such a formulation of 
the question could be provided by Article 4 of the Kazakhstan 
Constitution which says in particular: "A person who is a 
citizen of the Kazakhstan Republic is not deemed as enjoying the 
citizenship of another state with the exception of cases 
stipulated under the present Constitution and the state treaties 
of the Kazakhstan Republic. All the republic's citizens who 
were forced to leave its territory, as well as Kazakhs living in 
other states, shall have the right to hold citizenship of the 
Kazakhstan Republic along with citizenship of other countries 
provided that this does not contradict the legislation of those 
states whose citizens they are." 
  Incidentally, Kazakhstan officials have more than once tried 
to give an excessively "liberal" interpretation to this article 
which, as international observers have noted repeatedly, has an 
ethnic coloring, stressing primarily the formulation: "Citizens 
who were forced to leave its territory." The absurdity of such 
an approach, renowned Kazakhstani lawyer Vitaliy Voronov noted 
at a recent international human rights conference, is belied by 
the very practice of local and immigration authorities, whose 
arbitrariness had to be curbed by President Nazarbayev himself 
with a special edict which defined the limits of kinship to help 
overcome ethnic and bureaucratic barriers for reunification with 
relatives. 
  The "expanded" wording again refers only to the ancestors of 
"indigenous" representatives of the republic's population who 
were forcibly moved, mainly to China after 1917 and after the 
well-known famine in 1930-33. However after 1917, as is known, 
many representatives of other ethnic groups left Kazakhstan as 
well, in particular, Uygurs and Tungans. Also Cossacks. 
  Yet today everybody in Kazakhstan (even officials) 
understand 
very well that it is virtually impossible for these immigrants 
who "have temporarily left" Kazakhstan territory to come back or 
acquire Kazakhstan citizenship (let alone dual citizenship, 
under Article 4). 
  Furthermore, Mikitayev noted, the sides could start 
implementing Nazarbayev's idea about creating "a single 
citizenship space" even now. As concerns an exodus to Russia, 
this process also worries the Russian side greatly. According 
to Moscow, in 1988, 23,600 people left Kazakhstan; in 1989, 
53,000; in 1990, 306,000; in 1992, 369,000; and in the nine 
months of 1993, 247,000. 
  It needs to be noted that these figures hardly reflect the 
true picture of emigration because the Russian embassy in 
Alma-Ata registers far from all those leaving. 
  Nonetheless, Abdulakh Mikitayev was optimistic and assured 
that an agreement regulating the question of citizenship will be 
concluded within the next two months.

  [Text] Russian Minister of Justice Yuriy Kalmykov and 
Azerbaijani Minister of Justice Ilyas Izmailov signed a state 
treaty on transfer of prisoners for punishment in Moscow today. 
  In accordance with this document foreigners convicted for 
crimes will have an opportunity to undergo the appropriate 
punishment in their native land. The treaty underlined that a 
prisoner can be transferred only if he agreed to. 
  Izmailov told journalists that about 400 Azerbaijan citizens 
were undergoing punishment on Russian territory. Approximately 
the same number of Russians have been imprisoned in Azerbaijan. 
  Izmailov emphasized that the treaty would not concern those 
sentenced to death. He said that the treaty aimed at bringing 
those convicted back to a normal life, which was impossible in a 
foreign country. 
  Kalmykov stated that Russia intended to sign similar 
treaties 
with Moldova and Ukraine. He pointed out that Russia stood for 
the development of juridical relations between the CIS states in 
what concerned not only criminal but also civil and family cases. 
  The Russian-Azerbaijani treaty requires ratification by the 
parliaments. It will come into effect thirty days after 
ratification.

  [Text] Moscow May 26 TASS -- New dates have been fixed for 
Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias's official visit to 
Moscow. He will arrive in Moscow on May 31 and stay until June 
2, Grigoriy Karasin, Information and Press Department director 
in the Russian Foreign Ministry, said at a briefing held today. 
  The reason of putting off the dates is linked with the fact 
that the both ministers had been busy attending different 
international forums, Karasin noted. "However, the aim of the 
forthcoming talks - the continuation of an active Russian-Greek 
political dialogue - remains unchanged," the spokesman said.

  [Text] Moscow May 26 TASS -- The majority of deputies of 
the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament, 
believes that a sensible pragmatism should dominate in the 
Russian foreign policy, chairman of State Duma Ivan Rybkin said, 
receiving Iraqi ambassador in Russia Hasan Fahni Jum'ah on his 
request today. 
  "I want to tell you frankly that we would like to establish 
cordial and friendly relations between Russia and Iraq," the 
State Duma chairman said. He noted that with all changes taking 
place in Russia, the state leaders should not forget their old 
friends while making new friends. 
  Hasan Fahni Jum'ah, who has been performing his duties over 
the past five months only, emphasised Russia's influence at the 
international arena. "Taking into consideration a great 
potential of the Russian people, one can say that Russia will 
soon regain its past status in the world and restore the 
balance, which was completely destroyed during the recent 
years," the ambassador said. 
  Hasan Fahni Jum'ah and Ivan Rybkin also discussed the 
strengthening of bilateral, interparliamentary cooperation 
between Russia and Iraq, the State Duma press service informed 
ITAR-TASS.

  [Text] Buenos Aires May 27 TASS -- A delegation of the 
Federation Council, the upper house of the Russian Parliament, 
led by council Speaker Vladimir Shumeyko left the Argentine 
capital for Brazil on Thursday in a tour of a number of Latin 
American countries. 
  While in Argentina on an official visit, Shumeyko met with 
President Carlos Menem and Guido di Tella, minister of foreign 
affairs and religion, and had meetings with Argentine Parliament 
leaders and representatives of the business community. 
  Russia and President Yeltsin can fully count on Argentina in 
the realisation of political and economic reforms, Argentine 
President Carlos Menem said here on Thursday during a meeting 
with Shumeyko. 
  Mr. Menem expressed gratitude for the invitation, which 
President Yeltsin extended to him earlier, to visit Russia and 
confirmed that he would pay a visit to Moscow in October this 
year. 
  At Shumeyko's request, President Menem described Argentina's 
experience in carrying out a radical economic reform and, 
specifically, in achieving financial and economic stabilisation, 
curbing inflation and privatising state property on a large 
scale. 
  As a result of the meeting with Carlos Menem, it turned out 
that the Argentine people had thought it would take a decade to 
carry out privatisation. However, five years elapsed, and 
privatisation is already being completed. Argentine experience 
in privatising railways and merchant marine is of special 
interest to Russia which does not yet venture to privatise these 
branches of the economy, Shumeyko told ITAR-TASS. 
  During Shumeyko's meeting with Guido di Tella, Argentine 
minister of foreign affairs and religion, it was emphasised that 
President Menem's forthcoming visit to Moscow would become an 
important landmark in the history of relations between Argentina 
and Russia. The minister said the visit would serve as a signal 
to Argentine businessmen that the president devotes much 
attention to Russia. 
  Guido di Tella highly appreciated the results of his recent 
visit to the Russian Federation, stating that after the visit he 
became "the most active populariser of Russia" in Argentina. 
  The Russian parliamentary delegation was received in the 
national congress of Argentina on Thursday. 
  In response to a question about the first results of the 
patliamentary delegation's tour of Latin American countries, 
Shumeyko told ITAR-TASS that the delegation members feel that 
people both in Chile and Argentina take genuine interest in the 
developments in Russia. 
  "Direct contacts with Latin Americans convinced us that they 
want to gain an understanding of the complex processes taking 
place in our country," Shumeyko pointed out. "contacts in 
Argentina, primarily those with the business community, give 
ground to believe that there are good prospects for fruitful 
mutually beneficial cooperation between Argentina and Russia," 
he said. 
  "We are young politicians. The future belongs to us. 
Therefore, we shall never agree to the old notions about the 
division of the world into blocs and to the existence of the 
very term a "third world." We look for new partners, seeking 
benefit for Russia. In this sense, Latin America is of great 
interest to us," Shumeyko said.

  [Text] Panama May 27 TASS -- Relations between Panama and 
Russia must be intensified and expanded, according to Panamanian 
Foreign Minister Gabriel Galindo. He said in an exclusive 
interview with ITAR-TASS that "we are aware of the fact that 
there is much to be done to take relations between Panama and 
one of the world's great powers, Russia, to a level which both 
countries find satisfactory. Nonetheless we can state with 
satisfaction now that a groundwork has been laid for the 
development of mutually beneficial cooperation. The Panamanian 
foreign ministries of Panama and Russia [as received] has made 
steps lately which led to an exchange of consulates general. We 
regard this as a good beginning". 
  According to the Panamanian minister, Russia can use Panama 
as a "gateway for penetrating Latin America". These gateways 
can provide an opportunity for the supply of Russian 
technologies to the countries on that continent and exports of 
manufactured goods, equipment and raw materials. "We would like 
Russia to be a partner capable of making a better use of our 
services, which are undoubtedly the most effective in the 
region". 
  "The liberalization of the Russian economy enables 
Panamanian 
investors to consider seriously prospects for the participation 
in joint ventures on Russian territory. Our diplomats in Moscow 
will be entrusted with bringing home to the Russians what 
advantages cooperation with us can give your entrepreneurs. A 
case in point is the opening of a Russian bank in our 
international financial centre," the minister said. 
  The Union of Banana-Exporting Countries with its 
headquarters 
in Panama, is now studying the possibility of exports to Russia 
and Eastern Europe as a whole, an area which has a huge and 
promising market, the minister said. 
  Gabriel Galindo is a member of the government which is being 
formed by president Ernesto Perez Balladares who won the 
country's general elections on May 8. The new government will 
take office on September 1.

  [Text] President Yeltsin's package of six economic decrees 
is neither a revolution nor a landmark the policy of reforms, 
let alone the second stage of reforms, Russian deputy Pavel 
Bunich of the Russia's Choice faction, himself a leading 
economist, told Interfax. At the same time, he said they 
indicated a number of small steps forward and were positive as 
such. But Bunich thinks their effects could be felt only in the 
next year's budget. By then, he stressed, appropriate laws will 
have been adopted to enshrine the measures indicated in the 
package. 
  Bunich thinks that the package was intended only to declare 
some changes in the course of economic reforms. 
  Deputy Speaker of Parliament Aleksandr Vengerovskiy of the 
Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] told Interfax that LDP economists 
would outline their own vision of economic reforms and their 
attitude to the president's package at a news conference in 
Moscow on Friday. 
  As for himself, Vengerovskiy thinks that the 
package-envisaged measures are "largely forced ones, though 
positive on the whole". 
  One other LDP deputy Vladimir Lisichkin, himself an 
economist, has praised the package though not the measures it 
set out "are belated and should have been taken a year ago". 
  He said LDP was opposed only to one of the six decrees, 
notably the one lifting export quotas and licences. He said the 
measure aimed at liberalizing foreign trade and called for by 
Yegor Gaydar last year but rejected by the Liberal Democrats was 
nothing but a follow up of the shock treatment of the economy. 
  In the absence of a legislative basis, the measure will 
cause 
further flight of capital to other countries to back up their 
economies rather than Russia's, Lisichkin believes. 
  For his part, Vladimir Semago of the Communist Party said 
that many of the package's points that the opposition raised 
during 1991-1993 were reflected in his party's economic recovery 
plan. 
  The president is clearly moving into our camp and the only 
thing that prevents us from accepting him, he said, is the 
absence of his announcement about early elections and his own 
resignation. 
  At the same time, Semago is opposed to serious economic 
decisions being taken by splashing out a series of decrees. He 
said such decisions must be legislated after passing through 
Duma committees. 
  He accused Yeltsin of pretending to have forgotten whatever 
negative was done. He now pretends to have a new inspiration, 
new aides and to be moving forward which nothing but a cunning 
game, Semago believes.

  [Text] Moscow May 26 TASS -- The State Duma today voted 
against Sergey Baburin's move to express no confidence in the 
government. The move was put to the vote and turned down by the 
overwhelming majority of the deputies. 
  The attempt to topple the Chernomyrdin cabinet had been made 
hot on the heels of the debate in the lower chamber about the 
inadequate deliveries of food and petroleum products to Russia's 
northern regions this year. Baburin proceeded from the critical 
remarks made by the speakers who said the government was 
unjustifiably slow in organising the deliveries.

  [Text] Moscow May 26 TASS -- The threat of leaving the 
population of the northern regions of Russia without fuel and 
food next winter has prompted the State Duma to adopt today a 
resolution "on the emergency situation linked with the 
transportation of oil products and food to the country's far 
northern regions in 1994". 
  Duma member Vladimir Goman informed the MPs during the 
deliberations on the draft of the foregoing resolution that only 
85 per cent of the needed food products, 62 per cent of the 
needed oil products, and 55 per cent of the needed consumer 
goods were delivered to the northern regions of the country by 
May 1, as compared to the volume of 1993. Only 9 per cent of 
the manufactured and technical goods, envisaged by the concluded 
agreements, were so far delivered to those regions. 
  The State Duma resolution instructs several of its 
committees 
to look into the problem of financing the delivery of food 
products to the far north and to territories enjoying the same 
status before June 6, 1994, with due account of the Russian 
Government's view, and to submit to the Duma corresponding 
proposals for the timely and full delivery of the required goods. 
  The Duma noted that the Russian Government was not 
fulfilling 
its own resolution "on changes in the mechanism of state 
financial support to the delivery of products (goods) to regions 
of the far north and to territories enjoying the same status". 
  The State Duma recommended the Council of the Federation to 
jointly approach the president in connection with the 
catastrophic situation with the delivery of vitally needed 
cargoes to the northern population.

  [Text] None of the five candidates to sit on the 
Constitutional Court, nominated by Duma factions, collected the 
required majority of votes (225) in a vote in the parliament's 
lower house on Wednesday. 
  Lawyer Oleg Mironov from the Russian Communist Party's 
faction fared best of all with over 41 percent of the votes. 
  As the Duma Legislative Committee's Chairman Vladimir Isakov 
has reported, factions are entitled to put forward their own 
candidates to the president. 
  When a Constitutional Court bill was debated, the lower 
house 
insisted on its right to put forward its candidates to that 
judicial body and amended the law's wording appropriately. 
  In keeping with Russia's Constitution, the president is to 
make the final selection of candidates to sit on the 
Constitutional Court and the Federation Council is to appoint 
them. 
  The Constitutional Court is made up of 19 judges, 6 posts in 
it are currently vacant.

  [Text] Moscow May 26 TASS -- The lower chamber of the 
Russian federal legislature, the State Duma, approved today what 
Justice Minister Yuriy Kalmykov described as "a document of 
prime importance," the first part of the Civil Code of the 
Russian Federation designed to regulate the most important 
public relations during the country's transition to a market 
economy. 
  The vote was practically unanimous, a rare case in the Duma, 
even though it was preceded by a heated debate. Many speakers 
still remember too well the Soviet Civil Code adopted 30 years 
ago. Common sense prevailed eventually and the chamber approved 
the document after the Agrarian Faction insisted on a 
significant amendment. 
  In preparing the document for second reading, the drafters 
were instructed to proceed from the assumption that the 
alienation and use of land and other natural resources is 
regulated by civil legislation in as much as land and other 
natural resources can be an object of civil turnover under land, 
agrarian and other legislation concerning natural resources.

detachments] units will be examined by the State Duma, it was 
decided today. The chamber set up a special commission to 
prepare the discussion. 
  The move came from a woman deputy from the city of Tver, who 
complained that Omon policemen were "committing outrage" in her 
city, although she adduced no specific facts to confirm the 
statement. 
  The woman said that Omon units "ran riot" in the city last 
October and that she saw no point in "appealing to Minister 
Viktor Yerin" in this context.

  [Text] Head of the temporary administration in the zone of 
the Ossetian-Ingush conflict Vladimir Lozovoy said that the 
state of emergency will be imposed only on a small part of the 
Sunzhenskiy and Malgobekskiy regions of Ingushetia. 
  Asked by IF's correspondent about the possibility of 
excluding this provision from a draft decree on extension of the 
state of emergency in the conflict zone, Lozovoy said: "I do not 
know why this question arises. We agreed on it with the Ingush 
president and he had no objections to it." 
  "These parts of the Sunzhenskiy and Malgobekskiy regions 
will 
perform the role of a buffer zone to prevent penetration of 
militants in the zone of the Ossetian-Ingush conflict," Lozovoy 
said. 
  In the meantime, in neighboring Chechnya armed forces were 
put on alert in connection with the possible expansion of the 
state of emergency in the zone of the Ossetian-Ingush conflict. 
  Groznyy assessed the intention to include the Sunzhenskiy 
and 
Malgobekskiy regions of Ingushetia in the state of emergency 
zone as "an act of open armed aggression." With the lack of an 
administrative border between Chechnya and Ingushetia these 
regions are a subject of dispute between the two republics.

  [Text] The draft decree on expansion of the zone of state 
of emergency to the Ingush regions of Sunzhen and Malgobek is 
needed for settlement of the problem with Chechnya by force, 
Ingush Vice President Boris Agapov suggested. He stressed in an 
interview with Interfax that such "unreasonable decrees seem to 
be needed in order to lay the Russian president open to a blow." 
  Agapov said there was an evident attempt to create 
confrontation between the president and the Federation Council 
which would have to adopt the draft decree on May 31 when the 
term for the state of emergency expired. 
  Agapov emphasized that the process of territorial division 
between Chechnya and Ingushetia concerned these two regions 
which were disputed areas. 
  The decree said that the populated centers which, as 
Ingushetia had agreed, would go to the Chechen Republic of 
Ichkeria, would be included in the zone of the state of 
emergency, Agapov pointed out. 
  In the context of this situation inclusion of the Sunzhen 
and 
Malgobek regions into the state of emergency zone would mean a 
seizure of Chechen territory. It is hard even to imagine all 
consequences of such a move, Agapov underlined. 
  Agapov disapproved of this decision. He announced that when 
he had told the interim administration about it the 
administration had responded that it never knew about such 
serious consequences. 
  Agapov suggested that such recommendations could have been 
given by some politicians from the center who occupied certain 
posts in the federal bodies.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 26 TASS -- The Chechen leadership reacted 
negatively to the possible expansion of the zone under state of 
emergency in some parts of the Sunzha and Malgabek districts in 
Ingushetia. 
  According to the CHECHENPRESS news agency, Chechnya has put 
its troops on alert, the cabinet of ministers will be working in 
accordance with a "military" schedule for one week. Members of 
the cabinet came to a today's meeting in a military uniform. 
  The spreading of the zone under state of emergency to a part 
of the Sunzha and Malgabek districts in Ingushetia is regarded 
by the official Groznyy as an "act of open armed aggression", 
the Chechen department of press and information told ITAR-TASS. 
  Political observers in Groznyy believe that the initiative 
of 
the temporary administration on the expansion of the zone under 
state of emergency in Ingushetia may disrupt a planned meeting 
between Dzhokhar Dudayev and Russian President Boris Yeltsin. 
  CHECHENPRESS reports that the official authorities of Nazran 
believe that an attempt to impose state of emergency in the 
Malgabek and Sunzha districts in Ingushetia may destabilise the 
situation in north Caucasus. 
  At the same time the draft decree on the prolongation of 
state of emergency for another term was agreed with Ingush 
President Ruslan Aushev, head of the temporary administration in 
Moscow Vladimir Lozovoy told ITAR-TASS. 
  This decree really envisages the need to ensure normal work 
conditions for the forces attached to the temporary 
administration in some populated localities in the Sunzha and 
Malgabek districts of Ingushetia. This measure became necessary 
because a number of provocations took place exactly in those 
areas, and the presence of the Chechen police was reported there. 
  Vladimir Lozovoy has no information about an official 
reaction of the Chechen leadership to the draft decree. The 
decree has not yet been adopted and therefore it is not worth 
commenting on this decree before it is issued, the head of the 
temporary administration pointed out.

"Chechnya's Army Has Been Put on Alert. The Republic Is Ready 
To Resist the Expansion of the State of Emergency Zone in 
Ingushetia"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Federation Council Deputy 
Valeriy Fateyev, who recently visited the zone of the 
Ossetian-Ingush conflict, stated that the draft edict on 
extending the state of emergency in its present shape must not 
be signed under any circumstances. According to the deputy, it 
is important to "neutralize" the influence of politicians who 
"draft such edicts" and furthermore understand why they do this, 
he stressed. Mr. Fateyev said that such an approach contradicts 
the interests of the peoples of Russia and the North Caucasus 
because it will undoubtedly evoke a negative reaction from 
Chechnya and Ingushetia, which will aggravate the situation even 
more. 
  The Chechen Republic of Ichkeria has already responded to 
the 
proposed option for stabilizing the situation in the emergency 
zone. Groznyy's official statement disseminated yesterday says 
that "the attempt to spread the emergency regime in the zone of 
the Ossetian-Ingush conflict to these areas will be seen by 
Chechnya as an act of open armed aggression." "The Chechen 
Foreign Ministry regards this as interference in the republic's 
internal affairs and in the event that Russian troops are 
positioned here, will view this as armed aggression," Chechnya's 
Foreign Minister Shamseddin Yusef stated in an interview with 
INTERFAX. According to him, in this event the republic will 
reserve the right to curb invasion of its territory by a foreign 
army. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Nikolay Podlipskiy report: "The Government Does Not Want </F>
to Have An `Island Of The Far East"] 
  [Text] Perhaps for the first time in its history the 
governmental Commission on Operational Matters has discussed 
purely economic problems. The first item on the agenda of the 
Soskovets commission's session yesterday was worded in a fairly 
all-embracing manner: On the Development Prospects of Maritime 
Kray Taking Into Account Russia's Geostrategic and Economic 
Interests in the Asian-Pacific Region. The government reacted 
seriously to the threat of the Far East's economic split from 
European Russia. 
  A central subject in the discussion of Far Eastern problems 
at the commission's session was the growing threat of Russia's 
economic disintegration. There are several reasons for such a 
threat. First of all Maritime Kray's remoteness. This results 
in sharp increases in transportation and energy costs for the 
local enterprises, so making them absolutely uncompetitive on 
the domestic market (even compared to enterprises located in 
European Russia). At the same time Far Eastern ports and 
railroad networks ensure 50 percent of Russia's export 
infrastructure. 
  According to First Deputy Economy Minister Andrey 
Shapovalyants, keeping Maritime Kray basically viable calls for 
approximately $5 billion and 4.5 trillion rubles a year. 
Furthermore, the federal government is seriously worried about 
China's expansion in this region: At present there are 
approximately 150,000 Chinese citizens living in the region 
(many of them illegally). The half-hearted measures taken in 
the past (fixed coal prices, limited subsidies, and so forth) 
alleviated the region's economic burdens only to an extent, 
without resolving the problem in principle. 
  Virtually all the speakers stressed that today there is a 
real threat of Maritime Kray's economy breaking away and 
integrating into the economic system of the Pacific Rim 
countries as a "junior brother" -- a supplier of raw materials. 
The gist of the government's reaction to this threat was summed 
up by Mr. Shapovalyants. In his opinion, it is necessary to 
talk about eventually establishing a "special economic regime" 
in the Far East. 
  It is clear however that spelling out the specific content 
of 
this term is not a matter for the immediate future (a special 
working group will deal with this). Yet even now the main 
features of such a "special zone" can be outlined. According to 
First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets, the government 
should create conditions for using the raw materials potential 
of the Russian Far East precisely in the Far East. 
  The implementation of this concept could lead to the 
formation of a kind of economic enclave -- a part effectively 
independent from European Russia and oriented mainly toward the 
economically most promising region -- the Pacific Rim. In this 
event the main task for the federal government in this region 
will be to retain the military and export infrastructure as well 
as the local administration's political loyalty. 
  Also noteworthy is the idea of establishing a "location 
rent" 
for the Russian/European enterprises, which, although not 
discussed at the session, is contained in a memorandum by the 
State Industry Committee. This means that the situation of Far 
Eastern enterprises is deemed "normal" for Russia's economy 
while the others have to pay a kind of tax compensating for 
their more favorable geographic position. 
  True, as the session's results show, far less radical steps 
should be expected from the federal government in the near 
future. In all likelihood, preferential transport tariffs will 
be established for Maritime Kray (the participants were 
impressed with the experience of the tsarist government which 
used such measures to invigorate economic activity in areas far 
away from Moscow). It is also likely that the sum of budget 
subsidies for the Maritime region will also be revised.

  [Text] The complicated social and economic situation in 
Primorskiy Territory [Maritime Kray] and huge, mainly 
demographic pressure by next door China can pose the threat of 
the region's gradual economic breakaway from Russia, the 
government Economic Management Commission in Moscow said on 
Wednesday. 
  Head of the industrial policy committee Igor Shurchkov said 
that such secession could lead to greater disintegration and a 
sharp deterioration in the country's defence capability. He 
also said that the region's economic hardships, its remoteness 
and Russia's transport troubles were posing a real threat of the 
region being used by Asian-Pacific countries simply as a net 
exporter of mining products and importer of "average quality 
products at best". 
  A resolution was adopted to form a commission of heads of 
regional departments and regional administration representatives 
to work out a package of proposals for economic recovery and on 
the prospects of regional development "in the context of 
Russia's geo-strategic and economic interests in the 
Asian-Pacific region." It was also indicated that the federal 
government and regional administration must meet to discuss the 
question of power sharing with each other.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Valeriy Demidetskiy and </F>
Anatoliy Kholoyuk] 
  [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] May 25 TASS -- Igor Smirnov, 
leader of the split-way Dniester Republic, today accused 
"definite political circles in Russia and Moldova of 
economically blackmailing the Dniester Republic". 
  Addressing a session of the Supreme Soviet of his 
unrecognised republic, he claimed that the said forces were 
"deliberately destabilising the financial situation on the 
left-hand bank of the Dniester River, striving to make Tiraspol 
more tractable in the talks on the withdrawal of the Russian 
14th Army and on problems linked with its property". 
  The Dniester parliament today discussed the acute money 
shortage in the region. Tiraspol had refused to use Moldovan 
leis on its territory and decided to leave in circulation the 
Soviet money, annulled in all the CIS republics. This resulted 
in the catastrophic destabilisation of the financial system and 
led to the growth of inflation. 
  "The 60 billion roubles now in circulation are not enough to 
meet current expenses," Chairman of the Dniester Bank Vyacheslav 
Zagryadskiy told the parliament. He said that the government 
should deliver to Tiraspol the new money printed in Russia for 
the Dniester region. But "this cannot be done now due to the 
ban imposed by the Russian leadership," he noted. 
  The Dniester parliament decided to address an appeal to the 
Russian president, the State Duma and the Council of the 
Federation, asking them to help the Dniester administration 
solve the problem of cash money.

<F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast: Video report by Oleg Padenko] </F>
  [Text] [Padenko] In the old days, when returning from 
assignments to the correspondent's office in Vladivostok, we 
would bring back souvenirs such as exotic shells, ornaments, or 
pictures. Nowadays we bring back mortar fragments like this 
from the scenes of explosions. Although just this type of 
souvenir -- an unexploded mortar shell -- nigh on turned the 
hair of the owner of this kitchen garden in Novonezhino white, 
while this old woman, Praskovya, who by some miracle avoided 
being buried alive in her own home, will now, like many others, 
have to live in another village. 
  [First unidentified speaker] The storage of ammunition in 
our country just takes the cake. They store matches more 
carefully around here than they do ammunition. 
  [Second unidentified speaker] The munitions dumps were 
overfilled with a huge quantity of ammunition brought in from 
the Baltic region over the last few months, which should have 
been destroyed over there somewhere. When the first rumblings 
were heard, I said to myself that I'd bet anything that the 
entire 53d depot was going up in smoke. 
  [Padenko] The old man was right -- 1,600 tonnes, 800 
railcars of lethal weapons exploded, which is equivalent to a 
nuclear bomb. The tremors resounded across Ussuriysk Bay and 
were felt in Vladivostok, houses in several villages burned 
down, and a railroad was destroyed. The memorable munitions 
explosion of two years ago -- you are watching footages of that 
disaster here -- was nothing compared to this. Bombs and 
aviation missiles are still going off at will all over the place 
for miles around. The whole area has been staked out like a 
minefield. Unbelievably, but fortunately... 
  [Unidentified speaker] ...there have been no fatalities. 
Although, taking account of everything, there have been 
something like 23 casualties. 
  [Padenko] But for the mountains and the speedy evacuation, 
things could have been a lot worse. What is needed now is help, 
as the damage runs into tens of billions. But there is no 
money. Which is probably also the reason why the clearly naive 
sailors went to the depots and through criminal ignorance 
started off a small local war. You know, at present the Pacific 
Fleet is more than 30-percent undermanned. Many of the recent 
draftees are quite simply useless. And the amount of finance 
allocated to maintain one of the world's most powerful fleets is 
laughable -- in May alone just 12 percent of the requirement was 
forthcoming. But at the same time I must stress, to 
counterbalance the accusations leveled, that combat readiness 
has actually increased. Mutual relations have improved, and the 
fleet's future is looking brighter. Which is why everybody was 
shocked by the dismissal of Pacific Fleet Commander Admiral 
Gurinov. Officers' assemblies were held in the fleet, and 
appeals to the Russian president to repeal the dismissal were 
adopted. 
  [Rear Admiral A.A. Belousov] This is the opinion of officers 
and instructors at the Pacific Fleet Higher Naval Training 
School named for Admiral Makarov. It is the view of many 
Pacific Fleet commanders. And it is the view of many admirals. 
  [Captain First Rank A.I. Gruzdev] If Admiral Gurinov's 
dismissal from the post of fleet commander is upheld, then the 
Pacific Fleet personnel will see this as a slap in the face. 
  [Padenko] Harsh words, but true. Meanwhile, Vice Admiral 
Khmelnov has been appointed acting commander of the Pacific 
Fleet.

official Kiev, aimed at preserving Ukraine's territorial 
integrity, will not produce the anticipated result. The 
half-hearted measures taken by our authorities to restore the 
constitutional system in Crimea can encourage Russia to 
interfere in the domestic affairs of our state and appropriate 
the Black Sea Fleet." 
  The statement underlines that now, when the international 
situation is favorable for Ukraine, it is necessary to carry out 
a series of resolute measures which will neutralize the course 
of events in Crimea which is detrimental to our statehood. For 
this purpose, it is necessary, in particular, "to dissolve the 
antistate Supreme Council of Crimea because of or the actions 
aimed at violating Ukraine's territorial integrity; to rescind 
the resolution by the Supreme Council of Ukraine on the 
territorial autonomy of Crimea until those nations deported by 
the Soviet-Stalinist regime return to the peninsula; to 
subordinate all the power structures in Crimea to the state 
bodies of Ukraine; to break through the informational blockade 
of Crimea ensuring normal functioning of the electronic mass 
media and circulation of local Ukrainian and all- Ukrainian 
newspapers and magazines; to ensure the validity of all the laws 
of Ukraine on the territory of Crimea as a constituent part of 
the Ukrainian state; to begin negotiations with Russia on 
withdrawing all units of Russian troops and the Black Sea Fleet 
shore-based services from Crimea and the entire Black Sea coast 
of Ukraine."

  [Text] Kiev May 26 TASS -- "We should take joint efforts to 
avoid media confrontation. This can be achieved mostly by means 
of consultations, negotiations and compromises", Ukraine 
president's spokesman Viktor Stelmakh said in an exclusive 
interview with TASS on Thursday. 
  Commenting on the decision by Ukraine's Foreign Ministry to 
strip three newsmen of the Ostankino TV network of their 
accreditation and on the protest of Russian media chiefs against 
this decision, the spokesman noted that recently Ukraine had 
become "an objective of a massed information onslaught by 
Russian and some foreign mass media", adding that "for some 
objective reasons, our information capacities cannot be 
considered adequate". 
  "Perhaps this prompted the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry to 
resort to such a drastic measure as a means of self-defence", he 
explained. 
  According to Stelmakh, Ukraine is also concerned over 
certain 
statements by Russian top officials, which he described as "far 
from being friendly", which cannot but affect relations between 
the two countries. 
  The spokesman expressed confidence that there would not be 
any reasons for "raising a question about violation of 
international law with respect to media representatives" if the 
two states carry on a constructive dialogue for better mutual 
understanding and if newsmen comply with rules of journalists' 
ethics. 
  Stelmakh dismissed recent reports about the possibility of 
discriminatory measures towards TASS correspondents in Ukraine.

  [Text] "The Ukrainian side is not to blame" for failure to 
sign the final document on the Black Sea Fleet's division at the 
Ukrainian-Russian negotiations, the Ukrainian chief negotiator 
Boris Tarasyuk, a deputy foreign minister has told journalists 
on his return from Moscow. 
  In his opinion, the Ukrainian delegation "displayed enough 
flexibility and readiness to compromise." The Ukrainian side, 
he noted, offered five draft accords to choose from. 
  At the same time, Tarasyuk described the latest round of 
talks in Moscow as "very useful." "The shaping-up breakthrough 
justifies the delay with signing a document," he said. 
  In his words, Ukrainian and Russian experts are given ten 
days to agree on terms to divide the Black Sea Fleet and to set 
aside bases for the Russian Navy in Ukraine. 
  He reported that the negotiation partners had reaffirmed the 
outcome of the previous talks on the Black Sea Fleet's division 
and "agreed approaches to the crucial issues" on Russian naval 
facilities. 
  At the same, in his words, "one cannot talk of the complete 
absence of differences, which is natural since the interests of 
the two states are at stake."

<F P=106> [Viktor Yadukha report from Simferopol under general </F>
headline: "Russia and Ukraine Have Divided The Ships. Now They 
Are Only Left To Decide On How To Position Them"] 
  [Text] The situation in Crimea remains quiet. The armored 
personnel carriers spotted the day before on the railroad near 
Simferopol have been towed away to join a national guard brigade 
whose strength, according to Ukrainian First Deputy Interior 
Minister Col. Gen. Valentin Nedrigaylo, will soon reach 2,500. 
  Intensive consultations are under way in the Crimean 
parliament on forming a working group which is to discuss 
outstanding issues with Kiev by 30 May. The group's composition 
is expected to be approved at a Crimean parliament session 
before 27 May. 
  According to reports from Izmail, where a Black Sea Fleet 
river boats brigade is based, a group of Ukraine navy officers 
led by Lt. Col. Krichevskiy arrived at the local Black Sea Fleet 
naval engineers service. He stated that before 1 June a 
corresponding Ukraine Navy unit will be formed on the basis of 
the Izmail division and, on pain of dismissal, demanded that the 
personnel switch their allegiance and serve the Ukraine military 
department. Black Sea Fleet servicemen refused to obey this 
demand. 
  Following this incident, Captain 1st Rank Dmitriy Ukrainets, 
chief of the Ukraine Navy Western Maritime Protection Zone, 
stated that no one had given Lt. Col. Krichevskiy any such 
powers.

  [Text] Brussels [no dateline as received] -- Vitaliy 
Radetskyy, Ukraine's defense minister and general of the Army, 
continued on 26 May his official visit to the NATO headquarters. 
  On 25 May, at the Ukrainian president's instruction, 
Radetskyy handed Sergio Balanzino, deputy chairman of the North 
Atlantic Council, a presentation document outlining guidelines 
for Ukraine's cooperation with NATO states within the 
Partnership for Peace [PFP] program. The submission of this 
document means that Ukraine has become one of the first NATO 
partner states whose relations with the North Atlantic bloc are 
being transferred into a practical framework. The first step of 
Ukraine's cooperation with NATO will be the participation of 
Ukrainian servicemen, together with American, Hungarian, and 
Polish soldiers in a special military exercise scheduled to take 
place this summer in Poland.

  [Text] Ukraine and Crimea have pledged to resolve the 
dispute about the degree of autonomy enjoyed by the Crimean 
peninsula through negotiations. However, according to the 
statement of Ukraine's deputy prime minister Zhulynskyy, 
President Kravchuk intends to dissolve the Crimean Parliament in 
the near future and introduce presidential rule on the territory 
of the peninsula in the event of the Crimean legislators 
refusing to reject the new constitution. It is still not clear 
what place Crimean President Meshkov occupies in the political 
plans of President Kravchuk. One thing is clear -- at any 
moment the situation may get out of control.

deeds either in Crimea or Ukraine, or anywhere else," he

  The president of Crimea appealed to representatives of the

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Karmalito] </F>
  [Text] Simferopol May 26 TASS -- The Crimea is seeking to 
settle differences with Ukraine only at the negotiating table, 
local parliament speaker Sergey Tsekov emphasised in an 
exclusive interview with TASS on Thursday. 
  He gave a positive assessment of today's talks between 
Crimean and Ukrainian parliamentary delegations in Kiev. 
According to him, the negotiating teams managed to reach 
understanding and to enter into dialogue in search for a 
compromise. 
  "We have an impression that Ukraine's Supreme Soviet is 
determined to find a solution to the existing problems and 
realizes that the current complicated situation in the Crimea 
was prompted by certain reasons", Tsekov pointed out. "It is not 
a result of activities of some political extremists and radicals 
that have come to power. This situation is quite objective, and 
problems it is generating should be solved without any use of 
force, but solely by means of negotiations", he stressed. 
  The Crimean parliament speaker believes a mutual compromise 
would determine "Ukraine's fate rather than the Crimea's 
future". He noted that "all that has been done so far just 
tended to drive the existing problems deeper down. In fact, 
tensions were gradually stirred up over the past eighteen months 
of a difficult transition period. Meanwhile, there are no 
grounds for fuelling passions at the moment. Assertions about 
stepped up military preparations in the Crimea do not correspond 
to reality. Although there are certain facts: Amassing of 
Ukraine's national guard troops, sending of armoured combat 
vehicles to Simferopol. But all this is not as serious as one 
could think", Tsekov said. He warned that the situation should 
not be further aggravated. This threatens to affect the 
upcoming season of summer vacations, and therefore to undermine 
the Crimea's local budget. 
  "If one intends to foment a conflict in the Crimea, he will 
not need large military forces, 500 troops will be quite 
enough", the Crimean speaker noted. But combat operations on 
the peninsula would inevitably mean its separation from Ukraine 
forever, he stressed, citing the examples of Nagorno-Karabakh, 
Moldova's Dniester region and Abkhazia. "We do not want this to 
happen. Obviously the use of military force cannot solve the 
existing problems", Tsekov said.

  [Text] Simferopol May 26 TASS -- The Crimean local 
parliament's first session resumed its work on Thursday by 
electing Crimean representatives to a joint working group, which 
is to prepare agreed-upon proposals for the Ukrainian and 
Crimean parliaments. 
  The working group is being set up under a decision taken as 
a 
result of the Kiev talks earlier this week between Ukrainian and 
Crimean plenipotentiary parliamentary delegations. The group 
will include five Crimean lawmakers, as well as four experts in 
law. 
  At the same time, the Crimean parliamentarians postponed at 
least until tomorrow debates on the issue of suspending, for the 
period of the group's activities, the acts passed by parliament 
on May 20, 1994. 
  The session, which ajourned last week after passing a law 
"On 
Restoration of Consitutional Foundations of the Crimean 
Republic's Statehood", is due to approve a new Crimean 
Government named by President Yuriy Meshkov. Lawmakers will 
also discuss a programme for pulling the peninsula out of the 
current economic crisis and for stabilizing its agro-industrial 
complex, as well as endorse a series of presidential decrees. 
  The session is proceeding in a quiet and businesslike 
atmosphere. Passions outside the parliament building calmed 
down. A mere several dozens of demonstrators still go on 
picketing under slogans demanding for greater independence for 
the Crimean republic.

  [Text] Simferopol, [no dateline as received] -- A statement 
by Volodymyr Lephykhov, the chairman of the Security Service of 
Crimea, was circulated in the republic today. 
  Volodymyr Lephykhov believes that the decree by the 
president 
of Ukraine "On the Main Directorate of the Security Service of 
Ukraine in Crimea," signed on 18 May, violates the law of 
Ukraine "On the Security Service." The Supreme Council of 
Ukraine did not consider the changes connected with the decree 
by Leonid Kravchuk, and there is no resolution by the Supreme 
Council of Ukraine that would legally fix the changes in the law. 
  In the opinion of Volodymyr Lephykhov, all this gives 
grounds 
to believe that the decree by the president of Ukraine of 18 May 
"is illegal and illegitimate in all respects." 
  "In the present-day complicated situation such actions raise 
strong doubts about the assurances by the official circles of 
Ukraine that they wish to ensure durable civil peace and accord, 
the rights and freedoms of every citizen in Crimea," says the 
statement by the Crimean Security Service chairman.

  [Text] Ukrainian people's deputy Leonid Kuchma, leader of 
the inter-regional bloc of reforms and candidate to the 
Ukrainian presidency, believes that "one should rule out any 
military solution to the Crimean issue." "A treaty is the only 
way to settle the conflict," says Kuchma's statement distributed 
on Thursday. 
  In his opinion, "it is possible and necessary" to preserve 
the territorial integrity and inviolability of Ukraine's borders 
by establishing relations with Crimea on the basis of a treaty 
minding the Constitutions of Ukraine and Crimea." 
  Kuchma underlined that the Crimean parliament had no legal 
right to adopt a decision on restoration of Crimea's 
Constitution dated May 6, 1992 "without preliminary negotiations 
with Kiev." 
  The Crimean deputies, he says, "appeared in a trap prepared 
by those political forces which want to destabilize the 
situation in Crimea in order to cancel the presidential 
elections and the elections of Ukraine's local power bodies 
scheduled for June 26." 
  At the same time, Kuchma believes that several Ukrainian 
political forces "who constantly speak about the need to deprive 
Crimea of its autonomy, should carry their share of 
responsibility for this tension." 
  "Everything that is going on in Crimea over the last two 
years is being done with the silent consent and approval of 
Kiev," stresses the statement. Kuchma places "a substantial 
share of responsibility" on several Russian politicians of 
"chauvinist orientation" who provoked the Crimean radicals to 
urge immediate rejection of Ukrainian jurisdiction. 
  Kuchma concluded that "all attempts of the new states on the 
territory of the former USSR to solve the problems of autonomy 
by coercive means had led to war and only after bloody battles 
the parties saw the need to sit at the negotiating table."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondent Sergey Karmalito] </F>
  [Text] Simferopol, 26 May -- The "prosperity in unity" 
slogan which is written on the Crimean coat of arms today did 
not work: The Supreme Council deputies turned down the Cabinet 
proposed by the republic's president, Yuriy Meshkov. It has 
been decided to return to the discussion after Vice President 
Yevgeniy Saburov provides the Supreme Council permanent 
commissions a detailed structure of the Cabinet of Ministers, in 
which several posts have been offered to politicians and 
economists from Moscow. 
  The discussion in which representatives of different 
parliamentary groups took part demonstrated a significant 
difference of opinion. To a certain degree it confirmed the 
president's description of the evolved situation as the "third 
government crisis." Yuriy Meshkov's demonstrative gesture 
increased the impression when he left the room when his proposal 
was rejected together with the Cabinet which was not approved. 
  Nevertheless, behind the scenes there is an opinion that the 
deputies will be able to find a mutually acceptable way out of 
the evolved impasse. 
  The session will continue tomorrow.

  [Text] [Announcer] Today's reports testify to some 
stabilization of the Crimea situation. Let us hear what Mayak's 
ever-objective correspondent Vladimir Plotnikov has to say. 
  [Plotnikov] Good day. Today we have the session of the 
Crimea Supreme Council continuing--that is where emotions are 
highest. The main issue is forming a government for the 
republic and the working group to continue the talks with the 
Ukrainian side on the problems of which you and our listeners 
are well aware. 
  The deputies did decide to deal with the first issue, the 
working group, first of all, because continuing the talks and 
curbing the tension between Simferopol and Kiev are 
exceptionally important and time is very tight--just 10 days. 
More than half the time that has been allocated has already 
passed. Having discussed the personalities, the deputies 
elected the working group and the Ukrainian Supreme Council will 
now also appoint a group. In the next few days they will 
continue their joint search for ways out of the political 
confrontation. 
  Peace and calm in the peninsula are essential conditions for 
economic reform. Removing this tension is absolutely vital and 
this is what Deputy prime Minister Yevgeniy Saburov talked about 
in his speech. He addressed the deputies for 40 minutes, 
outlined the main problems for the economy of Crimea and the 
options there are for its development. He then spent 90 
minutes, maybe more, answering questions, and after that there 
was even more discussion and something I think was quite 
unexpected--for Saburov himself and even for President Meshkov: 
The majority of deputies were very sharply critical of the 
government's program, in particular, for being woolly, for not 
making provision for public welfare for the poor, for not taking 
account of the ideas and suggestions of Crimean economists and 
their managers in the economy. Key posts in the government have 
been allocated not to local officials, but to people from Moscow. 
  It began to look like a government crisis, and President 
Yuriy Meshkov took the floor. You know how passionately he can 
speak, and that is how he spoke on this occasion. He appealed 
to the deputies to cast aside grievances and reproaches and to 
vote for the government. Several proposals were then made. 
Saburov spoke once again and deputies then broke up for a 
recess, for consultations, and at 1720--in one hour's time--they 
will gather for the vote. So I hope we will find out what the 
outcome of our latest government crisis--and I hope that the 
crisis will not materialize, that the deputies will vote for--in 
an hour's time.

Perestroyka] representative would lead the commission on nuclear 
policy and nuclear safety. 
  The Unity faction will lead the commission on juridical 
policy and state structure, that on local government and the 
commission on economic policy. 
  Representatives of the Center group will head the commission

representatives; the Center deputy group - 43; the socialist 
faction - 25; the agrarian faction - 33; the Unity faction - 
27; the Reforms deputy group - 26 and the Statehood faction 26

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Oleksandr Moroz Suspended As </F>
Ukrainian Socialist Party Leader"] 
  [Text] On 21 May, the Ukrainian Socialist Party [SPU] 
Political Council held a meeting. The SPU leadership met 
Oleksandr Morozov's request and decided to suspend his powers as 
the party's leader. According to a declaration issued by the 
Political Council, this was a justified move: The Supreme 
Council chairman is not allowed to pursue internal party 
interests (which are many) to the detriment of national 
interests (which are even more). On the other hand, the 
document's authors said that Oleksandr Moroz will remain 
unquestioned leader of the party. Sergey Kishko, people's deputy 
and assistant professor at the Donetsk State Technical 
University, was appointed acting head of the organization. 
According to its statute, the issue of the party's chairman 
will be examined at its congress set for this fall. Curiously 
enough, Oleksandr Moroz did not attend the meeting since he went 
to Kanev to participate in festivities devoted to the reburial 
of Taras Shevchenko's remains.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Karmalito] </F>
  [Text] Simferopol May 26 TASS -- Crimean economy is in "the 
gravest condition". This diagnosis was included in the report 
of Crimean Vice-Premier Yevgeniy Saburov, who addressed the 
first session of the Supreme Soviet (parliament) of the 
peninsular republic, which resumed its work on Thursday. 
  According to Saburov, one of the major contributing factors 
to the economic situation consists in Ukraine's opposition 
towards initiatives aimed at economic stabilization, which 
resulted in virtual disruption of the forthcoming summer 
vacation season. (Crimea used to be one of the most popular 
places to spend one's summer vacation in the former Soviet 
Union; it is famous for its numerous resorts, beaches, 
entertainments, etc.) 
  When explaining measures suggested by the Crimean Government 
and aimed to lead the republic out of the crisis, Saburov 
pointed out the task of attracting external investments. 
  In his opinion, developing the transportation sphere should 
be the first priority - that is, developing a network of 
airports and sea ports, establishing a trade route along the 
Strait of Kerch. 
  The second guideline is the recreation field based on 
Crimea's huge resort/sanatorium potential and oriented to the 
average consumer. 
  Investments in development of the oil and gas-extracting 
industry are also important, but, however, potential damage to 
Crimean nature has to be taken into account. 
  To conclude, the vice-premier pointed out reinforcing the 
leading industries and agriculture. 
  He described privatization as one of the major means of 
raising production effectiveness. He also envisioned a 
substantial liberalization in the economic field, an open-door 
policy in respect of investors and lifting many other 
restrictions. 
  In Saburov's opinion, it will take about two years for 
Crimea 
to overcome the crisis, provided that "the government acts 
correctly". 
  When debating on the report, lawmakers made some pungent 
criticisms in regard of the report and the proposed programme 
for stabilizing the economy. 
  Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov emphasized that it is 
absolutely inadmissible to accuse the government, which has not 
actually set about working, which does not exist in point of 
fact. 
  Meshkov called upon the lawmakers to realize the full 
measure 
of their responsibility before the people of Crimea, to 
appreciate the confidence they are enjoying and take care of the 
interests of the Crimeans, rather than their own ambitions and 
self-esteem.

  [Excerpt] If power engineering stops, all other industries 
will stop. This was what Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk 
told a conference of electric power engineering enterprises' 
managers. Conditions are rife for this. The situation that has 
come about in this basic industry of exceptional significance to 
the national economy, is extremely complex and serious. There 
are, in particular, quite a lot of problems in nuclear power 
engineering that, to a considerable extent, ensured the work of 
the national economic complex last winter. 
  Even now we are fulfilling our commitments to the state and 
increasing the output of the cheapest kind of electric power, 
said Mykhaylo Umanets, Ukraine's DerzhKomAtom [State Committee 
for the Use of Nuclear Power] chairman. All our reserves have 
unfortunately been extended. Some of the generating sets have 
not been provided with fuel and will stop in the very near 
future. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Kiev, 26 May -- "There is no disruption in the 
staffing of troop units today," said Major-General Valeriy 
Venher, head of the main organization and mobilization 
directorate of the general Headquarters of Ukraine's Armed 
Forces, at an armed forces briefing on the problems of staffing 
and conscription. 
  With regard to the "Crimean problem", Valeriy Venher said 
that conscription in Crimea is going according to plan, and that 
the military commissar in the autonomy is obeying only the 
orders of Ukraine's commander in chief and minister of defense. 
  Valeriy Venher refused to quote any figures concerning the 
draft or discharge, saying "they are not to be made public." 
He did say that 800 people did alternative service last year. 
On the whole, the head of the organization and mobilization 
main directorate believes, this type of service found little 
support among conscripts.

  [Text] The Ukrainian Defense Ministry press service issued 
a report in which it draws attention to the instances connected 
with a provocation attempt against the command post of the radio 
engineering brigade of the anti-aircraft defense forces of our 
state located in Sevastopol. Two instances have occurred over 
the past few days that testify to such intentions. What the 
press service has in mind is the fact that places, prepared by 
unknown persons for planting an explosive, and a wire laid down 
to blow it up, were discovered near the above command post. 
Quite probably, says the report, this could have been done by 
an unknown person detained here, who turned out to be a reserve 
Black Sea Fleet officer. A large amount of the explosive has 
been confiscated from him. 
  The Ukrainian Defense Ministry press service reports that 
competent bodies launched an investigation into the above 
instances. The name of the detained person has not been 
disclosed so far in the interests of the investigation.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Olga Semenova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 26 TASS -- "There are, unfortunately, 
still forces in the world which would like to weaken Russia, to 
make her a weak country with a cheap working force and a low 
intellectual potential" said Russian President Boris Yeltsin on 
Thursday, speaking at an all-Russia meeting of the leadership of 
the Russian Federal Counter-intelligence Service. 
  With this in mind, the president emphasized that ideological 
conflicts are being replaced by a struggle for spheres of 
influence in geopolitics, in which Russia's integration into the 
world economy is seen as a threat to the national interests of 
several leading states who see Russia as a competitor in 
everything. 
  Therefore, Yeltsin said, "no matter what changes occur in 
Russia and the world, it will be a very long time before 
counter-intelligence specialists are threatened by unemployment". 
  There are those who would like to take Russia's natural 
resources and acquire her leading technologies in several 
spheres. The recent exposure of several foreign spies in Russia 
is evidence of this, the president said. But the work of the 
federal counter-espionage people should not be judged by the 
number of spies they catch. The most important thing, Yeltsin 
said, is preventive work; first of all, "espionage activities in 
Russia must be prevented". 
  The president also expressed serious concern over the 
"dissolution of the state secret system". The reforming of 
ministries, the destruction of the control over secrets which 
was formerly exercised by individual government and economic 
sectors, and the unfounded liquidation of many supervising state 
bodies have resulted in the disorganisation of the former system 
of keeping state secrets. 
  Russia has adopted the law, "On State Secrets", but a new 
system of defending state secrets has not yet been created on 
its foundation. Yeltsin expressed his opinion that only the 
federal counter-intelligence service is capable of reliably 
protecting state secrets under the current conditions. 
Non-state structures especially need that department's help in 
developing and implementing protection measures, the president 
said.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Olga Semenova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 26 May (ITAR-TASS) -- In his speech to the 
conference of leaders of the Federal Counterintelligence Service 
(FSK) from all over Russia, the Russian President Boris Yeltsin 
paid special attention to the FSK's role in countering illegal 
attempts to overthrow the constitutional system. 
  In Russia, the president said, there are certain parties, 
movements, public figures, and citizens who resort to unlawful 
methods of struggle but they do not always receive the rebuff 
they deserve. In this respect, Boris Yeltsin believes, there 
are still many deficiencies in the work of the FSK itself, since 
existing laws are quite adequate to neutralize extremism of this 
kind. 
  The president regards every organized attempt to overthrow 
the existing constitutional system as a blow against Russian 
statehood, as a major failure on the part of federal special 
services. Here the key task of counterintelligence is always to 
obtain "preemptive information". However, Boris Yeltsin made it 
clear that he was not referring to control over the political 
behavior of citizens or their views. All he had in mind is the 
need to expose, forestall, and put a stop to unconstitutional 
activities by extremist elements. If these guidelines are 
strictly adhered to, the Russian president believes, this area 
of the special services' activities will not degenerate into 
political surveillance. 
  A large part of the head of state's report was devoted to 
the 
activities of military counterintelligence, whose task is to 
protect the army against anybody who seeks to gain access to 
military secrets or installations. But the results of military 
counterintelligence need to be much more productive. Preemptive 
information is not being obtained about violation of conditions 
in which weapons and ammunition are supposed to be kept. The 
president expects military counterintelligence to keep him 
regularly informed about the country's nuclear security and 
attempts to procure any weapon of mass destruction, both in 
Russia and elsewhere. There must not be any instances of 
"nuclear terrorism" in Russia, he said. 
  The president also dwelt on the FSK's role in resolving 
ethnic contradictions within the country. Counterintelligence's 
entire arsenal of manpower and resources must be harnessed to 
this, he believes.

  [Text] President Yeltsin stated that Russia needed reliable 
and efficient special services. "We must shake off the burden 
of totalitarianism, but do away with the destructive moods in 
the Federal Counterintelligence Service [FSC]," he told the 
FCS's national conference on Thursday. 
  To quote Yeltsin, Russia must play a worthy role in the 
world 
community and efficiently protect its independence, territorial 
integrity and historical traditions. 
  He also said that new approaches must be laid to the system 
of Russian security. "We must have a systematic and exhaustive 
information about the situation in Russia and around it," he 
said. Yeltsin expects the Federal Counterintelligence Service to 
provide clear-cut estimates and ideas on ways of neutralizing 
and eliminating threats to Russia's security. He also said that 
the FCS must give forecasts and proposals on possible political 
decisions. The FCS has a sufficient potential for analysis and 
operational forecasts, said Yeltsin.

  [Text] Moscow May 27 TASS -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin told the collegium of the Federal Counterintelligence 
Service (FCIS) on Thursday that he had sent to the State Duma 
for approval the law on the Federal Counterintelligence Service 
after endorsing it, the FCIS chief, Sergey Stepashin announced 
at the continuing conference of the service leaders. 
  The passing of the law will strengthen the legal framework 
which is now operating on the basis of the regulation signed by 
the president in January. 
  While in the FCIS, Yeltsin proposed to restore the 
investigative department to the service, which had been taken 
away from it after the president had signed a decree in December 
ordering the reorganization of the security agencies of the 
Russian Federation. It has become clear since that time that the 
move complicated the activity of the FCIS, as well as of the 
prosecutor's office and the interior affairs agencies. They had 
to investigate cases for which they had no adequate experience 
and lacked appropriate support.

<F P=106> [Vyacheslav Morozov report under the "Special Services" </F>
rubric: "Who Is Who in the Federal Counterintelligence 
Service?"] 
  [Text] According to reports, today President Yeltsin is 
scheduled to address a meeting of Federal Counterintelligence 
Service [FCS] chiefs. 
  Boris Yeltsin's particular attention to the special 
services, 
especially after the well-known October events, is a conspicuous 
sign. The top state official's visits to the head offices first 
of the Foreign Intelligence Service and now of the FCS prove 
that all the persistent talk about upcoming transformations at 
the special services that are allegedly designed finally to lay 
to rest the very memory of the KGB is nothing more than idle 
speculation. 
  Another side to the top level contacts with the FIS and the 
FCS is that the president is undoubtedly placing increasing 
emphasis on career specialists and minimizing the prospects for 
the emergence of "aliens," such as Ye. Savostyanov, who is said 
to be considering resigning, at these offices. Another 
possibility is that the presidential staff was swift to react to 
Gennadiy Zyuganov's eloquence at the 9 May meeting outside the 
Lubyanka buildings, where he called on KGB officers to make 
their choice. Those on high are also making their choice, which 
is why it is hardly a coincidence that speculation has mounted 
about high-ranking "old-timers" gaining clout in the FCS 
leadership, particularly General Stepashin, FCS first deputy 
chief, and Colonel General Safronov, who rose from the KGB ranks 
to the very top. They claim that none other than Safronov is in 
charge of the entire service's operational management, whereas 
Stepashin has to put up with rather ceremonial functions. As a 
matter of fact, the first FCS chief, N. Glushko, is still in 
service, however inconspicuous his current presence might be. 
Well, intelligence is too important a business to be entrusted 
to amateurs.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] The transformation of the Russian presidential 
administration's control department in a similar body attached 
to the president does not mean that this structure will turn 
into a total and all-mighty instrument of control, head of the 
Board's Department of Foreign Relations Andrey Petrov told 
Interfax on Thursday. 
  "We are turning into an information-analytical structure 
which would cooperate with the Foreign Intelligence Service, the 
Federal Counter-Intelligence Service and the tax inspection," he 
believes. Petrov noted that the priority task of the board which 
previously dealt with checking the implementation of laws and 
decrees, will be the preparation of informational-analytical 
materials for the Russian leader about the activities of the 
federal power bodies and power bodies of the subjects of the 
Federation. 
  Speaking about the right to demand documents necessary for 
check-ups from enterprises and organizations, Petrov pointed out 
that the board has no intention to violate the law on commercial 
secret. "Our enquiries may concern regular information about the 
financial and economic activities," he said. 
  According to Petrov, commercial structures will not be the 
main target of check-ups. "We are more interested in the federal 
and regional power structures and high-ranking officials," he 
said. 
  Petrov noted that the president's decision to transform the 
board was not caused by some current political reasons, and by 
no means is linked with the package of economic decrees signed 
recently by Boris Yeltsin. IF Note: According to the provision 
on control board at the president, it performs the following 
functions: prepares and presents to the president analytical 
information about activities of federal power bodies, state 
power bodies of the subjects of the Federation on implementation 
of the Russian Constitution, decrees and orders of the 
president, checks activities of the federal executive power 
bodies, executive bodies of the subjects of the Federation, 
their leaders and apparatus, as well as institutions and 
organization, carries out check-ups of activities of the 
presidential administration's division, considers complaints and 
appeals of citizens, enterprises, institutions and organization; 
analyzes activities of special control and supervision bodies of 
the federal executive power bodies and their subdivisions in 
regions, etc.

  [Text] Moscow May 26 TASS -- A working group consisting of 
representatives of the president, members of the government and 
Russian lawmakers suggested a single concept of adopting laws 
aimed at the formation of civic society in Russia. 
  In an interview with ITAR-TASS presidential aide Georgiy 
Satarov pointed out that laws on elections, referendums, parties 
and local government "should be adopted in a single package 
which would meet comprehensive principles of interaction between 
society and the state." 
  For the realisation of the proposal members of the working 
group expressed support to the initiative suggested by the 
Russian president, the Federation Council and the State Duma to 
set up a joint commission for coordinating legislative 
activities of the branches of power.

<F P=106> [Valeriya Ochinyan report: "Conference of President's </F>
Representatives. President's Deputies Will Each Get a Chamber"] 
  [Text] Presidential representatives in the federation 
components, who seem to have become wearied with longing for the 
attention of journalists who are currently more interested in 
the doings of local governors and speakers, have decided to 
issue a reminder that they are there. During a conference of 
the president's representatives in the regions of Siberia and 
the Urals that ended late in the evening in Kurgan on Tuesday, 
the "sovereign's men" decided to take into their own hands the 
implementation of the Treaty on Social Accord in the regions. 
  As their rivals in the shape of local bodies of power are 
growing stronger, the struggle of the president's 
representatives to contain the inferiority complex that they are 
developing takes on paramount importance. Therefore the idea 
born in the depths of the president's staff to organize public 
chambers was taken up with considerable enthusiasm. This 
involves setting up regional analogues of the Public Chamber 
under the president of Russia, where the main regional political 
forces would be uniting under the warm wings of the presidential 
deputies. 
  Assessing the creation of such public chambers as a correct 
step which also makes it possible to implement in the regions 
the provisions of the Treaty on Social Accord, the presidential 
representatives from 11 krays and oblasts elaborated their own 
proposals regarding the functioning of the public chambers. In 
the first place, they think, the chambers should not be put 
there by order, one can only recommend that they be created. To 
have some weight, members of the chambers ought to have the 
right to speak in regional legislative bodies, and to 
participate in agreeing on presidential edicts before they have 
become signed. Nor did the president's representatives forget 
about the material problems of public chambers, asking Boris 
Yeltsin to arrange for financing them. 
  However, the optimistic statements from the conference 
podium 
slightly diverged from the skeptical utterances in the lobby. 
Some of its participants think that any positive effect from 
creating the chambers is rather doubtful because they would be 
joined mainly by minority parties with no serious power base. 
Besides, the very existence of presidential representatives in 
the regions has not been formalized by law, hence the public 
chambers to be created under them would have no secure legal 
status.

<F P=106> [Leonid Kostrov report in the "Geography" column: "`Closed' </F>
Cities Will Appear On The Maps"] 
  [Text] Work is under way in the production association 
Kartographiya on preparing new maps which for the first time 
will feature some of the populated areas earlier considered 
secret, under new names designated by the Russian government. 
Thus, Krasnoyarsk- 26 will become Zheleznogorsk; 
Krasnoyarsk-45, Zelenogorsk; Shkotovo-17 in Maritime Kray has 
received the name of Fokino; Svobodnyy-18 in Amur Oblast, where 
in place of a strategic missile force division a space center is 
being set up, has been called Uglegorsk. Kapustin Yar-1 has 
become Znamenskiy; Arzamas-16 has been named Kremlev; Penza-19, 
Zarechnyy; Perm-76, Zvezdnyy; Sverdlovsk-44, Norouralsk; and 
Tomsk-7, Seversk. 
  Overall, 38 hitherto secret cities figure in the government 
document, On the Official Geographic Names of Populated Areas 
Located in Closed Administrative-Territorial Formations. The 
secret installations and associated technology in these cities 
have of course remained but geographic names have nothing to do 
with this. It is another question to what extent the new names 
correspond to toponomy: If anything, there are plenty of 
"ugle-zhelezhno-zeleno-" derivatives in the names of Russian 
cities already. 
  As Yakov Topchiyan, Kartographiya's chief editor, told 
SEGODNYA's correspondent, the formerly secret cities will be 
shown primarily on maps of scale 1:100,000 and 1:200,000. So 
far maps of this scale are marked "for official use only." They 
will also appear on generally available maps, for instance, maps 
of federation components in particular, Amur Oblast and Maritime 
and Khabarovsk Kray. Some of the 38 cities will also be 
indicated in the soon to be published Atlas of Russia's 
Automobile Roads.

  [Text] The discussion and, especially, the revision of 
borders has always been a fraught business, so to speak, even if 
it only takes place on paper. Participants in an international 
conference on cartography which opened in Moscow today know this 
well. Over to our correspondent, Andrey Zenkov: 
  [Zenkov] In various eras, no matter how different the 
prevailing social system, no matter how complex the internal and 
external political situation, the Geographical Department, the 
Maps Department, the Supreme Geodesic Directorate, the Main 
Directorate for Cartography attached to the Council of Ministers 
and, now, Russia's Federal Service for Geodesy and Cartography, 
have always done basically the same job. With assistance from 
their experts they entered on maps the dividing lines which 
politicians, assisted by the military, decided on. For 68 years 
of its 75-year existence the Russian cartographic service has 
answered to the KGB, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the State 
Committee for Construction, the Ministry of Ecology, or the 
Ministry of Natural Resources. Each of these bodies had its own 
priorities. 
  [Begin Zhalkovskiy recording] We have now managed to 
declassify maps in the 1:1,000,000 series, the 1:500,000 series, 
and the 1:200,000 series. The Ministry of Defense has also 
agreed to the declassification of the 1:100,000 series. Maps 
for the use of the public, including maps of oblasts, maps of 
rayons, and maps of regions, are being produced on the basis of 
these maps. We will produce these maps. In fact we have 
already started. They will be very detailed. You will be able 
to find your own village -- and maybe even your own house on 
them. [end recording] 
  As Yevgeniy Zhalkovskiy, first deputy head of the service, 
told me, few people realize that throughout the entire existence 
of the USSR, the only countries with whom we had official 
agreements on the mapping of borders were Finland, Poland, 
Korea, and Mongolia. Today special commissions are discussing 
these extremely difficult issues with the Baltic republics and 
the countries of the Caucasus region.

  [Text] Investigators into last October's parliamentary 
uprising made serious mistakes, a commission of the Prosecutor 
General's Office concluded. This is precisely why Deputy 
Prosecutor General Vladimir Kravtsev was dismissed. 
  Although the formula of indictment on former Vice President 
Aleksandr Rutskoy, ex-Speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov and former 
Deputy Soviet Defence Minister Vladislav Achalov was ready in 
January, this was delayed because of incomplete work on 
plaintiffs and damage sustained. Other mistakes include lack of 
coordination and duplication of work by separate investigating 
teams. The files were kept apart and none of the teams had 
enough information to substantiate the case. 
  The commission also indicated that a substantial part of 
external investigating officers had little experience with 28 
percent of prosecuting officers and 33 percent of police 
investigators having work records of less than three years. As 
many as 7,000 witnesses had been questioned and the identity 
established of 151 dead victims and 913 wounded casualties by 
February 22 when the State Duma declared an amnesty. 
  Apart from subjective reasons, the investigation was also 
hampered because of delays caused by a number of government 
bodies. Despite the PGO's [Prosecutor General's Office] repeated 
requests, no estimates were provided of the damage done to the 
buildings of the Russian parliament and Moscow mayor's office.

"Democratic Russia's Federal Party To Have Unblemished Members. 
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn To Choose New President"] 
  [Text] The threat of fascism owing to the stepped-up 
activity of nationalist forces, the possibility of 
totalitarianism because of the communists' revanchist schemes, 
and the formalization of "neo-Brezhnev rule" by the monopolism 
of the corrupt oligarchy were the trends named at a news 
conference by leaders of the Democratic Russia movement, on the

  Galina Starovoytova, Lev Ponomarev, Anatoliy Korotich, and 
other members of the organizing committee, explaining the need 
for setting up a new political organization, told journalists 
that the Democratic Russia Federal Party [DRFP] is designed to 
defend the foundation of democracy -- civil society aiming at a 
socially oriented market economy. According to Ms. 
Starovoytova, the party will absorb the middle class: 
medium-size and small businessmen, the intelligentsia, 
qualified workers, and farmers -- people whose financial 
involvement in the party organization the committee lacks so 
badly at this stage. As it is embarking on a 
non-confrontational path, the party will do its utmost to 
overcome the breakup that is currently characteristic of the 
democratic movement by cooperating with all who will resist the 
threat of fascism and totalitarianism. 
  Unlike U.S. parties that are activated only during election 
campaigns, the new Russian party is called upon to be active all 
the time; its ranks are open for anyone wishing to join it after 
a procedure of "soft ceremonial purification" that, organizing 
committee member Andrey Frolov said, will bar the "old 
nomenklatura" and "former KGB agents" from entering the 
political organization that is being set up by people "who have 
never been CPSU members." 
  The founders think that their party's federal status will be 
bolstered by Democratic Russia local branches: chiefs of 30 
regional branches left the meeting that ended 22 May with the 
organizing committee's membership cards. The chiefs of the 
remaining 15 branches, while voicing no objections in principle, 
decided that "the matter should be discussed at home" first. 
"Moscow's diktat" in the new party will be ruled out because 
the capital organization will get one vote just as any regional 
branch. 
  On the economic side, which was described as "a prolonged 
shock," the fledgling party members predicted a social upheaval 
at the end of summer or the beginning of fall; to avert it they 
suggested that the government resume "economic reform that has 
been effectively halted." If political reform is to be resumed 
also, the DRFP organizing committee thinks that all democratic 
forces should unite into a bloc, something which, according to 
Lev Ponomarev's forecast, should take place "sometime near the 
fall." The bloc, according to Democratic Russia's plan, should 
nominate a single candidate for president in the upcoming 
elections. The speakers in the news conference would not 
speculate who precisely it may be, but they pinned some hopes on 
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, who "with his keen feeling...would help 
choose a future leader" by formulating "a patriotic Russian idea 
in non-chauvinist words and expressions."

<F P=106> [Gleb Cherkasov report under the "Hypotheses" rubric: </F>
"Gennadiy Zyuganov Is Choosing A Future For Russia. Rutskoy And 
Zhirinovskiy May Disagree With Him"] 
  [Text] Gennadiy Zyuganov, leader of the Communist Party of 
the Russian Federation [CPRF], while meeting with the public in 
Samara, divulged his views on what he sees as the most likely 
scenarios of sociopolitical developments in Russia. According 
to Comrade Zyuganov, at this stage there are three. 
  According to the first scenario, the "merger" between the 
authorities and the criminal structures will continue. Gennadiy 
Zyuganov pointed out that this development of events is 
eliciting extreme concern among both Russian and foreign 
politicians. The second option, which envisions "a social 
explosion accompanied by mass protests of badly-off groups 
driven to despair," does not suit the CPRF leader, either, 
because, in his view, the current "top authorities" will 
definitely try to shift all the blame on to mid- level local 
leaders, thanks to whom, Comrade Zyuganov believes, Russia still 
"holds." 
  The CPRF leader sees the best possible scenario as the 
coming 
to power of patriotic forces. Gennadiy Zyuganov pointed out 
that the opposition forces would like to start work on the 
restoration of the USSR (apparently, not in the capacity of 
non-government organizations) as early as by the 50th 
anniversary of victory in the Great Patriotic War. Comrade 
Zyuganov said that the congress of the "Accord for Russia" 
movement on 28 May will make a number of decisions that will 
help form a formidable and well-structured opposition. 
  At the same time, the movement's relations with two other 
large opposition associations -- the "State" ["Derzhava"] 
movement being set up by Aleksandr Rutskoy and Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR] -- are 
still uncertain. Presently they disagree at least on one thing. 
So, according to Gennadiy Zyuganov, "the presidency, as it 
stands now, is detrimental to the country." However, any 
attempts to weaken the presidency will evidently draw a 
disapproving reaction from Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. 
  As for Aleksandr Rutskoy's stance, the Russian Social 
Democratic People's Party leader said recently that he "somewhat 
mistrusts the CPRF" because of its stance both in August 1991 
and in October 1993. Moreover, Mr. Rutskoy is also unlikely to 
be very enthusiastic about the abolition of the presidency or 
any considerable restriction of his powers.

<F P=106> [Aleksey Zuychenko report under the "Poll" rubric: "`Firm </F>
Order' and `Strong Authority' Will Win in Next Presidential 
Elections. They Would Have Once Again Elected Yeltsin This 
Week"] 
  [Text] Two years before presidential elections in Russia, 
Liberal Democrat leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy continues in third 
position on the list of probable contenders for this position, 
conceding first and second positions to Boris Yeltsin and 
Grigoriy Yavlinskiy respectively. At least, this is what 
transpires from the results of a poll commissioned by SEGODNYA 
and conducted by the All-Russia Center for the Study of Public 
Opinion poll 14-18 May among 1,620 respondents representing the 
Russian Federation's urban population. 
  Mr. Zhirinovskiy's escapades, to all appearances, continue 
to 
hold appeal for his former voters, while the squabbles inside 
the party and the virtual split in the Duma faction of the 
Liberal Democratic Party of Russia are having no effect on the 
attitude to its leader. Supporters of the Liberal Democrats' 
fuhrer still regard him as the only man who can act on their 
demand for "strong authority" and "a real leader." It is these 
notions that rate first on the scale of "civic values" of Mr. 
Zhirinovskiy's voters. 
  However, judging from the poll, neither the "pro-market" nor 
"pro-democracy" supporters of Russia's current president are 
free from the predilection for a "firm hand." 
  Aleksandr Rutskoy, who was noted some time ago as the main 
rival to Mr. Zhirinovskiy in the contest for the lumpen-like 
electorate, has so far been unable to regain the second position 
he held in the rating list before the coup. Now one can be 
totally sure that the general's golden moment has been left 
behind. 
  As for Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, his probable electorate (among 
the four leaders) in future elections looks more eroded than the 
others. This is most likely because voters have a vague idea of 
the real difference between Mr. Yavlinskiy's policy and that of 
his rivals on the possible election list.

  [Text] State Duma Deputy Andrey Makarov (from the "12 
December" Liberal Democratic Union faction) assaulted Captain 
Second Rank Mikhail Ivanov, adviser to Liberal Democratic Party 
of Russia [LDPR] chief Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, on Wednesday. The 
victim said that he was trying to hand over the seventh and 
eighth chapters of the global concept of public security in 
Russia he had drawn up to Yuliy Gusman, his colleague in the 
deputy corps. In response to Gusman's flat refusal to 
familiarize himself with the paper, Captain Ivanov himself 
acknowledged, he said imprudently: "If you don't read it you 
will end up like Makarov." Hearing his name is so dubious a 
context, Andrey Makarov hit the LDPR adviser with a case, 
smashed his lip, tore off a pocket from his uniform, and tried 
to tear his shoulder boards.

  [Text] The Supreme Council of the Liberal-Democratic Party 
[LDP] accused the editor-in-chief of the newspaper Izvestiya of 
refusing to publish its letter of protest against Yegor Gaydar's 
article entitled "A Stalk on Rascals." The article said that 
"all the classical attributes of a fascist party, ideology and 
personality perfectly apply to Zhirinovskiy and his party." 
  The Liberal Democratic Party's appeal to Izvestiya, handed 
to 
Interfax, says that instead of initiating a direct dialogue 
between political opponents, Izvestiya was playing into the 
hands of politicians of the same bias, publishing articles 
discrediting the Liberal Democratic Party one after another. 
  The letter says that the Liberal Democratic Party leaders, 
"considered their duty to inform its electors of their attitude 
to Gaydar's dirty article through any other Russian newspaper 
which will not be afraid to give space to the party which won 
the election on December 12, 1993."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 27 TASS -- The Russian State Duma Snubbed 
President Boris Yeltsin on Friday by deciding to create its own 
TV and radio service. 
  On Thursday Presidential Spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov urged 
the lower chamber on behalf of the Russian President to refrain 
from such a decision, but the request was ignored. 
  The TV and radio service will employ 49 people and is to 
daily report on activities of legislative authorities. 
Representatives of various factions will have 30 minutes of 
daily air time. 
  The Duma thus followed suit of the former Russian 
legislature, the Supreme Soviet, which was dissolved by the 
President last September. It had also created its own TV 
service which appeared on central TV with the "parliamentary 
hour" programme. The broadcasts were intended to provide 
objective coverage of the work of the legislature which said 
that state-controlled media was biased about it.

  [Text] Russian presidential press-secretary Vyacheslav 
Kostikov criticized on behalf of Boris Yeltsin the steps taken 
by the State Duma for the creation of its own TV and Radio 
service with a compulsory system of daily broadcasting on state 
television channels. 
  In a statement released on Thursday the press secretary 
noted 
that "the president is concerned that the resumption of 
information dictate may lead to the fall of the State Duma's 
prestige, and this in turn would damage the process of 
strengthening civil accord." 
  The practice of infringement by the former Supreme Council 
on 
the prerogatives of a free media being reanimated in the new 
parliament has already been resolutely rejected by Russian 
public opinion, the statement says. 
  Kostikov pointed out that neither the president, nor the 
government, nor the Federation Council have their own 
broadcasting service. The State Duma's attempts to in essence 
create information privileges for itself can be described as an 
aspiration of one of the power branches to violate the division 
of powers already fixed in the Constitution, the statement 
points out. "The pernicious consequences of such tactics are 
well known." 
  "The president urges deputies of the State Duma to show 
wisdom, political tact, and to take into account lessons of 
history," Kostikov noted.

  [Text] The president's press service today issued a 
statement from Boris Yeltsin on the State Duma's decision to set 
up its own radio and television service. We asked Vyacheslav 
Kostikov, the president's press secretary, for the details. 
Here's what he told us by telephone. 
  [Begin Kostikov recording] Unfortunately, the point has to 
be 
made that the State Duma is taking steps to set up its own radio 
and television service, and, what is particularly annoying, with 
a compulsory system of daily broadcasting on the state 
television channels and primarily on the channels of Russia TV. 
So the new legislative body is, in effect, reviving the 
practice of the earlier Supreme Soviet's encroachments on the 
free airwaves. 
  Boris Nikolayevich had a serious conversation on the subject 
today. He is very concerned at these new tendencies in the work 
of the Duma. He thinks that the renewal of attempts at an 
information diktat may lead to a fall in the prestige of the 
State Duma. This worries him because the State Duma is one of 
the participants in the process of public accord, and the 
discrediting of that important state body will damage the 
strengthening of public accord in Russia. 
  Moreover, it must be borne in mind that neither the 
president 
nor the government nor the Federation Council has its own 
broadcasting. They interact with the public on the principles, 
universally adopted in world practice, of the free flow of 
information. The tactic of compulsorily reserving and grabbing 
its own radio and television time must be seen as an attempt by 
a state body to create information privileges for itself. That 
is, of course, impermissible. In the information field, all 
participants in a discussion -- sometimes there are several of 
them in a political struggle -- must nevertheless, in a 
democratic state, have equal opportunities, and the constitution 
must provide such opportunities. But that seems too little for 
the State Duma -- not the whole of the State Duma, of course, 
but some of it, some groups which think that they must have some 
special rights to the information space. 
  Politically, this can only be seen as the desire of one 
branch of power to violate the division of powers which has 
taken shape and is enshrined in the constitution. We have 
already experienced such a practice and know the ruinous 
consequences. They are well known. This tactic by the Supreme 
Soviet led, in part, to the October events. And it is extremely 
dangerous to public calm to return once more to those plans for 
forcibly foisting one's own viewpoints on to the public. 
  In this connection, by making his statement, the president 
is 
urging the deputies of the State Duma to display wisdom that is 
characteristic of many groups and many deputies, and political 
tact, and, above all, to take account of the lessons of very 
recent history. 
  The statement must certainly not be seen as some kind of 
confrontation. It is a calm warning from the president to 
deputies, so that they should not make mistakes that will 
rebound on them, above all. I think that deputies must be 
concerned about their own image if they want the State Duma to 
be a popular body among the people.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "Around the Clock Non-Stop" </F>
column: "Duma Now Has Lobby"] 
  [Text] Yesterday a meeting of heads of the capital and 
regional television and radio companies voted unanimously for 
the creation of an Association of Television and Radio Workers. 
The founder is the Journalists Union of Russia. 
  The reason for the gathering at Journalist House was the 
drafting of a law on television and radio that parliament has 
been poring over with enviable persistence for several days now. 
After all, the future of a favorite plaything is being decided. 
And those working for television and radio do not want to be a 
plaything. 
  The main objective is to lobby Duma decrees: The future law 
should only be passed if the association consents. It also 
intends to work out principles for the development of the 
television and radio market, and to oppose the Communications 
Ministry's monopoly. The association will keep an eye on the 
registration and re-registration of television and radio 
companies. 
  The association will bring together representatives of 
rather 
varied interests: state-employed broadcasters and commercial 
and independent producers. However, when it came to nominating 
the association's chairman, the only candidate named was Lysenko 
who represents state interests. The heads of regional 
television and radio companies nominated their own candidates -- 
Kurkova and Shevelev. There was no time left to vote on any of 
the candidates. Therefore they allowed Lysenko, who heads the 
organizing committee, to be chairman ad interim. Having done 
that, the gathering decided to break up until fall. Half the 
participants were in a hurry to join a banquet in the adjoining 
room.

    [Editorial Report] Moscow Radio Rossii Network in Russian 
at 1000 GMT on 26 May broadcasts a 4.5-minute report that radio 
and television companies across Russia are going to set up a 
league as a measure against the law on mass media which is about 
to be adopted by the State Duma. The announcer says that the 
proposed law stipulates the creation of the state Duma's 
exclusive TV and radio service, which, the announcer says, will 
be financed from the federal budget, thus reducing the amount of 
financial support presently allocated to other state media. 
  Anatoliy Batyushkin, head of the department of radio and 
television at the Ministry of Communications, is asked by a 
Radio Rossii correspondent about the present financial situation 
in the broadcasting industry. He says: 
  "At present we owe the power engineers about 50 billion 
rubles [R] for the electrical energy already supplied to TV 
centers. The TV and radio broadcasting companies' debt for the 
first quarter stands at R192 billion. Until now only R100 
billion have been repaid. Only R25 billion has been used to pay 
salaries, buy spare parts, etc, while in fact, the power 
engineers need at least R50 billion for the first quarter year." 
  Asked whether broadcasting will go back to normal in the 
near 
future, Batyushkin says: 
  "I think that we will be able to work well if the federal 
television and radio broadcasting service does in fact achieve 
stable financing. If we are paid, no conflict situation, 
nothing will interfere with nonstop broadcasting, just as it 
used to be when we had a system when a single minute of unused 
time at some or other transmitter was considered to be an 
emergency situation." 
  In response to that comment, Radio Rossii correspondent 
Aleksandr Kurekov says: 
  "First of all, a few words from a note on technical 
stoppages 
of transmitters broadcasting Radio Rossii programs. From 24 
May, because of lack of energy supplies, transmitters in Taldym, 
near Moscow, Blagoveshchensk in Amur oblast, and in Chita are 
inoperative. These transmitters used to provide one of the most 
stable feeds of radio programs on longwave." Kurekov adds that 
people in these areas can no longer hear the 650 or so reports 
from localities provided by Radio Rossii's correspondents, or 
the 200-300 reports filed by them from near-abroad and other 
countries. He also said that Kaluga, Smolensk, Tver, and 
Voronezh oblasts have been left without Radio Rossii's programs 
as well.

of decrees aiming to speed economic reforms, Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin is now preparing another series of decrees to 
regulate the sphere of production, according to Sergey Filatov, 
chief of the presidential staff. 
  Addressing participants in a regular ceremony of signing the 
treaty of social accord in the Grand Kremlin Palace, Filatov 
said the package of decress now under preparation is above all 
aims to improve efficiency of tax offices. "The poor performance 
of tax services results in such losses that their reducing by 
20-30 per cent would enable to cover the entire federal budget 
deficit", he noted. 
  The chief of the presidential staff listed priorities to be 
addressed by the said decrees. They include cutbacks in state 
subsidies and preferential support of enterprises, protection of 
private ownership, encouragement of private and foreign 
investments. 
  The president also intends to issue an order on division 
between the economic and social activities of enterprises with a 
view to put an end to what head of the group of experts under 
the Russian president, Aleksandr Lifshits, described as "factory 
socialism". 
  Some measures are also expected to be taken for equitable 
distribution of reform burden among all sections of the 
population. 
  Filatov stressed that time had come to pass from words about 
reform to the reform itself, which the old parliament failed to 
do, despite repeated and urgent appeals by President Yeltsin.

<F P=106> [Irina Savvateyeva report: "Government Concerned About </F>
Course of Reforms"] 
  [Text] The latest sitting of the government presidium was 
largely devoted to the future of economic reforms in Russia. 
  It examined a draft of the federal investment program for 
1994 was being examined, and introduced clarifications and 
additions in the government's plan of action in connection with 
the implementation of the first phase of the "Development of 
Reforms and Stabilization of the Russian Economy" program. 
Apart from that, it examined the draft Russian Federation Law 
"On the Emergency Rescue Service and the Status of Rescuers." 
  The "Development of Reforms and Stabilization of the Russian 
Economy" program was adopted in November of last year, and 
covered the period from late 1993 through 1994. Today it has 
been partially implemented, and it has become partially 
obsolete. That is why the Ministry of the Economy, represented 
by First Deputy Minister Yakov Urinson, proposed that certain 
clarifications and additions be introduced. 
  First of all, it is proposed to change the procedure for the 
adoption of decisions. Whereas last year's version proposed 
proceeding on the basis of presidential edicts, which were to be 
subsequently ratified by laws, now the elaborators of the 
program will be aiming for the adoption of full legislative acts 
straight away. 
  As for the content side, the following additions were made. 
The section on the reform of state enterprises, elaborated on 
the basis of recent presidential edicts, is being included in 
its entirety in the program. Measures to carry out structural 
policy are being outlined. A list of hopeless production 
capacities liable to closure is being drawn up. 
  The investment section will tackle in particular the 
procedure for the implementation of federal targeted programs, 
as well as a reduction in their number. Apart from that, a 
methodology for selecting projects for financing is being 
proposed. 
  A federal program for exports and a government decree on the 
basic guidelines of energy policy will also be ratified within 
the framework of the program for the development of reforms.

  [Text] Moscow May 26 TASS -- First Vice-Premier Oleg 
Soskovets opened a regular session of the Russian Government 
today, criticising Russian ministers for inadequate activities 
in bringing home to the people the importance of Russian 
president's decrees on boosting economic reform. Soskovets 
described the government' activities in this field as "obviously 
insufficient." 
  A package of documents on the reform of state-run 
enterprises, strengthening taxation policies, streamlining 
payments and abolishing export quotas and licenses was prepared 
by the Russian Government and signed by the president on May 23. 
  "Despite an avalanche of comments on the latest presidential 
decrees, the Russian ministers's voice is almost inaudible," 
Soskovets said. "It is the cabinet which should be the first to 
analyse laws which the ministers will have to comply with, bring 
them home to the people and make their forecasts," Soskovets 
said. 
  On his initiative the government adopted a resolution to 
establish control over the implementation of the president's 
decrees on stepping up the economic reform. Under the 
resolution, heads of federal and regional executive bodies were 
instructed to hold conferences and seminars to discuss recent 
presidential decrees, inviting managers of enterprises to attend.

  [Text] Moscow May 26 TASS -- The results of a public 
opinion poll conducted by the "Mnenie" sociological service 
showed that every second respondent considers the financial 
status of his family to be not very good. A total of 17 per 
cent of respondents said they can hardly make both ends meet, 
while only three per cent are quite satisfied with their incomes 
and 27 per cent admitted that their incomes are relatively not 
bad. 
  The majority of these polled (65 per cent) said that five 
years ago they lived much better. A total of 22 per cent said 
that their incomes had grown, while 11 per cent believe that 
their incomes remained at about the same level. 
  Almost half of respondents (47 per cent) resolutely declined 
to make any forecasts about their future incomes. The number of 
optimists hoping that in five years their life will change for 
the better makes up about 27 per cent, with 6 per cent 
cherishing hopes of getting rich. However, 13 per cent cherish 
no such hopes and are preparing to tighten their belts. 
  Taking part in the poll were 3,535 respondents from 190 
Russian settlements located in 30 regions of the Russian 
Federation.

  [Text] Moscow May 26 TASS -- During its meeting on 
Thursday, the Russian Federal Government rejected the draft of 
the federal investment programme for 1994 which had been 
submitted by the Finance Ministry. The rejection was largely 
inspired by the draft's lack of a mechanism for creating an 
investment market in the country. The Finance Ministry has been 
given a week to resubmit an improved draft programme. 
  Investment in Russia continued to decline in 1993, due to 
the 
overall fall in production, high inflation rates, and the high 
risk level for private investors. Despite the government's 
efforts to stimulate investment by cancelling the tax on profits 
which are reinvested, offering subsidized credits, and 
reassessing basic assets, the rate of decline was only slowed 
somewhat. In 1993, the value of investments declined by 16 per 
cent, compared to 40 per cent in 1992, according to the report 
presented to the government today by First Deputy Finance 
Minister Yakov Urinson. 
  Urinson pointed out two priorities for the government 
investment policy. The first is the more effective use of 
investments provided by the state budget, with a transition away 
from credits "on demand" towards those given out only to the 
most promising enterprises after examining their business plans. 
  The second priority stresses the formation of a more 
attractive investment climate drawing on funds from enterprises 
themselves and private investors. 
  The Finance Ministry feels that the implementation of those 
measures will improve the investment climate already in 1994, 
and have its greatest effect in 1995. However, Urinson pointed 
out, overall investments from all sources into the country's 
economy have declined by 10 per cent in 1994. Government 
centralized investments have gone down by 40 per cent. The 
remaining funds will be directed towards easing the most serious 
problems. 
  The draft presented by the Finance Ministry included the 
suggestions of many ministries and departments. In particular, 
the state construction committee suggested that a point be added 
to the draft about opening special accounts for amortization 
deductions and advancing up to 30 per cent of the yearly limit 
to companies working on contract. The Russian Agricultural 
Ministry protested that the draft did not envisage the financing 
of branches of the agro-industrial complex from the federal 
budget, whose funds are handed out only for the support of the 
most important sectors of the economy.

  [Text] At its Thursday's session the Russian Government 
decided to organize control over the implementation of the 
package of economic decrees signed by President Yeltsin recently. 
  Addressing the session, First Deputy Premier Oleg Soskovets 
stressed that real life in Russia "overtakes the processes of 
law-making," and that the "package of presidential economic 
decrees" is designed to "resolve problems that piled up largely 
in the area of finances and material production skillfully and 
gradually." 
  According to Soskovets, the "essence and the content" of 
Boris Yeltsin's decrees connected with reforming state-owned 
enterprises, taxation policy, quotas and other issues "pursue 
only one goal -- to put the country's economy in order." 
  "Many provisions in the package of the president's decrees 
conflict with the present legislation, and some of them give 
rise to amazement," countered the chairman of Russia's Central 
Bank, Viktor Gerashchenko. He called for convening a special 
government session to analyse and discuss the decrees. 
  However Gerashchenko's call failed to find support, and 
participants in the government session approved the draft 
resolution which contains a system of concrete measures designed 
to monitor the implementation of presidential decrees.

  [Text] Moscow May 26 BUSINESS-TASS -- Chairman of the 
Russian Central Bank Viktor Gerashchenko refuted mass media 
reports that he opposed the package of economic decrees recently 
issued by President Boris Yeltsin. 
  Gerashchenko told BUSINESS-TASS that those documents had 
actually been prepared by specialists from the Central Bank, 
along with other departments. They were then only polished up 
by the president's staff. 
  "The aim of the published decrees is to raise contract 
discipline and achieve the honoring of responsibilities before 
each other and before the state", the chairman noted, adding 
that the decrees would be fully implemented by the Central Bank. 
  The only thing that might have given rise to the rumours of 
his opposition, said Gerashchenko, was his comment, made at a 
recent meeting of the government, that the system of final 
editing of decrees and documents could be improved. He said the 
government should avoid changing documents which have already 
been fully prepared, since that might lead to some 
misunderstandings.

  [Text] The Russian Central Bank plans to change its 
tactics of regulating the ruble's exchange rate against the 
dollar by carrying out hidden interventions through networks of 
authorized banks. At the same time, the Central Bank is going 
to reduce its presence at the Moscow Interbank Currency 
Exchange, Igor Knyazev, deputy chief of the bank's currency 
operations administration, said. This scheme is expected to be 
more efficient because authorized banks will benefit from 
putting their into circulation, which, in turn, will create a 
"cash flow."

<F P=106> [Lev Ambinder report: "News Conference of Russia's Armorers </F>
Union. Arms Producers Start Making Laws"] 
  [Excerpts] Russian small-arms exporters, seriously 
concerned at the threats of a number of European states to take 
measures in connection with the imminent 100-percent hike in 
July in customs duties on arms imports to Russia, are looking 
for a compromise. Oleg Kuzmenko, executive director of the Union 
of Russian Armorers, advised at the news conference that took 
place in Izhevsk yesterday that draft decrees are being prepared 
jointly with the State Committee on the Defense Industry and the 
government of Udmurtia, suggesting that these duties be brought 
into line with those of the rest of the world, and at the same 
time the price of licenses for trade in weapons be increased. 
[passage omitted] 
  Since the former legal norms regulating the purchasing, 
keeping, trade in and manufacture of sporting and hunting arms 
have been abolished, and new ones have not been put in place 
yet, the next draft law proposed by the armorers relates 
precisely to these matters. In particular, it sets the price of 
a license for trade in weapons at 400 minimal salaries, that of 
a buyer's license at 0.5 percent of the minimum salary, that of 
a license for keeping a weapon at 0.04 percent, and that of the 
license for the production of weapons at 0.1 percent of the 
minimum salary. 
  That puts some constraints on traders in imported weapons on 
the home market. Mr. Kuzmenko is confident that following the 
conference in Izhevsk chaired by Oleg Soskovets, first deputy 
prime minister of the Russian Government, who supported the 
armorers' proposals, they could be adopted by the Russian 
Government as early as this month. 
  KOMMERSANT-DAILY observers point out that the position of 
Russian armorers has been significantly determined by their 
success in March at the international fire-arms show at 
Nuremberg where some of the articles fetched preliminary orders 
for twice the quantities than the producers could supply. In 
this connection the alluring prospect of stepping up their arms 
export made the armorers speak against the introduction of high 
customs duties.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 26 TASS -- "The Army must not be 
subjected to any experiments. We must not save or make money on 
the defenders of our homeland," Air Major-General Nikolay 
Bezborodov, vice-chairman of the Duma Defence Committee, told 
ITAR-TASS today. He noted that trips of MPs to garrisons of the 
Far Eastern Military Area and to the Northern Fleet have 
confirmed that minimum funds, sufficient only for every-day 
needs, are being allocated to the military establishment. This 
calls in question the proper organisation of military training 
and the protection of Russia's interests and security. 
  The materials of the investigation, Bezborodov said, have 
been submitted to the Defence Council of the State Duma, to the 
government, and to the president of the Russian Federation. The 
committee is sure that it is necessary to radically revise the 
financing of the Armed Forces. The situation when servicemen 
and the civilian personnel are not paid their salaries for 2-3 
months running can by no means be regarded as normal. This 
creates a tense situation in some garrisons, where the families 
of servicemen live only on Army cash allowances. 
  Bezborodov said that the president's stand on the military 
budget was clear. He wants minimum funds to be allocated, which 
would keep the combat readiness of the Armed Forces at the 
needed level, would ensure the survival of the military science 
and purchases of the needed armaments. The president is sure 
that this is the duty of the state. 
  "The privileges accorded to servicemen should neither be 
expanded nor curtailed," the vice-chairman of the Duma Defence 
Committee stressed. Reports have appeared that the Russian 
Government was allegedly proposing to pay minimum compensation 
for the present food rations. Defence Ministry experts have 
made corresponding calculations, which showed that in this case 
all the servicemen would prefer to get food rations instead of 
money. This will be much more expensive to the state. "The 
committee will approach these problems most seriously," the 
general stated.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature by correspondents </F>
Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others] 
  [Text] Russia is in favor of reaching agreed-upon decisions 
on the major provisions of a treaty on banning nuclear tests as 
soon as possible (by next spring), the director of the Russian 
Foreign Ministry's press and information department, Grigoriy 
Karasin, said in connection with the talks resumed by the 
Disarmament Conference in Geneva. 
  Russia's Foreign Ministry views these talks as a major 
direction of its efforts in the current year, he stressed at 
Thursday's briefing. He pointed to Moscow's intention to 
"contribute to the endeavors to create favorable conditions for 
next year's conference on extending the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty." 
  As Karasin said, Moscow believes that a "treaty on banning 
nuclear tests should be timeless and have no ceilings; that it 
should provide for an effective system of control and for strict 
sanctions against its violators." 
  According to the diplomat, "Russia favors a realistic and 
evolutionary approach to developing the system of international 
control over the implementation of a treaty on banning nuclear 
tests, which would provide for using at its initial stage 
seismic methods, instruments for surveying radioactivity in the 
atmosphere, and on-site inspections." "Some countries have 
suggested a number of additional methods, but this may 
considerably increase expenses connected with control system and 
lead to delaying the drafting of the treaty," Karasin said.

important decisions. Our correspondent talks about the results 
of the session's work with Mechyslaw Hryb, chairman of the 
Belarusian Parliament. 
  [Gulyayev] The start of this year was marked by the 
aggravation of the situation in the republic. As a result the 
13th session of the Supreme Soviet dismissed its chairman, 
Stanislav Shushkevich, and elected you. Forecasts for the 
development of events at the time were very unreassuring. 
Various political forces demanded the dissolution of the 
Supreme Soviet as being unable to make the decisions the 
republic needed. But then suddenly the same Supreme Soviet 
adopted the republic's constitution and a whole series of very 
important documents. What happened? 
  [Hryb] What should have happened. The chairman of the 
Supreme Soviet, elected to the post through the will of the 
majority of deputies, set himself against that majority. In 
this situation there could be no systematic, consistent work. 
It is absolutely natural that the majority decided to relieve 
him of his post. 
  But after the replacement of the leadership we managed to 
set 
up normal, consistent work. As a result of which documents were 
adopted that were truly fateful for the republic -- primarily 
the Republic of Belarus Constitution. The state's system was 
defined as a presidential republic and we managed to single out 
the priority of citizens' rights over the state. 
  All this is extraordinarily important! Let's think about it: 
After the collapse of the former structures Belarus was left in 
fact without a power. The grassroots did not obey the upper 
echelons, the upper echelons paid no attention to the 
grassroots, mostly resolving their own problems. 
  But now that there is a new constitution and a law has been 
adopted on the presidential elections and their date has been 
set -- at any rate we can now see the path along which we must 
travel. We will elect the head of state and accept his oath and 
approve the makeup of the government.... That is the process of 
creating an effective power has begun. Without losing control 
of the country. 
  [Gulyayev] Mechyslaw Ivanovich, can one say today that 
understanding has finally been reached between the branches of 
power? After all no effectiveness will be achieved otherwise.... 
  [Hryb] I think I can boldly assert that there has been 
consolidation. The main thing is that we have common ideas of 
the paths for Belarus' development and a common orientation 
toward the East. Moreover, the Supreme Soviet has given the 
government the powers it has always sought. 
  Moreover, the Supreme Soviet intends to render real aid to 
the government in resolving the most diverse questions. For 
instance, there was an opinion that the parliamentarians should 
not be involved with the economy. We broke with that tradition 
and recently adopted a presidium decree on backing up the sowing 
campaign. Perhaps this decree has not worked completely but our 
peasants were provided with fuel and seeds this year.... And 
virtually all apart from mineral fertilizers were supplied in 
the necessary quantity. 
  The presidium has now examined the question of housing 
cooperative construction. The construction workers do not have 
the funds to finish what they have begun, nor do people have the 
funds to pay for what has been constructed. But we have found 
ways of resolving this problem. 
  That is the situation is as follows: We are trying to 
address the problem, not to avoid it. At a time when the former 
Supreme Soviet leadership was saying: The economy is not our 
business. But after all, people do not care who helps them live 
better -- it is just important to help! And in that sense we 
are cooperating and are prepared to continue to cooperate with 
the executive power. But of course as long as the government 
does not avoid its powers or exceed them.... 
  [Gulyayev] You said you are united with the government in 
your orientation toward the East. Here you cannot avoid the 
popular question of the ruble zone.... 
  [Hryb] In principle I approve this agreement, only I propose 
changing the formulation of some articles. Including the fifth 
and eights -- changing them so that it is not necessary to make 
changes to our constitution which has only just been born. The 
Supreme Soviet may not make such changes and there is no need 
for it. I talked with Boris Yeltsin and Viktor Chernomyrdin at 
the conference of heads of state. They agree that it is 
possible to elaborate a text acceptable to both sides. 
  But as a whole, I repeat, I approve and support this very 
good and in my view sensible step which apart from anything else 
should help to stabilize the situation in the republic. 
  [Gulyayev] But today it is also influenced by the election 
campaign.... 
  [Hryb] Yes, 19 initiative groups from 19 contenders have 
already been registered. I do not know whether many of them 
will collect the necessary number of votes to register as a 
candidate. But I think that we will get into the Guinness Book 
of Records for the number of contenders for the top state post. 
  And a serious struggle is already under way. Among the 
candidates there will probably be people who will not use the 
most civilized methods. At any rate attempts to set one 
category of the population on another already exist. And the 
situation could undoubtedly be aggravated. Although in our view 
there are no prerequisites for events to assume an 
uncontrollable nature. 
  In conclusion allow me to wish your readers the very best. 
May those who have not yet completed it carry out the sowing 
campaign successfully. So that later there is something to 
harvest from the fields -- in Belarus and in Russia, wherever 
the farmer puts seed into the ground. And, most important, I 
wish you stability in your life! So that the peasant can 
finally do his noble job in peace.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich has substantially 
left behind his contenders in the presidential marathon. 
  According to preliminary data of the Central election 
committee as of Thursday morning (the information was received 
after the verification of the ballot papers with the signatures 
of the republic's citizens in support of this or that candidate 
to the presidency in the regional and city electoral commissions 
and annulment of signatures recognized invalid), it appeared 
that about 364,000 citizens of the republic have nominated 
Vyacheslav Kebich. (The minimum number needed for the contenders 
to be registered in the Central election committee as an 
official candidate to the presidency is 100,000 - Interfax). 
  In addition, the constitutional majority of the parliament, 
236 people's deputies under the necessary minimum equal to 70 
votes, are in favor of Kebich's promotion. 
  Leader of the opposition Belarussian Popular Front Zenon 
Poznyak occupies the second place. His initiative group has 
collected as many as 215,000 signatures. 
  Vasiliy Novikov, who was nominated by the Party of Belarus' 
communists, is on the third place with 180,000 signatures. 
Leader of the former parliamentary commission to combat 
corruption Aleksandr Lukashenko who has managed to collect 
152,000 signatures follows Novikov. 
  Ex-speaker of the Supreme Soviet Stanislav Shushkevich 
occupies the fifth place in the list of contenders (as many as 
122,000 signatures). Representative of the Agrarian party 
Aleksandr Dubko is not far behind (113,000 signatures). 
  The team of the chairman of the Party of Popular Accord 
Gennadiy Karpenko handed over 109,000 signatures to the 
electoral commissions. However, after invalid ballot papers 
were annulled there remained only 86,000 votes; that's why he 
has no juridical right to continue the struggle for presidency. 
Karpenko's hopes to become the parliamentarians' nominee failed 
as well. Though he managed to collect signatures of 78 
deputies, on Wednesday as many as 11 of them, predominantly 
representatives of the Social Democratic party, unexpectedly 
recalled their signatures. IF Note: During his conversation 
with our Interfax correspondent leader of the Belarussian 
social-democrats Oleg Trusov who heads the initiative group of 
the ex-speaker explained this behavior of his single minded 
deputies by the revenge for the "gentlemen agreement" between 
the candidates representing the right-wing forces not to 
interfere with signatures collection which was allegedly 
violated by Karpenko. In Trusov's words, Karpenko managed "to 
appropriate" several thousands of signatures collected in 
support of Shushkevich. 
  Belarus' Central Elections Commission reported to Interfax 
that the final results of signatures' collection for the 
promotion of the candidates to the presidency would become 
public in the evening of May 27.

<F P=106> [Interview with Belarusian Servicemen Association Chairman </F>
Mikalay Statkevich, head of the public control commission for 
presidential elections, by Taststsyana Lazowskaya; place and 
date not given: "Job or Kebich?"] 
  [Text] Our paper has already reported that, at the 
initiative of the Belarusian Servicemen Association [BZV], a 
public control commission for the presidential elections was 
established. BZV Chairman Mikalay Statkevich who heads this 
commission has outlined its goals. 
  [Statkevich] I would like to note that BZV is not a 
political organization, nor does it fight for power. This is 
what determines our stance on the presidential elections. We 
support all candidates who stand for democratic and patriotic 
positions, and we have given our members the opportunity to 
independently support this or that candidate. Perhaps the BZV 
leadership has assumed a wrong stance. But we could not stand 
aside during the elections, since the fate of our country -- 
which, as we believe, is controlled by the Mafia -- depends on 
the election returns, which are the last chance to eradicate 
this evil in a peaceful way. Knowing unpopularity of the ruling 
circles' main candidate for the presidential office -- Mr. 
Kebich [Belarusian prime minister] -- as well as of possible 
violations of the law and fraud during the elections, BZV came 
up with the initiative to establish a public control commission. 
The initiative was supported by 14 organizations, who had 
nominated seven candidates for the presidential office. Some of 
them, as the saying goes, have already dropped out of the race. 
Nevertheless, these organizations have confirmed their 
membership in the commission, whose main goal is to ensure 
honest elections. 
  [Lazowskaya] Mikalay Viktaravich, the commission has 
already been operating for quite a while. Obviously, its 
members have already learned about certain violations of the law. 
  [Statkevich] We have been receiving a great many reports 
about them. The lion's share of them concerns one of the 
candidates -- Mr. Kebich. 
  [Lazowskaya] Apparently, there is no point in listing 
every case of fraud. Nevertheless, could you outline the 
methods used. 
  [Statkevich] First of all, this concerns using state 
administration bodies to collect signatures, including abuse of 
office and moral pressure on state organizations' workers. The 
commission members know of cases where pensioners were not paid 
their pensions, kolkhoz workers -- their wages, and that workers 
and clerks were threatened with layoffs should they refuse to 
sign the petitions for Kebich. 
  In Zhlobin, for instance, the following case took place: A 
teacher joined [former Supreme Council Chairman] Stanislaw 
Shushkevich's team at his own initiative. However, he learned 
later that his name was included in the list of signatures 
collected by the prime minister's initiative group. Thus, the 
law was violated. 
  I can also say a few words about the situation in the Army. 
Only representatives of the Council of Ministers chairman's 
team have the right to canvass and collect signatures among 
servicemen. Activists from Comrade Novikaw's [Communist Party 
leader] team also obtained the right to do so, but a little bit 
later. Yet, despite their commanders' orders, soldiers do not 
always sign the petitions for the aforementioned people. It so 
happened that a commander himself is collecting military 
identification cards from his subordinates and placing the 
signatures in support of a candidate. 
  [Lazowskaya] The electoral battle continues. In my 
opinion, new facts of violating the law are still to appear. Is 
the public control commission predicting them? What measures 
are being taken to prevent them? 
  [Statkevich] According to our sources, the most widespread 
instance of fraud will be the practice of oblast commissions' 
not registering voting ballots. Local commissions' attempts to 
fill out ballots in pencil may become another kind of violation, 
all the more so since the law does not say anything about it. 
  Additionally, in rural areas, there is a widespread practice 
of dropping ballots into boxes delivered directly to houses, 
which gives to people the opportunity to plant extra ballots. 
  During a meeting between a delegation of the public control 
commission and the Central Electoral Commission Chairman 
Abramovich, we shared our concerns in this regard. Alyaksandr 
Mikhaylavich [Abramovich] assured our representatives that there 
will be lists of people who want to vote at home. I would like 
to point out that our observers will monitor this. 
  Mr. Abramovich also stated that accountability is envisioned 
for forging ballots. If the Central Electoral Commission learns 
of such incidents, the case will be handed over to an attorney's 
office. 
  I would like to add that BZV will carefully monitor the 
election results. Those electoral commission chairmen who 
commit any violations, hoping that the victory of their favorite 
candidate will wipe everything out, will be punished in the most 
severe manner.

<F P=106> [Report attributed to BELINFORM: "Government Critically </F>
Assesses Activities of the Finance Ministry"] 
  [Text] If the Finance Ministry continues to operate this 
way, we will not cope with financial problems. This is how this 
ministry was assessed at a meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers 
Presidium, chaired by Belarusian Prime Minister Mikail 
Myasnikovich, during a report on the implementation of the 
Belarusian state budget for 1993. 
  Among others, it was stressed that the Finance Ministry 
poorly handles credits given as part of bilateral relations. 
Those credits are misapplied, preventing the deficit of the 
payment balance from being eliminated. State securities have 
not been issued yet. Debts of other countries have also become 
a serious problem, exceeding the amount of 200 billion rubles. 
Only the debt of Uzbekistan to Belarus has been properly 
handled. Insufficient interaction between the Finance Ministry, 
the National Bank, and the National Committee for Statistics and 
Analysis weakens the "hare." Supreme Soviet Deputy Chairman 
Ivan Bambiza sharply criticized the ministry for its tax 
policies. 
  It was said at the meeting that the economy and the budget 
exist in isolation from each other. This is why a decision was 
made to reexamine activities of the Finance Ministry on the 
above issues. 
  The government's Presidium approved a temporary statute on 
use of economic sanctions for economic entities. It also 
decided to open new diplomatic representative offices abroad and 
transform plenipotentiary representative offices of the Cabinet 
of Ministers into embassies of the Belarusian Republic.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Presidium of the Belarusian </F>
Trade Union Federation Holds Its Session"] 
  [Text] The Presidium of the Belarusian Trade Union 
Federation [FPB] held a session on 26 May at its headquarters. 
BELAPAN has learned that two key issues -- a summer treatment 
program for working people and their children and an increase in 
the minimum wage -- were discussed. In particular, it was 
stated that the government allocated 120 billion rubles [R] to 
treat those who suffered from the Chernobyl tragedy's aftermath. 
However, this money will cover treatment for only 15 percent of 
all those who actually need it. The Gomel Oblast Trade Union 
Council sent an open letter to Belarusian Prime Minister 
Vyachaslaw Kebich presenting the statistics regarding Gomel 
Oblast residents who badly need this treatment. 
  The participants in the FPB session also raised the issue of 
increasing the minimum wage. According to the trilateral 
general agreement -- signed by the government, trade unions, and 
the Association of Employers -- the divergencies between indexes 
of a minimum consumer budget and a minimum wage should not 
exceed 27 percent. According to FPB experts's estimates, the 
minimum consumer budget (in June 1994 prices) will stand at 
R160,000 (currently, it is R60,000). 
  All these issues will be raised at the session of the 
Conciliatory Council of the Republic of Belarus, which includes 
representatives from the government, the FPB, and the 
Association of Employers.

<F P=106> [Alexandru Beleavschi dispatch from Chisinau] </F>
  [Text] Today the president of the Republic of Moldova, 
Mircea Snegur, received Romania's ambassador to Chisinau, Marian 
Enache, upon the latter's request. 
  Following their talks, Mr. Enache made the following brief 
statement: 
  [Begin Enache recording] In my assessment, the talks I held 
with President Mircea Snegur were substantial and positive. We 
approached, in a constructive spirit, the relations, on the 
whole, between Romania and the Republic of Moldova. 
  Basically, we expressed our readiness, and even more, I 
would 
say the necessity to genuinely revive the ties between our 
states, to amplify our contacts and the furthering, on all 
planes, of our sincere opinions regarding our bilateral ties, as 
well as the finalization of a number of concrete economic 
actions of mutual interest. 
  We also emphasized the need to maintain a continuous 
dialogue 
between the state power institutions of the two countries. 
Concretely speaking, a new conference is to take place soon in 
Galati regarding the traffic of passengers over the border 
crossing points on the Prut River, intended to better satisfy 
the needs of our economic companies and our citizens. 
Similarly, there is a possibility to organize, under good 
circumstances, a conference of the inter-ministerial committees 
in Chisinau, with the support of the leadership of the Republic 
of Moldova. 
  Similarly, significant political contacts are being 
anticipated at top level, at government level, besides other 
working meetings. 
  During our talks President Mircea Snegur expressed the 
sincere wish of the leadership of the Republic of Moldova to 
further relations with Romania, thus contradicting certain 
opinions according to which a certain coolness could be 
perceived lately in the relations between our countries. 
  Personally, I remain optimistic with respect to the 
rapprochement and the cooperation between our two states, as it 
is quite obvious that the things that unite us are stronger than 
certain more or less aleatoric circumstances. [end Enache 
recording]

  [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] May 26 TASS--Leaders of the 
Dniestr [Dniester] region regarded as slander the statements 
made by commander of the 14th Russian Army Aleksandr Lebed who 
accused Tiraspol leaders of illegal possession of weapons and 
asked the Russian leadership to deprive them of Russian 
citizenship which they were abusing. 
  According to Vladimir Ivanov, aid to the president of the 
Dniestr Republic, Tiraspol leaders really have firearms in 
personal possession but he stressed that these weapons were 
handed to them in a legal way. He also confirmed that some 
Dniestr leaders were granted Russian citizenship but denied the 
statements of the command of the 14th Army accusing them of 
abusing this citizenship for illegal trade in weapons. 
  A spokesman for the Interior Ministry of Moldavia [Moldova] 
told ITAR-TASS that the police also had information about 
misappropriation, illegal possession and re-sale of weapons by 
Tiraspol leaders and mafioso structures in the Dniestr Republic 
patronized by them.

  [Text] An acute shortage of cash and a big backlog of 
salaries, pensions, benefits, and allowances are forcing the 
Dniester leaders to turn to the Russian Federation Court of 
Arbitration. The ruling it adopted back on 18 January 1993 
found in favor of the action brought by the Dniester Regional 
Bank against the Moscow Goznak printing factory. The latter was 
requested to carry out its obligation to ship the Dniester money 
coupons manufactured by it in accordance with a paid order. 
  The introduction of Dniester money coupons is regarded as a 
temporary and purely economic measure helping to stabilize the 
position with cash until a general agreement with Moldova has 
been reached, Grigoriy Marakutsa, chairman of the Supreme Soviet 
of the unrecognized Dniester Moldovan Republic, explained to a 
NEGA correspondent. Its implementation, however, has been 
stopped by Russia -- not without some pressure from Chisinau 
officials, informed sources say. 
  The 24 May session of the Supreme Soviet of the Dniester 
Moldovan Republic that discussed the debts problem adopted an 
appeal to the Russian president, the Federation Council, and the 
State Duma with a request to positively resolve the question 
decided long ago by the Russian Federation Court of Arbitration.

currently stored at the Gosznak plant in Moscow. Previously, 
some Russian organs blocked their shipment to Tiraspol. This 
decision was later annulled by the Russian Arbitration Court at 
the Dniester official's request. According to Akulov, there is 
the shipment of banknotes to Tiraspol. A delegation comprising 
Dniester deputies and public organization representatives has 
been organized and will leave tomorrow for Moscow to conduct 
negotiations on shipping the banknotes as soon as possible.

border between Armenia and Azerbaijan. 
  The situation at the NKR front line was relatively peaceful 
last night and this morning. The two sides complied with the 
cease-fire agreement. We also wish to stress that an incident 
has not taken place at the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan 
during the past day. 
  We wish to explain in detail the incident that took place 
the 
night before last. It has been ascertained that some 200 enemy 
troops, supported by infantry combat vehicles, attacked the 
Armenian defense positions in the vicinity of Karakhanbeyli in 
Fizulinskiy Rayon on that night. The Armenian positions were 
intensely pounded with artillery guns. Violent clashes took 
place. The Armenian side checked the enemy's advance and 
inflicted casualties on the Azerbaijani units. Thirteen enemy 
troops [words indistinct]. The Armenian side did not have 
casualties. 
  Meanwhile, the Azerbaijani units shelled the Armenian 
positions in the other parts of the front line with artillery 
guns. The Armenian positions in Gyullyudzha and Shiravad in 
Agdamskiy Rayon and [place name indistinct], Esenkaya, and 
Tavush in Mardakertskiy Rayon were fired on. No one was hurt in 
the firing. [passage indistinct] 
  The NKR intelligence units have reported that some 400 new

  [Text] Stepanakert ("AZG", "YERKIR" dailies), 05/26/94 -- 
The situation at the Karabakh fronts aggravated again after a 
few days of relative calmness. 
  According to the RMK [Republic of Mountainous Karabakh] 
defense army headquarters, two Azeri infantry units with about 
250 soldiers supported by an armored personnel carrier, 
commenced an offensive from the Beylagan district in the 
direction of the Karabakh defense positions at the village of 
Karakhanbeyli in the Fizulinskiy district at 3 a.m. in the night 
of May 25. The attack was accompanied by fierce artillery 
shelling of the Armenian positions. 
  As a result of fierce battles, the Karabakh forces stopped 
the offensive, causing significant manpower losses to the enemy. 
13 Azeri soldiers have been killed during the battle, which 
lasted two hours. The Armenian side suffered no casualties. 
  The enemy shelled the Karabakh positions at the other 
sections of the front but refrained from active military 
operations. Particularly, the Azeris shelled the Armenian 
positions at the villages of Gyullija and Shourabad in the 
Agdamskiy district, Seisulan, Gasangaya and Talysh in the 
Mardakertskiy district. No casualties are reported. 
  According to a representative of the RMK defense army Serzh 
Arushanyan, this actions of the enemy proved once again that 
Azerbaijan is using short cease-fires for completing its army 
and preparing new offensives. 
  According to the RMK military reconnaissance, some 400 new 
recruits have been recently delivered to the Agdamskiy district 
from Baku. Arushanyan said, Azerbaijan faces difficulties in 
completing its army, as 80 percent of the new recruits are 17-18 
year old youngsters.

  [Excerpts] Today's session of the Armenian Supreme Council 
chaired by Ara Sahakyan, first deputy chairman of the Supreme 
Council, examined the forestry code. Baykar Ashotyan, a 
professor at the Botanical Institute of the Armenian Academy of 
Sciences, delivered a report on the scientific principles of the 
code. He noted that the forestry code aims at regulating the 
legal and economic relations arising during the exploitation of 
the forests and at actively contributing to the scientifically 
grounded exploitation, rehabilitation, and protection of the 
forests by taking into consideration their ecological and 
economic importance. 
  In fulfillment of the decisions of the Armenian Supreme 
Council and Government on measures to organize and implement the 
spring agricultural work in 1994, the parliament heard a report 
from Armenian Agriculture Minister Ashot Voskanyan on the 
progress of spring sowing. [passage omitted] 
  Next, the Supreme Council took up the discussion of the 
issues under debate during its three-day session. On second 
reading, the parliament adopted bills on the protection of the 
atmosphere, on the protection and dissemination of cultural 
wealth, and on refugees. 
  The parliament also adopted a number of important economic 
bills. Particularly important were the bills on income tax and 
tax exemptions for (?certain) enterprises. [passage omitted] 
  The Supreme Council adopted at first reading a bill on the 
legal status of the foreign citizens in Armenia and the code on 
forestry. 
  Next it ratified the agreement on the movement of the 
citizens of Armenia and Georgia through their territories 
without a visa, and then the international convention on banning 
the development, production, stockpiling, and use of chemical 
weapons, and on the destruction of chemical weapons. 
  The Supreme Council ended its three-day session after 
adopting more than 20 bills.

  [Text] Yerevan, 26 May (SNARK)--Armenian Internal Affairs 
Minister Vano Siradegyan, appearing by a TV, called criminal the 
Trade Minister Tigran Grigoryan. "The May 10 arrest of trade 
minister, while he took a 2,500-dollar bribe, was carried out 
smartly", told Siradegyan. 
  As already reported, two days after his detention the trade 
minister was released, because no prosecutor sanction was 
submitted during his arrest. He took up his office again. 
  From a TV screen, Vano Siradegyan announced: "All officials 
with whom I have talked accepted that trade minister is a thief 
and bribe-taker, however they required proof, being doubtful 
about the sum as low as 2,500 dollars. But it's a teacher's 
salary for 50 years", exclaimed Siradegyan. He promised to 
arrest next time the state minister red handed--instead of a 
minister--and present the proper videotape.

  [Text] Baku (May 25) TURAN--The pressure on the opposition 
after May 21 when President Aliyev addressed refugees grows. 
The opposition leaders were arrested and detained. 
  For two days, official newspapers have been publishing 
appeals by President Aliyev to Azeri citizens. The citizens of 
the Republic in their letters demand "to bring the country in to 
order and severely punish the culprits". On May 24, AZERBAIJAN 
newspaper published a letter from 960 Lachin refugees. The 
letter reads that "the dregs of the PFA [Azerbaijani People's 
Front] do not allow us to restore peace to the region. The 
earlier you stifle them the better. You must take drastic 
measures against them. We are ready to come to Baku and to hang 
them from the central square. Dear President Aliyev, we ask you 
not to prevent us from hanging the traitors and enemies of the 
nation. It will be the most just trial of the 20th century". 
  A meeting of labourers of the Agdzhabedinskiy region adopted 
a resolution which was read out on the Baku's first television 
channel on May 24. The resolution put forward the following: 
To ban the activity of all newspapers and media except state 
ones, the activity of all political parties, to make the 17 
deputies, who on May 18 left Parliament session in a token of 
protest against the position of the speaker, answer for their 
activities. Unofficial sources report that it was the 
Presidential staff who ordered the citizens of the regions of 
the republic to send telegrammes to President Aliyev with a 
request to bring the country to order. 
  The press centre of the Musavat party says that a battalion 
of soldiers from the Geranboynskiy region will be sent on May 
28, the Day of Independence, to Baku to take the control over 
the situation. 
  Arrests of opposition supporters, the ban on activity of the 
opposition and independent media and beating of deputies are not 
accidental. On May 12 President Aliyev held a meeting at which 
the resolution concerning harrasment of the opposition was 
adopted. The end of this campaign will be dissolving of 
Parliament, introduction of s [as received] Presidential 
government, dissolving of parties and so on. 
  Many observers believe that the campaign has already begun.

  [Text] Thursday morning a group of Russian officers led by 
the Deputy Commander of Russia's ground troops, Lt.-General 
Aleksandr Sokolov, flew to Abkhazia to define the points where 
peacekeeping forces will be deployed. INTERFAX learned this 
from military sources in Moscow. 
  Sokolov is in charge of deploying disengagement forces in 
the 
Abkhaz conflict area. Abkhazia's Defence Minister, Sultan 
Sosnaliev, who had taken part in the talks on a mechanism and 
localities of deploying peacekeepers along with his Georgian 
counterpart, Varden Nadibaidze, in Moscow, was on the same plane. 
  As INTERFAX learned earlier from a participant in the talks, 
the CIS peace-keeping forces, predominantly Russian, are to be 
stationed in the Abkhaz conflict area between the 10th and the 
15th of June. Under agreements reached on May 14th they'll be 
stationed in the "safety area" to be established on the River 
Inguri when the Georgian and Abkhaz troops are withdrawn 12 
kilometers away from the river. The disengagement forces are to 
number 2500 to 3000 men.

  [Text] [No dateline as received] -- For the past two days 
Abkhaz separatists have been conducting intense artillery 
shelling of the environs of the village of Ajara, along with 
carrying out provocative sorties against Georgian people's 
voluntary corps, thus violating the Moscow cease-fire agreement. 
Gudauta militants carry out armed raids on peaceful villages of 
the area, later accusing the Georgian side in order to gain over 
public opinion. 
  Yesterday [25 May], Abkhazian mercenaries units attempted to 
attack Georgian positions. Georgian Armed Forces units and the 
local population, who until then had refrained from any 
retaliatory actions, had to open fire. The opposite side 
retreated suffering casualties. Six attackers were killed and 
two taken prisoner. 
  Embittered by this failure, Abkhaz separatists dropped four 
bombs on the village of Ajara yesterday at one p.m.; luckily, 
there were no casualties.

  [Text] Tbilisi, 26th [dateline as received] -- Boris 
Kakubava, an MP and chairman of the Abkhazian Liberation Union, 
has made a speech at a rally held by opposition parties in front 
of the Tbilisi Cinema House today. He said that the 
parliamentary minority fails to oppose a policy conducted by the 
Georgian head of state. He referred to the parliamentary 
majority as a society of deaf- mutes. 
  In Boris Kakubava's opinion, Georgia will not be able to get 
back its lost territories while Eduard Shevardnadze is the head 
of state. He has demanded that Eduard Shevardnadze resign 
voluntarily. 
  According to Boris Kakubava, the Union of Georgia's Citizens 
is trying to mislead and deceive the Georgian people. The 
Georgian authorities have used 26 May, Georgia's Independence 
Day, to demonstrate the strength of Russian troops in Georgia. 
  In Boris Kakubava's words: "We will not allow anyone to 
overthrow the present authorities by force. If we are together, 
we will survive. If we stay apart, we will be destroyed one by 
one."

<F P=106> [IPRINDA press agency report under rubric "According to </F>
Reports From Correspondents and Information Agencies": 
"Statement by the Political Council"] 
  [Text] On 17 May, the Georgian Social-Democratic Party 
(GSDP) Political Council disseminated an appeal to the 
republic's population in which an analysis is given of the 
complex sociopolitical situation. Proceeding from this, the 
GSDP Political Council believes: The head of the Georgian state 
should resign and, at the same time, a national salvation 
committee that will be able to implement laws should be formed. 
Otherwise, considers the Political Council, it will be 
impossible to speak about the territorial integrity of Georgia, 
its independence, and the physical salvation of the Georgian 
nation.

  [Text] Tbilisi May 26 TASS -- Georgian leader Eduard 
Shevardnadze said: "Since Georgia normalised relations with 
Russia, and President Boris Yeltsin and myself announced to the 
world that our countries are friends and good neighbours, it has 
become possible to build the republic's strong armed forces as 
guarantors of Georgia's independence and territorial integrity." 
  The statement, made at the close of the military parade in 
Tbilisi's Central Square to mark independence day, was born out 
by the march-past of infantry, naval and paratrooper units 
sporting new uniforms and armed with the latest Kalashnikov 
automatic guns, the roll-past of armoured vehicles, artillery 
guns and anti-aircraft missiles. A squad of the Su-25 attack 
planes assembled at the Tbilisi plant performed aerobatics in 
the sky above the Central Square during the parade.

<F P=106> [Sergey Taranov report: "Georgian Trade Mission Counts on </F>
Russia"] 
  [Text] For the first time in history, Georgia has opened a 
trade and economic mission in Russia. It is located at No. 42, 
The Arbat. 
  Leonardo Devdariani, the 47-year old Georgian trade 
representative, says that he was offered the post of head of 
trade mission in any country, but he believes that "no other 
state in the world can do what Russia can do for Georgia both 
from the positive and the negative point of view." And Georgia 
has something to offer Russia. Russia may count on the use of 
maritime ports, the railroad (virtually the only one in the 
entire Transcaucasus region), air transportation, and resorts. 
In Georgia there is an abundance of raw materials which are 
scarce in Russia -- manganese, marble, metal arsenic, and 
ferroalloys. There is the output of the Rustavi metallurgical 
plant, and citrus fruit and tea grow in Georgia.... 
  A free trade regime has now been declared between the 
countries -- there are virtually no customs or excise duties on 
imports, with the exception of around 200 categories of 
strategic and military goods from Russia. The trade mission 
intends to create an international association for insuring 
commercial deals and investments in Georgia. It has the right 
to conclude direct contracts with Russian producers -- Georgia 
cannot afford to pay huge commissions to trade agents. Branches 
of the trade mission are also opening in Tyumen, Saratov, St. 
Petersburg, and Kaliningrad at the same time as the main office 
at No. 42, The Arbat.

  [Text] Defense and security cooperation have been under 
discussion in Brussels, at NATO headquarters, and particularly 
in connection with the NATO Partnership for Peace [PFP] plan. 
The Estonian representatives have had several meetings. A 
meeting with Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev had also 
been likely before the conference began but it never took place. 
  In an interview to Estonian Radio, Major General Aleksander 
Einseln, the Estonian defense forces commander, said that he had 
had a meeting with the U.S. Defense Secretary and his general 
staff as well as with a NATO forces commander. According to 
Einseln, Estonia can count on their comprehensive support. The 
Estonian defense forces commander concluded that it is 
beneficial to Estonia that Russia is joining the PFP plan. 
  Estonia's cooperation with NATO is increasing. Our NATO 
representative is currently making preparations in the 
Netherlands for the exercises due in October, and Estonian 
defense forces will also take part.

  [Text] TALLINN, May 25, BNS - The United States say they 
will extend financial support for Estonia over the issue of the 
pullout of retired Russian military, Estonian Foreign Minister 
Juri Luik said Wednesday [25 May]. 
  Luik was briefing reporters on a letter from U.S. Secretary 
of State Warren Christopher in which Christopher says the United 
States will give Estonia 1,000 vouchers to buy for some of the 
retired Russian military living in Estonia flats in Russia. 
  The Estonian Foreign Minister hailed the Washington proposal 
as a very positive one and expressed hope that also other 
countries would join U.S. and help Estonia to resolve the issue 
of Russian military pensioners. 
  U.S. Vice President Al Gore at a meeting with Estonian Prime 
Minister Mart Laar during Laar's visit to Washington last month 
said the United States was ready in principle to give initially 
aid for sponsoring the moving out from Estonia of some 300 
retired Russian military. 
  Gore had also said his country was going to do everything so 
that Estonia would be free of Russian military presence by Aug. 
31, 1994, adding that this was the logical final aim of the U.S. 
policy of non-recognition of the incorporation of the Baltics 
into the Soviet Union in 1940.

  [Text] TALLINN, May 25, BNS - The traces of persons having 
illegally brought Kurdish emigrants to Estonia lead to Russia 
and investigators in Tallinn are now expecting "active 
attendance" to the issue from the respective Russian bodies, 
said the head of the Estonian Border Guard Department, Tarmo 
Kouts. 
  Estonian border officials and the police "K" special task 
force in a joint operation on May 5 arrested five persons 
suspected of being engaged in organizing the illegal transits. 
One of the persons detained was already being sought by Swedish 
police on the same charges. 
  The head of the Estonian Border Guard Command, Aare Evisalu, 
earlier said Estonia has caught four larger groups of a total 
some 200 Kurdish immigrants having arrived in the country 
illegally this year. 
  Investigation is being conducted into all four cases of 
illegal transit attempts, he said in an interview. 
  The government on March 15 set up an investigation party of 
border guard, Police Department, Central Criminal Police and 
Defense Police officials. 
  Evisalu said that information received at questioning of the 
Kurds had created a possibility to find the persons organizing 
the transit. "On the basis of that information we can bring 
these persons to charges and close the transit route for taking 
the Kurds to the West through Estonia," Evisalu said. 
  Evisalu in the interview a week ago said that investigation 
into who had organized bringing of the Kurds to Estonia was 
expected to be finished within a few weeks' time.

  [Text] Tallinn, May 26, BNS -- The Liberal and Moderate 
factions in the Estonian parliament disagree with each other 
over Prime Minister Mart Laar's nominations for the posts of the 
justice and defense ministers. 
  Liberals say there is no need to appoint new members to the 
Cabinet before the upcoming general meeting of the senior party 
in the ruling coalition, the Pro Patria. 
  "A status quo should be retained in the government until the 
Pro Patria general meeting, and the vacancies should be filled 
with acting ministers," said Eero Tohver, adviser to the faction 
of the Liberals. 
  The Moderates, however, insist that the opinion of Pro 
Patria 
as a coalition partner should be trusted. 
  "We are not going to bring any dissenting opinion with 
respect to the nomination of new ministers," Moderate faction 
chairman Toivo Jullinen said. 
  Prime Minister Mart Laar Tuesday [24 May] proposed to the 
council of the governing coalition the nominations of Urmas 
Arumae as the new justice minister and Raul Opik as the defense 
minister. 
  Arumae, 37, has graduated from Tartu University, faculty of 
law. He wrote his Master's thesis in international business 
administration with San Francisco University in 1992. Arumae 
set up his own law firm, Concordia, after resigning as vice 
president of Silves Enterprises Ltd. Arumae is the president of 
the Estonian Lawyers Union. He was failed as Pro Patria's 
candidate for the Tallinn mayor's office in last year's local 
elections. 
  Raul Opik, currently officer at the Estonian Central Staff, 
graduated from Tartu University as biologist. Has worked as a 
teacher and gone in for amateur flying. Opik participated in 
the 1993 World Championship of Glider Flying. He completed a 
training course in Sweden for staff officers of the UN 
peacekeeping forces last year and took part in UN operations in 
Croatia. 
  President Lennart Meri formally dismissed former Defense 
Minister Indrek Kannik and Justice Minister Kaido Kama Monday.

  [Text] Tallinn, May 26, BNS -- A common air space defense 
system of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania may create better 
chances for the three countries to become NATO members soon, 
officials expect. 
  "If the three Baltic countries reach a common system as to 
the technical and organizational level of their air space 
defense, this may become a strong starting point in their 
joining NATO. The NATO members have set up a common air space 
defense system which strongly ties these countries with each 
other," said Colonel Vello Loemaa, head of the air space defense 
division at the Estonian Army Central Staff. 
  All three Baltic countries have joined NATO's Partnership 
for 
Peace plan and are working toward setting up a common 
peacekeeping battalion to take part in UN operations by November 
1995. Also these steps are expected to speed up movement toward 
full member status in the North Atlantic Alliance. 
  Air space defense chiefs of the three countries at a meeting 
in Lithuania's Meskuiciai air base Tuesday [24 May] signed a 
protocol about starting preparations for setting up a common air 
space defense system and joint training of pilots. 
  "We try to coordinate air space defense-related activity and 
develop it with minimum expense. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania 
currently are in a rather similar situation, but develop 
different contacts. We must make joint efforts to create a 
common air space defense system," Loemaa told BNS. 
  He said the Baltics are also considering the purchase of air 
space defense-related technology, including radars. 
  "This, of course, is a long-term program that will become a 
reality only after several years. But we expect to make the 
first concrete steps already this year," Loemaa said. 
  Lithuanian experts have estimated that setting up a 
structure 
to control the entire Baltic air space would take between 5 and 
10 years. 
  Loemaa added that the defense forces of Latvia and Lithuania 
are better equipped with aircraft than the forces in Estonia. 
  Lithuania currently operates three air bases for its air 
force fleet of four Czech-made L-39 jet fighters, two L-140 
transport planes received as gift from Germany, and tens of 
older Soviet-made AN-2 aircraft the country uses to train its 
paratroopers. Lithuania also has Soviet-made Mi-8 helicopters, 
mainly used by the country's rescue service.

  [Text] Peking, 27 May -- A meeting between Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, Chairman of the Russian Federation Government, who 
is on an official visit to China, and Jiang Zemin, Chairman of 
the PRC, took place today in the state residence of Zhongnanhai. 
  "I believe that cooperation between the two countries is 
developing very successfully", Jiang Zemin said, opening the 
meeting. He expressed confidence that the visit of the head of 
the Russian Government would give a new boost to economic 
cooperation. 
  Viktor Chernomyrdin conveyed to PRC Chairman Jiang Zemin 
greetings from Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin and 
his invitation to visit Russia in early September this year. 
  During the course of the meeting Viktor Chernomyrdin also 
pointed out that Russo-Chinese relations are flourishing and are 
not dependent on changes in the political scene. The level of 
mutual relations and cooperation which has been achieved between 
Russia and China gives hopes for Rusian-Chinese relations to be 
switched to a higher stage -- a stage of economic cooperation.

and income tax evasion, a protocol of the second session of the 
Russo- Chinese intergovernmental commission on technical, 
economic, scientific and technical cooperation, agreements on 
economic, scientific and technical cooperation in the 
agro-industrial centre, on cooperation in sea shipping,

  [Text] Moscow May 26 TASS -- The State Duma (lower house of 
the Russian parliament) mounted the first attack on the six 
recent economic decrees by President Boris Yeltsin on Thursday. 
  Calling them "unconstitutional", Deputy Valentin Martemyanov 
(Russian Communist Party) proposed that the president's 
documents should be debated at the chamber's plenary meeting. 
  However, his proposal failed, collecting only 167 votes in 
support. 
  Therefore, the item worded by the legislator as 
"unconstitutional decrees by the president and measures to stop 
them" was not put on the agenda of the meeting. However, 
analysts believe that the attack on Yeltsin's economic decrees 
is not the last one.

  [Text] Vladikavkaz May 26 TASS -- The situation in the zone 
under state of emergency on the territory of North Ossetia has 
sharpened again, according to military sources. 
  This is connected with the fact that on May 25 at about 9 
p.m. unidentified persons shot at a Zhiguliy car with two people 
inside near the village of Yuznyy situated in the security zone. 
Both people died of mortal gunshot wounds. The incident is 
being investigated. 
  The situation in the zone under state of emergency is 
aggravated by acts of terrorism, bandit attacks and incessant 
taking of hostages, a spokesman for the press service of the 
president and the government of North Ossetia told ITAR-TASS. 
  Unfortunately, so far the fate of three citizens of North 
Ossetia taken hostages in the village of Maiskiy of the 
Prigorodnyy district on March 30 this year, is not known yet. 
  The measures carried out to search and liberate six Ingushes 
who were taken hostages by criminals on May 19 in the city of 
Vladikavkaz have not produced positive results either. 
  Today President of North Ossetia Akhsarbek Galazov met with 
members of the presidiums of the government and the parliament 
of the republic, representatives of the law enforcement bodies 
of North Ossetia and the temporary administration. They 
discussed urgent measures to search for the hostages. 
  The president expressed an extremely negative attitude to 
the 
unlawful actions of persons involved in the crimes in the 
Maiskiy village and in Vladikavkaz, and stated that the 
leadership of North Ossetia would do everything in its power to 
find hostages and take additional measures to ensure security of 
residents of the republic.

<F P=106> [By UKRINFORM correspondent Sergey Balykov for TASS] </F>
  [Text] Kiev May 26 TASS -- Ukrainian Acting Prime Minister 
Yukhym Zvyahilskyy believes the talks in Moscow on the Black Sea 
Fleet and the Crimea ended in a draw. "In Moscow we did not 
win, but did not lose either," he told UKRINFORM upon his return 
from the Russian capital. 
  Zvyahilskyy described the talks as "very tense and nervous." 
"We tried to find variants of a positive solution of the tasks 
set by the Ukrainian president. We made concessions, but only 
those which could not result in the loss of Ukrainian wealth, 
its independence and sovereignty," he stressed. 
  The head of government said that five variants of the 
agreement, including that of the president, were submitted for 
Russian consideration. "The fact that none of them was adopted 
does not mean a defeat," he stressed and added that positive 
moments achieved in Moscow would help resume talks "more 
concretely, on the most acute issue." 
  The second round of negotiations is expected to begin in 
Kiev 
in 10-15 days. 
  According to Zvyahilskyy, during the Moscow talks "severe 
fight was going on for each word, for each sentence in the 
document which can help untie the Black Sea knot." He believes 
that the sides succeeded in general to positively solve the 
problem of sharing the disputed navy. Sevastopol will house the 
major base of the Russian Navy, while Balaklava and Donuzlav 
will become the main bases of the Ukrainian fleet, according to 
him. 
  "Donuzlav is a mighty and well-equipped base and Ukraine had 
no serious objections" about it. "Disagreements emerged after 
the Russian side raised the issue of basing its navy in other 
ports," he explained. 
  Zvyahilskyy hopes that the second round of negotiations will 
be "more constructive" and will result in the signing of the 
document on the Black Sea Fleet.

  [Text] On Wednesday Boris Oleynik, chief of the Ukrainian 
parliamentary delegation at the negotiations with the Crimean 
Supreme Council delegation, at a news conference voiced his 
satisfaction with the results of the meeting with delegates from 
the peninsula. As is known, a decision was made to recommend to 
the Ukrainian and Crimean Supreme Councils that they set up a 
joint working group. The Ukrainian delegation asked the Crimean 
Supreme Council within three days to consider the question of 
suspending the legislative acts adopted on 20 May for the entire 
period that the joint working group will be in session. 
  Sergey Tsekov, chairman of the Crimean Supreme Council, 
stated that Crimea has no intention of seceding from Ukraine: 
"This can be suggested only by those who are not familiar with 
the content of Crimean laws." True, he failed to respond to the 
question about how his words correlate with the program 
provision of the Crimean Republican Party, of which he is a 
member, about the peninsula's joining Russia.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Diplomats Are Interpreting the </F>
Crimean Problem"] 
  [Text] As is known, Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
sent an appeal by Minister A. Zlenko to the heads of the 
external political departments of other states on the recent 
events in the Crimea. Responses to the document are already 
streaming in. For example, the German Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs disseminated the statement by FRG Foreign Minister K. 
Kinkel to the effect that the Federal Government is following 
the recent events on the Crimean Peninsula with concern. 
Ukraine's territorial integrity and independence are essential 
for stability and peaceful relations in Europe and cannot be 
subject to any doubt. The Federal Government hopes, continues 
the statement by the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, that 
all interested political forces realize the significance of the 
fundamental obligations within the framework of the CSCE and the 
unconditional need to adhere to them. 
  The head of the Finnish external political department, H. 
Haavisto, stated that he hoped that the problems that had arisen 
after the well-known decision by the Crimean Supreme Council 
would be resolved as soon as possible through negotiations and 
assured that Ukraine's position and concern would be brought to 
the attention of the state's top-level leadership. 
  During the meeting of Ukrainian Ambassador in the Moldovan 
Republic V. Boyko with Moldovan Minister of Foreign Affairs N. 
Osmoquescu [as published], the Moldovan side assured the 
ambassador that the content of the letter would be brought to 
the attention of President M. Snegur and leadership of the 
Moldovan parliament. Moldova, which has suffered from the 
policy of separatism, pointed out the head of the Moldovan 
external political department, is fully aware of the danger that 
the actions of the Crimean power structures are fraught with, 
fully supports the Ukrainian leadership, and condemns the 
separatists.

  [Text] Moscow May 27 TASS -- Sergey Shakhray on Friday said 
his resignation as vice-premier is no longer on the agenda. "The 
president did not accept my resignation and I found it incorrect 
to insist further," he said in an interview with ITAR-TASS. 
Shakhray added that republics and other regions within the 
Russian Federation had sent many appeals to the president not to 
accept his resignation. 
  Shakhray said he discussed with President Yeltsin different 
aspects of the regional policy, including the signing of the 
agreement with Kaliningrad, the regulation of relations with the 
Chechen Republic and a mechanism implementing the treaty with 
Tatarstan. 
  Explaining his recent moves, including the announcement of 
his resignation, Shakhray referred to the breach of office 
ethics in dismissing him from the post of the minister of 
nationalities and regional policy. According to Shakhray, "it 
is not ethical to work on the president's team and announce 
one's disagreement with things. I do not want to repeat the 
behavior of some politicians". These were the motives behind 
his announced resignation. 
  As concerns his relations with the newly appointed Minister 
Nikolay Yegorov, Shakhray said he would "help the new minister 
of nationalities and regional policy. I wished him well when 
introducing the man to the ministry collective. Now everything 
will depend on himself".

<F P=106> [Mariya Bogdanova report: "Sergey Shakhray Stays On as </F>
Deputy Prime Minister. Shumeyko and Yegorov Get a Supervisor"] 
  [Text] Sergey Shakhray, leader of the Party for Russian 
Unity and Accord, is expected to meet with Moscow State 
University students today; tomorrow he will attend a seminar at 
the "Lesnyye Dali" guest house outside Moscow designed to help 
draw up a nationalities policy concept. Sergey Shakhray will 
emerge before the audience as a victor: The president did not 
accept his resignation from the post of deputy prime minister. 
  Boris Yeltsin, pointing a week ago through his press 
secretary to Sergey Shakhray's "capriciousness," was nonetheless 
forced to indulge the unsinkable politician's whims. On 
Wednesday evening he told Sergey Shakhray during a private 
meeting that he would not accept his resignation from the post 
of deputy prime minister. Sergey Shakhray managed to show yet 
again how much he matters for the Russian authorities and to 
prove that his opponents' seemingly final victories are never 
final. 
  By some accounts, it was representatives of the "Siberian 
Accord" interregional association and some regional leaders -- 
evidently very far from the south from which the new minister, 
Nikolay Yegorov, arrived in Moscow -- who threw their weight 
behind Shakhray in the Kremlin. Mintimer Shaymiyev, together 
with whom Shakhray made a proposal the other day on the Crimea 
problem settlement, might be one of them. As a matter of fact, 
during the meeting with the president, they discussed the 
implementation of the treaty between Moscow and Kazan and the 
preparation of a similar treaty with Kaliningrad. 
  According to the press service of Shakhray's party, he 
promised to the president that he "will work" to ensure 
coordination between the government, the Federal Assembly, and 
the future Constitutional Court, to supervise the mass media, 
and to continue to oversee regional and nationalities policy. 
The latter obviously bodes no good to the Krasnodar team of 
Shumeyko-Yegorov, which could have been almost fully in control 
of relations between Moscow and the regions if Shakhray had 
finally left the government. While under them a speedy start of 
talks between Moscow and Groznyy has become a fairly realistic 
possibility, now Shakhray looks certain to continue his 
relations with the Chechen opposition along parallel lines.

  [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin expressed extreme 
concern over the criminalization of society. Speaking at the 
All-Russian conference of the Federal Counter-Intelligence 
Service [FCIS] in Moscow on Thursday, he pointed out that 
"violent crimes by organized groups take the form of criminal 
terrorism." 
  In Yeltsin's words, "the corruption of power structures, 
law-enforcement and other state bodies especially in the sphere 
of redistribution of property is extremely dangerous for the 
state." 
  The Russian president noted that "organized crime is already 
not confined to the sphere of regular crimes. It seeks to enter 
big politics, to gain access to ruling the state and its 
regions." 
  The FCIS should prevent such attempts with all of its 
operational and technical potential, Yeltsin said. "In 
interaction with the Interior Ministry and tax police it is 
necessary to reveal criminal sources, the financing of political 
campaigns, ties of state and political figures with organizers 
of criminal gangs which seek to have their people in state 
bodies, and are subsidized from abroad," he pointed out. 
  The president noted that Russia's nuclear safety is an 
extremely important problem. "We should prevent proliferation of 
nuclear and other arms of mass annihilation all over the country 
and abroad," he noted. 
  Yeltsin believes that the counter-intelligence bodies should 
be outside politics. As for its servicemen they cannot combine 
their work with political activities, i.e. to serve the 
interests of a party or a public organization.

<F P=106> [Address from Republic of Belarus Government "To the Readers </F>
of This Issue"] 
  [Text] Esteemed rural workers of the Russian Federation! 
The mutual interest in the lives of our states' peoples is 
determined by the proximity of their destinies in the past and 
present. 
  The Belarusian countryside is experiencing similar 
difficulties to the Russian countryside at a complex period in 
its history. In the recent past Belarus was one of the leading 
republics in terms of per capita agricultural production. 
  The marketable production of milk, meat, and potatoes made 
it 
possible not only to meet our own requirements but also to 
deliver a substantial quantity, under mutually advantageous 
exchange, to other republics and primarily to Russia. Large 
livestock raising complexes similar to the specialized farming 
facilities of Western countries made it possible to achieve high 
production indicators. 
  Belarus was one of the Russian countryside' most reliable 
partners for deliveries of tractors, other agricultural 
equipment, and mineral fertilizers. Today too it is prepared 
for the closest cooperation with Russia's rural workers and to 
supply reliable equipment and other output. The actions of our 
states' governments in concluding the treaty on the union of our 
monetary systems were also aimed at such relations. 
  With the start of the treaty's operation artificial 
obstacles 
will be lifted which are dividing not only states but primarily 
the inhabitants of cities and villages -- barriers which have 
artificially arisen between us. 
  The present development of the Republic of Belarus' 
agriculture is proceeding within the scheme of a mixed economy 
and rational support for collective farms and peasants' private 
plots. The main principle of our reforms in the countryside is 
not to destroy but to help all commodity producers irrespective 
of forms of ownership, all those who are able and capable and 
willing to work honestly on the land. 
  The breakdown of our ties is affecting the position of the 
Belarusian countryside, the production of reliable agricultural 
equipment, and the mutually advantageous exchange of the fruit 
of their labor between the peoples of Russia and Belarus. 
  We sincerely hope that this influence is of a temporary, 
transient nature and that common sense will prevail. 
  We wish that the Russian rural workers may successfully 
overcome the difficulties of our complex time and we wish them 
favorable conditions for spring work and hope for the 
restoration and development of the traditional fraternal ties 
with the Belarusian countryside and between our peoples.

  [Text] The Armenian and Azerbaijani formations operating in 
the zone of the Karabakh conflict have violated the cease-fire 
agreement on several occasions, although the general situation 
is relatively calm. 
  According to a well-informed source in the Azerbaijani 
Defense Ministry, Karabakh soldiers fired at the Azerbaijani 
positions in the Fizuli, Geranboy and Agdam regions. 
  The same source reports that a number of villages in 
Azerbaijan's Tauz and Kedabek border regions were shelled from 
Armenia and that personnel and equipment were transferred from 
Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  Meanwhile, the Karabakh Defense Ministry's press service 
reports that Azerbaijani units shelled Karabakh positions in the 
Agdam direction last night. No return fire was opened.

<F P=106> [Remarks by Juri Luik, foreign minister of the Republic of </F>
Estonia, at the Inaugural Conference for the Pact on Stability 
in Europe, in Paris on 26 May --received via Internet E-LIST] 
  [Text] Mr. Chairman, Dear Colleagues, Ladies and 
Gentlemen, 
  For half of the 20th century, half of our continent was not 
able to realize democracy. The political and economic results 
of the Second World War effectively put democratic development 
in the states of Central and Eastern Europe on hold. Now is the 
time to give democracy a renewed push in the right direction by 
dealing in a practical way with border and minorities issues. 
We share the view of the European Union that it is better to 
open these questions for discussion, to talk through the 
difficulties and reach practical solutions rather than to ignore 
the problems or worse, to suppress their existence. For this 
reason, we welcome the Pact on Stability in Europe as a way to 
resolve the problems at hand. We believe this Pact is a tool 
through which we can implement the principles upon which the 
Council of Europe and the CSCE are founded, a process which, 
ultimately, will enhance stability on the continent. 
  Mr. Chairman, when the Pact for Stability was first 
introduced, we were eager to use it as a means to reach a final 
consensus on our own border question. As you know, the Russian 
Federation does not recognize the Tartu Peace Treaty which is so 
far actually the only international treaty constituting the 
border between our two countries. In the course of negotiations 
over the text of the Pact, the formulation used in referring to 
border questions has evolved considerably. If in the beginning 
we spoke of the consolidation of borders, then today we are 
approaching the question on the basis, and I quote from Pact, 
"of inviolability of frontiers, territorial integrity and 
respect of existing borders, according to the principles of the 
Helsinki Final to be seen as a whole" (end of quote). Mr. 
Chairman, with your permission, I request the participating 
states to note that Estonia regards existing borders to be those 
fixed by international treaties concluded between states. I 
would further ask you to note that borders fixed by 
international treaties can only be changed by other 
international treaties which supersede the previous ones. Under 
the terms of the Helsinki Final Act, borders are considered 
inviolable but they may be changed, and I quote, "in accordance 
with international law, by peaceful means and by agreement" (end 
of quote). It is exactly this peaceful and law-based approach 
to resolving border questions that we have sought to 
operationalize within the Pact for Stability. We recognize that 
a problem exists, and we want to solve it. But discussion is 
necessary in order to create the conditions for resolution. 
Unfortunately, some states have taken an unconstructive 
approach to this question, thus far refusing to talk about the 
matter with us, either within the framework of the Pact or in 
other fora. We remain hopeful that in the interest of 
stability, the other interested party will eventually come to 
the table and agree to talk with the European Union and with us 
about the problem. 
  The second basket of the Pact concerns minorities. I am 
happy to report that the question of minorities has found a 
liberal solution in Estonia, in keeping with the civic 
traditions of our society. Last autumn, our parliament passed a 
law on Cultural Autonomy, which was based on our 1925 law 
providing national minorities numbering at least three thousand 
persons with state support for schooling and churches in their 
mother tongue as well as cultural self-governments legally 
equivalent to local governments. The CSCE High Commissioner on 
National Minorities, Mr. Max van der Stoel, made a point last 
summer of praising this law as an example for other states in 
protecting minority rights. 
  But we have not stopped there. A bilateral agreement is 
ready to be signed with Belarus extending our Law on Cultural 
Autonomy to Belarusians who live in Estonia but are not numerous 
enough to qualify as a national minority group. There is one 
more issue in this basket worth noting. As we all are aware, a 
myriad of other problems stem from the resettlement of peoples 
for political reasons by the Soviet central authorities during 
the annexation of Estonia. Here, the key issue is to integrate 
into society people who may never decide to opt for Estonian 
citizenship. For this reason, we have decided to treat 
questions of integration separately and parallel to minority 
issues within the Pact for Stability. Central elements here 
include practical assistance in processing applications, 
language training, information exchange and matters of 
education. I think all parties should be interested in 
resolving these practical problems that are key to enhancing 
stability in our corner of the world. 
  Finally, I would say a few words about the round-tables 
which, alongside continuing bilateral negotiations, are intended 
to be the actual instruments through which to attain the goals 
of the Pact. From the start of talks on this Pact, we have 
lobbied to establish a concrete Baltic round-table, to follow 
the lines of the Council of Baltic Sea States and to be 
supplemented by other interested states. We saw the idea of a 
Baltic round-table as an innovative and creative way of fleshing 
out the general round-table idea. Through greater regional 
specificity, we believed the Baltic round-table would have a 
more focused approach that would lead to more effective and 
concrete solutions. 
  I do not wish to reiterate--knowing well that the Pact does 
not directly deal with military and security issues--but I would 
not be honest if I did not call your attention to the fact that 
the withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia and Estonia by 31 
August 1994 would be essential for maintaining stability and 
democracy in the region. Mr. Chairman, I wish to conclude my 
remarks by thanking French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur for 
having initiated the idea of this Pact. I also wish to thank 
the European Union for having taken an active interest and a 
leading role in resolving the delicate questions of the day. 
Estonia remains hopeful that the intervention of the Union, 
alongside other European institutions, in particular the Council 
of Europe and the CSCE, will, in fact, lead to enhanced 
stability on our continent. 
  Thank you.

  [Text] The Interstate Space Committee uniting the former 
Soviet republics, except the Baltic countries and Georgia, is to 
adopt a program for cooperation in the exploration and 
utilization of space in 1994. 
  A high-ranking representative of the Russian Space Agency, 
involved in organizing the committee's session, to be held in 
Moscow on June 2 and 3, told INTERFAX that the draft program 
envisaged allocations of 1.25 trillion rubles (in January 1994 
prices). However, this sum is likely to be increased to 2 
trillion rubles, he said. 
  In accordance with the project, another six satellites will 
be deployed within the framework of the program for creating the 
Gonets low-orbit global communication system (two experimental 
satellites of this series are on orbit already). In addition 
there are plans to launch the first four satellites of the 
Signal space communication system. 
  The program also provides for financing the development of 
heavy- duty boosters, including Energiya M and Proton M ones, 
and Start-1 and Start-1 super-light boosters.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 28 (ITAR-TASS) -- Today's Moscow 
newspapers concentrate on Aleksandr Solzhenitsin's return to 
Russia. Here are some of the headlines: "I Believe in Russia's 
Revival" (TRUD), "Fates of Real Russian Writers Are Similar in 
One Thing: They Return Dead or Alive" (KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA). 
  The SEGODNYA newspaper states that neither Leonid Brezhnev 
with Gerald Ford, nor Mikhail Gorbachev, nor still Boris Yeltsin 
drew so many journalists to Vladivostok. 
  The NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper compares Solzhenitsin with 
a Roetgen unit which will x-ray in public some souls, minds and 
characters to his countrymen. There are some discordant notes 
in generally good-willed statements. 
  Quoting author Eduard Limonov, the PRAVDA newspaper believes 
that Solzhenitsyn returned "not on the white horse", since he is 
allegedly responsible "for the false image of Russia and 
Russians he presented to the West". 
  The entire world was following for over 24 hours another 
drama which began at the ill-starred Mineralnye Vody airport on 
Thursday. All newspapers report the favourable end of the story 
with hostages who were freed and terrorists arrested. 
  The commentary in TRUD on this issue differs from mere 
statements of the terrorists' detention in the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA 
newspaper, NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, PRAVDA and other periodicals. 
  TRUD notes that this terrorist action "is another argument 
in 
favour of those who allege that all law-abiding Russians, 
without exception, even now are captives of trigger-happy 
mafiosi and other criminal organisations". 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA writes with sarcasm: "It becomes 
boring: 
a chopper and sacks with greenbacks again". 
  Moscow periodicals continue to cover events in the Crimea. 
Newspapers' opinions on this issue are diverse. "Passions are 
coming down," PRAVDA writes. "Crimean residents are not storing 
salt and matches for the time being," KOMSOMOSLAYA PRAVDA claims. 
  "The Moscow-Kiev-Simferopol triangle threatens to turn into 
the Bermuda one," KRASNAYA ZVEZDA writes with alarm. The 
newspaper notes that the Russian-Ukrainian talks "stumbled 
again". 
  To all appearances, the daily writes, Russia will have to 
lead them patiently and consistently, defending its position 
both from Kiev impromptu actions and calls from extremists who 
live in the Crimea too. 
  "Let us hope that those who would like to turn the fleet 
into 
a hostage of political gambles, will remember that the matter in 
question is a major naval group equipped with advanced weapons," 
the newspaper notes. 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA precedes its analytical article on 
Russia's military budget with a cartoon, showing a sickly 
intellectual swinging a nightstick. In the newspaper's opinion, 
"the force- wielding ministries, free from the president's and 
the government's control, form their budgets on their own". 
  The newspaper continues: "Our legislators are very 
credulous. 
The Army evidently has very weighty arguments, since 
tender-hearted ladies and gallant antimilitarist democrats, 
without digging into details, intend to okay military 
expenditures at a level characteristic of countries engaged in 
warfare". 
  "Is it possible to cut defence outlays?" the newspaper asks 
and replies: "The legislative and executives arms of government 
have been trying to tackle this task for several years now but, 
alas, unsuccessfully". 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA carries an article on a specific military 
topic where member of the Russian Academy of Sciences Nikolay 
Khlopkin appraises the future of nuclear-powered fleet. 
  The scientist writes that Russian submarines have, as a 
rule, 
higher speeds than foreign ones, yielding to them in 
secretiveness. To achieve it, researchers work on cutting 
noisiness of warships. 
  The ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI newspaper notes that the main aim of 
the ongoing visit by Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin to 
China is to step up considerably Russian-Chinese business 
relations. As a result, it is planned that the volume of 
bilateral trade will double by the end of the century.

  [Text] Moscow May 31 TASS -- ROSSISKIYE VESTI on President 
Boris Yeltsi's working trip to Tatarstan: the newspaper 
believes that special attention during the tour will be devoted 
to problems connected with the rebuilding of the motor engine 
making plant, after it was gutted out by fire last year, at the 
kamaz, one of russia's largest autoworks in Naberezhnyye Chelny. 
  ROSSIISKAYA GAZETA singles out a statement by Vice-Premier 
Sergey Shakray that the purpose of Yeltsin's trip to Tatarstan 
is to work out a mechanism to monitor compliance with the treaty 
between Russia and Tatarstan "plus an economic agreement". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries and article headlined "How Much 
Sovereignty Did Tatarstan Gain? boris Yeltsin Decided To See 
That for Himself". The newspaper recalls that it was precisely 
in Tatarstan when Yeltsin as Russian praliament chief running 
for the presidency, uttered his famous phrase: "Take as much 
sovereignty as you can chew". 
  President Yeltsin can now make a real assessment of what has 
been done in this respect by the republic "which through 
persistent efforts over the past two years has gained, perhaps, 
the greatest independence from Moscow", the newspaper noted. 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) focuses on the discussion of a 
bill "on a state-placed defence order" at the State Duma 
committee for industry, construction, transport and power. 
Drafters of the bill are of the opinion, the newspaper points 
out, that such a law will make it possible "more fully to enact 
Russia's military doctrine, enhance the material interests of 
all those who fill a state-placed defence order, raise the role 
of state contracts and agreements, and guarantee material and 
technical resources for defence industry needs". The first 
reading of the bill is to be considered in the state Duma at the 
end of June. 
  RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA, in connection with the current exhibition 
of weapons in Vladimir, writes that "our country, 
notwithstanding a first-class defence potential, has not even 
approached the main sale counters of the arms market". "The 
spheres of influence at the market have long been divided, and 
it is not easy to get there now. But the country must get 
there", for even individual specimens of the most effective 
small arms cost hundreds of thousands of U.S. dollars," the 
newspaper points out. 
  TRUD on Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's homecoming: The return of 
the great writer and citizen, who was forcibly expelled from the 
country twenty years ago, was awaited by many with impatience 
and hope, if only because they saw that as the restoration of 
historical justice". 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA on the death of former East German 
leader Erich Honecker: "Honecker was a staunch romanticist of 
the communist idea. Unlike his fellow leaders in Eastern 
European countries, not a single reproach connected with an 
abuse of official position for personal gain was flung at him." 
  SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA maintains that the package of 
presidential 
decrees, signed on May 23, which cancels export quota-fixing and 
licensing, plunges the country into a new phase of a "democratic 
revolution". The newspaper writes that the decrees considerably 
ease the tax burdern of enterprises with foreign capital and 
"obligingly fling the gate to the west inordinately wide open". 
  PRAVDA on the 95th birthday of writer Leonid Leonov: "There 
is no precedent in the history of world culture when a writer, a 
national classic, would mark his 95th birthday with the 
publication of a new novel summing up the philosophical and 
ethical results of a whole stage in the history of world 
civilisation. The novel in question is The Puramid, 
the publication of which has been started by Nash Sovremennik 
(our contemporary) literary journal". 
  ROSSIISKIYE VESTI reports, referring to a statement by 
Ukrainian first Deputy Interior Minister Valentin Nedrigailo, 
that "there will be no war in the Crimea". An article to this 
effect, headlined "Partnership for Peace: Realities and the 
Interests of Russia", propounds the idea that it is possible to 
maintian stability in Europe "only in active cooperation with 
Russia".

  [Text] On Friday the State Duma voted to set up its own TV 
and radio service as a department in the apparatus of the lower 
chamber of parliament. It will be in charge of preparing daily 
radio and TV programs on activities of representative power 
bodies in Russia. 265 deputies voted in favor of this 
resolution, only 62 were against. 
  Deputies were not stopped by a statement of the presidential 
press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov made the day before, in 
which he described the creation of such a TV and radio service 
as reanimation of "infringement of the former parliament on 
prerogatives of free mass media" and as an attempt by the State 
Duma "to create information privileges" for itself. 
  Kostikov's statement said: "The president is concerned that 
the resumption of information dictate may lead to the fall of 
the Duma's prestige, and this in turn will damage the process of 
strengthening the civic accord." 
  The press secretary also drew attention to the fact that 
neither the president, nor the government, nor the Council of 
Federation have their own broadcasting service. "The president 
urges deputies of the State Duma to show wisdom, political tact, 
and to take into account lessons of living history," Kostikov 
resumed. 
  Most observers doubt that such a step by the State Duma may 
lead to a serious complication of its relations with the 
president. Some experts, however, believe that the latest 
actions by the lower chamber of the parliament confirm the 
recent apprehension expressed by Boris Yeltsin in a conversation 
with the faction Union December 12 about insufficiently 
constructive and fruitful work of the Duma. 
  On Friday most deputies attending the Duma session (189) 
spoke in favor of putting on the agenda the issue "On 
anti-constitutional decrees by the president" proposed by a 
representative of the communist faction. He had in view a 
package of six reformist "economic" decrees by Boris Yeltsin 
made public earlier this week. However, the positive decision on 
putting this issue on agenda ran short of 36 votes. 
  On the same day the State Duma postponed the discussion in 
the second reading of a draft law on the federal budget for 1994 
until June 8. IF Note: According to the treaty on civic accord 
signed by the chairman of the State Duma and a majority of its 
factions, the lower chamber pledged to pass a law on the federal 
budget for this year already in the first half of the year.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Kuznetsov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 27 May -- When the State Duma looks at the 
second reading of the draft 1994 budget on 8 June, the Budget, 
Taxes, Banks, and Finance Committee will recommend that the 
deputies cut spending on a range of articles in the document 
being debated. Committee Deputy Chairman Gennadiy Kulik informed 
correspondents about this today at a news conference. Among 
other things, he said the committee is in favor of cutting 
outlay on foreign economic activities by 2 trillion rubles and 
cutting spending on the state management apparatus by 550-560 
billion rubles. 
  Gennadiy Kulik stressed that the committee will recommend 
that Duma deputies increase defense spending by 3.5-4 trillion 
rubles, and essential scientific research by 700 billion rubles. 
  Kulik also said that in the draft 1994 budget it is planned 
to allocate in all 15.3 trillion rubles to the agro-industrial 
complex. Out of this sum, 5.6 trillion rubles is to be spent on 
purchasing food at federal and regional level. 
  Gennadiy Kulik also stressed that the committee will advise 
the Duma to allocate 1 trillion rubles toward the creation of a 
special leasing fund to sell machinery to agricultural producers 
in installments.

<F P=106> [Yelena Kolokoltseva and Dmitriy Volkov report in the </F>
"Money" column: "The Deputies Showered the Budget With 
Amendments. Second Reading Has Been Postponed for Two Weeks"] 
  [Text] Yesterday the lower parliament chamber failed to 
discuss the 1994 budget in its second reading. The State Duma's 
Committee on Budget, Taxes and Prices did not complete work on 
amendments to the draft law On the Federal Budget for 1994, 
having by yesterday morning discussed only amendments to budget 
revenues. Apparently the news conference by Mikhail Zadornov, 
whose committee continued to work on the amendments, was 
conducted by his deputy Gennadiy Kulik for this reason. 
  He told journalists that the committee will recommend to the 
State Duma to redistribute the funds allocated to internal debt 
servicing, maintenance of the administration apparatus, and 
foreign economic activity in favor of increased appropriations 
to the social sphere, fundamental research, and defense. 
According to Mr. Kulik, the committee understands the 
"difficult situation in which the army has found itself" and is 
therefore going to advise the lower chamber to issue a special 
military loan to support the sector. Economic Policy Committee 
chairman Sergey Glazyev moved an amendment on increasing federal 
budget revenues by 26 trillion rubles on account of pending 
receipts from voucher privatization. Mr. Kulik however noted 
that the privatization revenues planned by Sergey Glazyev should 
be "assessed cautiously." The budget committee proposed 
directing "excess" revenues -- if there are any, they will 
hardly exceed 3 trillion -- to a special army support fund but 
not including these funds immediately among revenues and 
therefore not counting on them in spending. The question of 
increasing army expenditures will apparently be decided at a 
closed session of the lower chamber. 
  However, whether Sergey Glazyev's ideas about a constantly 
growing revenue capability will prevail does not really matter. 
In discussing the budgetary process, the deputies and the press 
concentrate their attention mainly on numerical indicators of 
revenues and expenditures, as well as the maximum size of 
deficit. By proposing novel ideas like "introducing a market 
mechanism of leasing/sale of equipment" to agrarians, the 
deputies are trying to find a compromise between various 
sectoral groups -- in this event the agro-industrial complex and 
machine building. 
  Yet, as long as the present order of spending budget 
resources continues, whereby appropriations are made as revenues 
come into the treasury while the growth of credit emission is 
limited by an agreement between the Central Bank and the Finance 
Ministry, the government retains enough possibilities to hold a 
more or less consistent financial policy. Therefore most 
important will be the Duma's attitude to Mr. Glazyev's proposal 
to "obligate the government and the Central Bank to ensure 
guaranteed -- equally distributed by the months -- financing of 
federal budget expenditures" which, in his opinion, will 
"abolish the vicious practice of arbitrary sequestration of 
state expenditures." In other words, first money is printed and 
then backing is provided for it -- or not provided, but the 
money has already been handed out. This will clearly make the 
growth of expenditures snowball. The budget committee is not 
inclined to support this amendment. On 8 June, during the 
second reading of the budget, this will be a priority item on 
the Duma's agenda.

<F P=106> [Ivan Rodin report under the "Parliament" rubric: "State </F>
Duma Heeds Lukin. Law on International Treaties Passed in First 
Reading"] 
  [Text] Yesterday the State Duma considered and passed in 
the first reading the draft Law on International Treaties of the 
Russian Federation. The draft of the same name once sparked a 
lengthy discussion at the Supreme Soviet, which was centered 
primarily on whether the parliament is entitled to ratify and 
annul international treaties at its discretion or whether it has 
necessarily to wait for the executive branch's presentation. At 
the time, the Supreme Soviet effectively agreed for the first 
time to look for a compromise with its opponents from the 
Foreign Ministry and the presidential main political 
administration, but then came 21 September. 
  Yesterday, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Krylov told 
deputies about the main provisions of the draft law: for 
instance, about Article 15, which contains a list of 
international treaties subject to mandatory ratification, and 
Article 16, which describes the procedure for making proposals 
regarding ratification, and so forth. 
  The deputies' questions to the deputy minister focused for 
the most part on a period of time within which draft laws on 
ratification must be submitted to the State Duma. An attempt 
was also made to find out why a number of treaties (START-2 and 
the Treaty with Georgia), which were signed, but not ratified, 
have effectively been not adhered to. 
  Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the State Duma International 
Affairs Committee, delivered a co-report, saying that after some 
additional work on the draft law it can rather be considered a 
parliamentary than presidential one. Mr. Lukin recommended that 
the draft be approved in the first reading. 
  He noted, however, that the draft does have drawbacks: Since 
the act of ratification must be formalized by a law, other 
authorities aside from the president and the government, the 
State Duma for instance, can also sponsor them; it has not been 
specified who in Russia can object to reservations made by other 
signatories to the treaties (Mr. Lukin made sure that the 
Federal Assembly must have the right to do so); the list of 
treaties subject to mandatory ratification is also far from 
complete. 
  Mr. Lukin pointed out that all his concerns can be met by 
four amendments that the committee proposed to approve in one 
vote together with the draft law, which is what the State Duma 
did without further debate, although State Duma members who 
formerly were Supreme Soviet deputies vainly attempted to 
provoke a discussion and to raise its temperature.

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Kuznets report under "Legislation" rubric: </F>
"`Superlaw' Gets Approved by All Excerpt Communists. State Duma 
Passes Part of Russian Federation Civil Code in First Reading"] 
  [Text] Yesterday, the State Duma passed in its first 
reading part of the Russian Federation Civil Code. This is the 
first "new edition" of the Civil Code since 1964. The old code 
has become obsolete over the 30 years, and in the Justice 
Ministry's admission, "it has not worked de facto for several 
years now." The document, comprising three sections and 450 
articles, encompasses all the economic, property-based, and 
other relationships of Russian Federation citizens among 
themselves and with the state. If you add to that the relations 
of the above with citizens of other countries, the new edition 
of the Civil Code is going to be a really all-inclusive act, an 
"economic constitution" of direct action. If you consider 
Article 3 of the Code, which establishes the supremacy of the 
Civil Code over the other codes (land, water, family, and other 
codes cannot contradict it under this article), the new edition 
indeed looks to be a "superlaw," as the deputies have dubbed it. 
  All the speakers -- both those advocating and opposing the 
Civil Code -- noted the need to pass a document that should be 
"economically suitable," and the impeccable legal technique of 
its Justice Ministry drafters. Indeed, the section dealing with 
ownership has been written so precisely that a law on ownership 
"appears to be absolutely unnecessary." Inheritance, 
authorship, and other relationships have received full treatment 
in the Civil Code. The deputy chairman of the Duma Legislation 
Committee, Mr. Zapolskiy, who presented -- as did the justice 
minister, Mr. Kalmykov -- a report, urged the house to pass the 
Civil Code, which would "ensure a stable economic regime in the 
country. The Code is in itself both a regulating and a 
"framework" act. There should be addenda to the Civil Code in 
the shape of mortgage, cooperation, pawnshop, etc., laws, 
whereas the Civil Code would also be a valuable working act. 
  The only Duma faction expressly against the document was the 
Communists. Valentin Martemyanov, Communist Party of the 
Russian Federation spokesman, attributed this to the fact that 
"private ownership, especially of land, would become 
disproportionate. The Communist Party of the Russian Federation 
opposes a free turnover of land ownership, which should only be 
reserved for land taken up by a house, truck garden, or orchard. 
Moreover, the Communist Party disagrees with the slighting of 
collective property by having not even mentioned it in the 
draft." In the Communists' opinion, the Civil Code should not 
be a substitute for a land code. 
  The Agrarians, too, adhered to such a view. It was, however, 
decided, at their suggestion, to establish in the second reading 
the supremacy over the Civil Code of the land code being 
currently drafted at the Ministry of Agriculture under the 
guidance of Vice Premier Zaveryukha. This entry was included in 
the Duma decree, and the Agrarians agreed to approve the Civil 
Code. An "intercommittee Duma commission" will be set to 
include representatives of the Justice Ministry to finalize the 
draft.

for the Publication and Enactment of Federal Constitutional 
Laws, Federal Laws, and Acts of Chambers of the Federal 
Assembly' Was Adopted 25 May by the State Duma"] 
  [Text] As we know, on 25 May the Duma had already adopted 
this law, but it had not been approved by the Federation 
Council. In this connection, a coordination commission was 
created, made up of representatives of both chambers of the 
Federal Assembly and the Russian Federation president. It 
prepared a new single text of the law. 
  The adopted document envisages that the day of the adoption 
of a federal law by the State Duma in its final wording is 
considered to be the date of its adoption. The date of the 
adoption of a federal constitutional law is the day when it is 
approved by the Federal Assembly chambers according to the 
procedure established by the Russian Federation Constitution. 
  According to the document, the first publication of a 
federal 
constitutional law, a federal law, or an act of a Federal 
Assembly chamber in its full text in ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA or 
SOBRANIYE ZAKONODATELSTVA RF is considered to be the official 
publication.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: No. 102 (592)] </F>
  [Text] President Snegur criticized his opponents who doubt 
the importance of having a national army, and described their 
statements as "incompetent and ill-meaning." 
  "It's not the president who needs an army, but the people 
who 
want to live and work in peace," he told the national army's 
flight brigade. 
  He said he was convinced that Moldova's sound forces 
supported the government's efforts to consolidate the state and 
strengthened the armed forces. 
  "The creation of armed forces was not a caprice, but a 
strong 
necessity, given the current complicated geopolitical situation. 
Obviously, Moldova cannot exist without armed forces capable of 
curbing encroachments on its state system, integrity and 
independence," said Snegur. He also said he favored further 
improvement in the armed forces on the basis of other countries' 
experience. 
  Speaking about the armed forces' future, Snegur said that 
the 
army must be oriented to the norms and standards of the western 
European states with solid democratic traditions. He believes, 
at the same time, that Moldova must have small but well-trained 
and well-equipped mobile armed forces capable of ensuring 
Moldova's security. He is convinced that the army must not be a 
burden for the nation. 
  He emphasized that despite the problems of the transitional 
period, the government will find ways of financing and equipping 
the army, and urged the armed forces to help the nation solve 
economic problems. 
  Speaking about the current political situation, Snegur said 
that after the multi-party parliamentary elections a cardinally 
new political situation had taken shape, an efficient deputies' 
corps came into being and the Agrarian-Democratic Party formed 
up a reformer government. All this is expected to help the 
nation overcome the economic crisis. He also said that there 
were objective difficulties which slowed down the implementation 
of a resolute economic stabilization policy and measures to 
enhance the population's living standards, above all unfavorable 
weather conditions and price liberalization. He expressed 
confidence, however, that all of these problems would be 
overcome if the government were supported and understood by the 
entire population, including servicemen.

  [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] May 27 TASS -- "The situation 
in Ukraine is an internal affair of that country and does not 
require outside intervention," Moldavian [Moldovan] President 
Mircea Snegur said today. "Any advice and instruction might 
result in grave consequences. Ukraine, according to its 
Constitution, is an integral state, and we hope that it will 
resolve the problems, which have cropped up through peaceful 
negotiations. We are not indifferent to how the situation 
develops in our neighbouring state with whom we maintain cordial 
relations," the Moldavian head of state said. 
  According to Mircea Snegur, the events in Ukraine belong to 
the category of those which are caused by seperatism. 
Seperatist tendencies should be condemned, since they do not 
lead to anything good. Conflicting situations in the former 
Soviet Union and in the whole world testify to this fact. I 
condemn seperatism as a phenomenon," the Moldavian leader 
emphasised. 
  The Moldavian president expressed the hope that forces 
capable of regulating problems in the Crimea would be found. 
According to him, these problems "are a result of the 
populistic activities of certain politicians, who are 
unwarrantedly claiming too much."

the explosion of a bomb in Boris Luchik's apartment he and one 
of his bodyguards were hospitalized at the Centre of Burns from 
Odessa. In the attempt Luchik received burns covering 60 
percent of his body, his bodyguard 75 percent. Boris Luchik's 
wife, Valentina died just after the explosion. 
  Tiraspol officials gave the opinion on the local radio that 
the attempt on prosecutor's life was advantageous for Colonel 
Bergman, commander of the military division, who was earlier 
under investigation. The commander of the 14th Army declared 
that the attempt was probably organized by Vadim Shevtsov 
(Antyufeyev), as the Dniester prosecutor had authorized the 
arrest of Limanskiy, ex-deputy chairman of the Slobozia District 
Soviet.

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 28/5/1994 -- The International 
Conference "Central and Eastern Europe: Search for Security and 
Stability" finished yesterday in Chisinau. The participants 
examined several questions regarding the situation in the former 
Soviet countries. 
  Leader of the Moldovan Socialist Democratic Party (PSDM) 
Oazu 
Nantoi pointed out that undoubtedly Moldova is under the 
military and strategic influence of Russia and this is a 
negative factor. Nantoi criticized the government coalition of 
the Agrarians and Socialists. "In my opinion, Moldovan people 
chose on February 27th the liquidation of independence," said 
Nantoi. 
  Romanian Presidential Counselor on relations with Moldova, 
Ion Netelea, stated during the conference that the Romanian 
Government does not seek unification of the historic Romanian 
territories. Nonetheless, Netelea emphasized that Bucharest 
treats the events in 1940 as a territorial usurpation. 
"Moldova's economic policy leans mainly on Russia. Romania by 
no means intends to eliminate Russia from the Moldovan economy 
in order to take its place. However, we would like Moldova to 
have the choice to have as many options in the West as in the 
East," stated Netelea. 
  Deputy chairman of the Euro-Atlantic Centre, Vadim Malakhov, 
made a report on the parallels between the Dniester and Crimean 
conflicts. According to Malakhov, the same structures for 
setting up a break-away region were employed in Crimea as in 
Dniester. Malakhov emphasized that the creation of autonomous 
judicial organs in Crimea is alarming, as it should lead to a 
military conflict. 
  Nicolae Turtureanu, of the Moldovan Defence Ministry, stated 
that although Russia plays a negative role in the conflicts in 
the former USSR, it cannot be eliminated from the collective 
security system. "It would be better if a unique Euro-Asian 
security system would be created in the future," added 
Turtureanu.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Demidetskiy] </F>
  [Text] Chisinau May 30 TASS -- The leader of the Federation 
of Independent Unions of Moldavia, Serafim Yrekyan, warned Prime 
Minister Andrei Sangheli about the possibility of mass protest 
actions as a result of the republic's extremely difficult 
economic situation. 
  The union leader said the mass protests might occur despite 
the six-month moratorium on strikes which was announced by the 
labour unions in order to give the new government the chance to 
undertake measures to overcome the crisis. The problem is that 
several unions which are hostile to the Cabinet of Ministers did 
not agree with the general decision on the moratorium. 
  The conditions are more than ripe for exciting mass unrest 
in 
Moldavia. According to the labour unions, the physical 
subsistence minimum (in May prices) is 133 lei (30 U.S. dollars) 
per month. The minimum consumer's basket, which includes 
several industrial goods in addition to the necessary food 
products, is now around 260 lei. If one compares this with the 
average monthly wage in Moldovia of about 82 lei, one can 
understand the reasons for dissatisfaction. Pensioners have it 
even worse, since the average fixed pension is only 18.8 lei per 
month. 
  But even these crumbs are not received by the population 
regularly. Following the advice of the International Monetary 
Fund, the Moldavian Government is implementing a fairly strict 
financial and credit policy and sharply limiting the currency 
supply. In light of the continuing decline in production, this 
policy has led to systematic delays in the distribution of 
salaries and pensions. 
  According to the statistics department, the government 
already owes its people about 80 million lei (20 million 
dollars). Of that sum, more than 60 million lei have not been 
given to agricultural workers, who form the backbone of the 
Moldavian economy. Experts say that these debts account for 
more than half of the salaries earned by Moldavia's four-million 
strong population in the first quarter of this year. 
  Due to fears of a social eruption, the government has had to 
put off a price increase on communal services (heating, 
electricity) three times. Local authorities would like to raise 
these prices in response to the fact that energy prices are 
constantly on the rise. The Cabinet of Ministers is now holding 
negotiations with the labour union leaders and entrepreneurs in 
the hopes of letting the steam out of the situation.

  [Text] Here is a statement by the Supreme Kenges of the 
Republic of Kazakhstan: 
  Recognizing that there is no alternative to the 
comprehensive 
reform of social relations, the state, and the economy and 
expressing readiness for a constructive dialogue with the 
president, the executive branch, and the judicial powers and 
wishing to achieve a compromise and consensus between various 
political forces which reflect the social and national interests 
of citizens of the republic, and noting that the government, 
having declared a course toward the market economy, in fact 
impedes and blocks it, and this has led to an economic chaos, 
the Supreme Kenges adopts this statement as a basis for its 
immediate work. 
  The government has failed to work out a national reform 
program which could have become a basis for the consolidation of 
society. This made the constructive interaction of the branches 
of power impossible. It also made it impossible to carry out an 
integral and logically complete legislative policy. In this 
connection the democratically elected Supreme Kenges, reflecting 
the will of the majority of voters expressed by the latter 
during many preelection meetings, must express a lack of 
confidence in the government's social, economic, and legal 
policy. 
  In this situation the only possibility of avoiding a 
complete 
paralysis of power is to hold constructive dialogue between all 
of its branches, and with social and political forces in order 
to set up a national program of reform and to form a government 
capable of fulfilling this program. Before the adoption of an 
agreed program, the Supreme Kenges must focus its attention on 
the following issues: 
  First, examination of the president's decrees adopted in 
absentia of the legislative body of power. 
  Second, implementation of the budget and confirmation of the 
current fiscal year budget. 
  Third, implementation of the control function. 
  Fourth, international agreement subject to ratification. 
  Fifth, expansion and strengthening of interparliamentary 
relations. 
  Sixth, examination of laws adopted in the first reading by 
the Supreme Kenges of the 12th convocation and returned by the 
president for reexamination. 
  The Supreme Kenges considers as a priority the task of 
immediate and maximum possible protection of the population, the 
more accurate targetting and efficiency of this protection. The 
Supreme Kenges intends to take a number of legal measures in 
order resolutely to protect the producers of goods, to restrict 
by law the authority of the executive power over state property, 
to expand the independence of enterprises of all forms of 
ownership. These measures are necessary only to decrease the 
consequences of the crisis for the population and the economy, 
to remove the lack of a systematic approach to law making which 
is harming the state, and to ensure stability for law making in 
the Republic of Kazakhstan. 
  The Supreme Kenges expresses its hope of agreement between 
the branches of power and social and political forces. The 
Supreme Kenges proposes immediately to begin consultations 
between representatives of the president, the Supreme Kenges, 
and other state organs, political parties, and other social 
associations in order to work out conditions of work on a 
concerted program of reform.

  [Text] The press service of the Cabinet of Ministers 
released a statement for the media. The statement says: 
  The government shares the anxiety concerning the social and 
economic situation in the republic which was expressed in the 
Supreme Kenges statement of 27 May 1994. At the same time the 
policy of expressing no confidence in the government, in fact, 
is not constitutional. 
  In accordance with our main law [the Constitution] the 
Cabinet of Ministers is answerable to the president of the 
republic. The government hoped that the Supreme Kenges statement 
would contribute to constructive dialogue between the government 
and the executive. However, unfortunately one can trace in the 
statement some slogan-type pronouncements which are rooted in 
the emotions and passions of the recent election campaign. 
  In the present social and economic situation a painful 
transition period is unavoidable but the necessary prerequisites 
have not shaped themselves in our country yet to overcome it. 
  The government acted in conformity with the anticrisis 
program suggested by the Supreme Kenges. Structural changes of 
the economy are under way: the conversion of defense 
enterprises, the development of entrepreneurship. Under the 
most severe crisis of nonpayments the government has written-off 
the debts of republican enterprises. The sowing campaign is 
nearing its end. Under the present difficulties farmers have 
managed to sow grain on an area of 15 million hectares, they 
(?are trying) to observe the deadline of the potato and 
vegetable sowing campaign [word indistinct]. 
  The government has submitted about 60 draft laws to the 
Supreme Kenges on urgent and topical issues of economic reform 
-- strengthenning [word indistinct], law and order, and others. 
Adoption of these and other documents could have made it 
possible to improve the legal basis of the reform, to increase 
purpose- orientated social protection of the population. 
  The government calls on the Supreme Kenges to carry out its 
constitutional prerogatives -- to pass laws -- as well as [word 
indistinct] in order to preserve political stability, 
interethnic accord, and strengthenning Kazakhstan's prestige on 
the international arena.

  [Text] Almaty May 27 TASS -- Kazakh Parliament has given a 
vote of no confidence to the government's socio-economic and 
legal policies. 
  The lawmakers resumed discussing the statement "on 
governmental policies," which was earlier submitted by a group 
of 42 deputies, at the morning plenary session. The statement 
has been discussed by the lawmakers to no avail for a week, 
because many of them opposed the extremely sharp criticisms of 
the cabinet contained in the statement. 
  Today, however, majority of lawmakers (96 out of 177) came 
out in favour of the statement, the wording of which has been 
finalized by the parliamentary committees. 
  First, leaders of the parliamentary committees, leaders of 
the four political factions which were legalized yesterday, and 
several legislators, who had signed the statement, took the 
floor. 
  Next, a coordinating editing commission was formed to 
finalize the wording of the statement. It brought together 
representatives of all committees, factions and the initiators' 
group. Deputy parliament speaker Marat Ospanov chaired the 
commission. 
  At the evening plenary session, the legislators gave a vote 
of no confidence to the socio-economic and legal policies of the 
government.

  [Text] An expanded session of the Cabinet of Ministers 
chaired by Prime Minister Sergey Tereshchenko was held on 30 May 
with the participation of the heads of republican departments 
and deputy heads of oblast administrations and the 
administrations of Almaty and Leninsk. 
  After listening to a report by Finance Minister Yerkeshbay 
Derbisov, the session examined the updated state budget for 
1994. Since the beginning of this year, as is known, the 
republic has lived according to the budget endorsed in January 
by the decree of the president of Kazakhstan in the absence of 
the legislature. This period in the life of society, linked 
with a deepened economic crisis, has objectively led to a new 
spiral of inflation, and additional measures are now needed to 
curb the inflation. 
  The draft updated budget which will be submitted to the 
Supreme Kenges of the new convocation is characterized by a 
strict financial concept. The budget envisages a deficit not 
higher than 4 percent. This corresponds to the norms of the 
international financial banking organizations. 
  During the discussion on the budget, proposals were voiced 
to 
support the basic industries, the development of entrepreneurial 
structures, acceleration of market reform, and also to increase 
social protection for low-income groups. 
  Vice President Yerik Asanbayev and Supreme Kenges Deputy 
Chairman Marat Ospanov took part in the session.

  [Text] Vice President Yerik Asanbayev received yesterday 
Giorgio Giacomelli, UN deputy secretary general and executive 
director of the UN fund for drug abuse. Under discussion was 
the issue of combatting drug smuggling. Giorgio Giacomelli said 
new sovereign states that appeared on the world's map after the 
break-up of the USSR are now turning into drug dealing centers. 
They also discussed the UN policy with regard to this issue. 
The vice president spoke about Kazakhstan's vision of its 
participation in the UN programme. Yerik Asanbayev emphasized 
that drug smuggling has to be addressed urgently. He said 
Kazakhstan has turned into a drug trading centers, but does not 
have the equipment and experts to combat it. Therefore 
Kazakhstan would be grateful for any assistance that could be 
rendered to it by international organizations. This year 
Kazakhstan plans to send its envoy to Vienna who will be dealing 
with this issue. Kazakhstan is willing to cooperate with the 
United Nations in tackling this issue.

<F P=106> [Oleg Panfilov report in the "Tajikistan" column: "The </F>
Opening of Talks Has Been Postponed by Three Days. Will a 
Cease- Fire Agreement Be Signed?"] 
  [Excerpts] As NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's correspondent has 
learned, the second round of talks between the government 
delegation and Tajik opposition, scheduled to be held in Tehran, 
has been postponed by three days. This is due to the fact that 
Iranian Foreign Minister Velayati will not be able to 
participate in the official opening ceremony until 7 June. 
[passage omitted] 
  The Tajik-Afghan border remains the most unquiet place. And 
although the Islamic Revival Movement has repeatedly assured 
that its actions are not aimed against Russian frontier guards, 
the peacekeeping force command is constantly reinforcing its 
units. In this context the INTERFAX report that peacekeeping 
force commander Col.-Gen. Patrikeyev had excluded Tajikistan 
armed forces from the "peacekeepers" contingent was rather 
unexpected. On one hand, Tajik Defense Ministry units are not 
numerous and do not have influence in the coalition forces. 
Their participation in the "peacekeeping" mission was all the 
more strange because the Dushanbe regime is in a state of civil 
war with the opposition. On the other hand, government troops, 
regularly supplied with arms and ammunition, can now conduct 
operations independently, without exposing the Russian 201st 
Division. 
  In any event these reshuffles will hardly change the 
military's attitude to the political situation in Tajikistan 
even though in the past six months the opposition has stated on 
several occasions that it is not against the Russian military 
presence in Tajikistan. 
  It is also possible that a new peacekeeping force commander 
will not be just as straightforward as Boris Pyankov who 
presented the opposition with an ultimatum this spring, which 
was apparently a deliberate action, seen by the opposition as 
interference in Tajikistan's affairs. This apparently 
conditioned the government delegation's behavior at the first 
round of negotiations in Moscow when it refused to sign a formal 
cease-fire agreement proposed by the opposition (this, 
incidentally, confirms the truth long understood by political 
scientists and experts: The war against the opposition is not 
being waged by the Dushanbe regime). At preparatory meetings 
before the second round the opposition delegation is again 
preparing a proposal on a cease-fire on the Tajik-Afghan border 
which is regarded with understanding among Russian diplomats.

  [Text] Dushanbe, 27 May -- "The purpose of my visit to 
Tajikistan is to have talks with the republican leadership on 
further steps by the UN with regard to participating in finding 
a settlement to the inter-Tajik conflict," Marrack Goulding, UN 
under secretary general for political questions, told a group of 
Russian correspondents on arrival in Dushanbe. The second round 
of inter- Tajik talks, he said, is due to take place in Tehran 
on 7 June. 
  Asked by a correspondent if the question on enhancing the 
status of the Dushanbe official delegation at the talks would be 
raised during the meetings, Marrack Goulding stressed that he 
would not like to go into details at this moment. He promised 
to speak in detail about the results of his meetings with the 
Tajik leadership, including his meeting with Emomali Rahmonov, 
at a news conference. 
  Marrack Goulding reaffirmed that he is bringing with him a 
note from UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali for Emomali 
Rahmonov, chairman of the Tajik Supreme Soviet. However, he 
said, he would not wish to reveal the contents of this note just 
now. 
  A meeting will take place today between Marrack Goulding and 
Tajik Foreign Minister Rashid Alimov, Labor and Employment 
Minister Shukur Zukhurov, and Security Minister Said Amir 
Zukhurov. During his visit the UN under secretary general will 
be received by Tajik Premier Abdulmadjid Samadov.

  [Text] Singapore, 30 May (ITAR-TASS) -- Turkmenistan and 
Malaysia have today signed five agreements on trade and economic 
cooperation, scientific and technical cooperation, visa 
arrangements for travel, and mutual debt payment. 
Turkmenistan's President Saparmurad Niyazov, who is paying an 
official visit to Kuala Lumpur, and the Malaysian Prime minister 
Mahathir bin Mohamad, were present at the signing ceremony. 
  According to an official spokesman of the Malaysian Foreign 
Ministry, Mahathir bin Mohamad promised his Turkmen guest to 
share experience in the sphere of privatizing state-owned 
enterprises and implementing economic reforms. Turkmenistani 
nationals will study banking in Malaysia. The visitors also 
said they would be interested to learn from Malaysians how to 
set up free economic zones. 
  Giving a speech today at the National Chamber of Trade and 
Commerce, Niyazov called upon the Malaysians to step up their 
investment in the branches of industry that are actively 
developing in Turkmenistan, such as the oil and gas industry, 
tourism, and others.

  [Text] Commander-in-Chief of the Defence Forces General 
Aleksander Einseln has been surprised by claims of an alleged 
Estonian-Israeli military cooperation project. Einseln referred 
to a confidential letter by Kristian Garancis, aid of Leonid 
Apananski, to GHQ [general headquarters] chief Colonel Sirel. 
Apananski mediated the weapons deal with Israel and the letter 
mentioned a joint project launched by Prime Minister Mart Laar 
and Israeli General Dan Shomron. 
  General Einseln pointed out in a letter to Prime Minister 
Laar that defence projects should be coordinated with the 
military leadership and required about Apananski's powers to 
deal with defence issues. Laar assured the general that no 
cooperation projects had been signed and referred to defence and 
interior ministers as better acquainted with the subject. 
Government advisor Jaan Tross denied the existence of any 
cooperation plan. 
  General Einseln also criticised the inefficiency of the 
Defence Ministry and the frequent replacement of ministers. "I 
have been in office less than 13 months and this is the fourth 
minister already," he pointed out.

  [Text] Tallinn, May 30, BNS -- The commander in chief of 
Estonia's Armed Forces is seeking clarity over allegations that 
Prime Minister Mart Laar has bypassed him in steps toward a 
defense cooperation plan with Israel, the POSTIMEES daily 
newspaper reported today. 
  Major General Aleksander Einseln earlier this month had 
asked 
Laar's explanation for information provided to a Central Staff 
official in a confidential letter by an aide to Leonid 
Apananski, considered a key figure in the country's major arms 
purchase deal with Israel, POSTIMEES reports. 
  Apananski's aide in the letter from May 16 had informed 
Central Staff Colonel Arvo Sirel about a May 10-12 visit to 
Tallinn of an Israeli delegation over, as the letter puts it, a 
cooperation project started by Mart Laar and Israeli General Dan 
Shamron. 
  "The work group participated together with their Estonian 
colleagues from the Interior Ministry, police and the Defense 
Ministry in a joint seminar for resolving the issues related to 
the country's interior and outside security," the letter reads. 
The discussions had also been about the defense concept and 
doctrine, the Apananski aide said. 
  Einseln in his letter to the prime minister on the dame day 
[as received], May 16, asked why Laar was dealing with security 
issues without coordinating his activity with the head of the 
Armed Forces. 
  The commander in chief asked a written explanation from the 
prime minister on the allegedly existing cooperation project 
started by Laar and General Shamron and what were the 
authorities granted to Apananski, a private businessman, for 
dealing with issues of state defense. 
  Laar in his answer on the following day stated that the 
government had signed no cooperation projects with General 
Shamron. He also denied any powers granted to Apananski over 
state defense, and added Einseln should ask for information from 
Defense Minister Indrek Kannik, by now resigned, or Interior 
Minister Heiki Arike. 
  Einseln in his interview with POSTIMEES said he was not 
satisfied with the prime minister's answer who, he said, was not 
completely denying that something was going on, but had referred 
the answer to other ministers. 
  He added that he hadn't still received the answers to his 
May 
23 letters to the defense and interior ministers. 
  The commander in chief said he was going to continue seeking 
clarity over the issue, as he still didn't know whether plans 
for the defense cooperation really existed. He said that if 
something was going on, "such things must not be done without my 
approval, agreement." 
  Einseln also said that if the government has decided to act 
without informing him, it must also start looking for a new army 
chief.

  [Text] Russian military experts monitoring the 
dismantlement of two naval nuclear reactors at Paldiski, Estonia 
will leave it by August 31, when the last Russian troops 
withdraw from Estonia. 
  Reporting this in the National Assembly on Monday, Estonia's 
Foreign Minister Juri Luik explained that the operation would 
subsequently be controlled by Estonian specialists and estimated 
the cost of dismantling the reactors at this former USSR naval 
base 30 kilometers west of Tallinn at about 10 million dollars. 
  The money is expected to be raised through donations from 
various international sources. 
  But so far only five million dollars have come mainly from 
U.S. the Estonian side, Luik said, is ready to pay only for 
organizing dosimetric control, conducting rescue work in 
emergencies, and maintaining law and order in areas close to the 
nuclear facilities. In Luik's opinion, Russia is to compensate 
for the 8 million krons spent by Estonia to lay a special 7 
kilometer rail track to evacuate the reactors.

  [Text] President Ulmanis said today that the principle of 
preventive diplomacy is a characteristic feature of the process 
of concluding Latvian-Russian agreements on army withdrawal. 
His remarks came at a news conference covering Ulmanis's recent 
trip to the United States. He emphasized that the principle of 
preventive diplomacy has now been put forward at the UN as the 
corner stone of activity, because with its help it is possible 
to tackle many issues in the world. 
  UN Secretary-General Butrus Ghali, meeting with Ulmanis, 
promised to render UN assistance in the process of setting up 
the Baltic peacekeeping battalion by providing specialist 
training. 
  Ulmanis noted that protection of individual rights rather 
than states rights is currently being given more emphasis at the 
UN at this time.

  [Text] Riga, May 27 (LETA) -- A delegation of the Romanian 
Government arrived on Thursday [26 May] in Riga to sign a 
cooperation agreement on trade and economy between the 
governments of the two countries. The delegation included 
officials of the Trade Ministry and the adviser on economics of 
the Romanian Embassy in Lithuania, Dan Tiron, who is also a 
trade representative of Romania in Estonia and Latvia. The 
agreement was signed on Friday in the Foreign Ministry. 
  The previous years were marked by a sensible decrease of 
barter between the two countries which makes up only some 
several hundred thousands lats. The new deal provides the most 
favoured nation treatment in trade between both countries. It 
means a remarkable reduction of rates of duties from both sides. 
According to the forecast by the state Minister of Foreign 
Trade and E.U. Affairs, Olgerts Pavlovskis, Romanian footwear, 
clothes, fruits, wine and other goods will again become 
accessible in Latvia soon.

  [Text] Riga, May 28, BNS -- The national budget shortfall 
hit 12.88 million lats in the first four months of this year, 
Budget Minister Janis Platais told reporters Friday [27 May]. 
  Between January and April, the budget earned 164.634 million 
lats, or 29.6 percent of the year's planned revenues, and spent 
174.672 million lats, or 29.4 percent of the year's planned 
expenditure. 
  The spendings exceeded incomes 10.04 million lats and the 
state treasury working capital increased 2.84 million lats. 
  The consequent deficit is covered with 11.68 million lats in 
state treasury borrowings and 1.2 million lats in the Bank of 
Latvia credits. 
  In April, incomes exceeded spendings 2.183 million lats what 
resulted in the reduction of the budget deficit from 12.22 
million lats to 10.04 million lats, Platais said. 
  The most successfull is the collection of sales, customs, 
income and social taxes. The collection of profit taxes takes 
place with difficulties, Platais noted. 
  The debts for payments to the state budget have remained 
large because the majority of state-run enterprises faces 
economic hardships and their financial problems are unlikely to 
be resolved in the near future, the minister said. 
  On May 1, taxpayers owed 27.288 million lats to the state 
budget. Compared with April, the amount of the debts increased 
582,000 lats. 
  From the total, 13,666,400 lats are debts for failed sales 
tax payments, 11,295,200 lats -- for unpaid profit taxes and 
1,092,600 lats -- excise tax arrears. 
  Platais mentioned JS Dauteks, state-operated RER enterprise 
and JS Recept-Holding as the largest debtors to the state budget. 
  These enterprises blame their problems on their debtors and 
the problematic sales of products. 
  The fluctuation of the unconvertible currency rates against 
the lat cause additional problems because the bulk of these 
enterprise's products are sold on the Eastern market. 
  Platais also informed reporters that the wages of state 
budget employees would be raised to 28 lats per month in October.

  [Text] Riga, May 27, BNS -- The Latvian Saeima 
(parliament) ruling coalition partners, Latvia's Way and 
Farmers' Union, reached an agreement Friday [27 May] on a common 
version of the draft citizenship law. 
  The draft represents an optimal version, which took into 
account both Council of Europe's recommendations and right-wing 
opposition's proposals, said Latvia's Way faction Chairman 
Andrejs Pantelejevs. 
  Under the bill, non-citizens are naturalized in accordance 
with a complicated system of quotas that grants the citizenship 
only to those who have de facto integrated into the Latvian 
society. 
  The bill stipulates preferential naturalization of persons 
at 
least one parent of whose is ethnic Latvian; persons who legally 
came to Latvia and lived there before June 17, 1940; Lithuanian 
and Estonian ethnic minorities; spouses of Latvian citizens who 
have been married for at least 10 years. All these groups, 
however, should know the Latvian language. 
  The bill introduces one more category of persons for 
preferential naturalization -- those who have finished full high 
school course in Latvian. 
  The rest are free to apply for naturalization starting with 
Jan. 1, 1996. From those, preference is given to persons who 
were born in Latvia. 
  Starting with year 2000, persons who do not fall into any of 
the above mentioned groups will be naturalized in compliance 
with naturalization quota 0.1 percent of the body of Latvian 
citizens per year. 
  Pantelejevs prognosticates that the real preferential 
naturalization will begin Jan. 1, 1995, because the 
naturalization mechanism is not complete yet. During this 
stage, 150,000 persons could be granted the Latvian citizenship, 
he said. 
  Latvian citizenship will not be granted to persons who have 
been by court recognized as having propagated the ideas of 
chauvinism, nationalism and fascism, as well as actively worked 
against the Latvian independence. 
  In addition, citizenship will not be given to former Soviet 
military retirees, who have chosen Latvia as permanent residence 
country. This restriction, however, does not refer to ethnic 
Latvians and spouses of Latvian citizens. 
  Pantelejevs acknowledged that this version was more radical 
than required in CE [Council of Europe] recommendations but he 
said it gives citizen candidates a clear view of their future 
prospects. 
  If the citizenship law is adopted in the Saeima spring 
session, CE could consider the issue of Latvia's acceptance in 
its fall session. 
  Pantelejevs forecasts that the bill would be considered in 
the second reading in the parliament on June 9. Pantelejevs 
said he hoped that the opposition would not block the law's 
adoption.

    [Editorial Report] Moscow Mayak Radio Network in Russian at 
0430 GMT on 31 May carries a 4-minute report by correspondent 
Innart Skunj from Riga on some preliminary results of the local 
elections in Latvia. 
  Skunj says: "About 60 percent of voters have taken part in 
them. Rural areas had a better turnout, while in Riga the 
turnout was just over 50 percent. In the opinion of 
international and local observers, there have been no serious 
violations at the elections." 
  He says further: "In rural areas, the Latvian Peasants 
Association and the Latvian National independence Movement will 
receive the majority of mandates. In Riga, the opposition to 
the present government and to the majority in the Seimas have 
come to power, namely united national forces -- the Latvian 
National Independence Movement, the For the Fatherland and 
Freedom, the People's Front, the Christian Union, and the 
Latvian Peasants Association. They received 52 percent of 
votes, and they have received 32 mandates out of 60 seats. This 
bloc will name their representatives on Friday."

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- The death of an employee at the 
Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and his 
wife during a holiday in Libya has still not been cleared up. 
The case was discussed by the Bundestag Parliamentary Control 
Commission (PKK) today, its chairman Johannes Gerster said 
afterwards. The German Government has briefed the Commission 
about the "brutal" circumstances surrounding the death of the 
two Germans. The Control Commission strongly criticized the 
fact that the Libyan Government has still not complied with a 
German Government demand that the incident be completely cleared 
up with a comprehensive report. 
  According to press reports, the employee was a section 
leader 
in Department VI of the Cologne-based Office for the Protection 
of the Constitution, a department which deals with extremist 
acts by foreigners and international terrorism. He is said to 
have died in a military hospital in Tripoli in mid-April. 
According to the reports, the "Middle East and North African 
expert" had a holiday trip to Egypt authorized by his employers. 
There was a ban on travel to Libya at the Office for the 
Protection of the Constitution.

    [Editorial Report] Mainz SAT-1 Television Network in 
German at 2010 GMT on 25 April carries a recorded 60-minute 
program with Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl entitled "Let's Get 
Down to Business, Chancellor." Guests in the SAT-1 studio in 
Mainz and people in the main square of the east German city of 
Wernigerode, Saxony-Anhalt, who also participated live in the 
program, ask the chancellor questions on topical issues. 
  After being asked by the SAT-1 moderator Heinz Klaus Mertes 
on how he feels, to which Kohl says that he is very well, the 
chancellor talks about the many upcoming international meetings. 
Kohl says that, at the moment, he was making efforts to ensure 
that "the majority of the European Parliament" will approve of 
the acceptance of the four EFTA [European Free Trade 
Association] countries into the European Union. 
  Bundeswehr Lieutenant Jochen Michels in the studio asks Kohl 
about planned Bundeswehr cuts, and the differences between 
Defense Minister Volker Ruehe, who has called for reducing the 
Bundeswehr strength to 340,000, and Foreign Minister Kinkel, who 
would rather leave the level at 370,000. Kohl says there are no 
"real differences" between Ruehe and Kinkel's views on the issue 
and sees "no major problem" in the coalition. Confronted with 
the reduced figures for Bundeswehr spending by the lieutenant, 
Kohl says "we cannot spend more than we have." The chancellor 
emphasizes that the Bundeswehr's tasks have "changed in a 
changed world," that more money is needed for the new tasks, and 
that the country's external and internal security must be 
ensured. Kohl says he has always been an "advocate" of the 
Bundeswehr, had "great sympathy" for the soldiers, and that "the 
soldiers will get what they need." 
  The moderator then raises the issue of unemployment, with 
figures standing at almost 4 million unemployed at the moment. 
Juergen Grandisch, a member of the works council of an aircraft 
engines company at Limbach, criticizes the government's lack of 
concept for preventive measures against unemployment. Kohl 
contradicts: "I deny that altogether," and points to the 
"millions of new jobs" that have been created since he took 
power 12 years ago. He argues that current economic problems 
are partly the result of the loss of jobs in eastern Germany in 
the wake of unification-related changes. He points out that the 
"industrial base of the new laender has broken away" mainly as a 
result of the disappearance of the markets in the former Soviet 
Union. Kohl cites the example of a train car company in eastern 
Germany that was the "dominant producer" in the entire former 
East Bloc. 
  In the main square of Wernigerode, Heiko Dietz, unemployed, 
voices his doubts about the economic upswing in the east and the 
promised jobs. Kohl says that it "cannot be denied" that the 
economic recovery is in "full swing." As far as the housing 
situation is concerned, Kohl says we "will build 100,000 
apartments" in eastern Germany this year, more than ever before. 
Kohl adds that "thank God, unemployment has begun to stagnate." 
Kohl points to the higher economic growth in eastern Germany. 
The unemployed man insists that this is not true, and is 
invited by Kohl to accompany him on one of his regular trips 
through the new laender where he would show him that "things are 
improving slowly but surely." 
  To a baker, who complains about investment problems in the 
new laender, Kohl says that this is a structural problem as 
"medium-sized enterprises" were "neglected" in the "40 years of 
the Socialist Unity Party of Germany [SED] regime." 
  Back in the studio in Mainz, Peter Darter, a member of the 
works council of Mercedes-Benz, criticizes Kohl's job balance, 
saying that 4 million unemployed are 3.9 million too many. When 
he mentions the 1,500 jobs that were cut at Mercedes last year, 
and the 1,000 that might have to go in 1994, Kohl says that "the 
jobs in industry" cannot be seen as the "main responsibility of 
the federal chancellor." He complains that whenever things go 
well, the company managements claim all the credit, while they 
blame politics when things go badly. Kohl points once more to 
the high amount of public holidays and vacation in Germany, 
something "unparalleled" in any other country. 
  The next person to ask a question is Rudolf Koschorz, a 
member of the works council of a chemical enterprise. Koschorz 
complains about the lengthy licensings periods in his industry 
-- 22 months in Germany, compared to only 22 weeks in France. 
Kohl says that these periods are indeed "absurdly long." 
  Kaethe Lindner, a businesswoman from eastern Germany, took 
over her parent's company in 1990, and even increased the work 
force from 38 to 50 since then. Still, she would wish for an 
economic program for the small- and medium-sized enterprises, 
pointing out that higher equity capital could immediately create 
jobs there. Kohl does not answer Lindner's question directly, 
but says "I can only congratulate you on your personal 
attitude." He gives assurances that, "within a few years" the 
new laender will be "among the best economic centers in Europe." 
  Dirk von Gehlen, a student, who will graduate from high 
school this summer, asks Kohl what he would train in if he were 
the student's age to have a secure future. Without giving a 
concrete answer, Kohl says that when he graduated from school in 
1950, the situation was "quite difficult," too. He tells the 
young man that "you belong to the luckiest generation of Germans 
within living memory." Kohl adds, that "in all probability, you 
will not have to experience war and you will be able to enjoy 
peace as long as you live." Kohl says that things might be 
difficult now, but that the young man still has his "entire 
life" ahead of him. 
  Ina Regel, an apprentice goldsmith, asks Kohl how the image 
of nonacademic jobs can be improved. Kohl says that he believes 
that the young woman will have "excellent job opportunities." 
Kohl notes that the traditional differentiation in Germany 
between academics and nonacademics is "stupid." He argues that 
"it depends on what a woman or a man achieves, and on her or his 
character" and not on the certificates they hold. 
  Moderator Mertes shows several charts on income 
developments in eastern and western Germany since 1990, noting 
that real incomes in western Germany have fallen by about 1 
percent, whereas in the new laender incomes in real terms are up 
6.1 percent. Comparing the tax burden, Mertes says that of 1 
German mark [DM] earned, 40 pfennigs had to be paid in taxes in 
1990, while in 1994 it is 46 pfennigs. 
  Back at the Wernigerode main square, a home owner criticizes 
the strong increase of taxes and local rates, pointing out that 
many people are forced to sell their homes. Kohl emphasizes the 
importance of maintaining private property, saying that "of 
course, I am banking on private property." Kohl argues that a 
great amount of repair work in eastern communities is simply 
costing a lot of money and that house owners have to "pay" their 
"share." Kohl points to the large transfer payments to eastern 
Germany, "almost DM150 billion" a year, and that this huge 
amount has to be earned "somewhere." He cannot promise tax 
cuts, but notes that "I am strongly in favor of reducing taxes 
as soon as we will have overcome the worst." Yet, "at the 
moment we need this money." 
  A young mother asks why women with children are facing so 
many obstacles when they want to go back to their jobs, and what 
Kohl intends to do about it. Kohl defends companies, saying 
that most of them treat returning mothers "fairly." He states: 
"I deny" that women are in general forced to do less qualified 
jobs "once they return after maternity leave." 
  Mr. Treisbach, a pensioner, complains about the pension 
regulations introduced after unification. Kohl says that 
compared to the DM400-600 the man received in the GDR and the 
1,400 he is getting now, there is a "big difference," and that 
pensions are about to be increased soon, anyway. 
  Back in the studio in Mainz, Mertes asks Kohl whether the 
Germans were maybe complaining too much. Kohl says that when 
people in eastern Germany are asked how they are now compared to 
before, "two-thirds" will say that they personally are much 
better off now, but that "the country is much worse off." The 
chancellor blames the media for creating this atmosphere, noting 
that the "lousy mood" of many is "false and hypocritical." 
"Abroad, not a single person" can understand all those 
complaints in Germany. 
  Asked about the tax burden and the planned solidarity 
surcharge by Mertes, Kohl says that he is absolutely in favor of 
phasing out the solidarity surcharge "at the earliest possible 
time" but adds that "I strictly reject" mentioning a year 
because "I will never again be accused of a tax lie." In the 
election campaign he will tell people that "we need this money 
now" and that we will reduce taxes "as soon as we will have 
overcome the worst," Kohl said. "We want peace, we want 
freedom, we want social security, we want a modern 
infrastructure" and "all that cannot be had for free." 
  Joerg Asmussen, a student of economics, asks Kohl whether 
the 
European currency will be introduced by 1997 or 1999, or even 
later. Kohl says that "we can replace the German mark only by a 
common European currency, a Euromark, that is as stable and as 
hard as the German mark." Kohl says that "this is a 
precondition under the Maastricht Treaty." If this should not 
be the case at the deadline the student mentioned, it would "not 
be a disaster." It will only be put off for a few years, 
because "we are fully under way on our path toward European 
integration." Kohl emphasizes again that "I am not ready to 
exchange the German mark for a European currency that does not 
have the same qualification or the same quality -- that is the 
important thing." 
  Asked by the student whether he would like to succeed 
Jacques 
Delors as president of the European Commission, Kohl says "no, I 
am not crazy to take on such a burden now." He notes that "I 
want to become federal chancellor again." 
  Thomas Suewelack, a chocolate producer, complains about 
bureaucracy in Germany. "Despite the irritation, which I am 
feeling myself at times," Kohl emphasizes that he is in favor of 
compliance with regulations, something that has contributed to 
Germany's high competitiveness and good reputation. 
  The moderator asks Kohl to ask the people in Wernigerode a 
question, and Kohl investigates whether five years ago they 
thought that German unity would be achieved so quickly. Two 
women say that nobody would have expected it five years ago. A 
man stresses: We have achieved freedom through our own fight. 
Kohl calls for modesty saying "that you and I would not have 
achieved anything, unless Gorbachev, and U.S. President George 
Bush had said yes to German unity. They were the two most 
important men." Kohl adds that "the Germans themselves have 
also contributed to it, both in the GDR and the FRG." Hinting 
to the Bundeswehr officer in the studio, Kohl emphasizes that 
without "many of those who risked a lot in the era of the Cold 
War and the arms race and stabilized NATO, German unity would 
not have been achieved either." 
  At the end of the program, the moderator asks Kohl whether, 
right now, he is proud of being a German. Kohl says: "I have 
always been proud. Why should I not be proud of being a German. 
After all, my pride has nothing to do with disassociating 
myself from others. You know this is a typically German 
question. If you asked this question of a French politician he 
would look at you with bewilderment." 
  Mertes then asks the final question, about Kohl's dream of 
Germany. Kohl answers: "A reunited Germany in a united Europe; 
a Germany, which after the terrible experience of the first half 
of the century, including two world wars, Nazi barbarism, the 
bitter experience of a communist regime in one part of Germany, 
the GDR, that is now making contributions to peace. What I most 
appreciate almost every week, is when I have visitors from 
abroad, who say that the Germans have really become different: 
They help, they are open. And I think that this is good."

<F P=106> [Speech by Economics Affairs Minister Guenther Rexrodt in </F>
the Bundestag in Bonn, in a debate on the spring report of six 
leading German economic research institutes; broadcast in 
progress -- live] 
  [Excerpts] ...points to the fact that we are on the right 
track with our economic policy [applause]. The predictions 
submitted by five of the six institutes are at the upper limit 
of the margin predicted by the government in January. You, 
Professor Jens, ought really to show some remorse here and 
clearly distance yourself from your polemical remarks which were 
marked by little economic understanding. 
  We have the chance that actual growth this year could turn 
out to be even higher than predicted in the institutes' report. 
The current economic indicators, and I would ask you to take a 
look at them, point to a tangible improvement in the overall 
economic situation. Business expectations in west German 
industry, an important early indicator of future economic 
developments, have improved substantially, as IFO [Institute for 
Economic Research] shows. 
  In the autumn of 1992 pessimistic responses outnumbered 
optimistic responses by 42; today the positive expectations 
outnumber the negative by eight. Incoming orders in the 
manufacturing sector were 2.5 percent higher in real terms 
during the first two months of this year than the same period a 
year ago. Incoming orders from abroad have risen 9 percent in 
real terms. At the same time, the construction sector has 
recorded an increase in orders of 8.5 percent, and housing 
construction registered growth of no less than 30 percent. 
Exports during January and February rose 2.5 percent compared 
with the same period last year, and industrial capacity 
utilization has been increasing tangibly since the third quarter 
of last year. 
  In all, gross domestic product is likely to be substantially 
higher during the first quarter of 1994 than over the same 
period last year. Permit me to say with regard to eastern 
Germany, I can only advise the ladies and gentlemen of the 
opposition to gain an impression at first hand of the 
determination with which people are tackling things there. 
Statistics give only an abstract picture. The real picture is 
positive. Construction orders have risen 37 percent, and by 85 
percent in housing construction. Building activity overall is 
up 20 percent. [passage omitted: Social Democratic Party Deputy 
Uwe Jens criticizes earlier predictions and says unemployment 
will continue to increase] 
  I cannot agree with you, let me say that straight away. But 
your prayer wheel-like comments about poor economic prospects 
are refuted by the facts I have just described. When you talk 
of flourishing landscapes, the chancellor and all of us were 
wrong in terms of the timescale, and we have had to revise our 
estimates because we did not know the extent to which the GDR's 
economy had decayed and no one knew that the Soviet Union would 
not continue in its existing form. What we have achieved in 
eastern Germany over the last three years, in spite of assuming 
such a legacy, is something to be proud of and the people in 
eastern Germany won't let you talk as if it doesn't exist. They 
are confident, they know that things are getting better, it just 
doesn't suit you in political terms that things are getting 
better; it's as simple as that; you can talk as much as you 
like, but the people involved know better. [passage omitted] 
  Ladies and Gentlemen: I do not dispute the fact that we 
have huge problems on the labor market. We cannot sit back and 
relax as a result of the signs that the recession is over. No 
one would deny that strong economic growth is not sufficient to 
solve the structural problems of unemployment. I can only say 
we must initially keep a hold on things and the people of this 
country must also be aware that we have found our feet with 
regard to the economy, that interest rates are noticeably lower, 
that profits are rising again and thus conditions for investment 
have improved, and, particularly, that the unions and trade 
unions have more understanding, also with regard to the 
flexibility which is necessary. 
  We have structured our economic policy in such a way that, 
due to the improved economic conditions, we will not hesitate 
and will not ease off in our efforts to get to grips with the 
structural problems which have grown, not only in our country 
but also due to world economic developments. As businesses and 
employers, and also as a state, we have to do a whole lot more 
in the areas of research, development, and innovation. We have 
to improve our presence on the booming markets all over the 
world. I have just returned from the Asian-Pacific conference, 
and if you can go and see what is happening outside Germany in 
this region, then you will return convinced that we will not 
succeed without additional stability, without additional 
efforts, without changes which will lead to an end to the 
paralysis. However, I am optimistic that we can achieve this. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen: We have a number of aims to achieve, 
which we are constantly pursuing. We have -- I just mentioned 
this -- made mistakes in the areas of research, development, and 
innovation. The answer is not merely to put a few million marks 
more into large companies for research purposes. The answer can 
only be to change our education system to make it more 
efficient, introduce more interchangeability, and finally 
overcome the hostility to technology in this country, the 
skepticism, which you are increasing every day. [applause] 
  The structural problems and thus unemployment can only be 
overcome when we finally get round to removing and simplifying 
laws and statutes, stop putting off deregulation, and put 
speedier processes in place in the towns and villages -- 
especially in the ones governed by you [Social Democratic Party] 
-- thus giving people the feeling that when they go to the 
administration the people working there are working for them, 
the citizens, and not the other way round. That is what we mean 
by deregulation. [applause] 
  We want to continue privatization and believe we have made 
quite some progress on this score as a federal government. Not 
many states and local communities have done so; quite a lot 
still remains to be done there. We have already talked about 
the consolidation of budgets, Ladies and Gentlemen. The 
government's consolidation course will be continued rigidly and 
consistently. No one would deny that state borrowing is too 
high, and no one would deny that we cannot afford to let net 
borrowing go on growing as it has done in recent years. I 
would, however, like to ask, as others have done, for fairness. 
We would like it to be noted and appreciated why things have 
developed like this. We have had to tackle a task which no 
other country has had to tackle in these dimensions. We must 
now simply remain consistent. [passage omitted] 
  Ladies and Gentlemen: I am not one to deny that wage 
restraint affects incomes and influences demand in a negative 
way. Who would deny that? That is an economic truism. But we 
are in a situation where we must strike a balance between this 
fact -- the fall in demand -- and the fact of the burden on 
companies' costs. When I see that we cannot sell our products 
any more and others are producing just as high quality products 
at different prices in Asia, then I must give greater weight for 
now to the reduction of the cost burden on companies. That is 
simply the way things are. At another time and in another place 
we might talk about the effect on demand; no one will refuse to 
do that. These are fundamental economic truths which you [the 
opposition] do not appreciate because you do not have the 
competence. People can see that. [passage omitted] 
  The high rate of taxation amd its high increase over the 
past few years was a consequence of reunification. I've already 
said that. We have to return quickly to the level of taxation 
we had prior to reunification and that is exactly the opposite 
of what you want in the SPD [Social Democratic Party]. The 
research institutes rightly stress that a high burden of 
taxation affects those who make a great contribution to the 
growth in the national product most. These are precisely the 
people that you in the SPD want to increase the burden of 
taxation on. The SPD's idea of getting additional tax revenue 
wholly from the so- called higher earners is not a medicine, it 
is poison for the economy and jobs. How can you promise your 
clients more milk if you want to take away fodder from the cows? 
[passage omitted] 
  We do not need another redistribution in the way the SPD 
suggests, in which everyone is worse off in the end. What we 
need is a high degree of investment for new jobs and we need 
this over the next few years. A return to the sort of 
developments we were able to achieve in the 1980's is the aim of 
the German Government's economic and financial policy. In 
contrast to you, the government has the right concept and 
expertise for this. 
  I would also like to tell Mr. Klose, who finished with a 
personal forecast, that your forecast will not come true as long 
as you paint a gloomy and pessimistic picture and as long as you 
talk down this location [Germany as a business and investment 
site]. This location is a good one, ladies and gentlemen, and 
we count on that location, on market forces, on our people, on 
our companies. We are counting on competitive conditions 
strengthening, on an improvement in those conditions. We are 
counting on a drop in costs, a reduction in over-regulation, we 
are counting on greater representation in the booming markets. 
We are counting on flexibility and we are counting on 
cooperation between the economy and state and trade unions in an 
industrial policy which we are pursuing every day, in a way that 
is correct -- namely, not by shifting responsibilities, but by 
achieving consensus, listening to people, and making 
concessions. That is our policy and you have nothing to add to 
it other than a taxation of higher earners and that is too 
little. People know this and for that reason this government, 
Mr. Klose, Ladies and Gentlemen, has the best possible chance of 
taking responsibility for the welfare of the Germans for a long 
time to come. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- The Bundestag today approved an 
increase in the coal subsidy over the votes of the opposition. 
This means the surcharge on electricity bills to subsidize the 
German coal industry will increase in 1995 from 7.5 to 8.5 
percent. The subsidy is to be introduced in eastern Germany in 
1996 at a rate of around 4.25 percent. The new arrangement is 
necessary because the Century Agreement, which governs the use 
of German coal for electricity supplies, runs out at the end of 
next year. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Bavarian SPD Does Not Rule Out </F>
Coalition With CSU"] 
  [Text] Munich, 25 Apr -- Several months before the 
Bavarian Landtag election, Social Democratic Party of Germany 
[SPD] faction chairman Schmid has mentioned the possibility of a 
coalition with the Christian Social Union [CSU]. If the CSU 
achieves only a relative majority instead of an absolute one 
and, if on the other hand, a coalition with the Greens and the 
Free Democratic Party is impossible, the SPD would be ready to 
form part of the government if only to prevent a coalition 
between the CSU and the Republikaner. At an SPD regional 
congress in Roding, Schmid called on the CSU to define its 
stance as a prerequisite for a coalition. The CSU, he said, must 
show that it is no longer the former Strauss party that could 
afford one scandal after another.

  [Text] At the end of 1993, Republikaner boss Franz 
Schoenhuber is supposed to have found out that a leading member 
of the party was involved in an attack on a home for 
asylum-seekers in Bergheim near Cologne without having reported 
it to the police. The incident was, according to a protocol, 
raised at a meeting of the Republikaner executive committee for 
Mittlelrhein. Some party members were concerned that the 
Republikaner involvement in the attack might be covered up, so 
they sent a protocol of the meeting with a personal explanation 
to Schoenhuber and the chairman of the party's federal 
arbitration court, Munich Judge Johann Muehlberger. During the 
course of a search of the federal arbitration court last Friday 
[22 April] in Munich, the documents were found, according to the 
state prosecution service. Schoenhuber's office could not be 
searched, because as a member of the European Parliament, the 
Republikaner boss enjoys parliamentary immunity. The Cologne 
prosecution service is now considering having his immunity 
lifted.

<F P=106> [Article signed "tl": "CDU Is Opposed to a Solidarity </F>
Surcharge for a Limited Period of Time"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- Differences between the CDU [Christian 
Democratic Union] and the SPD [Social Democratic Party of 
Germany] are playing an increasing part in the 1994 elections. 
While CDU General Secretary Peter Hintze explained that Germany 
was well on its way to coming out of the recession following a 
CDU Presidium meeting, SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping only talked 
of a "slight economic recovery." 
  Nevertheless, speaking in Mainz yesterday, the SPD candidate 
for chancellor said that the number of unemployed will increase 
in 1994. If it takes over the government, the SPD wants more 
money for the creation of jobs and for unification. 
  By contrast, Hintze felt that what he has been saying has 
been confirmed, because the coalition had always rejected the 
SPD's expenditure program and has thus practiced a "policy based 
on a lot of staying power." In contrast to the Social 
Democrats, Hintze said, the CDU/CSU [Christian Social Union] and 
the FDP [Free Democratic Party] had placed Germany's future as a 
center for industry and the competitiveness of the German 
economy at the center of their policies. They would place more 
emphasis on what has been achieved in maintaining a stable 
currency. 
  According to Hintze, the CDU Presidium has come out against 
reviewing the solidarity surcharge in three years' time as the 
FDP has called for. The general secretary said that the CDU was 
not now prepared to set a fixed period of time over which the 
surcharge would be levied. 
  Yesterday, the SPD Bundestag Group's spokesman on 
environmental matters, Michael Mueller welcomed "the greater 
emphasis on ecology" in the Social Democrats' government 
program. The Government Program Commission and the SPD 
Presidium had previously agreed on improvements. Thus, the 
program will include a much clearer stance in support for 
"ecology taxes" and give precise form to a new course on energy, 
said Mueller. The section dealing with energy policy envisages 
a new law on energy. The entire preamble of the present draft 
has been dropped and will be replaced by personal introduction 
by Chairman Scharping, which will be presented to delegates to 
the SPD party conference in Halle on 22 June. 
  Although the SPD's plan does not mention a specific speed 
limit, in view of the general pattern in Europe, the Social 
Democrats are considering a limit of 130 km per hour. The 
improvements to the environmental section of the government 
program have nothing at all to do with a "U-turn," explained 
Mueller. He said it was a good thing that Scharping had taken 
up suggestions from within the party. 
  That is evidently not enough for some Social Democrats. 
Yesterday, the chairman of the SPD Bundestag Group, Hans-Ulrich 
Klose, called for a more detailed section on the environment. 
"The program is not good enough in this respect," he said in 
Bonn. It requires a more concrete form and a precise 
description of ecological taxation reform and its implementation. 
  SPD General Secretary Guenther Verheugen announced that 
employment would remain the key element in the election campaign 
debate, but the second lime of attack would focus on public 
finance. The SPD would actually fulfill the present government's 
promise of "a solid and consistent fiscal policy."

<F P=106> [Interview with Wolfgang Schaeuble, head of the CDU/CSU </F>
[Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union] Bundestag 
caucus, by Konrad Handschuh and Friedrich Thelen; place and date 
not given: "`Extremely Kind'--Tax Discussion in Bonn, 
Restructuring the German Economy, Government Strategy"] 
  [Text] [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Mr. Schaeuble, at the moment, 
things do not look good for the coalition government in Bonn. 
How do you intend to come up from the depths by the elections? 
  [Schaeuble] As with the economy, the trend is more important 
than the absolute figures, and if the trend continues, things 
will not look so bad on election day. The more we succeed in 
nailing down the Social Democratic Party [SPD] and in explaining 
a few contested measures that were taken this year, the better 
our chances will be. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] The unusual thing about this campaign, 
however, is that it is the government that must attack, not the 
opposition. 
  [Schaeuble] In fact, the opposition should be calling 
attention to alternatives to the government's policies. It has 
been Scharping's strategy thus far--not without success--to 
refuse to do precisely that. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Your former secretary general, Heiner 
Geissler, is of the opinion that one should be the aggressor 
when one is behind. Where do you intend to stir things up? 
  [Schaeuble] I hold the same view as Heiner Geissler. Is it 
not strange, that Mr. Scharping wants to pursue the government's 
family policies and external security policies in a seamless 
fashion? Continuing to pursue our own policies is something we 
can probably do better than the opposition. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Now, the election will be decided on 
other 
fronts, especially with regard to the question: who can create 
the most jobs? The SPD seems to be credited with greater 
competence in that area. 
  [Schaeuble] The most recent polls give us a definite 
advantage in the area of economic competence. True, we would 
have to lead in that area by a ratio of 10. We cannot solve 
everything overnight, in a dramatic fashion with a dose of 
medication, which appears to be what the SPD is offering. These 
matters require a long, sustained effort to address the 
structural problems that have crept into the economy of western 
Germany. We shall dismantle our structural disadvantages. That 
is the way to assure long-term growth and employment. There is 
no easier way. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] How do you intend to create jobs, given 
predictions of economic growth rates of 1.5 to 2 percent? 
  [Schaeuble] We shall create them if we cut back on this 
overheated trend of spiralling wage and wage-related costs. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] [Nursing-care] benefits are not exactly 
the best place to achieve reductions in wage-related costs 
  [Schaeuble] No, they are not increasing. In this case, we 
have achieved, arduously and imperfectly enough, full 
compensation, in principle, of the costs incurred by the firms. 
Of course, one could haggle over details. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Originally, this was intended as a means 
of assuring greater self-sufficiency for the citizenry. 
  [Schaeuble] That was a victim of the cross-fire between the 
opposition, the majority of the Bundesrat, and the major 
economic associations. The fact that the unions did not support 
this was known, but their tumultuous opposition really amazed 
me. Now we shall provide the care, and we shall introduce 
greater self-sufficiency and participation in the next 
legislative session. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Will the topic of continued wage payments 
in case of illness be on the agenda? 
  [Schaeuble] It makes little sense, four weeks after the end 
of the discussion of these benefits, to revive the topic once 
more. But I guarantee, we shall address the topic of "more 
responsibility for oneself" once more. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] The issue of benefits insurance would 
make 
Ludwig Erhard turn over in his grave. How does it come about 
that Erhard's party has evidently taken one step ahead of the 
economically predictable next generation? Is the internal 
climate within the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] an unhealthy 
one for economic policymakers? 
  [Schaeuble] No, not at all. In the person of Rainer Haungs, 
we have an outstanding economic policymaker. It is true that 
Klaus Toepfer is the minister of the environment, but no one 
disputes his high degree of competence in the area of economic 
policy. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] The firms used the recession to 
restructure and they have achieved great increases in 
productivity. Has the political world also taken advantage of 
the opportunity of the crisis? 
  [Schaeuble] In this legislative session, we went to the 
limit 
of the politically possible. This path must continue to be taken 
in a consistent manner in the next session, for which reason, a 
Red-Green alternative in the next four years would be 
irresponsible. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] There could be a social-liberal coalition 
as well. 
  [Schaeuble] Any theoretically conceivable constellation, 
other than the present-day coalition, would be less suitable. We 
could have saved a few billion [German marks] more by now if the 
SPD Bundesrat majority had not hindered our savings measures. 
And if you take a look at Mr. Scharping's program, you will find 
a shortfall of about 50 billion between the claim and reality. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] You had better recheck your figures. 
  [Schaeuble] Is it more? 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Yes. 
  [Schaeuble] You see, I try to be nice to those who cannot 
quite grasp the difference between gross income and net income. 
In any case, the country can ill afford a worse government. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Will this coalition, if it is reelected, 
increase taxes again? 
  [Schaeuble] We want to reduce the state's share as a whole, 
and thus, the quotient of taxes and other levies. There will be 
no further increases, beyond those tax increases that have 
already been enacted, and the solidarity supplement. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] And the subsistence minimum that 
Karlsruhe 
[Supreme Court] insists upon? 
  [Schaeuble] Of course, as the situation continues to shift, 
there is the possibility that in an individual instance, 
increased levies could be assessed, but on the whole, there will 
be no increase of overall taxation. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Will you repeal the tax on labor, and 
rely, instead, more on indirect taxes? 
  [Schaeuble] For a long time, I have been saying, over and 
over, that, in the long term, we must assess lower levies on 
labor and business earnings. Private consumption and private 
assets pose a means of offsetting this. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Are you slowly getting the feeling that 
you cannot implement everything you want? 
  [Schaeuble] I keep trying to keep the proper balance between 
the requisite confidence and a sufficiently sober assessment of 
the situation that is rooted in reality. Of course, after 12 
years of governing activities, signs of wear start to show. I 
would not like to place my confidence purly on the sympathy 
vote. But when, on 16 October, a decision is reached concerning 
the concrete decisions and realistic proposals of both sides, we 
shall manage it. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Are you not also harboring the hope, just 
a bit, that events in world politics will help you? For example, 
on the premise that f the world all around us, especially 
Russia, is getting to be an ever more dangerous place, the 
Germans want the experienced Helmut Kohl once more. 
  [Schaeuble] We are placing our bets on the discussion in the 
fields of economics, finance, employment, and social policy. Of 
course, external security will remain a topic of central 
importance, but not in the sense that we hoped for crisis-laden 
developments. Such a price would be too high. To state the case 
somewhat informally: Better Scharping in Bonn than Zhirinovsky 
in Moscow.

<F P=106> [Article by Hans-Joachim Noack: "`I'm No Flighty </F>
Airhead'--FDP Chairman Klaus Kinkel"] 
  [Text] On Tuesday morning [12 April] of last week at his 
house in Sankt Augustin, the FDP [Free Democratic Party] chief 
and foreign minister, Klaus Kinkel, leafs through the press 
clippings sent from Bonn with a certain trepidation. Then he is 
happy. 
  The media echo which appears to him "predominantly positive" 
concerns a far-reaching decision. The previous day, the Free 
Democratic Party presidium promised to remain faithful to its 
coalition partner also for the future legislative period--a 
decision made for the chairman's sake. 
  "This was very clearly my initiative," says the lawyer who 
has been leading the Liberals since last June; and that is 
certainly true. As a last step, he had tied his "foster father," 
Hans-Dietrich Genscher, into the plan of quick determination. 
  Although the FDP leadership team will make the formal 
declaration only on Monday in Bonn's Thomas-Dehler House, the 
honorary chairman already trumpeted the news on the previous 
weekend: "If the SPD [Social Democratic Party] presents itself 
as the CDU [Christian Democratic Union] with a red shawl," he 
asks at a land party congress of the Mecklenburg-West Pomerian 
Free Democrats in Binz on the island of Ruegen, "why should we 
not stay with the original?" 
  At this point, Genscher and company have long been aware 
that 
a turnaround in coalition strategy would hopelessly overtax the 
bourgois-conservative Kinkel. Probably a fitting assessment. 
  And the Swabian [Kinkel], fussy about his reputation, 
basically sees it the same way. After the "blow of liberation" 
has been secretly agreed upon, a party chief emerges at the 
Ruegen Baltic Sea spa who inspires the delegates at least 
somewhat. He will now make his "handwriting" clear and "roll up 
his shirtsleeves." 
  He will need to. Since the botched elections in Lower Saxony 
and Schleswig Holstein, the 57-year-old administrative lawyer 
from Hechingen is in a bad position. Barely 10 months ago, 
Genscher still had praised him as the "personified 
confidence-building measure" for his party. But that no longer 
counts. 
  The Liberal chief feels affronted by harsh judgments by 
political thinkers who are quite favorably disposed toward the 
FDP's cause. Recently, political scientist Arnulf Baring called 
him to his face "an amateur actor at whom the country is 
beginning to laugh." He may have used the wrong tone, but he 
reflects the basic mood of his sympathizers: Klaus Kinkel, who 
during his years as a civil servant enjoyed the reputation of a 
competent careerist, is increasingly seen as flustered. 
Naturally, such accusations outrage him. "One has to stand still 
for that," he reacts quiveringly, while in his Bonn ministerial 
office he hits his crossed legs with the edge of his hand. What 
has he perpetrated that he, who "kept himself free of all 
scandals," is thus losing respect? 
  "I am no flighty airhead," the party chairman defends 
himself, pointing to his solid character--and that is precisely 
where the misunderstandings crop up. Where the press, for 
instance, subjects the confused top politican to harsh criticism 
in the current nonstop election year, Kinkel feels himself 
persecuted "as a human being." He is being "mercilessly reviled." 
  But in truth, there is another part of his nature, the lover 
of power who, if necessary, is not very squeamish. In his role 
as chief of the Foreign Office, after all, he has managed to 
enlarge the European house "with a sledgehammer" (DIE ZEIT). 
  Does it bother him that, after "summoning" the French 
ambassador in Bonn, the Paris LE QUOTIDIEN DE PARIS huffily 
spoke of a "rugby player?" "No, what's that all about?" He, as 
the foreign minister of an enlarged Germany, must not be seen 
"as some half-hearted fellow." 
  But the task of representing the chancellor's fatherland in 
the world is one thing--a fundamentally different one is the 
difficult job of taking in hand a miniparty disintegrating into 
innumerable particles. And Klaus Kinkel knows that. "As Foreign 
Office chief, no one bests me," says the FDP chief, thereby 
acknowledging that his effective power [as party chairman] is 
still limited at present. 
  Hence the leader of liberals tries to copy the foreign 
minister move by move--his forward push in the coalition 
decision is to him the first proof of that. Because now they are 
going to really get started. The FDP, roars the speaker in Binz 
so that his cheeks grow red with fury, must "finally become less 
accommodating, must give offense...we have been too goody-goody!" 
  After the weeks of inner tension, now a kind of political 
convalescent presents himself who calls for the offensive, also 
on subject matters. Resolutely, as if the Count [Lambsdorff] 
were still sitting at the head of the table, the Lambsdorff heir 
propagates a clearcut lobby strategy. The nets are cast to lure 
small- and medium-sized business in particular. The key word 
"elite" appears in almost all of Kinkel's "guidelines." 
  Since it is a matter of survival, the liberal gymnast 
tickles 
the old reflexes back to life. In his opinion, for too long the 
FDP has catered also to those "who don't vote for us anyway"--so 
let there be an end to it. The Free Democratic identity invoked 
by Kinkel now again unabashedly limits itself to taking the side 
of the "better and more industrious" people in the country. 
  May the CDU and SPD, which he calls "tankers," get stuck in 
society's "pack ice": He, the helmsman of the "smaller and 
nimbler ship" tries to steer his own clientele out of the danger 
zone. 
<H5>  "If I Should Really Have No Luck At All..." </H5>
  But his "struggle" to regain for the FDP a profile which at 
present is "somewhat blurred," at the same time shows the 
characteristics of artificiality. For the sake of power sharing, 
he is about to prescribe for his party the former support corset 
of an exaggerated economic liberalism, and pays for it the price 
of damaging his self-image. That has demanded of him to date to 
also see himself as an "advocate of the weak." 
  "That is a fundamental contradiction," he says a bit 
wearily, 
"with which I have to live," and at such moments one feels the 
burden pressing on the chairman. He not only considers it 
important to somehow be all things to all people. This educated 
citizen with a tendency toward brooding meditations also wants 
to claim for himself being at home in all emotional situations. 
  Kinkel as a show-off superstar, and Kinkel in the pose of 
the 
delicately strung thinker: "I personally," he says, braced by 
visits to the grass roots, "have strong nerves," and puffs out 
his athletic chest--only to change to a bitterly plaintive tone 
in the evening of the same day. There, he experiences himself 
"as rather helpless in a problematical constellation." 
  That he did not push himself forward when it was a matter of 
finding a successor for the party chairmanship is sufficiently 
well-known--but he must emphasize it time and again. In Saxony's 
Zwickau, the almost incidental question as to how he assesses 
the present rather negative image of the FDP is already enough 
to set him off. "Yes, yes, yes," drawls the one so addressed, 
and he obviously feels himself attacked: He, "Kinkel," has spent 
nights "sitting up in his bed until he finally became party 
boss." 
  Can such a one succeed in not only lifting his atrophied and 
emaciated liberals over the 5-percent hurdle, but also in 
keeping them in the government? Had the foreign minister, 
recently flying home from Russia above the clouds, not felt the 
situation of party chairman Kinkel to be rather unfortunate? "If 
I really should have no luck at all...," he complained at the 
time. 
  The early presidium decision in favor of the alliance with 
the CDU/CSU [Christian Social Union] thus also takes into 
account the mentality of the FDP's top man. An unreliable 
customer, plagued by scruples, tending toward ambivalence, and 
unsure in the core of his role-playing, is to be stabilized. 
This may not be a "blank check" for Kohl and his Christian 
Democrats, as the blue-yellow rival pope Juergen Moellemann 
denounces it--but at least Kinkel would hardly have been capable 
of action without this agreement. Strategically not very 
flexible, the FDP boss had for weeks considered any other 
solution as an imposition. 
  At the beginning of the election campaign, someone like 
Kinkel simply is incapable of, on the one hand, defending the 
joint government work, "and then simultaneously justifying 
leaving it." Win or lose, is now his motto. If he has slipped 
up, "the fault is rightfully mine." 
  Since the partner has now been decided in principle, he 
wants 
to practice the art of "distinctive profiling." The magic word, 
autonomy, is to be filled with life--a maxim, however, so far 
only anchored in theory. It would be in favor of the chairman's 
logic to now encourage his party to make a decision in the 
election of the federal president free from coalition 
calculations. But for that he still lacks the courage. He sees 
himself "on a testing ground, trying to keep the outfit 
together." 
  From the onset of his commitment as the liberal guiding 
figure, the vacillating Swabian has been under suspicion of not 
being able to make powerful counterdesigns in the ruling 
bourgeois bloc. Irmgard Schwaetzer's mocking term, "FDP 
appendage," upsets him; the chief is enraged by Moellemann's 
constant needling that the alliance should have been cancelled, 
at the latest over the elderly care insurance. 
  Has the party lost its contours because the chairman, as he 
is being told more and more, is drowsing in fear of the 
overwhelming chancellor? For Klaus Kinkel, all that is "pure 
bunk." Anyone who wants to conscientiously probe his share in 
Bonn's power, should "ask fat Kohl himself how difficult I am 
for him." 
  A politician is fighting for his reputation. He, "Kinkel," 
says Kinkel, appearing strangely guileless, "in truth is much 
more unpleasant than most people think."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The `Molav' Vision--State Government </F>
Modernization: Not Much Is Left of Gerhard Schroeder's Leftist 
Profile"] 
  [Text] After having won the election, Social Democrat 
Gerhard Schroeder stepped up to the podium of the land 
parliament and announced great goals: the ecological 
restructuring of industry, strengthening of the 
extraparliamentary environmental movement, more social 
justice--in short: reforms for "almost all political sectors." 
  That was in 1990. Schroeder, now 50, had just succeeded 
Christian Democrat Ernst Albrecht as minister-president. Four 
years later, a little more than a month after his reelection 
(44.3 percent), the Social Democrat's pronouncements sound a lot 
more muted. 
  The former visionary, who can now govern without the Green 
partner, now only tries to secure what has been achieved. His 
most exciting goal for the chronically debt-ridden land is 
"Molav." This government in-house shorthand stands for 
"modernization of the land administration." 
  For over a year, the Interior Ministry has been collecting 
proposals on how to clean up the civil service 
apparatus--whether the chambers of agriculture could do with 
less personnel, or if road construction offices could be closed 
down. The first success: Last week, the cabinet eliminated the 
superfluous position of land mandatary for the disciplinary 
system. 
  The Green's top woman, Andrea Hoops, says spitefully that 
Lower Saxony's policies in the future will be "a good deal more 
provincial" than in the days when the Greens still cogoverned in 
Hannover. 
  Schroeder's reform zeal is being checked by the tight 
situation in the land parliament. Although the SPD [Social 
Democratic Party] has an absolute one-vote majority in the 
parliament, it is awfully close. Controversial plans from the 
red-green times, such as introduction of a local transport levy, 
are simply being dropped. In such ideologically burdened 
projects, Schroeder cannot be sure of all his followers. 
  True, left Social Democrats such as representative Heinrich 
Aller, 46, and Wolfgang Juettner, 46, head of the Hannover SPD 
bezirk, admonish that the new government must not leave "ecology 
to the old coalition partner" (Aller). 
  But the head of government no longer seeks his salvation in 
nature: Just now, of all people he praised the "amigos" of the 
Bavarian CSU [Christian Social Union] for their industrial 
policy. 
  The comrades swallowed it without a murmur. Not even 
Environmental Minister Monika Griefahn dared any criticism. 
  For that, she--the most popular SPD figure in Lower Saxony 
after Schroeder--is allowed to stay in office. Agriculture 
Minister Karl-Heinz Funke also can keep his post. Although he 
failed in his fight with the Brussels EU [European Union] 
headquarters over swine fever, he gained great popularity with 
Lower Saxony's farmers for his pithy sayings. 
  Schroeder's simple personnel policy maxim: Whoever is 
popular--and knuckles under--is allowed to stay on. 
  So the new cabinet will be largely identical to the old one. 
Only in the succession to the Green Women's Affairs Minister, 
Waltraud Schoppe, Schroeder had to give in to the party's will. 
Originally, the chief of government simply wanted to abolish the 
Women's Ministry. But the few SPD women in parliament managed to 
have deputy land chairman Christina Buehrmann become Schoppe's 
successor. The new cabinet member is too much of a feminist for 
Schroeder. 
  The Ministry for Federal and European Affairs, up to now 
headed by Green Juergen Trittin, will definitely be dissolved. 
Although this impresses the citizens, the savings effect for 
Molav is small. 
  Asylum-seekers, resettlers, and civil war refugees, for whom 
leftist Trittin had been responsible, are now under the charge 
of conservative Interior Minister Gerhard Glogowski--that, too, 
is a signal. 
  Schroeder himself will administer the most important part of 
the Trittin ministry so that those in Bonn will not forget him: 
representation of Lower Saxony in the Bundesrat. 
  The comrade has announced that, from now on, he will 
"massively intervene" in federal affairs--hard times for his 
rival and party friend, Rudolf Scharping. 
  Only a few days after his reelection, Schroeder showed 
Scharping what he has in mind: He stated in Bonn that there is 
not going to be any generally observed speed limit on the pace 
set by SPD. Three days later, at the official presentation of 
the SPD election platform, Scharping was allowed to confirm what 
the man from Lower Saxony had already announced previously.

<F P=106> [Article by Heidrun Graupner: "With an Internal Compass for </F>
Democracy"] 
  [Text] Munich, Apr--She pinned the letter to her bulletin 
board in the entrance hall. Every 11 May, she receives a letter 
from Johannes Rau and last year, it was her 72d birthday, he 
included with almost prophetic prescience a quotation from 
Martin Buber: "Old age is wonderful, if one has not forgotten 
what it means to begin." However, the new beginning in October 
of last year was intense even for a Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher. She 
talked even then about alternating hot and cold baths and now, 
in the April before the presidential election, Free Democratic 
Party [FDP] Chair Klaus Kinkel provided an additional cold 
shower with his coalition declaration in favor of the union 
parties [Christian Democratic Union and Christian Social Union 
(CDU/CSU)]. 
  October was a particularly turbulent month. Hans-Dietrich 
Genscher had handed the FDP his final rejection and the 
political barometer of ZDF [Second German TV] jumped to 15 
percent at the mention of Hamm-Bruecher's name. Hamm-Bruecher 
was unanimously chosen on 15 October at the small party 
convention in Magdeburg, although some FDP leaders would have 
preferred to sacrifice the queen in this game of chess almost 
immediately. They were talking about the nominee when Hildegard 
Hamm-Bruecher stated emphatically that she did not see herself 
as a chip in a poker game--a sentiment she had to express 
several times. Then the Union parties revealed a quotation from 
her about the GDR "embassy refugees," with the transparent 
accusation that she had been opposed to unification. She, 
herself, finally suggested in June to nominate civil rights 
advocate Jens Reich from eastern Berlin. Since then, her 
candidacy has irritated some people more than Jens Reich, 
himself, who dismisses such matters with a smile. She said that 
the FDP wanted somebody who represented the party and that Reich 
would not have been accepted even if she had renounced her 
candidacy. 
<H5>  "To Begin Is Important" </H5>
  The past few weeks in the Swiss Alps, she had time to ponder 
Kinkel's coalition declaration and her own motivation for 
persevering as a candidate. The party leadership had reassured 
her that its assent just suggested an attitude and that her 
candidacy would now be supported more strongly. Hildegard 
Hamm-Bruecher allowed herself to be appeased although she had 
never liked coalition declarations. She has often expressed such 
sentiments because assent can lead to restricted maneuverability 
and that could be dangerous for the FDP. Opposition would be a 
better choice. 
  Some FDP members would indeed have been pleased, if the 
bothersome challenger had voluntarily withdrawn after Heitmann's 
retreat, but this never occurred to her. The decisive reason for 
her candidacy was not just Heitmann, the union parties' 
candidate, nor winning the election. When starting something, 
Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher often said to herself "even if it fails, 
it was still the right course of action. That is my idea of 
democracy." Her reason for running has been part of her campaign 
from the beginning: To strengthen the image of the FDP since 
even the union parties do not take the FDP seriously. "We are 
not an appendix, nor are we a bloc party." 
  She does not, however, have to tell us that she is sometimes 
simply possessed by thoughts about the unexpected possibility 
that her long political life will not just cease, that she may 
again have a chance to express her ideas--and be listened to as 
well. Wherever she appears, she enjoys the crowds with her head 
held high and always with a friendly smile. The people flock to 
her. "Hildegard for president" has triggered ovations. The 
controversial politician stands for populism and does not 
represent party cliques. This is important, even for the FDP, at 
this time of disaffection with politics in a gloomy election 
year. She is invited to everything and speaks at the opening of 
the Leipzig Book Fair, at election rallies, and at local clubs 
to "groups of frustrated people who have an urgent need to 
listen." Even the party leadership may summon her and make her 
the centerpiece, as--for instance--at the Stuttgart epiphany 
meeting. 
  She has always called herself "a freelance liberal," and 
boasted about her independence. To take an unequivocal position 
was probably unavoidable for a woman who wanted to advance in 
the male-dominated political environment of the past 46 years. 
She says that she is sometimes ruthless and inconsiderate when 
anger gets the better of her. But she had the mark of a 
politician as early as 1946 when in the small state of 
Wuerttemberg-Baden she met the minister of culture with the name 
of Theodor Heuss. The Bruecher siblings lost their parents at an 
early age. The youngest three were raised in Dresden by their 
Jewish grandmother who killed herself when she was to be 
deported to Theresienstadt. Later, when Hildegard Bruecher 
studied chemistry in Munich, she became involved with the White 
Rose circle. Nobel-prize winner Heinrich Otto Wieland, her 
doctoral mentor, and chance saved her. 
  Theodor Heuss remained the dominant figure in her life, and 
there is hardly an occasion when she does not quote him. "He was 
actually the first German who talked positively to me about 
democracy." Since then, she fights relentlessly to keep 
democracy from failing. She can almost understand why she is 
sometimes referred to in FDP circles by the title "her 
sacerdotal eminence, spokeswoman for a political conscience," 
because in the eighties she annoyed her colleagues "to the very 
end" with parliamentary reform. However, Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher 
also practiced what she preached, namely that a representative 
is not bound by the dictates of his party but only by his 
conscience. She voted against tax-free aviation gas, against the 
Fighter-90, and against party-donation amnesty. Gerhard Baum, at 
least, said that she was responsible for raising his 
"self-esteem as a parliamentarian." 
  On 1 October 1982, the day of the no-confidence vote in 
Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher said before 
the German Bundestag: "I cannot cast a vote of no confidence 
against the chancellor of the coalition government, for just a 
few months ago, I expressed my confidence in him." She also said 
that Schmidt did not deserve to be toppled without voter 
approval and that Helmuth Kohl did not deserve to become 
chancellor without voter approval. Both events carried the 
"stigma of violating democratic protocol." At that point the 
parliamentary Foreign Ministry undersecretary resigned from the 
government but remained a Bundestag representative. Her career 
was ruined, however. The word in Bonn is that from then on 
Chancellor Kohl never again acknowledged the existence of 
Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher. Hans-Dietrich Genscher, on the other 
hand, is again writing favorable articles about her and he voted 
for the candidate. 
  Yet scars remain on both sides. Maybe for that reason 
achievements that are her own are very important to her; for 
instance, the '93 charter for the Munich Citizens Association 
that she initiated and the Theodor Heuss Foundation. Sometimes 
she says that nothing has remained of her work and ideas, and 
that only a "few survivors" are still interested. In the 
mid-sixties, Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher felt really at home in the 
FDP. With Hermann Flach amd Ralf Dahrendorf, she called this the 
time of political awakening. She can only visualize a switch to 
the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] in theory. "The 
external surroundings would have been quite intolerable and 
would not have agreed with me." 
  She is a grande dame who says that she is barely on familiar 
terms even with herself. Her arguments with the Greens are less 
about substance than about their appearance. Even at age 72, her 
patrician heritage prevents her from lifting the curtain on her 
private life. The liberal Protestant has been married for more 
than 40 years to Erwin Hamm, a Catholic and member of the CDU, 
who worked for many years as a social and health administrator 
in Munich. When he derides her Protestant work ethics, she 
replies that it is the only way she can fritter her time away. 
The pile of books and articles that she has written on the side 
proves her point. Erwin Hamm once called her the "family Jeanne 
d'Arc" of Bonn, which clearly characterizes her better than to 
call her a feminist, although she spent her entire life 
practicing politics as a woman. 
  When she started in 1948, she was the youngest city 
councillor in Munich and she was always the first: she was the 
first female Bundestag group chair, the first female 
parliamentary undersecretary, the first female national deputy 
party chief, and the first woman in the Foreign Ministry, which 
caused men some consternation. "But they were polite," she says, 
"initially they sent me to a playground and that was proper 
because it enabled me to gain a global perspective." 
  She had to suffer many indignities, and in the Bavarian 
Landtag, she sometimes felt as if she were futilely baying at 
the moon. In the early sixties, the Bavarian FDP was drifting to 
the right and wanted to get rid of her because she could not be 
"integrated." The citizens saw it differently and gave twice as 
many votes to her 17th place on the list than to those who 
occupied the first places. In 1984 she toppled the Bavarian 
minister of justice, Theodor Maunz, because of his Nazi 
background. She constantly fought for better cultural and 
changed educational policies and succeeded to bring about a 
referendum against parochial schools. She is still advocating a 
plebiscite clause in the constitution. The opening of the school 
system to children of all social classes--and thus, above all, 
to girls--was, she thinks, her most important achievement. She 
cannot understand the FDP's neglect of educational policies, 
policies that are "liberal beacons, and subjects for mind and 
spirit." 
<H5>  Toying With Intriguing Ideas </H5>
  Now she is again the first and convinced that, "in 
principle," it will be easier in the future for a woman to be a 
presidential candidate. She finds the thought of "a male 
president--a female president" intriguing--and, she says, she is 
up to it. Her hesitation over these words, relates to her 72 
years, an age "in which one cannot simply continue one's life as 
it happens to be at the moment." Yet, she knows exactly what she 
would do as president--it is something that the protagonist of a 
rejuvenated democracy has always championed. She is surprised 
that so far nothing has been said about the foreign-policy 
aspect of the presidency, since Weizsaecker had made a pivotal 
impact on the image of the Federal Republic abroad. In this 
area, too, she feels confident because of her six-year 
experience in the Foreign Ministry. 
  On 2 May the FDP Executive Committee will vote on the 
coalition declaration. Also at issue will be the presidential 
election and votes for Roman Herzog, for Johannes Rau, and for 
Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher. So far only Secretary General Werner 
Hoyer has said that a third ballot with the party's own 
candidate would be the least-flawed solution. It will be 
interesting, especially for the candidate who has never taken so 
much care in drafting her speeches as in her present position in 
which she has promised to polish the party's image. What action 
FDP members will take on 23 May remains to be seen. "Some people 
will settle old scores with me in the election booth." This will 
certainly be her last major role on the political stage--a 
thought that also concerns her. As a young girl, Hildegard 
Hamm-Bruecher was a good gymnast. She has not forgotten that one 
is judged not only for the execution of the exercises but also 
for one's dismount.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Karlsruhe: Hashish Consumption </F>
Permitted"] 
  [Text] Karlsruhe -- The possession and consumption of 
hashish and marijuana in small quantities will no longer be 
punishable. In a verdict released yesterday, the Constitutional 
Court in Karlsruhe decided that the authorities must turn a 
blind eye if cannabis products are procured or imported solely 
for occasional private use and if there is no danger to third 
parties. 
  In its decision, the Second Panel failed to specify the 
meaning of "small quantities" and "occasional private use," but 
placed the laender under an obligation to define these terms in 
order to coordinate the procedure for adopting new rules on 
discontinuing criminal proceedings. So far, only 
Schleswig-Holstein has defined these limits. Schleswig-Holstein 
courts consider a "small quantity" to mean up to 30 grams, on 
the assumption that this is a one-week supply for a single 
person. 
  At the same time, the Constitutional Court confirmed the ban 
on drugs as set down in the law on anesthetics, thus rejecting 
seven appeals from German courts that had said that permitting a 
limited use of drugs might not be in conformity with the 
Constitution, especially because of the different way of 
treating hashish and alcohol. 
  According to the Constitutional Court judges, the difference 
in sentences that can be meted out for the misuse of hashish, 
alcohol, and nicotine does not collide with the constitutional 
principle of equality. The misuse of alcohol involves dangers 
similar or even greater than those posed by the misuse of 
hashish and marijuana, but it should be borne in mind that there 
are many possible uses of alcohol, most of them not leading to a 
state of intoxication, whereas in the case of cannabis products, 
intoxication figures in first place. Needless to say, there is 
no "right to be intoxicated." 
  After a long period of time, the number of drug-induced 
deaths in Germany has once again clearly increased in the first 
quarter of the year. The Interior Ministry in Bonn said that 
the number of such deaths increased from 343 to 372 against the 
first quarter of 1993, an increase of 8.5 percent. The number 
of first-time consumers of hard drugs went up by 16.8 percent, 
reaching 2,250.

<F P=106> ["grd"-signed report: "`Close Down All Nuclear Power </F>
Plants'"] 
  [Excerpt] Hamburg -- Lower Saxony, Schleswig-Holstein, and 
Hamburg want to renounce nuclear power. This was agreed at a 
meeting in Hamburg by minister-presidents Gerhard Schroeder, 
Heide Simonis, and Mayor Henning Voscherau (all Social 
Democratic Party). The three laender are planning to coordinate 
their future energy policies within the "regional development 
concept." This will include closing down all nuclear power 
plants, Schroeder said. 
  The three heads of government have, however, not yet agreed 
on a date for opting out of nuclear power. "We do not want to 
pressure ourselves," Schroeder said. Specific steps can be 
expected next year. There will be talks with the major power 
suppliers in northern Germany over the next few months, where 
economically feasible alternatives to nuclear power will be 
discussed. Voscherau and Schroeder did not say which 
alternatives they have in mind. Ms Simonis indicated, however, 
that a more intense use of coal would be the obvious choice. 
She urged the other laender to close down their nuclear power 
plants as well. "Quitting nuclear power can only be successful, 
if all laender join in." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Pia Weber: "Jagoda Wants a New Law on Part-Time </F>
Work"] 
  [Excerpt] Nuremberg -- Bernhard Jagoda, president of the 
Federal Employment Office (BA), has called for new social 
insurance regulations to accelerate the trend toward part-time 
employment. In addition to adjustments to the legislation on 
pensions, somewhat higher contributions to unemployment 
insurance must also be permitted so that part-time employees 
receive higher unemployment benefits when they are unemployed. 
  Speaking to HANDELSBLATT, Jagoda made a simple calculation: 
"Over the past 10 years, 1 million part-time jobs have been 
created for which social insurance contributions have to be paid 
without special conditions favoring such a development. Thus, I 
am confident that a further 2 million people could be in 
employment if the framework conditions for this kind of work 
were improved. There is a trend in this direction. It is only 
a question of accelerating it." 
  The BA president is of the opinion that a limited number of 
working hours should no longer be primarily available to women, 
but an alternative for men, too. The only important thing is 
that part-time employment should be voluntary. In addition, 
returning to full employment must also be an available option. 
  Confined to lower-level jobs until now, a workweek of 
between 
25 and 30 hours or any other number of weekly working hours 
should also be acceptable in higher positions. "This could also 
lead to a different kind of distribution of tasks. Why, for 
example, should a manager employed on a part-time basis not be 
able also to hold an honorary position in the Chamber of 
Industry and Trade?" [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["pso" report: "Siemens Corporation Sticks to Cautious </F>
Prediction of Result"] 
  [Text] Siemens AG, Munich/Berlin -- The leading German 
electronics corporation has slightly increased its profits 
during the first half of the current business year (30 
September). According to an interim report, during the first six 
months Siemens achieved a yield after taxes of 879 million 
German marks [DM] (previous year DM877 million). A spokesman 
for the corporation said, however, upon inquiry, that Siemens 
still expects a declining annual profit for the 1993-94 business 
year. During the latest shareholders' meeting Financial 
Director Karl-Hermann Baumann announced a probably constant 
operational pretax profit (previous year DM1.055 billion) and a 
lower financial yield before taxes (previous year DM1.855 
billion). The fact that this development of profits has not yet 
had an effect in the course of this year was justified by the 
spokesman by good financial results during the first quarter of 
the business year. 
  As the interim report further shows, foreign business has 
particularly revived for Siemens. Orders received rose by 8.6 
percent to DM44.4 billion during the period under review 
compared with the same period last year. Orders received from 
aboard even rose by 21 percent to DM26.9 billion, while domestic 
demand declined by 6.4 percent to DM17.5 billion. As one reason 
for the increase in foreign orders, Siemens cites the first 
consolidation of the U.S. lamp producer Osram Sylvania, but also 
a strong foreign demand for products of drive, switching, and 
wiring technology, automobile technology, medical technology, 
private communications technology, as well as facilities for 
energy production. Weak domestic demand primarily affected 
installation and automatization technology, public communication 
networks, as well as the transfer and distribution of energy. 
  Turnover also developed more favorably for the corporation 
abroad. During the period under review, overall turnover rose 
by 3 percent to DM38 billion, with turnover abroad going up 13 
percent to DM22.4 billion, while domestic turnover declined by 
9.3 percent to DM15.6 billion. However, Siemens points out 
that, without including Osram Sylvania, corporation turnover 
would have remained constant. Siemens says that business with 
modular units and transportation technology are the "supporters 
of growth." Even though Siemens Nixdorf Information Systems 
increased turnover abroad, it has not compensated for the weak 
domestic business with that. 
  In the development of personnel, a clear shift across 
borders 
can be seen. At the end of March 397,000 people were employed, 
which is about 6,000 more than a year ago. The inclusion of new 
corporation companies for the first time, above all Osram 
Sylvania, with 14,000 employees, however, disguises the 
simultaneous personnel reduction of 8,000 people. The number of 
employees in Germany was reduced by 5,000 to 233,000, while 
staff abroad increased by 11,000 to 164,000. 
  In conclusion, Siemens reports on a decline of investment 
during the period under review to DM2.4 (3.5) billion, which is 
mainly due to lower purchases of shares. According to 
unconfirmed reports, Siemens transferred about DM1.36 billion 
for Sylvania to the U.S. GTE Corporation during the period under 
review.

<F P=106> ["Welt-Nachrichtendienst" report: "State Prosecutor </F>
Presents Material Against Lopez"] 
  [Text] Darmstadt -- The Darmstadt state prosecutor 
yesterday presented a detailed list of documents confiscated 
from Jose Ignacio Lopez, member of the board of directors of 
Volkswagen [VW], who was accused of industrial espionage by his 
former employer General Motors/Opel. In a two-page declaration, 
the state prosecutor substantiated the accusation that Lopez and 
close aides took along classified documents to Wolfsburg when 
they changed from General Motors to Volkswagen. 
  Plans for the construction of a new plant in the Spanish 
Basque Country were seized in Lopez's office in Wolfsburg. They 
provided "indication for close resemblance" with a similar 
project, on which Lopez used to work for his former employer, 
General Motors, in 1992. The Volkswagen "Plant B" project and 
General Motors' "Plant X" study are 75 percent identical, 
sources from the judicial authorities have said. Opel and 
General Motors had rated their study as "classified." 
  Moreover, Opel documents dealing with a development project, 
acquisition strategies, and economic strategies, which were also 
classified as secret company plans, were found in private 
apartments of Lopez and other former Opel managers. Yet, the 
state prosecutor emphasized that the investigations have not yet 
been concluded and no decision had been made yet regarding a 
charge against Lopez. 
  In a first statement, Volkswagen rejected the suspicion of 
industrial espionage. The mere close resemblance of confiscated 
plans with General Motors/Opel documents is not yet an 
indication of this accusation. Opel, however regards the state 
prosecutor's statement as a confirmation of its own conviction 
"that a great number of secret design papers and the company's 
highly sensitive cost structures were systematically 
misappropriated obviously to benefit a competitor." 
  However, an action for banning Lopez and seven former Opel 
employees from working for another company had been turned down 
by Opel at the Frankfurt/Main land court before.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "More Orders for Eastern Germany"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn, 25 Apr -- In 1993, the FRG placed over 17 
million German marks [DM] in orders from the new laender, says a 
second report on federal orders from east German enterprises 
which Reinhard Goehner [Christian-Democratic Union], 
parliamentary secretary of state in the Economics Ministry, 
placed before the government on Tuesday [19 April]. According 
to the report, over DM11 billion in federal orders went to 
eastern Germany in the second half of 1993, an increase of 5 
percent against the first half of the year. Goehner spoke of a 
"very satisfactory report," especially because it takes into 
account the many large infrastructure investments in the new 
laender. More than 90 percent of federal construction projects 
in the new laender were carried out by east German enterprises. 
In 1992, only about DM7.5 billion in federal orders went to 
eastern Germany. Goehner said that developments indicate the 
chancellor's calls for double the volume of orders from the new 
laender have been largely fulfilled. The point now is to keep up 
this figure. Apart from the orders initiative of German 
industry, which ordered about DM35 billion in goods and services 
in the new laender in 1993, the FRG's efforts are a major 
contribution to the boom in eastern Germany. Success is due 
mainly to east Gemran enterprises' entitlement to participate in 
cheap west German tenders, whereby east German enterprises can 
execute an order for the same price as the cheapest German 
bidder. To encourage the emergence of a middle class, these 
enterprises will be paid a bonus of up to 5 percent, 
irrespective of the size of the order. Goehner appeared 
disappointed that no other west German land apart from Hesse and 
Berlin had adopted the preferential guidelines for east German 
enterprises.

<F P=106> ["hal"-signed report: "Research Institutes Cautiously </F>
Optimistic"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 26 Apr -- Against the background of a dynamic 
upward development in the United States and of an economic 
recovery in West Europe, the leading economic research 
institutes are expecting the German economy to recover. The 
German GNP will grow by 1.5 percent this year, according to the 
spring report by the Hamburg HWWA Institute for Economic 
Research, the Munich Ifo Institute for Economic Research, the 
Kiel University's Institute for World Economy (IfW), the Halle 
Institute for Economic Research (IWH), and the Essen-based 
Rhine-Westphalian Institute for Economic Research (RWI). Only 
the Berlin-based German Institute for Economic Research (DIW) is 
skeptical, predicting a 0.5 percent growth for the whole of 
Germany. 
  Yet, the institutes are dampening the politicians' optimism: 
"The improvement in the economic situation does not, however, 
mean that the course has already been set for a strong growth of 
the west German economy and for a high level of employment," the 
report says. The economic researchers' assessment of eastern 
Germany is equally cautious: "While industrial investment has 
been strong so far, it cannot be ruled out that the initial 
development may gradually lose momentum, after major investment 
projects by Western companies have been completed." Also, many 
investors seem to have planned projects that they are now unable 
to realize. The institutes are pinning their hopes on an 
increase in foreign demand. Private consumption will, however, 
remain slack. After all, the macroeconomic total net wages and 
salaries will go down by just under 2 percent due to higher 
social insurance contributions and tax increases. This could 
result in more restrained consumer habits. 
  Just as in previous years, the majority of the institutes 
urge politicians to conduct a moderate wage and fiscal policy. 
Investments must come from private funds to enable the creation 
of a large number of jobs. The researchers confirm that the 
public deficit will decrease considerably in 1995. A lower 
public budget deficit does not, however, imply a more sound 
financial policy. With the agreed massive tax increases, 
consolidation threatens to become an end in itself as far as 
fiscal policy goes. Yet it is quite natural that those private 
investors contributing most to the net product are hit the 
hardest. After its reintroduction next year, the solidarity 
surcharge should be gradually abolished, starting in 1996. 
Since the Federal Constitutional Court demands a change in the 
tax-free subsistence level as of 1996, "reforms of taxation" 
should be tackled, all institutes except for the Berlin-based 
DIW say. The progressive rate will be kept, and the income 
level for the maximum tax rate should be increased. 
  The institutes reprimand the government for thinking that 
the 
economy virtually has to earn tax cuts by means of rapid growth 
and increasing tax receipts. "Tax cuts are not the climax of 
economic expansion, but they are a precondition for a lively 
economic development," the report says. Also, the state must 
promote structural changes by deregulating markets and making 
them more flexible. Market power threatens to be misused in the 
fields of energy supply, waste disposal, and in part of the 
transport and financing businesses. Thus, banks achieving 
higher profits during the recession than other sectors do during 
a boom, indicate a lack of competition and markets being sealed 
off. The Bundesbank is urged to continue to announce money 
supply targets in spite of the recent unusually high increase in 
the money supply. For 1994, the institutes consider a money 
supply target of 5 to 7 percent appropriate, which is slightly 
more than the Bundesbank's 4 to 6 percent. The increase in 
money supplies is expected to go down considerably over the next 
few months. Even if interest rates in the United States 
continue to increase, the Bundesbank could lower its key 
interest rate by another 2 percent in the course of the year. 
Long-term interest rates in the capital market could move below 
6 percent. 
  The DIW is much more skeptical. With private consumption 
expected to go down considerably, the Berlin researchers are 
forecasting a further setback in production in the second half 
of the year. The DIW also holds a different view on financial 
policy. Instead of tax cuts, the DIW considers a mixed strategy 
of tax increases, lower social insurance contributions, and cuts 
in expenditure appropriate.

<F P=106> ["for" report: "Spring Report: World Trade Gaining </F>
Dynamism This Year"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- A revival of the economic development on a 
broad basis is in the offing at the international level. 
According to the assessment of the six leading economic 
research institutes, which presented their spring report on 
Tuesday [26 April], important stimuli are provided by monetary 
and financial policy incentives in the important industrial 
nations. Decisive stimuli will be provided by the United 
States, the experts say. There the upswing will increase and 
cause an "import suction." A further upward movement is 
expected in the East European reform states. 
  Initiated by the vivid economic development in the United 
States and strong stimuli of demand in the Southeast Asian 
threshold countries, world trade will gain dynamism this year, 
in the experts' view. The positive trend will increase hand in 
hand with the economic revival in West Europe. Japanese imports 
will increase considerably, at first because of the revaluation, 
later on also for economic reasons. In the Latin American 
countries, an increase in output and imports is expected as a 
result of the overcoming of the debt crisis. 
  The reform states in Central Europe, in particular Poland, 
Hungary, and the Czech Republic, will also increase their 
purchases. A decline in imports is expected in the petroleum 
exporting developing countries and in the CIS countries because 
of lower export revenues. In general, the volume of world trade 
will increase by 5 to 6 percent this year, the expert report 
says. In 1995 one can expect a stronger increase, and the speed 
of expansion will be as high as during the second half of the 
1980's. According to the experts' analysis, the agreements of 
the latest GATT round will not yet have any effect worth 
mentioning. Rather, they have the effect of a medium-term 
growth reserve. 
  In addition to the United States (estimated growth for 1004: 
plus 3.5 percent), Canada (plus 3 percent), Norway (plus 3 
percent), and Great Britain (plus 2.5 percent) will also provide 
important stimuli for growth, in the view of the experts. In 
the Western industrial states, apart from eastern Germany (4 
percent), Italy (4 percent), and Spain (4.5 percent), the 
inflation rate will not exceed the 3-percent threshold. 
Inflation is expected to be as low as after the slump in oil 
prices in the mid-1980's. In the scientists' view, unemployment 
will continue to increase in the most European countries and in 
Japan for the time being. 
  The institutes predict a clearly diverging development for 
the region of Central and East Europe. Here Poland, Hungary, 
and the Czech Republic will gain economic importance. Output is 
increasing, inflation is relatively low (Poland 30, Czech 
Republic 10, Hungary 20 percent). In the Slovak Republic, 
Romania, Bulgaria, and, above all, in the CIS countries, on the 
other hand, the slump is not yet over. So far, the market 
economy structures are hardly consolidated, the recessive 
influences are strong, and the inflation rate is high (Bulgaria 
50, Romania 200 percent). In the experts' view, the development 
in the CIS states will be determined by a strong decline in 
output and continuing hyperinflation (Ukraine 4,000 percent, 
Belarus 2,000 percent). 
  In none of the East European reform countries has it been 
possible so far to establish preconditions for a satisfying 
growth, the expert report says. Investments are insufficient, 
company profits are low because of the strongly rising wages, 
the problem of old debts is largely unsolved, and the capital 
markets are not working properly. In the experts' view, 
unemployment will increase further, in particular in Romania, 
Bulgaria, and in Slovakia. In the CIS countries, employment is 
currently maintained at an excessive level through subsidies, 
because there are no social safeguards for jobless people.

<F P=106> ["hal"-signed report: "Brighter Prospects for the Economy; </F>
Growth of 1.5 Percent Predicted"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 26 Apr -- The German GDP is expected to grow 
by a total of 1.5 percent this year. This has been announced 
by the leading economic research institutes in their spring 
reports. The researchers expressed limited optimism in their 
study. However, changes in the financial and wage policies are 
required for a sustained upswing. Thus, the solidarity 
surcharge that is to be reintroduced next year should be 
gradually abolished again as of 1996. The scientists also 
criticized the predominance of certain lines of business in the 
market, mentioning the banks explicitly. 
  Despite the criticism by the institutes, Finance Minister 
Theo Waigel (Christian Social Union) believes that his financial 
course has clearly been confirmed. His policy has made a major 
contribution to the emerging reversal in the economic 
development. It is now important to continue the course of 
consolidation that has been initiated. The economic spokesman 
of the Bundestag group of the Free Democratic Party of Germany, 
Graf Lambsdorff, stated that it is particularly striking that 
the report is calling for tax reductions as a condition for a 
dynamic economic development. The economic and financial 
spokesman of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, Lafontaine, 
interpreted the report by the economic experts as a confirmation 
for his party's call for a surcharge on income tax. The German 
Trade Union Federation called on the government to introduce an 
investment grant and to carry out planned public investments 
earlier. In this way, the government could make an independent 
contribution to an economic upswing. It should not solely rely 
on a recovery of the world economy. The German Employees' Union 
accused the institutes of ignoring the dramatic situation in the 
labor market. The employers, however, support the institutes' 
view that the machine times must be extended. In fact the 
bargaining autonomy has proven itself in a difficult economic 
situation, but a wage policy continues to be required that takes 
into consideration the considerable lack of jobs, the National 
Union of German Employer Associations stressed. The Federation 
of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce (DIHT) endorsed the 
view of the experts that only a moderate economic recovery can 
be expected for the time being. The politicians responsible for 
economic policy must realize that support from the finance and 
tax policies is urgently required. In this spirit, the DIHT 
backs the demand for the gradual abolition of the solidarity 
surcharge. The National Association of German Banks expressed 
surprise over the institutes' assertion that the high profits in 
the banking industry are a sign of a lack of competition. This 
creates once more the impression that the profits of the credit 
institutions are made at the expense of other lines of business. 
This prevailing prejudice does not become justified through 
constant repetition, it stressed.

<F P=106> ["wis" report: "Western Companies Primarily Count on </F>
Exports"] 
  [Text] Munich, 26 Apr -- In March, the companies of the 
west German producing industry continued to assess their current 
situation largely as negative, but in comparison with February 
the Munich Ifo Institute for Economic Research noted a clear 
improvement in the assessment of the situation. Regarding their 
assessment of the next six months, the companies were more 
optimistic. They are counting primarily on export business. 
  According to Ifo, the reports within the framework of the 
economic development test permit the conclusion that orders 
received increased in March and that orders on hand were kept at 
the level of the previous month despite accelerated production. 
On average, orders on hand were sufficient for production of 
2.5 months, which was as long as in December 1993. 
  During this period capacity utilization increased slightly 
from 79 to 80.3 percent. According to Ifo, the production plans 
for the next few months show an upward trend. Sales prices have 
again declined in various fields; over the next few months the 
price climate is expected to be calm. 
  A differentiation in line with economic branches shows "far 
less unfavorable business" for the producers of preproducts than 
the last months, particularly in the chemical industry. 
  Investment goods producers largely assess the situation as 
negative, but it has still improved, the Ifo report continues. 
In particular machine-building registered an increase in 
orders. There, and in electrical engineering production, plans 
have "reached the threshold of the positive area." 
<H5>  Expectations of East German Industry Only Cautiously </H5>
Optimistic 
  In the durable consumer goods industry the number of 
companies with a bad business situation has again declined 
"tangibly." Regarding further development, the participants in 
the test are, however, skeptical. The producers of nondurable 
consumer goods, particularly in the clothing industry, are still 
largely negative in their statements, but far less pessimistic 
than before. 
  In east German industry the current business situation 
continues to be unsatisfactory, expectations are "only 
cautiously optimistic." At least, orders received in March were 
considerably higher; still, orders on hand declined slightly 
from 3.2 months in December 1993 to 3.1 months. 
  According to Ifo, capacity utilization remained virtually 
unchanged at almost 76 percent, but it was considerably higher 
than in March 1993 (71 percent). Export prospects are still 
seen negatively; one-quarter of the companies complain about 
sales problems, 16 percent about problems with financing. 
<H5>  Construction Sector in Old Laender Remains Skeptical </H5>
  In March, the construction sector in the west said that its 
current situation is still unfavorable; expectations are still 
largely characterized by skepticism. If weather is disregarded, 
building output and capacity utilization remained constant over 
the past months and is above last year's value. While the 
assessment of those polled in the branch of public works and 
foundation works was very unfavorable, in building construction 
one can see a slight improvement, just as in prefab building. 
  In the east particularly that branch of building 
construction 
that is involved in housing construction expresses satisfaction. 
In the rest of the sector negative assessments continue to 
dominate. Prices have again declined in individual spots; most 
companies, however, expect a stabilization of the price level. 
  According to the Ifo test, in March the business atmosphere 
in west German wholesale trade again improved "considerably"; 
company reports allow another recovery to be expected. Turnover 
probably exceeded last year's level; prices remained largely 
stable, which, in the companies' view, will probably also be the 
case over the next three months. 
  In east German wholesale trade, negative assessments are 
still dominant, but the business situation has improved. 
Pressure by stocks has decreased; nevertheless, one-quarter of 
the companies consider their stocks too high. 
  Retail trade in the west and in the east reported declines 
in 
turnover compared with the same period last year and, according 
to the poll, ordering is to be further limited over the next few 
months. While in the west individual price increases are 
reported, the trend in the east is going rather downward. In 
the west, only the consumer markets expressed satisfaction with 
the development; mail order companies, on the other hand, 
complain of a further deterioration of their business.

<F P=106> [Reihard Uhlmann commentary: "Small Election Gift"] </F>
  [Text] If economic development adheres to the prediction 
of the spring report, it will give the government coalition a 
small election gift, because the majority of the economic 
institutes expect the upswing to begin in western Germany during 
the second half of 1994, also with accordingly positive effects 
on the economy in the new laender. 
  Most statements by the Christian Democratic Union 
[CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] and the Free Democratic Party 
of Germany [FDP], therefore, generously brush aside the more 
pessimistic predictions of the German Institute for Economic 
Research (DIW). Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt (FDP) even 
sees the chance that the growth rates could be a bit higher than 
predicted by the institutes. 
  However, the coalition should beware of succumbing to all 
too 
great an optimism about the economic development now. Even the 
majority prediction, which is at the upper limit of all 
predictions so far, does not permit that. Only exports are 
relatively certain as an economic engine so far. Private 
consumption continues to lag behind because of the fact that 
real incomes will go down again this year, and the recovery of 
investments will make only gradual progress despite brighter 
expectations for profits. 
  Above all, however, unemployment will continue to rise for 
the time being. Here there remains only the hope for a change 
in employment next year. The institutes, too, did not have any 
new ideas on this matter, apart from the well-known 
prescriptions against this problem. Their loquacious 
philosophizing that structural unemployment is "not a phenomenon 
inherent to the market economy" does not help much. 
  While the institutes praise the parties to the wage 
negotiations almost excessively -- even though only for the wage 
agreements in western Germany -- they are once again very 
critical of financial policy. Even though they corroborate the 
FRG treasurers that they are following a thrift course, they 
point out that the consolidation threatens to become a "fiscal 
purpose in itself" because of the "massive tax increases." This 
does permit the reduction of deficits, but, at the same time, 
private households and companies are deprived of "an 
unprecedented level of financial means" at the cost of the 
economic development. 
  The majority of the institutes therefore demand a strong tax 
reduction despite the high state debts, including a gradual 
reduction of the solidarity surcharge as of 1996. They clearly 
reject the cost-neutral tax reform that Waigel is planning for 
the next legislative period: "Tax reductions are not the apex 
of economic expansion, but they are a precondition for a lively 
development of the economy." 
  The institutes are convinced that tax reductions finance 
themselves via more growth. However, this calculation need not 
always be correct. Therefore, Waigel should take this proposal 
into account with caution. Otherwise, one day, the institutes 
will reproach him or his successor for even higher deficits.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Almost Everyone Notices the Boom"] </F>
  [Text] The German's economy's prospects have improved even 
further. Following recession and stabilization, important 
economic spheres in the western part of the country have begun 
to recover. Growth has consolidated in the new laender. The 
boom there now seems to be the result of increasingly 
independent economic stimuli. Economics Minister Guenther 
Rexrodt is even convinced that the government's economic 
forecast and the 1.5 percent real economic growth for the whole 
country predicted by the research institutes can be exceeded. 
  Economic trends are going to be the focus of the Hanover 
Fair, the world's largest exhibition of investment goods. The 
mood among the over 6,800 exhibitors from 60 countries and among 
the visitors is optimistic; better foreign sales of German goods 
are expected than in 1993. "Production and turnover are clearly 
improving," the chemical industry, one of the largest industrial 
branches represented in Hanover, claims. Therefore it comes as 
no surprise that Chancellor Helmut Kohl ("a turn for the 
better") and German Chamber of Trade and Industry president 
Hans-Peter Stihl ("the order books are getting full") are very 
happy about the fair. 
  Already before the fair, the statisticians noticed that 
demand and production in the processing industry had expanded in 
February, a growth of about 3 percent against the January level. 
Orders show that domestic business has also picked up at last, 
with an increase of 2.5 percent. Out of the large industrial 
sectors, the investment goods industry has reaped above-average 
benefits from the increase in orders. On the other hand, orders 
in the automobile industry have grown disproportionately against 
January, an increase of 9 percent. This development has 
obviously already had a bearing on production. Here too, 
production in the investment goods industry has experienced an 
above-average increase, beating the relevant 1993 result in 
terms of demand and output. 
  This confirms what the FAZ [FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG] 
development indicator, which reports on the placement of orders, 
the business climate, and job vacancies, predicted over 12 
months ago. "The chances of an economic revival this year have 
improved even further," the analysis reads. Even the latest 
Institute for Economic Research [IFO] economic development 
indicator shows a continuation of the positive developments in 
industry, consisting chiefly of brisk business with exports. 
All main production sectors and most subsidiary branches expect 
higher output than they did in last summer's survey. In August 
1993 they expected a decrease in output in 1994, but in fact the 
size of 1994 orders has displayed respectable growth. A further 
consolidation of economic growth is expected in 1995. According 
to all these surveys, it is the investment goods industry that 
is the main source of the economic growth; the main sectors of 
this industry responsible for this growth are machinery, road 
vehicles, and electrical goods. 
  A major reason for the improved trend and the optimistic 
forecasts for the coming months is the clear improvement in 
export conditions: Following "slow" growth among Germany's 
major trade partners, the demand of these partners for German 
commodities has again increased, and has done so ever since the 
beginning of last year. The growth stimuli were backed up by a 
repeated improvement in competitiveness, and a reduction in 
costs. The devaluation of the mark against the dollar and yen 
have boosted foreign demand by an additional amount. Following 
the sharp decline in exports, especially in the first half of 
1993, exports picked up again in the second half of the year 
albeit by a very small amount. In February 1994, exports rose by 
a good 6 percent against January. Total exports in January and 
February were 3 percent higher than in the same months of 1993. 
The export surplus in these months, amounting to almost 12 
billion marks, was almost double the figure for January and 
February 1993. 
  In the meantime, the mood among consumers also seems to be 
improving slowly. The Nuremberg-based Society for Consumer, 
Market, and Sales Research expects an improvement in the general 
economic situation beginning in the middle of 1994, together 
with better prospects for the labor market, an increase in 
incomes, and higher turnover in the retail trade, coupled with a 
decrease in inflation. The Cologne-based Institute of German 
Industry says that in order to support private consumption, 
consumers should have reduced the savings indicator since the 
end of 1991 from 13.1 to 11.1 percent. In western Germany alone, 
every percent less inflation is increasing the maneuvering space 
of real incomes by around 18 billion marks. 
  In eastern Germany, in the meantime, economic stimuli have 
been increasingly shifting from the construction industry and 
services sector to industry. Following earlier sharp declines, 
internal orders in the processing industry went up by almost one 
fifth in 1993. Industrial output has at last undergone a strong 
increase by 7.5 percent against the 1992 figure. Thus, the fall 
in employment in industry has been halted. The Bundesbank 
claims that the reduction in employment in the whole of German 
industry could now reach an end.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The German-Netherlands Corps Within </F>
Reach; Agreement on the Command Structure and Organization"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 21 Apr--Announced last year as a general plan, 
the merging of the staff of the German 1st Corps in Muenster 
with the Netherlands 1st Corps, stationed up to now in 
Apeldoorn, to form a binational German-Netherlands Army corps in 
Muenster has progressed to the point that an overall agreement 
and an implementation agreement have been completed. The first 
of these agreements is to be signed in The Hague on Friday [22 
April] by the two defense ministers, Ruehe and Ter Beek, the 
second by the German Army chief of staff, Lieutenant General 
Bagger, and the supreme commander of the Netherlands ground 
forces, Lt. Gen. Couzy. 
  According to the agreements, the post of the commanding 
general, his deputy, the chief of staff, and a few other 
high-ranking officers of the joint corps will rotate regularly 
between the two armed forces for a period of two to three years. 
As first commanding general, the present deputy supreme 
commander of the Netherlands ground forces, Major General 
Reitsma, will take over command of the corps beginning in 
October of this year. The corps will achieve operational 
readiness in the course of the next year in its fully integrated 
form. The German deputy, however, has yet to be appointed. 
<H5>  The Hague Contributes Army Remnants </H5>
  A command support brigade will be assigned directly to the 
integrated corps staff in Muenster. The staff of the brigade 
will be stationed on Netherlands territory, presumably in 
Eibergen, near the border with Germany. The Netherlands 
Army--which henceforth will no longer have an independent corps 
staff, and which will achieve this command level, at least 
initially, through the merging with parts of the German 
Bundeswehr in the form of the binational corps staff--will 
contribute the 1st Division to the new structure together with 
the existing corps troops and the Netherlands brigade stationed 
in the Lueneburg Heath. Significantly, this integration, in 
comparison with the original plan, was strengthened even further 
at the suggestion of the Netherlands. This corps merger 
represents, de facto, the linking of the remnants of the 
dismantled Netherlands Army with a part of the German 
Bundeswehr. Belgium is following a similar path with the 
assignment of its last Army division to the primarily 
German-French Eurocorps. 
  Germany will assign primarily the 1st Armored Division to 
the 
binational corps. In the new Army structure, this division 
comprises the three armored infantry brigades 1, 19, and 32, all 
of which are partially manned. This structure--both on the 
Netherlands and on the German side--indicates that the troops of 
the joint corps are being assigned to the main defense forces, 
which will not grow to their planned authorized defensive 
strength until there is an appropriate increase in the partially 
manned units. 
<H5>  Special Use in Crises </H5>
  In normal peacetime, Germany will also assign to the joint 
corps the 6th Armored Infantry Division in Schleswig-Holstein 
and the 7th Armored Division in Duesseldorf, both of which have 
been assigned to the 1st Corps. In case of crises or conflicts, 
a different use if foreseen for both units. The 7th Armored 
Division, with its two fully manned brigades-the Armored 
Instruction Brigade 9 and the Armored Brigade 21--belongs in any 
case to the rapid-deployment crisis-reaction forces and as such 
forms the principal part of the German contingent for the Allied 
Rapid-Reaction Corps, NATO's rapid intervention force under 
British command. On the other hand, according to existing plans 
the 6th Armored Infantry Division, with its two partially manned 
brigades--the Armored Infantry Brigade 7 and the Armored Brigade 
18--will continue, for the time being, to be under the command 
of the German-Danish Landjut Corps.

<F P=106> [Philip Stephens report: "Major Urges Tories To Sink Their </F>
Differences for EU Poll"] 
  [Text] Mr John Major yesterday sought to cover the latest 
cracks in the Conservative party over Europe by pledging to 
promote the cause of "Euro-realism" in the run-up to the June 
elections for the Strasbourg parliament. 
  His attempt to rebuild a facade of unity between the party's 
enthusiasts and sceptics was accompanied by a renewed warning 
from Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, that the party 
could not go back on its historic commitment to Europe. 
  Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, 
meanwhile accused the party's sceptics of "undermining the prime 
minister" and damaging the Conservatives' chances in next week's 
local elections. He said party workers would be appalled at the 
behaviour of some Tory MPs. 
  In a clear message to those on the Tory right at Westminster 
who have suggested Britain could disengage from the European 
Union [EU], Mr Hurd said that talk of withdrawal was "out of 
touch with reality." He told a Conservative meeting in 
Plymouth: "Our party took Britain into the European Community 
in the 1970s. Anybody seeking to reverse that decision now is 
out of touch with reality, and with all the questions of 
politics and security which western Europe will have to tackle 
in the years ahead." 
  Mr Major offered the same message on a local election tour 
in 
Bury when he underlined the economic and security interests 
tying Britain to the EU. 
  But refusing to be labelled either a Europhile or a 
Europhobe, Mr Major stressed that a commitment to a leading role 
for Britain in the EU did not mean accepting every suggestion or 
plan from Brussels. Instead Britain would argue the case for 
Euro-realism. 
  As both men laid out a strategy designed to unite all but 
the 
most extreme anti-Europeans, Mr Hurd stressed also that the 
Conservatives were the only party opposed to a centralised 
federal Europe. 
  Mr Hurd, dismissing suggestions that Mr Major had sought to 
appease the Tory right by giving the election manifesto a more 
sceptical tone, suggested that 90 per cent of the Tory party 
would offer whole-hearted support for the government's platform. 
  Trailing the party's manifesto for the June campaign, Mr 
Hurd 
said its belief in a free trading, decentralised, 
outward-looking Europe was reflected increasingly in the mood in 
the rest of the EU. 
  He said the Liberal Democrats, the main threat to the 
Conservatives in south-west England, were, like the Labour 
party, wedded to the Brussels centralism which would lead to a 
European superstate. 
  But ministers acknowledged that the attempt by Tory 
Eurosceptics to seize the initiative threatened a constant 
series of potential upsets in a campaign which could be critical 
to Mr Major's future as prime minister.

<F P=106> [Press release issued by the Prime Minister's Office: </F>
"Statement by the Governments of the United Kingdom and Germany: 
Joint Projects for Security-Related Cooperation"] 
  [Text] Germany and the United Kingdom will be putting a 
proposal to Hungary for a trilateral peacekeeping exercise to be 
held in 1995. It would take place within the framework of 
Partnership for Peace. We intend to involve the NATO authorities 
fully in the planning and would hope to include arrangements for 
suitable participation by other interested partners. 
  To reflect our strong support for the U.S./Russia/Ukraine 
trilateral agreements and our commitment to a successful outcome 
for this enterprise, Germany and the United Kingdom will 
continue to participate actively in the coordination of national 
efforts to help Ukraine achieve the elimination of all nuclear 
weapons on her soil. We will share with each other information 
and experience arising from our respective programmes of 
assistance, with a view to maximising the contribution we can 
make thereby to our shared goal of security and cooperative 
relations throughout this region. 
  We will engage also in a close exchange of views about 
experience already gained, especially in German retraining and 
housing progranunes for Ukrainian military personnel. The 
structures already established in the course of these programmes 
lend themselves to future efforts in these fields. 
  Our traditional Anglo-German Seminar of the two ministries 
of 
defence, which is scheduled with high ranking participation for 
next January at the Fuhrungsakademie in Hamburg, this time will 
also focus on our relations with Central and Eastern European 
countries. The theme for discussion will reflect the new quality 
of cooperation. It is our common intention and understanding 
that participation will include representatives from partner 
countries.

<F P=106> [Press release issued by the UK Ministry of Defense: </F>
"Defence Agreement With Romania"] 
  [Text] Malcolm Rifkind, The Secretary of State for Defence 
today met Mr. Gheorghe Tinca, the Romanian Defence Minister and 
signed a Memorandum of Understanding [MOU] covering a programme 
of defence contracts between the United Kingdom and Romania for 
1994 and 1995. 
  The MOU provides for a number of military contacts and 
exchanges with the aim of developing jointly areas of practical 
co-operation on a wide range of defence-related matters. 
  This is the first time a Romanian Defence Minister has 
visited the United Kingdom since the break-up of the Warsaw Pact. 
  Mr. Tinca's visit, and the signing of the MOU, is seen as a 
part of the ongoing process of strengthening security and 
stability in Europe, and is entirely in line with the ethos of 
the recently unveiled Partnership for Peace initiative. Both 
nations welcome Partnership for Peace as a useful means of 
building a closer relationship between NATO and countries of 
Central and Eastern Europe. 
  Whilst in London Mr. Tinca will have discussions with, 
amongst others, Admiral Sir Jock Slater, Vice Chief of the 
Defence Staff and Mr. Moray Stewart, Second Permanent Under 
Secretary. He will also visit Royal United Services Institute 
and have talks with representatives of the UK Defence Industry. 
  Mr Rifkind said: "I am very pleased that a MOU covering 
bilateral defence contacts has been agreed. Its signature 
should herald a new phase of more structured and substantial 
co-operation between us."

<F P=106> [Article by Peter Beaumont and Paul Beaver: "RAF Set To Quit </F>
Germany"] 
  [Text] Senior officers and planners in the RAF [Royal Air 
Force] have given their support to a money-saving plan to pull 
all British combat aircraft and helicopters out of Germany, 
ending a presence stretching back almost half a century. 
  The proposal -- contained in confidential six-page document 
seen by THE OBSERVER -- is the most radical to emerge from a 
series of 33 defence studies aimed at reducing the 24 billion 
pounds sterling defence expenditure by 1 billion pounds sterling 
over the next three years. 
  THE OBSERVER understands that if the plan wins ministerial 
and Cabinet approval the squadrons would pull out of Germany by 
April 1996, the deadline for the latest round of defence cuts 
known as `Front Line First'. 
  Sources say the proposal has already cleared its first 
hurdle, gaining the reluctant acceptance of senior members of 
the Air Staff as the least painful option in the face of the 
threat of `acute cuts'. 
  One source said: `Senior officers I have spoken to have 
given 
their support to this plan. The feeling is that there is no 
downside to this proposal except in conditions of service for 
RAF personnel.' 
  NATO would have no power of veto, although it would probably 
insist that the withdrawn squadrons remain earmarked for NATO 
operations. RAF sources emphasised that fighters could defend 
NATO's eastern borders just as effectively from bases in Britain 
as from bases in Germany. 
  Disclosure of the plan to leave Germany -- which would see 
the withdrawal of almost 80 fighter aircraft and 6,000 personnel 
-- is the latest in a series of leaks on deliberations over the 
shape of Britain's armed forces, despite efforts to prevent word 
getting out about possible cuts under consideration. 
  A wholesale RAF withdrawal would come after the United 
States's decisions to scale back its military commitments in 
Germany. It would also allow the closure of a number of British 
airbases in Germany under the last round of cuts, Options for 
Chance, particularly Laarbruch and Wildenrath. 
  Detailed discussions about the future of the RAF squadrons 
in 
Germany first emerged two years ago in the aftermath of the 
collapse of communism. 
  According to one senior RAF source: ``It was a plan that 
gained quite a head of steam when Germany was threatening to 
pull out of the Eurofighter programme and there was a feeling we 
sould be beastly to them. Then when relations with Chancellor 
(Helmut) Kohl warmed it was quietly dropped. 
  ``Now it has been picked up again. The Treasury is keen 
because of the money it will save. It is an expensive business 
keeping the RAF overseas, and bringing them back to Britain 
would help with foreign currency and the costs of keeping the 
bases running and the families abroad. 
  ``As far as the RAF is concerned it would make sense as it 
is 
becoming more and more difficult to carry out low-flying 
exercises in Germany because of local protests, and it would 
take the pressure off other areas of spending. 
  ``In terms of the international situation, things have come 
on a long way since the reunification of Germany and there is a 
feeling that if we did need to go back it would not be that 
difficult.'' 
  The biggest problem facing the RAF would be where to put the 
returning aircraft and personnel, with British bases already 
overstretched. 
  The review of the RAF's overseas commitments follows 
pressure 
to reduce the overall number of front-line squadrons by 15 per 
cent to around 22 squadrons. 
  Under the proposal, the remaining squadrons would be 
increased from 12 to 18 aircraft -- the NATO standard size for a 
squadron. 
  There is a widespread belief in both the Treasury and in the 
other services that the RAF -- which escaped the worst of the 
cuts suffered by the Army and the Navy in Options for Change -- 
is vulnerable.

<F P=106> [Press release issued by the UK Ministry of Defense: </F>
"Statement on the Defence Estimates 1994"] 
  [Text] Malcolm Rifkind, Secretary of State for Defence, has 
today announced publication of the 1994 Statement on Defence 
Estimates. 
  The 1994 White Paper reports on the achievements of the 
armed 
forces and the Department, as well as building on the theme of 
previous post-Cold War Statements -- the evolution of Britain's 
defence policy, and the restructuring of its armed forces in 
response to the changing strategic setting. 
  Mr. Rifkind points out that the restructuring programme 
under 
Options for Change, which is now nearing completion, "has not 
altered the fact that our armed forces remain world class." He 
added that "we continue our efforts to ensure the greatest 
military output for the money we devote to defence." 
  The White Paper also emphasises that it is the Government's 
firm intention, against the background of the Defence Costs 
Study ("Front Line First"), to maintain Britain's front line 
capabilities.

<F P=106> [Richard Norton-Taylor report: "Opposition Fails To Life </F>
GCHQ Ban"] 
  [Text] Demands by opposition leaders yesterday for an end 
to the union ban at GCHQ [Government Communications 
Headquarters] the Government's intelligence-gathering centre, 
were rejected when an opposition move to restore union rights 
was defeated by 283 votes to 222 a government majority of 61. 
  John Cunningham, the shadow foreign secretary, told the 
House 
of Commons the Government had never explained its assertion that 
union membership led to a "conflict of loyalties." 
  He accused the Government of "mulish obstinacy" -- members 
of 
unions worked on sensitive, secret work at the Ministry of 
Defence, the Cabinet Office and Whitehall's Joint Intelligence 
Committee. 
  The Labour/Liberal Democrat amendment to the Intelligence 
Services Bill fell at the start of the debate on its report 
stage. 
  Alex Carlile, Liberal Democrat MP for Montgomery accused the 
Government of "tilting at invented windmills." He referred to 
the case of John Cook, one of 14 GCHQ staff dismissed for 
refusing to give up their union rights. Mr Cook, a former cipher 
clerk, was later honoured for his work during the Falklands War. 
  Labour leaders tabled amendments designed to strengthen the 
accountability of the security and intelligence agencies. 
  Under the bill, a committee of parliamentarians is, for the 
first time, to monitor the three main security and intelligence 
agencies -- M15, M16 and GCHQ. 
  It is expected to be chaired by Tom King, the former defence 
secretary, and will consist of five Tory members, three Labour 
and one Liberal Democrat. 
  The committee has a limited role "to examine the 
expenditure, 
administration and policy" of the three agencies. It will not 
have the power to call for papers and persons, and witnesses 
will not be required to give evidence on oath. The Government 
has strict control over information provided to the committee, 
which will have no staff of its own.

<F P=106> [Article by Tim Coone and David Owen: "Reynolds Calls For </F>
Peace Push"] 
  [Text] The British and Irish governments must push the 
Northern Ireland peace process forward on a bilateral basis in 
the absence of political developments in the province, Mr Albert 
Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said yesterday. 
  Addressing backbenchers from the British and Irish 
parliaments at a meeting of the interparliamentary body in 
Dublin, Mr Reynolds said he remained hopeful that last 
December's joint declaration would produce results -- but added 
that he was disappointed with progress to date. 
  There had been "little new evidence" that the two 
communities 
in the province were likely to reach agreement if "left to 
themselves." The two governments would have to play a role "in 
encouraging, and maybe to some degree formulating an outline of 
an agreement between them," he said. The joint declaration made 
both governments "effectively persuaders for an agreement." 
  Earlier this month Mr Reynolds revealed that the two 
governments had begun drafting a "framework document" around 
which a future political settlement might be built. 
  But in his clearest acknowledgement yet that the peace 
process has in effect stalled, Mr Reynolds cast doubt on whether 
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, has the coherence and 
unity to deliver on its stated desire for a peace deal, and 
called for a more "enlightened" leadership from the unionist 
parties. 
  He added that both governments "would be anxious and willing 
to break the present impasse" if Sinn Fein made clear what 
issues it still wanted clarified. 
  His remarks came as Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland 
secretary, urged Sinn Fein to specify in what respects they 
believed the document to be unclear. 
  The government had had to conclude that what "clarification" 
really meant was "renegotiation," Sir Patrick said. "We are not 
getting into that," he said. "Nor are the Irish government." 
  Sir Patrick said that the declaration's non-partisan 
approach 
meant nobody needed to fear that their position would be 
"ignored or excluded." The ending of violence in Northern 
Ireland was "a prize that threatens no one." He added: "It 
should relegate confrontation to the past."

  [Text] Bonn -- One of the three German CH-53 Bundeswehr 
helicopters used for UN missions in Iraq has been out of 
operation following a stone-throwing attack by an angry mob on 
27 March. This was confirmed by a Defense Ministry spokesman on 
Friday [29 April]. 
  The transport helicopter, which takes inspectors and other 
UN 
personnel to operation sites, was to pick up two Austrian blue 
helmets in Mossul and evacuate them to Kuwait. On the landing 
field next to Mossul hospital, some 20 UN blue helmets securing 
the area were overrun by an angry crowd. The crew and the two 
Austrians saved themselves with a speedy takeoff, but they had 
to touch down in Baghdad, where three windows were found to be 
cracked and one of the two engines and the rotor blades damaged. 
  As there was no imminent danger, the matter was treated as a 
technical accident at the time and thus the incident was not 
reported to the public, the spokesman said. He pointed out that 
every UN flight is agreed upon by the Iraqi Foreign Ministry.

  [Text] Bonn -- At a Western-Russian foreign ministers' 
conference a general cease-fire should be agreed with the 
Bosnian parties to the conflict, and the path for a political 
solution should be cleared. This was proposed by Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev today after talks with his 
German counterpart Klaus Kinkel. No date has yet been set for 
the foreign ministers' conference. During his exchange of views 
with Kinkel, Kozyrev stated that a military intervention should 
only be the very last resort. The Serbs should know that there 
is a limit that must not be exceeded. Kozyrev mentioned the 
shelling of the hospital in Gorazde in this respect.

  [Text] Bonn -- During his visit to Bonn today, Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev presented plans for a major 
foreign ministers' conference on Bosnia and underlined Moscow's 
readiness for cooperation on the basis of partnership. After an 
exchange of views with Klaus Kinkel, which lasted for 
approximately three hours, Kozyrev left it open whether the 
parties to the conflict should participate in the conference. 
On the other hand, however, he stated that a comprehensive 
cease-fire agreement should be concluded with the parties to the 
conflict at this meeting "in the near future," and that a 
political solution should be initiated. 
  Apart from the United States and Russia, France, Great 
Britain, the United Nations, and the "troika" of the three 
leading members of the European Union, Belgium, Greece, and 
Germany will probably participate in the conference. Kozyrev 
arrived in Germany after holding talks in Geneva and Paris. 
  After a working lunch at the government's guest house in 
Petersberg near Bonn, Kinkel expressed the hope that the 
conference would be held "in the near future." Russia must 
continue be involved in the peace efforts and exert influence on 
the Serbian side. It must be clear that "aggression is not 
rewarded." Referring to the state visit by President Boris 
Yeltsin in two weeks' time, Kinkel spoke of "untroubled and good 
relations." 
  Kozyrev expressed satisfaction with the West, stressing that 
military intervention should only be the very last resort. 
There are also limits for the Serbs that must not be exceeded. 
One such limit was the shelling of the hospital of Gorazde. 
Officials close to the Russian foreign minister openly warned 
against attacking the Serbs because this might "mobilize an 
entire people." 
  The first step of the proposed foreign ministers' conference 
will be the determination of safety zones in Bosnia. After this 
measure, the next political solutions must be specifically 
initiated. Afterward a summit meeting of all parties involved 
can be convened, Kozyrev, who has departed for Moscow, stressed.

  [Text] Stuttgart (DPA) -- Daimler-Benz Chief Edzard Reuter 
and PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat have agreed on more intensive 
cooperation, above all in border-crossing infrastructure 
projects. This was announced by Reuter, who had invited 'Arafat 
for a one-day visit to Stuttgart, in a talk with journalists on 
Monday [2 May]. "We at Daimler-Beinz are convinced that the 
peace process in the Middle East can be consolidated through the 
contribution of European companies," Reuter said. The meeting 
with 'Arafat is a good starting point for the accelerated 
expansion of economic cooperation. 
  Reuter promised his guest that a development study would be 
drawn up to solve the infrastructure and traffic problems in 
Palestine as a gift. The study will compiled by the 
corporation's subsidiary Donier Management Consulting. 'Arafat, 
who said that economic recovery is one of the most important 
bases for the pace process in the Middle East, accepted the gift 
with thanks. 'Arafat came to Stuttgart two days before the 
planned signing of the Gaza-Jericho autonomy agreement.

  [Text] Koenigswinter (DPA) -- The Dalai Lama has 
encouraged the FRG to take over responsibility in international 
politics. He hopes that, as a result of its special historical 
development, Germany will play an important role in establishing 
world peace, the secular and spiritual head of Tibet said in 
Koenigswinter near Bonn on Saturday [30 April]. 
  The Dalai Lama, who has lived in exile in India for 35 
years, 
pointed to the "particularly friendly relations" between Germany 
and China. However, this should not lead to a strong tolerance 
toward the Chinese Government. Germany has the opportunity to 
influence Chinese policy. The 58-year-old man stressed that 
awareness of the special situation in his homeland is widespread 
among the German public. 
  The Nobel Peace Prize laureate affirmed his path of 
nonviolence. "I am, on principle, against the use of weapons." 
This is also the basis of the support granted to the Tibetan 
people by the world public. The Dalai Lama is paying a 
three-day visit to Germany on the invitation of the 
Friedrich-Naumann Foundation, which is affiliated with the Free 
Democratic Party of Germany.

  [Text] Brussels -- Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his Social 
Democratic challenger in the next Bundestag elections, Rudolf 
Scharping, have advocated the enlargement of the European Union 
[EU] in Brussels today. A few days before the decision by the 
European Parliament on the accession treaties with Austria, 
Sweden, Finland, and Norway, Kohl sent a letter to the Socialist 
Group in the European Parliament, pleading for a "yes" vote. 
  Scharping appealed directly to his party friends in Brussels 
to make use of the "opportunity for Europe." At the close of 
his two-day visit to Brussels, he stressed that he does not want 
to abandon the "basic orientations" of German foreign policies. 
  In his letter, which is available to DPA, to the head of the 
Social Democratic Group in the European Parliament, Jean-Pierre 
Cot, Kohl emphasized the "extraordinary significance" of the 
decision on 5 May "for the entire work of European unification." 
Addressing skeptics who only want to make a decision on the 
acceptance of new members if the European Parliament is granted 
more rights, Kohl wrote: "You can rest assured that I will do 
everything to ensure that, with a view to the 1996 government 
conference, a working group is installed consisting of 
representatives of the governments and members of the European 
Parliament with the participation of the Commission." 
  The heads of state and government of the "Twelve" want to 
set 
up a working group at their summit meeting in Corfu in June to 
prepare the reform of the institution as the Union grows. The 
reform is to be adopted in 1996. 
  The Social Democrats -- the largest group in the European 
Parliament -- proceed from the premise that majority of deputies 
will support the enlargement -- "in spite of justified 
criticism," as Klaus Hoensch, the deputy leader of the Social 
Democratic Group, added. 
  After meetings with Commission President Jacques Delors and 
NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner, Scharping stressed in 
Brussels that "there is no need for questioning the basic 
orientations of German foreign policy just because of the 
election campaign." He also advocates European integration, a 
"particularly friendly relationship with the United States," 
NATO as an "indispensable element of security," and reliable 
cooperation with neighbors in the East.

  [Text] Bonn -- Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel has promised 
Romania the support of the Federal Government on its path toward 
the European Union [EU] and the transatlantic security 
structures. During a meeting with the Romanian Parliamentary 
President Adrian Nastase in Bonn today, Kinkel encouraged 
Romania to continue the political and economic reform process. 
The chairman of the economic committee of the Bundestag, 
Friedhelm Ost, also promised the Romanian politician that he 
will try to ensure a stronger commitment by the German industry. 
  Development Minister Carl-Dieter Spranger and the 
parliamentary state secretary in the Interior Ministry, Horst 
Waffenschmidt, will travel to Romania next week. Kinkel stated 
that he will also visit the country in the near future.

  [Text] Bonn/New York -- Bonn diplomats have reacted "very 
coolly" today to criticism by New Zealand concerning Germany's 
application for a seat in the UN Security Council. It is known 
that Germany wants a permanent seat in the highest 
decisionmaking body of the United Nations -- this has been 
repeatedly pointed out by Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Foreign 
Minister Klaus Kinkel -- and the Federal Government "is in close 
contact with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali on this 
issue," a short statement stressed. 
  It was apparently considered embarrassing that, first, the 
criticism came from New Zealand Foreign Minister Don McKinnon, 
and, second, that McKinnon made his statement on Wednesday 
evening [27 April] as acting president of the Security Council. 
He described Japan as a "logical candidate" and expressed 
reservations vis-a-vis Germany, pointing out that there would be 
"too many white faces" if the Germans joined the UN Security 
Council. 
  The implementation of Germany's claim, which results from 
the 
changed world political map, will be difficult and only possible 
on a long-term basis because a decision must be made by the 
General Assembly -- after the presentation of the structural 
reform that does not yet exist. The secretary general is not 
entitled to vote. The 15-nation body has had five permanent 
members since 1945: The United States, Russia, China, France, 
and Great Britain. These five states also enjoy the right of 
veto in all decisions.

  [Excerpts] Berlin -- Russia continues to demand a joint 
farewell ceremony for all troops of the World War II anti-Hitler 
coalition in Berlin. It would be sensible to say farewell to 
the troops of Russia, the United States, Great Britain, and 
France in a joint ceremony in Berlin, the supreme commander of 
the Western Group of Russian Forces, Burlakov, told journalists 
in Berlin on Friday [29 April]. 
  Burlakov is not content with the planned farewell ceremony 
in 
the Weimar national theater and at the monument to the Russian 
Forces in Berlin-Treptow, which is to be attended by Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin and Chancellor Helmut Kohl. The main 
reason for his objection is the proximity of the former 
Buchenwald concentration camp near Weimar. It would be a 
sacrilege "to dance in that place." [passage omitted] 
  Burlakov said he is "very concerned" about housing and the 
troops' reintegration in their home country. While withdrawal 
from German territory is on schedule, housing construction lags 
far behind. A total of 48,824 families have left Germany 
without having apartments to got to in Russia. Under the 
housing program funded by Germany, of the planned 32 housing 
estates with 34,982 apartments, only six estates with 9,080 
apartments have been built over the last nine months.

  [Text] Paris (DPA) -- On Friday evening [29 April] in 
Paris Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] Chairman Rudolf 
Scharping called for a more active European policy by the German 
and the French governments. Regarding economic, monetary, and 
financial policy, Germany and France "must make sure that they 
switch to an economic offensive," Scharping said during a 
meeting with Socialist Party Chairman Michel Rocard. 
  The European Union must play a bigger role, and Bonn and 
Paris must coordinate their foreign and security policy more 
closely. German-French friendship must be expanded. "The status 
quo must not just be preserved," Scharping said. 
  Rocard, who enters the European election campaign as the top 
candidate of the French Socialists, said that things are going 
pretty well between Germany and France: "So well that one can 
still do more against unemployment and for an efficient Europe." 
  Scharping wished Rocard, who is strinving to become French 
president in 1995, "as much success as possible." So far, the 
German-French relationship has "not" been determined "by party 
policy constellations." "However, common thinking, common 
feeling, and common values are beneficial for the development 
into the future," Scharping said. Rocard paid tribute to the 
SPD chairman as a "man of principles and ethics." 
  In view of the election successes of the neofascists in 
Italy, Scharping vehemently came out in favor of a "complete 
isolation" of parliamentarians and miters of right-wing 
extremist and neo-fascist parties in Europe. "Any decent 
person...must contribute to having neo-fascism, 
xenophobia...socially and politically ostracized," Scharping 
said.

  [Text] Munich -- Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt has 
warned against a weakening of the multilateral international 
trading system. He is concerned that the United States "wants 
to force trade concessions by means of one-sided sanctions," 
Rexrodt said in Munich on Friday [29 April] at the annual 
meeting of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Germany. The 
multilateral trading system is the "indispensable umbrella, also 
for regional associations." 
  Rexrodt was optimistic that economic relations between 
Europe 
and the United States will be further expanded in 1994. He said 
he is thinking of multilateral agreements in the fields of 
steel, civil aviation, and financial services. Also, a 
multilateral agreement on restricting subsidies to the 
shipbuilding industry should be concluded in the near future. 
Rexrodt thinks that eastern Germany could be particularly 
important in the expansion of German-U.S. trade relations. This 
mainly has to do with East European markets being "right on our 
doorstep." 
  According to Rexrodt, there are over 1,400 U.S. companies 
represented in Germany at the moment, 275 of them in the new 
laender. They have created or preserved 50,000 jobs there and 
invested more than 8 billion German marks.

  [Text] The Berlin public prosecutor has decided to charge 
a former Syrian diplomat, Nabil Chritah [name as received], with 
carrying out the bomb attack on the French cultural center 
Maison de France. DPA learned this from judicial circles today. 
Chritah, who is being accused of aiding and abetting murder, 
arrived in Germany under mysterious circumstances at the 
beginning of January and was arrested and temporarily held. At 
the same time, charges were brought against a Stasi official 
from the department dealing with the fight against terrorism. 
One person was killed and 23 injured in the attack, which took 
place 11 years ago on 25 August 1983. 
  A Berlin justice spokeswoman, Uta Filster, confirmed that 
two 
defendants will be charged with aiding and abetting murder, but 
she refused to go into detail. 
  As recently as in mid-April, a former Stasi lieutenant, 
Helmut Voigt (51), was sentenced to four years imprisonment by 
the Berlin court for aiding and abetting the attack. The court 
considered it proven that Voigt at least passed on the order to 
hand over the explosives for the attack to a suspected German 
terrorist, Johannes Weinrich. 
  The Stasi official now facing charges is believed to have 
passed on the explosives to Weinrich, as ordered by Voigt. 
According to the public prosecutor, at the Syrian Embassy in 
East Berlin Weinrich deposited the explosives with Chritah, who 
is now being indicted. Weinrich, who is believed to belong to 
the international terrorist group "Carlos," picked up the 
explosives again on the day when the attack was carried out. 
  It has become known that Chritah was allegedly lured to 
Budapest by the German authorities. A security official 
reportedly made it clear to him that he cannot return to his 
home country because of his participation in the attack. In the 
trial against Voigt, Chritah testified amid tight security 
measures -- he was protected by a screen. He stressed that 
Syria is fighting terrorists. 
  However, according to findings by German security 
authorities, Weinrich and "Carlos" lived in the Syrian capital 
Damascus at least until the middle of last year. The Federal 
Government has asked Syria several times to extradite the two 
suspected terrorists against whom, because of the murder, an 
arrest warrant was issued by the court in Berlin-Tiergarten 10 
years ago.

  [Text] Hamburg (DPA) -- The economic low point has been 
overcome in many countries in Eastern and Central Europe. This 
applies, above all, to the pioneers of reform -- the Czech 
Republic, Poland, and Hungary -- but also to Slovenia, Estonia, 
and, a bit farther behind, also to Slovakia, the Eastern and 
Central Europe Association (OMV) announced in Hamburg at its 
members' meeting on Thursday [28 April]. The importance of 
Eastern Europe for German foreign trade has increased. Foreign 
trade turnover with this region increased by at least 6 percent 
in 1993 to 88.2 billion German marks, while foreign trade as a 
whole decreased by 10 percent, the OMV annual report says. The 
share of trade with Eastern Europe in Germany's total foreign 
trade amounted to 7.7 percent. 
  The association is confident that the positive effects of 
trade and cooperation on economic growth will increasingly 
benefit also the weaker economies and will thus support the 
reform process, the report says. This applies to the CIS 
countries, even though in particular in Russia inflation had 
declined by the end of 1993. Romaine and Bulgaria, for their 
part, are orienting themselves toward market economy but do not 
yet show any real success, the report says. Members of the OMV 
are all leading German companies which conduct trade with 
Eastern and Central Europe or produce goods there.

  [Text] Nuremberg (DPA) -- A Republikaner rally in 
Nuremberg's inner city on Saturday [30 April] took place without 
the feared clashes. The election campaign rally of the 
right-wing extremist party, which was accompanied by massive 
protest campaigns, was concluded at noon after about two hours. 
Police temporarily arrested about 60 persons, who are supposed 
to be released in the course of the day after their identity has 
been checked. About 200 demonstrators against the Republikaner 
formed a demonstration column through Nuremberg's inner city 
after the Republikaner rally. 
  As a result of the superiority, in terms of numbers, of the 
counter-demonstrators, the party's speakers could hardly be 
heard. However, according to policy, nothing happened apart from 
the throwing of a few eggs. The rally, which had been banned by 
the city of Nuremberg by referring to potential riots was 
permitted by the Bavarian Administrative Court on Friday after 
all. Before the rally almost 40 organizations had announced 
that they would stage protests and interference.

  [Text] Mannheim -- Interior Minister Manfred Kanther 
(Christian Democratic Union) continues to urge the conclusion of 
an agreement with Turkey that will protect activists of the 
banned Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] who are deported to 
Turkey from the death penalty in their home country. The goal 
of the agreement is to guarantee sufficiently to authorities 
dealing with foreigners and to the courts that the Kurds are not 
facing the death penalty in the event of their deportation, 
Kanther told journalists in Mannheim today. However, the PKK is 
no "Robin Hood group," but a criminal organization, "and is 
being treated as such in Germany." 
  Kanther stressed that assurances by the Turkish Government 
that torture is not used by the state in dealing with people who 
think differently would be sufficient. The minister reported 
that after the ban of the PKK at the end of 1993, about 30 
affiliated organizations were also forbidden. The overwhelming 
majority of the Kurds living in Germany do not want to have 
anything to do with the PKK. 
  Bonn is interested in a peaceful settlement of the Kurdish 
issue in Turkey and feels sympathy for the maltreated people in 
the civil war zone. However, this has nothing to do with the 
prosecution of terrorism in Germany. "I do not care why 
somebody erects burning barricades on the roads. He is a 
criminal," the minister stressed.

Optimistic'"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 29 -- Prime Minister-designate 
Silvio Berlusconi, leaving his Roman residence this morning, 
told reporters he was "fairly optimistic" he could form a 
government in reasonable time. 
  His morning's agenda included meetings with Northern League 
representatives Umberto Bossi and Roberto Maroni, with life 
Senator Paolo Emilio Taviani, and with Rome Mayor Francesco 
Rutelli. 
  Asked about the controversy over the sensitive post of the 
Interior Ministry, the Forza Italia leader said that "We still 
have to go into all that but I don't see any insurmountable 
problems." 
  His Northern League allies have pressed to obtain that post, 
but other political forces have vetoed that, saying the League 
could open up a Pandora's box if they got their hands on 
sensitive police and security roles and files. 
  The list of potential ministers was "still up in the air," 
he 
said. 
  Formal consultations on the cabinet are slated to begin 
Monday [2 May].

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Berlusconi, Partners Meet on </F>
Ministerial Hurdle"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 29 -- Premier-designate and Forza 
Italia leader Silvio Berlusconi this afternoon began meeting 
with his two main government partners aimed at clearing the last 
major hurdle to the formation of the new right-wing government: 
ministerial appointments. 
  Going into the meeting, Berlusconi said that the names "will 
not be based on a share-out" with his partners in the League and 
the neofascist National Alliance. "The most able people will be 
chosen, otherwise what change will there be? There is no 
disagreement on the programme and that is very important," he 
said, expressing "optimism" that the League would show "good 
sense." 
  Northern League leader Umberto Bossi expressed confidence of 
claiming the Interior Ministry, for which the League has been 
long pressing. He said the meeting would also examine points in 
the programme. 
  National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini reiterated that his 
party will allow Berlusconi to have a free hand in the naming of 
ministers, as laid down in Article 92 of the Constitution, but 
said the three forces have a lot of talking to do on the 
programme, where he will be pressing to keep social welfare 
provisions in place and for solidarity between the rich north 
and the poorer south. "When we are agreed on the programme I 
will give Berlusconi the National Alliance names I think can do 
a ministerial job," he said. 
  He said Bossi's "slapping vetos and claiming strategic 
ministries" harked back to the days when ministers were 
appointed on the basis of party strength, adding that "all the 
forces in the coalition have the same dignity." 
  He accused the opponents of the right of trying to "raise a 
political dust-storm" out of a National Alliance request to 
revise the 1975 Osimo Treaty on border relations with the former 
Yugoslavia ("which will not immediately enter the government's 
programmes"), despite the fact that they were "well aware that 
the revision of a treaty can only take place via diplomatic, 
bilateral channels." He described the alarms about National 
Alliance in government aired in France, Greece and Belgium as 
propaganda by "left-wing activists" in the run-up to the 
European elections. 
  He voiced the hope that Italy's broadcasting law will be 
changed by the incoming parliament without the need for a 
referendum -- for which signatures are now being collected -- 
and said the right was ready to take to the streets like the 
left, "in democratic and civilised" fashion, in defence of its 
positions. 
  A leader of Berlusconi's other smaller partners, the 
Christian Democratic Centre, expressed "complete faith" in 
Berlusconi and called on all the components of the coalition to 
demonstrate a break with the past and put away "vetoes and 
trials of strength." He noted with satisfaction that one of the 
premier-designate's first moves, creating a Ministry for the 
Family, "shows he will carry forward those Catholic values that 
are dear to us." 
  Separately, Northern League veteran Luigi Rossi said 
Berlusconi's remark, "I'm the one who names the ministers," 
amplified in a newspaper headline this morning, "smacked of 
(Fascist dictator Benito) Mussolini." 
  Earlier, asked if he would sign a referendum on repealing 
Italy's broadcasting law that allowed him to keep hold of 
roughly half of national TV, Berlusconi said "as a broadcaster I 
would sign it immediately...but as premier I have to reflect." 
  The large opposition Democratic Party of the Left criticised 
Berlusconi's naming of the committee of "three wise men" -- 
Antonio La Pergola, Giorgio Crisci, Agostino Gambino -- to sort 
out his conflict of interest problem. It said the move was 
"lacking in substance" and put off a solution that might have 
been expected to come from Berlusconi himself "clearly 
separating himself from his private interests" upon his 
reception of the government-formation mandate. 
  The organ of the small Republican Party took the same line, 
asking for a "clear response" on what is to be done while the 
three legal experts are drawing up their formula. 
  But Berlusconi's partner Fini expressed "great satisfaction" 
in the three experts, describing them as "men of the utmost 
morality and great quality." 
  Earlier, Berlusconi enjoyed a cordial meeting with Rome's 
Progressive mayor, Francesco Rutelli, assuring him the 
government would have "a special regard" for the capital. 
  In other political events today, the last premier, Carlo 
Azeglio Ciampi, 73, reversed speculation that he would continue 
in politics and claimed his government had marked a break with 
the past by keeping party politics out of the day-to-day running 
of the country. 
  Former electoral reform hero Mario Segni accused the four 
MP's who left his tiny Pact for Italy yesterday to form a group 
closer to Forza Italia of "betraying the voters."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Berlusconi on Interior Ministry, </F>
Business Links"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 26 -- It may be possible for two 
people to head the Interior Ministry, according to Silvio 
Berlusconi, who on Tuesday [26 April] shrugged off growing calls 
that he divest from his financial empire. 
  Berlusconi, who according to all observers will be given a 
mandate tomorrow to form a new government, told reporters one 
solution to the political wrangling over who will control the 
Interior Ministry may be to separate "what concerns local 
administrations from the ministry's other competences," adding: 
"I think a solution may also be found in this direction." 
  The Northern League has been clamoring to be given the 
Interior Ministry portfolio in a new right-wing government led 
by Berlusconi's Forza Italia and presumably including the 
neo-Fascist National Alliance; the coalition may also include 
right-wing Christian Democrats (renamed Christian Democratic 
Center) and the tiny party led by Marco Pannella. 
  Berlusconi also replied to persistent questioning about his 
continuing ownership of the Fininvest Group by saying that "good 
sense" should be enough to avoid any conflicts of interest. 
  "I still do not have a convincing solution but I would say 
that the solution probably lies in good sense," he said, 
referring to growing calls, especially from the opposition, for 
legislation making it impossible for the head of government to 
control any part of the media. 
  Fininvest controls three of the country's most popular 
television networks, a major publishing house, advertising, 
construction and insurance groups. 
  According to Berlusconi, a government is "under the eye and 
judgment of all every day" and therefore passing judgment on 
only one person in that government "would not be logical." 
  Berlusconi said he believed his "personality" and his "civic 
passion" should be sufficient guarantees against conflicts of 
interest. 
  He apparently believes the system does not need improving 
and 
said, referring to the guarantees his personality and commitment 
have to offer: "If it is not possible, then there will be all 
the members of government who will be able to judge my every 
move, then there is parliament, with its opposition, which has 
the task of controlling and watching the action of the 
government and of the majority." In addition, he then said, 
pointing to the reporters from his own and competing networks, 
"there is you, protagonists of information, and there is the 
public." 
  Furthermore, the president may always refuse to sign an act 
of parliament, preventing it from going into effect, Berlusconi 
said. In other words, "being submitted to a daily and severe 
examination by an infinite plurality of subjects is a total 
guarantee for a government," he explained. 
  As for television and radio, Berlusconi said a watchdog body 
already exists, with "very precise rules and regulations" 
concerning election coverage. As for the businesses themselves, 
the only thing to be watched closely, is "illicit earnings," 
which can emerge immediately simply through "criticism." 
  The likely head of Italy's next government said that placing 
his holdings in a blind trust would not be feasible and that all 
the other solutions proposed so far, including that of an 
ombudsmanship, "are not a good solution." 
  Berlusconi said forcing him do divest would in effect 
sanction a law saying that "whoever is a businessman cannot 
govern," and that "taken to its extreme, this could mean that 
whoever owns an apartment cannot govern, or that that whoever 
owns any company at all cannot govern." 
  Since "everyone is a holder of interests," according to 
Berlusconi's thought, the only thing to be watched is whether 
"one's government activities bring illicit gains" through 
conflicts of interest. Berlusconi said the entire issue of his 
mass media holdings has been "blown out of proportion" by his 
political adversaries and that what counts is "the judgment of 
voters."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Opposition Raises Its Head as </F>
Berlusconi's Hour Nears"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 28 --- The opposition Democratic 
Left and Green parties on Thursday [28 April] warned of alleged 
dangers to freedom of the press and possible conflicts of 
interest if President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro gives media magnate 
Silvio Berlusconi a mandate to form a government coalition, as 
he is widely expected to do later this afternoon. 
  At a press conference, Green spokesman Carlo Ripa Di Meana 
announced his group has issued an official protest to the Lower 
House speaker, claiming that a mandate to Berlusconi would 
violate current laws on conflicts of interest and appealed to 
the president "to reflect with all his wisdom to avoid an 
intolerable moral and political distortion." 
  Ripa Di Meana also claimed that Scalfaro, in private 
consultations with Green party officials, acknowledged that the 
March elections which swept Berlusconi's three-way coalition to 
victory were "unequal." "I quote directly, unequal," he 
repeated, referring to Berlusconi's ownership of the country's 
three largest private television networks, controlled by his 
Fininvest Group. 
  Pierluigi Capone, an attorney for the Greens, asserted that 
Berlusconi, being in control of three nationwide TV 
broadcasters, stands in violation of a 1957 law on conflicts of 
interest. He said "the army of Fininvest employees and 
officials who are filling up the Lower House" are in the same 
position. 
  Separately, Democratic Left Party Secretary Achille Occhetto 
said a mandate to Berlusconi "raises serious concerns" because 
"the Fininvest owner would assume political power and, at the 
same time, enormous economic power, especially power over 
information, something that has no equal in other countries." 
  Occhetto wondered whether "democratic guarantees will be 
respected, beginning with the right to information" under such 
conditions. 
  "We must prevent Fininvest from acting in the service of the 
executive," he added, claiming that the guarantees offered by 
the president are certainly part of his duties but not enough to 
guarantee plurality in mass media.

<F P=106> [Victorino Ruiz de Azua report: "Aznar Says Gonzalez Is </F>
Prepared To Ruin Country Rather Than Resign"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- The People's Party's strategy will not 
change over the next few months. It will remain centered on the 
economic crisis and political corruption, with the element -- 
added in the state of the nation debate -- of holding the prime 
minister directly responsible for both problems. This was 
confirmed by People's Party leader Jose Maria Aznar at the 
People's Party Standing Committee meeting yesterday. Aznar 
fired very heavy broadsides against Felipe Gonzalez, and went so 
far as to say that the head of government "is prepared to ride 
roughshod over the country provided that he does not resign." 
  The main opposition party will also hold CiU [Convergence 
and 
Union] and Jordi Pujol directly responsible for the 
impossibility of submitting a censure motion against the 
government. The People's Party leader was sparing of words at 
the Standing Committee meeting in Madrid, devoted almost 
exclusively to examining the outcome of the parliamentary debate. 
  Aznar expressed his impression that he "was in touch with 
the 
public" in the speech which he delivered in the Congress of 
Deputies. "We discussed the problems which interest the 
public," he stated, and the public "are aware that Gonzalez is 
the problem and that he must therefore go." 
  But, according to the People's Party leader, the prime 
minister "has a destabilizing stance, prepared to ride roughshod 
over the country and to create an extremely grave and absolutely 
uncontrollable institutional crisis rather than resign." 
  Following this diagnosis, Aznar called on his supporters to 
stay "calm in the face of any circumstance which may arise," and 
stated that one of the tasks awaiting them is to defend 
themselves against the biased impression that there are similar 
levels of corruption in all the parties, and to demonstrate that 
in this the People's Party members "are not the same as the 
Spanish Socialist Workers Party." 
  In addition, the People's Party has opened up a new line of 
argument in order to hold CiU and Jordi Pujol responsible for 
the impossibility of submitting a motion of censure against the 
government. The People's Party is responding in this way to the 
Catalan nationalists' attacks over the weekend. Pujol and 
Miquel Roca accused Aznar's party of being anti-Catalan 
nationalist, and called for not a single Catalan vote to be cast 
for its European slate. 
  The People's Party response is to try to increase the 
pressure on Pujol's coalition in order to ensure that its 
support for the government ends up having a cost at the polls. 
CiU's support for the government was one of the arguments put 
forward at the Standing Committee meeting to explain why 
recourse was not had to a censure motion. The other 
explanation, set forth by Secretary General Francisco Alvarez 
Cascos, is that a censure motion was of no interest to the 
People's Party itself. 
  "In the case of a censure motion, you debate and vote on the 
government's alternative blueprint," Alvarez Cascos stated. 
"What mattered to us now, what the public were demanding, and 
what mattered to the country was to debate the situation to 
which Gonzalez' government has led Spain; not what Spain would 
be like if the People's Party were in power." 
  Aznar's party did not wish to distract attention from the 
government's responsibilities in the corruption cases, or forgo 
inflicting severe damage, and did not do so. This is what 
Alvarez Cascos told his Standing Committee colleagues. For the 
future, the People's Party leaves the door open to a censure 
motion, but states that it it will cross the threshold only if 
there is a chance of Pujol and CiU moving. 
  The Standing Committee meeting was devoted almost entirely 
to 
the outcome of the parliamentary confrontation, which the 
People's Party deems a complete victory, taking as its basis the 
opinion polls published by EL PAIS following the last two state 
of the nation debates -- 1992's and last week's. Aznar's 
political stature, the party leadership believes, has grown 
during this time, and the impact of his speeches on public 
opinion has increased. 
  Also on the basis of the polls, the People's Party believes 
that an important change has occurred in the public's 
priorities, which endorses its strategy. Terrorism has 
disappeared from the first place among collective concerns. The 
two problems which now worry the Spanish people most are the 
economic crisis (51 percent of those consulted) and corruption 
(32 percent). Two years ago, the last-mentioned issue was cited 
in a predominant place by only 8 percent of those consulted.

<F P=106> [Interview with People's Party member Abel Matutes by </F>
Victorino R. de Azua in Madrid; date not given: "Matutes: 
`Today We Represent Modernity and Convergence With Europe'"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- He earned his first million kicking a 
soccer ball around for Espanol de Barcelona [soccer club]; at 
the same time he was studying law and economic science. He is 
proud to have created "about 4,000 jobs" with his companies. 
Abel Matutes, a 52-year-old Ibizan, married with four children, 
left his job as European commissioner for transport and energy 
on Wednesday [27 April] after handing in his resignation to 
Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez. Since yesterday, he is now 
merely the People's Party "number one" for the European 
Parliament [EP] elections. He returns from Brussels with some 
40 decorations of the highest order, awarded to him, as he 
explains with satisfaction, by many other countries for his 
contribution to international cooperation and the defense of 
democracy in countries as far away as Chile and the Philippines. 
  [de Azua] Are these elections bound to focus on the 
corruption scandals? 
  [Matutes] That is not my wish, and I hope they will not. The 
People's Party can win them outright through its own programs 
and by the fact that the best men and women are on our side, 
although the corruption issue will inevitably have an effect and 
will form a backcloth to the elections. 
  [de Azua] Will the People's Party win the elections because 
it is better than ever, or because the Spanish Socialist 
Workers' Party [PSOE] is at its lowest-ever ebb? 
  [Matutes] The result of any election can always be put down 
to a little of both, and always combines the merits of one party 
with the faults of the other. It is true that, at the moment, 
the PSOE has reached rock bottom, but it is also true that the 
People's Party is putting itself forward as a reliable and 
coherent alternative, with modern programs and in obvious 
harmony with the actions of neighboring governments. All this 
is being done under the clear and brilliant leadership of 
[People's Party leader] Jose Maria Aznar who currently enjoys 
undoubted popular support. 
  [de Azua] Could the apparent paralysis of the European plan 
not increase the abstention rate? How do you intend getting 
more people to vote? 
  [Matutes] The process of European construction has always 
slowed down in times of recession. Economic crisis always leads 
to "Europessimism" and "Eurosclerosis." The idea I am going to 
defend vigorously is that we need a strong Spain and a strong 
Europe. The People's Party today represents modernity and 
convergence with Europe. For as long as we contribute actively 
to European construction, we will be able to defend Spain's 
vital interests without any complexes. People must come to vote 
because, if they do not, they will have no right to complain 
about the representatives they find themselves lumbered with. 
  [de Azua] What sets you apart from the Socialists when it 
comes to representing the interests of the Spanish people? 
  [Matutes] There are basic aspects of European construction 
that are subject to state policy, and in this respect there are 
no major differences. However, the current government's policy 
is not bringing us into line with the rest of Europe -- quite 
the reverse: It is increasing the distance between us and 
Europe. As a party from the same political family that is in 
government in most European countries, we are the best placed to 
bring about this convergence and to defend Spain's vital 
interests. 
  [de Azua] But there has been a great deal of consensus where 
European construction is concerned, and perhaps the voter can 
see no clear difference between the People's Party's project and 
that of the PSOE. 
  [Matutes] I must stress that we cannot base our action 
solely 
on a romantic idea of European construction. We must take 
Spain's interests into account and defend them. In this way, in 
the long term, we can prevent the Spanish people from feeling 
overly frustrated. 
  [de Azua] Is the appointment of Celia Villalobos as your 
number two an attempt to compensate for your lack of popularity? 
  [Matutes] Naturally, I do not claim to be able to compete in 
the beauty stakes with the lovely Celia, and her appointment 
seems to me to have been very well received. However, even 
before it was known that she was to occupy such a high position, 
I was very high in the personality polls, with an especially 
good rating for my political profile and several points ahead of 
the Socialist Party. If Celia and the other candidates score 
highly in the popularity ratings, so much the better.

Leadership Insists Solchaga Does Not Have To Resign Yet"] 
  [Excerpt] Madrid - The scandals surrounding Mariano Rubio 
and Luis Roldan will not at the moment lead to resignations in 
the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party]. At the current 
state of the investigation, the party leadership does not 
consider there to be any political liability attached to former 
ministers Carlos Solchaga and Jose Luis Corcuera, during whose 
terms the irregularities were committed. This prevailing view 
in the Socialist executive was revealed at Monday's [25 April] 
meeting and confirmed in the course of the week. However, 
Secretary General Felipe Gonzalez has yet to make a statement: 
Everyone hopes he will do so today at the Federal Committee 
meeting convened to approve the electoral lists. [passage

<F P=106> [Article signed ZS: "European Energy Charter: Risk of </F>
Failure"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 28 Apr (ATS) -- The 50 signatory states, 
including Switzerland, to the European Energy Charter are having 
a difficult time trying to put their aims into practice. 
Netherlands diplomat Charles Rutten, who has been chairing the 
organization since its inception, said on Thursday [28 April] 
that there was a risk of failure if no agreement were reached 
next month on the implementation arrangements. 
  A compromise text already has been submitted to the 
signatory 
states. Mr. Rutten has invited them to bring the negotiations 
to an end at a plenary session to be held in Brussels 17-20 May 
and to sign the document next summer. Unanimity is not 
required. However, if the majority of the governments cannot 
agree, one will have to think about giving up, Mr. Rutten noted 
at a press conference. 
<H5>  Practical Difficulties </H5>
  The Energy Charter is meant to contribute to the economic 
development and to the political stability in East Europe. This 
issue has priority over national interests, the Charter's 
chairman added. 
  The Charter's objective is to turn the energy sector into 
the 
driving force of East's economic transition process. Favorable 
conditions for investments should allow the regions involved to 
rebuild their economies and to manage their resources better, 
thus improving the reliability of energy supplyies for the whole 
continent. 
  But realizing this objective has proved to be difficult. 
Negotiations have been underway for three years to establish 
legally binding provisions that guarantee Western investors 
access to the resources, the free transit of energy, the 
protection of investments, and the repatriation of profits. 
  Among the signatory states are all the European countries, 
the republics of the former USSR, Japan, Canada, the United 
States, and Australia.

  [Text] The mass exodus of refugees from war-torn Rwanda is 
continuing. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red 
Crescent Societies issued a statement in Geneva saying up to 
half a million people were believed to be heading for Tanzania. 
The federation said 300,000 refugees had already arrived in 
northwestern Tanzania. It described the exodus as the largest 
single movement of refugees in the federation's 75-year history. 
The Red Cross said it was sending an emergency aid team from 
Kenya to Tanzania, adding that massive amounts of relief 
supplies, including blankets and medicines, were needed 
urgently. The continuing flood of refugees comes after the UN 
Secretary General Butrus-Ghali appealed for a large military 
force to be sent to Rwanda to end the tribal carnage.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic: "Air </F>
Strikes -- United Nations Must Act"] 
  [Text] Europe also becomes guilty of the genocide in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina because it allows the Belgrade government to 
pursue its plan of a greater Serbian empire unimpeded. 
  We call on the community of peoples to make it unmistakably 
clear to the Belgrade regime that it cannot keep the towns and 
villages that it conquered with brute force, and that the state 
borders must not be changed. The United Nations must no longer 
act as a neutral mediator, it must act and carry out air strikes 
against those who violate the UN resolutions. The Belgrade 
government must know that it can no longer attack UN protected 
areas unpunished and fetch its heavy weapons from UN depots at 
will to continue the genocide somewhere else -- in Brcko 
probably. 
  I appeal to Chancellor Kohl to help us. Aggression must not 
be rewarded. It must not be allowed that somebody who attacks a 
home and kills the people living there can keep the house as a 
reward. We call on the international community to convene a 
large world peace conference. 
  Those who do not help in Bosnia-Herzegovina are putting a 
fuse to a powder keg that may set Europe aflame. We want our 
civilization to survive where laws and moral principles should 
prevail and not murder and violence.

  [Excerpt] Vienna, April 30 (AFP) -- North Korea has 
rejected conditions set by the International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA] for new inspections of its nuclear sites, the IAEA 
said Friday [29 April]. 
  "The new reply from Pyongyang to our demands, which arrived 
in Vienna Friday afternoon, is unsatisfactory," said IAEA 
spokesman Hans-Friedrich Meyer, adding that inspectors would not 
therefore travel to North Korea this weekend. 
  "We will discuss the situation again with the member states 
at the start of next week," he said. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article signed WVDV: "NATO Has Plan for Ambitious Ground </F>
Exploration System"] 
  [Text] The North Atlantic Treaty Organization will work on 
an ambitious ground reconnaissance system, which carries a price 
tag of billion of dollars. NATO's National Armament Directory 
gave the green light for a study into the feasibility of the new 
program. 
  The report must be submitted on 8 October to the Conference 
of National Armament Directors [CNAD]. Shortly after this, the 
Defense Planning Committee [DPC] will convene on a ministerial 
level, as Friedhart Sellschopp, head of the NATO Division of 
Ground Armaments, confirmed. 
  In March last year, NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner 
launched the concept of a new ground reconnaissance system which 
had to complement the AWACS air control system. The National 
Armament Directors of the member states were handed the task to 
explore the possibilities of a coordinated reconnaissance system. 
  In June, 10 of the 16 member states began the preliminary 
technical studies into the ground reconnaissance system AGS 
[Alliance Ground Surveillance] under the leadership of Canadian 
Richard Oldford and German expert Friedhart Sellschopp. At the 
moment, two teams led by Belgian military commander Werner 
Gevers are preparing the final report. 
  Although no precise figures about the cost price are known 
yet, Friedhhart Sellschopp is talking about billions of dollars: 
"One airplane alone costs 300 million dollars." The financial 
means should come from the participating states that receive 
substantial orders for their own industries in exchange. 
Smaller states like Belgium should not have to pay more than 10 
percent of the cost price according to Sellschoop. 
  Sellschoop says that the reconnaissance program must be 
given 
the highest priority. "The numerous crisis in different regions 
have emphasized the importance of crisis management. With the 
new ground reconnaissance system, any movement of enemy troops 
can be watched 24 hours a day. From Brussels to Antwerp, the 
most insignificant motion of a car can be detected. The 
information will be available to all member states so that each 
country can make the appropriate decisions immediately on a 
sovereign basis," the NATO expert says . The military circles 
are speaking of a "revolution."

  [Text] Paris, April 29 (AFP) -- Science and technology in 
Russia are going through a transition period and are among the 
first victims of the transformation and reform process there, 
according to a report just published by the OECD. 
  Under the Soviet system, Russia was as advanced in these 
fields as members of the Paris-based Organisation for Economic 
Cooperation and Development, which groups together the world's 
24 most developed countries. Now, it faces structural changes 
likely to retain only those aspects of science which can help 
the country's renewal, says the report, based on studies carried 
out in the second half of 1993. 
  Under the communists' centralised system the sector had 
developed out of all proportion to the country's Gross National 
Product, and spending on military applications must now be cut 
to allow civilian development, it said. Current priorities are 
modernisation of the health and social security system, energy, 
telecommunications and pollution. 
  Russian science, once cut off from the international 
community, can now benefit from the new contacts and 
collaboration with other countries, despite fears about a "brain 
drain," it comments.

  [Text] This morning, the Spaniard Domingo Jimenez Beltran 
was elected executive director of the new European Environment 
Agency, which has its headquarters in Copenhagen. 
  Jimenez Beltran was chosen from among several hundred 
candidates during a special meeting of the administrative board 
of the Environment Agency. At the moment he is director general 
for environmental policy at the Spanish Ministry for 
Transportation and Communications [as heard]. 
  The Agency's new director said that sustainable development 
is necessary, in other words, development should be compatible 
with environmental protection. 
  [Begin Jimenez Beltran recording] The Agency has to act like 
an information agent supporting political decisions compatible 
with the kind of development we want. Public information has to 
help citizens take part in this process. In the long run we all 
have to make decisions: Politicians and an increasingly strong 
public lobby. The agency will be a point of reference providing 
the information needed for political decisions as well as for 
active public participation. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Francisco de Andres report: "Oreja Takes Job as New EU </F>
Commissioner"] 
  [Text] Yesterday afternoon, the Council of Ambassadors of 
the European Union, constituted as the Conference of Member 
States, officially appointed Marcelino Oreja as the new 
commissioner of transport and energy to replace Abel Matutes, 
who left Brussels just hours before to begin his campaign as the 
leader of the PP [People's Party] list for the European 
elections in June. 
  At 59 years of age, Marcelino Oreja is undertaking a new 
task 
in his already rich diplomatic career. The new Spanish 
representative to the Community's executive body will have the 
same areas of responsibility as Abel Matutes -- i.e., energy and 
transport -- until the end of the European Commission's current 
term at the end of this year. The reshuffle for the new group 
of commissioners will be up to Jacques Delors' successor, 
although a number of Community sources consulted agreed in 
saying that -- given Marcelino Oreja's profile and diplomatic 
career -- the most reasonable assumption is that the new Spanish 
commissioner should have responsibilities in the area of 
European foreign relations. 
  This raises the possibility of a stormy initial period in 
his 
relations with Commissioner Manuel Marin, who is currently 
responsible for humanitarian aid and EU policy toward developing 
countries. Marin's fate, and to a certain extent that of 
Oreja's future responsibilities, depends on how the upcoming 
European elections turn out for the Spanish Socialists and on 
[Spanish Prime Minister] Felipe Gonzalez' final decision whether 
or not to run for the Brussels job if the Twelve fail to reach a 
consensus at the June summit on any of the candidates competing 
to succeed Delors. Gonzalez's arrival in Brussels would, of 
course, displace the Spanish Socialist commissioner. 
  Marcelino Oreja has also let it be known that he will 
maintain the good climate of relations with the Spanish 
Government that prevailed during the Matutes years.

<F P=106> [Report by Werner Urbanek: "Happy To Be Alive"] </F>
  [Text] "Ustasha pigs," "Line them up at the wall now," "We 
should slit your throats." This is what the Serbs shouted at 
the three ORF [Austrian Radio and Television] journalists: 
Belgrade correspondent Veronika Seyr, camera man Valentin 
Certov, and a Yugoslav assistant. "We are happy to be alive," 
they say. 
  What happened? On Wednesday [27 April] the ORF team had gone 
to Gorazde: "We had official permission of the Bosnian Serbs to 
go to the checkpoint. From there Ukrainian UN soldiers took us 
to the town. We were there for three hours. Not a single shot 
was fired, and the people told us that the Serbs had withdrawn. 
Then we went back again." 
  In Pale, 50 km away, the ORF team cut its report in a REUTER 
news agency studio: "We had just finished, and one minute 
before we were to transmit the report to Vienna, the room was 
stormed by armed men. They ordered me to hand over the tape 
immediately." 
  Courageously, the ORF correspondent tried to resist: "More 
and more men pushed into the room and verbally abused us. The 
men from the television station were most aggressive." 
  Finally, the Austrians were escorted to their quarters in 
Jahorina, where their entire equipment was seized: "I guess it 
was worth about 2 million schillings, including camera and 
satellite telephone. We were treated like serious criminals." 
  Three hours later everything was over. The next day Veronika 
Seyr was permitted to return to Belgrade, but she had to leave 
her equipment: "I cannot work anymore," she says. 
  The ORF has asked Foreign Minister Mock to issue a vehement 
protest to the authorities in Belgrade.

arrest of ORF correspondent Veronika Seyr in Pale near Sarajevo. 
Foreign Minister Alois Mock summoned the Belgrade charge 
d'affaires to the Foreign Ministry and protested against the 
suppression of reporting. In addition, Austria has asked the 
CSCE to intervene. The International Press Institute has 
supported the protest. Seyr's report on the situation in 
Gorazde and all the equipment that she was carrying were seized 
by Serbian troops yesterday. She herself was questioned for 
several hours.

<F P=106> [Report by Peter Gnam: "Benefiting From the EU Security </F>
System as a Neutral State"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- In an interview with NEUE KRONEN-ZEITUNG 
yesterday Chancellor Vranitzky said that one cannot speak at all 
of Austria's moving away from neutrality. Rather, it is 
important that action be taken within the framework of a common 
European Union [EU] security system against those who disrupt 
peace, and it is there that a neutral state can join. 
  According to Vranitzky, there are many people, for whom 
"little Austria had always been shaky" in the confusion reigning 
during the period from World War I to the occupation. 
Neutrality then gave the people "for the first time the chance 
to breathe freely and say: We are free." According to 
Vranitzky, this attitude is a "healthy, positive feeling toward 
this state." 
  Regarding Austria's negotiations with the EU, "this 
neutrality has not been called into question" in Brussels. Thus 
it has been made clear that Austria, as a neutral state in the 
EU, can participate in the establishment of a collective 
security system in Europe. This security system, for its part, 
envisages measures against those who disrupt peace, and neutral 
state can be a part of that. 
  According to Vranitzky, a second referendum on neutrality as 
mentioned by Foreign Minister Mock, who was a guest at the EU 
party congress of the Greens, is not necessary. "Austrian Army 
abolisher" Pilz, on the other hand, is hinting at a "plan to 
abolish neutrality": Partial amputation now, final disposal of 
the rest two years later.

<F P=106> [Report by Andreas Anzenberger and Dieter Holzweber: </F>
"Special Referendum on EU Defense Alliance?"] 
  [Text] With "greetings from Villach" Pro-European Union 
[EU] activities welcomed the 168 delegates on Saturday morning 
[30 April] for the federal European congress of the Greens. On 
fliers, which referred to the activities of Freedom Party of 
Austria [FPOe] Chairman Haider in Carinthia, the common 
rejection of EU membership by the Greens and the FPOe was 
criticized. 
  In Goldegg Castle (Salzburg) the Greens decided with 87 
percent of the votes that they will definitely vote against 
membership. EU advocates, such as Environmental Spokeswoman 
Lanthgaler and Vienna City Councilor Chorherr, remained in the 
minority. 
  It was clear from the very start that the speeches by 
Foreign 
Minister Mock and EU State Secretary Ederer, who were invited as 
guests, would not be able to change the mood. The government 
members pointed not only to the advantages of membership but 
also voiced praise: The Greens have essentially contributed to 
the development of an awareness for the environment. 
  Mock stressed that neutrality will not be restricted even 
after the EU's institutional reform, which is planned for 1996. 
There are two possible scenarios: If the Western European 
Union [WEU] (the EU's defense alliance) develops into a 
collective security system along the lines of the United 
Nations, membership in this alliance will be possible as neutral 
state. Otherwise, a special referendum on neutrality would be 
necessary before joining the WEU. 
  This statement aroused the displeasure of the coalition 
partner Social Democratic Party of Austria. Chancellor 
Vranitzky told KURIER: "Austria will actively participate in the 
establishment of a collective security system in Europe. 
However, there is no coercion to join the WEU. Therefore, the 
discussion about a special referendum on neutrality is 
superfluous." 
  The reaction by Greens Federal Spokesman Pilz: "The 
government has already worked out a two-step plan for abolishing 
neutrality. The first step is joining the EU."

  [Excerpts] The military officials responsible for the two 
operations in Rwanda have presented their assessment of these 
operations at Army HQ in Rue d'Evere. [passage omitted] 
General Charlier, Army Chief of Staff, drew lessons from the 
premature withdrawal of the UN mission, UNAMIR. General 
Charlier has clearly spelled it out. Listen. A journalist asks 
Colonel Marshal, the commander of the Belgian blue helmets, 
whether he is ready to go back to Rwanda under the same 
condition. General Charlier answers: 
  [Charlier] I tell you frankly that I will not let Belgian 
troops go under the same conditions, and my minister will not 
let them go under the same conditions. We had to fight to 
obtain UN authorization to take some armored vehicles to Kigali. 
The Rwandan Army has armored vehicles. Therefore, there is the 
need for a mandate which could be adapted to the pace at which 
the situation develops, armament which would enable us to adapt 
ourselves to the situation and offer some protection for 
soldiers. [passage omitted] There were very few soldiers in 
Kigali to the extent that the airport was guarded by two small 
Belgian platoons. While, in fact, it needed at least a big 
battalion to guard it. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Kok Reluctant About Ministerial Post </F>
in Brinkman Cabinet"] 
  [Excerpts] PvdA (Labor Party) leader Wim Kok is not sure 
whether he will become minister in a cabinet which would be 
headed by CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] leader Elco 
Brinkman. "If the CDA becomes the biggest party and can supply 
the prime minister, it is `certainly' not obvious that the 
present vice prime minister will become minister again." 
  This was stated by Kok during a series of discussions on the 
commercial stations RTL4 [Luxembourg Radio and Television] and 
RTL5 between the leaders of the four major parties. He answered 
evasively to the question whether, in that case, he would become 
floor leader in the Lower House. Kok has already stated in the 
past that he and Brinkman are "not the most likely royal 
couple." [passage omitted] 
  A poll conducted by Interview revealed that PvdA leader Kok 
is the interviewees' favorite prime minister. Kok is chosen by 
34 percent, Van Mierlo by 20 percent, Brinkman scores 18 
percent, while Bolkestein gets merely 12 percent. 
  The interviewees have an increasing preference for a 
"purple" 
coalition comprising the PvdA, the D66 [Democrats 66], and the 
VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]. Last time, a 
coalition of the CDA, the PvdA and the D66 still scored highest 
with 18.9 percent. The "purple" coalition gained 5 percent, and 
has now taken the lead with 21 percent. A cabinet comprising 
the CDA, the PvdA and the D66 has now become second choice.

<F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff, PRESS ASSOCIATION political editor] </F>
  [Text] Britain today fiercely denied accusations of 
harbouring anti-Iranian terrorist organisations as the bitter 
war of words between London and Tehran rages on unabated. 
Relations between the two countries now stand at their lowest 
ebb following Britain's protest to Iran for allegedly supplying 
the Provisional IRA with cash or arms. 
  Tehran formally denied that and hit back today with new 
allegations claiming that Britain was sheltering terrorist 
organisations working against the Iranian Government. The 
Tehran Times said that Britain had no right to question Iran's 
adherence to international conventions against aiding 
terrorists. "Western powers, Britain among them, cannot plead 
ignorance when it comes to the terrorist nature of anti-Iranian 
groups they harbour in the West," the newspaper said. 
  But a Foreign Office spokesman said: "The Government denies 
any contact of any kind with the Mojahedin-e Khalq group. 
Opposition groups from any country are free to operate in the 
United Kingdom within the law. If they break the law they will 
be prosecuted. If the Iranian have evidence of illegal activity 
they should let us have sight of it." 
  Earlier this week, Foreign Office Minister of State Douglas 
Hogg summoned the Iran charge d'affaires Gholam Reza Ansari to 
give him a dressing down about Iran's alleged involvmenet with 
the Provisional IRA. Afterwards, Iran flatly denied this 
allegation, although Britain remains convinced that there were 
such links. 
  The paper says that the British protest about the IRA was "a 
smokescreen to hide the fact that Western-based anti-Iranian 
terrorists are providing material and personnel to the 
Iraq-based terrorists to attack targets inside the Islamic 
republic." 
  Britain's relations with Iran have been in a state of 
turbulence ever since the late Ayatollah Khomeyni passed 
sentence of death (a "fatwa") on author Salman Rushdie in 1989 
for alleged blasphemy in his novel The Satanic Verses. This was 
a call to Muslims the world over to kill him. The sentence has 
never been lifted and Rushdie has been forced into hiding ever 
since.

  [Text] The Ministry of Defence tonight dismissed as 
"nothing more than speculation" a report that senior RAF 
officers and planners have backed a plan to withdraw all British 
combat aircraft and helicopters from Germany. 
  The proposal is the most radical to emerge from a series of 
studies aimed at making a 1 billion pound cut in the 24 billion 
pound defence budget, according to THE OBSERVER which says it 
has seen a confidential six-page report. 
  If the Cabinet approves, nearly 80 fighter aircraft and 
6,000 
personnel would pull out of Germany by April 1996 as part of the 
latest round of defence cuts, the paper says. 
  It would end an RAF presence in Germany stretching back 
nearly half a century. 
  The paper quotes a senior RAF source saying: "In terms of 
the 
international situation, things have come on a long way since 
the reunification of Germany and there is a feeling that if we 
did need to go back it would not be that difficult."

  [Text] The Government plans to buy more than 50 Tomahawk 
cruise missiles from the United States to give Royal Navy 
submarines new non-nuclear weaponry, according to a report today. 
  The Ministry of Defence tonight refused to comment on the 
claims that the low-flying missiles, carrying conventional 
high-explosive warheads, would be placed on all 12 of Britain's 
Trafalgar class nuclear-attack submarines. 
  The SUNDAY TIMES said the deal, valued at hundreds of 
millions of pounds, would give a more flexible response to the 
emergence of powers like Iraq and Iran which do not possess 
nuclear warheads but could eventually have missiles which could 
target Britain. 
  Unofficial soundings suggest the deal may get U.S. approval 
despite current opposition by President Clinton to proliferation 
of weapons like cruise missiles, according to the paper. 
  It quotes a British source as saying: "This will be a 
significant boost to our capability outside of Europe."

<F P=106> [Interview with Gerry Adams, "president of Sinn Fein, the </F>
legal political wing of the outlawed Irish Republican Army," by 
Martin Alioth in Belfast; date not given: "`Every Single 
Casualty Is Regrettable'"] 
  [Text] [Alioth] Mr. Adams, one year ago you wrote in the 
IRISH TIMES: "The division of Ireland has failed. The British 
presence in Ireland in incompatible with peace." Would you 
choose the same words again today? 
  [Adams] Of course, I would. Almost every day one can see 
the failure of British politics in Ireland and the frustrated 
experiment of division. The division did not work in Germany, 
or anywhere else for that matter; certainly not here. 
  [Alioth] But the Unionist majority in Northern Ireland has 
conclusively proven over the past 100 years that it will defy 
any solution it does not like, even through the use of force. 
Do you really want a united Ireland with 1 million alienated 
rebels? 
  [Adams] One must take into account that the Unionists have 
never stood on their own feet, but have always been dependent on 
the British. When this state was founded, it was not the 
Unionists, but the British who founded it. Consequently, we 
Republicans demand that the Unionists stand on their own feet. 
The Ireland that we want is not the exclusive miniature state 
that we have here in the north, but a comprehensive one, in 
which we will replace the terms Catholic and Protestant by 
generally accepted civil rights of the island of Ireland on the 
basis of equality. This requires the participation of the 
Unionists. 
  [Alioth] In your view, what would change politically and in 
everyday life if, tomorrow, the IRA were to publicly renounce 
the use of violence? 
  [Adams] First of all, I regard it as most unlikely that the 
IRA will do it. In a conflict one either beats the other side 
or reaches a negotiated settlement. The British have admitted 
that they are not able to beat the IRA militarily, and during 
the past 15 years I have said that this is not a military 
problem, which is where there cannot be a military solution, but 
that there has to be a political solution. Last year, Sinn Fein 
participated in a number of political initiatives, all of which 
were aiming at a peace agreement, a negotiated settlement. We 
talked to the British Government, there was the initiative 
between me and Mr. Hume from the Social Democratic and Labour 
Party [SDLP], and we met church leaders and other opinion 
leaders in all of Ireland. We reached agreement among Northern 
Irish Nationalists, which was supported by the government in 
Dublin, and of which the IRA said that it might be a basis for 
peace. All that led to the Downing Street Declaration of 15 
December 1993, which was described by the British Government as 
a first step toward a peaceful settlement. Therefore, it seems 
quite unlikely to me that the IRA -- and neither the British or 
the Loyalists -- might take unilateral action. The inner logic 
of the situation and the development of the past 14 months point 
to a multilateral negotiated settlement. Such a solution was 
delayed and stopped in the past three, four months and has to be 
followed up quickly now. This process will at one point lead to 
a demilitarization, that is to say an end to armed activities 
from all groups involved, including the IRA. This would, of 
course, be a major step ahead, because we would thus be moving 
toward a political solution. 
  [Alioth] In your opinion, what are the political 
consequences of the IRA killing yet another policeman in 
Northern Ireland? 
  [Adams] Meanwhile it sounds almost banal, like a cliche: I 
think that, in this situation any casualty has to be regretted. 
Every single casualty victim, whether it is a Royal Ulster 
Constabulary [RUC] officer, a British soldier, or, as quite 
recently, alleged members of Loyalist organizations, is 
regrettable. We need demilitarization; this is something I have 
always worked for. I have asked all parties involved to lay 
down their arms -- the IRA, the British, the Loyalists. And I 
have not changed my position. Last week we had the death of 
Theresa Clinton, the wife of a Sinn Fein member; there were a 
number of attacks against Catholics and the homes of Catholics. 
The IRA killed a RUC man. And most recently, the IRA killed two 
people, claiming that they were Loyalists. The families of all 
these victims will feel exactly the same: pain. One could say 
that Theresa Clinton had nothing to do with all that. She was a 
woman, it was hard luck that she was married to a Republican, 
while the RUC man was a responsible, armed voluntary member of 
the British Armed Forces, and so on. Yet, I do not think that 
such qualifications and half-justifications will bring things 
ahead. We must make sure that the chances for peace are not 
wasted. Whatever the justification or the circumstances of the 
conflict up to the winter of 1993 may have been, in a situation 
in which all sides claim to have the solution it is disgusting 
that people keep getting killed. 
  [Alioth] Did you ever consider that the strategy of the IRA 
and Sinn Fein of the past 20 years might have been 
counterproductive; that Irish unity was delayed through people 
becoming alienated with one another within Northern Ireland, and 
the North becoming estranged from the South? 
  [Adams] It has not delayed unification of Ireland, which 
would not even be on the agenda without the fight here in the 
north. Yet, certain aspects of the IRA campaign were certainly 
counterproductive, there can be no doubt. And the lasting -- 
let us say -- violence is repulsive to the people who live in 
the middle of it here, as it is to outside observers. The 
sooner armed activities cease, the sooner we will enter a 
nonviolent phase of the struggle, which will be all the better 
for all parties involved. 
  [Alioth] What to you tell people who claim that, after 20 
years in the political desert, the Republicans had lost the 
ability to evaluate their opponents' political room to maneuver. 
  [Adams] But that is certainly not the case. The mere fact 
that the peace process exists at all, and that expectations have 
been so high, prove the Republicans' readiness for dialogue with 
their opponents, even with their enemies. 
  [Alioth] In the last five months you constantly asked the 
British Government for "clarification" of the Downing Street 
Declaration. Is this not simply a trick to press for a meeting 
with a British negotiator before the IRA renounces the use of 
force? 
  [Adams] Well, the term trick is quite an unlucky word in 
this connection. Sinn Fein runs in the election, Sinn Fein wins 
a seat. In the last municipal election we won 12.5 percent of 
the vote, every third Nationalist supports our party. We are 
the party that gets the most votes in Belfast, the country's 
second biggest city, and we are the second biggest party in 
Derry and elsewhere in the six counties. It is not a trick to 
try and win a mandate, to get it, and then represent those from 
one received this mandate. I think that this is called 
democracy. The other parties asked for clarification and, quite 
correctly, got it. Every party did, sometimes even from Dublin 
and London. After all, it is our duty first of all to find out 
what the declaration is all about, because it can be -- and that 
is probably the intention behind it -- interpreted differently. 
I did not say anything about it in the past 10 days, and I am 
become sick only when I hear the word "clarification." I think 
that we are now in a crisis. When the British stonewall, reject 
any development, then everything will freeze, the Loyalists will 
step up their murderous campaign, the British will intensify 
military occupation. At Easter, the IRA suspended its 
activities for a few days to support a clarification. This was 
at a time when the Republicans were trying to be flexible and 
facilitate demilitarization, while what we have got is 
militarization. Then the IRA will, of course, take action 
again, and we are finding ourselves in the situation in which 
the entire peace process threatens to disintegrate. 
  [Alioth] Sometimes you give the impression that you would 
like to be more peaceful and conciliatory than you turn out to 
be. 
  [Adams] I would be a fool if I were not seeking peace. All 
of us, our children, our neighbors, have the desire to live in 
relative peace. I have lived in this conflict all my life. 
This is why I think that my longing for peace is maybe greater 
than that of others who do not live here. It is easy to make 
peace with friends, but it is absolutely difficult to do so with 
enemies. I am not interested in a temporary or partial peace. 
What we need -- and I am deliberately using the term -- is 
lasting peace, a lasting solution. I am convinced that we will 
get peace. I am convinced that the entire thrust of the fight 
points toward peace. Things are going too slowly, and it is 
frustrating to me that we have once more become hostages of the 
right wing of the British Conservatives, and that Mr. Major is 
prevented from providing clarifications to Sinn Fein. As far as 
I am concerned this is unbearable. We have to be patient and 
hold out. If John Major did not have his internal difficulties, 
how much further would he have gotten? All this indicates that 
a more stable British Government would deal with these central 
problems more comprehensively than has been the case in the 
past. The Republicans have always started from the assumption 
that the British will only consider the democratic option 
reluctantly, only when every other way out is blocked.

<F P=106> [Report by Elmar Theviesen] </F>
  [Text] [Theviesen] German submarines can be bought like a 
sausage -- either as a whole or in slices. The HDW 
[Howaldtswerke Deutsche Werft] shipyard in Kiel makes this 
possible -- also for Turkey. The parts of two submarines are 
currently being delivered to the NATO partner. 
  The sale of three speedboats to Turkey by the (Luersen) 
shipyard in Bremen is also being prepared. However, the 
financing is not yet ensured. One could, however, arrange 
things as it was done with the third deal. Four frigates have 
been ordered at Blohm and Voss in Hamburg; the volume of the 
order is 1.6 billion German marks [DM]; DM300 million of that is 
provided by Bonn for the NATO partner. 
  Trade with Turkey has grown for a long time. Military and 
civilian goods worth DM7.5 billion were exported by German 
companies to the Bosporus last year. Turkish imports from 
Germany amounted to DM6.4 billion. 
  Turkey is increasingly also developing into a bridge to the 
markets of the Turkic republics of the former Soviet Union and 
to Iran. This is also an opportunity for German exporters. 
However, so far Turkey has primarily been seen as a security 
barrier against the Middle East. Therefore, the FRG primarily 
subsidizes arms exports. It is high time to change that. 
  The Turkish economy is in a desolate state. This was much 
discussed at the foreign trade conference in Hagen. Still, 
German companies want to invest, but they need help from Bonn. 
More money for civilian instead of military exports could help 
stabilize the situation in Turkey. If this is not done, the 
country might slide into fundamentalism. 
  However, this is precisely what is indirectly promoted by 
the 
loud accusations against Turkey in connection with human rights. 
Turkish trading partners are already annoyed. The 
representative of German industry in Istanbul admonishes caution. 
  [Wolf Martin of the Federation of German Chambers of 
Industry 
and Commerce] Yes, quite certainly this has an effect. When we 
talk to our Turkish friends, they are very much affected by 
accusations coming from Germany. 
  [Theviesen] Can this also harm economic relations? Does one 
hear that orders have gone to somebody else as a result? 
  [Martin] This is conceivable. 
  [Theviesen] Now the Bundestag wants to ensure mutual 
understanding by establishing a permanent work group with the 
Turkish parliament. However, obviously the beginning is 
difficult, because just at the time when the delegation arrived, 
the Bundestag plenum was critically examining Turkey's policy 
toward the Kurds. An insult, the Turks felt. [Bundestag 
President] Rita Suessmuth apologized. 
  Nevertheless, in the future it is intended to discuss 
xenophobia and dual citizenship in Germany, but also about 
torture and war in Turkey. 
  The economic and political situation forces Germany to be 
diplomatic and use velvet gloves. 
  [Foreign Minister Kinkel] At the latest local elections we 
have indeed seen a worrying development in the direction of 
fundamentalism. Turkey has economic difficulties. We must try 
to help it. I repeat that this does not change anything about 
the fact that the problems have to be addressed frankly. One 
must always look at things in their entirety and carefully 
cultivate friendly relations in foreign policy and not work with 
a sledge hammer. 
  [Theviesen] A sledge hammer like these photos, for instance 
[video shows black-and-white photographs in a briefcase]. They 
were supposed to prove the use of German weapons against the 
Kurds. Human rights groups passed them on to the Foreign 
Ministry weeks ago. Even before, the Federal Government had 
ordered a suspension of arms deliveries. 
  BONN DIREKT now has obtained the analysis of the photos, 
which was carried out by the Defense Ministry and is available 
as an official letter to the Foreign Ministry. According to 
this document, it cannot be proved that tanks with allegedly 
typical characteristics, such as rear-view mirrors, come from 
Germany. Russian tanks, too, have such characteristics. Trucks 
of the MAN or UNIMOG types are even produced by the Turks 
themselves under a license. In addition, no vehicle is shown in 
combat position or beside destroyed buildings. The summary: 
With the available photos one cannot prove that weapons and 
equipment from deliveries within the framework of NATO defense 
aid, material aid, or special armament aid have been used in 
violation of the contracts. 
  [Kinkel] So far, we do not have any evidence that weapons 
delivered by Germany have been used in internal Turkish 
conflicts. However, I would like to make a final statement only 
when I have received the official result. 
  [Theviesen] This is supposed to happen this week. Then Bonn 
will probably give the go-ahead for the delivery of 16 Phantom 
jets, the last installment of military aid to Turkey for the 
time being.

<F P=106> ["now./Ho." report: "Continuity in Foreign Policy Promised"] </F>
  [Text] Brussels, 29 Apr -- During a two-day visit to 
Brussels, Chairman Scharping of the Social Democratic Party of 
Germany [SPD] stressed common points in the basic orientation of 
the Social Democrats and the Federal Government in European 
policy. In talks with NATO Secretary General Woerner, European 
Union [EU] Commission President Delors, and members of the 
European Parliament, Scharping promised continuity in foreign 
policy if the SPD takes over the government after the Bundestag 
elections in October. The SPD candidate for the chancellor's 
office particularly mentioned the special relationship with 
France in European policy, Germany's integration in NATO, and 
the special relations with the United States, as well as 
striving for reliable cooperation with the states in Central and 
East Europe. 
  The Atlantic Alliance is more than just a defense alliance 
-- 
it is a decisive element of European security policy, Scharping 
said. In addition to a "substantial presence" of the United 
States and Canada in Europe, Russia, too, must play a "special 
role," Scharping stated. Asked in which respect the foreign 
policy concepts of the Federal Government and the SPD opposition 
are different, the politician said that concurrence in the basic 
orientation is "not bad." However, Scharping criticized the 
Federal Government's negative attitude toward certain ideas of 
the EU Commission to stimulate economic growth as well as the 
inappropriate "style and tone" of Foreign Minister Kinkel's 
negotiations in the internal EU quarrel over future voting in 
the Council of Ministers. In addition, he complained that 
Chancellor Kohl is increasingly alone in the Christian 
Democratic Union/Christian Social Union with his dedication to 
European policy because there "the trend toward nationalism has 
clearly" become "stronger." 
  Previously, speaking to members of the Social Democratic 
group of the European Parliament, Scharping clearly advocated 
the enlargement of the EU by Austria, Finland, Norway, and 
Sweden. A few days before the vote in Strasbourg, he called on 
the still hesitating deputies -- mainly from France, Belgium, 
and Italy -- to approve the membership treaties. Criticism of 
the insufficient "deepening" of the EU and the politically and 
juridically dubious compromise on the future blocking minority 
in the Council of Ministers is not reason enough to postpone the 
vote next Wednesday [4 May]. "Deepening" and "enlarging" the EU 
are, furthermore, not a contradiction. The Central and East 
European reform states, too, must not be left alone by the EU; 
they must be given a clear prospect for membership soon, even if 
they will probably not be mature enough for full membership in 
the next 10 years. One must not be discouraged by problems in 
everyday politics in the West and stick to the "great vision and 
opportunity" to bring together the peoples and states in the 
West and East. The parliament must be involved in the EU 
reforms planned for 1996; its rights in the legislative process 
must be strengthened. 
  Mr. Haensch, the top candidate of the Social Democrats for 
the European election on 12 June, said that in the future the 
European deputies must be able to make decisions, on an equal 
footing with the Council of Ministers, in those fields where the 
governments make majority decisions. The requirement that all 
12 governments have to agree unanimously is to be limited to 
amendments to the EU Treaty as well as to certain decisions that 
affect finances.

  [Text] Wuerzburg (ddp/ADN) -- "Returns" from the European 
Union (EU) to Germany must be "improved", according to Theo 
Waigel, chairman of the Christian Social Union [CSU] and finance 
minister. At a CSU meeting in preparation for the European 
elections, Waigel said today in Wuerzburg that Germany has 
fallen from position two to position seven in the EU prosperity 
league after unification. The call for an austere budget policy 
in Europe and increased returns for Germany is therefore 
justifiable. 
  Waigel once again called for an international Bundeswehr 
commitment within the United Nations. Germany has to be 
prepared to assume responsibility "in Europe and throughout the 
world. We cannot hide any longer," Waigel stressed.

<F P=106> ["beu"-signed report: "EMI President Lamfalussy Emphasizes </F>
Importance of Common Monetary Policy"] 
  [Text] Hamburg -- One of the central tasks of the European 
Monetary Institute (EMI) will be finding a consensus on the 
basis for a common monetary policy conducted by the European 
Central Bank. EMI President Lamfalussy knows one thing for 
sure: "This is not going to be an easy task." 
  Speaking before the central bank of Hamburg, Mecklenburg, 
and 
Schleswig-Holstein, Lamfalussy said that the course of fiscal 
policy can considerably narrow down monetary policy's 
stabilizing possibilities in both phases of the economic cycle. 
The only thing that the currency authorities can do is continue 
to conduct a medium-term stability policy, hoping that this will 
limit the damage caused by a false fiscal policy. 
  Lamfalussy: "I can see a major problem coming our way here. 
We will have to define what we mean by a stable monetary 
policy." This is the biggest challenge that monetary 
politicians will face over the next few years. Lamfalussy 
considers the use of a money supply target to be the crucial 
point. The biggest advantage of a money supply target is that 
it clearly determines the course of monetary policy. If the 
targeted money supply growth rate remains unchanged, this 
indicates a stable monetary policy course. 
  Determining money supply targets takes the pressure off 
central banks that is exerted on them by governments or 
parliaments, Lamfalussy said. A central bank has less 
difficulty resisting an adjustment of monetary policy for 
subjective reasons. Also -- and this might be the most 
important point -- a money supply target that is well understood 
by the general public clearly signals to the players in the 
market what range of prices and wages is permitted. 
  Whether determining money supply targets is appropriate 
depends on two things. First, there must be a stable 
medium-term link between money supply and prices, the final 
target; and, second, the central bank must be in a position to 
control the targeted money supply. 
  Several countries, such as the United States and Great 
Britain, no longer meet one or both of these preconditions. 
John Crow, former governor of the Canadian Central Bank used to 
say: "We have not given up M2 -- M2 has given us up." 
  In Germany, such a statement is not justified, in spite of 
occasional diversions from the M3 target and in spite of M3's 
recent behavior. Lamfalussy: "But this behavior does not go 
back nearly long enough to draw any conclusions on medium-term 
stability of the money demand function, which is the whole point 
of the matter." Yet, there are ongoing discussions on what basis 
the European Central Bank's common monetary policy shall be 
conducted.

  [Text] Frankfurt/Main -- Subsidiaries of U.S. banks in 
Germany can expect regulations to relax considerably in the 
future. The Association of Foreign Banks reports that the 
Finance Ministry has completed a regulation based on an 
agreement between the governments and banking supervisory boards 
of the United States and Germany. This will give U.S. banks much 
the same rights as banks from European Union [EU] countries. 
The Association thinks that this regulation might guide other 
non-EU countries as well. 
  The Association of Foreign Banks, which has advocated 
extending the EU model to other non-European banks for some 
time, points out that U.S. banks will continue to be subject to 
approval and control by the Federal Banking Supervisory Board. 
The banks will, however, no longer be required to support risk 
assets by capital. 
  In the field of big loans, European regulations must be 
observed, which limit the risk for the individual debtor to 25 
percent of the bank's capital resources. What remains in force 
is the (costly) annual audit and a minimum capital of ECU5 
million per subsidiary, which, according to the association, is, 
however, insignificant in terms of banking supervision.

<F P=106> ["sz"-signed report: "Large Projects Were Discussed in </F>
China"] 
  [Text] Shanghai, 28 Apr -- After the projects in India, 
the Mercedes-Benz AG is now planning several large projects in 
China. Basically, the construction of a diesel engine factory, 
together with the First Automotive Corporation, in Changchun in 
northern China is involved. The construction of buses is also 
under discussion. In southern China, Mercedes-Benz wants to 
build large limousines in two production facilities. The 
concern is competing with the U.S. Chrysler Corporation here. 
  This was announced in an interview for HANDELSBLATT by 
Eberhard Herzog, former member and adviser of the Mercedes-Benz 
board of directors. Herzog accompanied Baden-Wuerttemberg 
Minister President Erwin Teufel on his tour of China. 
  The diesel engine factory is to produce four- and 
six-cylinder engines of medium weight. A Japanese company 
(Hino) is also competing for this project. The construction of 
at least 100,000 diesel engines for trucks and busses is under 
consideration. The engine represents an ultramodern new 
development. It is also to be installed in Mercedes commercial 
vehicles in Germany and worldwide. The project involves over 500 
million German marks. 
  At two production facilities in Guangdong Province in 
southern China and in Hainan Island (a special economic 
province), a large limousine is to be produced together with the 
Nanfang Corporation. The Chrysler Corporation is likely to 
receive the order if U.S. President Clinton in June should 
extend China's most-favored-nation status by another year. 
Clinton and Chancellor Kohl have asked the Chinese leadership 
to place orders with the companies of their countries. As a 
result of regional vanities, however, production is to be split 
between two sites, which will not make the manufacture easier. 
  Negotiations with the Shanghai Automotive Industrial 
Corporation on the construction of Mercedes-Benz luxury busses 
on the basis of the mechanical assembly technique with low 
Chinese participation in the manufacture at the beginning are 
also under way. The production of 1,000 luxury busses is 
planned. Two more bus producers are negotiating the development 
of a simpler long-distance intercity bus with Mercedes-Benz. 
Numerous state-owned concerns from other towns and provinces 
that specialize in the construction of commercial vehicles and 
cars are offering the Stuttgart company their cooperation. One 
such concern is the delivery truck factory in Shenyang in 
northern China where production takes place in old Toyota 
manufacturing plants. The governor of the province has submitted 
cooperation proposals to Mercedes-Benz. Through cooperation 
with the provinces, Japanese auto producers have practically 
avoided the State Council and are in this way trying to obtain 
production facilities in China. In northern China, 
Mercedes-Benz is producing commercial vehicles together with a 
company that belongs to the Defense Ministry. 
  According to Herzog, Mercedes-Benz will be forced to 
concentrate on a few major projects in China. The production of 
passenger cars is not under consideration. Currently, the 
Machine-Building Ministry does not grant any permits for such 
projects, with the exception of the Nanfang project.

<F P=106> ["Stue" report: "More Involvement in Latin America </F>
Possible"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 29 Apr -- German industry is in danger of 
eventually losing its good position in Latin America. This fear 
has been expressed by Hans-Peter Repnik (Christian Democratic 
Union), parliamentary state secretary in the Ministry for 
Economic Cooperation. German companies are not involved in any 
of the large privatization projects in Latin America in the 
fields of energy supply, water supply, or telecommunications, 
Repnik said with regret. On the other hand, Spanish and French 
competitors, for instance, are very active. If they get first 
pick in the privatization of power plants or telephone 
companies, it will become increasingly difficult for German 
producers to supply, for instance, turbines or 
telecommunications facilities. "We must get our foot in the 
door in the strategic fields of growth," Repnik demanded. 
  In Repnik's view, the Japanese have recognized Latin America 
as a market of the future. They are also using development aid 
as a means to develop markets. Repnik pointed to Tokyo's plans 
to increase development aid from $10 to $15 million over the 
next five years. Japan has clearly raised its capital share in 
the Interamerican Development Bank (IDB) from 1.08 to 5 percent. 
It was important that, as a result, the Europeans also raised 
their share from 6 to 11 percent, said Repnik, who was chairman 
of the Governors' Council until the IDB annual meeting in 
Guadalajara/Mexico in April. To increase the German share from 
0.99 to 1.9 percent, Bonn must pay 53 million German marks. In 
return, German presence in the Directorate has been achieved. 
Parallel to raising the IDB's capital by $40 billion to $101 
billion, it was decided to give priority in the bank's work to 
promoting social justice and combating poverty. 
  In contrast to the Japanese strategy, the FRG wants to 
reduce 
its share in contributions to multilateral institutions in the 
development budget from 34 to 30 percent in the medium term. 
One will pay more attention to the efficiency of the work of 
the international organizations and perhaps reduce the German 
contribution to one or the other of these institutions, Repnik 
said.

<F P=106> [Report by Ludwig Greven: "Herzog on the Road to Victory"] </F>
  [Text] It was meant to be an exciting election, an 
unprecedented open race for the highest office in the state. 
Yet, things seem to be clear now. Roman Herzog can get ready 
to move to Berlin. After the Free Democratic Party [FDP] 
promised to continue the coalition with the Christian Democratic 
Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] and after recent 
statements from among FDP ranks, it is as good as certain that 
the CDU candidate will be elected as successor to Federal 
President Richard von Weizsaecker on 23 May. Social Democratic 
Party of Germany [SPD] candidate Johannes Rau has hardly any 
hope. Even Juergen Moellemann, chairman of the North 
Rhine-Westphalian FDP group, has recognized the signs of the 
time. At his party's land congress he was reelected, but 
punished with a humiliating score as a result of his open 
sympathy for the SPD candidate. He announced that he would give 
in to the FDP majority and, if necessary, even against his own 
conviction, vote for the CDU man. So the chances for Herzog are 
excellent. 
  In the Federal Assembly, which will elect the head of state 
on 23 May in Berlin, the majority situation is obvious. The 
CDU/CSU is by far the strongest group. Of the 1,324 delegates, 
half of which will be nominated by the Bundestag and half by the 
laender, the CDU and CSU alone can count on 619 votes, thus only 
being 44 votes short of the absolute majority. The SPD has to 
rely on the help of others. Even if Jens Reich, former GDR civil 
rights activist, were to withdraw his candidacy after the 
initial rounds of votes, and if all members of the Party of 
Democratic Socialism [PDS] and the Alliance 90/Greens were then 
to vote for Rau, the SPD would still have to be backed by a 
majority of the FDP for the victory of its candidate. Yet, at 
the moment very little speaks for this. After all, it has been 
said that there is agreement within the FDP to strictly follow 
the party's recommendation in the Federal Assembly. A split in 
the party is not likely. Nobody in Bonn expects the FDP to vote 
for Rau, thus risking a major dispute with the CDU in the 
coalition only a few months before the Bundestag election, 
considering its intention to continue to stay in power after 16 
October in Bonn along with the CDU/CSU. After all, the majority 
of the 111 FDP members in the Federal Assembly, 78, come from 
the Bundestag group, where the atmosphere is clearly in favor of 
the CDU candidate. 
  So Herzog is going to make it. What is also clear is that 
the FDP will do everything to prove how independent and 
indispensable it is. "The FDP decides on who will become 
federal president -- nobody else," was the slogan Hermann Otto 
Solms, chairman of the FDP Bundestag group, proclaimed with 
self-assurance: "The FDP is once more in its favorite role of 
being able to tip the scales." This is why the final decision 
should not be made before the individual ballots. 
  Apart from the support for Herzog, the FDP parliamentarians 
will discuss a second alternative, which is considered by FDP 
Secretary General Werner Hoyer as "absolutely plausible": The 
FDP's own candidate Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher would not only run 
in the first two ballots, which require an absolute majority, 
but also in the decisive third round, in which a simple majority 
will suffice. Even then, the FDP would indirectly support the 
CDU/CSU without having to openly back the candidate that does 
not have a great popular appeal: The SPD would then lack the 
necessary votes; the CDU/CSU could ensure the victory of its man 
with its relative majority -- peace in the coalition would be 
saved; and the FDP could celebrate itself as an independent, 
decisive force. 
  However, there are still some imponderabilities. Within the 
CDU/CSU support for Herzog is not quite that undivided. There 
are reservations among deputies from eastern Germany against the 
conservative candidate from the west. Saxon Environment 
Minister Arnold Vaatz would rather vote for eastern contender 
Reich. Yet the FDP has made its behavior dependent on the 
solidarity of the CDU/CSU. Things might become unpleasant if 
Republikaner Chairman Schoenhuber were to commit his partisans 
to Herzog. Should Herzog then come off with only a narrow lead, 
he would have to step down because he said he would not be made 
president with the decisive votes of the Republikaner. 
  The Social Democrats might also thwart the CDU's plans. If, 
after the first two ballots, they were to decide to withdraw the 
candidacy of Rau in favor of the highly appreciated 
social-liberal Hamm-Bruecher, the FDP would be maneuvered into a 
most embarrassing situation. If it were then still to vote in 
favor of Herzog, it would let down its own candidate. Yet, if 
it were to stick to Hamm-Bruecher, the FRG would get its first 
female president -- and the sensation would be perfect.

<F P=106> ["eli" report: "Army Inspector Criticizes Bundeswehr Reform </F>
Plans"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- Statements by Army Inspector Hartmut Bagger 
concerning the reform plans for the Bundeswehr have caused great 
disquiet in the Defense Ministry. At a parliamentary meeting of 
the Bundeswehr Association, Bagger had mentioned problems with 
implementing Defense Minister Volker Ruehe's conceptual 
guidelines and had complained that he was not fully informed 
about the preparations. NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner 
has harshly criticized the Bundeswehr debate. 
  On Friday [29 April] Bagger had a personal statement 
disseminated, in which he stressed that he fully agrees with 
Ruehe's goals for developing the armed forces. At the meeting 
he had pointed to "potential consequences" and "difficult 
questions" in connection with implementing the concept. It is 
not correct that he thinks shortening compulsory military 
service is not feasible. Bagger said that relevant reports 
describing his dissension were abbreviated and incorrect. 
  Bernhard Gertz, head of the Bundeswehr association, told 
SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG that Bagger's statements were indeed 
reported in an exaggerated manner. At the meeting he had 
referred to the practical problems associated with implementing 
reform, in particular in connection with shortening compulsory 
military service to 10 months. The Army inspector described the 
"gigantic heap of problems in practice" and expressed concern, 
but did not cast doubt on his loyalty to Ruehe. On Friday, 
Bagger was summoned by Ruehe and explained his position to the 
defense minister. He felt grossly misunderstood, it was said. 
  According to Gertz, however, Bagger indeed complained that 
he 
had been informed so late in the game and not been involved in 
the preparations. Inspector General Naumann, on the other hand, 
had always insisted that individual unit inspectors had been 
involved in the preparations. It is possible that Naumann spoke 
with Bagger's predecessor Helge Hansen. Bagger took over the 
post of Army inspector in March and was obviously not informed. 
  Gertz told SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG that he himself does not 
think that a reduction in compulsory military service time is 
realistic. The Bundeswehr Association objects to giving up 
social achievements for the conscripts. Ruehe' concept will 
cause even more young men to refuse to do their military service. 
  NATO Secretary General Woerner said in Bonn that the 
Bundeswehr has become a "disposable mass." "This cannot and 
will not work." The strength of the armed forces cannot be 
arbitrarily manipulated, Woerner stressed.

<F P=106> [Commentary by retired General Gerd Schmueckle, former NATO </F>
deputy commander in chief: "Who Is Going To Save the 
Bundeswehr?"] 
  [Text] Parliamentarians were outraged when they read in 
the newspaper that the defense minister wants to reduce the 
Bundeswehr from 370,000 to 340,000-320,000 men and shorten 
compulsory military service to 10 months. This outrage also -- 
and not without justification -- included a bit of injured 
pride. In this connection it was, however, strange that it was 
precisely those who were outraged who had actively participated 
in hammering one lump after the other out of the "defense budget 
quarry." The fact that less money means less Bundeswehr is 
simple arithmetic. No matter how you look at it: If the 
Bundeswehr continues to be the target of attacks, then one day 
Theo Waigel -- like his Austrian colleague Karl Ludwig von Bruck 
in the past -- will have to cry out: "May God maintain the 
Army; I, the finance minister, cannot do so anymore." 
  What else can Volker Ruehe consider aside from cuts in the 
size of the Bundeswehr? Of course, he was right that a smaller 
and effective Bundeswehr has more political weight than a large 
and militarily inferior one. Helmut Kohl should think along 
similar lines, because, according to the constitution, he has a 
special position vis a vis the armed forces: In case of 
emergency he becomes the commander in chief, that is, in the 
event for which our state is, after all, maintaining the 
Bundeswehr. Even the conceivable use of crisis reaction forces 
can -- not in terms of constitutional law but in terms of 
constitutional policy -- bring him closer to this burden. Other 
things are no less important: Sooner or later NATO will realize 
again how essential it is for safeguarding peace in Europe to 
return to a policy of balance. We then have to be able to put a 
Bundeswehr on this political scale, which constitutes a weight 
that must be taken seriously. Therefore, Kohl would have to be 
the last person to agree to a further disassembly of the 
Bundeswehr. After all, he cannot be interested in commanding a 
ridiculous army in an emergency. 
  In the current controversy in Bonn it is constantly said 
that 
the Bundeswehr must not be made the playing ball in the party 
quarrel. However, it has long since become that, the most recent 
instance being the parties' race to the Federal Constitutional 
Court in Karlsruhe. As long as we have an army of conscripts, 
it will always be an issue in the quarrel among the parties. If 
one accepts the former, one should not complain about the 
latter. After all, during the years of its development, the 
Bundeswehr had to weather quite different political storms than 
it does today. However, at that time, it had a clear course 
outlined. Today, on the other hand, some political statements 
look as if some kind of vivisection of the Bundeswehr were 
intended. All too easily it is forgotten that the armed forces 
are a living organism. It comprises not only soldiers, 
officials, and employees, but also their families. They all 
cannot be used for arbitrary experiments without weakening the 
Army's combat strength. 
  Today there are various movements that affect the 
Bundeswehr. 
One says their reduction to 340,000 men or fewer is bad for 
foreign policy. The history of the Bundeswehr says something 
different: Franz Josef Strauss reduced the deployment sites of 
the Bundeswehr far more dramatically than Ruehe intends to do 
now. He convinced NATO that effective units are more important 
than militarily inferior ones. German foreign policy was not 
harmed by that. 
  A second movement claims that Ruehe's plans are too vague. 
Yes, they lack the basis of solid staff work. The planners 
must do additional work if they want to be convincing. However, 
the critics are not thinking of that. With justification, in 
the super election year they fear a discussion about which other 
garrisons must be closed down. This is, indeed, Ruehe's toad -- 
which these politicians do not want to swallow. Even those 
forces that would prefer to reduce the Bundeswehr to zero are 
complaining about that. No quarrel about garrisons just now! 
  A third group thinks that Ruehe's proposal does not go far 
enough. They want to reduce the armed forces to 300,000 men. 
Who is right could be decided only if a detailed balance sheet 
of the situation of the Bundeswehr were available. However, 
this has always been lacking. Therefore, all figures are just 
rough estimates. Even though the accusation that the official 
security policy is conceptually dubious is correct, none of the 
three groups of critics offers a convincing alternative. 
  Helmut Kohl's decision to establish a committee now, which 
-- 
without time limit -- is to clarify the Bundeswehr's future, is 
a politically understandable delaying tactic to avoid problems 
in the coalition and to get through the election year. 
Regarding the matter itself, however, this solution is 
dangerous. So far, it has been the task of the military to 
present to the minister a very detailed concept, which is 
arrived at in solid staff work. This staff work was based on 
orders from above and was thus permeated by a unified will. 
Things are different in the planned committee. It is 
unavoidable that all those differences that are now already 
shaking up the field of security policy will clash in it. Then 
one will probably settle for the lowest common denominator of 
agreement. 
  This solution corresponds to the general trend in Bonn to 
involve as many politicians as possible in the military 
decisionmaking processes. How this is supposed to work in an 
emergency remains an open question. One can democratize 
decisionmaking processes until they are ineffective, even if 
Ruehe may then have done everything to make the Bundeswehr fit. 
Its efficiency can be negated at any time via decisionmaking. 
It is time to think about this seriously. 
  It is to be regretted that a high-level discussion about the 
future form of military service did not take place in the 
Bundestag. Even when President Richard von Weizsaecker suggested 
thinking about the idea of a "general service duty," the 
political echo was just an embarrassed silence. What Volker 
Ruehe is now envisaging -- half compulsory military service, 
half army of volunteers -- is certainly acceptable as an interim 
solution. However, it will not be a lasting solution. Bonn 
will not be spared the pain of choosing between an army of 
conscripts or an army of volunteers. Hopefully, both models 
will be calculated in the Defense Ministry in such a serious way 
that the respective costs can be presented to the public at any 
time. The potential support of one or the other model with 
general service duty should also be included.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Parties Quarrel Over Number of </F>
Bundeswehr Garrisons"] 
  [Text] The possible closure of Bundeswehr garrisons has 
caused heated debates within the parties. The Defense Ministry 
has rejected accusations that Defense Minister Ruehe was keeping 
quiet about the number of garrisons to be closed. A ministry 
spokesman explained yesterday that matters concerning deployment 
of Army units would be considered "at the appropriate time." 
But this can only happen after the completion of talks on the 
basis of guidelines set down by Ruehe concerning the future 
development of the Bundeswehr. 
  SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] defense expert 
Erwin 
Horn told BILD AM SONNTAG that Ruehe was not going to evade the 
question of closures; nevertheless, probably as a result of 
pressure from the coalition, smaller Bundeswehr garrisons will 
be kept intact. Ruehe's concept is also based on the assumption 
that some barracks consist of mere "janitors in uniform" who 
maintain the facilities in poor condition. 
  Appearing on Sender Freies Berlin, FDP [Free Democratic 
Party] general secretary Werner Hoyer warned against creating 
unnecessary fears with the debate on garrisons. He called for a 
statement as soon as possible about the number of garrisons to 
be closed. 
  A working committee of the ruling parties will examine 
Ruehe's concept, a very controversial one among the coalition, 
on 17 May at the very earliest. Hoyer said he hoped "a tangible 
preliminary result" would be achieved before parliament's summer 
recess at the beginning of July. 
  During the working committee's talks, the FDP general 
secretary also wants to discuss Ruehe's planned military service 
period of 10 months for the main defense forces and 12 months 
for the crisis reaction forces. He said he is ready to "broaden 
his mind." Recruits undergoing basic military service should 
belong to the crisis reaction forces only on a voluntary basis. 
Only after receiving "top-class training" should they be sent 
on front-line missions. Therefore it is quite sensible to 
encourage them to serve longer than the statutory 12 months in 
return for higher pay. 
  During the weekend, Bundeswehr chief inspector 
Lieutenant-General Hartmut Bagger also made it clear that he had 
not criticized Ruehe's suggestion of cutting military service 
down to 10 months. It is not true, he said, that he considered 
12-month military service "absolutely necessary." 
  Meanwhile, FDP deputy Guenter Nolting insisted that the 
Bundeswehr should set up units that would react to critical 
situations involving German hostages abroad just as fast as the 
GSG-9 (border protection police) can react at home. The FDP 
chairman of the parliamentary defense committee and chairman of 
the FDP faction's working group for security policy told the 
MITTELRHEINISCHE MORGENPOST that the Bundeswehr's current 
reaction time of three days to events such as Rwanda is 
definitely too long. This would affect German hostages abroad, 
who are entitled to be liberated as quickly as possible.

<F P=106> [Heinz Heck report: "A Case for Tax Cuts"] </F>
  [Text] In the international competition for investments 
and jobs, it is necessary to reduce the tax burden on German 
enterprises to the same level that prevails in major competitor 
countries despite the eruption of expenditures caused by German 
unification, Winfried Fuest, tax expert at the Institute of 
German Industry, told DIE WELT, with reference to the next 
parliamentary term of office. 
  He said Germany's major competitor countries have reduced 
their taxes to a greater extent than Germany over the past few 
years. "Despite the reduction in tax rates laid down in the law 
on industrial location guarantees, the relative gap between us 
and our competitors will begin to widen from 1995 onwards," said 
Fuest. Before the aforementioned law was passed, the total tax 
burden on a German capital company, consisting of corporate, 
industrial, and property tax, amounted to 66.2 percent. With 
the reduction of corporate tax from 50 to 45 percent, this tax 
burden has fallen to 62.3 percent. 
  As a result of the 7.5 percent mutual increase in the 
corporate tax burden in 1995, the total tax burden on companies 
will again rise to 64.9 percent. All known surveys state that 
the effective rate of tax is very high in Germany. "Germany was 
and remains a high-tax country," said Fuest. 
  On the other hand, in the former high-tax country of Sweden, 
enterprises are burdened with a mere 30-percent tax. In 1988, 
they were still burdened with 58 percent. The situation is 
similar in other countries. 
  Bonn must reconsider more than just property tax, which 
leads 
to double taxation for enterprises and shareholders. The same 
applies to the equally earnings-unrelated industrial capital 
tax, from which the new laender have been exempted until 1995. 
A change in the method of financing local communities should 
lie at the center of reform efforts. There are patterns for a 
possible compromise in this sphere, which take into 
consideration the interests of industry and those of the 
communities. The abolition of earnings-unrelated taxes is of 
particular importance for risky investments. 
  However, a reform of the taxation of enterprises is not 
expedient unless the general level of tax on the whole of 
industry is reduced. This can only succeed if the growth in 
expenditures is consistently kept lower than GNP growth. 
However, this rule must apply to laender and communities 
equally. In fact, west German communities have strongly 
increased their spending since unification. The Institute of 
German Industry reckons that between 1983 and 1989, the average 
annual increase in taxation (excluding social security 
contributions) was only 3.6 percent, but from 1989 to 1992 it 
was 8.6 percent.

<F P=106> ["u-r"-signed report: "Bayer Chemicals Company at Turning </F>
Point"] 
  [Text] Cologne -- The Bayer group, Leverkusen, will achieve 
a significantly better result in 1994, thus ending its downward 
trend. At the group's general assembly in Cologne, Board 
Director Manfred Schneider announced that both domestic and 
foreign capacities will be increased. The group's turnover in 
the first quarter of 1994 went up by 6.3 percent, to 11 billion 
German marks [DM], with positive impulses mainly coming from 
foreign trade. The group's operating results improved by 18 
percent, to DM755 million. This favorable development mainly 
resulted from rationalizations that involved a reduction in 
staff by 4,500, to 150,300 over a period of 12 months, 
concluding at the end of March. 
  Two groups of shareholders holding different opinions 
confronted each other in the debate. While the first group 
praised the board for Bayer once more for being "top of the 
class in the chemicals industry," the other group was mainly 
critical. In no fewer than 47 countermotions, the Bayer 
management was accused of numerous failures. One of the 
criticisms was that the wages Bayer pays in the Third World do 
not meet FRG standards. 
  Schneider addressed the negative effects of the health 
structure act. These effects will be "counteracted" by 
reorganizing sales and including generic products in the group's 
range. The purchase of a parcel of shares (28.3 percent) of the 
U.S. company Schein Pharmaceuticals at $312 million is only a 
first step. The majority could be purchased over the next seven 
years. 
  On the reduction in the number of Bayer shareholders to just 
under 300,000, Schneider said that a large part of Bayer shares 
is now probably managed by funds. Good results and appropriate 
dividends are the best way to increase the attractiveness of 
Bayer shares even further. At the general assembly, 48.8 
percent of the DM3.4 billion in capital were represented. All 
items on the agenda were adopted with a vast majority.

  [Text] Paris, April 29 (AFP) -- Employment and peace are to 
be the main items on the agenda for the French presidency of the 
European Union [European Union] in the first half of 1995, the 
two ministers responsible for European affairs said here on 
Friday [29 April]. 
  In presenting their view of the future of the Union they 
challenged what they saw was the British policy orientated 
towards a free-trade area. 
  They would emphasise the "French vision" of the future of 
European cooperation while working closely with Germany which is 
to hold the presidency during the second half of this year. 
  The French strategy was outlined at a press conference by 
Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and European Affairs Minister Alain 
Lamassoure. 
  France, like Germany, had an ambition to see a "greater 
Europe," Juppe said. The Union was "honour bound" with respect 
to countries which had emerged from communism in East Europe. 
  But he warned that once Finland, Sweden, Norway and Austria 
had joined the Union as planned at the beginning of next year, 
there should be no further enlargement without appropriate 
reform of EU institutions. 
  France wanted to avoid a situation in which the arrival of 
new members gave substance to the British view that the European 
Union should be reduced to a free-trade area without political 
ambitions. 
  A review of EU institutions has been planned for 1996. 
Hungary and Poland have applied to join the Union. The Czech 
republic is thought likely also to apply. Germany supports 
their applications. 
  Juppe said he hoped that countries likely to draw closer to 
the Union, or to join it, should establish relations of "good 
neighbourliness" among themselves. 
  He noted that on May 26 and 27 Paris would host a conference 
to launch the so-called stability pact which is intended to help 
settle problems concerning minorities and frontiers in Central 
and East Europe. 
  Regarding peace, Juppe stressed the need for coordination 
between the separate functions of the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organisation (NATO) and the Western European Union (WEU), which 
is the only wholly European body with competence for defence. 
  He recalled that France and Germany had offered countries in 
East Europe the status of associate membership of the WEU. 
  Juppe also said that the revision of European institutions 
from 1996 should be an opportunity formally to include 
Strasbourg in the European treaties as the home of the European 
parliament to put an end to a dispute with those who favour 
Brussels. 
  On unemployment, Juppe said that a white paper by the EU 
commission on employment, which had been adopted by the 12 EU 
countries last year, should be taken into consideration. 
  The white paper argued the case for an increase in 
flexibility within the labour market and for a reduction of 
social levies so as to reduce the cost of labour. 
  He also stressed the importance of a programme planned by 
the 
Union for major public works in the sectors of transportation 
and communication networks in order to give concrete meanin to 
efforts to boost the economy. 
  Juppe was cautious about the nomination of Silvio Berlusconi 
as Prime Minister of Italy. 
  Leading figures of the French left-wing opposition have 
called for a boycott of neo-Facsict ministers in the new Italian 
government. 
  Juppe aaid that he wanted to be able to continue "working in 
confidence" with the government in Rome, holding that a 
judgement of its policies would not be possible for several 
weeks or months. 
  He was also reticent with regard to who might succeed 
Frenchman Jacques Delors as President of the EU Commission. A 
decision is to be taken in Corfu in June and Juppe said merely 
that he had "clear ideas" on the matter. 
  French diplomatic circles frequently mention the name of 
Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, a Flemish Christian 
Democrat. Britain favours current Commission Vice President Sir 
Leon Brittan who has made a name as a proponent of free trade 
under EU competition laws, analysts noted.
