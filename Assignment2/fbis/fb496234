  [Text] The talks started more than five months ago in 
Paris. Today, Israel and the PLO signed an agreement laying the 
framework for economic relations between the Jewish state and 
the self-governing territories under Palestinian control. Trade 
tariffs, the currency to be used, and taxation policy were at 
the center of the talks. Here is Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, 
who welcomed both delegations this morning: 
  [Begin Juppe recording] There will be obstacles on the road 
to peace, there were in the past. All those who prefer war to 
peace will attempt to derail this process. There were 
horrendous attacks on both sides, however the process continues. 
Those who chose peace with great courage and with a sense of 
responsibility and statesmanship will win, and they deserve 
admiration, I mean Yitzhaq Rabin, Shim'on Peres, Yasir 'Arafat, 
and all his team. 
  International affairs bring us their daily share of 
disasters, from time to time there is an international event to 
cheer us up. There was the Oslo agreement on 13 September last 
year, now there are elections in South Africa, a country that I 
visited two or three months ago. I was also impressed by the 
role played by two outstanding men, Nelson Mandela and President 
de Klerk. Despite the attacks, I am convinced that these men 
and this people have such strength that the future of South 
Africa can be contemplated with optimism. This is France's 
belief and France will lend its support. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Francois Leotard by Jacques </F>
Isnard; place and date not given: "Leotard: `It Is for the 
Next Head of State To Modernize the Nuclear Arsenal'"-- first 
two paragraphs are LE MONDE introduction] 
  [Text] In an interview with LE MONDE, Francois Leotard 
rejects the criticisms made of the proposed 1995-2000 military 
programming law by those who accuse him of having made no 
choices. "It is not a law which pleases everybody nor a simple 
piece of transitional legislation," the defense minister 
retorted, adding: "There are only choices" in this government 
program. 
  It is for the next head of state to choose the new nuclear 
panoply which is to coexist with the strategic submarines, Mr. 
Leotard also said. 
  [Isnard] You have been defense minister for a year. You have 
drawn up a white paper and a military programming law. Your 
opponents say that these two texts are, in reality, cohabitation 
"bastards." What is your response to those who accuse you of 
having made no choices? 
  [Leotard] There are only choices in this programming law, 
from the launch of the new program for a precision weapon fired 
over a long distance (APTGD), to the postponement of the M-5 
nuclear missile! There is the choice of simulation for the 
nuclear sphere, the choice of a new-generation attack submarine, 
the choice of military use of space, the choice of strengthening 
the intelligence service, the choice of greater 
professionalization of the army, and so forth. Those who talk 
of "nonchoices" are in fact criticizing three aspects of 
government policy: that of having failed to make a decision on 
the future of the Albion Plateau; that of having failed to 
decide on any program; and that of having failed to launch new 
programs. 
  On the first point, our fellow citizens will understand that 
it will be for the next head of state to give guidelines on 
whether or not to maintain the second "component" of our nuclear 
deterrent force.[.sup]1[/] This question could clearly not 
be answered in the programming law. 
  A word on the second point: If none of the existing major 
programs has been canceled, it is mainly because I thought the 
priority was to equip the forces and because virtually all the 
equipment programs have reached the production and delivery 
phase. It is also because the maintenance of some programs 
carried out in cooperation struck me as essential to avoid 
killing a European defense system at birth. 
  Finally, the third point is that it is true that only one 
major new program -- that of the ATPGD -- has been included in 
the law. Others will only be included once the vital 
preconditions for their implementation have been established: 
commitment by our European partners; agreement on the military 
specifications; and the availability of industrial structures 
guaranteeing an implementation of the programs at a lesser cost. 
<H5>  `Not Preparing for the Last War' </H5>
  Far from being a simple "transitional program," this bill is 
the result of three major guidelines: giving the Armed Forces 
tools which are in keeping with operational requirements as 
defined by the white paper; maintaining and developing 
cooperation at the European level; not making a "mess of a 
program" by hastily launching ill-defined, badly negotiated, and 
badly organized arms programs, for which the state would not 
have the means of funding in the medium term. I do not see how 
cohabitation could influence the outlook to the year 2010 (the 
period covered by the white paper), the date when the third 
presidential term after 1995 will start. 
  [Isnard] What could be called the "archetype" of the wars 
which threaten French interests? Is it the Gulf war or the war 
in the Balkans? 
  [Leotard] There is probably no archetype. The wars which 
have already taken place will not recur. And, although we 
should learn from them, it strikes me as dangerous to try to 
refer to them too much. It is in this way, by lack of thought 
and imagination, that you prepare for the last war, i.e., the 
one which will not take place, and are helpless when faced with 
the war which does occur. It is perhaps time we avoided 
repeating past mistakes which have cost us so dear. I think 
that this is what the white paper does very well. 
  It takes six scenarios. The first two are: "a regional 
conflict not threatening our vital interests" and "a regional 
conflict which could threaten our vital interests," in which the 
most plausible situations with which we could be faced are 
described. Large and modern forces would be involved. We would 
very probably act within coalitions, as was the case during the 
Gulf war. These two scenarios have served to quantify the 
conventional strength of the three services and to define their 
structures and methods of action. The services and their 
equipment will be established in several stages. The 1995-2000 
programming law which I will shortly submit to parliament will 
be the first of these. 
  The white paper adds four more scenarios to these two: 
First, attack on national territorial integrity outside the 
mainland; second, implementation of bilateral defense 
agreements; third, operations to promote peace and international 
law; fourth, the resurgence of a major threat to West Europe 
which alone justifies the maintenance of adequate and credible 
deterrent forces. 
  [Isnard] You have described the United Nations as a 
"contraption." However, France is delegating to it the maximum 
number of blue helmets. Should our actions not in future be 
prioritized more effectively? 
  [Leotard] I used General de Gaulle's expression to express 
legitimate frustration at some inconsistencies. Everybody has 
been able to observe that the United Nations' involvement in 
peacekeeping operations has changed completely in two or three 
years. First in its scale, because the number of blue helmets 
in the world, which was 5,000 in 1989, peaked at 80,000 in 1993. 
Second, in its form, because peaceful intervention between 
consenting warring sides has been replaced by action closer to a 
war operation, for instance in Somalia and Yugoslavia. 
  It was inevitable that the United Nations, also a victim of 
the inherently cumbersome nature of a humanitarian organization, 
should find it difficult to adapt. Criticisms were justified. 
The French Government made them. I handed a memorandum on this 
subject from Mr. Balladur to Mr. Butrus-Ghali back in the summer 
of 1993. But the United Nations is still the international 
community's framework of law and intervention. It must adapt to 
the new crises it is facing, and France intends to help it do 
that. 
  [Isnard] The impression is that the discussions between NATO 
and the WEU [Western European Union] are becoming bogged down 
with regard to the establishment of the flexible instruments of 
command and conduct of operations, namely the multinational and 
joint army forces groups.[.sup]2[/] Is this a sign of the 
United States' insincerity or proof that a European defense 
identity, which is being discussed so much, is difficult to 
develop? 
  [Leotard] I do not think you can say that they have become 
bogged down. Since January, NATO has been working on the 
implementation of the Partnership for Peace, which was its 
priority. In this sphere, everything went remarkably quickly, 
because 14 countries have adhered to it. And I note that the 
Americans and the Europeans have cooperated in a spirit in 
keeping with the declaration of the 10 January summit. I 
welcome that fact. 
  What we need to do, in fact, is carry out a comparable 
exercise for the multinational and joint Armed Forces groups. 
The work has started in Brussels and I can tell you that it is 
taking place in the same spirit. I have high hopes of seeing it 
succeed in keeping with our wishes. 
  [Isnard] How can we resolve this inconsistency between the 
fact that Western societies do not accept the idea of sacrifice, 
i.e, what the general staffs call the concept of "zero death 
war" at home, and the observation that there are increasingly 
menacing dangers around them? 
  [Leotard] The concept of "zero death war" is ridiculous and 
dangerous. War, when you resort to it or respond to it, is 
still violence. Democratic states still find it difficult to 
respond to this violence. But they must accept the idea of 
sacrifice if they stand by their values. You can only 
effectively defend what you love by risking your life. Winston 
Churchill's remark is still relevant. You think you have the 
choice between shame and war. If you choose shame, you have war. 
  [Isnard] You are accused of introducing a two-speed army. 
On the one hand, a heavy territorial structure and a 
territorial defense which involves a large numbers of men. On 
the other, a "projectable" army of 100,000 operational soldiers 
for overseas actions. How can they be made to coexist? 
  [Leotard] The white paper sets as the objective of the army, 
the creation of "projectable" forces of between 120,000 and 
130,000 men, professional soldiers and conscripts. This figure 
should be compared with the 227,000 soldiers which this army 
will have in the year 2000. Around 100,000 men and women will 
therefore be carrying out other essential tasks, such as 
providing support, training, and instruction; national service 
conscript management; preparing for mobilization; and overseeing 
the functioning of the territorial structure and the central 
general staffs. They will also have the task of carrying out 
the permanent mission of monitoring of territorial security. 
  It is not a two-speed army but an army refocused on its 
operational missions at the cost of a reduction in support and 
territorial structures. We cannot be asked to learn from the 
Gulf war and be criticized for doing so. 
<H5>  European Option </H5>
  [Isnard] Another criticism consists of accusing you of 
manufacturing an army of prototypes. Orders are being reduced 
and delayed or even put on the back burner. Because of a 
failure to choose, a little of everything is being done in 
homeopathic doses, at the risk of having nothing but samples. 
  [Leotard] The programming law has precisely given priority 
to 
the manufacture of equipment and the completion of as many as 
possible ongoing programs, the aim being to breaking with the 
old rationale which you condemn. Priority must be given to 
equipping our forces. The current situation reminds us of that. 
Let us cite the programs which have been maintained: the 
nuclear-powered aircraft carrier; the naval version of the 
Rafale plane; the nuclear attack submarine, whose launch is even 
being brought forward; the Horizon frigate; the Leclerc tank; 
the space programs (Syracuse and Helios). These are by far the 
most numerous. 
  It is true that some will be postponed. The NH-90 
helicopter, for instance, fulfills a real need. That is why 
this program is being maintained. However, its specifications 
were very elaborate because it had been designed in the days of 
the Cold War. It was necessary to go back to the drawing board, 
review it completely, and reduce the costs. A saving of 30 
percent is being targeted. What was to be done. Halt the 
program and hence not respond to a real operational need? That 
would have been inconsistent with my desire to give priority to 
equipping our forces. 
  The first choice is to give priority to manufacture: 75 
percent of funds will be devoted to it in the year 2000. This 
choice imposes a constraint on research and development whose 
relative share is being reduced. This choice results, first, 
from a concern for greater efficiency in the management of 
public funds. I am convinced that we can do as much with a 
little less. Second, it results from my European conviction. 
The gradual building of a European defense industry will make 
it possible to have a greater sharing of knowledge and reduce 
duplication in public research spending. I am banking on 
Europe. However, I made sure that funds for the most basic 
research are being maintained. 
  The second choice is the great selectivity I have shown in 
limiting the number of new programs launched. There will be the 
program for the submarine to replace the current attack 
submarines, the French cruise missile, funds for launching the 
design of the future antiship missile, and the heavy transport 
plane. But these are the only new programs. 
  The third choice is that of industry and, hence, of the 
economy and employment: 600,000 jobs are involved in 
high-technology sectors with strong civilian activity. I have 
reduced the spending on the Armed Forces' infrastructure in 
order to increase the effort toward industry. Competence has 
been maintained and the overall spending plans confirmed. I 
believe that at a time when our industrialists are negotiating 
rapprochements among themselves or with foreign partners and 
when they were thus contributing to the shaping of European 
defense, my responsibility is to give each as much chance as 
possible to enable France to play the role it deserves in this 
sphere. 
  [Isnard] You have called on industrialists to eradicate 
"waste" and to aim at productivity increases of 2 percent per 
year. In so doing, you urged them to reconsider and reduce the 
specifications and performances of their equipment. Can we have 
a "discount" defense system? 
  [Leotard] There are two different and complementary 
approaches. 
  First, the reduction in the specifications of the equipment. 
My concern is twofold. First, to take some programs originally 
designed during the Cold War back to the drawing board so as to 
adapt them to the strategic context described in the white 
paper. The example is the NH-90. The second is to gradually 
change the Defense Ministry's designing methodology to ensure 
that, each time an additional specification is requested, 
questions are asked about its cost before the decision is made. 
This depends on better dialogue among the industrialists and 
the different components of my ministry. In short, it means 
moving toward a more efficient and more responsible ministry. 
  The second complementary approach is that of increases in 
productivity. It consists of asking industrialists to be more 
efficient, to do the same thing at a lower cost. This is doing 
them a service, because it enables them to be more competitive 
and to improve their chances of exports. 
  This is certainly not a "discount" defense, nor does it mean 
equipment inferior to that of others. It is a question of 
asking everybody to be more efficient, to do better with the 
same. You only have to compare our know-how and the performance 
of our equipment. We are still among the best in the world: 
The performance of our nuclear submarines, the success of the 
Rafale program, and the technological advance of the Leclerc 
tank bear witness to this. I think that rigorous management is 
part of my responsibility. We owe the citizens of our country 
this assurance. 
Footnotes 
  1. The strategic missile-launching nuclear submarines form 
the first component. There are two others: the Mirage-IV 
bombers (to be withdrawn from service in 1996) and the Albion 
Plateau missiles in Haute-Provence. 
  2. This is NATO's plan (which France supports) to create 
multinational and joint Armed Forces general staffs, which the 
Americans call CJTF [Combined Joint Task Forces].

<F P=106> [Report by Olivier Provost: "Military Planning Law Requires </F>
European Cooperation"] 
  [Text] Condemned by its critics as Hobson's choice military 
planning, the 1995-2000 programming law is being clearly 
defended by its authors at the Defense Ministry. They insist on 
stressing its coherence and especially the considerable trust 
placed in Europe. This is proved by the fact that future weapons 
research has been kept at the same level, but reduced as an 
overall percentage of the plan. This ratio, referred to as the 
CRED (Research, Study, and Development Credit), was fixed at 6 
percent of the annual budget. When the account for ground 
arsenals, which are grouped together in Giat Industries, was 
closed, the figure was 5.6 percent. It will further drop to 5.3 
percent. The distribution ratio between military equipment 
manufacturers and research and development facilities will 
therefore switch from 70:30 in 1994 to 75:25 by the year 2000. 
R&amp;D credits will drop from 16.2 billion francs [Fr] per year 
to 
Fr14 billion. 
  The logic behind this is the need to supply the Armed Forces 
with the resources they rapidly require. In the eyes of the 
authorities, there is no question of reliving the experience of 
the mid-eighties, when a new fighter aircraft, a new tank, new 
helicopters, missiles, ships, an aircraft carrier, and 
submarines were all planned at the same time, representing more 
than Fr700 billion-worth of programs to be financed. However, 
above all, this brake on research budgets, while the overall 
military planning budget is rising by 0.5 percent this year or 
even by 1.5 percent over the last three years, represents a 
clear message from the French authorities to industry: You must 
cooperate on the European level. This should make it possible 
to limit the amount of parallel work being carried out in the 
European defense industry and to share the costs that each 
company previously bore alone. At the Defense Ministry it is 
stressed that its decision to reduce the CRED is in line with 
its "policy of champions" and "technological choices" in the 
weapons industry. 
<H5>  Effective Cooperation </H5>
  Thus, the future fighter aircraft destined to succeed the 
Rafale will have to be produced as part of a cooperation 
project. Dassault Aviation is already working in this field 
with British Aerospace, while Dassault Electronique is working 
with GEC [General Electricity Company]. The Tigre and NH-90 
helicopters (French-German for the former and 
French-Dutch-Italian for the latter) have been saved, although 
costs have been revised downward. Where ships are concerned, 
the Horizon frigate program (France, Great Britain, and Italy) 
shows the way ahead. 
  Officials have not hesitated to force industrial groups to 
cooperate by whittling down their R&amp;D credits. They stress 
that 
the military planning law, which provides for overall annual 
growth, will enable French weapons companies to increase their 
military revenues (excluding exports) significantly by the year 
2000.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Leotard Decides To Launch Helios II </F>
Satellites"] 
  [Text] Defense Minister Francois Leotard recently decided 
to implement the definition phase of the Helios II military 
ground observation satellite program, which, for the time being, 
is solely French. Compared with Helios I (two optical 
observation satellites, one of which will be put into orbit at 
the start of 1995), the Helios II program will develop 
higher-capacity satellites which will use infrared technology to 
see at night as well as during the day and even in bad weather 
conditions. They are due to enter service in the year 2001. 
The overall program will cost 10 billion francs [Fr] (for two 
satellites), including Fr770 million for the definition phase. 
The Helios I program, run jointly with Italy (14 percent) and 
Spain (7 percent), had been estimated at almost Fr8 billion. 
The Helios II program initially provides for the launch of a 
satellite in 1999, 2001, 2004, and 2006.

<F P=106> [Article by Jacques Isnard: "United States Has Bagged 70 </F>
Percent of Mideast Arms Market Since 1991"] 
  [Text] In a steadily declining world arms market, France is 
finding it more and more difficult to export its military 
equipment, or even keep its current clients. The United States, 
meanwhile, is consolidating its position as the world's largest 
arms supplier, while the Middle East remains far and away the 
biggest buyer. There is a connection between these two facts: 
The 1991 Gulf war had and continues to have immense impact on 
the market, and France--unlike the United States, which has 
carried off more than two-thirds of the arms trade in the 
region--has not yet reaped the benefits, appearances 
notwithstanding. 
  Arms exports globally have fallen by close to two-thirds in 
the last 10 years, according to estimates (expressed in current 
dollars) from the US Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA). 
Exports for 1984 totaled $72.8 billion, while the 1992 figure 
was $25.5 billion. The decline is thus perceptible. Exports to 
the Middle East have declined proportionately, but the latter 
remains the number one regional market for the arms trade, with 
three major clients: Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates 
[UAE], and Israel. Iraq was at the top of the list for some 
time, but the post-Gulf war embargo war ended that, and nowadays 
Egypt, Qatar, and Kuwait, to cite only a few examples, are much 
bigger customers. 
  L'ARMEMENT, a review published by the General Delegation for 
Armaments (DGA), focuses attention in its latest issue on the 
fact that the United States has won about 70 percent of the 
contracts signed in the Gulf since the war against Saddam 
Husayn. More than one-third of all American arms deliveries go 
to this region--more precisely, to Saudi Arabia and Israel, the 
biggest beneficiaries of what the Americans call FMS (foreign 
military sales): government-to-government transfers, and even 
gifts, of material. The practice has accelerated since the Gulf 
war, says L'ARMEMENT, since the volume of this new type of 
transaction has tripled over the last five years. 
  France, by contrast, is cutting a rather pathetic figure. Of 
course, it is not doing as badly as the arms makers would have 
people believe. But the general trend is down, with annual sales 
over the next few years expected to average about 30 billion 
French francs [Fr]. According to provisional estimates, orders 
taken in 1993 totaled about Fr40 billion, down 12 to 13 percent 
from the Fr45.7 billion in 1992. Ten years ago, orders amounted 
to almost Fr62 billion. The defense minister had hoped new 
orders for 1993 would reach at least Fr50 billion, but the 
target was not met. True, 1992 saw an unusual surge with 
Taiwan's order (more than Fr30 billion all by itself) for 60 
Mirage 2000-5. But a new trend seems to be emerging that could 
further aggravate France's already delicate position: Some 
clients--and not just minor ones, since they are Middle East 
countries--are reneging on contracts already signed between the 
two states. 
  This is what is happening in Kuwait. That country's 
legislative body has reopened the issue of financing terms for 
the order of 155mm artillery pieces from France. The Kuwaiti 
Army had apparently underestimated the extra costs, beyond 
actual acquisition, involved in putting these batteries into 
service. In its Wednesday 6 April issue, the weekly strategic 
newsletter TTU--known for getting its information from highly 
reliable sources--claims to have learned that Kuwait did not 
really need the French arms but signed the contract to "commit a 
still-reluctant France" to play an active role in the area. 
  It is also happening in the UAE. In 1993, France sold it 390 
Leclerc battle tanks--not counting about fifty armored emergency 
repair vehicles--for the sum of Fr21 billion. On condition that 
French manufacturers involved in the deal reinvest Fr15 billion 
in the country as an offset. The two parties are having serious 
problems identifying domains of possible cooperation, and the 
UAE are now leaping on this pretext, threatening to renegotiate 
the entire contract if the investment commitment is not met. 
  In Saudi Arabia, whose leaders are already being quietly 
urged to renegotiate the country's contracts with France for 
maintenance of warships and missiles, the vicissitudes of the 
Kuwaiti deal are being followed very closely. In fact, the 
Saudis too are considering a purchase of Leclerc tanks, and 
their current budgetary problems scarcely incline them toward 
generosity in their dealings with France.

<F P=106> [Article by Yves Mamou: "CSA Calls For Further Reform in </F>
Audiovisual Sector"] 
  [Text] The proposed reforms to the audiovisual regulatory 
code which CSA [High Audiovisual Council] recently presented to 
the deputies and senators in compliance with Article 1 of the 1 
February 1994 law will very likely prove embarrassing to the 
government. Anxious in wake of the Rousselet "affair" not to 
stir up more controversy on the high-visibility media scene, the 
government had almost decided against introducing a new 
legislative package to complement the one promulgated 2 months 
ago after much debate. 
  One of CSA's recommendations is to reestablish for M6--and 
only for M6--the right to two commercial interruptions during 
the screening of fictional presentations. And it is likely to 
set off another uproar in the public and private television 
sector. "The little station on the move" reacted quickly: 
Nicolas de Tavernost, general manager of M6, said he was happy 
with this "unequivocal position," adding that he planned to 
"collar the communications minister on Friday 8 April to ask him 
to prepare implementing legislation as quickly as possible." 
Although CSA believes that the financial impact of such a 
measure--130 million French francs [Fr]--will not "greatly 
distort the structure" of the advertising market, TF1 surely 
will not accept the risk of losing market share without trying 
to do something about it. 
  With regard to public television service, CSA thinks a 
decree 
should be issued to clarify once and for all the "structures" of 
France-Television's common presidency. CSA also deems it 
"indispensable for the state to assign specific missions" to 
each station and clearly specify authorized areas of 
cooperation. Which is one way of saying it is high time for the 
government to make public the terms and conditions of the France 
2 and France 3 charters. 
<H5>  Juridical Vacuums </H5>
  Concerning advertising, the council reiterated its desire to 
see advertising authorized on local television stations for the 
distribution sector. This is a step it will be difficult for the 
government to take, so long as newspaper publishers (and 
especially the daily regional press) are so intensely fearful of 
it. Regarding broadcasting quotas, the CSA says they have 
"proved themselves" even though further improvements could be 
made on production obligations, to support European 
coproductions. CSA even goes so far as to opine that the French 
regulatory code could "constitute a model for the European law." 
  On the subject of cable television, CSA notes the code does 
not specify procedures for withdrawing an operator's 
authorization once issued, even though the council has received 
"several" requests from communes that want to change operators. 
Also, it points out that the absence of decrees on the subject 
means there is no certification procedure for stations that 
broadcast via telecommunications satellites. Lacking too is any 
"administrative sanctions regime" for cable stations or cable 
operators parallel to the "contractual penalties" currently in 
force. CSA would not be unhappy to see "criminal sanctions" 
instituted either. 
  Finally, the council submitted a long list of draft decrees 
"not yet issued" by the government whose "rapid promulgation 
would put an end to the current juridical vacuums"; included are 
decrees covering advertising on local radio stations, minimum 
service in event of a public-sector strike, sports event 
exclusives, and obligations of stations that broadcase via 
telecommunications satellites. 
  CSA notes that other measures still on hold include the new 
charter for Radio-France-Outremer (RFO), the decree on the 52 
additional motion pictures authorized for television, and even 
the new decrees establishing the obligations of cable stations, 
which are needed "urgently" though "the government has not even 
submitted drafts."

<F P=106> [Report signed "D.Gd.": "Military Report Describes Emeraude </F>
Accident"] 
  [Text] No human error and no nuclear contamination: Those 
are the main conclusions of the military commission of inquiry 
set up to look into the accident on board the nuclear-powered 
attack submarine [SNA] Emeraude on 30 March, in which 10 crew 
members died. In a communique summarizing the report (150 pages 
sent to the public prosecutor in Marseilles), the Defense 
Ministry reconstructed the accident which occurred during 
maneuvers off Toulon. According to this version of events, the 
submarine was submerged at 190 meters. Between two training 
phases, the commander (who was among the victims) carried out a 
"section inspection" in the turbo-alternator compartment that 
"had been planned several weeks earlier to be done on that day." 
  At 10:35, 12 men were in the compartment when "a leak 
occurred in the sea water refrigeration collector." This leak 
was not, therefore, in the external hull but in an internal 
pipe. The "energy" officer left the compartment to return to 
the central navigation station, while emergency maneuvers were 
made to resurface the vessel in 100 seconds: Power was upped to 
increase speed, the sea water circuits were closed to prevent 
flooding, and the ballast tanks were emptied to accelerate 
resurfacing. 
  It was probably this combination of operations that led to 
"overpressure in one of the condensers," and then the "breaking 
of a clack plug, causing steam to pour into the compartment." 
Ten submariners were killed instantly by barotraumatism causing 
their eardrums and lungs to explode. One man managed to survive 
by taking refuge in the forward section of the compartment. The 
communique added: "The commission of inquiry found no evidence 
of human error attributable to the crew members at the time of 
the accident." Our sources tell us that a mechanic, responsible 
for closing two outlets to stop the steam escaping when the 
ascent was started, only had time to close one of them before he 
was killed. The Defense Ministry authorized the six SNAs that 
had been recalled for checks to once again take to the sea, 
instructing the "immediate closure of the steam circuits in the 
event of a water leak." However, it appears difficult to 
implement steam shutdown when a water leak appears, since it is 
necessary for rapid resurfacing.

beginning Tuesday evening we will start to discuss the names of 
ministers." This was said by newly appointed Prime Minister 
Silvio Berlusconi, who also said that the new government's

be enriched through the meetings." 
  Berlusconi said that as well as members of Forza Italia, the 
Northern League, and the National Alliance, "members of other 
political forces, technocrats, professionals, and public 
managers" with the right qualifications will be able to join the 
executive.

  [Text] "We will never say to Berlusconi: Either you give us 
that ministry or we are not staying. We are not going down the 
same path as the Northern League because they are behaving like 
the old parties. We will instead ask for absolute clarity about 
the program and we are sticking to our guns on this." This was 
said by Gianfranco Fini [leader of the National Alliance] during 
the the MSI-AN [Italian Social Movement-National Alliance] 
central committee meeting. 
  According to Fini, the MSI and AN should be "the 
government's 
engine," and the government's program will have to contain clear 
commitments concerning "national unity, north-south solidarity, 
support for the weak, economic incentives, and a fight against 
waste and party power."

Northern League leader Umberto Bossi was asked if he would 
reiterate his demands for the Interior Ministry. Bossi 
answered: "Of course, even if we are going to discuss this next

  He said that agreement has been reached over the program, 
and 
that problems might arise when we get round to filling the

  Bossi left the meeting certain that Berlusconi and Fini have

<F P=106> [Interview with Roberto Maroni, Italian Northern League </F>
lower house floor leader, by Stefano Marroni; place and date not 
given: "Berlusconi Wants Di Pietro as a Minister" -- first 
paragraph is LA REPUBBLICA introduction] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- [passage omitted] "There is a real 
problem," the League's second-in-command, Roberto Maroni 
explained, "and that is that this government, already grappling 
with so many problems, must not also tackle working in a climate 
of sharp conflict in the country. In order to prevent this, a 
great deal depends on the Left. But a great deal also depends on 
the majority, on what signs we issue: In our choice of ministers 
and in the procedures to reform the Constitution. This, because 
government responsibility is ours and because otherwise there 
would be a system of clubby politics. The formulation of the 
rules is another matter which concerns the whole of parliament." 
  [Marroni] One thing at a time, Mr. Maroni. What do you mean 
when you say that a great deal depends on the Left? 
  [Maroni] I mean that the Left must decide what to do. It is 
not I that should tell you this. Do they want to entrench 
themselves in their citadel, do they want to continue making an 
issue about [lower house speaker] Pivetti's being anti-Semitic? 
Well, they are entirely free to do so. But they must realize 
that this will have an effect on the government's composition. 
  [Marroni] In what way? 
  [Maroni] Look, I do not think that people can believe that 
the League is speaking out on the question of the ministries 
simply because it is seeking some for itself. There are some 
specific political issues behind this. One of them concerns the 
functioning of the Interior Ministry, the need to bring together 
all the responsibilities regarding local government which are at 
present divided between four or five ministries -- those of the 
interior, public works, finance, public administration. Local 
authorities must be given certainties; they must not be 
confronted with the fact that on the same issue -- do you 
remember the repayment of the ICI [Municipal Real Estate Tax]? 
-- the Finance Ministry issues a circular which says one thing 
and the Interior Ministry another which states the contrary. 
But that is not all; we are raising a much wider issue.... 
  [Marroni] Namely? 
  [Maroni] It is obvious: We do not want to force the Left to 
seek street confrontations. To this end it is important that 
the key ministries not be occupied by representatives of a 
single party: If Berlusconi thinks he can claim the prime 
ministership and the interior, foreign, treasury, and defense 
ministries, then he is very much mistaken. 
  [Marroni] Why, is Berlusconi seeking a confrontation? 
  [Maroni] Not at all. I have spoken with Berlusconi; he is 
very much aware of the problem. In any case, pardon me for 
asking, but why is he so keen on having [Radical leader] 
Pannella in the government? 
  [Marroni] Yes, why? 
  [Maroni] Because Pannella has led him to believe that he is 
the link with the Left. Whereas, in fact the PDS [Democratic 
Party of the Left] does not care about Pannella in the least. 
And this is why Pannella is now attacking us -- because it is 
we who are conducting a dialogue with the Left, because we could 
constitute this link. 
  [Marroni] Well, perhaps in fact he is attacking you because 
you do not want him as a minister.... 
  [Maroni] Look, on the whole I have nothing against it. The 
National Alliance was the first to veto Pannella's becoming 
foreign minister. And with regard to the Justice Ministry, I 
agree with much of what Marco [Pannella] has to say. But, I 
repeat: If the aim is not to seek a confrontation, what is the 
point of provoking the magistrates by making Pannella justice 
minister? Because, if that happens, a conflict is guaranteed. 
  [Marroni] As far as you are concerned, however, your real 
dispute with Berlusconi seems to be over the Interior Ministry. 
A separation cannot take place in a matter of weeks.... 
  [Maroni] I know, but the law is clear: There is six months 
in which to transfer responsibilities. There could be many 
solutions in the meantime. 
  [Marroni] There is something else that is not clear, 
however: 
Do you really want to be minister of the interior? 
  [Maroni] Of course. The problem is that someone, let us say 
someone very high up, does not want a League member as interior 
minister.... 
  [Marroni] Because of the business of the three Italies.... 
  [Maroni] Not at all: That is a pretext, the result of the 
fact that you journalists insist on portraying Miglio as the 
"League's ideologue." No, look, nobody is afraid that we will 
quietly start erecting border fences. They are afraid -- and 
rightly so -- that closets will be opened at the Interior 
Ministry, that people will discover what has happened in past 
years, what happened at Ustica. This is why Costa or Cossiga are 
being mentioned -- to keep the lid down tight.... 
  [Marroni] Who does Berlusconi want as interior minister? One 
of his own men, or who? 
  [Maroni] It seems to me that [Judge] Di Pietro's name is 
emerging again, is it not? 
  [Marroni] Is he Berlusconi's candidate? 
  [Maroni] Let us say that it would please him greatly.... 
But, you know, it is difficult to know what will happen, with 
so many people putting themselves forward to serve the country 
as interior minister.... 
  [Marroni] Why, is Di Pietro putting himself forward? 
  [Maroni] No, I was not talking about him. It is just that it 
is not we who are having meetings with Di Pietro....

  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The Milan Public Prosecutor's 
office has sensationally asked for 37 politicians and 
businessmen involved in the Enimont affair to stand trial. This 
was the same affair for which financier Sergio Cusani was tried 
and found guilty. Dario Carella reports from the Milan 
courthouse. 
  [Carella] [passage omitted] Chief Public Prosecutor Borrelli 
said that Deputy Prosecutor Antonio Di Pietro has requested to 
Examining Judge Italo Ghitti that 37 people, mostly politicians, 
stand trial on various charges connected with the Enimont 
investigation. Among the 37 are Northern League leader Umberto 
Bossi, former Northern League treasurer Alessandro Patelli, 
[former Prime Minister] Bettino Craxi, [Italian Republican Party 
leader] Giorgio La Malfa, [former Justice Minister] Claudio 
Martelli, [former Italian Liberal Party leader] Renato 
Altissimo, Pino Berlini, Luigi Bisignani, Montedison's Carlo 
Sama, ENI's Alberto Grotti, [former Foreign Minister] Gianni De 
Michelis, [former Christian Democratic Party Treasurer] Severino 
Citaristi, [former Prime Minister] Arnaldo Forlani, [former 
Italian Liberal Party Minister] Egidio Sterpa, [former Milan 
Mayor] Paolo Pillitteri, and [former Budget Minister] Paolo 
Cirino Pomicino. 
  Turning to the one billion lire that was allegedly paid to 
the Italian Communist Party -- the Milan Criminal Court's Second 
Section also found Cusani guilty in relation to this. Borrelli 
said that as yet it is not known to whom the one billion lire 
was physically paid, and no decision has been made for the time 
being. Borrelli stressed `for the time being,' so the 
investigations are continuing.

<F P=106> [Report by Ingrid Steiner: "The Package Must Be Improved </F>
After Two Years"] 
  [Text] "Privately a gentlemen, politically a pure-blooded 
fascist": This is how opponents describe Pietro Mitolo, the 
head of the neofascists (MSI -- Movimento Sociale Italiano) in 
South Tirol. As a result of the neofascists' entering the 
Government in Rome, Mitolo sees his opportunity to push through 
longstanding demands. In an interview with KURIER, he 
said: 

  -  About autonomy: "I do not want to abolish autonomy. 
However, two years after the conclusion of the `package' the 
results must be analyzed and improved accordingly. We demand 
more flexibility in particular regarding the implementation of 
proportional representation in line with ethnic groups for 
official functions and in the application of 
bilingualism." 
  -  About the economic advantages of South Tirol's 
autonomy: "We have all benefited. But the Germans have 
benefited most. The subsidies for agriculture, trade, and 
tourism mostly benefited the Germans. A balance must be 
established here." 
  -  About the Treaty of Osimo: "It was concluded 
between Italy and Yugoslavia. However, Yugoslavia does not 
exist any longer. From the legal point of view, Slovenia and 
Croatia did not sign the Treaty. Therefore, the situation must 
be reexamined and one must insist that the Italian minority 
there is treated better." 
  -  About the border at Brenner: "Here 
the situation is quite different. The Treaty of Osimo is a 
product of the Cold War. But the border at Brenner was set down 
after World War I in the Treaties of Saint Germain. And Austria 
said in these treaties that it forever renounces territorial 
claims south of the Brenner [Pass]. No compromise on this 
matter is possible for us. It has been concluded once and for 
all." 
  -  About a "Europe of regions": "We do not want a European 
region of Tirol (with the inclusion of North Tirol--KURIER 
editor's note). The European region of Trentino-South Tirol 
already exists, and it must be strengthened. But if one desires 
a common region within a larger framework, that is, with North 
Tirol, then this is possible only together with Lombardy and 
Veneto."

  [Excerpts] Interior Minister Antoni Asuncion has resigned. 
He submitted his resignation to the prime minister because he 
believes that he has political responsibilities in the Roldan 
affair. A report now from the Spanish National Radio team at 
the Ministry of the Interior on Antoni Asuncion's statements to 
the press this morning: 
  [Begin recording] [Asuncion] I have resolved to face up to 
my political responsibilities by submitting my resignation to 
the prime minister. 
  [Unidentified reporter] The flight of Luis Roldan, confirmed 
by Antoni Asuncion, led to what we have just heard: the 
resignation of the minister of the interior, who yesterday 
informed the prime minister by telephone and said that he would 
notify him in writing immediately. 
  [Asuncion] I am going to send my formal letter of 
resignation to the prime minister today, although I have already 
informed him by telephone. [passage omitted] 
  [Reporter] Meanwhile, Antoni Asuncion again asked the state 
security forces to step up their search for Luis Roldan in order 
to make him available to the examining magistrate in Madrid, who 
is Judge Ana Ferrer. [end recording]

  [Text] Felipe Gonzalez has decided to postpone the official 
visit to Romania and Bulgaria scheduled for next week, according 
to a communique released this afternoon by the Government 
Spokesman's Office. This decision may be linked with the 
request made by the Popular Party group and the United Left in 
the Congress of Deputies for Felipe Gonzalez to appear 
immediately before a plenary session of the chamber to explain 
the causes which allowed Luis Roldan to flee and the tendering 
of his resignation by the interior minister.

<F P=106> ["S.N." report: "Felipe Gonzalez at Lowest Level of </F>
Popularity Since He Arrived at Moncloa Palace"] 
  [Text] Gonzalez' popularity has fallen appreciably. 
According to a Gallup poll for ABC, only 30 Spanish people out 
of 100 now approve of his political conduct, as against 35 in 
August 1993. The loss of popularity is confirmed by the 
increase in the number of Spanish people disapproving of his 
conduct, which rises from 37 percent last year to 45 percent. 
These figures put him at the lowest level of popularity since 
he took office. 
  The figures obtained in the Gallup poll for this newspaper 
on 
people's assessment of the main political leaders show that only 
30 out of every 100 Spanish people approve of Spanish Prime 
Minister Felipe Gonzalez' political conduct. 
  These figures confirm an appreciable decline in the head of 
government's popularity with respect to last August's figures, 
when approval stood at 35 percent, and disapproval was much less 
than at present, with 37 percent in 1993. This decline in 
popularity can be seen in the fact that 45 percent of Spanish 
people now disapprove of his conduct. 
  On the other hand, these results are very similar to those 
obtained in December 1992, when Gonzalez' popularity stood at 
the lowest level since he had taken office. 
  Critical assessments of Felipe Gonzalez' role are made with 
a 
significantly higher percentage by men and individuals under the 
age of 35, belonging to the upper middle class, with higher 
education, and living in large cities. 
<H5>  Less Critical </H5>
  On the other hand, support for his conduct comes from the 
group of people characterized in the sample as older than 54, 
having incomplete primary education, and living in medium-sized 
cities. These interviewees place themselves as lower middle or 
lower class. 
  As far as People's Party leader Jose Maria Aznar is 
concerned, the percentage of approval of his work in opposition 
is 25 percent, while the disapproval figure is 45 percent. 
  When these figures concerning the political performance of 
the opposition's chief representative are compared with those of 
a year ago, a slight fall in the percentages is seen, with the 
number of those disapproving of his conduct being lower. 
  The profiles of those supporting and criticizing Jose Maria 
Aznar's performance cannot be defined in terms of an absolutely 
clear tendency. At most, it can be said that the most critical 
assessment of his conduct comes from citizens placing themselves 
in the lower middle and lower class. 
  As far as United Left Coordinator General Julio Anguita is 
concerned, it must be emphasized that, according to the Gallup 
figures, he is the politician with the least bad rating among 
those subjected to this assessment. Proof of this is the fact 
that the percentage of those assessing his conduct favorably is 
33 percent, while this figure was just 30 percent only a year 
ago. 
  These figures represent an appreciable improvement in the 
Spanish people's perception of the United Left leader. 
Moreover, those who now disapprove of his political conduct are 
35 percent, as against the 40 percent who did so in 1993. 
  For Deputy Prime Minister Narcis Serra, 21 percent is the 
figure of those approving of his political activity, while those 
disapproving of it total 40 percent. 
  According to the poll figures, the trend in the Spanish 
people's political assessment of Serra in the course of the past 
year should be deemed slightly negative, since at the beginning 
of last year 25 percent of citizens approved of his performance 
and 41 percent disapproved of it. 
<H5>  Negative Ratings </H5>
  The politician who receives the highest percentage of 
negative ratings of his conduct is Alfonso Guerra, with 53 
percent of citizens as a whole. On the other hand, the 
favorable ratings stand at 17 percent. 
  There is a marked rise in unpopularity for People's Party 
politician Rodrigo Rato. Today, 12 percent of the interviewees 
assess his conduct favorably, as against the 10 percent who did 
so at the beginning of 1993. Those who disapprove of it have 
risen from 18 percent a year ago to 32 percent at present. 
  In addition, it is important to point out that these 
assessments are completely different from those made by the 
various parties' voters. Thus it must be emphasized that 88 
percent of United Left voters approve of Julio Anguita's conduct. 
  Among People's Party voters, approval of Jose Maria Aznar 
stands at 71 percent. But Felipe Gonzalez secures the approval 
of only 59 percent of those who voted for the Socialist Party in 
June 1993. 
  In addition, the ranking order of the best known politicians 
is headed by Felipe Gonzalez and Jose Maria Aznar, who both have 
95 percent. Immediately after them come Julio Anguita and 
Alfonso Guerra, with 94 percent, respectively. A little further 
behind in the classification come Narcis Serra with 89 percent, 
and Rodrigo Rato with 65 percent.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Aznar in London To Explain People's </F>
Party Solutions to Spain's Economic Crisis"] 
  [Text] London - [Spanish People's Party leader] Jose Maria 
Aznar yesterday visited the British capital on what was 
essentially an economic mission, since one of the main items on 
his agenda was to speak in the Founders' Hall in the City of 
London before a large gathering of business representatives, 
explaining how the People's Party views the current economic 
crisis being experienced by Spain. 
  The People's Party leader stressed the situation in which 
the 
Socialist government has placed the Spanish economy, and the 
solutions that the leading opposition party is proposing to dig 
the country out of the crisis. 
<H5>  Meeting With Portillo </H5>
  In addition, Aznar lunched with the British Chief Treasury 
Secretary Michael Portillo, with whom he has good personal 
relations and who is considered to be one of the Conservative 
Party's strong men, in the same mold as former Prime Minister 
Margaret Thatcher. He also planned to meet with Foreign 
Secretary Douglas Hurd. On this occasion, Aznar's agenda did 
not include a meeting with British Prime Minister John Major, 
with whom he has had the opportunity to meet at other times. 
<H5>  Meeting With Cavaco in Lisbon </H5>
  Today, continuing with his plan of contacting European 
leaders, the People's Party leader will travel to Lisbon where 
he is to meet with Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva. One of 
the aims of this trip is to propose to the head of the 
Portuguese government that his Social Democratic Party drop the 
Liberal Democratic and Reform Group and join the European 
People's Party. The European Christian Democrats want to be the 
largest force in the European Parliament after the 12 June 
elections, which is why every effort is being made to unite all 
the associated political forces. 
  To achieve this objective, it is necessary to get other 
formations to join the People's Group in the Strasbourg 
parliament, like the Italian Christian Democratic Center which 
could pull in Berlusconi's MEP's, or those of the French 
center-right, with whom the group would acquire a major 
Christian Democratic component. 
  Cavaco Silva won the Portuguese general elections on 6 
October 1991 to become the European prime minister with the best 
endorsement from the voters, while no other head of government 
in the European Union has ever managed two absolute majorities 
with more than 50 percent of the votes. 
  Curiously, he maintains good relations with [Spanish Prime 
Minister] Felipe Gonzalez and, since both men have been 
occupying the highest position in government in their respective 
countries, bilateral relations have improved considerably and 
some of the outstanding contentious issues have been solved, to 
the extent where both men describe the change undergone as an 
"historic turning point."

  [Text] According to information received tonight by the 
Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation correspondent in New York, 
intense negotiations are to be held at the United Nations after 
the collapse of efforts by Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's 
representative in Cyprus, to implement the confidence-building 
measures. Clark is expected to arrive in New York tonight and 
will have an emergency meeting with UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali. 
  UN Security Council circles told our correspondent that 
Clark 
is disappointed with the deadlock and is seriously considering 
whether to renew his contract, which expires on 15 May.

<F P=106> [Report by Fanos Konstandinidhis] </F>
  [Excerpts] Reliable information by I MAKHI notes that 
President Glavkos Kliridhis plans to ask U.S. President Bill 
Clinton to appoint a personal envoy on the Cyprus issue who will 
act as an observer. The U.S. observer will have the same 
mission as the observer from the European Union. However, an 
effort will be made to give the U.S. observer more important 
duties and to have him submit reports directly to President 
Clinton. In this way, the U.S. President will get more involved 
in the Cyprus issue because he will have direct knowledge of 
developments. 
  As it has become known, Washington has been sounded out 
regarding the appointment of a U.S. observer and the reaction 
was not negative. 
  U.S. officials and people from President Clinton's circle 
are 
studying the request from Nicosia for the appointment of an 
observer as a substitute for the special coordinator who is 
under the State Department. 
  Nicosia estimates that the institution of the "special 
coordinator" on the Cyprus issue has not been productive so far, 
and the various "coordinators" at times did not do anything 
worthwhile, as they usually resorted to small talk and useless 
and deceiving statements. 
  In the meantime, important officials of the Greek community 
in the United States are trying to arrange for a meeting between 
President Clinton and President Kliridhis, perhaps in June in 
Washington. 
  Political and diplomatic circles stress that a possible new 
meeting between Clinton and Kliridhis, especially following the 
collapse of the proximity talks, will give the opportunity for 
personal intervention by the U.S. President in the Cyprus issue. 
Irrespective of whether a Clinton-Kliridhis meeting takes place, 
information notes that the Cyprus Government plans to ask for a 
more active involvement by Washington in the Cyprus issue. One 
of the basic issues that the Clinton Administration will be 
asked to support is Cyprus' demilitarization. 
  According to government information, the five permanent 
members of the UN Security Council view Kliridhis' proposal for 
demilitarization positively, and the government is determined to 
move toward this direction. Furthermore, it is not ruled out 
that a special appeal to the Security Council will be made so 
that the body will take an official position on the issue. 
  According to the estimate of diplomatic circles, following 
the collapse of the talks on the confidence-building measures 
there will be no action on the Cyprus issue until the Security 
Council decides on the next move and after UN Secretary General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali submits his report with the relevant 
suggestions. The report is expected to be submitted in three 
weeks and will be based on the report of Joe Clark's [UN 
secretary general's special representative on Cyprus] report to 
the secretary general after his fruitless deliberations with the 
Turkish side. 
  The estimates are that the Turks--Ankara and [Turkish 
Cypriot 
Leader Rauf] Denktas--have recently intensified their 
intransigent stance. [passage omitted] 
  In the meantime, both Britain and Germany have openly 
criticized the Turkish stance on the Cyprus issue and have let 
it be known that the new impasse could lead to the process for 
Cyprus' accession in the European Union to be accelerated. 
  In Nicosia there is information that the German presidency 
of 
the European Union [which will take over from Greece on 1 July 
1994] has given assurances that it will promote Cyprus' 
application for membership in the European Union.

  [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis said the best thing for 
our side in order to open the way for a correct solution to the 
Cyprus issue is Cyprus' swift accession to the European Union. 
He said that this would force Turkey to think seriously. 
  In a statement today while making Easter visits to military 
camps, Kliridhis said that the UN Security Council is now 
concerned. He added that any talks, either on the substantive 
issues or confidence-building measures, will not bear fruit 
because the Turkish side has no political will. Kliridhis said: 
The Security Council must seriously consider alternative ways 
to resolve the Cyprus issue. The president mentioned that for 
the first time it is understood that there is no political will 
for a solution to the Cyprus issue. He told reporters: If you 
ask me about the possible developments, I would say that we 
still have a long way to go. Asked about his Easter wish, 
Kliridhis said: I wish that next year we will be celebrating a 
free Cyprus along with the resurrection. 
  In a statement at ELDYK [Greek Forces of Cyprus] military 
camp, Kliridhis said that Cypriot Hellenism is not the only 
thing undergoing trials in Cyprus; the Greek nation is being 
tried as well. He thanked the officers and soldiers of their 
forces who have come here to fight for the freedom of Cypriot 
Hellenism. He also expressed the Cypriot people's love for 
Greece, stressing that Greece is above any personal 
considerations.

  [Text] Rauf Denktas, president of the Turkish Republic of 
Northern Cyprus, has said that the Turkish Cypriot Government 
and Assembly must reassess the Cyprus policy together with 
Turkey. 
  Addressing a visiting delegation from the Turkish Cypriot 
Fighters Association, Denktas said that the failure to reach an 
agreement on the confidence-building measures [CBM's] shows that 
as long as it is recognized as the legitimate government of 
Cyprus, the Greek Cypriot Administration will not sign an 
agreement with the Turkish Cypriots. 
  Denktas said that it was wrong for UN special envoy Clark to 
have declared the collapse of the talks on the CBM's while in 
the Turkish Cypriot sector. Denktas recalled that the Turkish 
Cypriots conveyed their proposals on four main issues to the 
Greek Cypriots, but the latter rejected them. Denktas said: 
The announcement about the collapse of the talks should have 
been made in the Greek Cypriot sector.

  [Excerpt] Ozker Ozgur, state minister and deputy prime 
minister, has declared that both the people in the south and in 
the north will suffer if the Cyprus problem is not solved. 
Addressing the 35th Congress of the Turkish Cypriot Engineers 
and Architects Chambers Union, Ozgur described the Cyprus 
problem as a curse for the whole of Cyprus and said that we must 
be rid of it. 
  Pointing out that he regards the UN umbrella as the only 
alternative, Ozgur remarked, however, that the United Nations 
does have its weak points, which must be criticized. He said: 
But, we do not have another alternative. Notwithstanding its 
good and bad points, the United Nations is the only organization 
that can attempt to protect peace. This is the reality and we 
must be aware of it. 
  Ozgur also noted that it is wrong to continuously display 
the 
attitude that the world does not understand us and that the 
world has been deceived. If the world fails to understand us, 
then we must seek the reasons for this, Ozgur stated, adding: 
We must be coolheaded, well-intentioned, and constructive if we 
are to explain our problems to the world. 
  Recounting that the talks concerning the confidence-building 
measures followed a positive course until the last day and the 
Turkish Cypriot side displayed a flexible and constructive 
approach, Ozgur announced that the talks broke off when Joe 
Clark, the UN secretary general's special representative in 
Cyprus, insisted on discussing how the Greek Cypriots will 
access Maras [Varosha] from the south of Magosa [Famagusta]. 
Ozgur expressed the belief that the wrong method can be 
rectified and the talks could resume. He said that his party 
joined the coalition on the basis of the principle that efforts 
should be exerted to achieve a federal solution within the 
framework of the 1977 and 1979 summit agreements, rather than on 
the basis of the argument that a nonsolution is also a solution. 
The government is conducting its work within this framework, 
Ozgur added. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou returned satisfied 
from his trip to the United States. In a statement shortly 
before leaving New York for Athens, Papandreou said that his 
trip had specific goals that have been partially achieved. He 
added that some issues will be evaluated later. 
  Asked whether his expectations from the visit were 
fulfilled, 
Papandreou said: I cannot say that the flow of history has 
changed. In any case, we managed to make our positions 
understood and interlocutors were responsive. 
  Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias described as completely 
unfounded rumors that he had met with Stevo Crvenkovski, his 
counterpart from Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM], adding that he is ready to return to New 
York if talks on Skopje require it.

  [Text] To allow the Greek and Albanian foreign ministers to 
meet, the Greek Government has asked the Albanian side to 
adequately explain why last night it banned the procession for 
Christ's burial in Tirana and other Greek minority areas. The 
meeting was canceled at Greece's initiative after the Albanian 
authorities refused to allow Christians to carry out their 
religious obligations. Greece also stipulated as a condition 
for the meeting that the Albanian Government allows resurrection 
celebrations. 
  Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said today in 
Thessaloniki that the meeting would be meaningless if Albania 
does not respect international law, the Greek minority's human 
rights, and a just state. The spokesman said: The foreign 
ministers' meeting depends on the Albanian side. Yesterday, we 
had an aggravation by the Albanian authorities: The banning of 
the procession for the Orthodox Easter Mass. We will see 
whether this will remain in effect until tonight. It is a 
terrible insult to the freedom of religion and human rights. We 
definitely want Greek-Albanian relations to improve, but this 
depends on respect for international law. Greek-Albanian 
relations cannot improve without these conditions and the 
foreign ministers' meeting would be meaningless. 
  Asked about the government's reaction to criticism of a 
passive stance to the Albanian provocations, Venizelos said: 
The Greek Government's stance is one of continuing vigilance 
and diplomatic demarches. I believe the entire international 
community respects this stance and has confronted Albania's 
[words indistinct] campaign in the past two weeks. 
  Commenting on a statement made by Political Spring Chairman 
Andonios Samaras that this situation would not have happened if 
a Greek parliamentary delegation had gone to Albania, the 
spokesman said: I would ask Political Spring and Samaras to 
consider past responsibility for the situation of the Greek 
minority in Albania. 
  Albanian President Sali Berisha verbally decided to allow 
the 
Mass to be held outdoors in the Greek Orthodox churches in 
Albania. According to diplomatic circles in Tirana, Berisha's 
decision was conveyed to Archbishop Anastasios of Tirana and all 
Albania last night, immediately after the conclusion of Mass at 
Evangelismos Cathedral. The decision was expected to be 
submitted in writing within the day. 
  Greek [words indistinct] circles in Albania said they 
believe 
Berisha's decision may contribute to improving the atmosphere 
between Greece and Albania and holding the meeting of the two 
foreign ministers scheduled for 3 May in Zurich. 
  The Greek Government decided to cancel the meeting of the 
two 
ministers after the Albanian Government banned the procession 
for the Easter Mass. Thousands of Orthodox people in Tirana 
were informed about the banning when they arrived at the 
churches. In a resolution to Albanian President Berisha, the 
Greek Orthodox people asked him to intervene personally and 
restore the unjustified limitation of their freedom of religion. 
  Churches in Gjirokaster held their Mass normally. They also 
held a procession for Christ's burial without any interference 
from the Albanian authorities.

    [Editorial Report] 
<H5>  Simitis Concerned About Minority Views </H5>
  An article in the 3 April Athens weekly TO VIMA TIS KIRIAKIS 
reports on Minister of Industry Kostas Simitis's concern over 
behind-the-scenes activities occurring within the Panhellenic 
Socialist Movement (PASOK) in light of the party's 14-17 April 
congress. The article cites a number of sources as saying that 
Simitis has often observed to aides that "a certain apparatus" 
exists at the core of the party that attempts to exclude those 
party officials who disagree with the views of the majority. 
The article also cites Simitis' belief that the disappearance 
of internal party minority views entails "tremendous political 
dangers" and that, if this is not resolved at the congress, 
PASOK will become "ideologically poorer" and face the June 
European Parliament elections "with its wings clipped." Simitis' 
concern is that the party not become a "mere manager for 
government decisions." 
<H5>  Yiorgos Papandreou on Succession </H5>
  The Athens daily TA NEA published on 5 April an interview by 
Notis Papadhopoulos with Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs 
Yiorgos Papandreou. In the course of the interview, 
Papadhopoulos asked the deputy minister whether his rumored 
close relationship with Minister of Defense Yerasimos Arsenis 
would influence him after Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's 
tenure. The deputy minister replied that while Arsenis is a 
long-time personal friend, it is too soon to speak of a future 
PASOK leadership, especially in view of the name he bears. 
Papandreou added that he sees his role in PASOK as substantial 
and that he will devote himself to party unity. 
<H5>  PASOK Membership Profile </H5>
  In the days leading up to the PASOK congress, an article in 
the 4 April TA NEA provided a profile of the party membership. 
Of 194,755 party members, 11.83 percent are between the ages of 
18 and 24, 15.22 percent between 25 and 34, 26 percent between 
35 and 44, 23 percent between 45 and 54, 15.3 percent between 55 
and 64, 7 percent between 65 and 74, and 1.58 percent are over 
75. Some 84.6 percent are men and 15.4 percent are women. Some 
34.15 percent have an elementary education, 47.51 percent have 
finished high school, 6.8 percent have a graduate education, and 
11.51 percent have a postgraduate education.

  [Text] It has been announced that the public is well aware 
of and appreciates the fact that the Turkish Armed Forces are 
not the authority or organ for establishing governments. 
  A statement to Anatolia Agency by the General Staff Press 
and 
Public Relations Department recalled that today certain 
newspapers carried false reports regarding political quests and 
new structures based on assumptions that do not correspond with 
the actual task of the Armed Forces. Pointing out that the 
public is well aware of the fact that the Armed Forces are not 
the authority or organ for establishing governments, as 
suggested by these reports, the statement remarked that the 
terms in office of the chief of staff and the force commanders 
are determined in line with the need for service within the 
framework of the law. The statement also asked the public not 
to heed any concocted reports other than announcements made by 
authorized bodies.

<F P=106> [Second of an unspecified number of installments of an </F>
"abridgment" of an interview with Workers Party of Kurdistan, 
PKK, leader Abdullah Ocalan by Ertugrul Kurkcu, Ragip Duran, and 
Behcet Avsar in Barr Ilyas Lebanon on 21 March] 
  [Text] [Reporter] In your cease-fire proposal there is the 
following important message to the Turkish public: "We do not 
insist on the division of Turkey." By this, do you mean to say 
that the real representatives of the Kurdish and Turkish peoples 
should come together and initiate a new process of democratic 
reconstruction? 
  [Ocalan] Of course. Contrary to public perception, I am not 
engaging in "maneuvers." I do not think it is suitable to 
consider Kurdish independence in the form of separation from 
Turkey, even if we forge a military capability capable of doing 
so. This is certainly not my ideal solution. We want to 
discuss this issue with those sectors that really want to think 
about and understand Turkey and solve her problems. That is, we 
do not believe that the Kurdish problem can be solved without 
Turkey, or that Turkey can advance without solving the Kurdish 
problem, or surmounting some of these problems. I can clearly 
demonstrate this. Even the present intensity of the war has 
halted Turkey's progress. Everything is tied to the war effort. 
Even they themselves have been saying so for the last two 
years. This trend will escalate, thereby undermining the 
internal balances in Turkey, and it will push the country into a 
major crisis and wreck it. Hence, those who really love Turkey 
and are concerned about it should come forward now. 
  I know well the mentality of the special warfare forces. 
This mentality has been evident not only today, but during all 
the previous Kurdish uprisings. The mentality is: "Suppress 
the Kurds, massacre and hang some of them, and force the rest to 
surrender. That is how the problem will be solved." The method 
of repression is evident: "This job can then be completed by 
starting a process of assimilation." This has been the official 
thesis for the last 70 years. We are now proving the futility 
of this thesis. One cannot ensure Turkey's territorial 
integrity this way. The Kurdish principalities had considerably 
greater autonomy even under the Ottoman Empire. They were even 
in power for a long period. Compared to the Turkish Republic's 
oppression and assimilation system, the Ottoman tolerance was a 
splendid blessing. There was no Ottoman pressure on the Kurdish 
language and culture. The republic ushered in a policy of 
suppressing and eroding identity! A policy of destroying a 
centuries old culture. It tells the Kurds: "Stop being 
yourselves." This is a heavy punishment, a frightening 
humiliation! The effects of the official ban on language, on 
people's minds and psychology must be understood. 
  And, here I am not even talking about economic, social, and 
political conditions. Already, even the slightest political 
stirring is punishable by execution! One must realize what 
effect all this will have on the people. There should be some 
progress beyond this republic's theory of national unity and 
integrity. All right, you Turks managed to deport the 
Armenians. It was a solution for you. The Kurds face an even 
worse situation than the Armenians, but you are unable to deport 
them. Why are you unable to deport the Kurds? Because there 
are various [Kurdish] clans and there are the mountains. The 
situation is a bit different. The suppression and genocide of 
the Armenians cannot be effectively applied in the case of the 
Kurds. It has now been realized that the genocide of our 
identity will lead nowhere and Turkey will face bottlenecks 
henceforth. Can Turkey achieve a turning point at this stage? 
Can the state's official ideology and policy chart a new 
course? These are their own problems. But, these last few 
governments have persistently tried to press ahead with the 
policy of the last 70 years, and at least for some time to come. 
[Former president Turgut] Ozal tried to end this policy but 
died under mysterious circumstances. As for us, we have to 
issue a call to our banner. Being the bearers of Turkey's 
70-year old policy, this government, or a possible national 
front government, will want to continue with this policy. They 
will say: "Let us continue the war for yet another year." At 
this point, let me also say the following: We have made 
preparations to continue the war for yet another year. Look at 
our strength in 1993; and if it means anything to you, our 
strength in 1994 will be at least quadruple that! At present 
our armed forces number around 20,000. If we wish to, we can 
increase it to 30,000 at any time! Supposing that each 
guerrilla is equivalent to 10 soldiers; then, if we lose 30,000 
people they will lose 300,000! It is not difficult to arrive at 
this figure, judging by last year's casualty figures. 
  [Reporter] But, those in Turkey who think that there can be 
no talk of any solution before the "PKK [Workers Party of 
Kurdistan] is completely eradicated" are still very influential. 
To what extent does such an approach obstruct a possible 
solution? 
  [Ocalan] To persist with this mentality means the 
destruction 
of Turkey. Could they ever venture to inflict so much 
destruction on Turkey? Undoubtedly, some would. People like 
[leader of Nationalist Movement Party, NMP, Alparslan] Turkes 
are saying "we can destroy the PKK." His companions might 
venture to try such a thing. But let me state that we will not 
remain silent if they do try it. If they launch a massive 
massacre, we will definitely defend ourselves! We too could 
speak in the language that Turkes understands. He has 
frequently massacred leftists and committed big massacres. Now, 
he is forming a special army. We know that the special army is 
being organized by his men. They are all members of the NMP. 
We will form a special army in response! We will raid their 
homes! We will raid their villages! If they escalate the 
conflict, we will do the same! We will move against these 
fascist leaders if the Turkish people do not break with them. 
We will move against them because we do not consider them to be 
a part of the Turkish people, but fascists. We will not harm a 
hair of any Turk who does not side with the fascists. Such an 
escalation of the conflict is not our choice. But the opposing 
side might want to escalate the conflict. The counterguerrilla 
faction and Turkes' supporters within the state belong to the 
group that wants to escalate the conflict. They want to 
escalate the war to eradicate the PKK and the Kurdish people. 
They showed this inclination in their recent behavior in 
parliament. We will try to stop this trend and we will succeed! 
It is time for us to listen to the voice of reason. 
  [Reporter] What does the "voice of reason" say? 
  [Ocalan] Let us remove the shadow of force from 
Kurdish-Turkish relations; we are ready for any solution. I 
assure you of this. I am saying: Renounce the use of force and 
let us rearrange things according to the free democratic choice 
of the peoples, firmly within the existing borders! I am not 
evading this; rather I am stating it openly. I guarantee this, 
if you have the power to bring about such a solution! I ask: 
Where is the separatism in this? They repeatedly claim that 
"the PKK will divide and dismember the country." The public 
should not be taken in by such claims. We believe that the 
improvement in relations will generate enormous riches, that 
democracy will uplift the peoples, and that it will also be an 
enormous gain for Turkey if the Kurdish people develop their 
culture, it will enrich our lives and uplift every individual! 
This is what I want! Is it a sign of magnanimity to utterly 
degrade the opposite side? By way of example, would you be able 
to enjoy the friendship of your spouse if you beat her every 
day, maimed her, and even cut out her tongue? 
  [Reporter] A provision in the decisions adopted at the 
Brussels conference calls on you to inform the Swiss Government 
that you will abide by the Geneva Convention. Are you thinking 
of complying with this call even if there is an intensification 
of the conflict? 
  [Ocalan] We expressed our desire to abide by this convention 
a long time ago. But, Turkey rejected it by refusing to 
recognize us as a counterpart. Anyway, Turkey does not 
recognize us as a belligerent party. There is a de facto war. 
They also know this, but they deny its de jure existence. Of 
course, we would like to abide by the Geneva Convention. Let me 
state that we will abide by the war conventions word by word. 
But, the other side has a counterguerrilla organization, and 
there are many unsolved murders. Is there a war convention that 
contains provisions about unsolved murders? Theirs is a dirty 
war, unrivaled even by the wars of the Middle Ages! In those 
times they had their own methods of fighting, but nothing like 
this existed. Theirs is a dirty, filthy war. We want to abide 
by the war conventions. But they are not abiding by them. 
  [Reporter] Speaking realistically, do you expect the 
official 
circles to respond to your call for a cease-fire by this spring 
or summer? The General Staff regards these months as 
advantageous for this. 
  [Ocalan] We entertain no such cheap illusions. But making 
such a proposal at the beginning of spring was important from 
the point of view of our going on record as one of the 
belligerents in the conflict. 
  A feeling of responsibility is also important. We want peace 
and a democratic solution. We hope this problem will be solved 
without bloodshed. This is an expression of goodwill. Will the 
Turkish General Staff take it seriously? This is a General 
Staff that thinks it is above everything. It sees itself as 
more powerful than the Ottoman sultans. But, it has to start 
thinking about the heavy cost of this war, about who would gain 
or lose during the spring and summer months. Supposedly they 
were going to finish us during the heavy winter conditions. 
Check out carefully who really faced difficulty during the 
winter. The guerrillas might gain great advantage in the coming 
months. In the meantime, we are improving our combat methods. 
  They have already launched the spring offensive. There is an 
operation around Gabar Mountain. According to our observations, 
some 12,000 to 13,000 troops and village guards took part in it. 
They lost at least 80 troops killed and 150 injured, and then 
withdrew, leaving behind a considerable amount of military 
hardware on the battlefield. This is despite the fact that 
Gabar Mountain is close to where the army has been massed. This 
is how their major spring offensive is faring. They are now 
attacking Mount Ararat. According to wireless reports from 
Ararat, more than 40 troops were killed on 19 and 20 March. 
They suffered twice as many wounded. We lost only two 
guerrillas. We lost four guerrillas on Gabar Mountain. This is 
an indication as to who will achieve better results in spring. 
I know how well trained our forces are. We have never been so 
sure of ourselves. 
  [Reporter] Aside from Ararat and Gabar, how do you view the 
general situation in the region? 
  [Ocalan] Lately, area meetings have been held and a 
restructuring of forces was carried out. Take Botan [region 
covering Semdinli, Baskale, Hakkari, Uludere, Cukurca, Sirnak, 
Cizre, and Catak], where we will attempt to establish a federal 
government. At present our influence there is greater than that 
of the state, our weight is greater there. We will spread the 
area of this influence. We will also establish local 
governments in other provinces, and it is highly likely that we 
will run these governments. We already have nearly a 10,000-man 
guerrilla force in Botan. This is a very powerful force. Some 
60 to 70 percent of the territory there is under our control. 
It could be stated that despite strong attacks, the army is 
unable to enter it, whereas we are enlarging our own army there. 
They want to subjugate Serhat [region covering Kars, Agri, 
Erzurum, and Van], but they are unable to go higher than the 
foothills of Mount Ararat. In Dersim they are unable to venture 
out of the city. They also tried to penetrate the 
Diyarbakir-Bingol-Mus triangle, but could not even prevent the 
guerrillas from consolidating there. They also could not evict 
the guerrillas from Kozluk, Sason, Mutki, Tatvan, and Hizan -- 
these regions form the Garzan line. There are guerrilla cells 
on Taurus, and in an area extending from Malatya to Binbogalar 
to Adiyaman. No matter how many plans of destruction the 
General Staff draws up, they will not be very effective. It 
will only lead to bloodshed; the spring and summer of 1994 will 
be violent. We might also suffer losses during this period, but 
the Army will lose at least 10,000 men. We really do not want 
this degree of butchery of the troops. 
  [Reporter] This would mean a major crisis for Turkey? 
  [Ocalan] Definitely, and the already paralyzed economy will 
reach the point of complete collapse. Probably only then will 
some people really start to think about a solution. I think at 
that point this government will leave--should leave--the scene. 
Those pro-special warfare people who are shaping this 
government's policy will be called to account. Maybe only then 
might the democratic alternative be placed on the agenda. 
  [Reporter] Could the opposite happen? Could Turkey attack 
the region in a manner similar to the Serbian attack on Bosnia? 
  [Ocalan] They are already walking along that path. 
  [Reporter] But, this is being concealed from the public? 
  [Ocalan] You are correct when you say that this is being 
hidden behind the screen of the Serbian massacres committed in 
Bosnia. The attacks on the Kurds in Kurdistan is worse than the 
Serbian attacks on Bosnia! The Turkish public does not know 
this because the special warfare forces have extraordinary 
control over the press. Turkey's emulation of the Serbian 
attacks will become obvious once the Bosnian issue moves toward 
a solution. 
  [Reporter] Will we too have Milosevics? 
  [Ocalan] What Milosevic? There will be worse and more 
extremists ones. Let me remind you, the General Staff has some 
plans of repression. We believe that the final stage of the 
plan envisages the complete destruction of villages and the 
massacre of everyone having any link with us. This plan is now 
in force. They might escalate the implementation of this plan. 
They have already destroyed more than 1,000 villages. Only, a 
few thousand more villages remain. They will also destroy them. 
Because of the destruction of the villages, cities, primarily 
Diyarbakir, have grown in population. Writing in the THE TIMES 
[not further specified], an American said: "The situation in 
Diyarbakir reminded me of America's fate in Vietnam." They have 
interesting observations. The situation here is similar to 
Saigon when the fortunes of the war turned against America. He 
is saying: "I have now seen both Saigon and Diyarbakir." 
  They brought the war to this stage. You know what the 
situation is like in Diyarbakir. It is ready to explode. They 
emptied the villages and now a single huge village has cropped 
up. What are they going to do with that big village? Where are 
they going to send the people from there? They expanded 
Istanbul and gave it a peasant character. Istanbul will vanish 
with further peasantation. Is this a solution? It will backfire 
if they transport so many Kurds to Istanbul. Already this 
policy has Kurdified Cukurova, and the Aegean is fast becoming 
Kurdified.

  [Text] Unal Erkan, state of emergency region governor, has 
announced that 500 terrorists were killed in operations 
conducted by security forces in the region and across the border 
in the past 20 days. 
  In statements issued in the Savur District and Kabala 
subdistrict of Mardin, Erkan reported that 500 weapons, eight 
antiaircraft guns, 10 mortars, 74 rocket launchers, and numerous 
rounds of ammunition were seized during the operations. 
Explaining that the terrorists are attacking defenseless 
citizens, Erkan stated that 70 citizens were killed by 
terrorists in the past month. 
  Erkan stressed that the state is determined to completely 
neutralize the terrorists this year. Pointing out that the 
terrorist organization is in the process of collapsing, the 
regional governor remarked that this is leading to internal 
quarrels and executions. Erkan asked the citizens to be careful 
with regard to terrorist incidents and to assist the state even 
more.

  [Text] Ankara, April 30 (AA) -- Foreign Minister Hikmet 
Cetin on Saturday [30 April] said that Turkmen natural gas will 
soon be available in Turkey. 
  Speaking to reporters upon his arrival at Ankara's Esenboga 
Airport after concluding official talks in Turkmenistan and 
Uzbekistan, Cetin said his contacts there have been useful. 
  He said during his meeting with Turkmenistan President 
Saparmurad Niyazov, the importance and necessity for Turkmen 
natural gas transfer to Europe via Turkey was once again 
confirmed, expressing hope that its use in Turkey would start in 
1996. 
  Cetin said Turkey will continue to provide support for these 
countries with whom it shares historical, cultural, religious 
and language ties, adding the necessary political will for 
strengthening bilateral relations and cooperation is present. 
  He said foreign trade volume with Turkmenistan is of 161 
million dollars, while it reached 145 million with Uzbekistan, 
and during his visit agreement was reached for increasing it 
even further, adding there is necessary potential for this. 
  Cetin said the Turkish private sector is working in these 
countries in the fields of infrastructure, construction, 
industry and service, expressing hope that greater investments 
will be made in these countries.

  [Text] Ankara, April 30 (AA) -- Foreign Minister Hikmet 
Cetin on Saturday [30 April] said that in frame of previous 
agreements, Turkey will join in oil exploration projects in 
Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. 
  He told reporters upon his arrival at Ankara's Esenboga 
Airport following a visit to these countries that the Turkish 
Petroleum Company (TPAO) will be participating in the project, 
adding Turkmenistan is at the moment producing 5.5 million 
tonnes of oil yearly. 
  Answering reporters' questions, Cetin expressed belief in 
the 
advantage on the continuation of talks process for finding a 
solution to the Cyprus problem. 
  On the embargo imposed to Iraq, he said that Iraq is 
complying by the embargo rules, adding the United Nations 
Security Council also is expecting this country to take positive 
steps on the issue of Kuwait's independence and territorial 
borders. 
  On Bosnia-Herzegovina, he underlined the importance of 
bringing to a stop Serbian offensive, stressing that this would 
not necessarily mean that the conflict has been solved. 
  "What matters is the independence and sovereignty of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. If a real cease-fire is reached, such a 
process can start." He said. 
  Cetin also expressed belief that a continuation of UN-NATO 
cooperation is vital to at least set up safe areas where 
necessary.

<F P=106> [Article by Harald Stanghelle] </F>
  [Text] The Progress Party [FrP] drops the most in support 
while the Center Party, the Christian People's Party, and the 
Conservatives gain the most according to Opinion's party 
barometer for April. 
  The April poll is based on 1,005 interviews conducted from 
Monday [11 April] to Wednesday of this week. Of those 
interviewed, 71.5 percent declared their party preference. 
  The FrP, which is holding its national congress this 
weekend, 
drops the most. The party lost 1.3 percent support. At 4.3 
percent it is now 2 percent below the very low election result 
last September. 
  The FrP has experienced great fluctuations since its start 
together with the Anders Lange Party in 1973. Chairman Carl I. 
Hagen's party has now endured a long period of difficulty 
holding on to its voters. The trend has for a long time been one 
of low loyalty to the party. By now the level is 
catastrophically low: 51.3 percent. 
  This means that only one-half of the voters who say they 
voted for the FrP last year continue to support the party. In 
comparison, the Center Party enjoys a loyalty of 81.8 percent, 
the Labor Party 78.9 percent, and even a party with such big 
problems as the Conservative Party has a loyalty percentage of 
69.7. 
  The Conservatives are advancing in the April poll. A likely 
explanation could be the national congress held last weekend. 
At that time the party finally got its new leadership installed 
so that it can now concentrate on its political message. The 
background data show that the Conservative Party is now 
mobilizing supporters who chose to stay home during the 1993 
national election. This is a positive sign for the party. With 
a gain of 0.9 percent, the party's current support of 18.3 
percent puts it notably above last year's poor election results. 
  The Center Party also gets 18.3 percent support in April, an 
advance of 1.5 percent since the March poll. The party has an 
enormously high loyalty level (81.8 percent). The prospects for 
the party are definitely positive. The Center Party is getting 
voters both from the Socialist Left and the Christian People's 
parties. It appears to be perceived as the leading party on the 
no side [of the EU issue]. 
  With gains of 1.4 percent, the Christian People's Party is 
definitely advancing, following several months of losing 
support. The April support of 7.5 percent places the party 
almost at the level of support in last year's election. 
  The Socialist Left drops slightly, but rising loyalty may 
mean that the leakage from the Socialist Left to the Labor Party 
is about to stop. The Labor Party also drops only a little (0.6 
percent), but it is interesting to note that in most polls taken 
in the past months the governing party has been dropping. The 
background data reveal heightened insecurity and increased voter 
leakage to other parties. Future polls will tell us more about 
whether or not this is connected to the EU issue.

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] Russia and Latvia have now agreed on 
the conditions for the withdrawal of the Russian troops from 
Latvia. The presidents of the two countries will meet in Moscow 
tomorrow to sign the agreement. [passage omitted] [Begin 
recording] [Correspondent Goeran Skaansberg] The Swedish 
Government has offered 16 million Swedish crowns to Latvia 
toward dismantling the Skrunda radar station and the cost of 
Russian pensioners moving back to Russia. Prime Minister Carl 
Bildt, why did Sweden make this offer right now? 
  [Bildt] To make it easier for Latvia and to make possible an 
agreement that means the withdrawal of the last Russian troops 
from Latvia. In part, it is aid to start the dismantling of the 
modern part of the big radar station in Skrunda as soon as 
possible, and in part it is aid to the supplementary protocol on 
which I hope there will be agreement in Moscow tomorrow, whereby 
we can give some support to Russian retired officers who want to 
move back to Russia from Latvia. 
  [Skaansberg] There has been [word indistinct] in this 
connection, many Latvians are opposed to this agreement exactly 
because it gives the retired Russian officers the possibility of 
remaining in Latvia. Do you believe this money will make it 
easier to get them to move back to Russia? 
  [Bildt] I believe one should look at this agreement very 
much 
like a social question. I can understand the feelings that 
exist both on the Russian and the Latvian side in this matter, 
but this is a matter of taking into account each individual. 
What we want to do here is to create maybe slightly better 
conditions for those who would like to move--Russian officers 
and pensioners-- to move from Latvia to their original homeland. 
That will now be slightly easier and I believe this can be a 
benefit. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] This was Prime Minister Carl Bildt on Swedish 
aid 
to Latvia and the reporter was Goeran Skaansberg.

  [Text] Test flights with JAS-39 Gripen [fighter aircraft] 
have once again been stopped. According to Saab Military 
Aircraft, the testing of a future version of the steering system 
has not given the results they expected. The tests have been 
carried out on a simulator. No flights with the test aircraft 
will be made until it has been ensured that deviations in the 
steering system do not affect flight safety. Those JAS aircraft 
which have been series-built and which will be delivered to the 
air force have another version of the steering system.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "European Union: Italy Told To </F>
Respect Steel Commitments"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Brussels, April 27 -- The European Commission 
has warned Italy that it must respect commitments made to 
restructure its steel sector, in exchange for a European Union 
green light on state aid to Ilva, or face new sanctions. 
  The veiled threat was contained in the report the European 
Union executive presented here today on the state of 
restructuring plans by European public steel concerns, approved 
by the European Industry Council last December. 
  The warning was also aimed, sources at the European 
Commission said, at Germany and its plan for Ekostahl, and 
Spain's plan for CIS. 
  Karel van Miert, the European Commissioner responsible for 
competition, on Wednesday [27 April] stressed the need to have 
"all information necessary, from interested countries, to verify 
progress made in the restructuring plans for which state aid has 
been authorized. The overall credibility of the plans, in fact, 
will depend on the respect of these conditions." Van Miert went 
on to say that not all countries in question have offered the 
full data requested in the time required. 
  This question was already raised by the European Commission 
last week, during the Industry Council in Luxembourg, at which 
time Italian Foreign Trade Minister Paolo Baratta promised to 
promptly forward lacking data from IRI [Institute for Italian 
Reconstruction] on the application of the Ilva plan. He also 
reiterated Italy's determination to respect the commitments made 
last December on the time-table and methods to restructure the 
country's public steel sector. 
  Nations in the process of restructuring their public steel 
companies were to have forwarded to the European Commission, by 
March 15, data on the reduction of production capacity, 
investments, job cuts, market conditions, financial results and 
on privatization drives. 
  The plan the European Union approved for Ilva foresaw the 
closure in Taranto, by the end of June, of two blast furnaces, 
for a production cut of 1.2 million tons, and a further 500 ton 
cut through the sale of ILP. The plan also called for the total 
dismantling of the Bagnoli plant, outside Naples, while the 
sales if ILP and AST must take place before the end of the 
current year.

Neutral Partners of NATO"] 
  [Excerpt] Brussels, 29 Apr (ATS) -- Sweden and Finland will 
sign the framework agreement on the Partnership for Peace on 9 
May, NATO sources have announced today. They will be the first 
two neutral countries to do so. 
  Switzerland also is interested in the offer made by NATO 
last 
January to all CSCE members for cooperation. However, the 
Federal Council probably will wait until the results of the 
referendum on the blue helmets are released before it makes its 
intentions known. Indeed, the peacekeeping operations fall 
within the scope of activities under the Partnership program.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Kohl Never Wanted To Attend Normandy </F>
Landings Ceremony"] 
  [Text] In London on Wednesday [27 April], Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl reiterated that he has never tried to get himself 
invited to the ceremonies marking D-Day, the day of the Allied 
landings in Normandy. "I would never go, even if I were 
invited," he said following British-German consultations with 
Prime Minister John Major at Chequers, the British prime 
minister's country seat. But Kohl left no doubt as to the fact 
that he would attend next year's VE-Day celebrations, the 50th 
anniversary of the end of the war. He said he would be there to 
pay his respects to the World War II dead. Needless to say, the 
British side claims that preparations for the VE-Day 
celebrations have not started yet. Following domestic squabbles 
about the D-Day celebrations, Major must make sure he reaches 
agreement with the war veterans associations in his country. 
  Apart from this, the German-British consultations, which 
were 
also attended by several ministers, took place in unusual 
harmony. Major reported that at no time had there been any 
disagreement. According to both Kohl and Major, the only open 
question, that of choosing a successor to European Union [EU] 
Commission Chairman Jacques Delors, had not been settled. In 
any case, it became clear during fringe talks that the Germans 
would not support the candidacy of the British favorite, Sir 
Leon Brittan. But Kohl claimed that the German Government has 
not yet made up its mind about this. 
  The heads of government reported at length on the subject of 
the future expansion of the EU. According to London, once 
Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway have become members, many 
years will pass before further members can be considered. "It 
is quite clear," said the Chancellor, "that there will be a long 
pause following the ratification of the new membership 
applications." Hungary and Poland are among the potential 
applicants for EU membership. The path to a further opening of 
the EU should be paved during Germany's presidency of the EU, 
which begins on 1 July and will last six months. 
  The two government heads agreed to suggest to Hungary the 
holding of a trilateral military exercise in peace protection in 
1995, as part of the Partnership for Peace. "We will invite the 
NATO command to take full part in the planning of this exercise, 
and at the same time we hope to create the prerequisites for 
other interested parties to take part as well," said a joint 
statement. Apart from this, the government heads promised their 
full support for the American-Russian-Ukrainian agreement and 
expressed their concern for the successful conclusion of the 
effort to help Ukraine destroy its nuclear weapons. "We will 
exchange information and experiences from our respective aid 
programs to make a maximum contribution to the collective 
objective of security and partnerlike relations in the entire 
region," it was said. For this purpose, the two men want to 
share their experience they have already gained, especially 
concerning the German retraining and accommodation construction 
programs for Ukrainian military personnel. 
  The situation in Bosnia also figured prominently in the 
talks. The chancellor said he could see a "light at the end of 
the tunnel in former Yugoslavia." On the other hand, other 
crises are possible, he said. "Nobody should think that the 
evil spirits we have seen in the Balkans have already been 
exorcized," said Kohl.

  [Excerpts] Silvio Berlusconi has been entrusted with the 
task of forming a new government in Italy. [passage omitted] 
The French Government hopes that close cooperation will 
continue with the Italian Government. Foreign Minister Alain 
Juppe said that it will be necessary to judge on actual evidence: 
  [Begin Juppe recording] Since the birth of the EC, Italy has 
been one of the most fervent players in the construction of the 
Community. I hope it will still be the same. This government 
has just been formed; we do not know its projects. We must 
judge on actual evidence. What is said during an election 
campaign does not always allow one to pass a precise judgement 
on what a government will do after the elections. I think that 
we should wait and see what will happen in the next few weeks 
and months. I really hope that we shall continue to work 
closely with Italy and that what is the very foundation of the 
construction of Europe -- a community of values and the same 
ideas about democracy and the rule of law -- will continue to 
exist in Europe. This is the foundation of European identity 
and of the construction of the European Union. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with European Affairs Minister Alain Lamassoure </F>
by Anne Fulda; place and date not given: "Lamassoure: `The 
Maastricht Battle Is Over'"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Fulda] Your opponents think 
that the arrival of new competitors on the world market [as a 
result of the recent GATT agreement] will threaten entire 
sections of French industry. 
  [Lamassoure] The real situation is different. With average 
customs duties of 6 percent, the European market was already 
largely open. Now the others have agreed to open up and bow to 
the rules of international trade. Take the example of South 
Korea. It is a country with a population four times that of 
Greece and with the same standard of living. South Korea, which 
had customs duties of 50 percent, has agreed to reduce them by 
40 percent! And it has just bought the TGV [high-speed train] 
from us. Our companies have benefited greatly from the European 
Common Market because two-thirds of our exports are now to the 
European Union [EU], as against only 5 percent to the Asian 
countries. However, in the next 10 years, half of world growth 
will be in this region of the world. It is here that the new 
markets are to be won, and hence new sources of jobs for France. 
  [Fulda] Is that not likely to result in job losses in 
France? 
  [Lamassoure] Some jobs will disappear, but many more will be 
created. We must decide whether, like the Germans, the 
Italians, the Americans, and the others, we accept progress, or 
whether our objective is to make France a new Albania. At all 
events, increases in productivity and the emergence of new 
products are inevitable. In 1985, our exports represented 5 
percent of world trade; in 1994, we are nearing 7 percent, an 
absolute record for 50 years! We have absolutely nothing to 
fear from world economic competition provided it is carried out 
in conditions which guarantee fair competition. 
  [Fulda] With regard to your second objective -- the 
restoration of peace on the European continent -- are you 
satisfied? 
  [Lamassoure] With regard to the restoration of peace, two 
important things have been started. First, the division of 
roles between Europe and the United States with regard to the 
security of the continent has been revised to take account of 
the new sources of instability which have emerged on our 
continent. 
  Second, the beginnings of a common EU foreign policy have 
been established. Of course, these are only the beginnings, but 
Europe now exists as a diplomatic player. In the Yugoslav 
crisis, for the past year, it is at the initiative of France and 
Europe that all the Security Council resolutions have been 
adopted, and it is the EU's peace plan which is now the only 
undisputed basis for an overall settlement to the quagmire in 
the former Yugoslavia. 
  Another example: At Edouard Balladur's initiative, the EU 
has decided to organize a conference on stability covering the 
whole of the European continent. It is an exercise in 
preventive diplomacy aimed at urging the European countries 
which have problems with good neighborly relations to sit down 
at a table, either bilaterally or in a regional framework, with 
European mediation. [passage omitted] 
  [Fulda] To what extent will the government be involved in 
the 
European election campaign? What will your role as European 
affairs minister be? 
  [Lamassoure] It is primarily the majority's union list, 
i.e., 
that of Valery Giscard d'Estaing's [UDF--French Democratic 
Union] and Jacques Chirac's [RPR -- Rally for the Republic] 
parties, which will lead the campaign. It is therefore for these 
parties to decide on the campaign. In this respect, the 
government, which supports the list headed by Dominique Baudis, 
welcomes the threefold agreement reached by the UDF and RPR: 
agreement on the program; agreement to sit in the same group in 
Brussels; and agreement on a single union list headed by 
Dominique Baudis. 
  As far as I am concerned, I intend to play an educational 
role throughout this campaign, to explain the real choices 
facing us. For instance, today, it is no longer a question of 
whether or not we must open up our trade borders -- this has 
been an established fact for 30 years -- but of examining how we 
can open up other countries' borders with a view to creating new 
jobs in France. I will try to show where the real issues lie. 
  [Fulda] What do you think of Philippe de Villiers list, 
which 
is being presented as the majority's "other list?" 
  [Lamassoure] The Maastricht battle is over. The radically 
new problem is whether, and how, a political Europe of 24 states 
can be made to work. Dare we hope that this campaign will be 
something other than a purely domestic debate in which attempts 
would be made to settle scores within each political family on a 
European pretext?

<F P=106> [Report by Barbara Palombelli: "`Here Come the Experts...' </F>
-- But They Are Already Being Challenged by the League and the 
Democratic Party of the Left"] 
  [Excerpts] Rome -- Yesterday Silvio Berlusconi confirmed 
the plan to entrust three "wise men" with the task of studying 
the guarantees that have been insistently requested from him by 
allies and opposition alike. "Our legal system," the newly 
appointed prime minister explained, "already includes an 
antitrust law, which instituted the role of a guarantor of 
competition and the market, invested with the power to guarantee 
and control, as well as the power to sanction in order to 
protect the market and free competition. Also currently in 
force is Law 223 of 1990, which instituted the role of a 
guarantor for broadcasting and publishing, with specific powers 
to guarantee, control, and sanction in the press, television, 
and advertising sectors." [passage omitted] 
  Reactions from the parties were icy. For Achille Occhetto 
[secretary of the Democratic Party of the Left, PDS], 
"Berlusconi's appointment is giving rise to deep concern. 
Fininvest's owner is bringing together, in his own person, 
political power, enormous economic power, and, above all, power 
over the media -- something which is unprecedented in history 
and has no parallel in other countries." 
  The PDS secretary added that his party would advocate "a 
clear-cut, unequivocal, full separation between the prime 
minister's role and the ownership of the media. With the 
privatization of the major banks, three or four families will 
have a hold on the economy, and given that Mediobanca and 
Fininvest's interests are interlinked, with a view to 
rationalizing Fininvest, it will be difficult for the government 
to take any action against [Mediobanca Chairman] Cuccia. 
However, we believe that this is necessary in order to 
effectively deregulate the Italian market." 
  Senator Ferdinando Imposimato found the guarantors' 
appointment "absurd: It is inconceivable that the controllers 
should be appointed by the person controlled." League floor 
leader Francesco Speroni said "PSI [Italian Socialist Party] 
European deputy La Pergola's appointment is very strange," while 
[League Secretary] Umberto Bossi remarked: "He has not given 
any guarantees, he could not give them. We lack the appropriate 
laws for this. If today we have someone like Berlusconi, the 
reason is that we did not have a serious antitrust law. 
However, he will have to do something about it before all 
reservations are put aside. The best guarantees for us consist 
of obtaining the right ministries for the League."

<F P=106> [Report by Petros Evthimiou] </F>
  [Text] A major shake-up of the cabinet in the immediate 
future is unlikely, according to sources close to Prime Minister 
Andreas Papandreou, who added that the prime minister's 
intention was merely to fill two vacant posts--one at the 
National Economy Ministry, left empty by the death of Yeoryios 
Yennimatas on Monday [25 April], and a second at the Interior 
Ministry following the expected reelection of the current 
minister, Akis Tsokhatzopoulos, as the ruling party's secretary. 
  The sources said a broader reshuffle would not likely take 
place until after the European Parliament elections in mid-June 
and Greece hands over the rotating, six-month European Union 
presidency to Germany. A reshuffle would be aimed at boosting 
some aspects of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement's [PASOK] 
policies which, while not considered failures, have not 
proceeded at the requisite pace for PASOK's broad reform 
programme. 
  But other analysts say new amendments to the party's charter 
adopted at this month's PASOK congress which stipulate which 
nine Executive Committee members may and which nine may not 
simultaneously hold cabinet posts, could precipitate a reshuffle 
before the June elections. They add that while this could in 
some respects hamper the final month of the Greek EU presidency 
it could on the other hand accelerate implementation of the 
government's programmes.

  [Excerpts] Motherland Party [ANAP] leader Mesut Yilmaz 
charged that the country's problem is political, not economic, 
and the solution should be a political one. In a statement 
after meeting with ANAP mayors in Istanbul today, Yilmaz said 
that the current difficulties in the country stem from a lack of 
confidence in the government. 
  Asked to comment on Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's statement 
that no one should engage in efforts to seek a new government, 
Yilmaz said: 
  [Begin recording] It is natural that she should speak like 
that, but everyone knows that we did not initiate the quest for 
a new government. This quest comes from all sectors of society. 
We only announced that we are ready to do our task on this 
matter. Such a quest is an indication of a consensus that the 
present government is not the solution to our problems. [end 
recording] 
  Yilmaz declared that the search for a confidence-inspiring 
and broad-based government will continue despite the prime 
minister's appeal to the contrary. Even if a broad-based 
government cannot be established, Yilmaz noted, a minority 
government is a possibility if a general consensus is reached. 
[passage omitted] 
  In a news conference in Ankara today, Fikri Saglar, 
secretary 
general of the Social Democratic Populist Party, noted the 
recent search for a transition government and said that his 
party is categorically opposed to this. Saglar remarked that 
his party will not support any nondemocratic solution. Pointing 
out that certain circles launched this quest the moment they 
realized that their interests were undermined, Saglar said that 
those who are looking for a government of technocrats or a 
transition government are actually yearning for dark periods and 
want to attain the dark monies of those dark periods.

  [Text] Esat Kiratlioglu, deputy leader of the True Path 
Party [TPP], remarked that there is a search for a civilian 
revolution and a transition regime in Turkey, adding that his 
party will never allow this. 
  In a news conference in Ankara today, Kiratlioglu charged 
that Motherland Party leader Mesut Yilmaz launched efforts to 
create a transition regime in order to resolve the difficulties 
within his party arising from the fact that the party was 
defeated in the local elections. Noting that Yilmaz is 
suggesting new government models within parliament, Kiratlioglu 
said that these proposals are reminiscent of antidemocratic 
governments established in the wake of 12 March [1971]. These 
proposals are being raised for the so-called reason that the 
parliament should do something before solutions are imposed on 
it by others, Kiratlioglu explained, adding: Mr. Yilmaz is now 
a civilian revolutionary and is leading a civilian revolution. 
  Claiming that Yilmaz wants to remain as his party's leader 
by 
creating a political crisis in the country, Kiratlioglu said 
that earlier Yilmaz also prepared the grounds for the current 
banking crisis by announcing that dollar accounts will be 
confiscated. Kiratlioglu declared that the plans to weaken the 
TPP will not succeed, the coalition government is standing 
upright, and democracy will certainly be victorious.

<F P=106> [Thomas Michelsen report: "Warning Shots From Wibble"] </F>
  [Text] The Swedes are now to be frightened into joining the 
EU [European Union]. Finance Minister Anne Wibble paints the 
picture of a black economic future for Sweden if we do not 
become members. Outside the EU we will be threatened by mass 
unemployment or low wages and low environmental standards. 
  Wibble was speaking at the launch of a translation of an EU 
white book on the economy yesterday. 
  "If we do not become members we will not attract any 
investment," Finance Minister Anne Wibble (Liberal Party) said. 
What arguments can Sweden use to attract investment if we are 
not members of the EU? 
  "Why should companies invest in Sweden if Sweden is not part 
of the core market?" Wibble asked. If Sweden cannot offer a 
stable relationship with Europe investors will choose to invest 
in other countries. 
  In such a situation Sweden would then have to try to compete 
using the tool of low wages and low taxes or perhaps lower 
environmental standards, the finance minister said. If we are 
outside we have a simple choice between lowering our standards 
or accepting mass unemployment. 
  If things look black for Sweden outside the EU, the white 
book does not paint a bright picture of the situation inside the 
EU. Over the last 20 years unemployment has been rising the 
whole time, with a brief exception in the eighties. At the same 
time, in all important economic respects the EU's 
competitiveness has worsened in comparison with the United 
States and Japan. 
  The reason why the EU has produced its white book on the 
economy is unemployment. Today 17 million are unemployed. This 
is 11 percent of the EU's active population. And before the end 
of the year unemployment could rise to 18 million, the EU's 
ambassador to Sweden, Jaime Cavanillas y Junquera, said at the 
launch of the Swedish translation of the white book. 
  Anne Wibble said that in the past the EU has not made 
sufficient effort to combat unemployment. But now unemployment 
is top of the EU agenda -- and this is a good thing. 
  The white book is a thorough review of various possible ways 
of strengthening the economy, growth, and employment. What is 
especially important is that it dismisses the notion that 
technological progress is a cause of unemployment, Wibble said. 
  It also dismisses the notion that job-sharing is a way of 
resolving the crisis. Rationing jobs to make them go further 
among more people is no solution, the EU notes in its white book. 
  In the United States there has been growth in employment. 
But many of the new jobs are so badly paid that people cannot 
live on them. In Europe growth has been less, but the jobs that 
have been created are better paid. We do not want to be forced 
to choose between the American and the continental European 
experiences, Wibble said.

  [Text] Vienna, May 2 KYODO -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) has renewed its demand that North Korea 
allow it to conduct full inspections at the time of refueling at 
an experimental reactor in Yongbyon, an IAEA spokesman said 
Monday [2 May]. The spokesman said the Vienna-based nuclear 
watchdog body made the demand in a letter sent to North Korea on 
Sunday. 
  The IAEA wants to send an inspection team to North Korea to 
oversee the refueling which involves the replacement of fuel 
rods at the 5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon, 90 kilometers north 
of Pyongyang. The Yongbyon complex has been the focus of 
allegations that North Korea is pursuing a clandestine nuclear 
weapons program. 
  North Korea on April 29 offered to allow IAEA inspectors to 
be present at the unloading of spent fuel rods from the reactor, 
but said it would not permit the IAEA to measure radioactivity 
levels or take samples. 
  The IAEA later indicated that North Korea's terms were 
unacceptable. North Korea had indicated it would like to 
conduct the refueling as early as late April. The latest IAEA 
message to North Korea indicates that the Agency has not budged 
from the insistence that it wants full inspections of the 
facility and that it will consider a failure to allow this as an 
infringement of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. 
  U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry said in Seoul on April 
21 that North Korea will be able to acquire enough plutonium 
"within weeks" to make four to five nuclear bombs with the fuel 
rod change at the reactor.

<F P=106> [Interview with Egon Klepsch, president of the European </F>
Parliament, by Helmut Weixler; place and date not given: "More 
Than 280 Votes in Favor"] 
  [Text] [Weixler] Mr. President, next Wednesday [4 May] 
the European Parliament [EP] will take the historic vote on 
enlarging the European Union [EU] with Austria and three 
Scandinavian states. The vote might be a very narrow one. Some 
people doubt that enough of the 518 deputies will come to 
Strasbourg. 
  [Klepsch] I think this is a fairy tale. So far, there have 
been far more deputies present in each plenary week than are 
necessary for such a vote. I do not see why this should be 
different this week, unless there are deputies who are present 
but do not want to participate in the vote for political reasons 
and intend to block the accession of these countries in this way. 
  [Weixler] It is assumed that the southern countries, in 
particular, might express their displeasure about enlargement. 
  [Klepsch] I do not get this impression from the southern 
countries to such an extent. I think that it is rather 
colleagues from the Netherlands, France, and Belgium who think 
that the concessions, which the Council has so far made 
concerning the deepening of the EU are insufficient. 
  [Weixler] Will their abstention endanger a favorable vote? 
  [Klepsch] A total of 259 votes in favor must be achieved. 
If someone does not want to vote in favor, he can do three 
things: be present and vote against, be present and abstain 
from voting, or not participate in the vote at all. 
  [Weixler] Perhaps the vote will not be taken at all. Some 
members of the Parliament, such as the Greens, want to postpone 
the vote. The Institutional Committee of the EP has also 
applied to assign the vote to the next parliament. 
  [Klepsch] The parliamentary groups have decided to hold the 
vote on 4 May. However, standing orders permit bringing a 
motion at any time to suspend or postpone a vote. We have 
agreed to have this done shortly before the final vote. 
  [Weixler] This means tension until Wednesday at 1700. If 
the vote is taken, it does not mean that agreement on 
enlargement is ensured. 
  [Klepsch] There were some conditions that the Parliament 
wanted to have clarified before the vote, and this clarification 
has largely taken place. The first condition was that the 
entire text of the treaty must be available in all the languages 
of the EU in time -- that is, by mid-April at the latest -- so 
that that committees have the opportunity to examine it in 
detail. 
  [Weixler] Some deputies are very annoyed that the text of 
the treaty was pushed through in two weeks. 
  [Klepsch] This may be, but the Council did keep its word. 
The second question is the assessment of the compromise 
achieved in Ioannina on the future blocking minority and the 
qualified majority. There I must say that in Ioannina the 
foreign ministers actually decided to set down what was desired 
by the Parliament. There is only one ambiguity on one point, 
namely that there may be certain delays concerning votes in the 
Council. However, this is a normal practice of the Council, one 
that we already have at the moment. 
  [Weixler] Has the Ioannina compromise been sufficiently 
clarified to make the members of the Parliament agree? 
  [Klepsch] There are certainly some who do not think that 
this has been sufficiently clarified, but I personally think 
that it is all right. The third question was the preparation of 
the revision conference in 1996, at which the great reform of 
the EU institutions is to be started. In this connection, it 
was set down in Ioannina that the Parliament is to be involved. 
The detailed conditions still have to be negotiated. 
  [Weixler] The French do not seem to be particularly happy 
about the increasing superiority of Germany in the EU. In 
connection with Austria, there is still the specter of the 
"German bloc" haunting the discussions. Do these fears also 
play a role for the French behavior at the vote? 
  [Klepsch] I do not believe so. Because, luckily, our 
Parliament has been divided along political lines and not along 
nations; otherwise it would never have worked. And the central 
problem in voting is always to which line one belongs and not to 
which nationality. A greater difficulty seems to be that some 
smaller nations are examining very carefully to what extent the 
key positions that they have had so far will be weakened by 
enlargement. 
  [Weixler] Some countries are grumbling that the would-be 
members were granted too many concessions at the negotiations. 
Did the EU permit itself to be overpowered by the would-be 
members? 
  [Klepsch] I think that the result of the negotiations was 
balanced and that it is approved of by the great majority of the 
Parliament. 
  [Weixler] What result do you expect of the vote? 
  [Klepsch] A sufficient one. 
  [Weixler] A little more specific, please: 259 in favor, or 
280, or how many? 
  [Klepsch] More than 280. 
  [Weixler] If we theoretically supposed that the vote ended 
in a "no," what would happen then? 
  [Klepsch] Then the whole matter would have to be sent back 
and new negotiations might have to take place. 
  [Weixler] But that would delay membership by years. 
  [Klepsch] Not necessarily by years, but it would certainly 
mean a delay. One must see that we already have a delay now, 
because the negotiators on both sides, the Council and the 
would-be members, did not stick to the original date of 31 
December 1993. Thus we are now five months late. 
  [Weixler] Does the fact that they will find valuable allies 
in the new member countries in some fields promote enthusiasm 
for enlargement on the part of European members of parliament? 
  [Klepsch] We proceed form this premise. I also believe that 
the new member countries will strengthen transparency and 
democracy. All the would-be member countries have a stable 
democratic structure, a stable economic development, and are 
good models of liberal rule-of-law states. This will strengthen 
the central structure of the EU. 
  [Weixler] Since the Maastricht Treaty the Parliament has 
more power than ever, but it seems that the European people 
still think of it as a debating club, which basically has 
nothing to say. How do you want to change this image? 
  [Klepsch] This image is completely unjustified. I do not 
know any parliament that works more than the European 
Parliament. For instance, the Parliament is not to be blamed 
because the association treaties with Poland and Hungary took 
more than two years to be ratified. We ratified them 
immediately, but the national parliaments took their time. By 
the way, the same might also happen with the ratification of the 
membership treaties. 
  [Weixler] This might also take two years? 
  [Klepsch] I hope not, but that depends on the national 
parliaments.

<F P=106> [Report by Winfried Muenster: "Brussels Remains on Guard"] </F>
  [Text] The European Commission has predicted a real 
economic growth of 1.25 percent this year and a 2.1 percent 
growth in 1995 in the European Union [EU], thereby adhering to 
its restrained forecast made in late autumn, even though most EU 
countries have declared that their economies are happily 
improving again. But the economic development observers in 
Brussels are not so sure about this, and claim that what little 
improvement occurs will have little bearing on the labor market. 
Unemployment in the EU will almost certainly rise from its 
current 11 percent to 11.25 percent next year, before it 
"generally falls again." 
  The optimistic forecasts come from Germany because German 
exports have unexpectedly improved. But the European Commission 
does not see such an improvement in the rest of the EU. "The 
economy," says the European Commission in its annual economic 
report," could develop more unfavorably than expected if 
investor confidence decreases." The continuing restrictive 
monetary policy in most member countries, the absence of 
competitiveness in third markets, and the "continuing low degree 
of confidence on the part of consumers" are still preventing 
economic growth, say the people in Brussels. They hasten to add 
that a "faster decrease in credit interest rates might be 
required" in order to improve the economic climate. However, 
this is already happening to a pleasing degree. Long-term 
interest rates gradually fell from an average of 11 percent in 
1990, their high point, to 6.5 percent in January, and have 
fallen even further since. Therefore, on an EU average, they 
are lower than in the United States. 
  The economic development researchers in Brussels place 
particular emphasis on competitiveness on world markets, saying 
that "this has remained relatively weak in relation to costs and 
other determinants," so that exporters are "not always in a 
position to profit from the consolidation of world-wide economic 
activity." The EU reports a trade deficit of the equivalent of 
137 billion German marks [DM] in 1992 (the 1993 figures are not 
available yet), compared to DM62 billion in 1989, the final 
almost complete year before the turnabout in the East. 
Therefore, the EU deficit is higher than that of the United 
States. 
  The European Commission considers the domestic budgets of 
the 
EU member countries to be one of the factors restricting 
economic growth. Instead of backing up the still shaky economic 
improvement by means of a stable policy, virtually all the EU 
member countries are compelled to resort to consolidation 
programs because the budget deficit is increasing almost in 
every EU country. Whatever the case, the EU will remain the 
weakest economic area at least until next year. In 1995, the 
men in Brussels predict a real growth of 2.6 percent in the 
United States, a 2.8 percent growth in Japan, a 2.9 percent 
growth in European Free Trade Association, and a mere 3.1 
percent growth on a world level.

<F P=106> [Report by Conrad Seidl: "EU Opponents More Determined Than </F>
in the Past"] 
  [Text] Linz -- The opponents of membership in the European 
Union [EU] are now more determined in their negative attitude 
than in December. This was discovered by Market Institute 
expert Astrid Koller when she compared two polls about the date 
of accession to the European Union. 
  The Market Institute has repeatedly conducted polls for the 
European Barometer of DER STANDARD, asking when the most 
appropriate date for accession to the EU would be. In the M-35 
poll last December only one out of two EU opponents said that 
Austria should "not at all" join the European Union -- in the 
M-39 poll now, after the negotiations, already two-thirds of the 
EU opponents are committed to a definite "no." 
  "A classical case of polarization," Koller says. The other 
results make it clear that 46 percent of the population are 
still of the opinion that Austria should join the EU in 1995 at 
the latest. 
  A potential postponement of the referendum and of the date 
for accession is favored by about 15 percent of the followers of 
the Social Democratic Party of Austria and the Austrian People's 
Party [OeVP] respectively. The "never into the EU" is advocated 
by 28 percent of Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe] followers and 
21 percent of OeVP followers. 
  The Liberal Forum, which is close to the FPOe but in favor 
of 
the EU, warned last week against making the EU referendum a 
referendum on the government; Bruno Kreisky made this mistake in 
1978. The bill will be presented to the government only at the 
Nationalrat elections. 
  This week the issue of the EU and the date of accession will 
be dealt with by the parliaments, by the European Parliament in 
Strasbourg and by the Nationalrat. Austria will not have the 
opportunity to join the European Union at any time, Salzburg 
Governor Hans Katschthaler stated. If membership is rejected 
now, he expects a delay of 10 to 15 years.

<F P=106> [Boris Johnson article: "Should We Stay, Should We Go?"] </F>
  [Text] At last, the taboo is over. The gloves are off. 
The wonder of it is that the question was not asked earlier. 
Let us cut ourselves off, voices are saying within the 
Government, and have done with it. The European Community was 
founded in 1957, at the height of the Cold War. Its core 
policy, agricultural subsidy, was devised at a time when hunger 
was not unknown in Europe. The Cold War is over. Free trade is 
now enshrined in the GATT treaty. Agricultural surpluses tower 
to heaven. Why not get out? 
  There should be no embarrassment now in questioning the 
point 
of the whole European construction. Indeed, British Euro 
sceptics might have attracted wider sympathy during the 
Maastricht debate if they had drawn the logical conclusion of 
their own arguments. 
  The Foreign Office was yesterday active with the sand 
bucket, 
fighting the spread of speculation. "Complete rubbish," it said. 
But it was clear last night that the extraordinary words imputed 
to John Major -- "I'll pull out of Europe" -- emanate from a 
clique which has the support of some senior members of the 
Government and a widening section of the parliamentary party. 
  They are casting their eyes ahead to the 1996 negotiations, 
which could begin as early as this autumn; and their objective 
is to bounce Mr Major into an extreme position. They wish him 
to fight federalism with a threat: that any further incursions 
upon national sovereignty would cause Britain to uproot the tent 
pegs in Brussels and depart. 
  As a serious proposition, from serious members of the 
establishment, it has no precedent since the referendum of 1975. 
  After so many humiliations, the mood in Westminster is 
lightheaded, nihilistic. Exasperated by detail, befuddled by 
its defeats, parts of the Government, or at least the Tory 
party, are prepared to debate the question of Europe from first 
principles. 
  They are right to do so. The mere threat of withdrawal would 
change the way the Government is viewed, both abroad and at 
home. Too often, other countries have been able to drive Britain 
into a corner because they know, or have hitherto assumed, that 
Britain would never be so anarchic, so mad, as to deploy the 
doomsday weapon. The threat could serve the Government well, 
moreover, in the Euro election campaigns. Both Labour and 
Liberal Democrats have left themselves badly exposed on the Euro 
sceptical flank. 
  But if such a threat is to carry weight for long, there must 
be a serious intention behind it. Could it ever be in Britain's 
interests to depart? I know of only one reason for staying in 
the Common Market. It is, however, quite a good one: If Britain 
extricated herself from the pact she joined in 1973, the balance 
of probability is that the remaining 11 would not disintegrate. 
  The Eurocrats would reel. The recriminations would be 
shrill. But the organisation would not explode. The EC 
Commission would continue to promulgate screeds of legislation. 
These would cease to be directly applicable to Britain. But 
the writ of Brussels would run through an ever wider dominion, 
as first the Scandinavians and then the East Europeans joined. 
With more than half our exports going to the Community, British 
firms would have no choice but to conform with the standards, 
weights, sizes, dimensions determined by the continentals. The 
only difference would be that, out side, Britain would have no 
way of influencing those standards to its advantage. Excluded 
from the corridors of power, Britain would be unable to 
safeguard her interests. 
  That is a good reason for staying in the EC. But as the 
debate gathers way, as it seems likely to do, we will hear 
plenty of bad reasons, not least from the Government. Some will 
say we are now so intimately bound in that we could not 
physically excise ourselves, that the union was now beyond 
surgery. 
  In reality, withdrawal presents few practical difficulties. 
Parliament would simply have to abrogate the Treaty of Rome, as 
amended by the Single European Act and Maastricht. British MEPs 
[Members of the European Parliament] would easily find 
employment as "consultants" in Strasbourg or Brussels and 
British ministers would no longer have to fly in for 
interminable meetings in the Charlemagne building. Britain 
would not even need to disengage its diplomatic representation 
to Brussels, the 40 or so diplomats. Most of them would stay, 
though as observers rather than negotiators. 
  Euro-enthusiasts of an old fashioned cast of mind, such as 
Sir Edward Heath, might lament the offence caused to our 
"partners" in Europe. On the other hand they perhaps exaggerate 
the need to be polite to foreigners. They are not especially 
polite to us. 
  Some, especially the Labour party, will feel we have to stay 
on the inside if we wish to share in the defences of a giant 
trading bloc, able to project its will in the face of Japan and 
America, and the challenge of cut price labour from the Third 
World. In fact, the opposite is true. If there is a commercial 
reason for Britain staying in, it is to prevent such a fortress 
Europe from being created. 
  Britain's farmers and John Gummer, former Agriculture 
minister, are likely to say that departure would damage our 
agricultural interests; and it is true that we have become 
junkies of the Common Agricultural Policy as much as any other 
EC country. Pump-primed by Brussels subsidies, British exports 
of agricultural products rose by 7 percent per year during the 
early 1980's. But the cost has been absurdly high, in food 
prices and in the tax burden. 
  Local councils might protest that they would be cut off from 
all those Brussels hand-outs from the regional and social funds. 
It is true that the 12-star emblem would vanish from the signs 
on inner-city developments and bypasses in Scotland. But we 
could fund our own roads, schools and hospitals ourselves and 
plough back, moreover, the billions that we contribute to the EC 
budget. 
  The worst reason of all for remaining inside is the 
widespread assumption that Brussels, "Europe," would save us 
from ourselves. It is a common middle-class sentiment that 
Government, or Mr Major, is so lacking in direction that some 
kind of Euro-government could scarcely be worse. On the 
contrary, one could argue that is the EC's very tentacles which 
undermine confidence in British institutions. 
  My own hunch is that pulling out of Europe might, at least 
in 
the first few years, cause an immense feeling of national 
renewal. It would be intoxicating to cast off the incubus of 
Brussels. It would end the wearisome arguments about 
sovereignty, the confusion about who governs Britain. It would 
be like winning the World Cup, or the wave of national unity at 
the beginning of the Second World War. 
  But I think it would not last, for the one big reason I have 
mentioned. British businessmen would face discrimination. 
Investors in Britain would be deterred. As long as the Community 
exists, we are better off making trouble from the inside. In 
any case, the question is unlikely to present itself in those 
terms. 
  In 1996, the issue will not be in or out. With so many new 
countries presenting themselves for membership, it will be the 
end of the old all-or-nothing EC compact. For the first time, 
Britain will be able to choose from a menu of options. Some may 
want tighter integration. Others may be able to content 
themselves with little more than free trade. It is at that 
point that battle will be joined in earnest between Europhiles 
and Eurosceptics.

<F P=106> [Philip Johnston report: "`There Is No Alternative' Hurd </F>
Tells Euro Rebels"] 
  [Text] Mr Douglas Hurd, the Foreign Secretary, told 
Conservative Euro-sceptics questioning Britain's membership of 
the EC yesterday that they were "out of touch with reality." 
  In an attempt to dampen speculation that Mr Major would 
threaten to withdraw from the Community if further encroachments 
were made on national sovereignty, Mr Hurd said there was no 
alternative to continued participation. 
  "We are part of Europe, and I am quite clear that our 
prosperity and security depends on making a success of Europe," 
he said. "Therefore we have to argue strongly, as we have done 
and will do, for the kind of Europe with which we are at ease." 
  But Mr Edward Leigh, who was sacked as Industry Minister, 
claimed that as many as 200 Tory MPs "do not want to be dragged 
further and further into a federalist system." 
  Mr Hurd's comments came at the end of a week in which Tory 
tensions over Europe have reasserted themselves as battle-lines 
are drawn ahead of the 1996 inter-governmental conference that 
will chart the development of the EC into the next century. 
  Sensitivities are such that ministers swiftly denied there 
had been any fundamental redrafting of the party's manifesto for 
the forthcoming European elections, though it was conceded its 
rough edges had been smoothed and some sections dropped. 
  The Prime Minister, on a regional tour of the north west of 
England, said the manifesto had gone through the normal 
redrafting process and was now virtually complete. Suggestions 
that the original drawn up by Mr Hurd had been rewritten by 
Downing Street were "over dramatised and fanciful," Mr Major 
said. 
  The manifesto attempts to bridge the gulf between the 
party's 
two extremes on Europe and Mr Hurd believes he has produced a 
document that will satisfy about 90 percent of MPs. 
  He wants the party to campaign on avowedly European issues 
in 
order to highlight the differences between a Conservative 
commitment to a loose alliance of nation states and alleged 
Labour and Liberal Democrat support for bureaucracy, regulation 
and interventionism. 
  A comprehensive policy statement on Europe is included in 
the 
annual Campaign Guide published by the Conservatives last night. 
It emphasises that the Tories are committed to keeping Britain 
"at the heart of Europe" and to playing a "pragmatic 
constructive and above all practical" role in the EC. 
  But Euro-sceptics, who now term themselves "realists," fear 
that if a stand is not taken now, then Britain will be dragged 
along in the federalist slipstream leading to a united states of 
Europe and a common currency. 
  With some on the Tory Right now openly canvassing the option 
of withdrawal, both Mr Major and Mr Hurd made clear yesterday 
that this was not a strategy they would embrace. 
  The Prime Minister said it was in Britain's economic and 
security interests to remain part of the EC although that did 
not mean that every edict from Brussels or opinion of a European 
partner had to be accepted. 
  The Foreign Secretary speaking in Devon, said "Our message 
is 
positive in that we see no alternative to Europe." 
  Mr Michael Heseltine, the President of the Board of Trade, 
also rounded on the Euro-sceptics for reopening the divisions 
ahead of the June 9 elections. 
  "It is undermining the position of the Prime Minister, of 
our 
candidates and making our supporters in the country reel with 
amazement," he said. 
  The rekindling of the Conservtiave Euro arguments has 
provided the opposition parties will ample ammunition in the 
run-up to the June 9 elections, at which the Tories face heavy 
losses, although largely because of domestic unpopularity.

<F P=106> [Report by Paul Goodman and Dean Godson: "Is It Possible </F>
for Britain to Pull Out of Europe?"] 
  [Text] A Britain restored to its former glory, once again 
master of its destiny and the workshop of the world. Or, an 
introverted little island, buffeted amidst its North Sea setting 
by the chill waves of economlc isolatlon. 
  Two very different visions of Britain's future outside the 
EC. Which would prove more accurate? Before the question can be 
answered, a further one poses itself: How possible would it be 
for Britain to leave the EC? Slipping anchor and sailing away 
from standardised condoms, bans on British bangers and Jacques 
Delors is not easy as it sounds. Never mind Maastricht, the 
real problem is the 1972 European Communities Act. It was this 
that confirmed Britain as a member of what is now the EC. To 
this day, academics tear each other's beards out over what it 
implies. It set out the terms under which Britain joined the 
Community, however, it said nothing about how Britain could 
leave. 
  Simple, say some. No Parliament can bind its successor. So 
a future Parliament could simply repeal the 1972 Act. Not so, 
answer others. As the terms under which Britain joined the EC 
acknowleged the supremacy of Community law -- it supersedes that 
of member states -- we cannot leave, since there is no lawful 
means. 
  Greenland, of course, got out in 1984. But Greenland, a 
former Danish colony, is rather an unusual case. Antony 
Bradley, a former professor of constitutional law, sees a 
potential goldmine for m'learned friends. 
  "Unless withdrawal could be by agreement, Central European 
institutions and member states might have claims for 
compensation under international law," he said. However, he 
adds that, were terms for withdrawal to be agreed with the rest 
of the EC, Parliament could probably get away with it. 
  What then? Doom, disaster, and everything short of a plague 
of locusts, according to Europhiles. "Disastrous...suicide," 
said Sir David Knox, the Europhile Tory MP. "Those who want to 
leave are living in a fantasy world; 60 percent of our exports 
now go to the EC. If we left, we'd have no say in setting the 
rules." 
  Figures, as vague as they are alarming, support this view: 
2.5 million jobs are at risk, employers have warned. Last 
week, Howard Davies, the Director General of the CBI 
[Confederation of British Industry], reiterated that the 
organisation is "committed to making a success of Britain's 
membership." Farmers seem to agree. "The single market 
provides important opportunities for British farmers," said Paul 
Reiderman of the National Farmers' Union. 
  Bunkum, say Euro-sceptics. "The outcome would be 
astonishingly positive," said Teddy Taylor, the outspoken 
Euro-sceptic. "Exports to the EC have risen less fast than 
imports: the deficit since 1973 has been 1 billion pounds. 
Then there is the saving from quitting the Common Agricultural 
Policy -- 32 pounds a week per family. And what about the costs 
to Britain of EC decisions, like the 350 pounds million payment 
to former local and health authority workers?" 
  He also questions the assumption that leaving the EC would 
ignite a trade war. "You don't have to be an EC member to be 
part of the single market -- look at the EFTA states like 
Sweden." 
  The benefits of withdrawal roll on. VAT [value-added tax] 
would be slashed were our 2.3 billion pound EC contribution to 
cease. The City, as an offshore financial centre, would be 
largely unaffected -- and could even prosper. Since we trade 
more outside the EC than any other member state save Denmark, 
Euro-sceptics foresee Britain's tranformation into a vibrant 
independent nation -- "Europe's Singapore." 
  It is all, perhaps, a bit too good to be true. Britain could 
survive outside the EC, but it would not be plain sailing. "The 
City would hardly suffer at all," said Tim Congdon, of Lombard 
Street Associates, "but it is possible that trade barriers could 
rise in the event of Britain departing." Back to Paul 
Reiderman: "The voice of British agriculture is stronger as a 
result of being part of a European trading block than it would 
be otherwise. How much weight would we carry on our own in 
GATT?" 
  Here is the rub. National prosperity drives the debate about 
EC membership, but the reasons for preserving or junking it 
touch upon even more than hard cash. They concern political 
fundamentals: power, seats round the table, our place in the 
world. More importantly, they ask what Britain is, and what sort 
of people we are. 
  If Britain remains an EC member, it is not hard to forecast 
the consequences. Europe's economic fortunes will continue to 
decline, leading to more EC-led intervention and protectionism 
here; the role of our institutions -- the Monarchy, Parliament, 
the Church of England -- will increasingly be called into 
question. 
  The alternative is shrouded in mist. Some transitional 
unemployment, certainly, the transfer of civil servants from 
Brussels to China, Taiwan, and South Korea, the untwinning of 
British towns with their continental counterparts maybe; perhaps 
a revival of national morale, at least for a while. 
  Whatever the outcome, it seems certain that the economic 
cart 
will carry on driving the political horse. And, significantly, 
disillusion with the EC is spreading throughout British business. 
  Dr Anne Robinson, of the Institute of Directors, emphasises 
that it has no view on EC withdrawal. Nonetheless, "the 
overwhelming view of our members is that the single market 
hasn't delivered." And if it can't deliver? "Then people are 
going to get very fed-up with Europe, aren't they?"

<F P=106> [Report by David Wastell and Toby Helm: "Fowler Aims To </F>
Curb Tory In-Fighting"] 
  [Text] Right-Wing Cabinet ministers are pressing John 
Major to prepare a blueprint for reform of the European 
Community, with which Britain can "go on the attack" in the next 
round of talks on the EC's future. 
  Their move came as senior Tories urged MPs and European 
election candidates to concentrate their fire on opposition 
policies, amid growing concern that party infighting over the EC 
is harming its local and European election campaigns. 
  Sir Norman Fowler, the Tory party chairman, said yesterday: 
"What the party should do is get on to the attack against the 
Labour Party and the Liberal Party, and set out the fundamental 
differences and the gap between our view of of Europe and their 
view of Europe." 
  Senior Tories are furious at the way "fanciful" reports 
claiming Mr Major was contemplating withdrawing from the 
European Community have dominated the final stages of the 
campaign for Thursday's local elections, and threaten to 
overshadow the forthcoming launch of the party's European 
electlon campaign. 
  But there was fresh confusion last night over the Tory 
Euro-manifesto, which is being revised at Mr Major's insistence. 
On Friday Mr Major said it would be published "in a few 
days'time." 
  Yesterday, however, senior party sources said it would not 
be 
released until the third week of May. 
  Ministers on the party's Right say they are less concerned 
with the detail of the manifesto than with the Government's 
long-term plan to ensure that Britain's agenda wins the day in 
the 1996 inter-governmental conference, which will hammer out 
the successor to the Maastricht Treaty. 
  They want the Government to draw up detailed proposals -- 
including plans to reduce the EC's power and a new system of 
voting within the European Council -- to be published well in 
advance of the conference. 
  The Right will also seek Conservative manifesto commitments 
for the next general election to keep Britain out of a single 
currency, and to use the veto to block any further moves towards 
a more federal EC constitution. 
  A radical plan to curb the powers of the Commission will be 
published this week by the European Policy Forum [EPF], an 
independent think-tank with influence in the Foreign Office and 
Downing Street. The EPF proposes breaking the European 
Commission's grip on policy by splitting it into three separate 
bodies with responsibility for overseeing the single market, 
financial programmes and international trade. 
  Euro-sceptic Tory MPs are furious with Douglas Hurd, the 
Foreign Secretary, who on Friday accused them of being "out of 
touch with reality." One prominent Tory backbencher said 
yesterday: "It is not the Euro-sceptics who are out of touch 
but Douglas Hurd. He is not only out of touch but out of 
credibility. If his constant refrain that Europe is coming our 
way is the sick joke of the decade."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Code Name `Bozorg Allawi'"] </F>
  [Text] The Federal Government obviously has more 
information about the murder of four Kurdish opposition members 
on 17 September 1992 in the Berlin restaurant Mykonos than has 
been assumed. This is indicated in a secret report dated 29 
June 1993 by Working Group Iran of the Federal Office for the 
Protection of the Constitution. According to this report, the 
attack was prepared by the Iranian intelligence service in Bonn 
and carried out under the code name "Bozorg Allawi." According 
to the report, the largest of the three Iranian intelligence 
services acting in Germany, the Ministry of Information and 
Security (MOIS), has its headquarters for West Europe at the 
Iranian Embassy in Bonn. The MOIS department has existed since 
the turn of the year 1986/87, says the report. It is housed on 
a specially secured floor of the embassy and has a radio room 
and a staff of at least 20. According to information obtained 
by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, the 
intelligence service headquarters is also involved in the 
illegal transfer of military technology and is particularly 
interested in "NBC [nuclear, biological, chemical] weapons 
technology." The report also says that products for NBC weapons 
systems have been exported with the help of intelligence service 
personnel through Iranian cover firms in Germany and abroad, 
bypassing all export bans. The attorney of a joint plaintiff 
has requested that the report of the Office for the Protection 
of the Constitution be now used in the Mykonos trial.

<F P=106> [Speech by Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel at the Council on </F>
Foreign Relations in Washington on 21 April] 
  [Text] On 9 January President Clinton stressed in Brussels 
the unique significance of the European-U.S. partnership in 
fate. Hardly any country is so much aware of that as Germany. 
In the U.S. headquarters in Berlin, John F. Kennedy's phrase 
"The world must know that we are willing to fight for Berlin" 
can be read in bronze letters. 
  Tomorrow U.S. soldiers and their families will be the guests 
of families in Berlin and will say good-bye. They came as 
occupiers, became protectors, and leave as friends -- as was 
stated by Major General Walter Yates, who will be the last U.S. 
soldier to leave Berlin on 15 October. 
  Polls show: For more than 80 percent of Germans the United 
States is the most important partner. It is said that States 
only have interests and no friends. However, the Marshall Plan, 
the Berlin blockade, and, most recently, reunification showed us 
to our pleasure that peoples do have friends. Our American 
friends must know: This will never be forgotten. 
  As a result of the end of the East-West conflict, a 
worldwide 
threat to security has been abolished. Economic aspects are now 
becoming more important all over the world -- also in the 
European-U.S. relationship. However, I am profoundly convinced 
-- and this, Ladies and Gentlemen, is my most important message 
to you this evening -- that Germans and Americans will be able 
to continue the great chapter of success of the postwar period 
also in the new time. For quite a simple reason: We need each 
other in the future just as we did in the past! 
  We have not only common interests but our common interests 
and ties far exceed our differences. Germany and the United 
States form the core of NATO. Never before have U.S. Armed 
Forces been so closely interlaced. We are alternating as world 
champions in export, and we are leading in the support for 
Central and East Europe and the CIS states. The dollar and 
German mark are the main reserve currencies in the world, and we 
are both leading in the protection of the natural bases of life. 
Since 1945 more Americans have lived and worked in Germany than 
anywhere else in the world. The United States is the biggest 
foreign investor in Germany and, at the same time, number one in 
German foreign investments. 
  For 40 years we successfully were against communism. Today 
the important thing is what we stand for together. This is more 
difficult, but also more profitable: Up to now we had to invest 
in armament, now we can finally turn to the tasks of peace. 
Just as we, together with France, are the engine of European 
integration in the European Union [EU], we, together with the 
United States, want to be the engine for enforcing 
European-Atlantic goals. Being the common driving force for 
efficient multilateralism -- this is our idea. Making sure 
together that the new multilateral order, rudiments of which 
already exist, works properly -- this is our goal. 
  The ties between us, which have proved their worth over 40 
years, are not weakened by European unification -- on the 
contrary, they get an additional dimension: We also understand 
ourselves as an important supporter of European-U.S. dialogue 
and as a guarantor of an Atlantic Europe which is open to the 
world, supports free trade, and in which our American friends 
will always remain our most important partner. This European 
dimension of our relations will become increasingly important in 
the future, given the new importance of economic and trade 
issues. I am convinced that President Clinton's planned visit 
in July will make this new dimension of our ties very clear. 
  After reunification and the fall of the Iron Curtain our 
interests remain basically unchanged: 
  First: We owe security and prosperity to being anchored in 
the Western community of peoples through the EU and the Alliance. 
  Second: European and Transatlantic anchoring cannot be 
played off against each other; they are inseparable and 
interdependent. 
  Third: The Alliance is the most important and indispensable 
link across the Atlantic. It is a forum for dialogue, an anchor 
of security, a shield for European unification, and a manager of 
regional conflicts all in one. Without the Alliance there would 
not be any balance in Europe; in particular, however, there 
would not be any equal partnership with Russia, which we are 
striving for together. The wooing of the old lady NATO could 
not be more stormy than it is at the moment. In Germany, NATO 
is more popular than ever in the past 15 years. It may sound 
paradoxical in view of the end of the East-West conflict, but if 
NATO did not exist, one would have to invent it again! 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, today we are confronted with issues 
that hardly anyone thought about 10 years ago: How can the 
citizens in the industrial states get appropriately paid jobs, 
if hundreds of millions of people in East Europe or in the Third 
World compete with them for a fraction of the wages paid in our 
countries? How can we establish a stable and liberal order all 
over Europe after the end of communism? How can we prevent the 
struggle for technological superiority from turning the three 
large industrial regions into opponents? 
  During the hour that I am talking to you here, another 
10,000 
people will be born. In the course of 800 years -- from the 
birth of Christ to the time of Charlemagne -- mankind grew by 50 
million. Today it is growing by this number within eight months. 
Can we brake this development in time, before it will become 
impossible to live a decent life in this world? 
  We need look no longer for a new transatlantic agenda for 
the 
turn of the millennium. These challenges are the agenda. If we 
want to save something of the prosperity and the security of our 
days for our children and grandchildren in the next millennium, 
then this agenda must lead to common transatlantic solutions. 
Japan and the Pacific area must be included. Never has 
political leadership been more urgent than during this time of 
revolutionary changes. And it can come only from one country -- 
the United States. The superpower United States must keep its 
leading role! 
  I see four main tasks for a strategic transatlantic 
partnership: 
  First: All three large industrial regions must put their 
houses in order. This is the precondition for successful 
cooperation toward the outside. The G-7 conference in Detroit 
was a signal: The employment crisis cannot be solved by working 
against each other. Detroit may have shown a vision for the 
future: European vocational training coupled with U.S. 
mobility. We are learning from each other. 
  The great trump card of your country is the readiness for 
change, the courage to follow new paths. In the United States 
the multimedia world of the 21st century is currently 
developing. West Europe must get away from the mentality of the 
status quo and of complete insurance. However, the economy in 
our countries is also experiencing an upswing again. The 
extraordinary effort of internal unification is showing success. 
In the new laender we expect a growth of 8 percent this year. 
We want to participate in heading the necessary intellectual 
and economic renewal of Europe. 
  Second: Whether it will be possible to save the world from a 
relapse into the power struggles of the past will be decided in 
Europe. With the same energy that the United States and West 
Europe used to preserve West Europe's freedom in the postwar 
period, they now must help to make democracy and market economy 
irreversible all over Europe. The opening up of the EU and NATO 
toward the East is thus becoming the decisive stabilizing 
element. This means setting the course in Europe for the next 
years. 
  The accession of Norway and the so far neutral countries 
Austria, Finland, and Sweden to the EU, for which I have worked 
with all my strength, will be another milestone in overcoming 
the European division. However, the postwar Europe will be 
completely a part of history only when Hungary, Poland, the 
Czech Republic, and others also sit at the table in Brussels. 
European and German interests are parallel in this respect. We 
are the advocate for the return of these states to Europe. 
However, this does not mean that we want to get away from the 
West. We want to have "West" also at our eastern border, that 
is the point! As little as Europe was viable with the Iron 
Curtain, as little can it flourish in the long run with a 
dividing trench which divides the European democracies into a 
two-class system. 
  After centuries of fratricidal wars and two world wars, the 
reconciliation of minds and the unification of forces in Europe 
remains a historical task. And if there is a foreign policy 
mission for the united Germany, then it is the mission to 
support this task, to unify Europe, and to save it from a 
relapse into the past. The path toward this is the one that we 
are following: common institutions, a big single market, equal 
laws, and regional solidarity. Everything in Europe is oriented 
toward this model of the EU -- like metal parts toward a magnet. 
It will determine Europe's course in the future. Therefore, my 
message to our American friends: Even if the EU is not yet what 
we would like it to be -- do not underestimate this Europe! 
  The discussion about our participation in the D-Day 
celebrations in Normandy shows that 50 years are a short time in 
the memories of the peoples. However, we know how much new, 
real ties have developed despite the continuing memory of all 
the terrible things of the past. De Gaulle rightly called the 
close German-French relationship the actual miracle of the 
postwar period. We ourselves do not want to ignore our past. 
We are building on it, and we see our view confirmed that 
memories do not block the view into a better common future. 
  The credo of your administration: "Foreign policy is 
domestic policy is foreign policy" applies to us Germans in a 
particular way: A humane, liberal face of our country, our 
credibility as democrats are the basic precondition for our 
position in the international community. I do not want to play 
down in any way the ugly and incomprehensible things that have 
happened in the recent past in Germany to foreigners or Jewish 
facilities. I just ask you to believe me when I say: This is 
done by deluded individuals. This is not Germany! We Germans 
are ashamed of that, we abhor it! We have learned from our 
history. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, Jim Hoagland once called the 
traditional U.S. attitude toward European integration "creative 
ambivalence." I would call the position of the current 
administration a position of "creative involvement." With its 
offer of the Partnership for Peace the United States has 
convincingly documented its power of political leadership and 
its continuing will to participate in shaping the European fate. 
  Now there is a concept for solving the complicated security 
needs in the postcommunist Europe, a concept that has met with 
widespread approval. It avoids the dead end of the either 
membership or exclusion. It facilitates a flexible approach to 
NATO without tearing up any new trenches. 
  I hope that Russia, too, will join in soon. To all those who 
are calling for a "take and run policy" by referring to 
Zhirinovskiy, that is, quickly lowering a new Iron Curtain a few 
hundred kilometers east of the old one, I can only say: Anyone 
who now leaves the reformers in Moscow in the lurch burdens 
himself with great responsibility. Russia is undergoing a 
tensile test. 
  No one could seriously have expected that this enormous 
process of transformation from a dictatorship to democracy would 
take place without any problems. We must not show less 
understanding and patience toward the new democratic forces in 
Moscow now than we showed to the communist apparatchiks in the 
past. As long as Russia says "yes" to partnership with Europe 
and the United States, we want to say "yes" to partnership with 
Russia. 
  A new European order presupposes equal rights and mutual 
respect -- for big and small. We must help the reformers, who 
are under great pressure at home, to keep their country on this 
European course. Russia is a large and important country, which 
cannot be bypassed by a new European peace order. 
  The actual question is not whether the West can influence 
the internal development in Russia but whether it can afford not 
to try. I think: No, it cannot, and with this opinion I find 
myself in the company of Warren Christopher. 
  Third: The EU and the United States must together become the 
most important supporter of the new multilateral architecture 
and its global responsibility. Germany wants to participate in 
this fully, if necessary also with military means. However, 
global co-responsibility must also mean global co-determination. 
In this spirit we have registered our claim for a permanent 
seat on the UN Security Council. I am grateful for U.S. support. 
  Regarding greater German co-responsibility in the United 
Nations there is broad agreement between the Federal Government 
and the opposition. However, this consensus does not cover the 
role of the Bundeswehr. As a Liberal I certainly do not want a 
militarization of our foreign policy. As a realist, however, I 
also know that there are situations in which aggression and 
violence can be ended only with violence in return. 
  Germany's foreign and security policy cannot ignore this 
insight. As a result of the changed tasks of NATO and the 
Western EU, this now involves our ability to function in the 
alliance! We will not forget our past, but we will not hide 
behind it, either. I expect the Federal Constitutional Court to 
pave the way for that soon. 
  Strategic partnership across the Atlantic naturally requires 
an interlocutor on the European side and a common European 
foreign and security policy, which deserves this name. 
Admittedly, there is still a lot to be done in this respect. 
Germany does not see a common European policy as a restriction 
but as the only chance for really getting something done on the 
world stage. 
  Institutions depend on the interests and possibilities of 
those of their member states that are most capable of action. 
In Croatia and Bosnia not only the EU, but also NATO and the 
United Nations had to realize that. Barbarism has returned 
virtually at our doorstep. The tragedy of Gorazde forces the 
admission: None of the international organizations has passed 
its test so far. On the other hand, we must see clearly that 
there are no simple and speedy recipes for success in this 
conflict. However, resignation is also forbidden. The peace 
process must be continued. 
  We must continue to look for a pragmatic path in the middle. 
It lies in a credible mixture of political and military 
options. In our view, President Clinton's new initiative offers 
a good basis for that. Above all, the political efforts of the 
EU, the United States, and Russia must be brought closer 
together. In this conflict, too, it has been shown again: One 
cannot do without the United States. Therefore, we have urged 
the United States [to undertake] greater involvement right from 
the start. 
  Fourth: Strategic partnership -- this is no less urgent in 
the economy, the ecology, and the North-South field. The GATT 
agreement has banished the danger of the development of trade 
fortresses for the time being. But the trade imbalances in the 
triangle of Europe, the United States, and Japan are an ongoing 
source of serious tension. The EU and the United States agree 
on the need for greater opening up of the Japanese market. 
  In the field of military security we have successfully taken 
one lesson into account for the past 40 years: If one's partner 
is well off, one is also well off. We still have to learn that 
this also applies to the economy. We need some sort of code of 
behavior for the geo-economic age. It must balance competition 
with cooperation, and free trade with ecology and social 
development. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, "For better or worse, we have had to 
learn that we all live in one world, in which we cannot isolate 
ourselves. We have learned that peace and well-being are 
inseparable and cannot be bought at the cost of the pace and 
well-being of another people." This was stated by State 
Secretary Byrnes in his great reconciliatory speech in Stuttgart 
on 6 September 1946. 
  Today we once again make this experience in a world that has 
become freer but not simpler. However, we have every reason to 
rely on the opportunities provided by the new freedom and not to 
let ourselves be discouraged by the risks. If Europeans and 
Americans, Germany and the United States stand together, then 
there is very little that they cannot master together. The 
United States can rely on Germany! We know that we can rely on 
the United States!

<F P=106> [Eberhard Wisdorff report: "Few Features, But Much </F>
Continuity"] 
  [Text] There are going to be important events with a 
bearing on European integration in the coming months. The 
fourth direct elections to the European Parliament take place in 
the middle of June. Two weeks later, Germany assumes its 
six-month presidency of the European Union [EU], which will 
reach its climax with a December summit in Essen, after which 
France will assume this role. Finally, the European Commission's 
mandate expires at the end of the year. 
  This was sufficient reason for Rudolf Scharping, the SPD's 
[Social Democratic Party of Germany] candidate for chancellor, 
to follow up his Washington visit with a visit to Brussels and 
acquaint himself with the problems of the EU and NATO, as he did 
in talks with Delors, NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner, 
and members of the European Parliament, and during a weekend 
visit to Paris. The concept that he revealed to journalists 
contains no major features. However, it lays great emphasis on 
continuity in the basic paths of foreign and European policy, in 
accordance with Federal Republic tradition. 
  Scharping sounds just like Chancellor Kohl when, on the eve 
of the European Parliament elections, he calls for an expansion 
of its powers. "The Strasbourg chamber of deputies must play a 
greater role in the preparations for the 1996 government 
conference as envisaged in the Maastricht Treaty on the subject 
of further reforms, and must emerge from this conference in 
stronger shape," he said. He described the encouragement of 
European integration and relationships with France as one of the 
basic principles of German foreign policy. "Problems such as a 
lack of economic reforms, unemployment, and the security of 
citizens can be better solved together," he said. NATO is 
described as a practical element of European security, which is 
unimaginable without a substantial U.S. presence in Europe. 
Russia's particular role must be taken into consideration 
without accepting any kind of hegemony. 
  The SDP candidate was not ashamed to express his open 
respect 
for the European political commitment of his adversary Helmut 
Kohl. On the other hand, Scharping creates problems for himself 
with his remarks about other adversaries. He complained that 
the German policy on interest rates has offloaded problems onto 
Germany's neighbors. The white paper produced by the Commission 
for Growth, Employment, and Competition has been brushed aside 
too many times, he says. He accuses the CDU/CSU [Christian 
Democratic Union/Christian Socialist Union] of having 
nationalistic tendencies, and criticizes the occasional 
assertive appearances of Foreign Minister Kinkel on the European 
scene. 
  But Scharping is very careful when speaking out on one of 
the 
most important issues of the coming years, the expansion of the 
EU to include Central and East European countries and the 
financial consequences of this. If the occasion so requires, he 
uses a tone different from the frequently euphoric expressions 
of German Christian Democrats. Scharping talks of "variable 
steps" in the spheres of politics, culture, and the economy. 
There is no question of handing over money. The fears of 
southern EU members must be taken seriously. The European 
Agreement signed between the EU and the countries of southern 
and East Europe must be extended, according to Scharping. These 
countries need a European perspective, but no one knows how 
their economies will develop, and that is why no firm date for 
their EU membership can be fixed. 
  As far as this last point is concerned, Scharping is more 
realistic than the CDU/CSU, because during weekend election 
meetings, CSU politicians once again called for increased 
reimbursements from the EU budget to Bonn, and for an eastward 
EU expansion at the same time. This provides no answer to the 
question of who would finance the drastic costs of regional 
development policy and the necessary adaption of agrarian policy 
following the EU's expansion.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "95,000 Tonnes of Nuclear Waste Have </F>
Been Dumped Into the Seas"] 
  [Text] According to the Social Democratic Party of Germany 
[SPD], approximately 95,000 tonnes of nuclear waste have been 
dumped into the world seas. 
  This was announced by the environmental spokesman of the SPD 
Bundestag group, Michael Mueller. The Federal Government dealt 
with a corresponding inquiry by the SPD late in the evening 
yesterday. 
  "Military enterprises are the main culprits," particularly 
in 
former USSR, but also in Western countries, Mueller stressed. 
  Mueller called for a worldwide agreement against dumping 
nuclear material and a ban on nuclear-powered submarines. 
  The member of the Christian Democratic Union, Klaus Harries, 
suggested controls on draining radioactive waste water from the 
reprocessing plants in Sellafield (Great Britain) and La Haque 
(France). 
  The Federal Government sees no need to speak of a "general 
contamination of the world seas" because of the dumping of 
radioactive waste resulting from the civilian and military use 
of nuclear energy. The European coastal waters (North Sea and 
Baltic Sea) are not directly endangered.

<F P=106> [Government statement on signing the GATT agreement in </F>
Marrakesh, delivered by Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt at 
the Bundestag session in Bonn on 22 April] 
  [Text] Madame President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 
  On 15 April the Uruguay Round was concluded successfully. In 
Marrakesh 124 negotiating partners gave their assent to the 
final act. This is a milestone in trade policy. With a new 
framework for world trade, important conditions for promoting 
investments and for creating jobs have been set down. 
  The Marrakesh agreement is of outstanding importance for 
Germany. The export-oriented German economy -- one out of three 
jobs in Germany depends on exports -- will benefit from the 
progress made in liberalization. GATT no longer is just an 
empty term. The Marrakesh agreements are important for all 
people, also in our country. 
  All those who believed that they could hide behind the walls 
of protectionism or could avoid structural changes have been 
wrong. The strong approval for GATT and the newly founded World 
Trade Organization (WTO) clearly shows: The countries in this 
world want free trade, and they want to face up to the 
structural change, because they know this is the only way to 
ensure growth, employment, and prosperity in the long run. 
  The festive signing was preceded by a negotiation marathon 
that lasted seven years, a marathon with many difficulties and 
obstacles. In the course of these seven years profound political 
and economic changes took place. In addition, there were 
disparities and controversies among the partners to the 
negotiations. Often it was difficult to overcome these things. 
  Because of our elementary interest in the liberalization of 
world trade, during the entire period of negotiations the 
Federal Government worked emphatically, also in Brussels, for 
steps of liberalization that are as far-reaching as possible. 
In this connection, it was necessary to balance the differing 
interests within the European Community, if possible without 
losing too much of the substance with regard to the planned 
liberalization. 
  In particular in the final stage of the negotiations in 
December 1993, the Federal Government made an essential 
contribution to facilitating the conclusion of the Uruguay 
Round. We were successful in bridging opposing views, in 
particular toward our French partners. 
  In view of the difficult course of the negotiations, I am 
extremely satisfied that we have managed to achieve an agreement 
of this quality. 
  First, we have achieved far-reaching progress in 
liberalization in many fields. Thus, customs duties are reduced 
by more than one-third on average for access of industrial goods 
to the market. The average customs rate for industrial goods is 
now no longer 6.3 percent but only 3.9 percent. 
  Second, the agreement on trade in services, which exists in 
this field for the first time, is an outstanding success. It 
brings internationally valid obligations for granting 
most-favored-nation status, market access, and national 
treatment. 
  Germany, the world's fourth largest exporter of services, 
will benefit from this agreement in a special way. Services 
constitute about one-quarter of all German exports. 
  Even more important is their contribution to employment. Of 
the 7 million people employed in German export business, about 
one-third are working in the service sector. The new 
multilateral framework will enable the service sector to make 
further progress because of its positive effects on growth and 
employment. 
  Third -- and this was urgently necessary -- we have achieved 
better protection of intellectual property. The agreement 
expands legal protection and, for the first time, links it with 
regulations to enforce these rights. 
  Fourth, for textile and clothing trade we have achieved that 
this sector is reintegrated gradually in the GATT agreements, in 
the GATT rules in the course of a few years. This is in the 
interest of both the industrial countries and the developing 
countries. 
  Fifth, for the agricultural sector we have achieved that 
agricultural production and agricultural trade will be 
integrated more strongly in the GATT and brought closer to the 
GATT. This also establishes the preconditions for greater 
market orientation of this sector. 
  Last, but not least: The newly founded WTO will contribute 
to strengthening the multilateral trade system. GATT will be 
replaced, and this new WTO will replace it. It will contribute 
to the permanent progress and implementation in this 
organization of the process of trade alleviations, customs 
reductions, improvements in services, which has been concluded 
with the Uruguay Round for the time being. 
  Even more important is: With this WTO we will for the first 
time create a functioning instrument of arbitration. Then world 
trade will work less along the lines of "an eye for an eye, a 
tooth for a tooth." If one has to accept real or supposed trade 
problems and measures by another country, one simply does not 
react with retaliation. Rather, things are to be settled if 
possible in this international institution for arbitration. 
This is a very great progress; this is a breakthrough in world 
trade. 
  Here I have to note that I suggested to bring the WTO to 
Bonn. This is an idea which we have to discuss, which we have to 
prepare. The question of the seat is still open. Other states, 
such as Sweden, Canada, and, of course, Switzerland, where the 
GATT Secretariat has its seat now, are also trying to get the 
WTO. However, I think that Bonn, a city in the heart of Europe 
with an excellent infrastructure, would be a serious applicant, 
a good applicant. My ministry is preparing the application. 
  I do not hide the fact that the Uruguay Round has not 
solved all problems. Additional negotiations are necessary, 
primarily for the service sector and here in particular 
regarding financial services, but also in ocean traffic. The 
audiovisual sector has not been finally settled. We will have 
to discuss a multilateral agreement about civilian planes and 
also a multilateral settlement for steel. All this is 
confronting us, but it cannot diminish the value of GATT and 
Marrakesh. 
  Let me say a few brief words on the ongoing so-called banana 
war. In Marrakesh we achieved the protection of our German legal 
position within the European Community. The lawsuit at the 
European Court of Justice has not been prejudiced, it continues. 
Shortly before the signing of the agreement in Marrakesh, one 
of our most important partners signed an agreement about 
government purchases, thus establishing complicated 
interlacements of our banana market regulation. We were able to 
defend ourselves against that. It was not easy, but we managed. 
In any case, this was a fact with which we enforced our views 
clearly and unambiguously on the basis of a correct position. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, Sir Leon Brittan, who headed the 
negotiations for the European Union, spoke of a new trade policy 
vision in connection with the GATT agreement. Now it is 
necessary to fill this trade policy vision with life. Only then 
will it develop its specific use. 
  Even though it is difficult to give an exact figure for the 
expected economic profit, this has been tried several times -- 
with impressive results. The OECD puts the increase in 
prosperity for the international economy at about $270 billion 
in 2002 after the implementation of the liberalization 
agreement. Furthermore, the GATT Secretariat expects world 
trade to be about $755 billion higher in 10 years as a result of 
the Uruguay Round than if the status quo were continued. 
  I repeat, Ladies and Gentlemen: The results of the Uruguay 
Round will benefit all participants in the developing countries 
and in the developed world. I say this with a particular view 
to our partners in the developing countries: Safeguarding the 
interests of the developing countries remains one of the central 
negotiation results. 
  In particular in the new WTO we will continue to pursue the 
further deepening of the integration of the developing countries 
in the multilateral trade system. In addition, in Marrakesh we 
made a statement of commitment to the developing countries: We 
will examine the effects of the Uruguay Round with a view to 
supporting positive measures to achieve their development goals. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, a great number of countries have 
applied for membership in GATT or in the new WTO. This is 
incontrovertible proof of the attractiveness of the multilateral 
trade system. At the same time it is proof of the WTO's ability 
to function. The Federal Government advocates making 
open-minded and speedy progress with these negotiations for 
membership. In particular the countries of the former East Bloc 
must be given prospects for membership. Their membership will 
essentially contribute to the success of the process of 
structural reforms. 
  There are also many new complicated and controversial topics 
that will shortly be on the agenda of trade policy bodies. 
These include the tensions between trade and environment. 
Trade and environmental policy are closely linked. Thus, many 
products can hardly be produced or transported all over the 
world without this having an effect on the environment. 
Conversely, national environmental policy can influence 
international trade; just think of different standards which 
affect the costs of production in specific places. This is 
considered by some to be a threat. They even speak of 
environmental dumping. 
  And now the establishment of a committee in the WTO -- as 
this was decided in Marrakesh -- will take the issue of globally 
effective environmental protection a decisive step forward. We 
have agreed on this and we see this body as a suitable 
institution for discussing these important interrelations. 
  Just as full of tension and politically highly sensitive is 
the other group of topics, namely labor and social standards. 
Ladies and Gentlemen, no one can accept exploiting children's 
labor, labor by prisoners, and forced labor. We must work with 
determination for overcoming these unbearable conditions in the 
world. For this purpose we need a consensus, we need 
cooperation, and, if necessary, also political pressure. 
  However, Ladies and Gentlemen, we do not want to establish 
any new barriers which would further exacerbate the cycle of 
poverty, unemployment, and children's labor. We want a 
multilateral discussion to which all participants make their 
contributions. It is very important that this discussion takes 
place in the appropriate bodies -- in the bodies of the United 
Nations and the International Labor Organization, for instance. 
  This discussion will certainly also be held in the WTO. 
However, it must not dominate or even paralyze the work of the 
WTO. 
  And one thing must be clear: Neither environmental 
protection nor labor and social standards must be turned into 
vehicles for trade restrictions. Some people are just waiting 
to revive protectionism in the world with this vehicle. We would 
all suffer from that and in particular those would suffer who 
want to improve the world's environmental and social standards. 
  A third important topic affects the relationship between 
trade and competition policy. Cross-border investments as well 
as global activities by multinational companies often avoid the 
control of usual regulations for competition, even though they 
often distort competition or restrict trade. 
  We can observe that political pressure is growing to react 
to 
these distortions with trade policy measures. Such a 
development could counteract and devalue the new GATT agreements 
and concessions. Therefore, the whether and how of an 
international competitive order should be discussed soon. 
  The temptation to give oneself onesided advantages and to 
protect oneself against competition through protectionism will 
exist also in the future. Our signature under the Uruguay 
agreement and the adoption of the statement of Marrakesh commit 
us to not giving in to this temptation. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, in the future as in the past I 
consider 
it my priority task as German economics minister to oppose 
protectionism wherever it appears. 
  In our economic policy the strengthening of the German 
competitive position on the world's market, in particular on the 
booming markets in Asia, for instance, but also in Latin 
America, is of particular importance. GATT will that make 
easier for us. GATT is a contribution to overcoming the 
recession and also to solving the structural problems. GATT 
will contribute to giving Germany new opportunities for 
employment.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Pressure of Industry"] </F>
  [Text] In a secret meeting this week, the Federal Security 
Council will decide on the principles of German arms exports. 
Preparatory talks between Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl, 
Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt, and Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel were unsuccessful, state secretary in the Economics 
Ministry Reinhard Goehner (Christian Democratic Union -- CDU) 
told CDU members. According to Goehner, above all, Foreign 
Minister Kinkel has objections. The foreign minister fears that 
Bonn's restrictive guidelines on arms exports, which were 
adopted in 1982, could be undermined by a more liberal 
cooperation arrangement of German firms with foreign companies. 
However, in the Economics Ministry and the Bundestag group of 
Christian Democrats and the Christian Social Union [CSU] the 
readiness is growing to yield to the pressure of the German arms 
industry, which argues by referring to jobs and the possible use 
of military know-how for civilian purposes.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Herzog Is Not a Candiodate of the </F>
Liberals"] 
  [Text] Burkhard Hirsch, spokesman of the FDP [Free 
Democratic Party] Bundestag group, has called on Roman Herzog 
not to run as the government coalition's candidate for the 
presidency. "Herzog is a candidate of the Union, not of the 
liberals" he told HANDELSBLATT. 
  Hirsch explained that the president of the Constitutional 
Court was trying to secure his election by exerting political 
pressure on the FDP. "In this connection, we had to resolve the 
coalition issue very quickly to win back our maneuvering space," 
he said. 
  Hirsch did not say which candidate the FDP would vote for, 
but made it clear that it would back Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher in 
the first two rounds of voting. If no decision is reached by 
then, the liberals will vote for one of the two remaining 
candidates, said Hirsch. "I support Johannes Rau because I 
consider him the right man to bring the two parts of Germany 
closer together," he said. But he added that should the FDP 
faction vote for Herzog, he would accept this. 
  Hirsch considers it wrong to criticize the 
economic-political 
powers of the FDP, even if his party has abandoned its original 
stance vis-a-vis nursing care insurance. "One cannot expect the 
FDP on its own to resolve a problem in the teeth of public 
opinion," said Hirsch, explaining his decision to vote for the 
law on nursing care insurance. He said that in this law, the 
liberals had achieved adequate compensation for employers, so 
that the work factor does not become an even greater burden on 
employment. 
  Hirsch considers his own position inside the FDP secure; 
after all, he achieved the fourth best result in the elections 
to the chairmanship of the North Rhine-Westphalia FDP branch. 
Leftist liberals are certainly not finished inside the FDP, he 
said. Therefore he expects Gerhart Baum to regain his seat in 
the Bundestag. "I am tired of being treated as a liberal fossil 
all the time," said Hirsch.

<F P=106> [Article by Lower Saxony Minister-President Gerhard </F>
Schroeder: "To Use Right-Wingers' Methods Against the 
Right-Wingers?"] 
  [Text] Now what should never again have happened has 
finally happened: A synagogue in Germany has been torched. The 
politicians are reacting with shock and alarm, and are 
demonstrating determination -- but they actually bypass the 
problem. They are competing for the most radical proposals on 
bans, tougher laws, and harsher penalties. And, in every other 
regard, they continue as in the past, until next time. 
  This next time will come, no matter how intensively we try 
to 
prevent it. Admitting this has nothing to do with resignation 
or cynicism. It is virtually a precondition for any rational 
and successful action against right-wing extremism. 
  Luebeck was already "the next time." That right-wing terror 
would be turned against the Jews at some stage could be 
predicted, at the latest since the wave of xenophobia in 1992. 
  Now toughness is supposed to help against the so-called 
Republikaner: banning the party of the Republikaner, depriving 
Schoenhuber of his basic rights, banning Republikaner from 
exercising their profession -- the inventiveness is unlimited 
when the presentation of alleged panaceas is involved. And 
Schoenhuber is on the front pages of the newspapers day after 
day. What else could he wish for? 
  However, this is not the only thing that must arouse 
skepticism. Even in the Social Democratic Party of Germany it is 
exclusively repressive measures against right-wing extremism 
that are currently being discussed. Using the methods of the 
right against the right -- can it work? 
  In fact, all these proposals aim only at the symptoms. They 
divert attention from the reasons for the right-wing violence 
and for the election successes of the Republikaner, even though 
we know these reasons only too well. It is the increasing social 
injustice; it is prospects for life that have been destroyed by 
unemployment; it is the experience of helplessness toward a 
policy in which "solidarity" has become a foreign word. 
  None of that can be found in the debate in Bonn. Certainly, 
it is not easy to admit that the failure of one's own policy has 
also contributed to providing fertile soil for Schoenhuber and 
others. However, we cannot avoid that. Above all, we cannot 
avoid a revision of this policy. 
  Because as long as work, income, and housing in Germany are 
not distributed justly, there will be people who turn their 
frustration into hatred against all those who are different or 
who think differently -- no matter whether or not the 
Republikaner are banned. 
  It is this not-wanting-to-realize, this 
always-being-surprised-again, which prevents rational dealing 
with right-wing extremists (and gives them ever new publicity). 
They is no "right-wing specter" that comes and goes when it 
feels like it. We will have to deal with them for a long time. 
  Repressive means are suitable only when violence and 
instigation are involved. Of course, we have to prosecute 
violence relentlessly -- but still, in particular where young 
people are involved, we must not forget that harsh punishment 
causes rigid attitudes: In this field, too, the renunciation of 
prison reduces the quota of recidivists. 
  Of course, we must consistently punish instigating people. A 
draft law in Lower Saxony to make the penal code more precise in 
this respect has been in the Bundesrat for a year now. It may 
be that we will have to add a supplement because of the terrible 
decision on the holocaust by the Federal Constitutional Court 
[which ruled that denying the holocaust occurred is not a 
punishable offense]. We do not need any new laws that go beyond 
that. They just make the Republikaner important. 
  Of course, the constitutional protection service must watch 
the Republikaner, without any restrictions. And if the courts 
in Lower Saxony continue to prohibit us from watching them, we 
will have to amend our constitutional protection law. 
  Of course, we will dismiss any teacher who causes right-wing 
agitation in our schools. But for that the disciplinary law is 
sufficient. The arguments with which we abolished the decree on 
radicals four years ago are today as correct as they were at 
that time. 
  What is wrong with us that we want to give -- without any 
need to do so -- the Republikaner the publicity of protracted 
procedures for banning someone from his profession? What else 
would be the result of an application to ban the Republikaner 
other than providing them with a wonderful forum to spread their 
cynical way of thinking via all the media? 
  I do not even want to speak of the practical difficulties 
and 
risks of such measures. However, even if we assume that an 
application to ban the party were to be granted by the Federal 
Constitutional Court, How are we supposed to explain to 
potential voters of the Republikaner that it is democratic to 
eliminate their party juridically since we cannot cope with it 
politically -- just in time for the biggest election marathon in 
German history? 
  No. Ignatz Bubis [chairman of the Central Council of Jews in 
Germany] is quite right when he does not file a complaint 
against Schoenhuber. It is bad enough that Schoenhuber's 
well-calculated infamy has been spread by the media all over the 
place. He is just waiting for an opportunity in court to spread 
his anti-Semitic trash and "prove" it in front of benches 
crammed full of journalists. 
  The right-wing agitators deserve a different way of being 
dealt with -- namely not dealing with them at all. I am not 
willing to engage in discussions on television with 
representatives of the Republikaner, because, no matter how such 
an event ends, it makes the Republikaner important. There they 
can present themselves in bourgeois decency, with equal rights 
and with an equal time to speak, and if I really want to deal 
with their ideology, then they are the ones that dictate the 
subject of discussion. 
  I really do not know what is worse: The sympathy that a 
Republikaner functionary who is driven into a corner might 
arouse or Schoenhuber's comradely assurance that "we agree on 
all the important issues." The Republikaner know very well why 
they are trying to force participation in election debates on 
television by going to court. Certainly not because they fear 
any loss of popularity there. 
  In my view, this too is part of the social ostracism of 
right-wing extremism. Not only Max Streibl's "private" meeting 
with Schoenhuber makes the Republikaner socially acceptable. 
The ARD [First German Television Channel] and ZDF [Second 
German Television Channel] are also contributing to this with 
their unfortunate decision about future invitations to election 
broadcasts. Anyone who brings the Republikaner into his program 
because he is also speculating on an increase in entertaining 
suspense is on the way to wishing for a situation like Weimar, 
just because it might be the background for exciting television 
entertainment. 
  We have to deal with right-wing extremist thinking in a 
completely different place and in a completely different way. 
If it is correct that the majority of those who vote for the 
Republikaner just want to express a protest and do not really 
want the Republikaner to participate in government, then it 
hardly helps to take Schoenhuber's party apart with arguments. 
And it is equally unhelpful if we try to "catch" these people 
by increasingly adjusting our policy to the topics and contents 
of the Republikaner. 
  It may be that such a swing to the right is rather to the 
liking of some conservatives -- I think Wolfgang Schaeuble knows 
very well where he is marching with his "new nationalism." 
  What a difference from the end of the 1960's! At that time, 
when the NPD [National Democratic Party of Germany] was in the 
laender parliaments all over the country, Willi Brandt issued 
the slogan "Daring More Democracy" -- and put an end to the 
parliamentary existence of the NPD. 
  And today? When was the last time that the Bundestag adopted 
a law that granted more rights, more freedom, and more democracy 
to the people? We had to amend the asylum law -- but no one is 
talking about a new citizenship law anymore. 
  If it is true that the majority of those who vote for the 
Republikaner vote for Schoenhuber because they have lost trust 
in the functioning of our party system, our rule-of-law state, 
and our social market economy, then there is only one way: We 
must reestablish this functioning -- and not hurrying behind 
right-wing slogans until there is really nothing left of this 
democracy.

<F P=106> ["MJI"-signed report: "The FDP Does Not Mean the Army, but </F>
Election Tactics"] 
  [Text] The Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social 
Union [CDU/CSU] is becoming increasingly annoyed with the 
Bundeswehr policy pursued by the Free Democratic Party [FDP] and 
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel. 
  The FDP chairman and his party's military experts have 
rejected Defense Minister Volker Ruehe's plans -- the reduction 
of the Bundeswehr from 370,000 to a maximum 340,000, the 
reduction of military service to 10 months, and the option of a 
flexible duration of military service. FDP military expert 
Guenther Nolting criticized Ruehe's concept this week as "an 
ill-considered emergency shot." 
  Members of the CDU Bundestag group have called this a 
"double 
game" of the FDP. Kinkel said on 27 January 1994: "We need a 
new concept and Volker Ruehe should present it." FDP 
Secretary-General Werner Hoyer said on 5 January: "An army of 
370,000 men, a 12-month military service, the country's 
security, the need to increase investment, and a lower defense 
budget -- these elements of the Bundeswehr equation do not fit 
together. That is why new considerations are necessary." 
  However, the concept presented by Ruehe in April was 
rejected 
by the FDP, even though it is in line with liberal demands. For 
instance, in the coalition agreement following the 1990 
elections, the FDP called for a nine-month military service. On 
20 January, FDP Secretary General Hoyer advocated a 
"differentiated military service." In this respect, "soldiers 
should be trained for use in home defense brigades...within a 
time that should be much shorter than 12 months." 
  The reduction of the troop strength that the FDP is now 
criticizing actually was in accordance with liberal demands. 
FDP expert Juergen Koppelin on 5 April considered a strength of 
370,000 men as "hardly suitable" for an unbiased discussion of 
the Bundeswehr's future. 
  The same Hoyer, whose January demands were considered in 
Ruehe's planning, earlier this week mentioned the more likely 
reason for the FDP's contradictory attitude. He said that 
Ruehe's concept was an attempt to chum up with the Social 
Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] and a covert signal for a 
grand coalition. So the FDP does not primarily mean the 
Bundeswehr; it means election tactics.

<F P=106> [Interview with Guenter Rinsche (CDU), chairman of the </F>
German Union Caucus in the European Parliament, by Karl-Otto 
Sattler; place and date not given: "Only Europe Can Manage It"] 
  [Text] Guenter Rinsche (63), chairman of the German 
Union caucus in the European Parliament, classifies the 
"unpleasant episode of the protest election" that took place in 
Europe on 12 June as a problem--namely, when one has to take the 
heat for domestic policy matters for which one is not 
responsible. It is still too little known by the general public 
that important decisions are made at the European level which 
affect all citizens. Rinsche is running in the European 
Parliament election in second position on the North 
Rhine-Westphalian Land list of the CDU [Christian Democratic 
Union]. Together with the east German observers, the Union 
caucus in Strasbourg includes 41 members. 
  [Sattler] As early as 1989, the Union parties [CDU/CSU 
(Christian Social Union)] fared rather poorly with 37.7 percent. 
Now they are threatened with an even more miserable performance 
as a result of domestic policy weaknesses. Isn't it frustrating 
to be punished in European elections for things that have 
nothing to do with European politics? 
  [Rinsche] In Germany, 37.7 percent for a large party is 
indeed not the best possible result, whereas elsewhere this 
result would be seen as great. Here in Germany, one had gotten 
used to a system with few parties, and now more groupings have 
the opportunity to enter the parliaments. But you are right, it 
is a problem when one is made to pay the price for things for 
which one is not responsible. Unfortunately, we will have these 
problems as long as the German citizens do not recognize the 
fact that decisions important for their own lives are being made 
in Europe, and that the European Parliament is increasingly 
gaining more rights. It is our job to make this clear, so that 
this unpleasant episode of the protest election will disappear. 
  [Sattler] Also in a European politics sense, the Union 
parties are making things difficult for themselves: Helmut Kohl 
for, and Edmund Stoiber against, Europe. How are you going to 
convey this curious split to the voters? 
  [Rinsche] During an intense discussion with the European 
Parliament representatives of the Union, Stoiber clearly stated 
that he favors the continuation, indeed even a certain 
strengthening, of European unity. But in Stoiber's opinion, 
everything that does not absolutely have to be solved on a 
European scale is to be done by the nations and the Federal 
laender. I think that the difference is not as great as it is 
sometimes portrayed to be. And yet it cannot be denied that 
there are differences here. The CDU accepts in absolute terms 
the concept of Helmut Kohl. It cannot be ruled out that certain 
questions being asked by Stoiber, concerning the funding of the 
European Parliament, for example, will take on increasing 
relevance in Germany as a whole. 
  [Sattler] There are differences, in other words. Who in the 
Union will emerge victorious from the directional battle, the 
pro-Europeans or the Euroskeptics? Fears are making the rounds 
in many European Union [EU] countries that after Kohl there will 
be no more true pro-Europeans. 
  [Rinsche] This notion is indeed being expressed repeatedly. 
Nor can the fact be overlooked that it is Helmut Kohl who is the 
paramount figure in German European politics. For this reason 
the chancellor should be empowered to pursue these politics 
further. I feel that there is a European flexibility in dealing 
with hardships. I am deliberately formulating it this way. There 
will be European hardships, here we should not kid ourselves, in 
the economic, the social, and not least the security 
sectors--one need only think of East and southeastern Europe. If 
we want to cope with all these difficulties, we need European 
unification and the capability to act by the EU. Stemming from 
this necessity is an obligation to act which sooner or later 
will become clear to everyone, also to those who now still 
consider themselves Euroskeptics. 
  [Sattler] What will you focus on primarily during the 
campaign? 
  [Rinsche] We will call attention to the fact that the 
problems which are plaguing the citizen can only be solved with 
Europe--and these include unemployment, the danger of a 
declining standard of living, perceptible losses on the world 
markets compared to the dynamic Asiatic economies, the threat of 
mass migrations, the instability in East and southeastern 
Europe, the murders and rapes in the former Yugoslavia. The EU 
can offer solutions to problems if it shows itself to be capable 
of action. 
  [Sattler] The Union has not come up with an especially large 
number of prominent first-string politicians for the European 
Parliament elections--could this be an indication that even 
after Maastricht the European Parliament is still not taken 
really seriously? 
  [Rinsche] The question is: How do you define prominent 
politicians? That does not automatically mean that the dumb ones 
are here and the smart ones over there, that the well-known 
people are here and the less well-known people there. I feel 
that the level of excellence of the representatives of the 
European Parliament is very definitely comparable to the level 
reached by the representatives of national and regional 
parliaments. But it is true that there are no prominent persons 
here in the sense that they are known throughout the world. 
However, I think this will improve once the debates and 
resolutions resulting from the aforementioned European needs 
penetrate more into the public consciousness. 
  [Sattler] Egon Klepsch as president of the European 
Parliament was not nominated again by the CDU for the 12 June 
election. Why was the most prominent Union politician kicked out 
in Strasbourg? Kohl is supposed to have been the driving force 
behind it. 
  [Rinsche] I don't see it that way. Klepsch is surely the 
most 
outstanding figure in the European Parliament. We are grateful 
for everything he has done, and is doing, for European unity. 
The departure by Klepsch is a very complex question and has a 
number of facets, particularly in Klepsch's CDU land 
organization in the Rhineland-Palatinate. One of these aspects 
is that there are young politicians who want to get ahead; 
another that must be considered is the aspect of the regional 
distribution of candidates, also within individual land 
organizations. Klepsch himself will reflect on where his powers 
will be most meaningfully utilized. I do not think that Helmut 
Kohl triggered the action. Difficulties arose in the CDU 
executive committee of the Rhineland-Palatinate. Kohl acted as 
mediator at the request of the party in that land. A compromise 
was found, one that did not have the approval of all those 
involved.

<F P=106> [Siegmar Schelling, Heinz Vielain report: "New Dispute in </F>
the SPD Over Scharping and Election Program"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- Following the withdrawal of Christoph 
Zoepel, a member of the Presidium of the Social Democratic Party 
of Germany [SPD], from the election campaign team, SPD Chairman 
Rudolf Scharping and the party leadership are facing serious 
conflicts. 
  On Monday [2 May] the draft of the SPD government program 
was 
to have been finally adopted by the party's Executive Committee. 
According to information received by WELT AM SONNTAG, it is 
doubtful following Zoepel's departure whether a final decision 
can be made. 
  An SPD spokesman told WELT AM SONNTAG on Saturday: "The 
meeting is scheduled to start at 1300. What will happen then is 
not clear." A member of the Executive Committee stated: "A 
quarrel with a great deal of saber rattling is threatening to 
erupt." It has also become known that a meeting of the 
Presidium is to be convened. The SPD government program is to 
be officially adopted at the federal conference in Halle on 22 
June. 
  SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping, who was in Paris over the 
weekend, stressed that, after the resignation of Zoepel, who was 
responsible for transportation and housing in the shadow 
cabinet, Scharping sees "no reason whatsoever for changing our 
position." Concerning Zoepel's departure from the commission, 
which has ended its work, "no reasons referring to the contents 
are discernible." "There has never been a single contentious 
issue" within the commission regarding environmental policies. 
  Zoepel naturally sees things differently. In a personal 
letter to Scharping on Friday, he cited "differing views on the 
work style and the task of the commission responsible for the 
government program," which have led to "misunderstandings 
between you and me that cannot be settled" as the reason for his 
step. Moreover, there is apparently a conflict between the 
position advocated by Scharping on traffic issues and the 
"credibility of the work that I have done so far, which makes it 
impossible for me to represent the SPD." 
  According to information received by WELT AM SONNTAG, 
Scharping and Zoepel quarreled vehemently as early as last 
Monday at the Presidium session. The cause of the dispute was a 
speed limit demanded by Zoepel. Scharping, however, only agreed 
to a speed limit without a specific ceiling. Also, Zoepel 
criticized Scharping's style of leadership. 
  The manager of the SPD Bundestag Group, Struck, called for 
party unity on Saturday. The public debate about the government 
program was "annoying." He described Zoepel's step as 
"regrettable" and an "overreaction." 
  WELT AM SONNTAG learned that the presentation of the spring 
report by the economic research institutes, which predicted a 
growth of 1.5 percent, had caused considerable unease among the 
party's left wing. They insist on the inclusion of more 
specific social regulations in the SPD government program, which 
should be financed through additional burdens on the top third 
of tax-payers -- in the form of higher energy taxes, a surcharge 
on the financial assets of private households, and higher 
taxation of the increase in the value of immovable property.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping in Bonn </F>
by Ulrich Wickert in Cologne -- live] 
  [Text] [Wickert] When the traffic expert Christoph Zoepel 
was criticized for a lack of discipline after his resignation, 
he accused the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] of 
authoritarian thinking. Good evening, Mr. Scharping. 
  [Scharping] Good evening, Mr. Wickert. 
  [Wickert] Is it not necessary for a party leader to be 
authoritarian occasionally? 
  [Scharping] In any case, he should know what he wants, what 
his goals are, and how they can be realized together with the 
party. 
  [Wickert] What do you want? 
  [Scharping] A policy that ensures social justice and that 
takes the people in Germany seriously, that fights against 
unemployment, and that guarantees inner peace in this country on 
the basis of completely solid finances. 
  [Wickert] Well, this is what everybody wants. However, 
where are you leading your party as far as the program is 
concerned? 
  [Scharping] We confirmed again today that economic growth, 
entrepreneurial initiatives, competitive jobs, and ecological 
progress are indivisibly linked. We suggested a number of 
individual measures in this respect, including very specific 
proposals for families with small children -- uniform family 
allowances, a tax exemption for the subsistence minimum, and 
other measures, for example. 
  [Wickert] Let me ask you how you have led the party here? 
  [Scharping] I hope that I have ensured that the SPD 
concentrates on these important issues and adopts a clear 
profile. 
  [Wickert] What are your guidelines as far as contents are 
concerned? 
  [Scharping] I tell everybody my view. If I hear better 
arguments, I am glad because one should never rule out that one 
can learn something. I was negligent in the tax debate in that 
I forgot to add the word taxable in connection with income 
limits. If somebody points out such a mistake, this is a 
necessary and important correction. By the way, my style is 
leadership through arguments and teamwork, clear decisions, and 
the joint implementation of decisions. 
  [Wickert] This is not really authoritarian. You have also 
been accused of failing to present an unclear program. 
  [Scharping] I consider both accusations wrong. Actually, 
both of them are new to me. I have never been accused of being 
authoritarian before. I have the impression that certain people 
are overreacting. Assertiveness is certainly a good quality in 
a party chairman. One must also have clear goals. Yet one 
cannot issue orders. One cannot lead a party like the SPD, 
which has about 900,000 members, like a military unit. 
  [Wickert] Well, nobody is demanding that. However, a firm 
hand is needed sometimes. Do you have a firm hand? 
  [Scharping] I think so, if it is required. This has become 
clear during various debates in the past -- at our party 
conference, and before and after that. I only hope that there 
will not be too many situations in which one must not only lead, 
but show a firm hand. That is not my style. However, if it is 
necessary, I will be able to cope with it. 
  [Wickert] Has Mr. Zoepel's resignation prompted the large 
extent of agreement today? 
  [Scharping] No. It existed before that event. We specified 
-- improved, I believe -- the government program in numerous 
areas today. The debate was worthwhile. After all, we are the 
only party that discusses its government program with committed 
and well-informed citizens at 200 public events. This is a sign 
of open and living democracy. This is our policy. 
  [Wickert] Well, this is the way you present your party to 
the public. Yet what happens within the party is also 
important, whether there will be quarrels. 
  [Scharping] We will have to wait and see. However, I am 
convinced that the SPD will continue to be what it has always 
been and what it is: A reform-oriented people's party that 
holds discussions, that defines its policy, and on which one can 
rely. 
  [Wickert] Thank you very much, Mr. Scharping.

<F P=106> [Article by Gunter Hofmann: "Playing It Completely Safe" </F>
  [Text] Rudolf Scharping reacted calmly as always to the 
criticism of his party friends from Schleswig-Holstein. He's not 
about to let them throw a monkey wrench into his plans, even if 
his choice of words might have been a little less harsh. And 
least of all after his return from Washington and New York, and 
the friendly echo that his obligatory performance triggered 
there. 
  Calmly, he predicted that also the grumbling in the SPD 
[Social Democratic Party of Germany] caucus in the Bundestag 
over his "governing program" would subside once the matter had 
begun to be discussed there--as has always been the case in the 
past. And just as calmly (please read on!) did he come out of 
the debate, which never materialized. 
  Calmness is his trade mark and, in part, perhaps even his 
program. Translated into political terms, this means that he 
would somehow like to occupy the political middle. Such 
imperturbability resembles that of the chancellor, who, 
incidentally, is likewise averse to releasing the ominous middle. 
  The "rock-in-the-breakers" motif is indeed currently being 
experienced in two versions [Scharping's and Kohl's], and the 
adherents of both politicians are undecided whether to view 
their tremendous unruffledness as exciting, frivolous, or boring. 
  As was the case among the comrades in Eckernfoerde during 
their party congress, and, for that matter, is the case 
generally among many Social Democrats being questioned at this 
time, the prevailing mood tends more in the direction of 
criticism. But does one want to rob the candidate and party 
chairman of the optimism with which--as he did again recently 
before the representatives--he speaks of "resoluteness and 
unity"? 
  Who is spreading the bad mood in opposition? Silence 
prevails 
in the room, aside from a few cursory peripheral comments 
concerning minor changes that might be made to give the 
consumer, taxation, and traffic policies a little more color. 
Not to forget the 250 German marks [DM] child allowance. 
  To be sure, Rudolf Scharping says that he wants a 
discussion, 
now! But at the same time this discussion must, at the latest, 
be over and done with by the party congress on 22 June in Halle. 
But such a discussion will never even materialize. Even the 
representatives from Schleswig-Holstein had already forgotten, 
by the time they left for Bonn, their misgivings about the 
"timidity, lack of profile, and ennui," which could cause the 
electoral victory to be squandered. 
  Doubts are growing, and, what is more, within the SPD, 
whether the single issue of employment will suffice to unseat 
the incumbent chancellor and to serve as the basis for the great 
transition. Members of one group are asking for small changes in 
direction. The others, such as Michael Mueller, are hoping that 
the transition in October will bring about some fundamental 
changes, and they would now like to get at least some idea of 
this change: to wit, how the civilization process can still be 
controlled in the future and an entirely amorphous development 
prevented. And that despite the realization that the economy is 
dramatically distancing itself from intervention by the federal 
state. 
  Whether they be wishes for small guidelines or hopes 
directed 
at a major change in paradigms--many of the party colleagues are 
currently shelving their doubts. In view of this, it is nothing 
short of a bold exception to the rule when the Social Democrats 
from the north play out their trump cards by insisting on a 1.5 
percent property levy on the "especially rich," which would 
allegedly bring in DM600 billion in additional revenues, a labor 
market tax on civil servants and the self-employed, a speed 
limit, renunciation of the Intercity Express project [a planned 
high-speed rail line between Hamburg and Berlin], or a 
Bundeswehr trimmed down to 300,000 soldiers. 
  Rudolf Scharping will have to give in to some extent, to be 
sure. But basically there has been no change in the "campaign 
philosophy" as recently formulated in the TAGESZEITUNG by SPD 
whip Guenther Verheugen, according to which "financial security, 
job security, social security, internal and external security," 
are the issues of primary concern. Security per se. Together 
with its siblings: Caution! Freedom from risks! Avoidance of 
conflicts! 
  In Verheugen's opinion, a speed limit would be an "absolute 
killer topic" [during the campaign]. The secretary continued: 
Election results of recent years have shown that, on the one 
hand, majorities can be gained for parties showing a tendency to 
bring about change. On the other hand, however: "Whereby--I 
admit--it is difficult to distinguish whether the people really 
want changes or whether they are simply so dissatisfied with 
what they have been offered in the past that anything at all is 
preferable to what they have now." 
  Do they just want to get rid of Helmut Kohl, or do they want 
more? In the assessment of this question, the SPD is unsure of 
itself, and resulting from this uncertainty is its "security 
philosophy." But since it does not know if the people want "real 
changes," e.g. in matters related to the environment, the party 
is likewise reluctant to become truly more precise. 
  Always to be recommended, to be sure, is that reality not be 
lost sight of for sheer bureaucracy and red tape. In that case, 
however, based on the ideas promulgated to date, how is even a 
breath of the atmosphere of breaking up and launching a new 
beginning to be conveyed? 
  And what is more: If the election year is not utilized to 
gain majorities for certain policies, where, in the period of 
doubt that prevails afterwards, are the impulses and the inner 
legitimacy to come from which are to serve as the basis for the 
new beginning? Basically no differently than the CDU [Christian 
Democratic Union], the SPD, as well, must after all first 
recreate leeways for creative politics. It is precisely at this 
juncture that confidence in Helmut Kohl has waned. What is 
politics able to accomplish at all any more? And what are 
parties able to accomplish in the process? And could the 
cogoverning opposition accomplish more and other things along 
these lines than Kohl's coalition? 
  If, for example, in matters pertaining to the ecology, the 
SPD currently ignores or puts off until after the election much 
of what has been laboriously learned in the course of time, this 
can hardly be quickly made up for again tomorrow. What is 
unimportant today will not automatically become relevant again 
tomorrow. 
  All this is being carried on the shoulders of Rudolf 
Scharping alone, without a "team." At most, Oskar Lafontaine 
becomes slightly perceptible along the periphery. But otherwise? 
The chairman either takes everything on himself, or (more 
likely) he mesmerizes everyone with his sober reflectiveness. At 
any rate, the SPD campaign seems to consist primarily of him. 
The situation is similar in the CDU with Kohl, and in the FDP 
[Free Democratic Party] with Kinkel: politics as a solo program. 
  Patiently, Rudolf Scharping answers his critics by pointing 
out that so far he has always reached his objective. With 
unruffledness. Witness the asylum law, the blue helmets, 
appointment to the Constitutional Court. The more often 
Scharping puts something off for the future, the more impatient 
some of his adherents become, however, or they defect to the 
Greens, something which the latter can only welcome. 
  The fact that shedding ballast and leveling out differences 
with the government are not enough must, at the latest, have 
become clear to Scharping during his America trip. For hardly 
does he show a willingness to yield and does he discover (not 
only foreign policy) commonalities, when CDU caucus chairman 
Wolfgang Schaeuble and others search anew for what separates 
them. Here with the notion that the Bundeswehr be employed 
domestically, there with the proposal that it be used in the 
Balkan conflict as well--all these things are not least intended 
to show the opposition, despite all its adjustments, in an 
unflattering light. 
  A dangerous game, both with the constitution as well as with 
"Francistic methods," thus Scharping's reply to Schaeuble. But 
does the SPD have much of its own to counter this with? Aside 
from distancing itself--did it prepare itself early on and 
adequately to oppose the fact that foreign policy a la Schaeuble 
is being increasingly subordinated to "nationalistic criteria," 
as Scharping now claims? If it is convinced of its need, should 
it not long since have evidenced a firm Europe-oriented policy? 
Can it offer the East Europeans greater "membership prospects" 
today than the government, and in addition one which has also 
been coordinated in the West? Did it counter, in good time, 
Schaeuble's recommendation that unity can only be gained with 
national emotions? 
  So far the SPD has not come up with an answer to the 
question 
as to how it can win over those who adhere to their "breaking up 
atmosphere" in the event a policy marked by vagueness and 
putting off and a very imperturbable candidate perhaps do not 
suffice. 
  The Discovery of Slowness--thus the title of a novel 
published in the early 1980's. These words took wing, seemed to 
breathe zeitgeist, indeed even seemed to serve as a prescription 
for politics. But is it appropriate for today's dramatic 
conditions? Can it be a prescription for the 1990's? Sten 
Nadolny's hero, incidentally, the slow one, got far, but he fell 
short of reaching his objective.

<F P=106> [Article by Andreas Wassermann: "Dresden Kaleidoscope of </F>
Colors"] 
  [Text] Kurt Biedenkopf was fascinated by the Greens at an 
early date--at least as a political phenomenon. When other CDU 
[Christian Democratic Union] politicians were still demonizing 
the alternative party as a threat to democracy and to Germany as 
a business location, the former secretary-general of the CDU, in 
his book "Zeitsignale," was already openly paying respect to the 
Greens: "Most likely it is precisely the radicalness of thought, 
this willingness to talk about the need for compromise only when 
the need has become evident and the idea as a whole appears to 
be unimplementable otherwise, which is the main reason for the 
attractiveness of this party among young people." 
  Nor does the CDU free-thinker want to exclude a party such 
as 
this. In specific cases, he even sees proximities as far as 
content is concerned. And among the Greens, as well, Biedenkopf 
is one of the few conservatives who is held in high regard. Also 
within the alternative party, the politician [Biedenkopf], who, 
after all, was advocating the renunciation of the growth 
ideology before the Greens came into existence as a party, is a 
much sought after discussion partner. 
  It is hardly surprising, therefore, that a black-green 
coalition following the Landtag election on 11 September is 
being discussed in Saxony, of all places--a land governed by 
Biedenkopf with an absolute CDU majority since the fall of 1990. 
The only thing surprising about this is that it is the Greens 
who are the driving force. While at the Federal level it is CDU 
politicians, above all, such as Environmental Minister Klaus 
Toepfer, for example, who are playing out the black-green card, 
albeit without having to take a trick with it, Biedenkopf is 
more laid back. He does, to be sure, in this or that meeting 
with journalists in Bonn, drop a hint that such a coalition 
would indeed have a certain amount of appeal, but officially he 
is "only amused" by the discussion. The reason for this is that 
the minister-president of Saxony is simply pinning his hopes 
untiringly on gaining an absolute majority--despite a headwind 
from Bonn and despite poll results, which give his CDU around 40 
percent in the free state. 
  Things are different with the Greens. Werner Schulz, 
representative of the Bundestag from Leipzig and whip of the 
Alliance 90/Greens group, has been beating the drums for months 
for "the enticing project." Although "the CDU is not exactly our 
dream partner," thus Schulz during an interview with the Berlin 
WOCHENPOST, "from the point of view of the creative 
possibilities, the science of colors really is different here in 
Saxony." While at the federal level no commonalities can be made 
out, he believes that he can "see first signs for a cooperation 
with the CDU" in land politics in Saxony. 
  And it is unlikely that they are more than just first signs. 
Also in Saxony, there is more that separates the Greens and the 
CDU, contentwise, than what links them. It is true that, with 
issues which Biedenkopf views as especially important, the 
Greens are often closer to the CDU free-thinker as far as 
content is concerned than are his own party friends, 
particularly those in Bonn. This is always the case, for 
example, whenever "Wossi" [i.e. both Wessi and Ossi] Biedenkopf 
wants to discuss the future status of pet West German 
possessions. And so Heiko Weigel, chairman of the Greens party 
in Saxony and a Schulz supporter, "agrees in some ways" with 
Biedenkopf's ideas on the dismantling of the state 
administration system, the privatization of public services, and 
the reorganization of the social security system. In the 
domestic and education policy areas, however, which carry much 
more weight at the political land level, also during possible 
coalition negotiations, the CDU and the Alliance/Greens are 
worlds apart in the free state as well. 
  The fact that, despite this, Schulz repeatedly calls on his 
party's land organization to support the black-green option has 
a lot to do with east German peculiarities and federal-level 
political considerations. Schulz sees the influence of the 
Greens dropping dramatically in the Bundesrat, now that the SPD 
[Social Democratic Party of Germany] is able to rule alone again 
in Lower Saxony and the traffic-light coalition in Brandenburg 
has collapsed. According to Schulz, the Greens must "avail 
themselves of every opportunity" to increase their importance 
again in that body. 
  He also feels that, with a black-green alliance at the land 
level, the status of CDU reformers at the federal level, such as 
former Secretary General Heiner Geissler, Environmental Minister 
Toepfer, or Bundestag President Rita Suessmuth, would be 
strengthened, and the Union parties' course to the right that 
caucus leader Wolfgang Schaeuble is pursuing could in this way 
be stopped or at least weakened. In the persons of the Saxon CDU 
reformers gathered around Environmental Minister Arnold Vaatz 
and Social Affairs Minister Hans Geisler, whose political 
molding process took place during the eruption period in the 
fall of 1989, Schulz sees possible alliance partners who could 
also make possible the success of a black-green coalition. There 
is no denying that the Christian Democrats in the free state are 
"an unusual conglomeration, personnelwise, the likes of which 
one finds nowhere else in Germany," Schulz says. 
  There are in fact sympathies for the Alliance/Greens within 
the Saxon CDU, which on the one hand, as in Vaatz's case, stem 
from old attachments in the GDR opposition, and which find their 
definition above all in the mutual rigorousness with which the 
critical reappraisal of the GDR's past is conducted. Joining 
them are unorthodox CDU members in the west who are mourning the 
"missed opportunity" for a black-green coalition in 
Baden-Wuerttemberg. Interested also are CDU politicians such as 
[landtag] caucus leader Herbert Goliasch, who will see their 
influence grow in the event Biedenkopf does not govern in a 
grand coalition together with the SPD but instead only with a 
smaller and less influential partner. 
  Schulz realizes that the black-green color games could make 
or break the land organization of the alternative party, but 
this apparently does not bother him. The Greens in the free 
state are hyperpragmatic to a man, to be sure. But an alliance 
with the CDU would not automatically be approved by a majority 
even among the 1,200 party members in Saxony. At the grass 
roots, the fact that Biedenkopf, contrary to initial assurances, 
does not think much of a politics of "round tables," is deeply 
ingrained. The Alliance 90/The Greens, who see themselves as the 
legitimate heirs of the civil rights movement in the GDR, would 
like to have been involved to a greater extent. And Schulz 
knows, therefore, that the Greens "cannot permit themselves to 
be sold for peanuts" in a possible governing alliance. 
  At the Federal level of the Greens, the kaleidoscope of 
colors in Dresden is being followed without any great 
excitement. Hessen's environmental minister, Joschka Fischer, 
allegedly has no objections to an experiment such as this in 
"faraway Saxony." And his close associate Hubert Kleinert saw 
the value of such reflections already in connection with the 
exploratory talks on participating in the government in 
Baden-Wuerttemberg: "It brought the ecology party a sizable 
increase in public support." However, and of that too Kleinert 
is convinced, the lack of emotion with which the party's grass 
roots accepted the sounding-out talks following the landtag 
election in April 1992 would have "changed abruptly during a 
serious alliance discussion."

<F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Manfred Kanther by </F>
Roderich Reifenrath, Ferdos Forudastan, and Axel Vornbaeumen; 
place and date not given: "Making Extremists of All Shades 
Ineffective"] 
  [Text] [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] Mr. Kanther, what has 
happened to the issues of internal security? Christian 
Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU], Free 
Democratic Party of Germany [FDP], and Social Democratic Party 
of Germany [SPD] announced that they would put it at the top of 
the list of election campaign priorities. Nevertheless, 
internal security is in the background of public discussion. 
  [Kanther] Not at all. We are not just complaining loudly but 
are doing practical work in the coalition. The point is success 
in the matter and not headlines. You can see that the issue is 
very important if you look at what we have achieved: The 
circumstances surrounding the antiterrorist action in Bad 
Kleinen have been clarified; we have presented a 1994 anticrime 
law; we have worked out the concepts for a law dealing with the 
Federal Office of Criminal Investigations and the Federal Border 
Police; the asylum problem has improved; the violent Workers 
Party of Kurdistan (PKK) has been banned; and the program for 
internal security has been adopted together with the laender. 
This is how I want to work. 
  [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] Nevertheless, as a political issue 
internal security is not playing a big role. Is something true 
about the accusation being expressed secretly by some CDU/CSU 
politicians that Manfred Kanther does not really want to 
distinguish himself from the FDP and the SPD, that you are not 
interested in sharpening the conservative profile of the CDU/CSU? 
  [Kanther] First, according to all polls, internal security 
is 
at the top of the list of issues in which citizens are 
interested, right behind economic issues. Second, I am pursuing 
a practical policy in which results are important, not some 
quarrel. We can be satisfied with the results of our work after 
nine months of my term of office; this sharpens the CDU/CSU 
profile regarding achievements -- and this is the important 
thing. 
  [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] Is it so difficult to distinguish 
oneself from the SPD? Basically, their domestic policy concepts 
are no longer really so different from yours. 
  [Kanther] I deny that. The SPD has indeed concurrently 
adopted a different attitude toward issues of internal security 
than in the past. The party leaders in particular are now 
realizing that crime, foreigners, and asylum are questions that 
are important to citizens and that it is impossible to make 
progress with the empty phrases used in the 1980's. However, it 
is still open whether the SPD is really determined to put its 
narrow party congress decisions into practice at the appropriate 
time. They will have ample opportunity to prove that in the 
Bundestag, when a vote is taken on the aforementioned draft laws. 
  [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] In other words: Regarding questions 
of internal security there is no longer the more liberal SPD on 
the one side and the more conservative CDU/CSU on the other? 
  [Kanther] It is good that the SPD has come closer to the 
government in the fields of combating crime or asylum. In this 
way we can work more efficiently, and the Federal Government and 
the laender, the majority of which are ruled by the SPD and are 
largely responsible for the police and judiciary, have an easier 
time cooperating. 
  [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] Has the SPD not already overtaken 
you? In contrast to the CDU and the CSU the party demands that 
assets are to be seized already when the owner cannot refute the 
suspicion that they have been acquired illegally. 
  [Kanther] I think that this SPD demand is untenable in a 
constitutional state. It ignores the principle that the state 
must prove that a citizen is guilty and not the citizen that he 
is innocent. Rejection of this idea is unanimous among the 
experts. After all, the SPD's proposal smells strongly of 
election campaign. Only a few months ago did we make money 
laundering a punishable offense. There has been practically no 
experience yet with the new fine on assets and the so-called 
expanded forfeiture. Thus, it would be wrong to create new 
regulations before the newly introduced regulations have been 
tested. 
  [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] You and the CDU/CSU constantly speak 
of "exploding crime statistics," the "kraken of crime, which is 
stretching its arms out to everything." Of course, many crimes 
are committed. Nevertheless, it seems that the CDU/CSU is 
fanning fears to improve the social climate for ever stricter 
laws. Why else would you present the development of crime as 
worse than it actually is? 
  [Kanther] It is an indisputable fact that more and more 
crimes are committed, and that they have reached a point that is 
unacceptable. We are not exaggerating anything; but we must 
accept reality and react with clear measures. 
  [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] The crime statics do not justify 
your 
drastic perspective. The number of registered crimes during the 
first half of 1993 rose by 3.4 percent; during the same period 
in 1992 we had an increase of 9.6 percent. This slower rate of 
increase is certainly not a reason to sound the all clear, but 
it should be reason enough not to continue frightening the many 
worried people with new depictions of the apocalypse, should it 
not? 
  [Kanther] I read the statistics differently. For instance, I 
see that crime has skyrocketed in the new laender. 
  [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] This is primarily due to the fact 
that up to the period after the fall of the Wall, police there 
hardly kept any crime statistics and that the readiness of the 
east Germans to complain about crimes was negligible for a long 
time. Anyone who ignores all this pursues a "dubious and 
completely unnecessary dramatization," according to the renowned 
criminologist Christian Pfeiffer from Hamburg. Does this 
accusation concern you? 
  [Kanther] Not at all. Unfortunately, crime is not declining 
but rising. There are still those who whitewash a bad situation 
and who often do not want to admit their own political errors. 
In addition, the point is not just the development of 
statistics. What the people feel is equally important, the 
feeling of safety and insecurity is conveyed at a broad level, 
primarily by the media. 
  [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] Liberal lawyers criticize the "1994 
Anticrime Law" as much too restrictive; your own people think it 
is too moderate. Mr. Werthebach, the president of the Federal 
Office for the Protection of the Constitution [BfV], for 
instance, complains that in the future, his office will be 
permitted to keep an eye only on political extremism and not 
organized crime. What do you say? 
  [Kanther] The BfV is sufficiently busy with left-wing 
extremism and right-wing extremism and violence of foreigners in 
the FRG, in particular since it does not have that much 
personnel. Therefore, I do not see any reason to expand its 
competence to cover organized crime. The is the business of the 
police, which must be better equipped for that. 
  [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] In this year's Constitutional 
Protection Report you also did not classify the Republikaner as 
right-wing extremist. Is the examination of this issue so 
difficult because, among other things, the statements of some 
Republikaner are barely different from those of some CDU/CSU or 
SPD politicians? 
  [Kanther] As interior minister I have the duty to examine 
the 
issue of classification very carefully from the juridical point 
of view, because a decision must hold up in court. So far, it 
has not been possible to prove that the Republikaner have a 
basic aggressive-militant attitude against the Constitution. In 
addition, there is not sufficient evidence that the party 
leadership tolerates or promotes political or criminal 
perpetrators in their own ranks. On the contrary. Many party 
functionaries have long restrained themselves verbally so that 
they cannot be attacked. Just because one feels like throwing 
up when one hears Mr. Schoenhuber's ranting, one cannot classify 
the Republikaner as extremist or ban them. This is the field of 
political conflict, which FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU has been 
demanding for 20 years in the struggle against political 
left-wing extremists in many different disguises. 
  [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] Bavaria's minister-president warns 
against the "penetration of society by other races" and 
"lecherous niggers"; a CDU mayor states that, in order to 
balance the city budget, "a few rich Jews" would have "to be 
killed"; an SPD group chairman suggests a solution to the asylum 
problem: Make short work of it, grab them by the head and the 
collar and throw them out. And so on and so forth. Did you not 
classify the Republikaner as extremist because it is a political 
problem to measure them by their words, which are strongly 
similar to those of some CDU and SPD politicians? 
  [Kanther] I consider such a question detestable and, 
therefore, I am not going to answer it. Back to the matter at 
hand: I can classify a party as extremist or ban it only if 
there is enough proof available. Imagine what would happen if 
the Republikaner sued against the classification as right-wing 
extremist and were to win: This would be a self-inflicted wound 
for democracy. However, I would also like to mention somebody 
else who bears responsible in connection with right-wing 
extremism: the media. In my view, coverage of the Republikaner 
is excessive. One constantly hears and reads what Mr. 
Schoenhuber said. However, only a few newspapers or television 
stations ask what is behind the empty phrases of the 
Republikaner chairman. One hears practically nothing about what 
the party suggests for the protection of internal security, for 
the solution of economic problems, and that it does not offer 
serious concepts for anything. 
  [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] Does that meant that the media are 
to 
be blamed for the success of the Republikaner? Should one keep 
silent about the rightists? 
  [Kanther] This would be completely wrong. However, 
journalists, too, must be aware of what their reports are doing. 
There is a narrow edge between necessary coverage and constant 
repetition of identical facts, which may then be transformed 
into free propaganda. There is no panacea for that. I think 
that many people in the media are not sufficiently aware of this 
sensitive situation. 
  [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] Are the politicians of the CDU/CSU, 
FDP, and SPD sufficiently aware of how they have to deal with 
the right-wing radicals and right-wing extremists? We feel that 
the established parties tend toward adjusting toward the 
political right because they fear to lose voters. And we are 
also thinking of the endless discussions about joint television 
appearances and panel discussions with the Republikaner. 
  [Kanther] The latter must be decided in each individual 
case. 
One thing quite clear, however: The democratic parties must 
never give the impression that we are cooperating with the 
Republikaner. The Hesse CDU, for instance, did not conclude one 
single agreement with the Republikaner on personnel decisions 
after the local elections in March 1993. However, the 
democratic parties must not make themselves dependent on what 
the Republikaner think. If the CDU or SPD were never again to 
initiate local policy without the approval of the Republikaner, 
the traditional parties would have to give up their work. This 
would be an absurd logic. By the way: At the local level one 
usually cannot deal with the radicals regarding material issues, 
because they are mostly either absent or lazy, uninformed, and 
torn by strife. In Hesse local policy there would be the 
opportunity to publicly deal with the Republikaner through 
motions on specific issues. This has not occurred because the 
Republikaner have not participated. It is important to explain 
this complete ineffectiveness to their voters. 
  [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] Even if the Republikaner were not in 
some parliaments or did not have good prospects of entering a 
few more, we would nevertheless have to live with a certain 
potential for a basic right-wing extremist attitude in society 
and with right-wing extremists. How much right-wing extremism 
can a state such as the FRG tolerate? 
  [Kanther] One has to put the question differently: How much 
extremism can a fundamentally liberal system afford? I think 
this depends on an overall assessment of the danger. We 
tolerated DKP [Communist Party of Germany] left-wing extremeists 
for 30 years, who were supported by a communist superpower. It 
was argued that one has to deal politically with these groups 
and persons. This also applies to dealing with right-wing 
extremism. Even if right-wing extremism were to decline to .01 
percent, one would still have to live with these madmen, just as 
we live with the leftist madmen. The task consists in making 
political extremists of all shades completely ineffective 
politically. However, there is an additional danger that 
emanates from the right-wing extremists: Because of German 
history, it is viewed much more strongly by other countries and 
harms our international image. This is another central reason 
for me to deal with right-wing extremists.

<F P=106> [Interview with Kay Nehm, the new federal public prosecutor, </F>
by Alfred Merta, Friedemann Weckbach-Mara, and Barbara Schmid; 
place and date not given: "More Police on Our Streets!"] 
  [Text] [BILD AM SONNTAG] Four years after the GDR 
collapsed, there are still Stasi spies being unmasked and 
charged. Does this still make sense? 
  [Nehm] We are currently investigating the cases of some 800 
"Western German" suspects. This is not just a matter of 
criminal investigations, but we also have to be aware that spies 
who have not yet been unmasked can easily be blackmailed by 
foreign intelligence services, especially in the long run. We 
have to prevent them from becoming spies again. 
  [BILD AM SONNTAG] Are you still investigating the case of 
Karl Wienand, former group manager of the Social Democratic 
Party of Germany? 
  [Nehm] With the investigations now mostly completed, we will 
decide in the near future whether we will have to bring charges 
against him. 
  [BILD AM SONNTAG] Following events in Bad Kleinen, do you 
fear fresh terror attacks by the RAF [Red Army Faction]? 
  [Nehm] At the moment there are intense discussions going on 
within the RAF on whether they should change their objectives 
and renounce violence. If the "hardliners" get their way over 
the next few weeks, attacks cannot be ruled out. 
  [BILD AM SONNTAG] Do you have any hot leads in the arson 
attack on the Luebeck synagogue? 
  [Nehm] We are currently investigating some 250 leads. If we 
persevere, I expect that we will be able to clarify the matter 
and bring those guilty of the Luebeck attack to trial. 
  [BILD AM SONNTAG] More severe laws are frequently being 
called for, both for political extremism and for ordinary 
crimes. Do we need these? 
  [Nehm] In some fields we would need clearer laws rather than 
more severe ones -- laws that the judiciary can handle more 
easily. Let me give you an example from the narcotics law. In 
this context it is important whether a suspect possesses a 
"larger amount" of drugs. The practical interpretion of this 
term inevitably causes problems. 
  [BILD AM SONNTAG] Do you want to allow this "great bugging 
campaign" so that the police can listen in to new crimes being 
discussed? 
  [Nehm] That is a matter on which the politicians will have 
to decide. People tend to expect too much from the great 
bugging campaign. The chances of success are frequently 
overestimated. 
  [BILD AM SONNTAG] Many people feel that they are no longer 
safe in this country. Especially in the cities, many old people 
and women no longer dare go out at night. Burglaries and thefts 
are hardly ever solved.... 
  [Nehm] You have to differentiate between the number of 
crimes actually committed and the rather subjective feeling of 
safety. Of course, it is bad if there is a general feeling of 
threat. The police have to counteract this by showing their 
presence. They have to be more visible in public. There 
should, for instance, be more police patrols on foot. 
  [BILD AM SONNTAG] Does this mean more policemen? 
  [Nehm] It is not necessarily the number that counts, but 
their training. Also, routine and administrative jobs must be 
taken away from the police. But the citizens must also do their 
share. Many burglaries could be prevented if apartments were 
better protected. People should carefully list and photograph 
valuable items to make searching for stolen goods easier for the 
police. I am in favor of establishing a criminal proceedings 
register. Every criminal offense would have to be listed 
centrally, and we would no longer investigate each individual 
burglary by itself, but we would see whether there is a series 
of offences and whether suspects are operating on a 
supra-regional basis. This would make criminal investigations 
much more efficient. 
  [BILD AM SONNTAG] What do you think of the suggestion of 
using the Bundeswehr for internal security? 
  [Nehm] This is not possible under existing laws. But I do 
not see any danger to the existence and security of the FRG that 
would make an amendment to the constitution necessary. Crime 
prevention does not require this either. 
  [BILD AM SONNTAG] Should blackmail be a punishable offense 
for politicians as it is for civil servants? 
  [Nehm] It would make sense if blackmail were punishable in 
the case of politicians. This would help the population's sense 
of justice, and also the reputation of parliaments. 
  [BILD AM SONNTAG] Is the Federal Office of Criminal 
Investigations [BKA], your most important investigating 
authority, fully operational again after the slip-ups of Bad 
Kleinen? 
  [Nehm] There has certainly been some irritation. The BKA 
has grown quite fast in terms of staffing. This must 
necessarily result in problems. I think that the office could 
be streamlined in many areas. Basically, we have complete trust 
in the BKA, which is indeed our most important investigating 
authority. 
  [BILD AM SONNTAG] Before being appointed public prosecutor 
you were a judge in the 4th Senate at the Federal High Court of 
Justice. This court is also in charge of the road traffic law, 
and you are considered an expert in this field. Are you in 
favor of changing the blood alcohol limit and of a general speed 
limit? 
  [Nehm] Introducing a 0.5 per mille alcohol limit throughout 
Germany would have been the right compromise after unification. 
The higher the alcohol content, the lower the rate of reaction. 
This has not only been scientifically proven, but it also makes 
sense to any nonspecialist. That is why I consider the 
introduction of a 0.5 per mille limit to be necessary and 
sensible in the interest of all road users. As far as the speed 
limit is concerned, there is no doubt: A general speed limit 
would increase the capacity of our roads and make traffic run 
more smoothly.

<F P=106> [Einar Koch report: "Mafia: Confidential Report Shocks </F>
Bonn; BKA: In One in Three Cases of Organized Crime a Civil 
Servant Is Involved"] 
  [Text] We were afraid of that.... 
  Organized crime is irresistibly infiltrating our 
authorities. 
  In construction offices, foreigners' offices, offices 
responsible for imposing fines -- everywhere there are bribes 
and cover-ups. 
  In a confidential report the Federal Office of Criminal 
Investigations [BKA] warns: One in three investigations into 
"organized crime" is aimed against corrupt officials. 
  BKA President Hans-Ludwig Zachert says in this confidential 
analysis: "For a long time we used to look down arrogantly on 
the bakshish mentality in other countries. Corruption was a 
phenomenon that was primarily associated with other cultures. 
There is no longer any reason for this smug indifference." 
  The worst cases came from the reports of the land offices 
for 
criminal investigations: 

  -  At the Russian military airport of 
Sperenberg in Brandenburg police seized 10,000 smuggled guns 
("Makarovs"). Thirty of the guns seized were stolen -- by a 
young criminal police officer with connections with the 
mafia. 
  -  In Munich a five-man special commission is investigating 
employees of construction and planning offices, who reportedly 
received several 100,000 German marks [DM] in bribes for orders 
involving purification plants; 66 of the accused have been 
sentenced to prison terms totalling 94 years and fined DM1.5 
million. 
  -  The Bavarian Land Office for Criminal Investigations is 
currently investigating another 49 officials; 53 investigations 
have already been concluded. 
  -  In Hesse, 1,400 employees of 
authorities have been investigated for corruption over the past 
five years. 
  -  In Frankfurt an employee of the Social Welfare 
Office granted a total of DM3 million of unwarranted social 
welfare to 80 Czechs. 
  -  In Hamburg 18 employees of the foreigners' 
office are being investigated for allegedly issuing almost any 
stamp or any permit in return for cash. 
  BKA Chief Zachert warns of a "morass": "We must dry it up 
before it is too late."

  [Text] In the view of Social Democratic Party of Germany 
[SPD] defense expert, Erwin Horn, Defense Minister Volker Ruehe 
(Christian Democratic Union --CDU) will have to close down some 
of the Bundeswehr's facilities. Talking to BILD AM SONNTAG, 
Horn said: "Urged by the government coalition, the defense 
minister seems to be planning to cheat the voters. He says that 
all the garrisons will be maintained, even if the Bundeswehr is 
cut down in forces. But in fact, under the Ruehe concept there 
will be several barracks where there will only be uniformed 
caretakers left, who will maintain the buildings. These 
facilities will, of course, no longer be used for military 
purposes. The full truth will not emerge until after the 
Bundestag elections, when a number of barracks will be closed 
down for cost reasons." 
  Horn demands: "The tasks of the Bundeswehr have to be 
clearly defined now, so that the army can be made smaller and 
more efficient." The SPD politician is offering to cooperate on 
this matter: "I will support the CDU minister in this honest 
and important task, even if his concept includes closing down 
several garrisons. But the voters must be told the truth before 
polling day!"

<F P=106> [Hans-Werner Loose report: "Criticism of Hashish Release"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn -- The decision of the FRG Constitutional 
Court in Karlsruhe no longer to make the use of small amounts of 
hashish and marijuana a punishable offense has given rise to 
harsh reactions from politicians and society. Above all, 
politicians of the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] and the 
Christian Social Union [CSU] criticized the decision. Doctors 
and criminal police officers also fear that the wrong 
conclusions might be drawn from the decision. Approval came 
from the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]. 
  State Secretary Eduard Lintner (CSU), drug commissioner of 
the Federal Government, sees "a danger that the state will 
suffer a setback in the struggle against drugs." The Karlsruhe 
ruling is "a wrong signal and a hard blow to all our efforts for 
prevention, which I have to overcome," Lintner told DIE WELT. 
  Angela Merkel (CDU), minister of women and youth, fears 
"that 
young people now think that hashish is permitted and believe it 
is not any more harmful than a filter cigarette." Mrs. Merkel 
told DIE WELT: "Hashish and marijuana are and remain entrance 
drugs, whose danger is played down far too often." 
  Karsten Vilmar, president of the Federal Doctors' Chamber, 
warned against drawing the wrong conclusion from the ruling. It 
might give rise to the impression that hashish is harmless and 
therefore be made generally available. 
  Eckart Fiedler, manager of the Association of Employees' 
Health Insurance Companies, fears "cost increases, which we have 
to pass on to the 27 million people insured with us." Fiedler 
told DIE WELT that the ruling "runs counter to the 
responsibility to promote health and undermines our efforts." 
He demands "to continue the massive struggle against entrance 
drugs." 
  The Federation of German Criminal Police Officers (BDK) 
think 
that "the path embarked upon here" leads "in the end to the 
complete release of all drugs and the addiction of broad strata 
of the population, in particular young people." Says the BDK: 
"If all problems with which the rule-of-law state is unable to 
cope were dealt with in this way, break-ins would soon have to 
be exempt from punishment, too." 
  In contrast, Kurt Weidmann, parliamentary manager of the 
Hesse SPD Landtag groups, said that the decision of Karlsruhe is 
an "important contribution and courageous step toward 
decriminalization." 
  The Federal Office of Criminal Investigations [BKA] in 
Wiesbaden does not see a change, even though statistics indicate 
this trend: 1,738 drug deaths in 1993 -- 361 fewer than in 
1992; 14,346 first consumers of hard drugs -- 1,296 fewer than 
in 1992; 1,095 kg of heroin seized -- 143 kg less than in 1992; 
11,352 kg of cannabis products seized -- 814 kg less than in 
1992. However, the trend this year is going upward again. 
  Because of the high figure of unknown incidents, the BKA is 
certain: "Drugs are available on the German drug market in 
sufficient quantities." 
  The drug experts in Wiesbaden know: "Small-scale smuggling 
from the Netherlands to Germany continues unabated." The fast 
trains from The Hague via Venlo to Duisburg or the Eurocity 
train "Piet Mondrian" from Amsteradam via Emmerich to Cologne 
have long been called "Hashish Express." Last year 620 kg of 
hashish and 56 kg of marijuana were seized at the Dutch-German 
border. Cannabis can be bought legally for 10 gilders per gram 
in any of the 1,365 "coffeeshops," which have an annual turnover 
of 600 million marks. 
  The Justice Ministry in The Hague welcomes the ruling of the 
German Constitutional Court: "We are in favor of coordinating 
the policy of the various countries as much as possible."

<F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Manfred Kanther by </F>
Klaus-Peter Siegloch on 1 May; in the Mainz studio -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Siegloch] This ruling [by the Constitutional 
Court about making the use of small amounts of hashish and 
marijuana not punishable by law] has been criticized by a 
particularly great number of politicians from the Christian 
Democratic Union/Christian Social Union. So far, you have not 
said anything. Do you agree with it? 
  [Kanther] One should comment on a ruling as soon as one has 
read it in its entirety. I note that this debate is going on 
without anybody having read it in its entirety, because the most 
important item of the ruling is the confirmation that the use of 
all drugs, including cannabis products, is punishable by law. 
The motions brought by administrative courts against that have 
been rejected by the Federal Constitutional Court. 
  Then there is the statement, which has not yet been 
detailed, 
that in individual cases, where the possession of small amounts 
of drugs is involved, punishment can be ignored. This is 
nothing new, this is already legal practice now. 
  This has led to a political debate about the question of 
releasing hashish for general consumption. I think this debate 
is disastrous. Hashish must not be generally available. The 
Federal Government is completely clear on that. I will 
certainly not say today the opposite of what I said last week. 
The inhibition thresholds for drug consumption, in particular 
among young people, must not be lowered but must be kept high. 
  [Siegloch] Mr. Kanther, this is your political view. 
However, the ruling -- or at least that part which has been 
published so far -- sounds as if this offense remains punishable 
but is no longer prosecuted. This gives the message to the 
public that now practically anyone can use hashish, one just 
must not deal with hashish. 
  [Kanther] I think that this message is dangerous. I do not 
criticize an individual ruling by the Constitutional Court here. 
I say that this is not the policy of the Federal Government. 
The Federal Government's policy is quite clear -- making any 
kind of trafficking and possession of any kind of drugs 
punishable by law, while knowing that, given the frequency of 
drug abuse, it is impossible to punish every single case, and, 
in particular in the case of possession for one's own 
consumption, punishment need not be imposed because there are 
other forms of education and help and social or educational 
influence on the addicts. All this -- this social and 
educational aspect -- is undisputed. However, in the end the 
possession and dealing with drugs must remain punishable.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Karlsruhe: Hashish Consumption </F>
Publishable"] 
  [Text] The Constitutional Court has issued a kind of 
commentary about its own ruling on hashish. It described as 
"groundless" reports that it had approved the consumption of 
hashish. The Court explained that it had declared the ban on 
drugs and all drug-related offenses to be in keeping with the 
constitution. However, lenient sentences may be applied to 
minor offenses. The Court further explained: "Law-enforcement 
bodies must in principle discontinue with prosecution if hashish 
is only consumed in small quantities for private consumption, 
and without danger to third parties." The Court considers terms 
such as "free of punishment" or "approval" to be wrong, because 
in a legal sense, the consumption of hashish and marijuana 
remains punishable. The Court has merely forbidden the 
prosecution of petty consumers of hashish in certain 
circumstances; therefore, in ordinary language, such persons 
remain free of punishment.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "West German Economic Situation </F>
Undergoes Broad Improvement"] 
  [Text] For the first time in 20 months, the HANDELSBLATT 
economic trend indicator for May suggests positive economic 
growth. It also reveals a 0.2 percent improvement against April. 
In April, the indicator displayed a 0.1 percent fall in 
economic growth, a decrease of 0.3 points. Compared with May 
1993, economic growth was 1.4 points higher. 
  This latest development permits the conclusion that the west 
German economy has overcome the recession and will embark upon a 
path of growth in the summer. If the positive trend of the past 
few months continues, a 1.5 percent increase in the GNP should 
be achieved in 1994. 
  May also appears a good month regarding the extent of the 
signs of improvement. All six individual growth figures given 
in the indicator have improved, most of them considerably. 
  The structure of interest rates has again normalized 
following an uninterrupted fall since December 1990. In March, 
capital market interest rates were 0.36 percent points higher 
than short-term rates for three-month money deposits. 
  After boosting exports in previous months, the positive 
economic signals now seem to be boosting domestic demand. In 
February, the processing industry registered a 2.3 percent 
increase in demand against January. 
  In January, the construction industry enjoyed a veritable 
leap in demand as orders increased by over 10 percent compared 
with December, which in itself was quite a good month. 
  Retail trade turnover, always a reliable indicator of 
private 
consumption in recent months, in February saw a 1-percent growth 
against January. 
  In the meantime, the traffic lights of exports have settled 
on green. In February, foreign orders for the processing 
industries increased by 3.8 percent against January. 
  The Institute for Economic Research's exports surveys for 
enterprises are becoming increasingly optimistic. In March, the 
number of enterprises expecting further improvement over the 
next three months leapt from 14.2 percent in February to 15.6 
percent. The business climate in the processing industry also 
improved from minus 18.7 percent in February to minus 12.5 
percent in March.

<F P=106> [Interview with Umberto Bossi, Italian Northern League </F>
Secretary, by Guido Passalacqua on 26 April; place not given: 
"Let Us Not Split the Country in Two"] 
  [Text] Milan -- On "Milano, Italia" after the great 25 
April [Liberation Day] rally, Umberto Bossi met with Achille 
Ochetto [Democratic Party of the Left Secretary]. The League 
leader very much wanted this meeting to take place, but it was 
long delayed, and the event was characterized by a tone of 
political detente. This evening Bossi returns to Rome to 
negotiate the composition of the next government and related 
guarantees with [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi and [National 
Alliance leader] Fini. Bossi is offering himself as guarantor 
of the rights of the opposition within the majority coalition. 
On the basis of such a role, he is planning to win a major 
success in the negotiations: the granting to the League of the 
Interior Ministry, a key position for averting public 
disturbances. 
  [Passalacqua] Mr. Bossi, how did you feel 25 April amid the 
catcalls and insults? 
  [Bossi] On the way there I knew how things would turn out. 
On the one hand, there was the anger and dissatisfaction of 
those who lost the elections and who were reacting because they 
were dissatisfied, and, on the other, there was a kind of 
appeal, a love-hate relationship. 
  [Passalacqua] That is your interpretation of the insults.... 
  [Bossi] What other meaning could there be to their shouts of 
"traitor" if not hatred and love? For me that rally was a 
political experience. 
  [Passalacqua] What is the status of the League after 25 
April? 
  [Bossi] The League is the same as before, a movement of the 
common people. Certainly not a right-wing movement, a center 
movement. The League constitutes the reformist part within the 
pole for freedom. 
  [Passalacqua] Is this the message that you intended to 
convey 
by attending the rally? 
  [Bossi] I wanted to indicate that the League believes in the 
principle of freedom, even when it is a historical memory. 
  [Passalacqua] But politically.... 
  [Bossi] We stressed the substantial difference that exists 
between the League and the other political forces that comprise 
the pole, which must govern because it won the elections -- 
because this country must have a government. We attended the 
rally, accepting all the dynamics that can occur in such a great 
rally, in a celebration which has always been managed by the 
Left and in which people saw the League joining the defense of 
the battle that we waged against the system of party domination, 
as a battle similar in kind to that waged by the partisans. 
  [Passalacqua] Was it a provocation, in the best sense of the 
word? 
  [Bossi] We participated in the event. But some people felt 
provoked: It was not our intention to provoke, but people 
perceived our presence almost as something sacrilegious. But 
how did people respond? With both love and hatred, because 
everyone knows that the League is not fascist. 
  [Passalacqua] Some people interpret both your attendance at 
the rally and your debate with Occhetto as the start of a 
flirtation between the League and the Left. 
  [Bossi] We are experiencing a situation in which things are 
unclear. We have a first-past-the-post electoral system which 
tends to divide the political spectrum into two poles. But the 
fact is that it is impossible to divide it into two, even if 
this is what the election results say: The first-past-the-post 
system should exclude the losers from a whole range of 
opportunities which were hitherto shared among all the parties, 
in accordance with the rationale of consociation. It is not 
easy to move onto something new; there is no magic wand. To 
say, "Winner takes all," could be dangerous because those who 
are excluded could take politics into the streets. A 
confrontation could result, if mediation proved impossible or if 
no willingness were displayed to perform at least some mediation 
in parliament. 
  [Passalacqua] So this is the League's new role. 
  [Bossi] The capacity for mediation and centrality; in other 
words, to democratize the Right, and to liberalize the Left. 
  [Passalacqua] Speaking with Occhetto, you stressed the 
League's role as guarantor and mediator with respect to the 
progressive opposition. Is there a rapprochement. 
  [Bossi] It was a public explanation, an important 
explanation. We had not spoken for three or four months. And I 
also consider it important that we were there at the rally while 
Fini was in church and Berlusconi was at home. 
  [Passalacqua] Occhetto explicitly asked you to provide a 
guarantee of democracy for the opposition forces with regard to 
your role within the majority. 
  [Bossi] We must talk not in terms of spoils sharing, but in 
terms of areas -- for instance, with regard to RAI [state radio 
and television service], the Anti-Mafia Committee, and the 
watchdog committees. The danger of the opposition's being 
nullified is normal in countries where the first-past-the-post 
system is established; here it is not normal. 
  [Passalacqua] What inviolable barriers are there with 
respect 
to your allies? 
  [Bossi] With regard to the National Alliance, we say "no" to 
any resurgence of fascism. 
  [Passalacqua] What about the next prime minister? 
  [Bossi] It is impossible to accept the idea of a prime 
minister that at the time of the establishment of the new 
government assigns himself a temporary role as interior 
minister: That reminds me of Benito Mussolini. 
  [Passalacqua] So is the first barrier the Interior Ministry? 
  [Bossi] It is certainly the most delicate issue at present. 
  [Passalacqua] What if Forza Italia and the National Alliance 
do not accept your suggestion of a League member as interior 
minister, as guarantor and mediator with respect to the 
opposition forces. What will happen then? 
  [Bossi] Why do you want to make me fight right away? I say 
that they will have to give me clear and convincing 
explanations. It is an important issue and deserves immediate 
attention. The alternative is to separate local government from 
the Interior Ministry. But it is Berlusconi's powers that are 
the real problem. 
  [Passalacqua] Powers even outside the government, such as 
his 
role as a businessman.... 
  [Bossi] I do not say that a businessman cannot engage in 
politics, but I do emphasize with regret that there is no 
antimonopoly law in this country. 
  [Passalacqua] Is this the watchdog that is being discussed? 
  [Bossi] But who will monitor the watchdog? It is the 
ordinary judiciary that can constitute the sole guarantor. The 
real guarantee is for the League to control certain ministries 
-- the Treasury Ministry, which holds the purse strings, and the 
Interior Ministry. This is the political guarantee; the other 
is the monopolies committee. 
  [Passalacqua] What can you say about the Mediobanca 
[Financial Credit Bank] affair? 
  [Bossi] I am worried: Mediobanca is one of the country's 
masters.

<F P=106> [Interview with Gianfranci Fini, Italian National Alliance </F>
secretary, by Bruno Vespa in Rome on 25 April: "Fini: `Nothing 
To Do With Mussolini'"] 
  [Excerpts] Rome -- [passage omitted] [Vespa] What did this 
date [25 April] mean for him in past years. 
  [Fini] April 25 is the date when the end of the war is 
remembered. Historically, it is right to interpret it in this 
way rather than as the day when one side prevailed over the 
other. April 25 was not the end of the civil war. It was the 
end of the war. 
  [Vespa] Have you ever considered it a day of celebration for 
the "others"? 
  [Fini] At times, yes. In the recent past, yes. 
  [Vespa] How did it feel? 
  [Fini] Anything but pleasant. I was saddened by the fact 
that after so many years there was still in Italy a desire to 
maintain certain barriers of discrimination and hatred. 
  [Vespa] The "National Alliance manifesto" states that there 
is no need to rewrite history. However, the impression could be 
gained that there is a desire to level out history, to set all 
historical events on the same plane.... 
  [Fini] No, history cannot be leveled out, nor can it be 
rewritten. History does not embody two versions of the truth. 
The fact is that ever since the time of Julius Caesar history 
has been written on the basis of the principles of the winners. 
Remember? Vae victis: Woe to the defeated.... Instead, 
history should be written solely on the basis of historical 
fact. However, we cannot expect this task to be performed by 
politicians, especially at a time such as this, when there is a 
Left that is trying to exploit 25 April as an opportunity to 
recoup for the results of the recent general election. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Vespa] You talk as a political leader. But do all your 
followers think the same way? 
  [Fini] Yes. Or, at least, the fringes on the Right that do 
not want reconciliation are in a tiny minority. 
  [Vespa] What do you feel about the nostalgia of some 
youngsters who did not experience fascism and the civil war but 
who identify with fascism or even Nazism? 
  [Fini] If you are referring to the so-called Nazi-skins, I 
condemn them absolutely, with no hypocrisy and no attempt to 
understand or justify them. 
  [Vespa] How much importance do these people have within your 
party and your movement, among your voters? 
  [Fini] None. 
  [Vespa] What do they expect from you? 
  [Fini] I think that they hate me sometimes. [Fini ends] 
  I reminded Fini of the sad episode the other day in Genoa. A 
schoolgirl went to see "Schindler's List," Spielberg's 
extraordinary movie about the deportation and extermination of 
the Jews. Some youngsters started laughing, mocking the Jews, 
and some sang Nazi-fascist songs. This prompted two girls to 
walk out, for which they were suspended by their principal, 
because they had not been authorized to leave the theater. This 
latter aspect of the episode was given wide coverage in the 
press. But I asked Fini whether he was not disturbed by the 
former aspect, namely, the fact that some of our children feel 
no dismay or compassion about one of the most ghastly tragedies 
in history. This question too elicited a laconic reply. 
  [Fini] It shows that youngsters must be taught history. But 
this must not be done in such a way that history appears like 
propaganda, still less so in such a way that it becomes a 
subject of everyday political struggle. 
  [Vespa] Are you convinced that there is only one history 
that 
can be told? 
  [Fini] History must be told in accordance with the facts. 
  [Vespa] How many years must pass before 25 April really 
becomes a day of celebration for everyone? 
  [Fini] We hope that next time, which will also be the 50th 
anniversary of the end of the war, it will be the 25 April of 
reconciliation. 
  [Vespa] What will you do in the months ahead to ensure that 
this happens? 
  [Fini] We will continue with a series of initiatives 
designed 
to make people understand the reasons for a reconciliation. 
Keep in mind that I am not talking simply about the calm 
detachment that the historian must have with regard to events 
that took place half a century ago. Reconciliation is a 
practical matter, too, and should be expressed through 
ceremonies in which everyone can pay tribute to the fallen. 
There also must be an elimination of all the discriminations 
that now separate the victors from the vanquished. For instance, 
how many people know that in Italy the partisans were rightly 
granted the title of fighters, whereas the same status was 
denied to the soldiers of the Social Republic? They were denied 
the same rights, even though they were soldiers too, just like 
those of the other side. 
  [Vespa] Should the fact of having been on what historically 
has been defined as the wrong side have certain consequences? 
  [Fini] No, it should not have any consequences, because in a 
democracy it is the voters alone who judge merits with regard to 
becoming government forces or not. It cannot be historians. 
And I am entirely convinced that the vote at the end of March 
(including the large vote for the National Alliance) was not a 
vote for a return to the past, for an apologia of fascism. It 
was a vote for change, precisely because the Italian people now 
realize that there is no longer a fascist threat. I disagree 
with the theory propounded by the German historian Nolte, that 
the National Alliance could give rise to a soft form of fascism, 
a democratic form of fascism. Fascism was born, lived, and died 
with its founder, Benito Mussolini. Today the National Alliance 
is a modern, European Right. A social Right that certainly 
expects respect for history, but that certainly does not 
represent a continuation of fascism and neofascism. [Fini ends] 
  This is the first time that Fini has broached these issues 
analytically. It is the first time that he has replied to 
Nolte, the most authoritative living expert on Nazism, arguing 
the arbitrariness of asserting even the remotest connection 
between nostalgia for the black shirts and the vote in March 
that will bring the MSI [Italian Social Movement] into the 
government for the first time in Republican Italy. Fini was 
flippant on the subject of the gestures and significant dates of 
the dictatorship. When I asked him what he does when he sees 
the fascist salute, he said that he replies with a quip. And 
when a sound engineer, placing his microphone ready for a 
television interview, told him that he too was born 3 January 
and I observed that it is an embarrassing date for a birthday, 
Fini explained to him that it was on 3 January 1925 that fascism 
became a totalitarian regime, with Mussolini's famous speech in 
the "deaf and gray chamber." 
  "Don't worry," he added. "No important acts by the new 
government can take place on 3 January, or on 28 October." 
  We went down to the bar. Fini picked up the tab. 
  [Vespa] How are your finances? 
  [Fini] Good: The 5 million votes earned us a reimbursement 
of 8 billion lire from the state. Further funds will come from 
the European elections. We must manage the money well; it has 
to last some years, because the annual funding of the parties is 
over. Nevertheless, we are confident. Do you know how many 
employees we have throughout Italy? A mere 40. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Giovanni Spadolini, former Senate Speaker, </F>
by Giovanni Valentini in Rome; date not given: "Spadolini, 
Champion of the Rules"] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- [passage omitted] [Valentini] From your 
special vantage point at Palazzo Madama [Senate], how have you 
viewed Italian politics over the past seven years? 
  [Spadolini] In 1987 I passed from a position in the 
political 
battle, as a party secretary, to the position of an impartial 
arbiter, which is what the Senate speakership is, or, rather, 
should be. An arbiter during some very exciting years. It was 
a sharp break, a new way of approaching issues. A radical 
change of lifestyle, of outlook -- approaching every issue in 
accordance with my impartial role, at the very time when the 
crisis of the parties became more acute, the system of party 
domination became more invasive, and corruption -- which I 
condemned back at the time of P-2 [outlawed Masonic lodge] -- 
grew worse. 
  [Valentini] What is your personal and political assessment 
of 
this experience? 
  [Spadolini] It is the assessment of someone who never 
adapted 
to the patterns of what is now being called the "First 
Republic," though that is a misleading term. I realized the 
need for innovation and consistently devoted myself to modifying 
parliamentary rules during the 10th legislative period. I also 
broached the issue of the reform of the Senate, the first 
example in Italian history of an assembly correcting itself. 
  [Valentini] What could the Senate role be in the future? 
Some people argue that it should become the Chamber of the 
Regions.... 
  [Spadolini] Under my speakership, there was a debate on the 
rationalization of relations between the two houses, in which 
the theory of so-called procedural bicameralism prevailed. That 
is, the theory that envisages a limited number of necessarily 
bicameral laws and, apart from that, an acceleration of the 
progress of bills through parliament by means of "silent 
assent." I see that there is talk now about major 
simplifications and major innovations in the Senate too, which 
depends on its traditions. Well, there are hundreds of acts of 
the Constitutional Affairs Committee to be assessed. There are 
the conclusions of the Bicameral Committee on Institutional 
Reforms, including the idea of increasing the powers of regional 
government, without the Senate's becoming something like 
Germany's Bundesrat, since Italy is not a federal state. What 
is certain is that it will not be necessary to start from 
scratch. Nothing in history is invented. 
  [Valentini] What role do you intend to assume now? Will you 
be leader of the opposition in the Senate? 
  [Spadolini] No. Leader of the constitution. I intend to be 
the leader of the forces that identify with a sincere and 
profound constitutional reformism, but without overturning or 
disrupting the Constitution. This, always within a European 
outlook: the Italian nation as part of the European nation. 
  [Valentini] Does that mean that you are opposed to any 
institutional revision? 
  [Spadolini] There has always been confusion between the 
commitment to institutional revision -- concerning the form of 
government -- and an outright subversion of the form of the 
state. The former path can be pursued; the latter cannot. It is 
one thing to talk about a parliamentary, presidential, or 
semi-presidential republic, or one based on a chancellorship. 
It is quite another matter to question the form of the state. 
There must be no ambiguities about this. There is only one 
republic and it is indivisible. The same applies to the 
fundamental principles of the first articles of the Constitution. 
  [Valentini] But the new majority does intend to modify it, 
by 
means of the twofold reading by the two houses, as envisaged by 
Article 138. How legitimate do you think this is? 
  [Spadolini] Article 138 originated under the proportional 
system. Under a first-past-the-post system there should have 
been, and there must be, more guarantees. It was a mistake not 
to have provided them. Be that as it may, as things stand, any 
modification of the Constitution must take place through 
scrupulous observance of the constitutional charter. And that 
includes Article 138. 
  [Valentini] Can the government alignment do this on its own, 
by dint of parliamentary votes? 
  [Spadolini] Any plan for the reform of the Constitution must 
necessarily be the result of a debate that cannot be confined to 
the narrow parameters of a majority. No coups d'etat. The 
Constitution is an asset belonging to the entire country, to the 
forces of both the majority and the opposition. The ideal forum 
within which to develop institutional reforms is parliament. 
And that alone. 
  [Valentini] But on the basis of the new first-past-the-post 
system, the winning alignment is claiming the right to decide 
autonomously. 
  [Spadolini] Let us be clear about this: When we refer to 
the first-past-the-post system, we do so entirely incorrectly. 
The first-past-the-post system presupposes the presence of 
consistent and compact forces that sought votes in order to 
govern together. Here we have a completely different kind of 
alliance. Three parties brought together with all kinds of 
reservations which are tantamount to differences, contrasting 
stances, and splits, some of them deep. The first events on the 
parliamentary agenda will show us whether a numerical majority 
-- which does not even exist in the Senate -- also constitutes a 
political majority. This is the real test. 
  [Valentini] You have always been a defender of national 
unity. Do you think that the plan for federalism put forward by 
the League could jeopardize our country's identity? 
  [Spadolini] I have not yet seen any federalist blueprint 
worthy of the name. I have seen scribbles, notes, and 
fragments. If anything, I have seen a confederal-type plan 
which outlines a voluntary association of independent states. 
This negates the first and second Risorgimento. 
  [Valentini] With regard to presidentialism, some support the 
direct election of the chief of state, while others advocate 
that of the prime minister. What do you think is the most 
efficient solution for ensuring greater governability? 
  [Spadolini] The presidential republic is an entirely 
respectable idea. But I think that the German system of the 
chancellor is preferable, the best antidote to the instability 
of governments. The direct election of the prime minister, 
however, could bring about a situation in which the prime 
minister elected directly by the people is not matched by an 
adequate and corresponding parliamentary majority, with all the 
easily imagined problems that this would entail. I would call 
this quite irresponsible. 
  [Valentini] Having been defeated by a single vote [for 
Senate 
speakership], do you consider yourself the first victim of the 
Second Republic? 
  [Spadolini] I do not consider myself defeated at all. I did 
not want to win, either by one vote or by five. I merely 
accepted the idea of an agreement on my candidacy on the part of 
the future government parties and the future opposition parties 
-- what is known as an institutional majority. There was no 
majority in the Senate. So it is very rash to regard the Senate 
on the same basis as the lower house. We tried to avert a 
laceration (or something even worse) and were successful. Now I 
am regaining complete freedom of action and resuming the same 
civilized battle that I have always waged. 
  [Valentini] In this transition from old to new, do you not 
think nevertheless that you have disregarded the fact that you 
represented the previous system? 
  [Spadolini] But what is new? I am not a professional 
politician; I did not emerge from any apparatus. I joined the 
Senate at the age of 47, as an independent within the Italian 
Republican Party, having made my way in life through my 
historical research and journalism. It takes some nerve for 
those who, out of respect for the system of party domination, 
are deciding everything -- even whether or not a ministry should 
be subdivided (what a mistake to think of splitting the Interior 
Ministry in two!) -- behind closed doors, for them to talk in 
terms of "the new." The so-called First Republic -- an 
expression that I do not like -- never went that far. No, quite 
frankly, I really do feel that I represent the new. 
  [Valentini] Will it prove possible to correct the electoral 
law? Which would be better: a plain single-candidate system or 
two rounds? 
  [Spadolini] I am in favor of two rounds, which would 
facilitate the establishment of homogeneous majorities and 
enable the people's will to be fully expressed, within the 
complexity of our political life. A plain single-candidate 
system presupposes an entirely different history. It should be 
pondered extremely carefully before adopting it. 
  [Valentini] In recent days you have been mentioned as a 
possible guarantor, or super-guarantor, to be set alongside the 
next prime minister.... 
  [Spadolini] Yes, the newspapers have spoken about it. I have 
received no proposals in this regard, and I would not even have 
discussed them unless they had been accompanied by adequate 
instruments. Be that as it may, there is an issue regarding the 
private television companies owned by the prime 
minister-designate, and no one should think that it can be 
avoided by means of humorous rejoinders.

  [Excerpts] Some 4,000 marines landed in the Spanish port of 
Cadiz for a NATO exercise that has former Yugoslavia as a 
backdrop. The exercise entitled Resolute Response [preceding 
name in English] is under the command of Iberlant [Iberian 
Atlantic Command] in Oeiras near Lisbon. The future of Iberlant 
is somewhat uncertain. Cid Saldanha reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Saldanha] About 4,000 NATO marines landed 
in the Bay of Cadiz today for one stage in the exercise Resolute 
Response, which involves 90 ships, 250 planes, and more than 
35,000 staff. [passage omitted] For Admiral Carmo Duro, 
commander in chief of Iberlant, this exercise demonstrates the 
importance of this Iberian command in the Atlantic, but as 
Renascenca has learned, the future of Iberlant is somewhat 
uncertain. Everything is still being studied, but it is highly 
likely that the Oeiras headquarters will be transferred to the 
NATO European command, SACEUR [Supreme Allied Commander, Europe]. 
  [Duro] Last year it appeared that Iberlant would not 
disappear as a headquarters under someone else's control. I 
believe this national objective must be preserved. It was 
public knowledge last year that the objective was to increase 
Iberlant's area and put it under the European command. 
  [Saldanha] In addition to this possibility, it is almost 
certain that the Iberlant command will no longer be the 
exclusive responsibility of the Navy and it will rotate among 
the other branches. Another possibility is the simple 
extinction of Iberlant as a major subordinate NATO command 
[preceding two words in English] in the Atlantic. 
  [Duro] If it is decided to end within NATO with the [word 
indistinct] of the Atlantic, then this headquarter's role will 
be different. If there is a rotation between the three branches 
of the Armed Forces here, I believe it will be to command 
Portuguese forces, almost exclusively. 
  [Saldanha] In this case there would be a reduction of 
Portugal's influence in NATO. It is the old war between 
Atlantic and European commands -- in other words, the tug-of-war 
between Washington and Brussels with Portugal on the Atlantic 
border. [end recording]

  [Text] Prime Minister Cavaco Silva gave a dinner in honor 
of the prime minister of Luxembourg this evening. Their 
speeches were marked by agreement regarding Europe. Cavaco 
Silva advocated a plural Europe respecting the various cultures. 
  [Cavaco Silva] "We need a strong, ambitious Europe, able to 
act. But it will also have to show solidarity and cohesion. In 
order to maintain its dynamism, the European project cannot run 
the risk of distancing itself from public opinion. Europe has 
been built on and has become richer through recognition and 
respect for the different national identities and traditions. 
It is a formula that has served us well in the past and that no 
doubt will do so in the future." 
  [Announcer] The prime minister of Luxembourg agreed with 
Cavaco Silva. Jacques Santer advocated a Europe without small 
and large. 
  [Santer, in French with superimposed Portuguese translation] 
"It is as much in Portugal's interest as in Luxembourg's to 
prevent an institutional detour between the large, small, or 
medium-sized member states. The equality of all countries, be 
it regarding the composition of the European Commission, be it 
the rotating presidency of the Council or the right to vote, is 
as fundamental to us as it is to Portugal."

  [Text] Castellon -- Jose Maria Cuevas, president of the 
CEOE [Spanish Confederation of Employers Organizations], stated 
yesterday, in Castellon, that the Spanish economy has suffered 
the consequences of a misguided policy, although he acknowledged 
that the "side effects" of the "correction of the wrong course" 
are beginning to be felt. 
  Cuevas noted that a slight recovery of the economy is 
perceptible, owing to the rebound in other countries and the 
lowering of interest rates in Spain. This change, he said, 
"stems more from a recycling of those who implemented the 
misguided policy than from a change in the attitude of the 
business community." 
  The CEOE's president announced that its primary objective in 
this year's round of collective bargaining will be to slow the 
increase in unemployment; the objective must not be wage 
increases. He pledged that the CEOE will try to "break the 
dynamic" of meeting cost increases by reducing staff. This, he 
said, will make wage moderation indispensable. 
  The Ministry of Economy, for its part, asserts that the 
economic recovery is taking root as the year progresses, 
although during 1994 the recovery will be based solely on 
exports, since the growth of consumption and investment can be 
expected to remain practically flat. 
  The Ministry's most recent report on the economic situation 
states that "the signs of a rebound, particularly an industrial 
one, are increasing, while the resurgence of domestic demand is 
lagging somewhat. This lag is related to the slow return of 
confidence on the part of the economic operators." 
  It adds: "This initial lag is to be considered normal, in 
that it reproduces the patterns the Spanish economy has followed 
in past recoveries from crises."

<F P=106> [Article by R. de Querol] </F>
  [Text] Minister of Economy and Finance Pedro Solbes stated 
yesterday that "the payment of pensions in the future is fully 
guaranteed," although he stressed that changes will be necessary 
to "strengthen" the public system of Social Security. 
  In his remarks to the Congress of Deputies, the minister 
thus 
contested the controversy that has ensued from his previous 
statements in which he warned that the pension system will be 
threatened in 20 to 30 years. 
  Stating that his words on that occasion had not been well 
understood, the minister emphasized that a public pension system 
similar to the present one will continue to exist in the future. 
He advocated the maintaining of the financial system of 
distributions (in which the workers' current contributions 
finance current pensions), although this system "can be 
supplemented by elements of capitalization," thus guaranteeing, 
in his opinion, "solidarity among people, groups, and 
generations." 
  Solbes also promised that the Social Security benefits will 
retain their purchasing power independently of the existence of 
private systems that may provide pensioners with additional 
income. 
  The minister of the economy dwelt on the need to begin 
"addressing seriously and responsibly a problem that, if nothing 
is done, could arise in 20 or 30 years." 
  The future reform of the Social Security System, he added, 
will not bring into question the present system, but on the 
contrary will strengthen it. In his remarks, Pedro Solbes 
reproached the opposition groups with their "catastrophic views, 
which alarm people here and now," and urged that pursuit of the 
debate be "sober-minded." To this end, the Congress's Committee 
for the Economy appointed an ad hoc subcommittee to initiate 
studies on the future of the Social Security System. 
  The deputies of the PP [People's Party] and IU [United Left] 
criticized Solbes harshly for "creating social alarm concerning 
the future of pensions." Cristobal Montoro, PP spokesman, 
accused the minister of "acting like a pyromaniac" for having 
put in question the pensions of future retirees. In Montoro's 
opinion, the problem is not a demographic one, but rather stems 
from the low employment and high unemployment rates, which 
reduce total contributions. Montoro pointed out that a sizable 
number of pensions "amount to poverty levels." 
  Pedro Antonio Rius, of the IU, reproached the government 
with 
"intent to dismantle the welfare state's most important 
package." According to Rius, the debate that has been opened 
regarding pensions obeys the "strategy" of an executive branch 
in which "accountants hold sway over the defenders of ideas." 
The pension system is strong, he said, and continues to be 
strong "if the government sees to it that there is employment." 
Francesc Homs, of CiU [Convergence and Union] termed the economy 
minister's initiative timely, because all of Europe has opened a 
debate on social welfare.

<F P=106> [M. Abizanda report: "Defense Ministry Rejects U.S. Offer </F>
for Purchase of 40 F-16 Aircraft"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- The Defense Ministry has responded in the 
negative to the U.S. offer for the purchase of at least 40 F-16 
fighter bombers at a unit price of 1 billion pesetas. The 
Defense Ministry believes that the purchase of those aircraft, 
despite their good price, would entail further expenditure since 
this is a new weapons system, especially with respect to 
providing maintenance for these fighter-bombers. 
  As ABC has already reported, the U.S. authorities offered 
the 
Defense Ministry a batch of their model "A" and "B" F-16's -- 
the oldest -- from their surpluses. These aircraft, built in 
the late seventies, have been decommissioned or are on service 
with the National Guard, as a result of the reduction of 
aircraft in the U.S. Air Force and because they are surpassed in 
their features by the "C" and "D" series F-16's. According to 
sources consulted by this newspaper, the United States also 
offered A-10 Thunderbolt ground attack aircraft. 
  Although the two types of aircraft -- both the F-16's, with 
certain modernizations carried out in Spain, and the A-10's -- 
would have met one of the Air Force's chief needs, for tactical 
missions and support for land units, the Defense Ministry 
rejected the option to buy for economic reasons and because of 
the purchase of 18 Mirage F-1's from France and Qatar. Among 
other tasks, the F-16's would have filled the gap left by the 
F-5A's, whose tasks are currently being fulfilled by C-101 
training aircraft equipped with bomb targeting and launching 
systems. 
  The department headed by Julian Garcia Vargas felt that the 
purchase of these aircraft would have necessitated a major 
effort to establish a maintenance network for a new weapons 
system. This would be in clear contradiction to the line 
pursued by the Air Force in the last three years, in 
decommissioning various types of aircraft with a view to making 
the air fleet more homogeneous so as to make maintenance more 
flexible and cheaper. The purchase of the F-16's would also 
have made it necessary to train pilots and maintenance 
personnel. For these reasons, although the Defense Ministry 
regards the good price for the planes as a major consideration, 
the operation would have been much more costly taking a wider 
view. 
  In addition, there are also political factors weighing 
against the operation from the Defense Ministry viewpoint. 
Sources consulted by this newspaper indicated that the partners 
participating in the EF-200, the former EFA [European Fighter 
Aircraft], would not take it very well for Spain to purchase 
U.S. hardware now, when the project in question is entering a 
decisive phase. In this respect, the case of Italy is fairly 
similar to Spain's, since its F-104 Starfighters have now 
outlived their service life and must be decommissioned, creating 
a major gap in its Air Force, as happened with the Spanish Air 
Force's F-5's. 
  The Defense Ministry and the Air Force have now decided on 
the purchase of 18 Mirage F-1's from France and Qatar, in the 
"C" and "ED" versions. It is hoped that these planes will 
complete the fleet of these machines, which has been much 
reduced because of a number of accidents, reducing the fleet to 
50 planes from the original 60. 
  The planes from Qatar, according to Air Force sources, 
consist of 12 single-seaters and one two-seater, and are 
destined, in all probability, for the 11th Wing at Manises 
(Valencia), which has hitherto also been equipped with Mirage 
F-1's, but in the model in service in Spain, the F-1CE; these 
will go back to their original unit, the 14th Wing at Los Llanos.

<F P=106> [RITZAUS Bureau report: "Liberals Answer Back"] </F>
  [Text] The Social Democratic Party [SDP] today does not 
have a policy on Europe. The prime minister is trying to paper 
over the inner split by acting as if everything can continue as 
before. This is chasing away the young people from his party. 
But what is worse: This is also costing Denmark influence in 
Europe. 
  This was said by former Foreign Minister Uffe 
Ellemann-Jensen 
(Liberal Party) in a comment on the attack SDP Chairman and 
Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen has directed against the 
Liberals' Europe policy in a letter issued by the LO [National 
Labor Confederation] in which he calls the Liberals the main 
enemy to the SDP in late summer's election for the European 
Parliament. 
  Ellemann-Jensen characterizes as "pure nonsense" the prime 
minister's assertion that the Liberals are pulling out of the 
National Compromise and are seeking a "United States of Europe." 
  "The Liberals want the European Union [EU] to become a body 
for cooperation among independent states, and we are observing 
the rules of the game in the National Compromise. But we want it 
made possible for the people to rescind the Danish reservation 
[opt-out] to cooperation in the EU through a new referendum, and 
we are working to get a majority for this," said 
Ellemann-Jensen. 
  He claims that Europe has changed itself since the National 
Compromise was arrived at almost two years ago, and that today 
there is far greater need for establishing cooperation in 
defense and refugee policies. 
  "This is seen in the entirely relevant events in the former 
Yugoslavia and in Russia. Today the peace in Europe is in 
danger, and we cannot defend the peace by sticking our head in 
the sand," said Ellemann-Jensen.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Aho Wants To Continue as Party </F>
Leader"] 
  [Text] Prime Minister Esko Aho is ready to continue as 
Finland's Center Party chairman. He stated his wish to continue 
in an interview published Friday [15 April] by the paper 
KESKIPOHJANMAA. "I regard it as my duty to be in a position to 
defend what has been done over the period of the last three 
years," Aho affirmed. SUOMENMAA reporter Seppo Kuisma was 
indignant over Aho's interview. In a subsequent article, Kuisma 
accused Aho of betraying the Center Party's main press organ by 
announcing this through KESKIPOHJANMAA. Aho had not deigned to 
tell of his wish to continue when he spoke with SUOMENMAA 
reporters on Thursday. He cited as explanation as "simply for 
reasons of scheduling." It was made clear to Kuisma that it was 
a problem of KESKIPOHJANMAA's printing schedule.

  [Text] UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali will submit 
his report to the UN Security Council on the confidence-building 
measures [CBM's] in 10 days. This period will be used as a new 
silent deadline for the Turkish side to accept the CBM's. 
  According to information from the Cyprus Broadcasting 
Corporation correspondent in New York, the reason for the new 
deadline is the secretary general's heavy work schedule. In 
reality, though, the new deadline is due to the weakness of the 
Security Council permanent members to agree on a common line. 
The silent deadline was decided by the ambassadors of the five 
UN Security Council members in Nicosia. Joe Clark, the UN 
secretary general's special representative in Cyprus, agrees 
with this decision in principle but appears dissatisfied, mainly 
about the tolerant stance that the United States is showing 
toward Turkey. Clark links the renewal of his contract with the 
outcome of the efforts at the end of the 10-day deadline. 
  A UN official said he hopes the CBM's will be accepted while 
the report is being written, otherwise the UN secretary general 
will proceed based on UN Resolution 889. 
  Clark met Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department special 
coordinator on the Cyprus issue, in San Francisco last night and 
discussed ways to utilize the 10-day deadline as well as what 
must be done if nothing happens by the end of the deadline. 
  A UN statement said that Clark and Butrus-Ghali discussed 
the 
preparation of the report and the future direction of UN 
efforts. A UN source in New York said that despite the failure 
of the latest efforts of the UN envoys, the United Nations will 
not abandon its efforts to implement the CBM's. The same source 
said it is almost impossible for the United Nations to wash its 
hands of a problem to which it has devoted so much time and 
energy.

<F P=106> [Report by Kh. Kharalambidhis] </F>
  [Text] The Turkish Secret Services agents who act in the 
free areas, have pulled back. After the spy incident at Larnaca 
Airport and the arrest of Turkish Cypriot smuggler Halil Goskun, 
the agents have suspended all activities. The Security 
Authorities believe that the Turkish Secret Services 
headquarters have ordered all agents to suspend every activity 
until further notice. This action was considered necessary 
because basic MIT [National Intelligence Organization] agents 
who act in the free areas have already been identified and 
inactivated while others are being monitored to identify their 
associates. 
  Foreign diplomats and military attaches consider a great 
success the Security Authorities' identification of British and 
U.S. military officers at Larnaca Airport when the National 
Guard was on an extremely confidential mission. Diplomatic and 
military circles stressed that British and U.S. claims, that 
they were at the airport supposedly to watch airplanes land and 
take off, are unfounded. 
  Our own Security Authorities made the same evaluation. The 
National Guard and the police believe beyond any doubt that the 
American and Britons who were arrested at the Airport were 
observing National Guard work and were recording everything for 
the Turks. 
  It is noted that their moves, their pursuit by the police, 
their return to the airport, and their arrest disavows each of 
their claims. This is why demarches were made to the British 
High Commission and the U.S. Embassy, whose members were 
identified and interrogated following the airport incident. 
From the interrogations of the British and American military 
officers, the Cypriot Security Authorities drew their own 
conclusions, which will help them identify Turkish Secret 
Services agents acting in the free areas. 
  The continuing interrogations have not yet determined who 
leaked the information that the National Guard would perform a 
predefined mission at Larnaca Airport at that specific time. I 
SIMERINI reported exclusively that the spy incident in Larnaca 
Airport concerned Greece. The Greek National Defense General 
Staff asked YEEF [National Guard General Staff] to submit all 
relevant information and evidence of the case so that 
investigations could be held in Greece as well. 
  In a statement to I SIMERINI yesterday, reliable circles 
said 
that all evidence and conclusions from the investigations and 
interrogations are being evaluated and they will constitute the 
basis for the missions of the relevant National Guard and police 
services against Turkish agents and their associates who act in 
the free areas against Cyprus' defense and internal security.

  [Text] The Council of Ministers has decided that the state 
will temporarily take control of the banking activities of the 
Mediterranean Guarantee Bank and Everest Bank in order to 
guarantee and protect the rights of account holders. 
  According to the decision adopted by the Council of 
Ministers 
last night, the banking activities of the Mediterranean 
Guarantee Bank have been suspended for a few days, while Everest 
Bank will conduct its activities under the authority of the 
Central Bank as of today. Those who receive salaries through 
the Mediterranean Guarantee Bank will be able to receive their 
checks from the Finance Ministry today. The authority of the 
executive and governing councils of the two banks has been 
handed over to the Central Bank. 
  In a statement after the Council of Ministers meeting last 
night, President Rauf Denktas asked account holders to rest easy 
because the banks are capable of paying them. He stressed that 
nobody will lose his money and that the rights of account 
holders will be protected. 
  Denktas said that the relevant Council of Ministers decision 
was appropriate and relieved the citizens. He stressed that the 
banks in North Cyprus are stable and are under the control of 
the government. He called on account holders not to believe 
rumors. Denktas pointed out that there is no danger concerning 
the banks and called on citizens to trust their banks.

    [Editorial Report] Reaction in the Greek press to Greece's 
being brought before the European Court of Justice over the 
embargo it imposed on The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
(FYROM) has dwelled on how responsible the European Union (EU) 
and the United States are for this action. 
<H5>  United States, EU Equally Responsible </H5>
  "Greek public opinion is left with the impression that 
Europeans are the villains and the Americans are the good guys 
on the Macedonian issue," writes Potis Paraskevopoulos in the 10 
April Athens weekly KIRIAKATIKI ELEVTHEROTIPIA. While this 
impression has been reinforced by the decision of the EU 
Commission to refer Greece to the European Court of Justice, he 
argues, it is an erroneous impression because there is complete 
cooperation between the EU and the United States. According to 
Paraskevopoulos, the EU was too hasty in referring Greece to the 
Court of Justice while UN mediator Cyrus Vance's efforts were 
still ongoing. The move encouraged FYROM President Kiro 
Gligorov's intransigence and destroyed Greek trust in the EU. 
However, President Clinton coordinated his deadline for 
progress on the Skopje issue with the EU Commission, which had 
set 13 April for talks in New York between Vance and Greek and 
FYROM representatives, Paraskevopoulos maintains. On the other 
hand, the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) government was 
wrong in hastily breaking off the UN- sponsored dialogue with 
FYROM, as was Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou in imposing the 
embargo on that country. In so doing, Papandreou misjudged 
Clinton's intentions, Paraskevopoulos contends. The U.S. 
President's support for Gligorov became obvious with the 
dispatch of a U.S. military contingent to FYROM, and it is clear 
that the EU believes the existence of FYROM is necessary to 
peace in the region. While Papandreou hesitated to impose the 
embargo for fear of the European reaction, he was counting on 
Washington's support because of U.S.-European tensions in the 
region. The embargo was a "risky" initiative and it failed, 
Paraskevopoulos continues. At the same time that Papandreou 
found no supporters abroad, he "blackmailed" fellow Greek 
politicians into approving his move for fear of domestic 
political consequences. Since he cannot assign responsibility 
for his mistakes to the "bad Europeans," he is blaming them, as 
he will blame the "good" Americans for not understanding Greece 
and then blame the UN for using the same criteria toward a 
"statelet" like FYROM that it applies to a "state" like Greece, 
Paraskevopoulos concludes. 
<H5>  EU Action Termed "Naked Provocation" </H5>
  An editorial in the 7 April Athens daily ELEVTHEROTIPIA 
calls 
the EU referral decision an "unprecedented naked provocation" 
against Greece, as well as yet another proof of the "partiality 
and enmity" of Greece's European partners. The EU decision 
"automatically makes Brussels an untrustworthy interlocutor" in 
solving the problem between Athens and Skopje, the editorial 
continues. If Greece should not be concerned, for it will win 
its case on the basis of "inalienable rights," it is the "major 
issue of Community solidarity that is at stake." In practice, 
the editorial concludes, solidarity that has given way to 
"interests and other goals" is nonexistent. 
<H5>  Politicians React </H5>
  The 8 April Athens daily I KATHIMERINI published the 
reaction 
of a number of Greek politicians following the EU decision. 
Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said that the decision 
"does not foster stability and security in the area of the 
southern Balkans" and that it may have a "negative influence" on 
Cyrus Vance's mediating initiative. Venizelos added that the 
EU's common foreign and security policy has been "sorely tried" 
in recent months because of the crisis in the former Yugoslavia, 
and that the decision "violates Community solidarity." I 
KATHIMERINI also cited Minister of Defense Yerasimos Arsenis as 
saying that "the Skopje issue is too important to be entrusted 
to technocrats and economists." Arsenis charged that the 
European countries' understanding of the "specificities of 
conditions in the Balkans is especially weak." The decision, he 
is quoted as saying, is the "bureaucratic result of processing 
data from a strictly legalistic point of view." Arsenis 
insisted that the decision will not change the Greek stance. 
New Democracy (ND) leader Miltiadhis Evert is cited as saying 
that while the unity of the national front on the issue of FYROM 
must be maintained, Greeks must be told that the situation is 
very serious. Evert criticized government policy, charging that 
"precious time has been lost" and that "the absence of a clear 
policy has produced the expected results." According to I 
KATHIMERINI, Political Spring leader Andonis Samaras stated that 
the EU decision "expressing Community solidarity with Gligorov" 
is "unprecedented and offensive." He added that even if the 
Court's decision goes against Greece, "we are not compelled to 
apply it." Communist Party (KKE) leader Aleka Papariga is cited 
as blaming the signing of the Maastricht Treaty for the Skopje 
problem and stressing that it gave the EU "the right to 
interfere in issues concerning Greece." Finally, N. 
Konstandopoulos, leader of the Coalition of the Left for 
Progress, attributed the decision to the "erratic moves" of the 
government, the ND, and Political Spring, as well as to the EU's 
negative stance. Noting that an impasse has been reached, 
Konstandopoulos blamed the government and the parties for a 
"purely political" approach to the Skopje problem, emphasizing 
that the PASOK government has turned Greece into the venue for a 
"peculiar confrontation pitting the interests of the United 
States, the EU and some of its member states against each 
other." 
<H5>  United States Responsible for Referral </H5>
  In an 8 April I KATHIMERINI article, Ino Afendouli writes 
that according to a number of moves "in the sphere of secret 
diplomacy," the United States seems to have offered the EU the 
basic argument to refer Greece to the Court of Justice by 
stating that FYROM is "dangerously destabilized" by the Greek 
embargo and that relations between the Slavic majority and the 
Albanian minority are "exacerbated." Moreover, the absence of a 
"conflagration" in the area is just as important to the United 
States as to the EU, Afendouli continues. At a time when 
Bosnians are led to a "U.S.-inspired" Croatian-Muslim 
federation, it is "unrealistic" to expect that Washington and 
Greece's partners will be receptive to "Greek sensitivities 
that, in their view, are a destabilizing factor." Afendouli 
ends by warning that the U.S. intervention may lead to an 
unsatisfactory solution that the Greek Government would be 
unable to accept since it rejected better ones in the past.

<F P=106> [Report signed "a.u., rie, d.n.": "Mock Against Referendum </F>
on Neutrality"] 
  [Text] After the irritation about statements by Foreign 
Minister Alois Mock at the weekend, which could be interpreted 
as proposing a new referendum if Austrian neutrality were to be 
abolished, Mock clarified things on Monday [2 May], and, in an 
interview with DIE PRESSE, strictly rejected such a referendum. 
  "If neutrality were really to be abolished one day, the 
decision would have to be made by parliament and not in a 
referendum," the foreign minister emphasized in the interview. 
Legally, it is clear that neutrality is not an intrinsic law of 
the Constitution, and it is only such laws that require a 
referendum. 
  In an earlier news conference, Mock explained the confusion 
created through his address to the Greens conference in the 
following way: He would not be told not to think ahead. All he 
did was discuss possibilities that might become relevant in a 
few decades. Not many things, apart from God, are forever, Mock 
said. 
  In another news conference, Austrian People's Party [OeVP] 
Chairman Busek also gave assurances that this question was not 
currently on the agenda. "We will join the European Union [EU] 
as a neutral country. Everything else will depend on whether 
there will be changes in the EU, and what changes. If such 
changes were to affect an intrinsic law of the Constitution -- 
which we do not know today -- then we are obliged to put the 
issue to a referendum in Austria; but everything in its time." 
  Mock's statements at the Greens' Federal Congress were 
described by Busek as "technically most upright." Yet the 
Greens deliberately misinterpreted Mock; moreover, some of 
Mock's statements were quoted in a condensed version. 
  The vice chancellor once more stressed "the clear course of 
the OeVP," which "has always advocated a collective security 
system for Europe." The "logical development" is a collective 
security system, about which there is "absolutely no dissent" 
even with Chancellor Vranitzky -- "That is government policy," 
Busek said. 
  Yesterday, on the sidelines of a news conference, Heide 
Schmidt, chairwoman of the Liberal Forum, described the 
Government's position on the issue of neutrality as "two-faced 
and cowardly." She said she saw no need to raise the question 
now of whether a referendum might become necessary at a later 
time.

Gerhard Konzelmann in Stuttgart, in English with superimposed

  [Text] [Konzelmann] During his visit to Stuttgart, Yasir 
'Arafat answered questions about the future development of the 
peace process in the Middle East. I asked him whether the 
irritation and the delaying tactics have now come to an end. 
Are the doors of Jericho now open for 'Arafat? 
  ['Arafat] During the next 48 hours, all problems will be 
settled. The Jericho-Gaza agreement will be signed on Wednesday 
[4 May]. This date has been set by President Mubarak. 
  [Konzelmann] My next question referred to Syria, which is 
still causing problems. 'Arafat stressed that the Syrians must 
realize that he does not want to conclude a separate peace 
agreement with Israel. He is thinking of a comprehensive peace 
for Palestinians, Jordanians, Syrians, and Lebanese. Asked 
about the attitude of Syria's President Hafiz al-Asad, 'Arafat 
stated: 
  ['Arafat] His excellency had a very good conversation with 
U.S. Secretary of State Christopher. 
  [Konzelmann] 'Arafat sees the more distant future in the 
following way: 
  ['Arafat] The Israelis will withdraw their troops from the 
entire West Bank, from Jericho, Gaza, Nablus. 
  [Konzelmann] When I asked him whether Nablus will also be 
under his control, he replied: Yes, after four months. Then he 
will meet with me in Jerusalem. 
  Numerous Palestinians were very disappointed in the past few 
weeks. 
  ['Arafat] They were right. Nothing had happened. 
  [Konzelmann] Asked what he is doing with the radical Muslims 
of Hamas, 'Arafat stressed that he is optimistic. Many have 
declared that they will participate in the peace process and in 
free elections in Palestine.

<F P=106> ["tl"-signed report: "Government Coalition Wants To `Faith </F>
Heal' Economy"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- The Social Democratic Party of Germany 
[SPD] chairman and candidate for chancellor, Rudolf Scharping, 
has warned against "setting economic figures too high for purely 
tactical reasons in the run-up to the elections." Economic 
development in Germany is still stagnating, Scharping said in an 
interview with HANDELSBLATT. 
  Scharping accused ministers Waigel and Rexrodt of "faith 
healing." The chancellor goes on about "flowering landscapes of 
the economic upswing," but the government coalition has not done 
its homework to achieve this, the SPD chairman said. That is 
why the six leading economic research institutes have quite 
rightly criticized the fact that the course has not yet been set 
by the government for a vigorous economic growth and a high 
level of employment. 
  Scharping pointed out that domestic demand -- especially 
private consumption, but also production investment -- will 
continue to drop, or increase to the most insufficient degree. 
The incomes of the masses have also declined significantly in 
1994. Capacities are far from being fully utilized, 
unemployment continues to increase, and a considerable number of 
jobs are still being cut. 
  The SPD chairman also quotes the president of the Federal 
Association of German Industry [BDI], Tyll Necker, who, 
together, with other industrial leaders, doubts -- quite rightly 
-- whether the mass unemployment can be expected to drop in 
1995, if the policies remain unchanged. Anyone conveying the 
impression that the problems have already been solved is 
creating false hopes, said Scharping. They are disguising the 
fact that outdated structures in the state and the economy have 
to be modernized, if the slight recovery is to become stable 
growth for all. 
  Scharping said it is crucial that ecological changes of the 
industrial society are promoted and the modernization of the 
state's activities is accelerated. This is the only way to meet 
the challenges of the labor market and to restore "social 
justice in Germany, which has been damaged" by the Kohl 
government. Scharping: "Unless we do that, we will lose a great 
opportunity arising for our country during the next economic 
cycle." 
  For this reason, the SPD suggests a solidarity pact, in 
which 
it wants to include the trade unions, industrialist 
associations, and the Bundesbank. This specific action by the 
state should continue a job-oriented wage policy in a climate of 
expansion that is free of inflation, said Scharping. Scharping 
said that the preconditions for such a solidarity pact coming 
into being are "the cornerstones of a future Social Democratic 
government policy": The 1995 tax rate must not be increased any 
further, net debt will have to be decreased, and -- as soon as 
the economic development allows -- the proportion of the GNP 
allocated to state spending must grow at a slower rate than the 
GNP itself. 
  The SPD wants to "promote" investment in industry "by tax 
reliefs." That is why investment allowances and exceptional 
write-offs are being planned. Scharping wants to cut ancillary 
wages as "early as possible," in order to decrease the burden on 
industry and to increase the income available to those in 
gainful employment. 
  The SPD chairman once again mentioned the surcharge planned 
by the SPD, which would affect fewer than 20 percent of all 
taxpayers. Scharping: "With this package of cost cuts for 
employers and companies, tax cuts for the incomes of the masses, 
and with tax relief for industrial investment, we will manage to 
achieve an economic upswing for everybody -- and not just a 
Kohl-made upswing for millionaires."

  [Text] A Maltese oil tanker tried yesterday -- with the 
help of Serbian-Montenegrin naval vessels -- to break through 
the UN embargo against the Yugoslav Federation. Italian fighter 
planes and British and Dutch ships stopped it. Massimo De 
Angelis interviewed Defense Chief of Staff Admiral Venturoni. 
  [Begin recording] [De Angelis] Admiral, did the Italian 
forces run the risk of getting involved yesterday in the 
Adriatic Sea? 
  [Venturoni] There has been such a risk, since the Italian 
Armed Forces are part of an international allied coalition. 
There was an incident yesterday: An oil tanker tried to break 
through the embargo. Naval forces belonging to the 
Serbian-Montenegrin republic intervened and our forces strongly 
reacted. Two Tornado planes from the Gioia Del Colle airbase 
also took part in the operation. They helped the NATO and West 
European Union ships. According to information I have, the 
embargo has caused great difficulties to the republic of Serbia 
and Montenegro. We have evidence that their being more ready to 
negotiate may be linked to the need to see an end to the embargo. 
  [De Angelis] So, the international alliance in the Adriatic 
Sea to enforce the UN resolutions is really working. 
  [Venturoni] Yes, it works very well. It is being coordinated 
mostly by commands based in Italy. They are under the command 
of Italian officers. It is a typical example of what 
cooperation should be within NATO and -- thanks to the West 
European Union -- also at a European level. 
  [De Angelis] Does this mean a lot of work for Italy? 
  [Venturoni] Well, Italy is quite involved. We have three 
ships which are constantly assigned to the coalition forces, 
maritime reconnaissance planes and also Air Force planes 
supporting naval forces. They are on constant alert at Italian 
bases. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Marta Yoldi] </F>
  [Text] "The economic situation is chaotic. Honestly, I see 
no way out if we continue along this route." Thus did Nicolas 
Redondo sum up his view of the current Spanish situation at a 
breakfast yesterday with reporters that, though no one referred 
to it as such, served as an unofficial farewell by the incumbent 
general secretary of the UGT [General Union of Workers]. 
  Redondo asserted that our economy can no longer stand the 
thousands of layoffs week after week and the continual job 
losses in the small-business sector, "which the media do not 
even bother to report, while the government displays inertia and 
even appears surprised at what is occurring." 
  Another remark by the union leader struck a note of despair: 
"We know that we cannot be staging general strikes at every 
turn, but this situation has to be addressed without delay." To 
judge, however, by still another assertion made by Nicolas 
Redondo in response to a question concerning the PSV [Basque 
Socialist Party], the unions have very little margin left for 
maneuver. "Yes, I venture to say that is true. We are paying a 
price for having staged a general strike." 
<H5>  PSOE's Rightist Tilt </H5>
  As usual, the government's current policy rated harsh 
comments by the UGT leader, but this time, citing the outcome of 
the party's recently concluded 33d congress, he criticized the 
PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] directly. 
  "The party is now tilting toward the right," he said. 
Without 
voicing judgment of this situation, Redondo nevertheless pointed 
out that the party congress served to confirm what was already 
known: that the PSOE in its majority supports the government's 
policy, and that neolaissez-faire has now asserted itself as a 
doctrine among the rank and file of Spanish socialism. His 
summation of the PSOE congress was: "Pedro Solbes walked away 
with it." 
  In any case, said Redondo, "I am not going to resign from 
the 
PSOE. I am still unbelievably credulous, and willing to believe 
that something will change." He also expressed his confidence in 
the role of the left in general: "There is an official 
institutionalized left, and a real left. But with time, I 
believe that a coherent left can emerge. Why not?" 
  Yesterday's meeting with the press also ranged to discussion 
of other burning issues, such as the PSV crisis and the 
forthcoming UGT congress, at which Nicolas Redondo will be 
leaving the position he has occupied as general secretary for 
the past 17 years. 
  In his farewell remarks yesterday, the UGT leader 
acknowledged that those "morally" responsible for the PSV's 
setback are the union leaders and, of course, the management of 
the IGS [expansion unknown]-PSV. "The government is not in any 
way responsible," he said, adding, however, that neither had the 
government been very helpful. 
  Nevertheless, Redondo concluded, the cooperativists need not 
be overly concerned if the following steps are followed: 
presentation of the cooperative's viability plan that is being 
worked out by the IGS, to the administrators appointed by the 
government; if agreement is reached, granting of a credit line 
of 8 billion pesetas guaranteed by the IGS's assets; and lastly, 
building of the housing units over a period of four years. 
<H5>  The Succession </H5>
  His successor clearly will be Candido Mendez. The general 
secretary added nothing new to what has already been disclosed 
as regards the makeup of the new leadership. Mendez is the 
candidate who best meets the requisite conditions for creating a 
consensus at the April congress. Redondo asserts that it is for 
this reason that he personally selected Mendez. Mendez's plan, 
which features the strengthening of the federations within the 
organization, "is our plan," and Redondo thinks that it is also 
the plan of the other candidate in the running, Manuel Fernandez 
"Lito." 
  Yesterday, Candido Mendez took a giant step toward ensuring 
that he will have the backing of the majority at the UGT 
congress. Its certainty now appears irreversible. The FSP 
[Public Services Federation], the largest of the UGT 
federations, announced its preference for Mendez's candidacy 
yesterday. The FSP's special congress also decided to support 
the continued incumbency of the UGT's present Executive 
Committee.

  [Text] Danish Defense Minister Hans Haekkerup hopes that 
the Bosnian Serbs learned a lesson from the clash between Serb 
artillery and Danish tanks on Friday [29 April]. The Serb 
troops have announced that nine of their soldiers were killed 
when the tanks -- belonging to the Nordic UN troops -- shelled 
Serb firing positions near the town of Tuzla. Speaking prior to 
the meeting of defense ministers, which has opened in Korsoer in 
Denmark, Haekkerup said that the UN troops must not be passive 
targets but they have at least the right to fire back. 
  The meeting in Korsoer is discussing the Nordic countries' 
peacekeeping operation in Bosnia. The meeting is also attended 
by the UN commander in Bosnia, Michael Rose.

  [Excerpt] President Rauf Denktas has said that south 
Cyprus' union with the European Union [EU] will secure the full 
integration of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus [TRNC] 
with Turkey. Republican People's Party leader Deniz Baykal has 
said that he does not believe that a lasting peace can be 
achieved in Cyprus without accepting the equality of the two 
communities. 
  Baykal is continuing his contacts in the TRNC. Baykal and 
the delegation accompanying him met with Denktas, Assembly 
Speaker Ayhan Halit Acarkan, Prime Minister Atun, Deputy Prime 
Minister Ozker Ozgur, Foreign Affairs and Defense Minister Atay 
Ahmet Rasit, National Unity Party Dervis Eroglu, and Communal 
Liberation Party leader Mustafa Akinci. 
  In a statement at the meeting, Denktas drew attention to a 
statement made by Greek Cypriot leader Kliridhis to the effect 
that the doors of the EU will open for south Cyprus irrespective 
of whether the CBM's [confidence-building measures] prove to be 
successful. Recalling that both sides accepted the package 
submitted to them, Denktas added that it is Kliridhis who [word 
indistinct]. He quoted Kliridhis as saying: Either we say yes 
together with Denktas and enter the EU or we join the Union 
without them, which would be devastating for the Turkish 
Cypriots. Denktas added: This is tantamount to diluting the 
guarantee agreement and to canceling the rights granted to us. 
  Denktas noted that the continuation of this injustice and 
the 
entry of south Cyprus to EU will secure the full integration of 
north Cyprus with Turkey. Pointing out that the two sides 
should get together to solve the Cyrus problem, Denktas added 
that the Greek Cypriot government has been rejecting the 
proposals being submitted claiming that it is the government of 
Cyprus and that, therefore, it cannot meet as equals with the 
Turkish Cypriot side. Denktas further stressed that an agreement 
cannot be reached without equality. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by K. I. Angelopoulos: "The Difficult Balance </F>
Between the United States and the European Union"] 
  [Text] Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's talks in the 
United States and the statements that followed sealed the 
impressive "turn" of Papandreou's foreign policy. Even before 
last October's election, his associates already knew that the 
PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] leader believed 
developments in the Balkans had brought Athens closer to 
Washington than to Brussels. 
  After 10 October 1993, the prime minister saw that the 
majority of the European Union [EU] partners negatively viewed 
his return to the European scene. Their stance on the 
"Macedonian" issue became even tougher, something that 
disappointed and angered a significant part of the Greek popular 
opinion. So, although the U.S. State Department decided to 
recognize FYROM [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia] and 
the U.S. Pentagon considered that a military "umbrella" for the 
neighboring republic was necessary, Papandreou chose to trust 
the U.S. Balkans policy and tried to bring the Greek stance 
closer to the U.S. strategy and diplomatic approach in the 
southern Balkans. 
  In the United States, the prime minister did not hide his 
satisfaction at the White House's "understanding" of the Greek 
problems. Addressing Greek-Americans, Papandreou did not 
hesitate to state publicly his bitterness and disappointment at 
the lack of EU "solidarity." In his statement after talks with 
U.S. President Bill Clinton, the prime minister "acquitted" the 
United States of beginning the Yugoslav affair and clearly 
implied that the responsibility lies completely with the strong 
members of the EU. All of this comes at a time when Greece holds 
the six-month EU presidency and Papandreou is preparing to chair 
the EU summit in Corfu in June. 
  The prime minister's preference for the U.S. policy did not 
just appear on the Greek political scene after 10 October 1993. 
Former Prime Minister Konstandinos Mitsotakis' government had 
originally favored the Balkans' policy of former U.S. President 
George Bush. It was during the time (1990-91) the U.S. 
leadership was opposing the division of Yugoslavia. Greek 
political "attraction" toward the United States has since 
increased. At the same time disappointment has escalated at the 
policy adopted by the strong countries in the EU and the way 
they intervened in military clashes in the former Yugoslavia. 
The "turn" toward the United States is now a fact. This 
development, however, leads to a basic question: What are 
Greece's relations with the European Union today and what does 
the government believe they will be in the future? Will the 
issue of Skopje prove to be "fatal" for Greek-EU relations? 
What will happen in connection with the "harsh" conditions for 
Greece stemming from the Maastricht Treaty? 
  It is a fact that the EU is not in a position to formulate a 
common foreign policy. It is also a fact that the majority of 
EU members do not share Athens' view regarding the Balkans. 
From the beginning of this great crisis in the former 
Yugoslavia, Greece found itself "isolated" from the community, 
not only because there was rejection of Greek views and 
arguments, but because the strong EU members did not wish to 
allow Athens to take any initiative in the Balkans. With their 
stance adopted from the beginning, the strong partners showed 
that they did not want Greece to be considered, even 
occasionally, as an EU "spokesman" in the Balkans. 
  The Germans, British, French, and Italians clearly 
demonstrated that the "new order" in the Balkans is "their 
business." But is it possible for the prime minister to 
withdraw the country's foreign policy from the European Union 
without endangering it and link it to that of the United States? 
Can he do that at a time when in the economic sector -- 
especially during a great crisis in the national economy -- 
Greece depends greatly (if not decisively) on communal funds 
within the framework of the Maastricht Treaty, which Papandreou 
has accepted? 
  The prime minister appears willing to take the "risk" and 
search for solutions to the country's critical foreign issue 
within the framework of the U.S. foreign policy's designs and 
pursuits. In the United States Papandreou surely found 
interlocutors that were better than the ones he meets in the EU. 
What will happen next? How will the EU partners react to the 
"turn" in the prime minister's foreign policy? Will Athens 
manage to create a balance between Washington and Brussels? And 
what could happen tomorrow if Clinton's Balkan policy proves to 
be unstable or changes some of its basic points? 
  Papandreou's bet is difficult and certainly does not lack 
interest. Only the future will show whether his risky political 
choice is justified. Right now it does not seem to contradict a 
large part of the Greek common view. However, the danger of 
inflating an "anti-European" feeling is visible today. We do 
not believe it is unreasonable to raise the issue at this point 
as to whether strong "anti-Europeanism" would be beneficial to 
the national interests.

<F P=106> [Article signed MA/BL/NB: "Greek-Albanian meeting in Zurich </F>
-- Development and Content of Talks Still Uncertain"] 
  [Text] The meeting between the Greek and Albanian foreign 
ministers is expected to take place. Greek Foreign Minister 
Karolos Papoulias arrived at Zurich-Kloten Airport from Athens 
on Tuesday [3 May] morning. His Albanian counterpart Alfred 
Serreqi had arrived in Zurich on Monday evening. 
  The holding of the talks and the issues to be discussed were 
still uncertain on Tuesday morning. The Greek Embassy is 
referring all requests for information to the Foreign Ministry 
in Athens. The meeting was proposed two weeks ago in Greece 
after a border incident triggered a political crisis. 
  On 13 April, three days after the fatal attack against a 
border Albanian military camp by Greek nationalists, Albania 
expelled four Greek diplomats from Tirana. Greece reacted by 
evicting an Albanian diplomat. New skirmishes broke out over 
the weekend between Greece and Albania on the occasion of the 
Orthodox Easter celebrations. 
  Greece threatened to cancel the Zurich meeting. On Sunday, 
Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou hinted that the talks 
might take place anyway. On Monday evening, around 1,000 
Albanians demonstrated in front of the Greek Consulate. They 
denounced the "aggressions against Albanians" and pleaded for a 
return to peace in the Balkans.

"Sinn Fein Ready To Explore Ways Round Deadlock"] 
  [Text] A possible move to break the political deadlock 
over December's Anglo-Irish Declaration was signalled yesterday 
by the Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams. 
  Asked in a BBC interview whether he would pick up the recent 
suggestion of Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland 
Secretary, that Sinn Fein requests for clarification of the 
declaration might be considered by London, Mr Adams said: 
``We're exploring that, and I won't say I am hopeful. 
  ``I have always said we would be flexible in allowing them 
to 
get off the hook which they got themselves on to on 
clarification. We don't want any big public climbdown by them. 
We are pursuing the issue.'' 
  It was unclear whether Mr Adams was about to submit a list 
of 
questions to the British Government, detailing the points on 
which Sinn Fein or the IRA wanted clarification. 
  Albert Reynolds, Irish Prime Minister, said last week: ``I 
would hope that we would be able to draw the process of 
clarification to a conclusion shortly, because there is, in my 
opinion, not a great deal more that can be said at this stage.'' 
  That statement was read as a warning to Sinn Fein that Mr 
Reynolds' patience was running out. The Taoiseach [Irish prime 
minister] is known to have sent a 16-page letter of 
clarification to Sinn Fein last February. But London and Dublin 
sources said last week political talks were going ahead -- with 
or without Sinn Fein. 
  THE OBSERVER has been told that the Republicans have more or 
less completed their analysis of the Downing Street Declaration. 
Those dedicated to assessing it are now working on other 
issues, according to a senior Sinn Fein source. 
  That disclosure came at the end of a week of bloodletting in 
Northern Ireland in which 10 people died, four of them killed by 
the IRA. 
  In the latest incident yesterday morning, the UFF [Ulster 
Freedom Fighters] shot and critically wounded a 39-year-old 
Catholic security man at the Valley Business Centre in 
Newtonabbey. 
  The body of a man, killed by the IRA and dumped on 
Newry/Omeath Road in South Down on Friday afternoon, was 
recovered by the security forces yesterday. 
  The IRA named him as Martin Brown, from Downpatrick, and 
alleged that he was an RUC [Royal Ulster Constabulary] Special 
Branch informer. The man, who had his hands tied behind his 
back and was shot in the head, was the tenth person to be 
murdered by the paramilitaries in nine days. 
  Until last Sunday, when John McCloy and Alan Smith (both 
Protestants) were killed in Garvagh, south Londonderry, the IRA 
had exclusively targeted members of the security forces since 
the publication of the declaration. One Republican said: "It's 
back to business as usual for the IRA, I suppose." 
  Meanwhile, it emerged yesterday that last week's claim by 
the 
Government that the IRA had held secret meetings with the 
Iranian secret intelligence service, the MOIS, had followed a 
joint operation involving all three elements of Britain's secret 
world: MI5, MI6 and GCHQ [Government Communication Headquarters]. 
  It was co-ordinated by MI5, which has had "lead 
responsibility" for combating Irish terrorism since last year. 
MI5 directed the operation, with MI6 conducting surveillance in 
several European cities. 
  It is understood vital parts of a picture described by 
Whitehall sources as a "patchwork quilt" of intelligence emerged 
from the bugging of international telephone and fax messages by 
GCHQ in Cheltenham. 
  The decision to make the intelligence public was taken by 
politicians on MI5 advice. The service considered the prospects 
of prosecuting any of those involved were remote: the meetings 
took place on foreign soil; several of those involved from Iran 
had diplomatic immunity; and it would have been almost 
impossible to put together a viable case relating to any 
specific criminal offence. Therefore it was decided to disrupt 
the link by publicising it. 
  It is understood Iran has already made cash donations to the 
IRA through Sinn Fein, but the sums involved are small. In the 
IRA-MOIS meetings, much bigger donations were discussed, 
together with weapons shipments. 
  The IRA representatives were known quartermasters with 
experience in the international arms market. It is believed 
their work was sanctioned by the Army Council.

  [Text] The relationship between the Irish republican 
movement and Iran began 13 years ago with the death of the IRA 
hunger striker Bobby Sands. 
  To the irritation of British diplomats, the Tehran street on 
which the depleted British embassy stands has been named Bobby 
Sands Avenue. 
  A year after he died, a Sinn Fein delegation attended a 
"Conference of World Movements" in the Iranian capital. Iran 
repaid that compliment by sending observers to Sinn Fein's 
annual conference in the early 1980s. Two members of Sinn Fein 
visited the Iranian-backed Hezbollah organisation in Beirut in 
1987 in an attempt to secure the release of Irish hostage Brian 
Keenan. The same year, Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, 
visited Tehran. 
  British intelligence has been trying ever since to find out 
whether those open contacts -- more at the level of political 
solidarity than anything else -- would lead to more threatening 
covert links. 
  This is the backdrop described yesterday by Whitehall 
sources 
after the Foreign Office announced that the Iranian charge 
d'affaires, Gholamreza Ansari, had been summoned for a 
ticking-off after intelligence reports of meetings between the 
IRA and Iranian intelligence officials in West Europe. 
  Despite the perceived threat from Iran, there is no evidence 
that it has supplied the IRA with weapons or funds. Yesterday's 
initiative was pre-emptive. "At this stage specific alarm bells 
began to ring and they're still ringing," one official said, 
"and now the Iranians can hear them." 
  According to British officials, the man in charge of links 
with the IRA is Amirhossein Taghavi, head of the Western 
European Section of Iran's Ministry for Intelligence Services. 
MOIS, as it is known by Western spy agencies, is the body 
responsible for contacts with subversive or terrorist 
organisations abroad, and is headed by a cleric, 'Ali Fallahian. 
  Taghavi is also said to have co-ordinated ties with 
organisations such as Abu Nidal, Lebanon's Hizballah and the 
Greek November 17th movement. 
  Some Iran-watchers doubted yesterday whether contacts with 
the IRA would have been initiated by the hard-pressed government 
of President Hashemi Rafsanjani and argued that it was more 
likely that radical factions outside the government were 
involved. 
  Other experts pointed out that Iran's record on subversion 
and terrorism has been improving recently, a fact attributed to 
the country's need to reschedule its debts with foreign, 
especially European, creditors. 
  Britain takes the Iranian threat seriously, although it sees 
a need to balance fears about terrorism with concern for trade 
and broader relations. Diplomatic ties, severed in 1989, were 
restored in 1990 and there are 14 British diplomats in Iran, 
serving under a charge d'affaires. 
  The long-standing threat to kill Salman Rushdie, author of 
The Satanic Verses -- repeated recently -- is seen as evidence 
of Tehran's intentions. And there was fury in London when Ali 
Fallahian, the MOIS chief was invited for official talks in Bonn 
last year. 
  In the past Iranian intelligence organisations have become a 
battleground in the fight between reformist and radical factions 
which has plagued the Islamic regime virtually since its 
inception in 1979. Ordinary Iranians live in fear of these 
bodies, which have been behind the arrest and execution 
thousands of people and the regular campaigns on Islamic dress 
which have led to the detention of hundreds of women. 
  Western intelligence sources have also focused on the 
activities of the Pasdaran or Revolutionary Guards, the 
ideological army of the republic. 
  In the last year or more, the radicals are said to have lost 
a lot of support as most Iranians became preoccupied with the 
economic crisis. 
  But the latest move comes at a time when the IRA's financial 
resources are under increasing pressure from security and 
intelligence agencies in the UK and the United States and when 
it is seeking more sophisticated arms, including specialist 
sniper rifles and anti-helicopter missiles. 
  A spate of armed robberies the early 1990s offered a clue 
that the IRA -- which is estimated to spend 5 million pounds to 
7 million a year -- needed funds. Contributions from US 
sympathisers have been falling and are estimated to amount to 
less than 100,000 pounds a year. Law enforcement agencies have 
turned their attention sources of funds including drinking 
clubs, cross-border smuggling and fraud. This month, police in 
Britain and both sides of the Irish border launched operation 
Madronna, seizing cash stolen property and financial documents. 
The operation was symptomatic of a squeeze on paramilitary 
funding by the Royal Ulster Constabulary's C13 unit. 
  Where weapons are concerned, the IRA still holds huge 
arsenal 
provided by Libya in the mid-1980s, hidden underground bunkers 
across the Irish Republic. 
  At the end of 1992 it was estimated that the Provisional, 
north and south of the border still had 650 Kalashnikov AK type 
semi-automatic rifles more than a dozen general purpose 
machine-guns; about 20 DSHK Russian heavy-calibre 
armour-piercing machine-guns; one SAM-7 surface-to-air missile 
(nine others have been recovered); more than 40 RPG rocket 
launchers six flame throwers; 70 Webley revolvers; more than 600 
detonators, a three tons of Semtex explosive -- half the Libyan 
arms ship six years earlier. 
  Security sources believe this could sustain the armed 
conflict for years.

<F P=106> [Stephen Bates article: "Major Supports Call for ID Cards"] </F>
  [Text] The Prime Minister appeared to give his support 
yesterday to the introduction of identity cards for all 
citizens. 
  He told MPs during question time there was a strong case for 
identity cards despite practical difficulties, and said they 
were being considered. 
  The Government has previously always concluded that the 
practical difficulties and cost of issuing accurate and 
up-to-date identity cards made it impractical, though they are 
popular with the otherwise libertarian right as a means of 
tracking criminals and preventing social security fraud. 
  Any attempt to introduce identity cards would cause 
political 
controversy and opposition on civil liberties grounds. 
  The issue was raised by the right-wing backbench MP Nicholas 
Budgen (Wolverhampton SW) in the wake of police swoops on 60 
alleged illegal immigrants from Africa working for 
Labour-controlled Southwark council. 
  Mr Major said: "I think there is a strong case to be made 
for 
identity cards. There are undoubtedly great practical 
difficulties in introducing them, and there are other matters to 
be considered as well, but we have been looking at the options 
in this respect and we propose to go on doing so."

  [Text] Stuttgart -- PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat has expressed 
confidence in Stuttgart today regarding the signing of the 
autonomy agreement for Gaza and Jericho. At an international 
news conference at the Daimler-Benz headquarters, 'Arafat 
stated, referring to the meeting between him and Israeli Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin in Cairo on Tuesday [3 May], that "there 
are still a few problems to be settled." He hopes that it will 
be possible "to eliminate these obstacles" during the talks. 
  Asked about the planned date of the signing of the agreement 
in Cairo on Wednesday, he pointed out: "Where there is a will, 
there is a way." He added: "It takes two to tango, one also 
depends on others." He declined to mention a date as to when he 
will return to Jerusalem, Jericho, and Gaza. It depends on when 
the Israelis will withdraw from these regions. The final 
departure of the Israelis was to have been completed by 13 
April, 'Arafat stressed. "But you see." 
  'Arafat paid a one-day visit to Stuttgart today at the 
invitation of Daimler boss Edzard Reuter.

  [Text] Bonn -- NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner has 
sharply criticized the current discussion about the Bundeswehr 
in Germany. The German armed forces have increasingly turned 
into a "quantity that is negotiable at short notice," he stated 
today in Bonn during the presentation of a book by Bundeswehr 
Inspector General Klaus Naumann. "If this development 
continues, we will be facing problems," he pointed out. 
  Woerner criticized that the strength and the structure of 
the 
Bundeswehr seem to be "manipulable at will." This cannot be 
blamed on the defense minister alone. The whole government and 
the whole parliament are responsible. Woerner added: "If the 
impression is created among the public that one can treat the 
Bundeswehr in this way, this is the beginning of the end of 
sensible security precaution in Germany." Yet not the soldiers 
are to blame but the entire political class. 
  The NATO secretary general stressed that the reunited and 
sovereign Germany can only remain a reliable partner if, as the 
central land power in Europe, it maintains armed forces that 
correspond to its geostrategic situation and its political 
significance -- both in quantitative and qualitative terms. At 
the beginning of his speech, Woerner pointed out that, as NATO 
general secretary, he is not allowed to interfere with the 
internal affairs of the member states of the alliance.

  [Text] The situation is once more slowly deteriorating in 
Bosnia. The cease-fire is disintegrating in Sarajevo, the Serbs 
are only partially respect their promises in Gorazde, and a 
group of UN soldiers sent there to monitor the truce are blocked 
35 km east of the Bosnian capital. Talks between the powers and 
the warring factions are at a standstill, and the French foreign 
minister is not hiding his concern: 
  [Begin Juppe recording] It is true, I am worried. We are 
constantly on the brink. UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] is 
increasingly less capable of controlling the situation simply 
because it was asked to fulfil tasks without the means to do so. 
We are not immune from a catastrophe, which could be sparked 
off here or there. I am particularly worried by the situation 
in Brcko, this very sensitive area between the Serbs and the 
Muslims. Besides, the contact group -- which I proposed -- has 
started work, but it appears to be limiting itself to 
consultations with the various parties. What I had in mind was 
the emergence of a common American, Russian, European position 
which would later enable us to bang the table -- if need be -- 
to say: We must now get a negotiated settlement. We are not 
doing that. This is why the chances are greater than ever that 
the arms embargo will be lifted. It must be known that -- if 
this decision is made -- it would naturally bring about the 
withdrawal of the UNPROFOR contingent, which could not remain 
there for obvious reasons. I want to remain confident. I 
believe that the only way to put pressure on the diplomatic 
process is to organize a meeting at the ministerial level as 
early as possible. [end recording]

  [Text] Paris, May 2 (AFP) -- France called on Monday [2 
May] for urgent concerted efforts to find a political solution 
to the war in Bosnia, warning that pressure to lift the arms 
embargo on Serbia and Bosnia would become irresistible. 
  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said there was strong 
pressure to lift the embargo from some sections of the U.S. 
Congress, the Islamic Conference Organisation and "in France 
also." 
  Addressing a meeting of the Anglo-American press 
association, 
Juppe said: "Can we continue to resist this pressure? I am no 
longer sure. If the situation bogs down, the pressure will 
become irresistible." 
  Without an early political solution, he said, the outcome 
would be "the solution of despair, with immeasurable 
consequences" and the withdrawal of United Nations peacekeepers. 
  Juppe called for a meeting of the foreign ministers of 
Russia, the United States and the European Union [EU] to 
relaunch peace efforts based on the EU's peace plan within 10 
days. 
  He urged unity of approach by Washington, Moscow and the EU 
to prevent the Bosnian protagonists from playing off one against 
the other, criticising the slowness of "itinerant diplomacy" by 
the contact group trying to set up new peace negotiations. 
  Juppe also called for Brcko, thought likely to become the 
next Serbian target in Bosnia, to be declared a security zone 
"with an air strike in response to the first Serbian shell." 
  Juppe said the Serbs were reportedly moving troops and 
heavy weapons towards Brcko, where the Bosnian Moslems are 
seeking access to the Save River, a tributary of the Danube, as 
part of any peace settlement. 
  The Serbs want control of Brcko to widen a corridor linking 
their conquests in eastern and western Bosnia. 
  The French foreign minister said that Brcko should be added 
to the list of six other safe areas in Bosnia including Gorazde, 
Sarajevo and Srebrenica. 
  Negotiations held under EU auspices had been within a hair's 
breadth of success before being sidelined by the arrival on the 
scene of Russian and U.S. diplomats last February within the 
contact group, he said.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- President Richard von Weizsaecker has 
amnestied terrorist Bernhard Roessner (47), who was sentenced to 
life term of imprisonment. This was announced by the 
President's Office in Bonn on Monday [2 May] upon inquiry. The 
amnesty of Roessner, who was involved in the attack on the 
German Embassy in Stockholm in 1975, will become effective on 16 
May. 
  Roessner has been in prison in Straubing for almost 19 
years. 
In November 1992 Justice Minister Sabine 
Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger ordered a suspension of the sentence 
for 18 months because of Roessner's state of health. Since then 
he has been undergoing urgent therapeutical treatment near 
Kassel.

  [Text] Paris, May 2 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb officials plan to 
try at least three French aid workers Sunday [8 May] on charges 
of smuggling weapons to Moslem forces, the relief organization 
Premiere Urgence said. 
  Eleven members of the emergency aid group have been held at 
a 
Bosnian Serb barracks near Sarajevo since April 8. 
  The organization issued a statement saying the Serbs "seem 
to 
have refrained from judging all 11 of Premiere Urgence's 
volunteers in order to bring charges against three members of 
the team." 
  The organisation strenuously denied Serb charges that it had 
channeled arms to Bosnian Moslem forces. 
  The group said it believed the other eight volunteers could 
be released before their colleagues go on trial. 
  France recently demanded the immediate and unconditional 
release of all 11 aid workers. French Foreign Minister Alain 
Juppe has said he believes they have been framed by the Serbs. 
  Several observers, including lawyers and also 
representatives 
of the International Federation of Human Rights and Amnesty 
International, hope to make their way on Friday to the Bosnian 
Serb headquarters at Pale, outside Sarajevo, where the three 
workers are to stand trial, Premiere Urgence added.

Union), legal policy spokesman of the Christian Democratic 
Union/Christian Social Union Bundestag group, harshly criticized 
the amnesty of Red Army Faction terrorist Bernhard Roessner by 
President Richard von Weizsaecker. In an interview with the 
Berlin daily BERLINER ZEITUNG the Christian Social Union 
politician said that this could be misunderstood as a signal for 
another wave of politically motivated releases of terrorists 
from prison. Decisions about the early release of prisoners are 
the business of the judiciary, according to Geis. [passage

  [Excerpt] Wuerzburg (DPA) -- On Saturday [30 April] the 
Christian Social Union [CSU] opened its European election 
campaign in Wuerzburg with a commitment to European integration. 
Speaking to 2,000 followers at a European Festival, CSU 
Chairman and FRG Finance Minister Theo Waigel called for a 
Europe of stability, federalism, and diversity. Germany must be 
willing to accept responsibility in Europe and in the world, 
Waigel said. He called for a fair division of the financial 
burdens within the European Union. The return of money to 
Germany must be improved. 
  Bavaria's Minister-President Edmund Stoiber said that anyone 
who is proclaiming a departure from the Maastricht Treaty puts 
Germany's international credibility at stake. However, it must 
be understood as a warning signal that the people's approval for 
European unification is declining to an alarming extent. 
Therefore, the CSU is calling for a reform of the European 
Union "at the head and limbs" and wants to establish more 
"political transparency." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Paris, May 2 (AFP) -- Three members of the far-left 
terrorist group Action Directe brawled with gendarmes in court 
here on Monday [2 May] after a judge ordered them taken down to 
the cells. 
  Joelle Aubron, Nathalie Menigon and Jean-March Rouillan 
fought with gendarmes after Judge Yves Jacob ordered Aubron, 35, 
to stop reading out a statement in which she denounced his 
"arrogance" and "simpering manner" and called the trial a 
"caricature of justice." 
  Aubron resisted attempts to expel her and was badly beaten 
by 
gendarmes. Three guards jumped on Action Directe leader 
Rouillan, 41, who fell to the ground where he was copiously 
beaten. 
  Menigon, 36, was abruptly removed as sympathisers in court 
shouted "murderers," prompting Jacob to order them expelled. 
The trial was adjourned until Tuesday. 
  The three are accused of the 1985 murder of General Rene 
Audran, who was in charge of arms sales at the Defence Ministry 
and two other attempted murders of defence-related personalities. 
  A fourth accused, Georges Cipriani, 44, faces the same 
charges, but refused to appear at Monday's hearing. The four 
are also accused of bomb attacks on the Western European Union 
(WEU) and Interpol headquarters in Paris in 1984 and 1986. 
  A fifth person, Aseime Rouabah, 47, is accused of supplying 
part of the explosives used in the Interpol attack. 
  Action Directe grew out of the student revolt of May 1968 
and 
used the same violent methods as the Red Army Faction (RAF) in 
Germany and the Red Brigades in Italy. 
  Judge Jacob gave Aubron 15 minutes to read a three-page 
joint 
statement after all three said they did not intend to take part 
in the trial. But the judge interrupted Aubron after seven 
minutes and ordered the three expelled. 
  Defence lawyer Bernard Ripert denounced the "brutality and 
savagery" of their treatment "although they only wanted to speak 
for a quarter of an hour." 
  Monday's trial began last November, but was adjourned after 
the accused rejected their defence lawyers. 
  The four were already sentenced to life imprisonment in 
January 1989 for the 1986 murder of Renault president Georges 
Besse. Rouillan and Cipriani are held in solitary confinement 
but are allowed to meet for 30 minutes daily at exercise. 
Aubron and Menigon have a softer regime.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- On Monday [2 May] the Free Democratic 
Party of Germany [FDP] leadership confirmed in Bonn the 
intention to continue the coalition with the Christian 
Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] after the 
Bundestag elections on 16 October with an almost unanimous 
decision in the Executive Committee. At the vote in the Federal 
Executive Committee, which consists of 48 members, four members 
abstained, FDP Chairman Klaus Kinkel told the press. 
  The Executive Committee thus followed the vote of the 
12-person FPD Presidium, which had unanimously voted in favor of 
continuing the coalition with the CDU/CSU on 11 April, upon 
Kinkel's recommendation. In Bonn it is not doubted that the FDP 
Congress, which has the last say, will also agree to this 
decision in Rostock at the beginning of June. 
  Kinkel said that the clarification of the coalition 
statement 
has strengthened the FDP's ability to act in material issues. 
Polls confirm that the Liberals are "on their way up." The 
prospects for a success of the coalition on 16 October have 
improved considerably. The CDU and the CSU now must also 
contribute their share to a positive result. The FDP will 
pursue the election campaign with a view to the coalition 
partner, following the slogan "marching separately, attacking 
together." 
  The FDP chairman announced that the FDP election program, 
which is to be adopted in Rostock, will be the basis of the 
negotiations with the CDU/CSU for the next legislative period. 
He said that the FDP is a guarantor against a red-green 
coalition and against a grand coalition. In his view, a 
red-green government would lead to a crisis of trust in foreign 
policy and to a disaster for the economy and for jobs. A grand 
coalition would be "autocratic rule by two."

  [Text] Bonn -- After a four-hour debate, the Social 
Democratic Party of Germany's [SPD] executive committee 
unanimously adopted the draft government program on Monday [2 
May] with only one abstention, SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping 
told the press afterwards. Following a comprehensive debate, 
various items were added to the part on ecology, but the 
controversial wording of the speed limit has remained unaltered. 
  The passage says that the SPD is aiming at a universal speed 
limit throughout Europe, which would be 130 kilometers per hour 
for 90 percent of all super highways, Scharping said. 
  The SPD chairman said that there was no criticism of his 
leadership -- "quite the contrary." The withdrawal of traffic 
expert Christoph Zoepel from his team was only mentioned 
briefly, [Scharping said].

  [Text] Munich -- Prior to the legal discussion procedure 
about the planned new research reactor in Garching near Munich, 
the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] and the Greens 
confirmed their criticism of the project involving 525 million 
German marks. A group of SPD politicians, including Bundestag 
members Peter Glotz and Otto Schily, criticized in Munich today, 
above all, the planned use of highly enriched uranium that can 
also be used for the construction of nuclear weapons. This is 
in contradiction with worldwide efforts to curb the 
proliferation of this substance, the critics stressed before 
tomorrow's start of the procedure. 
  For the operation of the new research reactor, a fuel rod 
requirement of 40 kg highly enriched uranium per year is 
expected. In fact, the operation of the reactor with fuel rods 
from uranium silicide does not pose any direct risk of 
proliferation, the SPD declared. However, there is a danger 
that the resulting demand might contribute to a worldwide trade 
in highly enriched uranium. 
  The new reactor is to replace the old research reactor of 
the 
Munich Technical University -- the "nuclear egg of Garching." 
After 36 years of operation, the old reactor no longer meets 
the requirements of modern research for a neutron source.

  [Text] Bonn -- The cooperation agreed between Lufthansa 
and United Airlines, the second-largest U.S. airline, in both 
Europe and America has finally been settled. 
  Transport Minister Matthias Wissmann informed the press in 
Bonn on Friday [29 April] that the U.S. Administration has 
agreed to this strategic alliance of the two airlines. The 
first flight based on the so-called code-sharing agreement is to 
take place at the beginning of June. 
  The alliance is based on the aviation agreement that was 
concluded by Bonn and Washington in mid-March. The two airlines 
will be able to offer joint flights in the future. Wissmann 
said he expects that this will enable Lufthansa to win back 
market shares on the hotly contested North Atlantic route and to 
operate more profitably in the future. He did not rule out that 
the company's currently negative balance sheet could improve by 
amounts in the three-digit million mark range over the next few 
years. On the development of prices he said that if Lufthansa 
can achieve a higher degree of utilization and work at lower 
costs, there is a chance of this trend being passed on to 
customers. 
  As advantages of this cooperation he mainly lists more 
flexible flight offers, a better utilization of joint 
installations and worldwide attending to customers. Wissmann 
said that the breakthrough in the difficult German-U.S. aviation 
negotiations was achieved when other American airlines were also 
given the right to cooperate with companies in Central and East 
Europe. In return, Lufthansa can now cooperate with domestic 
airlines on flights between the United States and the Caribbean 
or South America.

  [Editorial Report] 
<H5>  U.S. Prestige at Stake </H5>
  An editorial in the 24-25 April Paris daily LE MONDE 
comments 
on President Clinton's decision to address a NATO ultimatum to 
the Bosnian Serb forces besieging Gorazde. According to the 
editorial, the United States had to act to stop losing prestige 
after its repeated threats and warnings to Bosnian Serbs were 
not followed by action. This time, President Clinton seems 
determined to defend the people in the so-called security zones. 
While some U.S. officials believe that there are no vital 
American interests in Bosnia that would justify the use of 
force, others judge that the credibility of the United States is 
at stake, the editorial continues. Doubtless, most Americans 
agree with the first group, the editorial contends, because they 
fail to perceive the U.S. interest in Bosnia. However, the U.S. 
public does not like its presidents to be defied, be it 
President Carter in the Iran hostage issue or President Clinton 
by the Gorazde Serbs, the editorial concludes. 
<H5>  Loss of French Influence Seen </H5>
  According to Philippe Marcovici's editorial in the 13 April 
Paris daily LE QUOTIDIEN DE PARIS, when Minister of Foreign 
Affairs Alain Juppe asked on 12 April that Europe assume the 
presidency of an international peace conference on Bosnia on an 
equal footing with the United States and Russia, he was in fact 
admitting that the European Union (EU)--and consequently 
France--no longer plays the principal role in settling the 
conflict. This is despite the fact that most initiatives on 
Bosnia to date have come from France, which is not seeking to 
"use force as an end in itself" but only as the means to a 
settlement, Marcovici writes. While it is still too early to 
know whether France's policy will be successful, its 
disadvantages are already clear, Marcovici continues. Even with 
its European partners, France lacks the means to implement it 
and Paris had to resort to NATO--in other words, to the United 
States. Since Washington's first concern is to "handle Russia 
delicately," this country has been able to become an actor on 
the Bosnian scene. This return to the "classic East-West 
dialogue naturally occurred to the detriment of Europe, and of 
France in particular, which for the past three years has borne 
the heaviest burden in the former Yugoslavia," Marcovici writes, 
noting that a "cruel paradox" has emerged. With no ground 
forces in Bosnia, the United States has taken the political 
lead, while France, whose soldiers are dying there, is losing 
the initiative. 
<H5>  French Policy Criticized </H5>
  In the 14-20 April Paris weekly LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR, 
Jacques Julliard's "Chronicle" criticizes the "strange 
perseverance" of French diplomacy, which almost never departs 
from one characteristic scenario. In a first phase, he writes, 
France behaves like a mighty power and multiplies diplomatic 
initiatives without prior consultation with its partners. It 
then realizes that it lacks the means to implement these 
initiatives, at which time the United States imposes its own 
solution "to the anger of our diplomats, who reluctantly fall 
into line," Julliard remarks. In the end, France--"which 
accumulates ambiguities and succeeds in quarreling with 
everyone"--must accept the final settlement while "cursing the 
ingratitude of the peoples concerned and the arrogance of the 
Americans." This is now occurring in Bosnia, notably in 
Sarajevo, where France, which gave so much of itself, has had to 
give in to Washington's initiatives, Julliard concludes.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Bossi in One of 37 Enimont Case </F>
Indictment Requests"] 
  [Excerpts] (ANSA) Milan, April 30 -- Northern League leader 
Umberto Bossi, one of the two major partners of media magnate 
Silvio Berlusconi in the incoming right-wing coalition, was the 
subject of one of 37 indictment requests made by the Milan chief 
prosecutor's office this morning in connection with illegal 
party funding by the Ferruzzi-Montedison group and kickbacks 
paid for Montedison's 1990 pull-out from the year-old Enimont 
chemicals joint venture with public fuels group ENI [National 
Hydrocarbons Corporation]. 
  Preliminary hearings judge Italo Ghitti will pronounce on 
the 
indictment requests -- also including many disgraced former 
party heads and the former Ferruzzi top brass -- on May 24. 
  Leading prosecutor Antonio Di Pietro said the indictments 
were sought for "all those who gave and took the money." 
  Bossi's citation for violation of party funding laws is 
based 
on testimony from former Montedison managing director Carlo 
Sama, that the Northern League, like many other parties, 
received an unrecorded electoral contribution (200 million lire, 
or 125,000 dollars) in the run-up to the 1992 general election. 
  Bossi denied knowledge of the payment in testimony to the 
Enimont-linked trial of money manager Sergio Cusani, which ended 
with an eight-year conviction two days ago. He said that the 
party treasurer, since sacked, had been a fool to accept the 
money, which he claimed was stolen from League offices shortly 
after the treasurer accepted it and while he was still working 
out what to do with it. But he expressed the view that he might 
have done the same thing if he had been in the treasurer's 
shoes, given the rising party's cash needs at the time. 
  Among the others for whom indictments are sought are three 
former party heads who have admitted illegal contributions to 
their parties, Socialist Bettino Craxi, Liberal Renato 
Altissimo, and Social Democrat Carlo Vizzini, as well as the 
former Christian Democrat Budget Minister Paolo Cirino Pomicino, 
and his party's former treasurer Severino Citaristi, who have 
also admitted to receiving money from the firm. [passage 
omitted] 
  Also on the indictment list was Republican Party chief 
Giorgio La Malfa, who stepped down but was recently reinstated 
after admitting an under-the-table payment of 300 million lire 
(like the payment to the League and the smaller parties, a small 
sum compared to the more than 150 billion lire, or 94 million 
dollars, allegedly paid out in the Enimont affair). 
  Another big name was 1988-92 Christian Democrat leader 
Arnaldo Forlani, who denied any knowledge of kickbacks or other 
illegal party payments in testimony viewed by the prosecution 
and media as reticent. 
  Two former Socialist high-fliers, former Justice Minister 
Claudio Martelli and former Foreign Minister Gianni De Michelis 
were also cited, as were two of De Michelis's former staff, one 
still on the run. Another former minister named was ex-Liberal 
Egidio Sterpa. Craxi's brother-in-law and former Milan Mayor 
Paolo Pillitteri was also named. 
  Former head of Ferruzzi external relations Luigi Bisignani, 
who allegedly arranged the passage of 93 billion lire in 
Treasury Credit Certificates (CCTs) via the Vatican Bank in 
payment of Enimont kickbacks, was named along with the 
Swiss-based architect of Ferruzzi-Montedison's "parallel 
accounts," Giuseppe (Pino) Berlini. 
  Alberto Grotti, a former Eni deputy chairman facing charges 
in the separate Eni-Sai kickbacks case, was also named. Also 
cited was Mauro Giallombardo, a former Socialist Euro-MP whose 
Luxembourg and Swiss accounts were allegedly used as payment 
conduits. 
  The League's former treasurer Alessandro Patelli was named 
along with the man he and others allegedly received the money 
from, Marcello Portesi. 
  Leading prosecutor Antonio Di Pietro has claimed the 
Enimont-linked payments were divided into three phases: bribes 
to obtain tax breaks at its inception, payments to extricate 
Montedison at the highly favourable price of 2.8 trillion lire, 
and further payments to secure the benevolence of parties with 
whom ex-Ferruzzi supremo, the late Raul Gardini, had realised he 
must come to terms. 
  Di Pietro was unable to convince Cusani to come clean on the 
final destination of more than 100 billion of the Enimont and 
related kickbacks. Cusani said he delivered the bulk of this 
sum back to Gardini, but was unable to prove this. 
  Gardini committed suicide in July last year just three days 
after the jail suicide of former ENI chairman Gabriele Cagliari 
and just ahead of detention warrants for himself, Sama, 
Garofano, and Cusani. 
  The closing page of the 63-page request to bring the 37 to 
trial referred to "serious evidence" against all those under 
investigation accumulated through confessions made by many of 
them and the findings brought to light during the Cusani trial, 
"which have been fully appended to the present request." 
  The document also recalled that in his prosecution 
statements at the Cusani trial, Di Pietro reported that 
investigators could not track down an individual who received 
"the alleged billion lire coming from the Enimont bribe and 
going to the Italian Communist Party." Thus, the public 
prosecutors office will pursue this end of the investigation 
"for a complete reconstruction of the episode and to ascertain 
possible responsibility." 
  The investigation will also be continued in an attempt to 
pin 
down the identities of other people who received Enimont 
kickbacks, especially unknown persons who laid hands on more 
than 1.5 million dollars delivered by Bisignani in dollars to 
Christian Democrats of the time in the faction led by Giulio 
Andreotti, seven-times premier and now senator for life. 
  Forlani, said the request, is wanted to stand trial for 
acting in complicity with Citaristi and Enrico Boreatti, named 
as an official in the administration of the old Christian 
Democratic Party, for allegedly taking four billion 750 million 
lire (nearly three million dollars) in installments from 
Gardini, Sama and Garofano. The former head of the ex-Christian 
Democratic Party was also named in connection with another four 
billion lire in bribes doled out by Grotti, the former deputy 
chairman of the ENI. 
  Named in connection with Bossi were Patelli, the former 
League administrative chief, and Poresi, the past head of 
Montedison external relations. The request said ahead of the 
April 1992 general election, in which the League rose to 
national prominence on a protest vote, "Bossi and Patelli 
received from Sergio Cusani and Carlo Sama, at the time of the 
electoral campaign for the 1992 general election, the sum of 200 
million lire (materially paid by Marcello Portesi)...." 
  With his arrest by Clean Hands magistrates, Patelli became 
the first official of the League to be linked with the business 
and political corruption so strongly decried by the separatist 
movement. 
  According to the document covering the indictments sought, 
part of the flood of Enimont bribery funds was allocated as 
follows: 200 million to Altissimo, a former leader of the tiny 
government party; 200 million to Bossi; 8.5 billion (5.3 million 
dollars) to Citaristi; 8.5 billion to Forlani; some 11 billion 
(nearly 7 million dollars) to Craxi; 100 million to De Michelis; 
500 million to Martelli; 300 million to La Malfa; 100 million to 
Pillitteri; five billion lire to Cirino Pomicino. 
  The investigations said all these and other sums to others 
were intended for the political parties but that they were not 
written into the parties' balance sheets. Thus, the host of 
politicians cited are wanted for appearances in the dock on the 
charge of violations of the law on the public financing of 
political parties.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Berlusconi -- Biography"] </F>
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 28 -- The mandate handed today to 
Berlusconi comes just four months after the media tycoon decided 
to switch gears from private enterprise to politics, a move he 
announced in a recorded statement on his own Rete Quattro 
television station on January 26. "I do not want to live in an 
illiberal country," the chairman of Fininvest told Italians, 
adding, in a sports metaphor that would become his signature 
during the campaign, that he had decided to "enter the game" 
because he believed the country was "governed by immature powers 
and by people tightly bound to a past which has been a failure 
on a political and economical plane." 
  Berlusconi, 57, who abandoned the helm of one of Italy's 
biggest private industrial groups to mount his Forza Italia (Go 
Italy) electoral campaign, had been testing the political waters 
for some time before that announcement. He said he thought 
someone had to present a "viable" conservative alternative to 
the coalition of Progressives led by the Left Democrat Party 
(formerly the Italian Communist Party), a coalition the 
businessman defined as "Communist." 
  When he founded Forza Italia, Berlusconi handed over to 
Fedele Confalonieri, Fininvest's number two, the chairmanship 
(but not the ownership) of a conglomerate which operates in the 
television, advertising publishing, supermarket, insurance and 
building sectors, generating net earnings of 10.5 trillion lire 
(6.2 billion dollars) in 1992. He also owns the winning AC 
Milan football club, which after Wednesday night's [27 April] 
game is headed for its fourth European Cup final in six years. 
  With a considerable debt burden, the Fininvest empire 
chalked 
up industrial and financial current account losses for the first 
time ever in 1992. Losses were due mainly to interest payments 
of 738 billion lire (434 million dollars) on debts of 4.5 
trillion lire (2.6 billion dollars). Net capital stood at 1.078 
trillion lire (634 million dollars). 
  The question of how to separate Berlusconi's political role 
from the influence of his media empire continues to be a vexing 
one for Italian politics, with no firm solution to the problem 
yet clear. 
  The son of a bank employee, Berlusconi began his 
entrepreneurial career in 1962 at the age of 25, immediately 
showing a flair for business and for threading the bureaucratic 
and political red tape that quickly launched him on the Italian 
business scene and propelled him into the ranks of the world's 
richest men. 
  His first company, the Cantieri Riuniti Milanesi, was 
responsible for building a housing complex for 4,000 people at 
Brugherio, on the outskirts of Milan. From there, he expanded 
to the Milano 2 and Milano 3 housing developments for 10,000 and 
then 15,000 people, then turned his sights from construction to 
media. 
  In mid-1979, Berlusconi entered the commercial television 
field with Telemilano, a local station in Milan. A few months 
later he took a quantum leap with Canale 5, the first private 
television station to broadcast to a national audience. 
  A Constitutional Court decision in 1980 to allow private 
channels to transmit over national airwaves opened up new 
horizons for "Sua Emittenza" (Lord Broadcaster) who went on to 
buy up Italia 1 in 1983 and Rete 4 in 1984. 
  A bid to enter the French television world in 1984 proved 
difficult and finally collapsed in 1989, but he had more success 
in Spain where he bought up a 25 percent stake in Antenna 3 in 
1989. 
  Berlusconi's 1984 purchase of SORRISI E CANZONI TV (TV 
Smiles 
and Songs) magazine, today Italy's largest circulation 
publication, marked his entry into the publishing world. In 
1988, he took a 25 percent stake in Amef, the company which 
controlled the Mondadori publishing group. 
  Things went far from smoothly there, when Berlusconi found 
himself locked in combat with Carlo de Benedetti, the Olivetti 
chief, who was forced to back down in 1990, when Berlusconi 
became chairman of Mondadori, keeping the influential PANORAMA 
news weekly but losing the L'ESPRESSO-LA REPUBBLICA group to De 
Benedetti. 
  In a move this month, part of Berlusconi's promised 
paring-back of his industrial empire now that his main concern 
is politics, Fininvest announced that its shareholding in 
Mondadori be reduced to less than 50 percent in a complex 
capital operation. 
  Legal hassles have dogged Berlusconi, who in the 1980's 
found 
himself dragged into the scandal over the clandestine Propaganda 
Due (P-2) Masonic lodge, of which he was a member. He denied 
ever having played an active role in the outlawed lodge, but 
found himself charged with perjury in connection with the 
inquiries. 
  The late 1980's also saw him doing battle with the RAI state 
broadcasting company which sued him for unfair competition and 
unauthorised use of live broadcasting. The issue of who was 
permitted to broadcast live was cleared up with a new 
broadcasting law which many saw as tailored for the Milan 
magnate. 
  According to his detractors, Berlusconi's close personal 
friendship with disgraced Socialist Party chief Bettino Craxi, 
who was premier when the new broadcasting law was being drawn 
up, smoothed the tycoon's path in this and other areas. 
  Berlusconi's party, Forza Italia, started its life as a 
think-tank to test the political waters and do the groundwork 
for his change of career. Forza Italia linked up with the 
federalist Northern League in the north of the country, and with 
the National Alliance, heir to the neofascist Italian Social 
Movement in the south, in two- and three-way Freedom Front 
coalitions that gained the majority in the March 27-28 general 
elections. (The Front won an absolute majority in the Lower 
House, but a relative one in the Senate.) 
  With a roster of faces fresh to national politics (95 
percent 
of candidates had never sat in the Rome parliament before), 
Forza Italia took 95 seats in the Lower House and 41 in the 
Senate, less than its Freedom Front partners, making it 
parliament's third biggest force. The biggest percentage of the 
popular ballot, however, went to Berlusconi's party. 
  Forza Italia, and Berlusconi in particular, fought the 
election battle on a "red peril" stance, warning the nation of 
the possible dangers of control of the economy falling to the 
former Communists of the Left Democratic Party. 
  But it was the novelty offered by Forza Italia and the 
popularity of Berlusconi himself which seemed to win the new 
line-up most votes in a country jaded by scandals in the 
political and economic worlds, scandals in which Berlusconi and 
his empire have so far managed to remain unscathed.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Bios of Berlusconi's Three `Wise </F>
Men'"] 
  [Excerpt] (ANSA) Rome, April 28 -- Antonio La Pergola, 
Giorgio Crisci and Agostino Gambino are the three "wise men" 
that Premier-designate Silvio Berlusconi today named to act as 
guarantors that his business interests in no way conflict with 
his public office. 
  La Pergola, who was born in Catania, Sicily, on November 13, 
1931, was president of the Constitutional Court from July 2, 
1986 to June 14, 1987 and community policies minister in the De 
Mita and Goria governments. On March 25, 1994, the outgoing 
Ciampi government named him as the 13th judge on the European 
Court of Justice. In addition to teaching constitutional law at 
the universities of Padua, Bologna and Rome, La Pergola has also 
been a member of the Council of Magistrates. In 1989 he was 
elected to the European Parliament. 
  Crisci, born in Rome on January 23, 1923, is a lawyer and 
president of the Council of State. He has served as president 
of TAR [Regional Administrative Tribunal] in Sicily and as a 
juridical advisor and cabinet chief in various ministries. He 
is the author of numerous judicial studies. 
  Gambino was born in Genoa on July 6, 1933 and is a professor 
of commercial law at the La Sapienza University of Rome. He has 
served on a panel made up of representatives of the government 
and the Holy See to oversee relations between the Vatican Bank 
(IOR) and the Banco Ambrosiano and on a panel the government 
formed in July 1992 to oversee the liquidation of Federconsorzi.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Milan Clean Hands Team Will Remain </F>
Intact"] 
  [Excerpt] (ANSA) Milan, April 30 -- Milan assistant 
prosecutor Antonio Di Pietro, who holds celebrity status in 
Italy through his battle against political and business 
corruption, will not join the new cabinet as interior minister 
and the Clean Hands team whose investigations devastated the 
nation's old ruling parties will remain intact, said chief 
prosecutor Francesco Saverio Borrelli. 
  In an official statement issued today, Borrelli referred to 
the flurry of speculation in the nation's press on the chances 
that premier-designate Silvio Berlusconi might lure Di Pietro 
into his cabinet to take on the sensitive interior portfolio. 
  The chief prosecutor said, "in relation to press reports of 
ideas of ministerial posts or other duties proposed to them," Di 
Pietro and assistant public prosecutor Piercamillo Davigo are 
honored by having their names linked to "functions of extremely 
high prestige" but are saying they cannot now abandon their 
posts with the Milan prosecutors office. 
  Borrelli also reported in his official statement that he had 
dropped his own request to be named chief justice of the Milan 
appeals court. 
  Speaking off the cuff, the magistrate said, "No one among us 
considers he is indispensable or cannot be replaced but it is 
good to save the unity of the operating team which worked for 
over two years on this difficult investigation. Especially at 
this time, when there are prospects of weakening the judiciary, 
a change in the line-up could reduce the effectiveness of 
operative unity." 
  In December, Borrelli took part in a competition for the top 
job on the Milan appeals bench left vacant by the transfer of 
chief justice Piero Paiardi to the Supreme Court of Cassation. 
His decision to withdraw his name means there will be no change 
in the management of the Milan public prosecutors office. 
  Earlier, speaking for publication in a news weekly, the 
chief 
prosecutor said he was aware of "signals of tiredness and 
annoyance" coming from the public with the continuation of the 
anticorruption investigations which got under way in February 
1992. 
  "People applauded our investigations, they closed ranks 
around us, they supported us. But they were also entertained to 
see so many heads, some crowned, rolling in the dust," he added 
with reference to figures like former Socialist Party leader and 
former Premier Bettino Craxi and other powerful politicians and 
businessmen brought low by Clean Hands' disclosures. 
  "As the investigations reached increasingly high levels in 
political and public administration spheres, endemic bitterness 
against the powerful was satisfied. But this was not a thirst 
for justice, only a thirst for revenge," said Borrelli. 
  He went on to speak of a need for an "authentic aspiration 
for legality" at all levels and insisted that the "renewal of 
ethics must begin with the individual, with each of us. This 
cannot be delegated." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Ciampi on Privatization and Lira"] </F>
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 29 -- The ongoing process of 
privatization in Italy is "a reality in continual evolution and 
it is right that it be debated upon even for the general rules 
for joint stock companies" outgoing Italian premier Carlo 
Azeglio Ciampi said here Friday [29 April] at a press conference 
called to review his year in office. 
  The former bank of Italy governor went on to state that he 
had no intention of getting involved in the polemics, 
highlighted in the press, over the recent privatization of Comit 
[Italian Commercial Bank]. 
  However, in answer to charges that Banca Commerciale 
Italiano 
had been taken over by a small "hard-core" of stockholders, 
Ciampi recalled how while 20 percent of shareholders had, 
indeed, organized, "there always remains 80 percent of 
shareholders which can organize and find the ways and means to 
do so. 
  Turning his attention to monetary matters, Premier Ciampi 
expressed his hope that the lira would return to the European 
Monetary System (EMS) as quickly as possible. 
  "In 1992" he recalled, "the EMS suffered a crisis much worse 
than that of the lira" adding how for "national pride 
adjustments had not previously been made to parities which would 
have avoided the increase in rates." 
  Looking at the independence of the Bank of Italy Ciampi 
stated how in his fourteen years at the head of the central bank 
he had always fought to boost its independence which was 
achieved "starting in 1981 when the Bank of Italy was no longer 
obliged to purchase unsold state paper put up for auction and 
ended with its freedom to set the discount rate."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Investment To Rise in 1995, ISCO </F>
Says"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 30 -- Investment will flourish in 
1995, after remaining fairly stable overall in 1994, according 
to a report from the short-term economic trends study institute 
ISCO [National Institute for the Study of the Economic 
Situation], released Saturday [30 April]. 
  This year will see a rise in the amounts ploughed back into 
medium-sized companies for investment purposes but small and 
large industry will continue to languish, pushing the overall 
figure down by about 1.9 percent, said ISCO in its six-month 
report. 
  This figure is fairly healthy when compared with the 13.5 
percent drop chalked up in 1993, said ISCO, adding that the 
average fall in investments last year across the European Union 
stood at around 12 percent. 
  An ISCO poll showed that two-thirds of companies questioned 
said that they planned to step up investments next year, with 
large-sized firms leading the field.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Economic Report for 1993 Presented"] </F>
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 28 -- Budget Minister Luigi 
Spaventa and Treasury Minister Piero Barucci today presented 
parliament with their three-volume report on the economy in 1993 
which highlighted how last year the gross domestic product [GDP] 
fell, the number of jobs shrank drastically, the wages were at a 
standstill, inflation dipped while there was a major improvement 
in Italy's balance of payments. 
  In brief, the 685-page report stated how, at the end of year 
and the first months this year: 

  -  The GDP fell 0.7 percent, 
in line with the world-wide recession, the first decline since 
1875. 
  -  Employment: the number of jobs shrank by 655,000 units, 
equal to a decline of 2.8 percent. 
  -  Salaries: the trend for 
salaries and wages showed drastically and rose by 3.1 percent, 
below the rate of inflation. 
  -  Labor costs: the rapport of units 
per product rose by 1.6 percent compared to 3.8 percent in 
1992. 
  -  Public finance: spending needs stood at 153 trillion lire, 
equal to 9.8 percent of the GDP; the goal had been 151.2 
trillion lire. 
  -  Inflation: the inflation rate declined to 4.5 
percent, against 5.2 percent in 1991, one of the lowest levels 
since the early 1970s. 
  -  Balance of payments: a surplus for the 
first time since the start of the year, 32.511 trillion lire, 
with exports up 20 percent and imports off 0.2 percent. 
  -  Discount 
rate: between the end of 1992 and February 1994 it was reduced 
eight times, falling from 12 percent to 7.5 percent. 
  -  State 
paper: interest on BTP [multi-year treasury bond], for the same 
period, fell 3.8 points, dropping to 8.3 percent net. Rates for 
BOT [treasury bills] fell to 7.7 percent, from 12.2 percent at 
the end of 1992.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Three Parties Forced Into Single </F>
Parliamentary Caucus"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 28 -- Three smaller parties that 
do not have enough seats in the Lower House to form separate 
groups will be forced to join a single so-called mixed group 
because the speaker's office on Thursday [28 April] turned down 
their applications to form separate ones. 
  The Socialist and Democratic Alliance parties each have 15 
Lower House deputies while the Pact for Italy has 13, all below 
the 20-member floor limit for the formation of a separate group 
under the current rules. 
  The three parties ran separately in the March elections (in 
some constituencies with the progressives) and are not keen to 
be forced into a single caucus and risk being seen by public 
opinion as interchangeable.

  In the mixed group are seven life senators, six from 
Democratic Alliance, three from SVP and one each from UV, the 
Magris Slate and the Alpine League. 
  Democratic Alliance, the Socialist Party and the Pact for 
Italy had all asked that smaller parliamentary groups be allowed 
to form but this request was turned down today by those 
representing the majority forces, sparking protests from members 
of the opposition. 
  Socialist Gino Giugni, for one, said it was hard to 
understand the logic of a stance which forces the opposition 
into "an artificial compactness." As to the future, Giugni 
announced plans to forge a single group with Democratic 
Alliance, also in view of coming European elections. 
  For Luciana Sbarbati, a Republican elected on the Democratic 
Alliance ticket, the majority, in refusing to allow the 
formation of smaller groups, was putting its worst foot forward, 
giving the impression of a bullying and vengeful rightwing 
"suspicious of any form of democratic pluralism."

<F P=106> [Article by Carlos Segovia] </F>
  [Text] Brussels--The European Commission, which is headed 
by France's Jacques Delors, believes that the Community, Spain 
included, has weathered the worst of the recession, but its 
short-term projections for the Spanish economy are less 
optimistic than those the government set forth in the budget 
bill. 
  The Community executive will approve tomorrow (Wednesday) 
its 
Annual Economic Report, which as usual includes short- and 
medium-term economic and social forecasts for all member states, 
including Spain. 
  The document, prepared by the staff of commissioner for 
economic and financial affairs Henning Christophersen, takes a 
positive view of measures taken to reform the Spanish labor 
market but believes they will need more time to bear fruit. 
  Initially, it expects business and industry to take 
advantage 
of labor's greater flexibility to complete workforce downsizing, 
and this will add to the state's financial burden by putting 
more people on the unemployment rolls. 
  "In the short term, it may exacerbate unemployment, adding 
to 
the cost of social services. However, in the medium term, there 
is hope for improved competitiveness, higher levels of 
investment, and creation of new jobs," says the five-page 
chapter devoted to Spain, to which DIARIO 16 obtained access. 
  In its review of the Spanish economy, it described as 
"optimistic" the government's avowed goal of keeping the fiscal 
deficit at 6.4 percent of Gross Domestic Product [GDP], "unless 
there is significant economic recovery." 
  Economic experts in Brussels say one of the biggest problems 
is resistance to the need to cut social spending. 
  However painful it may be, says the report, "the deficit 
demands a reevaluation of social spending in light of the 
country's financial capacity, and more selective access to 
welfare benefits." 
  Also, the commission notes that decentralization is impeding 
the central government's efforts to directly influence the 
deficits run at regional and (most importantly) local levels, 
i.e., the municipalities. 
  "It would be appropriate to improve coordination between the 
various levels of government," says the aforementioned report in 
its chapter on Spain. 
  The Spanish economy's competitive position improved in 1993 
with devaluation of the peseta (13 percent against the German 
mark), but it would have been even better if accompanied by 
greater restraint in wage increases. (The effects of 
devaluation) "were somewhat attenuated by the poor behavior of 
the labor market." 
  Brussels experts fear that the recent amelioration of 
inflation, which stood at 4.6 percent last year, cannot 
continue. "It cannot be taken as certain that the progress in 
dampening inflation will continue in 1994. The impact of the 
peseta's devaluation on domestic prices, combined with a 
recovery in demand, may push prices up again. Prospects will 
continue to deteriorate without better wage restraint." 
  The report opines, however, that Community economies overall 
have "succeeded in weathering the worst of the recession," even 
if "the most recent indicators offer scant evidence for a rapid 
recovery." 
  For example, the commission report says that GDP in the EU 
will grow by 1.3 percent this year. Unemployment will rise by 
0.5 percent to 11.5 percent of the work force. 
  Average inflation will be 3.5 percent, versus 3.8 percent 
last year. The European Commission says growth in 1995 will be 
2.1 percent and there will be a net increase in number of jobs 
(+0.2 percent).

  [Text] Madrid--The secretary general for employment, Marcos 
Pena, announced yesterday that the government this week will 
complete the work of drawing up a package of incentives for 
hiring the long-term unemployed and jobless persons over age 45; 
he also said the latter will be exempt from Social Security 
payroll contributions for a period between one and three years. 
  Marcos Pena, who participated in a Eurotraining workshop on 
Spain's labor reform, said some 500,000 persons will benefit 
from the new measures, though he admitted some of the specifics 
have not yet been decided and it is still uncertain what 
juridical or administrative form the incentives will take. 
  "This initiative covers access to the labor market through 
temporary-hire contracts and subsequent conversion into a 
different status, with the possibility of retaining the current 
subventions," he added. 
  The secretary general for employment also referred to the 
announced reform of the National Employment Institute (INEM), 
which he said will be completed by early summer and will consist 
in reorienting the agency to focus primarily on population 
groups that have greatest difficulty gaining access to the labor 
market (those older than 40-45 years of age, young people, and 
long-term unemployed). 
  Marcos Pena expressed "moderate satisfaction" with the 
"success" of the new contract categories that went into effect 
at the first of the year, with 1,500 apprenticeship contracts 
having been signed to date and some 200,000 part-time workers 
signed on in the first quarter of the year. 
  In his opinion, it is necessary to establish some 
relationship between unemployment outlays and benefits derived, 
such that subsidies can offset the lack of income and job and 
enable the jobless person to search actively for new employment, 
but all without sacrificing the "financial solvency" of the 
unemployment and pension systems. 
  During the same proceedings Angel Laborda, director general 
for projections and trends at the Ministry of Economic Affairs, 
predicted the labor reform would, among other things, make net 
job creation possible with a lower overall rate of economic 
growth--2 percent, instead of 2.5 or 3 percent, the current 
growth threshold for job creation. The comparable figure for the 
European Union as a whole is 1.5 percent. 
  Speaking in a personal capacity, Laborda said that although 
unemployment will diminish "significantly" in the next few 
years, it will continue to be "a serious problem for economic 
policy." 
  He discussed two possible scenarios for trends in 
unemployment between now and the year 2000. 
  In the first scenario, assuming the Gross Domestic Product 
(GDP) grows by 4 percent annually and 300,000 jobs per year are 
created, unemployment by the year 2000 will be no more than 2.5 
million--a result which he admitted will be difficult to achieve. 
  The other scenario assumes economic growth of 3.2 percent 
annually and creation of 325,000 work positions per year, which 
would reduce the unemployment rate to 18 percent of the work 
force. 
  The economic affairs minister underscored the 
"insensitivity" 
of wage levels to fluctuations in the economy. 
  In that connection, he emphasized that business and industry 
have little leeway to reward outstanding job performance or to 
adjust costs with cyclical economic fluctuations, because of the 
high percentage of payroll outlays earmarked for fixed 
compensation.

<F P=106> [Article by Ricardo de Querol] </F>
  [Text] The Bank of Spain seems to favor new cuts in 
unemployment benefits on grounds that in amount and duration 
they are currently still "relatively generous in Spain, despite 
the fact we have the highest unemployment in the European Union." 
  A study of protective coverage for the jobless published in 
the central bank's most recent economic bulletin says "Spain's 
welfare benefits are among the highest in the European 
Community." 
  The report says that continuing with the present system of 
benefits "will not eliminate certain general and inherent 
problems," including the apparent indifference of unemployed 
Spaniards to finding a job, the onerous fiscal burden the 
situation imposes on the state, and the high cost to employers 
of personnel-related overhead. All these tendencies seem to 
become more pronounced in times of recession, says the bank, 
which is headed by Luis Angel Rojo. 
  The central bank points out that due to a substantial 
augmentation of protective coverage during the last years of the 
economic boom, economic authorities were forced to introduce 
cutbacks later on. 
  Without expressly arguing for new cuts, the article makes 
clear that those already made are not enough to dispel 
uncertainties about the future. 
  In 1992, a decree-law known as the "decretazo" reduced 
unemployment payments from 80 to 70 percent of prior wage level, 
at the same time as it shortened maximum duration of payments 
from one-half to one-third of the time that the worker had been 
contributing to the unemployment insurance system. 
  Just three months ago, the 1994 budget companion measures 
included a reduction of the minimum unemployment benefit to 70 
percent of minimum wage for jobless persons without dependents, 
whereas earlier the floor had been set at 100 percent. 
  Moreover, beginning this year, jobless persons have been 
required to contribute to Social Security [out of their 
unemployment benefits] and pay income tax on those subventions. 
  But the Bank of Spain argues that unemployment benefits in 
Spain are still too generous. 
  "The problem lies in having a level of protection that 
covers 
the contingency of unemployment without downward pressures to 
contain costs. In the case of Spain, it does not appear that 
this critical factor of cost containment has been realized, and 
maintaining the system is very costly" in this respect, the 
report asserts. 
  "The high level of unemployment makes it all the more 
difficult to efficiently manage available resources--inadequate 
as they usually are--and to keep INEM [National Employment 
Institute] running on a sound financial basis," the report 
continues. 
  In the central bank's opinion, the high ratio of jobless to 
workers "presupposes substantial financing from sources external 
to the system itself." 
  The report compares unemployment protection in Spain with 
the 
rest of the European Union, a comparison that shows systems vary 
substantially from one country to another. 
  For example, a head of family in Holland may collect as much 
as 99 percent of his previous salary, and in Denmark up to 90 
percent. On the other hand, in Greece the figure is 40 percent 
and in Ireland only 35 percent, for unmarried persons. In Italy, 
surprisingly, the portion of prior wage an unemployed person can 
collect varies from as low as 20 percent to as high as 80 
percent. 
  Many countries in the Union have systems in which benefits 
are determined by a complex calculation factoring in the age of 
the unemployed person, sectoral agreements, etc., while in some 
countries the amount of benefit does not even depend on the wage 
the beneficiary had been paid. In some countries the unemployed 
pay taxes, and in others they do not. Many countries, Spain 
among them, vary the amount of benefits according to the size of 
the jobless person's family. 
  Only Belgium maintains payments from a 
contribution-supported 
unemployment insurance fund indefinitely; in other states, 
insurance benefits are eventually exhausted and 
replaced--usually by welfare allotments, i.e., payments that 
bear no relation to earlier contributions to the insurance fund. 
The report concedes that unemployed Spaniards are disadvantaged 
in two respects: the minimum pay-in period before eligibility 
for benefits, and housing assistance. 
  Spain is among the countries that require employees to have 
worked the longest time before being entitled to benefits from 
the contributive plan, and it is one of the few countries, along 
with Greece and Portugal, that provides no housing assistance. 
<H5>  Spanish Employers Pay Highest Employee Taxes in European </H5>
Union 
  Spanish employers pay proportionally more into the national 
unemployment protection system than their counterparts elsewhere 
in the European Union. Employers in all Community countries 
contribute more to the fund than employees, but in the case of 
Spain the employer contribution is quintuple that of workers 
(5.6:1, to be precise). 
  This is a much higher ratio than obtains in the countries 
that followed Spain into the Community--Greece (3:1), Ireland 
(2.5:1), and Portugal (2.2:1). In Germany, employers and workers 
contribute equally to the financing of unemployment subsidies. 
  Despite INEM's large deficits, our country's system is not 
one of the most heavily state-financed. In countries such as 
Denmark, Ireland, Holland, and France, public subventions 
contribute more to financing of the system than do employer and 
employee withholdings, while in the United Kingdom and Portugal, 
the state's contribution is only just enough to cover any 
deficit. 
  Of course, Spain is experiencing a higher rate of 
unemployment than any other Community country--in fact, ours is 
twice as high as the Community average of slightly over 10 
percent. 
  Spain has an additional liability: A relatively smaller 
percentage of its total population is in the work force, 
primarily because of the still very limited assimilation of 
women into the labor market.

<F P=106> [Column by Sedat Sertoglu: "Injustice to Turkey"] </F>
  [Text] The Clinton Administration's opposition to Turkey's 
wish to withdraw the oil in the Turkey-Iraq pipeline, which has 
remained untouched for two years now, is a "serious injustice to 
our country." That is the mildest way the matter can be 
explained. The injustice that has been done to Turkey can be 
clearly observed if the developments on the matter are listed in 
chronological order as follows: 
  1. Turkey discussed the withdrawal of the oil in the 
pipeline and the prevention of corrosion in the installations 
with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Oxman when he visited 
Ankara some time ago. Deputy Prime Minister Murat Karayalcin 
also held talks on the matter when he visited the United States. 
Meanwhile, the officials of the two countries discussed the 
matter in their bilateral talks. In other words, Turkey 
indicated that it does not intend to take any secret action on 
the matter. 
  2. However, the Clinton Administration refrained from 
responding to Turkey's appeals each and every time they were 
made. 
  3. The last time the matter was discussed was when Prime 
Minister Ciller visited Washington. Considering Washington's 
reluctance to express its opinion, Turkey informed the U.S. 
Administration again that it will launch a limited operation to 
save the pipeline. Turkey was right because the United States 
has condoned Jordan's behavior, which conflicts with the 
requirements of the embargo on Iraq. King Husayn has been able 
to sell anything he wishes to that country. However, Turkey has 
been the country that has suffered most from the embargo. 
  4. It was at about that time that Ambassador Richard Barkley 
discussed the matter with Under Secretary of Defense Frank 
Wisner and Assistant Secretary of Defense Charles Freeman when 
he held talks with them after the downing of two helicopters 
over northern Iraq. 
  5. That was when the United States brought up the question 
of the oil pipeline, as if it were the first time the United 
States had become aware of that issue. The U.S. officials 
insisted that the embargo on Iraq must not be violated. 
Ambassador Barkley informed Wisner and Freeman that he would 
contact Ankara and brief them on the matter later. 
  6. In his first message to Washington, Ambassador Barkley 
said that Turkey did not plan to violate the embargo. He also 
explained that, although the U.S. side was informed, Washington 
has not conveyed the proposals it promised to Ankara. 
  7. However, we have ascertained that the messages Ambassador 
Barkley conveyed to Washington later claimed that Turkey had 
made an effort to unilaterally violate the embargo on Iraq. His 
messages made Washington feel very uneasy. 
  8. While Ambassador Nuzhet Kandemir prepared to convey 
Turkey's official reply to the U.S. Administration in 
Washington, Ambassador Barkley called on the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs to complain. 
  9. The Turkish and U.S. officials discussed the matter for 
the last time in New York. Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin 
informed Ambassador Albright that Turkey will not use the funds 
that will be raised from the sale of the oil in the pipeline. 
He gave Jordan as an example. Ambassador Albright informed him 
that the U.S. Administration will reply to Turkey in seven days. 
  10. Meanwhile, the Turkish officials were aware that 
Ambassador Barkley conveyed unfavorable reports to Washington 
against Turkey. They were also aware of the exaggerated views he 
conveyed for the U.S. State Department's Human Rights Report. 
Meanwhile, it has been claimed that the way he expressed 
himself in reports he sent to Washington on the Kurds in Turkey 
prompted the Clinton Administration to place the concept of a 
political solution to the Kurdish problem on its agenda. 
  Turkey made an effort to hold talks with the U.S. 
Administration, the White House, and other U.S. establishments 
on several problems during the past year. It brought up those 
problems even during luncheons. However, Ankara has been 
surprised by the way the Clinton Administration has insisted on 
not understanding Turkey's position. I wonder whether the 
situation would have been different if Ambassador Barkley had 
taken the time to consider the matter before he conveyed 
messages to Washington? In fact, I believe that things would 
have been different. 
  It is a fact that Ambassador Barkley stands to gain nothing 
from the existing tension in relations between Turkey and the 
United States. As an ambassador who has disrupted relations 
between the two countries, he may find it difficult to secure a 
position in the U.S. State Department when he returns to 
Washington at the end of his tour in Ankara. 
  Meanwhile, the tense relations may lead to an "economic 
threat" against Turkey. I would not like to be the person 
blamed for that state of affairs. 
  That is a friendly warning while there is still time.

<F P=106> [Article by Coskun Kirca: "Clinton, the Greeks, and the </F>
Turks"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The UN secretary general has 
changed the confidence-building measures [CBM's]. For example, 
according to the original CBM's, the Greek Cypriots would have 
been able to enter and leave Maras [Varosha] through a road 
passing through and under the control of the Turkish Republic of 
Northern Cyprus [TRNC]. After the change, the road will be 
under the control of the United Nations. This proposal is 
unacceptable both the TRNC and to Turkey, because it upsets the 
balance of equal interest in the package by removing entry and 
exit from Maras from the control of the TRNC. It is obvious 
that Turkey is not going to trust Mr. Butrus-Ghali in such a 
vital matter. [passage omitted] 
  Another change involves the use of Lefkosa [Nicosia] Airport 
by Greek Cypriot planes. Originally, that airport was to be 
used only by the TRNC as an advantage to counter the handing 
over of Maras to the United Nations. By changing that clause, 
Mr. Butrus-Ghali will enable the Greek Cypriots to fly 
everywhere using Lefkosa Airport because they have air 
transportation agreements with numerous states. On the other 
hand, TRNC planes will be able to fly only to places the United 
Nations will allow them to. It is very doubtful that such 
permission will be given or that serious efforts will be made to 
give such permission. 
  Under another change, the United Nations and not the TRNC 
will collect the customs taxes in the terminal to be opened on 
the Turkish Cypriot side of Lefkosa Airport. This change can 
only serve to push the TRNC toward not considering itself a 
"state." 
  Finally, while the UN secretary general first proposed that 
the measures concerning Maras and Lefkosa Airport be implemented 
simultaneously, he now says that the measures regarding Maras be 
implemented immediately. Since it will take a year to repair 
Lefkosa Airport, this means the Greek Cypriots will start to 
benefit from the package a year earlier. It is impossible to 
accept such inequality. 
  Apparently, Mr. Clinton wants us to make Denktas agree to 
these proposals! 
  The same Mr. Clinton apparently also wants the Greek 
Orthodox 
Patriarchate in Istanbul to have the means to fulfill its true 
function! What is the true function of the Patriarchate 
according to Mr. Clinton? It is not very clear. If there is a 
legal truth that Mr. Clinton should learn by heart it is that 
under the Lausanne Treaty, Turkey clearly undertook to enable 
the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate to fulfill its religious duties. 
Even without that particular clause of the Treaty, secular 
Turkey would have granted all the religious liberties and the 
liberty of conscience to that institution. Turkey does not have 
to and will not grant it anything more than that. 
  Turkey is certainly not afraid to allow repairs to the 
broken 
down wall of the Patriarchate. Nor is it afraid to allow the 
reopening of the Heybeliada Clerical School. Will a few 
thousand Greeks revert Istanbul's conquest? Nor is Turkey 
intimidated by the merely protocol-affecting results of the fact 
that the Patriarchate is known as the theoretical "first among 
equals" -- even though it has no de facto power over the other 
Greek Orthodox churches. The patriarch's "ecumenical," that is, 
universal, aspect is thus merely religious and not valid in any 
other field. 
  Turkey is not afraid of any of those things and it does not 
oppose the fulfillment of the Patriarchate's religious 
obligations. However, if Turkey gives up defending the balance 
of interest and rights set up by the Lausanne Treaty, that would 
mean giving up its own identity in the international field. 
While the rights of the Turkish minority are violated in 
Western Thrace in every field, and mainly in the religious 
field, it is inconceivable for Turkey to allow the wall of the 
Patriarchate to be repaired, let alone to let the Heybeliada 
Clerical School to reopen. If it did that, Turkey would be 
betraying its brothers in Western Thrace and denying its own 
identity. 
  Mr. Clinton must be reminded of these things. Turkey cannot 
accept having Mr. Clinton stand before it like a Greek lawyer 
who ignores the Greek cruelty in Western Thrace. Furthermore, it 
is in the high interests of his own country for Mr. Clinton to 
give up this foolishness. 
  The prime minister did the right thing when she agreed to 
sign a standby agreement with the IMF. Such an agreement will 
be an economic confidence-increasing measures both in Turkey and 
abroad. However, if Mr. Clinton thinks that Turkey's current 
difficulties make it absolutely dependent on the United States 
and on IMF, and that this situation can enable the United States 
to demand humiliating and unfair concessions from Turkey in any 
field, he is very wrong. 
  The measures Turkey must take to end its economic crisis are 
the same as those the IMF will recommend. Anyway, after Turkey 
takes these measures, private international banks will consider 
aiding Turkey a profitable business. Given that situation, 
Turkey does not have to make concessions either to Mr. Clinton 
or to the Greeks for whom he seems to be acting like a lawyer. 
  The person who must come to his senses is Mr. Clinton 
himself. In recent years, certain people occupying very high 
positions but unable to fulfill their promises to the United 
States created the impression in that country that Turkey can 
agree to anything, even to be turned into a federation. This 
impression is wrong. Turkey would not sell its identity. 
Turkey would not make undignified, unequal concessions. Nobody 
could do that on Turkey's behalf, because the crushing majority 
of the Turkish parliament and even more crushing majority of the 
Turkish nation would take that person down. 
  Mr. Clinton should realize the following: One of the reasons 
for the ascent of the Prosperity Party is because Turkish 
diplomacy has forgotten its traditions and accepted mishandling 
by the West. Let Mr. Clinton come to his senses. The dogmatic 
policy conducted nowadays by the West can unexpectedly discard 
Turkey from the Western world. Then -- foremost in the Middle 
East -- the balances which will be disrupted will not be of the 
kind that can be repaired by the United States. First the 
Poised Hammer will be removed from Turkey. 
  Like Bernard Lewis said, Turkey is not a country to be 
mishandled. 
  Our advice to the government is for it to be aware of these 
realities. The concessions of today, made at the expense of 
equality, will not end concessions but rather open the way for 
more concession requests. It is imperative that Turkey prevent 
the desires of the West from turning into covetousness. 
Otherwise, the conditions that Turkey will face will make 
staying in the Western world impossible. 
  This nation -- in spite of the economic crisis -- is not 
crushed nor destroyed, although millions of families in Turkey 
watch on TRT- 2 every Tuesday night -- with tears in their eyes 
-- the broken-down people of Anatolia enduring the "national 
proposals lovingly." Mr. Clinton serves us in one respect only: 
Reminding us the necessity to return to our dignity and essence.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin by Raghidah </F>
Dirgham in New York; date not given] 
  [Text] [Dirgham] Why have the Islamic states failed to 
provide tangible aid for Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Cetin] The Islamic states should do more than they have 
done so far. We criticize other organizations which only issue 
resolutions but we in the Islamic Conference Organization [ICO] 
are also giving the impression that we are only issuing 
resolutions. We should do more than that. We should take 
tangible measures. 
  [Dirgham] What kind of measures, in your view? 
  [Cetin] More financial aid, for instance, to enable 
Bosnia-Herzegovina to move toward solving some problems. We 
have frequently decided to provide such aid but we never came 
close to producing important tangible results. We repeatedly 
made pledges but no satisfactory results or measures have come 
of it. Another example of what I mean by tangible measures is 
that we should pay much attention to the current proposals for a 
permanent peace. There is talk about a four-month cease-fire to 
push the Serbs toward a peaceful settlement. In that context, 
we should draw up a plan for having the military embargo 
practically lifted if that attempt fails. 
  [Dirgham] You mean arming the Bosnian Muslims despite the 
embargo? 
  [Cetin] If the four-month cease-fire idea does not produce 
the desired results we should make an active and effective 
initiative and declare that Article 51 of the UN Charter gives 
us the right of joint defense of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Dirgham] What does Turkey want from Iraq? You call for an 
end to the oil embargo against Iraq on the one hand and you 
violate Iraqi air space to hit the Kurds in the north on the 
other, despite the fact that you are partners with the United 
States, Britain, and France in the air exclusion zone operations 
in northern Iraq. 
  [Cetin] I do not believe that there is a contradiction 
there. We have fully explained that we care about the 
territorial integrity, sovereignty, and safety of Iraq. We 
attach great importance to their continuity. Turkey has 
explained to everyone, and to whomever it may concern, that Iraq 
must remain united and that the present borders will never 
change. At the same time we believe that the Kurdish groups in 
northern Iraq should hold a dialogue with the Iraqi authorities 
to find solutions to their problems. We want that dialogue but 
the situation in northern Iraq is not stable. 
  The Iraqis have promised us that they will not take any 
measures against the Kurds but the problem is that we do not 
know and will never know which party is going to take measures 
nor do we know the nature of such measures. We do not want to 
be faced again with the problems we faced in northern Iraq. 
That is why we are a part of the operation to "provide comfort" 
for the Kurds in northern Iraq. As regards the question of 
lifting the oil embargo, our view is that the Iraqi people are 
suffering as a result of the continuation of the embargo and 
that Iraq has complied with Resolution 715 (continuous 
inspection and verification of the Iraqi war machine) but it has 
to comply with the other resolutions, particularly the one on 
the border with Kuwait, and it should clearly declare its 
acceptance of Kuwait as an independent sovereign state in order 
to leave no pretext for preventing the lifting of the oil 
embargo. 
  [Dirgham] There is a disagreement or difference between 
the position of Turkey and that of the Gulf states regarding the 
question of lifting the embargo. Turkey is trying to convince 
Washington of the need to lift the embargo in implementation of 
Article 22 of Resolution 687 and for reasons connected with Iraq 
and Turkey, but the Gulf states oppose the lifting of the 
embargo. 
  [Cetin] We have explained that there is no connection 
between the Security Council resolutions and the authority in 
Iraq. It is not up to the United Nations or any state to decide 
who should run and rule Iraq. Only the Iraqis can make that 
decision. That is why we do not approve of the inclusion of 
personal aspects in the issue. We believe that there is 
commitment to the principle which is that the oil embargo on 
Iraq should be lifted. That is what we say most clearly to the 
Americans and others. There is no resolution stipulating Saddam 
Husayn (should stay or go). Furthermore, Turkey is suffering 
economically as a result of the oil embargo. We and the Iraqi 
people are being continuously punished through the embargo. 
  [Dirgham] How do American officials react to your views? 
How do you read their position? 
  [Cetin] If Iraq complies with the Security Council 
resolutions, they (the Americans) would not be able to stand in 
the way of the consequences of such a move. 
  [Dirgham] Do you mean implementation of Article 22 which 
lifts the embargo? 
  [Cetin] Yes. A number of Security Council member states, 
such as Russia and France, are more inclined toward that idea. 
Our view is basically that the oil embargo should be lifted 
when Iraq complies with the relevant resolutions. 
  [Dirgham] The general impression is that Turkey is 
committing massacres against the Kurds in northern Iraq and that 
you are exploiting the political situation to serve your own 
objectives. 
  [Cetin] That is not true. Our relations with (Mas'ud) 
Barzani and (Jalal) Talabani are very good, and we cooperate 
with them. What is happening has nothing to do with massacres. 
Some terrorist groups cross our borders, terrorize and kill 
people, and then withdraw. 
  [Dirgham] But you are burning villages and killing innocent 
people. Is that a result of the failure of the policies of the 
Kurdish leadership represented by Talabani and Barzani? 
  [Cetin] They need our cooperation and we need their 
cooperation. It is not true that we are burning villages. We 
are facing terrorist organizations. Every state has a right to 
deter terrorist practices. 
  [Dirgham] Is Syria cooperating with you to your 
satisfaction? Your relations with Syria had undergone some 
tension.... 
  [Cetin] Relations are now better than before. 
  [Dirgham] And with Iran? 
  [Cetin] We have good relations of cooperation and dialogue 
in the context of combating terrorism. We cooperate closely and 
there is an effective mechanism between officials in charge of 
security. We have very good cooperation. With Syria we have a 
general agreement and the situation is now improving. 
  [Dirgham] Do you mean that relations with Syria have 
improved but not to a satisfactory level of cooperation? What 
are the difficult problems between you? 
  [Cetin] I think we have to wait and see what tangible 
results emerge. There is information that the leader (of the 
Kurdish Workers Party) is still in the area (of al-Biqa' in 
Lebanon), but the Syrians are willing to cooperate with us. The 
Turkish interior minister visited Syria in the middle of this 
month and returned with very satisfactory results. We continue 
to tackle this problem in cooperation with our neighbors. 
  [Dirgham] What do you discuss with the Israelis, as far as 
the roles of Turkey and Israel in the region are concerned? 
Will your relations with Israel be relations of rivalry, or 
complementary? 
  [Cetin] It is not a question of rivalry. We believe that we 
have a special role to play by virtue of our close friendship 
and fraternity with the Arab states, and our relations with 
Israel are good at the same time. We seek to play an important 
part in the context of the peace process for a better future for 
the Middle East. 
  [Dirgham] Do you discuss with Israel a relationship that 
would make you share control of the region? 
  [Cetin] Not at all. We intend to cooperate with the other 
states in the region. When I met in Romania with (Palestinian 
President) Yasir 'Arafat and (Israeli Foreign Minister) Shim'on 
Peres, we agreed that it is necessary to cooperate and to ensure 
wider cooperation among all parties in the Middle East. 
  [Dirgham] It seems that Turkey has failed to have the 
influence it had hoped to have on international affairs, and you 
seem to have internal problems preventing you from achieving 
your objectives. You are weaker than Greece in the European 
context and much weaker than the Russians as far as influence in 
Caucasia is concerned. Where is Turkey's power today? 
  [Cetin] Turkey is a big state which emerged after the 
Ottoman Empire. We have historical links with the states and 
peoples of the territories which once belonged to the Ottoman 
Empire. That is why we seek to play a constructive and peaceful 
role in connection with these states. 
  [Dirgham] It has been claimed that Tansu Ciller's government 
is not strong and that there are attempts to change it. Are 
there such attempts? 
  [Cetin] No, we are a democratic state and everything is done 
on a democratic basis.

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Golhan Mehmet by Muwaffaq </F>
Madani in Ankara; date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Madani] How do you view the 
situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Mehmet] First, I would like to express our satisfaction 
with 
the NATO attack on the Serb positions. Turkey asked the 
international circles and the United Nations to interfere two 
years ago because it is impermissible for a country to occupy 
the territories of another country. The United Nations and NATO 
charters stipulate this. Aggressors have to be punished. 
  Turkey has recognized the four countries that seceded from 
old Yugoslavia, but the Serbs are attacking Bosnia. We are 
ready to help and have told the international circles that if 
your problem is a material one, then we are ready to pay our 
dues, and if the problem is the formation of an army, then we 
are ready for that, too. 
  Tens of thousands have been killed and hundreds of thousands 
have been made refugees. Blood is being shed in Bosnia, and it 
is Muslim blood. Emotional ties bind us to them and the blood 
being shed is ultimately the blood of human beings, regardless 
of their race. 
  An agreement was reached to withdraw the Serb artillery 
adjacent to Bosnia [as published] and this was done. But then 
they attacked another city and NATO was forced to attack their 
positions. We believe that this decision has come very late. 
  Anyhow, despite the tardiness of the decision, we still 
believe that it was the right one. Several decisions were made 
in the past but the Serbs did not abide by them and occupied 
Bosnian territories. The United Nations would have lost a lot 
if the Serbs had not faced this operation. The implementation 
of the UN decision has restored its credibility. 
  The Turkish Republic was established in 1923, and we have 
yearned for peace to prevail all over the world since then. We 
sent our army to Korea to maintain world peace on the basis of 
this principle. We sent Turkish troops to Somalia last year, 
where many soldiers were martyred. But our objective has always 
been to help bring about world peace. 
  We will send Turkish forces to Bosnia-Herzegovina in 
implementation of the UN resolutions with the objective of 
achieving world peace. 
  [Madani] Do you believe that Bosnia-Herzegovina will 
collapse 
if this international intervention does not take place? 
  [Mehmet] This collapse will, of course, happen if this war 
continues. Therefore, the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina must be 
stopped immediately. Bosnians and Serbs are bound by ties of 
kinship and they have lived for many years under the Yugoslav 
regime. Why don't they live in peace now? 
  [Madani] Has Turkey taken into consideration the possibility 
of intervening militarily on its own in this crisis if the 
conflict in Bosnia continues? 
  [Mehmet] We do not attack anyone and have no ambitions in 
anyone's territories. We are only defending ourselves. It is 
known that Turkey is the strongest country in the Middle East 
from military and other aspects. But we use this strength to 
deter those who try to attack us or other peaceful countries. 
  I insist that Turkey has no ambitions in other countries' 
territories. I hope that we will have relations of brotherhood 
and good neighborliness, especially with our neighboring 
countries. 
  We want peace to prevail in the entire world. We have 
welcomed and felt relieved by the agreement concluded between 
the Palestinians and the Israelis. We also were much distressed 
by what the Israelis did to worshipers at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque 
because it delayed the peace process. Why should there be such 
bloodshed? There is plenty of room in the world for all of us, 
so why have war when we can live in peace and security? It is 
enough for the people to safeguard their territory and laws and 
abide by them. 
  [Madani] Why has Germany refrained from supplying you with 
weapons? 
  [Mehmet] There is a problem of terrorism in eastern 
Anatolia. 
Turkey has been facing this terrorism for 10 years. So far, the 
terrorists have killed approximately 3,300 people in that area, 
including 3,000 Turks of Kurdish origin. The Workers Party of 
Kurdistan [PKK] is launching a propaganda campaign in Western 
Europe saying that they are unjustly treated by Turkey. They 
have set up approximately 100 organizations to promote this 
propaganda in Germany alone. Using money and other methods they 
have influenced the German media until they have managed to 
instill in the mind of Germans that there is a minority problem 
in Turkey. But there is no minority problem in Turkey because 
99 percent of Turks are Muslims. Approximately 29 minorities 
speak their own languages in the country. We are all 
first-class citizens. For instance, Foreign Minister Hikmet 
Cetin is of Kurdish origin. The prime minister's adviser is 
also a Kurd. There is no distinction between Kurds and Turks in 
Turkey. Former President Ozal was of Kurdish origin, too. In 
the current parliament there are 100 Kurdish deputies. I, for 
instance, am a Caucasian [Qafqas], and our friend [not further 
identified] is from Georgia. We all live in the Turkish 
homeland. But the propaganda in Germany speaks of injustice. 
How, for God's sake, could a country oppress its own people? 
They also said that we use their weapons against the PKK and 
asked us not to use them. For our part, we have honored the 
terms of the arms agreement concluded with Germany; namely, that 
we do not use their weapons against the Kurds. We do not need 
their weapons. We have obtained from the Germans 5 billion 
marks' worth of weapons and paid them for the arms. I say that 
we do not need the German weapons because there are plenty of 
weapons on the world market; in Russia and elsewhere. 
Approximately 200 German journalists have visited the eastern 
part of Turkey. They were expecting riots during the recent 
local elections, but there were no riots. We use Russian 
weapons that are similar to German weapons. So they thought we 
were using their weapons, which is not true. They misunderstood. 
  [Madani] Is there a possibility for a cease-fire between 
you and the Kurds so that a dialogue to achieve genuine peace in 
eastern Turkey can begin? 
  [Mehmet] Not at all. I do not sit with terrorists and 
highway bandits. I cannot think of it. Their problem will be 
over this year. How can we talk to those who kill children and 
smuggle hashish and weapons? How can we sit with those 
terrorists at the negotiating table? 
  At some point in time, they were in your country, in 
Lebanon's al-Biqa' Valley. Now they are divided in al-Biqa', 
Syria, and Iraq. There is no way out of this. I feel sad for 
those among them who are killed in battles who are only between 
15 and 20 years old. I feel very sad for those children whose 
beards have not appeared yet. 
  There is no complete solution to this problem other than 
death. Therefore, we call on them to surrender their weapons to 
save their lives. Between 10 and 20 of these young men die 
every day. I feel sorry for them; after all, they are human 
beings. No country in the whole world has ever surrendered to 
terrorism. Strong Turkey, with its 60 million people and its 
strong Army, will not give in to 10,000 terrorists. 
  [Madani] Does the growth of the Islamic trend, represented 
by 
the Welfare Party, constitute a threat to your ruling regime? 
  [Mehmet] They won the votes of the angry people. We entered 
those local elections at the hardest of times. I say in the 
name of my party, the True Path Party, that media and senior 
businessmen opposed our party because we raised taxes. In 
elections, more taxes mean lower votes. 
  The economic hardship and the rise in the value of the 
dollar 
before the elections made it easy for the opposition to attack 
us. The whole opposition joined its forces against us. It is 
known that Turkey has 14 parties. Despite all these 
circumstances, we came first in the elections. The voters did 
try the Welfare Party before, when they withheld their votes 
from the Motherland Party because they were angry with the 
government. But this lasted for only a short period, and I 
believe the current situation will end soon because it will be 
difficult for the hardship to continue. 
  [Madani] Some say that Turkey is facing the threat of the 
Islamic trend and that you are heading toward a difficult 
situation parallel to what is happening in Algeria. 
  [Mehmet] Turkey is not Algeria or any other country. 
Extremists are found all over the world, not only in Turkey. 
There are left-wing extremists as well as right-wing 
extremists. But the majority of the Turkish people are 
moderates.

  [Text] Ankara, May 2 (A.A.) -- A delegation including the 
General Staff and Foreign Ministry officials returned to Turkey 
after completing official contacts with UN Protection Forces 
(UNPROFOR) officials. 
  General Staff spokesman Colonel Dogu Silahcioglu said the 
delegation met Croatian officials on April 28 and UN officials 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina to set up a date for the deployment of 
Turkish troops to Bosnia. 
  Silahcioglu said the Turkish delegation and UN officials 
reached an understanding on the structure of Turkish soldiers, 
their necessities and location where they will function. 
  Turkish troops will include a mechanized infantry battalion 
and military engineering and logistics team including health and 
transport personnel to support this battalion. 
  He said all necessary preparations were completed for the 
active functioning of Turkish soldiers. 
  Following a request from the United Nations, Turkey has 
agreed to send a 2,700 military personnel. 
  UN officials said the infantry comprising 1,000 people is 
expected to be set up between Bosnians and Croatian forces in 
the buffer zone.

  [Text] Hans Stercken, the German parliament's Foreign 
Affairs Commission chairman, has denied claims that German arms 
are being used against the separatist terrorist organization in 
the southeast. Stercken, who arrived in Ankara yesterday, met 
with Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin. 
  In a statement he issued prior to the meeting, Stercken said 
that he himself does not believe in these claims and added that 
those who previously went to the southeast to carry out 
observations were biased. Stercken further added that those who 
maintained that German arms were being used against the 
population in southeast Anatolia were prejudiced and not 
interested in seeing Turkey live in peace. 
  Cetin, in turn, said that Turkey and Germany have 
deep-rooted 
and multidimensional relations and added that the two countries 
should not be affected by the undesirable situations that may 
arise from time to time. Pointing out that Turkey is determined 
to resolve terrorism within the framework of democracy, human 
rights, and a state of law, Cetin said that terrorism is a 
significant threat to democracy.

  [Text] Ankara, Apr. 30, INA -- Leader of the Turkish 
Prosperity Party Necmittin Erbakan said perpetuation of the 
embargo on the people of Iraq is a crime against humanity. 
Speaking in the course of a meeting with the Iraqi ambassador 
in Ankara on Friday [29 April], Mr Erbakan called for the 
immediate lifting of the embargo and said that all 
justifications led to imposing it no more exist since Iraq had 
implemented its obligations toward the Security Council 
resolutions. He said the Turkish economy was greatly affected 
by the embargo and that the United States is not concerned with 
Turkey's losses which totalled some 10 billion dollars since it 
is realizing its interests and greeds. 
  Mr Erbakan added that his party which won the local 
elections 
in most of Turkey's major cities would continue its unlimited 
support of the people of Iraqi leading to the lifting of the 
embargo. 
  The Turkish party leader criticised the Turkish government's 
attitudes in carrying on the implementation of the embargo 
against Iraq despite the big economic losses inflicted on Turkey 
and said there is no option before the Turkish government now 
but to move toward Iraq and restore normal relationss and ending 
the embargo. He added that influential circles inside the 
Security Council with the United States and Britain in the 
forefront fabricate all pretexts so that the council would not 
implement its obligations toward Iraq and continue the starving 
of the Iraqi people.

  [Text] Ankara, May 2 (A.A.) -- Iranian Foreign Minister 
First Assistant [title as received] Mohammad Hashemi arrived 
here for an official visit on Monday [2 Monday]. 
  Hashemi was welcomed at the airport by Foreign Ministry 
Under 
Secretary Ozdem Sanberk. 
  Sanberk said that Hashemi's visit was very important to 
improve better understanding and to resolve problems between 
Turkey and Iran at a time of ambiguity in the region. 
  He added that Hashemi was to hold contacts in Ankara under a 
semi-annual political consultation mechanism set up between the 
two countries. 
  Sanberk stressed that Iran was a friendly and brotherly 
country and that the border between the two countries remained 
stable. 
  He stressed that Turkey and Iran had mutual interests. 
  During Hashemi's visit, the Armenian invasion of Azerbaijan, 
the latest situation in the Caucasus, Bosnia, and Iraq will be 
discussed. 
  Sanberk added that high-level mutual visits between the two 
countries were to continue and "thus, relations between Turkey 
and Iran will be furthered." 
  Hashemi said that the situation of the region and the world 
necessitated furthering relations and consultations between the 
two countries and that he was very pleased to be visiting Turkey. 
  He said that the region in which Turkey and Iran are face 
various problems and his current visit to Turkey was related to 
these turbulences and wars. 
  He pointed out that he was paying his first visit to Turkey 
as the first assistant to the foreign minister and that this 
showed the importance Iran attached to Turkey. 
  "This visit is an opportunity for us," Hashemi said.

<F P=106> [Report by Lale Sariibrahimoglu: "The Greek Lobby Is </F>
Influential in the United States"] 
  [Text] Ankara--Ankara says that for Prime Minister Tansu 
Ciller to make concessions on the Cyprus problem is out of the 
question yet Washington is making an effort to fulfill the 
radical Greek lobby's expectations. Ozdem Sanberk, under 
secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has said that 
"talks can be held on the new proposals on the condition that 
the balance between the two sides is not disrupted." Meanwhile, 
Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special representative in 
Cyprus, has begun his contacts in Ankara. 
  In a statement to CUMHURIYET regarding reports that Ciller 
has made a concession to President Clinton on the Cyprus 
problem, Sanberk denied speculations of a difference of opinion 
between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Prime Minister's 
Office on Cyprus. In response to a question on whether the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs was bypassed when Ciller decided to 
send Ambassador Volkan Vural to Nicosia to hold talks with Rauf 
Denktas on the new UN proposals during the weekend, Sanberk 
said: "That is a move that the prime minister has decided to 
make." 
  Regarding Ciller's visit to the United States, Sanberk said 
that she made no statement that can be regarded as a 
"concession." He stressed: "A concession has not been made. 
Clinton's remarks that important developments will take place 
in Cyprus in a few days can be regarded as a statement that was 
prompted by the radical Greek lobby's pressure. The prime 
minister has said nothing different from the views officials 
have expressed for a long time. She explained that Turkey 
wishes to have the Cyprus problem solved. Considering the Greek 
lobby's pressure, the United States wishes to create an 
expectation in the world. That may not be a deliberate U.S. 
policy. The information we have received indicates that the 
prime minister has not made any promise on the Cyprus problem. 
However, the Greek Cypriots, the Greek lobby in the United 
States, and Greek officials have tried to create an expectation 
of a concession by the Turkish Cypriot side. Clinton's remarks 
were aimed at satisfying the Greek lobby." 
  Recalling that Turkey is maintaining a policy that is aimed 
at finding a just and durable solution to the Cyprus problem, 
Sanberk said: "Prime Minister Ciller's remarks in the United 
States do not conflict with Turkey's policy. On the contrary, 
they are within the framework of Turkey's policy. Everyone 
supports the solution of the Cyprus problem. However, everyone 
talks about concessions when the question of solving that 
problem is mentioned. The government is accused of planning to 
make concessions to get rid of that problem. That approach is a 
simplification of the matter. Our view on the solution of the 
problem is that the two communities should hold talks between 
them and find a solution. Considering Rauf Denktas' policy, we 
have supported the original form of the package of 
confidence-building measures. We have not supported the changes 
that have been made in it in favor of the Greek Cypriots. The 
policy we have maintained on that has not changed." 
  Sanberk also said that the UN officials have submitted 
several proposals under the title "draft views" since February 
and that Denktas has assessed them. Stressing that talks can be 
held on the new proposals on the condition that the balance 
between the two sides is not disrupted, Sanberk said that Joe 
Clark's visit to Turkey was made at his request. He said that 
it had not been planned before the recent developments.

<F P=106> [Report by Evin Goktas: "Prosecutors Issue Statement on </F>
Secularism"] 
  [Text] Antalya--The summit of prosecutors, which was held 
under Minister of Justice Seyfi Oktay, adopted a joint statement 
against antisecular activities. Stressing that the statement 
represented the joint voice of jurisprudence in the country, 
Yusuf Kenan Dogan, under secretary of the Ministry of Justice, 
said: "All the enemies of the nation, be they fundamentalists 
or separatists, must heed that voice." 
  The statement, which was signed by all the Republic's 
prosecutors and chief prosecutors, was disclosed by Ertem 
Turker, chief prosecutor of Mugla. It included the following: 
"The Republic's chief prosecutors and prosecutors have very 
carefully assessed the recent irresponsible activities that are 
aimed at changing the secular form of our state and basing it on 
fundamentalist principles. Legal measures will definitely be 
taken against those activities. The Turkish people must have 
confidence in the Republic's prosecutors in that regard. 
Secularism is one of the state's inalienable and undeniable 
principle that cannot be ignored. Consequently, any concession 
on that principle will be tantamount to renouncing democracy and 
the republic. Therefore, vigilance must be maintained against 
the antisecular inclinations and activities more than ever 
before. The Republic's prosecutors have expressed their 
resolute will to continue to support and protect the secular 
system." 
<H5>  Demiral Warns Politicians </H5>
  Nusret Demiral, chief prosecutor of the State Security Court 
in Ankara, has assessed the joint statement. He warned the 
politicians to adopt a cautious approach. Stressing that the 
statement was crystal clear, Demiral said: "Our politicians and 
all the officials must realize the meaning of the views we have 
expressed to avoid pushing the state toward an unfavorable 
direction or representing it in a negative way. We shall take 
action against them if they ignore that. We can take action 
against anyone, including Prosperity Party Leader Necmettin 
Erbakan. We have taken action against many officials in the 
past." 
  Ahmet Koksal, chief prosecutor of the State Security Court 
in 
Istanbul, expressed his views: "The meaning of that statement 
is exactly what you understand from it. Our message is quite 
clear. Those who fail to comply will definitely be confronted 
with the sanctions that are called for by the laws. As in the 
case of all the other forces, the Republic's prosecutors and 
judicial officials maintain a steadfast stance on the question 
of protecting democracy and the free system. No one must worry 
in that regard." 
  Nazmi Sarvan, chief prosecutor of Ankara, described the 
statement as a "memorandum." He said: "The reaction in the 
community reached a peak in the summit. The joint statement we 
have issued is the expression of the final form of that 
reaction. The statement is the joint voice of the secular 
republic's jurisprudence. I am convinced that it is an 
effective lesson and warning to those who are opposed to 
secularism. They may draw conclusions from the joint statement 
if they wish."

<F P=106> [Report by Evin Goktas: "The General Staff Supports the </F>
Memoradum on Secularism"] 
  [Text] Ankara--The Turkish Armed Forces have welcomed the 
"statement on secularism," which was issued at the end of the 
meeting that was held by the chief prosecutors and prosecutors 
of 76 provinces and eight districts under Minister of Justice 
Seyfi Oktay in Antalya. The chief prosecutors of eight State 
Security Courts also attended the meeting. General Dogan Gures, 
chief of the General Staff, called Seyfi Oktay to congratulate 
him on the joint statement. Gen. Gures said that he also 
congratulated all the chief prosecutors and prosecutors who 
signed the statement. He said: "I am very pleased by the 
issuing of such a statement by the prosecutors at such a time." 
  Seyfi Oktay said that he was very pleased by Gen. Gures' 
call. He said: "The Turkish Army is one of the leading 
institutions in which the reactionary forces have been unable to 
infiltrate. Therefore, Gen. Gures' message has made us very 
happy." 
  Seyfi Oktay described Gen. Gures' call as "an indication of 
the Turkish Armed Forces' sensitive stance on the question of 
secularism." 
  Yusuf Kenan Dogan, under secretary of the Ministry of 
Justice, thanked Gen. Gures for his sensitive approach to the 
matter. He said: "As the members of the judicial system, we 
are convinced that Gen. Gures will be successful in the struggle 
he wages against acts of terrorism to defend our homeland. We 
wish to stress that we shall always support him." 
  Dogan said that the prosecutors must maintain an impartial 
stance on all the problems, except on matters related to the 
safeguarding of the state's indivisible integrity and the 
Republic's secular system. Recalling that the Republic's 
prosecutors met in Antalya for the first time, Dogan said that 
everyone approved the Justice Ministry's effort to maintain the 
independence of the courts and the judges. Stressing that the 
pro-Ataturk and secular nature of the courts have been restored, 
Dogan said: "People who act with common sense do not wish to 
even consider that Turkey will move toward a dark era once 
again."

<F P=106> [David Gardner report: "MEPs Fail To Block Vote on </F>
Enlargement"] 
  [Text] Strasbourg -- The European Union [EU] took a 
further step yesterday towards expanding its membership from 12 
to 16 member states, when a series of filibusters to frustrate 
tomorrow's mandatory ratification vote in the European 
Parliament was defeated. 
  Both the plenary of the Strasbourg assembly and its Foreign 
Affairs Committee beat back attempts to get the biggest ever 
increase in the Euro-club postponed. 
  The Parliament's struggle to win more power from the member 
states and the European Commission has held EU enlargement 
hostage for the past two months. Two weeks ago, leaders of the 
dominant Socialist and Christian Democrat blocs in Strasbourg 
agreed to put through the accession treaty, in exchange for 
pledges that Parliament would be closely associated with the 
1996 review of the Maastricht Treaty and power-sharing in the EU. 
  But party managers in Strasbourg are still nervous about 
whether enough Euro-MPs will turn up to ratify the enlargement, 
intended to bring Sweden, Austria, Finland and Norway into the 
Union next January. Failure by the Parliament to ratify could 
easily sabotage the four applicant countries' difficult 
referendums on membership this autumn, and very possibly 
complicate ratification by national parliaments of the Twelve. 
  A first attempt yesterday by the far-right to get 
enlargement 
taken off this week's agenda was easily defeated by 287 votes to 
eight, with four abstentions. 
  The unsurprising size of this quashing of the Euro-fascists 
is less relevant than the size of Euro-MPs' presence in 
Strasbourg, given that a third of MEPs [Member of the European 
Parliament] rarely turn up at all, that next month's elections 
are set to eject up to two-thirds of present members, and that 
many of those hoping to survive are on the campaign trail. 
  In tomorrow's vote, 260 of the 518 MEPs must approve 
enlargement. The Socialists, the largest bloc, reckon they can 
guarantee 130-140 votes, but there are worries about the 
Christian Democrats' pledge of 100 votes, while the small groups 
are less disciplined. 
  The two big blocs both sent their leaderships to lobby 
yesterday's Foreign Affairs Committee, and to stall the infinite 
variety of possible procedural snags. 
  Even Mr Jean Louis Bourlanges, the French Christian Democrat 
who has led the campaign to hold up enlargement dismissed 
yesterday's skirmishes as "procedural trickery," arguing for a 
straightforward battle on Wednesday.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- On Tuesday [3 May] FRG Foreign 
Minister Klaus Kinkel congratulated Nelson Mandela as the future 
South African president on the "crowning of your lifelong 
political work." Kinkel will fly to Pretoria for the 
inauguration next Tuesday. 
  Kinkel expressed his respect and appreciation for outgoing 
President Frederik de Klerk. It is not surprising that the 
elections did "not" take place "without some organizational 
problems." The important thing is the impression gained by the 
international observers that the elections were "generally free 
and fair." The new South Africa can count on German solidarity 
and "energetic support." 
  The Social Democratic Party Executive Committee also 
expressed appreciation for De Klerk and congratulations to 
Mandela. In a statement published on Tuesday the Executive 
Committee stressed the trust placed in Mandela, who will take 
away fear and concern from the South Africans of different 
colors by implementing the announced policy of reconciliation. 
German industry, which worked also during the UN sanctions in 
South Africa, is now particularly called upon to help.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Addressing a True Path Party 
[TPP] meeting today, Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, leader of the 
TPP, pointed out that the Turkish economy is being negatively 
affected by the economic embargo against Iraq. 
  [Begin Ciller recording] The oil pipeline system, which 
constitutes a valuable investment for both Turkey and Iraq, has 
been left idle for three years and faces the danger of damage 
and rotting. An agreement has been reached to carry out a sort 
of rescue operation in order to eliminate this danger. In this 
way, when the oil embargo is lifted in the future, the system 
will be able to function uninterruptedly. [end recording] 
  Ciller explained that oil will be pumped to the pipeline and 
that food, medicine, and certain basic necessities will be sent 
to Iraq in return. The prime minister denied reports that the 
United States gave Turkey a note in connection with this matter. 
She stressed that the allies realize that this situation arose 
because of a technical necessity.

<F P=106> [Julie Wolf report: "Brittan Hits EU Firms Over Export </F>
Timidity"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- Sir Leon Brittan, the EU [European 
Union] trade commissioner, yesterday strongly criticised 
European companies for not being aggressive enough in pursuing 
export markets. 
  In a speech on the Uruguay Round world trade agreement, Sir 
Leon urged companies to co-operate with national governments and 
the European Commission on strategies to promote exports. 
  "European business is not as active on this front as are our 
American or other competitors. On the Japanese market, I am 
struck by the direct involvement of American chief executives, 
even from very large companies, in the hunt for contacts and the 
hunt for contracts," Sir Leon said. 
  "If industrial co-operation really is one of the keys to 
sustained exports success, then the diaries of top European 
businessmen must be shaped to reflect this more closely than is 
the case today," he added. 
  The commissioner said that, although European business 
leaders repeatedly stressed the importance of Asian markets in 
the future, "there is not yet a Europe-wide network linking 
those with expertise and resources in those markets." This 
means that "European business has a less strategic vision of 
prospects in Asia than is needed," he said. 
  Sir Leon's comments came as the commission released a report 
on the "global benefits" of the GATT accord. According to 
Brussels, the EU stands to reap substantial gains from the 
Uruguay Round agreement signed last month in Marrakesh. Tariffs 
on trade between the EU and the United States will be cut almost 
in half, with about 7.5 billion pounds in EU exports to the rest 
of the world no longer subject to any tariffs at all. 
  European firms will also benefit from the opening up of a 
global public procurement market estimated at 260 billion 
pounds. The commission said that clearer and tighter rules on 
trade and investment set out in the GATT agreement would allow 
companies to operate in a more secure environment. 
  According to Sir Leon, the onus in the post-Uruguay Round 
world will increasingly be on the business community to remove 
barriers to trade. "Since nowadays the obstacles to European 
exports or foreign investments are located in other economies' 
domestic rules and behaviour, the paths around those obstacles 
will not always be found rapidly by government to government 
negotiations," he warned.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Europe's Parliament"] </F>
  [Text] European Union [EU] institutions often face 
justifiable criticism for lack of transparency in 
decision-making. One of the bodies best placed to address this 
problem is the European Parliament, but the public doubts its 
effectiveness. That is one reason why, in most EU countries, 
the turnout in the election for the Strasbourg assembly on June 
9 and 12 will probably be much lower than in national polls. 
  In fact, as a result of the Single European Act that came 
into force in 1987 and the Maastricht Treaty, the power of the 
518 (soon to be 567) MEPs [Member of the European Parliament] in 
many cases exceeds that of members of national parliaments. 
With the ability to determine Europe-wide legislation, vet both 
the European Commission and Council of Ministers and check the 
EU budget, Europe's transnational assembly demands to be taken 
seriously. At the same time, the rules governing the 
Parliament's own operations need to be tightened. If it wants 
public sympathy in its campaign for a more directly democratic 
EU, the Parliament will have to correct its own shortcomings. 
  At present, the Parliament offers a case study in 
unwieldiness, due only in part to the inevitable problems of 
linking 12 states' diverse political cultures. Efficiency is 
constrained and costs increased by MEPs' need to peregrinate 
between plenary sessions in Strasbourg and committee meetings in 
Brussels. 
<H5>  Higher Profile </H5>
  The Parliament's difficulties have often reflected national 
governments' unwillingness to allow it to undermine national 
parliaments. However, during the next five-year legislature 
period, it will have a much higher profile. Already, around 
2,000 MEPs' amendments relating to single market legislation 
have passed into law. Under Maastricht, the Parliament shares 
"co-decision" power with the Council of Ministers. It can veto 
most measures passed by qualified majority voting, in fields 
ranging from consumer protection and vocational training to 
health and research. 
  In a fresh sign of its importance the Parliament is due to 
decide tomorrow whether to accept the formula for EU voting 
planned when Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden join. 
  It would be both unwise and regrettable if MEPs risked 
delaying an enlargement timetable which commands widespread 
support within the EU, but which is politically sensitive in the 
applicant countries. The Parliament is, however, on stronger 
ground in seeking confirmation hearings with nominees for the 
new Commission due to take office next year and is playing a 
welcome part in efforts launched by the Dutch to reduce secrecy 
in EU ministerial discussions. 
<H5>  Credibility </H5>
  In its supervisory or watchdog role, the Parliament can have 
a beneficial impact in promoting transparency, controlling EU 
bureaucracies and curbing overspending, including that linked to 
fraud. But these efforts will command little credibility while 
evidence persists of Parliament's own mismanagement. 
  Responsibility for the wastefulness of the 
Brussels-Strasbourg Euroshuttle lies largely with the French 
government, which has constantly opposed siting the Parliament 
in its logical home, the Belgian capital. Nonetheless, the 
Parliament is partly to blame for the cost over-runs on its new 
building in Brussels and for the plan to create an expensive new 
chamber in Strasbourg. Independent inquiries into both affairs 
are urgently required. 
  Among necessary procedural reforms, the Parliament must 
widen 
timely dissemination of its often valuable committee work. It 
must also try to ensure a more cohesive framework for its 
debates and for the ensuing votes. Possible moves to crack down 
on absenteeism might include suspension or expulsion of MEPs. 
Equally, given its influence over EU legislation, the 
Parliament needs firmer rules for disclosure of members' links 
with outside companies. 
  To reinforce the democratic legitimacy of EU decisions, it 
is 
healthy that the Parliament is acquiring and using extra muscle. 
But there is also a need to scrutinise the scrutineer. Only if 
it respects the principles of probity and openness in the 
conduct of EU affairs can the Parliament hope to safeguard them. 
Without a better reputation, the Parliament will fail to engage 
the interest and to win the trust of Europe's voters.

<F P=106> [Article by MAE: "Christian Democratic Appeal Is Major </F>
Loser, Spectacular Gain for Parties for the Elderly"] 
  [Text] The Hague, 3 May (ANP) -- On Tuesday [3 May], in the 
elections to the Second Chamber, the social democratic party, 
PvdA [Labor Party] easily won the race for first place. The 
difference between the current coalition partners is three 
seats: The PvdA won 37 seats (minus 12), the CDA [Christian 
Democratic Appeal] had to make do with 34 (minus 20). 
  PvdA leader Wim Kok said that the PvdA "is back after having 
been away." He announced that he will use that position to put 
together a firmly progressive cabinet with a social face during 
the formation period. 
  As expected, the elections resulted in a major 
redistribution 
of political forces in the Netherlands. The governing parties 
(the CDA and the PvdA) suffered unprecedented setbacks, losing a 
total of 32 seats (20 and 12 respectively). The balance of 
political power was thoroughly shaken up. 
  The electoral turnout on Tuesday was 78.1 percent, 1.8 
percent less than in the September 1989 elections to the Second 
Chamber. 
  The "revolutionary" election result makes a three-party 
cabinet a necessity. The self-evident governmental 
responsibility of the CDA is over, after nearly 80 years. 
Virtually any governing coalition is now possible. All 
possible combinations of three of the four major parties can 
count on constituting a majority of approximately 90 seats. 
  CDA leader Elco Brinkman humbly acknowledged the historic 
defeat of the christian democrats. He congratulated his PvdA 
colleague Kok on becoming the leader of the largest party. 
Brinkman in no measure concealed his disappointment at his own 
electoral loss: "The disappointment is great, and I am very sad 
about the result." 
  The right-wing liberal VVD [People's Party for Freedom and 
Democracy] made substantial gains, moving from 22 to 31 seats. 
VVD leader Frits Bolkestein described the outcome as "one of 
the best results ever achieved." In the final run-up to the 
election, the VVD left the left-wing liberal D66 [Democrats 66] 
way behind in the race for third place. According to 
Bolkestein, the government coalition received an unbelievable 
thrashing. According to the liberal leader, the VVD "quite 
clearly has a firm prospect of participating in the government." 
  The D66 finally became a really major party. Hans van 
Mierlo's parliamentary representation doubled, to 24 seats. 
However, that splendid progress was less spectacular than had 
been predicted in the opinion polls. Before the elections, that 
target was set on something like 30 seats. However, van Mierlo 
kept his cards close to his chest when giving his first 
reaction. "You should not be choosy when you receive such a 
large present. So must I ask whether it could not have been a 
little larger?" 
  In the early evening, it became clear that the party that 
the 
Green Left had hoped to be celebrating would have to be called 
off. To their personal bewilderment, the party led jointly by 
the duo Brouwer/Rabbae saw the predicted gains turn into a loss 
of five seats. 
  Rabbae was bitter about the result and blamed the loss 
primarily on the fact that the PvdA, in his words, had "emerged 
as vanquishers," suffering considerable losses but winning the 
fight for the largest number of votes, partly at the cost of the 
Green Left. "The voters are confronted with the power issue; 
many voted for the PvdA at the last moment," Rabbae claimed. 
  However, the greatest surprise was the progress made by the 
parties for the elderly. Between them, the General Association 
of Elderly People [Algemeen Ouderen Verbond (AOV)] and the +\55 
Union entered the Chamber with seven seats. The rebellion among 
the elderly against the AOW [Old Age Pension] plans of the major 
parties unexpectedly led to a major reaction after all. The AOV 
bagged six seats, the Union one. Leerkes, the +\55 Union's 
leader said that it was "actually unfortunate" that there were 
two parties representing the interests of the elderly. He said 
that in the wake of the elections, he would immediately have to 
talk about forming a single party. 
  To the dismay of the remaining parties, among the smaller 
parties it was the right-wing Center Democrats (CD), embodied by 
Hans Janmaat, that won out. The one-man party climbed from 0.9 
to 2.5 percent and gained between two and three additional 
seats, depending on how the remaining seats are shared out. 
PvdA leader Kok reacted by describing this outcome as a 
"deplorable flight to right-wing extremism. These firebrands 
are gaining too many seats. This is a blot on our political 
history, but we may not resign ourselves to it. These parties 
must not be allowed to eat their poisonous way through the 
system," he said. 
  The Socialist Party (SP) will be entering the Second Chamber 
with two seats. That result is in line with predictions made 
before the elections. SP leader Marijnissen was delighted upon 
hearing the news that the SP had finally made it into the Second 
Chamber after a number of failed attempts. "We have a foot in 
the door and will form part of the opposition in a conventional 
manner," he said. Of the small Christian parties, SGP 
[Political Reformed Party], GPV [Reformed Political Union], and 
RPF [Reformational Political Federation], the latter bagged two 
additional seats and will return to the Chamber with a total of 
three representatives. The SGP will have to settle for less 
than it had bargained for, and will only occupy one of the three 
seats. The GPV retained its two present representatives in the 
Chamber.

<F P=106> [John Palmer report: "Tory Row Baffles EU Partners"] </F>
  [Text] Brussels -- Britain's European partners are 
following the debate among Conservative politicians about 
possible withdrawal from the Union with amusement and amazement. 
The Tory row about a possible British referendum on EU 
[European Union] membership is seen as evidence of a permanent 
split on European policy in the party. 
  Few EU leaders believe reports that John Major has 
considered 
putting membership of the EU to a referendum at the next general 
election. But some have already indicated to London their 
determination to move further towards a federal European Union 
after 1996 -- even if this has to be without Britain. 
  "The British Conservatives seem to be tearing themselves 
apart and I really cannot understand what is at the bottom of 
it," a Dutch minister observed yesterday. "The wild men seem to 
be running your government's political agenda." 
  A senior European Commission member said: "The Eurosceptics 
have no real alternative to offer except complete withdrawal and 
no British government will agree to that." 
  Few people believe that the 1996 review conference set up 
under the Maastricht treaty will result in a fully federalist 
system for what will probably by then be an EU of 16 states. 
But the British government will come under pressure to allow a 
majority of EU countries to agree on steps to "deepen" political 
union -- with Britain being entitled to stand aside. 
  "The most important decision in 1996 will be how to take 
future constitutional decisions," one EU ambassador said. 
"There may be a precedent in the Maastricht treaty. The 
British opt-outs on a single currency and social policy could be 
used again. This could allow a big majority of the 16 to agree 
on further integration within the European Union without 
obliging everyone to take part." 
  The odds are that a majority of the 16 will decide to move 
to 
a single currency by the end of the decade. Technical work has 
begun to permit a single currency to be introduced, maybe in 
1998, and optimism is growing that 10 or 12 of the 16 EU 
countries will be economically strong enough by then to take 
part. 
  Senior British ministers have dismissed as "utopian" any 
prospect of monetary union this decade. But Sir Leon Brittan, 
European commissioner for foreign trade, warned last week that 
Tory Euro- sceptics were out of touch with developments. 
  The 1996 conference of EU governments will almost certainly 
agree to create a European defence union by merging the Western 
European Union (the association of the European member states of 
NATO) with the EU itself. The signs are that the British 
government will back this move and may even join the existing 
multi-national Eurocorps -- seen as the embryo of a future EU 
army. 
  "The British are quite right to see the 1996 conference as 
of 
crucial importance to the future of Europe. It will not decide 
the final shape of a federal union but it could go further in 
that direction than some in London realise," a senior member of 
the European Commission said yesterday. 
  The starting point for the 1996 conference and reform of 
decision-making in the Union will be enlargement. Everyone 
accepts that expansion to include Austria, Finland, Norway and 
Sweden next year is only the start of a process which will 
continue into the new century and may lead to an EU of between 
20 and 30 states. 
  Rather than risk the Union being paralysed, or even 
imploding, under the weight of new members, most EU governments 
accept the need for radical political reform. The 1996 review 
is likely to make fundamental changes to the voting system in 
the Council of Ministers, giving many more votes to the larger 
countries (of which the British government will approve) while 
making it easier to decide by majority vote (which London is 
opposed to). 
  Mr Major will have little difficulty in agreeing to reduce 
the numbers of European commissioners to 12 or 14, but he will 
resist the German and French call for far greater powers for the 
future president of the Commission to pick the commissioners on 
merit rather than being forced to accept those chosen by 
national governments. 
  Alongside reforms in the Commission and the Council of 
Ministers, the German government will also press hard for the 
European Parliament to be given further legislative powers over 
justice, policing and immigration, as well as foreign, security 
and defence policy. 
  Some favour a committee of national parliaments being set up 
as an upper chamber of the European Parliament to rule on which 
issues are best legislated at European or at national or 
regional levels. The increasingly powerful regions, particularly 
in Germany, Italy, Spain and Belgium, will also demand a bigger 
say through the Committee of the European Regions.

<F P=106> [Patrick Wintour report: "Embattled Major Finds Enemies </F>
Lurking Among Would-Be Friends"] 
  [Text] On what had been optimistically intended as a week 
of celebration marking the 15th anniversary of the election of a 
Tory government, Conservatives wake up this morning to find 
their MPs again spitting blood at one another over the party 
leadership. 
  David Evans, the MP for Luton East, may have intended his 
call for six cabinet sackings a shake-up of John Major's kitchen 
cabinet and the dismissal of the party chairman Norman Fowler, 
as a piece of no-nonsense populist advice from a friendly 
backbench voice on the party right. But that was not its effect. 
  Instead, it underlines Mr Major's inability to enforce 
discipline in his ranks and the desperate remedies even his 
allies believe he must take if he is to survive defeats in the 
local and European elections. 
  Even one of his great friends, the Agriculture Secretary, 
Gillian Shephard, is inadvertently daily digging a hole for her 
patron. On Saturday [30 April] she said 80 per cent of Tory MPs 
wanted Mr Major to continue, failing to foresee that this 
implied a fifth of the party did not. 
  On Sunday she was again too frank, admitting that canvassing 
on behalf of Michael Heseltine and Michael Portillo was under 
way and complaining that there were two oppositions in the 
Commons, one of them Conservative. Party members were in 
despair, she added. 
  Yesterday Mrs Shephard told BBC Radio 4's Today programme 
that Cabinet ministers who did not feel 100 per cent loyalty to 
the Prime Minister should resign, inadvertently suggesting that 
some did not possess that undiluted allegiance. 
  Matters were hardly helped when one prominent Major loyalist 
in Parliament rang selected journalists with a publicly loyal 
statement yesterday, but then privately admitted that politics 
was beginning to look bleak for Mr Major. With friends such as 
these, who needs to worry about enemies? 
  The answer is Mr Major, for there is now no mistaking the 
determination of some Cabinet rightwingers, notably Mr Portillo, 
the Treasury Chief Secretary, to try their luck. In a clear 
breach of the painfully developed consensus on European policy, 
Mr Portillo expressed opposition at the weekend to any moves 
towards a single currency, saying it would mean "giving up the 
government of the UK." 
  The remarks do not incriminate him directly over the reports 
that some Tories want to go into the next election on a ticket 
of withdrawal from Europe, but they were hardly designed to pour 
cold water over the story. As the mammoth Conservative Campaign 
Guide, published yesterday, makes clear, the official policy is 
to assert that the Maastricht Treaty's timetable for monetary 
union is now hypothetical and that Parliament will only take a 
decision on a single currency at the appropriate time. 
  Yesterday Stephen Dorrell, the pro-European Economic 
Secretary to the Treasury, had to be wheeled out to rehearse 
this official line on the radio. He explained: "The only 
circumstances in which it could be come a real question is if 
the continental countries decided themselves to set (a single 
currency) up. That would obviously create a question for 
British government which we have decided we will answer at the 
time." 
  He added that it was silly to answer such hypothetical 
questions when there was no need to, a thought which might have 
crossed Mr Portillo's mind had he been less keen to send out 
messages to the backbench sceptics.

<F P=106> [Louise Hidalgo report: "Britain Slow To Cash In as Lebanon </F>
Rises From Ruin"] 
  [Text] Nuhad Barudi, secretary general of Lebanon's 
Council for Development and Reconstruction, the body responsible 
for overseeing the country's revival after 17 years of civil 
war, sweeps a hand over piles of tender documents on his desk. 
"The game of markets is a game of risks," he says. "The 
Italians, the French, the Germans, even the Scandinavians, have 
decided Lebanon is worth the risk. The British seem to have 
calculated differently. They must have faith in Lebanon's 
resurrection if they are to compete." 
  It is a little over a year since Rafiq al-Hariri, the 
billionaire businessman turned politician who is Lebanon's prime 
minister, launched his blueprint for reconstruction after one of 
the most destructive civil wars this century ended the country's 
reputation as the Middle East's international market place and 
financial centre. over 10 years, $12 billion of public money is 
to be pumped into rebuilding Lebanon's shattered infrastructure, 
from telecommunications, railways and the once famous port of 
Beirut to restoring the capital's centre. 
  The French and Italians have been leading the race to win a 
share of the spoils -- already, contracts worth more than $2.5 
billion have been awarded or put out to tender -- but British 
businesses have been noticeably more hesitant. "The British 
seem to be more obsessed than their European counterparts with 
Lebanon's recent past," said one Western diplomat. "Businessmen 
who come here regard themselves as pioneers, telephoning home as 
soon as they leave the airport." 
  The work ahead is certainly daunting. Beirut's commercial 
centre, the old front line, is an eerie wasteland of rubble, 
laced with mines and inhabited by Syrian labourers and 
squatters. Security remains dicey, as recent bombings aimed at 
Christians show. 
  Sir George Young, Britain's housing minister, returned at 
the 
weekend from his second mission to Lebanon in less than a year, 
optimistic that there are great opportunities for British 
companies, particularly in Beirut, where rebuilding of the city 
centre, the key element of the reconstruction programmee, should 
begin this year. "Britain's strength lies in putting together 
the total package," he said. "Lebanon has a fairly developed 
building industry of its own. British companies can assist in 
project management and financing, in partnership with 
Beirut-based businesses." 
  There are signs of increased interest, following the renewal 
of UK export insurance guarantees to Lebanon this year, despite 
some criticism that, at 50 million pounds, the cover is too low 
when huge infrastructure projects are at stake. "We are 
certainly seeing far more companies coming to look," said Jim 
McCredie, of KPMG Peat Marwick, project managers to the 
development and reconstruction council and one of only two 
British consultancy firms to have won contracts. "But so far, 
none has returned with a contract." 
  Rolls-Royce and John Brown Engineering have both 
prequalified 
for the tender to build two 450-megawatt power stations, as have 
Taylor Woodrow and Tilbury Douglas for the $100 million contract 
to construct an olympic-sized sports complex in Beirut. 
Barclays has been among several banks discussing the 
possibility of acting as depositors for British contracts and 
Robert Fleming is considering opening a Beirut office. "There 
are many opportunities for developing capital markets and 
finance-raising in the region," said John Drysdale, a Robert 
Fleming director, "and it is rare to find an area where the 
American investment banks are not competing." (U.S. companies 
are barred from doing business in Lebanon.) 
  Lebanese officials say that when British companies have bid, 
they have pitched their prices too high. Trafalga House, one of 
16 bidders for the contract to expand Beirut's airport, the 
largest project so far put out to tender under the 
reconstruction programme is unlikely to win against a joint 
German-Lebanese bid almost $200 million cheaper, for example. 
"The Lebanese are renowned for their business acumen and they 
want to get their dollars' worth," Mr McCredie said. 
  Even among Lebanon loyalists, however, there are concerns 
about the financing of the reconstruction programmee. So far, 
the development and reconstruction council has managed to raise 
$1.5 billion in grants, soft loans and commercial loans. 
  Of this, in spite of Mr al-Hariri's excellent Gulf 
credentials (he is a citizen of Saudi Arabia, where he made his 
fortune in the 1960's and 1970's), only $350 million has come 
from Arab funds. Italy is the foremost foreign donor, having 
signed protocols worth $450 million, while the "EC and the 
European Investment Bank have committed $25 million and the 
World Bank $175 million." 
  According to Mr Barudi, who used to be an economist with the 
United Nations economic commission in New York, the government 
aims to raise 36 percent of the nominal capital, less than $4 
billion, in loans and aid. The rest will be financed by 
internal borrowing and government revenue. However, in an 
economy that last year registered a GDP of about $6 billion 
(exact statistics are not available, another problem potential 
investors face) such sums may be difficult to deliver. The 
reconstruction plan envisages a budget surplus by 1996 and a 
doubling of Lebanon's GDP by 2002, an aim described by one 
Lebanese economist as "a nice idea but unlikely." 
  The development and reconstruction council and the 
government 
are relying on a flow of private investment -- projected at $21 
billion -- and foreign aid as business confidence in Lebanon 
grows. It is looking at tax exemptions for foreign companies 
wishing to invest, and tax on big corporations has been cut to 
10 percent. 
  Despite the difficulties, Western economists say Lebanon's 
political and economic prospects have not looked as good since 
early in the 1960's. Since Mr al-Hariri was appointed, the 
Lebanese pound has gained more than 40 percent and a combination 
of conservative economic policy and a stable political climate 
has lured back nearly $2 billion of Lebanese savings that had 
fled overseas, lifting bank deposits by more than a fifth. Last 
year, capital inflows helped the economy to grow by 7 percent 
and inflation fell below 10 percent for the first time in a 
decade. 
  Oversubscription of the $650 million share issue in 
Solidere, 
the private-sector company set up to manage the reconstruction 
of Beirut's city centre, has been hailed as proof of investors' 
confidence in Lebanon's renewal. 
  But even if Mr al-Hariris ambitious reconstruction plans 
succeed, Lebanon is unlikely to regain its pre-war reputation. 
Then, Beirut's open port and liberal atmosphere made it an 
ideal centre for doing business in the repressive but affluent 
Middle East. Banks, in particular, thrived under Lebanon's 
Swiss-style secrecy laws. 
  Now Lebanon is planning for a new era in which Beirut must 
vie for business with Cairo, Dubai and Bahrain. Peace, if it 
comes, will also mean competition with what a Lebanese columnist 
has called the combined genius of the Israelis and the 
Palestinians. Mr Barudi admits: "Lebanon will not be able to 
play again the idle role it had in the 1950's and 1960's as the 
Middle East's financial centre, but we are up to the challenge."

<F P=106> [Speech by UK Trade Minister Richard Needham at a Department </F>
of Trade and Industry-sponsored conference at the Confederation 
of British Industry in London on 3 May; "Vietnam -- Another 
Asian Tiger Says Richard Needham"] 
  [Text] Vietnam has all the right ingredients to become a 
market to be reckoned with, and British firms can no longer 
afford to ignore it, Trade Minister Richard Needham told British 
companies today. 
  He said they should be prepared to take the long term view 
and make commitments to the country now, rather than waiting 
until later when rivals will have put down roots. The UK's 
exporting future lies in the dynamic trade area of the Asia 
Pacific Rim and Vietnam could be the next Asian tiger. 
  Speaking , Needham said: "The Vietnamese Government is keen 
to work with UK partners and has introduced one of the most 
liberal foreign investment laws in Southeast Asia. I strongly 
urge anyone considering joint venture activity to make the most 
of Vietnam's great potential in the rich butunder-developed 
agricultural and mineral sectors. 
  ``Vietnam has a lot going for it: a wide range of energy and 
mineral resources; an increasingly productive agricultural 
sector; an important strategic position and -- not least -- a 
huge, well educated, resourceful workforce. 
  ``But Vietnam has still to develop a full commercial 
infrastructure. Power, water systems, transport, ports, 
airports and communications, some of which will be multinational 
aid funded, are all essential if Vietnam is to develop its 
industrial base. 
  ``This need is at the centre of the opportunities for 
British 
companies to make the most of the expertise and skills they have 
developed in equally tough markets.'' 
  Exports to Vietnam started from a low base but are rising 
(2.2 million pounds in 1988 to 17 million pounds in 1993.) 
Figures for the first two months of this year have already 
matched the total for last year -- this does not take into 
account indirect exports via Singapore and Hong Kong which could 
double these figures. 
  Needham warned that competition would be tough, particularly 
since the lifting of the US embargo. He outlined a number of 
steps the government was taking to help improve our chances 
against the competition: 

  -  The UK was the first Western 
country to restore medium and longterm export insurance cover 
and has offered a mix of aid and export credit to support 50 
million pounds of business; 
  -  10 million pounds has been made 
available by the Overseas Development Administration for a 
number of technical cooperation projects; 
  -  The Offshore Supplies 
Office of the Department of Trade and Industry [DTI] has 
provided advice to the Vietnamese Government on the oil and gas 
support industries -- there have been four missions to the 
country so far; 
  -  A DTI export promoter, David Kemp, on secondment 
from British Gas, has been appointed to to give advice to 
companies on the Vietnamese market.

<F P=106> [Bronwen Maddox report: "Fund Urged for Closing Reactors"] </F>
  [Text] An independently managed fund, paid for by the 
nuclear power industry, should be set up to meet the cost of 
scrapping reactors, says a report published today by a 
government-commissioned advisory committee. 
  Taxpayers may still have to pay up to 2.9 billion pounds to 
enable Britain's ageing Magnox reactors to be taken out of 
service, the 100-page report, by the Science Policy Research 
Unit at Sussex University, says. 
  The study was commissioned by the government's Radioactive 
Waste Management Advisory Committee, which advises it on the 
methods and costs of dealing with civil nuclear waste. 
  The high and unpredictable costs of decommissioning nuclear 
sites have been one of the nuclear industry's greatest 
headaches. The uncertainty was the main reason for the 
withdrawal of the nuclear industry from the 1989 electricity 
privatisation. 
  The National Audit Office has estimated that future 
decommissioning could eventually cost 18bn pounds and that the 
taxpayer might have to foot the bill as well as the nuclear 
industry. 
  The research unit report says that annual provisions of 
between 1m pounds and 5m pounds for new plants could be 
sufficient to pay for their eventual decommissioning. It points 
out that this is a small proportion of the income of 200m pounds 
a year which a typical plant generating 1100MW might earn. 
  Accurate estimates, however, are hard to make until "real 
progress is made" towards the construction of a store for 
nuclear waste. Plans to develop a store in the rocks underneath 
Sellafield in Cumbria have been delayed several times. 
  The fund would not solve the problem of decommissioning the 
Magnox reactors, the report says. "Over a decade's worth of 
provisions were effectively `lost' at privatisation of the 
electricity industry and expected decommissioning costs have 
risen rapidly in real terms over the last decade." 
  In a separate report the advisory committee says: 
"Government 
could be the guardian of the fund but public confidence might be 
enhanced if the fund was truly independent and retained for the 
sole purpose of decommissioning plant."

<F P=106> [Joe Joyce report: "Takeover Bid for Irish TSB Puts </F>
Coalition in Jeopardy"] 
  [Text] Dublin -- An attempted takeover of Ireland's 
Trustee Savings Bank [TSB] by the smallest of the Irish retail 
banks has threatened a serious split in the coalition government 
and prompted charges by other bankers of secret deals. 
  National Australia Bank, through its National Irish 
subsidiary, is believed to have offered the government about 
IR100 million [Irish pounds] (97 million pounds) for the 
slightly larger TSB. The merger would give the new group about 
10 percent of the Irish market with combined assets of IR2.3 
billion. 
  The deal, approved by the TSB's trustees, would spell the 
end 
of a government policy to establish a third banking force 
through the merger of the TSB and two small state-owned banks, 
the Agricultural Credit Corporation and the Industrial Credit 
Corporation. 
  It has also prompted anger among other banks who are 
interested in the TSB. The main alternative bidder is Ulster 
Bank, the local subsidiary of National Westminster, which made 
an unsuccessful bid for the Dublin TSB three years ago. 
  Ulster's chief executive, David Went, has said it would be 
extraordinary if other banks were not now allowed to bid. The 
TSB can be valued properly only if it is exposed to the market, 
he said. 
  But the main obstacle is the opposition of the Labour Party, 
the junior partner in the coalition government. A third force 
to take on the two dominant Irish banks, AIB and Bank of 
Ireland, is close to its heart. 
  Several Labour backbenchers have condemned the proposed 
deal. 
Dick Spring, party leader and deputy prime minister, insisted 
yesterday that proposals would be considered only in the context 
of existing government policy. "We're not going to be rushed by 
any banker or any person directing his own banking interest," he 
said. 
  The deal is more attractive to Fianna Fail, the main 
government party, especially if it can be presented as creating 
a new force in Irish banking. National Irish and the TSB say 
their merger would provide significant competition by targeting 
the small business and personal customers in whom AIB and Bank 
of Ireland are perceived to have little interest.

  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 3 -- Italy's premier-designate 
Silvio Berlusconi had a half-hour informal meeting this evening 
with Japan's new premier Tsutomu Hata, at the request of the 
latter, "to say hello and get to know each other," Berlusconi's 
spokesman said. 
  Japanese sources explained their premier's wish by recalling 
the importance he places on the July Naples G-7 summit -- the 
reason why he chose Italy to start a European tour which will 
take him to Paris (tomorrow), Bonn and Brussels. 
  Separately, the premier-designate had talks with Italy's 
Ambassador to the United States Boris Banchieri on U.S. 
President Bill Clinton's June 2-3 visit to Italy.

major industrialized countries and economic aid to the former 
Soviet republics, and to Russia in particular, were the two main 
points discussed at a meeting here Tuesday [3 May] between 
Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and caretaker Prime 
Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, a government communique said. 
  Hata, the communique said, confirmed Japan's full support of 
the approach given by the Italian chairmanship of the G-7 
summit, to take place in Naples July 8-10, which will issue two 
separate economic and political statements as well as a 
"declaration" on security summing up talks held at the summit 
with Russian President Boris Yeltsin. 
  Ciampi today reiterated his suggestion that the 
International 
Monetary Fund issue special drawing rights to support economic 
reforms in the former Soviet Union. 
  The two government heads also discussed the situation in 
China, the communique said. 
  After his meeting with Ciampi, the Japanese premier attended 
a working lunch with industrial leaders including Fiat Chairman 
Gianni Agnelli, Alitalia Chairman Renato Riverso and ENI 
[National Hydrocarbons Agency] Managing Director Franco Bernabe.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Berlusconi Satisfied After First Day </F>
of Government-Formation Talks"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 2 -- Premier-designate Silvio 
Berlusconi was "very satisfied" with the "constructive stance" 
of union leaders whom he met on the first day of his 
government-formation consultations, Forza Italia spokesman 
Antonio Tajani said Monday [2 May]. 
  Union leaders also emerged from their talks with Berlusconi 
in buoyant mood: "I feel reassured," said Bruno Trentin, 
national secretary of the leftist CGIL [Italian General 
Confederation of Labor] union. "There could have been a head-on 
collision, but there was not." 
  Sergio D'Antoni, head of CISL [Italian Confederation of 
Trade 
Unions], welcomed the fact that Berlusconi had begun his 
government-formation talks with the unions: "Things may be 
coming up roses. This is a good start, that's for sure: we will 
have to see whether it goes on like this," he commented. 
  UIL [Italian Federation of Trade Unions] chief Pietro 
Larizza 
said that the cost of labour accord hammered out last year had 
been discussed at length, and that Berlusconi had promised that 
"the deal will be respected in its contents and methods." 
  The union leaders, who did not give their approval to 
Berlusconi's outline programme which has yet to be completed, 
also pressed for more investment in industry, an industrial 
policy which is closely linked to demand, and measures to 
improve the labour market and professional training. 
  The prime minister designate, engaged tonight with Fiat 
managing director Cesare Romiti in what he called a "meeting 
between friends," told reporters he thought he might be ready to 
present a government by next Monday. 
  He also confirmed he did not intend to split the Interior 
Ministry in two to accommodate the demands of his Northern 
League partners for a greater role in local administration. 
  Meanwhile League leader Umberto Bossi continued to insist 
his 
group be given control of that important ministerial post -- a 
move that other political forces have warned they do not support 
because they do not believe Bossi is "responsible" enough to 
take on the sensitive job of supervising the nation's police and 
security forces.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Go-Ahead for Fininvest Arrest, </F>
Berlusconi Comments"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 2 -- After a Milan court ruled that 
Marcello Dell'Utri, managing director of Fininvest's Publitalia 
advertising company, and two other top Fininvest executives can 
be arrested, prime minister-designate Silvio Berlusconi roused 
the ire of the magistrate's association when he appeared to take 
sides in that case. 
  Dell'Utri and two others, say Milan prosecutors, doctored 
accounts to conceal a line for slush funds paid to politicians. 
  Berlusconi, commenting on former assistant Dell'Utri's 
arrest 
order, called it "a colossal mistake." The leader of the Forza 
Italia movement said the decision did not affect him personally 
as the arrests "pertain only to Fininvest, which is in fact the 
injured party in this case." 
  He said he was "sure the Cassation Court will set things 
right." The Cassation Court, Italy's supreme court of appeals, 
must now decide on the case. 
  Elena Paciotti, president of the National Association of 
Magistrates, called the Forza Italia leader's comments 
"worrying," in a statement issued this afternoon with the vice 
president of that association Ciro Riviezzo and secretary 
Marcello Maddalena. 
  "It is worrying that a prime minister-designate should 
pronounce himself on a decision in a penal case to go before the 
Cassation Court," the magistrates said. "His statement, which 
is very strong considering the office of the person making it 
takes on the worrying flavor of a message aimed to influence the 
independent justices of the supreme court, and demonstrates a 
singular lack of respect for the rules of due process." 
  Today's ruling overturns an earlier one by a preliminary 
investigations judge in which a request from public prosecutors 
to arrest Dell'Utri and the others was rejected. The court said 
the three can be arrested on charges of falsifying accounts to 
set aside slush funds. 
  Milan Chief Public Prosecutor Francesco Saverio Borrelli, 
whose office had requested a warrant for Dell'Utri, said he was 
"very satisfied" by today's ruling. 
  According to the sentence, Dell'Utri, the director general 
of 
Fininvest's Telepiu' pay-TV station, and Romano Luzi, another 
former top executive in the group owned by Premier-designate 
Silvio Berlusconi, can be arrested because there is a danger 
that they may tamper with the evidence. 
  Luzi left Fininvest to set up the Conaia company, which is 
believed to have falsified its bills to help Publitalia to set 
up its slush funds. 
  The three will not be taken into custody immediately, as 
they 
have the right to contest today's ruling at the Cassation Court. 
But the ruling forbids them from going abroad without permission 
from a judge. 
  In a communique today, Fininvest management expressed its 
backing for Dell'Utri, saying that the advertising company had 
"strong business skills" and functioned with "great 
professionality." 
  "I know the truth of the matter and the truth cannot be 
changed, given what it is," said prime minister-designate Silvio 
Berlusconi this evening, confirming his view that the arrest 
orders for three Fininvest managers were "a colossal mistake." 
  "I don't believe there are any negative aspects to what I 
know. I said the judges had made a big mistake and I confirm 
that," the Forza Italia leader told reporters.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "President Thanks Outgoing Premier, </F>
Labor Minister"] 
  [Excerpt] (ANSA) Rome, May 1 -- Head of State Oscar Luigi 
Scalfaro praised the outgoing premier, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, for 
what he said were his "enormous labors" on the employment front 
and the "exceptional time" of the historic wage pact signed at 
the end of July last year by the three trade union 
confederations, the government and business and industry 
representatives. 
  Speaking today in the Presidential Quirinale Palace at a 
Labor Day ceremony for the award of "stars of merit" to new 
"masters of labor" from the Lazio and Umbria regions, the 
president extended his glowing words to include the labor 
minister in Ciampi's cabinet, Gino Giugni, and the activities of 
the government installed at the end of April last year. 
  Addressing the gathering which included Ciampi and Giugni, 
Scalfaro recalled the "burst of applause" of the constituent 
assembly of the republic on hearing of the constitutional 
definition of Italy as a republic "founded on labor." 
  "A fine definition because it lends dignity, defends the 
dignity of man. And this is where thanks are added, thanks due 
as an act of justice from the head of state to Premier Ciampi," 
added the president. 
  The labor minister, who spoke earlier, defined "the great 
cooperation agreement between the government and the labor and 
business sides" signed July 23 last year as "a genuine social 
pact" and voiced the hope that "this experience will be 
prolonged under the sign of continuity in the new phase 
beginning." 
  Recalling his year in office, Giugni referred to the 70,000 
workers "in excess," especially those on the workforces of the 
automaker Fiat, Ing. C. Olivetti SpA and at the Enichem plant in 
the southern city of Crotone and named this problem as not only 
Italian but European and world-wide. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Rome (DPA) -- The talks conducted by Federal 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl with Cardinal State Secretary Angelo 
Sodano in The Vatican on Tuesday [3 May] focussed on 
possibilities for cooperation in the search for a peaceful 
solution for Bosnia-Herzegovina. Other issues discussed in the 
meeting with the "head of government" of the church state were 
the enlargement of the European Union, and the role of United 
Nations in international hotspots, Vatican Spokesman Joaquin 
Navarro-Valls said. Bilateral issues, such as the relationship 
between the church and state in the FRG were also broached. 
  Kohl, who is due to return to Bonn on Tuesday night, asked 
Sodano to convey to Pope John Paul II his best wishes for 
recovery on behalf of the Federal Government. Originally, the 
chancellor was scheduled to meet the pope, but the private 
audience had to be canceled due to the church leader's hip 
operation on Friday. 
  Upon his arrival in Rome on Monday night, Kohl paid tribute 
to John Paul's role in the reshaping of Europe. The pope made 
"an essential contribution to overcoming totalitarianism and the 
division of Germany and Europe," Kohl said at a reception in the 
German Embassy in the Vatican.

<F P=106> [Ignacio Cembrero report: "Prime Minister Cancels Official </F>
Visit for Domestic Reasons for First Time"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez yesterday 
canceled the official visit that he had planed to pay to Romania 
and Bulgaria starting tomorrow. This is the first time since 
acceding to the prime ministership in 1982 that Gonzalez has 
canceled an officially announced visit for domestic political 
reasons. In mid-morning a communique from the general 
secretariat of the government spokesman's office announced the 
indefinite postponement of the visit to the aforementioned 
countries. 
  The announcement of the cancellation came 40 hours before 
the 
departure time and when some members of the official retinue -- 
mainly bodyguards -- and several journalists from Madrid were 
already in Bucharest. 
  Foreign Ministry officials believe that the deterioration in 
the domestic political situation poses a threat to the prime 
minister's entire program of international activity in May and 
June, which is a very busy one. 
  Gonzalez's next official visit, starting 15 May, is to 
Paraguay, the only Latin American country which he has not 
visited. "Let us hope," one diplomat joked yesterday, "that 
Mariano Rubio does not disappear two days beforehand -- 
following Luis Roldan's example -- and set back this visit too." 
  In diplomatic circles it is also considered a virtual 
certainty that Gonzalez's summit meeting with Helmut Kohl -- 
scheduled for 6-7 June in the former East Germany, five days 
before the European elections -- will also be canceled. 
  The same circles also fear that the Conference of Latin 
American Nations in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, on 14-15 June 
will be neglected in the Spanish press. Gonzalez plans to 
arrive there the day after the European election, and his 
interpretation of the results will relegate the meeting to the 
background. 
  Apart from Cartagena, another appointment that the prime 
minister cannot avoid is the European summit in Corfu, Greece, 
on 23-24 June, which will appoint the next president of the 
European Commission. 
  Gonzalez had so organized matters as to leave most of his 
international activity until after the PSOE [Spanish Socialist 
Workers Party] congress in March. The following week he 
received President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev and in 
April he received Russian chief of state Boris Yeltsin and UN 
Secretary General Butrus-Ghali. 
  Immediately after the Rubio scandal exploded Gonzalez's 
joint 
press conference with Yeltsin 12 April was the shortest that 
people could remember in the hall of the government spokesman's 
general secretariat. The Spanish prime minister made sure to 
take questions from journalists that he knew and that would only 
ask him about matters relating to foreign policy. There were no 
questions about the Rubio affair.

<F P=106> [Report by A. Diez and L.R. Aizpolea: "Prime Minister </F>
Postpones Any Decision on the Government Until 12 June Results 
Are Known"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez has put 
together an initial plan of action for the next four weeks which 
rules out compliance with any of the opposition's demands. He 
is not considering resigning or handing over to another PSOE 
[Spanish Socialist Workers Party] member; he does not plan to 
submit to a confidence vote in parliament; and he does not 
intend to propose a series of resignations in light of his 
acceptance of Interior Minister Antoni Asuncion's resignation. 
  Nor does he intend to reshuffle the government. All the 
government and PSOE sources we consulted -- except for a 
minority demanding immediate measures -- recognize, however, 
that these actions, or at least some of them, may be implemented 
after the European and local Andalusian elections on 12 June, as 
long as the Nationalists continue to support the government. 
That support is assured for the time being. 
  The Socialist leader is to make no statements today, leaving 
the limelight to the outgoing interior minister. The government 
now expects the opposition to use Asuncion's gesture as an 
excuse to attack Gonzalez for not resigning. Sparks are 
guaranteed to start flying at the spokesmen's committee meeting, 
during which the People's Party representatives are to demand 
that Gonzalez appear before a special congress plenum. 
  The government has no intention of submitting to the 
opposition's diktats, judging by the statements issued after 
Gonzalez' appearance before his party's Federal Committee on 
Friday [29 April] evening. Joaquin Leguina, Madrid's Autonomous 
Community president, and Joaquin Almunia, the PSOE member 
responsible for research and programs, tried yesterday to lend 
political weight to Felipe Gonzalez' instruction that 
"hysterical reaction" must be avoided. 
  "We are on the eve of the 12 June European and Andalusian 
elections of 12 June and a chain of resignations would lead to 
instability; we must think ahead, a little beyond the situation 
entangling us," Leguina urged, not forgetting to direct a few 
choice epithets at Luis Roldan and Mariano Rubio. 
  Almunia pointed out that the prime minister recently took 
part in the debate on the state of the nation and, on that 
occasion, it was seen that he has the confidence of a majority 
in the Chamber of Deputies. The Socialists admit that the 
situation would become unsustainable if the CiU [Convergence and 
Union] withdraws its support, which would mean that the Gonzalez 
government could not push even one more law through. 
  The calm picture that is being painted by the Moncloa [prime 
minister's residence] and the PSOE's main leaders was reinforced 
by Deputy Prime Minister Narcis Serra in Barcelona last night. 
  The deputy prime minister set out to confirm the 
government's 
basic contention that it is capable of running the country with 
the support of the Catalan Nationalists and, in some instances, 
that of the PNV [Basque Nationalist Party]. Serra stressed that 
the Socialists' fight against corruption is its main task, 
although this might initially cause the party's image to 
deteriorate further. 
<H5>  Minority Opinion </H5>
  The government's strategy is countered by a minority in the 
PSOE, especially the Socialist Left faction and certain regional 
leaders. They are calling for an immediate gesture from 
Gonzales. In the opinion of this group, which has made its view 
known to the prime minister, it is politically dangerous for him 
to allow too much time to elapse without making any drastic 
decisions, since public opinion is shocked and demands decisive 
political gestures. 
  According to these high-ranking Socialists, these demands 
should be met with a sweeping change of government. A change of 
government, the Socialists add, which would have a cathartic 
effect, freshen up the image, and save Gonzalez from a 
no-confidence vote. Those defending this proposal suggest that a 
change of government would also boost the executive's battered 
political profile, which currently leaves a lot to be desired. 
  This position, however, is not shared by the majority of the 
Socialist leadership, which believes that implementing the 
changes now would leave no political alternatives to offer 
public opinion if the 12 June elections do not go well. 
  Public Works and Transportation Minister Jose Borrell, 
speaking in Fuerteventura yesterday, referred to the Roldan and 
Rubio cases saying: "It takes a lot more than two unscrupulous 
men to tip the historical scales of Spanish socialism toward 
`negative.'" Borrell mentioned that he could not say "which of 
the two is worse, because I cannot choose between the plague and 
cholera."

<F P=106> [Aitor Guenaga report: "ETA Announces New Attacks and </F>
Affirms: `We Will Win'"] 
  [Text] Bilbao -- The terrorist organization, ETA [Basque 
Fatherland and Liberty], yesterday claimed responsibility for 
the latest attacks, issuing a victorious statement via the daily 
newspaper EGIN far removed from defeatism. "We will win," 
assured the text published by the Guizpucoa newspaper. "The era 
of resistance, the doubts, and the false expectations" are all 
over, according to the armed gang. ETA defended the need to 
continue the attacks in order to achieve its oft-repeated goal: 
Basque independence. "We cannot keep on hoping, nor can we 
place our hopes in miracle solutions. We must obtain new 
results on the road to liberty through our daily struggle." 
  In the two-page press release, written entirely in Basque, 
ETA claimed responsibility for the attack which took the life of 
Civil Guard member Fernando Jimenez Pascual on 4 April in 
Bilbao. Similarly, it said it was responsible for the grenade 
attack carried out on 18 April against the Military Command in 
Barcelona, which cost the life of compatriot Vicente Beti 
Montesinos, who was close to the organization, and whose death, 
the terrorist gang said, was unfortunate. 
  Lastly, the group claimed that it set the devices which 
caused the 20 April explosion on the railroad line linking 
Madrid and Irun, as well as the action against a branch of the 
Caja Vital [bank] in Salvatierra (Alava). Herri Batasuna 
[United People] is waging a battle with that bank because of 
failure to pay a debt. 
  In addition to its triumphalist rhetoric, ETA made a wager 
on 
the unity of the nationalist left: "This is not the time to 
seek out differences, but to develop the issues and sectors in 
which we can work jointly at the same pace and with the same 
initiatives." However, he repeated his speech about the double 
model used for the Basque Country: the model of those who 
condemn the people to disappear, and the model "proposed by the 
nationalist left, which seeks a new society in an independent 
Euskal Herria [Basque Union]." 
<H5>  "Jabotxa" Still Being Detained </H5>
  In the meantime, the editor in chief of EGIN, Patxi Xabier 
Fernandez Monje, or "Jabotxa," who was taken into custody 
Saturday afternoon [30 April] for his presumed links with ETA, 
was still in custody yesterday at the Indautin police station. 
Herri Batasuna's legal representative, Arantza Zulueta, went to 
Bilbao to defend him. On Saturday night, the police searched 
the dwelling of the EGIN editor without, apparently, taking 
anything, according to one of the newspaper's employees. 
  The detention of EGIN's editor in chief is linked to the 
open 
operation against ETA following the downfall last Thursday of 
the leader of the Barcelona commando and a former member of 
Herri Batasuna's national board, Felipe San Epifiano, known as 
Pipe. Jabotxa and Pipe were sentenced in 1985 by the high court 
to six months and one day in prison for public disorder, along 
with six other members of Jarrai (KAS [expansion unknown] youth).

<F P=106> [Article by G. S.: "Is Part-Time Work Cheaper? Flexible </F>
Working Hours as an Employment Policy Tool"] 
  [Text] According to a study of the McKinsey 
Deutschland business consulting firm, numerous jobs could be 
created in an economically viable manner with flexible part-time 
work solutions. The research study arrives at cost savings of up 
to 20 percent, which, at least in part, should be passed on to 
the part-time workers. A study presented on Thursday [21 April] 
by ETH Zurich points in a similar direction. 
  Unemployment in Switzerland seems to be declining slowly 
once 
again, but thinking about possible ways out of the employment 
crisis remains a necessity. For one thing, in Switzerland, with 
an unemployment rate only half that in many surrounding 
countries, we cannot and should not think of ourselves as an 
island of the blessed. For another, 180,000 unemployed are far 
too many unemployed. The idea of a general reduction of 
work time plays an especially prominent role in the public 
discussion about instruments of employment policy. Discussion 
about this subject in the media has gained in substance 
recently, but even with varied arguments, the simplistic and 
static notion comes through that a reduction of work time must, 
in principle, lead to a corresponding increase in employment. 
<H5>  Advantages for Both Sides </H5>
  Of particular interest in this context is a comprehensive 
research project by McKinsey Deutschland, which in the past few 
weeks has been quoted repeatedly and fragmentarily. (Dividing 
and Gaining, "The Potential of the Flexible Shortening of Work 
Hours," McKinsey &amp; Co., 1994 (Project Management: Helmut 
Hagemann). It concludes that the systematic introduction of 
flexible part-time work offers the best possibilities 
for alleviating the problem of unemployment, and it supports 
this with ample microeconomic research and data. According to 
the study, a massive acceleration of part-time work in Germany 
that pays due regard to the diversity of business and individual 
realities could net a maximum of 1.4 million full-time or 1.9 
million part-time jobs. If we apply this thesis to Switzerland, 
we probably will not come up with analogous figures. In other 
words, the effect on employment would clearly be less than 
150,000. The part-time rate in the Federal Republic--a good 15 
percent--is only a little more than half that in Switzerland (28 
percent). On the other hand, what is applicable is the basic 
individualistic assessment of the study, which considers only 
those jobs as part-time potential the reapportioning of which 
would be desirable for both sides, for employers and 
employees. According to the study, that applies to 24 percent of 
existing full-time jobs. We are talking here about those jobs 
for which conversion to part-time, despite conversion costs for 
the business, would yield cost advantages and whose present 
"holders" would be prepared to accept a reduction in work hours 
if losses in wages could be kept within bounds. 
<H5>  Gaining Through Dividing </H5>
  In a sense, the McKinsey study removes the contrast between 
the desire of the employer for a proportionate 
reduction in wages in the case of an all-encompassing reduction 
in work time and the demand of the employee for at least partial 
wage compensation. How is this successful? According to the 
study, cost reductions in a significant degree can be expected 
through advantages of flexibility: Individually tailored 
part-time models should produce average savings of 
about 20 percent of the personnel costs of part-time workers. 
These savings are rooted first in higher labor 
productivity, which is the result of less fatigue as well 
as better motivation. Second, flexible part-time work would 
produce reductions in costs resulting from fluctuating 
work capacity. The thinking here is cyclical part-time 
plans, say, annual work hours contracts on a part-time basis or 
a "block model" (for example, nine months of work, three months 
off). Third and finally, an increase in capital deepening could 
bring advantages. With voluntary flexibility and reduction of 
work hours, work time and business hours could be expanded, and 
thus capital could be better utilized. 
<H5>  Destigmatizing Part-Time Work </H5>
  McKinsey people feel they can limit the financial effects on 
workers in two ways and thus increase willingness to 
work part time. For one thing, the progressive taxes and dues 
structure causes available income to be reduced less than 
performed work time. For another, the study appeals to 
businesses to pass along a part of the savings gained through 
part-time work to the employees. Without a partial wage 
adjustment, the authors feel that sufficient acceptance 
cannot be achieved. Besides a lot of detailed technical 
analysis, the McKinsey study is mainly an argument for a 
positive part-time climate. Part-time work today is 
associated too much with marginal activities like janitoring and 
cleaning or, at most, simple office work. Managers still think 
too much about additional costs and disturbances in the work 
plan, which we know from traditional part-time regulations. And 
this form of work is too often thought of as a career dead end, 
the study says. The study suggests not only giving workers 
comprehensive information concerning part-time models as well as 
a promotional campaign showing financial advantages, but it goes 
further: Should dismissals prove necessary, they should not 
primarily affect those workers who agreed to flexible and 
shortened work hours. The authors feel that willingness to work 
part-time should reduce the threat of dismissal and be seen as a 
plus for promotions. 
  In its principal thrust, the McKinsey study agrees with a 
study on the same subject presented in Zurich on Thursday [21 
April], which was carried out by the ETH [Federal Technical 
School] and sponsored, among other things, by the SMUV [Swiss 
Metalworkers and Watchmakers Association]. (Hans Wuergler, 
Publisher: Work Hours and Unemployment. A Discussion of 
Employment Policy in Switzerland. Zurich, 1994) It, too, rejects 
across-the-board shortening of work hours and emphasizes the 
importance of voluntarism, individuality, and 
flexibility. The Zurich study, published by Professor Hans 
Wuergler, points in this connection above all to the 
possibilities of moving away into the shadow economy 
and to the flight toward overtime, which are contrary to any 
general solution. Moreover, both studies, strongly emphasize the 
exceptional importance of cyclical work hours models, 
which adapt flexibly to seasonal as well as to economic 
fluctuations. According to the ETH study, this requires for 
Switzerland especially a reform of part-time insurance. 
<H5>  The Contribution of Politics </H5>
  While McKinsey strongly addresses businesses and attempts 
painstakingly to prove to them that flexible part-time models 
now and then--more precisely: in about 60 percent of all jobs 
after two years at most--pay off, the ETH study reminds us more 
strongly of the present political conditions. It 
calls especially for a lowering of the fixed costs of labor 
through, among other things, a reform of the national insurance 
system (mainly greater generosity in the pension funds); through 
more preventive measures aimed at further training on the part 
of unemployment insurance; through financing unemployment 
insurance, say, by means of an energy tax or using general 
funds, but certainly not by means of higher wage deductions; and 
finally through liberalization of policies governing aliens. 
  Above all, both studies realize that the potential of making 
work hours more flexible is by no means exhausted and that with 
the right steps one could do more than reduce unemployment. What 
is more, making work hours more flexible could contribute to 
social development and to strengthening each 
individual's control over his or her time.

UN battalion already in Bosnia. The British UN commander in 
Bosnia, Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose, made an appeal for 
more soldiers at a meeting in Denmark yesterday of Nordic 
defense ministers. The ministers also say today they would like 
strong decisive leadership of the UN military operations in 
Bosnia. Radio Sweden's Toni Rafidi has more: 
  [Rafidi] The Nordic defense ministers said better leadership 
is needed in UN military operations. However, they supported 
last Friday's incident when Danish tanks responded to a Bosnian 
Serb artillery attack near the Nordic battalion headquarters in 
Tuzla in northern Bosnia. [passage omitted] 
  Commander Rose indicated at a news conference on 2 May that 
peace would come quicker if the UN had more soldiers, and said 
he believes the earlier Gorazde disaster could have been avoided 
if they had had more ground troops. 
  [Begin Rose recording] And by not having enough troops we 
take enormous risks and sometimes we have disasters, as we saw 
with Gorazde. Had we had troops in Gorazde, the 800 troops that 
I'd been promised for Gorazde, then I do not believe that the 
Bosnian Serb Army would have attacked that safe area. Well, we 
need about another 10,000 troops in all to sustain the level of 
activity that we are sustaining at the moment. [end recording] 
  [Rafidi] But today the defense ministers announced the 
Nordic 
countries will not be sending more troops. Sweden says that the 
close to 1,600 soldiers already there makes it one of the 
biggest per capita contributors of troops in the former 
Yugoslavia. 
  Sweden's Defense Minister Anders Bjoerck mentioned the 
United 
States as one country that should contribute more and, while at 
a news conference in Washington on Monday after having informal 
talks with top White House officials, Swedish Prime Minister 
Carl Bildt took the opportunity to criticize the U.S. policy of 
not sending ground troops to Bosnia. He said he thought it was 
totally natural for the Americans to take part in ground 
defense, adding that he thought it could become askew [as heard] 
when a leading nation only helps out while being 2,000 meters in 
the air.

<F P=106> ["rb" report: "German Presidency Gives Rise to Little Hope"] </F>
  [Text] Frankfurt/Main -- In Brussels there are obviously 
few expectations placed on the German presidency of the European 
Union [EU]. Helmut Steinel, who is responsible for relations 
with the Council of Ministers in the Secretariat General, gives 
two main reasons for that: The Bundestag elections in the 
middle of the term of the presidency, which goes to Bonn during 
the second half of the year as part of the rotation, and the 
problems of scarce funds. 
  Steinel sees virtually no chance until the year 1999 for 
reducting the German net contribution to the European Union -- 
according to the Commission, all in all about 23 billion German 
marks [DM] -- that FRG Finance Minister Theo Waigel has 
demanded. Until then, the financial distribution is determined 
by the decisions made at the summit in Edinburgh at the end of 
1992. Only afterwards could there be an easing of the burden on 
the Germans, in particular when the transition period expires 
for the four would-be members (Sweden, Austria, Norway, 
Finland), during which their usual net contribution (about DM3 
billion) will be halved. 
  In Steinel's view, until then German payments to Brussels 
can 
be reduced only by saving more than in the past in the European 
Union. However, the Commission official is "skeptical regarding 
the will" of the 12 members "to save." For him it would already 
be a "success" of the German presidency, "if no new items for 
expenditure would be created." 
  This, however, is in contradiction with the central tasks in 
the second half of the year: The implementation of the 
proposals by EU President Jacques Delors (white paper) to combat 
unemployment. With regard to the planned infrastructure 
projects, Steinel primarily expects "financing by the private 
sector" with, at best, minor interest subsidies from Brussels' 
coffers. In total, the preliminary draft of the Commission for 
the 1955 EU budget (German share: 28.4 percent) contains only 
ECU300 million (about DM550 million) for the white paper 
project. The budget, which amounts to DM137 billion this year, 
is to increase by 3.4 percent in 1995. A total of 58 percent of 
that is allocated to agricultural policy. 
  Regarding this by far largest block of expenditures in 
particular, Bonn has "not always advocated saving" in the past. 
Thus, the protection of German farmers from the effects of the 
currency turbulence on agricultural prices last year cost the 
European Union about DM2 billion. 
  Steinel does see one initiative to be started by future EU 
President Helmut Kohl: The chancellor wants to make his 
European affairs adviser Juergen Trumpf, state secretary in the 
Foreign Ministry, the new secretary general of the Council of 
Ministers -- "a very influential position."

  [Text] Luxembourg, May 3 (AFP) -- The European Court of 
Justice ruled Tuesday [3 May] that Belgium was guilty of 
discrimination against foreign students from other European 
Union [EU] countries. 
  It said in a ruling that Belgium had flouted EU treaties by 
asking students from other EU countries to pay higher enrollment 
fees than non-Belgians. 
  The Court also blasted Belgium for fixing a 2-percent quota 
on the number of EU students which Belgian universities must 
mandatorily enroll. 
  The ruling followed a plea lodged by the European 
Commission, 
whose job it is to check that member states stick by EU rules.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Rolf Falter: "Not Indispensable"] </F>
  [Text] With what sense of exaggeration could we say today 
that Jean-Luc Dehaene has become a destabilizing element in 
British domestic policy? Dehaene's unspoken candidacy for the 
succession of Jacques Delors as President of the European 
Commission (EC) has attracted great attention in the British 
press and produced a real hate campaign which is apparently also 
being fueled from Whitehall. From now on, the European profile 
of the Belgian prime minister will be an element in the debate 
that has arisen again in the governing Conservative Party. 
Officially, that argument revolves around Great Britain's 
future in Europe, but it is also just as much about the future 
of John Major as the British prime minister. 
  In the flood of words, not everyone appears to be too 
bothered about the facts. And one section of the British press 
does not know the difference between intelligence and intellect. 
However, the polemics also show how self-satisfied the European 
Union (EU) would be even without the ever-critical and 
suspicious British. Over the past few days, some British 
newspapers quite rightly denounced the fact that the EC 
president is being chosen on a French-German couch from people 
who should above all deny that they are candidates and who have 
not necessarily reached their present position through 
elections. The British very modestly say nothing about the 
logical conclusion of their criticism: Let the European 
electorate or the democratically elected European Parliament 
designate the EC president. 
  Should no German candidate emerge, then the fight will be 
between Dehaene and his Netherlands colleague Ruud Lubbers. 
With France and Germany backing Dehaene, Lubbers will probably 
only have a chance if Major finds support for him in Madrid or 
with Silvio Berlusconi. That could result in a nice little 
auction of European structural funds. 
  The qualities of both candidates matter less. Those who say 
that the EU today needs, above all, to make the inspired ideas 
and decisions of Jacques Delors workable and practicable will 
find Jean-Luc Dehaene the natural candidate. On the other hand, 
anyone who is seeking any degree of understanding for the 
Anglo-Saxon skepticism regarding a forced trend toward European 
federalism, the craving to squander and to be meddlesome, and 
the democratic deficit in the EU must choose Lubbers. Moreover, 
both prime ministers are pragmatists, hard workers, poor 
orators, and highly experienced politicians. 
  Meanwhile, in Belgium, people are driving themselves crazy 
wondering whether Dehaene can and may go. That is pure 
nonsense. For apart from concluding that the prime minister can 
earn himself a healthy promotion, it would also be good for this 
country to have someone occupying Jacques Delors' seat. 
  Then there remains the argument that Dehaene is 
indispensable 
for the present government and for this country. That argument 
says more about Belgium's vulnerability than about the man who 
has dominated and fashioned politics for 15 years. Nobody is 
indispensable. Neither a government nor a country deserves to 
survive if its fate is determined by a single heartbeat.

  [Text] Here in the Netherlands the current coalition 
government of Christian Democrats and Social Democrats has lost 
its majority in parliament after yesterday's parliamentary 
elections. 
  The Christian Democrats, the CDA, received more than 35 
percent of the vote in the 1989 general election, but they have 
now slumped to just over 22 percent. The Social Democrats 
[PvdA] also lost ground. Their share of the votes fell from 32 
percent to 24 percent, but they emerged as the largest party in 
the new Dutch parliament. The two major opposition parties -- 
the Conservative Liberal VVD, and the Progressive Liberal D66 -- 
made significant gains in the elections. Both now have a 
significant number of seats in parliament. The remaining seats 
were won by a total of eight smaller parties. 
  The results provide no firm indication of the composition of 
the new government. It is clear, though, that any new coalition 
government will need the backing of at least three parties to 
secure a parliamentary majority.

  [Text] During a gathering of party heads last night to 
review the election results, Elco Brinkman, CDA [Christian 
Democratic Appeal] leader, said that he would not step down 
following his party's historic defeat. 
  [Brinkman] "Assuming my responsibility does not mean 
assuming 
my responsibilities during good weather only. Usually, the 
captain is most needed when the ship is sailing in bad weather." 
  [Unidentified reporter] "Does this mean that you will remain 
as CDA leader? 
  [Brinkman] "Well, I am saying that it is not usual to refuse 
to take up one's responsibilities in bad weather." 
  D66's [Democrats 66] Van Mierlo was happy, despite 
expectations of a better outcome, about the result for his 
party, whose seats in parliament increased from 12 to 24 seats. 
  [Van Mierlo] "I simply will say that the present which the 
electors have given us is so nice that it would be unsuitable to 
say: Could it not have been even nicer?" 
  The PvdA's [Labor Party] Wim Kok did not rule out that the 
standard of living of people on welfare or social benefits would 
drop during the next cabinet period. Contrary to the VVD 
[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy], the PvdA does not 
want the system changed. 
  [Kok] "The people in need know that the coming years are 
highly uncertain. Promising stability is out of the question. 
I am just saying: No further changes on top of wage and social 
benefit restraints. And that is quite a different matter." 
  The VVD's Frits Bolkestein refused in advance to participate 
in a cabinet with the CDA and PvdA. 
  [Bolkestein] "If the CDA as well as PvdA have to govern 
because of a lack of their success, it will be without us. We 
will not participate." 
  According to Bolkestein, the result shows that the voters 
reject the policies followed by the current government.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Kok: People's Party for Freedom </F>
and Democracy Must Review Its Position on Illegal Immigrants"] 
  [Text] Wim Kok, PvdA [Labor Party] leader, said that the 
VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] could not have a 
place in the new cabinet if it stuck to its position that the 
children of illegal immigrants should not be allowed into 
schools in the Netherlands. "Bolkestein will not enter the new 
cabinet if that is his demand," Kok said yesterday evening in 
Amsterdam. 
  The VVD leader's position about the children of illegal 
immigrants, stated last week in a debate on television, is an 
obstacle to the "purple" coalition [comprising the PvdA, the 
VVD, and the Democrats 66 (D66)], in the eyes of the PvdA. 
"There are barriers which you cannot cross mentally and 
morally," Kok said. 
  At yesterday's May Day celebration, it emerged that in the 
PvdA, doubts are increasing about whether a cabinet with the VVD 
is possible. Minister Van Thijn said that the gap between his 
party and the VVD "is very big" and during the election campaign 
"is getting bigger day by day." A "purple" coalition was only 
possible if "the VVD does not get the opportunity to attack the 
social justice of this country," Van Thijn said. 
  Yesterday PvdA leading candidate Kok would not say whether 
he 
preferred a "purple" coalition or a coalition with the CDA 
[Christian Democratic Appeal], but he did say: "I can imagine 
that it is possible to make better agreements with the CDA on 
the social question than with the VVD. With its proposals, the 
VVD is taking the most extreme position." PvdA chairman 
Rottenberg also noted that the VVD, with its positions on 
foreigners, was making it "extremely difficult" to achieve a 
"purple" coalition. 
  On AVRO radio yesterday, Prime Minister Lubbers said he 
expected the CDA and the D66 to act together in the coming 
cabinet formation and the PvdA to also probably be part of the 
next cabinet. "It is best for tackling social and economic 
problems that the CDA and the PvdA work together," he said. 
"The best way to follow up the fight against crime is a 
dialogue between the CDA and the D66." 
  In Amsterdam yesterday, Kok said that it was possible that 
he 
would become prime minister in the coming cabinet. But he 
warned the PvdA against euphoria, now that it could possibly 
become the biggest party, even though according to the opinion 
polls it will not come close to getting the 49 seats it has at 
present. "If we get 35 or 36 seats, that is a serious blow. 
The fact that we would then be the biggest party is not 
sufficient compensation for that." 
  Yesterday, the Green Left Party pronounced itself in favor 
of 
a progressive cabinet (with the PvdA and D66), if necessary, 
governing with VVD support. If the three left-wing parties 
together got 70 seats then "the right can move aside," Brouwer, 
the [Green Left] party's leading candidate, said.

  [Text] The Netherlands is to discuss with Sri Lanka the 
possible repatriation of Tamils residing in the Netherlands. 
One and a half weeks ago, the Foreign Ministry asked its 
representative in Colombo to start discussions on the subject 
with the authorities in Sri Lanka. 
  This move was a response by the Foreign Ministry to a 
request 
by Netherlands State Secretary for Justice Kosto. The Justice 
Ministry believes the discussions should lead to an agreement in 
principle on the return of the Tamils, in the manner of similar 
agreements concluded with Sri Lanka by Switzerland and India. 
  If the Netherlands and Sri Lanka are able to reach such an 
agreement, the repatriation will take place under UNHCR [United 
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees] supervision. The 
Justice Ministry believes that some 20,000 Tamils are living in 
the Netherlands. The size of the group which would be liable 
for compulsory repatriation is not known. 
  Civil war is still waging in the north of Sri Lanka where 
armed Tamils are fighting for their own state. The Foreign 
Ministry considers the south and center of the country to be 
"safe." "The internal refugee situation has improved," a 
Justice Ministry spokesman reported. The Netherlands has 
previously concluded a repatriation agreement with Vietnam.

<F P=106> [Safa Haeri report: "Iran Tried To Hire IRA Hit-Men"] </F>
  [Text] The IRA has turned down a request by Tehran to 
assassinate three leading Iranian dissidents in exchange for 
explosives, guns, missiles and cash, according to informed 
sources in Iran. 
  The deal was allegedly put to IRA representatives by 
officials from the Iranian Information (intelligence) Ministry 
at a meeting in Tehran last November but was turned down in 
February this year. 
  This latest revelation comes after the Iranian charge 
d'affaires in London, Gholamreza Ansari, was summoned to the 
Foreign Office last Thursday [24 April] to be told that known 
contacts with the IRA should cease. British intelligence had 
information that Iran was plotting to supply the IRA with guns 
and money. 
  The Iranian sources, who have contact with the Information 
Ministry, said that at last November's meeting the Iranians 
offered to meet an IRA "shopping list" in exchange for the 
murder of three named people. The list 
included: 

  -  Micro-communications and eavesdropping 
equipment; 
  -  Semtex explosive; 
  -  Eight Stinger surface-to-air 
missiles; 
  -  400 Colt pistols and 80,000 rounds of ammunition; 
  -  100 
Uzi submachine guns and 50,000 rounds of ammunition; 
  -  $6 million 
(4 million pounds) in counterfeit dollar bills and $500,000 in 
real bills. 
  The IRA was to assassinate three people: the former Iranian 
president, Abolhasan Bani-Sadr, exiled in France since 1981; 
Javad Dabiran, a spokesman for the opposition People's Mujahedin 
Organisation, based in Bonn; and Farzaneh Ta'idi, a prominent 
Iranian actress exiled in London. Ms Ta'idi angered the regime 
for her part in the 1991 film "Not Without My Daughter," which 
depicts the plight of the American-born wife of an Iranian 
stranded in post-revolution Iran. 
  The offer was made on the margins of a meeting in the 
Iranian 
capital which also involved the Greek left-wing group November 
17, Corsican nationalists and ETA, the Basque separatists, the 
sources said. 
  They said the IRA took three months to consider the scheme, 
though informed Western sources said the IRA was known to have 
rejected previous proposals to carry out assassinations, 
including requests from Libya. 
  The Iranian sources also gave new details of contacts 
between 
Iran and the IRA going back to shortly after the 1979 
revolution, when IRA representatives attended a "world meeting 
of liberation organisations" in Tehran. 
  At that time, Tehran wanted the IRA to provide weapons and 
logistics for Iranian teams sent to Europe to kill prominent 
opponents of the new regime, including General Fereyduon Jam, a 
brother-in-law of the late Shah, Ardeshir Zahedi, a former 
ambassador to Washington, and Shapour Bakhtiar, the Shah's last 
prime minister, who was murdered in Paris in 1992. The 
assassinations did not go ahead, although the sources did not 
know if this was because the IRA had refused to co-operate. 
  The initial reaction from Tehran to last week's British 
warning was muted. But over the weekend the tone of press 
comment hardened, after a briefing by Hojatoleslam Hosayn 
Ruhani, chairman of the Parliamentary Defence Committee. 
  "How can anyone criticise Iran for having contacts with the 
IRA when the United States does exactly the same when it 
receives Mr Gerry Adams?" said the radical daily SALAM. 
  The semi-official daily ETELAAT in effect confirmed the 
Iran-IRA contacts when it said: "Why, when British MPs and 
government officials rationalise their direct contacts with 
Iranian terrorists (a reference to the People's Mujahedin 
leadership)...should the same not apply to Iran? Why should we 
be ashamed of our contacts?" 
  The official news agency, IRNA, quoted an unidentified Sinn 
Fein spokesman denouncing the British allegations of 
co-operation between the IRA and Iran as "baseless and 
trouble-making." "The noises the British make are because of 
their failure to reach peaceful agreement over Ireland," the 
spokesman was quoted as saying. He claimed Britain was trying 
to cover up the arming of loyalist terrorists by MI5. 
  It is known in Northern Ireland that the IRA has long wanted 
Stinger missiles to shoot down Army helicopters, and the cash on 
offer from Iran would have been tempting in the face of British 
measures against IRA fund-raising. 
  On the other hand, high-profile assassinations attract 
intelligence attention and the IRA would not relish a "guns for 
hire" image. In particular, killings on behalf of Iran would 
damage the republican movement's American support.

  [Text] Canada is not enthusiastic about the idea of sending 
more peacekeeping troops to Rwanda. Defense Minister David 
Collenette says a UN relief effort such as being used in Bosnia 
would have to be approved by the Canadian cabinet. He said a 
solution to the chaos in Rwanda may have to be part of a larger 
solution to war, famine, disease, and poverty in Africa. The UN 
has reduced the number of its peacekeepers in Rwanda from 2,500 
to about 270. 
  The head of the UN contingent, Canadian Major General Romeo 
Dallaire, says more peacekeepers would help the situation there. 
The UN is reported to be studying a plan to pay for African 
troops to intervene in the Rwandan civil war.

<F P=106> ["bhr" report: "PLO Chairman 'Arafat a Guest of </F>
Daimler-Benz in Stuttgart"] 
  [Text] Stuttgart, 2 May -- Two days before the planned 
signing of the autonomy agreement with Israel, PLO Chairman 
'Arafat expressed the hope in Stuttgart that the Palestinians 
might learn from the experiences of the Germans, because the 
Germans reconstructed their economy from scratch after World War 
II. 'Arafat, who had come to Stuttgart on Monday [2 May] upon 
invitation by the Daimler-Benz AG, said that since the entire 
infrastructure in the occupied territories has been destroyed, 
Palestine must "start from scratch." 
  Edzard Reuter, chairman of the Daimler-Benz AG board of 
directors, said that European companies are willing to make 
their contribution to ensuring peace in the Middle East. Peace 
will last only if there is economic and social stability in the 
entire region. "In the long run political peace can be achieved 
and safeguarded only through strong and resistant economic 
networks," Reuter said. It is to be hoped that in the Middle 
East there will soon be peaceful coexistence, which includes the 
Palestinian's self-determination just as well as Israel's secure 
existence. The Daimler-Benz chief paid tribute to the PLO 
chairman's credit in unerringly working toward giving peace 
concrete shape, "against all resistance and despite all 
setbacks, confronted by intrigues, violence, and terror." 
Reuter promised 'Arafat a development study drawn up by the 
corporations' subsidiary Dornier Management Consulting. The 
study is to show how transportation and traffic systems can be 
expanded across borders. It is also to continue information 
about how border-crossing cooperation can be implemented in the 
field of water supplies and telecommunication. Daimler-Benz 
also wants to train Palestinian managers and craftsmen. 'Arafat 
was particularly enthusiastic about Reuter's promise that the 
corporation will finance the construction and operation of a 
kindergarten for small Palestinian children in need. "We do not 
want to talk about gigantomaniac projects," Reuter said, after 
he had received his guest at Echterdingen airport, "but about 
individual steps that provide progress to the people in the 
Middle East." 
  Talks with Israeli Prime Minister Rabin and Foreign Minister 
Peres in Israel in September 1992 obviously encouraged Reuter's 
intention to invite 'Arafat to Stuttgart. Reuter expressed what 
the corporation hopes to achieve by that as follows: "We do not 
want to wait passively for the peace process in the Middle East, 
but we want to play an active role in it." In addition, the 
corporation wants to open up market opportunities in the Middle 
East for itself -- in an area, whose number of inhabitants will 
rise from the current 103 million to 125 million within a few 
years. In the conversation with 'Arafat, Reuter said that the 
Middle East needs political and economic managers so that one of 
the world's most attractive economic regions can be established 
there. 
  This February Daimler-Benz opened a corporation 
representation in Jerusalem and Cairo. Reuter announced that 
the company wants to develop a constructive network of business 
relations in the Middle East. Some of the things that are 
produced by the four company sectors of Daimler-Benz, was shown 
to 'Arafat in the yard of the corporation headquarters in 
Stuttgart-Moehringen: passenger cars, industrial vehicles, 
Airbus planes, helicopters, and microelectronic parts, as well 
as a model of the ICE [Intercity Express] high-speed train. 
  The corporation coordinated the PLO chairman's visit with 
the 
Chancellor's Office in Bonn as well as with Foreign Minister 
Kinkel and FRG Economics Minister Rexrodt. The meeting in 
Stuttgart was preceded by German managers' contacts with 
politicians and companies in Israel, Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan, and 
Syria. The company has Social Democratic Party [SDP] politician 
Wischnewski ("Ben Wisch") as Middle East adviser, who was also 
present in Stuttgart on Monday. 'Arafat was accompanied by Mr. 
Qaddumi, the PLO's expert for foreign policy and economy, 
Executive Committee Member Nashashibi, and PLO representative to 
Bonn Franji. A luncheon in the Baden-Wuerttemberg capital was 
also attended by Minister-President Teufel and Mayor Rommel. In 
the evening Teufel hosted a reception for 'Arafat in the New 
Palace in Stuttgart, the former residence of the Wuerttemberg 
kings. 
  The unusual event of an economic corporation inviting the 
PLO 
chief and thus stepping on foreign policy territory was 
commented by Daimler-Benz general manager Kleiner by saying: 
"We want creative togetherness of politics and economy while 
not calling the primacy of politics into question." 
  'Arafat expressed confidence about the signing of the 
autonomy agreement for Gaza and Jericho. Even though 
difficulties still have to be overcome, "where there is a will 
there is a way." The PLO chairman described his role in the 
negotiations as follows: "It takes two to tango." He cannot 
yet give the date when he will return to Jerusalem, Jericho, or 
Gaza. This depends on when the Israelis will withdraw.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Foreign Minister Warns of New Enemy </F>
Image"] 
  [Text] Mannheim, 3 May -- Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel 
and his Dutch counterpart Pieter Kooijmanns have warned against 
building up the image of Islam as the new enemy in Europe after 
the end of the East-West antagonism. At the first 
German-Netherlands ambassadors' conference in Mannheim on 
Tuesday [3 May], the two officials came out in favor of 
conducting a frank and critical dialogue with the Islamic states 
and promoting mutual understanding by getting to know one 
another better. 
  The German and Netherlands ambassadors to Algeria, Egypt, 
Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Turkey participated in the conference. 
The exchange of opinions focused on questions of stability in 
the southern Mediterranean region and in the Middle East. 
  Kooijmans said that Islam was in many cases equated with 
extremism and fundamentalism. While extremism was dangerous, it 
was not immediately connected with Islam. There were fanatics 
in other religions too, Kooijmans stated, adding that the 
Europeans should not be guided by fear of the Islamic world.

  [Text] The United States regards the planned deployment of 
crisis reaction forces made up of Bundeswehr soldiers and 
voluntary conscripts as a strengthening of Germany's ability to 
act. This was stated by German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe 
following talks with his U.S. counterpart William Perry. 
  The German defense minister has attributed to the United 
States and Germany a decisive role in bringing about more stable 
international relations. The Americans have expressed 
understanding for Germany's plans to reduce the Bundeswehr to 
300,000 men, Ruehe said. Apart from Germany's armed forces 
reform plans, the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and relations 
with Russia were also discussed in the talks. 
  Ruehe will continue his U.S visit with a speech at the West 
Point Military Academy and a troop inspection at Fort Bragg.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "MiG To Pay Debts in Bonn"] </F>
  [Text] Russia wants to sell 200 combat planes of the 
MiG-29 type (NATO code "Fulcrum") to the Defense Ministry at a 
unit price of only 20 million marks [DM], including spare parts. 
FOCUS learned this from Manfred Opel, defense policy expert of 
the Social Democratic Party of Germany Bundestag group. 
  The price demanded for these planes could be deducted by 
Bonn 
from Moscow's considerable debt account, the former general 
says. Opel: "Otherwise we will never get the money back we lent 
them!" 
  The offer by Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev was 
received by the Finance Ministry two weeks ago and is currently 
being examined as to its profitability. 
  If the deal goes through, the Bundeswehr, which is being 
torpedoed by Theo Waigel's red pen, will fly with a total of 224 
"Fulcrum" planes. At the moment, 24 planes of this type -- 20 
combat jets and four training planes -- out of the legacy of 
Honecker's National People's Army are being used. 
  The further use of the second-hand jets from the East is 
sensible in the view of Opel and other security policy experts: 
"The extremely efficient MiG-29 can be used -- even though only 
as a transition solution -- as a substitute for the F-4F Phantom 
interceptor." The U.S. oldie will be finally taken out of 
service in 2002 despite expensive equipment. And the 
acquisition of its successor, the Eurofighter 2000, is still 
extremely uncertain. 
  Insiders now ask themselves: Will the Russian combat plane, 
which was repeatedly discussed as an alternative to the 
Eurofighter after unification, now be able to win over the often 
disputed high-tech plane of Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa)? 
  After all, the unit price of Eurofighter 2000 is estimated 
at 
more than DM100 million. In addition, there are the costs for 
armament. Given 140 planned combat planes, this is an 
additional blow to the scarce funds of Bonn's national defense 
politicians.

<F P=106> [Article by Federal Labor Minister Norbert Bluem: "A High </F>
Standard of Living Must Be Constantly Safeguarded Through High 
Performance"] 
  [Text] The economy is there for the people, and not vice 
versa. This basic philosophy of the social market economy has 
come under pressure to prove its worth in the course of 
international economic developments. We are able to produce an 
increasing amount of goods, at increasingly cheaper prices, with 
an increasingly smaller work force. And what stands at the end 
of this scenario: one part of the work force doing highly 
qualified jobs, one part working but nevertheless poor, and the 
rest without work but "provided for?" 
  In this situation it deserves our respect that U.S. 
President 
Clinton asked the economics, finance, and also the labor 
ministers of the seven major industrial nations to gather into 
"conclave" to discuss a single issue: Jobs. For once, far away 
from the traditional ritual of world economic summits, where 
participants only discuss interests, inflation rates, monetary 
relations, budget and balance of payments deficits. These are 
undoubtedly decisive macroeconomic parameters on which 
investments and economic growth depend not only at the national 
but the international level. 
  Yet with any investment and growth one must also ask 
whether, 
and what kind of, jobs will be created. Employment provides 
possibilities for life, guarantees participation in the social 
processes, creates personal and social security, and allows 
people to show solidarity for others. New technologies, new 
structures, new demands for qualification -- all this is seen 
not as progress but as threat, unless they provide the ground 
for new jobs. 
<H5>  Germany Comes Second in Unemployment Rate Statistics </H5>
  The situation in the industrialized nations is serious. As a 
result of the international recession, unemployment has reached 
terrifying dimensions. Nobody would challenge the total that 
was presented at the opening of the G-7 Jobs Conference in 
Detroit. Yet, as far as the question "What must be done?" is 
concerned, the German delegation did not come empty-handed. 
After all, we are fighting unemployment with enormous political 
and financial expense. And by international standards, our 
situation is not quite as bad as the self-torturing debates on 
Germany as an investment center would have us believe. 
  Here are two facts in this connection: 
  1. Regarding the unemployment rate, Germany comes in 
excellent second place -- behind Japan, but still ahead of the 
United States, which had often been presented as "employment 
wonderland." 
  2. Germany's fine position as far as unemployment among 
young people is concerned is particularly noteworthy -- 
particularly thanks to our excellent system of apprentice 
training, where modern theory and practical work in the 
enterprises guided by the market have established a constructive 
symbiosis. 
  The condition for overcoming the employment crisis is that 
people go along with it. People must not feel that progress and 
change are a threat but rather a positive challenge. However, 
to be able to come to that, man has to be given the means to 
hold his own in the process of technological-structural changes 
and take an active share in these changes. And, if at one point 
he is unable to do so, if he loses his job, he must be protected 
against social decline. 
<H5>  Social Partnership Is an Important Advantage for Germany </H5>
  Labor market policy, as we have developed it here in 
Germany, 
fulfills both of these tasks. It allows for and maintains 
people's ability to overcome the changes -- among other things 
through information, consultation, training, and mainly through 
professional qualification. Labor market policy is therefore a 
bridge between the economic and social spheres, an indispensable 
addition to economic and financial policy. 
  Our labor administration technique, which combines singly 
handly both areas of labor market policy, namely the active 
shaping of labor promotion and social unemployment benefits and 
is financed through the contribution payments of employers and 
employees, met with great interest. Self-administration, which 
is based on the technique, is an expression of the comprehensive 
effort of the social partnership to be the decisive element of 
our social and societal structures. This is strengthening social 
peace, and for other countries [this represents] a German 
advantage as economic center that must not be underestimated. 
  The great efforts of social partners at the enterprise, 
industry, and labor levels, under the current critical situation 
in which we have to protect jobs, initiate the necessary 
revisions of our policy, and set the course for higher 
competitive strength and economic growth, have been noted with 
interest. Our mature and time-tested culture of social 
partnership is also an advantage for Germany as an industrial 
center! 
  Including employers and trade unions in the implementation 
of 
labor market policy strengthens the attempt to reach joint 
solutions. Thus, we also achieve a sensible balance between the 
two sides of labor market policy, the economic and the social 
sphere. 
  In some countries, however, forces are gaining the upper 
hand 
that are trying to get the job crisis under control through 
radical cuts in social security, the underlying idea being: cut 
costs, cut prices, create more jobs. 
  Examples for this can be found in the United States. Many 
new jobs have been created there over the past 20 years. The 
percentage of gainfully employed people greatly increased, and 
it has been possible to tackle the employment problem better 
then elsewhere. However -- as President Clinton frankly and 
self-critically admitted in his opening address -- the 
employment problem has been exchanged for an income problem. 
The average workweek for American employees is longer today, 
yet Americans do not earn more than they did 20 years ago. Many 
of them belong to the so-called working poor. These are people 
who, despite the fact that they have a job, are unable to 
sufficiently provide for themselves and their families. This 
kind of job creation cannot be a sensible objective. Why should 
somebody work if he remains dependent on the state at the same 
time? A gap must remain between work and poverty. 
  It was mainly this understanding that made President 
Clinton take the initiative for the Detroit Jobs Conference. 
Experiences were to be exchanged on an alternative to the 
"working poor" employment model. 
  Germany was able to point to good experiences and results. 
Due to the Federal Government's policy, some 3.3 million new 
jobs were created by 1992 in the old laender, most of them good, 
self-sustaining jobs with good pay and a clear distance from the 
poverty line. Yet, sufficiently high wages are possible in the 
long run only with adequate productivity, which is mainly 
dependent on innovative products and procedures and the quality 
of work. Here we are now reaping the fruits of decades of 
efforts in vocational training and adapting the qualifications 
of our gainfully employed to the challenges of 
technological-structural change. All that has been 
well-recognized by our friends and partners. 
  Yet, because of it, we cannot and will not mount the high 
horse. High incomes and high quality social security systems are 
the result of a healthy economy. In a world economy based on 
the division of labor, an internationally outstanding standard 
of living must be won and safeguarded again and again through 
excellent performance. Worldwide changes in international 
economic relations will lead to a new positioning of individual 
economic areas. Only those who react adequately will be able to 
maintain or improve their current standards. It is here, in the 
flexible adaptation to new constellations, that Germany seems to 
be experiencing a certain weakness right now. 
  One term that came up again and again in the discussions in 
Detroit was "information superhighways." This new system of 
information transfer will change the world. Just as with any 
normal transport route it will engender development and 
exclusion. Those who do not keep up will stay behind. If 
prosperity and jobs are important, then we must not retire to 
Podunk. 
  In Germany we will have to try as hard as we can to maintain 
our scientific-technological competence, which has secured for 
us excellence in the sphere of production, and use it to build 
up and further develop a modern service sector. This is 
certainly one area where we must catch up with the others. 
<H5>  No Single Recipe But No Isolation Either </H5>
  And we will have to make working hours more flexible, not 
only for the better coordination of production and sales or for 
better utilization of available machinery. It is also a 
question of working hours that allows for better coordination of 
the job with other vital individual needs. Considering the many 
people who are condemned to idleness it is narrow-minded and, at 
the same time, we continue to force millions of employees to 
work more than they actually want to or can. The age at which 
elderly colleagues have been asked by managements to retire 
prematurely is also inhuman, and these age levels are being 
continually forced down. When I presented my German view of 
this unfair development in Detroit, the other ministers agreed 
immediately. In virtually all industrialized nations the 
mentality of writing off elderly employees has begun to prevail, 
one which eliminates experience and other qualities from the 
economic process. The developments of the past 20 years have led 
us into a dead-end street from which we must quickly find a way 
out. 
  All in all, Detroit was the successful attempt to emphasize 
to the international public that employment is the main target 
of all spheres of policy related to the economy. Still, 
considering all the international interrelations and 
interdependencies, one thing was clear: The basic situation and 
the economic and social framework conditions are so different 
from one country to the next that single and patent solutions 
are not possible and would not be helpful. 
  Nevertheless, in view of the miserable international job 
situation, the path of national-egotistical isolation has to be 
ruled out. This was the unanimous opinion voiced by all 
participants. No country will be able in the long run to secure 
prosperity and employment unless it is included in the 
international division of labor and unless there is global 
growth. 
  Employment is a result of the efforts of all parties 
involved 
in economic activities, not least the business community. It 
was this community that American Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich 
warned before the opening of the conference to cease their 
frenzy for lean companies and dismissing people. The 
businessman will not be judged by the extent to which he reduces 
the work force but by what he does with the "capital" of the 
work force. Bake instead of slaughter! This was Reich's motto. 
This appeal should reach across the Atlantic.

<F P=106> ["enn"-signed report: "Sale of Eko Stahl to Riva Still </F>
Uncertain"] 
  [Text] Berlin, 2 May -- The sale of eastern Germany's 
largest steel manufacturer, Eko Stahl AG in Eisenhuettenstadt, 
to Italy's Riva concern is still uncertain. Originally, the 
privatization was to have been carried out on 1 May (as reported 
in the FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE of 30 April). On Monday [2 May], 
however, representatives of Riva and functionaries from the IG 
Metall union held negotiations on the conditions in line with 
which the privatization would be carried out. There is still 
disagreement over the appointment of an eleventh, neutral member 
to the new supervisory board as well as over the way in which 
personnel would be reduced. So far, no information has been 
made available on the results of talks in Potsdam. The Eko 
Stahl AG cannot be turned into a limited liability company until 
a new supervisory board is named. This conversion is a condition 
for the sale to Riva. 
  In January and March, the IG Metall union and Riva reached 
agreement on "personnel" and "participation in decisionmaking," 
and those points must now be given concrete form. Of the 3,300 
Eko employees, 1,700 are to remain after 1996. According to the 
agreement with IG Metall, Riva is to provide financial support 
for a reduction in personnel. However, the two parties have not 
reached agreement on job guarantees, as Riva reportedly wants to 
include Eko subsidiaries. 
  Concern boss Emilio Riva and Economics Minister Guenther 
Rexrodt (Free Democratic Party) met during the weekend. During 
their conversation, Riva is said to have complained about the 
"hostile atmosphere" at Eisenhuettenstadt, which has meant that 
problems connected with privatization there are much greater 
than in the case of the Hennigsdorf steel works. Rexrodt and 
the Trust Agency have repeatedly appealed to the parties 
involved not to endanger privatization, because that would place 
the future existence of Eisenhuettenstadt as a steelmaking 
center at risk. The Trust Agency has not called into question 
the sale to Riva, although the Italians have still not submitted 
the consolidated balance sheet for the concern that the Trust 
Agency has requested. That should in fact have been done by the 
end of April. 
  Rexrodt said that a heavy responsibility lay with those on 
company boards -- the Eko board of directors and administrative 
board -- who are continuing to pursue their private or 
ideological hobbyhorses. Eko will neither find another investor 
nor will it receive further assistance from the EU. It is being 
said that the Trust Agency has in the meantime checked whether 
the Eko board of directors and supervisory board can be sacked. 
However, not only the industry's right to participate in 
decisionmaking, but personal contacts, too, are making it 
difficult for the Trust Agency to act. The chairman of the Eko 
supervisory board is Hamburg accountant Otto Gellert, who has 
never made a secret of his aversion to Riva and is also deputy 
chairman of the Trust Agency administrative board.

<F P=106> ["R.O"-signed report: "Submarine Deal With Taiwan To Be </F>
Taken Before the Security Council Again?"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- The German shipyards that were interested 
in participating in the construction of 10 submarines for Taiwan 
want to go ahead with the project. 
  The shipyards do not want to accept the sweeping rejection 
by 
the Federal Government. According to information received by 
WELT AM SONNTAG, they want to take the weapons deal once more to 
the Security Council of the government if a cooperation 
agreement with U.S. companies should be concluded. 
  Currently, a group of German companies 
(Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft, Thyssen-Nordseewerke, and 
Ferrostahl) are holding talks with a U.S. shipyard consortium on 
the construction of small submarines for Taiwan. 
  The Germans are to supply the body, and the Americans will 
equip the ships. A total of 10 ships worth a billion German 
marks each are involved. No decision has been made. 
  If a cooperation should come about, the government in 
Washington would approach the German Government concerning the 
wish for cooperation, the companies involved hope. On this 
basis, the Security Council would have to make a new decision. 
The supporters of this deal hope that it would be difficult for 
the Federal Government to reject the U.S. wish because this 
would have a negative impact on Germany's reliability as a 
cooperation partner in international weapons deals. 
  The Security Council banned the delivery of submarines to 
Taiwan in 1993 out of consideration for communist China. Since 
then, the German group has been trying to obtain a participation 
in the construction of submarines abroad. Foreign Minister 
Klaus Kinkel (Free Democratic Party of Germany) stated last week 
that German submarines will not be supplied to Taiwan by a 
roundabout way. 
  The companies did not want to accept that. "The decision of 
the Security Council only applied to direct supplies to Taiwan," 
a spokesman of the shipyards told WELT AM SONNTAG. The 
consortium is being supported by a group of about 150 officials 
from the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] and Free Democratic 
Party of Germany in Bonn who also supported the direct deal with 
Taiwan. The decision of the Security Council does not apply to 
supplies for companies in NATO countries, CDU official Guenter 
Klein from Bremen told WELT AM SONNTAG. 
  According to Klein, the cooperation would be covered by the 
existing principles of the Federal Government for the export of 
military equipment, adopted in 1982. They contain the following 
regulation: "As far as cooperation between weapons companies in 
different NATO countries that are not the subject of government 
agreements is concerned, supplies for these countries are, 
basically, not subject to any restriction -- in accordance with 
the regulations on direct supplies." However, the government 
reserves the right to influence exports.

<F P=106> [Speech by Chancellor Helmut Kohl at a reception for German </F>
soldiers who took part in UN peace and humanitarian missions, in 
Bonn on 18 April: "Germany's Responsibility in a Changed World"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Ladies and Gentlemen, these 
days, we are once again dramatically experiencing what most of 
us still considered impossible a few years ago -- that war and 
barbarism have made a comeback in Europe. No one should think 
that the evil ghosts of the past are at home only in the 
Balkans, and that racial and religious hatred and ethnic 
expulsion can only happen there. 
  Despite all our problems and worries, such as the attainment 
of internal unity, the combating of the recession and 
unemployment, and the creation of new jobs, the safeguarding of 
peace and liberty now and in the coming years remains the 
decisive goal of German politics. Internal peace is only 
possible when external peace is guaranteed. Our German 
experience this century includes a recognition of the fact that 
we need partners and friends. 
  Our security and negotiating ability in foreign policy 
matters is geared to the fact that we are reliable partners and 
that our allies trust us. After all, our allies stood by us in 
the past, and continue to do so. When it comes to peace and 
freedom in Europe and the world, Germany must not stand on the 
sidelines. We must share the responsibility at the side of our 
friends and partners. 
  The Bundeswehr's involvement in measures to safeguard world 
peace within the framework of the community of nations is not 
only a central issue of German foreign and security policy, but 
also a question of German honor and identity. You soldiers of 
the Bundeswehr are entitled to have a clear definition of 
conditions so that you may agree to and fulfill your duties 
without any ifs or buts. 
  Just as our country is growing accustomed to its new 
international responsibility, so too is the image of the 
soldier's profession undergoing a transformation. The challenge 
concerns all of you, and with your involvement in UN operations 
you have furnished the first examples of this responsibility. 
In the future, the Bundeswehr's tasks will include not just the 
defense of the country and the alliance, but also the 
containment of crises and conflicts. 
  The soldierly profession is one of the few professions that 
call for an existential commitment in every sense of the term, 
in other words a readiness to lay down one's life. This can 
also happen in peacetime if you experience a serious situation 
in a crisis area beyond our borders. This provides us, 
especially the politicians, with great responsibility. As 
chancellor, I am fully aware of this responsibility every time I 
reach a decision regarding the deployment of our soldiers. 
  A readiness to assume duties and participate in service for 
the common good has shrunk alarmingly in our society. We are 
living at a time when ruthless egoism is often hailed as 
"self-fulfillment." To safeguard our future, and it is not 
old-fashioned to say this, we must resort to the values that 
guaranteed Germany a future in difficult times -- courage and 
reliability, self- responsibility and efficiency, a readiness to 
help, and consideration for others. 
  With your service, soldiers of the Bundeswehr, you occupy a 
central position in our society. You are accorded our 
recognition, and have every reason to be proud of your services. 
I wish as many people as possible in all sectors of society -- 
in politics, in the parties, in industry, and in the trade 
unions -- would follow your example. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, Israel's Amos Oz, peace prize winner 
of 
the German publishing trade, said in St. Paul's Church in 
Frankfurt in 1992: "Twice in my life have I seen the horrible 
countenance of war. But still I am convinced that one can never 
abolish aggression by succumbing to it." 
  Therefore we need your service in the Bundeswehr to permit 
future generations a life of peace, freedom, and prosperity. I 
ask each of you, also on a personal level, to take part in this 
great future task. I thank you all for your service, and ask 
you to convey my thanks to your comrades.

<F P=106> [Michael J. Inacker report: "The Inspector General Calms </F>
the Troops"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- In spite of the suspension of the plan to 
reduce the armed forces and compulsory military service, the 
Bundeswehr leadership expects considerable changes within the 
Bundeswehr by spring 1995. 
  A coalition round stopped the "conceptional guidelines" by 
Defense Minister Volker Ruehe (Christian Democratic Union) as 
recently as last week, according to which the strength of the 
Bundeswehr was to have been reduced from 370,000 to 340,000 or 
320,000 men, and the length of compulsory military service from 
12 to 10 months. This was the Defense Ministry's response to 
the drastic cuts in the defense budget, and it wanted to raise 
money for an increase in investments. Also, the fact was to be 
taken into consideration that about 40,000 recruits would be 
missing in the second half of the 1990s to preserve a strength 
of 370,000 men. 
  According to information received by WELT AM SONNTAG, the 
inspector general of the Bundeswehr, General Klaus Naumann, 
prepared the armed forces in an "internal troop information" for 
the fact that there will be no restructuring in the election 
year 1994, but that fundamental changes are to be expected in 
1995. With the telex that was sent to the troops on 21/22 
April, the inspector general wanted to eliminate the unease 
among the troops that was caused by the public debate. 
  The telex states that a political consensus and a 
corresponding "planning order" for the restructuring of the 
Bundeswehr are to be expected by the summer. 
  Moreover, the general hinted that it might be possible to 
reduce the armed forces "to a limited extent," while at the same 
ensuring an increase to the original extent. Compulsory 
military service "might" also be reduced, Naumann announced, 
without mentioning details. 
  However, a "decision on the implementation" of the plans in 
the Bundeswehr is not to be expected "before spring 1995," the 
general told his troops. 
  Thus, Germany's young men are facing changes. If the 
Ministry's plans should be implemented, the young men will be 
able to organize their military service in a more flexible way 
than in the past: 

  -  If they join the "main defense forces," 
they will do a "condensed" military service of 10 months, but 
not be trained for full serviceability. 
  -  If they want to join the 
crisis-reaction forces, they can chose between a 12-month active 
service or service as "soldiers who sign up for a certain number 
of months" (SaM), with the option of between 15 and 18 
months. 
  -  In addition, the conscripts can sign up for a certain 
number of years (SaZ) -- between two and 12 years. 
  As early as the second half of 1994, some of the conscripts 
that are found unfit are likely to be called up for service, 
too. Changed fitness criteria should reduce the annual average 
number of 80,000 young men that are unfit for military service 
by up to 30,000. Whether they will actually join the 
Bundeswehr, whether they will refuse to do military service, or 
whether they will make use of other alternatives is unclear. 
Initial calculations at the Defense Ministry proceed from a 
number of at most 10,000 additional recruits with a 
"serviceability related to a certain activity." 
  Whereas the duration of the military service is to remain 
unchanged, there will be certain exceptions regarding the 
training of those who are only fit to a limited extent, which, 
however, will not make the training of the "healthy" conscripts 
easier. WELT AM SONNTAG learned that the Bundeswehr has 
prepared a total of 4,000 positions (primarily positions on the 
staffs) for those who are only fit to a limited extent. 
  Because of the drastic increase in the number of young men 
refusing to do military service, the discrimination against 
soldiers as compared with conscientious objectors is to be 
reduced. After the defense commissioner noted a growing 
inequality between those doing military service and those opting 
for alternative national service in his most recent report, the 
Federal Government is to draw up a report on the actual 
situation. Investigations by WELT AM SONNTAG revealed that, in 
some cases, graduated doctors fulfill part of their hospital 
training during their alternative national service. 
  In an interview with WELT AM SONNTAG, the defense spokesman 
of the Bundestag group of the Christian Democratic 
Union/Christian Social Union, Paul Breuer, suggested increasing 
the value of military service vis-a-vis the national alternative 
service. Breuer stated: "Only the young men who have done 12 
months of basic military service must be prepared to defend the 
peace and the freedom of our people with their own lives." 
Thus, "no service in peacetime, however moral and noble it may 
be," can compare in any way to "risking one's life." 
  Breuer complained that, in its current form, the 
alternative national service is no longer the "cumbersome 
alternative" that it should be according to a ruling by the 
Constitutional Court. Improved material incentives, the 
possibility to choose the place and type of work, that fact that 
the young men do not have to spend the night in barracks, but 
can stay with their families and girl-friends have improved the 
"quality of the alternative national service at the expense of 
military service" in the eyes of the young men. 
  Breuer pointed out that the high reputation of those who are 
doing alternative national service mainly stems from the idea 
that they are taking care of extremely handicapped persons. The 
truth, however, is "that only 4 percent of all those doing 
alternative service are active in this sphere -- which is 
approximately 4,000 of a total of 100,000 young men doing 
alternative service." 
  Thus, those "who do not want to adapt the duration of the 
alternative national service to that of the basic military 
service and who do not want to clearly tighten the permit 
procedures are not acting on the basis of the constitution," 
Breuer stated with a view to SPD [Social Democratic Party of 
Germany] calls for a reduction of the alternative national 
service.

<F P=106> [Eugen Georg Schwartz report: "Current Coalition Hardly </F>
Stands a Chance"] 
  [Text] The FOCUS-sponsored Basis Research Survey in April 
indicated a 1 percentage point increase in the Union's 
popularity, but it also suggested that the Union would lose its 
dominant position. The new chancellor would be Rudolf Scharping. 
  According to the survey, with a projected election turnout 
of 
80 percent and without any overlapping mandates, the SPD [Social 
Democratic Party of Germany] would return 274 deputies to 
parliament, the CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic Union/Christian 
Socialist Union] would return 267, Alliance 90 and Greens would 
return 68 deputies, and the FDP [Free Democratic Party] 47. 
These figures are based on the Hare-Niemeyer system of 
calculating votes, in use since 1987. 
  Thus, with a total of 656 parliamentary seats, there would 
be 
five possible coalitions. But only two of these are really 
likely. One is an SPD-Alliance/Greens coalition with 342 seats, 
and the other a grand coalition with 541 seats. The FDP would 
only stand a chance of entering parliament as part of a 
"red-yellow-green" coalition, but in such a case its capacity 
would be limited. 
  If the PDS [Party of Democratic Socialism], derived from the 
Socialist Unity Party of Germany, were to win three election 
districts, for example Berlin and Brandenburg, it would win 28 
parliamentary seats, because in this case its 4 percent total of 
votes would not fall beneath the 5-percent threshold. In this 
case, the number of SPD seats would fall to 262, the number of 
Union seats to 255, the number of Alliance 90/Green seats to 66, 
and the number of FDP seats to 45. 
  The consequence: The SPD and Greens, with a total of 328 
seats, would be only one seat short of a parliamentary majority. 
Or, to put it another way, if the PDS wins seats in the next 
Bundestag, a grand coalition would be virtually inevitable, 
according to the results of surveys so far. 
  The survival of the present Union/FDP coalition into the 
next 
Bundestag is becoming increasingly improbable. Although a 
neck-and-neck race between the SPD and CDU/CSU seems possible on 
16 October, the FDP is becoming Kohl's "security risk" to an 
increasing extent. The survey suggests that the FDP would only 
receive 6.5 percent of the vote. Never have the Free Democrats 
been so far away from a double-digit result. 
  In answer to the question "If you could decide who is to 
rule 
after 16 October, who would you choose?" only 5 percent of 
respondents said CDU/CSU/FDP (6 percent had said so in March), 
but 16 percent said SPD/Greens, and 13 percent said CDU/CSU/SPD 
(13 percent had said so in March). 
  Twenty percent of the respondents would like a CDU-led 
coalition, 35 percent would like an SPD-led coalition, and 26 
percent would like a coalition that includes the Christian and 
Social Democrats. 
  The number of people preferring a sole SPD government has 
again fallen from 17 percent in January to 14 percent in April. 
On the other hand, the number of those preferring a Union 
government has risen from 10 percent in January to 12 percent in 
April. 
  What is noticeable is that although the Union has won a 
percentage point in popularity, the observed upward trend in 
Helmut Kohl's support has not continued. The chancellor has 
lost 3 percentage points in the popularity ratings (now 29 
percent), and Scharping has gained 3 points (now 47 percent). 
  It is of no use to Kohl that more people were optimistic 
about the economy in April. In one year, i.e. six months after 
the Bundestag elections, 46 percent of Germans expect a better 
economic situation than today.

<F P=106> [Report signed "C.G.": "Kinkel: Marching Separately, </F>
Attacking Together; FDP Executive Committee Approves Coalition 
Statement"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 2 May -- On Monday [2 May] in Bonn the Free 
Democratic Party [FDP] Federal Executive Committee confirmed the 
party Presidium's 11 April decision to recommend continuing the 
coalition with the Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian 
Social Union [CSU] after the Bundestag election in October to 
the party congress, which will be held in Rostock at the 
beginning of June. There were no votes against and four 
abstentions. FDP Chairman Kinkel came out in favor of 
reexamining the solidarity surcharge after three years with the 
goal of abolishing it, but he added: "At the moment the FDP is 
not imposing any conditions for continuing the coalition." The 
FDP has ideas and goals. However, one cannot divide the skin of 
the bear before the bear has been shot and say that a coalition 
is possible only if certain conditions are met. 
  Kinkel told the Executive Committee that over the past two 
weeks he had gained the impression at the laender party 
congresses that there was relief everywhere "that the 
clarification of the coalition statement has strengthened the 
FDP's ability to act on key issues." For the FDP the prospects 
for the success of the coalition in October have improved: "Now 
the CDU/CSU also has to do its part." 
  Kinkel announced that the FDP will campaign on its own, 
adopting the slogan "marching separately, attacking together." 
The election program, which was discussed by the Executive 
Committee on Monday in preparation for the paper to be adopted 
at the Rostock congress, will "clearly demonstrate the FDP's 
autonomy" with a list of demands. The FDP's "function argument" 
has again gained in importance. Kinkel said: "Anyone who wants 
to prevent a red-green or a grand coalition must vote for the 
FDP." A red-green coalition in Bonn would lead to a crisis of 
trust in foreign policy and to a "disaster for jobs." Kinkel 
warned against a grand coalition of the CDU/CSU with the Social 
Democratic Party [SPD], calling it "autocratic rule by two." By 
continuing the current coalition, on the other hand, internal 
unification can be completed and Germany's role in the world can 
be made active. 
  Kinkel said that all "speculation" about the FDP's behavior 
in the presidential election is currently moot. The FDP 
supports its candidate Hamm-Bruecher. After every ballot the 
FDP group in the Federal Convention, which is to be held on Whit 
Monday, will discuss its further course of action: "There will 
be no anticipatory decisions." However, it is already clear: 
"The FDP will be a decisive element." North Rhine-Westphalian 
Land Chairman Moellemann said that the party chairman has the 
right to make his own proposals. If the proposal says that one 
should also vote for Mrs. Hamm-Bruecher in the third ballot, no 
one will contradict him. "However, if the proposal is Herzog, 
there will be a counterproposal: Then the FDP group must vote 
on it." Moellemann repeated that his "preference" is SPD 
candidate Rau. 
  Kinkel reproached the SPD: "Scharping's popularity in the 
SPD will continue to decline." With the party's "failed tax 
plans," Scharping made a crucial mistake. The SPD wants to 
raise property and inheritance tax, raise the standard value of 
houses and apartments, and burden qualified secretaries and 
skilled workers with the supplementary tax. Kinkel said: "A 
vote for the SPD is a costly one." The FDP rejects a general 
speed limit, advocates computer-controlled traffic guidance 
systems, and wants to maintain for citizens with the pleasure of 
driving on the few kilometers of highway that are not yet 
subject to a speed limit. Mr. Zoepel's withdrawal from 
Scharping's team reflects rising dissatisfaction with 
Scharping's "attempt to tiptoe to power without giving offense 
to anyone." Instead, "Scharping should have the courage to put 
the SPD's policy openly and honestly up for a vote." 
  In the Executive Committee FDP Bundestag Caucus Chairman 
Solms denied reports that he doubted that Justice Minister 
Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger would be nominated as minister again 
after the Bundestag elections. Kinkel said: "The justice 
minister is doing good work, which meets with widespread 
appreciation; I support her without any ifs or buts." 
Moellemann used a newspaper report about alleged critical 
statements by Solms about the justice minister as an opportunity 
to reproach the caucus chairman: "It is unacceptable that 
ministers or other leading functionaries are simply released for 
the kill." If Solms had wanted to avoid the impression that he 
opposes Mrs. Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, he should have done 
that at the appropriate time "as a professional." Moellemann 
then annoyed Solms with the question: "What would happen if 
someone asked who the next caucus chairman is supposed to be?" 
Then there would be general uncertainty. Moellemann said: "We 
must support all ministers, chairmen, etc." 
  In the Executive Committee Moellemann, Saarland Chairman 
Cronauer, North Rhine-Westphalia Chairman Rohde, and domestic 
policy expert Baum abstained from the vote. They did not 
contradict the "contents" of the coalition statement, but they 
considered the date of its issuance to be wrong. There was 
almost unanimous approval in the debate, but some Executive 
Committee members -- in particular from eastern Germany -- 
demanded that the coalition statement now be supplemented with 
"details of contents." The FDP must not just say that it wants 
to get together with certain partners but also why it considers 
this appropriate. Kinkel responded that the FDP will answer 
these questions with its election program. Moellemann 
criticized the fact that the Executive Committee, which is the 
responsible body, is dealing with the coalition statement only 
two weeks after the Presidium made its decision. 
  Because of the letter with which Solms rejected 
Moellemann's criticism of the coalition statement and accused 
him of attempting to build a "counterstrategy," and as a 
response to Kinkel's statements at the land party congress of 
the North Rhine-Westphalian FDP in Dortmund a week ago, 
Moellemann complained about "the unprecedented reprimand of a 
land chairman by the Bundestag group chairman and the party 
chairman." However, there is no point in continuing the 
quarrel. Logic dictates that the Bonn coalition should be 
continued because it has held up until now and it is not 
expected to fall apart before the elections. However, the 
"function of the coalition statement" must be clarified with a 
description of priority goals "in essential fields." 
  Some younger Executive Committee members demanded that the 
FDP avoid tying itself down by "setting down specific topics," 
which Moellemann wanted to be understood as prerequisites. The 
path toward a social-liberal coalition must not be completely 
blocked, since the other parties reserve for themselves various 
postelection options. FDP Honorary Chairman Genscher left the 
Executive Committee Meeting during Kinkel's opening statement 
and before the debate. The Executive Committee received 
Moellemann's attacks against Solms and Kinkel without a 
response. It is said that the party leadership received 
widespread support in the Executive Committee.

<F P=106> [Report by Charima Reinhardt: "FDP Leadership Shifting </F>
Toward Herzog"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 3 May -- Parts of the Free Democratic Party 
of Germany [FDP] leadership are obviously trying to make sure 
that the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] candidate for the 
Federal presidency, Roman Herzog, gets a clear lead over the 
other contenders even on the first ballot. 
  As FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU learned from the FDP leadership in 
Bonn on Tuesday [3 May], a victory for Herzog should be obvious 
from the very beginning to prevent the FDP votes from splitting 
up in the following two ballots. It was said that unless there 
is a convincing majority for the CDU candidate in the first 
ballot, there is the danger of parts of the 111 FDP electors 
supporting Herzog in the second and third ballots while others 
would cast their vote for the Social Democratic Party of Germany 
[SPD] candidate, Johannes Rau, and still others for the FDP's 
own candidate, Hildegard Hamm- Bruecher. The result of the 
first ballot is of "extraordinarily great importance" for the 
further behavior in the ballots, one member of the FDP 
leadership said in Bonn. If Herzog's victory were to become 
obvious early on, even such FDP electors would vote for the CDU 
man that would otherwise rather be leaning toward Rau. 
  It was further learned that FDP Chairman Klaus Kinkel and 
Bundestag group leader Hermann Otto Solms want to make sure that 
Herzog gets elected with the help of the FDP because this could 
be interpreted as a sign of the ability to act and the 
solidarity of the Bonn coalition, which consists of the 
CDU/Christian Social Union [CSU] and the FDP. The FDP 
leadership intends to commit the party congress in early June in 
Rostock to the continuation of this coalition after the 16 
October Bundestag election. Solms and Kinkel are the advocates 
of this coalition statement and both are regarded as supporters 
of Herzog. 
  The agreement within the party so far was that first the 
FDP's own candidate, Hamm-Bruecher, should be supported, and 
that the further voting behavior should then be discussed after 
each ballot. According to Kinkel there will not be any 
commitment prior to the ballots. At any rate, by its voting 
behavior, the FDP will take a considerable share in the decision 
as to who will become the successor to Richard von Weizsaecker.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "FDP Is Becoming a Security Risk for </F>
Kohl"] 
  [Text] Lost reputation, the lack of attractiveness, an 
ambiguous profile, weak competition -- this is the increasingly 
blurred image of the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP]. In 
mid-April Basis Research was commissioned by FOCUS to conduct a 
poll of 1,000 western Germans and 500 eastern Germans about 
their opinion on the FDP and its representatives. The results 
are almost devastating. 
  The reputation of the FDP has plummeted together with 
Ministers Klaus Kinkel, Guenter Rexrodt, Sabine 
Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, Karl-Hans Laermann, and Irmgard 
Schwaetzer to unprecedented levels in the party's history. A 
total of 80 percent of those polled are "completely," "largely," 
or "partly" of the view that the FDP is by far not what it used 
to be. 
  Even though the liberals in Kohl's Cabinet are known to most 
people (with the exception of Education Minister Laermann), they 
are not convincing. On an approval scale of -\5 to +\5, the 
1,500 people polled gave only Klaus Kinkel a relatively 
acceptable popularity value with +\1.5. His three colleagues 
(Irmgard Schwaetzer was not included in the poll) had to content 
themselves with +\0.5 to +\0.7. 
  A little better but hardly glorious are the marks for 
material competence. Here the foreign minister receives +\1.9, 
the economics minister +\1.2, and the education minister +\0.9. 
Right at the bottom: the justice minister with +\0.7. 
  Even among those voters who voted for the FDP the 
displeasure 
with the party leadership cannot be ignored. They mainly 
complain that the range of personalities in the FDP has 
deteriorated and that the party lacks politicians such as 
Hans-Dietrich Genscher and Otto Count Lambsdorff. 
  Another result of the FOCUS poll, which was held when the 
FDP 
had not yet made the coalition statement for the benefit of the 
Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union, is also 
sensational: A total of 68 percent of those polled criticized 
the fact that the decision had not yet been made, and 85 percent 
were either completely or partly in favor of the FDP committing 
itself to the same partner at the federal and at the land level. 
  Despite this criticism, which is depressing for the FDP, 
two-thirds of those polled believe that the FDP will enter the 
Bundestag again.

<F P=106> [Interview with Social Democratic Party Chairman Rudolf </F>
Scharping by Olaf Opitz, Ulrich Reitz, and Herbert Weber; place 
and date not given: "Not the Chancellor's Election Club"] 
  [Text] [FOCUS] The Social Democratic Party of Germany 
[SPD] may discuss its government platform until the party 
congress takes place. After that, it must be silent. You have 
changed the party into a chancellor's election club, even though 
you are not yet chancellor. 
  [Scharping] The SPD will always be a party that takes 
pleasure in discussion and is open to reform. It will never be 
a chancellor's election club. But the government program will 
be adopted in June. If anyone then has a different opinion it 
is clear that such an opinion will not be shared by the SPD. It 
is comparable to soccer. In training, a misplaced pass is 
tolerable, but in a match, it may lead to defeat. 
  [FOCUS] You are speaking from experience. The tax debate in 
March was a classical misplaced pass. 
  [Scharping] We must concentrate all our instruments to fight 
unemployment and reach the goal of social justice. We want 
economic recovery, which is why the tax quota will not be 
increased. Kohl and Waigel have imposed unprecedented burdens 
on the citizens. Now everyone knows that the SPD will abolish 
the solidarity surcharge on all incomes, because the Federal 
Government has imposed it on every taxpayer. The SPD wants a 
tax-free subsistence minimum, a considerably improved family 
allowance, and merely a surcharge for less than 20 percent at 
the upper end of the income spiral. The limit will be 120,000 
German marks [DM] for married people and 60,000 for singles. 
This makes more sense economically, because it eases the lower- 
and medium-income groups of tax burdens. Such a measure will 
have a favorable effect on the economic cycle. 
  [FOCUS] Such a measure would hit the elites that you need 
for economic recovery. 
  [Scharping] My understanding of elites has nothing to do 
with incomes or the search for personal advantages. Otherwise, 
you would also have to consider Zwick and Schneider [two corrupt 
entrepreneurs] as forming part of the elite. 
  [FOCUS] You are creating an envy barrier. 
  [Scharping] Do you have any other prejudices in store? 
  [FOCUS] After all, the upper half of the taxpayers finance 
90 percent of the total income tax. 
  [Scharping] That is a misleading figure. 
  [FOCUS] It was calculated by officials in the Federal 
Finance Ministry. 
  [Scharping] It only makes sense to put the tax revenue in 
proportion to the total sum of incomes. 
  [FOCUS] Acrobatics with figures. Every average calculation 
is inaccurate. 
  [Scharping] Now you are criticizing your own questions. 
Under the Bonn coalition, those who pay DM2,000 in taxes will 
in the future have to pay DM2,150. The SPD thinks that it 
should be DM50 more, which would be reasonable for such high 
incomes. 
  [FOCUS] You want the middle class to pay according to the 
motto that those who do not have much should get something from 
those who have a bit more. As usual, it is hard to get at the 
highest income groups. Stars, top sportsmen, serious 
entrepreneurs move to tax oases abroad. Zwick and Schneider 
disappear. Skilled workers and engineers stay and pay. 
  [Scharping] I do not take part in discussions on the 
superrich. Zwick and Schneider are cases for the public 
prosecutor; they can hardly be used as examples in your 
comparison. The SPD wants everyone to help finance German unity 
in accordance with their financial capacity. By the way, this 
is also in line with our constitution. That is the point. The 
situation now is this: Workers and employees, small and 
medium-sized enterprises, and employment-intensive firms have 
had to pay an excessively high share through ancillary wage 
costs. The SPD certainly is not the only one to state that 
higher income earners can make a slightly higher contribution. 
A real upswing requires economic activity at home and companies 
that invest. We want to ease them of some of their burdens. 
People like [Employers' Federation President] Murmann and 
[German Industry Federation President] Tyll Necker share these 
ideas. I do not think we can impute social envy to them. 
  [FOCUS] For how long would the surcharge planned by the SPD 
have to be paid? 
  [Scharping] The SPD does not want to increase the tax quota 
but is seeking just distribution! As a result of the wrong way 
of financing German unity, the Kohl government has accumulated 
an incredible debt mountain. There is still no end in sight to 
the necessary annual transfer of approximately DM16 billion to 
eastern Germany. As long as there is such a high financial 
requirement, no responsible finance politician can abolish such 
a surcharge. To stimulate growth and employment it is much more 
important to lower the ancillary wage costs. With clear 
economic growth, we can reduce the state quota over the medium 
term. 
  [FOCUS] Let us discuss the misplaced passes again. Your 
comrades in Kiel are calling for a speed limit, a property tax, 
an energy tax.... 
  [Scharping] We cannot invite the party members to take part 
in the discussion and then complain about their statements, 
including proposals that do not get a majority. I am opposed to 
symbolism in politics. 
  [FOCUS] Why do you reject a speed limit? 
  [Scharping] There are better ideas than to impose bans. 
Remote data processing would be an idea. We must differentiate 
in terms of traffic and the environment. 
  [FOCUS] There are many road signs imposing bans in 
Rhineland-Palatinate. 
  [Scharping] If you have come by highway A61 you will 
certainly have seen that we are changing this. 
  [FOCUS] No. We think ecologically and have come by train. 
  [Scharping] That is commendable, but you really missed 
something. On that highway you can study the advantages of a 
differentiated approach. We have limited the speed on 
four-track highways, but there is virtually no speed limit on 
six-track highways. Following the introduction of the ban on 
passing for trucks, accidents have drastically decreased. 
  [FOCUS] What are you going to do with the speed limit? Will 
or will it not be introduced? 
  [Scharping] The speed will be limited but in a 
differentiated way. We are seeking European harmonization, 
which must include options allowing us to consider traffic and 
environmental conditions. 
  [FOCUS] Why are you opposed to a general speed limit? 
  [Scharping] We must create a reliable framework for the 
economic sector, including the automobile industry. We want 
environment-considerate growth. In Japan, "ecolution," a 
combination of evolution and ecology, is being pushed. In the 
United States, the state and the automobile sector are jointly 
seeking a "clean car." However, in Germany, we waited very long 
before we introduced the catalytic converter. An ecological car 
is above all a technical challenge. 
  [FOCUS] The banks are an important economic factor. They 
played a disastrous role in the Schneider bankruptcy. How can 
this be prevented in the future? 
  [Scharping] The Schneider bankruptcy is going at the expense 
of many small- and medium-sized enterprises and at the 
taxpayers' expense. The Schneider case has led to an intensive 
debate on the necessary extent of the supervision of banks. 
This issue has for months been intensively discussed in a 
different context between the Bundesbank and commercial banks. 
The banks should do everything to prevent damage to craftsmen 
at their cost. The decision whether every bank should do so 
separately, or whether they should create a common, adequate 
emergency fund, should be left to the banks. In any case, they 
must help the people concerned. After all, the reputation of 
German banks is at stake. 
  [FOCUS] This is only an appeal. Do you also intend to 
regulate it by law? 
  [Scharping] There has been a discussion for years on the 
concentration of economic power with the banks -- and thus also 
on the concentration of risks. However, before we call for laws 
we must know whether current provisions have been violated or 
whether the laws are really inadequate. If there are gaps or 
deficiencies in the current laws, our legislative bodies are 
called upon to act. I think that in such a case, we should do 
what is necessary.

<F P=106> ["deu"-signed report: "SPD Does Not Want To Increase Taxes"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Bonn -- Rudolf Scharping, chairman of the Social 
Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] and candidate for chancellor, 
has confirmed his promise that, as chancellor, he will not 
increase the quota of taxes and surcharges beyond the level 
planned for 1995. "This is a very clear promise," Scharping 
stated in Bonn on Tuesday [3 May] after the session of the SPD 
Party Council, which was harmonious, according to participants 
in the meeting. The body that includes representatives of the 
land and district organizations discussed the draft of the 
government program that was adopted by the SPD Executive 
Committee one week ago with one abstention. Scharping added that 
even unpleasant surprises when counting the cash after a 
changeover of power in Bonn would not change anything. The limit 
of burdens has been reached. Within the existing system, 
however, he considers a number of changes necessary. [passage

<F P=106> [Commentary by Franz Schoenhuber: "The Media and Political </F>
Dogs Are Barking -- The Republikaner Caravan Is Moving On"] 
  [Text] We know what our position ise. We know that the 
old parties need a bogeyman to divert attention from their own 
failures. We are convinced that the German people are being 
subjected to foreign dictates. There is a historical reason for 
this. Never before in history has a nation twice suffered 
crushing defeat and humiliation in such a short period of time. 
The Old Testament principle of an eye for an eye, a tooth for a 
tooth still applies to Germany. 
  German politicians have become toothless over the years. 
Fear of the media, especially directed from the U.S. East 
Coast, has equipped them with an early warning system that 
triggers an appropriate response in the event of danger. 
Exercises in repentance are the order of the day. If there is 
any doubt, Federal President Richard von Weizsaecker leads the 
prayers. Whoever does not want to follow the "American way of 
life" is afraid of being ostracized for considering it corrupt. 
We have a damned duty and responsibility to fall into the arms 
of those who want to turn us into the 51st U.S. state. We are 
also opposed to the kind of double standard that in as short a 
time as possible mobilized half the world against Iraq just 
because oil interests were endangered, but watches passively as 
a people bleed to death on the territory of the former 
Yugoslavia. 
  We do not want such far-reaching liberalization that we are 
confronted with pornography and violence on television every 
evening. We do not want Germany to become a Harlem. We do not 
want the kind of security that only rich people can afford, with 
watch towers, barbed wire, and private armies. We do not want 
the Mafia, which has been reexported from the United States to 
Italy, to destroy our children with drugs. 
  Mammon is not our god. We believe that the strong should 
help the weak. What we value does not lie in a safe, but in our 
hearts! 
  It was worth struggling for these ideas. We do not want 
Gottfried Benn's merciless statement to become reality: "The 
Occident is not heading for destruction because of totalitarian 
systems or because of spiritual poverty, but because of the 
servility of intelligence vis-a-vis political expediency."

<F P=106> [Interview with Republikaner leader Franz Schoenhuber by </F>
Eusebio Val in Bonn; date not given: "Traditional Parties Stamp 
on Any Kind of German National Pride"] 
  [Text] Republikaner leader Franz Schoenhuber, 
speaking in an interview with LA VANGUARDIA, analyzed the 
problem of racism in Germany and the position of his party 
before the European elections. The Republikaner are the main 
force on the extreme right of German politics. 
  [Val] There are almost daily attacks against foreign 
residences in Germany. What do you feel about this phenomenon? 
  [Schoenhuber] They are criminal acts. 
  [Val] Some politicians and elements of the media say that 
your party is intellectually responsible for these actions. 
  [Schoenhuber] They are fools. 
  [Val] What are the causes of the violence? 
  [Schoenhuber] They are social in nature. There are social 
tensions in Germany that have been brought about by the 
traditional parties. 
  [Val] What have these parties done? 
  [Schoenhuber] Everything. 
  [Val] Can you be a little more specific? 
  [Schoenhuber] I have already talked about social tensions. 
The traditional parties reacted to this problem too late and 
then they stamped on German national pride. That is what caused 
the reaction. 
  [Val] Recently, it has been alleged that maybe some members 
of your party participated in attacks on foreigners. 
  [Schoenhuber] We are not involved. I do not like to talk 
about "maybe's." There must be specific accusations. If they 
are borne out, then we will expel those involved. 
  [Val] The main theme of your electoral program for the 
European elections is your opposition to the Maastricht Treaty. 
Why? 
  [Schoenhuber] Because I agree with de Gaulle's principle and 
uphold the Europe of nations. The Maastricht Treaty grants too 
many powers. We believe in the principle of subsidiarity. The 
most important things must be decided in each country. We want 
to maintain our German identity. We want to remain German -- 
European and German. 
  [Val] What role will a united Germany play at the end of the 
20th century? 
  [Schoenhuber] We must build a bridge between East and West, 
between the Western powers and the states of the East. 
  [Val] Do you believe the existing German borders to be 
fixed? 
  [Schoenhuber] Pacts and treaties must be fulfilled. However, 
everywhere around the world there exists the right to 
self-determination, and that includes for the German people. 
  [Val] What does that mean? 
  [Schoenhuber] It means that if the Basques say that they 
want 
to be Basques, or the Corsicans say that they want to be 
Corsican, so can the people of Silesia or anywhere else say that 
they want to be German. I am not saying that that is what I 
want, you understand. Nonetheless, referendums are the same 
everywhere in the world. 
  [Val] Why do you not form a united front with the other 
parties of the right, like the Union of the German People (DVU)? 
  [Schoenhuber] Because we think we are the only democratic 
and 
legitimate party on the Right. 
  [Val] Do you think you have been badly treated by the press? 
  [Schoenhuber] Yes, of course. The press is afraid. The 
situation here is incomparable. The past is a great weight 
around Germany's neck. The press reflects this fear. 
  [Val] How do you see your party faring in the European 
elections and future elections? 
  [Schoenhuber] Fine, because opinion polls do not reflect 
what 
people really think. People do not want to risk saying what 
they really think, but they will vote for what they think. 
  [Val] Returning to the subject of foreigners, do you think 
that Germany is now being transformed into a country of 
immigration, a multicultural society? Is that what the future 
holds? 
  [Schoenhuber] I hope not. 
  [Val] Why? 
  [Schoenhuber] Because I think each country must retain its 
own identity. We have nothing against foreigners, but we do not 
want, for example, the extreme situation whereby there are more 
foreigners living in a city than Germans. That is not a good 
thing. It will generate tension. 
  [Val] So what should the government's policy be with regard 
to foreigners? 
  [Schoenhuber] Steps have already been taken to change the 
asylum law. They stole that from our program. 
  [Val] What other measures do you propose? 
  [Schoenhuber] We are against giving foreigners the right to 
vote. Only those people holding a German passport should have 
the right to vote, whether they are black, yellow, or white. We 
are also opposed to dual citizenship.

<F P=106> [Article by Dr. Klaus Zeitler: "The Republikaners' 10 </F>
Political Commandments"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  First Commandment: Enough of the Debt Economy! </H5>
  No more tax increases on wages and salaries! Only stringent 
economies, the abolition of subsidies, drastic reductions in 
assistance to foreign countries and to asylum-seekers and 
economic refugees whose status has not been recognized as well 
as in assistance to the over 2 million foreign recipients of 
unemployment and social benefits will help in this respect! 
<H5>  Second Commandment: The State as a Self-Service Shop Is No </H5>
Longer Affordable! 
  There are over 400 ministers, state secretaries, minister 
presidents, as well as 3,000 deputies at the European, federal, 
and 16 laender levels. That is too many. The decay starts at 
the top; that is why economies have to be introduced at the top 
first. The sinfully expensive EU [European Union] bureaucracy 
must be trimmed. The Bundestag and the laender parliaments must 
be reduced in size, the number of laender must be reduced from 
16 to 10, and the number of deputies and ministers must be 
reduced by a third. 
<H5>  Third Commandment: The Immediate Adoption of an </H5>
Anticorruption Law! 
  All instances of bribe taking and other forms of abuse of 
office for personal gain on the part of members of federal and 
laender governments and deputies must be punishable to the same 
extent as in the case of public servants. There should be no 
guarantees of future jobs for politicians who neglect their 
duties. 
<H5>  Fourth Commandment: The State Should Set a Good Example </H5>
  In the wake of mass layoffs, drastic economies in the 
government apparatus at the federal and laender levels are 
overdue. With the transfer to Berlin, it should be possible to 
close down as many as four ministries, merge many federal 
agencies, and making considerable personnel savings. 
  Following the example of Baden-Wuerttemberg, the salaries 
paid to Landtag deputies could be greatly reduced in all the 
laender by abolishing the full-time status of deputies. Landtag 
membership on a part-time basis would save money as early 
retirement benefits would be lower and it would also ensure that 
deputies are more independent and have more varied experience. 
<H5>  Fifth Commandment: All Savings Should Be Used To Combat </H5>
Crime and Create Jobs! 
  Rationalization and savings on superfluous bureaucracy and 
savings of at least 10 percent over a parliamentary term of 
office to reduce debt following the example of the U.S. 
Government are feasible. This requires a cost-benefit analysis 
of every job and of superfluous subsidies. 
  State services must be contracted to private companies to a 
greater degree, economic criteria should be applied to budgets 
based on personal responsibility and oriented toward success 
instead of state-controlled bookkeeping. 
  The money saved in this way should be used to create jobs 
for 
German employees and combat crime. 
<H5>  Sixth Commandment: More Justice in the Economy and the </H5>
Distribution of Wealth! 
  What is needed instead of unjust capitalism and inefficient 
eastern socialism is a more democratic economy in which 
employees are participants through investment wages and joint 
ownership of assets. Five percent of all Germans own 90 percent 
of productive capital. According to the Protestant Church's 
memorandum "Common Welfare and Personal Profit", 2 percent of 
Germany's top wage earners own as much as the remaining 98 
percent of the population. That is unjust! That is why we need 
new ways in which workers can acquire economic and investment 
assets. 
<H5>  Seventh Commandment: Commbating Mass Unemployment! </H5>
  The problem of mass unemployment cannot be separated from 
the 
issue of mass immigration. The uncontrolled influx of over 2.5 
million foreigners from outside the EU has created competitive 
pressures on the German labor market at the expense of the 
German employee. 
  That is why the there must be an immediate stop to the 
employment of foreigners from East Europe at low wage rates that 
are socially unacceptable. 
  Foreign employees from outside the EU who have come to 
Germany since 1989 (the opening of the Berlin Wall) and have 
been receiving unemployment benefit/support or social assistance 
for over a year should be immediately sent back to their home 
countries! For humanitarian reasons, on their return, they 
could receive reintegration assistance, paid for by Germany, 
over a limited period of time, and that would then be deducted 
from development aid. 
  According to the Republikaner work ethic, there is no work 
that is fundamentally unacceptable. The abuse of unemployment 
and social assistance should be countered with incentives, 
community work in return for appropriate compensation. 
<H5>  Eighth Commandment: Germany's Future as a Center for </H5>
Business and Employment Must Be Ensured! 
  Free world trade cannot be pursued at the expense of German 
labor! That is why German companies along with their employees 
must develop new technical processes and competitive products 
for the world market. 
  This is the only in which Germany's future as a center of 
employment can be secured! Any form of social and ecological 
dumping at the expense of German employees in the form of 
imports from third countries with starvation wages and child 
labor is to be stopped using measures imposed by the state. 
  Pressure for lower wages through the manipulation of 
exchange 
rates in Asia, the East Bloc, and restricted access to markets 
in the United States, Japan, and third countries must be 
consistently fought. 
  German jobs must be protected through compensatory payments, 
export and import assistance, and antidumping measures so that 
world trade is not hampered by impermissible restrictions on 
trade. 
<H5>  Ninth Commandment: There Has To Be a Stop to the Ecological </H5>
Destruction of Our Environment 
  To reduce the growing threat to our lives from environmental 
damage, a transition to a socioecological economy is essential. 
In this regard, free market procedures to promote environmental 
protection, combined with tax incentives, are more effective 
than costly, bureaucratic intervention, which also involves 
imposing a further tax burden on citizens. 
  Short-term economic interests do not justify environmentally 
harmful intervention with respect to private property. The 
basis for responsibility under environmental legislation is the 
principle of payment by the polluter. 
<H5>  Tenth Commandment: "He Who Does Not Uphold His Right as a </H5>
German Relinquishes That Right" 
  The Republikaner actively support the fundamental principles 
of liberal democracy. 
  As German patriots, we support the German nation. We want a 
Europe of diversity, not one of Brussels uniformity. We 
consider the right of peoples to self-determination to be 
inalienable, we do not want a multicultural society, but a 
German nation that can freely determine foreign and domestic 
conditions, which is what the sovereign German people want.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Manfred Kimmerle: "EEC -- EC -- Maastricht </F>
(EU): Nothing But Illusions!"] 
  [Text] The signing of the Masstricht Treaty came at a time 
that saw an increasing number of international conflicts and 
economic and political change in East Europe. The treaty has 
not produced a monolithic construction and particularist 
interests continue to be represented. As for the granting of 
special rights, Denmark and Great Britain occupy first place. 
The FRG alone has accepted all the disadvantages that this 
"work" entails. 
  With the Treaty of Rome -- which founded the EEC (25 March 
1957) -- the participating countries only expressed their 
determination to proceed with integration in a way that would 
secure economic and social peace. Since 1973, the community has 
expanded its membership from six to 12 in three stages. As the 
number of countries increased, problems of coexistence began to 
develop, something which was overlooked in what amounted to 
integration euphoria.. 
  Other countries are also seeking admission; East Europe also 
harbors expectations. At the moment there is even talk of a 
two-speed Europe. There is nothing that illustrates the 
difference between desire and reality better. In the end, the 
number of timetables [for admission] will be the same as the 
number of members. 
<H5>  Sickness in the Head and in the Limbs </H5>
  If we view the pillars of the Maastricht Treaty, that is, 
the 
Treaty of Rome with its expansion to include economic and 
monetary union as well as social policy and environmental 
protection, a future European foreign and security policy, as 
well as cooperation in the field of domestic and legal policy, 
then the only verdict is: With the definitive participation of 
Kohl's government, a treaty has come into being that has finally 
transformed our republic from being a sick state into an infirm 
one. 
  The requirements for a common economic and monetary policy 
-- 
in the form of high-level price and monetary stability, a public 
finance situation that is tolerable in the long term, the 
favorable development of markets, balance of payments positions 
and labor unit costs -- cannot be realized in the long term too. 
The imbalances between the economies are too great, and that is 
reflected in frequent exchange rate adjustments, that is, 
devaluations, since the fall of 1992. In addition, Italy and 
Great Britain have left the exchange rate mechanism. This then 
constitutes the path leading to a common currency. 
<H5>  The Structural Engineering Is Wrong </H5>
  A further example of harmonization that exists only on paper 
is that of developing common social standards. This is another 
area in which Great Britain has accorded itself a special 
status. This means the sanctioning of substantial differences 
in social systems; Great Britain has obtained competitive 
advantages for itself that further endanger Germany's position 
as a center for industry. Companies are already transferring 
production facilities to Scotland or England. 
  The conditions for cooperation in domestic policy and legal 
policy as well as the explanations in the final act are a farce 
from the German viewpoint. The FRG, which is subject to 
enormous immigration pressures, has been left to cope by itself. 
Of course, this changes nothing about the domestic political 
failure of the established parties on this crucial issue. 
  The chancellor wants to be celebrated as Europe's architect. 
It is poor master builder who erects a building without making 
sure that the structural engineering is in order.

<F P=106> [Article by Guenter Bannas: "The Federation Does Not Want To </F>
Become a Bone Gnawed Clean--Federalists and Supporters of a 
Centralized State Argue About Future Legislative Competence"] 
  [Text] Edmund Stoiber formulates his criticism of the 
Federal Government in a manner that is full of sarcasm. He says 
he was "somewhat astonished" that it questioned decisions about 
projected changes to the Basic Law that were reached a year ago 
with a large consensus. In this way, the Bavarian 
minister-president, in an interview with this newspaper, entered 
a plea on behalf of strengthening federalism. In the difficult 
web between federal and land politics, differences of opinion 
have come to light in the coalition parties with regard to the 
future distribution of legislative authority, particularly in 
the Union [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social 
Union--CDU/CSU]. The disagreement is ongoing between the Federal 
Government and the governments of the laender that are under 
CDU/CSU leadership. 
  In the CDU/CSU Bundestag caucus, the impression 
prevails that caucus chairman Schaeuble stands--cautiously--on 
the side of the laender in this matter. On Tuesday [19 April] he 
said that they had to be granted additional rights. He left the 
question of their scope open. Last week, the leadership of the 
Christian Democratic Union and the Christian Social Union could 
not reach any agreement. They agreed to a "strategy meeting" for 
next Thursday to settle the discord--on what is hostile 
territory for the federal politicians, in Bavaria's land 
representation delegation in Bonn. 
<H5>  A Strategy Meeting </H5>
  Under the leadership of Chancellor's Office Minister Bohl, 
at 
that time, Schaeuble, Interior Minister Kanther, chairman of the 
constitutional committee Scholz (CDU) will negotiate on behalf 
of the CDU, the right-wing politician Jahn, and (for the 
laender), the Thuringian Minister-President Vogel and the 
minister of justice from Baden-Wuerttemberg, Schaeuble [as 
published]. Stoiber is coming on behalf of the CSU, as is his 
minister of the interior, Beckstein, his former secretary of 
state Wilhelm and Bundestag deputies Geis and 
Friedrich. On 17 May, the CDU/CSU caucus is supposed to deal 
ultimately with amendments to the Basic Law. 
  The contested recompensation law, Schaeuble said this week 
in 
the caucus, was, by contrast, an easy undertaking. Schaeuble 
still recalls the unification treaty between the Federal 
Republic and the former German Democratic Republic; in that, the 
demands of the laender for additional legislative authority were 
mentioned as a guideline for constitutional amendments. Still, 
the atmosphere between the federalists and the adherents of a 
strong central government is charged with tension. The authority 
of the Federal Government, Deputy Renate Hellwig was heard to 
say recently, should not be permitted, in the tension that 
exists between the European Union and the laendern, to become a 
"gnawed bone." Opinions of this kind, which President von 
Weizsaecker also voiced, Stoiber considers "superficial," that 
is to say, wrong. 
  Since the recommendations of the constitutional committee 
had 
been presented not only by the caucuses of the 
Bundestag, but also by the Bundesrat as 
draft legislation, the Federal Government had the opportunity to 
state its position. This position was most outspoken in its 
opposition of the proposed amendment to "competing legislation" 
(Article 72). In the decision of the Federal Cabinet, there is 
talk having to do with "constitutional policy reservations and 
reservations having to do with constitutional law." The 
formulations of the constitutional committee were said to be "on 
the whole unbalanced, leading in some instances, to considerable 
legal uncertainties and practical difficulties." In the 
constitutional committee, the representatives of the laender--in 
a broad alliance with the members of the 
Bundestag--prevailed in the passage of an amendment 
that should expand the authority of the laender. For a long 
time, there had been the complaint that the legislative 
authority had, over the years, in a creeping process, been 
concentrated in the Federal Government. At this time, the 
laender wanted to take effective countermeasures. 
  The concept of competing legislation has thus far given the 
laender legislative authority "as long as, and to the extent 
that" the Federal Government does not take advantage of its 
right to legislate. According to the current legal situation, 
the Federal Government has the right to legislate to the extent 
that there is a need for regulation on the level of federal law 
because a matter cannot be effectively regulated by the laendern 
or because the uniformity of living conditions in Germany is 
jeopardized. The recommendation that was decided by the 
constitutional committee imposes limits on this authority of the 
Federal Government. "In this area, the Federal Government has 
the right to legislate if, and to the extent that, the creation 
of equal living conditions throughout the country, or the 
preservation of legal uniformity in the common interest renders 
a federal legal provision necessary," the proposal of the 
constitutional committee says. For a long time, the Federal 
Government was reserved with its protest--probably for tactical 
reasons, among others. The constitutional amendment that is now 
the center of the controversy had been formulated within the 
constitutional committee as a wrestling match was going on 
between federal and land politicians concerning the competence 
of the Bundesrat (Article 23) insofar as European 
policy was concerned. Burdening these negotiations with the 
quarrel over legislative authority could have endangered the 
ratification of the European Community agreement of Maastricht 
in the Bundesrat. After the fact, therefore, within 
the Federal Government, there is talk of a "double legislative 
bundle" that the laender had made as a precondition for the 
ratification of the Maastricht agreement. 
<H5>  The Concerns of the Federal Government </H5>
  Above all, the "common state interest" as a condition for 
the 
Federal Government's legislative authority encounters the 
Federal Government's contradiction, the sharpness of which was 
surprising, even for the [CDU/CSU] Union's members of 
constitutional committee, who were long acquainted with the 
Federal Government's concerns. The Federal Government saw 
considerable hazards for the ability of the state to act as a 
whole and for the economic competitiveness of the "economic 
venue Germany," it says in the Federal Government's position 
statement. It is said that the proposed article was "a formulaic 
compromise" that rendered no reliable statements possible as to 
whether, and to what extent, the Federal Government could 
exercise its legislative powers. This would lead to 
uncertainties in all "areas that required settlement between 
competing legislation." The Federal Government considers these 
to be the following areas: the civil code, the commercial code, 
corporate law, the atomic law, emissions standards law, the 
social code, the construction code, penal law, and criminal 
trial law. A subsequent legal uncertainty is, in the view of the 
Federal Government, especially harmful for the ability of the 
German economy to compete, "since the economy must adhere to 
clear, predictable underlying conditions." Accordingly, leading 
economic associations and the trade unions have rejected the 
recommendation that was proposed, and they have done so using 
rhetoric that closely resembled that of the Federal Government. 
As a possible compromise, some consideration is being given 
within the Federal Government to eliminating the indication of 
the interests of the common state as a limiting condition. 
  Stoiber contradicts, reluctantly. "I hope that the decisions 
of the constitutional committee remain standing." From his 
standpoint, what is at stake is a compromise; he says originally 
the laender demanded more. In addition, Stoiber created a 
connection with expansions of authority for the Federal 
Government that were granted him in matters of national 
responsibility, organ transplantation and artificial 
insemination. The concerns "of some" groups, he says, were taken 
over by the Federal Government "unawares." Stoiber characterizes 
claims as false that according to the representations of the 
constitutional committee, the occupational training system in 
Germany could collapse. 
  The Federal Government also contradicted the vote of the 
constitutional committee concerning legislative authority in the 
area of universities. In article 75 of the Basic Law 
(constitution), at the present time, the Federal Government is 
granted authority over "the general principles of the tertiary 
educational system." In the presentation of the constitutional 
committee, this is limited to "admission to study, the courses 
of study, the examinations, university degrees, scholarly and 
artistic personnel." In the Federal Government's position 
statement, it says that the Federal Government was losing 
authority to govern the structure of tertiary education (in 
universities, specialized tertiary institutes, art schools, and 
others). That would lead to a "disintegrating development of the 
German tertiary educational landscape" and could jeopardize 
national recognition of performance in studies and on 
examinations. 
  Of lesser importance is the posture of denial of the Federal 
Government concerning recommendations of the constitutional 
committee pertaining to the time limits for position statements 
by the Federal Government relating to draft legislation by the 
Bundesrat. The Bundesrat would like to shorten 
them from three months to six weeks to speed up the processing 
of Bundesrat initiatives in the Bundestag. 
The Federal Government contradicted that; it said the three 
month limit that has existed thus far was even now often enough 
hard to adhere to. 
  Since time immemorial, the Bavarian minister-president has 
considered the Free Democratic Party [FDP] to be a "centralistic 
party." And yet, he also sees its sister party on the same path. 
He sees the weakening of the CDU in the laendern as the cause of 
this. But Stoiber would like to avoid the situation that the 
minister-presidents of the Social Democratic Party [SPD]--whose 
names and number he revels in naming--could present themselves 
as "lords keeper of the seal" of federalism and "present" the 
CDU.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Death Among the Autumn Leaves; the </F>
Disaster of a German Operation Against Arab Terrorists"] 
  [Text] The man, who had spent the past few hours in a 
detention cell in the Duesseldorf police headquarters, was 
raging like a maniac. "Idiot," he snapped at his interrogator, 
"why am I sitting behind bars?" 
  Marwan Khreesat, 49, born in Jordan, revealed an astounding 
story to the State Protection Department of the Federal Office 
of Criminal Investigation (BKA). "I'm one of you," maintained 
the Arab, who had been arrested as a suspected terrorist. He 
lamented that arrangements had been made with the German 
authorities that he would be given a chance to escape. 
  The criminal investigator couldn't understand this at all. 
He 
took the Arab's testimony, three pages' worth. Even the public 
prosecutor in charge began to suspect during the subsequent 
investigation that the prisoner apparently was under special 
protection. In any case, the record of the interrogation ended 
up shredded in the trash, thanks to a warning from West German 
secret service officials. In other respects, too, the arrested 
Jordanian enjoyed striking concessions. An office of the 
Duesseldorf public prosecutor telephoned the German Embassy in 
the Jordanian capital of Amman--Khreesat could speak with a 
fellow national who was sitting there in the office of the 
military attache. The latter made it very clear: "Trust the 
German authorities." 
  Germany, in the fall of 1988, two months before the downing 
of the jumbo jet over Lockerbie: Following a tip from the 
Israeli secret service, Mosad, and on the basis of their own 
investigations, German security officers surrounded a cell of 
the Palestinian terrorist group PFLP-GC (Popular Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine--General Command) in Neuss, near 
Duesseldorf. 
  The Israelis reported that the PFLP-GC fighters wanted to 
attack American targets in Central Europe. The Office for the 
Protection of the Constitution [BfV] for the time being knew 
only--according to an internal report--that the Palestinians 
"were recruiting new members" in Germany. 
  Pulling the strings was Syrian arch terrorist Hafez Kassem 
Hussein, today 48, member of the PFLP-CG Central Committee and 
leader of the European network. His nom de guerre: Dalkamoni. 
Officials knew that wherever he surfaced there was more going on 
than mere recruiting activities: The group was planning several 
bomb attacks. 
  In July 1988, the American cruiser Vincesses had mistakenly 
shot down an Iranian Airbus over the Strait of Hormuz. All 290 
passengers and crew had been killed. Arab groups swore 
revenge--if possible three airplanes were to be dispatched from 
the skies at the same time. 
  German security officials, therefore, planned a big coup 
against Arab terrorists on German soil. Code name for the 
operation: Operation Autumn Leaves. 
  Dalkamoni summoned the top specialist Khreesat, cover name 
"Safi," to Neuss. The partisan of the PFLP-GC had earned a 
reputation in the terrorist branch. Area of expertise: attacks 
against airlines. Khreesat is suspected of having helped prepare 
two attacks against jets belonging to Swissair and Israel's El 
Al, in 1970 and 1972. 
  What Dalkamoni didn't know was that Khreesat had threefold 
duties in the intelligence service and terrorist business. The 
East Berlin Ministry for State Security had learned early in 
October that the Arab was an agent for the West Germans--this 
from a "reliable source" in the German Intelligence Service 
[BND], according to a memorandum. The BND had recruited Khreesat 
"with the concurrence of the Jordanian secret service" to 
infiltrate PFLP commandos, for example. 
  But the big operation against Arab terrorism ended in a 
disaster that the authorities have shrouded in silence to this 
day: 

  -  A German policeman died while defusing a PFLP bomb; 
  -  An 
informant in the western services whom the BfV had infiltrated 
into the Neuss group was presumably liquidated; 
  -  A Karlsruh 
investigating judge released the second informant, Khreesat, 
even though he was responsible for constructing four bombs. 
  From the middle of October 1988 on, according to Stasi 
[State 
Security Service (GDR)] findings, Khreesat had become a full 
player in Operation Autumn Leaves. Whenever he or Dalkamoni 
telephoned, the BfV's tape recorders were running. Both men were 
under constant surveillance. 
  On 20 October, they talked about procuring "three large 
black 
cans with lids," as well as "gloves" and "paste." On the 
following day, they talked about "pointed buttons made of 
aluminum," four of which were to be "electric." On 24 October, 
according to a record, "it was determined that Dalkamoni 
purchased three mechanical alarm clocks and possibly one digital 
alarm clock.... Next Khreesat...together with Dalkamoni bought 
16 1.5-volt batteries (appliance batteries, finger thick), 
diverse small switches, screws, and a large tube of Pattex." 
  Khreesat reported to Damascus that he had made changes in 
the 
"medicine," and that it "was now better and stronger than 
before." What Khreesat meant was clear to the eavesdroppers: 
explosives. 
  He told his contacts in Amman that it would be "two to three 
more days" before he returned. Dalkamoni, too, called his 
homeland and a liaison person in the King's Take Away restaurant 
on Cyprus. The job, he said, was about finished. 
  From this the observers concluded that the Neuss terror duo, 
Dalkamoni-Khreesat, wanted to disappear and would be replaced by 
a new team--a very common practice with such operations. 
  Klaus Gruenewald, department chief in the Cologne BfV, 
sounded the alarm: "To ward off threatening danger, an executive 
intervention was imperative." 
  On 26 October 1988, special operation commandos of the 
police 
took 16 people belonging to the Neuss Palestinian unit into 
temporary custody. Whole arsenals of electronic apparatus and 
weapons were seized. Among those arrested was Ramzi Diab, born 
in Akko, Israel, in 1959. Diab appears only incidentally in the 
German Autumn Leaves papers. An official noted: "n.p.u., which 
means: further personal data unknown." 
  But that is anything but the truth. Diab, a secret service 
collaborator, had been assigned to watch Dalkamoni, which the 
BfV knew--a dangerous case of double dealing. Diab is said later 
to have been exposed and murdered by the PFLP-GC. 
  The carelessness with which German authorities carried out 
Operation Autumn Leaves also cost a German policeman his life. 
He had lived with this danger for over four years. On 20 march 
1989, BKA Chief Commissioner Hans-Juergen Sonntag typed on his 
office typewriter a kind of letter of resignation: 
  "Withdrawal of my willingness to serve. I hereby withdraw my 
declaration to volunteer to deactivate unconventional explosive 
and incendiary devices." 
  It seemed clear to him that his chief would have no 
objections: Star athlete Sonntag, parachutist, body builder, 
swimmer, and soccer player, as well as tennis partner of BKA 
President Heinrich Boge. And the young man had had the prospect 
of a new job for a long time: security officer at the German 
Embassy in Teheran. 
  The last bomb that he was to disassemble took the life of 
Sonntag, 35. On a special table in the basement of the office 
lay a stereo tuner, which looked harmless, but which in reality 
was a devilish explosive trap--a piece of Khreesat's making. 
  "Come on, Thomas," said Sonntag to a younger colleague, 
"let's go to the lunchroom first and then get the job over with 
quickly. If it explodes, we'll be in heaven." The dangerous work 
had almost been completed. "It was just a matter of the last 
screw," Sonntag's father knows. An accidental turn of the 
screwdriver activated the firing mechanism. Sonntag survived the 
tremendous explosion only a few hours. The other official was 
badly injured. 
  Three days later, at the small cemetery in a little spot 
called Erfweiler-Ehlingen, between Saarbruecken and the French 
border: State funeral for Chief Commissioner Sonntag, formulaic 
speeches for the good policeman who had to die in service for 
his country. 
  No one wants to say how absurd Sonntag's death was in the 
jungle of the secret services. The official died from the blast 
of a bomb that the informant of another German security service 
had put together. It is fitting for this tragedy that the German 
judiciary did not issue a new arrest warrant for Khreesat for 
the involuntary manslaughter of policeman Sonntag until the fall 
of 1990, when the perpetrator was no longer in reach. 
  The Fifth Criminal Division of the Superior Land Court in 
Frankfurt mentioned the scandal only in passing when, on 3 June 
1991, after eight months of proceedings, it sentenced the 
terrorists Dalkamoni and an accomplice to 15 and 12 years in 
prison for other attacks: 
  "In October 1988, Dalkamoni asked the fellow accused, Marwan 
Khreesat, an expert in the production of explosives, to come to 
the Federal Republic. Khreesat was to make bombs out of radios. 
These bombs were intended to cause plane crashes." 
  Operation Autumn Leaves ended up in the registry.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Extra Tax for Next Five Years"] </F>
  [Text] According to Minister Friedrich Bohl (CDU) 
[Christian-Democratic Union], the 7.5-percent solidarity 
surcharge on income and corporate tax, to come into effect at 
the beginning of 1995, is to last at least five years, and 
probably even longer. 
  Bohl told SUEDWESTFUNK [Southwest Radio] yesterday that the 
income generated by this surcharge had already been taken into 
account in planned budget spending over the next five years, but 
it looks as if the surcharge might have to be kept longer. Bohl 
pointed out that between 135 and 140 billion marks have to be 
paid to the new laender every year. "No one can say how much 
longer we are going to live with the heritage of socialism," 
said Bohl. "Anyone who attempts to set a time limit to this is 
merely deceiving others." But the government would also like to 
abolish this surcharge as soon as possible, Bohl said. 
  FDP [Free Democratic Party] chairman Klaus Kinkel welcomed 
the fact that the "CDU seems prepared to accept our demand that 
the solidarity surcharge be reexamined after three years," 
something which Bohl had categorically denied on behalf of the 
government. Kinkel added that this was not by any means a 
condition for continued FDP cooperation with the CDU. 
  Acting SPD [Social Democratic Party] chairman Lafontaine 
accused the chancellor of having approved the solidarity 
surcharge without knowing how prices and incomes would develop 
in future.

<F P=106> ["J.K."-initialed report: "Several Thousand Jobs To Go at </F>
Opel"] 
  [Excerpt] Frankfurt/Main -- Opel will cut another several 
thousand jobs. According to information received from the 
German subsidiary of the U.S. automobile group General Motors, 
the management and the work council are currently talking "about 
necessary measures to adapt the size of the work force to 
requirements." In the enterprise, which has 47,600 employees, 
the work force will be reduced by some 2,000 men and women 
"beyond natural fluctuation for structural reasons by the end of 
the year." In plain English this means that twice as many jobs 
as the figure that was mentioned are to be cut as part of 
streamlining measures. After all, with a company of the size of 
Opel, "natural fluctuation" should involve about 2,000 people a 
year. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- The level of production in West 
German industry in February/March 1994 remained unchanged in 
comparison with the same period last year. There are however 
considerable differences between the individual industrial 
sectors, the Economic Affairs Ministry announced in Bonn on 3 
May. Big losses were registered in mining (down 8.5 percent) 
and consumer goods (down 4.4 percent). On the other hand, there 
was a rise in production in the construction sector (up 4.1 
percent) and in basic and production goods (up 3.8 percent) 
  According to the statistics, from February to March 1994, 
the 
increase in production was two percent, with the upturn coming 
in the construction sector with 7 percent and electricity and 
gas supplies with 1.5 percent. The processing and mining 
sectors on the other hand each had a drop in production of 1.5 
percent.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Dietrich Zwaetz: "Clinton Is Losing </F>
Confidence"] 
  [Text] We are one-third into 1994. This leaves eight 
months for the dollar apologists to realize their bold forecasts 
made at the beginning of the year: That the U.S. currency could 
get up to 1.85 to 1.95 against the German mark [DM] in 1994. At 
the moment there is not much indication of the greenback taking 
that course. On the contrary: The U.S. central bank is forced 
by Washington to protect the dollar from suffering any further 
losses. 
  Initially everything seemed to work out as predicted for the 
dollar. In Germany, interest rates are dropping, in the United 
States they have been on their way up again since 4 February. 
The U.S. economy is booming, while the German and Japanese 
economies are going downhill. Both these developments should 
have made international capital flow toward the dollar. 
  But instead, the U.S. currency is approaching another low 
against the yen (lowest exchange rate so far: 100.35 yen), and 
it has dropped to DM1.65. 
  The Clinton Administration will have to realize -- and this 
might come as a key experience to President Clinton and Treasury 
Secretary Lloyd Bentsen -- that markets do not go by the White 
House's solemn promises. A declaration for a strong dollar, 
like the one Bentsen made at the end of last week -- the 
government is not planning to use the dollar/yen exchange rate 
for reducing the huge foreign trade deficit with Japan -- is 
being ignored by the markets. Thus, the Federal Bank in New 
York, the executive authority of central bank policy, was asked 
on Friday [29 April] to buy large amounts of dollars for foreign 
currencies. "This is not part of our Japanese policy," a 
high-ranking Fed representative commented somewhat 
heavy-handedly. Washington does not want to make foreign trade 
easier for the new Japanese Prime Minister Hata. Also, Japan 
is doing everything it can to avoid this. Before the Hata 
government was even fully in office, the Ministry for 
International Trade and Industry rejected U.S. criticism of the 
Japanese market being sealed off. A survey of foreign trade 
barriers that was presented by U.S. Trade Representative Mickey 
Kantor in March, is "not supported by facts." It contains 
"ambiguous arguments," and an "objective standard is not 
perceptible." 
  That is food for the skeptical mood in the markets. The 
Clinton Administration is finding it hard to appear credible 
with its exchange rate policy. Of course, the U.S. 
Administration would welcome a weaker dollar, especially with 
regard to the export berserks, Germany and Japan, to reduce the 
foreign trade deficit that soared to $116 billion in 1993. A 
more expensive yen would be the best way to balance the huge 
import surplus in trade with Japan, which went up to almost $60 
billion in 1993. Since a more expensive yen and a more 
expensive German mark would fit the foreign trade concept so 
well, the Clinton Administration has a hard time appearing 
credible in the markets and inspiring confidence. 
  But Clinton and Bentsen also fear that a weak dollar might 
frighten off foreign investors. That is why they are trying to 
smooth out fluctuations of the dollar exchange rate by 
interventions to avoid disorderly conditions in the markets. 
  U.S. exchange-rate experts do not yet want to believe in a 
new global speculation directed against the dollar. But: "The 
Clinton Administration has lost confidence," Scott E. Pardee, 
former foreign operations chief at the New York Fed and 
currently working for Japanese broker Yamaichi, said. This has 
contributed to the greenback losing 10 percent over the yen: At 
the beginning of the year $1 bought 113 yen. In relation to the 
German mark, the dollar lost 6.5 percent since the beginning of 
January. 
  The dollar bulls have eight months left to realize their 
1994 
forecast. Will Clinton be able to help them, thus making U.S. 
policy more credible?

<F P=106> [Commentary by Josef Joffe: "Cold Shower From Damascus"] </F>
  [Text] The Israelis were looking forward to the Syrians 
too soon. The autonomy agreement with the Palestinians was 
under way and now -- so goes the good news from the eternal 
optimist, Foreign Minister Peres -- one was having one's "heads 
and hands free to deal with Syria." After all, his boss, 
Yitzhaq Rabin, had been more and more clearly offering the 
Syrians a deal on the Golan: "For peace I am ready to clear 
settlements." 
  On Sunday [1 May], a member of the Israeli delegation in the 
negotiations even "anonymously" announced the implementation: 
Damascus was ready to respect Israeli security needs, and that 
"is encouraging." After all, so far Syria had always insisted 
that questions of security "can be dealt with only after the 
complete withdrawal from the Golan Heights." 
  The next day, the icy shower came from Damascus. There, U.S. 
Secretary of State Christopher conveyed to dictator al-Asad 
Jerusalem's most recent proposals, the essence of which is: the 
gradual withdrawal from the Golan Heights in exchange for 
gradual peace -- according to the time-tested recipe "one piece 
of land, one piece of peace," which was so successfully tried 
out by Egypt and Israel with the Camp David Agreement. 
  Yet, hardly had Christopher departed than his Syrian 
colleague al-Shar' began to attack the trial balloon with a 
pike: "Never! We will not accept peace in steps." Complete 
withdrawal first, and only then will peace talks be possible. 
Just as his boss al-Asad, al-Shar' also knows that the Israelis 
will not accept such a deal. So why the brutal public rejection? 
  First, because such tactics are a part of any poker game. 
For months, the Israelis have presented the Syrians as more 
willing than they really are to build up pressure against the 
enemy in the form of expectations. And Damascus has as often 
resorted to cold water to achieve an even better price. And 
since Damascus has so far fared well with this tactic -- Rabin 
has continually increased his offer -- the Syrians will not 
abandon their course unless they have to. Second, in the Middle 
East nothing is being negotiated in public, let alone being 
discussed in public, because there are no free media in the Arab 
region. What is announced hardly ever reflects the real state 
of negotiations. Third, the Syrians believe that they have time. 
The Golan is mainly of symbolic value for al-Asad; Syria has 
existed without it for 27 years, so a few more do not really 
matter. 
  Still, even this most cunning of all tacticians knows that 
Jerusalem will not give away one inch of soil without a return 
service. Whether the Israeli Army controls the attack axis 
toward Galilee, or, conversely, Syrian cannoneers can directly 
look down on territory of Israeli settlements is a question of 
life and death for Israel. Thus, Israel will give way only step 
by step in order to test Syria's intentions. After all, al-Asad 
also knows that he is unable to get a better deal than Egypt, 
Israel's far more dangerous opponent.

  France is maintaining close contact with the UN secretary

  Finally, as long as conflicts continue, it is our duty to 
continue to carry out humanitarian operations. French NGOs

Assembly on Tuesday [3 May] began a debate on a controversial 
bill laying down fines of up to 20,000 francs ($3,448) for 
people using English words, when a French equivalent exists. 
  The bill, ridiculed abroad and contested by sections of the 
ruling right-wing coalition, was nevertheless expected to be 
voted in its essentials in second reading by the lower house of 
parliament. 
  The upper house, the Senate, has already voted the bill with 
communist and right-wing support while socialist senators 
abstained, calling it "repressive" and "antiyouth." [passage

<F P=106> [Report by Michel Noblecourt: "The Appearance of Consensus"] </F>
  [Text] At first glance, we are once again surrounded by 
consensus regarding the fight against unemployment. Both the 
right- and the left-wing politicians agree in emphasizing that 
unemployment is not a matter of fate, and certainly not merely a 
result of economic policy, since action against unemployment can 
even be a priority. On both the Right and the Left, there is 
talk of a "social pact" or a "new social contract." Francois 
Mitterrand set the tone during his New Year's message at the 
beginning of the year by pleading, albeit in vain, for a social 
contract for employment to mobilize all parties, i.e, the state, 
employers, and trade unions, around the "most serious question 
facing us at the end of this century." With less than a year to 
go until the presidential election, there is nothing amazing 
about such convergent approaches, because it is most likely that 
the election will revolve around this issue. However, if we 
take a closer look, the consensus is only apparent. 
  During the Conference on Social Transformation held in 
Rennes, Michel Rocard rejected any kind of timid or overly 
cautious action against unemployment. "The problem," he said, 
"is to stop the endless discussions and take strong and more 
powerful action than we have done so far." Above all, the first 
secretary of the PS [Socialist Party] wants to mobilize social 
forces in the field, reactivate political will, and revive the 
idea of reducing the workweek to four days. He did not, 
however, take the plunge by advocating an economic policy that 
is genuinely different from the one followed from 1988 to 1993, 
which was based on the defense of the strong franc and on 
maintaining the overall balance of forces within society. 
  Only Lionel Jospin called for a "major change in our 
country's economic policy, which would give priority to the 
fight against unemployment and in favor of employment." One 
year after the death of Pierre Beregovoy, everything still leads 
us to believe that the Socialists, if they were to return to 
power, would be less orthodox in their economic policy and, in 
particular, less hesitant about the suitability of letting 
public deficits rise as long as they make it possible to revive 
economic activity and take action to promote employment. 
  During the Convention on Labor organized by the RPR [Rally 
for the Republic], Jacques Chirac went further, supporting 
Edouard Balladur's economic and social policy, while at the same 
time letting it be understood between the lines -- but less 
harshly than Philippe Seguin -- that this policy was proving to 
be insufficient and that we must turn toward another policy. He 
emphasized that unemployment is not "one priority among others," 
but that it is "more important than anything else." 
Paradoxically, Labor Minister Michel Giraud agreed with Mr. 
Chirac "without reservation," thus pretending to be unaware that 
his statements included an implicit disavowal of his five-year 
law on employment, which he is having so much trouble 
implementing. At the same time, Edouard Balladur reiterated his 
desire to "build another society which would differ from the 
easy-growth or crisis society." For all this, the prime 
minister does not intend to change his economic policy, even if 
he knows that slowing down the growth of unemployment, or even 
some sort of haphazard stabilization, will not be enough to 
convince the French that his action against unemployment has 
succeeded. 
<H5>  Shifting Into High Gear </H5>
  In order to combat the exclusion which, according to Jacques 
Chirac, "desocializes and alienates people," the politicians are 
all more or less aware that we must shift into high gear, but 
they still have some differences of opinion about how this 
should be done. There is agreement on the need to reduce labor 
costs, but each person favors his own method for doing so, since 
the debate on a minimum wage for young people and youth job 
training contracts has revealed a genuine gap between the Right 
and the Left. They are all talking about local community 
services, about making better use of the 500 billion francs 
currently used for unemployment benefits, and about flexibility 
and the new organization of work, but the same words do not 
always mean the same thing. Already, the debate on the 32-hour 
workweek, revived by the Right during the debate on the 
five-year employment bill, revealed the persistence of 
conflicting approaches with regard to reducing working hours, 
depending on whether or not it is accompanied by wage cuts. 
  So, should the priority given to actions to counter 
unemployment be formally reaffirmed in a referendum, which would 
require an amendment to the Constitution's Article 11 to extend 
its scope to include social problems? That is [Assembly 
Speaker] Philippe Seguin's iconoclastic proposal. On Monday, 2 
May he received the support of Jacques Chirac. However, if it 
proves "necessary" and even essential for politicians to renew 
their debate on the best ways to fight unemployment by placing 
it at the center of their policies, then it is hard to see what 
a referendum on "zero social exclusion" would contribute to the 
debate. 
  Such a proposal seems just as contestable and demagogic as 
the one made by Bernard Tapie, who wanted to make unemployment 
illegal on the grounds that the right to work is enshrined in 
the Constitution. It is not necessary to hold a referendum to 
raise awareness. To become aware of the urgent need for a new 
approach, one need only observe the implosion of a society 
undermined by unemployment and exclusion, which is already 
operating at different speeds. And there is more than a risk of 
this happening, unlike what Mr. Chirac would have us believe.

<F P=106> [Article by Jacques Amalric: "Indecisive President Clinton"] </F>
  [Text] Is there a President in the White House? An 
increasing number of European and Asian leaders have begun to 
wonder. While they put the question more politely, they are 
genuinely worried by the vacillation of U.S. foreign policy, 
which too often seems to boil down to what one of them terms an 
"export of national policy." This lack of a coherent foreign 
policy, which brings to mind certain aspects of Jimmy Carter's 
presidency, is even worse in a world which has lost its bearing 
following the collapse of the Communist bloc: It encourages 
today's international adventurers and will lead to more disorder 
throughout the world. 
  The list of presidential fumbles is a long one; on some 
days, 
the President reportedly spends no more than half an hour on 
world affairs, while he has increased tenfold White House 
spending on opinion polls. First on the list is the Somalia 
debacle, where the U.S. contingent was literally ousted by the 
fighters of one lone warlord, General Aideed, pronounced public 
enemy number one by the United Nations. U.S. public opinion 
demanded and obtained total withdrawal; the last GI has now left 
the former Italian colony. Rwanda's murderous presidential 
guard, if not encouraged by this inglorious retreat, can 
nevertheless keep slaughtering cheerily, as the U.S. 
Administration announced on Sunday [1 May] that any U.S. 
intervention was out of the question, even as part of a UN 
operation. 
  This overt refusal to even consider sending ground soldiers 
has already wreaked havoc in Bosnia, where the Serbs have known 
for a long time that UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] troops will 
always be in insufficient numbers to be efficient. There too, 
President Clinton's main concern is to follow as closely as 
possible the whim of opinion polls: Yes to air strikes around 
Sarajevo last January and around Gorazde in April, but no 
engagement on the ground whatsoever, even though the Pentagon's 
best experts have repeatedly stated that air strikes would not 
do much to damage Serb forces. Indeed, this became all the more 
clear during the first days of the offensive against Gorazde, 
when Serb troops felt free to keep advancing. This episode 
proved particularly costly, not only for the Muslim population, 
but also for the credibility of NATO, whose main pillar is the 
United States and which candidate Clinton pledged to strengthen. 
All this does not keep the White House, which is incapable of 
choosing between negotiation and its refusal to commit itself on 
the ground, from advocating the end of the embargo on arms 
delivery to the Muslims one day, and a gradual lifting of 
sanctions against Serbia the next. 
  Such an inability to devise a clearcut policy has been 
evident not only to Belgrade or Pale. Haiti's military rulers 
swiftly understood how they could take advantage of America's 
vacillation in Somalia. As a result, they refused any 
arrangement with President Aristide, whom they ousted in 1991. 
Vivid in everyone's memory is the sight of that U.S. ship 
driven back by a handful of tontons macoutes. But do people 
remember candidate Clinton condemning President Bush for his 
refusal to take in Haitian "boat people?" The U.S. President is 
currently pursuing the exact same policy. True, he has now 
pledged to alter it slightly, because of some polls showing that 
black Americans are increasingly incensed by it, and Bill 
Clinton needs their votes if he is to be reelected in 1996. 
  One can be assured that Saddam Hussayn, who is still in 
power 
after his defeat in the Gulf war because the Americans do not 
want Iraq to fall apart, has been looking with interest at 
Washington's bogus determination, after exploiting for all it 
was worth the downing of the two American helicopters by U.S. 
fighters within Kurdistan airspace. The same may be said of Kim 
Il-song, North Korea's old tyrant, who has been ignoring 
injunctions from the United States and the inspectors of the 
Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency and still keeps 
the lid on his atomic military programs. Meanwhile, China will 
not help as long as America has not renewed its most-favored 
nation status, so sure it is of President Clinton's bottomless 
capacity for doing nothing.

    [Editorial Report] Recent reports in the French press on 
the presidential elections has dealt with the rivalry between 
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and Rally for the Republic (RPR) 
leader Jacques Chirac, the divisions within the Right, and the 
possible reduction of the presidential term from seven to five 
years. 
<H5>  Balladur Versus Chirac </H5>
  According to Philippe Reinhard writing in the 15 April Paris 
daily LE QUOTIDIEN DE PARIS, the tension between Balladur and 
Chirac, "friends for 30 years," was "inevitable." Since both 
aspire to the presidency, "competition could only turn to 
declared hostility," Reinhard contends, and the rapid 
deterioration of their relations is "easily explained." Chirac 
supporters are all the more "pugnacious" because the prime 
minister's sustained popularity made them fear for their leader 
for a long time. However, their rejoicing in Balladur's 
decreasing popularity may be premature, Reinhard continues. 
Even if public opinion is now negative about Balladur as prime 
minister, polls indicate that he is still the voters' favorite 
for president, while Chirac has never surpassed the "fateful 20 
percent" threshhold. As the presidential elections draw nearer, 
the outcome is "more uncertain than ever," Reinhard writes. 
Chirac's success will depend on his ability to attract voters 
beyond his own party; according to Reinhard, his acceptance of 
centrist Dominique Baudis to head the Right's list for the 
European Parliament elections suggests he is attempting to do 
this. As for Balladur, he must first end the decline in his 
popularity and ensure that no more mistakes are made by being 
"less attentive" to the "suggestions" of a governing majority 
that has involved him in controversial issues such as the law on 
secular education. The beginning of an economic recovery may 
allow him to solve unemployment--his most pressing problem--by 
the end of 1994. However, failure to solve this problem will 
mean Balladur has labored "for the benefit of others," Reinhard 
concludes. 
<H5>  Right Termed `Incorrigible' </H5>
  Reinhard's editorial in the 15 April of LE QUOTIDIEN DE 
PARIS 
terms the Right "incorrigible" because of its propensity to 
continue quarreling even while aware that division may spell 
defeat in the presidential elections. The situation is 
complicated by the fact that candidates "have never been so 
numerous" in the ranks of the majority, Reinhard writes. 
Besides Chirac and Balladur, UDF [French Democratic Union] 
leader Valery Giscard d'Estaing will probably not renounce a 
last fight for the title. However, the parliamentary domination 
of the RPR/UDF keeps the two parties' officials from recognizing 
that the Left has succeeded in partially restructuring itself 
and that it may profit from the Right's internecine quarrels, 
Reinhard writes. The deteriorating Chirac-Balladur relationship 
may presage an "annus horribilis" for the majority, he opines. 
Unity in the upcoming Euroelections would go a long way toward 
allaying fears that the Right might lose the presidential 
elections. Additionally, general observance of the traditional 
rule postulating a single candidacy as early as the first round 
of the presidential elections is essential. However, personal 
ambition and the influence exerted by the potential candidates' 
entourage will come into play. "As surely as the Trojan war, the 
candidates' war will also take place," Reinhard predicts. 
<H5>  Presidential Term </H5>
  Changing the presidential term from seven to five years 
would 
be easy today, Reinhard writes in the 18 April LE QUOTIDIEN DE 
PARIS. With few exceptions, most political parties and their 
leaders advocate it, making adoption of this measure possible. 
In fact, Giscard d'Estaing recently proposed that a referendum 
be held on this issue in conjunction with the 12 June 
Euroelections, a suggestion that Balladur has rejected. While 
the prime minister's reasons are not "altogether 
convincing"--the "risk of polluting the Euroelections" that 
Balladur invoked is seen by Reinhard as "very limited"--his 
refusal has a justification. The prime minister can "propose" a 
referendum to the president of the Republic, but the final 
decision rests with the president, Reinhard writes. President 
Mitterrand, now in the fourteenth year of his presidency, would 
be reluctant to oppose the idea and thus open an institutional 
debate, for some might suggest he apply the five-year limit to 
his current term as well. Again, if Balladur failed to obtain 
Mitterrand's agreement on the referendum, other members of the 
majority, first and foremost Giscard, would denounce Balladur's 
powerlessness in a cohabitation government, Reinhard contends. 
However, a genuine debate should take place, he continues, as a 
seven-year term would be too long for today's potential 
candidates, all of whom are over 60.

CSO 

    [Editorial Report] Writing in the 20 April Paris daily LE 
FIGARO, Jacques Baumel, vice president of the Defense Commission 
of the National Assembly, comments that in a world that just 
emerged from the Cold War and is already troubled by ethnic and 
other conflicts, defense planning is of the utmost importance. 
At the same time, defining the new orientations for the national 
defense is not an easy task. While the law may not take fully 
into account the new threats and the means to confront them, it 
does end "years of irresponsibility and hasty decisions" that 
weakened the French defense apparatus by gradually abolishing 
some 60 regiments and limiting military service to 10 months, 
Baumel writes. The new law reestablishes a continuity that will 
reassure military officials and industrialists, for it envisions 
for the next six years a significant financial outlay of 613 
billion francs in an overall context of crisis and downsizing of 
state budgets. Planned allocations will allow the continuation 
of a number of burdensome programs which are too far advanced to 
be stopped, but which will suffer delays. One of them is the 
Rafale aircraft, to be delivered at the "ridiculous" rate of one 
or two aircraft per year. Another is the Leclerc tank, 
production of which is slated to reach no more than 200 units 
per year. Carrying out such programs, according to Baumel, will 
absorb total allocations and exclude the production of 
sophisticated high technology weapons whose efficacy was proven 
during the Gulf war, e.g. stealth aircraft, satellites and 
antimissile missiles. Baumel contends that nationally-produced 
weapons programs are coming to an end and that the time has come 
for coproduction agreements, even though they are often 
"disappointing, costly and too slow." At the same time, France 
must strive to preserve "excellence" in the nuclear and 
electronic domains. 
  The most serious repercussions of the military planning law 
will be felt in the vital nuclear field, Baumel continues, since 
the law makes no mention of nuclear testing. It thus gives the 
future chief of state the responsibility for making a "grave" 
decision on whether to continue nuclear testing in a much more 
difficult context, since the choice of a "second nuclear 
component" has been delayed until 1997. There is also a "serious 
gap" between the white book on defense, which presents various 
scenarios for intervention abroad, and the real means given 
French forces for fire power, air and maritime transports, and 
rapid action deployment. Finally, the law does not mention the 
capability for precise strikes on military targets with dual-use 
weapons, which are more precise and lighter than the heavy 
nuclear artillery of missile-launching submarines, in case 
missiles are launched from beyond the Mediterranean or the Near 
East. While in principle the law takes into account space 
activities, real-time information and the mobility of commands, 
this "modest undertaking" will not produce concrete 
results--save for the Helios system--before the beginning of the 
next century. France will thus remain in a "regrettable 
situation of dependence" on the United States as far as 
large-scale operations are concerned. In fact, all programs 
envisioned in the law will be implemented only if the armaments 
industry achieves a productivity gain of 2 percent a year, to 
compensate for the 0.5 percent increase of allocations in real 
terms. This will require a "strenuous restructuring, management 
and cooperation effort" entailing the elimination of at least 
100,000 jobs, while simultaneously preserving the know-how and 
competence of French engineers, Baumel concludes. 
  In an editorial in the 21 April Paris daily LIBERATION, 
Gerard Dupuy bemoans the fact that the "famous peace dividends" 
of four years ago have "gone up in smoke" and that military 
expenditures are again rising. This contrasts with the policies 
followed in comparable countries, as well as with the 
restrictions affecting other budget items, Dupuy contends. It 
also points up a lack of adaptation of French military doctrine 
to the new situation, since the old, nuclear-based policy is 
being maintained while another is "discreetly" put in place, he 
continues. Inasmuch as it is always costly and never practical 
to conduct two policies at the same time, the public will soon 
perceive the irony of announcing a rise in military expenditures 
just when the Gorazde issue reveals the powerlessness of 
European arms in general and French in particular. Only a 
success in the Bosnian peacemaking effort could have convinced a 
"reticent" public opinion of the utility of military 
expenditures. The French, Dupuy concludes, "will have the 
impression they are paying a high price without really knowing 
why."

will end on 6 May. On 7-8 May, "the situation will be examined 
by the members of the Freedom Alliance," and on 8 May, Prime 
Minister Silvio Berlusconi will break his silence. 
  Berlusconi is being cautious over the timetable and is 
denying that there are obstacles concerning the possible make-up 
of the government: "I believe that there will not be any 
opposition." The government's program is "very advanced" and 
will only be revealed when it will be presented to the Chamber 
of Deputies. He also confirmed that there would be a meeting 
this evening at 2100 hours between the heads of the parties in 
the Freedom Alliance. Umberto Bossi will also be present at the

<F P=106> [Interview with Italian Northern League Secretary Umberto </F>
Bossi by Alberto Gentili in Rome; date not given: "Bossi: `If 
Berlusconi Denies Us the Interior Ministry, He Must Form a 
Government Without the League'"] 
  [Text] [Gentili] Senator Bossi, has the trial of strength 
begun? 
  [Bossi] No, and I do not even know whether there will be 
one. 
The summit went off very well. We have got down to business. 
  [Gentili] On what? 
  [Bossi] On the program. We started with the general outline, 
and the choice of ministers will emerge from that. 
  [Gentili] No names? How come? 
  [Bossi] Well, we surveyed the scene in general terms. We 
shall show our hands next week. For the time being, not even 
Berlusconi has the names. But there will undoubtedly be some 
cancellations. 
  [Gentili] Who? 
  [Bossi] Those probable or potential ministers who are well 
known to take a stance that differs widely from the government 
interest. 
  [Gentili] Do you mean Pannella? 
  [Bossi] Yes. 
  [Gentili] And Dini as well? 
  [Bossi] Who? That guy that some people want to send to the 
Treasury? Well, as far as he is concerned, what we have already 
said holds good: This is a ministry that cannot be given to 
someone who has close ties with circles that have already 
received a great deal from the privatizations. The Treasury 
must have a free market mentality, not work within a monopoly 
mindset. 
  [Gentili] Did the League repeat its usual requests? 
Treasury, Industry, and the Viminale [Interior Ministry]? 
  [Bossi] Yes, although I realize we cannot have them all. 
  [Gentili] Do you mean you might give way on the Viminale? 
  [Bossi] I hardly think so. 
  [Gentili] Not even if [Judge] Di Pietro were minister? 
  [Bossi] He is an examining magistrate; how can he be 
interior 
minister? What is more, Di Pietro may well be a point of 
reference for public opinion, but he certainly cannot expect the 
League to help him. 
  [Gentili] Can he expect the League to veto him? 
  [Bossi] No, we shall not exercise vetoes. 
  [Gentili] [National Alliance leader] Fini maintains that you 
are ill-advised to lay claim to ministries. "The League's 
electorate attaches no sentimental value to the Cencelli manual 
[power-sharing system]," he says. 
  [Bossi] He is joking. I have no fondness for it either. We 
are talking about ministers because the government cannot be 
formed with technicians; it needs politicians who meet the 
requirements of a political project. If we were to go back to 
the era of technicians, it would create a dangerous situation. 
  [Gentili] What situation? 
  [Bossi] The technicians would be answerable directly to 
Berlusconi, and that would give him enormous power. Anyway, the 
issue still remains the same: The League is asking for a number 
of key ministries because the League has taken it upon itself to 
act as umpire and to ensure that the game is played according to 
the rules. 
  [Gentili] What if Berlusconi were to turn your requests 
down? 
  [Bossi] He will grant them, you will see. He can hardly form 
a government all on his own. 
  [Gentili] What do you mean by that? 
  [Bossi] That the government will definitely be formed, but 
that the League does not necessarily have to be in it. Either 
we get the means, by which I mean the ministries, to perform our 
umpiring role, or we forget it. However, I think Berlusconi is 
willing to negotiate. He, too, knows that the common good, as 
of now, is governability, and that failure to form an executive 
might even jeopardize the democratic framework. This is why the 
League will give the country a government, but the other values 
will rise to the surface again immediately after. 
  [Gentili] Federalism? 
  [Bossi] Sure. We shall bring the issue up as soon as the 
government has been formed. 
  [Gentili] But Berlusconi is lukewarm, not to say cool.... 
  [Bossi] He is playing his hand, and I am playing mine. But 
the federalist change will come about. You can bet on that.

  [Text] The Northern League has said that if its own man is 
not appointed to the post of interior minister, it will pull out 
of the government. The statement was made by Roberto Maroni 
from the Northern League a few hours before a scheduled meeting 
of the Freedom Alliance. 
  The League considers the Interior Ministry as its "bottom 
line." "We do not have to show why we want this particular 
ministry, our demand is a legitimate one. It is up to the 
others to explain to us why our demand is not legitimate," 
Maroni said. "If the others cannot give us an adequate 
explanation, then I do not think there is much point in talking, 
because it means they do not trust us in government. If this is 
the case, I do not see why we should be part of the government."

<F P=106> [Interview with Gianfranco Fini, Italian National Alliance </F>
leader, by Carlo Fusi; place and date not given: "Fini: `So 
Much Arrogance Against Us'" -- first paragraph is IL MESSAGGERO 
introduction] 
  [Text] Rome -- "I wonder how many of these arrogant 
gentlemen have read our programs or know that we call ourselves 
post-fascists." Gianfranco Fini opened his umbrella (or, 
rather, his parasol, since he will be spending the weekend by 
the sea) to ward off the deluge of charges being leveled by 
politicians and the international press. He responded with the 
following attack: "Such a hullabaloo is the result of the 
propaganda of the left-wing parties, which are seizing the 
opportunity to gain more space in their respective countries." 
  [Fusi] Is it only propaganda? The [French] Socialist Rocard 
is even proposing a boycott.... 
  [Fini] Everyone knows that in Italy Rocard's remarks count 
for absolutely nothing. It is a polemic that serves only 
election campaign interests. France too will be voting in the 
European elections.... 
  [Fusi] Pardon me, Mr. Fini, but are you not worried about 
the 
negative image that this is earning Italy? 
  [Fini] It is not true that there are negative reactions 
abroad. What is going on is the result of left-wing activists. 
  [Fusi] Is the NEW YORK TIMES a left-wing activist, too? 
  [Fini] No, in that instance, it is a question of 
misinformation and superficiality, the result of intellectual 
laziness. They have a view of Italy that does not correspond to 
the present situation. 
  [Fusi] So will the alarm over "the fascist ministers" have 
no 
repercussions abroad? 
  [Fini] The governments are not worried about it, nor do they 
have any reason to be. It is enough to wait for a few weeks in 
order to dispel any uncertainties. One of the new Italian 
Government's first tasks will be the G-7 meeting. On that 
occasion it will be clear to everyone that the positive 
evaluation of Italy will not suffer any threats because our 
country will not veer away from the options already adopted in 
the international context, nor will it fail to honor its 
pledges. And it will also be clear that the National Alliance 
ministers will not carry out any action that could modify 
Italy's positive international image. 
  [Fusi] You are trying to play matters down, but the anxiety 
remains. 
  [Fini] I am not worried. It is a campaign which will soon 
die down, precisely on the basis of the actions taken by 
Berlusconi or his various individual ministers. Be that as it 
may, I will soon be touring Europe's capitals to explain who the 
National Alliance is and what it wants. 
  [Fusi] Will that be enough? 
  [Fini] In Strasbourg [European Parliament] we will not join 
the far-right groups. As everyone knows, we are not allies of 
[French National Front leader] Le Pen, and we will continue on 
that path. 
  [Fusi] The anxiety is not confined to other countries. Some 
people maintain that the president too suggested not including 
MSI [Italian Social Movement], but only National Alliance 
ministers in the government.... 
  [Fini] Nonsense. There have been no vetoes, nor could there 
be any. The president is the guarantor of the Constitution, and 
the Constitution does not prohibit any individuals from becoming 
a minister. The only guarantee with regard to the ministers 
must be provided by the prime minister -- first and foremost, 
concerning the ethics of the individuals chosen, and also 
concerning their belief in democracy and freedom. But these 
principles apply to all future ministers, not only those of the 
National Alliance. 
  [Fusi] The fact remains that it is Scalfaro who must sign 
the 
ministerial appointment decrees. 
  [Fini] I repeat: There will be no problems, nor could there 
be any. 
  [Fusi] What do you think of [Chief Prosecutor] Borrelli's 
decision to remain in charge of the corruption investigation 
panel? 
  [Fini] He was quite right. It seems clear to me that he is 
trying to keep the panel united. 
  [Fusi] What about [Judge] Di Pietro, who has denied that he 
wants to become minister of the interior? 
  [Fini] I have already said that I would welcome Di Pietro as 
interior minister. This, even though I believe that his chances 
have faded now. 
  [Fusi] Mr. Buontempo takes issue with you. Does that not 
worry you either? 
  [Fini] Teodoro is contrary by nature. He is the only one who 
is worried, and I am pleased to leave him to his worries. I 
have always said that the National Alliance is a confederation 
of several members, and one of these is the MSI. Buontempo's 
fears are exaggerated and obsolete. 
  [Fusi] So is there no right-wing fringe on the MSI side? 
  [Fini] If it does exist, I will take note of it. But it 
certainly cannot influence me. I will not turn back: The 
option for the National Alliance is definitive, and will become 
increasingly so. We will contest the European elections with 
that symbol and of 87 candidates only 45 are MSI members. In 
any case, this is the only possible way.

  [Text] Rome, May 2 KYODO -- Japan's new Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata arrived in Rome on Monday [2 May] night, kicking 
off a series of official visits to Italy, France, Germany and 
Belgium. 
  Hata's trip, which comes less than a week after he became 
prime minister, is intended to forge personal ties with European 
leaders ahead of the July summit in Naples, Italy, of the Group 
of Seven (G- 7) major industrialized nations, Foreign Ministry 
officials said. 
  In Rome, Hata will hold talks Tuesday with Italy's outgoing 
Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi and Prime Minister-designate 
Silvio Berlusconi. Italy currently chairs the G-7 process. 
  On a flight from Tokyo, Hata told reporters Japan wants to 
strengthen relations with Italy and other members of the 
European Union. 
  A planned meeting with Pope John Paul II was canceled due to 
the pope's leg injury. 
  The trip was originally scheduled for January by then Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, but was postponed due to the 
volatile domestic political scene.

  [Text] Rome, May 3 KYODO -- Japanese Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata told Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro on 
Tuesday [3 May] that Tokyo wants to strengthen and expand its 
ties with Europe. 
  Hata told Scalfaro that Japan needs to make important 
contributions to the international community, and hopes to 
promote cooperation with European nations knowledgeable and 
experienced in affairs in Africa, the Middle East and East 
Europe. 
  During the 45-minute meeting, the Italian head of state 
asked 
about the future prospect of economic relations between Japan 
and the United States, the world's two largest economic powers, 
saying the relationship will affect many other countries. 
  The prime minister expressed hope to settle a bilateral 
impasse over trade "framework" talks at an early date, the 
officials said. 
  Hata assured Scalfaro that the outcome of talks between 
Japan 
and the United States will apply to any other country. 
  Hata's predecessor, Morihiro Hosokawa, and President Bill 
Clinton failed in their February summit in Washington to strike 
a deal on a new framework to slash Japan's trade surplus and 
increase its share of imports. Talks have not been resumed. 
  Hata arrived in Rome Monday night, kicking off a series of 
official visits to Italy, France, Germany and Belgium. 
  Hata's trip, less than a week into his post as prime 
minister, is aimed at forging personal ties with leaders before 
the July summit of he Group of Seven (G-7) major industrialized 
nations, in Naples, Japanese Foreign Ministry officials said.

  [Text] Rome, May 4 KYODO -- Japanese Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata pledged to Italian Prime Minister-Designate Silvio 
Berlusconi Tuesday [3 May] night that Japan will continue to 
make efforts to open up its market, Japanese officials said. 
  "A little brightness has been visible in the Japanese 
economy. We are making efforts to make Japan's market open to 
the international community," Hata was quoted as saying. 
  The Japanese prime minister said he wants to deepen 
exchanges 
with Italy in politics, the economy, science and culture, the 
officials said. 
  During a 45-minute meeting, Berlusconi replied that his 
country also shares similar problems and when he assumes the 
post of prime minister, Italy's economy will be strengthened and 
it can make a fresh start, the officials said. 
  Berlusconi, appointed prime minister-designate last week, 
said he is looking forward to working with Hata at the July 
summit of the Group of Seven (G-7) major economic powers in 
Naples. 
  Earlier in the day, Hata met departing Prime Minister 
Azeglio 
Ciampi for two and a half hours. 
  Hata and Ciampi agreed that strengthening cooperation on 
political problems between Russia and the G-7, revitalization of 
the world economy, and assistance to African countries and other 
developing nations will top the agenda at the Naples summit, the 
officials said. 
  Ciampi said, "in the summit meeting, we would like to 
discuss 
strengthening cooperation on political issues between the G-7 
and Russia. We also want to discuss relations between North and 
South, and assistance to developing nations." 
  Hata reportedly replied that summit meetings of the G-7 will 
assume new importance in a new era and praised Italy's role. 
  The Japanese prime minister said it is important to extend 
aid to developing countries, and Middle East and East Europe. 
  Hata, who was elected prime minister last Monday, arrived in 
Rome on Monday night, kicking off a series of official visits to 
Italy, France, Germany and Belgium. 
  Hata's trip is aimed at forging personal ties with leaders 
before the July summit of the G-7.

  [Text] Chancellor Helmut Kohl is visiting Italy. He was to 
have been received in the Vatican by Pope John Paul II, but 
because of the Pope's accident, he was received by the Vatican's 
head of state, Cardinal Angelo Sodano. Kohl gave an interview 
to Paolo Borrella. 
  [Begin recording] [Borrella] Is the destiny of Germany still 
that of a united Europe, as you said at the time of 
reunification? 
  [Kohl, in German with superimposed Italian translation] 
Adenauer said in 1950 that the reunification of Germany and the 
unification of Europe were two sides of the same coin. If the 
German people who received this gift of reunification now 
concentrate only on themselves, then they would not be worthy of 
this historic duty. We need European unity just as much as the 
air that we breathe. In the 21st century there will be neither 
peace nor liberty for the European people unless we pursue and 
realize this ideal. However, we are already on the right road. 
We are not forgetting the others. There are millions of human 
beings in the Balkans who are waiting for our help, and there 
are billions of people in the third world who are also waiting 
for our help. It is a duty that we must not shirk. [end

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Signs at Moncloa: Gonzalez </F>
Resignation May Be in Pipeline"] 
  [Excerpts] Several government and Socialist leaders held 
talks yesterday with [Prime Minister] Felipe Gonzalez, both in 
person and over the phone, to discuss the serious crisis 
engulfing the executive over the corruption cases and the 
disappearance of Luis Roldan. In official circles clear signs 
are beginning to emerge that preparations are under way for the 
head of government's resignation, despite his refusal to leave 
office. [Deputy Prime Minister] Narcis Serra is tipped as the 
most likely candidate to succeed Gonzalez, although there also 
is talk of a certain autonomous region president. 
  Apart from the current deputy prime minister, rumors in 
Socialist circles maintain that the current president of the 
Valencia Generalidad also aspires to lead the government if 
Gonzalez steps down. 
  Gonzalez insists on continuing to lead the executive, 
despite 
all the scandals, but murmurs from within his own party 
suggesting he resign are gathering force. Guerristas [followers 
of Spanish Socialist Workers Party (PSOE) Deputy Secretary 
Alfonso Guerra] like La Coruna Mayor Francisco Vazques have 
begun to speculate that only resignations can defuse the present 
situation and that the resignation of the PSOE secretary general 
cannot be ruled out because the institutions and his own party 
are above him. 
  The government crisis could cost Felipe Gonzalez his job if 
[Convergence and Union (CiU) leader] Jordi Pujol carries out the 
threat he made yesterday when he warned that his 17 deputies 
could withdraw their support from the Socialist leader if he 
does not clean up his cabinet and his party. The executive has 
decided to postpone the appearance of [outgoing Interior 
Minister] Antonio [as published] Asuncion before parliament 
until Tuesday, and the possibility that Gonzalez himself will 
face the Chamber of Deputies, as the People's Party has 
demanded, depends on how far the CiU supports the initiative, 
since the IU [United Left] has already demanded the same thing. 
  The CiU has called for the resignation from their current 
posts of former Interior Ministers Jose Barrionuevo and Jose 
Luis Corcuera, and of Socialist floor leader Carlos Solchaga, as 
well as a sweeping government reshuffle, all essential 
preconditions if it is to continue to support the executive. 
  Jose Duran Lleida, chairman of the CiU's government 
committee, announced this decision on behalf of the Nationalist 
coalition, which supports the PSOE-led government. He stressed 
that, if these measures are not implemented immediately, it will 
be Felipe Gonzalez himself who has to resign. Although he was 
speaking in his own party's name, the speech had received the 
approval of Generalidad President Jordi Pujol only moments 
earlier. 
  Duran Lleida confirmed that the CiU no longer has "any 
commitment" toward the government, since the governability to 
which the Catalan Nationalists aspired to contribute has been 
destroyed by the PSOE itself, the party solely responsible for 
the present state of affairs. He repeated that the CiU has no 
desire for early elections, but he warned that the instability 
it has sought to avoid with fresh elections was already a 
reality right now, so that all paths are open as we wait to see 
whether Felipe Gonzalez can show that he is able to bring the 
situation back under control. In that sense, he said, if 
Gonzalez does not firmly establish political responsibility for 
the Roldan and Rubio cases within 15 days, he himself will have 
to resign. [passage omitted] 
  The government yesterday decided to postpone for 24 hours 
Asuncion's planned appearance before parliament's Internal 
Affairs Commission. He was originally summoned to appear today, 
to explain Roldan's flight and the reasons behind his 
resignation. Although opposition circles suspect that this is 
simply a move to gain time, as the security forces are thought 
to have come up with some clues as to the fugitive's 
whereabouts, government circles blame the People's Party for the 
postponement. 
  Assistant People's Party spokesman Loyola de Palacio denied 
that his party was obstructing Asuncion's appearance before the 
committee and insisted that Felipe Gonzalez appear before the 
Chamber of Deputies to explain the situation.

  [Text] [Announcer] Good evening. It's Angeles Bazan here. 
Once more the Luis Roldan case will take up most of our 
half-hour program of news and current affairs. The government 
will appear before the plenum of the Congress of Deputies 
Wednesday [11 May] next week. Over the last few hours some 
political parties have made sure that the appeal for 
explanations has become a real outcry. 
  There are ever more people asking for Felipe Gonzalez to 
explain to the public the current social and political upheaval. 
  The government has decided to respond to the request for an 
appearance. It will be next Wednesday at 1600. However, it is 
still not known whether Felipe Gonzalez himself will give 
explanations to the chamber. 
  Meanwhile the search for Luis Roldan continues, and no one 
knows where he is. Today new alleged irregularities came to 
light. On the one hand it emerged that he took 60 million 
pesetas of the School for Orphans of the Civil Guard and on the 
other hand, his 1992 tax return has been made public, for which 
the Treasury had to give him more than 3 million pesetas. 
  The minister of economics and finance has said that Roldan 
was being investigated before he stepped down, but he did not 
say what the result of the investigation was.

  [Text] A third safe house belonging to Basque Fatherland 
and Liberty [ETA] has been found by the police in Barcelona. 
There were neither arms nor explosives in the apartment, 
because it was used as a hiding place for the members of the 
commando acting in Barcelona. 
  Meanwhile, in Zaragoza this evening bomb disposal experts of 
the security forces set off a car bomb. Over to our studios in 
Zaragoza, Manuel Segura, good evening. 
  [Segura] Good evening. Toward 1745 bomb disposal experts 
belonging to the police force blew up a suspicious car parked 
near the crossing of the streets Escoriaza y Fabra and Santander 
in Zaragoza, near the Portillo railway station. 
  The car was a white Renault 5 with Barcelona number plate 
6095 MD. Police believe that it might be the car in which two 
women were seen with Felipe San Epifanio, alias Pipe, head of 
ETA's Barcelona commando.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Prime Minister Esko Aho by Per </F>
Nordrum in Helsinki; date not given] 
  [Text] Helsinki -- European Union [EU] membership means 
that all four applicant countries must approve the agreements, 
in the view of Finnish Prime Minister Esko Aho. The EU will not 
produce any differences for agriculture. 
  The structural rationalization of agriculture will continue, 
regardless of Finland's relationship to the EU. "It is difficult 
to say how rapidly changes will take place if we were to remain 
outside the EU, but I do not think that the difference would 
amount to much," Prime Minister Esko Aho said. 
  The Center Party leader, who will soon reach age 40, said 
that it is difficult to say how many farms will remain in 
Finland in the event of EU membership. For we do not know what 
will happen to national agricultural policy in the future. 
  "But I remember very well what has happened since 1970. Then 
we had around 200,000 milk producers. Today we have perhaps 
40,000. We have in other words had drastic structural changes, 
and I believe that this will continue if Finland joins the EU," 
Aho said in an interview with a group of Norwegian journalists 
on the third anniversary of assuming the office of prime 
minister. 
  The date of the Finnish referendum on the EU has yet to be 
fixed. Most people are thinking along the lines of 2 October, 
even though the prime minister says that he has not receive any 
negative responses to his question of why Finland should not 
hold its referendum on the same day as Sweden -- 13 November. 
  "We have our practical reasons to think about the same date 
as Sweden," the prime minister said, without providing any more 
detailed explanation. 
  The government in Helsinki will reach a decision on the date 
for a referendum once the European Parliament has dealt with the 
membership agreements on 4 May and once the national support 
package for the foodstuffs industry and sections of agriculture 
are complete. This support package is to complement the EU 
agreement on points where Finland did not achieve the goals laid 
down when the Eduskunta approved Finland's membership 
application. 
  If the support package is satisfactory, the prime minister 
also feels sure that this will be a majority in favor of the EU 
at the Center Party's national congress in June. Center Party 
leader Anne Enger Lahnstein, Norway's "no" queen, is also 
expected, among the almost 3,000 delegates and 2,000 guests. 
  Could Finland be the only Nordic country to join the EU? 
  "In principle that is not impossible, but in practice it 
would be another matter if only one or two countries out of the 
four ratify the agreements. I am also looking at this from the 
EU's point of view. There is only one alternative when it comes 
to the date for becoming a member. So everyone who wants to 
join must ratify the agreement before them." 
  Prime Minister Aho made it clear that Finland will naturally 
take into consideration the decisions its Nordic neighbors 
reach, "even though it is in principle our own decision." A 
Swedish no to the EU would create a new situation, he admitted. 
Nevertheless, he declined to speculate about how his government 
would handle such a situation. "Our assumption is that all four 
countries will accept the agreements," he stressed. 
  If only Norway says no to membership, will there then be 
problems for the other three countries that want to become EU 
members? 
  "Much will depend on Sweden, for Sweden will be the biggest 
net contributor to the EU. Sweden's role is therefore more 
important than those of Finland or Norway," said Aho, who also 
believes that the so-called Zhirinovskiy effect means much less 
than many people believe for the Finns' desire for EU membership. 
  In the past the Finnish Center Party's leading bodies have 
given positive assessments of the EU agreement even though, 
according to the opinion polls, the majority of the party's 
voters are in the no camp. When Prime Minister Aho last weekend 
left a party meeting to celebrate his mother's 70th birthday, 
Paavo Vayrynen, his former foreign minister, took the floor and 
succeeded in a maneuver to bring in some new and more critical 
assessments. 
  "There is no suggestion of substantial change of view of any 
significance. I would also have approved this assessment of 
his," Aho said, trying to smooth over the internal conflict in 
the Center Party. 
  What is most important among your political priorities -- 
getting Finland into the EU or winning the election in March 
next year? 
  "If we do not succeed in dealing with our economic problems, 
we cannot even take on the challenge EU membership would 
represent. If I can deal successfully with these two things -- 
improving the economy and Finns' living conditions, and EU 
membership -- I would probably also do quite well in the next 
Eduskunta elections. I have no reason to prepare myself for an 
election defeat," the prime minister said, well aware that the 
opinion polls are now giving the Center Party only 19 percent of 
votes -- as against 24.8 percent in the elections three years 
ago. But behind him he has fresh economic figures which show 
that unemployment, currently at over 20 percent, is beginning to 
fall.

<F P=106> [Seppo Saastamoinen report: "Kaariainen Seeks New Trading </F>
Rules"] 
  [Text] Trade and Industry Minister Seppo Kaariainen 
(Center) is leaving today for Moscow for a meeting of the 
chairmen of the Finnish-Russian Commission of Economic 
Cooperation. His main objective will be to clear up the rules 
for trading between Russia and Finland. Kaariainen thinks that 
the rules need to be revised with regard to fiscal issues, 
including the recent unexpected road-toll problems. "We hope, 
of course, that the Russians will come up with solutions to 
these problems as quickly as possible, and I have no reason to 
doubt their goodwill in this respect. But we also have to be 
realistic with regard to the timetable," Kaariainen said. 
  Kaariainen will carry out an initial review of his 
objectives 
with his Russian counterpart, Foreign Economic Relations 
Minister Oleg Davydov, Kaariainen's opposite number as head of 
the Russian delegation to the economic commission, while 
Kaariainen leads the Finnish one. Today's meeting between the 
two chairmen will be brief and formal, but it has been long 
expected. The work of the economic commission has been at a 
standstill for more than a year due to the inability of the 
Russians to appoint a chairman for their delegation. Following 
Davidov's appointment to the chairmanship it is now believed 
that the economic commission will be able to resume its work. 
One of the objectives of the meeting between the chairmen will 
be to prepare the commission's next session. 
  "The most essential thing, of course, is that the two 
chairmen of the commission are now able to meet after a long 
pause. This shows that there is a will on the part of the 
politicians and authorities in both countries to stimulate the 
expanding trade," Kaariainen added. Kaariainen's positive 
expectations are also understandable considering that today's 
meeting can be held in spite of Davidov's various other 
commitments. It was still uncertain on Monday [25 April] 
morning whether Davidov would be home in time for Thursday after 
his long foreign tour. 
  The official agenda of the chairmens' meeting includes 
topics 
such as financing trade and transportation plus the specific 
company projects discussed during Russian Prime Minister 
Chernomyrdin's trip to Finland in March. "I am now going to 
review progress on these specific issues," Kaariainen said. The 
topics discussed during Chernomyrdin's visit included projects 
put forward by Metra, Outokumpu, and Rautaruukki. 
  Kaariainen's visit to Moscow will not, however, involve 
anybody from these or any other enterprises. TT [expansion 
unknown] President Georg Ehrnroth will perform the function of 
joint chairman representing these companies. The chairmen are 
also expected to fix a date for the commission's next meeting, 
to be held in Helsinki. Kaariainen thinks that it may take place 
before midsummer.

  [Text] Defense Minister Datuk Najib Abdul Razak has signed 
a memorandum of understanding with Sweden on military 
cooperation in Stockholm. He said Sweden had pledged to 
encourage its private companies to form joint ventures with 
Malaysian companies in the defense industry. 
  The memorandum of understanding with Sweden is significant 
as 
Malaysia is planning a major upgrading of its naval forces, 
including the replacement of obsolete patrol vessels with new 
ones. The Navy is said to require 27 oceangoing patrol vessels. 
He also discussed with Swedish officials on possible purchase 
of submarines. 
  Today, Datuk Najib Abdul Razak will have a tight schedule in 
Croatia, which would be his last leg of his seven-day visit of 
the European countries.

<F P=106> [Article by Claes von Hofsten: "Bank Supposed To Finance </F>
Purchase of Weapons; Two Swedes Charged With 400 Million 
(Kronor) Swindle of the Handelsbank"] 
  [Text] Two Swedes have been charged in an international 
swindling case aimed at financing Serbian weapons purchases. By 
luck, and despite a clever plot against the bank, the 
Handelsbank avoided becoming the guarantor of purchases worth 
400 million kronor [SKr]. 
  The head of a Swedish bank may almost have seen his career 
go 
down the drain because of the attempted plot. One Swedish lawyer 
left the case after a remarkable photographic exhibition. 
  Exactly how the plot was put together and who was supposed 
to 
be duped into financing the purchase of weapons for the war in 
the former Yugoslavia was not made clear in the criminal report 
that was submitted to Stockholm city court. 
<H5>  Bank Guarantee the Core </H5>
  The core of the case is a bank guarantee, called a standby 
letter of credit, in the amount of $50 million. The Handelsbank 
drew up the check. 
  However, the Swedish police report showed that the contents 
of the bank guarantee were a forgery though the form on which it 
was drawn up was genuine. 
  "It's indeed possible they had some sort of inside help," 
said Gunnel Skeppholm, the district prosecutor. 
<H5>  Serbian Account </H5>
  On 24 August last year, the bank guarantee was presented to 
a 
bank in London. The bank's task was to verify the guarantee, 
i.e., assure the international businessmen present that the 
Swedish bank guarantee was genuine. That in turn was supposed to 
be the green light for a series of transactions. In the end, 
SKr320 million were supposed to have ended up in a Serbian 
account in Switzerland. 
  The date on which the London bank was supposed to have made 
the contact was obviously not chosen at random. On precisely 
that day, it had long since been decided that the top official 
at the Handelsbank, the one who appeared to have signed the 
guarantee, would be out sailing in the Stockholm archipelago 
with some of the bank's major clients. 
  Prosecutor Skeppholm assumes that the intent was for someone 
else to have attested to the top official's connection and given 
his "okay" regarding the propriety of the guarantee when the 
London bank telephoned. 
  However, the London bank first telephoned the day after. 
Then 
the top official was at work. The swindle thus ground to a halt. 
<H5>  Royal Family </H5>
  It is the two Swedes who traveled to London with the bank 
guarantee who have now been charged in Stockholm. They are 38 
and 39 years old. One of them was earlier sentenced to five 
years in prison for robbery. Both had formerly been convicted of 
grand larceny. One of them was very falsely introduced in London 
to the foreign businessmen as being a member of the Swedish 
royal family. 
  The Swedes were first taken into custody in the late fall. 
At 
that time the police report was mainly directed at figuring out 
the origin of the bank guarantee. One of the men charged said he 
had a contact at the bank who was behind the attempted swindle 
but would not reveal who this contact was. 
  "At a later remand hearing he was shown a photographic 
collage containing a total of 28 pictures on the judge's bench. 
He immediately pointed to the person he claimed was the 
contact," Skeppholm said. 
  The person he pointed to was the chief officer at the 
Handelsbank whose signature or at the very least a signature 
very like his appeared on the bank guarantee. 
  "When you're a prosecutor you react in two ways when there's 
such a quick identification. In part you wonder how it can 
happen so quickly and so totally without doubt. In part you 
wonder whether this is really the way it is." 
  So prosecutor Skeppholm suspected there was something 
suspicious and prepared a special report relating to just this 
subject. It turned out that earlier in the autumn the partner's 
lawyer had bought a passport picture of the bank's current chief 
from the files of the national police administration. 
  "My goal was to ask the suspect for information about what 
his contact looked like so I could compare that with a 
photograph of how the bank employee looked," the lawyer 
explained in the criminal report. 
<H5>  Easy To Smear </H5>
  Yet the lawyer insisted that he had never shown the passport 
photograph he had bought around. The lawyer has since 
voluntarily resigned from the case. 
  "What jolted me somewhat in this case was how someone can 
get 
smeared this way. It really can hit anyone," said Skeppholm 
about the fix the bank employee has gotten into. 
  The bank employee should take a certain degree of comfort 
from the charge that, in addition to attempted grand larceny by 
means of forged documents also includes misleading allegations. 
  The accused men deny having committed a crime. They thought 
they were taking part in a legal transaction in which their 
commission for arranging the bank guarantee was to have been 
0.25 percent, i.e., SKr1 million. 
  The men have further been charged with attempted grand 
larceny using counterfeit cashier's checks worth SKr8 million, 
but that is an entirely different matter.

  [Excerpts] Now we will talk about the continuing conflict 
between Greece and the other European Union [EU] countries. 
That is unfortunate, Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes said 
today. He is in Stockholm because of the continuing state visit 
here of the Belgian royal couple. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent Lars Gunnar Erlandson] Willy Claes is in 
Stockholm in connection with the state visit to Sweden of the 
new Belgian royal couple. King Albert and Queen Paola and the 
Swedish royal couple drove in horse-drawn carriages across sunny 
Stockholm today. The foreign minister had talks with his 
Swedish colleague Margaretha af Ugglas. The talks concerned, 
among other things, the formal voting at the EU parliament 
tomorrow. Willy Claes reassured the possibly nervous members of 
the Swedish Government: Everything points towards the fact that 
the four countries seeking membership will be accepted, the 
Belgian foreign minister said. Margaretha af Ugglas took the 
opportunity to persuade Belgium, an EU country, that Sweden with 
its considerable contribution of troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
should also be allowed to take a little more part in 
decisionmaking when decisions are made by the superpowers and 
the EU.

<F P=106> [Interview with European Affairs Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel by </F>
Catherine Bernard in Stockholm; date not given: "Sweden Opposes 
Notion of `Scandinavian Bloc' Within European Union"] 
  [Text] [Bernard] What do you think will be the outcome of 
the European Parliament's vote [on the enlargement agreement] on 
Wednesday [4 May]? 
  [Dinkelspiel] There is no doubt that a majority of Euro-MP's 
[members of the European Parliament] are in favor of 
enlargement. What is somewhat worrying me is that MP's might not 
reach the quorum to produce the required absolute majority. 
However, according to information in our possession, the 
outlook seems good. 
  [Bernard] What would happen should the vote turn out 
negative? 
  [Dinkelspiel] The whole enlargement process would be frozen. 
To be sure, the new Parliament would have the option of picking 
up the issue in the fall. But should enlargement be rejected 
this week, it would be because of institutional quarrels, and I 
cannot imagine how the issue could be settled within six months. 
  [Bernard] Which changes would Sweden like to see implemented 
in European Union [EU] institutions within the scope of the 1996 
revision of the Maastricht treaty? 
  [Dinkelspiel] I do not think that it is very polite to 
discuss a club's statutes even before becoming a member. 
Anyway, it was made clear from the start that enlargement would 
take place according to the regulations currently in force. 
However, an EU enlargement to 20 to 25 members will require 
reforms, which smaller countries are especially interested in. 
The EU cannot have 30 commissioners, and its Parliament cannot 
consist of 1,000 members. 
  [Bernard] Is it possible to simplify decisionmaking 
processes without decreasing the influence of smaller countries? 
  [Dinkelspiel] I for one am not a federalist. But in a 
number of areas, such as the environment, I would prefer that 
decisions be made by simple majority rather than unanimity. 
  [Bernard] Will the Scandinavian "bloc," i.e., Sweden, 
Finland, Norway, and Denmark, attempt to steer the EU in a 
particular direction? 
  [Dinkelspiel] I do not think we will act as a bloc. The 
Spanish foreign minister recently noted that Spain's voting 
record at the United Nations has been closer to that of Sweden 
than that of other European countries. On the other hand, 
Scandinavian countries do have common values that they will 
uphold, such as environmental protection, social security, 
equality between sexes, and free trade. In the short term, I 
believe that the EU has a major role to play in two areas: the 
fight against unemployment and peacekeeping. 
  [Bernard] Swedish public opinion, however, seems as yet not 
convinced of this. A majority remains opposed to EU membership. 
How do you plan to change their mind before the referendum, 
which is scheduled for November? 
  [Dinkelspiel] First of all, we need to challenge a number of 
myths, such as the one that says we would be compelled to enter 
into a military union. But we also must go beyond the purely 
economic debate that has been dominant so far. Here, a crucial 
factor is the attitude of the left (social democrats), which 
must be more openly pro-European so that EU membership does not 
look like the right's pet project. 
  [Bernard] Do you think the referendum's outcome will be 
positive? 
  [Dinkelspiel] It is not going to be easy. Each and every 
supporter of EU membership will have to rise to the fight. But 
I do believe Sweden will say yes in the end.

<F P=106> [Dick Ljungberg report: "Social Democrats Have Majority </F>
Alone"] 
  [Excerpt] Only four parties have managed to stay above the 
4-percent threshold for representation in the Riksdag in DAGENS 
NYHETER/Temo's poll for April. Some four and a half months 
before the election the government parties show little sign of 
shrinking the Social Democrats' large lead. 
  The Social Democrats can celebrate May Day with 51 percent 
of 
voters behind them. For the Christian Democratic Party and the 
Left Party spring celebrations will be more gloomy; they have 
fallen below the representation threshold below which New 
Democracy and the Green Party are already languishing. 
  Will the government be able to win the race? At the same 
point before the 1991 election the Social Democrats' gains in 
the lead-up to the election had not yet begun to register in the 
Temo poll. In April 1991 they had a record-low score of 26.6 
percent. In the September election their result was 37.7 
percent -- Ingvar Carlsson did not quite make it all the way to 
the finish line. 
  The parties of the nonsocialist government currently have 
40-percent support between them. In the four previous polls 
they achieved figures of 38.5, 38.0, 38.0, 37.0 percent. If 
this is an upward trend, it is a very slow one. 
  But Swedish voters are choosing which party to vote for at 
an 
ever later stage of election campaigns. The 18 September 
election will be a thriller, where the question of who governs 
will be decided by the four parties struggling around the 
4-percent representation threshold. 
  The Temo poll was carried out in the period 20-27 April and 
comprises 1,014 interviews. These were carried out by 
telephone, and this is the first poll using this method that has 
been published. However, since November Temo has been 
conducting telephone interviews in parallel with interviews 
carried out during visits to homes. The comparison figures 
[with March] given here apply to the telephone method. 
  The results for April with the changes over March in 
parentheses: 
  Moderate Coalition Party 21.5 percent (no change), Liberal 
Party 7.5 (+\0.5), Center Party 7.5 (+\1.5). Christian 
Democratic Party 3.5 (-\0.5), Social Democratic Party 51.0 
(-\0.5), Left Party 3.5 (-\0.5), New Democracy 2.0 (-\0.5), 
Green Party 3.0 (no change), and other parties 0.5 percent (no 
change). [passage omitted]

enjoyed the prospect of at least 10 years' profitable 
production. Instead, the AK5 seems to have become a flop. The 
Armed Forces have been sending a steady flow of complaints to 
Bofors for seven years. Today will see the start of warranty 
negotiations, which may cost Bofors SKr100 million. This has 
been a blow to the quality images of Bofors and Carl Gustaf AB, 
and there will also be consequences for the Swedish defense 
establishment. With depots full of defective weapons, Sweden's 
military preparedness is far from what it could have been. 
  Carl Gustaf AB (formerly Gevaersfaktoriet) is a subsidiary 
of 
Bofors, which in its turn belongs to the listed Celsius group. 
Bofors has worked intensely for a couple of years to eliminate 
its quality problems, but apparently to no avail. According to 
field reports the rate of faults seems to be getting higher 
rather than lower. 
  The Materials Administration (FMV) of the Armed Forces has 
now had enough. Final warranty negotiations concerning the AK5 
will start on Thursday [5 May]. By 1 June at the latest, the 
parties will have sorted out the responsibities for the faults 
and their payment. Defense professionals have known for a long 
time that the AK5, the Swedish soldier's standard-issue weapon, 
is not up to the mark. The fact that the problems have been kept 
within the family is perhaps an indication of the degree of 
loyalty shown in this case. If Swedish weapons do not work, it 
is best that the world outside should not be aware of it. But 
this has caused an even worse storm behind the military scenes. 
The complaints and failure reports that keep piling up express 
a suppressed fury about the low quality of the material. The 
catalogue of defects in the AK5 will soon be as long as the 
spare-parts list. And these are no mere trivial faults. Many of 
them are classified as security risks, e.g., cocks that break 
and weapons in which the safety catch goes off by itself. There 
were other faults, particularly embarrasing to the supplier, 
such as parts manufactured to incorrect dimensions and a paint 
work so poor that the weapons have to be repainted. 
  Problems have dogged the AK5 ever since 1987, when Carl 
Gustaf AB in Eskilstuna delivered the first units of this 
license-manufactured automatic carbine of Belgian origin. Here 
are some samples of the reports: Several faults were found 
after only one year. As a result, 40,000 weapons were returned 
to Bofors to be modified on seven points. In February 1992 
broken cocks were reported on 20 percent of the guns. The 
deliveries were stopped following rejection of the results from 
wearing-in firing tests. In April 1992 the FMV complained that 
the AK5's failure rate was abnormally high and involved safety 
risks. In January 1993 the Naval Forces reported that the oil 
box was cracked on every fourth weapon. In the spring of 1993, 
Swedish UN soldiers in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic 
of Macedonia -- FYROM] were issued with weapons that did not 
function. There were great risks of accidental shots, the 
cartridge clips had to be changed. In February 1993 the Army 
Infantry and Cavalry Center in Borensberg reported several cases 
when the weapons had cocked spontaneously, when carried on the 
back. 
  FMV ordered Bofors to stop deliveries on several occasions, 
while the faults were being corrected. Bofors reacted by 
implementing a thorough investigation on each new report of 
faults from the field, hoping that this would be the end of the 
problems. This included the ambulatory control of 764 weapons, 
reported two weeks ago. 
  But the problems are by no means over and done with. On the 
contrary, reports of faults continue to flow in. As late as 
March 1994, Marinkommando Syd reported that "the AK5's failure 
rate is on the increase in spite of all modifications." Up to 
85 percent of the weapons are said to be defective. And now, 
in the early days of spring, FMV authorities realized that 
nothing more could be achieved by investigations. It was time 
to settle the affair with the supplier. 
  Bofors has already poured millions into modifications and 
repairs and the manufacturing spare parts in parallel with other 
production. But this is only the beginning. Carl Gustaf AB 
delivers thousands of AK5 carbines to the units every month. 
The repairs can hardly keep pace with this tempo, so the number 
of defective weapons in the depots is increasing. 
  This, of course, is a source of concern to FMV Department 
Director Gunnar Engvall, who represents the state in this 
affair. The complaints regarding the AK5 are unlike anything he 
has ever seen before, either costwise or in terms of the 
prolonged agony. 
  But Gunnar Engvall is also careful not to give the 
impression 
that all the weapons are faulty and under repair in the depots. 
"If the rate of faults in a batch reaches a certain percentage, 
then a complaint must be put in for the whole batch," he added. 
On the eve of the negotiations, Gunnar Engvall is also cautious 
about specifying the exact negotiating position of the state. 
It will then be easier to calculate the cost of all the repairs 
and modifications of the AK5. "How costly this will be depends 
on the way the work is organized," he added. "If we decide to 
have the repairs carried out locally, the cost may be closer to 
SKr100 million." 
  This roughly equals Bofors' 1993 net profit after 
financing, i.e., SKr112 million. The company's turnover was 
SKr3.5 billion, of which more than 1 billion in exports. Carl 
Gustaf AB, which chalked up sales worth SKr263 million in 1992, 
achieved a profit of SKr76,000 after balance-sheet allocations. 
The company exports account for 10 to 20 percent of the sales 
figure, although no AK5 weapons are exported. The Celsius group 
achieved total sales worth SKr11.6 billion in 1993. The 
operating result was SKr348 million and the net result after 
financing was SKr721 million. 
  Bofors must pay, says Gunnar Engvall. "The supplier is 
responsible for the construction and thus also responsible for 
the defects of the product." His claim is supported by 
stipulations in the three contracts regulating the deal that 
include detailed specifications for dealing with faults and 
delays. 
  Why the long delay before clearing up the issues of 
responsibility? "We wanted to make use of the weapon's 
four-year warranty period to catch as many of the faults as 
possible. The faults have been reported to Bofors on a 
continuous basis. But after all investigations, it is now clear 
that we can not get any further." 
  The whole affair is painful to Bofors and Carl Gustaf AB. 
That a high-technology industry with a functioning quality 
control should let so many defective products through is 
unacceptable. Hitherto the supplier has been represented by 
Peter Bring, Carl Gustaf's marketing manager. He also 
represents Bofors in the warranty negotiations. "There have 
been too many problems," he said. But Peter Bring does not want 
to make any statements regarding responsibility so as not to 
forestall negotiations with FMV. 
  Have you learned anything from the problems? "Among other 
things, that this kind of a mass production requires quality 
supervision of the subsuppliers." Peter Bring is convinced that 
Bofors and FMV will reach a solution. They will not have to 
resort to the arbitration procedures defined in the agreement. 
  The main tasks for Bofors and Carl Gustaf AB will be to 
restore confidence in their quality control. Otherwise there 
may be problems, one of which is brewing already, namely a 
contract for the reconditioning of the older AK4 automatic 
carbine, which was earlier seen as earmarked for Carl Gustaf AB. 
It now seems that most of the job will go to the Armed Forces 
own workshops instead.

  [Text] President Rauf Denktas has sent a letter to UN 
Secretary General Butrus-Ghali explaining that he cannot 
possibly accept the amended confidence-building measures [CBM] 
package or have it approved by the people of the Turkish 
Republic of Northern Cyprus [TRNC]. Denktas sent a letter to 
the UN secretary general and reiterated the views of the Turkish 
Cypriot side regarding the CBM package. 
  Recalling that the Turkish Cypriot side is committed to the 
CBM package as it appeared in Butrus-Ghali's report of 1 July 
1993, Denktas expressed his hope that the balance between the 
risks and benefits that was upset in the package will be 
rectified through indirect talks. Stating that he is ready to 
continue with the negotiations and support Butrus-Ghali's 
goodwill mission, Denktas pointed out that having the road 
leading to Maras [Varosha] under UN control was not in the 
initial CBM package and is contrary to the assurances given to 
the Turkish Cypriot side by Butrus-Ghali and his representatives. 
  Denktas said that the Turkish Cypriot side is ready to 
provide the Greek Cypriots safe entry to Maras. Reiterating 
that the lack of trust between the two sides is the real reason 
for the Cyprus problem, Denktas added that the Turkish Cypriots 
would like the embargo imposed on the TRNC eased and the 
citizens of the TRNC given freedom of travel in exchange for the 
opening of the fenced area in Maras. 
  Explaining that he had the initial package approved by the 
Assembly after receiving assurances from the UN representatives 
that there will not be any amendments or additions, Denktas 
added that promises were made regarding the Greek and Turkish 
Cypriots' benefiting simultaneously from the implementation of 
the package. Stating that they were surprised when they were 
informed that items in the 27 March 1994 nondocument that did 
not exist in the original CBM package could not be changed 
later, Denktas stressed that items in Butrus-Ghali's report of 4 
April 1994 differed from those in the already accepted 1 July 
1993 document. 
  In the letter he sent to Butrus-Ghali, Denktas reiterated 
that the Turkish Cypriots are determined regarding the following 
four points: simultaneous benefits to both sides from the 
opening of the Maras and Lefkosa [Nicosia] Airports, air traffic 
arrangements for airplanes using Lefkosa Airport, the issue of 
customs duty at the Maras and Lefkosa Airports, and free access 
to the area between the UN-controlled region and the fenced area 
in Maras. 
  Denktas pointed out that the 11 March 1994 map, which shows 
the area that will be opened in Maras, differs from the 19 May 
1993 map that had been agreed on. Denktas stressed that in the 
wake of all these developments, it will be very difficult for 
him to accept the new package, which was changed by the United 
Nations, and have it approved by the people of the TRNC.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The United Nations and Cyprus"--punctuation as </F>
published] 
  [Text] The package of confidence-building measures has 
revealed that the UN organization acts with an ulterior motive 
against the Turkish Cypriot people. Those who know the history 
of Cyprus have not been surprised by that. After all, the UN 
organization has maintained its approach since 1964. 
  1. The package of proposals that UN representative Galo 
Plaza submitted in 1964 urged the Turkish Cypriots to "agree to 
enosis [union of Cyprus with Greece] in return for minority 
rights." We resisted the UN representative's ridiculous 
proposals and rejected them even when we were confronted with 
the threat of destruction. 
  2. The UN organization adopted a resolution to recognize the 
bloodthirsty and occupying Greek Cypriot administration as the 
legitimate government. We refused to accept that resolution at 
the time, that is, during the dark era in which bloodshed took 
place and Turkish Cypriots were killed throughout the island. 
  3. The UN organization failed to obstruct the Greek Cypriot 
attacks in 1963. It also failed to obstruct the attacks on 
Erenkoy [Kokkina] in 1964 and Gecitkale [Lefkoniko] and Bogazici 
[Lapathos] in 1967, the massacre of Turkish Cypriots in Turkeli 
[Ayios Vasilios], Taskent [Vouno], Atlilar [Aloa], Murataga 
[Maratha], and Sandallar [Sandalaris], the landing of 20,000 
Greek troops in Cyprus, the occupation of 97 percent of the 
island by them, and the fascist Greek junta administration's 
military coup on 15 July 1974, which aimed to achieve enosis. 
But the UN organization adopted a resolution condemning Turkey 
for the action it took on 20 July 1974 to obstruct enosis and 
the Greek Cypriot acts of massacre and ethnic cleansing 
operations against the Turkish Cypriots. It called on the 
Turkish troops to immediately withdraw from Cyprus. 
  We did not accept those resolutions at the time, that is, 
when we were in a weaker position and when confusion existed in 
Cyprus. We ignored them and moved in the direction we decided 
to go in. 
  4. The UN organization adopted several baseless resolutions 
after we declared our independence on 15 November 1983, 
resolutions that conflicted with international law. It called 
on us to withdraw our decision on independence and urged foreign 
countries not to recognize the Turkish Republic of Northern 
Cyprus [TRNC]. It threatened the Turkish Cypriot people and 
tried to blackmail them. But we advanced in the direction we 
chose to go, believing that the clock could not be put back and 
that we would continue to exist even if the state we established 
was not recognized. We maintained our position and reached the 
point we are at now... 
  5. It has been 10 years since we established our independent 
republic... 
  6. Our glorious flag, which is the symbol of our 
sovereignty, has remained hoisted... 
  7. We live in security and without fear and look to the 
future in hope... 
  We owe our today to our resistance of the unjust resolutions 
that were adopted by the guided organizations, such as the 
United Nations and other similar establishments, which have 
assumed the form of a Christian club and try to realize the 
expansionist objectives of the neocrusaders under the guise of 
"peace initiatives." 
  The staff officer of the neocrusaders, who heads the UN 
General Secretariat, has moved to threaten the Turkish Cypriots 
and to direct pressure on them again through the UN Security 
Council, which has been converted into the headquarters of the 
crusaders. We will maintain our resistance. We must. We have 
no alternative. We must resist injustice and remain steadfast. 
  Instead of concerning itself with Cyprus, which has enjoyed 
peace during the past 20 years, the UN organization should wage 
a struggle against the criminal Serbs, who are killing the 
Islamic people in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Instead of waging a 
struggle against the Turkish Cypriots, who have been deprived of 
their rights, subjected to an embargo, belittled, and isolated 
during the past 30 years, the UN organization should take steps 
to deal with the occupying Armenian terrorists, who have killed 
hundreds of thousands of innocent Azerbaijani people and forced 
1 million Azerbaijani citizens to become refugees in Daghlyk 
Karabakh... Instead of moving against Turkey, which established 
peace, democracy, security, and prosperity in Cyprus in three 
days, the UN organization should take measures against the 
aggressive Zionists, who shed blood and torture people in 
Palestine daily... 
  We know of Europe's plans to have Turkey besieged by the 
forces of the Orthodox religion. We also know of the plan to 
realize enosis through the UN organization. But we will not 
yield. We will maintain our resistance against those who have 
failed to halt the bloodshed in Bosnia, Azerbaijan, and 
Palestine and who secretly cooperate with the occupiers and 
murderers. 
  Regardless of the resolutions the United Nations may adopt 
against the Turkish Cypriot people, we are determined to 
maintain the TRNC's existence and refuse to accept the 
sovereignty of our sworn enemies. UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali and the UN Security Council must realize that...

  [Text] Shortly before leaving for Zurich from Ioannina, 
Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias expressed reserved optimism 
on the outcome of his meeting with his Albanian counterpart, 
Alfred Serreqi. He stressed: I am going to this meeting with 
open proposals and I hope that Albania will show it willingness 
to improve bilateral relations. 
  The Greek foreign minister said he will raise the issue of 
Albania releasing the arrested members of the Greek minority 
party Omonoia, who are being detained at Tirana prison. 
Papoulias added that the recent incidents in Tirana have cast a 
shadow on this meeting in Zurich, and as a gesture of goodwill 
the Albanian Government should have already released the 
prisoners. 
  Referring to the recent incident at the Episkopi border 
station, Papoulias reiterated that it would not be beneficial 
for the Albanian side to insist on its intransigent position. 
  The ATHENS NEWS AGENCY reported a short time ago that the 
meeting between Papoulias and Serreqi began at 1300 today [Greek 
time] in Zurich. The bulletin adds that Foreign Ministry 
Secretary General Ambassador Khristos Zakharakis and other 
officials participated in the meeting, which will deal with the 
entire spectrum of Greek-Albanian relations, particularly the 
issue of the oppressive measures adopted recently against the 
Greek minority.

  [Text] Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias and 
Albanian Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi described their meeting 
in Zurich today as positive. Papoulias said that Albania showed 
signs of goodwill but he stressed that many problems remain 
unsolved. 
  Papoulias stressed the issue of five Greeks being held by 
Albanian authorities, an issue that Serreqi said is in the hands 
of Albanian justice. 
  Serreqi raised the issue of the Tsamidhes [Muslims living in 
Greece south of the Albanian border drawn at the end of WWII and 
who assisted the communists during the Greek civil war] but 
Papoulias replied that Greece considers them to be war criminals. 
  The meeting also discussed the latest border incident at 
Episkopi, which the Albanian foreign minister described as a 
terrorist act. 
  [Athens ET-1 Television Network in Greek at 1500 GMT on 3 
May 
carries a related recorded report from Zurich. Correspondent 
Foivos Karzis notes that "a first step toward normalizing 
Greek-Albanian relations, a step mainly directed at changing the 
climate between the two countries, since no specific commitments 
were made, was taken today in Zurich with the meeting between 
the two foreign ministers, Karolos Papoulias and Alfred Serreqi. 
In substance, this meeting reexamined the whole topic of 
bilateral relations. A positive point to emerge from the 
meeting is that Tirana appears to recognize the importance of 
having good relations with Athens. But the distrust between the 
two countries is widespread and Papoulias' hesitation shows the 
Greek side's reservations." 
  [Papoulias is then cited as saying: "Goodwill was 
ascertained 
today at the negotiating table but it should be turned into 
practice. There are many unsolved problems in Greek-Albanian 
relations."]

  [Text] Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos has 
stressed that the Greek positions on the issue of Skopje [The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] are known and 
established. The spokesman made the above statement on the 
occasion of Alternate Foreign Minister Theodhoros Pangalos's 
interview with LA REPUBBLICA. 
  During that interview, Pangalos referred to the mutual 
right, 
or mutual demand as he later corrected it, by Greece and Skopje 
for the term "Macedonia." In the same interview, Pangalos said 
that Greece will lift the embargo against Skopje if Skopje 
removes the Sun of Veryina [from its symbols] and makes a 
clarifying declaration regarding the disputed articles of its 
constitution. 
  In an interview on FLASH Radio [Athens-based private radio 
station] this morning, Pangalos said that he was referring to a 
mutual demand and not to a mutual right to the term "Macedonia." 
  On this issue, the government spokesman said: I think that 
to search for very specific expressions or interpretations of 
expressions, does not help the execution of our foreign affairs.

<F P=106> [Article by Lia Nesfiye: "Entrance Exams for Admission to </F>
Police Schools"] 
  [Text] Public Order Minister Stelios Papathemelis and 
Deputy Minister Kostas Yitonas plan deep and substantial changes 
in police schools to enable the police to meet the modern 
challenges. They plan the introduction of proper criteria based 
on merit for admission to police schools and for the advancement 
of police officers in the Greek Police [EL-AS] with an objective 
system of transfers, as well as the institutionalization of the 
right to form trade unions. 
  The Ministry of Public Order has already drafted a law for 
the radical restructuring of the police, the change of the 
system for the admission to the police schools, and for police 
trade unions. 
  More specifically, the minister and the deputy minister of 
Public Order in their news conference yesterday presented the 
following: 

  -  A draft bill has been prepared regarding the 
admission into the police schools for officers and policemen, 
and for officers of the fire service using the system of General 
Examinations for the Higher [AEI] and Technical [TEI] 
Educational Institutions. A draft law has already been prepared 
which will regulate the transfers in EL-AS based on objective 
criteria and more specifically based on a system of 
"points." 
  -  The draft bill which has also been prepared regarding 
trade unions is recognizing this right within the basic 
framework of Law 1264 which applies to civil servants, but with 
differences on matters which are not proper for the security 
forces (such as the right to strike). 
  -  The working groups set up 
by the police have drafted a plan for the restructuring of the 
various services by creating multifunction precincts supplied 
with modern equipment, telecommunications facilities, 
computerization, and which will include in their personnel 
security services, public order forces, traffic policemen, and 
market price control police. In other words, all that is 
necessary to provide the comprehensive policing of a given 
area. 
  -  A special group of investigator-detectives is being formed 
to deal systematically with difficult cases to combat organized 
crime. 
  -  Also, a special group is being created in the police to 
deal with emergencies such as street mobilizations, or the 
illegal occupation of buildings which call for special handling. 
This group for crisis handling, as Public Order Minister 
Papathemelis called it, will be properly trained to deal with 
difficult situations. 
  In greater detail, the draft law provides that the admission 
to police schools will be done through general examinations, 
using in the schools for officers the "subject groups" 
pertaining to the higher educational institutions and in the 
schools for policemen those pertaining to the technical 
educational institutions. The officer school studies will be at 
the university level and will cover eight semesters, while those 
for policemen will cover five semesters in addition to one 
semester of practical training. 
  At the same time, a school of national security is being 
established, corresponding to the war colleges of the Ministry 
of National Defense, and will deal with the postgraduate and 
advanced training of higher level police officers. 
  The Public Order minister gave assurances that the bill will 
be introduced [to the legislature] before Easter, adding that 
already the bill has been sent to the other interested 
ministries for their comments which the Public Order Ministry 
will review. 

  -  Regarding transfers to other localities or 
posts, the minister said that they will take place once a year 
and will come into force in September to avoid causing family 
problems to police personnel. The transfers will be determined 
on the basis of "points" adjusted to the needs of the 
service. 
  -  With regard to the trade unions, the minister said that 
there will be a first level, a second level, and one third level 
organization. In other words, the first level organizations will 
join together in a federation as a second level, and a 
confederation will be the highest trade union organization for 
all police personnel. The ministry is engaged in a dialogue with 
the trade unions and other agencies to resolve various issues.

<F P=106> [EC Speech No. 94/44 by Mrs. Christiane Scrivener, </F>
Commissioner for Taxation and Customs, delivered at the American 
International Club of Geneva in Geneva on 29 April: "USA and 
Europe: Why We Need Each Other"] 
  [Excerpts] Ladies and Gentlemen, I am very pleased to 
address the American International Club of Geneva on this so 
important subject of United States and Europe. I consider that 
the transatlantic alliance and relations are as vital today as 
they were before the end of the Cold War. And our relationship 
is also crucial for the future. New challenges are arising and 
important political and economic changes are taking place both 
in the European Union [EU] and in the United States and also in 
the rest of the world. Europe and the United States have a 
common world responsibility. 
  That is the reason why the agreement reached on the Uruguay 
Round is of great importance. It is really a major achievement 
and especially for European Union-United States relations. 
After a period during which European Union-United States 
relations were subject to some strain, the first visit of 
President Clinton to Europe provided opportunity to revitalize 
the European Union-United States dialogue. 
  It was a very good surprise that President Clinton so 
clearly, supported European integration, expressing the view 
that Europe should be a very strong and equal partner. He 
underlined the importance of the European Union for the United 
States and made it clear that "America's commitment towards 
Europe's safety and stability remains as strong as ever." 
[passage omitted] 
  Let us come now to the prospects of European Union-United 
States relationship. 
  The European Union and the United States have the most 
important interdependent relationship in the world. Both sides 
have major, concrete, overlapping interests in the other. The 
European Union and the United States are each other's largest 
single trading partner. Both share fundamental political 
principles and both have an interest in promoting these 
principles in the world. Given the depth of EU-U.S. economic 
and political interdependence and the order of magnitude of 
global political, economic, trade and environmental problems 
which neither side can any longer solve on its own, it is 
imperative that both work together in order to develop common 
strategies and actions. This close relationship between the 
United States and the EU is fully reflected in the transatlantic 
declaration of 23 November 1990, which provides the 
institutional framework for the transatlantic dialogue. In it, 
both sides agreed inter alia on regular and intensive 
consultations, by making full use of and further strengthening 
existing procedures. 
  With the end of the cold war, new economic and political 
challenges have emerged. The European Union, together with the 
United States, is bound to remain in the forefront of regional 
crisis management, especially in the framework of the United 
Nations. Both partners are contributing to stability and 
constructive change in Central and East Europe and the former 
Soviet Union and to the achievement of peace in ex-Yugoslavia. 
Both partners continue to share a common interest in the 
management of other political issues: China, the Middle East, 
and the promotion of democracy and human rights throughout the 
world. At the same time the EU and United States together with 
Japan have the common responsibility and the economic strength 
to stimulate world trade, to revitalize global economic growth, 
including employment and to reduce exchange rate instability. 
  At the NATO summit the approval of the partnership for 
peace approach established a framework for enhanced political 
and operational military cooperation with the Central and East 
European countries. With respect to ex-Yugoslavia, a converging 
approach emerged also from the NATO summit. Formal 
consultations with the United States as called for by the EU 
have contributed to better policy coordination in this area. 
  Following seven years of tough negotiations on the Uruguay 
Round, which quite often put extreme strain on the transatlantic 
relationship, the successful conclusion of the round in December 
1993 demonstrated that both the US and the EU still have the 
political will to work together constructively. 
  On the basis of competitive and cooperative partnership, the 
EU and the United States remain a pole of stability for the 
international community. But if both want to remain each 
other's key partner on the world scene, timely changes and 
adaptations will be needed in the transatlantic dialogue in 
order to contain potential sources of friction and to build up 
an agenda based on joint interest and cooperation. 
  It is important to improve transatlantic channels of 
information and communication in order to avoid misinformation 
and the resulting friction over each other's share of the burden 
of financial, economic and trade efforts necessary to assist the 
reform process in the Central and East European countries and 
Russia. 
  In order to achieve a better cooperation between the EU and 
the United States it is essential that the EU gets its act 
together and speaks with one voice on foreign and security 
policy issues. 
  On the economic and trade side, it is now necessary to 
implement the Uruguay Round and to keep the process under 
political purview. 
  The EU and the United States will have to tackle the 
so-called next generation of trade issues such as trade and 
environment, trade and social issues, trade and competition and 
work closely together on global issues such as population growth 
and environmental degradation. 
  It is very important that an active bilateral dialogue be 
developed on all issues of common interests. 
  As a European Commissioner in charge of taxation and 
customs, 
I have initiated a new dialogue in these fields between the 
European Commission and the United States administration. That 
has been fruitful in the case of the difficult problem of 
unitary taxation. Other tax problems of common interest could be 
discussed in the same way. 
  Another field which seems to me to be crucial for the coming 
years is new technologies. In that field, European Union/United 
States cooperation should be strengthened. It is not only a 
matter for cooperation at governmental or public agencies level. 
It is a matter for business cooperation between European and 
American companies. In some areas, such as the new information 
highways, if Europe and the United States want to keep or to get 
a technological leadership, they must work more together. 
  A kind of common leadership often seems to be the only way 
to 
face competition from Japan and Asia. 
  As you can see, there are a lot of reasons why I think that 
the United States and Europe need each other. 
  The challenges and common responsibilities which both the 
European Union and the United States have to face clearly call 
for more coordinated approaches, common action and closer 
cooperation. It is a question of political will on both sides 
but it is also a question of a better consciousness at all 
levels in the business communities and public administrations on 
both sides of the Atlantic ocean. 
  Thank you for your attention.

  [Excerpts] Oslo, May 3 (AFP) -- UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali suggested here Tuesday [3 May] that UN member 
countries be called on to send more soldiers to Bosnia so that 
the UN can declare the town of Brcko a UN safe haven. 
  But Butrus-Ghali, speaking at a press conference here, 
stopped short of making his suggestion into a formal request. 
"First we must study the proposal carefully, and determine what 
sort of new resources it will require. Secondly, we need more 
UN soldiers, and thirdly we need a new resolution from the 
Security Council and from NATO," he said. [passage omitted] 
  Butrus-Ghali was quick to deflect recent criticism of the 
United Nations' work in the former Yugoslavia, and denied 
comments that its efforts were a fiasco. "We have succeeded in 
preventing an open conflict in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia], and we have managed to maintain the 
ceasefire in Krajina. And we have managed to take care of two 
million refugees," he emphasized. 
  "We have not succeeded in finding a peaceful solution to the 
war in Bosnia, but setbacks should not prevent us in our work 
for a solution," he added. 
  Butrus-Ghali also underlined the growing importance of the 
UN's role in global conflicts. "With the Cold War behind us, 
the UN has the opportunity to play a stronger role. We find 
ourselves in a series of global problems, where all the 
countries are in the same boat. But the UN's strength lies in 
the support from the public opinion of the 185 member 
countries," he said. 
  During his three-day visit in Oslo, Butrus-Ghali has met 
with 
Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, Foreign Minister 
Bjoern Tore Godal, and representatives of the parliament's 
committee on foreign affairs. 
  He also laid a wreath at the grave of the first UN Secretary 
General, Trygve Lie, at the Grorud cemetary. 
  From Norway Butrus-Ghali will travel to Geneva, and then on 
to South Africa.

<F P=106> [Report signed Th.F.: "Brussels Demands Formal Apology From </F>
Rwanda"] 
  [Excerpt] Belgium has given its first official response to 
the Rwandan accusations that Belgium was involved in the attack 
on 6 April in Kigali which cost the life of President 
Habyarimana and led to the massacres. Yesterday morning, 
Francois Ngarukiyintwali, the Rwandan ambassador in Brussels, 
was called to the Foreign Ministry. After announcing Belgium's 
"vigorous" protests at the statements made by the Rwandan 
ambassador in Zaire, in particular, and by the Rwandan foreign 
minister, the Foreign Ministry's Secretary General Roelants 
repeated that Belgium had nothing to do with this tragedy, 
either through the Belgian units which are part of UNAMIR (UN 
Mission in Rwanda) or through any Belgian authority. 
  Consequently, the Rwandan ambassador was informed that the 
Belgian Government is demanding the interim Rwandan Government 
to formally and unequivocally withdraw the statements that 
Belgium was an accomplice, an instigator, or the perpetrator of 
the assassination of Juvenal Habyarimana, as well as the 
statements claiming that the Rwandan Patriotic Front (FPR) 
received support from Brussels. 
  As long as these statements have not been withdrawn, neither 
the Rwandan foreign minister nor any member of the interim 
Rwandan Government will be allowed into Belgium. This does not 
mean a breakdown in diplomatic relations between Brussels and 
Kigali. To put it plainly, any future contact between Belgium 
and Rwanda at the highest level will be subject to an apology 
from Rwanda. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- The German Government has lifted 
its ban on arms deliveries to Turkey. This was announced in 
Bonn today by Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel. 
  Kinkel pointed out that the Federal Defense Ministry has 
evaluated the photographs given to the Foreign Ministry "as 
proof of Turkey's use of weapons and equipment from military aid 
programs contrary to the terms of the agreement." The result is 
that "use contrary to the terms of the agreement cannot be 
proved on the basis of the photographs." The German Government 
has therefore decided to resume the deliveries to Turkey as 
stipulated in the agreements on NATO defense aid, material aid, 
and special arms aid.

  [Text] Paris, May 3 (AFP) -- France and the United States 
agreed Tuesday [3 May] on the urgent need to organize a 
ministerial meeting on Bosnia due to the recent spread of 
fighting, French Foreign Ministry spokesman Richard Duque said. 
  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher agreed on the move during a telephone 
conversation Tuesday morning, he said, giving no details of 
where or when such a meeting might take place. 
  He said an urgent meeting is needed in particular because of 
the increased threat of conflict outside the six UN-designated 
safe areas in Bosnia-Hercegovina. 
  "The prevention of new slippages...necessitates the 
deployment on the ground of new protection forces outside the 
security zones established by the UN Security Council." 
  He said a switch from "respecting Security Council 
resolutions to Atlantic Alliance decisions" was required, in an 
apparent reference to the possibility of using force. 
  Concern has been focussed in recent days on the Brcko 
corridor in northeastern Bosnia, where Serbs are trying to widen 
their supply route between Serbia and northwest Bosnia. 
  Duque said there was "a worrying concentration of troops 
from 
both sides" in the region, adding that talks were continuing on 
a possible increase in peacekeeping forces, in particular around 
Brcko. 
  Military analysts predict that Brcko, in a five-kilometre 
(three-mile) bottleneck in supply-lines from Serbia to Serb 
areas in northwestern Bosnia, will be the next target of Serb 
offensive.

<F P=106> [Interview with Italian Prime Minister-Designate Silvio </F>
Berlusconi by Vittorio Testa in Milan on 30 April: "Berlusconi 
Promises Instant Government" -- first paragraph is LA REPUBBLICA 
introduction] 
  [Text] Milan -- "Yes, I am optimistic. My program is 
ready. There is enthusiasm, optimism, on the part of the people, 
the financial markets. We will do our utmost to boost the 
economy and development, to eliminate bureaucracy and poor 
services. Consultations with the social partners will begin at 
1500 hours Monday [2 May]. Tuesday evening we will start 
discussing names for the government. When will the government 
be ready? By the end of the week." Silvio Berlusconi feels 
like a prime minister-designate whose path ahead is a fast, 
downhill one, to be covered all in a single swoop. At 1500 
hours he arrived from Porto Rotondo, where in the morning he 
inspected the security work going on at his two villas on the 
Costa Smeralda. After a brief visit to Marcherio to see his 
family, he returned to Arcore, where he installed himself in 
front of his fax machines and teleprinters to bring himself up 
to date on the day's political developments. 
  [Testa] The Milan attorney's office is requesting [Northern 
League leader] Umberto Bossi's remittal for trial. Is this an 
obstacle to your government? 
  [Berlusconi] No, I do not think so. The foundations of the 
alliance remain intact. The election results mean that the 
country's moderate majority enjoy political representation. By 
preventing the Left from acceding to government, we have done 80 
percent of the work. Now we still have to do the remaining 20 
percent -- to form a good government. There is already 
agreement on the program, condensed into a draft version of 24 
pages. The government will be ready by the end of the week. 
  [Testa] Will it also include ministers belonging to the 
National Alliance [AN]? Many people, including authoritative 
foreign politicians, are demanding that there be no neo-fascist 
ministers. 
  [Berlusconi] There will be ministers of Forza Italia, the 
League, and the AN, too, of course -- but people who do not have 
an illiberal past. And there will also be people who do not 
belong to the parties of the alliance, people chosen on the 
basis of their capabilities. And also teachers, businessmen, 
managers, experts. 
  [Testa] Perhaps from Segni's Pact? Tremonti, for instance? 
  [Berlusconi] There is no agreement on this. We cannot rule 
out cooperation with individuals, but there are no contacts yet. 
Certainly, Tremonti is excellent. 
  [Testa] Will Antonio Martino be foreign minister? 
  [Berlusconi] I think that would be right. 
  [Testa] And Dini treasury minister? 
  [Berlusconi] I would say so. 
  [Testa] What about the interior minister? Will it be a 
League member? 
  [Berlusconi] No comment. I can tell you that the League has 
never officially made any such request. What it has requested, 
however, is responsibility for local government, but 
unfortunately the ministry cannot be split in two. 
  [Testa] What about [Radical leader] Marco Pannella? 
  [Berlusconi] I would like him to join the government. 
  [Testa] Has the League reaffirmed its veto? 
  [Berlusconi] No comment. 
  [Testa] Certainly Di Pietro will not join your government. 
The Milan prosecutor's office remains unchanged. Are you 
disappointed? 
  [Berlusconi] There have never been any approaches, either 
official or unofficial, by the prime minister to Di Pietro, who, 
I repeat, I greatly esteem. Those were just journalistic 
rumors. Be that as it may, I think the matter is now entirely 
closed. 
  [Testa] Still on the subject of the Milan prosecutor's 
office, the magistrates have made it known that the corruption 
investigations will continue along their path. It is a long 
path. However, some people are in favor of a solution.... 
  [Testa] Yes, I know. I have always said that accounts must 
always be settled. So I think that we must proceed, go ahead, 
and hold the trials. This, of course, so that justice can be 
done, with no desire for revenge. No, there must be no 
whitewashes, but I do believe that in the future we must also 
start considering possible solutions. In the past few days I 
have been pondering certain things. The political class has 
been almost totally renewed; the great prominence with which the 
media is reporting this and the dramatic television 
representation of the trials are themselves a kind of 
punishment, of atonement, as far as image is concerned. Then 
there are the businessmen: Often they had no other way to 
enable their factories to function... 
  [Testa] One of the businessmen that has been charged is 
your brother, Paolo. Are you worried? 
  [Berlusconi] Of course, it would be better for such things 
not to happen. But how can you expect a businessman to carry 
the cross? Be that as it may, I have not been active in public 
construction programs since 1976; there were things about it 
that I did not like. And I am glad that I made that decision. 
  [Testa] With regard to the corruption trials, are you 
opposed 
to the presence of television cameras in the court rooms? 
  [Berlusconi] I have always been so. It is barbaric; justice 
cannot be turned into trial by the masses. 
  [Testa] Let us return to the government, to the problem of 
guarantors and the criticism that is leveled at you: namely, 
that the subject of supervision has himself appointed his own 
supervisors... 
  [Berlusconi] I did not choose the three experts on my own. 
They were chosen on the basis of suggestions from several 
people. But I will be surrounded by guarantors, by ministers, by 
parliament, by the opposition forces, by the media, by the 
public, by the public prosecutors' offices, by the antitrust 
committee, by the television watchdog committee. Furthermore, 
there is no reason why the three experts cannot introduce 
further changes. 
  [Testa] What about blind trusts? 
  [Berlusconi] That is impossible in the case of enterprises 
and factories. 
  [Testa] Will you sell your television companies? 
  [Berlusconi] I am not even considering it. My appointment 
could last a year, a month, or a day. And I have five children. 
Anybody with a little common sense can understand that. 
  [Testa] But has the president asked you to do so? 
  [Berlusconi] No. Scalfaro is someone with a great deal of 
common sense. But I would also point out that people voted for 
me partly because they know that I will be able to distinguish 
between my own interests and the country's. They know that I 
will never make a decision that could benefit my own companies. 
People are sensible.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Spain Will Start Constructing Four </F>
F-100 Frigates in 1996"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- Spain will start constructing four F-100 
frigates in 1996, in accordance with the international 
cooperation agreement signed in Maastricht with Germany and the 
Netherlands providing for the purchase of common equipment for 
these frigates. 
  The program envisages seeking tenders from over 30 Spanish 
enterprises as possible suppliers of the most important common 
equipment. This could mean a 33-percent share and a similar 
cooperation in the new developments. Spanish industry will also 
take part in constructing the Netherlands' and Germany's 
frigates, with a consequent 100-percent technological return on 
Spanish investments. 
  A 75-percent share in constructing the F-100 frigates and a 
15-percent contribution by the Spanish industries to the German 
and Netherlands projects would thereby be achieved. 
<H5>  Definition Stage </H5>
  The project is at the definition stage, begun in November 
1993, with a cost of of 891 million pesetas. The Bazan 
enterprises, the Indra Group, SAES, and the Netherlands Signaal 
enterprise will take part in this stage. 
  The F-100's, which will be delivered to the Navy between 
2001 
and 2003, will replace the Baleares frigates and will have low, 
medium, and high altitude antiaircraft missiles, 
surface-to-surface missiles, and helicopters.

  [Excerpts] Li Ruihuan, one of the major leaders in China, 
has met Finland's political leaders in Helsinki. The talks with 
President Martti Ahtisaari, Prime Minister Esko Aho, and Foreign 
Minister Heikki Haavisto raised issues concerning world 
politics, relations between China and Finland, and human rights 
in China. Matti Vaeisaenen reports. 
  [Vaeisaenen] The treatment of Chinese dissidents -- 
oppression, harassment, detention, and arrests -- has aroused 
opposition from western governments toward the political 
leadership in China. Finland's line has been -- as shown during 
Prime Minister Esko Aho's visit to China a month ago -- that 
human rights are talked about but no big fuss is made about 
them, and an attempt is made to influence Chinese politics in a 
discreet fashion. In this sense the talks with Li Ruihuan were 
not very different. Both President Martti Ahtisaari and Foreign 
Minister Heikki Haavisto raised the matter of human rights. 
Departmental head Jaakko Laajava from the Foreign Ministry said 
that Haavisto expressed Finland's basic views. [passage omitted] 
  Li justified the events in Tiananmen Square five years ago 
with the explanation that chaos caused by some activists was 
threatening the country at the time. If the matter had not been 
dealt with, that is if the opposition, which was known as the 
democracy movement in the West, had not been crushed by armed 
force, China might have gone the way the Soviet Union went -- 
disintegration, Li Ruihuan said. 
  The Chinese guest reiterated one of the main principles of 
Chinese politics, that it does not interfere in the affairs of 
other countries and it does not allow others to interfere in its 
affairs. This includes human rights; according to China, taking 
care of human rights is entirely an internal matter. 
  Li Ruihuan explained to the Finnish leaders the basic 
principles and achievements of the economic and political reform 
process in China. The rapid pace of developing economic 
relations between Finland and China was mentioned in this 
connection. 
  Finland and China agree that Russia is an important factor 
internationally and it must not be isolated. In the dispute on 
the Korean peninsula China attempts to keep the peninsula 
nuclear free by peaceful means. Li warned that China's 
influence is not limitless, and overly high expectations should 
not be attached to China's influence.

  [Text] Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said the 
Cypriot Government believes that the procedure followed so far 
by the United Nations to promote a Cyprus solution has failed 
because of the lack of political will by the Turkish side. It 
also believes that the time has come for the UN Security Council 
to consider alternative ways to promote the problem. 
  The spokesman clarified that when he refers to the procedure 
he means the one on the confidence-building measures [CBM's] and 
all the others followed in the past to promote the sets of ideas 
from former UN Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar and UN 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. Kasoulidhis added that 
the president has some thoughts on ways to promote the Cyprus 
issue and will submit them to the National Council after the UN 
secretary general submits his report. 
  Answering a question, the spokesman said the government does 
not believe that a silent deadline has been given to the entire 
procedure but that it is merely a delay. He added that the 
Cypriot Government has not asked for new meetings with Joe 
Clark, the UN secretary general's special representative in 
Cyprus, or Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's alternate 
special representative in Cyprus, during this period. 
Kasoulidhis said: The government does understand what can be 
said in such meetings, unless Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf 
Denktas changes his position and that side accepts the UN 
document of 21 March. Our side has no margins for further 
negotiations on this document. 
  Asked about information that Clark will resign, that a 
replacement will be appointed, or that observers will be 
appointed to the Cyprus issue the spokesman said the government 
has no information.

<F P=106> [Report by Ugur Sefkat: "Turkey Will Buy Missiles From </F>
Russia"] 
  [Text] Turkey and the Russian Federation have moved to 
cooperate on defense. National Defense Minister Mehmet Golhan 
has revealed that Turkey will buy long-range missiles from the 
Russian Federation. He also said that he agreed with Defense 
Minister Pavel Grachev to help Turkey to acquire Russia's 
technology in ballistic missiles. 
  Golhan stressed that he held talks with Pavel Grachev, who 
is 
one of Russia's most influential officials, when he visited the 
Russian Federation some time ago. He asserted: "Defense 
Ministry officials in Russia informed me that they are prepared 
to sell various types of arms." 
  Golhan said that Turkey has moved to acquire missiles 
because 
Iran and Syria already have them in their military inventories. 
He asserted: "Russia has very advanced missiles. We will 
cooperate with it to help Turkey acquire its missile technology. 
We have particular problems with our neighbors from the point 
of view of missiles and nuclear weapons. Iran and Syria have 
long-range missiles. So Turkey must equip itself accordingly. 
Turkey has never been an aggressor country. It does not intend 
to become one. We covet no country's territory. But we must 
maintain a deterrent force. Turkey is committed to the Treaty 
on Conventional Forces in Europe. We are not competing with our 
neighbors to acquire arms. But we do not want Turkey to be 
regarded as a weak country. A significant opportunity exists 
for cooperation with the Russian Federation to modernize the 
Turkish Armed Forces in every area." 
  Golhan stressed that Turkey has concluded a framework 
agreement with the Russian Federation for technical cooperation 
in defense. He said: "Everything has been included in that 
framework agreement. They agree to cooperate on issues relating 
to their missile technology. Experts from the two countries 
will work to realize their cooperation." 
  Iran, Iraq, and Syria have many Scud missiles. Iran has 
reportedly cooperated with the DPRK to increase the range of its 
missiles and improve its missile technology. According to U.S. 
intelligence reports, Iran has acquired technology on guided 
missiles. It is working to produce a missile with its own 
resources. 
  Iraq used Scud-B missiles during the Gulf war. But the 
technology that was used in the production of those missiles was 
old. Consequently they were not effective. The Scud-B missiles 
are 90 cm in diameter, weigh 6,300 kg, and have a range of 300 
km. They may miss their targets by 600-800 meters. They may 
operate with solid or liquid fuel and deliver chemical or 
nuclear warheads. The Russian Federation has long-range 
missiles, which have been produced with modern technology. 
  Turkey signed the agreement known as the Missile Technology 
Control Regime in 1993. The United States, the Russian 
Federation, and many Western countries also signed that 
agreement, which bans the sale of missiles with a range of over 
300 km and that can deliver warheads heavier than 500 kg. The 
agreement also limits the transfer of the technology required 
for the production of such missiles. Iran and Syria, which 
possess long-range missiles, have not signed that agreement. 
  The Russian Federation's SS-21 missiles are not included in 
that agreement. The SS-21 missiles, which were developed in 
1976 to deliver conventional warheads, have a range of 120-200 
km. They are launched from mobile launchers. Reportedly, the 
technology used in the production of the Scud missiles is 20 
years older than the technology used in the production of the 
SS-21 missiles. The arming of the SS-21 missiles with warheads 
capable of causing mass destruction has been banned. Turkey has 
acquired military equipment and arms from Russia in the past.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has stated that steps 
are being taken toward a new Middle East -- politically, 
economically, and socially -- and added that Turkey will 
continue to contribute in that direction. Cetin departed for 
Egypt to participate as an observer in the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement signing ceremony in Cairo. 
  In a predeparture statement at Ankara's Esenboga Airport, 
Cetin said that the agreement is a historic turning point with 
regard to formulating the structure of Palestinian self-rule in 
Gaza and Jericho. Pointing out that peace is a process which 
needs time and patience, Cetin explained that there have been 
difficulties since the Declaration of Principles agreement was 
signed in Washington. Stressing that peace-loving countries in 
the region made great efforts, Cetin added: 
  [Begin Cetin recording] The personal contributions of 
Egypt's -- friend and brother Egypt's -- President Husni Mubarak 
expedited the signing of the agreement. Turkey, from the start, 
contributed to the Middle East peace process and stated that 
only by negotiations and dialogue can peace be achieved in the 
Middle East. Within this framework, Turkey participated in all 
the multilateral meetings -- five working groups -- and 
perpetuated its contributions toward the peace process. 
  From the beginning, Turkey supported the five working groups 
and was an active participant in these multilateral meetings. 
As a matter of fact, Turkey used its historical, brotherly, and 
cultural relations with the Arab world and its good relations 
with Israel, as the only Muslim country which recognized it from 
the beginning, positively. Turkey always used its relations 
with Israel and with brotherly and friendly Arab countries 
toward peace. The point reached today is historical. [end 
recording] 
  Expressing great happiness at being able to participate as 
an 
observer at such an important agreement, Cetin said that Turkey 
will continue to contribute to the peace process in the 
restructured Middle East. 
  Cetin will return to Turkey after the Gaza-Jericho agreement 
signing ceremony.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Patriarchate?"] </F>
  [Text] Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou has visited the 
United States. He was the first Greek prime minister to do so 
in the past 20 years. Yeoryios Papandreou, his son, made the 
preparations for his visit. He is the deputy foreign minister 
responsible for the affairs of Greeks who live in foreign 
countries and is also responsible for Greece's relations with 
the Greek lobby in the United States, AHEPA [American-Hellenic 
Educational and Progressive Association] affairs, and matters 
related to the Patriarchate in Istanbul and the Turkish minority 
in Western Thrace. 
  Prior to leaving for Washington to prepare for his father's 
visit, Yeoryios Papandreou arrived in Istanbul and held talks 
with the patriarch. He also attended a mass in the 
Patriarchate. Yeoryios Papandreou held talks with the AHEPA 
members and made several initiatives with the support of 
Archbiship Iakovos, head of the Orthodox Churches in Washington. 
Meanwhile, George Stephanopoulos, who is an adviser to the 
White House, was asked to help him gain the support of the 
Greek-American voters. 
  Meanwhile, a warning in Clinton's letter, which Prime 
Minister Tansu Ciller leaked to the press prior to the local 
elections in Turkey on 27 March, has drawn attention. It said: 
"It will be in Turkey's interest to work with all its 
neighbors, including Greece, to reduce tensions in the region to 
a minimum. Your government may take certain symbolic steps to 
reduce the latest tensions in relations between Turkey and 
Greece. In view of that, I am convinced that an effort should 
now be made regarding certain developments. One of the symbolic 
steps that you may take could be related to the Greek Orthodox 
Partriarchate in Istanbul. I hope that you will consider easing 
certain difficult problems to help the Patriarchate become a 
functioning institution." 
  That message reemphasized the views U.S. officials have for 
many years conveyed to Ankara under the pressure of the Greek 
lobby. 
  What Clinton has requested from Ciller is the recognition of 
an "ecumenical status" for the Patriarchate. In fact, Clinton's 
statement at the press conference he held in the White House 
after he met Andreas Papandreou was interesting. President 
Clinton asked for a change in the Patriarchate's status; he did 
that under pressure from the Greek lobby. 
  The Patriarchate's status is not provided for in the 
Lausanne 
Treaty, it has been outlined verbally. The Patriarchate does 
not have any political or administrative authority. According 
to the Lausanne Treaty, the Patriarchate is nothing more than a 
Turkish institution. Its task is to function as the spiritual 
institution of the Orthodox community in Turkey. The 
Patriarchate functions in accordance with Turkey's laws, as do 
other Turkish institutions. 
  The Patriarchate's wish for an "ecumenical status" is based 
on Orthodox tenets. It has dreamed of attaining a "state 
status" in Istanbul, like the Catholic Church has in the Vatican. 
  There are several patriarchs in the divided system of the 
Orthodox Churches. However, the patriarch in Istanbul is more 
influential than his colleagues elsewhere in the Orthodox world. 
There is a strong desire for the patriarch of Constantinople 
[Istanbul] in the Orthodox world to gain a status similar to 
that of the Pope in the Catholic World. This is based on two 
reasons. The first is their wish that he be the most influential 
patriarch in the Orthodox world; and the second is the wish to 
have an equal ecumenical status with the Pope so they can have a 
balance, in status and protocol, among the Christian Churches. 
However, any move in that direction may create a religious 
state within a state, which would conflict with the Lausanne 
Treaty and the republican principles in Turkey. 
  From Turkey's viewpoint, the concept of an "ecumenical 
status" is meaningless. As far as Turkey is concerned, the 
Patriarchate is just an ordinary Turkish institution. Clinton's 
request for an improvement of the Patriarchate's working 
conditions is tantamount to interference in Turkey's internal 
affairs. 
  However, is it not true that Prime Minister Ciller's request 
for a letter of support from Clinton, which she would use as a 
trump card in the elections, was tantamount to inviting him to 
"interfere in Turkey's internal affairs?" Obviously, such a 
request would encourage him to raise the question of the 
Patriarchate's status. Naturally, Clinton has not missed this 
opportunity to support Andreas Papandreou in Greece's domestic 
politics and bow to voters of Greek origin in the United States. 
  An interesting point is Yeoryios Papandreou's arrival in 
Istanbul from Washington. He gave first-hand information to the 
Patriarchate on his contacts in Washington. 
  All that has a very important aspect for Turkey. The 
Pan-Slavic trend was resurrected after the collapse of the 
Soviet Union. Meanwhile, the Orthodox Church, which has had an 
important political role throughout history, has moved to step 
up its activities in the region. What can be more natural than 
coordination between an Orthodox organization based in Istanbul 
and the Greek Megali Idea [Great Ideology], which Greece has 
never abandoned?

  [Text] Kazakhstani Foreign Minister Kanat Saudabayev has 
stopped over in Ankara following his visit to Saudi Arabia. 
Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin received Saudabayev at Ankara's 
Esenboga Airport and conferred with him for some time. 
  In a statement he issued prior to the meeting, Cetin 
recalled 
that two years ago Saudabayev was in Turkey as his country's 
ambassador and expressed his pleasure at receiving Saudabayev as 
his counterpart. 
  Cetin said: Relations between Turkey and Kazakhstan have 
developed rapidly since its independence. Today, approximately 
100 Turkish companies have reached the point where they are 
ready to conduct business in Kazakhstan. The investments and 
projects of these business ventures exceeds $400 million. Our 
exports and foreign trade with Kazakhstan, which started at 
zero, have reached significant dimensions. There is a very 
close cooperation between us. There are almost 2,000 students 
from Kazakhstan studying in Turkey. 
  Cetin pointed out that a protocol was signed envisaging the 
transportation of oil from Kazakhstan over Turkey by way of the 
Mediterranean to world markets and added that work on the issue 
will be furthered. 
  Saudabayev, in turn, explained that the very quickly 
developing bilateral cooperation between Turkey and Kazakhstan 
proves to what extent the two kindred people value each other. 
  Saudabayev will leave Turkey after spending the night in 
Ankara.

  [Text] Ankara, May 3, IRNA -- The visiting Iranian Deputy 
Foreign Minister Mohammad Hashemi discussed Tehran-Ankara ties, 
regional cooperation and international developments in his 
separate meetings with Turkish officials Monday [2 May]. 
  In a meeting with the Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin 
Monday, the two sides reviewed developments in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Azerbaijan-Armenian dispute. 
  Praising Turkey for its activities in connection with the 
Bosnian plight, Hashemi termed as insufficient U.N. measures in 
Bosnia and called for further cooperation among members of the 
Islamic Confence Organization (ICO). 
  Hashemi who arrived here Monday also called for 
Tehran-Ankara 
cooperation in Central Asia within the framework of Economic 
Cooperation Organisiton (ECO). 
  Terming mutual ties as positive, Cetin lauded Iran's 
cooperation in maintaining the security of joint borders. 
  Referring to the Bosnian plight as a black page in the 
history of Europe, he stressed that Iran and Turkey had 
identical views on the developments in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  In another meeting with Turkish Interior Minister Nahit 
Mentese the same day, Hashemi stressed that presence of alien 
forces in the region was detrimental to regional security and 
stressed that regional security should be maintained by regional 
governments. 
  In an interview with reporters here after the meeting, 
Hashemi said that in his talks with Mentese, mutual cooperation 
especially in the areas of security and border issues were 
discussed. 
  Stressing that regional governments are duty-bound to 
preserve the territorial integrity of Iraq, he said that foreign 
governments by raising the Kurdish plight have managed to sow 
discord in the region. 
  On the presence of multinational forces known as `Poised 
Hammer' in Turkey, he said that Iran had declared its opposition 
to the occupation of Kuwait and the presence of alien forces in 
the region since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. 
  Meanwhile, Hashemi and his counterpart Ozdem Sanbarg held 
the 
first round of their talks Monday and discussed mutual ties as 
well as regional and international developments including those 
in Iraq, Republic of Azerbaijan, and Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Hashemi is scheduled to meet Turkish President Suleyman 
Demirel and Prime Minister Tansu Ciller as well as other ranking 
officials during his three day official stay here.

<F P=106> ["The World Today" column by Ali Sirmen: "Righting a Wrong"] </F>
  [Excerpts] It appears as though Foreign Ministry Under 
Secretary Ozdem Sanberk's visit to Baghdad will constitute the 
beginning of a process that will yield beneficial and 
significant results for both countries. [passage omitted] 
  During the talks to be conducted with the Iraqi delegation 
that will arrive in Ankara in the coming weeks, ways will be 
sought to develop new relations between Turkey and Iraq, 
beginning with the repair of the oil pipeline and the pumping of 
the 12 million barrels of oil that are currently trapped in the 
pipeline. This will not be in violation of the embargo but will 
be pushing it to its limits. 
  There is no doubt that the UN embargo and the unchanged 
attitude of the United States with regard to Saddam constitute 
an obstacle to the development of these relations. To tell the 
truth, however, Turkey's current economic situation does not 
allow it to heed these objections. In any case, Ankara will not 
violate the embargo but merely bend the rules to revive the 
relations. 
  No one should be surprised if these initiatives meet with 
objections. Given the events in Bosnia, it is also wrong to 
think that the United Nations and Washington will not have the 
boldness to oppose the development of our relations with Iraq. 
Have there not been sufficient examples of double standards on 
the part of the United Nations and the United States until now? 
  Turkey should now try to bring the miscalculation to the 
attention of the whole world and explain to the Western 
countries that Saddam is a reality that is here to stay, that 
totally isolating Iraq and pushing it into a difficult situation 
will not contribute to regional peace, and that fundamentalism 
could spread into this region to fill any vacuum caused by 
Saddam's overthrow. 
  Even if it does not solve Turkey's economic problems 
entirely, the development of relations with Iraq could 
contribute positively to overcoming the economic crisis. 
[passage omitted] 
  In brief, the process started with Sanberk's visit is 
important enough to constitute the first steps of righting a 
wrong, as long as it is well appraised and the necessary 
determination is demonstrated.

  [Text] In a letter to President Clinton, Prime Minister 
Tansu Ciller has informed him as follows: "The Turkish Cypriot 
side has done what it was expected to do on the Cyprus problem. 
You should now try to influence the Greek Cypriot side." 
  Prime Minister Tansu Ciller decided to send a letter after 
she returned from the United States and after Volkan Vural, 
chief adviser to the Prime Minister's Office, visited north 
Cyprus. The letter was conveyed to the U.S. Embassy in Ankara 
on Friday [29 April]. A copy of it was conveyed to the Turkish 
Embassy in Washington. Ciller's letter was also in reply to a 
letter she received from President Clinton before the local 
elections in Turkey. 
  According to circles close to the Prime Minister's Office, 
the message that was conveyed in Ciller's letter to President 
Clinton was: "TRNC [Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus] 
President Rauf Denktas agreed to the confidence-building 
measures [CBM's]. That was what he was expected to do. 
However, the CBM's package was later changed. In view of that, 
the ball is now in the Greek Cypriot side's court. We ask you 
to try to see to it that the Greek Cypriot side takes a 
conciliatory approach." 
  It will be recalled that President Clinton met Prime 
Minister 
Tansu Ciller at the White House last month. He asked her to 
pressure Denktas to agree to the CBM's.

  [Excerpts] The Turkish Grand National Assembly [TGNA] held 
a preliminary debate today on the motion to hold a general 
debate on the Cyprus issue submitted by deputies from the 
Motherland Party [ANAP], the Prosperity Party, and the Great 
Unity Party. 
  Addressing the TGNA session held under Vefa Tanir, Foreign 
Minister Hikmet Cetin said that Turkey will never support a 
solution unacceptable to the Turkish Cypriot people. He 
recalled that the Turkish Cypriot side accepted the first 
confidence-building measures [CBM's] package in principle, but 
that the package was later changed to suit the demands of the 
Greek Cypriots. Cetin explained that the talks were suspended 
because the changes involved political elements. He said: The 
duty of the United Nations now is to restore the balance in the 
CBM's, because their balance has been upset. 
  [Begin Cetin recording] The Greek Cypriot side and Greece 
did not accept the CBM's and did not support them. That is the 
source of the problem. The tactics and policies pursued by the 
Greek Cypriot side with a view to advancing its application to 
join the European Union will only serve to exacerbate the 
confidence crisis in Cyprus. [end recording] 
  The foreign minister charged that in principle, the Greek 
Cypriots want a solution that will bring back the pre-1974 
situation. Turkey cannot allow the reestablishment of the Greek 
Cypriot Republic, which was eliminated in 1963, he said, adding 
that a post-1974 solution must be sought in light of the present 
realities. Cetin said that there is no need for pressure in 
Cyprus, because there has not been any bloodshed on the island 
since 1974. 
  The foreign minister pointed out that to solve the Cyprus 
problem, the political equality of the two communities, which 
have different languages, religion, and cultures, must be 
accepted. He stressed that Turkey's guarantees are also a 
condition for the solution. Cetin added that Turkey will 
continue to defend and support the just cause of the Turkish 
Cypriot people. 
  [Begin Cetin recording] Turkey will not support a solution 
unacceptable to the Turkish Cypriot people. If we must choose 
between an unviable and unrealistic solution and the reaction of 
certain circles, we will be ready and determined to face this 
unfair reaction. [end recording] 
  After Cetin's speech, ANAP leader Mesut Yilmaz expressed the 
views of his party. Yilmaz charged that the Assembly is not 
being briefed on the foreign contacts being held regarding the 
Cyprus problem. We are trying to follow the developments 
through bits of information leaked to certain newspaper 
columnists, he said, adding that these rumors are causing 
concern. He called on the prime minister to reveal the historic 
opportunity she says must not be missed. I am concerned for 
the future of the Turkish Cypriot people, Yilmaz said. 
  [Begin Yilmaz recording] I want to say to the prime minister 
the following: You are the prime minister of the Turkish 
Republican State. On behalf of my deputies and, if they allow 
me, on behalf of all the deputies, I promise you: If you assume 
your responsibilities with the faith the nation expects of you; 
if you fulfill your duties; if you, with sincere determination, 
protect our rights and interests regarding the Cyprus problem, 
which is not only the national issue of the Turkish Cypriot 
people but of Turkey as well; if you stop making the grave 
mistake of believing and of trying to make the Turkish public 
believe that the traps and the salami tactics are good 
opportunities, then we will support you as a nation, even if the 
entire world challenges you. [end recording] 
  Yilmaz concluded by saying that a general debate will be 
beneficial because the truths will be revealed. [passage 
omitted] 
  After the speeches, the TGNA voted against the motion to 
hold 
a general debate on the Cyprus issue.

  [Text] Prosperity Party leader Necmettin Erbakan has 
declared that the Cyprus negotiations cannot be conducted 
through pressure and that there is no benefit in continuing the 
talks until the Greek Cypriot side accepts equal status with the 
Turkish Cypriots. 
  Erbakan received a delegation headed by Dervis Eroglu, 
leader 
of the National Unity Party of the Turkish Republic of Northern 
Cyprus [TRNC]. During the meeting, Erbakan said that there 
cannot be any concessions in Cyprus. Pointing out that the work 
conducted for the past 20 years to solve the problem has failed 
to yield any results, Erbakan remarked that the experiences in 
the Caucasus and the Balkans have clearly demonstrated that the 
kind of federal state planned for Cyprus cannot bring peace and 
tranquillity. Erbakan stressed that the Turkish and Greek 
sectors in Cyprus are living in peace as two separate 
communities and two separate states. 
  [Begin Erbakan recording] Given the circumstances, we see 
that the plans to eliminate the TRNC, which are being 
implemented step-by-step by foreign forces, constitute part of 
the grand scheme they wish to undertake in Bosnia and 
Azerbaijan. Moreover, the political status accorded the 
patriarch in Istanbul, as if he were a Byzantine king, is also 
part of the same grand scheme. [end recording] 
  Nationalist Action Party leader Alpaslan Turkes has declared 
that no government can adopt a decision against the Turkish 
Cypriot community. Eroglu visited Turkes at parliament today. 
In a statement during the meeting, Turkes said that if the two 
communities in Cyprus must live together and cooperate, this can 
be realized within a confederation. He explained that there are 
two separate states on the island and only a confederation to be 
established through their agreement can constitute a solution. 
In other words, Turkes remarked, we do not see any benefit in 
the forced marriage the United Nations is trying to impose. He 
said: Furthermore, we do not believe this is possible, because 
there have been very painful incidents and it is impossible to 
trust the Greek Cypriot community. 
  Turkes remarked that the Turkish community on the island 
cannot be allowed to face the threat of genocide again or be 
deprived of its human rights. 
  [Begin Turkes recording] No government can adopt a decision 
that will harm the Turkish Cypriot community or go against its 
interests. It cannot underwrite such a decision, because the 
cause of the TRNC and of the existence of the Turks on the 
island is the cause of the Turkish nation. The Turkish nation 
embraces this cause zealously. It is not possible for a 
government representing Turkey to adopt a decision contrary to 
the wishes and will of the Turkish nation. Even if such a 
decision were adopted, the people would not recognize it and 
such a government could not remain in power. [end recording] 
  In turn, Eroglu stated that the whole world must be told 
that 
there are two separate states in Cyprus and that the people are 
living in peace.

  [Excerpts] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has charged that 
certain circles are trying to circumvent the parliament in 
undemocratic ways. She said: Nobody should be involved in 
scenarios set up to protect the damaged interests of certain 
business circles. 
  Ciller stressed that on behalf of the people, the government 
will break the chains around the economy with the same 
determination it has been displaying in defeating terrorism. 
  Addressing a True Path Party [TPP] meeting today, Prime 
Minister Tansu Ciller, the TPP leader, pointed out that the 
economic problems were not caused by the present government. We 
set out on our path with determination, she said, in order to 
solve the problems we inherited. 
  The prime minister said that taking excessive loans and then 
taking loans to pay the interest on the original loans was one 
of the reasons for the problem. She explained that during its 
last term, the ANAP [Motherland Party] government was using 
3,000-percent short-term advance loans yearly and that the 
public deficit was at a record level. She then discussed the 
incorrect foreign exchange rate policy pursued since 1987. 
  [Begin Ciller recording] It is an economic rule that in 
order to keep the foreign exchange rate low, you must raise 
interest rates to very high levels. However, this is an 
incorrect policy. If you keep the foreign exchange rate so low, 
you get a lot of foreign exchange in the country. You then take 
that foreign exchange, change it, buy government bonds, make a 
tax-free profit on the artificially raised interest rate, and 
take that money out of the country again. Those who did that 
went to banks abroad, deposited their gains, and took 100 
percent or 200 percent in loans. They brought those loans and 
foreign exchange into the country again, changed them into 
Turkish money, and bought government bonds again. They then took 
their tax-free profits out of the country again. This has been 
going on since 1987. This was the vicious circle we had to 
break. [end recording] 
  Ciller explained that had the low foreign exchange rate and 
high interest rate policy been pursued further, the public 
sector would have collapsed in 1995. She said: We would have 
had to take loans at high interest rates in order to keep the 
foreign exchange rate low. The taxes would all have gone toward 
paying interest. We would have reached a point in 1995 where we 
would have had no money for anything else -- not for education, 
not for investment, and not for the salaries of the civil 
servants. 
  The TPP leader pointed out that the import-export deficit 
was 
another reason why her government had to break the vicious 
circle. 
  [Begin Ciller recording] Our decision to break this vicious 
circle was not to the liking of certain circles who used to make 
that sort of deal, who had brought $12 billion into the country 
in that way, and who were waiting to take it out with the 
interest. In fact, those circles are now waging a major 
struggle. They are traitors. I am saying this openly. 
[applause] They are traitors, because if this vicious circle 
is not broken, the bill will have to be paid by the people. Who 
is going to pay for the interest? Who is going to pay for the 
bill of this foreign exchange rate, given the large deficit 
between imports and exports? 
  Today, the honorable leader of the Motherland Party was 
caught red-handed. He was caught red-handed. [applause] Mr. 
Mesut Yilmaz is saying that business circles want him to topple 
this government. What business circles are these? Are they 
patriotic, medium-size business circles that were not involved 
in these deals, did not incur losses, and then did not come 
crying for help? No, they are not. Are they small business 
circles? No. Are they the villagers? No. Are they the 
shopkeepers? No. Are they our workers and civil servants? No, 
they are not. Who are they? They are those whose interests 
were damaged. [passage omitted] 
  The leader of the TPP is not the leader of the happy few. 
[applause] The leader of this party is not elected by a group 
of people outside parliament. This party has held its 
congresses. It held two congresses during the past year. It 
also participated in elections. Those circles who could not 
make Mesut Yilmaz prime minister, despite all the treason and 
all their intensive efforts, are now trying to circumvent the 
parliament in undemocratic ways. Nobody should even try, because 
the TPP, which has waged a democratic struggle throughout its 
history, will never allow that. [end recording] 
  Ciller stressed that given the composition of the 
parliament, 
no government can be formed without the TPP. She said that the 
TPP leader was not elected by an extraparliamentary minority 
group but by the people's delegates at the party congress. 
  [Begin Ciller recording] Nobody should declare himself above 
parliament. Nobody should even try to carry out a minority 
coup. Nobody should be involved in scenarios set up 
undemocratically and outside parliament to establish a so-called 
government of technocrats or some such thing. This will only 
serve to protect the damaged interests of certain business 
circles. Nobody should make false threats in order to achieve 
that. [applause] [passage omitted] [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Cengiz Kuscuoglu] </F>
  [Excerpt] Ankara -- A campaign is being waged against 
National Education Minister Nevzat Ayaz within the True Path 
Party [TPP] for ousting three high-level bureaucrats from 
office, who are said to be members of a religious sect. Ayaz 
declared that it is out of the question to retract the decision 
on the appointments. 
  The campaign launched by 80 nationalist-conservative TPP 
deputies following Ayaz's dismissal of three high-level 
bureaucrats, who are said to be religious sect members, 
triggered a deep crisis in the party. 
  Kocaeli Deputy Ismail Amasyali, who is leading the campaign 
within the TPP, said: "The minister should either make a 
statement to satisfy us, or he should reinstate the officials. 
Otherwise, the assembly group is determined to overthrow him." 
Ayaz, on the other hand, noted: "These changes were effected 
with the knowledge of the prime minister, on professional 
grounds. There is no question of retracting the decision."

<F P=106> [Article by Nationalist Action Party deputy leader Mustafa </F>
Muftuoglu: "The Provocations Are Coming From the Other Side"] 
  [Excerpts] There are certain points on which the 
Prosperity Party [PP] and we differ. In his speeches on TRT 
both before and after the local elections, Mr. Erbakan said that 
in certain parts of Turkey, people will be able to speak 
whatever language they want and that the PP feels comfortable 
with there being more than one legal system in the country. As 
far as we are concerned, Turkey's only official language is 
Turkish. An additional language is inconceivable. To say that 
people will be able to live within their own legal systems means 
dividing the country into a few parts. That is utterly 
unacceptable to us. The PP is defending certain dangerous 
views. We have warned that party on various occasions. 
  There is one extreme in Turkey that wants to keep Islam 
confined within the people's conscience and another extreme that 
wants to impose an Iranian model on the people. One of these 
groups hides behind secularism; the other exploits religious 
sentiments. Science, religion, state affairs, and justice are 
separate issues. The PP wants to assume all four functions at 
once. In a campaign we will launch in early May, we will fight 
the polarization between secular and antisecular. 
  The fundamentalists have continuously targeted the 
Nationalist Action Party [NAP] since 1980. They tried to bring 
about an Iranian-type revolution by either enlisting the NAP to 
bolster their passive grass roots or pointing to the NAP as the 
target. We never gave in to these games and we never will, even 
though the PP may carry out provocations against us now. 
[passage omitted] 
  We heard that the PP got votes en masse in the southeast. It 
is possible that the PP worked hard for these votes and got them 
in the end. I would like to remind you of one of my previous 
statements, which largely went unheeded: I said that a 
fundamentalist or liberal type will conduct the PKK [Workers 
Party of Kurdistan] movement's activities on a legitimate 
platform. Apo [Abdullah Ocalan] may soon be no more than a 
figurehead.

  [Text] Istanbul, May 2 (A.A.) -- The Turkish Journalists' 
Union released a written statement on Monday [2 May] deploring 
the police brutality that occurred during Sunday's May Day 
demonstrations. 
  The statement said taking the film cassettes and hindering 
television cameramen were direct obstruction of press 
organizations. 
  The statement also said these incidents were not only 
attacks 
on journalists but at the same time limitations of the right to 
receiving news. 
  Social Democratic Populist Party (SHP) deputy Salman Kaya 
was 
beaten by police during Sunday's May Day demonstrations. 
  In Ankara a demonstration by the `democratic platform' which 
was organized by Turk-Is, DISK and Hak-Is unions, started 
quietly at noon, but failed to end the same way when a group of 
demonstrators refused to disperse afterward. Their refusals 
triggered a clash during which the demonstrators divided into 
two groups. One group started stoning cars. A man who fell 
over the Sihhiye bridge during the clash with the police and who 
was taken to hospital is not in critical condition. 
  Officials said a number of people have been detained for 
`provocation of the people'. 
  May Day was celebrated by various rallies in Turkey as `the 
day for international unity, solidarity and struggle.' 
  Economic rather that political slogans were spoken during 
the 
rallies. 
  The leaders of the Turkish Confederation of Trade Unions 
(Turk-Is), the Confederation of Revolutionary Trade Unions 
(DISK) and the Hak-Is confederation united under the democratic 
platform in Istanbul. 
  Together with the three confederations, the syndicates of 
public employees and democratic mass organizations also held 
rallies in Izmir, Adana, Bursa, and Samsun.

  [Text] Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland plan to

  Nordic defense ministers meeting in Denmark today expect a

  Norway and Denmark are members of the North Atlantic Treaty

Denmark in the European Union, have paved the way for them to 
extend the traditionally close Nordic cooperation in most areas

  [Text] Korsoer, Denmark, May 3 (AFP) -- Nordic defence 
ministers called Tuesday [3 May] for the United Nations to take 
a tougher line over its peacekeeping operations in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Concluding a two-day meeting in Korsoer, near Copenhagen, to 
assess the situation of Nordic peacekeepers in the war-ravaged 
republic, the ministers said it was "important to reinforce the 
decision-making process" to give the UN a credible role and 
protect its troops in crisis and war zones. 
  While the UN possessed an effective network of civilian 
mechanisms, there were chinks in its military armour which had 
to be eliminated, Norwegian Defence Minister Joergen Kosmo 
asserted. 
  He said he and his colleagues were "satisfied" with 
assurances given them Monday by the commander of UN forces in 
Bosnia, Britain's General Sir Michael Rose, who promised the 
Nordic troops would receive the air protection they required. 
  "New procedures" which the UN forces had set in motion would 
accelerate the provision of air cover, Rose told the ministers 
after he was invited to address them on the UN mission in the 
former Yugoslav republic. 
  But the Nordic ministers said in response to Rose's call for 
more troops for the international peacekeeping effort that their 
nations were not in a position to add to the contingent the 
Scandinavians already have on the ground. 
  Danish Defence Minister Hans Haekkerup said the Nordic 
nations have proportionately more troops in the UN force than 
any other country, while Swedish counterpart Anders Bjork called 
on the United States in particular to contribute to the peace 
mission.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report on French Foreign Minister Alain </F>
Juppe's speech in Brussels on 2 May: "Alain Juppe for Enlarged 
Europe of More Than 20 States"] 
  [Text] French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe called on the 
European Union (EU) on Monday [2 May] to adopt a "clear and 
ambitious position" with respect to the countries of Central and 
East Europe and the Mediterranean countries which are knocking 
with increasing insistence at its door, by setting a date for 
the start of membership negotiations and by drawing up a list of 
countries seeking talks. 
  "We cannot be satisfied with delaying or vague replies," 
Juppe stressed in a speech in Brussels on Monday evening to the 
Royal Institute of International Relations. The foreign 
minister referred to the EU responsibilities to these countries 
at a time when the "order of Yalta" as decried so much by France 
and Europe has collapsed. 
  "We welcomed the fall of the Berlin Wall as a first step 
toward a larger Europe (...). It is time to give concrete 
effect to this statement, by setting a date for the start of 
membership negotiations," he added. 
<H5>  Flexible Transitions </H5>
  The French foreign minister also recommended a body of 
"pragmatic measures" designed to facilitate this process. Among 
other things, he believes this should include a list of 
countries interested in future negotiations and a certain 
"flexibility" when examining membership procedures. He proposed 
an association of future member states in the area of common 
foreign and security policy prior to EU full membership, 
together with "transitional arrangements" allowing candidates to 
adapt their economy to common EU policies. 
  However, France sees the institutional reforms for a Europe 
enlarged from 20 to 25 member states as a precondition for such 
moves. 
  "Everyone agrees that the present institutional framework, 
which is already ill-suited to a Europe of 16, will bring 
problems which will be difficult to overcome in a Union of 20 or 
25 members," Juppe stressed. The French minister gave the 
example of a parliament which would include 716 members, a 
Commission of 24 members, a presidency once every 10 years for 
each member state, and a Council of Ministers paralyzed by 
sessions taking four hours just for every participant to speak. 
  Even if "the search for unanimously acceptable solutions 
proves difficult," France "will be the determined adversary of a 
status quo which we would see as tantamount to paralysis or 
dilution," he added, calling upon the Twelve to already start 
the process of reflection with a view to the 1996 
intergovernmental conference. 
<H5>  The Principle of Subsidiarity </H5>
  During his talk, Alain Juppe also stressed respect for 
national identities: While accepting the transference of major 
powers to the EU, he stressed the essential value of the 
principle of subsidiarity in his eyes. "Europe must only 
substitute for or complement the member states where its action 
is strictly necessary: The crisis of confidence (...) is no 
doubt partly due to our lack of understanding of this principle 
of reality." France will therefore be very attentive to this 
point.

  [Text] Brussels, May 4 (AFP) -- The European Commission 
Wednesday [4 May] announced 54 million dollars in additional aid 
to victims of the war in the former Yugoslavia. 
  Some 24.4 million dollars will go directly to Bosnia, mostly 
in the form of medical material, while Croatia will receive 12.9 
million dollars to help accommodate refugees, he said. 
  Serbia and Montenegro will receive 17.1 million dollars in 
basic food products for refugees and others in the two 
republics, which together form the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia. 
  Since 1991, the European Union has granted 876 million 
dollars in aid for victims of the war in former Yugoslavia, 
including 87.4 million since the start of this year. 
  The European Commission is the executive arm of the 
12-member 
European Union.

<F P=106> [Interview with EC Commission Deputy President Sir Leon </F>
Brittan by Christophe Lamfalussy on 3 May; place not given: 
"Almost All the Heads of Government Are Keeping Their Cards 
Close to Their Chest" -- first two paragraphs are LA LIBRE 
BELGIQUE introduction] 
  [Text] At the age of 54, Sir Leon Brittan is certainly not 
at the end of his career. But the battle he has launched in 
difficult conditions to try to succeed Jacques Delors is one of 
the great challenges he has set himself. 
  At a time when Jean-Luc Dehaene is hiding behind his "no 
comment," Margaret Thatcher's former minister is playing the 
openness card. He has just written a book, The Europe We 
Need which has been published by Plon. In addition, the 
European Commission (EC) deputy president is granting 
interviews, like the one he granted to LA LIBRE BELGIQUE on 
Tuesday morning [3 May]: 
  [Lamfalussy] Are you, after all, the only declared candidate 
to replace Jacques Delors? 
  [Brittan] I am not a declared candidate. This is not an 
election campaign. But everybody knows that the British 
Government has nominated me. And I have publicly said that I am 
available. I have worked here for five years and six months. 
It would be a great honor to do something more for Europe if 
the heads of state and of government so wish. Because there are 
discussions on this subject, in the new world of openness and 
democracy, I think we must be clear and express our ideas. 
  [Lamfalussy] You are the only one to be putting your cards 
on 
the table.... 
  [Brittan] Almost all (the heads of state and of government 
-- 
LA LIBRE BELGIQUE editor's note) have told me that being open is 
an advantage for Europe. 
  [Lamfalussy] Do you still have a chance? 
  [Brittan] It is clear that most of the governments have not 
yet decided. The decision will be made in Corfu. A great deal 
is being written in the newspapers. This is mainly speculation. 
Almost all the heads of government are keeping their cards 
close to their chest. 
  [Lamfalussy] Do you therefore expect a decision at the Corfu 
summit? 
  [Brittan] It will be made in Corfu. That is a legal 
necessity. We must prepare for the new Commission. And the 
European Parliament now also has a say. 
  [Lamfalussy] Is it a handicap to be British? 
  [Brittan] I assume that the guarantee of having no national 
discrimination exists for the choice of the future EC president 
too. 
  [Lamfalussy] The British Government has adopted positions 
which have offended France, Germany, and other countries.... 
  [Brittan] I am supported by the British Government but in 
full awareness of my differences of opinion. The British 
Government understands this very well and has stressed the fact 
that I am independent. My book is not an expression of the 
British Government's view. 
  [Lamfalussy] In this connection, is one of the big 
differences your support for monetary union? 
  [Brittan] And this is nothing new. Even before I came to 
Brussels, after my resignation from the British Government, the 
first speech I delivered in the House of Commons advocated 
Britain's entry into the the Exchange Rate Mechanism at a time 
when the government had not yet decided to do so. 
  [Lamfalussy] You are relatively optimistic about monetary 
union, but with the feeling that a hard core will be 
necesssary.... 
  [Brittan] This is the Maastricht Treaty plan. A degree of 
temporary variable geometry is included in the treaty for those 
who satisfy the convergence criteria. Those who are really in a 
position to start the third phase will do so. The others will 
wait. 
  [Lamfalussy] Should these convergence criteria be strictly 
implemented? 
  [Brittan] We must not change them. But you will find in the 
treaty provision for the possibility of examining the progress 
made in a dynamic way. This means that if a country is in a 
position which is close to the criteria and is on the right 
path, it would be possible to judge that the time had come. 
  [Lamfalussy] In your book, you do not cite Belgium as one of 
the countries which could join the first group? 
  [Brittan] This does not mean that Belgium is excluded from 
it! It is perfectly possible. Starting the third phase in 1997 
is doubtful. But doing so in 1999 is possible. A great deal 
can happen in five years. 
  [Lamfalussy] Your book reflects your economic concerns, free 
trade, opening up to East Europe, monetary union. However, the 
big date for Europe in the coming years is political. It will 
be the 1996 intergovernmental conference. 
  [Brittan] It is obvious that the conference is important. 
The central concept is that we should not choose between 
expansion and deepening. Both must be chosen. We must accept 
the Central and East European countries for moral, economic, and 
political reasons. Moral because we must help these countries to 
continue along their path. Economic because the inclusion of 
these countries will ultimately be an advantage for us. 
Political because if we are negative toward them, the result 
will be to push them toward the Russians. They will have no 
alternative. But these countries themselves do not want to join 
a Community which would be weakened. Deepening must therefore be 
continued.... My view of Europe is that it must be open and 
capable of defending itself. For that, it must be united and 
have a driving force. And that driving force is the Commission. 
  [Lamfalussy] What do you think of the Delors years? 
  [Brittan] The position of the institutions has been 
enormously strengthened. The leadership has really been able to 
provide a vision. 
  [Lamfalussy] What should the future EC president be like? 
  [Brittan] It is not for me to define him. I express my ideas 
very frankly. But it is for other to say what personal 
qualities the future president should have.

  [Text] The Hague, May 3 (AFP) -- Outgoing Dutch Premier 
Ruud Lubbers will stand as a candidate to succeed Jacques Delors 
of France as president of the European Commission, the Foreign 
Ministry said Tuesday [3 May]. 
  Foreign Minister Pieter Kooijmans will formally present 
Lubbers' candidacy to the European Union soon, the Ministry said 
in a statement. 
  Lubbers resigned earlier Tuesday as general elections were 
held in the Netherlands. He was not running for re-election. 
  Until now Lubbers, 55 in a few days, had refused to say if 
he 
was aiming for Delors' job, saying to discuss it would be 
inappropriate as long as he was head of the Dutch government. 
  Delors' term expires on January 5 of next year. 
  In 1992 the Frenchman said Lubbers would be a good 
successor, 
and Dutch television said Tuesday it was Delors himself who 
encouraged Lubbers to seek the post. 
  Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, a Christian 
Democrat 
like Lubbers, is also seeking the job and diplomats say he has 
the support of France and Germany. 
  Lubbers has led three coalition governments in the 
Netherlands over the past 12 years.

<F P=106> [By Charles Miller, PRESS ASSOCIATION defence correspondent] </F>
  [Text] The 32 billion pound sterling Eurofighter was 
unveiled today as the world's most advanced fighter took to the 
skies. 
  Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind called it "a small step in 
the history of military aviation" as the four European partners 
paraded their dream before senior figures from potential future 
customers. 
  Officials from Saudi Arabia, Japan and Malaysia watched 
Eurofighter's impressive international public debut alongside 
existing customers at the opening ceremony at British 
Aerospace's Warton site in Lancashire. 
  About 1,500 leading figures in the aerospace industry saw 
the 
unveiling of the aircraft which is developed jointly by Britain 
(33 percent), Germany (33 percent), Italy (21 percent) and Spain 
(13 percent). 
  The Eurofighter will eventually replace the RAF's [Royal Air 
Force] Jaguars, Tornado F3s and defunct Phantoms and will be the 
most advanced fighter in the world apart from the American F-22, 
which will be several years later entering service and twice as 
expensive. 
  The project is also crucially important for the aviation 
industries of the four countries as it is sustaining a total of 
150,000 jobs. "It is a major part of our industry priority and 
offers hope of employment for many tens of thousands of people 
along the length and breadth of the UK," said Mr Rifkind. 
  ``We are all privileged today to be taking part in a small 
step in the history of military aviation and to see a little bit 
of history being born before our eyes. It is always a romantic 
and remarkable event when a new aircraft takes to the sky and 
pushes forward yet further the boundaries of aviation 
technology.'' 
  As defence budgets tumble in Europe, the four industrial 
partners are looking for multi-billion pound sales elsewhere, 
particularly the Middle East and Far East, in the early part of 
the next century. But Eurofighter's primary role will be to 
defend the skies of Europe for the first 30 years of the next 
century. 
  However, the partner nations today warned industry to check 
the soaring costs of the project, with German state secretary of 
defence Joerg Schoenbohm saying no extra funds were available. 
"It is a particular desire of the German defence minister to 
lower the costs of this project," he said. 
  Mr Schoenbohm said Germany would not decide until next year 
whether to go ahead and buy the aircraft. The German defence 
minister Volker Ruehe, who two years ago almost pulled Germany 
out of the project, was noticeable by his absence at the 
unveiling. 
  Spanish armaments director Juan Arenas said the project 
represented a "very high cost" and they had to be very careful 
about every peseta invested. "We cannot allow ourselves to 
spend more than our national economies are able to afford. You 
must always keep this in mind." 
  Mr Rifkind added: "We all have interest in bringing down 
costs in a sensible way."

<F P=106> [Interview with Chancellor Franz Vranitzky by Gisela </F>
Hopfmueller in Vienna on 4 May] 
  [Text] [Hopfmueller] The chancellor has been commenting on 
the Strasbourg decision outside his office, where he has been 
answering journalists' questions. Asked whether he was 
surprised by the clear-cut decision, he said: 
  [Vranitzky] No, I am not surprised. This is an absolutely 
pleasant and successful day for Austria and for European policy. 
Over the past few days and weeks I have had numerous contacts 
with representatives of European Union [EU] states, where I 
repeatedly said that the catastrophic warnings that the vote 
might fail were unfounded. This result confirms my view very 
clearly. We have moved a step forward. This outcome shows very 
clearly that not only do we Austrians want to get into the EU, 
but the EU is trying to get us as members. This also shows that 
the goal of Austrian membership is being taken seriously and is 
appreciated beyond Austria's borders. This is a pleasant day 
internationally, with apartheid being voted out in South Africa, 
with the Gaza-Jericho Agreement being signed today, and now with 
this overwhelming majority for Austria's accession to the 
European Parliament. This has been a good day for international 
understanding and cooperation. 
  [Hopfmueller] Do you think that today's decision will have 
an 
effect on Austrian opinion with regard to the forthcoming 
referendum? 
  [Vranitzky] Yes, I think so, because, owing to incorrect 
reports from Strasbourg, many commentators and observers have 
been doubting lately whether the EU wanted Austria as a member 
at all. That we are welcome has become very clear today, and I 
think that this is a positive sign for our referendum. But, as 
I already said in parliament today, and I can only repeat it: 
International events are one thing, and winning over the 
Austrian population for this objective is another. This is the 
real political task that lies before us. It is also a matter of 
putting those in their place who are linking the European issue 
with the population's fears and doubts. But in fact, politics 
should create trust and credibility; and this task will be taken 
very seriously over the next few days and weeks.

<F P=106> [Statement by Foreign Minister Alois Mock in Vienna on 4 May </F>
-- recorded] 
  [Text] I would like to announce that the European 
Parliament has voted in favor of agreeing to Austrian membership 
in the European Union [EU] with a majority of 374 votes, 24 no 
votes, and 61 abstentions. I would like to point out that, for 
me, this signifies an appreciation of the remarkable course our 
country has taken since 1945. I also think this recognizes our 
political and social stability as well as the achievements of 
our country. I think this vote also appreciates Austria's role 
and implies an obligation for Austria regarding its historical 
relations with the countries of Central and East Europe. Last 
but not least, it also shows that Austria is a valuable and 
natural partner for the EU. With today's vote, the nations of 
Europe that are members of the EU have invited the Austrian 
people to contribute their share as partners in a peaceful 
future. I am convinced that the Austrian people will give a 
positive answer on 12 June.
