<F P=106> [Peter Norman report: "Lords Warn Brussels of EU Jobless </F>
Expansion"] 
  [Text] The European Union [EU] is facing the prospect of a 
"jobless expansion" with the European Commission underestimating 
the gravity of its structural unemployment, a House of Lords 
committee warns today. 
  Warning that "unemployment is the most important social 
problem facing us at the present time," the Committee on the 
European Communities calls on the EU "to develop a strategy both 
for competitiveness and for employment." 
  Restoring Europe's competitiveness is a necessary condition 
for sustained growth, the Committee says in a report on last 
year's Commission white paper on growth, competitiveness and 
employment. But competitiveness will not solve the problem of 
structural unemployment -- the type that will not be dislodged 
by economic growth and accounts for at least half of the EU's 17 
million or more jobless. 
  The report says structural unemployment is, "if anything, 
even more serious than the white paper suggests." 
  The Committee says the EU has much to learn from the United 
States and Japan, which have better records of job creation. It 
cites inadequate growth and investment, high short-term interest 
rates over a long period, reduced competitiveness in terms of 
quality and cost, loss of "technological edge," high unit labour 
costs and excessive non-wage labour costs as reasons for the 
EU's high structural unemployment. 
  Job creation can be achieved partly through improving 
productivity and partly through encouraging innovation. But the 
Lords point out that microeconomic measures to create jobs need 
to be carried out at a national, rather than at an EU level. 
These include simplifying regulations, reforming benefits and 
the use of lifelong education and vocational training to match 
skills to changing technological needs. 
  The EU's role should be to act as a catalyst for the 
exchange 
of ideas; an advocate of best practice; a monitor, for example, 
of the effect of regulations on employment; and an umpire to 
prevent mutually destructive de-regulation between member states. 
  The Lords report, which was agreed unanimously, says that 
recovery should be "the immediate priority" of macroeconomic 
policy in the EU. It urges member states to aim to achieve the 
tough fiscal and monetary convergence criteria of the Maastricht 
Treaty in the medium term. "They should not be strictly applied 
until the Community has recovered from recession," the report 
says. 
  Although the report steers clear of a full assessment of the 
planned economic and monetary union, it is sceptical as to 
whether it will help solve the problem of cyclical unemployment. 
The report calls on the EU to complete the single market quickly 
and enforce it equally.

<F P=106> [Kenneth Gooding report: "Alumina Terminal Opened on </F>
Russia's East Coast"] 
  [Text] An Anglo-Russian project to open up one of the 
bottlenecks that has restricted the import of an essential raw 
material for the Russian aluminium industry became operational 
this week when 25,600 tonnes of alumina (aluminium oxide) was 
unloaded by new facilities at the east coast port of Vanino. 
  The bulk alumina handling facilities, costing "several 
million dollars," are jointly owned by by Trans-World Metals, 
the UK-based trading group, and the Vanino Port Authority, one 
of the new Russian joint stock companies. 
  Russia has only one other such handling facility, at 
Murmansk. According to Mr Alan Bekhor, managing director of 
Trans-World, said to be the biggest trader in Russian aluminium: 
"The Vanino facilities open the way for alumina to get to 
Russia more efficiently. They represent a logical link between 
Australia, the world's biggest alumina producer, and Russia's 
big Siberian smelters." The first alumina through the 
facilities was bought from Alcoa of Australia. 
  Mr Bekhor said that within three months a second stage would 
lift the bulk alumina handling capacity at Vanino to 50,000 
tonnes a month. The port is at one end of the Baykal-Amur 
railway which runs parallel to the Trans-Siberian railway. 
  In theory the facilities are available to all but 
"TransWorld 
will probably keep them busy for the rest of this year." 
However, Mr Bekhor stressed: "This is a long-term investment 
and there will be no quick returns."

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Next week in Bonn Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl and President Boris Yeltsin will have to talk about the way 
in which the last Russian soldiers will be bid farewell to in 
Germany on 31 August. An exchange of letters about the planned 
ceremonies, which in the German view have already been agreed 
on, has not been concluded yet, Government Spokesman Dieter 
Vogel told journalists on Friday [6 May]. This also seems to 
confirm the criticism of a celebration in Weimar expressed by 
Colonel General Matvey Burlakov, commander in chief of the 
Western Group, in an interview with DPA on Thursday. 
  Vogel said the celebration in Weimar is just intended to 
recall the "century-old cultural cooperation," while the actual 
farewell ceremony for the soldiers will take place in Berlin, as 
demanded by Burlakov and agreed with President Yeltsin. 
However, the farewell parades for the Western allies and the 
Russian troops will indeed take place separately, the government 
spokesman stressed. The festive farewell to the U.S., British, 
and French soldiers will take place in Berlin on 8 September. 
John Major, Britain's head of government, has accepted Kohl's 
invitation. 
  Yeltsin's official visit will begin in Bonn on 11 May; on 12 
May, Ascension Day, Yeltsin will visit the Cathedral in Speyer, 
and on 13 May he will go to Stuttgart.

  [Text] Heringsdorf (DPA) -- At their regular conference on 
Friday [6 May] the interior ministers of the laender were not 
able to agree to a stop to the deportations of Kurds. This was 
stated by Saxony's Interior Minister Heinz Eggert (Christian 
Democratic Union) in Heringsdorf on the Baltic Sea island of 
Usedom. A joint working group is now supposed to examine to 
what extent victims' descriptions of being tortured after their 
return to Turkey are correct. Eggert criticized the work of the 
Foreign Ministry, which "did not" examine these reports "quickly 
enough and did not eliminate all doubts." 
  At the beginning of the meeting, FRG Interior Minister 
Manfred Kanther (Christian Democratic Union) presented a report 
on the security situation. In addition, the agenda also 
included the observation of the right-wing extremist 
Republikaner, equal rights for policemen in eastern and western 
Germany, as well as cooperation with the police in East Europe.

  [Text] Munich (DPA) -- At their regular meeting in Munich 
on Friday [6 May], the majority of culture ministers of the 16 
laender renewed the veto of their land governments against a 
cultural agreement between Germany and Iran. The ratification 
of the agreement, which was concluded in 1988, cannot be 
approved "because of the continuing human rights violations" in 
Iran and because of the fact that the death threat against 
author Salman Rushdie has not been retracted. Because of 
Germany's federal system, the ratification of cultural 
agreements requires the approval of the laender. 
  At the conference, the latest arrangements between the 
Foreign Ministry and Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmud 
Va'izi during his visit at the end of February in Bonn were also 
criticized. During this visit, it was agreed, among other 
things, to establish an institute to promote the German language 
in Tehran and to resume the work of the German Archaeological 
Institute. 
  The laender learned about these agreements only from the 
media, it was stated. "In view of the acts of cultural 
barbarism in Iran, which are supported by the Iranian 
Government," official cultural relations between the FRG and 
Iran are, in the view of the culture ministers, "also 
undesirable below the level of a cultural agreement," Bremen's 
Culture Senator Helga Truepel (Greens) said.

  [Text] Bonn -- Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl has 
reiterated his view that "with the coming of spring, the climate 
for a new upswing in Germany has got warmer." Speaking at the 
21st round of talks on economic development in eastern Germany 
on Monday [9 May], Kohl said in front of top industrialist and 
trade union representatives that "the upswing that is becoming 
apparent in western Germany will also have a favorable effect on 
the further reconstruction of the east." 
  Industrial research in the new laender continues to be a 
problem, with the number of people working in this field 
declining drastically from 80,000 (1990) to 16,000. Kohl 
pointed out that companies in the new laender have the important 
task of developing new ideas, turning them into marketable 
products, and opening up new markets for these. He said that 
the Federal Government has supported research and development in 
east German industry with some 2.4 billion marks since 1991. 
  Research Minister Paul Krueger and Economics Minister 
Guenter 
Rexrodt reported that industrial research in eastern Germany is 
showing positive signs in spite of the difficult overall 
situation. The shrinking process has clearly slowed down. 
  The president of the Federal Association of German Industry 
(BDI), Tyll Necker, said that the BDI has called upon west 
German industry to assign a large amount of research commissions 
to companies in eastern Germany. This is included in a 
"Purchasing Offensive East," which has helped a good deal in 
promoting product sales. The president of the Chamber of 
Handicrafts, Heribert Spaeth, announced new training initiatives 
by companies in order to secure a sufficient number of 
apprenticeship positions.

  [Text] Hamburg (DPA) -- According to the Defense Ministry, 
the Federal Government has in no case become liable to recourse 
by discontinuing deliveries to private arms dealers following 
reunification. A spokesman for the ministry thereby reacted to 
a BILD AM SONNTAG report, according to which foreign and German 
firms demand payments from the government totaling 440 million 
German marks, because the Defense Ministry failed to carry out 
arms deliveries from National People's Army stocks that it had 
promised during the time of the GDR. 
  The deliveries were agreed upon with the GDR government 
under 
former Disarmament and Defense Minister Rainer Eppelmann. The 
Defense Ministry spokesman said that with Germany's unification 
in 1990, all contracts with private arms dealers were canceled. 
Only contracts that did not violate the War Weapons Control 
Law were accepted. Following that delivery halt, the ministry 
had in fact been sued repeatedly for noncompliance with its 
contractual obligations, but it had not lost a single case. He 
added that one lawsuit was still pending, but here, too, the 
prospects of success were good.

  [Text] Guenter Verheugen, federal manager of the Social 
Democratic Party of Germany, has called upon his counterparts of 
the Christian Democratic Union, Christian Social Union, Free 
Democratic Party, and Alliance 90/Greens to form an alliance to 
act against the radical right-wing Republikaner. In a letter 
cited by the ZDF "Bonn Direkt" program on Sunday [8 May], 
Verheugen suggests that the democratic parties should hold 
counterdemonstrations against Republikaner election campaign 
rallies in communities, cities, and rural districts. According 
to Verheugen, people react helplessly time and again, by 
counterdemonstrations that often end up in violence and "provoke 
civil war-like scenes." 
  Meanwhile, Republikaner Chairman Franz Schoenhuber told a 
ZDF 
reporter why he is so often absent from committee meetings in 
the European Parliament. He said he does not want taxpayers to 
pay for the presence of a deputy who "cannot move anything 
anyway" in the committees.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Berlusconi Winding Up Party </F>
Consultations"] 
  [Text] Rome 6 May (ANSA) -- Premier-designate Silvio 
Berlusconi will wind up his official government-formation 
consultations with political parties today, official sources 
confirmed this morning. 
  Berlusconi began the final round of consultations with a 
meeting with the (former Communist) Democratic Party of the 
Left, at 1000 local (0800 GMT). 
  At 1100 local he will meet one of his two main coalition 
partners, the hard-right National Alliance. At 1200 he will 
meet the other one, the federalist Northern League. An hour 
later he is scheduled to confer with Communist Renewal, and at 
1400 local with his own group, Forza Italia. 
  A Forza Italia official, Domenico Mennitti, after a meeting 
with Berlusconi announced that "the road to the formation of a 
new government is all downhill." 
  Berlusconi may decide to withdraw the traditional "reserve" 
on the mandate given by the president as early as Saturday [7 
May], Forza Italia Senate whip Cesare Previti commented. 
  Both officials declined to comment negotiations over the 
post 
of Interior minister. 
  Berlusconi himself said he may withdraw his reserve on 
Monday. "That would be the most logical thing to do," he told 
reporters after ending his consultations here. 
  He also forecast that the Senate debate on the new 
government 
may begin as early as next Thursday but Berlusconi stressed he 
did not want to "make commitments" on when negotiations would be 
completed. 
  "I want to be consistent with what I have already said: it 
takes time to do things well," he said, adding that he did not 
want to fix definitive dates for votes of confidence or other 
political developments. 
  Berlusconi denied he planned to withdraw his reserve 
tomorrow, saying he needed more time to fine-tune his political 
program. "I think it is correct to go to the president with a 
program, perhaps not definitive but at least with the major 
points defined, and a list of ministers," he said. 
  He declined to give any names of possible ministers and 
stressed that for the Interior Ministry, "everything still has 
to be specified."

<F P=106> [Ennio Caretto editorial: "First Test With Clinton"] </F>
  [Text] The European Parliament's controversial "no" to 
neofascist ministers has not yet been echoed in the American 
media. But it has reopened last month's debate in the 
administration, following the Italian elections and after U.S. 
diplomat Douglas Jones' accusation directed against Germany: 
("They do not want to confront their own past"). This debate, 
since relegated to the sidelines, can be resumed as follows: 
What position should the United States take if the neofascist 
parties enter government in Europe? And in particular: What 
attitude should it take if this were to happen in Italy? 
  The question merits an urgent answer. Clinton will arrive in 
Italy on 2 June, Republic Day; on 3 June, he will commemorate 
the American landing at Anzio and Nettuno, and on 4 June the 
liberation of Rome. Clinton will be the first foreign head of 
state to meet Silvio Berlusconi, the (highly probable) new 
Italian prime minister. And it is almost certain that the 
meeting between the President and Berlusconi will be preceded by 
a trip to Washington by the (probable) new Italian Foreign 
Minister Antonio Martino. 
  And that is not all: Clinton will be back in Italy on 6 July 
for the G-7 meeting in Naples. On these meetings will depend, 
in part, the outcome of the current debate within the U.S. 
Administration. 
  The United States will be attentively following the 
President's double visit. The Americans make no secret of their 
fear of a return of fascism in West Europe, which they see as a 
shore of their own democracy. Last April the NEW YORK TIMES 
criticized "the ascent of the neofascist party in Italy," 
defining Mussolini as a "cardboard Caesar," and reminding 
Italians that the Duce left behind an inheritance of "military 
defeat and political chaos." 
  Two days ago, Susan Zuccotti, a lecturer in contemporary 
European history at Barnard College, reminded people of the 
Fascists' collaboration in the holocaust, warning that "it is 
hardly surprising that Jews, and not only they, are alarmed at 
the rebirth of the extreme right." 
  In America, the influence of public opinion on governments 
(Republican and Democrat alike) is pretty strong, as 
demonstrated by Clinton's second thoughts on Haiti, Somalia, and 
Bosnia. Through the influential Jewish intelligentsia, public 
opinion is beginning to demand that the Department of State 
formally express its reservation on neo-fascist parties' 
participation in government in Europe. A participation -- it is 
feared -- which could even portend autarchic and racist policies. 
<H5>  Domestic Affairs </H5>
  More wary than the European Parliament, the U.S. 
Administration wishes to maintain its doctrine of 
"noninterference" in European domestic affairs. With respect to 
Italy, professed support of the Berlusconi government would, on 
principle, rule out political hostility toward its allies. But 
Clinton cannot neglect the demands of his own electorate. 
  With all due distinctions, the debate in the United States 
on 
the recrudescence of fascism in Europe reminds one of the terms 
in which the debate on communist expansion was couched at the 
end of the war. The question which the administration is asking 
is if, and when, it will have to come out with a doctrine of 
containment of fascism, just as half a century ago it enunciated 
a doctrine of the containment of communism. 
  For the time being, Clinton prefers to stick to symbols. The 
significance of his pilgrimage to the World War II battlefields, 
culminating with the 6 June anniversary of the Normandy 
landings, is clear. And it would a good idea for Europeans to 
take note of that symbolic meaning: It will be a celebration of 
democratic and anti-Nazi values. In this sense, if Italy fails 
to come up to expectations, the American Administration could 
feel itself constrained to make its voice heard. The latter 
sees in the neofascist temptations throughout Europe, from 
France to Russia, not only a factor of destabilization, but also 
a possible motive for collision between authoritarian and 
democratic market regimes. Five months ago White House Security 
Advisor Anthony Lake proclaimed America's faith in European 
democracy's "solid kernel": France, Germany, and Britain. Next 
June Clinton wishes to reaffirm this. 
<H5>  Limited Circulation Memorandum </H5>
  But already on the eve of the Italian elections the question 
of containing fascism was touched on in a limited-circulation 
memorandum issued by the State Department. Thus the U.S. 
Administration's present attitude is not a sign of neutrality 
but an implicit call to West Europe to engage in the solemn task 
of pushing back extremists (from both right and left). 
  It is unlikely that, in the coming months, America will 
allow 
itself to become involved in European political battles, neither 
publicly nor in the undercover manner of the Cold War. For the 
moment the opinion still prevails that the crisis in Europe -- 
and in Italy -- is the first sign of a new assertion of 
democracy. And that the Berlusconi experiment is worthy of 
respect. But on another point America has clear ideas: The 
return of fascism in Europe would constitute a danger for its 
own national security as well. And on this point, it could not 
remain indifferent.

<F P=106> [Jose Antich report: "Pujol Supports a Socialist Government </F>
of `Regeneration'"] 
  [Text] Barcelona -- The climate of widespread political 
crisis requires a government of "regeneration" comprising 
heavyweights from the "PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] 
and independents," not the current government of "under 
secretaries" that has been ruling Spain since last 6 June. The 
president of the Generalitat [autonomous community of 
Catalonia], Jordi Pujol, maintains in his many contacts with the 
government leadership that this is the key in undertaking the 
drastic remedy which the current situation requires. "Anything 
that is not like this, or similar to it, will make general 
elections inevitable," Pujol commented. 
  Jordi Pujol does not ask for anyone to resign, at least not 
publicly. His position reaches to the very top of the 
government and claims to protect Felipe Gonzalez from opposition 
attacks, primarily from the People's Party and the United Left 
[IU], but also, according to some of his collaborators, from the 
government ranks. 
  Yesterday, Pujol came out against the People's Party and IU 
proposal calling for Felipe Gonzalez's resignation if the 
Socialists are to form a new government. "Such a government 
would be more fragile than one led by Gonzalez," Pujol argued. 
Pujol feels that bringing the elections forward in order to get 
out of the current situation of "confusion and commotion," would 
be a "fiasco." "At this time, elections are neither a logical 
solution nor the best one," Pujol said yesterday morning at the 
Barcelona stock exchange, speaking to several hundred 
businessmen. 
  In the afternoon, Pujol stressed that the CiU [Convergence 
and Union] was continuing to support the government because the 
only alternative would be to call new elections. "There is no 
other alternative, either arithmetically or politically, to our 
policy but to call elections," at which point he said, "the time 
has not yet come." Pujol reiterated that, given that there are 
to be elections in Andalusia and European elections, the general 
elections could not be held within the next six months. 
  Pujol, who said everything in the conditional tense, 
repeated 
his thesis that if there is not a quick reaction from the 
government regarding the corruption problem, the political 
situation could make it advisable to call elections. 
  Although he said that we cannot know what will happen in the 
coming months, he emphasized that preventing the elections from 
being moved forward is up to "the ruling party, which has the 
parliamentary seats and the power." He added that the country's 
ability to be governed "does not depend on the CiU, which, in 
any case, plays a complementary role." 
  Pujol, who affirmed that the "responsibility of a politician 
is put to the test during the tough times, like the current 
period," appealed to the government to "calmly" tackle the 
current political crisis.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Gonzalez's Government Crumbling: </F>
Tide of Corruption Brings Down Agriculture Minister"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- Felipe Gonzalez will try today to curb the 
disintegration of the government over the corruption cases by 
means of a reshuffle involving two ministries (Interior and 
Agriculture) and the acceptance of Carlos Solchaga's resignation 
as parliamentary spokesman. Gonzalez intends to show in this 
way that "we will go all the way, no matter who falls" and to 
close the political crisis opened by the Roldan and Rubio cases. 
These decisions satisfy the demands of Jordi Pujol who, after 
rejecting another coalition offer Monday [2 May], warned 
Gonzalez yesterday that an early election would be inevitable 
unless he acts quickly. 
  Two resignations in five days. First it was Antoni Asuncion, 
Saturday, over the "Roldan case." Then came Vicente Albero 
yesterday, over tax irregularities and connections with the 
office of Manuel de la Concha, the same one used by Mariano 
Rubio. The announcement of Albero's resignation fell like a 
thunderbolt yesterday in the midst of the political storm that 
has been rocking the country for several weeks, though Felipe 
Gonzalez will try today to take the opportunity to begin a 
"recovery." 
  Since the escape last Friday of Luis Roldan, former director 
general of the Civil Guard, Felipe Gonzalez has been immersed in 
the most serious political crisis since he became prime minister 
in 1983 -- a crisis which, rather than abating, has grown in 
intensity in the past few days. Nevertheless, despite the 
disintegration of the government caused by the corruption cases, 
Gonzalez intends to close the crisis today by appointing 
replacements for both ministers and by announcing his acceptance 
of Carlos Solchaga's resignation as parliamentary spokesman over 
his political responsibility in the "Rubio case." 
  Agriculture Minister Vicente Albero yesterday announced his 
resignation over "fiscal negligence" with regard to the correct 
procedure for treasury bonds found in Manuel de la Concha's 
office. As he explained at a news conference, in 1983 he sold 
his shares in Marie Claire (textiles), payment for part of which 
he received in the form of mortgage bonds which he deposited 
with De la Concha, as a stock exchange trustee, and which he did 
not declare. Worried that this might affect the government's 
image, Albero said: "I am one of the people that have 
sacrificed their professional lives to devote themselves to 
politics, and this has entailed economic sacrifices for me and 
my family, but now, more than ever, openness is demanded on the 
part of politicians," Cristina de la Hoz reports. 
  This resignation has forced Felipe Gonzalez to carry out a 
more extensive reshuffle that he initially envisaged. After 
receiving Albero in his office yesterday morning, the prime 
minister informed his majesty the king of the changes he will 
make, which he will explain to the media today. 
  Government sources indicated yesterday that Interior 
Minister 
Antonio Asuncion, who resigned Saturday over his "negligence" in 
Roldan's custody, may be replaced by another minister (Juan 
Manuel Eguiagaray or Juan Alberto Belloch) or by someone else 
from outside the government, which would enable Gonzalez to 
reduce the number of changes to two. 
  Although Eguiagaray's move would interrupt the work that he 
has begun at the Industry Ministry, which is crucial to economic 
activity, and although he is not liked by the PNV [Basque 
Nationalist Party], despite his Basque origins, he is the 
favorite candidate of the State Security Forces on account of 
his past connections with the antiterrorist struggle. 
Furthermore, he enjoys good relations not only with Gonzalez 
but also with Deputy Prime Minister Narcis Serra and is a member 
of the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] Executive 
Committee. 
  According to government sources, one of the new interior 
minister's essential tasks will be "to reorganize" the Interior 
Ministry following the scandals over the award of contracts and 
the use of reserved funds, and at the same time to ensure the 
continuation of the antiterrorist struggle. 
  At the same time, Carlos Solchaga's resignation as 
parliamentary spokesman will oblige Gonzalez to provide other 
replacements. Sources within the Socialist Group indicate former 
Minister Joaquin Almunia as the most likely replacement for 
Solchaga, though this would force Gonzalez to seek a replacement 
for him in the PSOE Executive Committee, in which he occupies 
the post of research and planning secretary. According to 
Socialist sources, Gonzalez will have to seek a "renewal 
heavyweight" to fill the post. 
  In the midst of this crisis, the president of the Catalonian 
Generalidad and Gonzalez's chief partner, Felipe Gonzalez [as 
published; should read Jordi Pujol], warned him yesterday that 
unless he acted quickly and vigorously, an early election would 
be inevitable. However, sources within the CiU [Convergence and 
Union] leadership indicated that Pujol does not want this to 
happen, and that he also rejects a PSOE-CiU coalition government. 
  The CiU leader reaffirmed this rejection Monday at his 
meeting with Deputy Prime Minister Narcis Serra, who conveyed to 
him another offer from Gonzalez to this effect. However, 
Pujol's rejection of such an agreement remains so strong that, 
according to Socialist sources, he hardly allowed Serra even to 
finish suggesting the possibility to him before resolutely 
rejecting the idea that Gonzalez submit himself to a confidence 
motion, since it would force him to be formally associated with 
the prime minister, though he demands that the latter remain in 
his post. 
  The main political trump card that Felipe Gonzalez has to 
play at present is the obvious fact that none of the parties -- 
from CiU through the People's Party -- wants an early election 
now, though this trump card could eventually turn against him.

<F P=106> ["J.R." report: "Anguita Challenges Nationalists To Get </F>
Involved in Confidence Vote"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- Demanding that he resign immediately was 
the nicest thing that Julio Anguita said to Felipe Gonzalez 
yesterday. The general coordinator of the United Left (IU) 
called an emergency press conference two hours after the prime 
minister's appearance. Anguita accused Gonzalez of being 
"Spain's biggest problem" today. 
  The IU leader demanded that the prime minister call a 
confidence vote in parliament and that the Catalan and Basque 
nationalists use that opportunity to dare to maintain support 
for the government and "take on their share of the blame for 
maintaining this state of corruption." 
  The IU coordinator felt that Gonzalez's statements 
maintaining that both the president of Catalonia, Jordi Pujol, 
and the leader of the PNV [Basque Nationalist Party], Xabier 
Arzalluz, are continuing to support him cannot remain 
unanswered. For Anguita, it is preciseley as an exercise in 
democracy and transparency that the parliamentary 
representatives of both nationalist leaders should demonstrate 
their support in the confidence vote. "Let it be clear whether 
or not they support him and let them brave the consequences of 
their support in a debate," the IU leader said. 
  Anguita feels that Gonzalez is responsible for practically 
everything: unemployment, economic ruin, a policy of nonsense 
and flight from reality, the ideology of the "pelotazo," 
society's lack of ideals and, lastly, for being the "person most 
responsible for the corruption." The IU leader feels that the 
press conference offered Gonzalez a leader's rendezvous "with 
his dignity and the future of his country." Given the outcome 
of the prime minister's speech, which Anguita followed on the 
television next to the staff at his office, "this rendezvous has 
been neither a drama nor a tragedy; it has become grotesque," he 
said. 
  Anguita cannot repeat his demand that Gonzalez resign every 
day, although he will raise the matter again next Wednesday in 
parliament, when the prime minister appears. For him, as long 
as Felipe Gonzalez is the head of government, "this request will 
not be withdrawn."

<F P=106> [De Azua report: "People's Party Says Gonzalez Statement a </F>
Farce and Accuse Him of Entrenchment"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- "Farce," "joke," and "leg-pull." The 
People's Party spokesmen spared no adjectives on the telephone 
after 1215 GMT when [Prime Minister] Felipe Gonzalez's news 
conference ended. Since the middle of the morning, [People's 
Party leader] Jose Maria Aznar had canceled his planned 
appearances in Pamplona and Valladolid yesterday and today so 
that he could closely follow the development of the political 
crisis. During the evening he gave his reaction and called a 
press conference for today. 
  Aznar, and the People's Party's leaders who followed the 
conference closely, concluded that Gonzalez was deceiving 
popular opinion because he had not taken a single initiative to 
stop the political crisis or to attack its causes, the growing 
climate of corruption. Sources close to the People's Party 
leader said: "He limited himself to accepting the avalanche of 
resignations, plugging the gaps, and carrying on as if nothing 
will happen." 
  The party's general secretary, Francisco Alvarez Cascos, 
then 
stated that Aznar's demand that Gonzalez resign two weeks ago 
and give up the prime ministership to another socialist capable 
of clearing up the situation "is now more even justified than 
then, because things have become worse, Roldan has escaped, 
Albero has resigned, Rubio and De la Concha are in jail, and two 
other ministers have had to give up their seats." 
  He added: "Nobody knows to what new scandal we will be 
sitting down to tonight or waking up to tomorrow morning, while 
Gonzalez can only offer continuity and entrenchment in La 
Moncloa [the prime minister's residence). He is insisting on 
defending the Maginot line while the Germans have long been 
occupying Paris." 
  For the People's Party leadership, the Catalan nationalists 
of the Convergence and Union party [CiU] have made themselves 
equally responsible by helping to keep Gonzalez in power. 
Alvarez Cascos stated: "They are not supporting stability but 
supporting maximum instability and ensuring the continued 
presence of the main obstacle to political stability in Spain -- 
keeping Gonzalez in power for personal reasons." 
  The People's Party are moreover rejecting the dialogue 
proposed yesterday by the prime minister, which they consider a 
"an offering to the sun." According to Alvarez Cascos, Aznar 
will not fall into the trap when it has been clear that the last 
meetings, which led to the "democratic stimulus" conversations, 
"were frustrated by socialist intransigence" and by the attempt 
to impose conditions on the investigating committees that would 
have prevented them from unmasking the former director of the 
Guardia Civil, Luis Roldan.

<F P=106> [Aurora Intxausti report: "Arzalluz Warns of People's </F>
Party's Scheme To Overthrow Gonzalez and Rough Up His Successor"] 
  [Text] San Sebastian -- Yesterday Basque Nationalist Party 
[PNV] chairman Xabier Arzalluz stated that he was not prepared 
to cooperate with the People's Party in the strategy to 
overthrow Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez. "The People's Party 
is aiming to overthrow Gonzalez. It does not want elections 
now, it wants Gonzalez to resign and another Socialist to 
replace him, so that they can rough him up nicely for a year, 
then hold general elections and obtain an absolute majority." 
Arzalluz believes that this strategy by the People's Party is 
no good for either the Basque or the Catalan nationalists. "It 
is no good for the country, nor for us nationalists," he said. 
  Arzalluz, who met Gonzalez last Wednesday at the Moncloa 
palace, stated that the purpose of the meeting had been to 
analyze the political situation, and that no agreements or 
common plans had been reached. The PNV's leader denied, in this 
connection, that Gonzalez had suggested forming a coalition 
government including the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers' 
Party], the PNV, and CiU [Convergence and Union]. 
  The "lehendakari" Jos Antonio Ardanza explained this aspect 
further, stating that no changes had occurred in the last eight 
months to warrant the PNV's joining the government. 
<H5>  The Confidence Issue </H5>
  Contrary to what a number of opposition parties are 
requesting, Xabier Arzalluz believes that Felipe Gonzalez need 
not submit to a vote of confidence. "I believe Gonzalez does 
enjoy people's confidence, because in fact the people have 
ratified their trust in him. Technically speaking, it makes no 
sense for him to propose a confidence vote; rather, it is the 
opposition who must table a no- confidence motion," he stated. 
The PNV chairman said he was convinced that the government was 
doing everything in its power to arrest the Guardia Civil former 
director Luis Roldan, and he believed that the corruption issue 
was being used as an easy argument for demagogic purposes. 
  Despite these supportive statements, the "lehendakari" 
confirmed that his party's relations with the PSOE, the central 
government, and the socialists had not improved over the last 
few months. "Eight months ago -- for the reasons we explained at 
the time -- we were not able to reach an understanding, but the 
truth is that things have not improved." 
  "Eight months ago," he added, "we stated that seven years 
had 
gone by without any new responsibilities being transferred. 
Today we can say that very soon eight years will have gone by 
and still nothing has changed." 
  Ardanza then said curtly: "The Socialist government's 
situation has not improved either, and these are the objective 
data." "Yesterday (Wednesday -- EL PAIS editor's note), seeing 
how events were snowballing, I pointed to the urgent need for 
the captain of this ship named the Spanish Government to face up 
to the situation that has been created," he concluded.

<F P=106> [News conference including statement by Prime Minister </F>
Tsutomu Hata with foreign and domestic correspondents at the 
Hilton Hotel in Brussels; questioners identified by caption -- 
live] 
  [Text] I have toured Italy, France, and Germany, and have 
met with top leaders of these countries. Just now I had the 
honor of being received by King Albert. This evening I am due 
to meet with EC Chairman Delors and Belgian Prime Minister 
Dehaene. 
  Never in history has there been a time when cooperation 
between Europe, Japan, and the United States is as necessary as 
it is now for securing peace and prosperity in the world. 
Further strengthening of ties between Japan and Europe is an 
important diplomatic task of the new administration. 
  Seeing as Japan wants to make international contributions, 
there are now many developments taking place in Middle East, 
Africa, and East Europe. I have visited this place to talk with 
European people, who have deep ties and long experiences with 
these regions. 
  In Italy, the first country I visited, I was able to 
exchange 
views on cooperation with respect to the Naples summit. While I 
myself face the task of reforming politics in Japan, in Italy 
major reform is currently underway, reform which can be called a 
quiet revolution. I had the opportunity to meet Prime Minister 
Ciampi, who initiated political reform, and [Belurusconi], who 
won in the recent general election. I also had the chance to 
talk about our experience as well as the tasks awaiting both 
countries. 
  In France and Germany, which are the two major bulwarks 
pushing for integration of Europe I was able to meet with 
President Mitterand, Prime Minister Balladur, and Chancellor 
Kohl. I greatly benefited from an exchange of views with them 
on pending international issues from the perspective of thinking 
about the future policies of our country and of affirming the 
relationship between Japan and Europe in the international 
community. 
  We agreed that our nations should make efforts to further 
strengthen the world's free trade structure. We also agreed 
that indeed it would be important, with respect to the Naples 
summit, for our countries to announce their common resolve on 
tackling unemployment. 
  I would like to express my welcome to EC Chairman Delors, 
who 
is an active promoter for establishing the European Union [EU], 
on the realization of a powerful and stable EU as a step forward 
toward raising the status of Europe in the international 
community. On the other hand, I would like to point out that it 
is important that the EU build an open and constructive 
atmosphere for Japan and other countries outside the Union as 
well. 
  Myself, Foreign Minister Kakizawa, and several others for 
the 
past 16 to 17 years have promoted relations between Japan and 
Europe as well as between the Japanese and European parliaments. 
I would like to exchange views with Delors on what I have 
learned during these years. 
  Meanwhile, I am looking forward to the meeting with Prime 
Minister Dehaene, as I hope to hear from him how the Belgian 
Government intends to seek and pursue further development of the 
country while pushing for European integration. 
  Besides, Belgium plans to send an economic mission led by 
Prince Philip to Japan. I hope new relations will develop out 
of this. 
  In the meetings with the leaders I met on this tour, I 
explained Japan's political, economic, and administrative reform 
programs, which can be called historical. Particularly in the 
area of economics, I explained that domestic demand-oriented 
economic operations would be continued pursuant to the 
guidelines on reform of external economy announced on 29 March 
by the Hosokawa government. Actions to enforce deregulation 
will also continue, I explained. 
  There can never be any agreements made between Japan and the 
United States at the expense of the EU. I informed them clearly 
that all agreements would benefit the EU and other nations. 
  There are now moves in many European countries to 
invigorate economic relations with Japan. Our country welcomes 
such moves, and would like to provide cooperation where 
possible. I think we should seek to find a point of equilibrium 
in economic relations between Japan and Europe--not at a reduced 
but on an expanded scale. 
  By coincidence, the opening ceremonies for the tunnel 
underneath the British Channel were held today. This is a 
historic and symbolic event which suggests strengthening 
European ties. 
  For my part, I am hoping to see strengthened relations 
between a stable and prosperous Europe and Japan, and am sure my 
visit to Europe will be a new step towards that. 
  In my meeting today with King Albert, he expressed a strong 
hope to further strengthen and develop relations between Europe 
and Japan, as well as between Belgium and Japan. I was deeply 
impressed by his words. 
  Finally, I would like to note that I am very grateful for 
the 
warm welcome given by the people of this country, the royal 
court, and the government, even though my visit was short. 
  I would like to conclude my statement. 
  [Terasaki] I am Terasaki from NHK. Please excuse me for 
asking a question not directly linked to your Europe trip. 
Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano has recently stated he believes 
the so-called Nanjing massacre is a fabrication, and this 
aroused considerable controversy not only in Japan, but also 
overseas, even in Europe. In a news conference held later, 
Justice Minister Nagano stated he wants to completely recant the 
remark and adhere to the prime minister's decision whether or 
not he has to resign. I would like to ask, what is your plan to 
settle the issue. Also, please let me ask your comment about 
your responsibility for appointing such a justice minister. 
  [Hata] Contrary to the remark by Justice Minister Nagano, 
both the previous administration and I have been acknowledging 
Japan's invasion and colonial rule during the war. During that 
period, Japan inflicted unbearable suffering and sorrow on the 
people of many countries. To obtain the international 
community's understanding of Japan's future posture, Japan must 
frankly express its regret over the wrongdoing and apologize for 
it. Japan must not forget its past experience and must not 
repeat the tragedy, and on that ground we appealed to the 
international community our intention to contribute to 
peacemaking efforts. The international community has expressed 
its understanding of our resolve, and leaders of some nations 
told us that, apart from past incidents, they welcome Japan's 
present stance. They said they want future-oriented cooperation 
with Japan. Justice Minister Nagano's remarks were not 
appropriate. Frankly speaking, I feel his remark was 
regrettable. 
  Immediately after I heard about his remark, I called Justice 
Minister Nagano in Tokyo to discuss the issue. I told him I 
deeply regretted that his remark spoiled our efforts up to now, 
and questioned why he made it. In reply to my warning, he 
acknowledged the inappropriateness of the remark and expressed 
his intention to withdraw it. He also said he felt really sorry 
about hurting the sentiments of many people. 
  I appointed Nagano as justice minister because, through long 
fellowship with him, I knew him as a person with a noble mind 
and well-balanced political stand. I am not well informed about 
the actual circumstances surrounding the remark, but I would 
like to attach importance to his apology. Taking this 
opportunity, my cabinet will take the initiative in obtaining an 
understanding from the international community. As I noted 
earlier, my trip to meet with European leaders was made to 
strengthen cooperative ties with the people of Europe in 
pursuing genuine world peace. In this sense, we would like to 
prove our resolve with our actions, seeking support from the 
international community. 
  [Charles (Bortzman), in English with superimposed 
translation 
in Japanese] I am Charles (Bortzman) from the WALL STREET 
JOURNAL. The European Union is still anxious about trade 
deficits with Japan. What is your tangible plan for reducing 
Japan's trade surplus? What is EC President Jacques Delors 
supposed to do about removing trade barriers with Japan? 
  [Hata] As regards your first question, Japan will continue 
to take macro and micro measures to deal with its current 
account surplus. The trade balance is calculated as a result of 
various business activities under a free economy; however, if 
one nation has a huge current account surplus, it would be 
problematic. The problem results from many nations. To cut 
Japan's current account surplus, the government will relax or 
abolish the bureaucratic regulations and take steps to make it 
easier for foreign firms to gain access to the Japanese market. 
This was incorporated in my 29 March statement, and the 
government has already announced its decision to clarify its 
future direction of economic policies before the end of June. 
Under such circumstances, I intend to work to significantly cut 
Japan's current account surplus. 
  Regarding desirable action by the EU or the EC, many 
European 
nations are trying to promote exports to Japan by creating a 
better understanding of the needs of the Japanese consumer 
market. Japan would like to offer support for market access of 
products with adequate competitive power, and I hope the EU 
continue its efforts in offering good export products. 
  [Kurimoto] I am Kurimoto from KYODO. I am very sorry to 
trouble you, but I would like to return to Nagano's remarks. 
You stated earlier you would like to accept his withdrawal of 
the remarks and his serious apology, and would like to show 
Japan's stance through future actions. Do you mean that, as far 
as you are concerned, you have no intention to ask the justice 
minister to resign? 
  [Hata] At the present stage, I would like to refrain from 
making any comment on his resignation. As I said earlier, 
Nagano is a man who sees things fairly, and he has candidly 
apologized for making such remarks. I intend to seek an 
understanding of concerned nations. My government is now 
explaining our true intent to the concerned nations through 
their embassies in Tokyo. Through these efforts, I would like 
the concerned nations to understand Justice Minister Nagano as 
well as my cabinet. In any case, we should not talk 
insincerely. It is important for Japan to work to build peace 
while engaging in soul-searching on its war of aggression. 
Presently this is our stance. 
  [Tom Berkeley, in English with superimposed translation in 
Japanese] I am Tom Berkeley from HERALD TRIBUNE. You mentioned 
Japan will take measures to open its markets to the United 
States and the EU. Do You intend to solve the issue of U.S. and 
European trade deficits with Japan through the fiscal 1994 
budget and market-opening measures to be issued in June? If you 
do not have such an intention, why is it? 
  [Hata] I have received some requests from the EU. I intend 
to reflect the requests in a package of external economic 
measures to be mapped out in June. You mentioned the solution 
of the trade issue among the three parties. However, Japan and 
the United States have been discussing the issue for a long 
time, and we are now trying to pave a way for solving the issue. 
I do not mean we are not taking these matters you mentioned 
into consideration, but presently we intend to discuss it 
between Japan and the United States. Any agreement reached 
between Japan and the United States should be applied to the EU 
and other nations. We intend to do so based on the principle of 
the most-favored-nation treatment. However, various measures 
which we are now taking have reflected EU opinions. Moreover, 
we are now proceeding with a committee on administrative reform, 
and representatives from the European private sector will 
participate in the committee. 
  [Unidentified AP DOW JONES NEWS SERVICE correspondent, in 
English with superimposed translation in Japanese] I am with 
the AP DOW JONES NEWS SERVICE. Earlier this week, central banks 
from Europe jointly intervened in the foreign exchange market to 
prevent a further decline of the dollar. In connection with 
this, are you satisfied with the current level of the yen 
against the dollar? What will you do if the dollar drops to 
below 100 yen? 
  [Hata] I believe that the exchange rate must reflect 
economic fundamentals. While mid- and long-term prime rates are 
increasing in the United States, the recent appreciation of the 
yen and the mark is too rapid and drastic. It appears the 
market is excessively dominated with a speculative atmosphere. 
Japan intends to deal with the recent fluctuation in currency 
markets while discussing the currency authorities of other 
industrialized nations. With regard to the strength of specific 
currencies, I would like to avoid comment since that may 
stimulate speculative moves in the market. However, I think 
drastic moves in the foreign exchange market are unfavorable. 
  [Kojima] I am Kojima from SANKEI SHIMBUN. My question is 
about Japan's desire to obtain a permanent seat in the UN 
Security Council [UNSC]. In the latest meeting with French 
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, you reportedly said Japan would 
offer all possible contributions if it is given a permanent UNSC 
seat. I would like to ask what all possible contributions means 
exactly. In this connection, I would also like to ask if Japan, 
as a nation seeking a permanent UNSC seat, is ready to fully 
participate in UN peacekeeping activities and possible sanctions 
against North Korea. 
  [Hata] Japan has already played a role that is consistent 
for a permanent member of the UN Security Council. Japan is 
offering wide-ranging contributions to international peace 
efforts. For example, Japan is the second largest contributor 
to the United Nations, following the United States. To settle 
regional disputes, Japan took the initiative in peacemaking and 
reconstruction efforts in Cambodia. Regarding disarmament and 
arms nonproliferation efforts, Japan is advocating an indefinite 
extension of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and an 
establishment of a registration system to control ordinary 
weapons. The primary concern of economic assistance to Russia 
and developing nations is to stabilize the social situation of 
these nations. Japan intends to positively contribute to UN 
peace activities, as it has already offered manpower to UN 
operations in Cambodia and Mozambique. 
  Many nations have clarified their support for Japan's 
permanent membership in the UNSC, and I believe this is because 
they highly rate Japan's efforts so far. Therefore, it is 
important for Japan to do everything it can, stressing its 
strong points. Even in UN peace activities, Japan can 
contribute in various ways, and in some fields Japan may be the 
only nation which can help the United Nations. We would like to 
positively support the United Nations. 
  The issue of North Korea's suspected development of nuclear 
weapons has been taken up for discussion during a series of 
meetings with European leaders and I keenly feel that those 
leaders are concerned about the issue. The UNSC has issued a 
presidential statement representing the international 
community's demand for an early settlement of the issue, and I 
positively support the UNSC message. North Korea should work to 
dispel suspicions about its development of nuclear weapons to 
win an international understanding. North Korea needs to take 
such an action to develop itself. The international community 
is patiently seeking a consultative settlement of the problem, 
and I hope the North Korean people understand that. I want to 
take every opportunity to obtain North Korea's understanding of 
that. 
  [Unidentified Belgian correspondent, in English with 
superimposed translation in Japanese] I am with a Belgian 
newspaper, and want to discuss the nuclear issue. Japan itself 
has a large amount of plutonium, for commercial use of course. 
In a sense, it can be said Japan's plutonium program is as 
important as the North Korean nuclear issue. Do you have any 
plans to voluntarily abolish your nation's own plutonium 
recycling program before 1995 when the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty [NPT] expires? 
  [Hata] To state a conclusion first, there is no possibility 
of Japan producing nuclear weapons or being armed with nuclear 
weapons. Japan underwent hardships after atomic bombs were 
dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In its Constitution, Japan's 
Article Nine renounces war. In addition, Japan has the three 
principle of not producing, possessing, or bringing in nuclear 
weapons. But since there is a nation [DPRK] that has nuclear 
weapons, I intend, while firmly maintaining the Japan-U.S. 
Security Treaty, to ensure Japan's peace using the potential 
U.S. deterrent force, including nuclear weapons. As for our 
plutonium program, in the true sense of the term it is for 
peaceful purposes. As you know, Japan is short of natural 
resources while needing to secure stable supplies of energy. It 
is highly important for the international community to make 
effective use of natural resources, or in view of protecting the 
environment we are required to use cleaner energy. This is what 
we are required to do. In this sense Japan, while making use of 
plutonium, will proceed with its plutonium recycling program for 
peaceful purposes. Although there is suspicion about Japan's 
nuclear program, Japan has extensively concluded safeguard 
agreements with the International Atomic Energy Agency. At the 
same time, Japan has committed itself to support an indefinite 
extension of the NPT. In this sense, Japan has been studying 
how to use nuclear material for peaceful purposes. However, the 
openness of such a study should be increased as much as possible. 
  [Yasui] I am Yasui with NHK. My question is about permanent 
membership in the UNSC. The UN Charter says the Military Staff 
Committee will be held among the permanent members of the UNSC 
in order to take strategic leadership when UN forces are 
organized. Does this run counter to Japan's Constitution? In 
addition, although it has been reported that Japan and Germany 
have agreed to keep in constant contact with each other in their 
bids to win permanent membership, are you planning to promote a 
Japan-Germany link in dealing with this issue? Please answer 
these two questions. 
  [Hata] Yes, the UN Charter calls for the opening of the 
committee. The committee session is an opportunity to discuss 
how they should respond to various local strife, and is not to 
endorse the permanent members' participation in military action. 
As UN Secretary General Ghali has said, the permanent members 
are not bound to military action. He has said the positions of 
the permanent members are the same as other UN member nations. 
It is important for the permanent members to take the 
initiative in carrying out what they can do, such as 
peacekeeping operations. Regarding my talks with Kinkel, I have 
agreed that Japan and Germany will exchange various information 
in a bid to win permanent membership. In view of Germany's 
position in Europe and Japan's in Asia, there are some 
differences in their respective positions. It is important to 
exchange information. 
  [Unidentified FINANCIAL NEWS correspondent, in English with 
superimposed translation in Japanese] Prime Minister, I am with 
FINANCIAL NEWS. Japan plans to carry out economic reform along 
with other G-7 member nations. For example, Japan claims it 
intends to continue carrying out income tax reductions even 
after fiscal 1994. I wonder if the opposition will accept such a 
plan, and I want to ask how the government will deal with the 
issue of a consumption tax increase designed to offset tax 
reductions. 
  [Hata] On this matter, the government will carry out Y [yen] 
6 billion-worth of income tax reductions. But if we limit this 
tax reduction only to 1994, we will have to increase taxes next 
year. In that case, Japan's economy will be greatly affected. 
Japan is about to enter an era of an aging society. 
Administrative and financial reform designed to improve such 
policies as pension and welfare, as well as the correction of 
unfair tax systems, are not enough to secure financial resources 
in preparation for the future. Moreover, it is difficult to 
obtain financial resources from direct taxes upon workers of the 
younger generation. In view of this, we have to balance further 
tax reductions with the securing of direct taxes and consumption 
taxes in preparation for the impending era. There is no doubt 
that among the opposition parties there are voices opposing such 
a plan. But within the largest opposition party, some members 
have shown an understanding of the plan, and the parties which 
have recently left the coalition have agreed to exchange frank 
discussions on this issue. There is also the fact that a 
resolution has been recently adopted unanimously in the Diet on 
carrying out drastic reform of taxes--we call them direct taxes 
in Japan. No, the tax system. In view of this, I am of the 
opinion it is possible to win national consensus. 
  [Yamada] I am Yamada from TV Asahi. The existing 
coalition is a minority government. Parties like Sakigake 
[Harbinger] are cautious about Japan becoming a permanent member 
of the UN Security Council. Meanwhile, in interviews given by 
newly appointed cabinet members, we have heard them make 
statements critical of the Social Democratic Party of Japan 
[SDPJ]. It appears the cabinet will have a hard time in the 
Diet. Meanwhile, a prevailing view about the Hata government is 
that it will be hawkish. How do you intend to deal with this? 
  [Hata] First, is this prime minister a hawk or dove? I 
would like you to look at my past 25 years of political life. 
People in Japan like to use the expression hawk or dove. But 
this indeed is nonsense. 
  What is at issue is what to do with Japan, what we should do 
to bring peace to the world, and what Japan should do to enjoy 
the world's peace. The tendency to group people into hawks and 
doves is nonsense. 
  I served as foreign minister for eight months with the 
Hosokawa government, and worked in that government along with 
people from the SDPJ. It is good the SDPJ people have come to 
openly present their positions on security issues and the tax 
system. A new pattern of governance is taking place. 
  We have come to speak more about the opening of information 
to the public, consumer interests, and giving more weight to the 
lives of the people. We also speak about or act against 
environmental issues more than before. 
  This has been possible because people of different parties 
can work together. We have come to appreciate varying views of 
the people as a result. of this. 
  I am aware there have been misunderstandings and differences 
of opinion between the SDPJ and other coalition groups, but I 
have emphasized to the chairman and the general secretary of the 
party that we should make the most of this experience of having 
worked together. I have told them that our door remains open, 
and that we sincerely want them to return to the government and 
work together. 
  If we are serious about beginning a new governance in Japan, 
it will be necessary that we keep the position of leaving the 
door open for the party to come back to work together. 
  You referred to the issue of Japan becoming a permanent 
member of the UN Security Council. We are not seeking to become 
a permanent member of the council in order to do extraordinary 
things. 
  The United Nations began with 51 countries, and has now 
grown 
to an organization of 184 nations. In the present post-Cold War 
era, there are many things the United Nations needs to do. 
  Japan's role in Cambodia was different from the one played 
in 
other countries, and our efforts there were successful because 
we were able to convince the Cambodians that it is good to have 
peace and to hold elections. Japan has enjoyed peace for the 
past 50 years, and has been able to accumulate all kinds of 
knowledge. Japan is now being asked by the world to do its part 
as a permanent member of the UN Security Council and to make the 
most of what it has learned. 
  That is how I see the matter. I believe Takemura and others 
are not objecting to this view. [coverage of the program breaks

  [Text] Brussels, May 6 KYODO -- Japanese Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata reaffirmed Friday [6 May] that Japan will push 
ahead with efforts to further promote economic deregulation to 
open its markets to foreign competition, Japanese officials said. 
  Hata told European Commission President Jacques Delors that 
Japan will accelerate economic deregulation as it is strongly 
urged by the United States and the European Union (EU) to give 
them sufficient access to Japanese markets. 
  Delors expressed his hopes for Japan's efforts on the issue, 
saying the EU will watch the situation with serious interest. 
  European Commission sources, meanwhile, said that Hata and 
Delors agreed to hold a meeting of experts within several weeks 
to discuss a final approach to the issue. 
  The sources also said the two sides are considering holding 
a 
delayed ministerial conference on May 28 and summit sessions of 
both sides on trade on July 12 in Bonn, right after the July 
8-10 summit of the Group of Seven economic powers in Naples, 
Italy. 
  On the Naples summit, Hata said that priority should be 
placed on employment problems, as well as assistance to 
developing countries, noting advanced countries are "tired" of 
giving help to those countries. 
  In the meeting that lasted about two hours on the final leg 
of Hata's trip to four European countries, Delors also urged 
Japan to offer help to the peace process in the Middle East. He 
said streamlining the social infrastructure, such as water and 
energy supplies, is crucial to promoting the peace process. 
  After meeting with Delors, the Japanese premier held talks 
with Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, concluding his 
six-day journey to Italy, France, Germany and Belgium chiefly 
aimed at establishing personal rapport with European leaders 
ahead of the Naples summit. 
  Hata left here for home after the meetings. He was elected 
prime minister on April 25.

  [Text] Vienna, May 10 (AFP) -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency warned Monday [9 May] that it could take its 
dispute with North Korea to the United Nations Security Council 
if Pyongyang peristed in serious violations of a nuclear 
inspections accord. 
  David Kyd, spokesman for the nuclear watchdog body, said 
such 
a step would be taken if, for instance, the North Koreans 
removed seals placed on nuclear fuel rods by IAEA inspection 
teams. 
  The rods are due to be changed in a five megawatt reactor in 
North Korea's Yongbyon complex, and the IAEA wants its 
inspectors there to ensure that nuclear material has not been 
diverted for military purposes. 
  Pyongyang is resisting the IAEA's conditions, and Kyd said 
its latest reply in an exchange of messages on the subject, 
received last Friday, was unsatisfactory. 
  The United States has warned that if North Korea does not 
cooperate in satisfying the international community that it is 
not developing nuclear weapons Washington would seek sanctions 
against it in the Security Council. 
  North Korea has said it would treat such a measure as an act 
of war.

  [Text] Brussels, May 9 (AFP) -- Nearly two million people 
are facing famine in Rwanda and Burundi and humanitarian workers 
are struggling to feed refugees, the Catholic aid organisation 
Caritas International said here Monday [9 May]. 
  Caritas spokesman Jean-Paul Evrard said the two Central 
African nations faced starvation on a scale exceeding the 
famines in Somalia and Ethiopia in recent years. 
  "We have the money to buy food, but there is virtually 
nothing to buy (in Rwanda and neighbouring Burundi)," he told a 
press conference. 
  Evrard added that prices of haricot beans, a staple food of 
the two countries, had been driven up to exorbitant levels. 
  The United Nations has estimated that 200,000 people have 
been killed in the civil war which broke out in Rwanda about 
April 8 and is still raging. Evrard described the plight of 
refugees as "horrifying." 
  At the St Andre refugee camp at Kabgayi, 8,000 people were 
packed into a few hundred square metres so tightly that it was 
impossible to extract the body of someone who died there one 
night recently, the aid worker said. 
  Caritas officials added that militia of the dominant Hutu 
tribe in Rwanda were waging a terror campaign against the 
minority Tutsis, destroying villages and slaying their 
inhabitants. 
  "We have often been told that villagers were forced to kill 
their neighbours in order to avoid being massacred themselves," 
one official reported.

  [Text] Brussels, May 9 (AFP) -- Finland and Sweden, both 
traditionally neutral countries, signed up Monday [9 May] for 
the Partnership for Peace programme of military cooperation 
between NATO and the former Soviet bloc. 
  Both countries said they were particularly interested in 
contributing to the peacekeeping and search-and-rescue function 
of the Partnership, which was launched by the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organisation in January. 
  Finnish Prime Minister Heikki Haavisto stressed that 
Helsinki 
was not abandoning its neutral stance. "Through participation 
in Partnership activities, Finland is not seeking a new defence 
solution. Finland pursues a policy of military nonalliance and 
independent defence," he said. 
  Swedish Foreign Minister Baroness Margaretha af Ugglas said 
the Partnership would promote "political stability through 
cooperation and a gradual convergence of attitudes and 
behaviour." 
  Both ministers stressed the role of the Partnership in 
strengthening the peacekeeping abilities of the United Nations 
and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). 
  Welcoming the two ministers, NATO deputy director-general 
Sergio Balanzino said Finland and Sweden would also set an 
example through their "longstanding tradition of democratic 
control of their defence forces." 
  The Partnership for Peace is a flexible programme ranging 
from the simple sharing of military training techniques to 
participation in full-scale military manoeuvres and peacekeeping 
exercises. But it stops short of offering full NATO membership 
any time soon. 
  The programme also seeks to restore civilian democratic 
control over the armed forces of the former communist 
dictatorships. 
  Sweden and Finland, the first non-NATO members on the 
Western 
side of the old Iron Curtain, bring the total number of non-NATO 
participants to 17. 
  The others, in order of joining, are Romania, Lithuania, 
Poland, Estonia, Hungary, Ukraine, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Latvia, 
Albania, the Czech Republic, Moldova, Georgia, Slovenia and 
Azerbaijan. 
  Russia is expected to join the Partnership soon, but is 
still 
quibbling over details.

<F P=106> [Mia Doornaert report: "Sweden and Finland Bring Extensive </F>
Peacekeeping Experience to PFP"] 
  [Text] By joining NATO's Partnership for Peace (PFP) today, 
Sweden and Finland mainly have their eye on cooperation 
regarding peacekeeping missions. However, that is not the only 
reason why PFP is so popular with the two Nordic countries. In 
their capacity as neighbors of Russia, and as states bordering 
the Baltic, both countries attach great importance to 
elaborating a pan-European security system. The PFP is open to 
Russia. As the PFP does not imply the possible expansion of 
NATO, it does not draw a new line through Europe, and 
consequently it leaves the status of the Baltic republics of 
Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania unclear. In so doing it is 
responding to the pan-European concern regarding the Nordic 
countries. 
  By offering the PFP, NATO is giving all CSCE countries a 
program for cooperation from which they may make a choice, 
depending on their desires and constraints. What Sweden and 
Finland will bring with them is extensive experience regarding 
participation in peacekeeping missions, one of the PFP's 
cooperation programs. At the same time, this will offer them a 
platform for cooperation with NATO that fits in with their 
policy of nonalignment. 
  "Sweden is probably the record-holding participant in UN 
peacekeeping missions," said Pierre Schori, spokesman for 
foreign policy in the social democratic opposition party and the 
man being tipped as the next foreign minister if his party is 
included in the government after next September's elections. 
Finnish blue helmets, too, have, and are still, widely 
deployed. 
  The blue helmets are not dispatched on an improvised basis. 
For instance, Sweden has a special training center where 
participants in UN peacekeeping missions receive adapted 
training. Among other things, they are acquainted with the 
topography of the area to which they will be sent. There is 
already both a plan and a budget for making this center 
available to the PFP and for training mixed groups of foreign 
soldiers there. 
  Bo Huidt, the director of strategic studies at the Military 
Academy in Stockholm, pointed out that such cooperation in 
association with the PFP is not entirely new for Sweden. "In 
fact, we are already applying the PFP philosophy in the former 
Yugoslavia," he said. The UN peace mission in Bosnia indeed 
has close links with NATO because it were ultimatums set by the 
Alliance that ended the attacks on Sarajevo and the siege of 
Gorazde. 
  Sweden, along with Norway and Denmark, is participating in a 
Nordic battalion of blue helmets in Bosnia. UN commanders in 
Bosnia, especially General Francis Briquemont, have expressed 
their concern about that battalion, which was given a very 
precise assignment, meaning that its deployment was not flexible 
enough for the UN commanders. 
  Michael Sahlin, the Swedish permanent under secretary of 
state for defense, is familiar with that problem: "I have 
discussed this problem with the Belgian Government and with 
General Charlier, the Belgian chief of staff," he said. 
  "The Nordic countries were among the few nations prepared to 
allocate troops to protect the six so-called safe areas 
established by UN Security Council Resolution 836. I understand 
that the commanders want the greatest possible flexibility on 
the ground, but in the eyes of our parliaments, the sending of 
blue helmets must clearly be seen to fit in a context of UN 
peacekeeping. We had to point out an area associated with 
Resolution 836. The Danish contingent of the Nordic battalion, 
in particular, had a binding mandate from its parliament." 
<H5>  No Peacemaking </H5>
  Within the framework of the United Nations, the CSCE, and 
PFP, Sweden wants to continue making an active contribution to 
peace missions. At the same time, it became clear in a series 
of talks with the security establishment in Stockholm that 
nonaligned countries meant peacekeeping, not peacemaking. In 
Sweden, there are far greater reservations regarding actions in 
which the United Nations or CSCE should actively impose peace, 
say, on an area under conflict or a country that has fallen prey 
to internal violence, by resorting to armed force. The Nordic 
blue helmets were given a strict mandate precisely because the 
UN mission in Bosnia overstepped the mark of "peacekeeping." 
  There is widespread support in the country for active 
participation in peacekeeping missions. However, virtually all 
the dialogue partners admitted that both the press and the 
public would come up with critical questions if, say, 10 Swedish 
blue helmets were killed in one go in Bosnia. So they have 
great understanding of the horror in Belgium at the murder of 
the paratroopers in Rwanda. 
  "Since the beginning of last century, Sweden's policy of 
neutrality has kept the country out of all wars. We are not 
used to losing soldiers in combat," one top diplomat said. 
  Even in many countries which have been involved in wars this 
century, despite all the emotional appeals, the willingness of 
public opinion to see compatriots killed in conflicts, whether 
near or far from home, is extremely limited. 
  The new PFP members are bringing with them valuable 
experience in peacekeeping, which is not something that should 
be underestimated. However, they are just as reluctant as most 
other countries belonging to NATO and PFP, including Belgium, 
when it comes to making an effort to turn the CSCE or PFP into a 
machine for imposing peace under force of arms in areas of 
conflict within the CSCE, ranging from Bosnia to Central Asia, 
by way of Upper Karabach.

  [Text] Basel, Switzerland, May 9 (AFP) -- Group of Ten 
central bank governors held a "confidential" discussion Monday 
[9 May] on the situation on the foreign exchange markets, German 
Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer said here after the 
governors' regular monthly meeting. 
  The talks came in the wake of large-scale concerted 
intervention last week by central banks to prop up the slumping 
U.S. dollar. 
  "We talked about developments on the forex markets and their 
implications for monetary policy", said Tietmeyer, who chairs 
the G-10 governors' committee. "Our discussion was 
confidential." 
  He added that the committee had not discussed exchange rate 
targets at their meeting at the Basel headquarters of the Bank 
for International Settlements. 
  The governors also talked about the derivatives markets, the 
growth of which is causing them some worries. "We decided today 
to make a study, to be completed in April 1995, of all 
participants on this market," the Bundesbank chief said. 
  He also said the governors were a little more optimistic 
than 
previously about the world economy.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Trade: U.S. Obstacles Are Costly </F>
for Europe -- Increased Recourse to Unilateral and Bilateral 
Measures"] 
  [Text] The United States is continuing to orientate its 
trade policies on the basis of the competitiveness of its 
companies, a report by the European Commission (EC) accuses. 
  European Union (EU) companies lost "several billion dollars" 
in 1993 due to U.S. trade barriers, but the signature of the 
GATT agreement allows the hope of an improvement in 
transatlantic trade in 1994. This is the EC view in its 10th 
annual report on U.S. barriers to trade and investment. 
  As it presented the document yesterday, the European 
Executive deplored the fact that "worries about the 
competitiveness of U.S. companies continue to orientate the 
trade policies" of Washington. The Europeans are concerned in 
particular about the resurrection in March of the so-called 
Super 301 procedure, which allows the United States to decide 
unilaterally to take sanctions against a trading partner 
suspected of unfair trading practices. "That indicates that they 
are allowing themselves to once again be tempted by increased 
recourse to unilateral or bilateral trade measures," the EC said. 
  Taken together, the tariff and regulatory barriers listed in 
the EC's report constitute lost earnings of "several billion 
dollars" for European companies which would like to export 
across the Atlantic. 
  The EU member states had a trading deficit of ECU6.5 billion 
in 1993, considered as "reasonable and moderate" by Brussels. 
Transatlantic trade flows were ECU165 billion and EU exports 
reached a new high, increasing from ECU73.9 billion in 1992 to 
ECU80 billion in 1993. 
  The EC's annual report denounces the U.S. barriers, most of 
which are well known. In addition to unilateral measures, which 
Washington wants to keep even though they contradict the spirit 
of the Uruguay Round agreement, the document lists fiscal 
barriers (which affect cars in particular), the large number of 
standards, the rules protecting industrial property and the 
unequal treatment of non-U.S. subsidiaries. 
  The EC also regrets the "frequent recourse to the notion of 
national security," and the interpretation of certain political 
and environmental rules to the detriment of European companies. 
  According to the EC, European companies have also suffered 
considerably from the high customs duties which can exceed 40 
percent for some products like textiles, clothing, and table and 
glassware. 
  However, reductions in these "tariff peaks" are provided for 
under the GATT agreement and Europe will monitor their 
application. 
  Let us add that from the other side of the ocean, the report 
by the U.S. Administration on "trade barriers," published on 31 
March, pointed its finger at Japan above all. But the EU was 
cited in particular for its system of protection for audiovisual 
products.

  [Text] London, 6 May (AFP)--Outspoken Greek European 
Affairs Minister Theodoros Pangalos condemned Thursday [5 May] 
the Maastricht Treaty, which laid the foundations of the 
European Union [EU], calling it "intellectually bad" and 
"inadequate." 
  The controversial minister, whose country currently holds 
the 
EU presidency, made the comments in a speech at the Royal 
Institute of International Affairs here. 
  "Many of the provisions of the Treaty are today outdated, 
others are inadequate, while many of the critical present and 
future problems have not been taken into account," he said. 
  The ``unacceptably high level of unemployment threatens to 
de-stabilise our society and democratic institutions.... We are 
facing one of the biggest economic crises of the last decade. 
  ``Our inability to anticipate these developments, to study 
the new facts and trends of the international economy, leave 
their marks on our society and institutions,'' he said, 
describing the treaty as ``intellectually bad.'' 
  The Maastricht Treaty, signed in December 1992, provided the 
framework for the single European market which came into force 
in January 1993, and the European Union in November last year. 
  In the past Pangalos has caused diplomatic incidents by, 
notably, accusing Germany of being like "a giant with bestial 
force and a child's brain" over its policy in former Yugoslavia. 
  Last month Pangalos said his time as European Affairs 
minister during Greek EU presidency had been "four months of 
nightmare.... There are only two months left, I will get through 
it."

<F P=106> [Francoise Delstanche report: "A Transition Clearly Geared </F>
to Future Membership"] 
  [Text] With the entry of Central and East European 
countries, the whole existing struture of the Community 
intervention system will have to be revised, Richard Baldwin, of 
the Center for Economic Policy Research in London, suggests in 
an essay on European integration commissioned by the European 
Commission (EC). According to Baldwin, the maintenance of the 
existing intervention system after the membership of the four 
countries of the Visegrad group (Hungary, Poland, Czech 
Republic, and Slovakia) would mean an increase of 60 percent in 
the Community budget. Moreover, this is one of the reasons 
which is prompting the southern countries, which enjoy 
structural aid, to have reservations about the entry of these 
new applicants. 
  According to Baldwin, we therefore cannot count on 
integration for two decades. This means not before these 
countries have achieved the limit of 75 percent of the level of 
average income which determines the countries eligible for 
structural funds. 
  According to the author of the essay on European 
integration, 
the extension of the Common Agricultural Policy to the Visegrad 
countries would cost $47 billion annually. In addition, he 
argues, the opening of Community borders to the workers of these 
countries could prompt the emigration of between 3 and 6 million 
people. There would be a risk of these immigrants being 
concentrated in countries like Germany and Austria, where that 
would present considerable problems. 
<H5>  Two Stages </H5>
  However, Baldwin explains, we cannot make do with 
association 
as a preparatory phase. An intermediate stage must be found 
enabling them to progress toward full integration. The author 
suggests a two-stage strategy. First, offering a kind of 
improved version of the existing association, in a multilateral 
form with a more coherent institutional infrastructure. Second, 
achieving a copy of the economic area achieved with EFTA 
[European Free Trade Association], excluding the section 
relating to immigration. 
  These suggestions partly coincide with the course envisaged 
by the EC. Brussels is also convinced that it is necessary to 
clarify an intermediate policy, if only to avoid causing 
frustration. However, this intermediate phase would be based 
primarily on full implementation of the association agreements, 
according to the EC. 
  Some commissioners, in the same way as Baldwin, seem more 
convinced that the existing bilateral structure, with the weak 
association agreements, is not satisfactory. It does not make 
it possible to step up relations among these countries. Of 
course, Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia have 
concluded the Visegrad agreements which make provision for the 
establishment of a free trade area. 
  But this is not working very well, and Bulgaria and Romania, 
which also have association agreements with the European Union 
(EU), are not part of it. The main problem is that those 
responsible are very reluctant about any idea of recreating 
links among themselves, fearing that Europe might use this as a 
pretext to keep them waiting indefinitely. 
  And yet, we hear people on the EU side saying, Moscow cannot 
simply be replaced by Brussels, given that the CEMA [Council for 
Mutual Economic Assistance] system functioned essentially 
between each satellite country and the USSR, and very little 
among the East European countries. 
  The advantage of a free trade area is more obvious for these 
countries, in that the foreign investor cannot really rely 
exclusively on the internal market of one country. Indeed, the 
incentives would be much greater if a whole free trade area in 
the region was opened up for the enterprise. 
<H5>  Strengthening Ties </H5>
  At the same time, the EC seems to have come round to another 
idea: During the transitional phase, it would be necessary to 
gradually adapt the aid system provided by the EU to the Central 
and East European countries. The aim would be to turn this 
system into a preparatory tool for membership. This process 
has, moreover, already started, because the Copenhagen European 
summit has decided to devote 15 percent of the PHARE [Economic 
Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary] funds to the 
development of the infrastructure. But there are proposals for 
going further and using the PHARE program as a tool preparing 
for membership, by bringing it closer to the structural funds, 
by extending the suggestions of the white paper to the East 
European countries, and by expanding the European Investment 
Bank's sphere of intervention, especially to the Baltic 
countries. PHARE, the relevant commissioners also argue, should 
have funding extending over several years to enable it to 
intervene at the level of industrial and bank restructuring. 
  The PHARE program could also be concentrated on the 
harmonization of legislation, and the implementation of the 
rules of competition in force in the EU in the sphere of 
monopolies and public aid. This aspect has already been tackled 
in the association agreements. In the view of some 
commissioners, if it were taken further, it would make it 
possible to envisage the elimination of antidumping and 
protection procedures, which are all sources of tension with our 
partners. Pending the standardization of rules, these same 
commissioners suggest a preliminary consultation, before 
implementing protection procedures. But the idea is far from 
having unanimous support. 
<H5>  Political Dialogue </H5>
  It has also been suggested that the associate countries 
should be included in the second and third pillars of the 
Maastricht Treaty, relating to justice and internal affairs on 
the one hand and foreign policy on the other. Although this 
idea does not seem to be gaining ground, the Twelve should 
nonetheless give a more active place to the Central European 
countries in the discussions on these subjects. It would thus be 
possible to include on the list of sensitive subjects in these 
countries, the trans-European network, drugs, and crime. This 
should stimulate interest in the discussions and implement the 
decision made last March to conduct multilateral consultations 
at this level too. As for security questions, it would be 
particularly interesting to consult these countries on their 
perception of the situation in Russia and the former USSR.

  [Text] Luxembourg, May 9 (A.A.) -- Foreign Minister Hikmet 
Cetin, who is currently attending Western European Union [WEU] 
meetings in Luxembourg, said on Monday [9 May] that Turkey's 
goal was full membership in the WEU. 
  Foreign and defense ministers from member countries of the 
WEU continued their meetings in Luxembourg on Monday. 
  Cetin and Defense Minister Mehmet Golhan said they welcomed 
a 
new `developed partnership' status given with WEU's structure 
but Turkey's aim is to be a full member of the Union. 
  Cetin in a briefing on the meeting said the most important 
improvement is the new partnership status that will be given to 
Central and East European countries and Baltic countries. 
  He said the WEU will provide cooperation possibilities to 
those countries in operational fields. 
  WEU's operational functions are preserving peace and 
administering humanitarian aid and power. 
  Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, 
Romania, Lithuania, Estonia and Lithuania who have previously 
signed a number of cooperation and partnership agreements with 
the WEU, will obtain a special status within the organization. 
  Cetin said Turkey's status is specified as an `associate 
member' with the Union meaning that Turkey will be officially 
represented at the military secretariat which is the `planning 
cell' of the WEU, and will be able to contribute to the Union's 
operations. 
  Turkey does not have the right to vote or to veto. 
  The meetings will end this evening and Golhan will return to 
Turkey, while Cetin will fly to Strasbourg, France to attend the 
Council of Europe meetings.

  [Text] The four European firms involved in the production 
of the Eurofighter 2000 (formerly known as "Fighter 90") 
appeared to be in agreement with each other during the fighter's 
first public demonstration in England, but this unity in fact 
conceals a dispute over the future distribution of tasks of the 
billion-mark armaments program. According to current plans, 
some 33 percent of this program is the responsibility of 
Deutsche Aerospace (DASA) and British Aerospace, 21 percent is 
the responsibility of the Italian Alenia, and 13 percent is the 
responsibility of Spanish Casa. These proportions are based on 
the number of aircraft each partner country will purchase. But 
because Defense Minister Ruehe wants to purchase 140 
Eurofighters instead of the planned 200, the German share should 
fall to 25 percent. DASA will not accept this reduction, 
arguing that the degree of involvement in the program depends on 
the share of the costs of developing the fighter, and this share 
remains the same, of course. The dispute will probably drag on 
until next spring because that is when the government will 
decide whether or not to buy the expensive Eurofighter. The 
latest price offered by the aircraft industry is 102.5 million 
marks.

<F P=106> [Report by Manfred Fuchs: "Permanent Breach of Neutrality"] </F>
  [Text] For a long time the activities of the secret and 
intelligence services of the neutral states in Europe were 
probably the best guarded secrets. This also applies to 
Austria, whose diligent agents have provided comprehensive 
services to NATO's intelligence services from the time of the 
signing of the State Treaty in 1955 until today, most recently 
during the current crisis in Yugoslavia. 
  Neutrality did not play any role. 
<H5>  Austria -- Excellent Contacts </H5>
  The Austrian Army's intelligence service, the Group for 
Intelligence Matters, played a significant role in the 
intelligence sphere shortly after its founding in 1955/56 during 
the Hungarian crisis in 1956. 
  Western intelligence officials received detailed information 
from their Austrian counterparts on the situation in its eastern 
neighbor, consisting of reports by informers and recordings of 
the radio traffic monitored by the Austrian Army. The good 
relationship between the Group for Intelligence Matters and the 
Western intelligence services was partly due to the excellent 
contacts between its leading officers and Western 
organizations, which date back to the last years of Nazi terror. 
The first head of the Group for Intelligence Matters, Kurt 
Fechner, could look back on a long career in the intelligence 
service of the First Republic and in the counterintelligence 
service (the military intelligence service) of Hitler's Reich. 
  When the collapse was already visible, Fechner succeeded in 
establishing contact with the French and U.S. intelligence 
services. This not only saved him from any kind of persecution 
by the occupation forces but, as a result, he also knew a great 
number of agents who many years later intervened with the 
Austrian authorities to support his nomination as head of the 
Austrian intelligence service. 
<H5>  Koenigswarte Listening Post </H5>
  The establishment of the Austrian intelligence service was 
mainly supported by U.S. intelligence, which also provided the 
necessary funds -- in the case of the listening post of the 
Group for Intelligence Matters. Apart from setting up an 
information network in the East Bloc, where the United States 
cooperated with Kurt Fechner, the U.S. agents also offered Army 
Colonel Rudolf Camerlander and his comrade Johann Zahradnik help 
in the establishment of a radio monitoring service. 
  The officers of the Austrian Army soon set up a group of 
motorized radio troops with instruments and vehicles from U.S. 
stocks which they headed out from their headquarters in the 
barracks in Vienna's third district. A little later, the Group 
for Intelligence Matters established (again with U.S. funds and 
U.S. know-how) the first fixed listening station at the 
so-called Koenigswarte, a few kilometers from the Hungarian 
border and Bratislava. 
  Apart from the building at Koenigswarte, the Austrian 
intelligence service expanded the espionage network under U.S. 
control. The signal/reconnaissance battalion (known as the 
Technical Control Service at the time) was established in 
Neulengbach, where the specialists in radio espionage, decoding 
specialists, interpreters, and information and evaluation 
experts carried out their work. 
<H5>  U.S. Espionage Network </H5>
  The reason for the CIA's generosity was naturally not 
altruism. The monitoring network only worked for Austria to a 
limited extent. During the first phase of the Cold War, U.S. 
intelligence established a network of listening stations in all 
West European countries that bordered on East Bloc states. Thus, 
the Austrian listening posts that were in a position to 
intercept radio traffic in Yugoslavia, the Balkans, Hungary, the 
CSFR, and large parts of the USSR were designed as a support for 
the U.S. espionage network. 
  The Austrian officers had to submit the recordings and 
summaries of monitored radio traffic to the headquarters of the 
German Intelligence Service in Pullach. There, the material was 
picked up by representatives of the CIA. This breach of 
neutrality was silently tolerated by the Austrian intelligence 
officers. 
<H5>  Electronic Aid From Overseas </H5>
  In 1963, some intelligence officers spoke up against the 
cooperation between neutral Austria and a NATO intelligence 
service. Lieutenant Colonel Johann Zahradnik, who headed 
Koenigswarte, even went as far as addressing a letter to Defense 
Minister Georg Prader and State Secretary Otto Roesch, pointing 
out the unilateral cooperation between the Group for 
Intelligence Matters and the CIA. The result, however, was that 
he was transferred to another position. 
  Despite the fact that the Austrian Defense Minister took 
over 
the financing of the monitoring network, the U.S. authorities 
were even concerned about the modernization of cruising and 
monitoring network of the Intelligence Service of the Austrian 
Army [HNA] until the 1990's. 
  At the Neulengbach computer center, where it was possible 
to observe the troop movements of even the smallest units on the 
other side of the border, officers and engineers had reached the 
limit of what was possible some time ago. The instruments had 
to be renewed to improve the processing of the increasing influx 
of data. The INA "passive collection system" was developed. 
However, the Austrian electronic engineers were not in a 
position to prepare the required programs. 
  At this point, the U.S. company Bendix offered to cooperate 
with the Austrians. It was no coincidence that Bendix also 
cooperated with U.S. intelligence. According to the wishes of 
the U.S. Administration, the electronic system was to be 
provided to the Austrians free of charge. Yet, because of the 
chaos within the Austrian Defense Ministry, the smart Americans 
made the Austrians pay a sum for their services that allegedly 
exceeded 10 million schillings. 
<H5>  Services for NATO by the Neutral Countries </H5>
  In the crisis year of 1991, the HNA mobilized its radio post 
at the Austrian-Yugoslav border. In cooperation with the 
Italian military intelligence service which had infiltrated its 
agents into Yugoslavia, the HNA supplied an exact picture of the 
political and military situation there. 
  The cruising and monitoring stations of the Austrian Army 
monitored the radio traffic of the Yugoslav People's Army and of 
all parties to the civil war. The Austrian reports even 
contained exact descriptions of the supply lines and the 
positions of the Serbian armed forces heavy weapons. 
  The results of the espionage activities of the Austrian 
intelligence service were passed on to NATO intelligence 
services, who examined -- and dropped -- the possibilities of a 
military operation to end the conflict in the former Yugoslavia 
on the basis of the Austrian data. 
  However, cooperation between the military intelligence 
service of a neutral state and the intelligence services of NATO 
member states is not merely an Austrian peculiarity. After 
numerous hints regarding a special unit within the military 
intelligence service in Switzerland, the Federal Council was 
forced to set up a parliamentary investigation committee for the 
Military Department (the Swiss Defense Ministry) on 12 March 
1990. 
  The parliamentarians discovered a secret resistance army, 
the 
P-26, which was established as early as in the 1950's and which 
had contacts with similar secret troops in other West European 
countries. The special unit was considered the Swiss branch of 
the NATO organization "Gladio," which was set up in nearly all 
West European states with U.S. support in the 1950's. All in 
the government, in the Military Department, and in the 
Department of Justice and Police who knew about Gladio pretended 
to be ignorant and guiltless after the exposure of the scandal. 
The head of the P-26, Efrem Cattelan (codename "Rico"), went 
underground and took along some of the P-26's most important 
secrets. Even the government claims not to possess a "key to 
the activation of the deactivation" of the P-26. 
<H5>  Swedish Services for the CIA </H5>
  Sweden's image as a model neutral country is also beginning 
to show cracks because of the activities of its military 
intelligence service. From the memoirs of Swedish Air Force 
Officer Stig Wennerstrom, who worked for the USSR's military 
intelligence service until 1963, it becomes clear that the 
Swedish military cooperated with U.S. intelligence, to whom the 
reports by the attaches in the Soviet Union were handed over 
voluntarily. Ten years after the Wennerstrom affair, the two 
journalists Peter Bratt and Jan Guillou, as well as the former 
agent Hakan Isacson uncovered "criminal practices" of the 
intelligence service of the Swedish Army in the magazine FOLKET 
I BILD [PEOPLE IN THE KNOW]. The intelligence service provided 
aid to Western intelligence and security services during their 
operations in Sweden and its eastern neighboring countries. 
  Agents of the operational department of the Swedish 
intelligence service, the Information Office (to which Olof 
Palme, who became prime ministe later, also belonged for a 
certain period) planned and carried out landings on the Finnish 
coast in cooperation with the CIA. In 1970, they even helped 
the Israeli intelligence service break into the embassies of 
Egypt, Algeria, and Iraq and protected it against police 
investigations. Reports from the East were also passed on to 
the Israeli secret service by the Information Office. 
  The election victory of the conservatives in 1991 in Sweden 
did not change anything regarding the military intelligence 
service's influential position. Quite the contrary. The change 
of governemnt even led to an expansion of the intelligence 
service (which is quite large for a neutral state). 
  Since Sweden has a significant weapons industry, the 
military 
intelligence service can continue to rely on the government's 
approval of its intensive contacts with NATO intelligence 
services in the interest of the protection of Swedish interests.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Delcroix Wants To Apply </F>
Consumer-Friendly Principle to Army Procurement"] 
  [Text] Belgian Defense Minister Delcroix wants future Army 
procurement to take place according to a Test-Aankoop [Belgian 
consumer association] principle, where only the price-quality 
ratio is decisive. Delcroix does not support economic 
compensations. If such compensations nevertheless continue to 
play a role in the future, then their extra cost should not be 
pushed onto the Army. The minister made these comments during a 
speech in Hasselt on Saturday [7 May]. 
  "Contracts including compensations turn out 10 to 25 percent 
more expensive," Delcroix said. Moreover, decisionmaking 
procedures which take account of defense issues only are quicker. 
  The minister is opting for a system of two tenders, with and 
without compensations. Compensations should at no time be an 
obstacle to decisionmaking within the Army. 
  The compensations system, which has existed for decades, has 
been viewed in an unfavorable light since the Agusta affair. "A 
parliamentary committee is investigating the system, but 
apparently the MP's have not sorted things out," the minister 
said. 
  "Some committee members appear to be doing a big U-turn. 
From the original position that `compensations are synonymous 
with corruption' to `compensations must remain possible and an 
MP must be able to intervene for his region,'" Delcroix 
continued. 
  The minister said "it was unacceptable that Army contracts 
should take place only because an economic benefit was attached 
to them." As defense minister, he did not support compensations. 
They slow down decisionmaking procedures and defense no longer 
has the resources to be an instrument for economic development. 
  "That is an area for the regions par excellence. If Economic 
Affairs or the regions believe their own industry must be 
promoted, then it must subsidize the price difference. In 
addition, compensations must be oriented toward the future and 
not be a short-term emergency measure," the minister said, 
adding other demands. Compensations should not end with the 
delivery of the last item ordered, should enable high-tech 
investments, give access to markets which were otherwise 
unreachable and be open to verification.

<F P=106> [Article by Herman Van Rompuy, Belgian deputy prime minister </F>
and budget minister: "The Recovery Is Already Under Way"] 
  [Text] The Belgian economy has both its weak and its strong 
points. Trotting them all out also means telling the whole 
truth. Mostly, the value of a currency reflects the general 
situation, certainly if, what is more, interest rates are low 
internationally. Anyone who retains any doubts as to the 
durability of the strength of the Belgian franc, however, cannot 
deny the fact that our inflation is lower than that in Germany 
and the Netherlands, that our current balance of payments has a 
record surplus of 350 and 400 billion Belgian francs [BFr] in 
1993 and 1994 respectively, that our level of unemployment, 10 
percent, is lower than in the rest of Europe, and that the 
budget deficit is not 3.5 GNP points higher than the European 
average as calculated in 1988, but only 0.8 GNP points. 
  That is a different way of describing our situation than the 
almost traditional "doomsday approach." Pessimism has been so 
predominant that a few months ago, when I said the recession was 
over, it seemed unbelievable. Over the last few weeks, however, 
the economic analysts have been upwardly revising their growth 
figures, so that even private forecasters are now talking about 
growth of 1.3 percent in 1994, as predicted, incidentally, by 
the European Commission. 
  So the question is not whether Belgium still needs a plan 
for 
recovery. A shift toward recovery is already under way. 
Furthermore, in recent years, with the exception of 1993, the 
national economy has performed better than in the rest of 
Europe. It will yield an equivalent performance in 1994. 
Incidentally, if one compares 1982-1987 with 1988-1994, then it 
becomes evident that growth during the former period was slow, 
whereas growth during the latter period was somewhat faster. A 
more direct comparison with the Netherlands and Germany shows an 
average increase in GNP of 1.4 percent, compared with 1.5 
percent for our neighbours, and 2.2 and 2.5 percent respectively 
during 1988-1994. If we only take data on the Flemish economy, 
then the difference between Belgium and the two countries 
already mentioned would be virtually indistinguishable. 
<H5>  Edinburgh </H5>
  Economic recovery in other European countries too may partly 
be attributed to the European Union's recovery initiative that 
was launched at the Edinburgh summit and definitively sealed in 
Brussels in early December 1993. The Belgian presidency played 
a particularly important role in this context. 
  Pointing out positive aspects does not mean to say that we 
deny the structural failings of our economy, in particular our 
not very labor-intensive economy and the high public debt. The 
liberal opposition says absolutely nothing about the 
labor-unfriendly character of our economy in its so-called 
recovery plan. Employment is not merely the result of higher 
economic growth or more investments. That is the reason the 
Global Plan so strongly emphasized reducing the social burdens 
for young people and for those with low qualifications. 
Moreover, that is why the real increase in incomes has been 
blocked for a three-year period. 
  Nothing could be simpler than organizing recovery by 
increasing the deficit. That was the old Keynesian recipe, but 
that is something to fall back on when excessive hopes are 
placed on the so-called receipt effects of lowering taxes, even 
benefiting investments. For many years now, I have been hearing 
people clamor that certain tax breaks will generate more for the 
treasury than they cost. Things have never turned out that way. 
In order to avoid budgetary risks, in the Global Plan the 
government fully compensated the reduction of the social 
burdens. 
  Moreover, supposing that some fiscal incentives are 
temporary, like the reduction in VAT [value-added tax] rates for 
construction and investment allowances proposed by the Flemish 
liberals, the only result will be to accelerate the speed with 
which certain investments are made, rather than achieve durable 
growth. For the construction sector, interest rates for 
mortgages have always proven far more important than any drop in 
VAT. Well, over the past few years it has been possible to 
bring interest rates down. For investments, profitability is a 
key determining factor, and it will increase as a result of wage 
restraint, among other things. Naturally, additional measures 
would be useful if the budgetary leeway permitted their 
implementation, but even then the effects should not be 
overestimated. 
<H5>  Deduction at Source </H5>
  The federal government has reduced the tax deducted at 
source 
on dividends from capital increases (including for small- and 
medium-sized companies) from 25 to 13 percent. This is an 
important step in removing discrimination against risk capital. 
It binds the reduction to an economic activity and is therefore 
socially more acceptable than a simple reduction in the rate of 
tax deducted at source from 25 to 20 percent, which would mean 
that those with capital were the only ones whose income was 
improving while all other income groups were having to tighten 
their belts. 
  The liberals claim that a reduction in company tax could be 
compensated by abolishing subsidies to companies. But the 
federal government no longer gives any allowances to private 
companies. 
  This government is the first to privatize on a large scale. 
And yet the yields of privatization form just a small part of 
budgetary income. Of the BFr500 billion raised for 1994, only 
11 percent is concerned. Like Germany, the Netherlands, and 
France, and like Belgium in 1987, the money raised is being used 
for the budget. In any case, the contribution of the private 
sector is essential if the present public enterprises are to 
withstand international pressures. In the case of a number of 
them, the government's majority position was simply given up. 
  However, privatization here cannot be compared with what is 
happening in Latin American countries, as the VLD [Flemish 
Liberal Democrats] likes to do. Far less than 5 percent of the 
business stock is in public hands here. Little was ever 
nationalized and consequently we cannot privatize on a large 
scale. In any case, where is the time when the PVV [Party For 
Freedom and Progress] "nationalized" Cockerill-Sambre, not to 
mention the massive cut in working time (1983), the tax increase 
of BFr270 billion (in today's francs) due to the last three 
index jumps (1984-1987). But that sounds too polemical. Yet it 
is still correct. 
  Personally, I am not against the possibility of more 
flexible 
wage formation, with a certain link to company results. In 
1987, there was a draft bill about profit-sharing remuneration, 
but I do not expect any miracles from it. In addition, many 
workers work in the nonprofitmaking sector or for self-employed 
persons who know nothing of the concept of "company profits." 
  The task of the federal government is not over. Constant 
vigilance is necessary over competitiveness, the budget, social 
security, and employment. A rising economic cycle will not be 
enough to gain fully satisfactory results. This task for the 
federal government will remain difficult, in a period when the 
general interest is not a self-evident idea.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "No Hidden Intentions"] </F>
  [Text] First Chamber President H. Tjeenk Willink has been 
appointed to assess on behalf of the crown whether a proposed 
government cabinet will succeed. This means that the formation 
of a government is now really under way. With appropriate 
caution, because the beginning is always difficult and somewhat 
arbitrary when the result of the election does not point all 
that clearly in one particular direction. There are now two 
serious possibilities: A "purple" coalition (comprising the 
PvdA, [Labor Party], the VVD [People's Party for Freedom and 
Democracy], and the D66 [Democrats 66]) and a center left 
coalition. A center right coalition consisting of the CDA 
[Christian Democratic Appeal], the VVD, and the D66 will only be 
a real option if "purple" turns out not to be a possibility and 
the D66 and the PvdA are taken apart. 
  The opinions of the four main parties revealed a few 
differences. All in all, however, they lead to the conclusion -- 
incidentally, not very surprising -- conclusion that H. Tjeenk 
Willink must first test the political will of several parties. 
Certainly, bearing in mind the attitude of the PvdA and the 
VVD, it would be imprudent to start negotiations on one of the 
two plausible coalitions without mature consideration. 
  Regarding the liberals, it is not clear whether they really 
want or will dare to embark on a "purple" coalition. Perhaps 
they are ultimately hoping for a right-wing coalition, while 
some are also thinking of a continuation of the opposition 
deemed to be profitable. 
  The PvdA is hesitant and divided. One section of the new 
party and Minister Van Thijn are calling for the coalition 
without the CDA. This is entirely understandable following the 
voters' punishing treatment of the Lubbers III government. 
However, PvdA leader Kok, the vice prime minister in that 
government, appears to be more in favor of complementing his 
preferred coalition with the D66. 
  When forming a government, the right policy does not consist 
of negotiating a coalition, while a couple of negotiators are in 
fact trying to let these negotiations fail in some devious 
manner. Such hidden intentions spoil the atmosphere between the 
various parties and give politics the reputation of shiftiness 
and incompetence. 
  Moreover, they may have tiresome consequences for the 
negotiators themselves. Next time, they may even find 
themselves kicked out, or in a weak position compared with the 
newcomers on that occasion. For example, if Kok deliberately 
sabotaged the "purple" option, he would have little defense left 
against ministerial posts requested by the CDA, provided that he 
has not already been marginalized by the D66, because of his 
destructive attitude. 
  Over the next few days, Tjeenk Willink must evaluate the 
political will of the VVD and the PvdA as accurately as 
possible. On the other hand, these parties must make a serious 
choice, even if it proves worse than their expectations. If 
they opt clearly for a "purple" coalition, as is to be hoped, 
then the formation of such a coalition could still fail for 
reasons connected with its content. However, that must not be 
allowed to occur due to the lack of goodwill and due to 
excessive inflexibility. 
  It is understandable that some members of the PvdA and the 
VVD in particular harbor doubts regarding the possibility of a 
"purple" coalition. One important argument, however, is that 
taking a crumbling CDA as a partner in government would have 
definite disadvantages, namely entailing a shaky leadership, 
internal reproaches, and a great desire to establish a fresh 
image among the electorate. Not a pleasant mixture.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Netherlands Company for Energy and </F>
the Environment Helps Bulgaria Save Energy"] 
  [Text] Rotterdam -- The Netherlands Company for Energy and 
the Environment (NOVEM) is giving Bulgaria aid to reduce its 
energy consumption. This week, L. Petkanchin, the Bulgarian 
deputy minister for energy, visited NOVEM to hold further talks 
regarding a project for the local communities in his country to 
save energy. 
  Of the bilateral aid The Netherlands is giving to East 
Europe, NOVEM is paying for technical advice from consultants, 
modern measuring equipment, and supervision. Energy consumption 
by Bulgarian (Government) buildings, households, and industry is 
very high. There is the threat of an energy crisis because the 
bills can no longer be paid. One quarter of the fuel used for 
generating electricity is imported from Russia. 
  The Bulgarian partners in the project began by measuring the 
energy consumption of local communities. In addition, advice 
and training was given for improving organization and making 
cleaner use of heating and ventilation systems. 
  NOVEM's experience in energy saving in The Netherlands is a 
guideline. The Bulgarians were taught that they have to contend 
with not only a financial problem, but also a quality problem. 
According to NOVEM's T. Verkerk, Bulgaria can save 10 to 15 
percent of its energy consumption without any costs at all, and 
another 15 percent by making small investments. This project 
serves as an example and as a step toward wide scale energy 
saving projects to be funded by the Bulgarian Government, the 
East European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the 
World Bank.

  [Text] More than 200 people, including 180 Britons, were 
flown out of war-ravaged Yemen on a British Airways jet today. 
  The DC10 took off from the capital Sanaa with 225 evacuees 
on 
board at about 2 pm BST [British Summer Time]. "It all went very 
smoothly with no problems," a Foreign Office [FO] spokesman 
said. The aircraft is due to refuel at Larnaca, Cyprus, and 
arrive at Gatwick airport late tonight. 
  More than the expected 150 Britons turned up at the Sheraton 
Hotel, Sanaa, for the flight, and the remaining seats were taken 
by other nationalities. 
  As civil war raged in Yemen, Britons who have already 
returned said they had witnessed heavy fighting. One Briton who 
had already got out told BBC News: "I went out on to the balcony 
and saw flashes of light and explosions coming up from the 
airport and it was at that point that I thought, `This is it.'" 
Another said: "We were in a compound not 100 yards from the 
airport and there were bullets flying all over the place." 
Forty Britons who have already left were administration workers 
from the Canadian Occidental Petroleum company. They arrived at 
Stansted airport on Sunday [8 May]. 
  The airport in Sanaa has been effectively closed, but 
attacks 
seem to quieten during daylight hours, and banks, businesses, 
schools and restaraunts in the city are open. 
  The FO has urged Britons in Aden to leave with other foreign 
nationals aboard the French ship Jules Verne, which was due to 
set sail this morning for Djibouti. About 200 British nationals 
are thought to be left in the country after today's airlift and 
sailing.

<F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff, PRESS ASSOCIATION political editor] </F>
  [Text] Agriculture Minister Gillian Shephard today angrily 
warned the Bonn Government that Germany will "end up in court" 
if it goes ahead with a renewed threat to ban British beef 
imports because of mad cow disease. 
  The news that the ban had returned to the agenda after 
Germany had apparently withdrawn its threat was received in 
Westminster "like a bolt from the blue." 
  Britain and Germany are now heading for a bitter diplomatic 
battle over a proposal which Whitehall regards as illegal under 
the European Union [EU] single market rules. 
  The row flared up again when German Health Minister Horst 
Seehofer said today: "I can't wait any longer. It would be a 
culpable delay with all the possible legal consequences." He 
said he intended to introduce the ban this month. "We have a 
legal basis for the import ban in our meat hygiene law. We have 
checked this very carefully. If Brussels should stop us in 
whatever way, then Brussels will have to take responsibility for 
it." 
  But Mrs. Shephard did not agree. She told PA News: "It is on 
the agenda for the German Cabinet next week. Knowing this I was 
in touch with the EU Commissioner last week insisting that he 
should, before the Cabinet meeting, remind the German Government 
that imposing a unilateral ban within the EU obviously could not 
be allowed under European law. He agreed to do so. That was a 
pre-emptive strike because this is not allowed and they will 
have to end up in the court if this happens." 
  Mrs. Shephard said German Agriculture Minister Jochen 
Borchert disagreed with Mr. Seehofer on the issue. "The whole 
business is being regarded with great resentment by the German 
beef producers, who also want to prevent the German Cabinet from 
doing this. It is not a happy scene and we do know that it is 
politically motivated. The utterances of Mr. Seehofer make that 
absolutely clear." She said that each time this had come before 
the Council of Ministers, "Germany has gone away empty-handed." 
  Condemnation of the German threat came from all quarters of 
the Commons. Shadow agriculture minister Gavin Strang said: 
"There can be no justification for a unilateral ban on British 
beef." 
  Dr. Strang's front-bench colleague Elliott Morley said: 
"There is no evidence whatever, scientific or medical, to 
support the German fears." He agreed it was "cynical" for the 
Germans apparently to withdraw the threat just before last 
month's summit between John Major and Chancellor Helmut Kohl. 
  "It is clear they tried to put it on the back-burner so it 
would not interfere with negotiations at the summit," he said. 
Paul Tyler, the Liberal Democrat agriculture spokesman, said: 
"This shows that the much-vaunted special relationshsip between 
John Major and Chancellor Kohl is worthless. We had understood 
that this issue had been sorted out."

<F P=106> ["epd"-attributed report: "Schaeuble: Turkey Cannot Become </F>
EU Member"] 
  [Text] Mainz -- Wolfgang Schaeuble, chairman of the 
Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] 
Bundestag group, yesterday spoke out against Turkish European 
Union [EU] membership. "We should make it clear to Turkey that 
it cannot become a member of the European Union," Schaeuble told 
a meeting of Christian business people in Mainz. By doing so, 
one would do Turkey a favor and support the nonfundamentalist 
approach in Turkish politics. In Schaeuble's view, only such 
countries that are based on the Christian-Western tradition 
could be considered for membership to the European Union. This 
is why Russia, which apart from its European part also consists 
of an Asian part, cannot join the European Union either. At the 
same time, Schaeuble spoke out in favor of letting Turkey 
participate in the economic advantages resulting from the 
process of European unification. He also welcomed Turkish 
membership in the Council of Europe in Strasbourg. 
  Hermann Rappe, chairman of the trade union of chemical 
workers, also ruled out Turkish EU membership. In the long 
term, however, membership of Central European countries would be 
possible.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hans Peter Stihl, president of the </F>
Federation of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce, by F. 
Weckbach-Mara in Bonn; date not given: "Stihl: SPD Chancellor 
Bad for the Economy"] 
  [Text] [Weckbach-Mara] Politicians are talking about an 
economic upswing. When will the Germans profit? 
  [Stihl] The recession is bottoming out, but there cannot be 
any talk about a strong upswing yet. We expect an economic 
growth of approximately 1 percent throughout Germany this year. 
At the same time, however, unemployment will continue to rise 
and will reach about 4 million this year. A slight decline is 
expected next year. 
  [Weckbach-Mara] Which government would the economy prefer 
after the elections? 
  [Stihl] The German economy will cooperate with any 
democratically elected government. However, I admit that I 
would have considerable problems with the Greens. They are 
hostile to the economy and want to lead the state back to the 
last century. 
  [Weckbach-Mara] Would you prefer a Chancellor Scharping or 
his Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]? 
  [Stihl] With his government program, a Chancellor Scharping 
would pass on the burden of unification to the population by 
introducing a 20-percent supplementary surcharge. This is not 
fair and would be a big economic mistake. In addition, the SPD 
is planning changes concerning the taxes of family-owned 
enterprises. In many cases, a higher inheritance tax would lead 
to the sale of parts of firms or entire companies. The planned 
renunciation of nuclear energy would be unacceptable for the 
economy, and higher energy prices are against all reason. Thus, 
a changeover of power from Kohl to Scharping would have a 
negative impact on the economy and the creation of new jobs. 
  [Weckbach-Mara] Is that true? 
  [Stihl] Yes, it is. During Kohl's term of office, between 
1983 and 1993, a total of 2.7 million jobs were newly created. 
I cannot imagine that this successful development would 
continue under a Scharping government on the basis of the SPD 
program. 
  [Weckbach-Mara] It sounds as though you were completely 
happy with the current government. 
  [Stihl] No, we are not. We expect the government to 
bindingly promise the abolition of the solidarity surcharge. An 
annual examination alone is not sufficient. After three years 
at the latest, the solidarity surcharge should be gradually 
reduced. With this announcement, the government would force 
itself to save, which is necessary. It would also be useful to 
announce a fundamental reform of the social security system for 
the next legislative period. 
  [Weckbach-Mara] Do you support more retention? 
  [Stihl] Yes. One must really tell people that the existing 
social system will not be able to assume the costs for the 
treatment of diseases, for nursing care, and for old age in 20 
years' time. Thus, people should take out a supplementary 
insurance on a timely basis. A private life insurance is also 
required in addition to the pension insurance scheme, which 
numerous people already have.

<F P=106> [Interview with CDU Secretary General Peter Hintze by </F>
Hans-Werner Oertel; place and date not given: "The CDU Wants To 
Continue Playing a Leading Role in the East"] 
  [Text] [Oertel] Eastern Germany still has its specific 
features: an enormous social gap, on the one hand, and higher 
industrial growth rates than the west, on the other. What are 
the Christian Democratic Union's [CDU] concepts for the new 
laender? 
  [Hintze] First, we will have to continue promoting growth, 
which will be 7-8 percent in eastern Germany this year. We are 
on the right track in this respect. The second priority refers 
to subsidy cuts, and we would like to point out that this mainly 
refers to cuts in the west. Between 1991 and 1994, 25 percent 
of subsidies were cut in the west. We will have to repeat this 
between 1995 and 1997. 
  We will have to make sure that we keep the process that we 
have initiated in the new laender going. That is entirely clear 
to us. What is also important is a consistent support of their 
economic development. We have achieved particularly good 
results in this respect over the last few days. 
  [Oertel] Like what? 
  [Hintze] Take the chemical industry in Saxony-Anhalt, or 
electronics in Saxony, or the strong hopes that we now have for 
Thuringia. I think the reason why people talk less about the 
new laender now is because every field has been promoted by a 
very intense package of measures -- tax, legal, supportive, and 
economic measures. We have to make sure now that both 
tendencies -- growth and reduction of the inflation rate -- 
continue. 
  The great political challenge we face now is an all-German 
one; it can no longer be separated into east and west. 
  [Oertel] In spite of increasing wages, people in the east 
are afraid that real wages might continue to decline. What is 
your party's response to this? 
  [Hintze] We have to make sure there is not too wide a gap 
between wages and productivity. I think that this has meanwhile 
become a principle in eastern Germany as well. We are aiming at 
similar living conditions, but we have to do it in such a way 
that the economy can cope with it. This is a very important 
principle. All we can promise the population is that the 
increasing economy will bring about an adjustment of income 
levels. This entire economic process cannot be controlled by 
the state. Rather, conditions have to be improved so we can 
achieve this independently. We are well on our way with this. 
  We have a special problem in eastern Germany. We need the 
instruments of labor policy to a far greater extent there -- for 
the large number of people that do not have jobs yet through no 
fault of their own. 
  [Oertel] Do you expect the labor market situation to 
improve? 
  [Hintze] As many as five out of six economic institutes say 
that it will begin to improve in 1995. That means that the 
lowest point in employment has also been reached now in eastern 
Germany. The trend will be clearly upward from now on. I do not 
know whether we will see this expressed in real figures this 
year, but I certainly expect it for 1995. 
  [Oertel] Let us talk about landtag elections. The CDU is in 
the government everywhere except Brandenburg. Might there be a 
need for new alliances, perhaps with the Greens in Saxony? 
  [Hintze] In Saxony, I quite realistically expect Kurt 
Biedenkopf to win an absolute majority again, so we will not 
need a coalition partner at all. In the other laender, we will 
fight for a strategic majority, which will enable us to provide 
the minister-presidents and determine the way we want to form 
such governments. I would wish for the coalition with the Free 
Democratic Party [FDP] to be continued and for the FDP to show 
the necessary power in the election campaigns. 
  [Oertel] There has been a proposal by Mr. Mahrenholz that 
the hunt for small informers should come to an end now. What is 
your opinion on that? 
  [Hintze] I think this is a matter for those in charge in the 
new laender to discuss and to come up with a proposal. I do not 
think that such a proposal should come from western Germany. 
This should be discussed by those that were affected very 
strongly by the former GDR state. This does not mean that I am 
criticizing Mr. Mahrenholz, who, being a former constitutional 
judge, does, of course, have a right to contribute his view to 
the debate. I do not want to set a course in this question. 
  [Oertel] The Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS] must be 
taken seriously in the new laender: What is the CDU's way of 
dealing with them in view of the election campaign? 
  [Hintze] Our political opponents in the election campaign 
are the Social Democrats. Political cooperation with the PDS is 
no option for us, neither at the moment nor in the future. 
  [Oertel] Yet, CDU delegates have been elected with PDS votes 
in some places and joint votes were cast, as in Brandenburg. Do 
you consider that normal? 
  [Hintze] I am sticking to my statement: For me, there is no 
political cooperation with the PDS.

<F P=106> [Interview with CDU/CSU presidential candidate Roman Herzog </F>
by Helmut Kerscher, Heribert Prantl, and Martin E. Sueskind; 
place and date not given: "In God's Name, I Will Accept the 
Election"] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] The 
future president will, above all, have to be a president for the 
east Germans. Or do you believe that unification has now been 
accomplished and that it is important to treat it as something 
normal? 
  [Herzog] No, unification has not yet been completed. In 
fact, I am convinced that the need for spiritual unification is 
smaller than currently portrayed in the public discussion. Some 
people would like to have unified Germans. The Germans have 
always been a people with different tribes, and these tribes 
have always had completely different views. The citizens in the 
new laender are in a very difficult situation. Everyone who has 
a heart must primarily take care of them. Thus, the focal point 
of attention will certainly be in the new laender in the next 
few years. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] In the West, France assumes a special 
role at Germany's side. Will Poland one day play a similar role 
in the East? 
  [Herzog] I do not know to what extent this would be 
possible. In any event, it would be desirable. Our relationship 
with Poland is as burdened as our relationship was with France 
in the past. A certain reconciliation has been achieved with 
France. If something similar were possible with Poland, and 
also with the Czech Republic, this would be a big 
accomplishment. By the way, I believe that our major problem in 
our policy vis-a-vis East Europe is a psychological one. On the 
one hand, leaders in numerous capitals have expressed the hope 
for a German hegemony over East Europe, but, on the other, they 
also voiced the fear of such hegemonial efforts. I think the 
decisive political-psychological task in the next few years will 
be to dispel such expectations and fears -- not only verbally, 
but they must become unfounded. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Mr. Herzog, as president of the 
Constitutional Court, you have probably thought and written more 
about the meaning of the president's office than any former 
federal president. You are quite familiar with the competences 
of the head of state. Do you believe that basic or minor 
changes are required? 
  [Herzog] It is impossible for me to run for an office while 
at the same time saying what has to be changed. I ask for your 
understanding. People are usually referring to the election 
procedure when talking about changes. If we had a presidential 
system like the one in France or the United States, the 
president would naturally have to be elected by the people. 
Since we do not have this principle and the president should be 
suprapartisan, there can be no middle way. Otherwise Germany 
would have to decide in favor of a semi-presidential and 
semi-parliamentarian system. However, there is not the slightest 
reason for such a step. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] You claim that there is no reason. 
But would you support such a move? 
  [Herzog] I would not support it. The idea that the 
president's office is weak actually prevails to a certain extent 
among the German people. This is due to the fact that they are 
convinced that laws, administrative decrees, and such determine 
our lives. Yet this is only true to a limited extent. Apart 
from that, a moral instance is also needed -- somebody who 
admonishes, warns, encourages beyond what is stipulated in the 
code of law, as the British claim. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] You are probably the first candidate 
for this office who links the acceptance of the election with a 
certain condition. Could you explain this condition to us? 
  [Herzog] My condition is: The required majority must not be 
solely achieved with the eight votes of the Republikaner. In 
other words: I need 50 percent plus nine votes in the first two 
ballots, and nine votes more than the next-strongest candidate 
in the third ballot. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Theoretically, this might have the 
effect that you reject the election despite a narrow absolute 
majority? 
  [Herzog] Theoretically, this would be possible. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Would it be possible for you to run 
again in another round if you rejected the election in the first 
ballot? Do you consider that possible politically? 
  [Herzog] Politically, it is possible. I would even have a 
respectable motive. Yet, I do not consider this a likely 
scenario. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] However, in the event of this 
scenario: Would you run again? 
  [Herzog] If my party wants that, then I will go through all 
three ballots. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] In the unlikely event that you 
receive six or eight votes more than the absolute majority 
because of a sudden split in the Free Democratic Party of 
Germany, would you reject the election? 
  [Herzog] Yes. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] And run again in the third ballot? 
  [Herzog] Yes. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Is this not an invitation for your 
rivals to proceed in the same way? 
  [Herzog] My motive is completely different. I believe that 
the fight against the Republikaner is a task on the right 
fringes of the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union 
(CDU/CSU). Thus, the presidential candidate cannot simply say: 
I welcome every vote from this side. Second, I want to avoid a 
situation like the one in 1969, when the votes of the National 
Democratic Party of Germany were decisive in the vote of the 
candidates Gerhard Schroeder versus Gustav Heinemann -- which 
backfired. I believe it is always better to be open about one's 
dealings. The third and most important reason was: If I had 
not announced my plans at such an early stage, a journalist 
would have called me every morning for the past four months, 
asking whose support I want. And I would have had to give 
evasive answers, which is not my style. Things are clear for me 
in this respect. Of course, I knew that someone would ask 
Johannes Rau about the Party of Democratic Socialism at some 
point. Yet, this was not my motive, whether you believe it or 
not. I acted on the basis of the three motives I just mentioned. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Let me ask you one final question, 
which results from your commentary on the election procedure 
stipulated in the Basis Law. In the event that you are elected 
on 23 May at the Berlin Reichstag, will you accept the election 
immediately or will you make use of the legal 48 hours for 
reflection? 
  [Herzog] In view of the uncertain situation at the Federal 
Postal Administration, I would say, in God's name, I accept the 
election.

<F P=106> [Interview with CDU presidential candidate Roman Herzog by </F>
Michael Jach and Ulrich Reitz; place and date not given: "`I 
Love the German People'"] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [FOCUS] What is your 
definition of patriotism? 
  [Herzog] I will put it in very simple terms: I love the 
German people -- with their many good sides and great mistakes. 
For me the state is a tool created by man to solve certain 
problems. I find it less easy to identify myself with the state 
than with the people. For me the state is only one part of 
society -- a subsystem, to use a term from political science. 
[passage omitted] 
  [FOCUS] You are in favor of dual citizenship. Would it be 
more consistent to introduce the ius soli [citizenship 
determined by place of birth] in Germany, according to which 
anybody born here would be German? 
  [Herzog] I do not want to comment on the ius soli here. 
Dual citizenship has to remain the exception for me, 
particularly in the following cases: second-or third-generation 
foreigners who were born here and live here are hardly any 
different from Germans. They have to be offered German 
citizenship. If accepting German citizenship were impossible 
because their country of origin would not release them from 
their inherited nationality, then one should at least consider 
the possibility of giving them a German passport as a second 
passport. Those who do not want to become Germans should be 
conceded a generous amount of time to make a decision. If they 
decide against German citizenship, we should tell them: We 
expect you to return to the country that you obviously regard as 
your home country. This is the same situation that Germans and 
Poles faced when they emigrated to the United States. [passage 
omitted] 
  [FOCUS] One of the major debates of our time is about 
Europe. Is the European nation state a desirable vision? 
  [Herzog] No, because I do not see such a state for the rest 
of my life or for the lifetime of my children. I do not think 
that nation states, whose sovereignty has long since 
disintegrated into thin air anyway, will disappear completely. 
I do, however, regard it as possible that a stronger feeling of 
belonging together will emerge in the European countries, not 
least as a result of the challenges that our European culture is 
facing from countries that do not share our way of coexistence. 
Islam, for example, is challenging us to justify our own 
lifestyle anew. 
  [FOCUS] So European patriotism, too? 
  [Herzog] If you want: yes.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Rau Has Almost No Chance"] </F>
  [Text] The chances of North Rhine-Westphalian 
Minister-President Johannes Rau [Social Democratic Party] 
becoming the next German president have deteriorated markedly 
shortly before the elections. A discussion with FDP [Free 
Democratic Party of Germany] federal chairman Klaus Kinkel was 
disappointing for Rau. During the meeting, which had been 
planned months in advance and repeatedly postponed by the FDP 
because of an alleged lack of time, Kinkel promised Rau his 
sympathy and support, but made it clear that he felt obliged to 
recommend Union candidate Roman Herzog to the FDP electorate 
before the third round of voting. Kinkel assumed that most of 
his party colleagues will follow his example. This support for 
Herzog is essential, claimed Kinkel, otherwise, following the 
go-ahead to form a coalition with the Union, he might risk 
splitting the FDP and alarming the voters.

<F P=106> [Interview with Johannes Rau, minister-president of North </F>
Rhine-Westfalia, by Ulrich Bieger and Manfred Ertel; place and 
date not given: "`So Many Positive Signals'"] 
  [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Rau, on your Easter vacation did 
you, as is rumored among your party colleagues, secretly 
decorate the children's rooms in Berlin's Bellevue Castle, the 
official residence of the president of the Federal Republic? 
  [Rau] That would have been nice. No, I spent one week at 
home 
catching up on some papers, after which I traveled for just 
under 14 days to the northern part of the Black Forest to take 
some time to myself to think things over and to gather renewed 
strength for difficult weeks to come. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] What for? The campaign for the office of the 
presidency has been under way for weeks, practically without you. 
  [Rau] I do not intend to wage a campaign anyway, since that 
is not in keeping with the office. I have not held back much on 
political issues, but I have no personal strategy, and I do not 
intend to arrange my schedule based upon whether it serves that 
goal. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Your opponents are less punctilious about 
this; 
they are using nearly every forum available to make themselves 
look good. They are taking part in television panel discussions, 
even without Johannes Rau, and have even allowed themselves to 
be photographed at family Easter gatherings. Are you too good 
for publicity when it comes to your own affairs? 
  [Rau] I have been involved in politics for more than three 
decades. So it is only natural that I am more widely known, even 
compared with the other three respectable candidates. Many 
people have an image of me; I do not need to artificially add 
anything to it. On the other hand, I was not totally idle during 
my vacation. I wrote a letter to Roman Herzog on the occasion of 
his 60th birthday.... 
  [DER SPIEGEL] ...quite confidentially, of course, to avoid 
any public attention. 
  [Rau] It was not confidential, just personal. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Representatives of very different political 
currents are in the running to succeed Richard von Weizsaecker. 
Is a confrontation not imperative? 
  [Rau] No, because the delegates must decide according to 
their conscience. In that sense my fate is in their hands. I 
hope, however, that they will not base their decision on the 
Bundestag elections on 16 October, and that they will not ask 
themselves how this or that decision will affect this or that 
coalition, but that they will base their decision on the almost 
2,000 days that will follow. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Your election could be the signal for a 
political change in Germany. Do you not owe at least your party, 
the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany], a little more 
commitment? 
  [Rau] Up to now, no discussion with my party has confirmed 
such an assumption. It is my impression that this style is 
exactly what those with whom I work closely within the SPD want. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Fellow party members, even some in the SPD 
leadership are not at all pleased with your restraint, and even 
feel imposed upon somewhat, seeing that they are having to try 
to enlist support for candidate Rau within the FDP [Free 
Democratic Party]. 
  [Rau] About that you are wrong. I know of no one who feels I 
have used him or her, neither somewhat or any other way. 
  [SER SPIEGEL] Have you secretly written off the election, 
perhaps? 
  [Rau] Not at all. However I do not deny that I live up to 
the 
image you have shown of me as one who hesitates on the question 
of my chances of success. There are days when I believe that the 
widespread approval I see in all opinion polls taken among the 
populace will be reflected in the federal assembly. And then 
there are days when I have the impression that the factions are 
firmly in place. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] You used to be more certain of victory. 
  [Rau] Possibility causes one to hope, but makes one wary of 
self-assuredness. I have never been sure of myself, but I do 
consider it quite possible that I will be elected. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] For the Bundestag elections, the FDP has 
committed itself to a coalition with the union. A preliminary 
decision in favor of the union candidate Roman Herzog? 
  [Rau] It does not appear to be. On the contrary, much 
evidence suggests the FDP leadership wanted to secure, and in 
fact has secured, more room to maneuver with its preliminary 
declaration of a coalition. This way, if Hildegard 
Hamm-Bruecher's candidacy is unsuccessful, the party will decide 
who is to receive her votes in an internal clarification 
proceeding prior to the third ballot. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Juergen Moellemann, North Rhine-Westfalian FDP 
land party chairman and Rau supporter, would like all liberal 
delegates to yield to a majority vote. Would that increase your 
chances? 
  [Rau] That is how it was run in 1969, and it brought success 
to Gustav Heinemann. The FDP will have to decide whether or not 
that is the best strategy for 1994. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Will you allow yourself to be elected by the 
SED's [Socialist Unity Party of Germany] successor party, the 
PDS [Party of Democratic Socialism]? 
  [Rau] I do not know how, after a secret ballot election, one 
is to determine who elected him. I am campaigning for votes from 
the center groups in the federal assembly, and not from the 
fringes. And I have received so many positive signals from the 
democratic parties over the past two years that there is a 
realistic chance. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] If Roman Herzog or Johannes Rau wins by a 
narrow margin it will be easy to figure out whether or not votes 
from the extreme camp were decisive in the victory. Roman Herzog 
has announced that in this case he will decline his election. 
  [Rau] I believe it is wrong to assign the PDS or the 
Republikaner the role of arbitrator based upon prior statements. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The union would be pleased to see the SPD and 
the SED successor back in the same political boat. That would 
liven things up. 
  [Rau] That will not catch on, even if some individuals try 
to 
paddle in that direction, because it is totally unrealistic. 
There is no shallow water there. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] But Helmut Kohl accuses you of having betrayed 
German unification by making concessions to the GDR, in hopes of 
receiving election campaign assistance from East Berlin in the 
1987 Bundestag elections. 
  [Rau] That campaign collapsed long ago because it is without 
any degree of truth. Regarding the issue of German citizenship 
in the negotiations with the GDR, I offered nothing more than 
what Wolfgang Schaeuble offered as the representative of the 
Federal Government, namely that citizenship in the GDR would be 
honored. And I can imagine no greater honor of such citizenship 
than Erich Honecker's official visit to Helmut Kohl in 1987. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] You have been the minister-president of North 
Rhine-Westfalia for 16 years, so you have power. What attracts 
you to a role as a representative? 
  [Rau] I sometimes feel that this society is flying off in 
different directions because there is too little consensus. I am 
concerned over the democratic development in Germany. This is 
dealt with not through organizational means but by bringing 
people together. This task requires a federal president who is 
endowed with the ability to listen and who is a powerful 
speaker, but who will not gloss over the undebatable ugly side 
of practical politics. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] What practical role, then, could you play as 
federal president against enemies of democracy from the Right? 
  [Rau] For me the following maxim rings true: Sects are the 
fault of the churches. In other words wherever democratic powers 
permit deficits to become marked, the resulting vacuum will be 
filled by nondemocratic powers. That is what happened in Weimar, 
which was ruined not by the extremists but by the shortage of 
democrats. That is why we need a strengthening of the democratic 
forces most of all. The federal president can do this in the way 
in which he observes his office. And acts of symbolism are a 
part of this. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Do you fear Italian attitudes--a weakened 
capitalistic center, a draw for extreme rightists? 
  [Rau] I would not go as far as that. Our problem is not the 
collapse of parties that no longer have the power to renew 
themselves; our problem is primarily the conflict between east 
and west, which has not yet been solved; it is about bringing 
the people together, about bridging deep gaps between the two 
parts of the republic. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The SPD missed an opportunity for an act of 
symbolism when it rejected the proposal for a joint candidate 
from the east. Instead it was left up to CDU/CSU [Christian 
Democratic Union/Christian Social Union] Caucus Chairman 
Wolfgang Schaeuble to make a stand for the east Berlin social 
democrat and theologian Richard Schroeder. 
  [Rau] My impression was that this was a journalistic trial 
balloon. I know of no discussion during which the CDU/CSU is 
supposed to have actually made this offer. I have spoken with 
Richard Schroeder regarding my candidacy, both before and after 
my candidacy was announced. I also believe it is wrong to tie 
the question of who is suitable to be federal president to his 
or her origins, or gender, or religion. The office is unique, 
the question is: Who is now the right one for it? 
  [DER SPIEGEL] If the Bundestag is unable to agree on a 
majority chancellor, it becomes the duty of the federal 
president to decide whether to dissolve parliament and call for 
new elections or to appoint a minority chancellor. Herzog, an 
expert on the constitution, is concerned that the president 
would be committed to the candidate with the most votes. Do you 
agree? 
  [Rau] No, I feel that the federal president can be 
thoroughly 
in control of this situation under the current Basic Law. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] This structure apparently reminds Herzog of 
1993, when Reich President Hindenburg appointed Adolf Hitler as 
chancellor of the Reich. 
  [Rau] I cannot accept this comparison. We live not in 
Weimar, 
but in a republic that has demonstrated its stability over 45 
years and in which there have never been any fundamental 
constitutional conflicts. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Are you in favor of a popular election of the 
federal president. 
  [Rau] On this question I am biased because I know, of 
course, 
that I would have a majority. However, the argument brought 
forth by the current president, who does not have or no longer 
has any reservations regarding direct elections since we are the 
only country that operates this way, has made me think. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] So, a coquettish yes. 
  [Rau] Not exactly. Before we were to resort to direct 
elections, from which I would have much to gain, we would have 
to consider increasing the responsibilities of the federal 
president, without altering the structure of the Basic Law. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Taking power from the federal chancellor and 
aiming toward a more strongly presidential system? 
  [Rau] No, not borrowing from America or France, but 
strengthening the position of the president between government 
and parliament, for example in appointments to the highest 
courts or in calling up independent committees. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] As federal president would you promote and 
pursue political discussion regarding direct elections? 
  [Rau] I can certainly see doing that, particularly if the 
debate over the new Basic Law is shifted away from the 
Constitutional Committee and if the possibility of a public 
plebiscite is discussed. Just as I can well imagine debate over 
a single, seven-year term of office for the federal president 
without the option of reelection. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Have you seriously considered the possibility 
of a defeat on 23 May? 
  [Rau] I hope I have done so enough. If I were not elected 
federal president, it would certainly be a personal 
disappointment for me, and I would need to stop and take a deep 
breath. I am certain, however, that afterward I would find the 
strength to continue my political work into 1995, and that my 
pleasure in doing so would increase. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Your friends in the SPD do not seem as certain 
by any means, and remember anxiously your deep depression 
following your defeat as the leading candidate in the 1987 
Bundestag elections. 
  [Rau] Three times during my political career I have been 
faced with the question of whether or not I should quit. The 
time of the Bundestag elections was not one of these, however, 
although I do not deny that I was hurt by it. 
  The first of these three times was in April 1990, when I 
stood only 50 centimeters away from Oscar Lafontaine during the 
assassination attempt, and when the woman said the next day she 
had actually wanted to kill Rau, but he had stood too awkwardly. 
The second time was after a serious illness during the summer of 
1992, from which, luckily, I have completely recovered. And the 
third time was on 29 May 1993, when at eight o'clock in the 
morning I stood in front of the house in Solingen in which five 
Turkish women and girls had been burned. At that moment I 
thought it is not worth it, you cannot change the world. 
  All three times I found the strength to continue. I am 
certain that I will also be able to do so if I do not receive 
the majority of votes in the federal assembly. Then I hope to 
lead the SPD in North Rhine-Westfalia in the 1995 elections. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Rau, we thank you for this interview.

<F P=106> [Interview with SPD leader Rudolf Scharping by Elisabeth </F>
Niejahr and Klaus Wirtgen; place and date not given: "I Still 
Have My Head"] 
  [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Eggs were thrown at the Social 
Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] chairman at a May rally in 
Hamburg. In Trier, Interior Minister Manfred Kanther (Christian 
Democratic Union) had to cut short his speech because of the 
asylum policy and weapons exports to Turkey. There is general 
indignation about the entire political mess. This is all 
because of your flirting with the Union. 
  [Scharping] Seven thousand people in Hamburg, 200 from the 
"Black Bloc," two dozen eggs, and then indignation toward the 
entire political mess. Do you seriously consider the "Black 
Bloc" to be a barometer of political development? 
  [DER SPIEGEL] That is how 1968 started. A grand coalition 
was in power then. 
  [Scharping] There will be no grand coalition this time; you 
know that. It is historically inaccurate to compare the reform 
and student movement of the 1960's with the violence-prone 
"autonomists" of today. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Are you not worried about being called "Helmut 
Scharping" or "Kohl with a beard" all the time? 
  [Scharping] That is enough of the cliches. Shall we get to 
the point? 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Many citizens say you and Kohl share a similar 
understanding of politics -- both of you want power. 
  [Scharping] No political changes can be made without a 
majority. But my understanding of politics is fundamentally 
different from that of Dr. Kohl. Let me give you an example. 
In over 200 public meetings over the space of several months, 
the SPD discussed a government program and opened itself up to 
nonmembers. No other party has done that. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] An internal paper for the Union faction 
leadership says: "One should note that a lot of the starting 
positions presented by the SPD could also be adopted by the 
Christian Democratic Union/Christian Socialist Union [CDU/CSU] 
without any alterations. The programmatic declarations about 
the need to safeguard jobs, create new jobs, and combat 
unemployment cannot be emphasized highly enough." 
  [Scharping] All that means is that the Union wants to adopt 
the SPD's definitions. Anyone wishing to understand the CDU's 
policies must view the results of those policies -- for 
instance, the highest state debts and highest unemployment ever. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Despite the fact that unemployment has hardly 
fallen at all, how do you explain that surveys indicate that 
your popularity and that of the chancellor are growing closer 
together, and that the Union once again comes before the SPD in 
terms of economic prerogatives? 
  [Scharping] I read quite different opinions last week, even 
in DER SPIEGEL. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Perhaps more and more voters are becoming 
discouraged because you and the SPD lack a profile. Take a look 
at employment policy. 
  [Scharping] In Germany this year, there are about 500,000 
more unemployed people than there were last year. Foreign 
demand is increasing. That means we are reaping the fruits of 
better economic policies in other countries. On the other hand, 
this government has drastically cut the amount of funds 
available for an active labor market policy, resulting in 
700,000 people losing their jobs. We must close the gap 
concerning investments and innovation or else there will be no 
new jobs. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] On the subject of social justice, your own 
supporters do not see any originality. The magazine of IG 
Metall wrote that the SPD and the CDU's concepts of taxation 
policy are as effective as a fire extinguisher in a prairie fire. 
  [Scharping] No. We are going to make three decisions. 
First of all, we will effectively help families with children 
by means of a child benefit of 250 marks [DM] per month for 
every child. Second, we will make the lowest wages free of tax. 
Third, we will dispense with Kohl and Waigel's idea of a 
7.5-percent surtax on every taxpayer and replace it with an 
extra tax on incomes from DM120,000 upwards in the case of 
married couples, and DM60,000 upwards in the case of single 
people. That will relieve over 80 percent of the population, 
release demand, and set the economy on its legs. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] How will you fill the DM40-50-billion tax 
loophole that will arise when you make the lowest wage levels 
free of tax? 
  [Scharping] If the problem is solved within the framework of 
the taxation system, there will he no loophole. We will see 
what the experts Waigel has appointed to deal with the tariff 
reform suggest. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Your central topic is the combating of 
unemployment. Have you a chance of winning when the economic 
upturn occurs? 
  [Scharping] Yes. The SPD's chances are increasing. Apart 
from that, I would be happy just like every sensible person if 
unemployment dropped. But before that can happen, the economic 
situation in Germany must improve. Therefore, we do not want to 
raise state expenditures above the levels planned in 1995, and 
even reduce them in the medium term. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Is the economic upturn not already visible? 
  [Scharping] Tyll Necker, chairman of the Association of 
German Industry, says that what we have now is no upturn. It is 
merely a "turn" without the "up." All the experts agree. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] According to surveys, more and more people 
believe things will improve. Thus, more and more people no 
longer belong to the SPD. 
  [Scharping] The SPD is in the lead, and a good thing, too. 
The coalition has not had a majority for months. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The SDP has once again eaten away at your 
leading position with the debate on the speed limit. 
  [Scharping] I consider this debate premature. In any case, 
the SPD also wants a speed limit on freeways. Just like in the 
United States and Japan, we must treat environmental change as a 
scientific challenge. All development must be environmentally 
friendly. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] That is exactly what the automobile industry 
is saying. After all, it is the SDP that said for decades that 
a low speed limit is a gauge of environmental responsibility. 
  [Scharping] That is why the speed limit forms part of the 
program. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] You have not included a 130-kmh speed limit in 
the program. The SPD has hidden this figure behind the 
resolutions of the European Parliament. 
  [Scharping] But the resolutions of the European Parliament 
are clear. The 130-kmh limit will apply to some 90 percent of 
all freeways. There is no question of concealment. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Your financial spokesman Oskar Lafontaine 
refuses point blank to tell motorists what kind of gasoline 
price increase the SPD's tax reform calls for. Are you afraid 
to tell the truth before the elections? 
  [Scharping] No, I am not, but the safeguarding of jobs by 
means of environmentally friendly growth has priority. In the 
previous presidential election campaign in 1990, the SPD 
demanded that labor be made less cost-intensive and that the 
consumption of energy and raw materials should not be 
detrimental to the environment. At that time, we wanted a tax 
allowance for using one's car for business purposes, and we 
wanted car tax to be converted to a tax on gasoline. After 
that, we thought to ourselves in 1990, the gasoline tax could be 
gradually increased. But what happened? There is still no tax 
allowance on the use of cars for business purposes, but there is 
still a car tax. The Bonn coalition has raised the gasoline tax 
by about 40 pfennigs, despite its promises and following a loud 
spate of election propaganda against the SPD. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Is that why the SPD has no courage to face the 
truth? 
  [Scharping] On the contrary. The traffic sector must bear 
the costs it incurs. Let me repeat that jobs and growth come 
first. Therefore, we must put an end to new taxes and levies. I 
want to have a modern country that helps citizens, not one that 
keeps on imposing new taxes on them. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] We were talking about the future financial 
burden on motorists. 
  [Scharping] Motorists are already burdened enough as it is. 
Anyone who wants to see a gasoline price of DM5 per liter, like 
the Greens do, goes against the spirit of the broad ecological 
reform policy that we in the SPD would like to see. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The voters expect anyone capable of predicting 
the errors of others to give accurate information about his own 
plans. 
  [Scharping] Ernst Ulrich von Weizsaecker from the Wuppertal 
Environmental Institute supports a continuous increase in energy 
prices. But even he says that to encourage environmentally 
friendly development and increase purchasing power, there should 
be no further financial burdens on the motoring sector. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] But how do you finance the development of a 
car that consumes three liters of gas per 100 km if you do not 
drastically raise gasoline prices? 
  [Scharping] That is a question of new technology in car 
engines and materials. Automobile companies are reacting to 
international competition and rising energy prices. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Your program also says that carbon dioxide 
emissions should be reduced by at least one-quarter by the year 
2005. At the same time, you want to consume the same coal 
levels as today. Experts say one cannot do both at the same 
time. 
  [Scharping] We must improve the efficiency of fuel, like the 
case of modern power stations -- for example, those in Saarland. 
Preserving the coal mining industry and providing it with a 
secure financial framework involves much more than just 
safeguarding jobs. Apart from that, a modern energy policy is 
impossible without solar energy. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] In his latest book, which he considers a kind 
of pro-SPD election guide, Helmut Schmidt warns against further 
subsidies for jobs that he considers eternally dependent on 
budget support, mentioning the coal and steel industries and 
agriculture as an example. 
  [Scharping] I am pleased about Helmut Schmidt's support. 
However, that does not mean we think alike on every issue. He 
has his own head, and I have mine. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] You have set your party a task very early. 
Within the Union spectrum, the SPD could win 15 percent of the 
votes; within the Greens spectrum, it might win 4 percent. 
  [Scharping] Not quite. I said that some 15 percent of the 
electorate fluctuates between the CDU and SPD, and 4 percent 
fluctuates between the SPD and Greens. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Many have interpreted this as a call to 
compete for the political center. 
  [Scharping] It is not a question of competition. The point 
is that the SPD has returned to the center of social problems. 
We are dealing here with a competition between the CDU and the 
SPD concerning the political leadership in Germany. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] How seriously do you take the warning of 
Reinhard Klimmt, SPD faction chief in the Saarland, one of your 
closest aides, whereby the SPD would jeopardize its "political 
efficiency" if it neglected the environmentally conscious part 
of its electorate and the social movements? According to him, 
one-third of SPD voters give second preference to the Greens, 
and 80 percent of the Greens give second preference to the SPD. 
  [Scharping] It is our joint conviction that reform policy 
geared to the year 2000 and beyond must combine an essential 
economic growth with equally essential environmental progress. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Then how do you explain the criticism of Green 
spokesman Ludger Volmer, who feels nothing but malice vis-a-vis 
the SPD program? 
  [Scharping] That man is waging an election struggle. The 
Greens, however, enjoy no political monopoly. They have no 
right to decide who or what is environmental, like some high 
priest. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Fewer and fewer Greens fancy sharing a 
government with Scharping's SPD, and, five months before the 
elections, the political distance from the Union is becoming 
smaller and smaller. 
  [Scharping] The strongest party always finds a partner. In 
the end, there will be more partners than necessary. That 
increases the SPD's possibilities and makes it easier to 
negotiate. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] You said that even if you lose the elections, 
you will still go to Bonn to lead the opposition. Are you sure 
your comrades would like to have you in this role? 
  [Scharping] I am going to Bonn, preferably as chancellor. 
Can you imagine Germany enjoying a good future with another 
four years of Kohl? 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Thank you for the interview, Herr Scharping.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Herzog Should Have Kept Quiet"] </F>
  [Text] The FDP [Free Democratic Party] leadership is angry 
with Roman Herzog, the Union's presidential candidate. FDP 
General Secretary Werner Hoyer told the press in Bonn on Monday 
[9 May] that not even the "intervention" of the president of the 
Constitutional Court during the weekend had altered the demands 
of the liberals concerning the possibility of dual citizenship. 
In press interviews, Herzog had said that foreigners who do not 
wish to take German citizenship should go back to their 
countries of origin. The FDP acknowledged Herzog's stance, said 
Hoyer. However, he continued, the FDP wonders whether it is a 
good thing for the Union's presidential candidate to give so 
many press and television interviews. 
  Hoyer said that the FDP leadership fails to understand why 
Herzog should once again remind it that the Union has left the 
liberals in the lurch on the subject of dual citizenship. It 
would have been better if Herzog, who needs the FDP's votes for 
his election, had kept quiet. However, the FDP leadership 
considers it in its interests to back Herzog instead of Johannes 
Rau for the office of president. 
  Hoyer was speaking during a presentation of the FDP election 
program, due to be adopted at the FDP congress in Rostock at the 
beginning of June. The FDP Presidium's draft resolution 
presents the FDP as a "party of better wage-earners." "We are 
the party of the producers and higher wage-earners of today and 
tomorrow, and we want to give as many people as possible the 
opportunity to become better wage-earners," says the resolution. 
However, the FDP does not wish to repeat the Social Democratic 
Party of Germany's "ghastly mistake" of attempting to define a 
borderline between "better" and "worse" wage-earners, said 
Hoyer. The FDP is also interested in people who have decided to 
become better wage-earners through greater productivity. 
Performance must once again be profitable, said Hoyer, a 
principle that the FDP wants to implement with its "civic 
benefit" concept, which is geared to the poverty line. Whoever 
earns wages above the poverty line should pay tax; whoever earns 
wages below the poverty line should receive this "civic 
benefit," which includes such social payments as child benefit, 
educational grants, family income supplement, and unemployment 
benefit. But only a part of one's income should be taken into 
account in this system, so that "it is profitable to work." 
  After two years of work, the FDP draft election program lays 
down the FDP's stance on all spheres of politics. It mentions 
the creation of new jobs, the internal unification of Germany, 
and the assumption of political coresponsibility as some of the 
most important objectives during the next parliamentary term of 
office. The FDP wants to create new jobs by easing the tax 
burden, among other things. The new laender should receive tax 
concessions whereby products by east German manufacturers might 
carry a lower rate of value-added tax. 
  The FDP election program should again provide the basis for 
coalition talks with the Union, if the voters permit the 
coalition to continue, said Hoyer. The FDP's demands include a 
review of the solidarity tax surcharge after three years, the 
liberalization of store opening hours, a five-year time limit on 
subsidies, the abolition of car tax by raising gasoline tax, and 
the gradual abolition of commercial tax. A so-called major 
offensive to combat organized crime has been rejected in keeping 
with FDP Chairman Klaus Kinkel's position.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "No Splendor in That Cottage--The FDP </F>
in the New Laender Has Gambled Away the Genscher Bonus"] 
  [Text] When CDU [Christian Democratic Union] Caucus Leader 
Juergen Scharf passes by the table reserved for the FDP [Free 
Democratic Party] regulars in the cafeteria at the Magdeburg 
Landtag he usually loses his appetite. In the past there has 
been only infighting among the liberal coalition partners. 
  If a Social Democrat is standing nearby, Scharf pulls him 
aside and gibes: "Look closely. You will not be happy with this 
party." 
  The SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] feels it has a 
good chance of forming the government after the coming landtag 
elections. Whether the Free Democrats will even be available as 
coalition partners at that point seems most uncertain; their 
entry into parliament is seriously threatened. 
  For the liberals in the east--at least in land 
politics--things are going downhill. Although the most recent 
Emnid poll still promises 9 percent for the FDP-East in the 
Bundestag elections, the prognosis for the five land parliaments 
that will also be elected this year is less optimistic. 
According to the results of a poll taken at the request of CDU 
Minister-President Bernhard Vogel, in Thuringia the Free 
Democrats come away with only 4 percent. In Saxony they get only 
3 percent. 
  Since Hans-Dietrich Genscher, who is admired as a folk hero 
by the east Germans for his liberation of the refugees from the 
Prague embassy in the fall of 1989, withdrew from politics, the 
eastern liberals have been without a draft horse. 
  "We still have no classic liberal voter potential here as 
they have in the west," laments Saxony-Anhalt's FDP Chairman 
Peter Kunert. Party Leader Klaus Kinkel blames the poor results 
in the polls in the new laender on the "absence of a middle 
class." 
  The principal blame for the wretched state of affairs, 
however, is borne by the Free Democrats from the east. 
Supporters of their policy are colorless. As one Bonn 
functionary has admitted: "There are no fine surprises in the 
east." 
  These days, leading liberals in the east are arousing keen 
interest only in the justice arena. The Department of Public 
Prosecutors is conducting investigations of Thuringian FDP 
Caucus Leader Andreas Kniepert on suspicion of coercion, and of 
Peter Kunert, the FDP chief in Saxony Anhalt, on suspicion of 
breach of trust. Kniepert is suspected of having placed undue 
pressure on an official in the Thuringian roadhouse affair; 
Kunert is involved in shady property deals. 
  The lone FDP-East member in the Bonn Government, Minister of 
Education Rainer Ortleb, was forced to step down last February 
because of overtaxing. 
  Even so, things started out well for the liberals with 
unification. Through skillful management practices they were 
able to take over two coalitions right away: the 
Liberal-Democratic Party of Germany and the National-Democratic 
Party of Germany (NDPD), which was founded by the SED [Socialist 
Unity Party of Germany] in 1948 as a catch-all for former Nazis. 
Immediately after unification the FDP-East had around 170,000 
members. But 140,000 of these later turned away from the party 
in disappointment. 
  The liberals in the new laender have never established a 
reputation in economic policy, a classically FDP domain. In 
Thuringia, liberal Economics Minister Juergen Bohn has come 
under fire for his passivity in the crisis surrounding the 
Bischofferode potash works. Unions and employers' associations 
alike have attested to the incompetence of this FDP member. 
  In Saxony the liberals, who with eight representatives are 
the smallest opposition group next to the SPD, the PDS [Party of 
Democratic Socialism], and the Greens, are seeking to attract 
attention by adopting a staunchly conservative line. Caucus 
Leader Ludwig Martin Rade willingly attacks the liberal left of 
his own party, for example Bonn Justice Minister Sabine 
Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger because she rejects the deportation 
of Kurds. 
  Rade would prefer to govern under Minister-President Kurt 
Biedenkopf, but the Christian Democrat keeps himself sheltered. 
The alliance Greens are possible partners if the CDU fails to 
acquire the absolute majority in the landtag elections in 
September. 
  In Brandenburg the party remains true, though apathetically, 
to Minister-President Manfred Stolpe. The FDP, criticizes Mario 
Quast, land leader of the Young Liberals, is "too concerned with 
itself." Party members accuse Land Chairman Detlev Paepke of 
being more concerned with his firm than with the land 
association. 
  In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania the FDP, which governs the 
land jointly with the CDU, bravely announces that it will remain 
a "reliable partner" in the future--it just does not know for 
whom. Caucus Leader Walter Goldbeck, who according to the 
SCHWERINER VOLKSZEITUNG is a "relative unknown," would gladly 
continue the liaison with the Christian Democrats. But their 
election victory is questionable based upon the current voter 
atmosphere. 
  The liberal organization network in the east is full of 
holes, particularly in the countryside. In many cities and 
villages in Western Pomerania "the FDP does not exist," laments 
Goldbeck. 
  In addition, the Free Democrats suffer from an increase in 
the ratio of older members to younger members: The party's 
junior organization, the Young Liberals, has only a few hundred 
active members in the new laender. In Brandenburg there are only 
a couple of dozen. 
  The liberals may face their greatest losses in 
Saxony-Anhalt, 
where the FDP received 13.5 percent of the votes in the 1990 
landtag elections, thanks to Genscher, who was born in Halle. 
Genscher's epigones have long since recklessly gambled away the 
Genscher bonus. 
  For months a bitter battle over posts and sinecures has 
raged 
between the Saale and the Elbe. At the land party conference in 
March Peter Kunert fought his way tooth and nail to the top of 
the land list of party candidates for the coming landtag 
elections. Many Free Democrats are unhappy with him for his role 
following the Magdeburg salary affair, when Kunert called for 
new elections, against the will of the FDP landtag parliamentary 
caucus. 
  The party conference was barely over before FDP members 
began 
to doubt the legitimacy of the nomination of the candidates. The 
land chief election official has already made public his 
misgivings over allowing the party to participate in the 
election on 26 June. 
  Kunert's opponent, Environmental Minister Wolfgang Rauls, 
has 
been on the black list of the FDP leadership since details 
regarding his past as a member of the NDPD district control 
commission were revealed. Halle native Genscher has reacted with 
particular harshness. 
  Despite all of this, Party Leader Kunert radiated passionate 
optimism at the land party conference. He drummed his point, 
that the party is "stronger than ever before," into the heads of 
the 300 delegates. Then he promised them "double-digit returns." 
  Hans-Dietrich Genscher remains the last ray of hope for the 
eastern liberals. The hero of Prague has already declared, 
however reluctantly, his readiness to once again do small time 
for his supporters throughout the new laender.

<F P=106> ["Ws."-attributed report: "Interior Ministers Agree on </F>
Observation of Republikaner"] 
  [Text] Potsdam, 8 May -- At their conference on the Island 
of Usedom, the interior ministers of the laender agreed that the 
Republikaner party be kept under intensive observation by the 
Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution [BfV] in 
the future. As Brandenburg Interior Minister Ziel (Social 
Democratic Party of Germany), chairman of the Permanent 
Conference of the Interior Ministers of the Laender, reported, 
the interior ministers have come to the conviction that the 
legal prerequisites for the observation of the Republikaner by 
the authorities for the protection of the constitution are 
given. So far, the BfV has kept the Republikaner under 
observation in only nine of the 16 laender. 
  At the same time, the interior ministers of the laender 
called on the Federal Government, in view of the dangers that 
might emanate from the possession of arms and explosives by 
extreme-right organizations, to see to it that the law on arms, 
the hunting law, and the explosives law are amended. In this 
way, right-wing extremists are to be prevented from getting 
arms. According to Ziel's report, the laender also agree that 
marches and public propaganda of extreme-right groups have to be 
prevented by all legal means. The policemen of the laender 
cooperate here according to fixed principles. 
  The interior minister of the laender and the FRG interior 
minister were not able to agree on a stop to the deportation of 
Kurds, which had been demanded by Schleswig-Holstein. The 
interior ministers of the laender called on the FRG Government 
to ensure that permanent contacts for deported Kurds be 
appointed at the German Embassy in Ankara and the German 
consulates. It must always be possible to reach these officials 
to immediately follow up the suspicion of the state's 
encroachment on the rights of deported Kurds, if necessary. 
Moreover, the interior ministers of the laender are pressing 
the FRG Government to advocate a political solution of the 
problem of the Kurds in Turkey. Criminal proceedings against 
Kurds who have committed a punishable offense in Germany shall 
continue to be instituted in Germany first. In connection with 
the deportation of Kurds, Saxony Interior Minister Eggert (CDU) 
criticized the Foreign Ministry. He mentioned the case of a 
Kurdish family who had been deported to Turkey and had allegedly 
been tortured there. The Foreign Ministry did not check the 
reports on the torture quickly enough, he said. Schleswig- 
Holstein Interior Minister Bull talked of an increasing number 
of indications that human rights are violated in the southeast 
of Anatolia and Kurds are tortured. In this context, he 
criticized that the FRG Government had rescinded the stop of 
arms deliveries to Turkey. 
  At their conference, the interior minister of the laender 
emphatically appealed to the Federal Government to abandon its 
hesitant attitude regarding the formation of an East-West 
security council. In March last year, the interior ministers' 
special conference on "police cooperation with East Europe" had 
called for the establishment of such a council. At that time, 
it was also deplored that insufficient and lacking contracts are 
considerably impeding effective cross-border police work. 
According to Interior Minister Ziel, the interior ministers of 
the laender agree that, on the one hand, cross-border crime can 
be multilaterally tackled by an East-West security council and, 
on the other, bilateral agreements, such as agreements on legal 
assistance with the East European states are indispensable to 
stop cross-border crime. The agreement between Germany and 
Poland on the cooperation of the police authorities in border 
areas and the border police, which has come within one's reach, 
is a first step in this direction. However, it can only become 
effective in an overall package of measures against crime 
involving several countries. Therefore, the interior ministers 
of the laender urge the FRG interior minister to conclude 
skeleton agreements for police cooperation with the states 
bordering on the FRG as soon as possible. Priority is to be 
given to agreements with the states of Central and East Europe 
and Switzerland, it was stated.

<F P=106> [Article by Axel Vornbaeumen: "A Surfer in His Brown </F>
Element"] 
  [Text] Watch out, because something is happening in Germany 
once again. Or perhaps not? One remembers who should know. Or 
perhaps not? There is a witness of the time who has recognized 
historical parallels. Or not? So how was it then--let us take 
Point 4: "Books of Jews must be removed from bookstores." Or 
Point 13: "Goebbels denies Jews their human dignity. They are 
outlaws." Or Point 16: "Jews get out." 
  The man draws the connecting line from "then" to "today" 17 
times. Then, Point 18, the congruence: "Civil cowardice"--"Civil 
cowardice." 
  What is that? A comparison? Even that would be a perversion 
of history, far beyond the bounds of what can be tolerated. But 
it has become even more than that: an equation. 
  The dreadful barefoot historian is named Heinrich Hirzel. 
And 
his parallels look like this: Point 4: "Books of Republikaner 
authors are no longer published or are traded only under the 
counter." Point 13: "Friedmann, member of the central council of 
the Jews denies Republikaner their human dignity." Point 16: 
"Republikaner get out." 
  The presumptuous one-to-one of the tale of woe, printed in 
the April issue of the party newspaper DER REPUBLIKANER, is 
suitable at best as a piece in the completely open scale of 
interpretations: were things not nearly so bad in those days or 
are things again as bad today as they were then? To each his 
own, to be used deliberately. For Hirzel, in his own words a 
"marginal figure" of the Nazi resistance movement, "White Rose," 
and now a Europe candidate of the extreme rightist Republikaner, 
in any case, the comparability ends only "with the outbreak of 
World War II." 
  At the end of five columns, such subtleties will not bother 
the reader of the brown paper, imbued with substantial end-line 
mentality anyway according to the findings of opinion polls. 
There is finally someone with chutzpa: a German man, a German 
paper, a free country. So one will still be allowed to say.... 
  One is allowed..... In the latest report on constitutional 
protection presented last week by Federal Interior Minister 
Manfred Kanther, the actions of the Republikaner are summarized 
with astonishing forbearance. The compilation sees at best 
"clues" for extreme rightist aspirations of the party. Not a 
word about anti-Semitism. 
  At the same time, according to the leaked findings of the 
North Rhine-Westphalian Office for Constitutional Protection, 
there are model speeches for the super election year in the 
drawers of the Republikaner, with which the anti-Semitic 
potential latent in the German populace is to be activated in 
the voting booths. But that, according to the analysis of Rainer 
Erb from the Center for Anti-Semitism Research in Berlin, would 
indeed be a new quality in the political unculture. "Never in 
the history of the FRG has an election campaign been waged with 
anti-Semitism." 
  But the time has never been so favorable. Anti-Semitism in 
the German populace, says Erb, "has reached a level that will 
not melt away." And this is despite the fact that those who live 
in yesterday are dying out. For the Republikaner, it is again 
worthwhile to stir up the brown sediment. 
  Certainly, according to Erb's observations, the muffled 
anti-Semitism was "a constant element in the party." Ernst 
Galinksi and then Bubis--the pattern was always the same: the 
chairmen of the Central Council of the Jews, according to 
Schoenhuber's crude logic, are themselves to blame for the 
anti-Semitism in Germany. For him, he says, the "decisive 
question" is therefore this: "Is the excessive philo-Semitism 
not just as dangerous as anti-Semitism?" Schoenhuber's 
conclusion: "It is very good that that sometimes bursts forth in 
Germany." 
  It has burst forth. And the man in the pose of persecuted 
innocence has recently again been working on that with great 
determination. The latest "popular instigator" attack against 
Bubis, just days after a synagogue burned in Germany for the 
first time in half a century, fits the pattern. The 
Republikaner, dangling on the verge of insignificance in the 
media, are again "in." There is not a day of television without 
images of Schoenhuber, even though, as he laments, it is without 
the original tone. But that is delivered by his admirers via 
telephone. "Mr. Schoenhuber, you are a hero," is how his 
Republikaner friends commented on his suit against the chairman 
of the Central Council of the Jews. And in a "renowned inn" at 
Tegernsee in the deepest Bavarian territory of the CSU 
[Christian Social Union], the people greet the renegade "more 
than ever." Because of his broad success, Schoenhuber keeps on 
coming with new attacks: a denunciation against the writer Ralph 
Giordano "for public instigation to commit homicide." One must 
know the choice of words, the chief of the Republikaner visibly 
rejoices at Giordano's rhetorical faux pas: "If I, Franz 
Schoenhuber, were to say that Mr. Giordano must be done away 
with, then you ought to see what would happen in Germany." Nor 
is Schoenhuber letting up with respect to Bubis. He 
uncompromisingly called upon the chairman of the Central Council 
to apologize. 
  Is a person who has obviously found a concept for success 
just talking this way to serve the baser instincts of his 
clientele? 
  "I must understand the ordinary people if I want to make 
good 
policy," the relentless populist once said in an interview with 
the weekly newspaper DIE ZEIT. A little bit of sports palace in 
a beer tent and a few properly placed provocative words to 
transform the vague feeling in the stomachs of the horde of 
extreme rightist supporters into a political program? As hardly 
anyone else, Schoenhuber commands the polyphonous address." the 
transfer of racist and anti-Semitic messages to his supporters 
without having to be explicit," attests Siegfried Jaeger, 
professor at the Duisburg Institute for Language and Social 
Research. 
  Or is that also the way the man thinks, who in press 
interviews is quite able convincingly to mimic the polyglot 
liberal? 
  Behind closed doors, among his own people, the multicultural 
facade flakes off. The brown thoughts of the confessing SS-man 
("I was there") likewise waft through the room. Gysi? Bolshevik 
and Jew. Bubis? The Jew. The Germans? It is time for them to 
raise their heads again. The only thing that "we" can be 
reproached for, is the fact "that we have lost two world wars," 
someone said who recently noted Schoenhuber's droning in the 
back room about us once again being somebody. 
  Doubtless painful defeats for the top Republikaner. He would 
not like to have any more such feelings during the election 
evenings of this year. And enough of them are still ahead. 
  That is why he is now talking the way he has always thought. 
A surfer has found his element. Gregor Gysi, himself the address 
of anti-Semitic abusive letters, has registered the insidious 
change of climate in Germany. But he is one of the few who also 
names it: Schoenhuber. In a topical hour about the synagogue 
fire in Luebeck, the man from the PDS [Party for Democratic 
Socialism] says that Schoenhuber expresses his profound 
anti-Semitism, "because he is convinced that that will yield him 
more votes." And in view of the times, Peter Glotz, a 
rhetorically gifted unconventional thinker in the SPD [Social 
Democratic Party of Germany], advocates a long-overdue showdown 
with the "strong man and terrible populist from Upper Bavaria." 
Glotz has also recognized the reality that considering a 
13-percent share of the population with a closed world view one 
"cannot always sneak away." The sober realization is that 
Schoenhuber is relevant to the society. 
  The society is no different. Certainly the boss of the 
Republikaner was one of the first to recognize that. Schoenhuber 
had the "fascism of the old parties" compiled on two leaflets. 
There is a lot of stuffy tavern talk there from the past eight 
years. Ministers, state secretaries, and a Bundestag president 
are included there. The Christian Democrats predominate in the 
collection of quotes but the Social Democrats are also present 
with xenophobic and racist babbling. 
  Rejoice Germany. Franz Schoenhuber sets the leaflet aside 
and 
leans back satisfied in his Europe office. "The largest share of 
them would be subjected to a procedure to exclude them from our 
party." People buy that from him in these times. Still.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Gunter Hofmann: "Even the Center Is Tilting </F>
Right"] 
  [Text] Adolf Hitler was born on 20 April 1889. What had 
long been a nondate suddenly became a day with fatal symbolic 
force. And that is by no means just because the British have 
called off a national match against Germany that was supposed to 
take place on this day at the Berlin Olympic Stadium. 
  The fact that much has changed in the republic cannot be 
described merely through Solingen, Rostock, Moelln, or the 
firebombing of the synagogue in Luebeck. On the contrary, the 
suspicion remains that resentment against "foreigners," German 
national obsessions, and even anti-Semitism are becoming a part 
of our daily life. 
  When it was pointed out to the DFB [German Soccer 
Federation] 
in its collective naivety what is now linked with the date 20 
April, the gentlemen answered: all the better! The motive for 
such intransigence is obvious: to show the world that "we" have 
changed. In Olympic games in Berlin, therefore, the peoples of 
the world are supposed to confirm to us Germans the innocence 
that we have earned. 
  We are constantly craving, begging for, or extorting 
gestures 
of reconciliation. We would have been awfully glad to have 
evidence of normalization. That is what was involved in Bitburg 
and that is what is involved now when Chief of Staff Naumann 
definitely wants to provide the war graves in central and 
eastern Germany with the ranks of the fallen soldiers. First we 
want to be with the victors and then with the victims. We always 
want to be good and to have a confirmation of this. One would 
call this demand for absolution almost neurotic. 
  It is no shame that there will not be a confrontation in 
Berlin with the British players and their infamous fans. The 
cancellation came at just the right time. Everywhere in the 
republic, however, it sounds a lot like Berlin: Show firmness! 
Do not give in to the Right! No appeasement! But this suggests 
that the 20th of April brings to mind only a couple of wild 
militants. The problem attains its real dimension, however, in 
that the FRG is becoming insecure in its middle because we are 
losing a sense of what the basic consensus has been. Certainly 
1994 is not 1933, and why should it be? But one can also not 
forbid the question of how illiberal, how forgetful of history, 
and how national and rightist the republic is becoming. 
  But precisely that is what is being attempted today. It may 
be that all questions about what must be called "rightist" in 
Germany are being presented as the furor of a new political 
correctness that only obeys the old cliche, or it may be with 
the comment that the perpetual appeal to Auschwitz only serves 
to give us a good conscience and once again to teach the world 
what is what. 
  There are arguments and proofs for all objections of this 
kind. Still, they only distract from the essence of the problem. 
It is a matter of the center of society. There, in the middle, 
it is only tiny steps between the world of those who now vote 
for the CDU [Christian Democratic Union], FDP [Free Democratic 
Party], or SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] and that of 
the Republikaner. And the parties know that. They differentiate 
themselves from the Right but they also give sustenance to the 
rightists: appeasement did not begin with the decision to call 
off the national match on 20 April. The language that was used 
to deal with the right of asylum can be called appeasement. 
  Part of this is how politics accused itself or allowed 
itself 
to be accused of being oblivious to power for 40 years. It was a 
matter of appeasement when most politicians maintained silence 
in the dispute among historians in the mid-1980's. Will they 
once again say nothing when Arnulf Baring babbles about the 
return of Bismarck's empire in Central Europe? For years 
politics knuckled under and showed its cowardice. That alone is 
the shame and not the cancellation of a match on the "Fuehrer's 
birthday." The intellectuals have also taken part in such 
appeasement. No, Wolfgang Thierse, you did not keep silent too 
long, you participated too often. The historian Ernst Nolte, 
promoter of a past that ought to vanish, has gotten more and 
more space in the newspapers and found more resonance in 
people's minds. 
  Other thinkers or authors were also involved in this sense. 
One does not have to go along with Ignatz Bubis and name the 
dramatist Botho Strauss or some of the changed intellectual 
rightist radicals from 1968, but their effect on the children of 
the new rightists is obvious. They voluntarily put themselves in 
this context. Even Ernst Nolte is now getting support from the 
Left. After so many years of being taboo, the "rightists" are 
now becoming a secret fascination for many. And a rightist 
intellectual coalition is forming around young German historians 
like Rainer Zitelmann with their songs of impartiality on their 
lips. 
  It is too late simply to put all that back in the bottle. 
Certainly one can introduce the denial of the holocaust as a 
particular criminal offense, but that works two ways. The 
Auschwitz lie as a taboo and myth? It would be better if German 
justice had already been more consistent in prosecuting such 
"national instigation" with the means that it has. 
  The same thing is true for the question of whether the 
Republikaner should be banned. Even if the judges in Karlsruhe 
were to decide that, what would it yield other than a deceptive 
calm and some more legends of victims? And even the dispute 
about whether or not one ought to talk with the "radical 
rightists" is ultimately only a distraction. Naturally one would 
like to have television where Schoenhuber or Hader are not even 
invited. Still, one must try to talk with young people dressed 
as Nazis. But real selectivity is lacking. It must also be 
demonstrated in conversations with politicians, authors, and 
intellectuals of the "middle," who are just as radical as others 
when it comes to Maastricht, the "condolatory tourism," and the 
"pack of asylum-seekers." If the established consensus were not 
endangered there, then one would certainly not have to fear a 
seductive force from Leni Riefenstahl or Hoffmann's photos of 
Hitler. 
  Intellectuals supposed in 1990 that possibly the two 
half-nations were getting a chance for the first time to face 
their common past without false accusations and without 
repression of past actions. That is proving to be an illusion 
from today's point of view. Nevertheless, we face the first 
debate since unification about whether tearing down the wall and 
integration are only the motive for a national reordering of the 
entire discourse about the past, for a final writing of history, 
or for an honest definition of our place and republican 
vigilance in the best sense of the word. One would like to 
retain a bit of confidence against the prevailing longing for 
normalcy. And at the same time, one cannot let himself be 
dominated by the objection that all of that is the lyrics of 
bewilderment. Such optimism is based on the everlasting nature 
of the past itself. 
  "There is a wondrous healing power of nature but there is no 
healing power of history," writes Hans Mayer in this connection 
in his large book on the symbiosis of the Germans and Jews 
(Der Widerruf [The Disavowal]) that was finally 
destroyed on 30 January 1933. And further: "It is said: `Grass 
must grow over that.' Only the dead still lie under the grass."

have to take following the latest hashish ruling by the Federal 
Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe? 
  [Lintner] There are no implications for the legislature. 
The ruling just confirms the existing legal situation -- 
contrary to the impression that has generally been created. The 
right to ban hashish has been confirmed, and so has the right of 
separate treatment under the law of alcohol and nicotine on the 
one hand and illegal drugs on the other. The right to 
intoxication, which Mr. Nestovic demanded in his complaint, has 
been rejected by Karlsruhe. It is just that "occasional personal 
consumption," as defined by the Constitutional Court, will not 
usually be prosecuted or punished. This is already laid down in 
existing legislation. Sections of the public have created the 
impression that the court has allowed soft drugs. This is not 
the case at all. 
  [Wuchold] Will this affect the government's drug policy, 
which did not hitherto differentiate between hard and soft drugs? 
  [Lintner] The government's drug policy has been confirmed as 
well. The laender are the ones that will have to take measures. 
The Constitutional Court demands that they work out common 
guidelines for uniform jurisdiction in cases that involve small 
amounts of hashish for occasional personal consumption. 
  [Wuchold] Nicotine and alcohol cause 150,000 deaths each 
year. This figure makes the drug problem look almost harmless. 
  [Lintner] It is right that the alcohol problem is far 
greater in terms of dimensions. But, whether deaths are caused 
by alcohol or drugs, they are both catastrophes and should not 
be set off against each other. Calling for cholera if you 
already have the plague in the country would be a perverted 
logic. 
  The conclusion that we have to draw is to step up our 
efforts 
in terms of prevention with regard to all addictive substances. 
The Federal Government is doing this with its campaign "Making 
Children Strong." 
  [Wuchold] One of the arguments for allowing the use of drugs 
has been that this would deprive the drug mafia of its market. 
  [Lintner] These are very theoretical models that have not 
worked anywhere. Take the Netherlands: The assumption that a 
so-called liberalizing of hashish would separate the markets for 
soft and hard drugs did not prove right. Dealers wanting to 
sell hard drugs will always go where they hope to find 
customers. And potential customers are those who have already 
used drugs. The Federal Constitutional Court has also confirmed 
that hashish is a conditioning drug, since almost all the 
addicts to hard drugs have used hashish or marijuana. 
  [Wuchold] But could allowing soft drugs at least cut down on 
crimes related to obtaining drugs? 
  [Lintner] This is another field where expectations have not 
been met anywhere in the world. This has something to do with 
the fact that, say, a heroin addict is not able to work. 
Usually he cannot buy his drugs or support himself with a 
regular income. 
  [Wuchold] Has the narcotics problem in the new laender -- 
let me put it somewhat cynically -- already reached the western 
level? 
  [Lintner] No, thank goodness, it has not. We do not have a 
comparable drug scene in the new laender. But there might be a 
similar problem, although this will not happen as quickly as has 
been predicted.

<F P=106> [Report by Gerhard Hennemann: "The Federal Government Had </F>
To Pay DM7.5 Billion for Export Losses in 1993"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 6 May -- The risks that the Federal 
Government has taken with its export guarantees have again 
increased sharply. According to the Federal Finance Ministry, 
the highest ever compensation had to be paid in 1993, owing to 
payment problems of several debtor countries. The Federal 
Government had to spend approximately 7.5 billion German marks 
[DM] to cover Hermes [credit insurance company] guarantees -- 
twice as much as in the record year, 1992. The Finance Ministry 
states in its confidential 1993 annual report that these 
expenditures compare with receipts of no more than DM2.9 billion. 
  The report, which contains data on foreign and domestic 
trade 
and payments guarantees, illustrates that the serious financial 
situation will be further aggravated further for the Federal 
Government in the current year. An essential reason for this is 
the fact that the receipts from payments, the reflux of capital, 
and interest paid last year increased from DM1.1 billion (1992) 
to DM2.9 billion, which was attributable to unexpected high 
receipts from debt rescheduling agreements with Brazil and 
Russia. 
  In this connection, the experts in the Federal Finance 
Ministry say, however, that this relatively favorable trend 
regarding receipts will not repeat itself in the foreseeable 
future, and that another deterioration of the ratio of receipts 
and expenses must be expected. 
<H5>  Increasing Deficit </H5>
  The resultant deficit influencing the cash funds in the 
federal budget increased from DM1.95 billion in 1992 to 
approximately DM4.63 billion last year. If we only consider 
payments and the real reflux of capital (not including 
interest), the Federal Government's cash deficit even increased 
to DM5.7 billion. Of this amount, DM5.1 billion (DM2.3 billion 
in 1992) fell to Hermes, which, regarding liabilities, receipts, 
and expenses, constituted the largest share by far in foreign 
trade and payments guarantees. The deficit that has accumulated 
in this area since 1950 -- not including interest received and 
imputed interest paid -- reached the DM19-billion mark by the 
end of 1993. This accumulated loss from federal export 
guarantees currently compares with claims transferred to the 
Federal Government of DM27.2 billion in compensation payments to 
German exporters. 
  However, according to the Finance Ministry, the volume of 
these claims can hardly be assessed realistically regarding the 
expected reflux. Depending on the extent to which such claims 
are realizable and on the development of the loss potential 
contained in the Federal Government's overall liabilities, the 
Federal Finance Ministry says that the question must be answered 
of whether the Hermes guarantees will be adequate over the long 
term, or whether another increase in payments must be 
considered. In any case, it is clear that high expenses for 
debt rescheduling and payments for political damage must also be 
expected in the future. 
  Broken down by countries, the Federal Government's 
liabilities in 1993 clearly increased for Russia and China, 
whereas they declined in the case of Iran. Ranking at the top 
in 1993 of export deals guaranteed by Hermes in the past was the 
former USSR (with a volume of DM18.2 billion), followed by Iran 
with DM9.3 billion, and Brazil with DM8.9 billion. Ranking 
fourth, however, is the "new" Russia with approximately DM8.6 
billion, which is above all attributable to the high pledges to 
cover exports from the new federal laender. Following are Iraq 
with DM7.2 billion, South Africa with DM6.1 billion, and China, 
Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Indonesia each with approximately DM5.5 
billion. 
  In the category of untied financial credits guaranteed by 
Bonn, it is again the former USSR that ranks first 
(approximately DM7.4 billion), followed by Poland with less than 
DM2 billion and Hungary with DM1.6 billion. In the group of 
German capital investment abroad, the former CSSR ranks first 
with DM1.2 billion, followed by the People's Republic of China 
with DM876 million and Hungary with DM769 million. The former 
USSR plays a relatively insignificant role here, accounting for 
no more than DM48 million. Nonetheless, the sum of all three 
categories (export deals, untied financial credits, and capital 
investment) makes the former USSR account for the largest 
overall liabilities of approximately DM25.6 billion, followed by 
Brazil (DM9.6 billion), Iran (DM9.4 billion), and the new Russia 
(DM8.6 billion). 
<H5>  More Differentiated </H5>
  The Finance Ministry estimates the existing spending risk at 
approximately DM20.8 billion. While the credit standing of the 
successor states of the former USSR -- with the exception of the 
Baltic states -- has been assessed in the past as being more or 
less equal, Bonn is now increasingly taking different 
developments of the individual CIS republics into account and 
now defines the covering options for each country separately.

<F P=106> [Article by "kpk.": "KfW Bank for Reconstruction: </F>
Three-Quarters of Our Development Aid Is Successful"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt, 24 Apr--Development aid does involve 
mistakes and failures, but that is only a small part of reality; 
the actual success rate is much higher. At least that, once 
again, is the conclusion drawn by the Bank for Reconstruction 
(KfW) from the cases of development aid that it oversees. A good 
two years ago this state-owned bank, based in Frankfurt, 
presented its first profit and loss report. Now it has presented 
its second, to again verify "with facts" what "has actually been 
achieved" with the aid. 
  According to the report: 76 percent of the KfW projects are 
"successful in terms of development policy"; 24 percent are not. 
Sixty-seven percent of the financial aid is distributed among 
the successful projects, and 33 percent is spent on the 
unsuccessful projects. The rate of success is virtually the same 
as in the first evaluation report. At that time 74 percent of 
the projects examined were classified as successful. Around 
four-fifths of distributed funds were used on these projects. In 
this respect, the funds were used more effectively at that time. 
  All cases involve so-called financial development aid: used 
to finance projects in the Third World that are contracted by 
the Federal Government. For its report the bank evaluated 112 
projects. Bank sponsorship of all of these projects was 
completed in 1990 and 1991. Around 3 billion German marks [DM] 
were spent on these projects. The money came from the budget of 
the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation (BMZ). The 
geographic area of emphasis for the projects is Africa, and 
functional areas of emphasis include transportation, 
communications, electricity and water supply, and health care. 
The projects are evaluated both by employees of the KfW and by 
the economic evaluation firm, Treuarbeit (under contract by the 
ministry). 
  The bank would like the fact that 27 projects (24 percent) 
are unsuccessful to be seen in relative terms: The 
classification "unsuccessful" does not mean that the project has 
been completely useless for the developing countries involved. 
Fifteen projects definitely showed important advantages. These 
were not sufficient, however, to classify the project, measured 
in terms of the efficient use of funds, as successful. Six 
projects were considered "clearly insufficient" in terms of 
their developmental policy effectiveness, and only the remaining 
five were considered a "complete failure." 
  As an example of a project that is unsuccessful on the whole 
but is not completely useless, the bank mentions the expansion 
of a street in Malawi: The street is now passable even during 
the rainy season, it improves the sales prospects for 
agricultural products raised by small farmers from a rural 
district of the capital city, the transportation costs have 
dropped, and durable consumer goods from the capital city have 
become less expensive for the rural inhabitants of the African 
countryside. But the government's inadequate economic policy and 
the civil war have destroyed regional development, in contrast 
to assumptions made when the project was evaluated, and as a 
result the increase in traffic on the street has turned out to 
be less dramatic than was necessary for the minimum payment of 
interest on the funds employed. 
  One example of a total failure is the project of a 
lead-silver smelting works in Bolivia. It was intended to be 
used to smelt the ores, which up to that point had been 
exported, domestically, thereby bringing in additional foreign 
currency and creating jobs. But the ores were not sufficiently 
available and the prices on the world market for lead and silver 
dropped, so that the smelting works became uneconomical and it 
did not even start up production. Another failure was a planting 
of rubber trees in Indonesia. The ministry responsible was not 
conscientious enough; the trees were stricken with mycosis, thus 
their yield was low; and the small farmers lost interest. The 
project was broken off prematurely. 
  How are successes or failures measured? Evaluation standards 
include: Was the goal of the project (Example: drinking water 
for 20,000 people) achieved? Does the assisted investment earn 
the funds necessary to maintain it (catch phrase: operating 
efficiency)? Does it benefit the country's whole economy (Catch 
phrase: cost-benefit analysis)? Does the project improve the 
living conditions, above all, of the poorer groups of the 
population; does it fit in with a traditional life and a 
traditional mode of behavior? Could it possibly be harmful to 
human health or to the ecosystem (catch phrase: environmental 
effects)? Does it display sustained effectiveness; will it 
remain durable over the long term? 
  This evaluation covers only the benefits that the aid 
provides in developing countries; it does not account for 
benefits the financial aid might have for the German donor 
country (example: additional purchases in Germany). The message 
the bank is hoping to convey with its report is: Development aid 
is far better than its poor public image would suggest.

<F P=106> [Article by "Odr.": "Germany Must Invest More in </F>
Asia--Rexrodt Assures Political Support"] 
  [Text] Bangkok, 25 Apr--The position of the German economy 
in the Asia-Pacific region remains unsatisfactory in comparison 
with American and Japanese involvement. The Germans see Asia as 
predominantly an export market and thus are not present in 
sufficient numbers there through direct investments, cooperative 
agreements, and the exchange of technology and know-how. This 
must change. At least that was the opinion of the German firms, 
associations, chambers of industry and trade, and 
representatives of the Bonn ministries taking part in the fifth 
Asia-Pacific Conference of the German Economy, held in the Thai 
capital of Bangkok. The conference participants are hoping to 
jointly develop strategies for a successful German course of 
action in this region, with its great prospects for growth, and 
to spark interest in the region. 
  Due to its insufficient involvement up to now, the German 
economy is continuing to lose ground in East Asia, even more so 
than the United States and Japan. Deliveries and technology 
transfers from Germany currently make up only around one-tenth 
of the German foreign trade volume. No more than 3 to 4 percent 
of German foreign investments flow into the Asia-Pacific region. 
With an annual volume of German direct investments of 1.3 
billion German marks [DM] going to Hong Kong and DM2 billion to 
the ASEAN states, the Federal Republic is lagging far behind 
Japan. This is because Japan operates much more offensively in 
the region. In 1993, DM19 billion flowed from Japan to Hong Kong 
alone, and another DM52 billion to the ASEAN states. 
  For this reason the Federal Government has now granted Asian 
policy a position of importance. The government's Asia plan and 
the founding of the Asia-Pacific Committee of the German Economy 
are two important initiatives intended to heighten awareness in 
the political and economic arenas. Federal Minister of Economics 
Guenter Rexrodt, who opened the conference in Bangkok, promised 
German businesses increased political support. Rexrodt also came 
out in favor of a more intense dialogue between the Federal 
Government and governments in the Asia-Pacific region. Although 
the Federal Government is clearly opposed to direct export and 
investment subsidies, Rexrodt sees the German Hermes-instrument 
as providing an important contribution to the financial support 
of German direct investments. 
  As is heard in Bangkok, however, much remains to be done. 
"This somehow does not agree with German involvement in Asia. 
The exotic business-romanticism idea is finally history. 
Thousands of German firms have not yet become aware of this; 
only now is it becoming clear to them that Asia is no longer the 
backyard of the world," criticizes Fritz Kleinstaeuber, director 
of the German-Indonesian Chamber of Industry and Trade in 
Jakarta. Among the weak points he has identified in German-East 
Asian trade are, in addition to marketing weaknesses which have 
long been a problem, an unsatisfactory distribution system and, 
not least, ineffective advertising. Kleinstaeuber also 
challenges that the German presence in Asia should not be 
limited to machinery and capital assets. German consumer goods 
should also reappear in Asian markets. 
  "We see ourselves as partners in cooperation with the 
Asia-Pacific countries in a broad sense. What is needed is not 
so much exports from Europe to this region, but technology 
transfer and the expansion of local net product in the foreign 
markets," explains Heinrich von Pierer, chairman of the 
Asia-Pacific Committee of the German Economy. Von Pierer refers 
primarily to the great opportunity for German firms to become 
partners with Asian countries in gigantic infrastructure 
improvement projects and in environmental protection 
technologies. According to estimates, the volume of orders for 
infrastructure projects in this region will amount to several 
hundred billion dollars over the next few years. China, for 
example, plans to install around 75 million additional telephone 
connections by the year 2000.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Bernd Ziesemer: "Emotionally Charged"] </F>
  [Text] It is not difficult technical problems, but rather 
problems of political style that make Boris Yeltsin's official 
visit to Germany tomorrow [11 May] a tricky event for the 
Federal Government. The president will come to Bonn only two 
days after celebrating the anniversary of the end of World War 
II in Moscow. The Russian nation was even more emotionally 
charged on this year's "Victory Day" than it had been in 
previous years. 
  Even a sober Westernized paper such as IZVESTIYA at the 
weekend carried a headline reading "Eternal Thanks to You, 
Soldiers of Victory." On the front page of the paper, the 
well-known democratic writer and Yeltsin adviser Otto Lazis 
complained about the Germans' "stupid and dangerous" wish to 
move the official farewell ceremony for the Russian troops to 
Weimar. 
  Entirely unexpectedly for some, symbols are once again at 
the 
center of a fierce struggle in German-Russian relations. Thus, 
many Russians suddenly consider the return of German cultural 
assets that were taken away to the Soviet Union after World War 
II to be a national embarrassment. And even Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev takes every opportunity to emphasize Russia's 
role as a superpower: "We are not weak, and we do not have an 
inferiority complex." 
  Yeltsin seems to want to use his visit to Germany to 
emphasize this message very clearly. Symbolic concessions at 
the farewell ceremony for the last Russian soldiers will not be 
enough. Yeltsin's advisers want to use the Germans to put even 
more pressure on the other Western industrial nations. They 
want Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl to help bring about a 
special agreement with NATO and ultimately turn the G-7 Club of 
Western industrial nations into a G-8 with permanent Russian 
participation. Yeltsin's advisers could thus kill two birds 
with one stone: Russia's standing in the outside world would be 
improved, and the strong nationalist opposition appeased. 
  Following the dispute over a joint East-West strategy in 
former Yugoslavia, Moscow has decided on a negative attitude 
toward NATO's Partnership for Peace program. In the view of 
Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, Russia's superpower interests 
call for different forms of cooperation with the Western 
alliance. 
  The only problem for Yeltsin: Russia's superpower airs and 
its continual requests for more financial aid from the West 
hardly go together. For the visit to Germany, the ministries in 
charge have once again put together a long list of new and old 
demands: further concessions on refinancing, more favorable 
conditions for Hermes loans, and more direct investment from 
Germany. 
  A Foreign Trade Ministry official in Moscow said, 
surprisingly openly, that Yeltsin's talks will have to help make 
Bonn continue to play its role as the most important Western 
financier. Many economic experts in Moscow seem to be worried 
that German aid sources might suddenly dry up after the troops 
withdraw in August.

  [Text] Paris, May 10 (AFP) -- French Foreign Minister Alain 
Juppe ruled out Tuesday [10 May] the use of military force to 
free 11 French aid workers held since last month by Bosnian 
Serbs for allegedly smuggling arms to the Bosnian Government. 
  Juppe, speaking on French radio, said such an intervention 
would involve too many risks and added that the diplomatic 
channel would bear better results. 
  He warned, however, that the safety of the 11 detainees from 
the Premiere Urgence (First Emergency) humanitarian organisation 
was the responsibility of authorities in the rump-Yugoslavia and 
Bosnian Serbs. 
  "We are not negotiating," he said. "We demand their 
unconditional release. The Serbs must realize that if they 
persevere with their defiant attitude toward the international 
community, they will pay the price." 
  The French aid workers have been held since April 8 at 
Lukavica, a suburb of Sarajevo, on charges that they were 
smuggling arms to the mostly Moslem Bosnian Army. The Serbs say 
they intend to try the 11, who face up to 15 years in prison. 
  Premiere Urgence has denied the arms smuggling charges and 
says weapons allegedly found at a Serb checkpoint in one of the 
organization's trucks had been planted there by the Serbs 
themselves.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bernard Tapie, Left Radical Movement leader, </F>
by Philippe Reinhard; place and date not given: "Tapie Is 
Self-Confident: `My List Is Going To Be a Success'" -- first 
three paragraphs are LE QUOTIDIEN DE PARIS introduction] 
  [Excerpts] Bernard Tapie will be a major troublemaker 
within the Left. Doubters need only read the following 
interview to be convinced. Looking for all the world like he 
could not care less about the scandals he has been plagued with, 
he rises gamely to the fight. This man plays a mean poker game; 
blessed with psychological insight and unafraid to resort to 
bluff, he goes for high stakes. Should he win the game (10 
percent or more in the European election), nobody will be able 
to ignore him. Especially nobody within the Left, as success 
for him would dash [Socialist Party, PS, First Secretary] Michel 
Rocard's hopes [of being appointed the party's presidential 
candidate]. 
  While President Francois Mitterrand and his entourage 
maintain they have had no hand in the Tapie phenomenon, it is 
crystal clear that, over the past few years, Mr. Mitterrand has 
used Mr. Tapie as a wild card. Has the president developed a 
fascination for the self-made, sligthly loutish billionaire, or 
does he merely view him as a pawn in his anti-Rocard strategy? 
Either way, the president has backed Bernard Tapie too often 
for his denials to sound genuine. Therefore there is no need to 
give a detailed account of the improbable and grotesque session 
in which he supposedly chided his aides for squandering their 
benevolent attention on Mr. Tapie. The truth is simpler. The 
Tapie move has already been successful beyond the president's 
wildest dreams. So continued overt support to Bernard Tapie 
might damage the PS' party presidential image. This would not be 
the best way to go about imposing on this party another 
candidate than Michel Rocard. Mr. Mitterrand must change tack 
somewhat, but nobody is likely to be fooled. 
  Should Bernard Tapie's list "be a success," as he himself 
puts it, one can foresee major disruptions on the French 
political scene. As the new leader of the MRG [Left Radicals 
Movement], he has adopted a resolutely left-wing stance. For the 
time being, that is. He has already warned that his next battle 
will entail an attempt at breaking the "binary" rhythm which has 
traditionally dominated French politics. This means -- although 
he denies it -- that he might model his conduct after Silvio 
Berlusconi's. In any case, one thing is now certain: The 
political class will not get rid of Mr. Tapie by merely calling 
him supposedly ignominious names such as "populist" or 
"demagogue." Mr. Rocard may become his first victim, but 
everybody else has now good reasons to worry. [passage omitted] 
  [Reinhard] You head a list for the European election. Do 
you have a plan for Europe that distinguishes your list from the 
others? 
  [Tapie] I am positively certain that Europe can only work if 
we build a federal Europe. 
  [Reinhard] This is not exactly the most popular position 
these days. 
  [Tapie] Actually, it is the most unpopular there is. Which 
goes to show once more that I am rather less of a populist than 
all the others, including those "Europeans at heart" who want to 
build Europe, albeit not this one because their first concern is 
to tell the public what they think it wants to hear. Quite 
frankly, I think that is disgusting. 
  [Reinhard] This is supposed to be the position of Dominique 
Baudis [who heads the majority's list]; why are you making his 
territory your own? 
  [Tapie] Because I believe in a federal Europe and I am not 
afraid of saying so. Baudis does not have the guts to do it 
because that is unpopular. [passage omitted] 
  [Reinhard] Your list is mostly disruptive for the Left. Why 
are you fighting the people who took you to the top? 
  [Tapie] These people never respected me. They used me. 
  [Reinhard] What will happen if Rocard suffers a severe 
setback in the 12 June election? 
  [Tapie] Can one change everything without changing anything? 
Are we one day to acknowledge at last the fact that we cannot 
change anything without shuffling things and people around a bit? 
  If Rocard succeeds, it will mean his presidential potential 
is good. Will that be enough to beat the Right? This is a 
question that is rather more pressing for the Right than for the 
Left. If they keep up their internal bickering, everything is 
possible. 
  [Reinhard] But what if Rocard fails? 
  [Tapie] If Rocard fails, not only the Left will suffer. 
There will be a general redistribution of all political cards. 
French politics has traditionally been an unavoidable binary 
system which had nothing to do with the aspirations and opinions 
of the electorate, nor with what has been going on elsewhere in 
the world. Thanks to the European election, this nonsense has 
now been exposed for what it is. For example, the Rocard list 
has much more in common with the Baudis list than the latter has 
with that of De Villiers [leader of the anti-Maastricht list], 
or Rocard's has with that of [former Socialist Defense Minister 
Jean-Pierre] Chevenement. 
  [Reinhard] However, the presidential election will take 
place in a year, and the Left needs a champion. So if Rocard is 
not it, who else? 
  [Tapie] If Rocard fails, this does not mean that the Left 
will collapse. It will redefine itself around someone else. 
  [Reinhard] Someone from the Socialist Party? 
  [Tapie] We shall see. If Rocard fails, there might not be 
anybody else that is able to win. However, there is no shortage 
of men on the Left. There are Delors, Lang, and Kouchner. And 
why not Badinter, or a newcomer. 
  [Reinhard] You said recently that you did not feel ready for 
the part. Are you betting on becoming the game's referee, short 
of being the Left's candidate? 
  [Tapie] Of course I am. This is why they do not want me to 
obtain a good score. I wish I could be there when they pick 
their man, so as to be sure that those who are with me are well 
represented. 
  [Reinhard] What is your measure of Rocard's hostility toward 
you? 
  [Tapie] Rocard refuses to have a debate on television with 
me. And yet, left-leaning French people would certainly like to 
know exactly where the Left stands today. They want to 
understand the difference between Radicalism and Socialism. 
  [Reinhard] And what is the difference? 
  [Tapie] There are those who think that solving the 
unemployment problem is a matter of working only four days a 
week for four days' worth of pay, and those who, like myself, 
believe that we need to work more than we used to. I think that 
we need to work six days a week, not five, because the only way 
to create wealth is to work harder. Rocard thinks the solution 
is working less rather than working more. There is a difference 
here, and people have a right to understand why. 
  [Reinhard] Rocard will not debate with you, and that is fair 
enough. Is this the only thing you hold against him? 
  [Tapie] There is also the anti-Tapie lobbying campaign that 
Rocard's buddies have been conducting. This lobbying of the 
editors of LE MONDE, LIBERATION, LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR, or LE 
POINT is being led by lawyer Tony Dreyfus. And that is 
intolerable. It is ineffective and intolerable. It is such an 
irritant that I might lose my temper during the last days of the 
campaign. 
  [Reinhard] Some commentators believe that the president has 
helped you recruit people for your list. A case in point is 
Catherine Lalumiere, whom he reportedly encouraged to join. 
  [Tapie] First of all, my list is a good list. And we did 
not need anybody's help to put it together. As far as Catherine 
Lalumiere [former Council of Europe Secretary General] is 
concerned, she did not ask the president's assent, and had she 
done so, she would not have got it. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Paris, May 9 (AFP) -- French voters are almost 
evenly divided on whether President Francois Mitterrand's 
13-year reign should be seen in a positive or negative light, a 
SOFRES [French Opinion Polling Company] poll published Monday [9 
May] showed. 
  Of 1,000 people questioned, 46 percent were critical of the 
president's performance since he took power in May 1981, but 43 
percent were favourable, according to the poll, conducted for a 
group of regional newspapers. 
  Eleven percent were undecided. The survey was carried out 
between April 26 and 28. 
  A year ago, after parliamentary elections which saw 
Mitterrand's Socialist Party turfed out of power, his approval 
rate was a mere 37 percent, with 54 percent against him. 
  Those questioned give the president credit for his role in 
areas such as the position of France in the world where he won 
59 percent backing, promoting European Union (55 percent), 
ensuring social peace (53 percent) and guaranteeing national 
defence (52 percent). 
  But Mitterrand received poor ratings on unemployment with 88 
percent critical of his policies, immigration (70 percent), 
public security (62 percent) and reducing inequalities (61 
percent). 
  The president's second term of office ends next May.

<F P=106> [Article by Jean-Pierre Sereni: "The Treasury: A Fortress </F>
Threatened"] 
  [Text] France's preeminent institution has been sullied by 
the Credit Lyonnais scandal, one more setback at a time when its 
power is inexorably crumbling. The Matignon [office of the prime 
minister] now wants to split it into three parts. 
  Is the Treasury to be the scapegoat for the Credit Lyonnais 
scandal? The French Government's most prestigious--and long most 
powerful--directorate has been called on the carpet at the worst 
possible moment. The country's leading bank was on its way to 
the wall and the Treasury Directorate, which both oversees it 
and represents the shareholder government on the board of 
directors, either knew or said nothing. That is, unless--and at 
no risk to himself--the then minister sat on detailed warnings, 
an indication of what little real influence this much vaunted 
power machine enjoys. 
  Actually, until the summer of 1992, the "memo for the 
minister" concerning the Credit Lyonnais were as rare as they 
were vague. Much was made of Jean-Yves Haberer's bold strategy, 
the great risks taken, the wager that could win big. "The 
Treasury is organized like a loose holding company," one 
official says, springing to its defense. "It is concerned with 
strategy, but its supervision depends on external systems, 
auditors, the Banking Commission, headed by the governor of the 
Bank of France, acting as its secretariat, followed by the 
General Inspectorship of the aforementioned Bank of France." 
  The year 1991 was a decisive one. Credit Lyonnais was still 
posting good profits (3.2 billion francs [Fr] in the black), 
surpassing those of the BNP [National Bank of Paris]. Questions 
were beginning to emerge here and there, however, even before 
the gloom-and-doom predictions from Francois d'Aubert, UDF 
[French Democratic Union] deputy from Mayenne, ENA [National 
School of Administration] graduate, and adviser to the Audit 
Office, who in late 1980 embarked upon a continuing crusade 
against the Credit Lyonnais that was met with widespread 
indifference. 
  "The Banking Commission and Treasury were somewhat timid," a 
former member of Pierre Beregovoy's cabinet now admits. Bank of 
France Governor Jacques de Larosiere, Haberer's predecessor as 
head of the Treasury, did not get along with the boss of the 
Credit Lyonnais, which detracted from the Banking Commission's 
warnings. As for the Treasury, it is far more stringent with 
poor people in need of money than it is with government finance 
barons. Nor is it easy for a bureau chief to tweak a former 
great who served as Treasury director 10 years previously. 
  By the summer of 1992, no doubters were left. Earnings for 
the first half of the year were catastrophic. When the bank was 
placed under close monitoring--and Treasury insiders now say it 
"was high time"--the task was given to Haberer, who did not 
conceal his anger. "What kind of daily control can be effective 
enough to allow the minister to be warned in time?" the then 
Economics and Finance Minister Michel Sapin now wonders. Until 
the arrival of Jean-Pascal Beaufret at the head of the 
Department of Monetary and Financial Affairs in the summer of 
1992, the Treasury's representative on the Credit Lyonnais board 
of directors was not the official in charge of the matter, which 
certainly did not facilitate the monitoring task. 
  Beginning in December 1993, the recapitalization of the 
Lyonnais, negotiated by its new president, Jean Peyrelevade, set 
the stage for one more setback for the Treasury and its 
minister. Beaufret intended to reduce the government's backing 
to a minimum, forcing the bank to draw upon its reserves (Fr60 
billion francs in shares, the best backed network in Europe). 
The Matignon went to bat for the Lyonnais: The government, 
Thomson SA, and the Deposit Fund would dole out funds. The 
concern for not weakening the French economy as it emerged with 
difficulty from the crisis won out over the traditional impulses 
of the Treasury, ever anxious to limit government commitments. 
  A parliamentary commission of inquiry is to scrutinize the 
Lyonnais matter. Selection of its members--a minimum of 
nine--and definition of its task is providing fuel for a fierce 
behind-the-scenes fight. The spokesman for the National 
Assembly's Finance Committee, Philippe Auberger, a former Bercy 
[Finance Ministry] official from the RPR [Rally for the 
Republic], wants to challenge certain colleagues, who "failed to 
execute their duties properly...and submitted accounts for a 
number of years which were in error." 
  Centrist Jacques Barrot, chairman of the Finance Committee, 
wants no witch hunt and is trying to "understand where things 
went wrong between the oversight authorities and nationalized 
businesses." In other words, he prefers to aim the spotlight at 
the Treasury rather than the Credit Lyonnais, whose customers, 
partners, and deposits must be handled with kid gloves. 
  Overnight, the Lyonnais affair and its parliamentary 
aftereffects could speed up reform at Bercy, one of Edouard 
Balladur's main secret plans. 
  Since the fall, 40 high-level Matignon officials have been 
working under Jean Picq, adviser to the Audit Office and former 
member of various Gaullist cabinets, to define "the government's 
responsibilities and organization." The inquiries, hearings, and 
studies have spared no sector, from Education to Economy. One of 
the main points of the general 150-page report to be submitted 
to the prime minister on 30 April deals with a redistribution of 
power between the Matignon and Bercy. 
  Balladur, economics and and finance minister from 1986 to 
1988, had the next five years--working from within the 
opposition--to reflect on the redistribution of real power 
between the government's two fortresses. 
  As prime minister, he worked hard to accentuate the split 
between Finance and Budget ministries authored by Pierre 
Beregovoy in April 1992. It was no accident that the three most 
influential finance ministers of the Fifth Republic: Valery 
Giscard d'Estaing, Pierre Beregovoy, and Edouard Balladur, each 
tried to blow up the citadel once they were out of the ministry. 
<H5>  Recommended Solution: One Grand Ministry of National </H5>
Economy, Patterned After the German Model 
  Of the three, Balladur went the farthest. His was the first 
government since the end of the Napoleonic wars to have no 
minister of finance. Edmond Alphandery is only economics 
minister. The preeminence tacitly recognized at that ministry 
and by its top officials in the Treasury is now carefully 
blurred. What is more, it is under attack from a Budget Ministry 
that has been stimulated the influence of its young head, 
Nicolas Sarkozy, who is also the government's spokesman and, in 
fact, its number-two man. "What can you expect? The mayor of 
Neuilly [Sarkozy] is more important than the mayor of 
Longue-Jumelles [Alphandery]," one Bercy boss says with a sigh. 
  It is a well-designed arrangement, one that has heretofore 
done all that its authors had hoped it would: Economic and 
financial arbitration takes place at the Matignon rather than at 
Bercy, which had been rapped on the knuckles for the Balladur 
loan--which the Treasury did not want--as well as for the 
abortive reform of the Deposit Fund. 
  Interministerial debate behind closed doors, settled by the 
finance minister, has given way to interministerial meetings 
dominated by the Matignon. The power to say "yes" has shifted 
from the 12th district to the seventh. Unlike Michel Rocard or 
Edith Cresson, the prime minister no longer has before him 
packages neatly tied together at Bercy that he must either 
accept as they are or reject, risking a political or monetary 
crisis. 
  "Today, the Matignon intervenes in matters involving Fr50 
million," observes one veteran of the "golden age" of the 
Beregovoy-Trichet team, one a powerful minister and the other a 
flashy Treasury director. 
  The last example to date of the recurring conflicts 
separating the feuding brothers at Bercy is the struggle over 
the pension fund and the income tax reduction. Alphandery 
defends the former and Nicolas Sarkozy the latter. Both would 
mean substantial losses in fiscal revenue and in slack times it 
is not possible to do both. The decision will therefore be made 
at the Matignon. 
  Based on early leaks, the Picq mission is tending toward a 
German-type model: one grand Economics Ministry combining the 
current responsibilities of [Economics Minister Edmond] 
Alphandery and [Industry Minister] Gerard Longuet. 
  Such a rapprochement between Bercy and Avenue de Segur 
[Industry Ministry] would be accompanied by a reorganization of 
both administrations. Part of the Treasury administration, the 
one that handles monetary and financial affairs and government 
participation, would be merged with the General Industrial 
Strategies Directorate (DGSI), which now monitors the 
manufacturing sector. 
  The other part of the Treasury, international affairs, would 
be grouped together with the Directorate of Foreign Economic 
Relations (DREE), placing under the same ministerial and 
administrative authority all foreign trade questions, foreign 
loans, credit insurance, debt and development. "In the future, 
with the creation of the World Trade Organization scheduled to 
succeed GATT on 1 January 1995, matters relating to 
international trade, foreign exchange, and global debt will be 
inextricably combined. A single command unit is essential if 
France wants to avoid the 1992-93 mess it had with the Uruguay 
Round," one manufacturer argues. 
  Based on such a scenario, a Finance Ministry would remain at 
Bercy, built around the Budget Directorate and the Tax 
Directorate, along with an office in charge of financing 
government deficits. 
  From the perspective of Pavillon Colbert, located at Bercy's 
sixth pillar, headquarters of the Treasury Directorate, the plan 
amounts to sacrilege. If reform there must be, there can be no 
question of taking away Finance or of separating Budget, taxes, 
and the Treasury. 
  "Right now, in spite of everything, we are trying to achieve 
the successful separation of persons, ie., the existence of two 
ministers, with the needs of a harmonious operation, but if that 
were to become a real, permanent, final split, it would be a 
very bad thing," says one of the Bercy barons, resolutely 
arguing for the unity of the financial leadership of the 
government. Furthermore, what would be the purpose of the 
"little schemes" invented to safeguard the unity of the 
institution, the common notes sent by the Budget Directorate and 
Treasury Directorate to the two ministers? 
  And yet, the young mining engineer entrusted by the Picq 
mission with the task of inventorying the responsibilities of 
the Treasury Directorate has been forced to note the undeniable 
and rapid shrinkage of its prerogatives in recent years. 
  As for the monetary mission, since February all action has 
shifted to the Bank of France. The Council on Monetary Policy 
establishes short-term interest rates, oversees rates day by 
day, and buys and sells foreign exchange for the government with 
complete freedom. The last straw: The Treasury director is 
barred from meetings if the minister is present! 
  As for the mission of overseeing the banks, the Treasury 
continues to share it with the Bank of France, which acts as the 
general secretariat for the Banking Commission. Its independence 
has buttressed the preponderance accorded it by its expertise: 
Investigation of cases is done on Rue de La Vrilliere. "The Bank 
of France is the only independent central bank to enjoy the 
right of oversight over commercial banks," complains one former 
head of the A1 office, long one of the most prestigious 
directorates. "That throws everything off balance," he adds. 
  Nor is supervision of financial markets what it once was! 
The 
Stock Exchange Operations Commission (COB), which bears that 
responsibility, has strengthened its position in recent years. 
The law of 2 August 1989 drove out the government's 
commissioner, the Treasury's oversight agent. Its budget no 
longer depends on Bercy. A representative of the directorate may 
participate in its work, but on the condition that he be asked 
to do so and that he remain silent. A sign of the times, on 8 
February 1993, the COB suspended the quotation of the 
Businessman's Accounting Office, a specialized financial 
institution under the Treasury, without even notifying the 
latter. 
  Privatization is one of Treasury's few new missions, but a 
naturally temporary one at that. Unlike under the first 
cohabitation, it must now share the task with the Privatization 
Commission. In addition to appraising the value of privatized 
companies the latter will henceforth choose the members of the 
"hard-core investors" itself. 
  Once the privatization program has been completed, the 
number 
of board seats occupied by Treasury officials will have 
dwindled. In 1992, a third of the personnel in the financial 
sector (banking and insurance) came under the government 
shareholder and therefore under the Treasury. Treasury board 
seats will comprise scarcely 5 percent in 1997 when the 
privatization process has been completed and will essentially be 
under the independent Bank of France. 
<H5>  Decline of the G7 Regime; Paris Club Weakens Treasury's </H5>
International Role 
  The Department of International Affairs, the most highly 
esteemed of the three in the Treasury's unwritten hierarchy and 
the source of two of the four last Treasury directors, has run 
out of things to do. The G-7, a body which brings the seven 
chiefs of state or heads of government from the seven richest 
countries in the world together with their respective Treasury 
directors, and which, according to Jean-Claude Trichet, 
comprised "the World Directorate," is on stand-by. It may well 
discuss employment, the environment, or Bosnia, but never 
interest rates or exchange policy! "Monetary coordination 
between great powers that led to the Plaza agreement and later 
the Louvre agreement in 1986-87 flowed from one man, U.S. 
Treasury Secretary Jim Baker. Since his departure, nothing 
important happens there," one old Sherpa says. 
  The Department's other leading institution, the Club of 
Paris, whose members since 1956 have been the world's main 
creditor nations, experienced a spectacular run in the 1980's 
with the Third World debt. International investors have now 
returned alone to the road of exotic or emerging markets ($40 
billion in 1992). Only subscribers now go to the Club and they 
are often small, bankrupt countries sliding into the Fourth 
World amidst an attitude of general indifference. The only 
important matter on the horizon concerns Russia, once the 
International Monetary Fund has uttered its final word. 
  Europe, which is inexorably nibbling away at national 
prerogatives and which could have been a new frontier for the 
entire Treasury, has taken on the look of an opportunity missed. 
Trichet did indeed negotiate Economic and Monetary Union in 
1991, but nothing has happened since. One office out of 25 
follows European affairs and two more are interested in it as a 
sideline. 
  Actually, that issue has already been taken over by the 
General Secretariat for International Cooperation (SGCI), which 
is under the Matignon. Made up of 140 persons, some 100 of whom 
are A-ranking officials, it is, like the Treasury, "a miniature 
France," housed in a discreet building on Boulevard Diderot 
devoid of any plaque or flag. Operating between Brussels and 
Paris, the SGCI plans European Council of Minister meetings and 
referees interministerial disputes. For example, ever since 
Bercy was split in two, the SGCI has served as an arbiter 
between Budget and Economy when the ministers have to go to 
meetings of EC economics and finance ministers in Brussels. 
  It is a formidable rival for the Treasury and not only for 
European Affairs. Its boss, Yves-Thibault de Silguy, who is as 
blustering and extroverted as Christian Noyer is circumspect and 
sugar-coated, is Balladur's adviser for European affairs. At his 
prompting, the SGCI puts in overtime and provides the Matignon 
with memorandums on practically every subject, including 
financial, based on demand. 
  Maladept at seizing new responsibilities, outside of OPA's 
[public offer to purchase], from the venerable Insurance 
Directorate in 1989, the Treasury is in danger of losing its 
power of influence, the rare and fragile commodity that, more 
than regulations and procedures, was its real strength. This 
dynamic PME [small- and medium-sized business] with just over 50 
young managers: three department heads, nine deputy directors, 
24 bureau chiefs and their assistants, the rest having no voice, 
has been accustomed to winning interministerial arbitration much 
like one wins market shares, with a winner's attitude and the 
feeling--sometimes justified--of being the best. The departure 
of previous director Jean-Claude Trichet to the Bank of France 
in November was a stiff blow, a bit like a ranking general going 
over to the enemy. The three colonels themselves, all older than 
the new director, Christian Noyer, and who served on leftist 
Cabinet officials' staffs, are leaving. With respect to the 
Lyonnais, the four days which the minister took to reply to a 
low blow which a daily newspaper had aimed at a department chief 
were viewed as desertion. 
  Precisely what place does the "government's strategic master 
plan" being concocted at the Matignon reserve for the Treasury? 
"The organization of the Economics Ministry has scarcely changed 
since 1960, but there have nevertheless been gigantic upheavals 
since that time," observes Jean-Ludovic Silicani, general 
reporter for the Picq mission. 
  The most gigantic of all is undoubtedly the end of the 
economy of indebtedness and inflation, a revolution in which the 
Treasury, the sprinkler that got its own self wet, played a 
major part. Today, one no longer operates with loan 
authorizations and regulations, but rather, with tens of 
billions of francs of one's own funds and on open markets. 
<H5>  [Box, p 50] </H5>
<H5>  Failures and Blunders </H5>
  Even before the Credit Lyonnais imbroglio, a series of 
failures and blunders had already tarnished the aura of 
excellence traditionally surrounding the Treasury Directorate 
somewhat. 
  Inadequately overseen, in the midst of their 1980's 
euphoria, 
the Regional Development Companies (SDR), whose annual loans are 
backed by the government, confused infrastructural development 
with development of golf courses! Several SDR's could simply 
vanish! "A relic that was not controlled by the government or 
their shareholders," Treasury officials now admit. 
  Another setback: the Businessman's Accounting Office, more 
of 
a government agency than a bank and responsible for setting up 
property ownership loans (PAP). However, its board chairman 
blundered by becoming involved in real estate speculation. The 
result: a plan to salvage Fr15 billion to save accessways to the 
property of lower-income owners. In 1989, the Treasury completed 
an OPA on savings taxes, an area covered by the department of 
fiscal legislation and the Budget Ministry. The deduction in 
legal tender was reduced to 15 percent and the savings stash of 
the monetary SICAV's [Variable Capital Investment Companies] 
took wing. "From 1986 to 1989, the Treasury expanded tax relief 
without calculating the amount of revenue lost," one tax expert 
charges. The sum: Fr50 billion a year. 
  Following the German unification in 1990, the Department of 
International Affairs worried about the German economy because 
of the exchange rate chosen (1 West German mark, DM, to 1 GDR 
mark), but failed to foresee the tension induced on interest 
rates throughout Europe. In particular, no one apparently 
thought about the chance to marry the franc with a DM 
appreciated by the Bundesbank's expensive money policy. It is a 
fact that nothing moved in 1990 and that the escalation of 
interest rates took off in June 1991. Is the Maastricht monetary 
compromise itself not illusory? Germany has indeed accepted the 
single currency, but postponed it indefinitely!

<F P=106> [Report by Maurizio Ricci: "Prime Minister Berlusconi's </F>
`Reserve Plan'"] 
  [Excerpts] Rome -- A ceiling on taxation, equality between 
public and private education, revisions of the law on police 
informers, negative VAT [value-added tax] for people who create 
employment, and tax incentives for housing elderly relatives. 
On the European level, the federalist ideal of previous 
governments is disappearing and a more nationalist, "English" 
vision of the future of the European Union [EU] is emerging, to 
the extent of demanding a revision of the European Monetary 
System [EMS] and a common currency circulating in parallel with 
the national currency -- the "hard ECU" that John Major was 
proposing before Maastricht. These are just a few of the points 
in the government program that [Prime Minister-Designate] Silvio 
Berlusconi has illustrated over the last few days in the long 
process of consultations with allies, opponents, and social 
partners. The draft program is careful not to talk of outright 
first-past-the-post voting for electoral reform, and there is no 
indication of a separation of posts in the magistracy. It does, 
however, insist on tax relief and the rigid containment of the 
public debt with respect to national wealth. This is, 
therefore, one of the three basic conditions for government 
action in addition to the respect of the rights acquired in the 
social security reform and the protection of social solidarity, 
starting with the family. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Institutions </H5>
  It will be up to parliament, and possibly the electorate 
(through referendums) to enact constitutional reform. The 
government will, on the other hand, be able to propose specific 
outlines for constitutional laws, without ruling out the 
formation of a new, specific bicameral committee. Electoral 
reform will ultimately involve the replacement of the 
proportional system with a majority voting system, plus the 
abolition of the vestiges of the proportional system. At the 
same time, the rules governing both houses will be revised. 
<H5>  Employment </H5>
  "Full support" will be given, especially through interest 
rates, to small companies and the self-employed. In the first 
100 days, a series of concrete measures will be implemented: 
tax breaks for people creating new jobs, incentives for 
part-time workers (especially for women), the liberalization of 
the procedures for employment (even if outgoing Minister Giugni 
claims that such procedures for selection and direct employment 
by small companies are already practiced), the unblocking of 
public works contracts, and tax breaks for reinvested profit. 
<H5>  Public Finances </H5>
  There will be no property tax and no consolidation of debt. 
There will be a ceiling on withholding tax with exemptions for 
incomes of up to 10 million lire, a "drastic reduction" in 
personal income tax rates, and only two VAT rates. Where fiscal 
federalism is concerned, at the local level, taxes which finance 
services will be distributed locally, while at the national 
level will be those taxes which finance the basic tasks of the 
state. 
<H5>  Health </H5>
  The principle here is "the right to benefits" for the 
individual, and a "minimum level of coverage" for the less 
well-off. There will be room for private insurance and 
hospitals will be transformed into competing businesses. 
<H5>  Pensions </H5>
  There will be increased tax relief to lighten the pension 
fund (the "hole" for the Treasury will be covered by the income 
generated by investments in these same funds). Compulsory 
contributions to the public system will remain. This will 
finance the safeguarding of acquired benefits for the weakest. 
There will be a link with wages for the lowest 20 percent of 
pensions. 
<H5>  Education </H5>
  There will be freedom of choice between public and private 
education. This means that there will be rules "which allow 
access to private education under the same conditions as access 
to public education." College students will be able to apply 
for loans which they will have to pay back when they have found 
employment. 
<H5>  Justice </H5>
  "The laws on informants which have made it possible to 
identify major crimes will not be touched." There will be "just 
a few minor changes," partly on the basis of [outgoing Prime 
Minister] Ciampi's proposals, "to combine efficiency of 
suppression with the guarantee of a fair trial." For the CSM 
[Higher Council of the Magistracy], there is talk of a 
reorganization which "should enhance its efficiency and make it 
more independent of any possible type of pressure." 
<H5>  Family </H5>
  The tax system must be based on a family income tax, with 
new 
tax deductions. There will be tax breaks for those who assist 
their parents. 
<H5>  Immigration </H5>
  Migratory flows will be stabilized, but there will also be 
guarantees on housing, education, and equal access to work. 
<H5>  Public Administration </H5>
  The Cassese reform will continue, strengthening the 
distinction or separation between politics and civil service and 
eliminating automatic career advancement. 
<H5>  Environment </H5>
  There will be a tax on polluters and incentives for 
ecological investment. 
<H5>  Foreign Policy </H5>
  The watchword here is "continuity." However, there will be a 
"decisive containment of the EC Commission's interventionist 
tendencies," as well as a rethink of the EMS, "which has failed 
in objective terms in its Maastricht version. Anyone who 
believes in European integration will have to work hard to have 
an alternative strategy adopted, such as the strategy of a 
common currency."

<F P=106> [Fabio Barbieri report: "Roberto Maroni Considers Accord </F>
Victory for League But Speroni Skeptical, Still `Uncertain'"] 
  [Text] Milan -- "We are very pleased." This was the 
comment from Roberto Maroni, the Northern League's number two, 
who is certain to be the next deputy prime minister and very 
likely to be the next justice minister. "We are pleased," he 
added, "because we have achieved everything that we decided at 
Pontida [League rally venue] to demand. Our representation in 
the government team will be strong, concrete, and consistent 
with our fundamental pledges, namely, federalism and economic 
liberalism. Certain difficulties will still have to be 
overcome, but we are confident that the prime minister-designate 
will find the best solution among those that have been agreed. 
The government formation process is therefore almost over." 
  Francesco Speroni, leader of the League's Senate caucus, is 
of a very different, indeed the opposite, opinion. He said: 
"Nothing is clear any more. I think that everything is being 
called into question again. In that case, how can we know 
whether or not we are pleased? I can see the strangest things 
happening. I hope that there is not some kind of trick 
concealed behind them. It seems to me that the only real 
problem was the Interior Ministry: [Judge] Di Pietro's refusal 
calls the entire agreement into question. I cannot say whether, 
and, if so, when, the government will be formed. Berlusconi 
wanted to be the magician; now it is up to him to pull the 
rabbit out of the hat. So for the present I am adopting a 
wait-and-see stance and I can't hide my concerns." 
  Roberto Maroni was at his home in Varese, after a long night 
which ended with his go-ahead to Berlusconi. His remarks gave 
no hint of enthusiasm; they merely hinted at the realization 
that whatever needed to be done has been done. 
<H5>  Political Balance </H5>
  He added: "Our position can be judged in two ways: either 
as a sense of responsibility with regard to the country, or as 
some kind of surrender, an attitude of submission. Of course, I 
identify with the former assessment and I consider the latter 
totally short-sighted. I stress that, irrespective of the 
Interior Ministry, we can feel pleased." Maroni was reserved in 
his assessment of the government: "Berlusconi has to choose 
among several overlapping possibilities. It is like a jigsaw 
puzzle. Whichever of them is chosen, they all guarantee our 
position." Bossi's deputy rejected as groundless the assertion 
that the League will be "scaled down": "One Christian Democrat 
told me that our influence is less than that envisaged by the 
Cencelli manual [the rules of spoils system]. If he says so, it 
is doubtless true. But that pleases me: It shows indisputably 
that our rationale was the exact opposite of that of the parties 
of the old regime, and it confirms the correctness of what has 
always been our approach -- that is, to join the government in 
order to carry out a program clearly, not merely for the purpose 
of gaining power. We did not want any `business' ministries. 
We will not discuss the relative importance of individual 
ministries, those with or without a portfolio. Our commitment 
is a political one. The League wants institutional reform, it 
wants the birth of local government, it wants federalism. And 
it wants a system of economic liberalism that will put 
privatization at the top of the agenda." 
  Maroni said absolutely nothing about the division of the 
ministries among the parties and about the people that will be 
appointed to them: "Primary and secondary possibilities have 
been put forward. Names have been put forward, and we have 
pledged not to name them." 
<H5>  A Plain `No Comment' </H5>
  This reserve was not broken even by rumors such as those 
that 
emerged following Di Pietro's refusal, according to which 
magistrates Piercamillo Davigo or Francesco Di Maggio will be 
interior minister. There was a plain "no comment" with regard 
to the possibility of Lamberto Dini's becoming treasury 
minister. And what about the Justice Ministry? Maroni said: 
"I am flattered and pleased by the fact that my name has been 
mentioned in connection with this important position. I have 
stated my willingness: The final decision lies with the prime 
minister-designate." The League's second-in-command had few 
doubts about the time scale: "If Berlusconi works Sunday, too, 
the list of ministers could be ready as early as Monday 
afternoon [9 May], Tuesday at the latest. We are on vacation 
now. The prime minister-designate has all the means available 
to complete the process." 
  Then the list will be assessed by the alliance partners: 
"The choices," Maroni said, "will be made from among the 
approved options so there will be no surprises. Apart from the 
fact that the Constitution so requires, it is normal for the 
head of the government to have the last word, in other words, 
for him to choose -- from among those indicated and who have 
been approved -- the individuals with whom he believes he can 
work best, who have most affinity with him. I am very 
confident; the government will be formed." 
  So is there no anxiety about the rumors that Berlusconi 
intends to postpone the presentation of his cabinet by a few 
days? "I repeat," Maroni concluded, "that the prime 
minister-designate has all he needs in order to form the 
government, and if he postpones it by a few days, it means that 
he is taking a little time to reach the best solution."

<F P=106> [Report on informal news conference by Prime </F>
Minister-Designate Silvio Berlusconi by Alberto Mazzuca with 
unidentified reporters in Milan; date not given: "Tonino Head 
of the 007's?"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] When someone asks the prime 
minister-designate: "What about [Judge Antonio] Di Pietro as 
chief of police?," Berlusconi shakes his head. In charge of the 
intelligence service, then? This time Berlusconi concurs: He 
likes the idea, in fact he likes it a lot. But he adds nothing 
further and continues posing for the photographer, rapping the 
candidates who appear in front of the television cameras with 
their jackets unbuttoned over the knuckles. 
  [LA VOCE] Excuse me, Mr. Berlusconi, but you must at least 
have a list of names for the Viminale [Interior Ministry] 
following Di Pietro's refusal? 
  [Berlusconi] What list are you talking about? Difficulties 
are all I can see. 
  [LA VOCE] So the Viminale still constitutes a great hurdle. 
  [Berlusconi] There are no hurdles. Or, if you like, 
everything is a hurdle here, because nothing is ever easy. 
Anyway, the problem for the Viminale is who goes where and who 
goes somewhere else. 
  [LA VOCE] But have you already got this list of ministers 
ready? 
  [Berlusconi] Yes, but it all depends how the various pieces 
fall into place, so I do not know whether I shall be able to 
tell the head of state tomorrow that I can lift the withholding 
of the list. We are continuing with our work, but I am in no 
hurry. In any case, these are matters beyond my control; we 
must wait and see if the people to whom I shall extend 
particular invitations in the next few hours will accept them. 
We must be patient. Anyway, there are no deadlines. The 
timescale is laid down by the needs of the country and, for my 
part, the need to succeed. 
  [LA VOCE] But will all your allies feature in this list of 
ministers? 
  [Berlusconi] All the allies will be represented in the 
government. 
  [LA VOCE] Will Tremonti, who was voted in under Segni's 
Pact, 
be in it as well? 
  [Berlusconi] Only if he puts his past behind him and comes 
in 
as a technical minister. 
  [LA VOCE] If you do not go to Scalfaro with the list of 
ministers tomorrow, will you manage to stand by your undertaking 
to go before the Senate on Thursday? 
  [Berlusconi] I have my doubts. The schedule is a tight one, 
and I should also like to avoid the weekend break. 
  [LA VOCE] To get back to the Viminale, is it downhill all 
the 
way now or not? 
  [Berlusconi] What road is ever downhill all the way? A 
downhill stretch is always followed by a climb, and it has 
always been that way for me, right from the beginning. 
  [LA VOCE] And if you were to put Giuliano Urbani at the 
Viminale? 
  [Berlusconi] I have always stood by my undertaking not to 
name names, so I do not want to talk about names.

<F P=106> [Interview with Rocco Buttiglione, Italian Popular Party, </F>
PPI member, by Stefano De Martis in Rome; date not given: "We 
Will Join Forces With Berlusconi, But at the Next Election" -- 
first paragraph is L'INDIPENDENTE introduction] 
  [Text] Dear Mr. Berlusconi, at present we cannot but go 
into opposition. But let us meet at the next election to beat 
the Left together. From the Center. Signed: Rocco 
Buttiglione. In his third-floor office in Palazzo Cenci 
Bolognetti on Piazza del Gesu, the point of departure for the 
faxes addressed to the nascent "peoples' clubs," the philosopher 
deputy, who is running for the leadership of the PPI, has just 
had a visit from Giuseppe Gargani from the Irpinia area, which 
begs the first question. 
  [De Martis] What did you and De Mita have to say to one 
another at your recent meeting? 
  [Buttiglione] It is my wont to be discreet. 
  [De Martis] Very well, but why did you want to meet him? 
  [Buttiglione] Why should I not talk to De Mita? Because he 
has been involved in scandals? Not that I am aware of. Because 
he represents the old DC [Christian Democratic Party]? Yes, 
there is truth in that, but is the whole of the old DC to be 
consigned to the scrapheap? Or might there be a thread of 
historical continuity that can be picked up again in the 
transition to the PPI? I am sure there is, which is why I talk 
to De Mita, and other people too. The party is going through a 
very grave crisis. Its position and identity need to be 
fundamentally rethought in political and cultural terms. De 
Mita is a man who thinks. Unfortunately, we do not have many 
people who try to think politics out. 
  [De Martis] There is something paradoxical about it: You are 
talking to an "adversary" of yours, while your "ally," 
Formigoni, is distancing himself and running for the 
secretaryship on his own account. What is it that you disagree 
on? 
  [Buttiglione] As far as I am concerned, I can highlight a 
number of things that are close to my heart. I see the PPI as a 
boat running toward the rocks with its tiller nailed fast. Some 
of its officers claim that the rocks are merely an optical 
illusion and that the boat can get through unscathed. Others 
seek salvation by diving overboard or breaking off pieces of the 
boat to build rafts. What I want to do is get the nails out of 
the tiller. Of course, failing in this attempt would entail the 
risk of going down with the boat. It is a risk that I intend to 
run. The second thing is that the PPI makes sense if it manages 
to adopt policies with which a lot of Catholics, potentially all 
of them, and a lot of non-Catholics can identify. Great 
cultural unity must be matched by great forbearance. It must 
unite, not divide. The problems will not be solved by imagining 
that someone will get rid of someone else. 
  [De Martis] Buttiglione the unifier. 
  [Buttiglione] I have always worked toward unity. We of the 
PPI are at the Center. However, we cannot fail to bear in mind 
that part of our electorate has moved toward the Right. It has 
done so, not choosing a preexisting structure, but building up a 
new one: Forza Italia. We do not intend to run after them, but 
nor do we want to push them further toward the Right. What we 
must do is foster their return to the Center, acknowledging 
their positive tendencies and criticizing, but not demonizing, 
the negative ones. I should like to emphasize, however, that we 
are not merely postponing an agreement that will be inevitable 
at a later stage. If Forza Italia will not move to the Center, 
the deal will be off, both now and in the future. 
  [De Martis] In view of the current balance of power, is it 
not presumptuous to assume that the PPI can pull Berlusconi's 
movement over to the Center? The force of gravity is 
proportional to mass.. 
  [Buttiglione] Yes, but in politics, mass is not a constant 
value. First and foremost, a distinction must be drawn between 
electoral mass and parliamentary representation. The PPI and 
the Pact have only a few dozen deputies, but between them they 
collected 6 million votes: 2 million less than Forza Italia and 
more than National Alliance. A perverse electoral system and 
systematic propaganda persuaded the undecided moderate voters 
that a vote for the PPI would be wasted. This is the reason for 
our lack of success in the single-member constituencies. But if 
the PPI were to enter into a potentially successful coalition at 
the next election, our chances would be much greater, whereas 
those of the AN [National Alliance] would be greatly reduced. 
It would not be possible at the present time, which is why we 
shall remain in the opposition. But at the next election, a 
revitalized party that has at last put the bribery scandals well 
behind it and has a clear program stands a good chance of 
entering into an alliance with Forza Italia in a prominent, or 
at least not subordinate, position. 
  [De Martis] You call for a united effort within the PPI, 
but then you are organizing your "peoples' clubs." Is there not 
a risk that they might become a parallel party? 
  [Buttiglione] When the party has vitality, there is no risk 
because the clubs will support the PPI and work to recruit the 
people they meet. When the party is sclerotic, there will be, 
de facto, a single structure, so the problem will not arise. 
Let us say that the federation to which the clubs belong is 
very similar to how I would like the PPI to be organized: a 
lightweight, fast- moving structure firmly rooted in society. 
  [De Martis] The deadline for recruitment to the PPI has been 
set back to the end of the month. Will the conference scheduled 
for July take place or not? 
  [Buttiglione] A lot of people think that the party cannot 
wait until then, and they are proposing an interim solution to 
establish a program and settle the leadership issue; this would 
mean that the conference could be postponed until the fall and 
adequate preparation could be made for it. There is truth in 
this argument, provided it is not a means of prolonging a 
situation that is taking the party to its death. I should not 
like to think that this is what some people may be setting out 
to do, so that they can subsequently use the PPI acronym to 
legitimize the umpteenth quick-change act staged by the PCI 
[former Italian Communist Party]: Now that it has turned into 
the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left], it wants to acquire 
credentials as a new democratic party. 
  [De Martis] Nevertheless, you will find yourselves with the 
PDS on the opposition benches against Berlusconi. 
  [Buttiglione] Our opposition will be different, because our 
strategy will be different. The Left is setting out to beat the 
moderate alignment at the next general election. We set out to 
split up the present majority so as to form another, predominant 
majority that can defeat the Left at the polls from the Center, 
not from the Right. 
  [De Martis] And what about [AN leader] Fini? 
  [Buttiglione] Fini rightly saw that the myth of antifascist 
unity had come to an end. But antifascism, as the national form 
of antitotalitarianism, is more in vogue than ever. This is the 
hurdle that he has to clear if he wants to build up a Gaullist 
Right capable of becoming the right wing of the Center.

  [Excerpt] Soares opened the congress "Portugal -- What 
Future?," which is being held in FIL [Lisbon exhibition center] 
and ends on Tuesday [10 May]. The president spoke this morning 
and left a number of messages to those who want to listen. 
Without entering into an open conflict [with the government], 
Soares set the tone for the congress. He expressed his concern 
over the state of the Portuguese economy. 
  [Begin Soares recording] How will we live as a nation, when 
the Community funds come to an end or are considerably reduced? 
The crisis in agriculture and in the countryside, provoked 
mainly by the shortcomings in the sale of produce, is turning 
our fields into wasteland. I cannot accept such a situation. I 
believe it to be totally unacceptable and inappropriate, 
although I know we are paid not to produce. 
  No one today doubts that unfortunately we have returned to a 
situation of having wages in arrears and a drop in real wages -- 
a situation that I hope will be temporary -- that we continue to 
have child labor, that temporary contracts are now almost always 
the rule, that unemployment is threatening to continue to rise, 
that the banks are suffering many unpaid debts, and that many 
companies, large, medium, and small, are experiencing many 
difficulties under the specter of announced bankruptcies. How 
are we going to get out of this situation, this gloomy situation? 
  For 15 years there was talk of the negative consequences of 
nationalization on the Portuguese economy, arbitrarily carried 
out during the revolution by the Council of the Revolution. I 
hope that for the next few years we will not be speaking, with 
an equal sense of criticism, of the way in which privatization 
has been carried out. [end recording] 
  The president's words were applauded by an audience of 
distinguished members of the opposition. Education, 
environment, and Community funds were the areas the president 
criticized, aimed indirectly at Sao Bento [prime minister's 
residence]. [passage omitted]

  [Text] According to sources at the Moncloa Palace, Spanish 
Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez has decided to postpone his 
official visit to Paraguay, due to take place at the beginning 
of next week. 
  Felipe Gonzalez's trip to Paraguay was scheduled for 16-18 
May. Ten days ago Gonzalez also postponed his trip to Romania 
and Bulgaria, due to take place last week, because of the 
political crisis unleashed by the flight of Luis Roldan, the 
former head of the Civil Guard, and by the fact that the former 
governor of the Bank of Spain and Manuel De La Concha, former 
head of the Madrid stock market, were sent to jail, as well as 
by the resignations of Interior and Agriculture Ministers Antoni 
Asuncion and Vicente Albero.

<F P=106> [Article by Bo Jeppesen: "Liberals and Conservatives Split </F>
on Fund Investments"] 
  [Excerpts] There appears to be broad majority support in 
the Folketing for allowing more investments from the Labor 
Market Supplementary Pension Fund (ATP) and the Wage Earners' 
Cost-of-Living Fund (LD) in Danish trade and industry now that 
Conservative Party leader Hans Engell is receptive to the idea. 
  The two government partners of many years, the Liberals and 
the Conservatives, are deeply divided over allowing wage-earner 
and pension funds to invest billions of kroner in Danish trade 
and industry. 
  Conservative leader Hans Engell surprisingly signaled in 
yesterday's paper that the party is now ready to allow ATP and 
LD to have more influence: 
  "The wage earners' money is just as good as the firms' own 
money," Engels said. [passage omitted] 
  Kirsten Jacobsen, the Progress Party's spokesperson on 
business finances, was "totally unable to comprehend" Engell's 
turnaround. 
  "He has launched an idea that former Industrial Affairs 
Minister Anne Birgitte Lundholt, also a Conservative, fought 
against tooth and nail," she said. 
  Sten Gade, Socialist People's Party (SF) group chairman, 
cannot understand the Progress Party's opposition because he 
recalls that the party supported such proposals in Glistrup's 
day. [passage omitted] 
  Labor Minister Jytte Andersen (Social Democrat) is pleased 
with the Conservative move because it ensures a broad majority 
when the ATP and LD law is amended. [passage omitted] 
  The four parties in the government are about to fall into 
step after some internal discussion. Yesterday BERLINGSKE 
TIDENDE tried in vain to get a comment from Industrial Affairs 
Minister Mimi Jakobsen, the leader of the Center Democrats (CD). 
The party previously opposed raising the investment limit.

<F P=106> [Article by Henrik Qvortrup: "Liberals and Conservatives </F>
Court Mimi and Jelved"] 
  [Text] The Liberals and the Conservatives have come to 
realize that they need the support of the center parties, even 
if the outcome of the coming election is a 
Liberal-Conservative-Progress Party coalition. 
  Lesson number one in Danish politics: The way to power and 
influence is through the goodwill of the small center parties. 
  This is how it has always been, how it is now, and 
apparently 
how it will be after the coming election. 
  Just ask Poul Schlueter or Poul Nyrup Rasmussen what they 
would have done without the blessing of the Christian Party, the 
Radical Liberals, or the Center Democrats. 
  The leaders of the current nonsocialist opposition, Hans 
Engell (Conservative) and Uffe Ellemann-Jensen (Liberal), appear 
to have drawn similar conclusions as to the indispensability of 
the small center parties. 
  Even with a straight Liberal-Conservative-Progress Party 
coalition on the horizon, the two dominant nonsocialist 
political figures are in a hurry to invite the Radical Liberals, 
Christian Party, and Center Democrats to join the coalition 
after the next election. 
  There are promises of big influence on policy. 
  Why all this? Once the election is over, would it not be 
simpler for Ellemann-Jensen and Engell to make the central 
parties pay the price for their governmental romance with Nyrup 
-- and then conduct pure nonsocialist policy together with the 
Progress Party? 
  The answer is that the more the 
Liberal-Conservative-Progress 
Party coalition evolves from a hypothetical fantasy into an 
entirely plausible outcome of the next Folketing election, the 
more Engell and Ellemann-Jensen have had to accept the 
unvarnished reality: A majority government with the Progress 
Party has limited potential. 
  Tax policy, employment policy, and social policy are the 
only 
areas in which the Conservatives and the Liberals are likely to 
have sufficient common ground with the Progress Party to be able 
to patch together a government program. 
  And what of those issues where they and the Progress Party 
are miles apart? In other words, what will a 
Liberal-Conservative government do after the election when it 
comes time to agree on European policy, immigration, legal 
issues, and military policy? 
  Ellemann and Engell know they can hardly depend upon the 
Progress Party on these issues. But they also know that even a 
major victory will not give the Liberals and Conservatives an 
absolute majority without the Progress Party. And finally, the 
two leaders are very much aware that the Social Democrats, once 
they have forfeited their power, will not be easy to deal with. 
  Moreover, the Progress Party -- no matter how presentable or 
power-hungry the party is -- still has some anarchical elements 
left in it. No Liberal or Conservative politician today would 
dare to rely 100 percent upon Pia Kjaersgaard's troops. 
  Ergo: A future Liberal-Conservative government has no choice 
but to seek support from the center parties. 
  The preparations have begun and can be studied like a 
textbook case in subtle political maneuvering. On the one hand, 
the Liberals and the Conservatives are interested in projecting 
themselves as the purebred nonsocialist alternative to the 
present government. On the other hand, they must not seem wholly 
nonsocialist. 
  It is in this light that Engell's relaxation on pension fund 
investment in Danish industry should be viewed. Ellemann-Jensen 
has also been busy sowing seeds among the center parties, 
including the Radical Liberals. 
  The reaction from Party Leader Marianne Jelved was prompt: 
Thanks, but no thanks. 
  If the outcome is a Liberal-Conservative-Progress Party 
coalition, the Radical Liberals will step back and let the 
nonsocialist majority sail on its merry way, Jelved told 
BERLINGSKE TIDENDE in no uncertain terms last Sunday [20 March]. 
  Jelved's rejection should be interpreted largely as a 
tactical move -- many things look different after an election. 
After all, the Radical Liberals did take part in an earlier 
nonsocialist government that was partially built upon the 
Progress Party. 
  The Radical Liberals will hardly have been endeared by the 
fact that the invitation was tendered by none other than 
Ellemann-Jensen. In recent months he has roundly rebuked the 
Radical Liberals for their alleged betrayal of the voters. 
  This leaves the fact that Ellemann-Jensen and Engell can 
certainly not count on the Radical Liberals. The question 
remains whether the situation is any different in the case of 
the Center Democrats, who also have been courted by the Liberals. 
  The situation here is somewhat different. Everything 
suggests 
that the ranks of the Center Democrats will be severely 
decimated in the upcoming election. This is because the voters, 
from all indications, are not in the mood to reward the party 
for its participation in Nyrup Rasmussen's government. In this 
event, it will be difficult for Mimi Jakobsen to refuse to 
release her votes to the nonsocialist wing. 
  At the same time, the Center Democrats could turn out to be 
the deciding factor in determining whether Denmark gets a 
nonsocialist or a Social Democratic-led government after the 
next election. That will happen if neither camp achieves an 
absolute majority. However, the Center Democrats would hardly 
support a Social Democratic government that had to depend upon 
Socialist People's Party votes.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Radical Liberal Strategies"] </F>
  [Text] The Radical Liberal seedling is about to sprout. In 
the period leading up to the Folketing election, the Radical 
Liberals are busy deciding who they will consider working with 
after the election and who will feel the Radical sting. All 
through the past decade, the Radical Liberals have grown used to 
the circumstance that governments could not be formed without 
them. The mere idea that there could be a government that would 
not be dependent upon the Radical Liberal adaptability is reason 
enough for Marianne Jelved to want to test her might. 
  Were the Liberals and Conservatives to receive a majority 
that included the Progress Party, Jelved would be hard as nails. 
Under no circumstances would her party support the 
Liberal-Conservatives on those issues the Progress Party would 
have no part of. It is not immediately evident why Jelved 
suddenly has so much against her old coalition partners in the 
Progress Party. No doubt she is recalling Niels Helveg 
Petersen's well-considered words to the effect that he would 
rather drop below the number needed for representation in 
parliament than work with the Progress Party. After the 1989 
budget agreement, the Radical Liberals and the Progress bunch 
were slapping each other on the back. For the first time, the 
Progress Party had voted for a budget, while the Radical 
Liberals repeatedly declared that the important thing in 
politics was what you got done, not who you did it with. 
  Just 10 days ago Jelved wrote an article in which she stated 
that "The Radical Liberals have a clear policy that we strive to 
implement whenever we can." But now that clear policy has been 
turned over to expose a muddier underside. The Radical Liberals 
can no longer turn their backs on whatever they feel like under 
the respectable guise of cooperation or influence, as Jelved 
formulated it this weekend. Before righteous indignation 
obscures her vision, Jelved needs to remember how with a 
single-seat majority, she and her party helped to ram through an 
extensive tax reform. At that time, there was no fault to be 
found in bloc politics even in its most blatant form. Why, then, 
have moral fits when another majority in the Folketing gets the 
same opportunity -- and uses it? Three years ago, the Radical 
Liberals went to the polls depending upon the Liberals and 
Conservatives' continuation in power. Now Jelved has said that 
she will make life difficult for those very parties should they 
come to power after the election. 
  But perhaps the Radical Liberals are merely preparing to 
change sides again. Indeed, that must be it. The government has 
a strategy meeting at Toruplund today and tomorrow. The Radical 
Liberals cannot "decently" -- if that term is recognized by the 
party -- say such a thing publicly at this point. So why not 
froth at the mouth over the old coalition partners, the better 
to camouflage your future plans.

    [Editorial Report] According to a poll conducted by the 
respected Taloustutkimus organization as summarized by Helsinki 
HELSINGIN SANOMAT on 22 April on page 7, over half of the 500 
voters contacted expressed satisfaction with the way President 
Martti Ahtisaari had performed his job since being inaugurated 
on 1 March. In telephone interviews of 500 voters, around 60 
percent said they were satisfied, while only 12 percent said 
they were dissatisfied. Around 20 percent had no opinion. The 
margin of error with such a small sampling is approximately 5 
percent. 
  By way of contrast, the paper cites a similar poll conducted 
in 1982 by the newspaper KALEVA, which found that Mauno 
Koivisto, Ahtisaari's predecessor, was much more popular after 
serving the same period in office. At this stage in 1982, around 
85 percent of voters said they were satisfied with Koivisto.

<F P=106> [Elisabeth Crona report: "Isolation a Worry in Iceland"] </F>
  [Text] Reykjavik -- "This is a historic last meeting. The 
next time we Nordic foreign ministers meet, Sweden, Norway, and 
Finland will be involved in the European Union [EU] as 
observers." 
  Niels Helveg Petersen, a happy Danish foreign minister, was 
cheering on the Nordic area in the EU after yesterday's meeting 
in Iceland. 
  But the meeting's host, Icelandic Foreign Minister Jon 
Baldvin Hannibalsson (Social Democratic Party), had a bitter 
comment to make: 
  "Iceland, the Faeroes, and Greenland will become even more 
marginalized within Nordic cooperation. Now everybody is saying 
that `the whole of the Nordic area is part of the EU.' When we 
Icelanders come to future Nordic meetings, will we have to sing 
`Who can sail without wind?'" 
  The conclusion that Jon Baldvin Hannibalsson has reached is 
that Iceland too must give consideration to membership. He is 
engaged at present in an intense domestic battle to this end, in 
which he does nothing to spare David Oddsson, his prime 
minister, from the nonsocialist Independence Party. Oddsson's 
party is deeply divided on the EU issue, as is the left-right 
coalition government. The fisheries minister, for example, is 
an opponent of EU membership. 
  Jon Baldvin Hannibalsson's weapons in his battle are three 
opinion polls that have been carried out since the negotiations 
in Brussels and the results the Norwegians achieved in the talks 
on fisheries. These show that a majority of Icelanders now want 
to investigate the possibility of EU membership. A year ago 
only one-quarter of those interviewed had a positive view of 
membership. 
  "It is said that politicians lead the people. But here in 
Iceland the people lead the politicians!" Jon Baldvin 
Hannibalsson told his Nordic counterparts.

<F P=106> [Harald Stanghelle report: "Wind in the Sails of Opposition </F>
to the EU"] 
  [Excerpt] The no side has strengthened its position. In 
the May poll a clear majority say no to the European Union [EU] 
even if Sweden and Finland join. 
  Opinion's EU poll was carried out from Monday to Wednesday 
[2-4 May] this week and is based on 1,000 interviews. The poll 
leaves little doubt that the no side has a favorable wind behind 
it. 
  Since February there has been a majority in favor of 
Norwegian EU membership on the condition that both Sweden and 
Finland join. In April, 42 percent of voters said yes, 37 
percent no, while 21 percent were undecided when asked whether 
Norway should become an EU member if both Sweden and Finland 
joined the EU. 
  The trend has now turned. In May only 36 percent said yes to 
EU membership if the two other Nordic countries join. A total 
of 41 percent said no, while 23 percent of voters had no firm 
opinion. 
  The yes side is also on the retreat when voters answer the 
general question of their attitude toward the EU. Some 29 
percent say yes to Norwegian membership, a fall of 4 percent 
since April. The no side falls back 1 percent, from 48 to 47, 
while the don't know group increases by 4 percent, from 19 to 
23. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article including interview with Liberal Party Secretary </F>
Peter Orn by Anita Kratz; place and date not given: "Tight in 
the Middle for Liberal Party"] 
  [Text] With its defense of the welfare state, the Liberal 
Party risks having the voters regard the party as the keeper of 
a Social Democratic society. But this is not the case! 
  One of party secretary Peter Orn's major tasks, before he 
leaves his job after the election and becomes secretary general 
of the Swedish Red Cross, will be to show how hard the Liberal 
Party has fought in order to build the welfare and how intensely 
one is now working on a renewal of the welfare state. Because 
there is no doubt that it has its flaws and shortcomings, the 
way it has developed. 
  The public monopolies must be abolished, according to Peter 
Orn. And that is what the party is working on as part of the 
government, now that, for example, the family doctor and school 
allowance are being introduced and Cultural Minister Birgit 
Friggebo [Liberal Party] is breaking down the media monopoly. 
  Recently the Conservatives have talked increasingly loudly 
about scrapping the welfare state and instead backing a basic 
security system, in which private insurance solutions would 
replace the principle of lost income in today's social insurance 
system. At the same time tax cuts are high on the Conservatives' 
list of measures. 
  Liberal Party leader and Social Minister Bengt Westerberg 
has 
clearly indicated, to the Conservatives, that the Liberal Party 
will not agree to any tax cuts that force reductions in the 
welfare system. 
<H5>  Powerful Motives </H5>
  Despite these basic ideological differences between the two 
parties, Peter Orn sees no hesitation in governing with the 
Conservatives. 
  "It is possible to govern together. We still have several 
important points in common," says Peter Orn. 
  What is common is getting the economy straightened out. That 
was also the principal reason for the parties joining together 
in the previous election campaign on the program "New Start for 
Sweden." 
  "There are strong motives for this government continuing for 
at least one more mandate period. The economic reorganization is 
far from complete. The Social Democrats have not shown that they 
have an economically good program," says Peter Orn. 
  That is why he does not believe that the Social Democrats 
will succeed in coping with unemployment, one of the most 
important issues during the next election period, since their 
economic policy does not hold up. 
  In Peter Orn's opinion the Social Democrats also fall short 
in their view of the welfare state when they want to scrap the 
family doctor system and eliminate the school allowance. But on 
the EU [European Union] issue as well the Social Democrats are 
much too vague, and membership in the union is of major 
importance to the Liberal Party. 
  Peter Orn can see that the neoliberal proponents within the 
Conservatives have hurt the Liberal Party to some extent. 
  "Sometimes that debate can give a picture of the Liberal 
Party being a defender of status quo. It is important to show 
that we want both to keep the welfare standard, which we 
participated in establishing, and at the same time renew it 
through reform of the major freedoms of choice for schools, 
child care, health care, and media." 
  Altogether, the conclusion for Peter Orn is that the 
invitations from the Social Democrats for cooperation or shared 
government are categorically rejected. 
  "This government will be a majority government," says Peter 
Orn. 
<H5>  Social Democrats Most Unhappy </H5>
  What will happen if the election result shows that it is not 
possible to get a majority government is another story: 
  "Then one must be prepared to create a government across the 
bloc boundaries. But what that will look like, whether we will 
participate in it, that we have not taken a position on at all." 
  It is not all that easy to implement one's dearest issues 
even in a government position. At the moment the family doctor 
system is threatened by the fact that New Democracy intends to 
vote against the proposal together with the Social Democrats. 
Then, as far as Peter Orn is concerned, it will have to become 
an election issue again, and he is not worried about that debate. 
  "We will take that fight if it becomes necessary. Most 
unhappy about that will be the Social Democrats. They realize 
that when a system is in the middle of changing, it backfires on 
the one who wants to tear it up." 
<H5>  Important Reform </H5>
  The dissatisfaction, or disinterest, which has shown up in 
opinion polls and in the debate by the Swedish people and the 
physicians against the family doctor system is something that 
Peter Orn takes with equanimity -- opposition is always present 
during changes. 
  "This reform is important because it establishes the basic 
principle that the patient should have the right to choose the 
doctor he wants. The day that is accomplished the family 
physician is anchored in the hearts of the Swedish people." 
  Equality between men and women is another urgent question, 
on 
which Peter Orn himself has vigorously worked for the 
introduction of a paternal month. 
  He hopes, as liberal as he is, that the necessity of a 
month's paternal leave will get the employer to change his 
attitudes toward the men who want to remain at home with their 
children. 
  The next major equality issue will be work for equal pay by 
men and women. 
  Another Liberal Party profile issue is a generous refugee 
policy. During this mandate period, however, concern about the 
former East Europe has increased pressure on the borders, and 
Immigration Minister Birgit Friggebo has tightened the refugee 
policy by introducing, among other things, the need for visas 
for Bosnians. 
  "The refugee issue has been very difficult," admits Peter 
Orn, but he believes that the party has nevertheless been able 
to stick to the humanity principle. 
<H5>  Own Identity </H5>
  Criticism of the refugee policy within the party has been 
harsh but good, according to Peter Orn. The result was that once 
again the humanitarian reasons for refugees being able to stay 
weigh more heavily. 
<H5>  Stricter Application </H5>
  He also states that application in asylum matters, in view 
of 
the large stream of refugees, has become stricter. One way of 
preventing the Alien Commission from being tougher is, according 
to Peter Orn, that the government once again can take over cases 
for decision that can then become guidelines. 
  Just before ending the interview, Peter Orn examines the 
diagram that shows that the Liberal Party has a major base of 
voters who could envision voting for them (but when it comes 
down to it do not). He states that this problem is nothing new. 
  "Possibly it is so that this center position that a liberal 
party occupies can be mistaken from both the right and the left. 
The great challenge for us is to show that we have an identity 
of our own and that it is based on our liberal values. We do not 
reflect them with respect to other parties."

<F P=106> [Article by Ake Ekdahl: "Male Voters the Party's Base"] </F>
  [Text] No political party is as male dominated in the 
electorate as New Democracy [NYD]. Nearly two-thirds, or 62 
percent, of NYD's voters were men. The party had 9 percent men 
and 5 percent women in its debut election in 1991. A large 
number of them were young LO [National Federation of Trade 
Unions] men in large cities. 
  Since the election, 53 percent of these voters have left New 
Democracy, according to Skop's April poll. Of those who are left 
and of the new arrivals 2.7 percent are women and 6.5 percent 
men. Most are between 18 and 34 years old. Many unemployed 
support the NYD. 
  From now on this party will be governed by three women. That 
is a Swedish record in female representation at the top of the 
party, and without sex quotas as well. 
<H5>  New Expectations </H5>
  More women in leading positions is usually regarded as a 
guarantee of altered values in politics. In the case of New 
Democracy that thesis is being put to a difficult test before 
the election. New Democracy is the driving force behind several 
issues that are usually described as typically "hard" or male 
and where women are generally more cautious. There will be 
expectations for the NYD troika to outline a female profile on 
issues such as European Union [EU] membership, nuclear power, no 
speed limits on the roads, the Oresund bridge, and no to the 
six-hour workday, which have in fact become issues separating 
the sexes. 
  NYD's female government could become an alternative in the 
election for working women who are able to identify with 
ambitious and intellectual Harriet Colliander, with Siv 
Bjorkman, an acknowledged skillful negotiator, and self-employed 
businesswoman Gunilla Anstrup-Persson. 
  If New Democracy is to manage a new parliamentary contract, 
these three must gather an entirely new electorate among 
dissatisfied women a bit on the way into their careers, instead 
of the former Social Democrats and Conservatives who in a 
"personal election" voted Bert Karlsson and Ian Wachtmeister 
into the Riksdag. New Democracy can lure these women primarily 
from the Conservatives, the Liberal Party, and among those who 
have not been voting. 
  The course shifts that could take place in day-to-day 
politics will depend more on how dominant Bert Karlsson becomes 
in the parliamentary group. Ian Wachtmeister intends to stay in 
the Riksdag all spring; he wants to keep his place on the 
Finance Committee and that will continue the internal duels 
within the group between the two factions behind the enemies 
Bert and Ian. 
  Harriet Colliander is to hold her watchful hand over these 
two fighting cocks. 
<H5>  New Leadership </H5>
  Her leadership will be completely different from her 
predecessor's. Wachtmeister ended up in conflict with both the 
parliamentary group and party organizations because he lacked 
patience with the political haggling. He tried to manage the 
party the way a company director manages his enterprises. To 
Wachtmeister marketing politics was the same as selling a new 
product. 
  If the customers/voters do not want to buy what is offered, 
the activity must be closed down, according to Wachtmeister. 
  Such a proposal was met with boos from the meeting in 
Vasteras. 
  It also shows that Ian Wachtmeister does not have serious 
plans for starting a new party and joining the other political 
wild cards in this already splintered Riksdag.

  [Text] The Turkish Secret Services have targeted 35 
politicians, military, shipowners, and others from both Greece 
and Cyprus. The Turkish Secret Services (MIT) [National 
Intelligence Organization] list of immediate targets includes 
three Greek Cypriots among these 35 people. 
  The three Greek Cypriots targeted by MIT are Khristodhoulos 
Veniamin, a longtime former minister; Nikolaos Sampson, a 
fighter during the Liberation Struggle of EOKA [National 
Organization of Cypriot Fighters] and founder of I MAKHI and TO 
THARROS newspapers; and Vasos Lissaridhis, chairman of the 
Socialist Party EDEK [United Democratic Union of Cyprus]. 
  Specifically, the Turkish Secret Services (MIT) in their hit 
lists for each of the aforementioned Greek Cypriots note the 
following: 

  -  Veniamin Khristodhoulos: "Former minister of 
interior and defense of South Cyprus. Veniamin dragged south 
Cyprus into the mire of international terrorism. He has a close 
relationship with the KGB (Russian Secret Services) and the 
Syrian Secret Service." 
  -  Sampson Nikos: "He is a south Cypriot 
who is known as the `Butcher of EOKA.' He is responsible for 
murdering and torturing Turkish Cypriots. He was sentenced to 
life imprisonment for his involvement in the attempt to 
overthrow Makarios. He also came into contact with the Armenian 
terrorist organization `ASALA [Armenian Secret Army for the 
Liberation of Armenia].'" 
  -  Lissaridhis Vasos: "A former Marxist, 
he is the Leader of the South Cypriot party EDEK. In the period 
after '74 he was Makarios' adviser and played a significant role 
in south Cyprus becoming a base for terrorists against Turkey. 
He is one of the south Cypriot politicians who are involved in 
international terrorism." 
  This is not the first time that this information has 
appeared 
in the press. However, after the upsurge of Islamists in both 
Turkey and the occupied Cyprus, this information leads to the 
definite conclusion that Theofilos Yeoryiadhis [pro-Kurdish 
Cypriot activist killed in March] was the first victim on the 
hit list of the Turkish Secret Services but not the last. 
According to the Turkish Secret Services, in addition to the 
Greek Cypriots Veniamin, Sampson, and Lissaridhis, the following 
Greek politicians, among others, are also considered as 
dangerous to Turkey and are on the hit list: Karamanlis, 
Papandreou, Maroudhas, Alavanos, Kapsis, Viryinia Tsoudherou, 
Papathemelis, Kaklamanis, and others. The list also includes 
Greek military people such as generals Moustaklis, Opropoulos, 
Zervos, Pappas, Konstandinidhis, Kalamakis, as well as Retired 
Admiral Andonios Nazakis and the well-known ship owner Andreas 
Potamianos. According to the Turkish Secret Services, all the 
above mentioned are considered "founders of terrorism" and must 
be eliminated at all costs. At the same time, another MIT goal 
is to consolidate in the international sphere and primarily in 
Europe the concept that the Greeks of Cyprus and Greece have 
direct relations with international terrorist networks as well 
as with the leaders of people who are struggling for their 
independence. Of course, all this is just an attempt by Turkey 
to gag all those who raise their voices against Turkey and 
reveal the Ankara military's illegal plans to impose Islamists 
on the European and, by extension, the world scenes.

  [Text] Addressing the 10th meeting of the European Union 
[EU] parliamentary committees in charge of European affairs, 
Deputy Foreign Minister Yeoryios Papandreou said that if Turkey 
accepts the European principles Greece will be the first country 
to help it join the EU. Papandreou said he hopes solutions will 
be found soon to smooth Athens-Skopje relations. 
  In his address, the deputy foreign minister said the Turkish 
Cypriot community should have pursued Cyprus' accession to the 
EU. Referring to Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia--FYROM], Papandreou said it must be understood that it 
is in Greece's national interest that Skopje survives. He 
added, however, that Skopje must stop violating the CSCE 
principles. 
  Chamber of Deputies President Apostolos Kaklamanis opened 
the 
conference and stressed: The continuing bloodshed in the former 
Yugoslavia is another great challenge for all of us. He 
specifically stressed the dangers facing the Balkans and greater 
Europe. Kaklamanis concluded: You realize the additional 
reasons that have caused concern for the Greek people and the 
intense interest in restoring peace.

taking place in Birmingham, England, with a new flag. At the 
beginning, the Skopjeans told organizers that they had lost 
their flag. But a short while later they presented a new one. 
The new flag has a yellow sun with 42 rays and six lines 
connected together in the form of an X over a red background. 
The team paraded as The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. 
The team captain later revealed that the new flag was given to 
them by his country's Sports Ministry. 
  ATHENS NEWS AGENCY reports that the fact that Skopjeans 
changed their flag indicates that they are ready to present an 
alternative solution and perhaps they are ready to abandon the 
Sun of Veryina which they had presented as their symbol.

  [Text] Balta Hasan, a 38-year-old Turkish man, who had 
escaped from a Greek prison where he was serving a 15-year 
sentence, has been named as the head of a three-member ring of 
drug dealers broken up by the police yesterday. 
  The drugs were smuggled to Greece through the river Evros by 
a 39-year-old Turkish casino owner, Deniz Ozkan, and were handed 
over to his compatriot, escaped from a Patras prison last 
February. "He was on a five-day leave, as the law provides, but 
he never returned to the jail," Khristos Keramidas, Attiki's 
security police chief, told reporters. 
  A few days ago, officers of the drug squad spotted the 
escaped prisoner in Passalimani, Piraeus. They followed him and 
found out that he was being hidden by a Greek convicted drug 
dealer Khristos Peroutseas, aged 36. The police stormed his 
apartment yesterday and arrested the two men, discovering one 
and a half kilos of heroin.

<F P=106> [Commentary by K. I. Angelopoulos: "Ankara's Summer </F>
`Targets'..."] 
  [Text] Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas was clear when 
on Friday [6 May], for the second time in one week, he said in 
Istanbul: If Cyprus becomes a member of the European Union [EU] 
before Turkey, then the "state" of northern Cyprus "will proceed 
to economic and political incorporation with Turkey." 
  Denktas made the above statement after publicly expressing 
his "relief" at the confirmation that the Turkish leadership 
once again adopted his policy on the Cyprus issue. Indeed, now 
the Turkish military leadership agrees with Denktas that 
occupied northern Cyprus should remain what it essentially is 
now: a Turkish province. That is why he should not get 
involved in discussions (at the United Nations) that could 
result in the beginning of "confidence" with Nicosia. This 
could possibly lead to talks about a "federation." And Ankara 
estimates that this, in turn, would lead the EU partners to 
examine more carefully the issue of the Republic of Cyprus' 
accession to the European Union. The EU Commission's opinion on 
Cyprus' accession notes that the only problem obstructing this 
accession is "political." 
  Nicosia and Athens will try in 1995 (when the issue of 
Cyprus' accession will return to the agenda) to convince the EU 
partners that the nonsolution of the political problem is 
exclusively due to the Turkish side. Consequently, the 
accession of Cyprus should proceed, which by itself would 
facilitate the search for a federal solution in Cyprus based on 
the fact that Athens and Nicosia have accepted the 
"confidence-building measures." 
  Now, Turkey says--thus revealing its true intentions on the 
future of Cyprus--that if such developments unfold, the occupied 
northern Cyprus will officially become Turkish territory. 
  The formulation of this position by Ankara (through Denktas) 
comes to complete a scenario drawn by Turkey's military 
establishment regarding Greek-Turkish relations: North Cyprus 
is Turkish, the militarized Greek islands in the Aegean lead 
Turkey to contemplate a "reaction" of a military nature, and the 
"oppression" of the "Turkish minority" in western Thrace forces 
Ankara to mobilize the mechanism for its "protection." 
  Twenty years after "Attila's" invasion of Cyprus, the 
Turkish 
leadership confirms today that Greece remains its "target." And 
everything indicates that the outright failure of the power 
system imposed by Evren's military dictatorship from 1980 and 
beyond leads Ankara to reinforce its aim to attack, at the first 
opportunity, the line running western Thrace-Aegean-Cyprus. As 
I KATHIMERINI has pointed out, the Turkish regime today is 
anxiously searching for a "victory" in order to reinforce its 
badly damaged prestige on the domestic front. 
  Athens knows that despite the Turkish leadership's usual 
loud 
rhetoric, a "move" by Ankara in the summer cannot be ruled out. 
The government has information on the possibility of 
"provocations" in western Thrace, Cyprus or the Aegean to be 
appropriately "utilized" by Ankara, in conjunction with Greece's 
known "Balkan problems." 
  The Greek Government is obliged to be ready for a "hot" 
summer.

  [Text] Washington--It has been ascertained that the United 
States, which regards Turkey's contacts with Iraq as a violation 
of the embargo on that country, has purchased oil from Iraq 
because it is cheaper. The records held by the U.S. Congress 
contain information that confirms that the United States and 
Jordan have violated the UN sanctions against Iraq in order to 
provide humanitarian aid to northern Iraq. A statement by Lee 
Hamilton, head of the House Subcommittee on Europe and Middle 
East Affairs, has been placed on record. It is as follows: "It 
is all right for Jordan and the United States to violate the 
embargo, but it seems that we do not want anyone else to do the 
same." 
  While the officials of the U.S. Defense and State 
Departments 
briefed the subcommittee on the U.S. policy on Iraq, Hamilton 
asked: "The Accounting Office, which is affiliated with the 
Congress, has claimed that we acquire oil from Iraq. Is that 
right?" 
  Ronald Newman, head of the State Department's office for 
Iran 
and Iraq affairs, replied to Hamilton. He said: "We acquire 
the oil through mediators in northern Iraq. That is more 
economic." 
  The views Hamilton and Newman exchanged are as follows: 
  [Hamilton] I was informed a short while ago that the 
sanctions are important and that they should be maintained. As 
far as I can see, the United States allows Jordan to acquire oil 
from Iraq. Does that not conflict with our policy? 
  [Newman] I do not believe that it conflicts with our general 
policy. The terminology we use should be clear. I do not deny 
the source which supplies the oil. 
  [Hamilton] We are maintaining the sanctions together with 
the 
rest of the world. However, we have acquired oil from Iraq. Do 
you disagree? 
  [Newman] The UN Security Council Resolution 689 contains 
humanitarian provisions. We work with a limited budget." 
  [Hamilton] We also allow Jordan to acquire the oil it needs 
from Iraq. Is that not so? 
  [Newman] Yes, that is right. Jordan has been receiving oil 
from Iraq in return for that country's debts for some time now. 
The UN Sanctions Committee has placed that on record. 
  [Hamilton] It is alright for Jordan and the United States to 
violate the embargo, but it seems that we do not want anyone 
else to do the same. 
  [Newman] We do not believe that we have violated the 
embargo. 
What we have done was for humanitarian purposes. 
  Hamilton also asked why they have asked for $15 million for 
their aid operations in northern Iraq from the budget for 1995. 
A State Department official said that the cash was required for 
the basic needs of the people in northern Iraq. 
  Meanwhile, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Christine 
Shelly 
has disclosed that U.S. officials are holding talks with the 
Turkish Government on the question of retrieving the oil in the 
pipeline between Turkey and Iraq. Stressing that she realizes 
how important the lifting of the embargo on Iraq is for Turkey, 
Shelly said: "However, Washington is opposed to any initiative 
against the embargo."

<F P=106> [Report by Haluk Geray: "Design by the U.S. Congress on the </F>
Kurdish Problem"] 
  [Text] Ankara--It has been reported that the argument in 
the Congress that the U.S. Administration has violated the UN 
embargo on Baghdad is aimed at legalizing the scenario on the 
establishment of an independent Kurdish state in northern Iraq. 
It will be recalled that Lee Hamilton, head of the House 
Subcommittee on Europe and Middle East Affairs who defends the 
view that Turkey should allow the Kurds to establish a 
federation or a state of their own, claimed in the Congress two 
days ago that the Clinton Administration has violated the 
embargo on Iraq. According to Hamilton, the allocation of funds 
for the Kurds for the acquisition of oil from the Baghdad 
Administration constitutes a violation of the UN sanctions. 
  Several sources in Ankara have described Hamilton's approach 
as aimed at justifying the plans that have been drawn up to 
fragment Iraq for the establishment of an independent state in 
the northern part of that country. The sources said that the 
export of oil from Iraq would be a violation of the UN embargo 
but, technically speaking, the transfer of oil by the Baghdad 
Administration from one part of that country to another cannot 
be regarded as a violation of the sanctions. 
  An official has said that Hamilton may be right only if a 
Kurdish State existed in northern Iraq. He asserted: "The 
United States, European Union, and Turkey have provided 
humanitarian aid to the Kurds in northern Iraq. That applies to 
the need of the Kurds for fuel. They have used the funds the 
United States has made available to them to acquire oil from 
al-Mawsil. That cannot be described as a violation of the 
embargo because the oil remains in Iraq. However, any attempt to 
take the oil out of Iraq will violate the embargo. Hamilton 
wished to hint that a Kurdish State exists above the 36th 
parallel in Iraq. He believes that the embargo has been 
violated because a foreign state has purchased oil from Iraq 
with U.S. funds. It seems that he is convinced that Iraq has 
been divided into two parts and that anything that crosses from 
the south to the northern part of the 36th parallel is an 
exported commodity." 
  Considering the fact that Iraq's territorial integrity is 
essential for the preservation of Turkey's territorial 
integrity, Ankara is convinced that the Clinton Administration 
has not violated the embargo from a technical viewpoint. 
However, officials have drawn attention to the following: 
<H5>  Funds Have Been Transferred </H5>
  Technically speaking, the embargo may not have been 
violated. 
Nevertheless, funds have been transferred to Baghdad through the 
Kurds in Iraq. However, Turkey's plan to withdraw oil from the 
Karkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline does not require the transfer of 
funds to the Baghdad Administration. The source that will be 
created through the withdrawal of the oil from that pipeline 
will be channeled to Iraq in the form of foodstuffs. 
  The signs we have received from Washington indicate that 
Turkey and the United States may agree on that plan. In fact, 
Ankara expects the U.S. Administration to finalize its 
assessment during the next few days. The UN Security Council or 
the UN Sanctions Committee will most likely make the necessary 
"changes" to allow Turkey's plan to be put into effect. 
  Meanwhile, it has been ascertained that the Kurdish 
officials 
in northern Iraq have proposed to Ankara that Turkey should move 
to prospect for oil in their part of the country.

<F P=106> [Column by Mehmet Ali Birand: "Turkey Cannot Continue To </F>
Watch Iraq in This Way..."] 
  [Text] There is growing discord in relations between Turkey 
and the United States. The Iraq issue, the most important among 
the problems between Turkey and the United States, is gradually 
worsening. Turkey's flirtation with Baghdad has made Washington 
extremely uncomfortable. Washington is reportedly worried that 
the UN embargo on Baghdad will be violated and the Saddam 
administration's existence will be prolonged if Ankara insists 
on its approach. Washington is also worried that the approach 
maintained by Turkey, which is the most important country from 
the point of view of the UN sanctions, may disrupt the already 
weakening alliance against Iraq; that is, if Turkey does not 
abandon its stance. 
  The U.S. view is this: "The approach you adopted when we 
were about to achieve our goal will encourage Saddam Husayn. 
That will make things difficult for us." Consequently, that 
country is trying to persuade Turkey to change its position. An 
effort is being made to find an intermediary formula to obstruct 
the approach maintained by Turkey, which is swaying under the 
pressure of an economic crisis and the search for an agreement 
with the IMF on credits. 
  Apparently, the embargo on Iraq is being maintained upon the 
insistence of the United States. Washington knows it must 
decide what policy to adopt on Iraq. The pressure at the United 
Nations to lift the embargo is gradually increasing. Many 
countries, Jordan in particular, have said "the embargo should 
be lifted. It is enough." The next few weeks will be very 
important from that viewpoint. The UN Security Council must 
reconsider the issue and decide whether to maintain the embargo. 
Attention is focused on Washington. The decision it will adopt 
to change or maintain its approach will have a bearing on Iraq's 
territorial integrity, regional developments, and the relations 
between Turkey and the United States. 
<H5>  Iraq Has Been Forced To Pay Enough </H5>
  Iraq has suffered enough of a penalty for causing the Gulf 
War. The UN decision to impose an embargo on it has been 
implemented in an unprecedented way. All its heavy arms have 
been destroyed under UN supervision. Baghdad revealed a few 
days ago that it has relinquished its claim that Kuwait is a 
part of Iraq. 
  The embargo has been an adequate lesson for Iraq. Iraq has 
lost some of its wealth and its military strength has weakened. 
But the United States would be wrong to expect its pressure to 
achieve Saddam Husayn's removal. On the contrary, the 
conditions are helping Saddam Husayn to strengthen his 
administration. The Iraqi people have rallied around their 
leader, prolonging the Saddam administration's term in office. 
<H5>  Turkey Cannot Endure the Embargo.... </H5>
  Turkey has suffered significantly from the embargo on Iraq. 
So far it has lost $20 billion. The loss will increase by $5 
to $6 billion a year. The issue has reached a point where it 
can no longer be endured. The serious situation will be better 
understood if this is considered together with the rate of 
unemployment and political and social unrest in southeast Turkey. 
  As if all that is not enough, Turkey has been assigned an 
active task within the framework of the Hammer Force for 
penalizing Iraq. It is as if Turkey is being forced to punish 
itself. 
  That is what the public has been unable to understand... 
  Turkey is expected to continue to support the Hammer Force, 
while its economic problems are ignored and its wish to use the 
oil from the Karkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline is rejected. No one 
agrees with the excuse: "Turkey cannot act against the Workers 
Party of Kurdistan militants in northern Iraq without the Hammer 
Force. Nor can it bomb Iraq's territory whenever it wants. It 
will risk significant world reaction. But the United States has 
preferred to overlook developments in the region because of the 
existence of the Hammer Force." 
  The Turkish Grand National Assembly will debate the 
extension 
of the Hammer Force's mandate for another six months very soon. 
The debate that will be held will be much more serious than 
those that were held in the past. In view of that, Washington 
should consider the anxiety in Turkey when it moves to decide on 
the embargo on Iraq and the withdrawal of the oil from the 
Karkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline. The U.S. approach has begun to 
seriously harm Turkey and the region.

<F P=106> ["Analysis" by Semih D. Idiz: "Turkey and U.S. Tread a </F>
Delicate Path on Iraq"] 
  [Text] Ankara--The firm U.S. stance on the U.N.-imposed 
embargo on Iraq, and Turkey's continuing insistence that the 
question of its losses resulting from that embargo be addressed, 
remain potential sources of friction between Ankara and 
Washington. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's visit 
last week to the Gulf, his article published in THE NEW YORK 
TIMES over the weekend, entitled "Rigid Iraq Merits No UN 
Mercy," as well as a statement by a U.S. State Department 
spokesman on Monday [2 May] on the subject, are all being 
interpreted in Ankara as open signals of disapproval of the 
policy Turkey is trying to develop over Iraq. 
  Prime Minister Ciller on Tuesday denied recent press reports 
that Washington had given Turkey a "strongly worded" diplomatic 
note on the matter, and said that Ankara's efforts towards the 
lifting of the embargo on Iraq would continue. Ciller also 
said that Turkey had no intention of departing from the U.N. 
system on this issue. 
  Hoping to avoid a serious fall-out with Washington over this 
matter, but still trying to ensure that Turkey's vital interests 
regarding the ongoing problem in Iraq are not overlooked, 
officials in Ankara have acknowledged that Turkey is currently 
treading a delicate course in terms of its relations with the 
United States. 
  A sign of this was given by Foreign Ministry Undersecretary 
Ozdem Sanberk, when he told reporters on Monday that contacts 
with the United States on this subject were continuing. "The 
United States acknowledges the need to work together on this 
issue," Sanberk said, indicating that technical level talks were 
underway in Washington. 
  "Turkey has overtaken everyone by taking the Iraq initiative 
in hand," he added, underlining that it would not let go of this 
initiative in the debate which will apparently continue. 
Sanberk's visit to Baghdad last month, the highest level visit 
from Turkey since the Gulf Crisis, had raised some eyebrows in 
Washington. Diplomatic sources say the visit increased the 
discomfort felt ever since Prime Minister Ciller started arguing 
last year that the embargo on Iraq should be eased. Upon his 
return to Amman from Baghdad, Sanberk remarked that the two 
countries had agreed to flush the pipeline running between them, 
within the context of a "limited rescue operation," in order to 
prevent the pipeline from being damaged. This statement was 
also met with displeasure. 
  "We propose a limited rescue operation, whereby the pipeline 
will be flushed once or twice, repaired and closed, and then we 
will wait for the lifting of the embargo" Sanberk had said. 
Sanberk told reporters on Monday that Turkey's flushing of the 
pipeline did not require an application to the U.N. Sanctions 
Committee because Turkey would not export the oil and no funds 
would be transferred to Iraq as a result of this operation. But 
there have been suggestions emanating from officials in Ankara 
that of the 12 million barrels of oil in the pipeline, 3.8 
billion belonged to Turkey, because Ankara was owed $2 billion 
by Iraq. Officials also suggested that a portion of the oil 
belonging to Iraq could be sold to meet the humanitarian needs 
of that country, without breaking the U.N. sanctions. 
  However an article in THE WASHINGTON POST on Saturday quoted 
anonymous U.S. officials in Washington as saying that such an 
arrangement "may have some elements that could violate the 
sanctions." Turkey argues that the Security Council should 
review the trade sanctions against Iraq because these have not 
only proved ineffective but have also damaged Turkish interests. 
Official estimates in Ankara indicate that ever since the 
United Nations imposed the sanctions on Baghdad, following the 
invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, Turkey has lost at least $3 
billion a year in trade, services and revenues from the oil 
pipeline which it shares with Iraq. 
  Shortly after coming to power last year, Prime Minister 
Tansu 
Ciller made getting Turkey's allies to rethink the embargo one 
of Ankara's main priorities. 
  Addressing the parliamentary group of her True Path Party on 
Tuesday, Ciller repeated that Turkey was incurring great losses 
from the embargo on Iraq, and estimated that the total loss to 
date was $20 billion. The 1.6 million-barrel-per-day pipeline 
links the Karkuk oil fields in Iraq with Yumurtalik, a terminal 
on the Turkish Mediterranean coast. 
  Ciller also stressed that the pipeline ran the risk of 
severe damage due to disuse, and said that the recent agreement 
with Iraq aimed at ensuring that the damage was assessed and 
repaired. 
  Ciller also suggested that a portion of the oil from the 
pipeline could be used for humanitarian aid to Iraq. "Our 
efforts without allies to get the embargo lifted are continuing. 
It is not true that the U.S. has given us a note because of 
these efforts of ours. There is an effort to make it seem as 
though we were departing from the U.N. system on this issue. 
This is not true," Ciller said. 
  The United Nations has offered to allow Iraq to export oil 
worth $1.6 billion through Turkey to pay for imports of food, 
medicine, relief work and war reparations, but Baghdad has 
rejected the offer, claiming that the conditions were a 
violation of its sovereignty. 
  In talking about giving humanitarian aid in return for oil, 
Ankara is said to be making use of the advantage provided by the 
U.N. decision. Turkish officials say that Ankara's current 
diplomatic activities vis-a-vis Iraq can be characterized as 
"intense lobbying." 
  They say that while they do not intend to "let Iraq get away 
with a violation of international law," the world also has to 
acknowledge the full ramifications, for a country like Turkey, 
of the ongoing situation in Baghdad. 
  They also argue that the sanctions against Iraq have 
contributed to the destabilization in Turkey's troubled 
Southeast, because of their adverse economic effects in the 
already depressed region. 
  "This is too high a price for any country to pay, especially 
as it is not clear for how long the regime in Baghdad, which the 
U.S. is so opposed to, will remain in power," one official told 
the TURKISH DAILY NEWS. "If the proof is in the facts, then it 
must be admitted that the embargo has not achieved its 
objective. It has hardly brought about any change in 
administration in Baghdad," he remarked. 
  He went on to say: ``At present, we are putting forward 
proposals that have to be taken into account, given that Turkey 
is a regional country and following developments in Iraq closely. 
  ``One proposal we have put forward, based on our own 
personal 
observations, is that the sanctions against Baghdad have not 
worked in the way that the U.S. and some of our other allies 
wanted.'' In other words, Saddam has grown immune to the 
negative effects of these sanctions, and has turned the 
resistance of them into a social virtue for those that support 
him. "This means that there is no light at the end of the 
tunnel as of yet. Unless the U.N. and key allies such as the 
U.S. come up with a new formula to overcome the impasse with 
Iraq, it is senseless that a country like Turkey should be left 
to foot a massive bill that it cannot afford." [quotation marks 
as published] 
  Christine Shelley, a deputy spokesman for the U.S. State 
Department, told reporters on Monday, "We understand that it is 
important for Turkey's economic future that they should be able 
to preserve what for them is certainly a very vital economic 
asset." 
  But she added immediately, "We have made it clear that we 
would be opposed to any steps that violated the U.N. sanctions 
against Iraq," thus underscoring the determined stance adopted 
by her country on this issue. 
  Officials in Turkey also say that what Ankara is asking for, 
in terms of the Iraqi pipeline, is not totally without precedent. 
  They point to the "oil-for-debt arrangement," which the 
United Nations extended to Jordan, enabling the country to 
import Iraqi crude for domestic use, without any cash changing 
hands. Officials say that this is one option that Turkey might 
accept. They also point to an arrangement with Saudi Arabia 
after the Gulf War. Under this agreement, the Saudi government 
flushed the Iraqi crude oil in the pipeline that runs through 
its territory, sold it and gave the money to the Saudi Aramco 
Oil Co. to cover the costs of maintaining the pipeline and 
storage tanks.

  [Text] Ankara--President Geydar Aliyev of Azerbaijan 
arrived in Ankara on Thursday [5 May] for a stopover on his way 
to Baku from Brussels. 
  Aliyev had been in Brussels to sign the so-called 
Partnership 
for Peace, a half way accommodation for former Warsaw Pact 
countries wanting to join NATO. 
  Addressing reporters on his arrival in Ankara Aliyev said he 
believed this arrangement with NATO would contribute to a 
solution of his country's dispute with Armenia over the enclave 
of Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  He added that he had wanted to meet with President Suleyman 
Demirel on his return from NATO and had decided on a brief 
stopover in Ankara for this purpose. 
  The two presidents held talks over a working lunch at the 
Presidential Palace in Ankara. Aliyev left for baku after the 
lunch. 
  Talking to reporters at a press conference in Brussels on 
Wednesday Aliyev said his country was considering seeking 
observer status, or even full membership, of OPEC. 
  Aliyev added that Azerbaijan's future relations with the 
12-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries may be 
decided by talks that started in Istanbul on Monday, between the 
Azeri state oil company and Western petroleum companies. He 
said Azerbaijan could "in the very near future" sign contracts 
with Western companies to develop his country's oil reserves. 
  Azerbaijan was a major source of oil for the former Soviet 
Union. 
  Although the main oil facilities lie outside the disputed 
territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, Aliyev added that Azerbaijan's 
oil industry had been hurt by the impact of the country's bloody 
six-year conflict with Armenia.

  [Text] Ankara--Azeri President Geydar Aliyev, who made a 
brief stopover in Ankara on his way from Brussels, asked Ankara 
for more military cooperation, particularly in the field of 
training. 
  Diplomatic circles said after the visit that Aliyev had 
particularly asked for Turkish military trainers to train the 
Azeri National Army and advise on military strategy. The Azeri 
president was also seen having extensive talks with Turkish 
Chief of Staff Dogan Gures before and during a working lunch in 
the Presidential Palace. 
  Aliyev noted that he hoped the signed accords between the 
two 
countries--including a friendship and cooperation accord, as 
well as one on military training--would be implemented. "We 
have had consultations on speedy implementation of the signed 
accords," he told a press conference at Esenboga Airport after 
his talks. 
  He said the ties would be enhanced with NATO member Turkey 
following its newly-signed Partnership for Peace deal with the 
alliance. 
  He said Azerbaijan's six-year-old war with Armenia made the 
clauses of the agreement specially important for his country, 
but did not elaborate. 
  His remarks in Ankara followed the failure of a new round of 
Nagorno-Karabakh peace talks in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, where the 
deputy speaker of the Azeri Parliament said his side objected to 
a clause in the draft agreement providing for peacekeeping 
forces from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) being 
brought into the conflict zone. 
  Afiaddin Dzhalilov told reporters that the document did not 
mention occupation of parts of Azerbaijan by Armenian forces. 
The draft accord, which provides for a cease-fire from May 9, 
was signed by all other participants, but Dzhalilov's refusal to 
join made it invalid, REUTERS reported from the Kyrgyz capital. 
"Turkey will continue to be the advocate of Azerbaijan's 
righteous demands," Demirel said, in reference to the Azeri 
calls for Armenian withdrawal from its territories. In a veiled 
reference to the Kyrgyz and Russian initiatives, a statement 
from the president's Press Office said Turkey supported the 
Minsk process of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe (CSCE) for the establishment of peace in the region. 
  Demirel said in the statement that Turkey was ready to do 
what it could in the democratization process in Azerbaijan. 
  Aliyev, in turn, assured in the press conference that 
Ebulfaz 
Echibey, the deposed president of Azerbaijan, was "living well" 
in Keleki, a small village of Nakhichevan. 
  "God give him long life," he said. 
  Turkey has attempted in the past to establish cooperation 
between the two leaders in Azerbaijan, claiming their 
cooperation would ensure domestic stability and enable a united 
fight against the Armenian attacks.

  [Text] Ankara, May 9 (A.A.) -- Representatives of 
consortium member organizations came together in Istanbul on 
Monday [9 May] to evaluate the recent situation before a final 
agreement is signed in Baku. 
  The Anatolian Agency was told that a consortium including 
the 
Turkish Petroleum Company TPAO and several western companies, 
which are responsible for exploration and production of 
Azerbaijani oil and its transportation to international markets, 
and Azerbaijani National Petroleum Company SOCAR officials came 
together to overcome the difference of opinion between them. 
  They discussed the production conditions of Azerbaijani oil 
and the route of the crude oil to international markets. 
  The consortium includes British BP, American Amoco, Penzoil, 
Mcdermott, Unocal, Ramco, Norway's Penzoil and TPAO. 
  TPAO is hosting the meetings which started on May 2. 
  Meanwhile, the sides will specify a date for the final 
agreement that will be signed in Baku. 
  During the meetings they decided that SOCAR will not invest 
in exploration and production, consortium member companies will 
meet the financing of the project. At the beginning Azerbaijan 
will get 70 percent of the oil but this can change in the future. 
  Meanwhile the most important improvement of the meetings was 
that all the sides approved of the oil passing over Turkey en 
route to the Mediterranean. According to this Central Asian oil 
including Azerbaijani oil will flow to the Mediterranean over 
Turkey in at least three or four years. 
  TPAO's share in Azerbaijani oil will be 2.5 percent.

<F P=106> [Report by Nazlan Ertan] </F>
  [Text] Ankara--Azerbaijan's acceptance to sit at the same 
table with representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh in peace talks in 
Bishkek does not mean Baku has recognized this enclave as a 
party to the Karabakh conflict, Azerbaijani Ambassador to Ankara 
said Tuesday [10 May]. 
  On the eve of the three-day peace talks hosted by 
Kyrgyzstan, 
Ambassador Mamed Novruz ogly Aliyev told the Turkish Daily News 
that Azerbaijan still regarded Nagorno-Karabakh as part of its 
territory and not as a separate party to the conflict. Novruz 
ogly's remarks flatly contradicted those of Vladimir Shumeyko, 
chairman of the upper chamber of Russian Parliament, who was 
quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying that Azerbaijan had 
stated its readiness to recognize Nagorno-Karabakh as "one of 
the parties in the conflict." Shumeyko's remarks coincide with 
new Armenian attacks north and east of Karabakh and a new round 
of peace talks in the Kyrgyz capital, Bishkek, between 
Parliament leaders from Russia, Azerbaijan, Armenia and 
Kyrgyzstan, as well as representatives from Karabakh. "We have 
sat at the same table with representatives of Karabakh in 
international meetings before. We have no objection to their 
presence. Be they of Armenian or Azerbaijani origin, they are 
representatives of our people in this enclave and we are ready 
to listen to their problems. But we do not recognize them as a 
party to the conflict," Novruz ogly said. 
  "They are there as the representatives of Karabakh. 
Nagorno-Karabakh has no Parliament and no parliamentary 
leader," he said, referring to the self-declared Karabakh 
Parliament that previously passed a resolution of annexation to 
Armenia. "They will not have the same status at the table as 
the other participants."

  [Text] President Suleyman Demirel has concluded his 
day-long working visit to Egypt and has returned to Turkey. 
Prior to his departure from Cairo Demirel visited the Egyptian 
People's Assembly. He visited the general assembly hall and the 
assembly museum and was briefed by officials. On his departure 
from Cairo Demirel was seen off by Egyptian President Husni 
Mubarak. 
  On his way to Turkey in a chat with journalists, Demirel 
assessed his visit saying that Egypt is an important country for 
Turkey and that there are many activities for Turkish 
businessmen in that country. Demirel said: The Middle East 
peace process is opening a new window here. We should not lag 
behind. Pointing out that a Turkish-Egyptian agreement on the 
encouragement and guarantee of investments will be signed, 
Demirel stressed that there are extensive investment 
opportunities for Turkish industrialists especially in Gaza. 
  At Esenboga Airport, Demirel was received by Turkish Grand 
National Assembly Speaker Husamettin Cindoruk, Chief of Staff 
General Dogan Gures, Deputy Prime Minister Murat Karayalcin, 
other ministers and officials. Speaking at a news conference at 
the airport, Demirel said that he held extremely beneficial and 
fruitful contacts with Mubarak, adding that a strong bilateral 
cooperation will serve the interests of the two countries and 
the region as well as world peace and stability. Recalling that 
Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin and Energy Minister Veysel Atasoy 
held beneficial contacts in Cairo, Demirel noted that during the 
talks he held with Egyptian officials it was confirmed that both 
countries share the will and determination to further develop 
bilateral cooperation and advance political relations to an 
excellent level. He stated that a joint initiative in the field 
of natural gas will be beneficial, adding that the necessary 
technical work for such cooperation will be initiated 
immediately. Demirel noted that the bilateral trade volume 
might be raised to a billion dollars in a short time. 
  Recalling that his visit to Cairo coincided with significant 
developments in the region, Demirel continued: 
  [Begin Demirel recording] The Israeli-Palestinian agreements 
signed on 4 May have opened a new hopeful era in the Middle East 
peace process. The efforts exerted by the friendly and 
brotherly Arab Republic of Egypt, which has made very 
significant contributions to the realization of this agreement, 
and the honorable Egyptian president, Mubarak, deserve praise. 
I hope that Turkish-Egyptian relations, that have reached an 
excellent level as a result of the mutual visits that have been 
exchanged, will be further diversified and our bilateral 
cooperation, which is based on sound foundations, will be 
further developed. Both countries have the political will to 
realize these goals. [end recording] 
  Demirel said that during his visit views were exchanged on 
regional and international issues concerning the two countries. 
He concluded by saying that another appeal was made to the 
international community to end, as soon as possible, the human 
tragedy in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Azerbaijan.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has left for 
Luxembourg to participate in the Western European Union's [WEU] 
spring ministerial council meeting to be held there. 
  In a statement at Esenboga Airport, Cetin stressed that 
Turkey directly and actively participates in the WEU's 
activities at all levels. Cetin added that within the framework 
of the formulas devised in Maastricht the WEU constitutes the 
defense branch of the European Union as well as NATO's European 
pillar. Pointing out that the structuring of the WEU is at its 
beginning, Cetin added, however, that it has a special political 
position between the two fundamental institutions of the Western 
world. Cetin said: We view the WEU as a lasting factor of the 
European defense structure. We, therefore, contribute to the 
operational development of the union. We have also observed that 
the WEU member countries are becoming more aware of Turkey's 
contributions to the WEU. Pointing out that initiatives are 
continuing to raise Turkey status within WEU to a legal level 
befitting the contributions it can make, Cetin said: Our goal is 
full membership. We view our current status as temporary. 
  Cetin stated that the main issue to be discussed at the 
meeting, which will also be attended by National Defense 
Minister Mehmet Golhan, is the package being developed on 
relations with Central and East European countries. Cetin will 
leave Luxembourg for Strasbourg on Wednesday where he will 
attend the Council of Europe ministerial committee meeting. He 
will return to Turkey the same day.

  [Text] Ankara--President Suleyman Demirel, who met with 
pro-Kurdish Democracy Party (DEP) Deputy Chairman Remzi Kartal 
within the framework of his talks with political party leaders, 
reportedly told Kartal on Wednesday [4 May] that bloodshed 
should be stopped immediately for the solution of the Kurdish 
issue. 
  Kartal said he told Demirel that the problems which Turkey 
was experiencing were political and would increase. Kartal said 
that the lawsuit against five DEP deputies and an independent 
deputy who were under arrest had not yet been opened, that he 
had mentioned that issue to Demirel and that Demirel was 
disturbed and told him that he would discuss this with Justice 
Minister Seyfi Oktay and take the necessary initiatives. 
  Kartal, who is a deputy from Van, said he told Demirel that 
the Kurdish issue was the source of all the crises in Turkey, 
that Turkey's current crisis was political and would continue to 
escalate, that he and his colleagues had earlier expressed that 
opinion and that the matter should be solved from legal, 
administrative and constitutional aspects. 
  Kartal said he also told Demirel: ``Our party is facing the 
danger of closure. We can solve the matter. We are ready to 
assume all kinds of responsibility. Our party is a chance if 
the country intends to solve the Kurdish matter. 
  ``Closure of the party will block the democratic path. Legal 
changes are needed to be made for the removal of barriers in 
front of freedom of expression and politics. 
  ``This matter cannot be solved with blood; the state cannot 
solve it with arms. They are also the people of this country 
like the policemen or soldiers who are being killed. An unarmed 
and bloodless solution should certainly be put into force.'' 
  Kartal added that he received the impression that at present 
the higher echelons of the state were not taking any action 
regarding the solution of the Kurdish issue.

  [Text] Ankara--Authors, journalists and publishers who have 
been convicted by the State Security Court (DGM) under the Law 
on Combating Terrorism are going to prison one by one after the 
high appeals court's upholding of their sentences. 
  The editor of BELGE publications, Ayse Nur Zarakolu, began 
serving a five-month prison sentence in Bayrampasa Prison in 
Istanbul on Wednesday [4 May]. 
  She was charged and convicted by the DGM for publishing 
Ismail Besikci's book The Program of the Republican 
Peoples Party and the Kurdish Question. 
  In a case concluded at the DGM in Ankara on Wednesday, the 
researcher and author, Ismail Besikci, and the secretary-general 
of the Human Rights Association (IHD), Husnu Ondul, were also 
sentenced to prison. 
  Besikci was given a three-month prison sentence and fined 
250 
million Turkish lira [TL] for an article he wrote called 
"Humanistic Moral Values," which was published in the IHD's 
bulletin. 
  Ondul, who is also the editor of the IHD bulletin, received 
a 
six-month prison sentence and a fine of TL53 million for 
publishing Besikci's article. 
  A book published by the IHD entitled A Section of 
Villages That Have Been Burned Down has also been seized

  [Text] Ankara--Just a day before the first monthly 
anniversary of Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's April 5 austerity 
measures, official sources disclosed the second highest 
inflation figures in the history of the Turkish Republic. 
  Turkey's monthly wholesale inflation soared to 32.8 percent, 
pushing the 12-month rate to 125.3 percent, the second highest 
level since 1939, when Turkey started to produce price indexes. 
The State Institute of Statistics (DIE) revealed on Wednesday 
[4 May] that consumer prices rose 24.7 percent, sending the 
year-on-year consumer inflation rate to 107.4 percent. 
  Back in February 1980, the peak of an economic crisis, 
consumer and wholesale prices had risen by 26.9 percent and 29.3 
percent respectively. The annual rates in February 1980 were 
133.7 percent for consumer and 133.2 percent for wholesale 
prices. 
  Other peak rates are 104.4 in 1946 and 107.2 percent in 
1980. 
  The coalition government's original program target for the 
entire 1994 was an inflation rate of 54 percent. Year-end 
consumer and wholesale price inflation rates were 71.1 and 60.3 
percent in 1993. 
  In March, consumer prices rose 5.2 percent and wholesale 
prices 8.5 percent. They went up 4.4 percent and 2.6 percent 
last year. A dramatic price surge for the month of April was 
expected already. Premier Ciller, as part of her economic 
recovery program, dropped a bombshell of public sector price 
hikes that were followed by the private sector firms. 
  "Several private sector firms have already raised prices by 
more than 100 percent in order to protect themselves from 
inflation and to minimize losses from a shrinking market," 
explained one former Treasury chief. 
  "It is not possible to survive under the circumstances. At 
the end of the year's second quarter, 60 percent of Turkish 
manufacturers will be suffering from payments problems, and at 
the end of the third quarter 90 percent," said Sozer Ozel, 
chairman of the Ankara Chamber of Industry (ASO). 
  He predicted to the TURKISH DAILY NEWS that things would get 
progressively worse in the economy during the rest of the year. 
"There is already a large number of company closures. I do not 
want to talk of the possible picture by the end of the year," 
Ozel said. 
  Some businessmen are remaining calm. 
  "If the correct steps are taken, the Turkish economy could 
overcome the crisis within a month," said Besim Tibuk, chairman 
of the Net Holding company. 
  Economists have been warning of possible stagflation. They 
say three-digit inflation, as expected, could couple with a 
drastic decline in industrial activity, making stagflation 
inevitable in the medium term. 
  ``There has been hardly any economic activity since the 
start 
of the financial crisis this January. We have inflation rates 
above the 100 percent mark. One does not have to be a genius to 
combine these two and conclude that stagflation is in the 
offing,'' said one Ankara professor of economics. 
  ``The important thing is to establish confidence in the 
government's policies,'' Ozer Ertuna, economics professor at 
Bosphorus University and former chief adviser to Ciller, told 
REUTERS. "Bankruptcies will be seen if it cannot be provided." 
Observers say the economy is heading into recession after last 
year's consumer-driven 7.3 percent growth. 
  "Production is declining, prices are rising and consumption 
is falling rapidly. The economy is being dragged into 
stagflation," said Atalay Sahinoglu, chairman of the Istanbul 
Chamber of Commerce (ITO). 
  Three small banks and eight brokerage houses failed last 
month, and some companies in the telecommunications, car and 
textile industries have suspended production. 
  There were reports on Wednesday that Turkey's manufacturing 
industry grew by a negative 1.4 percent in March compared with 
the same period of last year. Capacity utilization in the 
industrial sector is 72 percent. 
  Some economists are still optimistic. 
  "It is normal that prices rise extremely fast in the first 
months of a stabilization program," said Professor Cafer Tayyar 
Sadiklar, former finance minister and the central bank governor. 
He predicted that inflation would fall noticeably in the coming 
months. 
  Opposition politicians were angered by the disclosure of 
inflation figures. 
  Main opposition Motherland Party (ANAP) leader Mesut Yilmaz 
said this was a sign that the economy had gone out of control. 
Republican People's Party (CHP) Chairman Deniz Baykal said that 
Turkey had now entered a period of three-digit inflation 
figures, predicting that the financial crisis would soon turn 
out to be a production crisis, forcing several factories to 
close down. 
  Meanwhile, Turkish financial markets reacted calmly to 
Wednesday's news that the annual inflation had hit three figures. 
  The Istanbul stock exchange index firmed 285.08 points to 
finish at 15,130.98, bringing the two-day recovery to 6.6 
percent following a 37 percent plunge since April 15. The 
Turkish lira firmed to 35,600 to the dollar from 36,200 Tuesday.

  [Text] Ankara-Sanliurfa, May 6 (A.A) -- Murat Karayalcin, 
Social Democratic Populist Party leader and deputy prime 
minister, said today that cooperation among left-wing parties 
for an election had a high chance of realization. 
  He was speaking to journalists on board a plane on his way 
to 
the southeastern city of Sanliurfa. 
  On the cancellation of three mayoral elections in Istanbul, 
of which two were won by the pro-Islamic Prosperity Party, 
Karayalcin said that this decision of the High Election Board 
created an opportunity. 
  He recalled that the board has thus far canceled results of 
15 mayoral elections. 
  `We shall spend efforts, by heeding the calls for the 
unification of social democrats, toward realizing cooperation in 
the left,' he said.

most mayorships, and the main opposition Motherland Party (ANAP) 
topped the elections for borough selectmen. 
  Voter turn out was 29,456,498 out of 31,960,555 registered 
voters. 
  The DYP received 21.44 percent of the vote for city council 
races (1,085 city councilmen), followed by ANAP with 20.99 
percent (744), RP with 19.09 percent (686) and SHP [Social 
Democratic Populist Party] with 13.56 percent (241). 
  In the mayoral elections RP received 22.40 percent of the 
vote winning 28 mayorships, followed by ANAP with 14 mayorships, 
DYP 12, SHP 10, the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) 7, and the 
Republican People's Party (CHP) 5. 
  In the borough representatives elections ANAP received most 
of the votes with 22.75 percent but only 789 borough 
representative posts as compared to the DYP which received 18.96 
percent of vote and 882 borough representative posts, RP with 
18.94 percent and 324 borough representative posts, SHP with 
16.83 percent and 432 borough representative posts. 
  In the election for borough selectmen seats, ANAP finished 
with 22.71 percent of vote and 8,180 seats followed by RP with 
19.13 percent and 4,282 seats, DYP with 18.89 percent and 8,538 
seats, and SHP with 16.80 percent and 4,647. 
  These results are expected to be published in Saturday's 
OFFICIAL GAZETTE.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Shawkat Kazan, "number two" in the </F>
Prosperity Party, by Muwaffaq Madani in Ankara; date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Shawkat Kazan is in his 
sixties, a self-possessed man with a clear view of his party's 
principles. Like Prosperity Party leader Nacmettin Erbakan, he 
has an air of Islamic conservatism tinged with new radicalism. 
  The following discussion took place between myself and 
Kazan: 
  [Madani] What do the recent wins by the Prosperity Party in 
the municipal elections mean to you? 
  [Kazan] The West has brought Turkey to this juncture. Every 
infant draws his first breath in this country with 50 million 
Turkish liras of debts to the West. 
  In the forties we were making weapons. In the fifties, the 
Marshall Plan destroyed our military industries. Without the 
Marshall Plan, we would have been making our own weapons now. 
  He added: They destroyed our ability to work. We needed 
weapons during the Cyprus crisis. When we entered Cyprus, the 
United States imposed an embargo on us and we responded by 
confiscating U.S. bases. Three years passed without us getting 
any assistance. Those were hard times. Then the doors opened 
again and we turned once more to the Western military industry. 
Right now we are using tanks against the Workers Party of 
Kurdistan, but Germany says that we should not be using those 
weapons against the Kurds. However, those are tanks that we 
bought with our own money. 
  He asked: Why is the West afraid of us? The West is always 
working against the Islamic world through NATO, the United 
Nations, the Council of Europe, and other international forums. 
  Muslims constitute one fourth of the world population. Why 
is there not a single Islamic country in the UN Security 
Council? It is only natural and fair that we should have a 
representative in the Security Council. Sometimes, a stray 
Muslim country finds its way into the Security Council, but 
without the right of veto. Therefore, we cannot expect anything 
good to come out of the United Nations in anything that concerns 
us. 
  He added: This is why we call for the establishment of a 
United Nations belonging to the Islamic world. The Islamic 
Conference Organization [ICO] is just a ceremonial forum. I 
wonder what this ICO has done for the Bosnians. 
  I promise you, once the Prosperity Party comes to power, we 
will establish a United Nations. 
  That is not all. An Islamic common market should be formed. 
We do not have to remain dependent on the West. God Almighty 
has given the Islamic countries plenty of resources. Once we 
form an Islamic common market, the European Common Market will 
be a thing of the past. 
  A third point on the Prosperity Party's platform, if it 
reaches power, is the establishment of an joint Islamic defense 
pact, an Islamic NATO. 
  A fourth point is the unification of the Islamic currency, a 
move that would free us of the domination of the U.S. dollar. 
  A fifth point is the establishment of an Islamic UNESCO, a 
cultural union among Islamic countries. 
  This is why the West does not want the Prosperity Party, 
because its accession to power will upset the global balance of 
power. 
  About a week ago, an Israeli bank chairman came to Turkey. 
Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres came today. They told the 
Turkish officials: Whatever financial backing you need we will 
give you, so long as the Prosperity Party does not come to power 
in Turkey. We tell them that these people cannot be bought. 
  [Madani] I have understood from your program that you intend 
to go back to the notion of the Ottoman Empire and the Sublime 
Porte. 
  [Kazan] We will not be an Ottoman state. It had its day, 
and we have ours. We are at the end of the 20th century, and no 
country can stand alone. The same as the West unites to serve 
its interests, the Islamic nation should unite for its own good. 
This is both the logical and the reasonable thing to do. This 
will save us not only in this world, but also in the one to come. 
  [Madani] How do you explain the victory of the Prosperity 
Party? 
  [Kazan] It is natural. Since the seventies we have been 
gaining more votes in every election we enter. In the coming 
elections, we will get more than 35 percent of the votes. The 
gain in votes made us develop the party, the same as it dictated 
that the other parties decline in votes and in popularity. The 
True Path Party and the Motherland Party won about 20 percent of 
the votes in this election, but in the next one they will not 
win more than 15 percent, if that. We could have gotten more 
votes, but the media was very much against us. I hope our 
people will not trust the media from now on. I would like to 
give you an example about the media. The newspaper SABAH, one 
of the most widely circulated papers in Turkey, published 
results of an opinion poll it conducted one day before the 
election. In Istanbul, it expected the Social Democratic 
People's Party to gain 25 percent of the votes and the 
Prosperity Party to gain 16 percent and to rank fourth. In 
Ankara, the paper predicted the Social Democratic People's Party 
to gain 35 percent of the votes and the Prosperity Party to come 
in fourth with 14 percent. We know what the results are and 
what the results of such media was. The other papers were not 
much different. The election was a war between the media organs 
and the people. We have won six central municipalities out of 
15. The total number of municipalities we won throughout Turkey 
is 325. 
  [Madani] Do you expect a collision between you and the 
regime when you try to reach power, as happened in Algeria? 
  [Kazan] Turkey is not Algeria. This is not the first time 
we have won municipal elections. We took over municipalities 
that were billions of liras in debt. Now these same 
municipalities are not one cent in debt. God willing, the same 
will happen in the other municipalities we have taken over, 
which are also in debt. As for the collision you mentioned; 
that is with the Army; there is no separation between the people 
and the Army. The Army is part of this people. The Prosperity 
Party has won in several military areas. There is no conflict 
between the people and the Army. 
  [Madani] But former President Kenan Evren warned the Turkish 
Army and people about you. 
  [Kazan] Evren has become a rich man. He belongs in the 
history museum, and his time is over. He is the last person to 
speak like this because nobody in Turkey listens to him.

<F P=106> [Article signed FDS: "Coalition 10 Percent Below `Black </F>
Sunday' Level -- Dimarso Poll Forecasts European Losses for 
Flemish Socialist Party and Christian People's Party, Gains for 
Flemish Liberal Democrats"] 
  [Text] The Flemish majority parties SP [Flemish Socialist 
Party] and CVP [Christian People's Party] are doing unusually 
poorly. And the PS-PSC [French-speaking Socialist Party-Social 
Christian Party] tandem is doing no better. A good month from 
the European elections, our latest Dimarso opinion poll appears 
deeply disturbing for the sitting coalition: On both sides of 
the language border the Catholic-Socialist partners are looking 
together at another 10 percent loss compared with the end 
results of "Black Sunday," 24 November 1991. 
  Dimarso took a telephone survey of 1,000 Flemish voters, an 
equal number of Walloons and 400 Brussels citizens. The poll 
was taken between 9 and 28 April, a period including the Easter 
holidays during which no polling was carried out. The Antwerp 
BBTK [Socialist Union of Employees] scandal is still affecting 
the SP badly: In April, the Flemish Socialists did not recover 
from the heavy blow they received in our March poll. They even 
dropped a little lower (a statistically insignificant 0.1 
percent) to 15.2 percent. This is more than 4 percent lower 
than the results of November 1991. The CVP stands at 21.5 
percent and has made a 0.5 percent gain from March. But it 
remains a good 5 percent below the previous vote. 
  Taken together, the Flemish majority parties are not doing 
worse than in the previous month, but considerably worse than 
just before the end of last year when the Dehaene government 
started to benefit briefly from its anticrisis policies. 
Immediately afterward, it got lost in scandals. 
  Translated into forecasts for the European elections of 12 
June, then both majority parties would at present lose a 
Strasbourg seat. The forecasts remain somewhat rough and ready, 
because Dimarso is not making any forecasts: "These voter 
intentions must not be interpreted as a prediction, but as a 
thermometer of the political climate," it says. The CVP could 
even lose a second seat in this state of affairs: It is no 
longer certain that outgoing MEP [Member of European Parliament] 
Raf Chanterie, number four on the list, will be reelected. 
  The VLD [Flemish Liberal Democrats] (29.2 percent) are 
remaining gently stationary: They no longer exceed the 30 
percent barrier, but this result would still be enough to get 
them at least two seats in Strasbourg, and give them an outside 
chance of three seats. The possible third extra seat for the 
liberals depends largely on what the VU [People's Union] will do 
on 12 June. The VU (now at 7.4 percent) has gained a good 1.0 
percent from March. 
  The resurrection of ROSSEM is striking: It now stands at 2.9 
percent, or 1 percent more than last month. 
  In parallel with the percentage point gain for ROSSEM, 
Agalev 
[Flemish Greens] has dropped (roughly) one point to 11.7 
percent. If there was no ROSSEM list, then the reallocation of 
these voting intentions could help give the Greens another 
European seat. At least, if this additional seat is not taken 
by the Flemish Bloc. Support for Dillen also dropped by (close 
to) 1 percent, according to our poll, and comes out at around 11 
percent. 
  Then there are the French-speakers. The PS, with 31.6 
percent, is showing a 1.1 percent improvement. But after the 
Agusta scandal, the Carlier affair in Henegouwen also has to be 
digested. The PSC has dropped below 20 percent again to 19.3 
percent, down 1.2 percent. The PRL [Radical Liberal Party] has 
not moved at 23.1 percent. And with 15.8 percent (down 0.1 
percent), nor did Ecolo [French-speaking Greens] manage to beat 
its provisional high point of February. 
  Does that share out the European cards? Perhaps not. The 
success ratio (the relationship between voting intentions and 
potential) of the VLD is close to its ceiling with 60 percent. 
Number 2 on the success ranking, the CVP, could improve from 47 
percent. But not by much: Since last summer, the Christian 
Democrats have not had a success ratio of more than 50 percent. 
Apparently the CVP will be unable to do more than safeguard its 
fourth European seat, one less than it now has. 
  All the other parties can in theory dream of a turnaround, 
according to this political thermometer. For example, the SP is 
getting a share of only 42 percent in the Socialist potential. 
Agalev has no more than 35 percent. And the VU has only 23 
percent. In other words: The market is still wide open for 
them. But attention must be attracted; it is urgent to score 
and time is gradually running out.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel by Ferdos </F>
Forudastan and Charima Reinhardt; place and date not given: 
"Turkey Has a Very Difficult Problem With the Kurds"] 
  [Text] [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] Mr. Kinkel, what else has 
to happen for you to believe that the Turkish Government is 
using German arms against the Kurdish people and for the Federal 
Government to stop arms supplies there once and for all? 
  [Kinkel] We need evidence that the claims about the use of 
German arms are justified. I know you will promptly mention 
pictures allegedly from Kurdistan, which we received from human 
rights activists, church people, and deputies. After 
examination by the Federal Defense Ministry, these pictures do 
not prove these accusations. The tanks, which are said to have 
come from Germany, may have been supplied by Russia, for 
example, and none of the pictures prove the use of those arms 
for internal purposes. 
  [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] Should the Turkish military drive 
dead Kurds on German trucks to the German Embassy in Ankara to 
make you acknowledge that German arms are being used for 
internal conflicts? 
  [Kinkel] The Turkish Government has assured us that it is 
not using any arms provided by Germany against the Kurds. I 
have to trust the correctness of this statement as long as I 
cannot be convinced of the contrary through watertight evidence. 
  [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] Why are you not dispatching any 
Foreign Ministry representatives to Kurdistan as observers? 
  [Kinkel] Turkey is a friendly country, a NATO partner. I 
cannot simply ignore official government declarations and show 
my distrust by sending official investigators there. The 
embassy is acquainting itself with the situation, and I have to 
be able to rely on the Federal Defense Ministry experts in 
Turkey. 
  [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] What is certain is that there are 
heaps of German arms in the military depots in Turkey, making it 
possible for the army to wage this war. Yet, you are sending 
signals to Turkey insinuating that we do not find your policy 
against the Kurds bad enough to suspend arms exports. 
  [Kinkel] I am not signaling anything. Moreover, things are 
not quite as simple as you present them. Turkey has a very 
difficult problem with the Kurds. Unfortunately, it is hardly 
possible to help Turkey solve this problem from the outside. 
This is not only true for Germany. Of course, this must not 
prevent us from insisting again and again on the compliance with 
human rights, and, above all, from pressing for solving the 
Kurdish question by means of the law-governed state. This is 
what I am constantly doing; considering our good relations with 
Turkey, it is not always very easy because it obviously puts a 
strain on our relations. Turkey regards it as interference in 
internal affairs. 
  [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] Has your policy of carefully wagging 
your admonishing finger toward Ankara not failed? Turkey is 
waging the war against the Kurds with increasing brutality. 
  [Kinkel] Turkey is fighting against the terrorist activities 
of the Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK), which we have banned 
here in Germany. It is true that the human rights situation in 
Turkey has unfortunately not improved, but deteriorated. I 
commented on this problem in a recent government declaration. 
Yet, one must also look at the overall situation in the 
country. The government in Ankara is not bringing the problems 
under control. The responsible ministers sometimes obviously 
only have a limited influence on what is going on in police 
prisons in rural Anatolia. The government officials have 
emphasized that they reject human rights violations.... 
  [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] ...and you believe all that: that 
the strong Turkish state is unable to prevent the numerous cases 
of torture of Kurds, of killings by death squadrons; or that, 
meanwhile, the approximately 300,000 soldiers in the southeast 
were only concentrated there to fight against the PKK fighters, 
that the military forces have not destroyed hundreds of Kurdish 
villages and expelled the villagers, sometimes in a most bloody 
way.... 
  [Kinkel] Unfortunately, the German foreign minister does not 
have the possibility to better the world as a deus ex machina, 
much as I would like to. Yet, you must not forget that Ankara 
is also struggling against striving Islamic fundamentalism. In 
such difficult times, one does not leave one's partners in the 
lurch and turn one's back on them or isolate them. With Turkey, 
with which we have been associated through friendly ties for a 
long time, we must keep up friendly dialogue, which includes, of 
course, criticism --at the right moment and in the right way. 
Besides, we must keep in mind that Moelln and Solingen have not 
been forgotten yet. We were unable to protect fellow Turkish 
citizens, children from Moelln and Solingen, against being 
killed by right-wing extremists. I know what I am talking 
about: I stood at the open graves in Turkey. 
  [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] Still, does the Federal Government 
not have to step up its pressure? 
  [Kinkel] Tell me how? 
  [Kinkel] Your could threaten to create difficulties 
regarding the associate membership relations with the European 
Union [EU], think loudly about economic sanctions, or threaten 
to temporary exclude Turkey from NATO. 
  [Kinkel] Excuse me, I am finding all that hardly realistic 
and helpful. When judging a country, we must always take into 
consideration the overall situation in terms of foreign policy. 
Two million Turks live in the FRG, and we have close political, 
economic, and cultural ties with the country, it is a partner in 
NATO, it is located between Europe, on the one hand, and the 
central Asian states and the Islamic world, on the other, and it 
has even gained in importance since the end of the East-West 
confrontation. We have no reason -- and our partners are 
pursuing the same policy -- to end friendly contacts, and we 
cannot do it so easily, either.... 
  [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] ...but you could, at least, threaten 
to do it. 
  [Kinkel] No, not even that. One must be able to carry out 
threats after some time; otherwise, the threats are empty. 
Considering our unlucky history, we Germans, in particular, 
should be careful not to wag our finger too much and make 
exaggerated moral claims. 
  [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] NATO sees itself as a community of 
shared values. Do you still have enough shared values with the 
torture state on the Bosporus to sit in the same alliance? 
  [Kinkel] First of all, your judgment on Turkey is certainly 
inappropriate. Second, Germany is not NATO's master. Third, 
just like economic sanctions, temporary exclusion from NATO 
would dramatically becloud the atmosphere in domestic policy in 
Turkey and lead to a major escalation of the conflict between 
the government and the PKK. 
  [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] Or it would force Ankara to give in. 
How much longer will the Federal Government regard Turkey's 
partnership in NATO, its geostrategic position, and the economic 
ties as being superior to the Kurdish people's right of 
existence? 
  [Kinkel] We do, of course, recognize this right of existence 
and have again and again appealed to our friends in Ankara to 
settle the conflict in the southeast of their country 
peacefully. Let me emphasize once more that, in my capacity as 
German foreign minister, I have virtually no possibility to 
exert any influence on the Kurdish issue. Unfortunately, in the 
sphere of foreign politics, one has to put up with the fact that 
there are problems that cannot be solved at all or are very hard 
to solve. I share your moral-ethical position, but very often I 
do not have the means to translate it into concrete policy. 
Yet, I am not the only one who has this problem. Just look at 
other countries' policies toward Turkey. 
  [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] Would you advise the Turkish 
Government to accept the PKK's offer for talks on a peaceful 
solution of the Kurdish issue? 
  [Kinkel] Of course, I am in favor of a peaceful solution of 
the Kurdish issue. Yet, one also must see that terror emanates 
primarily from the PKK and that thousands of security people had 
to give their lives. So far, the PKK has unfortunately often 
escalated terror when there were signs for agreement. 
  [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] The Turkish Government under Prime 
Minister Tansu Ciller has not yet accepted any PKK offer for 
negotiations. Do you support the demand for an autonomy statute 
for Kurdistan. 
  [Kinkel] The Federal Government supports cultural 
self-administration for the Kurds, but is against changing 
borders. 
  [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] Why do you not propose a CSCE 
conference on the Kurdish question? 
  [Kinkel] I very much like the idea for such a conference. I 
also support the demand to send CSCE monitors to Turkey to get 
firsthand information of the situation there. 
  [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] Should the Kurds living in Germany 
not finally be granted cultural rights? There are 
Turkish-language radio programs and classes in schools, but not 
in Kurdish. 
  [Kinkel] We have about 400,000 Kurdish fellow citizens. 
They have a right to cultivate their language and their 
traditions. We should support them in their efforts.

<F P=106> [Report by Ferdos Forudastan: "Kinkel Urges Turkey To Solve </F>
Kurdish Conflict Politically"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 9 May -- The Christian Democratic Union [CDU] 
has supported Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel's plea to send CSCE 
monitors to Turkey where they could get a first-hand impression 
of the Kurdish conflict. Kinkel had advocated this idea in an 
interview with FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU. On Monday [9 May], a 
Foreign Ministry spokesman said that Kinkel was trying to urge 
Turkey to solve the Kurdish problem politically with the help of 
the CSCE. 
  So far, the Foreign Ministry has consistently rejected 
sending CSCE observers. Sources in the CDU/Christian Social 
Union [CSU] Bundestag Group stated on Monday that Kinkel's 
"surprising change of mind" was "quite sensible." Since human 
rights violations against the Kurds had increased, "something 
has to be done at the international level" now. At the same 
time, it was, of course, "rather sensitive" to express distrust 
toward NATO partner Turkey by calling for observers. The 
government in Ankara denies that Kurds are being tortured and 
killed and expelled from villages in the southeast of the 
country. 
  Sources from the CDU/CSU have meanwhile noted that Ankara 
would be "well advised" not to object to CSCE observation of the 
Kurdish conflict. Rejection would "not cast a favorable light 
on a country that wants to belong to Europe even more closely 
than in the past." Guenther Verheugen, federal manager of the 
Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], told FRANKFURTER 
RUNDSCHAU that he was "most positively surprised" at Kinkel 
taking up the SPD's request for CSCE observers. Now the Federal 
Government must quickly initiate a decisionmaking process in the 
CSCE. 
  Only recently, Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, in a letter to 
the human rights organization, Amnesty International, expressly 
rejected sending CSCE observers to Turkey. This position has 
also been taken by other Foreign Ministry representatives in the 
past few months, who argued that such a measure would be unusual 
in the relationship between NATO partners and would lead to 
confrontation with Turkey.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] France has already evacuated 
1,300 foreigners, including about 250 French people. Two French 
naval ships have been sent to the coast off south Yemen to 
continue the evacuations, which started last Friday [6 May]. It 
seems that there are about 200 French citizens still in Yemen, 
according to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Solveig Rodsgaard: "A Long, Long Election </F>
Campaign"] 
  [Text] The frantic search for big issues has begun. We are 
not accustomed to an ordinary Folketing election that has not 
been called because of an issue. 
  The future of the welfare state is currently the key phrase 
for the campaign. Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen has not 
yet called the Folketing election, of course, and the four 
government parties have not yet decided whether they will 
conduct a joint campaign and what the election platform will be 
if they do. 
  But the ideological tone has been set. The prime minister 
and 
the government will use the possibility of a VKZ 
[Liberal/Conservative/Progress Party] majority as a bogeyman and 
have rejected the new Liberal and Conservative economic 
initiatives for the time being, noting that "the Liberals and 
Conservatives are setting the stage for heavy-handed treatment 
of the weakest groups in society." Naturally the two parties 
indignantly reject that interpretation. 
  In any case it will be a long campaign. Prime Minister 
Rasmussen is still floating the idea that Tuesday, 6 September, 
would be a good election date. But in reality the date has not 
been determined. Government sources say the election will 
probably be held either in September or at the beginning of 
November. If it is held in September the four government parties 
will be bound together by the 1995 budget bill that will be 
presented before the end of August. Moreover, the newly elected 
Folketing could start work on 4 October when the Folketing 
session begins. If the election is held at the beginning of 
November, the four government parties will be bound together by 
both the budget bill and the prime minister's opening address, 
which can be used as a joint election platform. The election 
could then be called in connection with the opening of the 
Folketing. 
  The risk of a long campaign is obvious. Of course the 
government will present some bills and proposals in the months 
ahead, but big reforms will be out of the question. That 
provides a possibility that minor political issues will be blown 
out of proportion and dominate the political picture. This kind 
of debate can be hard to control. For both the government 
parties and the opposition parties. 
  Danish politicians are not used to long election periods 
where a Folketing election is not called until just before the 
end of the four-year term. Usually there are approximately two 
to two and a half years between elections, after which an 
election is called on the basis of a particular issue. On the 
rare occasions when the politicians go through three years of an 
election period they all have their eyes fixed on the coming 
election. That is also the case this time. 
  The prime minister attacked the Liberal and Conservative 
proposals on Wednesday [23 March] after a two-day government 
meeting at the Toruplund conference center near Hundested. At 
the meeting the government agreed on a number of legislative 
initiatives that will be worked out in the months ahead. 
<H5>  Government Proposal </H5>
  The government has presented an action plan, "Focusing on 
the 
Patient." According to the plan, illness prevention will be 
strengthened, waiting periods at hospitals will be reduced, and 
the quality of the health system will be improved. The plan will 
be discussed with the County Council Association and the 
government will not promise more money for the health area in 
advance. 
  Education Minister Ole Vig Jensen will present another plan 
this spring. "Growth in the Universities" is the name of the 
plan, which is aimed at improving the quality of institutions of 
higher education over a 10-year period. 
<H5>  Pension and Cost-of-Living Funds </H5>
  The four government parties have also finally agreed on a 
bill that will enable the wage-earner funds to increase their 
investments in the private business sector. The government will 
give the Labor Market Supplementary Pension Fund (ATP) and the 
Wage Earners' Cost-of-Living Fund (LD) an opportunity to invest 
35 percent of their total capital in stocks compared with the 
current limit of 25 percent. At the same time the limit on how 
much of the capital can be invested in a single firm will be 
raised from 2 to 3 percent on condition that the listed company 
has net capital of over 250 million kroner. The government -- at 
the request of the Radicals in particular -- has decided to 
appoint a committee to investigate how to create more democracy 
in the pension and wage-earner funds and report back by the end 
of 1994. 
  The question of the ATP's and LD's increased investment 
opportunities created political turbulence a few weeks ago when 
Conservative Party leader Hans Engell declared his willingness 
to engage in a debate on the funds. The government responded 
eagerly. But Engell is not satisfied with the government's 
proposal because it does not meet his demand for providing an 
opportunity to pay the LD money to wage earners earlier. Engell 
wants an age limit of 50 years for payment. Liberal political 
spokesman Anders Fogh Rasmussen also rejects the government's 
proposal because it does not support the Liberal demand that 
individual wage earners be given greater freedom to withdraw the 
money. 
<H5>  Conservative Plan </H5>
  All in all the prospect of broad cooperation between the 
government and the opposition looks somewhat dim now that the 
ideological banner on the welfare state has been raised. The 
Liberal tax initiative has been shot full of holes by the 
government, led by Finance Minister Mogens Lykketoft and Tax 
Minister Ole Stavad. 
  On the other hand the finance minister was more conciliatory 
Monday when he commented on the Conservatives' economic 
proposal. But the prime minister's comments after the Toruplund 
meeting were considerably sharper. Apparently the idea of 
driving a government wedge between the Liberals and the 
Conservatives has been abandoned, now it is a question of 
issuing warnings about a VKZ majority. 
  "The Danish Economy Toward the Year 2000 -- Growth and 
Prosperity" is the name of the Conservative plan. According to 
the plan, 160,000 new jobs can be created over the next five 
years, mainly in the private sector. In the labor market area it 
proposes limiting the unemployment compensation period to just 
four years. The level of unemployment benefits would be 80 
percent for all four years, but the maximum benefit would be 
increased so that workers with higher incomes would have better 
coverage in the initial unemployment period. The maximum benefit 
would be 180,000 kroner in the first year of unemployment, 
140,000 in the second, and 110,000 in the third and fourth years. 
  It is precisely this proposal to pay higher unemployment 
benefits to workers who earned higher wages that has been 
sharply rejected by the government, which considers it an attack 
on the weak groups in society. 
  In the longer term the Conservatives also want the 
unemployment benefits system privatized, making the labor market 
factions responsible for the system themselves. There would also 
be no barriers to setting up unemployment funds. The 
Conservative plan calls for abolishing the tax on gross income 
and replacing it with "earmarked insurance contributions" to 
finance unemployment insurance expenses. 
  To create better conditions for private trade and industry 
the proposals include eliminating the tax on capital, dropping 
the CO[.sub]2[/] tax until European Union (EU) rules in this 
area are established, making entertainment expenses fully 
deductible, easing generational succession taxes, providing a 
125-percent tax deduction for research and development costs, 
granting tax exemptions to newly established firms for the first 
three to five years, and eliminating the tax reform's increased 
taxes on stock and property profits and goodwill. 
<H5>  Liberals' Tax Breaks </H5>
  The Liberal tax proposal, which is actually an attack on the 
welfare state, according to the government, operates with the 
possibility of lowering taxes by 5 billion kroner a year for 10 
years, based on the assumption of zero growth in the public 
sector. Liberal tax spokesman Peter Brixtofte is the main person 
behind the tax initiative, which was presented by the Liberal 
Party as a debate proposal. 
  The proposal lists 20 things that would improve the tax 
system, improvements that according to Brixtofte can be started 
as soon as the new government is formed. Brixtofte talks about 
the "new liberal government" in his proposal. In point of fact 
the Conservatives have not felt inspired to offer much comment 
on the tax proposal. Brixtofte, on the other hand, has called 
the Conservative economic proposal both "sensible and 
constructive," noting that it could be unified with the Liberal 
proposal and serve as part of the platform for the future 
coalition government.

<F P=106> [Article including interview with Green Party Secretary </F>
Kjell Dahlstrom by Goran Eriksson; place and date not given: 
"Green Party Wants To Pick Off Green Social Democratic Voters"] 
  [Text] "The Social Democrats are ripe for division. Many 
Social Democratic voters are closer to us than they are to the 
Social Democratic Party [SDP] leadership." 
  Kjell Dahlstrom, secretary of the Green Party, receives us 
in 
the library of the party headquarters at Kristineberg castle on 
Kungsholmen in Stockholm. He regards the percentagewise numerous 
Social Democrats as an overripe fruit, ready for picking. As 
party secretary, Dahlstrom is paid to be an optimist, and his 
confidence before the election is appropriately quite high. 
  "We hold all the cards: the European Union [EU] issue, New 
Democracy is splitting up, and the other small parties are in a 
weak decline, while our curve is pointing upward." 
  He studies the IMU poll, which shows that many who support 
the Green Party, 76 percent, also have a positive attitude 
toward the Social Democrats. Kjell Dahlstrom also says that the 
opposite is true. 
<H5>  Excited Debate </H5>
  "We believe that many of those who say they want to vote for 
the Social Democrats would not be very well served by a Social 
Democratic majority government. It would be devastating; the 
party leadership would take over completely. They would build a 
bridge over Oresund and they would finesse nuclear abolition 
together with the Conservatives and industrial groups." 
  On the other hand, a Social Democratic minority government 
would, it is thought, be forced to take its own voters' green 
values into account. The SDP leadership, which according to the 
Green Party's view of reality is cast in concrete, would be 
forced to listen to the environment- and solidarity-oriented 
party opinion. 
  However, Kjell Dahlstrom is careful not to lock in the party 
as a bloc-tied government base. A heated debate was held before 
the last election on this issue. Now the message is the 
following before a potential return to the Riksdag: cooperation 
on issues of fact, with anyone at all. 
  And the EU question is so good, according to Dahlstrom, that 
it alone should suffice to carry the party into the Riksdag. 
  "Of course it will be an EU election. If the popular 
movement 
parties, the Center and the Social Democrats, think they can 
eliminate the issue from the election campaign, they are wrong." 
  So there. But if the EU issue is to drive hordes of 
Euroskeptics into the Green Party camp, one wonders why it has 
not already done so? So far the effect of the EU question in the 
form of support for the Green Party is negligible. 
<H5>  Political Superstores </H5>
  "It is obvious that the voters have not yet drawn a 
conclusion from their preferences on the EU issue. Further, both 
the Social Democrats and the Center Party have promptly opened 
branch offices for the no vote. Those parties have become 
political superstores: They offer everything." 
  Dahlstrom believes in a quick dividend, however. 
  "The convulsions we could possibly see here in connection 
with their conventions should be quite revealing concerning 
these parties not having a clear opinion about what they want 
for the future." 
  The effect in the mass media in connection with the 
conclusion of the Swedish negotiations in Brussels should also 
soon be converted into beautiful, green percentage units. 
  Experts seem to agree that the election will be about 
employment and the economy. Does anyone dare to vote for 
experimental economic policy from the Green Party? 
  In Dahlstrom's opinion the voters do not regard the party's 
economic policy as a hazard. 
  "Our ideas about shortening the workday, division of labor, 
and changing the tax base are well anchored in the discussion 
today. National economists are discussing these issues -- 
Jacques Delors talks about reducing working hours, and KDS 
[Christian Democratic Party] about changing the tax base." 
  In the election campaign the Green Party will compete with 
the Left Party; the same disaffected Social Democrats are to be 
lured over, to a certain extent with the same bait. But Kjell 
Dahlstrom anticipates that history will set its communist trip 
wire for the left. The Green Party's phase of sectarian battles 
has simultaneously passed through a stage. The party has matured. 
  Now it is just the voters who are missing.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Mohamed Salah Dembri arrived in 
Athens today on a two-day visit during which he will hold talks 
with Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and with Foreign 
Minister Karolos Papoulias, and also with the minister for 
European affairs. Over to Messaoud Boulatiour for more details 
about the visit: 
  [Begin Boulatiour recording] The main focus of the foreign 
minister's visit is the consolidation of cooperation between 
Algeria and the European Union [EU] ahead of the EU's finance 
ministers' meeting due to be held on 16 and 17 May. This 
meeting is expected to examine an EU aid package for projects to 
revive and develop the economy in Algeria, particularly as 
Greece is the current chairman of the Union. 
  Greek sources also said that Mr. Dembri's current visit to 
Greece will enable both sides to discuss the supply of Algerian 
gas to Athens. According to an agreement signed between the two 
countries, in 1996 Algeria will start exporting gas in an amount 
of between $55 and $60 million per year. By then Greece should 
have completed the construction of a pipeline in the Gulf of 
Salamis, southeast of the capital, Athens. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Serdar Turgut: "The United States Has Been </F>
Deceiving the World During the Past Year"] 
  [Text] Washington--The United States has deceived the world 
on the embargo on Iraq during the past year. The U.S. 
Administration has bought diesel oil and kerosene from Iraq and 
distributed them free to the Kurds in the north of the country 
during the past year. A U.S. State Department official said: 
"It is true we have acquired kerosene and diesel oil through 
middlemen in northern Iraq and used them for humanitarian 
purposes. But I do not understand why that surprises you. It 
is not a new development. The operation has been continuing for 
about a year now." 
  The revelation that the United States has violated the 
embargo when it directed pressure on foreign countries and gave 
ultimatums to them to remain committed to the sanctions comes as 
a surprise. Turkey was informed of the operation that has been 
going on during the past year only two weeks ago. The Turkish 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs was informed of the U.S. policy of 
double standards in telegrams from Washington. But the reason 
Turkey has refrained from using the information in its talks 
with the U.S. officials on Iraq's oil remains unanswered. 
  Although it has been revealed that the United States has 
purchased oil from Iraq during the past year, the U.S. 
Administration has been reluctant to admit that the operation 
violates the embargo. It has claimed that the kerosene and 
diesel oil were not directly acquired from Iraq. The officials 
acquired them from Jordanian middlemen who have long been 
transferring oil in tankers from that country. The U.S. 
Administration also claimed that the kerosene and diesel oil 
were used for humanitarian purposes, stressing that the embargo 
has not been violated. The reason they give is that it was not 
sold. 
  Although the U.S. Administration has tried to describe the 
operation as a legitimate move, it has given Iraq an opportunity 
to profit through Jordanian middlemen.

  [Text] Vienna, May 11 (AFP) -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) has asked North Korean experts to visit 
Vienna for talks on replacing fuel rods in a nuclear reactor, 
the Agency announced Wednesday [11 May]. 
  In addition, Agency inspectors would visit North Korea "in 
the next few days" if the replacement of the rods in the Yonbyon 
reactor was postponed, the IAEA said in a statement. 
  U.S. officials say the change of fuel rods could provide 
enough plutonium to make four or five nuclear weapons. 
  The IAEA has been insisting on not only witnessing the fuel 
change but also on sampling the used fuel to determine whether 
the Stalinist country has diverted fissile material for weapons. 
  IAEA Director General Hans Blix proposed to North Korean 
Foreign Minister Kim Young-Nam in a telex message that North 
Korea send a team of experts to Vienna to discuss these measures 
and the timetable for replacement of the rods, the statement 
said. 
  "In the meantime, on the assumption that the core discharge 
is deferred, the IAEA proposes to send an inspection team in the 
next few days." 
  "This team is to carry out the activities which the IAEA was 
not able to implement during the inspection in March at the 
reprocessing plant." 
  Blix reaffirmed in the telex that it was very important to 
take samples from the fuel rods of a five-megawatt nuclear 
reactor at Yongbyon, some 90 kilometers (56 miles) north of 
Pyongyang, to measure their radioactivity levels. 
  But the IAEA chief suggested that the actual testing of the 
fuel rods could be carried out "in the second half of this 
year," a spokesman for South Korea's foreign ministry said in 
Seoul. 
  The Blix message was an answer to the North Korean foreign 
minister's proposal on Friday that Pyongyang could negotiate 
with the IAEA over nuclear inspections and the presence of 
monitors to witness the fuel replacement. 
  The Blix message was made public in Seoul following 
unconfirmed South Korean press reports that Washington had 
agreed to resume high-level talks with North Korea in return for 
the sampling of the fuel rods at a later date. 
  The IAEA also said its team could finish inspecting a 
radiochemical laboratory, from which IAEA inspectors were barred 
by North Koreans last March, and check surveillance equipments 
at various nuclear facilities. 
  In Vienna, IAEA spokesman David Kyd said the inspectors 
could 
leave for North Korea any time from Saturday if the response 
from Pyongyang was positive.

  [Text] Brussels, May 11 (AFP) -- The European Union [EU] 
and Russia have reached agreement in principle on a wide-ranging 
new trade, partnership and cooperation agreement, an EU 
spokesman said here Wednesday [11 May]. 
  He said the accord had been reached by EU Trade Commissioner 
Sir Leon Brittan and Russian Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr 
Shokin. 
  It must still be ratified by the Russian Government and by 
the EU Council of Foreign Ministers which will discuss the 
proposed accord at a meeting here Monday. 
  "The agreement is very ambitious," the spokesman said, 
adding 
that it was much better than a trade accord signed with the old 
Soviet Union in 1989 and could be formally signed within a few 
months. 
  The accord offers Russia the prospect of a free trade area 
with the EU sometime after 1997 if Moscow has made satisfactory 
progress towards a market economy by then. 
  It would immediately give Russia better access for its 
products to the EU market, lead to the abolition of many quotas 
and boost trade in such services as civil engineering, 
consultancies and telecommunications. 
  The agreement includes regular economic and political 
dialogue and meetings at presidential level twice a year. 
  One clause states that respect for democratic principles and 
human rights is an essential element of the partnership. 
  The EU spokesman said the two sides had overcome two 
obstacles -- banking regulations and trade in nuclear fuel -- 
which had held up the accord for about a year. 
  He said Moscow had pledged to exempt five western banks -- 
two Dutch, two French and one German -- from a recent decree 
that foreign banks could not accept deposits from Russians. 
  The five banks were set up in Russia before the decree was 
announced by President Boris Yeltsin last November. The 
spokesman said the restriction would fall away altogether in 
1995. 
  Moscow also pledged to moderate its exports of nuclear 
fuels, 
while the EU will retain the right to act against sudden surges 
of the nuclear imports from Russia until the issue is reviewed 
in 1997. 
  France has opposed inclusion of the nuclear fuel issue in 
the 
accord because it wants to protect its own nuclear industry from 
cut-price Russian competition.

yesterday in a move that signals the development of a policy 
distinct from that of NATO. 
  Foreign and defence ministers of the 10-member Western 
European Union [WEU] signed treaties with Poland, Hungary, the 
Czech and Slovak Republics, Romania, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia 
and Lithuania. 
  The treaties will heighten fears among Euro-sceptics that 
British military policy is following a federalist path. A 
recent defence white paper highlights plans to develop gradually 
Britain's defence policy around the European dimension. 
  Mr Malcolm Rifkind the Defence Secretary, said the evolution 
of an EC defence policy was an "inevitable consequence" of the 
Maastricht Treaty. 
  Efforts would be made at the EC Intergovernmental Conference 
in 1996, which will review and enlarge upon the Treaty, to "look 
at ways in which we might give flesh" to the WEU as the 
"European pillar of a future common defence policy." 
  Although the treaties offer the nine none of the security 
guarantees extended to NATO members, they do get direct 
political links to the West's defences at a higher level than is 
available through NATO. 
  The new partners will attend ambassador-level meetings of 
the 
WEU twice a month and will be invited to participate in WEU 
peacekeeping operations and military manoeuvres. 
  The nine are already members of NATO's Partnership for 
Peace, 
a scheme which will allow them to take part in joint exercises 
with a view to their eventual integration into NATO's command 
structure. But the Partnership arrangement carries no promise of 
NATO membership, unlike WEU associate partner status. 
  Mr Willem van Eekelen, the WEU's Dutch secretary-general, 
said the agreement was a signal that the nine "belong to the 
process of European integration." 
  Herr Volker Ruehe, the German Defence Minister, called it a 
"historic step," and Mr Rifkind said: "European security is 
indivisible. The security of any one country is the security of 
all." 
  The Brussels-based WEU comprises all EC countries except 
Ireland and Denmark, which are not NATO members. Under 
Maastricht, the WEU which was formed in the l94O's, is 
designated as Europe's defence arm but it is only in the last 
few months that it has started to take shape. 
  At present, three European military units, all assigned to 
NATO, are designated as available to the WEU under new 
"re-hatting" procedures. The first of these is the Eurocorps, 
based on the old Franco-German brigade but now including 
soldiers from Belgium, Spain and, soon, Luxembourg. 
  Based in Strasbourg, the Eurocorps is to have about 30,000 
men assigned to it by the end of next year. The nucleus of a 
future European army, Britain has so far refused to assign 
troops to it. 
  The other two units the WEU can call on are both traditional 
NATO elements. They are the UK-Dutch Amphibious Force and the 
Multinational Division Central, part of NATO's Rapid Reaction 
Corps. 
  Britain contributes a brigade to each of these units, and so 
now has 8,000 men theoretically available to the WEU. Mr 
Rifkind said Britain was considering making more military assets 
available to the WEU in the future, though he stressed that no 
request for more had yet been made nor decision taken. 
  So far, the WEU's military activities are limited. It has 
patrols on the Danube looking for sanctions-busting cargo bound 
for Serbia and has ships on patrol in the Adriatic. 
  In addition, it has plans to send military police to Mostar 
to help the European Community's planned administration there. 
  At the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference, the EC's common 
defence policy will be a key subject for discussion. Mr Rifkind 
said that preparations for the conference had already started.

<F P=106> [Report by Luxembourg correspondent Baudouin Bollaert: </F>
"Western European Union Opens Up to East"] 
  [Excerpts] Europe discreetly took its first steps toward 
East European integration yesterday in Luxembourg. The member 
states of the WEU [Western European Union], i.e., the European 
Union [EU] minus Denmark and Ireland, concluded an association 
agreement with six countries of Central and East Europe (Poland, 
Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, and Romania) and 
the three Baltic countries. According to [French Foreign 
Minister] Alain Juppe, this agreement "signals a decisive phase 
in the organization's development." 
  Since the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty, the WEU, 
which is the only European body competent in defense matters, 
has become, if not the "armed wing" of the European Union, then 
at least the embryo of a future common defense and the "European 
pillar" of NATO. With the reinforcement of these nine new 
"associate partners," it will become the only forum for 
discussing the concept of security in Europe without the 
Russians or the Americans. 
  "We emphasized the parallelism of the East European 
countries' membership in the EU and in the WEU," clarified the 
French foreign minister. In other words, their associate 
membership should be seen in the light of their future EU 
membership. [passage omitted] 
  Alain Juppe feels that one must not see either "competition 
" 
or "contradiction" between the Partnership for Peace and the 
agreement signed yesterday in Luxembourg, but rather 
"complementarity." In this respect, [French Defense Minister] 
Francois Leotard emphasized that exercises by the French-German 
brigade together with Polish units this fall in France would be 
placed under the double sponsorship of the Partnership for Peace 
and the WEU. He also recalled that the Groups of Multinational 
Interarmy Forces, which are currently being looked into by NATO, 
may be placed under WEU command, with possible reinforcements 
being provided by troops from the East European countries. This 
did not stop him from recommending that the WEU should develop 
its own capabilities in the areas of "satellite observation, 
intelligence, and strategic mobility." He also revived the idea 
of a French-German armaments agency. 
  So, little by little, the WEU is shedding its anonymity and 
the design of a "Greater Europe" is seeing the light of day 
through enhanced cooperation in security matters. "Saint 
Schuman day [reference to French statesman Robert Schuman] is 
definitely a symbol!," commented one diplomat yesterday.

<F P=106> [Elisabeth Crona report: "Aid for Bosnian Reconstruction"] </F>
  [Text] Reykjavik -- At the same time as the situation in 
Bosnia remains worrying, the Nordic foreign ministers at their 
meeting in Iceland yesterday held concrete talks about life 
after a peace agreement. 
  They discussed practical plans for reconstruction, and 
social 
aid -- something that has never been tried on a large scale 
after a war. 
  Sweden has been making preparations for reconstruction 
through the efforts of a group chaired by Foreign Minister Under 
Secretary of State Lars-Ake Nilsson. The group has been working 
very hard in the last few weeks. 
  The Swedish Government is hoping that there will be a unique 
project involving coexistence, in which new ideas about conflict 
resolution will be tested on the spot. Volunteer organizations 
will play an important role. 
  These are therefore being invited to a seminar in Stockholm 
later this month. The Helsinki committees, the Red Cross, Save 
the Children, and other well-known organizations will take part. 
But new approaches will also be tried. 
  "Perhaps the immigrant organizations in Sweden with their 
special knowledge can help," Foreign Minister Margaretha af 
Ugglas suggested. 
  "If we are to achieve any form of population return to the 
region we have to try to create security, structures, 
surveillance alongside economic aid." 
  Personally af Ugglas is somewhat pessimistic about the 
prospects of peace soon. But the preparatory work for 
reconstruction could in itself have a peace-building effect. It 
could increase the sides' desire to reach a settlement, she said. 
  The Nordic countries are also discussing in concrete terms 
which area they should adopt in particular in Bosnia in the 
event of peace. 
  "For Sweden it is natural to think of the Tuzla region," 
Margaretha af Ugglas said. "That is where the Nordic battalion 
located, and a multicultural society still exists there." 
  A problems for the Nordic area is, however, that it is not 
represented in the top-level meetings on the former Yugoslavia, 
despite the considerable involvement of Nordic troops in Bosnia. 
  That is why Sweden wants to attend the meeting of foreign 
ministers in Geneva on 13 May, which was called by U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev and will be attended by Britain, France, 
and Germany as well as the EU [European Union]. 
  "But since we are not members of the EU or NATO we have some 
difficulty in being admitted to the core consultations, at which 
the political decisions are reached," Foreign Minister af Ugglas 
said. 
  In a joint statement issued after yesterday's meeting, the 
Nordic foreign ministers gave a powerful indication of their 
desire to play a larger political role in the peace negotiations 
on the former Yugoslavia. Among other things, they referred to 
their considerable contribution to UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Forces] and expressed their support for the setting-up of a 
contact group which would, together with the international 
mediators, draft a proposal for a total cease-fire in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  They also proposed that an advisory group, composed of 
countries contributing troops, should be attached to the 
Security Council for every UN operation. 
  Behind the Nordic stance lies a dissatisfaction with the UN 
leadership and with the disagreement between NATO and the United 
Nations.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Lubbers: Confidence in South </F>
Africa's Future"] 
  [Excerpts] Netherlands Prime Minister Lubbers expressed his 
confidence in the future of South Africa yesterday. 
  Lubbers described the election of ANC leader Mandela to 
South 
African president as a moving event "at the start of a wonderful 
future." The outgoing prime minister was speaking at a joyful 
reception at the South African Embassy in The Hague. [passage 
omitted] 
  Lubbers said that "the word apartheid has always been an 
open 
wound in the Netherlands. What could we do about it? From the 
left to the moderate right, there was an agreement: We had to 
do something. Now there is joy in our hearts. We belong 
together. We need no longer feel shame because of that word. 
But all is not achieved today. The world must help South 
Africa to maintain peace. For us too, much remains to be done. 
That is my pledge for the future."

<F P=106> [Article by Mark Kranenburg: "It All Revolves Around the </F>
Color Purple"] 
  [Text] Extreme subtlety. That is what the first stage of 
the government formation is all about. The art for all involved 
is to keep their options open, while the others show their true 
colors. The recommendations to the Queen from the leaders of the 
four principal parties all perfectly respect this approach. The 
job of Tjeenk Willink, charged by the Crown to investigate 
whether a proposed government formation will succeed, is to try 
and read between the lines and, above all, proceed with extreme 
caution. 
  It all in fact revolves around the color purple. The only 
party to clearly come out in favor of a "purple" coalition 
[comprising the PvdA [Labor Party], the D66 [Democrats 66], and 
the VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] is the D66, 
the big election winners. The PvdA and the VVD are not going 
any further for the moment than to say that they do not rule out 
such a coalition. Both of them are also keeping their options 
open to enter into a coalition that includes the CDA [Christian 
Democrat Party]. So far the positions adopted are just as 
inflexible as they were before the election. Tjeenk Willink can 
now try to make them more flexible in order to establish which 
coalition option should be the first to be investigated. In 
other words: Which three parties will be the first to sit down 
at the negotiating table. 
  If that is indeed the PvdA, the VVD and the D66, then it 
will 
be the first time since 1918 that the CDA has not been involved 
in forming a government. But it takes some time and explaining 
to set aside around 75 years of history. This is why it was 
decided to appoint Tjeenk Willink in order to consider which 
coalition possibilities are worth subsequently exploring. His 
mission is limited and he is under no obligation to do very 
much. He must simply consider "which possibilities exist, on 
the basis of the election results, for the formation of a 
government which can count on fruitful cooperation with the 
parliament. He also has to prioritize the coalitions 
possibilities and see what method of investigating offers the 
best prospects of quickly forming such a government." The key 
word here is prioritize. 
  For D66 leader Van Mierlo, this prioritization is clearly 
established. He is the only one to have expressed before the 
elections a clear preference for a coalition consisting of his 
own party together with the PvdA and the VVD. Not out of an 
anti-CDA feeling, as he stressed again yesterday, but because a 
genuine alternative government is in the interests of a healthy 
democracy. But do the other partners needed to form a "purple" 
coalition share this opinion? 
  PvdA leader Kok was still keeping his options open in 
yesterday's recommendation. In any event, he wants a government 
founded upon a "progressive basis." This would have to be 
formed by the PvdA and the D66. Whether or not they should be 
joined by the CDA or the VVD depends on the agreement which can 
be reached on the government program. 
  VVD leader Bolkestein wants his own party and the D66, the 
two election winners, to be included in the new government. 
Whether the third party is to be the CDA or the PvdA would also 
depend for Bolkestein on the agreed government program. Tjeenk 
Willink's job is to bring an end to this policy of awaiting 
developments on the part of the three parties. The 
recommendation from CDA leader Brinkman to the Queen can be of 
help to him [Willink] in this respect. Brinkman stated that the 
first option to be investigated should be the "purple" coalition. 
  If the negotiations between the PvdA, the VVD and the D66 
fail, then the door is open for the CDA to participate in the 
government formation process. But in that case with one trump 
card: The knowledge that a coalition without the CDA is not 
possible. That would be a very strong negotiating position. 
The other parties are fully aware of this, which explains their 
hesitant behavior. 
  Tjeenk Willink's mission is limited. PvdA leader Kok has 
spoken of a "lengthy period of consultation." At some point 
Tjeenk Willink will have to decide whether or not there is any 
point in Kok, Bolkestein, and Van Mierlo sitting down at the 
negotiating table. In fact it is only the first two who are 
really involved. It is well-known for example that Kok and 
Bolkestein have totally different opinions regarding the 
introduction of a basic social security system. Tjeenk Willink 
will probably not be able to avoid investigating whether or not 
they are prepared to come to a compromise on this. How exactly 
they will achieve it is then a matter for the next round of the 
formation process. That is the moment for CDA leader Brinkman 
to start getting worried. And if certain subjects remain 
excluded from any discussion between Kok and Bolkestein, Van 
Mierlo must then assess the situation.

<F P=106> [George Jones article: "Major Leaves Door Open for Europe </F>
Referendum"] 
  [Text] Mr John Major kept open the door to a referendum on 
closer ties with Europe last night as he sought to head off a 
damaging Tory party split ahead of next month's European 
elections. 
  He was responding to pressure from senior back-benchers, 
would-be Euro-rebels and former Cabinet ministers to promise a 
plebiscite before Britain joined a single currency or 
surrendered further powers to Brussels. 
  After a day of hurried consultations in Downing Street and 
Conservative Party headquarters, the Government's hard line 
against a referendum appeared to be softening. Party officials 
said that, while Mr Major's personal view was still against a 
referendum, the door was not "locked and bolted." 
  Tory MPs had earlier voiced their concern that Mr Paddy 
Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, had seized the initiative 
in the forthcoming Euro-elections campaign by revealing that a 
pledge to hold a referendum on closer European integration would 
be included in his party's manifesto. 
  Mr Norman Lamont, the former Chancellor who has emerged as a 
potential leader of the Conservative Euro-sceptics, called on Mr 
Major to follow suit and agree to allowing the people, rather 
than Parliament, the final say if there was any further 
"significant" erosion of British sovereignty by Brussels. 
  He said a referendum was now inevitable as it was the only 
way to resolve the argument over Europe. Otherwise Europe would 
continue to split the Conservative Party. 
  "There are two wings of the Conservative Party which have 
different views on this. This is contributing to John Major's 
personal difficulties, and one way out of this is for him to put 
this issue to the people as was done in 1975," said Mr Lamont. 
  There was also support for a referendum from the Left of the 
party. Mr Peter Temple-Morris, Conservative MP for Leominster 
and a supporter of Mr Michael Heseltine, President of the Board 
of Trade, said: "We may well have to keep the option open of 
having a referendum in connection with 1996 (date of the next EC 
summit), either before the intergovernmental conference, on the 
basis of what we go there with, or on the basis of what we come 
back with." 
  But Mr Bill Cash, MP for Stafford and leader of the 
Maastricht rebels, said that if there was to be a referendum it 
should be as soon as possible after the European elections. The 
question could be simply: "Do you want a federal Europe?" 
  At Westminster it was clear that many mainstream Tory MPs 
believed that the promise of a referendum could help to paper 
over the Tory Party's divisions on Europe in the run-up to the 
June 9 elections. 
  But the difficulties faced by Mr Major were underlined when 
the Positive European Group of Tory MPs voiced strong opposition 
to any move by the Government to back a plebiscite. One member 
of the group said: "It is a bad idea and would create disunity, 
pitting part of the Conservative Party against the other in an 
official campaign." 
  Lady Chalker, the Foreign Office Minister of State, 
underlined the tensions in the party when, in the Lords, she 
launched a strong attack on Euro-sceptics for seeking to 
undermine the position of Mr Major. 
  "I really don't believe that the question of a referendum on 
European matters arises now, and therefore it doesn't need any 
decision now," she said. 
  But by last night it was clear that Mr Major was anxious not 
to close off the referendum option. While a single currency 
remained highly improbable and was not likely in any event 
before the end of this century, "we are not saying never on a 
referendum," said one senior aide. 
  Mr John MacGregor, the Transport Secretary, told a meeting 
in 
Norwich: "It would be economic madness to contemplate any 
possibility that the UK could withdraw (from Europe), be 
isolated or be marginalised. Any moves or suggestions that we 
may wish to withdraw or isolate ourselves could have a 
disastrous effect on our economic prospects and on jobs." 
  Mr Ashdown campaigning in Truro, said: "We are about to see 
a re-run of the Tories' Maastricht muddle -- a struggling Prime 
Minister held at clubpoint by a bunch of Euro-cavemen."

  [Text] London, 10 May (EFE) -- The councilmen of the 
Malvinas Government have asked Senator Eduardo Menem, Argentine 
President Carlos Menem's brother, to get Argentina to renounce 
its sovereignty claim over the South Atlantic islands and accept 
the islanders' "right to exist as Argentina's neighbor." 
  The councilmen wrote to John Ward, the British 
representative 
to the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) on 9 May. The letter 
appeared in the local press on 10 May. In their letter, the 
councilmen disagree with Eduardo Menem's position at the IPU 
meeting in Paris from 21 through 25 March. 
  They criticize Eduardo Menem for having ignored, at this 
meeting, "the rights and position of the people who live on the 
lands being claimed" -- alluding to the Malvinas Islands. 
  "We urge Senator Eduardo Menem to abandon the expansionistic 
and chauvinistic rhetoric that previous Argentine 
administrations have felt compelled to instill in the 
educational system and in everyday life; we also urge him to 
renounce his claim over our fatherland and to accept our right 
to exist as his neighbors," the letter states. 
  The islanders reaffirm that they are not "threatening 
Argentina," and ask to be allowed to "decide our future and live 
without worries of foreign threats against the land on which our 
ancestors settled." 
  The Malvinas councilmen reiterate the islanders' position 
that while Argentina claims sovereignty over the Malvinas 
Islands, Argentine citizens will not be allowed to set foot on 
the islands. 
  The councilmen indicate that the islanders are prepared to 
consider exploiting oil jointly with Argentina, provided this 
rapprochement will not be used to apply political pressure.

outside the 200 mile limit on the east coast. 
  The minister of fisheries, Brian Tobin, presented 
legislation 
in the House of Commons today to protect the Grand Banks. If 
passed by parliament the law would allow fisheries officers to 
board foreign ships, search them, and bring them back to a 
Canadian port to face charges. Fines could reach a million 
dollars. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Canada's minister of fisheries, Brian Tobin, is 
expected to present some tough measures today aimed at stopping 
foreign overfishing off Canada's east coast. The minister is 
expected to announce a plan that would allow Canada to make 
arrests, levy fines, and confiscate vessels and fish catches of 
crews who break the law by taking cod. 
  Overfishing by both foreign and domestic fleets is blamed 
for 
the near-extinction of northern cod and serious depletion of 
other bottom dwelling fish in Canadian east coast waters. Mr. 
Tobin is particularly upset about those foreign trawlers which 
continue to catch tonnes of undersized cod while thousands of 
Canadian fishermen and plant workers are paid not to fish in 
Canadian waters.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Federal President Richard von 
Weizsaecker has called for a "merging" of German and Russian 
interests. This ought also to benefit neighboring countries, 
Weizsaecker said at a luncheon in Bonn today in honor of Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin. The Federal Republic's firm 
integration in NATO and the European Union is an important 
prerequisite for the success of this path. [as received] 
  The federal president stressed that the growing integration 
of the Russian Federation into the European and international 
institutions is equally important for Germans. The countries 
located between Germany and Russia should also be included in 
this process in a trusting way. 
  Weizsaecker described Russia as "a great nation." The 
Germans have themselves been able to experience this and are 
grateful to Russia. The federal president added: "How else 
would the regaining of state unity have been possible for us in 
freedom?" With this, the Russian people have not only 
demonstrated their magnanimity but had also "shown far-sighted 
trust in the common future of our peoples." 
  We now have to prove ourselves worthy of this strength and 
shoulder the tasks facing us responsibly and with optimism. 
Weizsaecker stressed: "For me it is one of the miracles of 
history that the suffering Hitler inflicted on Russia could not 
destroy the deep inner relationship between Germans and 
Russians." 
  The German president stressed that the opportunities 
currently available are "historically unprecedented." They 
would not exist without the persistence and strength of the 
Russian people, nor without the desire for reform and personal 
courage of Yeltsin. Addressing the Russian president, 
Weizsaecker added: "The images of August 1991, when you risked 
your life to resist force and fought for free human rights, 
became documents of world history and will remain for posterity 
an example of what the actions and convictions of an individual 
can achieve."

<F P=106> ["hal"-signed report: "Yeltsin Visit: Economy on the </F>
Agenda"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 10 May -- It seems that Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin does not want to discuss problems concerning 
German-Russian economic relations during his three-day German 
visit that starts this Wednesday [11 May]. In any case, there 
is no comprehensive round of talks with representatives of 
German industry on such critical issues as Russian taxation or 
crime on the agenda. Even so, Economic Minister Guenter Rexrodt 
would like to raise the subject of taxation problems and ways of 
improving the conditions for investments, which include the 
delivery of railroad carriages for the Russian state railroad 
and the construction of a machine plant in Kamas. 
  The Economics Ministry in Bonn says that despite its 
difficult situation, Russia remains an important economic 
partner for Germany. Business with the East continues to be 
important, especially for the new laender, which exported 53 
percent of their output to Russia in 1993. Total German exports 
to Russia amounted to 11.4 billion marks [DM], and imports from 
Russia amounted to DM10.7 billion. According to the ministry, 
last year's collapse in trade between Russia and Germany has not 
continued any further. Between 1990 and 1992, trade between the 
two countries fell by almost one-half. 
  All in all, the Eastern Committee of German Industry 
considers the development of trade with East Europe and the 
post-Soviet republics as positive, despite all the difficulties. 
The increase in Russian import duties in 1994 will probably 
have a bearing on exports of microelectronic components, 
electric home entertainment equipment, and cars. It is not yet 
known to what extent general trade will be affected. All the 
same, Russia has relaxed its tough import restrictions, a move 
that affects the traditionally most important sectors of Russian 
trade -- machine and equipment construction, says the Economics 
Ministry.

<F P=106> ["uhl"-signed report: "Rexrodt Sees Favorable Signs in </F>
Industrial Research in East"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 9 May -- At the 21st meeting on the economic 
situation in the new laender with leading industry and trade 
union representatives, Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl expressed 
concern about the decrease of employees in the research 
departments of eastern German industry. However, Kohl commented 
favorably on the economic development in the new laender. 
  "With the coming of spring," he said, "the climate for a new 
upswing in Germany has also become warmer." He added that in 
1994, an investment quota would be reached there that had not 
even been reached in the old republic during the years of the 
so-called economic miracle. According to the chancellor, 
housing construction is one of the "particularly gratifying 
chapters" of the catching-up process in the new laender. He 
said that this year, investment in housing construction per head 
of the population would exceed the western German level by 
approximately 10 percent. There had been an "incredible 
increase" in building permissions to approximately 100,000. 
Federal Construction Minister Irmgard Schwaetzer (Free 
Democratic Party -- FDP) said that housing construction in 
eastern Germany had changed "from a problem child to an economic 
driving force." This year, 70,000 new apartments will be built 
in the new laender, compared with 23,611 in 1993. 
  Federal Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt (FDP) said that 
the productivity of eastern German industry had also made 
considerable progress. In the manufacturing sector, for 
instance, it had, in 1993, exceeded the result reached in 1991 
by 110 percent. Of course, the serious decrease in employment 
had played a central role in this respect. 
  Owing to the high investment dynamism and the Trust Agency's 
successful privatization work, modernization had not remained a 
passive operation, said Rexrodt. Nonetheless, there were still 
"very many difficult cases." Rexrodt mentioned as examples Eko, 
DWA, and Wolfen. This year, the number of unemployed in the new 
laender would on the whole increase relatively slightly, by 
approximately 100,000. 
  German Industry Federation (BDI) President Tyll Necker 
called 
upon the state, employers and trade unions, and industry to 
concentrate the tight funds on the strengthening of production 
forces in eastern Germany. "Let us not be deceived by the 
improved number of orders, about the economic situation, which 
continues to be very unstable, above all in the eastern German 
medium-sized sector, and let us not forget the very bad starting 
position." Moreover, according to the example of Section 16 of 
the former Law on Aid for Berlin, ways should be found to 
channel private capital through banks into productive companies 
in the new laender, said Necker. 
  Kohl voiced concern about the considerable decline in the 
number of employees in research and development departments in 
the eastern German industry. He said research and development 
should be given better opportunities. For this purpose, the 
Federal Government had appropriated approximately 2.4 billion 
German marks [DM] in the new laender since 1991. The share of 
federal subsidies in the companies' research expenditures was 
thus about eight times as high as it was in the old laender, 
Kohl said. 
  In a report on eastern German industry research that Rexrodt 
and Federal Research Minister Paul Krueger (Christian Democratic 
Union) submitted at the economic meeting, "favorable signs" are 
noted for the first time, "despite the difficult overall 
situation." According to this report, the shrinking process has 
clearly decelerated at a low level [as published]. According to 
estimates, between 2,500 and 2,700 production companies are 
currently dealing with research and development. Small- and 
medium-sized companies already stabilized their respective 
activities in 1992. 
  They also stress in the report that companies in eastern 
Germany make larger efforts than those in the west to reduce 
costs by way of process innovation. However, these efforts are 
often oriented toward the imitation of competitive products and 
at the national market in particular. Since it is more 
difficult than expected to develop an efficient research and 
development in eastern Germany, the Federal Government will 
continue to increasingly appropriate funds over the medium term. 
While the Federal Government spent approximately DM315 million 
for this in 1991, it spent as much as approximately DM690 
million in 1993. This year, an increase to approximately DM740 
million is envisaged. 
  Craft Industry Federation President Heribert Spaeth said 
that 
the craft industry would make new training efforts. He said, 
however, that a large common effort of industry as a whole was 
required to guarantee an adequate supply of apprenticeships in 
the new laender in 1994. Roland Issen, chairman of the German 
Union of White Collar Workers (DAG), reiterated his demand that 
training be financed in part by firms, because firms in eastern 
and western Germany increasingly dodged their training 
obligation. 
  Employers' Federation President Klaus Murmann called upon 
his 
colleagues and entrepreneurs to give the new generations in 
their companies the prospect of a thorough vocational training. 
Murmann deplored the fact that in the new laender, too, 
training places in offices and the service sector are favored, 
whereas training places in production and technical areas often 
cannot be filled.

<F P=106> [Ulrich Rosenbaum report: "SPD Seeks Contacts With the </F>
Economy"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- The Social Democratic Party of Germany 
[SPD] presented a "memorandum for innovation policy in Germany" 
yesterday, in which a "market-oriented industrial policy" was 
announced for the event of an SPD election victory. The 
document that was drafted by party leader Scharping and his 
"shadow ministers" Oskar Lafontaine and Peter Glotz represents a 
departure from the SPD's former ideas of a research that is 
independent of the economy. 
  The memorandum explicitly states that the economy should be 
granted "more influence on the priorities" in large research 
institutions. The state and the economy are not living in 
different worlds, and competition requires a "new understanding 
of the industry" and "coordination and concerted economic 
efforts by the economy and the state." 
  Glotz, who is responsible for research, education, and media 
for Scharping's team, announced that, after an election victory, 
the SPD wants to introduce regular talks between the economy and 
the state similar to the ones of the Clinton-Gore 
Administration. Independent advisers should participate. The 
document that was presented was also prepared after talks with 
all major organizations in the sphere of science and economy, 
Glotz pointed out. The SPD criticized the decline of the 
research budget, which was still 2.8 percent of the entire 
budget under Helmut Schmidt, and which has now dropped to below 
2 percent. Yesterday Scharping described this as a "serious 
mistake in the field of economy and research" which has weakened 
Germany's attractiveness as an economic base. The research 
budget lacks a "consistent industrial orientation that would 
make the goal of winning new growth markets over the medium term 
realistic," the document reads. Referring to the nomination of 
new ministers for research and education -- Minister Krueger 
(Christian Democratic Union) and Minister Laermann (Free 
Democratic Party of Germany), the SPD criticized that the 
government considers these areas as "switchyards of secondary 
importance." Scharping spoke of a "respectable but 
unprofessional research minister." 
  Within the framework of its investment program, the SPD 
wants 
to promote particularly the medium-sized enterprises. Thus, 
risk capital is to be provided for young and capital-intensive 
technological enterprises. Tax privileges for future-oriented 
investments are to be introduced, and permit procedures are to 
be shortened. Germany needs a "new period of promoterism," 
Glotz stated. 
  The SPD called on the present government to go back on its 
decision to cut the research budget by 250 million German marks 
[DM] and to increase the funds for research and the construction 
of universities in the new laender. If the government should 
not comply with this wish, an SPD-led government will adopt 
these measures. Scharping stated that another billion marks for 
future- oriented research should not be a problem in view of a 
total budget of DM480 billion.

<F P=106> ["jsc"-attributed commentary: "The `Finlandization' of </F>
NATO"] 
  [Text] When NATO formulated its Partnership for Peace 
offer, it never thought of Sweden or Finland. And yet these two 
countries have seized the opportunity and joined the 
Partnership, thus taking a step that would have been 
unimaginable a few years ago. 
  From the Finnish angle, this move no longer seems 
spectacular 
because Helsinki abandoned the concept of neutrality that it 
felt obliged to pursue because of the Soviet Union's proximity a 
long time ago. At that time, the Finns' freedom of decision 
only went as far as the border of Soviet interests. At the same 
time, by doing business with the Soviets, Finland developed into 
one of the most prosperous nations in Europe. Today, Finland is 
struggling with its worst industrial crisis for decades. The 
Finns are seeking a way out of this crisis by orientating 
themselves westward. 
  On the other hand, Sweden's policy of neutrality was not 
created out of necessity, but out of a conviction that this was 
the only correct path to take. Neutrality was Sweden's second 
pillar, the first being the welfare state. Many Swedes still 
recall proudly that neutrality protected the country against war 
for hundreds of years. But today there is not enough money to 
maintain the Army, so the Swedish military is pleading for 
closer links with NATO. Neutrality, too, has lost its purpose 
since the end of the Cold War. The welfare state has already 
shrunk, and now Sweden is bidding farewell to its second 
fundamental principle. It is to be expected that Sweden will 
gradually abandon its neutrality for the purpose of joining NATO.

<F P=106> ["g-n"-signed editorial: "Formal Address"] </F>
  [Text] Russia, President Yeltsin said at the Moscow 
celebrations marking the anniversary of Germany's surrender in 
1945, wants to be addressed in a formal manner. It demands 
respect. Russia is extremely sensitive to what it calls its 
dignity. Moscow's new tone does not go very well with Yeltsin's 
wish to expand the partnership with the West. 
  Since signing the Two-Plus-Four Treaty in 1990, no other 
country has given more economic aid to Gorbachev's Soviet Union 
and Yeltsin's Russia than Germany. By refusing to support the 
Honecker regime, Soviet policy in the Gorbachev era admittedly 
contributed to Germany's peaceful reunification. But with 
Russian diplomats talking like that, one must not forget that 
Soviet policy alone forced the SED [Socialist Unity Party of 
Germany] regime upon East Germans, established the division, and 
maintained it for four decades, not to mention Stalin's pact 
with Hitler, which opened the door to war for the German 
dictator. Thus, the two days of Hitler's surrender are also 
two-sided: 8 May was the end of a totalitarian dictatorship for 
the Germans in the West, and 9 May was the beginning of another 
one for the Germans in the East. 
  But how should the withdrawal of the Russian troops be 
celebrated? The Western allies are only withdrawing from 
Berlin; they will stay in the country as friends. The Russian 
Army will withdraw, and this enables voluntary cooperation. The 
Russian soldiers have a right to a polite farewell with all the 
usual military ceremonies. To demand more, such as a joint 
ceremony in Berlin together with the Americans, British, and 
French would invite a comparison of their roles in Germany, an 
exercise in which Russia cannot win. To insist on something 
special would turn out to be a self-made trap, from which the 
Russian leadership could hardly withdraw without hurting its 
sensitive need for dignity. This way it risks losing the very 
thing it wants to have: a polite farewell, formal, respectful, 
addressed in a formal manner.

<F P=106> [Report signed "R.C.": "European Elections: Delors' Anger"] </F>
  [Text] Jacques Delors intended to be discreet. He said he 
wanted to observe a reserved attitude as president of the 
European Commission during the French European election 
campaign. During the presentation of Europe Day at the Odeon 
yesterday, organized by the European Movement, the outgoing 
Commission president nonetheless seized the opportunity to 
express his "anger" and "disappointment" at the "timidity" of 
the pro-Europeans who do not dare "admit" that "the European 
idea transcends political divisions." On the other hand, the 
anti-Europeans are much more aggressive, producing numerous 
"glaring inaccuracies" and spouting "nonsense" about Brussels. 
This lack of combativeness in France among those who claim to 
believe in Europe is, in his opinion, unique in Europe: "There 
is not a single country in the rest of the European Union in 
which things are going as they are in France." 
  What about the European crisis? At most, it is "a crisis of 
growth" but not a "regression." He also warned those who, 
"forgetting the past," run the risk of new "wars of religion." 
And yet, the example of Bosnia proves, he thinks, that Europe 
is less protected than ever from a tragic "confusion between 
ethnic group and nation." As for the Maastricht Treaty, it did 
not take account of the reservations expressed by the 
Commission. A treaty which he nonetheless defended in 
retrospect because "Europe's progress was at stake."

  [Text] In an interview given to the French daily 
AUJOURD'HUI, on the day before the assassination of two French 
nationals, Algerian Prime Minister Mokdad Sifi has launched an 
appeal to France. It is in France's interests to help Algeria, 
he says, for if Algeria were to experience serious long-term 
difficulties, this would have an impact on the Maghreb and on 
France. Everything which affects Algeria affects France too, he 
added, stressing also that relations between the two countries 
are now without difficulties.

<F P=106> [Report by Paul Cambon: "General Zeroual Deadlocked"] </F>
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Algerian Finance Minister Ahmed 
Benbitour arrived in Paris on Sunday [8 May]. He had talks 
yesterday with Edmond Alphandery, his French counterpart, and 
was the guest at a dinner given by the treasury chief, who is 
also chairman of the Paris Club. He is due to continue his tour 
in Brussels, London, Washington, and Tokyo. His aim is to 
prepare for his country's appearance before the Paris Club, 
probably at the end of May, with the aim of rescheduling 
Algeria's debt, which is estimated to be around $26 billion. 
The appearance before the Paris Club is now possible because 
Algiers signed its letter of intent with the IMF on 10 April, 
making provision in particular for a 40-percent devaluation of 
the dinar, the elimination of some subsidies on basic products, 
the liberalization of foreign trade, and the autonomous 
management of public enterprises. 
  This agreement still has to be ratified by the IMF. In 
financial circles, it is estimated that this point should 
shortly be settled, thus opening the doors of the Paris Club. It 
is only after the rescheduling of the debt that Algeria can rely 
on bilateral or multilateral financial support. France could 
extend an agreement totaling 6.3 billion francs for 1994, like 
the one which was granted in 1993. 
  The European Union is due to release ECU150 million, the 
residue of a package of ECU400 million granted in 1991. The 
decision in principle to release this money was made on 16 
April. This should be implemented technically on 16 May during 
the council meeting of the Twelve's economy and finance 
ministers. On the same day, the Commission should make 
complementary proposals regarding financial aid.

<F P=106> [Report by Gilles Millet report: "Two French Clerics </F>
Assassinated in Algiers Yesterday"] 
  [Excerpts] It is clear that those who assassinated Henri 
Verges, aged 64, and his sister Paule-Helene Saint-Raymond, 67, 
in the Algiers Casbah yesterday do not believe in "dialogue" 
between the authorities and the fundamentalists, which was being 
defended by some 20,000 demonstrators on the other side of the 
city. They wanted to indicate in a violent way that the Islamic 
Armed Resistance cannot be brought down by repression, which is 
particularly harsh at this moment, nor by the "national 
reconciliation" advocated by head of state Liamine Zeroual. 
[passage omitted] 
  The [French] Foreign Ministry has condemned "this odious 
crime" and has reissued a warning to the remaining 3,000 or so 
French citizens in Algeria to return to France (some 5,000 have 
already left the country). Government Spokesman Nicolas Sarkozy 
stated that "Today, Algeria is one of the prime minister's 
primary concerns."

  [Text] Paris, May 9 (AFP) -- French customs officials 
arrested an Algerian man in possession of a cache of weapons and 
explosives that he allegedly planned to pass on to Islamic 
fundamentalists in his country, sources said Monday [9 May]. 
  Abdel Hakim Boutrif, 34, was stopped at toll booth Friday in 
Meurthe-et-Moselle in northeastern France after entering the 
country from Germany, the sources said. 
  He was transfered to Paris where he was held for questioning 
by anti-terrorist police. He was to appear before the Paris 
prosecutor's office Tuesday. 
  In Boutrif's car customs officers found 129 100-gram 
(3.5-ounce) sticks of explosives, 99 detonators, 5,000 rounds of 
ammunition, three automatic pistols, one assault rifle, four 
sets of night vision goggles, three scanners and 14 
transmitter-receivers. 
  Police said Boutrif, who is married and lives in a Paris 
suburb, was making his second trip to Algeria after having 
loaded up his car with weapons in Germany. He was planning to 
drive down through France, Spain and Morocco to Algeria, 
apparently to deliver the cache to Islamic fundamentalists, the 
police said. 
  Sympathisers of the Islamic Salvation Front, which is 
currently waging low-level civil war against Algeria's 
military-dominated government, have been arrested on three 
separate occasions in France in recent months, charged with 
possession of weapons and false papers.

  [Text] Let's go to Guido Dell'Acquila at the parliament 
building in order to get the first political reactions to the 
government list. 
  [Dell'Acquila] Even before the list of ministers was 
officially released, Roberto Maroni from the Northern League 
agreed to comment on his appointment as interior minister. He 
said that it was not a victory for the Northern League, but one 
for the entire ruling coalition. He added that the Northern 
League had asked for those ministries which were essential to 
carry out its plan for reform. 
  Gianfranco Fini, leader of the National Alliance, said that 
the Berlusconi government signals the end of the First Republic 
and the beginning of an ideological swing to the right. He 
added that the government's priority objectives are the relaunch 
of the economy and social solidarity. 
  The comments of Achille Occhetto, secretary of the Party of 
the Democratic Left, were scathing. He said that the contents 
of the letter which President Scalfaro sent to Silvio Berlusconi 
revealed that the country's democracy has reached an alarming 
state and its safeguarding -- as underlined by Scalfaro -- 
should not be consigned to the vacuous reassurances of 
Berlusconi, but to permanent vigilance. 
  That's all for now.

  [Text] The president's office has released details of a 
letter sent to Silvio Berlusconi yesterday, in which President 
Oscar Luigi Scalfaro draws the prime minister's attention to 
certain problems "where a lack of a solution" could "cause 
problems for the Italian Republic both inside and outside its 
borders." 
  Scalfaro writes that it is about giving assurances: 1. that 
there will be complete faithfulness to the alliances of our 
foreign policy; 2. that the person in charge of the Interior 
Ministry will not take up stances which are contrary to the 
principles of national unity; and 3. that the principles of 
social solidarity will be respected.

This was how Silvio Berlusconi replied to a letter sent to him

Berlusconi writes, "that none of the persons who are being

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "There Is No Fascist Danger"] </F>
  [Text] Rome -- Foreign concern at the presence of 
"neofascists" in the government "results from a distorted image 
which our country is conveying of itself abroad. The fear 
others have of us is our own fault." This is the opinion of 
CNEL [National Council for Economy and Labor] Chairman Giuseppe 
De Rita, who believes that "it is absurd to think that extremist 
movements of the [German] Republikaner type are making any 
headway in our country. Those who judge us from the outside 
have misinterpreted [National Alliance Secretary] Gianfranco 
Fini's attempts to constitutionalize the Right. The way that 
information has been presented in the Italian media has resulted 
in an element of distortion of reality. The picture that 
foreign countries have of Italy is precisely that which our 
national press and television networks have transmitted across 
the borders. It makes no sense," De Rita added, "to speak of a 
return of fascism, when only 1 percent of Italians profess to be 
fascists." Furthermore, in this period "we are witnessing an 
impoverishment of the middle stratum of the ruling class. There 
are increasingly fewer people who are prepared to take an 
interest in politics. The new government is having to `scratch 
about' more than the previous one. [Clean Hands Judge] Di Pietro 
himself has declined [Prime Minister-Designate] Berlusconi's 
invitation. Why should he have joined the Viminale's [Interior 
Ministry] bureaucracy considering that he enjoys much more 
autonomy conducting investigations, and that he is more popular 
than [Mayor] Giuliani in New York?"

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Lentini Case: Borrelli Denies </F>
Rumors: No Investigation Notice for Berlusconi"] 
  [Text] Rome -- Milan's district attorney, Francesco Saverio 
Borrelli, yesterday denied the rumors that Prime 
Minister-designate Silvio Berlusconi is the subject of an 
investigation notice within the context of the inquiry into 
Milan soccer club's purchase of Turin player Gianluigi Lentini. 
Over the past few days there have been rumors of Berlusconi's 
involvement in a deal that prompted the Milan District Attorney 
to consider bringing charges of fraudulent accounting against 
the club's manager, Adriano Galliani. Yesterday these rumors, 
originating from political circles, reappeared, and were 
promptly followed by a denial, first from a deputy prosecuting 
attorney who is dealing with the case, Francesco Greco, and then 
officially, from Borrelli himself. 
  Wednesday afternoon [4 May] Galliani, Milan's manager, who 
is 
under investigation in connection with the Lentini case, was 
questioned for an hour and a half by [Judges] Di Pietro, 
Colombo, Greco, and Davigo. Galliani opted not to answer. The 
affair in which he is implicated stems from the purchase of the 
player, Lentini, whom Turin sold to Milan for the astronomical 
fee of 16.5 billion lire, according to the contract deposited 
with the Soccer League, though it seems that considerably more 
than that was paid secretly. Colombo dealt with the matter 
first; his suspicions were aroused by 6.5 billion lire paid from 
abroad. Part of the money came via Switzerland to Borsano, a 
Socialist deputy from Turin. The rumors of Berlusconi's 
involvement stem from the fact that he has a legal obligation to 
monitor any possible irregularities.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Beppe Severgnini: "How They Will See Us in </F>
America"] 
  [Text] Over the last few months there has been much 
discussion as to how the world would react to "a Berlusconi 
government." However, the assessments often revealed what the 
English call wishful thinking. To all effects and purposes, 
many confused their own hopes with reality: The supporters of 
the "new Right" gave assurances that the government would be 
welcomed everywhere, while those who had no liking for it 
forecast years of embarrassment and ostracism for Italy. 
  Now that the Berlusconi government is no longer a mere 
hypothesis, the question arises once again. How will the new 
Italian government be received abroad, and in the United States 
in particular? The following are five scenarios, unencumbered 
by wishful thinking. 
  Number one: Deprived of the compass offered by the Cold War, 
the United States is steering by the stars; it is still in 
search of a foreign policy, and it has serious and urgent 
problems (Bosnia, Korea, Haiti) to face. Italy, whoever is at 
the helm, is not a problem. Whatever we like to think, the 
Clinton Administration will devote relatively little attention 
and limited time to our country. The Ukraine, as of now, is 
much more worrying (and therefore more important) than we are. 
  Number two: A number of Italian intellectuals, and some of 
their American counterparts, maintain that Silvio Berlusconi's 
unusual position (prime minister-publisher-industrialist) will 
have a detrimental effect on our country. They say that the 
United States leadership, which has always been sensitive to 
conflicting interests, regards Italy as democratically sloppy 
and vaguely unpresentable. Unfortunately, or fortunately 
(depending on one's point of view), this is not how things 
stand. The U.S. Administration is aware of the "Berlusconi 
issue," but will regard it is an internal matter as long as it 
does not reflect on the stability of the country. To put it in 
a nutshell, it is our own business. 
  Number three: After complaining for decades that Italian 
foreign policy was so cautious that it bordered on indolence, 
the Americans will discover that the new government intends to 
take action. Some of its initiatives will be welcomed, whereas 
others have to date been feared (everything with a bearing on 
our eastern border, for example, is studied with great 
attention). Anything may be expected, even that Washington ends 
up by regretting the passing of Christian-Democratic inertia. 
  Number four: While the American Administration will pay 
attention to matters of substance (and expediency), the press 
and television will be seeking stories and headlines. The 
National Alliance's entry into the government will give them 
plenty of these: Fascism and postfascism are immortal topics for 
a public that knows little about Europe and learned what little 
it knows 50 years ago. The President's two visits to Italy (in 
June, for the commemoration of the liberation, and in July, for 
the G-7 summit in Naples) will do the rest. Only if the 
American public were to become alarmed would Bill Clinton, after 
duly consulting his opinion poll experts, pretend to be worried. 
  Fifth and final scenario: Silvio Berlusconi will enjoy 
considerable personal success. More in some countries than in 
others. The British may smile a lot before judging him on 
performance, but the Americans will think they are dreaming: An 
Italian politician who talks straight and smiles a lot (facing 
the right television camera) is an unprecedented novelty. 
However, the new prime minister must avoid making one mistake: 
displaying excessive enthusiasm once he is standing in front of 
the White House. They have seen a lot of enthusiastic Italians 
walk across the lawn there, and they have learned not to take 
them very seriously.

it was probably the most useful conversation I have had with

cease-fire. I also think this is the time for a cease-fire in 
Angola. 
  I also spoke to Butrus-Ghali. President Eduardo dos Santos 
asked me to speak to Savimbi, which I will try and do. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Are you going to intercede? 
  [Soares] No, I am not going to intercede, I am going to 
talk. 
I am going to try to talk -- it is not easy to talk to Savimbi, 
I have no direct channel of communication. He is the one who 
sometimes telephone me. I will see if I can ask him to 
telephone me. I would like to talk to him because this is 
definitely the time for peace. [end recording]

<F P=106> [EFE report: "Foreign Ministry Does Not Deem Cuba's </F>
Opening-Up Measures Sufficient"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- Spain deems "clearly insufficient" the 
measures adopted by the Cuban regime to promote dialogue with 
the opposition, according to Jose Luis Dicenta, secretary of 
state for international cooperation and Latin America. 
  Dicenta emphasized to the Congress [of Deputies] Foreign 
Affairs Committee that "the Spanish Government may err on the 
side of generosity but not of naivety and passivity with respect 
to the Cuban people's suffering," and emphasized that "we also 
maintain scrupulous respect for Cuban sovereignty." 
<H5>  There Is No Interference </H5>
  Hence he asserted that Spain's constant calls for respect 
for 
human rights and basic individual freedoms should not be 
interpreted as interference in Cuba's internal affairs. 
  In his opinion, the good level of dialogue and relations 
between Spain and Cuba and the public and constant condemnation 
of the U.S. embargo do not prevent the government from 
reiterating its views on Cuba's future to the Fidel Castro 
regime. 
  "We will emphasize the Spanish Government's firm resolve to 
cooperate in order to enable Cuba to emerge from the crisis and 
join the community of free and democratic countries with 
prosperous economies," Dicenta said.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Military To Recruit More Women"] </F>
  [Text] The military has begun a campaign to recruit more 
women. 
  "Equality was introduced into the three branches long ago, 
but presently women represent only 5 percent of military 
personnel. This includes 59 officers, 150 sergeants, and 750 
military police," said Lieutenant Colonel Jens Christian Lund, 
director of Military Service and Recruiting. He added that the 
military was hoping to increase that number. 
  The military's good experience with mixed-gender units was 
given as the reason for the campaign. "Women are not merely 
excellent soldiers and colleagues, they have brought a 
much-needed change in attitudes and standards to the formerly 
male-dominated milieu," said Lund.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "A Loose EU Is Not Necessarily to Our </F>
Advantage"] 
  [Text] As a member of the European Union [EU], Finland 
must not become subservient to the interests of any of the big 
powers in the EU. Finland must not align itself with either the 
British or the French ideology, but act as defender of the 
interests of Europe's northeast corner. A loose EU is not 
necessarily advantageous to Finland. 
  These were the points that SDP [Social Democratic Party] 
Chairman Paavo Lipponen stressed in his speech at a seminar 
organized by the Trade and Industry Delegation on Wednesday [4 
May]. Lipponen pointed out that Finland has eight months to 
prepare its membership policy and get ready to take full 
advantage of membership. He added that Finland cannot function 
for a single day in the EU without a clearly defined platform of 
policy. 
  "Will it be the French or the British philosophy? The French 
focus on finality, a clearly defined goal for a closely 
integrated, federalist EU. The British prefer to advance 
pragmatically and favor a loose community until this is proven 
wrong. 
  "Finland has the same right as the present member countries 
to hold on to its national interests. Good relations with 
Russia are too important an asset to Finland to be given up. 
The EU cannot expect Finland to take on greater risks than any 
other member country. Our position has become easier due to the 
fact that the integration of Russia into European cooperation is 
also vital to the EU." 
<H5>  The Foreign Minister Is Giving the Wrong Signals </H5>
  The SPD chairman was critical about the attitude taken by 
Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto: "The foreign minister has 
already gone against Finland's interests on two occasions, once 
by hastening to declare himself a supporter of the British EU 
philosophy and a second time by siding with the British view on 
the minority vote issue." 
  Lipponen did not think it was self-evident at all that a 
loose community would be to Finland's advantage. This 
standpoint is based on misconceptions from the Cold War, not on 
a proper analysis of what is best for Finland: "Finland would 
weaken its own influence by adopting a platform of opposition to 
federalism. A Community without a common will and capacity to 
act is likely sooner or later to leave its smallest members in 
the weakest position. 
  "In a loose EU, the great powers would skim the cream off 
the 
milk and focus on their own interests. If the new countries 
adopt an antifederal platform, it will strengthen the position 
of those who want to create an inner circle of `original' member 
states and do business by means of coalitions." 
  A loose EU, according to Lipponen, may even incite Germany 
to 
go in its own direction. 
<H5>  The EU Must Expand to the East </H5>
  "Germany is very much in favor of expanding the EU to the 
north and the east. This commits Finland, as a member of the 
EU, to take an early stance on the issue of the EU's expansion. 
The newest members are generally opposed to the next 
candidates. But here, Finland's interests are the same as those 
of the EU in general. The countries of East Europe must be 
taken on board as members by the turn of the century. East 
Europe, which is heading for chaos as a result of insecurity and 
political and commercial discrimination, could become an 
overpowering threat to the EU and cause the disintegration of 
the whole union." 
  Lipponen thinks that as a member of the EU, Finland must 
also 
act as a staunch advocate of the interests of business and 
industry. The most typical requirement in this respect concerns 
heavy industry, i.e., the paper, shipbuilding, and metal sectors. 
  In discussing Finland's role as defender of the interests of 
Europe's northeastern region, Lipponen referred to the EU's 
preparatory work to develop a basic structural plan for Europe: 
"It does not include a single project addressing the attachment 
of the Baltic area to the Europe of the EU. The 
Finland-St.Petersburg-Moscow rail and road links, the 
development of the ports in the Gulf of Finland, and the Baltic 
road network must be included in the Commission's project 
program." 
<H5>  "We Do Not Want a Eurohell" </H5>
  Lipponen stressed that Europe must be developed as a social 
project, not only as a design engineered by a 
politico-industrial elite: "We do not want a Eurohell with a 
dogmatic economic and monetary policy, set to destroy the unity 
of the Community and where a political elite hands out 
mafia-style subsidies to mitigate opposition," he said. 
  Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto believes that EU membership 
will enable Finland to focus even more efficiently on the 
central goal of greater stability and security in Northern 
Europe. Haavisto, who also addressed the EVA [Business and 
Industry Delegation] seminar, stressed the importance of 
Finland's role in influencing the way the EU develops its 
relations with Russia and the Baltic states and in the design of 
EU's new northern dimension. 
  Haavisto agreed with SPD Chairman Paavo Lipponen that 
Finland 
must base its actions in the EU on the needs and interests of 
the Finnish community: "Only the Finns themselves will take 
care of Finnish issues in Brussels," Haavisto added. 
  Haavisto was definitely more cautious than Lipponen in 
outlining Finland's role in the EU. While Lipponen believes 
that expansion to include East Europe would be in Finland's 
interest, Haavisto confined himself to say that expansion will 
have to be examined with care as it would affect our position in 
the EU's northeast corner. 
  Haavisto also dodged the issue of whether a loose or a close 
EU would be in Finland's interest. The question must be 
studied, he said, alluding to the smaller EU states, of which 
many have favored federative forms of decisionmaking on the 
basis that this has committed the bigger countries to a closer 
cooperation.

<F P=106> [Article by Maria Romantschuk: "Rehn Not Excited About </F>
Swedish Commander in Chief's Proposal"] 
  [Text] Defense Minister Elisabeth Rehn (RKP [Swedish 
People's Party]) is not excited about the proposal for further 
expanded defense cooperation in the Nordic region. 
  "This is a matter he has returned to several times," Rehn 
commented yesterday. She is of the opinion that it has already 
been extensively realized, since defense cooperation at all 
levels in the Nordic countries is good. 
  Bengt Gustafsson, the Swedish commander in chief, who has 
proposed Nordic defense cooperation before as well, thinks that 
membership in the European Union [EU] opens up possibilities of 
close cooperation between the defense forces of the Nordic 
countries. He does not regard it as a problem that certain 
Nordic countries are members of NATO. Gustafsson presented his 
views in an interview with the newspaper HELSINGIN SANOMAT 
yesterday. 
  The commander in chief says that cooperation could be 
initiated with joint monitoring of the airspace and of the 
Baltic Sea. He motivates his suggestion by the fact that if the 
Nordic area is faced with a military threat of any kind, it 
would apply to all the Nordic countries and not to any 
individual country. 
  "I ask myself whether we are ready for joint monitoring of 
this kind. That is actually the most basic defense in each 
country, and those are among the most important functions that 
each individual country wants to keep to itself," Rehn says. 
  Decisions of this kind would presume entirely new 
evaluations 
of the defense. 
<H5>  Meeting With the Baltic Ministers </H5>
  The already existing good cooperation is, in Rehn's opinion, 
shown by the recurrent defense ministerial meetings, for 
example, most recently over this past weekend, when the 
ministers pondered Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM] and how to arrange the cooperation. At the 
beginning of June the Nordic defense ministers and the Baltic 
defense ministers will meet in Visby. 
  Rehn does not think that new institutions for defense 
cooperation in the Nordic region are needed, not even in the 
event Finland, Sweden, and Norway become members of the EU. 
  "What I am negative to is the idea of a direct union. No 
institutions are necessary in order to practice cooperation."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Olli Rehn: Finland Must Consider </F>
NATO Membership"] 
  [Text] Center Party Deputy Chairman Olli Rehn believes 
Finland should seriously consider joining NATO, the Western 
military alliance, because of the trend in Russia toward 
instability. 
  "I don't want to frighten or threaten, nor do I believe 
there 
is [imminent] danger of military conflict, but the mounting 
hard-line Great Russia ambitions may bring risk of political 
pressure." Rehn presented his views on NATO in an interview with 
ILTA SANOMAT. He suspects that such political pressure could 
also be accompanied with a military threat. 
  Rehn last week hosted a seminar organized in Helsinki by the 
Finnish delegation to the European Union [EU], in which Russian 
extreme nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy participated. 
  Rehn thought that Zhirinovskiy reflects the feelings of the 
Russian people, as well as the injured pride of a great power. 
It appears to Rehn that support for hard-line nationalism is 
growing. 
  In his view, Finland must strengthen its own security while 
at the same time support building democracy in Russia. Living in 
the shadow of an unstable Russia, it is necessary for Finland to 
prepare also against the most negative eventualities. 
  Along with having prepared itself for EU membership, Finland 
is getting into position to become an observer in the Western 
European Union (WEU). Observer status does not bring security 
guarantees; those require joining as a full member. 
  Rehn stated that full membership in WEU is not a realistic 
alternative without membership in NATO, since the WEU's military 
strength rests with NATO. 
  Foreign troops, bases, and nuclear weapons are elements Rehn 
would not permit on Finnish territory if Finland were to become 
a NATO member. 
  Within the foreign policy leadership, a Finnish membership 
in 
NATO has been considered impossible as long as Russia is not 
organizationally tied with NATO.

<F P=106> [FINSKA NOTISBYRAN report: "Norrback Wants EU Vote Early </F>
This Fall"] 
  [Text] Transport and Communications Minister Ole Norrback, 
the Swedish People's Party [RKP] chairman, thinks that an 
earlier date for the referendum on European Union [EU] 
membership is preferable for several reasons. According to 
Norrback, late September/early October is the best time. 
  "After the referendum a large amount of legislative work 
will 
still be needed. The vote also affects the work on the budget. 
The Eduskunta will have a great deal of work this fall," 
Norrback argued. 
  "The adjustment of regional policy and agriculture will also 
require time. An early date for a vote is therefore vitally 
important for agriculture and for all the areas where changes 
are great," Norrback said at a meeting of the executive of the 
RKP yesterday. 
  Norrback pointed out that we also need time to prepare for 
the Eduskunta elections in March 1995 if the election campaign 
is to be able to deal with the important questions the Eduskunta 
and the government will have to decide in the latter half of the 
nineties. According to Norrback there is a risk of a confusion 
of questions that belong to the referendum and questions that 
belong to the Eduskunta election if they are too close to each 
other in time -- and this would be to the detriment of both. 
  Norrback warned against rough estimates in the debate on 
cost 
and on who it is who benefits from or pays for membership. 
  "There is no room for a permanent increase in costs for the 
state as a result of membership." 
  According to Norrback, the tight budget line that the state 
has decided on must hold if the government's economic policy is 
to be seen as credible. According to Norrback, the cost of the 
transition to free prices in the food industry, for example, 
must be seen as an investment in the future. 
  Norrback also warned against excessive promises of support 
for the regions or of a higher level of income for farmers.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Optimistic Business Leaders"] </F>
  [Text] Optimism is now discernible among managing directors 
in large and medium-sized firms. This was contained in an 
economic forecast report that the business newspaper FORUM FOR 
EKONOMI OCH TEKNIK presented in its most recent issue. 
  This positive view applies both to the Finnish economy 
overall and to their own firms. On the other hand, the number of 
CEO's stating that their personnel staffs are going to be 
reduced is larger than the number of business leaders planning 
new hirings. 
  The report, which was prepared by Oy Interpersona Ab, is 
based on a questionnaire sent to 230 managing directors around 
the end of March and beginning of April. 
  Almost three-fourths of business leaders assume that the 
Finnish economic situation is going to improve over the next six 
months, while 25 percent believe the situation will remain 
unchanged from the present level. Only 3 percent expect a 
worsening. 
  Regarding their own firms, six of 10 think that activity 
will 
pick up in the coming half-year. One-third believe that the 
activity level will remain unchanged, while 6 percent expect 
declining figures. 
  The business leaders, however, do not expect to see any 
improvement regarding jobs. Only 12 percent say they are going 
to increase their work force during then coming six months. 
Every third CEO is counting on a reduction of personnel, while 
55 percent foresee retaining their current work force size. 
  The CEO's, in addition, were asked to describe their firms' 
current general policies.

<F P=106> [Article by Jorma Rotko: "Estonia's Inflation Accelerates: </F>
Prices in March Rose Nearly 9 Percent"] 
  [Text] Tallinn -- A common sight last summer around Tallinn 
harbor was a happy Finnish family carrying aboard their ship 
inexpensive food purchased in Estonia. This summer this sight 
will perhaps not be as usual, since Estonia's economy has 
slipped into exploding inflation. 
  For all of last year inflation was 35 percent, which is 
small 
in comparison with other other former socialist countries. 
Inflation in January of this year was 5.5 percent, in February 
5.2, and in March already 8.9 percent. 
  In Estonia it is estimated that the first three months of 
this year have brought a rise in the cost-of-living index of 
around 21 percent. 
  Research Director Marje Josing of the Estonian Business 
Institute says that wages in the private sector have kept pace 
with the inflation rate. 
  "Last year in September the mean wage in Estonia was 1,168 
kroons (around 550 Finnish markkas); by February this year the 
mean wage was 1,365 kroons (around 640 markkas)." 
  Josing thinks inflation is hitting hardest retired persons 
whose pensions have not risen at the same pace as prices. 
  Josing does not believe inflation will continue at the same 
8.9-percent pace experienced in March. 
  "The great demand for food products from Russia caused the 
rise in prices in Estonia. In mid-February, Russia placed an 
average 30-percent tariff on Estonian food products, and exports 
collapsed completely. For this reason, Estonian producers are 
being forced to act on prices in order to get their products 
sold in the domestic market," Josing said. 
<H5>  Finnish Goods Still Inexpensive </H5>
  As Estonia's prices have risen, Finnish goods have become 
more competitive. Indeed, the general lifting of prices has been 
tempting merchants to raise their prices also for Finnish goods. 
  The price for good quality Estonian cheese has risen this 
year from 15 to 25 markkas per kg, but 400 grams of a Finnish 
butter-margarine mix still gets around four markkas. The Finnish 
taxpayer subsidizes the greatest portion of this price. 
  In March, Estonia's inflation rate even exceeded that of 
Russia. Housing costs rose during March by 18.5 percent, 
services by 15.5 percent, and food by 7.5 percent. 
  The dizzying inflation has set many to pondering whether the 
Estonian kroon's firm tie to the German mark at the rate of 1:8 
will be long sustainable. The German mark is already beginning 
to be so cheap that it is becoming interesting to Estonian 
investors. 
  Kroons are beginning to be exchanged for hard currency. In 
March the Central Bank's hard currency reserves backing the 
kroon dropped for the first time since the kroon came into use, 
even though by only 1.5 percent.

<F P=106> [Harald Stanghelle report: "Progress Party Below </F>
Representation Threshold"] 
  [Text] The Progress Party's voters are leaving the party. 
Only some 3.5 percent of voters support the party, Opinion's May 
poll shows. 
  The poll is based on 1,000 interviews carried out on Monday 
to Wednesday [2-4 May] this week. This means that most 
respondents were interviewed after it became known that three of 
the Progress Party's Storting deputies were leaving the party. 
  Voters' reaction to what is happening is clear: Opinion's 
poll on party standings tells of a party in free-fall. In 
comparison with last month the Progress Party has lost 0.8 
percent. This in itself is nothing dramatic. But the April 
poll was already showing a very poor result -- 4.3 percent voter 
support -- and with today's 3.5 percent the Progress Party has 
for the first time in many years fallen below the 4-percent 
threshold for representation in the Storting. 
  The seriousness of the situation can be seen from Opinion's 
background findings. These show that only 34.1 percent of those 
who voted for the Progress Party in the last Storting election 
would do the same today. A month ago this so-called loyalty 
index was 51.3 percent -- in other words more and more loyal 
Progress Party voters are leaving the party. 
  A little over 20 percent of those who said that they voted 
for the Progress Party last year said that today they would vote 
for the Conservative Party. A total of 36.4 percent form the 
group that is undecided about how it will vote. This figure is 
the only glimmer of light for the man whose 50th birthday is 
today -- Progress Party leader Carl I. Hagen -- a politician who 
has already built up the Progress Party from bottom levels. It 
remains to be seen whether he can do so again. 
  Opinion's poll is characterized by stability for most 
parties. The Labor Party falls back 0.5 percent, and has 38.2 
percent support. The Christian People's Party has also lost 
ground, and after a loss of 0.6 percent the party records 
support of 6.9 percent in the May poll. The Center Party 
remains stable with the same result as in April, all of 18.3 
percent. Despite the trickle of Progress Party voters, the 
Conservative Party has fallen back by 0.5 percent to 17.8 
percent. 
  Following the fortunes of the Socialist Left Party is very 
interesting at present. We saw in the April poll that the 
party's voter leakage to the Labor Party was coming to an end, 
despite the fact that the party did lose a little ground. In 
May this trend really registered: With gains of 2.1 percent the 
party now has a level of voter support of 9.6 percent -- almost 
2 percent more than in the Storting election. The background 
figures indicate a very high loyalty index -- all of 77.4 
percent -- and a trickle of voters from both the Labor Party and 
the Center Party. It will be interesting to see whether future 
polls will confirm signs that hint that for the first time for a 
very long time the Socialist Left Party is on the offensive 
again.

<F P=106> [Hilde Harbo report: "Hagen Just As Uncompromising"] </F>
  [Text] Party chairman Carl I. Hagen is showing no 
inclination toward reconciliation and sees no need for the 
clarification the Progress Party Youth [FrPU] is asking for. 
This could lead to mass resignations from the party or a 
further escalation of the conflict between the mother party and 
its youth organization. 
  Yesterday the FrPU held a national executive meeting to 
discuss its turbulent relationship with its mother party. The 
meeting did not reach any final conclusions, but it did decide 
to call an extraordinary national conference before 3 July. In 
a resolution the FrPU asked the party chairman to clarify 
whether he adheres to statements that the FrPU and leading 
officials in the FrPU are not wanted in the Progress Party [FrP] 
movement. The resolution states that Carl I. Hagen and the 
majority in the party must assume the responsibility for the 
growing number of resignations in the youth movement. The 
resolution was adopted by 26 votes against the single vote of 
Ulf Leirstein of Ostfold FrPU. 
  "The minority in the FrP are dissatisfied with the way in 
which we are being treated by the majority. The only thing we 
want is to be given a little more respect and space, especially 
on questions of values. Hagen has made remarks about us that 
are less than pleasant, and has hinted that he wants us out of 
the party. Now we want an answer from him about whether we can 
continue to work as a radical youth party in line with our 
political manifesto or whether we are to be subjected to total 
and slavish discipline," FrPU chairman Lars Erik Gronntun said 
after yesterday's national executive meeting. 
  He will use the time up to the national conference to 
clarify 
his future role in the party, and he rejected the suggestion 
that participation in the formation of a new party is on the 
agenda as far as he is concerned. At the same time he confirmed 
that Hagen's response to the youth organization will be 
important for the outcome of the extraordinary national 
conference. 
  Several centrally placed officials in the FrPU are now 
looking at their links with the party, but the national 
executive adopted a resolution yesterday urging all its members 
to stay on in their posts in the FrP and the FrPU and wait for 
the outcome of the extraordinary national conference. Gronntun 
confirmed that there are divergent views in the youth 
organization about whether or not there is any point in staying. 
  Party chairman Carl I. Hagen was unwilling yesterday to 
offer 
an outstretched hand to those in the FrPU who are frustrated. 
  "There is no need for the FrP to clarify anything at all. 
This was something that happened at the national conference. It 
is up to each individual member of the party to decide whether 
he or she wants to continue to work on the basis of the 
guidelines drawn up at the national conference. If anyone has 
any doubts about what they want, they will have to start 
behaving like adults and reach a decision. We have to put this 
behind us now," Hagen said. 
  Do you think that it would be regrettable if many centrally 
placed officials in the FrPU see no option other than to leave 
the party after the national conference? 
  "I choose not to have any views on that," Hagen said. He 
added that if the youth organization has anything to tell the 
party, it should address itself to the central executive. He 
merely notes the FrPU resolution, adding that there are many 
youth organizations that adopt resolutions. 
  Terje Nyberget, who was the mother party's observer at the 
national executive meeting, said yesterday that he will now 
resign from his post as member of the FrP central executive. He 
seemed somewhat disappointed that the youth organization had not 
reached a final decision at yesterday's meeting and said that 
personally he cannot wait any longer before reaching a decision 
about what is happening. At the same time he praised the youth 
organization and said that politically he feels much more at 
home in it than in the FrP. 
  Nyberget was unwilling to comment on the question of 
resigning from the party. But it is possible that after the 
FrPU national conference he could become a member of the youth 
party, because the national executive backed a proposal to end 
the age limit for FrPU membership. This is a reaction to a 
series of requests from FrP members who have passed the current 
age limit of 30 but who nevertheless feel more in line with the 
youth party.

<F P=106> [Anita Kratz report: "Center Party Said a Clear `Yes' to </F>
the EU"] 
  [Text] After figures of 184 yes votes and 92 no votes to 
the European Union [EU] a relieved Center Party leader Olof 
Johansson was able to acknowledge the standing ovations from the 
delegates at the Center Party's extraordinary congress. 
  "Let me say immediately that this vote has no winners and no 
losers either," Olof Johansson said after the vote in the hall 
of Aso High School in Stockholm. 
  He invited representatives of the no side to consultations 
in 
the framework of the party's executive committee to discuss how 
the work of the referendum campaign is to be tackled. All to 
try to keep disappointed opponents of the EU from losing heart 
and to keep them feeling like real Center Party people. 
  Olof Johansson is aware of the no camp's dilemma. Despite 
everything, they have to mobilize themselves for an election 
campaign where the EU will be one of the central issues. And 
right up to 13 November they will have to put forward arguments 
explaining why they do not believe in the EU without having the 
party leadership's backing for their views. 
  With tears in his eyes in an emotional closing speech 
immediately before the vote, Olof Johansson stressed that 
membership of the EU is not a goal in itself for the Center 
Party, but merely the means to an end -- a means that Olof 
Johansson considers to be effective, even though it took him 30 
years to reach this view. 
  "We hold fundamental values in common and they remain." 
  The unexpected result of the congress with such an 
overwhelming majority for a yes must been seen as strong support 
for the party's chairman and his way of handling the EU 
question. Olof Johansson has received a lot of criticism from 
inside and outside his party because he as party leader did not 
make any pronouncement on EU membership until the final phase of 
the debate. 
  But there has also been the opposite criticism from many 
Center Party members. They would have preferred to see that 
neither the party congress nor the party leader had to make up 
their minds about the EU, in order to avoid a split in the party. 
  "I have the support behind me now for the party's position," 
Olof Johansson said at a news conference after the congress. 
  In the referendum campaign the Center Party leader intends 
to 
be cautious with his slogans. 
  "I do not want to produce propaganda, but instruction. I 
will try to be honest with regard to my analysis and convictions 
even if this might sometimes help my opponents." 
  The party executive also received the congress's backing to 
work on the answers to the nine questions Olof Johansson put in 
his opening address to the congress on Saturday [7 May]. For 
example, he said that the EU's convergence criteria should not 
be an obstacle to social welfare, and also spoke of trying to 
create blocking minorities in the environmental field in the EU. 
  "We have retained the right to make the decisions relating 
to 
our nonalignment. This could be an issue that would need a 
referendum," Olof Johansson said. 
  At the news conference the Center Party leader was unwilling 
to go into excessively hypothetical arguments, as he put it. 
But a new referendum on the EU does not seem completely out of 
the question for Olof Johansson, if Sweden is a member and the 
EU is about to enter into even more intimate political 
cooperation.

  [Text] Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's 
alternate special representative in Cyprus, left this afternoon 
for Vienna. Tomorrow he will meet Turkish Deputy Foreign 
Minister Tugay Ulucevik and Robert Lamb, the U.S. State 
Department's special coordinator on the Cyprus issue. 
  Feissel noted in a statement that two Turkish Cypriots, 
advisers to Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas, will also be in 
Vienna. He added that during tomorrow's meeting the situation 
will be evaluated since the deadlock on the talks on 
implementing the confidence-building measures. The Vienna talks 
are expected to be the last before the UN secretary general's 
report is circulated by the end of next week. 
  Asked about the Lamb-Feissel-Ulucevik meeting, acting 
Government Spokesman Spiros Arotis referred to the statement by 
President Glavkos Kliridhis that the government does not expect 
anything from this meeting.

<F P=106> [Column by Sedat Sertoglu: "Denktas and Cyprus"] </F>
  [Text] Leaning forward in his armchair, Rauf Denktas says: 
"There was no alternative in Cyprus. That was the biggest 
mistake...." 
  He linked the long period the National Unity Party remained 
in power in the TRNC [Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus] with 
that factor. He also explained the drawbacks created by the 
failure of the opposition parties in the TRNC to form an 
alternative. 
  Denktas visited SABAH yesterday. After so many years, he has 
begun to see things the way we do, although not entirely. His 
views on the package of confidence-building measures were 
realistic.... 1. He seemed prepared to hold talks on the 
package. 2. But he seemed reluctant to take a backward step on 
it.... 
  The UN secretary general's report has not been drawn up. It 
was to have been submitted at the end of April. I believe the 
Western countries are gradually becoming aware of the holes in 
the second package. This has delayed the report. Turkey has 
categorically stated the following: "All the holes in the 
second package of confidence-building measures must be repaired. 
There can be no accepting that three of the holes will be 
repaired and the Turkish side should agree to make concessions 
in the other areas." 
  Britain is the most influential country in the Cyprus 
problem. It long appeared disinterested. But recently it seems 
to have agreed that a balance must be established in the 
package.... That is good news.... 
<H5>  Full Membership </H5>
  Developments are expected to take place in Cyprus during the 
current week.... New proposals will be made to establish a 
balance in the package.... The package, which has been ruptured 
in favor of the Greek Cypriot side, will be placed on the 
negotiating table to be repaired.... 
  Meanwhile, the Greek Cypriot side's plans seem unending. 
They have raised the question of Cyprus becoming a full member 
of the European Union. That is what they have been working on 
for some time.... What the British and French ambassadors in 
Turkey must realize and explain to their governments is: "The 
TRNC must integrate with Turkey if the Greek Cypriot side joins 
the European Union. The Turkish Cypriots will have no 
alternative. The decision the European Union will adopt in 
favor of the Greek Cypriots will pave the way for the division 
of Cyprus...." 
  Turkey has been trying to explain the danger to Europe but 
"What is Europe's approach to the issue?" That question can be 
answered as follows: "Some of them are indifferent. Many 
others are aware of the danger. Several pray that the calendar 
that has been established for a Cyprus settlement will be 
heeded, that is, they expect the problem to be solved by 1 
January 1995...." 
  Denktas explained the drawbacks in that. Henceforth he will 
move often and on every platform to explain the drawbacks of the 
Greek Cypriot side's joining the European Union. He will be 
justified in doing so. 
<H5>  Missed Opportunities </H5>
  We will soon meet in Cyprus again to discuss the Cyprus 
problem in detail behind closed doors.... We have decided to do 
that. We will exchange views on the issue.... 
  It seems that discussing the Cyprus problem with Rauf 
Denktas, who is one of the most experienced political 
negotiators, will be interesting.... We will inform you of the 
views we exchange apart from those that are outlined on the 
condition that they are not published. 
  Denktas mentioned one expectation that has not been 
realized. 
No capital investments have been made by Turkish businessmen in 
the TRNC since 1974. Turkish industrialists have not 
established factories to operate in north Cyprus.... Denktas 
described the period from 1974 to 1978 as an era of "missed 
opportunities." He also criticized Turkey for allowing 
Archbishop Makarios to return to Cyprus after the Greek coup in 
1974. He was justified in doing so.... 
  Denktas was worried by Turkey's revelation that it agreed to 
the first package of confidence-building measures. He was 
worried because Ankara failed to consult him on the issue. We 
disagreed with Denktas on that point. 
  Another aspect of the problem is that we may have to try to 
explain the situation to the White House, which is expected to 
influence the effort to solve the Cyprus problem. But the White 
House maintains an approach that conflicts with the 
recommendations of the U.S. State Department. Obviously, the 
U.S. State Department than the White House advisers of the 
realities in Cyprus. But it seems that it cannot surmount the 
obstacles created by the presidential advisers, who are 
influenced by the Greeks and Greek Cypriots. In view of that, I 
believe that the friends of Turkey at the U.S. Embassy in Ankara 
should make an effort to help the White House adopt the right 
approach.... 
  The next few days may be very important for north Cyprus and 
Turkey. We must avoid making unnecessary statements to maintain 
our justified position. This applies particularly to Motherland 
Party leader Mesut Yilmaz. Yilmaz, do you understand what I 
mean?

  [Text] President Rauf Denktas has said it is impossible to 
establish a federation when there is such a deep gulf between 
the two communities. He pointed out that the deadlock in Cyprus 
results from the fact that the Greek Cypriot partner, which has 
a majority, is considered the legitimate government of the 
entire island. The federation we want, he said, is different 
from the federation the Greek Cypriots want. 
  Denktas was speaking at a working breakfast given by the 
Bursa Industrialists and Businessmen's Association at Celik 
Palace Hotel. He stressed that the Turkish Cypriots should not 
pin their hopes on the world and the United Nations and expect 
them to mete out justice in Cyprus. He added that the Turkish 
Cypriots must defend their own rights and must develop 
economically. Otherwise, he warned, the countries of the world 
will continue to pursue the policy they have been pursuing for 
the past 30 years, either for their own benefit or in the 
interests of others. 
  The president explained that if Turkey helps the Turkish 
Cypriots economically and shows the world that it is on their 
side, not only militarily but economically as well, then their 
image in the eyes of the world will change. He added: Had the 
Turkish Cypriots been strengthened economically, had Turkey 
created such a picture, we would not have been seen as an 
occupying force. Denktas recalled that Turkey promised to 
extend political guarantees to Turkish businessmen who invest in 
Cyprus, but this promise has not yet been fulfilled. He urged 
Turkey to extend this guarantee so that businessmen will invest 
in Cyprus. 
  Commenting on the proposal that the Cyprus problem be solved 
through a federation, the president said: The Turkish Cypriots 
want a federation in which they will not have to return the 
rights they have gained, a federation based on equal rights, 
while the Greek Cypriots want a federation that will establish 
Greek Cypriot sovereignty on the island. Denktas stressed that 
even UN officials who are familiar with the Cyprus problem admit 
that the Greek Cypriots want to extend their power to the 
Turkish Cypriot side.

  [Text] The government places particular importance on the 
visit to Cyprus by two Russian Foreign Ministry officials for 
talks on the Cyprus issue. Russia is a permanent member of the 
UN Security Council and shows particular interest in the Cyprus 
issue. The Russian officials arrived in Cyprus today. They will 
begin contacts with the government this afternoon. The two 
Russian officials are Felix Bogdanov, director of the Russian 
Foreign Ministry's 3d Directorate, and Piotr Dobroserdov, who is 
his deputy and the personal envoy of Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev. 
  Acting Government Spokesman Spiros Arotis said the Russian 
officials will meet with Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis 
tomorrow afternoon. They will also meet with political party 
leaders. Dobroserdov will go to the occupied areas to meet 
leaders of Turkish Cypriot political parties. Asked whether the 
Russian envoys are carrying any ideas or proposals, the acting 
spokesman said the content of their visit will become evident 
during the talks with the government. He added that it is not 
known when they will leave Cyprus.

  [Text] Our country considers the change in the Skopje [The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM] flag to be a 
practical sign of goodwill. Government Spokesman Evangelos 
Venizelos also said that the government has received no official 
statement and that its information is limited to press reports. 
Venizelos repeated that the Greek Government wants a quick 
solution to the issue, but that this is a hope, a goal; it does 
not mean things are close to agreement. The only development in 
the issue of Skopje, Venizelos said, is the Thursday [12 May] 
meeting in New York between Ambassador Khristos Zakharakis, 
Foreign Ministry director general, and UN mediator Cyrus Vance. 
The Greek Government, Venizelos stressed, is not satisfied with 
the proposal for a mutual guarantee of borders. The spokesman 
concluded by saying that Skopje knows the conditions laid down 
by the Greek Government. They are international legal 
regulations that Skopje must respect.

  [Text] New Democracy Chairman Miltiadhis Evert returned to 
Ioannina at noon today folloowing a two-day tour to North 
Epirus, during which he visited villages and towns where the 
Greek minority lives. In a news conference at Ioannina, Evert 
called on the Albanian leadership to respect the human rights of 
North Epirotes. Good relations with Greece, Evert said, are to 
Albania's benefit. He said that it is inconceivable for 
relations between the two countries to be at the level of 
serious misunderstandings on the eve of the 21st century. 
  Referring to Turkey's involvement in Greek-Albanian 
relations, Evert said that if something like this were to 
happen, Ankara would have chosen a wrong direction. Finally, 
Evert said that he will visit the Albanian capital only if the 
five Omonoia [organization of the Greek minority of Albania] 
officials of the Greek minority, currently in Tirana prisons, 
are freed.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Marina Vikha from Gjirokaster] </F>
  [Excerpts] According to evaluations of the Greek minority 
in Albania, the policy that the Albanian Government--especially 
President Sali Berisha--will follow in the near future is to 
continue its provocations in the form of statements or 
provocative acts that will be blamed on "Greek terrorist 
organizations." 
  The same sources clarified that "while the Albanian people 
depend on Greece for financial help, Berisha and his environment 
depend politically and economically on foreign centers that do 
not want Greek-Albanian relations to improve. On the contrary, 
these centers would benefit if relations deteriorated." 
  It is especially significant to look at the interpretation 
of 
Berisha's policy toward Greece. "What the Albanian president is 
really afraid of is not the Greek minority in Albania, but that 
the vast majority in southern Albania--Greeks, Albanians, 
Orthodox people, and Muslims--has its eyes turned toward Greece, 
is learning the Greek language, is trading in drachmas, and is 
living peacefully." This is what concerns the Albanian 
Government, a government that during its two years in power has 
nothing to show for it other than dictatorship, terrorism, 
political persecution, censorship, offensive talk against 
opponents, and financial corruption. For such a government to 
survive, it needs to exaggerate foreign danger--Greek danger--to 
revitalize its national conscience and avoid the opposition. 
  Albanian Government officials already believe that under 
this 
possible scenario that has been implemented with foreign 
guidance, Berisha foresees--if his policy of slanting "the 
foreign danger of Byzantine Greece" succeeds--that the 
opposition will join with the government and form a "government 
of national unity that will deal with the foreign threat." 
[passage omitted] 
  Albanian opposition and Greek minority officials believe 
that 
it is urgent to strengthen relations between them because both 
groups are being tried by the Albanian Government's dictatorship 
and their human rights are being violated. If the Human Rights 
Party does not realize its real role of defending the human 
rights of the minority and the Albanian people, then it is in 
danger of being isolated and falling into the trap set by the 
Albanian Government. [passage omitted] 
  The Greek minority party Omonoia will give a news conference 
in Tirana to say that "the Albanian people and the Albanian 
political parties must be informed of the organization's real 
positions so that they do not become an object of exploitation 
by third parties that do not want Greek-Albanian relations to 
improve."

<F P=106> [Yvonne Van Der Heijden report: "Belgium To Exchange </F>
Economic and Social Data With China"] 
  [Excerpt] Belgium has moved closer to the center of 
economic decisionmaking in China. The [Belgian] Economic 
Affairs Ministry has signed an agreement with China's State 
Planning Committee to exchange information and experiences. 
Belgium is the first country to have signed an agreement of 
this kind with the People's Republic of China. 
  "It is an interesting agreement. Through the more intensive 
high-level contacts, we will both come to know and trust each 
other better. We ultimately will obtain a better understanding 
of how the economic system operates in China and also vice 
versa," Cabinet Chief Gilles de Kerchove said two days ago in an 
interview with DE FINANCIEEL EKONOMISCHE TIJD in Beijing. He 
believes this is evident from the experiences gained through a 
similar agreement with the Japanese Ministry of International 
Trade and Industry. 
  Mr. de Kerchove signed the agreement last Friday [6 May] on 
behalf of Melchior Wathelet, deputy prime minister and minister 
of economic affairs. Chen Jinhua, president of the State 
Planning Committee, signed for China. The agreement includes 
provisions for an exchange of economists and scientists to 
undertake scientific research. Seminars also will be held on 
specific topics relating to economic and social developments in 
the two countries. China has reached agreements of a similar 
nature with three other industrial countries, Japan, South 
Korea, and Germany, but these are not laid down in writing.

  [Text] Last year our country has traded weapons worth 12.5 
billion francs. This was mentioned in a first report on arms 
trade. According to a new law, every year the Belgian Government 
should present a report on arms trade in our country. Only a 
small part of the weapons was exported from Flanders -- the 
southern part of Belgium -- Wallonia -- clearly remains the 
largest weapon exporter. 
  A controversy on weapon deliveries to the Middle East led to 
the collapse of the last Martens government. Shortly after that 
the law on arms trade became stricter. Exports of weapons to 
countries violating human rights or to countries where a civil 
war is going on are no longer allowed. Also deliveries to 
transit countries or countries involved in terrorist actions and 
drugs trade are no longer possible. 
  The present report on arms export gives very few details, 
which makes it difficult to check all the deliveries. It is, 
however, sure that most of the weapons continue to go to the 
Near and Middle East. 
  Senator of the moderate nationalist party Volksunie, Willy 
Kuijpers, has said that the new law on arms trade hasn't changed 
anything. Kuijpers is closely watching arms exports to Turkey 
where their Army is fighting the Kurds. The senator says it is 
impossible to find out whether deliveries to Turkey were 
extended or not. A member of the Turkish Embassy wanted to 
attend the discussion of the report in the senate, but he was 
refused admittance.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Willink Leans Toward `Purple' for </F>
the Time Being"] 
  [Excerpt] Tjeenk Willink, who is assessing on behalf of the 
crown whether a proposed cabinet formation will succeed, will be 
speaking today with the chairmen of the PvdA [Labor Party], the 
VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy], and the D66 
[Democrats 66] about the formation of a "purple" coalition 
comprising these three parties. For the time being, the CDA 
[Christian Democratic Appeal] will not be taking part in the 
discussions. 
  Together with the party leaders Kok, Bolkestein, and Van 
Mierlo, Tjeenk Willink wants to establish whether there is 
sufficient political will for a three-party government without 
the Christian Democrats. On Monday [9 May], the day on which 
Willinks received all the party leaders from the Second Chamber, 
Kok and Bolkestein, in particular, were still expressing doubts 
about a coalition of this kind. 
  From the round of talks held yesterday, the possibility of a 
"purple" coalition emerged as the "greatest common denominator." 
Especially D66 leader Van Mierlo, his CDA colleague Brinkman, 
and the Green Left leader Rosenmoeller were clearly of the 
opinion that only a government including the PvdA, the VVD, and 
the D66 should be given a chance. Several smaller parties also 
expressed a similar opinion to Willink. 
  Following his talks with Tjeenk Willink, PvdA leader Kok 
said 
that he was prepared to assess over the next few days as to 
whether such a "purple" coalition is possible. However, he 
explained that he could not cry victory. "I am not convinced 
that there is sufficient support for a coalition of this kind," 
he said. 
  Kok said that he could see "substantial bottlenecks," 
particularly regarding cooperation with the VVD, "not only 
regarding the social issues, but also on the subjects of 
immigration and integration, development aid, and the 
environment. It is not a question of political will, as Van 
Mierlo says, but of the objective possibility of the PvdA and 
the VVD joining forces. This must first be a possibility. 
Sometimes differences are too great to be bridged." 
  In his reaction to this, Van Mierlo said: "First you must 
want to do something, then you can decide how to bring it about. 
We all have the key to this affair, and we can all make it 
fail." The D66 leader does not regard the fact that Kok is 
acting in such a reserved manner as "writing on the wall." 
  "It is a question of those parties slowly getting used to 
the 
idea. The past of the PvdA and the VVD is simply rooted in the 
self-evidence of the presence of the CDA [in government]. The 
PvdA and the VVD are used to distrusting each other in the 
formation, with one playing on the left wing of the CDA, and the 
other on the right. That distrust must gradually disappear, and 
it must do so soon," Van Mierlo claimed. 
  VVD party chairman Bolkestein did not want to make any 
comments on his talk with Willink. The liberals have always 
spoken out in favor of a coalition between the two winning 
parties, the VVD and the D66, complemented by one of the losing 
government parties. Bolkestein has always desisted from stating 
a preference for the PvdA or the CDA. However, during the 
election campaign, the rift between the VVD and the PvdA grew 
larger rather than smaller. "Our program, and that proposed by 
Kok, are two extremes," Bolkestein said, for example, referring 
to the paragraph on employment in the VVD and the PvdA 
platforms. 
  Furthermore, Bolkestein considers the total of cuts that the 
PvdA intends to make in the upcoming period of government, 
approximately nine billion guilders, to be too low. He has said 
that the VVD will not enter into the government if the amount 
set aside for rationalization remains stuck at between 8 and 10 
billion. 
  CDA leader Brinkman reiterated to Tjeenk Willink that the 
CDA, in view of its loss of 20 out of 54 seats, would prefer him 
to look into the possibility of a "purple" coalition. 
  Tjeenk Willink has taken it upon himself to give his opinion 
to Queen Beatrix on around 17 May, the day on which the Second 
Chamber is established. By then, Willink expects to be able to 
present three potential government parties that have committed 
themselves to "undertake to make an effort," as well as a list 
of matters for which it has been decided a settlement must be 
found. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with President Francois Mitterrand by Paul Amar </F>
and Patrick Poivre d'Arvor in the Elysee Palace -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Poivre d'Arvor] Good evening, Mr President. 
[passage omitted] We will start with the event of the day, the 
accession of Nelson Mandela to the presidency of the Republic of 
South Africa. In the past five years in the Elysee you have 
lived through an amazing acceleration of history; how do you 
react to what happened in Pretoria today? 
  [Mitterrand] The events in Pretoria -- in South Africa, that 
is -- are among the most important and most symbolic of the 
whole history of the relations I would call -- very roughly, of 
course -- colonization and decolonization. A whole group of men 
and women who were used to thinking in a different way have 
abandoned any idea of racism, or at least of any application of 
a racist system. Apartheid was an abominable system. It took 
the courage and intelligence of a lot of leaders, especially of 
two of them -- the black African leader Nelson Mandela, and 
Frederik de Klerk, the white man -- to make a success of 
something that could scarcely be guessed at. 
  I am very happy to think that it was here, in the Elysee, 
that Mandela and De Klerk met for the first time to dine. I had 
invited both of them so as to be able to contribute to bringing 
them closer together -- of course people other than me, and 
especially the two of them themselves have done most of the 
work. I got to know Mandela as soon as he came out of prison, 
where he had stayed about 27 years. He came to see me quite 
often; we often spoke on the phone. I have great esteem and 
respect for de Klerk. 
  Today is a day of great happiness for me. We have enough 
painful things. There is some hope in the Middle East, timid 
and fragile to be sure, but hope nevertheless. And this success 
in South Africa. 
  [Amar] So there is this hope for a better life, which is 
like 
a miracle in South Africa. Yesterday in north Africa, much 
further north.... 
  [Mitterrand, interrupting] Which comes from the strength of 
will of a few men, their strength of will, the clarity of their 
intelligence, and their moral courage. That is not a miracle. 
  [Amar] There is a danger of a return to obscurantism in 
north 
Africa, a danger which is costing French nationals dear. Two 
French religious figures were killed on Sunday [8 May]. What 
can France do, what should France do, first to protect French 
nationals? Are you asking all French people living in Algeria 
to return to France? 
  [Mitterrand] That has been done. They have been advised to 
do this. We can only give advice. I think all the French 
people living in Algeria have been told that we, the government 
and I, want them to return to France to save their lives. If 
you want clear instructions, there they are. 
  [Poivre d'Arvor] And in the face of the upsurge of 
intolerance, a number of people are worried about a massive 
influx of refugees to France. What should the country do in 
such a case? 
  [Mitterrand] It all depends on the result of the struggle 
taking place now in Algeria. It is very difficult for a French 
person to say anything about it without taking extreme 
psychological precautions. We have special experience of 
Algeria, we were, after all, the country regarded as the 
colonizer, the colonial power, let's say. 
  You can have different views about this. France was useful 
to Algeria, but the Algerians don't like us to say so, or to 
take a patronizing tone to give them advice in one direction or 
another. 
  [Amar] May we have your view about what is happening there? 
The current government wants elections -- it said so recently; 
if these elections end up with a victory for the 
fundamentalists, are you not worried about the arrival of an 
Islamic republic very close to France? 
  [Mitterrand] The Algerian people will do what they want to 
do. You cannot be a democrat here and question the concern of a 
people somewhere else to decide their fate themselves. 
  Of course you can hope that they will be more enlightened 
and 
that the economic crisis affecting the Algerian people, as it 
affects many others, will not distort their judgement, that they 
won't simply react by rejecting those in government to give 
their votes to others who are promising a kind of society that 
-- in my view, at least -- is not a society of progress. 
  [Poivre d'Arvor] But we can say that 32 years after the end 
of the Algerian war the country is adrift? 
  [Mitterrand] Adrift is a strong word. But there is a civil 
war. A civil war; so this is, I hope, a provisional, though 
dramatic, conclusion. The country needs to find the right 
slogans, to find its basic truths. I don't myself think -- 
since you are asking my opinion -- that it is in fundamentalism, 
religious fundamentalism; that people should have a faith, that 
they practice it, that they respect it, that they want others to 
know about it and to understand it, is reasonable -- but by 
violence and death, no. 
  [Amar] Violence and death, you say, violence and death in 
Bosnia. At present 11 French people, 11 aid workers of a French 
humanitarian organization, Premiere Urgence, are being held by 
the Serbs. In your opinion, Mr. President, are they prisoners 
or hostages? 
  [Mitterrand] One can use whichever word one wishes. They are 
prisoners and they have the value of hostages. They can be used 
by those holding them as bargaining counters in exchange for 
this or that political concession or military concession. 
  [Amar] And France does not have the means to bang its fist 
on 
the table. 
  [Mitterrand] To bang its fist on the table, what does that 
mean? Does it mean for example to achieve what it is difficult 
to achieve in a country one does not know well, which has many 
natural defenses, which is hilly, and find these hostages or 
these prisoners -- they are both of these -- and free them? If 
this were to be the case, then I would not tell you: We are 
going to do it, but I do not think this would be the right 
action to take. We would be taking enormous risks with their 
lives, and I believe that negotiation is still possible. So, as 
far as banging our fist on the table is concerned, well I do not 
think so, I think that negotiation must be tried first. 
  [Amar] This hostage-taking reveals much about the attitude 
of 
the Serbs. French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe was quite 
pessimistic, speaking in the last few days, I believe it was 
Sunday. If a diplomatic solution does not come about, he 
suggested, we should perhaps envisage the withdrawal of the 
French troops of the UN peacekeeping force. 
  [Mitterrand] On this matter I believe that Mr. Juppe -- 
naturally, we have discussed this problem together a great deal 
- Mr. Juppe was speaking above all to all of the countries which 
have something to say on the matter and can take some action 
concerning the situation in Bosnia. In other words, the 
Americans, the Russians, and all of the countries which make up 
the European Union [EU]. It was for these countries that his 
remarks were intended. If you do not want to launch serious 
negotiations among yourselves, and reach agreement [changes 
thought], there have been partial negotiations, the Europeans 
have achieved a result which one might have considered to be 
adequate a few months ago, but it failed. However, the Americans 
were not exactly involved in these discussions, and when the 
Americans became involved, then it was the Russians who were 
absent. As you know, people have different interests -- 
traditions, old alliances, play a part -- to the extent that we 
have not yet ever managed to bring together the three interested 
parties which are external to the local debate, the Russians, 
the Americans, and the EU, and it is for the French in 
particular to hold an international conference with these three 
big powers, under the aegis of the United Nations, with the 
warring parties, of course. 
  The Russians and the Americans had agreed to discuss the 
matter in a month's time, although that is already two weeks ago 
now, and we, the French immediately said -- and Mr. Juppe was 
our spokesman, since he is the foreign minister -- things must 
move faster. I remember, I said eight days -- these eight days 
have already been exceeded, and this is yet more time lost for 
achieving a return to peace and sparing further victims. We, 
the French, are there and we are determined to see that this 
negotiation takes place, because only negotiation will succeed 
in restoring the necessary concord in this country. [words 
indistinct] 
  I had not reached that stage yet. Excuse me if I am speaking 
at length, but the subject lends itself to that. If in fact our 
partners -- whether American, European and even Russian -- 
refuse to do this, then it means that they do not wish to give 
the United Nations the means to accomplish its mission, and 
France has the greatest number of UN soldiers -- by far -- we 
have about 10,000 men out there. So, if they really do not wish 
to do that, then we will have to say that we do not accept a 
situation in which we are risking the lives of our soldiers for 
nothing. 
  [Amar] And on a larger scale, one rather has the impression 
that the United Nations, NATO, and the West as a whole are 
always lagging behind the pace of events to a certain extent, 
and that in the end the Bosnian Serbs are going to achieve what 
they wanted, in other words a real ethnic partition of the 
country. 
  [Mitterrand] One may fear this, one cannot say that you are 
wrong, but one has to see what the map of the different ethnic 
groups -- Croats, Serbs, and one cannot say it is an ethnic 
group, but the Muslim community -- in Bosnia looked like, to see 
that the Serbs, who are above all farmers, like the Croats on 
their side, have already occupied the largest part of the land 
and that the Muslims were concentrated, are concentrated, in the 
towns, so what people call the ethnic partition in this case 
would be quite disastrous. One cannot recognize a principle of 
this kind, but the real local situation is such that one has to 
take into account the fact that the towns and the countryside 
are not inhabited by the same groups. 
  [Amar] The Serbs there are generally spread beyond there. 
  [Mitterrand] Nor do we wish to confine ourselves to a Muslim 
Bosnia in which each of the towns would be separated from its 
neighbor, with territories between these towns which would be 
hostile and in a state of latent war. So, the negotiators have 
to divide up on the ground the regions in which the Muslim 
Bosnians, the Serb Bosnians or the Croat Bosnians are in the 
majority. This is what the negotiators have done, and they have 
acted properly, but they have not succeeded because the consent 
of the interested parties is required, and so far this has not 
been obtained. 
  [Amar] The international community managed to stop the 
invasion of Kuwait by Iraq, and it was a spectacular and 
successful operation. The international community at first 
intervened effectively in Somalia. Why has it not managed to 
halt the terrible massacres that have taken place recently in 
Rwanda? 
  [Mitterrand] Rwanda now. The situation is not the same. I 
don't want to make a speech about Iraq.... 
  [Amar, interrupting] No, no. I am asking about Rwanda. 
  [Mitterrand] [passage omitted] In Iraq there was a dictator 
with a strong army, in a country with a very clear structure, a 
very ancient and strong country, and once it had devoured 
Kuwait, Saudi Arabia would have been greatly threatened. How 
would Syria have resisted, how would Jordan have resisted -- all 
of them would have been dominated by Iraq. So then it would 
have become a power bordering on Israel. And you can see what 
sort of potentially explosive situation that would have been, 
what possibilities for conflict. If this had been in the time 
of the Soviet Union -- which still held solid not so long ago -- 
it could have meant a danger of total war. So you have to 
realize that precautions were taken there in the Middle East in 
the way that they were. 
  As for Rwanda, things are different. On a human level they 
are of the same kind. 
  [Poivre d'Arvor] There is talk of 200,000 dead. 
  [Mitterrand] There is talk of 200,000 dead. If you remember, 
this was a former Belgian colony, and Belgium has done a good 
job, and as a European country, has kept a sort -- not of 
tutelage over it, but let's rather say a sort of preferential 
association with Rwanda. But since it is a francophone country, 
France has constantly been called in to help. And we sent 
soldiers there, both to help to protect our compatriots living 
in Rwanda, and at the same time to protect Belgians and all the 
European nationalities there, who asked us to -- and that is 
what we did. 
  But we are not going to send an army to fight. It is not our 
job to fight everywhere, even when horror leaps into our faces. 
We don't have the means to do it, and our soldiers cannot be 
the international arbiters of the passions that today are 
shattering and tearing apart so many countries. 
  But -- let's be positive -- we are at the disposal of the 
United Nations. It was the United Nations took charge of this 
problem, but which, faced with the violence of the fighting and 
killing of the two presidents of Rwanda and Burundi, and the 
advance of the opposition movement based in neighboring Uganda 
-- because of ethnic affinities -- the United Nations withdrew, 
and it is not for us to replace it. That is not our role. We 
are at its disposal. We are willing to be good soldiers of 
peace for the United Nations. We have to be asked; it has to be 
organized; there have to be others with us. 
  [Amar] Mr. President, we can see, through this rapid review 
of the world situation, as this interview will last only one 
hour, that disorder is still prevailing, there is still fear and 
threats. At the moment when this fear and disorder still exist, 
you said a few days ago that France will not resume nuclear 
testing, neither today nor tomorrow? 
  [Mitterrand] No, wait, let's be precise so things are very 
clear. In my speech the other day on France's nuclear defense 
and nuclear deterrence, I announced a decision. This was my 
decision and it was about stopping nuclear tests. I took this 
decision and I informed Mr. Bush, who was President of the 
United States then, Mr. Major who was already prime minister of 
Britain, and Mr. Yeltsin who is the head of state of Russia. 
They said yes to me, we will stop, we will accept what is a 
so-called moratorium, that is, we will not carry out nuclear 
tests during a certain period of time. At the end of this 
period, Mr. Clinton wrote to me saying he would like us to 
extend the moratorium, that is extend the period during which no 
nuclear tests are carried out. I said yes immediately, of 
course, because this was in accordance with my position. A 
second request has recently been made by Mr. Clinton, which is a 
good idea, and we are slowly heading toward the cessation of 
nuclear tests. 
  [Poivre d'Arvor] And you added that nobody would do it after 
me. 
  [Mitterrand] That is why I said let's be precise. Stopping 
nuclear tests is a decision, it was mine and one of my 
prerogatives, thus it will be implemented as long as I am here 
except when it might be modified because one of our partners has 
gone back on his word and resumed nuclear testing, which would 
undermine our nuclear deterrence. But on the other hand, when I 
added, and I was not joking because it was not a laughing 
matter, with somehow a personal manner, perhaps even with humor, 
considering the protests that greeted my decision [sentence as 
heard]. There are some people who want us to carry on with 
nuclear testing even when there is no need for it. I said to 
them this is just an expectation; first there was a decision, 
now this is an expectation. I was addressing -- I don't know 
who -- my successors perhaps. 
  [Poivre d'Arvor] With those 800 guests, you did not seem to 
be joking, on the contrary, you seemed quite firm? 
  [Mitterrand] No, I said it was an expectation. I said: You 
will not do it because this [issue] will involve so many 
political and diplomatic issues, security considerations and the 
fact that at the same time other nations, except the five 
nuclear powers, are prevented from possessing nuclear weapons. 
We say we don't want nuclear proliferation and at the same time 
we do the contrary. This discourse is hard to sustain. I think 
it is a good thing for all the people of the world if these 
nuclear tests, that is these pollution-prone explosions, do not 
multiply. 
  [Amar] Mr. President, Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, 
expressed an opinion different from your own this morning. 
Francois Leotard said: These nuclear tests are necessary for 
technical reasons. Alain Juppe said: It is a major point of 
disagreement between the president of the republic and us. Can 
this major point of disagreement, to quote him, damage 
cohabitation until 1995? 
  [Mitterrand] It is a major point of disagreement. I informed 
the prime minister, the defense minister, the foreign minister, 
of my decision. I said: There will be no more nuclear testing 
as long as I am president. Naturally, the day when I am no 
longer there, those who succeed me will be completely free and 
this decision will be entirely theirs. I would add as a 
prediction, hypothesis, diagnostic, that I would be very 
surprised if they were to do this, because the conditions are 
difficult [as heard]. Very good. So, Mr. Balladur said 
something which is quite true -- we have a disagreement, but in 
this case it is the president who takes the decision. Well, I 
acted in accordance with my rights. 
  [Poivre d'Arvor] Right, we are going to talk about Europe 
now. 
  [Amar] Just a quick word on the subject of defense, because 
it is important. You said something else. You said that if on 
the occasion of the debate in parliament on the military 
programming law an amendment is introduced by the deputies 
concerning the possible use of nuclear force.... 
  [Mitterrand, interrupting] Amendments, yes. 
  [Amar] Or amendments, concerning the possible use of nuclear 
force outside the country to settle a conflict abroad, you would 
appeal to the people, in what way would you do this? 
  [Mitterrand] Because the decision is that of the president 
of 
the republic. Use of the atomic bomb, the atomic weapon first 
and foremost, is intended so that there will no war [as heard]. 
It is a deterrent weapon aimed at ensuring that war does not 
happen -- not to win it, because if one has a real force, as in 
France's case, one inspires so much fear, as a result of the 
destructive capacity of the nuclear bomb, that no one will make 
war on us. That is the doctrine and it absolutely must be 
preserved, but once one has said that, one has to be logical 
with oneself, it does not mean that one must stockpile weapons, 
make nuclear weapons, when one does not need more, or act in 
such a way that all the other countries rush to outdo one 
another and the world ends up going up in flames. 
  [Amar] Does making an appeal to the people mean a referendum 
on this matter? 
  [Mitterrand] This means that on such a serious matter, which 
I have attempted to define as quickly as I can, if parliament or 
the government were involved in a serious disagreement with me, 
yes, I would ask the people to settle the matter. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Amar] There is a European country which has just changed 
its 
leaders, namely Italy. Silvio Berlusconi is the new prime 
minister. 
  [Mitterrand] So I'm told. 
  [Amar] If neofascist ministers are appointed in his 
government, how will you react? 
  [Mitterrand] I think -- this is an embarrassing question, 
because the problem is embarrassing, but I think that the first 
right to be respected is that of a democratic people, a 
democratic regime -- which is the case in Italy. It is important 
to maintain the sovereignty of this people. It has given many 
votes to the neofascist party, which will probably be -- which 
may already be --represented in Mr. Berlusconi's government. 
  [Poivre d'Arvor] This is happening right now because the 
prime minister is submitting his list to the president. 
  [Mitterrand] Personally, I am not happy about it, but I 
acknowledge the Italians' right to choose, all the more so 
because the neofascist party does not have a majority and I 
don't think that this party can determine Italian politics. 
However, it will play a role, it is a pity. We must educate, 
advise, speak to the Italians in a friendly way. I believe that 
it would not make sense to say to them: We forbid. This is my 
feeling. Of course, if this party made enough progress to have 
a majority or to control Italian politics from afar, there would 
undoubtedly be some problems. 
  [Poivre d'Arvor] You would not mind meeting some of these 
ministers, would you? 
  [Mitterrand] Would I not mind? I do not feel at all [changes 
thought], we will see, I would be surprised if Mr. Berlusconi 
was ill-advised enough to appoint a neofascist as the foreign 
minister, for instance. I would be really surprised. If he 
did, he would make a major mistake, but, well, I would only meet 
the prime minister, namely Mr. Berlusconi.... 
  [Poivre d'Arvor, interrupting] For whom you do not feel any 
special repulsion, do you? 
  [Mitterand] I do not feel any repulsion. I feel neither 
attraction nor repulsion. Now that he is the prime minister of 
a friendly country, I will be very reserved in my remarks. 
However, as far as the foreign minister is concerned, it is 
essential that he should be a convinced democrat since he will 
have to build the Europe created by the Maastricht Treaty with 
us. [passage omitted] 
  [Amar] How long do you think your successor should be at the 
Elysee, five years? Seven years? A two five-year term or a two 
seven-year term? I ask the question because Valery Giscard 
d'Estaing has relaunched the idea of a five-year presidential 
term. What is your opinion? 
  [Mitterrand] Mr. Giscard d'Estaing is in favor of a 
five-year 
presidential term. He succeeded Mr. Pompidou who initiated a 
constitutional reform bill passed by the parliament. All that 
was necessary was to submit the issue to referendum but Mr. 
Giscard d'Estaing did not do it. 
  [Poivre d'Arvor] But you could have done it yourself? 
  [Mitterrand] Yes, I could have, yes I could have! I was not 
in favor of the five-year presidential term. Two years before 
the presidential elections of 1981, I was in favor of a system 
that seemed better to me but which I find difficult to defend 
today. I tell you this in confidence: I was in favor of a 
single seven-year presidential term. I feel embarrassed today. 
If my successor would like to do it, I think he would be right 
ro do so. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Thierry Portes: "Official Launch of the </F>
Majority's Campaign: `A Europe of Peace and Employment'"] 
  [Text] The La Villette Science and Industry Park, the 
Eurotunnel, the day after the anniversary of the World War II 
victory, this day of Europe. Yesterday, the candidates on 
Dominique Baudis' UDF [French Democratic Union]-RPR [Rally for 
the Republic] list for the European elections often referred to 
symbolic events during the official launch of their campaign for 
"a Europe of peace and employment." 
  It was under the model of a satellite, between models of the 
Ariane rocket and the IFREMER [French Institute for the 
Exploitation of the Sea] submarine Nautilus, that the 
representatives of the majority list met in the La Villette 
Science Park late in the morning. Dominique Baudis, who never 
forgets that he is mayor of Toulouse, did not fail to praise the 
success of the Ariane and European aerospace projects. After 
the praise, he regretted the fact that there are only four 
researchers for every 1,000 workers in Europe, compared with 
eight in the United States and nine in Japan. 
  In his view, therefore, Europe's future depends on an 
increase in the effort to promote research and on strengthening 
cooperation among European nations. Since individual member 
countries would not be able to withstand this budget strain, who 
other than the Twelve in a joint effort could help the 40 
nuclear power stations of the Chernobyl type which are currently 
operating in the former Soviet empire? Similarly, in the race 
against the AIDS virus, he pointed out, "we will win more 
quickly if the Twelve work together." 
  Christian Jacob who, in taking fourth place on the majority 
list, has taken leave from his role as president of the National 
Union of Young Farmers, took the opportunity yesterday to assert 
that the agricultural world is also "enthusiastic," and places 
its future in the European impetus. 
  "The world is dangerous and France needs all the strength of 
Europe for its security and the security of French people," 
Dominique Baudis said. Although European security depends on 
employment, the fight against AIDS and countering nuclear 
dangers in the former Soviet bloc, this security must obviously 
be based on the limitation or even banning of old conflicts. 
<H5>  New Beginning </H5>
  After employment, the mayor of Toulouse turned to the second 
theme of his campaign: A Europe of peace. The day after the 
celebrations to commemorate 8 May 1945, it was easy for him to 
reaffirm that developing European unity was begun after World 
War II in the hope of preventing further conflicts among the 
European nations. The war in Bosnia, Mr. Baudis stated, is there 
to remind us that nothing is ever fully achieved and that the 
ambition of the early Europeans -- Robert Schuman and Jean 
Monnet -- should not to be abandoned. Helene Carrere 
d'Encausse, the number two of Dominique Baudis' list, took up 
this subject, stressing that in East Europe the victory over the 
Nazis was won one day later, on 9 May 1945 when the Soviets 
entered Berlin. The academician, who is an expert on Russia and 
the "other Europe," wanted to regard this one-day "lag" behind 
the West as a symbol too. 
  This original lag must now be made good and "Europe must be 
expanded," she explained, expansion in her view being "the fruit 
of the miracle of the collapse of the Berlin Wall." In "this 
Europe which needs to be rethought," Mrs. Carrere d'Encausse 
said, "France must play a decisive role" to remain faithful to 
the French founders of European unity and to the historical ties 
which bind our nation to the countries of East Europe. She 
cited the example of the Pact for Stability in Europe, which is 
so dear to Edouard Balladur, and stressed that France should now 
make "a new beginning" on this path of peace. "Our united 
list," Mr. Baudis also said, "is not focused on certain past 
divisions." Following this reference to the debate between 
supporters and opponents of the Maastricht Treaty, he stated 
that his "role" and that of his fellow candidates on the list 
"is not to be the advocates of the Brussels administration to 
the French people, but to be the French representatives in the 
Strasbourg Parliament in order to control Brussels more 
effectively." 
  Jean-Louis Debre, the deputy secretary general of the RPR, 
once again stated that "the RPR unreservedly supports" the 
campaign led by Dominique Baudis. "It is a young team which is 
not focused on the past and which transcends the divisions of 
the past," he emphasized, addressing the Maastricht opponents 
within the RPR ranks. It was left to Yves Galland, president of 
the Liberal caucus in Strasbourg, to more specifically name the 
majority list's opponent: the Socialists. 
  In particular he criticized the Socialist European deputies 
for systematically defending the Commission's regulatory powers. 
In the UDF and RPR, Mr. Galland declared, "we do not want an 
administrative Europe which interferes with and wants to have a 
say on everything."

[passage omitted] 
  There were few surprises; most of the names had been the 
subject of speculation for many days. Furthermore, as 
Berlusconi left, he defended the amount of time that was 
necessary in order to form the government which he stressed 
would be a political one. He said that its first task will be to 
re-launch the economy, although the unemployment problem will 
not be forgotten. [passage omitted] 
  Berlusconi will return here tomorrow morning at 1100 in 
order 
to be sworn in along with his ministers. 
  That is all from the Quirinale Palace.

  [Text] Portuguese President Mario Soares said in an 
interview that he will be pleading with Jonas Savimbi to accept 
a cease-fire compromise proposed by Angolan President Jose 
Eduardo dos Santos. Mario Soares stated that he took the 
opportunity at the Pretoria ceremony, where some 50 heads of 
state and the UN secretary general were gathered, to debate a 
number of international policy issues, particularly the urgent 
need for peace in southern Africa. He also stated that the 
urgency of a cease-fire in Angola was the main theme of talks he 
held with Butrus-Ghali and Presidents Joaquim Chissano and 
Eduardo dos Santos. In brief, President Soares' line of 
thought, shared by all those he spoke to, is that South Africa's 
example of a transition agreement based on a national unity 
government formula will have to be followed in Maputo and in 
Luanda. It was on the basis of these talks that Soares will be 
contacting Savimbi to further the Angolan peace effort.

  [Excerpt] The Spanish Foreign Ministry has repeats its 
advice to Spaniards residing in Algeria asking them to leave the 
country. It also asks those who are planning to travel to 
Algeria to refrain from doing so because of the violence 
unleashed against foreigners. 
  A spokesperson for the Diplomatic Information Office said 
that after the last attacks on foreigners in Algeria, this 
ministry recommends that Spaniards residing in Algeria leave the 
country if their presence there is not essential. 
  The approximately 300 Spanish residents in Algeria, however, 
should contact the Spanish Embassy in Algiers if they have not 
done so yet. 
  The Diplomatic Information Office added that due to the 
repeated acts of violence against foreigners the advice 
recommending that people not travel to Algeria is still valid 
specially if they have no pressing reason for going there.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Generational Change Imminent for </F>
Employers"] 
  [Text] Nuuk -- The big construction jobs will require new 
thinking on the part of Greenland employers in the years ahead. 
  What does an employer in Greenland look like? 
  If one regards the Greenland Employers Association delegates 
who met in Nuuk last weekend as representative of the typical 
employer, one of the answers is that he is a Danish skilled 
worker who has built up his own firm from scratch since the 
1960's and 1970's. Now he is in his fifties or sixties and has 
begun to look around for a successor. 
  But that is easier said than done. 
  The unfavorable times and the chronic lack of well-trained 
labor in Greenland have made it almost impossible to sell the 
small firms. 
  One of the routes leading to the necessary changing of the 
guard may be increased cooperation among the individual owners 
of small firms along the coast. 
  However this requires new thinking and flexibility on the 
part of the members of the Greenland Employers Association. 
<H5>  Analysis </H5>
  And these were the very qualities the chairman of the 
association, director Erik Norskov of Qaqortoq, called for in 
his address to the delegates' meeting in Nuuk. 
  Therefore the employers association has entered into a 
cooperative agreement with the home-rule-owned Greenland Base 
Company on an extensive industrial analysis that will chart all 
of Greenland's trade and industry. 
  "The analysis is aimed at trying to create a clear picture 
of 
what the business sector really has at its disposal in the way 
of materiel, manpower, and economic resources in order to ensure 
Greenland firms the greatest possible participation when the 
very large construction projects that have been planned are 
realized in the years ahead," Norskov said. 
  "The analysis will be a good tool for continued industrial 
development and therefore the Greenland Employers Association is 
disappointed that many firms are keeping their cards close to 
their chests. The analysis is trying to involve 450 firms in all 
branches, but at present only 120 firms have responded." 
  At the meeting of delegates doubts were raised about the 
impartiality of the Greenland Base Company as a home-rule-owned 
enterprise when private firms lay all their cards on the table 
and talk about their innermost secrets. 
  Norskov was not afraid to open up and talk about his firm's 
prospects and he urged the other members of the association to 
do the same. 
  "If we are to participate in the big construction jobs, such 
as airplane runways on the coast, cooperation is an urgent 
necessity," he said. "Otherwise our members risk seeing the work 
go to outside consortia." 
<H5>  Hands Off! </H5>
  "The economy is still weak in Greenland with record-high 
unemployment and declining exports," Norskov noted. 
  Even so, restrained industrial policy optimism prevails in 
the employers association. The breakup of KNI [Greenland Trade 
Production, Transportation and Distribution] and the 
restructuring of the last of the old GTO [Greenland Technical 
Organization] organizations has made the economy clearer just as 
a market economic point of reference based on freer and more 
open competition has been created. 
  "But we are still a long way from a totally free market 
economy," Norskov noted. 
  "The political system still keeps the big state-owned firms 
under tight control. It is to a large extent the politicians who 
dominate company boards of directors and control the firms on 
the basis of political rather than sober business management 
considerations. This hampers a commercial firm that has to 
compete on the basis of efficiency and at the same time it 
hinders free and natural price formation, and in a number of 
situations the political influence can create competitive 
distortions. 
  "Therefore the politicians should seriously consider 
following the market economy intentions all the way, withdrawing 
from direct firm management and leaving it to the 
professionals," said Erik Norskov, chairman of the Greenland 
Employers Association.

  [Text] The tense atmosphere that has been created in the 
chain of command of the Turkish Armed Forces by President 
Suleyman Demirel's opposition to the extension of the term of 
office of General Dogan Gures, chief of the General Staff, is 
continuing. The commanding officers of the military forces met 
and assessed the situation in the General Staff headquarters 
yesterday. 
  Considering Gen. Gures' determined opposition to the 
extension of his term of office, the military forces are 
convinced that Gen. Ismail Hakki Karadayi will be appointed the 
new chief of the General Staff. The summit of the commanders in 
Elmadag, the day before yesterday, continued in the General 
Staff headquarters yesterday. Gen. Gures; Gen. Ismail Hakki 
Karadayi, commander of the Grand Forces; Admiral Vural Bayazit, 
commander of the Naval Forces; Gen. Halis Burhan, commander of 
the Air Force; Gen. Aydin Ilter, general commander of the 
Gendarmerie Forces; and Gen. Ahmet Corekci, deputy chief of the 
General Staff, met at 1600 and conferred for nearly one and a 
half hours. 
  Sources close to the General Staff have said that Gen. Gures 
reiterated that his term of office will end on 30 August. The 
same sources said that they discussed a way to surmount the 
obstacle President Demirel has created against the extension of 
the services of the commanders of the Air Force and the Naval 
Forces. The term of office of the two commanders will end in 
1994.

  [Text] Unal Erkan, state of emergency region governor, has 
announced that 150 terrorists were killed and 50 terrorists were 
captured in operations conducted in the state of emergency 
region in the past week. 
  Addressing the inauguration of the communications satellite 
ground station in Batman's Sason District, Erkan declared that 
the terrorist organization has reached the point of collapse as 
a result of the assistance the regional population has extended 
to the security forces in their joint struggle against 
terrorism. Pointing out that the number of terrorists 
surrendering to the security forces is increasing, despite the 
groundless propaganda that terrorists who surrender are 
mistreated, Erkan explained that the organization's sources of 
income from narcotics smuggling have also been wiped out.

  [Text] Ankara--Discussion about the operation carried out 
by the Turkish Army in Northern Iraq on April 12, and 
suggestions that it was unsuccessful, have not lasted long. 
  The economic stabilization package and the controversy over 
the formation of new government have caused the Kurdish question 
to be temporarily forgotten. But the conflict has not come to a 
halt. On the contrary, the number of confrontations has 
increased. Following the decisions taken during the PKK's Third 
National Conference, it is clear that the army is determined to 
finish the matter by the end of the summer by means of an 
all-out war. But the outlawed Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK) 
also decided to declare all-out war in March. These decisions 
have created impassable obstacles to democratic or political 
solutions and have also signalled that the year 1994 will be of 
crucial importance in the history of this question. Statements 
issuing both from the army and from the PKK suggest that there 
will be a further escalation of violence and that more blood 
will be shed before the end of the summer. 
  As of April, parallel to the operations initiated by the 
army, there has been an increases in PKK activities. Meanwhile, 
the unsolved murders which have become characteristic of the 
Southeast region have suddenly begun to increase. We mentioned 
in our previous articles that the PKK had launched some 
diplomatic initiatives as part of its strategy, primarily in an 
attempt to get European countries to put forward proposals for a 
solution, and that the PKK was waiting for the outcome of these 
initiatives. The period of waiting is about to end.... It has 
been impossible to get a definitive report on the result of the 
operations which the Turkish army has launched against the PKK. 
Both army and PKK sources claimed to have inflicted heavy 
casualties--a familiar tactic. The army has announced that 4500 
PKK militants have been eradicated, and that camps like Shive, 
Haftanin and Mezi have been destroyed and are unusable. However 
it is a known fact that the PKK had not used those camps 
following the operations carried out by the army in 1992. 
  In other words, the army had launched assaults on 
uninhabited 
camps. Meanwhile, according to the reports received from the 
region, minor clashes only have taken place and not the 
large-scale engagement that has been spoken of. The PKK 
militants have managed to protect themselves with hit-and-run 
tactics and their losses have not matched what was claimed by 
the army. 
  The PKK have also boasted of major successes in order to 
establish a psychological superiority. They claim to have 
killed 630 soldiers, of whom 30 were ranking officers. Their 
statements also reported that many tanks had been destroyed and 
that a number of helicopters had been shot down. 
  While the army and the PKK both continue to come up with 
false statistics, it is at least clear that the army has failed 
to get the results it was looking for from its cross-border 
operations. It also seems that talk about the creation of 
buffer zones was mistaken because a significant proportion of 
the forces moved to the region have since been withdrawn. 
However airborne operations are still being carried out, and 
statements insist that the PKK will be finished until the end of 
summer. The army has now to come to terms with the fact that a 
package of democratic reforms is in preparation. Following the 
press coverage of the telephone conversation between Prime 
Minister Tansu Ciller and True Party (DYP) ministers Necmettin 
Cevheri and Bekir Sami Dace, it has also been made public that 
the term of office of the chief of General Staff, Gen. Dogan 
Gures, will be extended for another year and that Ciller and 
Gures have agreed on a democratization package. It's clear that 
the democratization package that the Social Democrat People's 
Party (SHP) had earlier announced contains only proposals made 
some time previously. What is important here is the fact that 
the chief of general staff has agreed with the prime minister 
about the preparation of a democratization package. The prime 
minister has also announced that the deputy prime minister, 
Murat Karayalcin, also supports the package. 
  It is quite evident that 1994 will be critical for the 
Kurdish question. But it is also certain that the army will not 
be able to finish off the PKK this summer. Democratic reforms 
prepared in such circumstances will not be workable, and a 
package worked out jointly with the army does not look like a 
genuine remedy for anything. 
  It is not a prediction to say that violence will further 
increase, because the army has already launched an all-out war, 
and so has the PKK. Meanwhile, within the last month, incidents 
such as unsolved murders and the abduction or execution of 
citizens have increased. A considerable number of people have 
also lost their lives in mine blasts. 
  Within the PKK organization, hardliners have completely 
taken 
control. Despite PKK Leader Abdullah Ocalan's calls for peace 
and his instructions that soldiers should not be attacked, the 
decisions taken at the PKK's 3rd National Conference are 
designed to escalate the violence. 
  The most important decision taken at the conference, which 
met between March 5 and March 15, 1994 is "to stage all-out 
revolutionary war in response to the enemy's all-out war of 
destruction." In order to organize the guerrilla forces better, 
those who attended the conference decided to establish a general 
staff. This signalled that the hardliners in the organization 
have gained strength and that the violence will increase further 
in the near future. 
  The most important decisions of the Third National 
Conference 
may be summarized as follows: "The struggle which the PKK 
carries out has left the stage of strategic defense and entered 
that of strategic balance. It is inevitable that we escalate 
our struggle in response to Turkey's declaration of all-out war. 
Consequently, all economic, political, military, social and 
cultural organizations, institutions, formations -- and those 
who serve in them -- have become targets. The entire country 
has become the battlefield." 
  With the decision for centralizing the military structure of 
the PKK under a general staff, the PKK aims to build a popular 
army 50,000 strong. The front line now includes the western 
regions and the PKK has decided to allow the members of the 
National Liberation Front (ERNK) to take part in the action. 
Even this decision on its own can be interpreted as meaning 
that the violence will now escalate, because ERNK members were 
previously confined to support services, propaganda and 
logistics. 
  Striking at various military and economic targets will now 
also involve ERNK members, who are primarily based on 
metropolitan areas. 
  It was further decided at the Third National Conference to 
set up state assemblies and state governments and to establish a 
separate judiciary in mainly Kurdish areas. 
  Other targets and aims were also listed at the conference: 
"The liquidation of all parties and associations which represent 
imperialism. Putting out of action all radio and TV channels, 
newspapers and magazines which are the tools of special warfare. 
The liquidation of imperialist cultural and educational 
organizations in various forms. The liquidation of all the 
legislative and executive organizations and representative 
offices of the Turkish republic. Rendering the judicial system 
inoperable. Eliminating all local collaborators and agents 
working for the Republic of Turkey in Kurdistan. "All the 
financial organizations and institutions which finance the dirty 
war which the Turkish republic is waging in our country. Under 
the heading are included tourist facilities, mines, oil 
pipelines, power stations, factories, the arms industry, 
transportation and communications systems, and economic 
organizations both large and small. Their destruction and 
expropriation is what is important. The entire army, which is 
the basic instrument of imperialism in Kurdistan, is a target. 
All the special units, special teams, counter-guerrilla units 
and village guards are targets. All the internal security 
units, the police force, the National Intelligence Organization 
(MIT) and civilian defense units are also targets." In view of 
these decisions, it is likely that attacks in the western 
regions will be aimed increasingly at tourist centers and 
certain economic facilities. It is likely, too, that as the 
ERNK become involved in front-line activities, violent and 
bloody actions will be seen in the cities. This, in turn, will 
make the possibility of a political solution recede even 
further. Both sides have committed themselves to violent 
solutions. One side will have to admit defeat by the end of the 
year. Which one is as yet unknown...

<F P=106> [Report by Sinan Yilmaz] </F>
  [Text] Ankara--Members of the pro-Kurdish Democracy Party 
(DEP), closure of which is being considered by the 
Constitutional Court, are said to have speeded up the process 
towards founding a new party. 
  DEP members are saying that a new party should still be 
formed and the two could merge if the DEP is not closed down. 
Meanwhile work is also reported to be underway for the 
establishment of another party to represent Kurdish interests. 
A group of Kurdish intellectuals, led by former minister 
Serafettin Elci, who are said to believe in the need for another 
legal Kurdish party, have reportedly stepped up preparations 
with this aim in mind. Elci has left for Germany to gather 
support for this venture, sources have told the TURKISH DAILY 
NEWS. 
  The case against the DEP at the Constitutional Court is 
expected to be concluded by the end of May. Pending the result, 
DEP administrators have redoubled their efforts to found a new 
party so as not to be left in the political wilderness. The 
name of the new party, to be announced in the coming days, is 
expected to be the "Democratic People's Party," while its 
ideology will be based on establishing solidarity between 
Turkish workers and the Kurdish people and support for 
democratization. 
  The party aims to garner mass support by promoting working 
class interests, giving it a leftist tendency. 
  It is also being reported that an agreement appears about to 
be reached with supporters of the Kurdistan Socialist Party 
(PSK), who were previously DEP members, on the subject of the 
new party. 
  The PSK members are expected to join the new party once it 
is 
founded. The PSK, which is led by Kemal Burkay, has strong 
support from within DEP. 
  A commission headed by DEP's deputy chairman and deputy for 
Van, Remzi Kartal, has been established to oversee preparations 
for the foundation of the new party. 
  The commission also aims to invite Turkish intellectuals 
into 
the party. Well known names such as Ismail Besikci, Fikret 
Baskaya, Ragip Zarakolu, Ertugrul Kurkcu, Haluk Gerger and the 
eminent writer Yasar Kemal are to be contacted in the coming 
days with this aim in mind. 
  Leftist groups not represented by political parties, certain 
union leaders and the chairmen of various associations will also 
be contacted in this context. 
  The party's program will soon be completed sources say, 
adding that the main component will be the emphasis on 
"brotherhood and humanism." 
  The fact that the supporters of the Kurdistan Democrat Party 
(PDK-Hevgirtin) [Solidarity] and supporters of the Rizgari 
[Freedom] group within the DEP will not join the new party is 
also among information being received. 
  Meanwhile, former Public Works and Housing Minister 
Serafettin Elci is also working for the foundation of a legal 
Kurdish party. 
  Prominent Kurds like Mehmet Ali Aslan, Mehmet ali Eren, 
Tarik 
Ziya Ekinci are working with Elci on this project. This party, 
which will contain the word "Kurdish" in its name, will pursue a 
conciliatory line and will ask for certain cultural rights with 
a view to solving Turkey's Kurdish problem. The people working 
for the establishment of this party are said to be also in close 
contact with the Iraq Kurdistan Democrat Party (IKDP) of Mas'ud 
Barzani. 
  Elci is said to have contacted certain DEP members regarding 
the new party but without positive results. 
  However, other reports say that DEP's Central Executive 
Board 
member Resit Deli welcomed the idea of a new party when 
approached by Elci. 
  Elci has also contacted the former People's Labor Party 
(HEP) 
former chairman Feridun Yazar but Yazar is said to have argued 
that Kurds of different views should belong to different parties. 
  Elci has also had inconclusive talks with another HEP former 
chairman, Fehmi Isiklar, and DEP general administrative board 
member Altan Tan regarding his proposed new party. It is being 
claimed that Serafettin Elci is trying to establish a position 
as the head of a legal Kurdish party in order to be accepted as 
the spokesman for the Kurds when a more conciliatory tone is 
struck between the two sides on Turkey's Kurdish issue. 
  The Rizgari group and PDK-Hevgirtin are listed among 
political groups supporting Elci. 
  Another important detail concerning the foundation of new 
pro-Kurdish parties is the cautious approach of certain DEP 
members to the whole issue. 
  Diyarbakir deputy Sedat Yurttas and certain other deputies 
are said to be distancing themselves from the preparations for 
the foundation of new parties. 
  They are said to have adopted a wait-and-see attitude.

  [Text] Istanbul, May 9 (A.A.) -- Energy Minister Veysel 
Atasoy, who returned to Turkey after concluding his visit to 
Egypt, on Monday [9 May] said that Turkey aims for an output 300 
billion kilowatt hours of electricity by the year 2010. 
  Speaking to reporters at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport, he said 
that during the meetings in Cairo the inter-connection system 
between Turkey, Syria, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt was discussed and 
the project agreement signed in 1989 is in the construction 
stage. 
  He said the agreement has been put on hold because of the 
Gulf crisis, adding that the first part of the project, 
stretching between Turkey, Syria and Jordan, according to the 
agreement signed in Cairo last week, will be operational in 1997. 
  The second part, foreseeing the link between Syria and Iraq 
will be in service in 1998. 
  `With this system, all five countries' electrical systems 
will be linked to one another,' he said. 
  Atasoy also said that the total value of the project is 620 
million U.S. dollars, of which 396 million dollars will be 
provided from the Arab Fund, adding 167 miles (270 kms) of the 
system between Egypt and Jordan will be constructed by Turkey. 
  He said while energy is being produced, the environment 
should not be polluted and the ideal for this is hydroelectric 
and natural gas plants, adding Turkey plans to construct two 
electric plants.

Better Within the EU"] 
  [Text] Linz -- A majority of 60 percent of Austrians 
believe "that Austria will in the future be better able to solve 
its tasks as a member of the European Union [EU]." A total of 
38 percent represent the opposite thesis. This is the result of 
an opinion poll carried out by the Market opinion research 
institute in April for the Europe Barometer of DER STANDARD. 
  According to the poll, younger Austrians are particularly 
confident: A total of 65 percent of those under 30 believe that 
Austria's interests will be well looked after in the EU; the 
results are similar in the higher education and income groups. 
  Even among declared followers of the Freedom Party of 
Austria 
[FPOe], a 54-percent majority holds the view that Austria could 
solve its problems better within the EU. Among farmers, 
however, the opinion continues to predominate that Austria 
should not join the EU.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Currently No Need To Join </F>
Partnership for Peace"] 
  [Excerpt] At present, Chancellor Franz Vranitzky sees no 
need to join NATO's Partnership for Peace program. As the 
chancellor explained after the cabinet meeting yesterday, 
Austria is already practicing this partnership in numerous areas. 
  Bilateral cooperation agreements in the military sphere 
concerning the training of peacekeeping and humanitarian 
measures have been concluded with Eastern European states. In 
addition, Austria participates in various NATO committees. 
Thus, Austria is more advanced in this development than Sweden 
and Finland, which have now signed a partnership agreement with 
NATO, Vranitzky stated. At present, Austria wants to concentrate 
primarily on the referendum and Austrian measures linked to 
membership of the European Union [EU]. "In a later phase" 
Austria will again deal specifically with this partnership. The 
decisions by Sweden and Finland do not force Austria to change 
its planned procedure, particularly because both states 
explicitly stressed that they are not joining the Alliance, 
Vranitzky emphasized. A definite answer cannot yet be given 
concerning Austria's participation in a European security 
system. The outcome of the 1996 EU intergovernmental 
conference, during which basic decision on the structures of a 
future security system will be made, must be awaited. Of 
course, Austria is basically interested in such a system. 
  In addition to passing laws, Vranitzky wants to discuss the 
adaptation measures for EU membership that are required in 
Austria with those that will be affected by them. Thus, next 
Monday [16 May] Vranitzky will meet with trade union 
representatives of those areas where structural problems are 
expected to occur. This will particularly affect the food 
sector, the mills, and the sugar industry. Not only financial 
support but the safeguarding of jobs will be discussed.

<F P=106> [Report by Semih D. Idiz] </F>
  [Text] Ankara--The allied force deployed in Turkey under 
"Operation Provide Comfort," for protecting Northern Iraqi 
Kurds, should go because it sets a precedent for countries such 
as Russia to intervene in other areas, a senior Iranian official 
said on Wednesday [4 May]. 
  First Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammad Hashemi, brother of 
Iranian president Hashemi-Rafsanjani, added that there was no 
longer a risk of Iraqi aggression because it had lost its 
economic and military strength and was alone in the world today. 
  Hashemi, answering questions by the TURKISH DAILY NEWS and 
the daily HURRIYET after two days of political consultations in 
Ankara with his Turkish counterpart, Foreign Ministry 
Undersecretary Ozdem Sanberk, also said that the deployment of 
foreign troops in Turkey could lead to regional crises but did 
not elaborate. 
  On the Bosnian question Hashemi said that Turkey and Iran 
had 
to work together to seek a way for Islamic countries to send 
arms to the Bosnian Muslims, who are faced with murder while 
international organizations such as the United Nations and NATO 
simply looked on. 
  Referring to his contacts in Ankara, Hashemi said that this 
was his first visit abroad after his appointment as First Deputy 
Foreign Minister and suggested that this signalled the 
importance his country attached to Turkey. 
  He said that the need for enhancing economic, commercial and 
industrial ties between the two countries was one of the 
bilateral topics discussed at the Ankara talks. 
  Hashemi said that the sides had also agreed on the need to 
enhance cultural ties which have been noticeably low in the past. 
  Indicating that security matters were among the priority 
issues discussed when taking up bilateral issues, Hashemi said 
the cooperation in this sphere between Iran and Turkey "had 
reached the desired level." 
  "The Turkish side has thanked Iran for its close interest in 
this area. They are happy that we have returned PKK [Kurdish 
Workers Party] militants to Turkey and I will convey their 
satisfaction in this area to Iran" he said. 
  Hashemi was referring to the recent extradition of militants 
of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is 
fighting a separatist war in southeast Anatolia, and which has 
used Iranian territory as a refuge and a base for mounting 
attacks against Turkey. 
  Hashemi also said that they had agreed during the talks on 
the need to increase the number of high level contacts between 
the two countries in the security field. 
  Pointing out that Iraq was one of the topics discussed at 
great length, Hashemi said that the two countries agreed that 
the territorial integrity of Iraq had to be preserved. Hashemi 
indicated that there was a consultative mechanism between 
Turkey, Iran and Syria for assessing developments in Iraq and 
Northern Iraq. 
  "We are bothered by the presence of foreigners in the 
region. 
This problem can only be solved with the participation of 
regional countries. The problem can not be solved without 
Turkey and Iran" Hashemi said, making a clear reference to 
Operation Provide Comfort. 
  He added that Iran also wanted to see more contacts and 
more activity between his country, Turkey and Syria under the 
"triple mechanism" set up to discuss Iraq. He said that Tehran 
wanted to have these contacts not just at the level of foreign 
ministers as has been the case to date but also at other levels. 
Asked how the deterrence provided by Provide Comfort could be 
replaced if this force left Turkey, Hashemi said "they had their 
serious doubts" about this whole matter. 
  He said that if foreign forces are to be deployed in the 
region, as they have been in Turkey, then this could set a 
precedent for countries such as Russia to intervene in other 
areas. 
  "Although the Soviet Union has gone, today's Russia has 
pulled itself together militarily and has significant military 
power at its disposal. It comes out in the press from time to 
time that Russia wants to intervene in Azerbaijan, and it has 
intervened in Tajikistan" Hashemi said, clearly reflecting his 
country's concern about developments in the former Soviet Union. 
Hashemi also said that "public opinion" was also opposed to the 
presence of foreign troops in the region although he did not 
mention which country's public opinion he was referring to. "If 
public opinion does not want to see foreign soldiers in the 
region, then this means that whatever foreign troops there are 
in the region are there by force" he said. 
  Hashemi added that they saw "no necessity for these forces 
to 
be in the region." 
  "If we look at Iraq today it is no longer the Iraq of seven 
or eight years ago. Both economically and in terms of its 
military power Iraq is in a difficult situation today. It does 
not have its old power. Apart from this, eight years ago Iraq 
used to receive international assistance from many countries. 
Many countries would supply it with arms and many countries, 
such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, would give it financial 
assistance. But today this support does not exist. Iraq has 
been left on its own" he said. 
  Hashemi added that Iraq had failed to get what it wanted 
after eight or nine years of fighting with Iran as it had failed 
to secure anything from its attack on Kuwait. 
  "So Iraq has lost its strength and contrary to what is 
thought and claimed, it cannot rise and threaten the region 
again. Especially not when there is a strong Turkey next to it 
on one side and Iran on the other." 
  He said because of this they saw no need for foreign forces 
in the region. 
  "The presence of foreign forces, in my opinion, has also 
caused concerns in Turkey. We are aware of these concerns. I 
think the presence of these foreign forces can in the future 
leave the region facing problems. They can force a crisis in 
the region. I think their presence there, rather than acting as 
a deterrent is for creating problems in order to lead the region 
into a crisis." 
  Hashemi also said that Iraq country was suffering greatly 
from the U.N. imposed embargo and this necessitated the lifting 
of the embargo. 
  He underscored, however, that it was incumbent on 
Iraq--whose 
policies he said had destabilized the region by its great 
mistakes--to comply with U.N. resolutions for the embargo to be 
lifted. Referring to the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan 
Hashemi said that Armenian forces which had invaded Azeri 
territory had to withdraw immediately. 
  Reflecting the ongoing tension between Tehran and Yerevan 
because of the recent downing of an Iranian plane over the 
enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, allegedly by Armenians, Hashemi 
referred to Armenian attacks in the region as "brutal." He said 
that these were the results of a plan of "those enemies of Islam 
who are against stability in the region" but did not elaborate 
on the countries whose plan this was. Hashemi said that there 
was a need to solve the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan 
over Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave within Azerbaijan, by means of 
the mediation of countries that both sides could trust. 
  Asked if he thought recent positive developments in ties 
between Turkey and Iran--which have often been strained in the 
past--were due to a convergence of regional interests forcing 
the two countries into a "strategic relationship" Hashemi said, 
"I agree with your assessment on this." 
  He said that both Iran and Turkey were important countries 
in 
the region and they were working together for regional economic 
and political stability.

<F P=106> [Andreas Anzenberger report: "There Is No Security </F>
Guarantee Without Anything in Return"] 
  [Text] The outlines of a possible European security system 
are emerging: Sweden and Finland joined NATO's Partnership for 
Peace program on Monday [9 May]. Switzerland is also 
considering taking this step. At the same time, the Western 
European Union (defense alliance of the European Union) offered 
cooperation agreements to the East European states. 
  Austria might turn into a blank space on the 
security-political map of Europe. These issues were mainly 
discussed during the official visit to the United States by 
General Troop Inspector Karl Majcen last week. 
  The Austrian Government has decided in favor of a "pragmatic 
path," which is being understood in the United States, Majcen 
pointed out. In spite of a "generally benevolent and positive 
assessment of the Partnership for Peace concept," Austria "does 
not want to join it officially" for the time being. 
  Instead, cooperation "will be expanded in the spheres where 
we possess expert knowledge" -- that is, in peacekeeping 
missions and disaster control, the general announced. A common 
basis for that exists already: At the NATO Coordination 
Council, a planning group deals exclusively with such 
activities; Austria is a participant, despite its international 
status as a neutral country. 
  In addition, contacts with neighboring countries like 
Hungary 
in the sphere of military training are to be intensified. 
  The question as to who organizes the peacekeeping operations 
is of secondary importance, Majcen stated. Austria will 
participate "without looking under whose auspices they are 
taking place." 
  Majcen made it clear that there can be no security guarantee 
without any specific return service. 
  The NATO states would not tolerate efforts by a country to 
"obtain a security guarantee as it were via membership in the 
European Union without offering anything in return. Entry into 
NATO through the back door" is not possible. 
  Asked whether it would have been better to join the 
Partnership for Peace scheme together with Finland and Sweden, 
Majcen declined to reply: He is only implementing government 
decisions. However, if the referendum on 12 June should yield a 
positive result, a certain "speed is required." Austria must 
"decide quickly what kind of security policy is useful. Also, 
it must regulate its relationship with the Western European 
Union."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Investment in East Curbed Recession"] </F>
  [Text] On Monday [9 May] Chancellor Franz Vranitzky 
accused the West of omissions concerning financial support for 
the reform states of East Europe. "If the West European 
industrialized nations had made joint investment efforts in East 
and Central Europe, we would probably have saved ourselves part 
of the recession," Vranitzky stressed when he opened the 
International Social Economic Congress in Graz. 
  In his opening speech, the chancellor also warned that 
accelerated structural changes might lead to the loss of too 
many jobs in Austria and might endanger the country's 
attractiveness as an industrial base. Whenever expenditure cuts 
and restructuring are recommended, "jobs are lost in the end." 
  However, structures must not be improved in such a way that 
industry is reduced to insignificance. It would be one of the 
biggest mistakes to ignore the possibilities of cooperation 
between state-owned and private enterprises, but the search for 
a consensus must not lead to the preservation of the existing 
structures. 
  Vranitzky stressed that the restructuring of state-owned 
industries (privatization, cooperation) must not be carried out 
on the basis of ideology but rather of economic criteria. He 
also pointed out that the state continues to be economically 
responsible even if it gives up its right of ownership. 
Cooperation projects should not end at the Austrian borders but 
must also include the neighboring countries and reform states, 
the chancellor stressed. Thus, Vranitzky believes that Austria 
is facing an era of "revolutionary industrial cooperation."

  [Text] Turkey would like to coordinate the operation to 
save the Karkuk-Yumurtalik oil pipeline with the UN guidelines. 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Ferhat Ataman commented on the 
subject when asked about certain proposals submitted in a letter 
by the U.S. ambassador to Ankara regarding plans to save the oil 
pipeline. 
  Ataman recalled that various contacts were held with the 
Iraqi authorities and the coalition partners of the Gulf War 
with the aim of rescuing the Karkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline. 
Stressing that everyone agrees that it is necessary to save 
this important pipeline, Ataman described this as a positive 
development. We see that all the sides have begun exerting 
efforts to this end, Ataman remarked, adding: During a visit to 
our ministry yesterday, the U.S. ambassador confirmed that his 
government also concedes this necessity. At this stage, he did 
not make any proposals on the subject or submit any letters. 
The permanent members of the UN Security Council have actually 
begun exchanging views on the subject. We will continue our 
consultations in London, Moscow, Paris, and Washington in the 
coming days. 
  Ataman declared that from the beginning, Turkey's aim 
remains 
rescuing the Karkuk-Yumurtalik oil pipeline in harmony with the 
UN system.

<F P=106> [Column by Derya Sazak: "The United States Creates </F>
Difficult Situation"] 
  [Text] It is common knowledge that the United States does 
not maintain a favorable approach to Turkey's initiative to 
reach an agreement with Iraq to reoperate the Karkuk-Yumurtalik 
oil pipeline, which has been abandoned to corrode. A visit to 
the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday further 
clarified the U.S. stance on the matter. Ambassador Richard 
Barkley held talks with Under Secretary Ozdem Sanberk and made 
various proposals, which are regarded as a "formula." 
  Ambassador Barkley's written proposals indicate that the 
U.S. 
Administration, let alone trying to facilitate the "operation to 
save the pipeline," wishes to further complicate the matter by 
transferring it to the UN Security Council. 
  The contacts Ambassador Barkley made shed light on the U.S. 
stance on the matter some time ago. While the U.S. officials 
explained the anxiety in Washington caused by the initiatives 
that may result in the violation of the embargo against Iraq, 
the White House approach was outlined as follows: "Former 
President Bush won the war. President Clinton does not wish to 
lose what has been achieved." 
  That viewpoint was an indication that the assessments that 
led to the Gulf War have not changed and that the embargo will 
remain in effect as long as Saddam Husayn leads Iraq. It is a 
fact that the recent UN Security Council resolutions contained 
moderate provisions in favor of Iraq. However, they lacked any 
tendency that may have led to a change in the present situation. 
Consequently, the messages from the U.S. State Department are 
aimed at forcing Turkey to move within the framework of that 
approach. 
  Turkey wishes to operate the Karkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline to 
withdraw the oil in it. Furthermore, it is inclined to agree to 
resume the pumping operations after it withdraws the oil in the 
pipeline. However, the United States has drawn Turkey's 
attention to the UN resolutions. More importantly, it has asked 
Turkey to hold talks with Britain, France, and Russia and 
"persuade" them to agree to the resumption of the flow of oil in 
that pipeline. Apparently, the United States has defended the 
view that Turkey has to seek the consent of the countries that 
have established a coalition against Iraq. 
  In addition to limiting Turkey's "maneuvering" capability in 
its effort to have the embargo against Iraq relaxed, various 
aspects of Ambassador Barkley's letter to Ozdem Sanberk can be 
described as rather harsh. For example, a reference was made to 
Article 50 of the UN Charter on the existing economic problems 
in Turkey, which also justified the effort made to help Turkey 
redeem the loss it has incurred from the embargo on Iraq. 
Regarding the concept of "support," Article 50 says in part: 
"If any country, regardless of whether it is a UN member, is 
confronted with special economic problems as a result of the 
implementation of the preventive or compelling measures the UN 
Security Council may take against any country, then that country 
has the right to appeal to the UN Security Council for the 
solution of its problems." 
  Yes, that is the recommendation that has been made to Turkey 
by a friendly country, the United States! The message that has 
been conveyed to Turkey is quite clear: "We understand you. 
You have incurred an economic loss as a result of the Gulf War. 
You are in financial difficulty at the present time. If you 
expect any help, then you better appeal to the United Nations." 
  Is that not disrespectful? It is as if Turkey is regarded as 
a country like Somalia. As far as aid is concerned, the United 
States is forcing the Ciller administration in Ankara to beg 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali's organization, in addition to the IMF and 
the World Bank. That is shameful. 
  The United States reached an agreement with President 
Mubarak 
and quickly erased Egypt's debts to unite the Arab world against 
Saddam Husayn when the Gulf War broke out. However, that 
country has advised Turkey to appeal to the UN Security Council 
only three years after that state of affairs. 
  The quota of $1.6 billion is the only key to the resumption 
of pumping operations in the Karkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline. The UN 
condition is that 30 percent of that amount be transferred to 
the reparations fund. However, Iraq has regarded that condition 
as a violation of its sovereignty. Consequently, it has endured 
the embargo. Therefore, it is impossible for Turkey to persuade 
Iraq to agree to sell its oil and channel the profit it makes to 
the UN reparations fund. Actually, Turkey is not concerned with 
the sale of oil at this stage. It is only trying to save the 
oil pipeline. However, it seems that its initiatives have been 
judged to be too much. 
  The views Ambassador Barkley conveyed to Ozdem Sanberk 
yesterday indicated that Turkey "has missed the train" on the 
question of having pumping operations in the oil pipeline 
resumed. The valves could have been turned on immediately after 
Sanberk returned from Baghdad to Ankara some time ago. However, 
the question of the needs of Turkey, which has expected a 
formula from the United States, have been transferred to the 
commission [not further specified] once again. The U.S. 
officials have invited the Foreign Ministry officials to hold 
talks in Washington at the end of May. Meanwhile, they want 
Turkey to reach an agreement with Britain, France, and Russia. 
  The question as to how Ankara will manage to persuade 
Moscow, 
London, and Paris to agree is unknown. Also unknown is how long 
southeastern Turkey, whose economy is on the verge of collapse, 
can continue to endure the embargo. It is a pity for the people 
of this country. It is as if the embargo has been imposed on 
Turkey and not on Iraq. Deputy Prime Minister Murat 
Karayalcin's visit to the Habur border gate was the only "timid" 
step that has been taken to revive the border trade between 
Turkey and Iraq thus far. 
  If Barkley's letter will not be enough to force the Turkish 
Grand National Assembly members to remember our national 
interests and Turkey's sovereign rights, then what are the 
"warnings" they need that they may do so? 
  Meanwhile, why is the parliament undecided on rejecting the 
extension of the Hammer Force's mandate? Is it because the 
parliamentarians believe that the United States may act with a 
sense of fairness and provide the aid Turkey needs? We believe 
that this is something that will not happen.

  [Text] Ankara, May 10 (AA) -- Defense Minister Mehmet 
Golhan on Tuesday [9 May] said that Turkey aims at full 
membership to the Western European Union (WEU). 
  Golhan who concluded an official visit to France and who 
attended the Western European Union meetings in Luxembourg, was 
speaking to reporters upon his arrival at Ankara's Esenboga 
Airport. 
  He said during his visit to France bilateral relations were 
discussed as well as regional and international developments 
with emphasis on the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the 
Azeri-Armenian conflict, the Cyprus problem, PKK [Workers Party 
of Kurdistan] terrorism and Turkey's status within the WEU. 
  He said he also visited a number of military installations 
in 
France which will hand over to Turkey 20 Puma helicopters as of 
the beginning of 1995. 
  He said that Turkey also needs six mine-sweeping ships, 
adding the new economic measures has slowed down its bidding 
procedure. 
  He said Turkey and France are cooperating in the production 
of radars and these will be delivered in August by France. 
  On the WEU meetings Golhan said its most important factor 
was 
that Turkey's status was ameliorated. 
  A document was signed at the end of the meetings on Monday 
according to which the partnership status of nine Central 
European countries Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, 
Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Lithuania, Estonia and Lithuania 
[as received] and the extended associate memberships of Turkey, 
Norway and Iceland were published. 
  According to the document, Turkey, Iceland and Norway could 
send military forces to WEU, make use of the WEU's protective 
umbrella and would be included in all communications systems. 
  Golhan said this is not completely satisfactory but 
represents a step towards Turkey's full membership.

<F P=106> [Report by Sezai Sengun: "Rising Dollar Parity Hits F-16 </F>
Project"] 
  [Text] Ankara--The strengthening U.S. dollar has doubled 
the amount of Turkish lira required for several important 
projects in the defense domain in Turkey. That has created 
anxiety that the modernization projects for the Turkish Armed 
Forces may be delayed. In fact, the contracting for several 
projects has been postponed. The project for the production of 
F-16 aircraft was the first to be affected by the financial 
crisis. The Turkish Defense Fund, which was established by 
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, the United 
States, and Turkey after the Gulf War was to have been used for 
the production of 160 F-16 aircraft. Turkey's share in the 
fund, which totals approximately $3.5 billion, is $500 million. 
  Turkey did not find it difficult to contribute $100 million 
to that fund before the value of the Turkish lira against the 
dollar fell. However, Ankara is now worried about how to 
fulfill the remaining part of its obligation, which totals $400 
million. The effort made to create an annual source for 50 
million Turkish lira for the installments Turkey has to pay to 
the fund has not yielded results because the Defense Industry 
Executive Committee, which is chaired by Prime Minister Ciller, 
has been unable to meet. 
  Meanwhile, it has been reported that several of the delayed 
contracts have been shelved. Those that are expected to be 
suspended are: 
  1. Modernization of F-5 and F-4 aircraft. Many of Turkey's 
F-5 and F-4 aircraft were to have been modernized. The 
modernization of each of Turkey's F-5 and F-4 aircraft will cost 
$3 million and $700 million respectively. 
  2. Multiple rocket launchers. Turkey purchased 12 multiple 
rocket launchers in the past. It received an offer by the 
manufacturing firm for another 24 launchers. 
  3. Naval helicopters. The purchase of four naval 
helicopters, which the naval forces have asked for, is another 
project that has been affected by the decrease in the value of 
the Turkish lira against the U.S. dollar. 
  4. Minesweepers. A decision was made to purchase six 
minesweepers in 1989. Offers were made to Turkey by several 
firms. It has been reported that the project will cost 
approximately $1 billion. 
  5. Antiaircraft fire control systems. Several firms offered 
to sell 35-mm automatic antiaircraft fire control systems to 
Turkey at the end of 1991. However, Ankara asked for offers on 
a new list of requirements that was drawn up by the General 
Staff. 
  6. Sikorsky helicopters. An effort is being made to find a 
source of $500 million for 50 Sikorsky helicopters. Plans have 
been made to have them manufactured in Turkey. However, it has 
been reported that the project will be delayed until 1995. 
  7. Border security. The establishment of "physical security 
barriers" on Turkey's eastern and southeastern border is another 
defense project that has been affected by the decrease in the 
value of the Turkish lira against the dollar. The physical 
barriers are required for obstructing the infiltration of 
Workers Party of Kurdistan militants into Turkey. The project 
required an allocation of 4 trillion Turkish lira in 1994. 
Meanwhile, the fate of the project for unmanned reconnaissance 
aircraft, which will contribute toward the maintenance of border 
security, has also been linked to the situation of the Turkish 
lira against the U.S. dollar. The Turkish Space and Aviation 
Industry has manufactured and successfully tested several of 
these aircraft.

Paris. He was received [in France] today by the French prime

occasion to announce that three African countries -- Ghana, 
Nigeria, and Tanzania -- had given him their agreement on 
sending 5,500 UN peacekeeping troops to Rwanda. Monique Mas: 
  [Mas] According to Butrus-Ghali what is needed is for the 
genocide to be halted, the refugees to be helped, and the 
humanitarian organizations to be protected. In order to do 
this, the UN secretary general envisages a 5,500-strong force. 
They would be authorized to defend themselves if they are 
attacked, but on the other hand there is no indication that 
these UN peacekeeping troops would have a mandate to defend the 
civilians against the militiamen in the zones where they will be 
deployed. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Paris, May 11 (AFP) -- UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali said Wednesday [11 May] he hoped to obtain the 
release of 11 French aid workers held by Bosnian Serbs since 
April for alleged arms trafficking. 
  "We hope that through negotiation we can find a way to free 
the hostages," he said after a 45-minute meeting with French 
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur. 
  The 11 are from the Premiere Urgence (First Emergency) 
group, 
which denies the smuggling allegations. 
  Balladur later told the French National Assembly, or lower 
house, that the government was determined to see them freed and 
"is using all the means it can to obtain their unconditional 
release." 
  They have been held since April 8 at the Sarajevo suburb of 
Lukavica by Bosnian Serbs, who have just extended their 
detention for a month pending trial and say the detainees could 
face up to 15 years in prison. 
  In Sarajevo, two lawyers sent by the Paris bar association 
and a Belgian colleague criticized both the Serb jailers and 
French officials in the Bosnian capital, saying Wednesay the 11 
could only hope for a "mock trial in a mock country." 
  The lawyers, who saw all the prisoners, said they were 
initially crammed into one room which created tension, then 
assigned a lawyer who did not speak their language, said 
George-Henri Beauthier, a representative of the Brussels-based 
International Federation of Human Rights Leagues. 
  He charged that the 11 were being used by the Serbs as 
"merchandise" to try to gain international recognition. 
  The lawyers also questioned the 14-day delay before the 
French ambassador in Sarajevo, Henri Jacolin, saw the group. 
But Jacolin told AFP Wednesday the situation on the ground had 
not helped and that only "quiet negotiations" could move the 
matter forward.

  [Text] Geneva, May 11 (AFP) -- The UN High Commissioner 
for Refugees is short of 236 million dollars to help until 
year's end four million refugees from the former Yugoslavia, the 
agency said Wednesday [11 May]. 
  The UNHCR said it needed a total 338 million dollars for the 
entire year -- or 918,000 dollars a day -- but had received only 
102 million dollars from donor countries by March 31, leaving a 
236-million-dollar hole. 
  The main beneficiary of United Nations aid is 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, followed by Croatia.

  [Text] Vienna, May 10 (AFP) -- A total of 485 nuclear 
reactors were either on stream or under construction globally 
last year, according to a report published Tuesday [10 May] by 
the International Atomic Energy Agency at its Vienna 
headquarters. 
  Last year saw the start-up of nine reactors in Canada, 
China, 
France, Japan, Russia and the United States, taking the number 
of operational sites to 430, with 55 under construction in 18 
countries, the IAEA said. 
  Several states, led by France and Lithuania, depend largely 
on nuclear power for their supplies of electricity.

<F P=106> [Interview with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz by </F>
Gudrun Harrer in Vienna; date not given: "Iraq Has Fulfilled 
the UN Resolutions"] 
  [Text] [Harrer] You have come to Vienna to hold talks with 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), one of the bodies 
that decides whether or not Iraq has complied with UN 
Resolutions 687 and 715, on which the lifting of the sanctions 
depends. The UN Security Council is meeting again in the middle 
of May to discuss Iraq. What is the IAEA position toward Iraq? 
  ['Aziz] We have satisfactory, normal relations with the 
IAEA. 
The IAEA has noted the major progress we have achieved in 
fulfilling the conditions, and we want this information to be 
conveyed to New York. 
  [Harrer] The last time the Council met, in the middle of 
March, it voted against the lifting of the sanctions vis-a-vis 
Iraq. 
  ['Aziz] If a free, secret vote were to be held, the majority 
of the Council would vote for the lifting, or at least a 
relaxation, of the sanctions. Even in March, some Council 
members were in favor of issuing a public statement recognizing 
Iraq's progress. The U.S. side opposed the idea. But, for the 
first time, the Council failed to adopt a statement against the 
lifting of the sanctions because a consensus was not reached on 
this matter. That says a lot. 
  [Harrer] Are you optimistic this time? 
  ['Aziz] It is the Council's credibility that is at stake. 
The Council adopted resolutions that were formulated in clear 
language. Iraq has fulfilled these resolutions. If certain 
Council members choose to ignore this fact -- and this has been 
documented not by Iraq, but by UN bodies -- they are undermining 
the credibility of the Council itself and its resolutions. 
  Most countries, including Austria, merely want Iraq to 
fulfill the resolutions that were adopted in connection with 
Kuwait -- nothing more and nothing less. However, when other 
things are suddenly brought into play, such as a unilateral U.S. 
policy vis-a-vis Iraq, and the United States attempts to impose 
its unilateral wishes on the Council, the Council's image is 
bound to suffer. 
  [Harrer] How much progress has been achieved in installing 
control systems inside Iraqi armaments plants? 
  ['Aziz] Things are moving quickly, and we are doing what is 
necessary in this connection. UN special envoy Rolf Ekeus 
confirmed this in his report at the end of April. 
  [Harrer] Apart from France and China, Russia also spoke out 
in favor of Iraq at the March Security Council meeting. What 
are your relations with Russia like, and is there any truth to 
the rumors that Vladimir Zhirinovskiy supports the Iraqi Ba'ath 
Party? 
  ['Aziz] Our relations are good. Russia has great economic 
interests in Iraq. Zhirinovskiy visited Iraq in 1992 and 
expressed support for our standpoint. But we do not imagine we 
can influence Russian domestic policy, and we certainly have no 
money to support other parties. Zhirinovskiy invited a Ba'ath 
delegation to his party's latest congress, but the Iraqis also 
used this opportunity to talk to all other parties with the 
exception of Russia's Choice, as well as holding talks at the 
Russian Foreign Ministry. 
  [Harrer] What are moods like in Iraq after four years of 
sanctions? Is a radicalization of the population to be feared? 
What about the opinions that Iraq's claim to Kuwait is by no 
means a closed chapter? 
  ['Aziz] The Iraqi population is suffering much hardship 
because of the sanctions, but we are an ancient civilization, 
and we will survive. You will hardly find anyone who says he 
hates the American people. 
  For the government, the Kuwait issue is finished, but one 
cannot stop people from thinking whatever they want to think. 
One cannot erase historical facts either. But the Iraqis 
support the government and know that what the government is 
doing -- for example, implementing the resolutions in order to 
permit the lifting of the sanctions, is good for the country. 
  I think frustration is the cause of such opinions concerning 
the Kuwait issue. People see Iraq doing everything the United 
Nations wants, but this does nothing to help them, and their 
situation gets even worse. But this has nothing do with the 
government's stance. 
  [Harrer] What is Baghdad's relationship with the Kurdish 
leaders Talabani and Barzani? 
  ['Aziz] In 1991, they spent several months in Baghdad, and 
one reached a consensus with them concerning the extent and form 
of autonomy, Kurdish involvement in the central government, 
elections, and so on. Barzani told us later that no sooner had 
he and Talabani returned to northern Iraq when they were 
summoned to Washington. Talabani went, but Barzani did not. In 
Washington, Talabani was told: "Are you crazy supporting Saddam 
Husayn's government when we want to topple it?" That was the 
end for the time being. The Kurds are not free to decide.

  [Text] Paris, May 11 (AFP) -- French Defence Minister 
Francois Leotard and his counterparts from the three Baltic 
states Wednesday [11 May] signed the first military cooperation 
accord among their countries in Paris. 
  Leotard said the agreements "open up new perspectives in 
relations between France and each of the three (Baltic) states" 
allowing bilateral exercises as well as joint manoeuvres within 
the framework of the NATO Partnership for Peace, a military 
coooperation agreement recently signed by several East European 
states. 
  Estonian Defence Minister Indrek Kannik stressed that his 
country and Latvia and Lithuania attached great importance to 
participation in all international forums. 
  Leotard said Wednesday's accords would provide for young 
soldiers to attend training courses in French military schools 
and for wide-ranging exchanges of military personnel.

  [Text] Strasbourg, France May 11 (A.A.) -- Foreign 
Minister Hikmet Cetin signed a protocol on Wednesday [11 May] 
concerning a "permanent court" which will be set up within the 
Council of Europe's Human Rights Commission. 
  Only Italy failed to sign the protocol for technical reasons 
which was to be signed by 32 countries. The permanent court 
will replace Human Rights Commission and Court. Council of 
Europe officials said the court functioning today has 
difficulties in observing the cases because of an increase in 
cases.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has declared that 
terrorism cannot be judged on a human rights level and that 
Turkey categorically opposes the proposal to send a CSCE 
delegation to Turkey. Cetin replied to questions by Turkish 
reporters in Strasbourg, where he is attending the Council of 
Europe Committee of Ministers meeting. 
  Answering a question, Cetin warned that assessing the 
question of terrorism in Turkey from a human rights viewpoint 
creates the impression that terrorism is being supported. 
Sending a CSCE observer delegation to Turkey is definitely 
unacceptable, Cetin stressed. 
  In reply to a question on recent developments in northern 
Iraq, the foreign minister recalled that the region is part of 
Iraq and stated that it is out of the question for Turkey to 
mediate between clashing Kurdish groups.

  [Excerpts] The Council of Europe Ministerial Committee 
meeting has ended in Strasbourg. Zerrin Ozkazanc from the 
Turkish Radio and Television [TRT] team in Strasbourg reports 
the following: 
  [Ozkazanc] At the meeting Turkey has extended its full 
support to the applications made by Albania and the countries in 
the Caucasus to become members of the Council of Europe. 
[passage omitted] 
  In a statement to the TRT after the meeting, Foreign 
Minister 
Hikmet Cetin said that with the protocol signed today the 
European Human Rights Declaration will have a new structure that 
will be more comprehensive and effective. He added that Turkish 
workers, who are faced with racism and xenophobia especially in 
Germany, should be accepted as national minorities. He made the 
following statement to the TRT on membership applications to the 
Council of Europe and the expansion of the Council: 
  [Cetin] Within the framework of this expansion, we explained 
that we view Russia's membership in the Council of Europe 
positively. We also explained, however, that in addition to 
Russia there are countries such as Ukraine and Moldova and that 
relations with these countries should be developed in that 
direction as well. The membership of the countries in the 
Caucasus, which we consider to be part of Europe, depends, to a 
great extent on the solution of the disputes in that region. On 
this issue, we explained that Armenian attacks should definitely 
be stopped and repelled because so long as foreign territories 
are occupied and so long as the principle of changing borders 
through the use of force remains valid membership is extremely 
difficult. Council of Europe principles should, therefore, be 
implemented in that region. I have also said that the Council 
should cooperate with and aid the regional countries, namely 
Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Georgia, to help them become ready for 
membership. 
  Meanwhile, I also explained that Albania is especially 
important, that there are great changes in that country and that 
Albania wants to become a member. I said that this hope should 
be granted to Albania.

  [Text] Finance Minister Ahmed Benbitour is on the second 
day of his working visit to Brussels. He is due to hold talks 
with the European commissioner in charge of financial and 
economic matters and also his Belgian counterpart before heading 
for Washington later. Over to Rachid Benhmimid for more details: 
  [Benhmimid] On the first day of his visit to Brussels, where 
he arrived yesterday from Paris, the Algerian finance minister 
held a press conference attended by a large number of 
international journalists. At this conference Mr. Benbitour 
presented a detailed report on the objective of his tour. He 
said: We have come to Brussels to explain the contents of the 
Algerian political and economic program to European circles and 
also to brief European political and financial circles on the 
progress of the talks with the International Monetary Fund on 
the rescheduling of Algeria's debts. We will also inform them 
that we have drawn up a program for economic revival. Benbitour 
added: We are hoping for comprehensive cooperation with Europe 
without having to ignore the financial aspect. [as heard] 
  On the first day of his visit to Belgium, Benbitour met 
European Commission President Jacques Delors and (Manuel Marin), 
the commissioner in charge of cooperation and development and 
contacts with Belgian and European financial and business 
circles. After these meetings, the Algerian finance minister 
declared that he was given a very encouraging welcome and 
presented with a serious readiness to support Algeria. He also 
stressed the determined will he found at the European Union to 
offer Algeria significant financial and political support to 
help it implement its plan for economic revival and employment. 
  Regarding his meetings with representatives of the world of 
finance and business, Benbitour talked about the importance of 
the messages that needed to be conveyed to the economic 
operators that had been offered opportunities on the Algerian 
market; he also stressed the importance of partnership. 
  Benbitour is expected to leave later for Washington, the 
third leg of his tour, where he will meet IMF and World Bank 
officials and U.S. financial authorities. After Washington, 
Benbitour will go to Tokyo, the fourth and last leg of this tour.

<F P=106> [Monica Sandback report: "Strong Growth Trend in Nordic </F>
Countries -- But Sweden Has Fallen Behind"] 
  [Text] The trend points upward in the Nordic countries. 
The upward trend is strongest in Finland, which is finally 
coming out of a four-year-long recession and looks set next year 
to be the fastest expanding of the Nordic countries. The pace 
is slower in Sweden, while Denmark and Norway gained good 
direction earlier on. 
  This is shown for instance in the Nordic Outlook survey 
compiled by economists from S-E-Banken. Strong increase of 
investments and hefty export figures are expected to give 
Finland a growth rate of 4.5 percent in 1995. The country's 
1-percent inflation rate, now the lowest in Europe, is also 
expected to stay low next year. After this, it is less certain 
whether the Finns can keep cost increases under control. A 
dynamic domestic demand may tempt companies to raise prices, and 
better profitability in the export industry may induce the 
workers to demand high pay raises. But the 20-percent 
unemployment rate, which is only expected to increase marginally 
next year, limits the risk of an overly rapid pay-structure 
increase. 
  On the political front, Finland has two elections coming up 
-- European Union [EU] elections this fall and general elections 
in March 1995. The outcome of the EU elections seems to be the 
easiest to predict, with all opinion polls indicating that the 
Finns will say yes to the EU. 
<H5>  Full Speed Ahead in Denmark </H5>
  Denmark too is facing new general elections, whose result 
will be difficult to predict. The election date has still to be 
set, but the elections must be held before 10 December this year. 
  The entry of the Social Democrats into the government 
following Poul Schlueter's abrupt resignation in January 1993 
may be a short interlude. If the Social Democrats get renewed 
confidence, the explanation may be that the Danish economy 
picked up speed already last year and continues to grow at a 
good pace. 
  Soft financial policy and lower interest rates, according to 
the economists of Enskilda Banken, are the main forces behind 
the Danish recovery. Unemployment, which was a huge problem in 
Denmark much earlier than in the other Nordic countries, now 
seems set to drop from 12 percent this year to 11 percent next 
year. The strong recovery of the economy may become visible in 
the inflation statistics. A much more stringent financial 
policy can therefore be expected next year as a measure to avoid 
overheating. 
<H5>  The Mainland Takes Over </H5>
  Norway is also in a rapid-growth phase with strong exports 
and rising private consumption. While the oil industry in 
Norway has switched into a lower gear, mainland Norway has 
finally gained the momentum that has been expected for many 
years. 
  The mainland economy is now expected to achieve a growth 
rate 
of 3 percent in order to keep pace with the country's overall 
growth rate -- for the first time in seven years. 
  Unemployment, which is lowest in Norway, is expected to drop 
from last year's 6 percent to 5.4 percent this year. 
  Norway is the only one of the Nordic countries that does not 
have general elections in the offing. The Norwegians got 
through those last year. But this does not mean that Norway can 
look forward to a politically calm period -- the coming EU 
elections may become a real thriller in our neighbor country in 
the West. 
  As for Sweden, the S-E-Banken economists predict a 
2.3-percent growth figure for this and next year. This is the 
slowest expansion rate among the Nordic countries considering 
next year's expected growth figures of 4.5 percent for Finland, 
3.4 percent for Denmark, and 2.8 percent for Norway.

<F P=106> [Steen Voigt report: "Auken Brings Together East Europe's </F>
Top Environmental People"] 
  [Text] The environment ministers of all the countries of 
East Europe will meet in Copenhagen in June at the invitation of 
Svend Auken to discuss "soft loans" for environmental 
investments. The aim is to accelerate environmental work in the 
East. 
  It is of crucial importance for improved and increased 
environmental work in the countries of East Europe that they 
have access to cheaper forms of finance for their environmental 
investments -- in water and air purification installations, for 
example. 
  So said Environment Minister Svend Auken (Social Democratic 
Party), who has invited all his East European counterparts to 
Copenhagen for the first three days in June to discuss "soft 
loans" in the environmental field in order to exert pressure on 
international banks. 
  The environment ministers from the three Baltic countries, 
Russia, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, 
Belarus, Moldova, and Ukraine have accepted the invitation. 
This is the fist time that so many East European environment 
ministers will have been brought together. 
  "Like the countries of East Europe, Denmark is tired of the 
fact that reports are written and large-scale investigations are 
carried out without anything coming of them," Svend Auken said 
yesterday when he announced the meeting. "Now we want to show 
that something can be done." 
  Svend Auken has long been pressing the EBRD [European Bank 
for Reconstruction and Development], for example, to grant 
cheaper "soft loans" with lower interest rates, longer repayment 
periods, and a repayment-free period if the loan is for 
environmental purposes. 
  Today international banks do not have different interest 
rates for purely commercial loans and environmental loans. This 
is slowing down the environmental work in East Europe, where the 
countries with their weak currencies need an immediate economic 
return rather than an environmental return from their 
investments. 
  "The idea behind the meeting is to influence the 
decisionmaking processes of the banks, as well as make this a 
major issue for discussion when we meet in Sofia next year at 
the pan-European environment conference," Auken said. 
  Representatives of the EBRD, the World Bank, the European 
Investment Bank, and the EU [European Union] Commission have 
also been invited to the meeting in Copenhagen.

<F P=106> [Article signed FR: "Flemish Bloc's European Program </F>
Largely Anti-European"] 
  [Excerpts] The Flemish Bloc (VB) prides itself on being the 
only Flemish party with a properly developed European program. 
But it became clear yesterday when the Bloc's program was 
presented that the content is largely anti-European: Party 
leader Dillen and his colleagues support cooperation between 
peoples, but within limits. Above all, Europe must not meddle in 
too many matters, and especially not education or culture, 
because that compromises "individuality." [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Civilization </H5>
  Above all, the VB wants to brush aside anything which is 
foreign, and that in the broadest sense of the word. Europe 
must not become an "open door zone for the Third World." The VB 
also rejects a European Union which would affect the "cultural 
identity of different peoples." Gerolf Annemans does not 
believe in "utopias" such as, in his opinion, the notion of a 
multicultural society. But the VB wants to see a varied Europe 
with its "common civilization." Which does not prevent the VB 
from believing that it is not utopian to clearly define "own" 
cultures and peoples within this larger Europe. The VB also 
rejects the idea of European citizenship as "a lifeless and 
rootless concept." 
  The VB naturally opposes the national member states, and 
Belgium above all, but is equally unenthusiastic about the 
Europe of Regions. "The Committee of the Regions is a dummy," 
says Annemans, "as Flemings we want nothing to do with the 
regions. We want a Europe of independent people's states." The 
VB made repeated references yesterday to the Czech-Slovak model 
(a photo of Vaclav Havel even adorned the Bloc's brochure). The 
split has been achieved "peacefully" there, the VB says. With 
this, Annemans sought to dispel suspicions that the VB has in 
mind regions and peoples such as we find in the former 
Yugoslavia. "Europe has no precise definition of what the 
regions are supposed to represent. As far as the peoples are 
concerned, we believe that they must each sort out their own 
problems and keep their own house in order." 
  How this "spring cleaning" by the people fits in with 
cooperation within "the real Europe," as Karel Dillen describes 
it, is not clear. And whether or not the VB had a precise 
definition of its people's states was also unclear, except that 
it is "of course not going to come about overnight." The VB 
wants to see a confederal rather than a federal Europe.

<F P=106> [Bert Cornelis report: "Belgium Is Still Selling Arms"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Belgium is still a major center for the 
international arms trade despite a new law which is supposed to 
impose strict controls on arms sales. 
  This is the view of VU [People's Union] Senator Willy 
Kuijpers, who yesterday disclosed to the senate the content of 
the Foreign Affairs Committee's report on the arms trade. 
  Kuijpers calculated that Belgium exported no less than 24 
billion Belgian francs [BFr] in arms last year. Divided between 
the three regions, that means that exports were BFr16.1 billion; 
BFr2.7 billion for Flanders and Flemish-Brussels and BFr13.4 
billion for Wallonia and French-speaking Brussels. The new 1991 
arms law applies to the first eight months of 1993 only, due to 
the delays in implementation decisions, but Kuijpers still 
calculated in 1993 Belgium exported no less than BFr24 billion 
in arms. 
  That is half as much again compared with the previous year. 
Belgian weapons go mainly to the North and Middle East (BFr9.5 
billion) and Asia (BFr1.5 billion). In Europe, BFr3.4 billion 
were exported to the former Yugoslavia, compared with BFr2.4 
billion in 1992. Kuijpers has strong suspicions that part of 
this comes from Belgium. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] The Flemish minister of culture, Hugo Weckx, is 
considering terminating the advertising monopoly of the Flemish 
VTM commercial cable television station. Mr. Weckx said on 
Tuesday [10 May] he expects VTM to apply for a licence to set up 
a second channel and this could open the door for other 
commercial stations to make their appearance on the Flemish 
cable network. And there's no lack of candidates. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Unidentified correspondent] The statement of Minister for 
Culture Hugo Weckx is a reaction to the deal concluded last week 
between the Belgian Football Association and the Flemish 
commercial television station VTM. At a cost of around three 
million dollars a year, VTM secured the rights of televised 
football matches over a period of four years. The BRTN felt 
cheated and spoke openly of a breach of promise by the Belgian 
Football Association and VTM. The public broadcaster had 
expected to reach an agreement between the three parties to 
share the costs of the television rights for soccer games. 
  According to Minister Weckx, the VTM commercial station can 
impossibly [as heard] meet its obligations toward the football 
association without a second channel. And that is precisely 
what the station wants, because there are other candidates who 
are more than eager to get their share of the cake. And that 
cake is worth more than seven billion francs in commercials a 
year, around 200 million U.S. dollars. 
  A Swedish broadcasting concern has shown great interest to 
get on the cable in Flanders. SBS, which stands for 
Scandinavian Broadcasting System, wants to appear in the Flemish 
households before the summer of next year, and that news has led 
to mild forms of panic in VTM, BRTN, and Flemish political 
circles. [passage omitted] 
  The general feeling in Flemish media circles is that SBS 
will 
not easily conquer the market over here. In Scandinavia the 
station's top programmes are U.S. soap series like The Cosby 
Show and the Oprah Winfrey talk show, and the rights of many of 
these programs are already in the hands of VTM or BRTN. 
  For the Flemish media specialists, it's a certainty that the 
advertising monopoly of VTM will be abolished sooner or later, 
whether by SBS or another candidate. [passage omitted]

  [Text] CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] member Wim Deetman 
is to remain Second Chamber chairman. The PvdA [Labor Party], 
which as the largest party is entitled to fill this position, 
has renounced any claims to it. PvdA leader Kok made this clear 
in a letter to party leaders yesterday [10 May]. 
  The appointment, in principle for four years, takes effect 
when the new Chamber first sits on Tuesday of next week. 
Deetman, chairman since September 1989, had already indicated 
that he was available. 
  According to the PvdA, there is "broad appreciation" of the 
way Deetman has discharged his responsibilities. Another factor 
was also that First Chamber chairman is the PvdA's Tjeenk 
Willink. According to an unwritten rule in the Netherlands 
parliament, the presidents of the First and the Second Chamber 
must never be from the same party. 
  In 1986, when the CDA had more seats than the PvdA, PvdA 
member Doman was also allowed to remain at his post. As the 
biggest party, the CDA did not demand the job for one of its own 
members until 1989.

<F P=106> [Article signed GGD: "Bosnia: Toward a Ministerial Meeting </F>
on Friday"] 
  [Text] Luxembourg, 9 May (BELGA) -- U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher convened a high-level meeting for Friday [13 
May] in Geneva of the study group on the former Yugoslavia, 
which includes the United States, Russia, the United Nations, 
and the European Union (EU), Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jacques 
Poos announced Monday in Luxembourg. 
  According to Willy Claes, his Belgian counterpart, it seems 
that this meeting is to be held at the ministerial level in 
order to study action to be taken in the conflict in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Mr. Poos, who made a statement at the end of a Council of 
Ministers meeting of the Western European Union (WEU), hoped 
that this meeting would revive the negotiations and contribute 
to "defining a common position among the United States, Russia, 
and the EU" to "reduce to nothing the hopes" of those who aim to 
profit from the division of the international community to make 
territorial gains, a clear reference to the Bosnian Serbs. 
  According to Mr. Claes, the EU should be represented in 
Geneva by its troika (the past, present, and future presidents 
of the Council of Ministers, namely Belgium, Greece, and 
Germany) and by the two countries which have permanent seats in 
the UN Security Council (namely France and Great Britain). 
  While emphasizing that the main parties involved in the 
Yugoslav conflict had to demonstrate their political will to 
jointly reach a cease-fire, "an essential condition for a peace 
agreement," Mr. Claes had questions about the goals and the 
final outcome of this meeting. 
  Cautiously making a number of carefully phrased remarks 
regarding the meeting, Mr. Claes did not rule out its lasting 
until Saturday, if necessary, to include a meeting of the 
countries which are providing troops for the UN Protection Force 
(UNPROFOR) in the former Yugoslavia.

coordination efforts between Rome and Sarajevo, authorities the 
largest humanitarian convoy yet organized by the Italian 
Government, in cooperation with its Bosnian counterpart, set out 
today for Tuzla, an Italian Foreign Ministry communique

  The convoy is made up of 35 local trucks with 17 belonging 
to 
the Italian Team, along with nine escort vehicles, and is 
carrying 450 [metric] tons of food (including 300 tons of rice) 
for the Bosnian city and environs. 
  The foodstuffs come from the warehouse in the Croatian city 
of Split where the Italian Solidarity Consortium and Italian 
cooperation officials have supplies stocked. 
  From the start of the year, Italian Cooperation has 
organized 
27 humanitarian convoys from the base in Split, distributing 
some 600 tons of food and other basic necessities to various 
localities in Bosnia, the Farnesina communique added. 
  Furthermore, another 16 tons of supplies were furnished to 
Bosnian refugees in Dalmatia over the same period, the ministry 
said.

May], the foreign and defense ministers of the Western European 
Union (WEU) further harmonized their plans for the setting up of 
police forces in Mostar. In addition to the European Union 
[EU], the WEU wants to contribute in this way to developing the 
administration of the capital of Herzegovina. 
  FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel announced in Luxembourg 
that the use of German police forces in Mostar is being 
considered. However, a final decision has not yet been made. 
  Hans Koschnick, former Social Democratic mayor of Bremen, 
has 
meanwhile held several talks there, Kinkel said. The EU 
appointed Koschnick as the chief coordinator for the development 
of Mostar. The beginning of the EU action is still open, 
because it is to start under peaceful conditions.

  [Excerpt] Luxembourg (DPA) -- The Western European Union 
(WEU) has decided to admit the six Central European states and 
the three Baltic countries as "associated partners." The 
foreign and defense ministers of both sides want to adopt the 
relevant documents in Luxembourg on Monday [9 May]. 
  "In this way, we have come far closer to the objective of a 
pan-European peace policy," FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel 
stated in his speech, which was publicized in advance. 
Meanwhile, Russia shows understanding for the extension of the 
WEU to East Europe, he said. 
  The new associated status is granted to Poland, Hungary, the 
Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, and the three 
Baltic states. Thus, the associated partners will be able to 
attend WEU Council meetings at regular intervals in the future. 
Moreover, they get the opportunity to participate in 
humanitarian and combat missions. The East Europeans will not 
get a security guarantee. 
  FRG Defense Minister Volker Ruehe stressed in Luxembourg 
that 
Germany will do everything to create "legal and real 
prerequisites" for future WEU missions. This also includes the 
rescue of European Union citizens from places such as Yemen or 
Rwanda. 
  Kinkel announced that Bonn is basically prepared to 
participate in the development of satellite-assisted 
reconnaissance of the WEU states. However, the FRG Government 
has not yet made a final decision. Without such reconnaissance, 
which the United States ensures in NATO, the combating of crises 
by the WEU is hardly conceivable. The costs will probably be 
substantial, he said. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPE: "WEU Admits </F>
Nine East European Countries as `Associate Partners'"] 
  [Excerpt] The principal decision of the WEU [Western 
European Union] Council (Foreign and Defence Ministers) meeting 
on 9 May in Luxembourg with Jacques Poos [deputy prime minister 
and foreign minister] chairing the proceedings was to grant 
"associate partner" status to nine East European countries which 
have or will have association agreements with the European 
Union. The Western European Union will therefore soon comprise 
four "circles": 
  (a) full members, namely, at this point, all the European 
Union countries with the exception of Ireland and Denmark. 
Greece is the 10th member, but has participated up to now 
solely as an active observer as its Act of Accession has not 
been ratified yet by all the other Member States (Germany has 
meanwhile ratified the Act); 
  (b) observers, namely Ireland (a neutral member of the 
European Union) and Denmark (a European Union member which up to 
now has not wanted to join the WEU because of its reluctance 
about a European security and defence policy, although some 
political forces in this country are said to support entry). 
This status could be chosen by Austria, Finland, and Sweden 
once they become members of the European Union; 
  (c) associate members, i.e. NATO members: Norway (which 
will become a full member of the WEU once it has become a member 
of the European Union), Turkey (which tried unsuccessfully to 
become a full WEU member several years ago) and Iceland; 
  (d) associate partners, i.e. Hungary, Poland, Czech 
Republic, 
Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia (the 
three Baltic states are given different treatment than that 
given the other ex-USSR countries, as the Russian occupation of 
these countries has never been recognized). In the afternoon, 
the Ministers met with their counterparts from the nine 
associate partner countries. In their final press release, the 
Ministers also underscored their determination to develop 
dialogue with the Mediterranean countries and contacts with 
Russia and Ukraine. Asked about Russia's attitude to the 
associate partner status given to East European countries, 
[German Foreign Minister] Mr. Kinkel told the press that, after 
first being "rather critical" for fear that this could be a 
"substitute for closer ties with NATO," Moscow is now showing 
"comprehension" regarding the initiative. 
  During lunch (separate from the Defence Ministers), the 
Foreign Ministers discussed the situation in Bosnia and, 
welcoming the prospect of the start-up of the European Union's 
administration of Mostar, discussed the contribution the WEU 
could make by providing a police force for this city (Mr. Kinkel 
told the press such a force could be operational very quickly). 
  The decisive criterion for attributing this new status is 
the 
type of relationship the countries concerned maintain with the 
European Union, with which they must have an association 
agreement. This explains why the WEU cannot agree for now to 
grant this status to the states of the former USSR, even if the 
Western European Union wishes to step up its bilateral contacts 
with them. In contrast, the WEU will have a multilateral 
relationship with its new "partners," another difference from 
the Partnership for Peace offered by NATO. Moreover, while the 
Partnership places greater emphasis on military cooperation, the 
WEU associate status is essentially political in nature. This 
associate partner status will be formally attributed to the nine 
countries only once the ratification of Greek entry as the 10th 
full member of the WEU has been completed (there is some delay 
in Germany and France, which is why Greece temporarily has 
observer status), which will also make it possible to formalize 
the associate member status of Norway, Turkey and Iceland. 
Formally, given the criteria which have been fixed for the East 
European countries, it will also be necessary to await 
ratification of the association agreements between the European 
Union and the Baltic states. However, the associate partners 
could begin exercising their new status in the coming weeks by 
participating in every other meeting of the WEU Permanent 
Council: The Council could thus meet with 15 members one week 
(the 10 full members plus the three associate members and the 
two observers, Ireland and Denmark) and the following week with 
24 members. Associate members participate in all the Council 
meetings but do not benefit from the automatic assistance clause 
of Article V of the Treaty and cannot block consensus between 
full members: These two conditions will also be applied to the 
associate partners. The associate partners will also establish 
a simple "liaison" with the WEU Planning Unit, while officers of 
the two associate members (Turkey and Norway, but not Iceland, 
which has no army) will now be allowed to participate in the 
work of the Unit. Neutral countries such as Austria, Finland 
and Sweden could in time be given observer status if they are 
interested, but the WEU obviously does not wish to intervene in 
their domestic debate on this subject. In Luxembourg, the 
Ministers also decided to develop contacts with Egypt, which has 
called for closer ties with the WEU. The WEU already has 
theoretically multilateral relations with the Maghreb countries 
(Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, Mauritania, but not with Libya), but 
in practice they are bilateral. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Theodore Pangalos, Greek European </F>
affairs minister and current chairman of the European Union 
Foreign Ministers Council, by unidentified correspondent; place 
and date not given] 
  [Text] [FINANCIAL TIMES] How important are the elections? 
  [Pangalos] They are a fundamental test of the European 
public's interest in European unification. They are the first 
elections allowing European citizens to participate whatever 
their place of residence. 
  [FINANCIAL TIMES] Should the parliament be given greater 
powers? 
  [Pangalos] The parliament will actively participate in 
preparing the 1996 conference to reform EU [European Union] 
institutions. We should aim for an increased role for the only 
directly elected body for European citizens. 
  [FINANCIAL TIMES] What should be the EU's priorities in the 
next few years? 
  [Pangalos] Employment and migration flows will be the main 
economic and social problems for the next decade. If we don't 
answer these two challenges positively, we will have a serious 
political and social crisis. 
  [FINANCIAL TIMES] Should the EU give priority to deepening 
integration among the 12, or to widening it towards East Europe? 
  [Pangalos] The enlargement to 16 has almost entirely 
exhausted the limits of the EU's capacity to absorb new members. 
Two small countries like Cyprus and Malta could start 
negotiations in the immediate future. Further enlargement will 
entail radical reform of EU structures. 
  [FINANCIAL TIMES] Are you worried that German unification 
and an eastwards shift in the EU's centre of gravity could harm 
Greece's interests? 
  [Pangalos] "Germanisation" of the Union can be an irrational 
anxiety. Strengthening the EU is the best way to avoid such 
dangers. Loose co-operation limited to economic or commercial 
interests could produce or increase domination. 
  [FINANCIAL TIMES] Will assistance for poorer EU states 
eventually have to be cut? 
  [Pangalos] What you call "assistance" is structural action 
aimed at increasing social and regional cohesion and helping 
recovery. Such action is essential if we want more than a 
simple free trade zone. 
  [FINANCIAL TIMES] Is the aim of economic and monetary union 
by 1999 still practicable? 
  [Pangalos] The Maastricht Treaty provides the route to EMU 
[European Monetary Union]. Some countries might not satisfy the 
criteria in 1999, and Greece might be one of them. Such 
countries will have to wait and make further efforts. The world 
will not end in 1999.

<F P=106> [Peter Norman report: "Bank Warns on Interest Rates and </F>
Inflation"] 
  [Text] The Bank of England warned yesterday that it would 
increase interest rates if expectations of higher inflation led 
to a quickening in the pace of wage and price rises. 
  In its latest quarterly inflation report, however, it said 
the most likely outcome, assuming bank base rates stay at 5.25 
percent, would be for underlying inflation to be between 3 and 
3.5 percent in two years' time, within the government's target 
range of 1-4 percent. 
  The bank believes underlying inflation, which is measured by 
excluding mortgage interest payments from the retail prices 
index, will be slightly higher in April, May and June than the 
2.4 percent rate in March. 
  Inflation fell in the first three months of this year 
because 
of a squeeze on retail margins but is set to rise because of 
council tax changes and the imposition of value-added tax on 
fuel, both of which took effect in April 
  Over 1994 as a whole, the bank expects inflation to be 
slightly lower than projected in its February inflation report. 
But the bank revised upwards its forecast of inflation next 
year. It now expects the rate to be flat rather than move 
gently downwards. 
  The bank has revised its expectations of inflation because 
of 
two factors: February's quarterpoint cut in bank base rates and 
a faster than expected increase in average earnings. 
  "If these (labour cost) pressures are maintained, this could 
translate into higher inflation next year," the bank warned. 
  The bank pinpoints three "small early warning 
signs": 

  -  Rates of monetary growth have continued to 
increase. Although this is not a threat to the inflation target 
at the moment, a continued increase in the months ahead would 
have "more disturbing" implications. 
  -  Inflation expectations have 
risen and are no longer coming down into line with the 
target. 
  -  Average earnings growth accelerated to 3.5 percent in 
February from 3 percent in November and may have been higher in 
March. 
  The bank is worried that higher inflation expectations will 
trigger higher wage settlements. It said pay developments "will 
need to be monitored closely" and urged "adherence to a firm 
monetary stance" to reinforce the "fragile" credibility of 
Britain's inflation target. 
  The bank's report leaves the clear impression that it 
regards 
the February cut in base rates as a mistake. "The rise in gilt 
yields after that announcement suggested that the market was 
revising its view of the authorities' commitment to monetary 
stability," it said. 
  Responding to the bank's report, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the 
chancellor of the exchequer, last night told Channel 4 News he 
was "determined to hit the inflation target" and have economic 
growth that lasts.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Bank Warns on Inflation"] </F>
  [Text] Mr Major, be warned. The Bank of England's latest 
quarterly Inflation Report is bad news for you. It predicts 
that, if interest rates were to remain unchanged, underlying 
inflation two years hence would be 3-3.5 percent. This would 
mean that the government's inflation target of 1-2.5 percent a 
year by the end of the current parliament will not be met. The 
Bank's message is crystal clear: the next move in interest rates 
will not only be upwards but may have to come quite soon. 
  The report identifies three main risks. First, rates of 
monetary growth have continued to increase. Second, 
expectations of inflation have risen. Finally, the growth of 
underlying average earnings has picked up. 
  Narrow money, which grew at an annual rate of 6.2 percent in 
April, is still well above its 0-4 percent monitoring range. 
But this says the Bank, may reflect an adjustment of cash 
balances towards a new equilibrium level as interest rates have 
fallen. The growth of the broader measure of the money supply, 
M4, has increased for three consecutive quarters, to reach an 
annual rate of 5.9 percent in March, which is near the centre of 
its 3-9 percent monitoring range. Furthermore, the Bank's own 
weighted measure of the money supply has also begun to pick up. 
<H5>  Greater Uncertainty </H5>
  The clearest evidence of a deterioration in expectations of 
inflation is in financial markets, where gilt yields have risen 
by more than 2 percentage points since the turn of the year. 
This rise has been a global phenomenon, but it has been far 
greater in the UK than in most major economies. The gap between 
yields on index-linked and conventional gilts, a good indicator 
of expected inflation, has also risen by almost l.5 percentage 
points since January, to 4.7 percent. Obviously, investors 
doubt whether the government's inflation target will be met. 
  The rise in yields may also reflect greater uncertainty 
about 
future inflation and real yields. The Bank points, 
mischievously, to the last cut in interest rates, on February 8, 
now known to have been imposed, against its advice, by the 
chancellor of the exchequer. "The substantial rise in nominal 
bond yields some days after this cut," notes the report, 
"suggested revised perceptions of the authorities' commitment to 
monetary stability." 
  The pick-up in the growth of underlying average earnings, 
from 3 percent in November to 3.5 percent in February, may be 
early evidence that expectations of inflation have risen among 
wage bargainers too. 
<H5>  Puzzling Rise </H5>
  This rise is rightly deemed puzzling, since there remains a 
large excess supply of labour in the UK economy. The number of 
hours worked in the economy has, after all, fallen significantly 
since its peak in 1989. The Bank itself estimates the "output 
gap" -- a measure of economy-wide excess capacity -- at just 
under 6 percent. This ought to give the UK several years of 
rapid growth before strong inflationary pressures re-emerge. 
But the evidence of higher pay inflation means that "it will be 
necessary to monitor labour market developments extremely 
carefully over the next few months." 
  The report warns wage bargainers that "monetary policy will 
not be used to validate inflation outside the target range." If 
higher inflation is assumed in pay negotiations, "real wage 
levels will turn out to be too high, with the result that labour 
demand will be lower and unemployment higher than it need be." 
  The warning is needed. If policy were expected to 
accommodate higher levels of wages and prices, that belief could 
lead to higher wage bargains and settlements. People must have 
faith in the inflation target and "that belief must be 
reinforced by adherence to a firm monetary stance." 
  Unfortunately, the government is responsible for the actions 
needed to reinforce credibility and, not surprisingly, given its 
past record and the current political shambles, its commitment 
is in serious doubt. This means, in turn, that the real cost of 
achieving the target is higher than it need be, which further 
reduces its credibility. Whatever the political difficulties, 
the chancellor must heed the Bank's warning. Neither he, nor 
the country, can afford to preside over yet another missed 
target.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin has 
announced a "new era in relations" when the last Russian 
soldiers have left Germany. This was stated by Yeltsin in Bonn 
on Wednesday [11 May] before beginning political talks with 
Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl that will focus on the modalities 
of the troop withdrawal, among other things. After an unusually 
cordial welcome between Yeltsin and Kohl, the Russian president 
said he was confident Germany would help his country even after 
the conclusion of the troop withdrawal. 
  Russia wants to be a member with equal rights in all 
European 
organizations. He was hoping that, with the beginning of the 
presidency in the European Council on 1 July of this year, Kohl 
would advocate Russia's access to these institutions. Russia is 
Germany's most important neighbor, Kohl said. 
  The chancellor, who addressed Yeltsin with the familiar 
"du," 
said wisdom and vision were the preconditions for making the 
right decisions in a world that is undergoing dramatic changes. 
It was Germany's desire that Yeltsin and his reform policy be 
successful. "This success is a success for Europe and the 
Germans."

  [Text] Bonn -- Federal President Richard von Weizsaecker 
has praised President Yeltsin's willingness to carry out reforms 
and his personal courage. In a prerelease of the speech that he 
made at lunch, von Weizsaecker spoke in favor of merging German 
and Russian interests, which would also benefit both countries' 
neighbors. In connection with German unity, the Russian people 
have not only shown generosity, but also confidence in a common 
future of both nations. 
  "The pictures of August 1991, when you risked your life 
resisting force and speaking out for free human rights, have 
become historic documents and will serve as a model for future 
generations, showing what initiative and the convictions of an 
individual can achieve," Weizsaecker told Yeltsin. 
German-Russian relations today are no longer a game of changing 
alliances to realize national or dynastic interests at the 
expense of third parties. Today's task is conducting a new 
policy. 
  In spite of its vast area, reaching into Asia, Russia will 
remain a determining and enriching part of Europe in cultural, 
historical, and economic terms. "For me it is one of the 
miracles of history that the suffering that Hitler inflicted on 
Russia could not destroy the deep inner relationship between the 
Germans and the Russians," the president said. Both back then 
and today, the Russian people have shown great human strength 
and historic power. "Russia is a great nation," Weizsaecker 
said.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- According to President Boris Yeltsin, 
Russia wants to have peaceful relations with all its neighboring 
countries. In his toast at a dinner with Federal President 
Richard von Weizsaecker, Yeltsin said in Bonn on Wednesday [11 
May] at the beginning of his three-day visit to Germany: "For 
the first time in a long time Russia is entering the 
international stage as a major power that does not threaten 
anybody." 
  Just like Germany, Russia wants to integrate all countries 
of 
the continent into European security structures. "It is 
important that the fences and roadblocks, which have been dumped 
on the garbage heap, do not reappear." Yeltsin added: "We are 
sincerely trying to establish friendly ties with neighbors near 
and far, with all those who feel committed to the ideals of 
humanity and the standards set by international law." The head 
of the Kremlin spoke out in favor of "trade without obstacles," 
and of economic integration in Europe. 
  Yeltsin said that "a historic reconciliation" was currently 
taking place between Germany and Russia. "I am convinced that we 
can eliminate the term `war' from the Russian-German vocabulary 
for good." Yeltsin expressly praised the role of the outgoing 
federal president. "Your successor will not have things easy 
because he will be compared with Mr. Weizsaecker, who has set 
very high standards." Weizsaecker managed to remain beyond the 
emotions of everyday politics and managed to reconcile people, 
Yeltsin concluded.

conveyed most "cordial congratulations" to Nelson Mandela on his 
election as new South African president. In a letter published 
in Bonn on Monday [9 May], Weizsaecker stated that the great 
mark of confidence in the free and fair elections means the 
recognition of Mandela's dedicated struggle against the inhumane 
apartheid system and his exemplary preparedness for 
reconciliation and compromise. "You have gained a great victory 
for all of mankind," Weizsaecker wrote. "In the democratic 
development and the economic shaping of the new South Africa, 
you can build on our continuous support."

  [Text] Bonn/Shaqlawa (DPA) -- The German liaison bureau in 
Kurdish northern Iraq was stormed and looted in the wake of the 
bloody power struggle between rival Kurdish parties. This is 
what Bureau Chief Eberhard Walde told DPA in a telephone 
conversation on 11 May. He said his local staff had been 
detained. 
  Earlier, Walde and other Europeans had withdrawn from the 
embattled region and gone to the Turkish border. According to 
estimates, the fights that broke out early in May have claimed 
approximately 2,000 lives. Walde is trying to find eight German 
development aid volunteers that are in the region without any 
contact with the outside world. His bureau, which was opened in 
Shaqlawa in March, was to coordinate the activities of German 
relief organizations on behalf of the Federal Government and the 
Worker Samaritan Organization.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The Federal Government has welcomed 
the unexpected decision by the Bundesbank on Wednesday [11 May] 
to cut the prime rate by 0.5 percentage points. This step -- 
the discount rate was cut from 5.0 to 4.5 percent and the 
Lombard rate from 6.5 to 6.0 percent -- will provide an 
additional boost to "the ever clearer economic upswing," Finance 
Minister Theo Waigel said. With its policy of cutting 
interests, the Bundesbank is reacting to the Federal 
Government's successful policy of consolidation." 
  Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt, however, added that not 
only industry and labor but the government, too, ought to pursue 
a policy that is guided by the objective of stability. Public 
budgets must be further consolidated "so that the economy can 
continue its upward trend." As far as wage and salary demands 
are concerned, it is still necessary to pursue a restrained 
course. The Bundesbank is now using "the room it is being 
conceded by the financial and wage policy, thus supporting the 
recovery of the economy, which is beginning to show."

  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 10 -- Following are the biographies 
of Premier Silvio Berlusconi and the members of his new cabinet: 
<H5>  Silvio Berlusconi -- Premier </H5>
  Entrepreneur Silvio Berlusconi was born in Milan on 
September 
29, 1936 and obtained a law degree from Milan University. 
  He began his business career at the age of 23 as general 
manager of a building contracting firm and in 1961 founded the 
Cantieri Riuniti Milanesi construction company. Two years later 
he founded Edilnord, which in five years planned and built a 
4,000 unit housing center in Brugherio, on the outskirts of 
Milan. His second major project was Milano 2, for 10,000 
inhabitants, designed and begun in 1972. It was followed by 
Milano 3 (for 12,000 inhabitants) in 1976. 
  Also in 1976, Berlusconi joined the shareholders of the 
Milan 
daily, IL GIORNALE and later became its publisher. He is also 
100 percent owner of TV SORRISI E CANZONI, Italy's best selling 
magazine. 
  In 1978 Berlusconi ventured further into the communications 
field by opening the Canale 5 private television channel in 
Milan, extending his network nationwide and purchasing two other 
major channels in 1980, Rete 4 and Italia 1. 
  Meanwhile he erected Il Girasole in 1979, the largest market 
center for wholesale traders in Europe. 
  In 1988 he bought a 25 percent stake in Amef, the company 
which controlled the Mondadori publishing group, and in 1990 he 
became chairman of Mondadori. 
  He also owns 25 percent of La Cinq, the first commercial 
television network in France and is president of the European 
Consortium for Commercial Television (ACT) in Brussels. His bid 
to enter the French television world in 1984 proved difficult 
and finally collapsed in 1989, but he had more success in Spain 
where he bought up a 25 percent stake in Antenna 3 in 1989. 
  Berlusconi is also a committee member of Confindustria 
[General Confederation of Italian Industry] and since 1986 is 
president and owner of the first division AC Milan soccer team, 
which this year won its third consecutive National League title. 
  Berlusconi in the 1980's found himself dragged into the 
scandal over the outlawed Propaganda Due (P-2) Masonic lodge, of 
which he was a member. He denied ever having played an active 
role in the lodge, but found himself charged with perjury in 
connection with the inquiries. 
  The late 1980's also saw him doing battle with the RAI state 
broadcasting company which sued him for unfair competition and 
unauthorised use of nationwide live broadcasting. The issue was 
settled with a new broadcasting law which many saw as 
tailor-made for the Milan magnate. 
  According to his detractors, Berlusconi's close personal 
friendship with disgraced Socialist Party chief Bettino Craxi, 
who was premier when the new broadcasting law was being drawn 
up, smoothed Berlusconi's path in mass media. 
  His awards include the 1977 Knight of the Order of Labor 
Merit of the Italian Republic and has been a member of the board 
of the Teatro Manzoni theatrical company in Milan. 
  Berlusconi has handed over management functions of his 
Fininvest empire but still retains 100 percent ownership. The 
group is Italy's third largest private enterprise. 
  Fedele Confalonieri is the new chairman of Fininvest, which 
operates in the television, advertising, publishing, 
supermarket, insurance and building sectors, generating net 
earnings of 10.5 trillion lire (6.2 billion dollars) in 1992. 
  Fininvest announced earlier this month it planned to reduce 
its stake in Mondadori to less than 50 percent. 
  Berlusconi has created his party, Forza Italia (Go Italy), 
less than three months before the March 27 elections. 
<H5>  Alfredo Biondi -- Justice </H5>
  A qualified solicitor and law graduate, Alfredo Biondi, 66, 
was born in Pisa and is currently based in Genoa. He first 
entered Parliament as a candidate for the Liberal Party (PLI) in 
1968, and remained as such until just before the March 27-28 
1994 elections when he ran successfully for the small 
conservative Center Union (UDC), grouping most of the 
ex-Liberals. 
  In 1981 Biondi became part of the parliamentary inquiry 
commission on terrorism in Italy and was thus involved in the 
investigation of Aldo Moro's murder by the Red Brigades in 1978. 
He also served as minister for European affairs in 1982 and has 
held posts on numerous committees such as constitutional 
affairs, justice, and more recently on laws reforming 
parliamentary immunity. He was deputy speaker of the Senate in 
the last legislature. 
  Within the Liberal Party Biondi maintained a high profile 
becoming national vice-secretary and later national secretary of 
the party.t

the proportional sector of the Lower House vote. 
<H5>  Giuliano Ferrara -- Relations With the Parliament </H5>
  Best known for his one-man political comment show which has 
run since 1989 on the Fininvest-owned channel Canale 5, Ferrara 
is a prominent public figure with a long involvement in media

Christian Democrats and has held posts in several parliamentary 
commissions, the last being Finance and Tax Registry.

he made his first overtures to National Alliance and later 
joined the party, in time to get elected in March.

Alliance, was born in Messina, Sicily, and is a lecturer in 
political science at Rome University, and at the private Luiss 
University, also in the capital. 
  He is an editorial columnist for the Rome conservative 
daily, 
IL TEMPO, where he has repeatedly asserted that "in democracies 
there is a constant temptation toward a perversion of plurality, 
toward an excess of plurality." Fisichella is an outspoken 
monarchist. 
<H5>  Vito Gnutti -- Industry </H5>
  Businessman Vito Gnutti, 55, was born near the northern city 
of Brescia and in the 1970s owned a steel factory with plants in 
Brescia and Milan. The company failed and in 1986 Gnutti bought 
Silexport, specializing in rifle barrels. 
  Gnutti, a long-standing member of the Lombard region's 
industrialists' association, describes his past political ideas 
as varied and said he "also" voted for non-disgraced former 
Socialist Party chief Bettino Craxi, "when I thought it was 
right to do so." He is a member of the Confindustria national 
board. 
  Lured into politics by Northern League Secretary Umberto 
Bossi, Gnutti was first elected to the Lower House in April 
1992. He received 52 percent of the vote in his Val Trompia 
constituency in last March's elections. 
<H5>  Gianni Letta -- Cabinet Undersecretary </H5>
  Gianni Letta, who announced earlier on Tuesday [10 May] that 
he gave up his post as Fininvest deputy president two days ago, 
worked as a publishing and broadcasting executive for 
Berlusconi's group from May 1987, when he became vice chairman 
of Fininvest Comunicazioni and board member of the group's 
supermarket and department store chain, Standa. 
  Before joining Fininvest, Letta's career was at the 
conservative Rome daily, IL TEMPO, where he rose from simple 
reporter in his early 20s to board member, then a top editor. 
  Letta's career at IL TEMPO ended abruptly when he confessed 
to having received 300 billion lire (187 million dollars) in 
bribes from the state-owned IRI [Institute for Industrial 
Reconstruction] colossus. Letta has always claimed the money, 
handed to him by Italstat chairman Ettore Bernabei, was part of 
a "promotional campaign" and a totally legitimate affair. 
  Letta was also anchorman for the current affairs television 
show, "Italia Domanda" ("Italy Asks") broadcast by one of the 
three Fininvest networks. 
  Born at Avezzano in the Abruzzi 59 years ago, he comes from

and was first elected to parliament in the Lower House in April 
1992. He was a member of the constitutional affairs, interior 
and cabinet office parliamentary committees. 
  Maroni led negotiations that created the League's two-way 
electoral alliance with Forza Italia in the north of Italy, and 
has stood in for Bossi more than once in talks with coalition 
partners. 
<H5>  Antonio Martino -- Foreign Affairs </H5>
  Antonio Martino, 51, an economist who studied at Chicago 
University under free-trade guru Milton Friedman, heads the 
political science faculty at Rome's private Luiss University. 
  The son of Gaetano Martino, the Liberal Party vice secretary 
who in the 1950s was education and foreign minister and among 
the signatories of the Treaty of Rome, Antonio Martino began his 
political career with the Liberals, standing for election to 
that party's secretariat in 1988. 
  In December 1993 he moved closer to electoral reform 
champion 
Mario Segni, signing an appeal for a strong alternative party to 
the Democratic Party of the Left and for Segni to become 
premier. Later he became involved in the Forza Italia 
experiment, acting as one of Berlusconi's top economic advisers 
during the March election campaign. 
  He is the author of Berlusconi's 30 percent flat tax rate 
proposal, to be compensated by a new system of taxable income 
declared. 
  Since being tipped as foreign minister, Martino has taken 
steps to reverse his reputation as an anti-European Thatcherite, 
calling for a "monetary constitution" to forge economic and 
monetary union in the EU [European Union]. 
  Unveiling his policy-thinking in a recent interview, Martino 
said that Italy would "never again be a European Cinderella." 
  "Slovenliness and unmet deadlines have made us lose face in 
Europe," he said, striking three keynotes in the defence of 
human rights, a war on national selfishness (meaning firm 
antiprotectionism in foreign trade policy), and "transparency" 
with the United States. He said these were all elements that 
broke with the "muddle along" approach he attributed to past 
governments. 
  As foreign minister, Martino intends to pay his first visits 
to the United States and Israel where, he said recently, "they 
have a very negative image of our coalition." 
<H5>  Clemente Mastella -- Labor </H5>
  Clemente Mastella, 47, was born in Benevento, near Naples, 
and joined the Christian Democratic Party early in his youth. 
He graduated from university with a degree in philosophy and

  He was first elected to the Lower House in 1976 and has been 
there ever since, joining a variety of commissions and becoming 
undersecretary for Defense under Premier Giulio Andreotti in 
1991. He has gained considerable power because of his continued 
role in the party's mass media and information department. 
  He was re-elected to parliament with the Christian Democrats 
in April 1992 but later joined the right-wing Christian 
Democratic Center and was re-elected in March on a slate run by 
the new party. 
<H5>  Giancarlo Pagliarini -- Budget </H5>
  Giancarlo Pagliarini, 52, is a certified public accountant

Bossi in 1990 and joined the Northern League. He was elected to 
the Senate with the party in April 1992. He is a member of the 
economic planning and budget commissions. 
  Among his main contributions to the League's policies is the 
proposal to privatize totally the pension system and to use 
workers' monthly pension withholdings to pay for the pensions of 
retirees, and to calculate a worker's pension according to the 
total contributions paid during his/her working life. He also 
wants to give everyone education "vouchers" and let the 
individual choose whether to attend public or private school. 
  He taught at Parma University and is on the board of several 
accounting and financial service associations, including the 
Miami-based International Independent Accountants Association. 
  He was one of the founding members of the Alliance for 
Institutional Reforms (APRI) in 1983 and has published numerous 
works on taxes, accounting, financial reports and budgeting.

  Cesare Previti is a well-known and wealthy lawyer and Silvio 
Berlusconi's personal legal adviser. Born in Reggio Calabria, 
Previti is a former member of the neofascist Italian Social 
Movement and was elected to the Senate with Forza Italia in the 
March elections. 
  Previti was the analyst who stirred a hornet's nest only a 
few weeks ago when he suggested that the judges' self-governing 
body, the Supreme Council of Magistrates (CSM), should "adapt to 
the new political reality emerging from the elections." 
According to Previti, the one-third of CSM members who are not 
judges and who in the past have been appointed by parliament 
(using a "proportional" system according to party size) from now 
on should be appointed only by the three right-wing parties 
forming the new government coalition. 
  Over 1,000 magistrates have signed a petition against 
Previti's proposal, charging that it would undermine the 
political independence of the judiciary and place it in the 
hands of the executive. 
  Previti is Forza Italia's Senate whip. 
<H5>  Adriana Poli Bortone -- Agriculture </H5>
  Adriana Poli Bortone, 50, is from the southern town of Lecce

the Education and Fine Arts commission and is on the party's 
commission for women's issues. 
  Since 1972 she has been assistant professor of Latin 
literature at Lecce University. 
  In April 1992 Poli Bortone was re-elected with the MSI, 
which 
became the National Alliance ahead of the March 28 general 
election, receiving more votes than any other party colleague in 
the Puglia region.

Varese. The following year he was elected a member of the 
Lombardy regional council. 
  Speroni, in October 1991, was elected president of the 
Northern League-Lombard League and in April 1992 was elected to 
the Senate in his home constituency under a joint 
Northern-Lombard League ticket. 
  He is the Northern League's party whip in the Upper House 
and 
is a member of the Constitutional Affairs, Interior and Prime

most powerful right-wing politicians there, he is considered one 
of National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini's closest aides and 
will "represent" the south in the premier's office. 
  He was a member of the Justice, Public Works, Finance and 
Treasury, Culture, Science and Education commissions and was 
also a member of the joint commission on Information, Security 
Services and State Secrecy. 
  He is Lower House whip for the MSI, now the National 
Alliance, and a member of the national secretariat. He was also 
among the founders of the association, Young Italy, and has held 
several local administration posts in his southern hometown of 
Bari. 
  Roberto Maroni of the Northern League last week said of 
Tatarella that, "speaking with him, I feel as if I were talking 
to an old-time Christian Democrat." 
<H5>  Giulio Tremonti -- Finance </H5>
  Giulio Tremonti, 45, is professor of tax law at the 
university of Pavia and is a free-lance tax consultant. He is 
also working in the Commission for Currency Reform and in two 
technical committees at the Finance Ministry. 
  He is a member of the so-called Liberal Democratic 
Foundation, which split from the Pact for Italy after the March 
elections to join Berlusconi's alliance. 
  Tremonti, however, began his political career as a Socialist 
and first ran unsuccessfully in the 1987 elections. He was also 
a consultant for then Socialist Finance Minister Rino Formica, 
has offices in Milan and Rome and writes commentaries for the 
Milan daily, CORRIERE DELLA SERA. 
  He reportedly had a falling out with Formica, thus 
"fortunately" ruining his chances of being appointed head of 
IRI's SNAM [National Gas Pipeline Company] industrial unit 
(whose chairman was later put under investigation for 
corruption). 
  At the end of last year Tremonti hit the spotlight with the 
timely publication of a book on fiscal federalism, an issue 
close to the heart of the Northern League, and quickly picked up 
by all other parties during the election campaign. One of his 
main theses is that revenues should shift from indirect to 
direct taxes. 
<H5>  Giuliano Urbani -- Public Sector Industry and Regions </H5>

the Institute for International Policy Studies (ISPI) and 
chairman of the scientific committee of the Einaudi Foundation. 
He teaches political science and is director of the research 
and studies center of comparative politics at Milan's Bocconi 
University. 
  Urbani, known to combine a diplomatic manner with firmness 
and determination, is the main architect of Forza Italia's 
institutional platform. According to this advocate of good 
government, Berlusconi's movement should be firmly anchored in 
the center of the nation's political spectrum and interpret a 
capacity for renewal in a liberal key. 
<H5>  Giorgio Bernini -- Foreign Trade </H5>
  Giorgio Bernini, a lawyer and professor, was born in Bologna 
on 9 November 1928. After teaching in Ferrara and Padua,

neuropsychiatry at the University of Pisa. As a handicapped 
person, he has made it his life's work to combat all kinds of 
discrimination, publishing dozens of essays and articles on the 
matter. In 1981, he was responsible for the ministerial 
commission's group on rehabilitation and social services for the 
International Year of the Handicapped and was subsequently a 
member of the select committee at the Health Ministry for the 
national census of the handicapped. Before that, he worked at 
mental health centers and rehabilitation services in the Marches 
area. In 1988, he was appointed head of the department for 
handicapped affairs at the CGIL [Italian General Confederation 
of Industry] national office and then at the handicapped rights 
monitoring office of the same organization. From 1990 to 1993, 
he was responsible for the problems of handicapped and 
marginalized people at the European Trade Union Confederation 
(ETUC), and in this capacity he worked at the EC and in 
humanitarian missions in developing countries. 
  "Politically, Guidi, after aligning himself with the PDS 
[Democratic Party of the Left] and then the PSI [Italian 
Socialist Party] as a member of the National Assembly, at the 
last general elections was a candidate on the lists of Forza 
Italia, winning a seat in the Chamber of Deputies. 
<H5>  Domenico Comino -- Community Policy </H5>
  Once defined by Bossi as "the League's Schwarzenegger" 
because of his athletic physique, Domenico Comino, 38 years and 
the new minister of community policy, has a degree in agrarian 
sciences from the University of Turin. In the Piedmont capital 
city, he was -- not coincidentally -- the League candidate for 
the post of mayor. He has taught agrarian sciences at higher 
secondary schools and worked as an agronomist since 1983. 
  Elected town councillor in his city on the civic independent 
list, Comino was also a Northern League candidate for a position 
as provincial councillor in Cuneo, but was not elected. He 
became a deputy in the political consultations of 1992 for the 
electoral constituency of Cuneo-Asti-Alessandria, with 16,027 
votes. During the last legislative session, Comino was on the 
Chamber of Deputies' committee on agriculture.

<F P=106> [Interview with National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini by </F>
Mauro Anselmo; place and date not given: "We Shall Have Another 
Great Victory"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Anselmo] How did you feel 
when [Prime Minister] Berlusconi read out the list of ministers 
and it included men from the former MSI [Italian Social 
Movement]? 
  [Fini] I was satisfied. I was satisfied, but I had my feet 
firmly on the ground. 
  [Anselmo] Did you think that it would be difficult for the 
Right to govern because they have never governed? 
  [Fini] No. Because I am a realist. I do not hide from 
difficulties. However, at the same time I am also convinced of 
one thing. It will be useful to govern, because the Right will 
put itself to the test in government and it will get rid of a 
lot of commonplaces. 
  [Anselmo] What commonplaces? 
  [Fini] That only the Left is sensitive to problems like the 
environment, work, our cultural heritage, and schools. 
  [Anselmo] Mr. Fini, is the accusation that this government 
has fascist ministers also a commonplace? 
  [Fini] It is the chorus of those who do not want to 
understand. Fascism ended in 1945 but the story continues. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Anselmo] How were the ministers chosen? 
  [Fini] I put forward the names of men who were sufficiently 
competent to handle some of the ministries well. Then I left it 
to the prime minister-designate. 
  [Anselmo] Are you sorry that Tremaglia was not included? 
  [Fini] I am very pleased that there is a Ministry for the 
Italians in the World. It is a battle that we have fought, and 
Tremaglia in particular, and we have obtained a result anyway. 
  [Anselmo] Have you heard the joke going around the house? 
The right-wing Communists were in government first. 
  [Fini] It is not a joke. It is the truth. 
  [Anselmo] And do you take the merit for the Right getting 
into government, Mr. Fini? 
  [Fini] I know my defects, and being presumptuous is not one 
of them. I do not need to reply. 
  [Anselmo] What does the Right want to do in government? 
  [Fini] We shall do something that is very simple with our 
five ministers. We shall guarantee the values of honesty, 
efficiency, and cleanliness. 
  [Anselmo] When will you cast off the nostalgic pure 
hardliners, and take the rebirth of the Right to be a fact? 
  [Fini] It is contradictory for people to tell me that I must 
be democratic, and I am, respectful of pluralism (and I 
certainly am), and sensitive to dialogue, and then to add that I 
must get rid of this person and that person. Oh no gentlemen, be 
a little coherent. Only dictators throw people out, and I am not 
a dictator. 
  [Anselmo] Then how will you deal with right-wing members of 
your party when they challenge you? 
  [Fini] I am going my own way, and you can be sure that I 
will 
go ahead. 
  [Anselmo] Do you mean that you will not throw anybody out 
but 
that somebody should leave of his own accord? 
  [Fini] The problem belongs to those who risk not being able 
to associate themselves with what I say and do. They will tell 
me and then we will see. 
  [Anselmo] It was a businessman, Silvio Berlusconi, who 
pulled 
the MSI out of the refrigerator. Why? 
  [Fini] Because only a man who was outside politics and its 
games could break the hard skin of ostracism that has kept the 
Right isolated for 50 years. 
  [Anselmo] What did you find most disturbing about that 
ostracism? 
  [Fini] The absolute lack of desire to try to understand us. 
One of the things that I found most entertaining and infuriating 
happened during the election campaign for the Rome City Council. 
For seven days the television transmitted my face-to-face 
meetings with Rutelli. And what did you hear going around? 
That Fini is saying things that are right too. However, I had 
not invented anything. I was there before, too. I had not done 
my makeup to go on television. However, people did not know us, 
because the television had ignored us and the doors had been 
barred. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Sisde Director Antonio Salazar by Andrea </F>
Purgatori; place and date not given: "Mysterious Sickness Not 
Within Sisde"--first paragraph is CORRIERE DELLA SERA 
introduction] 
  [Text] Rome -- There has been no "purge" within Sisde 
[Intelligence and Democratic Security Service] -- merely a 
general cleansing operation that has led to the dismissal of 300 
personnel termed "unnecessary or unfit," and whoever 
"insinuates" that the aim was to make way for some 50 
"favorites" is "lying" and will answer for it in court. As for 
spying on the parties, after the polemics over the file on the 
League, from now on there will be very strict rules. There will 
be no reports on any "political and official organizations," and 
no activities will be permitted "outside the sphere of 
institutional responsibilities." Center chiefs will pay 
personally for any violations. After eight months at the head 
of a storm-tossed Sisde, Domenico Salazar talked about agents 
"retiring" and others entering on duty, including those with 
"famous fathers," who have, he said, displayed "a high degree of 
professionalism and expertise." He also talked about the "bogus 
train bomb" -- reports of which had an "authenticity rating of 
C3, that is, very low" but which nevertheless had to be 
investigated. He talked about the "misfortune" of the "black 
sheep" (namely, [former Sisde chief] Broccoletti and company) 
who involved in scandals and trials a service that now "has to 
regain the dignity that it needs in the eyes of the public and 
the media." Suspicions, polemics, accusations. The service, 
Salazar said, "is operating well," but "that does not seem to 
interest anyone." Is this the fault of an image that has now 
been "distorted" by those who are still trying to undermine it? 
"The mysterious sickness is not within Sisde. It is outside." 
This is what he had to say: 
  [Purgatori] Mr. Salazar, during your period as director of 
Sisde, some 300 agents have been dismissed. This constitutes an 
outright purge.... 
  [Salazar] People have been excessively alarmist about this 
alleged "purge," though that term is very remote from the actual 
truth of the matter. When I assumed my post, I was asked to 
assess the usefulness, professionalism, and reliability of my 
personnel with a view to making Sisde as efficient and reliable 
an organization as possible from the viewpoint of democratic 
security. And this is precisely what I have done. 
  [Purgatori] On the basis of what criteria? 
  [Salazar] Only one, the only feasible one in practice: to 
have members of staff assessed by their own office chiefs. This 
is such a general and obvious rule that it applies to all 
offices in the world, whether public or private, so I do not 
think I need to say any more about it. Every division chief 
classified his own staff according to different productivity 
ratings, without any outside influence, and placed in the lowest 
bracket those that were superfluous or unfit to work for Sisde. 
  [Purgatori] Were they unreliable, incompetent, or corrupt? 
  [Salazar] They simply failed to satisfy the criteria I just 
mentioned. Personally, I do not even know these members of 
staff. On average, they entered service five years ago, that is, 
well before I assumed my post. 
  [Purgatori] Some of them have already taken legal action to 
be reinstated or to protest the decisions. Can you rule out 
abuses or vendettas on the part of your division chiefs? 
  [Salazar] Well, some people have suggested such a 
possibility. But if there were any abuses or vendettas on the 
part of division chiefs, I certainly could not know about them. 
Be that as it may, these libelous charges must be supported by 
concrete evidence. 
  [Purgatori] Sisde is a hotbed of nepotism -- sons of 
politicians, magistrates, generals, officials. How many of them 
have you dismissed? 
  [Salazar] I can only tell you that on the basis of the 
assessments 67 individuals were returned to their respective 
administrations or at least transferred to another 
administration according to a precise and rigorous procedure. A 
further 170 people were separated from service for various 
reasons -- mostly with pensions or special early pension 
arrangements. Since our manpower totals some 300,000, it seems 
to me that there is no connection between transfers or 
dismissals on the one hand and the employment of temporary 
personnel on the other. These latter total some 50 and could 
all easily be allocated to some of the 300 vacant positions. But 
there has been a great deal of nonsense talked about the 
business of these temporary staff, too, thus creating alarm by 
focusing public attention on a nonexistent problem. 
  [Purgatori] Did the purge not serve precisely to make way 
for 
further sons of the famous and temporary staff? 
  [Salazar] Such an insinuation is an absolute lie, and those 
responsible for it will answer for it in the appropriate forums. 
Be that as it may, the regularization of the position of 
temporary staff -- who are fully entitled to assert their own 
position in the courts -- was not a hasty initiative on my part 
but the implementation of precise requirements on the basis of 
instructions from the Prime Minister's Office. If these 
temporary staff have famous fathers, that would be reason enough 
for me to avoid making unfair comments. During our internal 
competition we established that these people display a high 
degree of professionalism and expertise. It would be a strange 
circumstance if all the fathers' sins were to fall on their 
sons, and by sins I mean the very fact that their fathers are 
famous. 
  [Purgatori] Sisde is under a cloud of suspicions, legal 
inquiries, and a generally negative public opinion. The 
business of the bogus train bomb was not a heroic episode. Then 
there are the suspicions in connection with the bombings in 
Rome, Florence, and Milan. 
  [Salazar] Look, I am tired of repeating that the train bomb 
-- an operation started before I assumed this post -- was merely 
one of over 700 reports in the field of organized crime, added 
to which there are the approximately 500 reports in the field of 
terrorism and subversion. We have had over 500 people arrested, 
have captured 70 wanted persons, and so forth. Why should a 
single erroneous report be so important within the overall 
context of our work? 
  [Purgatori] But an erroneous report, especially if it 
concerns a bombing, could bring a secret service to its knees. 
  [Salazar] So I should explain. We prepare reports 
originating from a certain source, which we try to assess as 
best we can. And over 95 percent of our reports are confirmed. 
But it must be clear that on the whole these reports by the 
services constitute only pointers or suspicions, which it is 
then the duty of the judicial police to investigate and to back 
up with supporting evidence. The results of this are presented 
to the judicial authorities, not to us. So we cannot be 
answerable for the accuracy or otherwise of the report, even 
though we do assess it. 
  [Purgatori] And what happened in the case of the bogus bomb? 
  [Salazar] What happened was that the report was issued with 
a 
reliability rating of C3, that is, very low. But that does not 
alter the fact that all possible kinds of checks had to be 
carried out immediately. Let me ask you: Faced with the 
possibility that there is a bomb on an aircraft or a train, 
would you be prepared not to forward the report to the police 
immediately so that all possible checks could be carried out? I 
do not think so. So it seems to me that it is time to put an 
end to this business of our "disgrace." 
  [Purgatori] Let us talk about the incompetence of the 
untrained personnel and Sisde's lack of international 
credibility. 
  [Salazar] I must deny this immediately. Consider that when 
the head of the secret service of a neighboring country heard 
that, after the well-known events, it was intended to deprive 
Sisde of the autonomy that it enjoyed, he immediately offered to 
bear witness to our efficiency in an international forum. 
  [Purgatori] The issue of the file on the League remains 
unresolved. You maintain that it contained newspaper cuttings. 
But the service's past suggests something quite different. Do 
you or do you not spy on the parties? 
  [Salazar] It must suffice for you to know that I have in 
fact 
issued instructions to all operational staff for center chiefs 
to confine themselves to intelligence activities of strict 
institutional relevance without straying from their proper 
sphere of responsibility. I expressly forbade any intelligence 
activities with respect to political and official organizations 
and stated in writing that any violations would constitute 
illegal and unauthorized actions. The consequences would be the 
personal responsibility of the center chief himself. 
  [Purgatori] Tell us what crises Sisde is tackling and has to 
resolve in the midst of this storm. 
  [Salazar] The first problem, and the greatest, is how to 
enable Sisde to regain its proper dignity in the eyes of the 
public and the media. But I still cannot understand why, with 
all the structures that have had the misfortune to encounter 
black sheep (and frankly, I do not know which of them has none), 
the same attitude has not been adopted, but an issue has been 
made only in the case of a body whose principal responsibility 
is precisely to defend the state. 
  [Purgatori] Mr. Salazar, what is your mysterious sickness? 
  [Salazar] I could reply that the newspapers are not helping 
us. It does not seem to interest anyone that this organization 
is operating well. 
  The sole concern is to seek out disappointed dismissed 
personnel, to impart a distorted image of the service and its 
staff, to highlight what is wrong, even if that is now water 
under the bridge. As you can see, the mysterious sickness is not 
within Sisde. It is outside.

  [Text] Paris, May 11 (AFP) -- UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali said Wednesday [11 May] he hoped to obtain the 
release of 11 French aid workers held by Bosnian Serbs since 
April for alleged arms trafficking. 
  "We hope that through negotiation we can find a way to free 
the hostages," he said after a 45-minute meeting with French 
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur. 
  The 11 are from the Premiere Urgence (First Emergency) 
group, 
which denies the smuggling allegations. 
  Balladur later told the French National Assembly, or lower 
house, that the government was determined to see them freed and 
"is using all the means it can to obtain their unconditional 
release." 
  They have been held since April 8 at the Sarajevo suburb of 
Lukavica by Bosnian Serbs, who have just extended their 
detention for a month pending trial and say the detainees could 
face up to 15 years in prison. 
  In Sarajevo, two lawyers sent by the Paris bar association 
and a Belgian colleague criticized both the Serb jailers and 
French officials in the Bosnian capital, saying Wednesay the 11 
could only hope for a "mock trial in a mock country." 
  The lawyers, who saw all the prisoners, said they were 
initially crammed into one room which created tension, then 
assigned a lawyer who did not speak their language, said 
George-Henri Beauthier, a representative of the Brussels-based 
International Federation of Human Rights Leagues. 
  He charged that the 11 were being used by the Serbs as 
"merchandise" to try to gain international recognition. 
  The lawyers also questioned the 14-day delay before the 
French ambassador in Sarajevo, Henri Jacolin, saw the group. 
But Jacolin told AFP Wednesday the situation on the ground had 
not helped and that only "quiet negotiations" could move the 
matter forward.

  [Text] Geneva, May 11 (AFP) -- The UN High Commissioner 
for Refugees is short of 236 million dollars to help until 
year's end four million refugees from the former Yugoslavia, the 
agency said Wednesday [11 May]. 
  The UNHCR said it needed a total 338 million dollars for the 
entire year -- or 918,000 dollars a day -- but had received only 
102 million dollars from donor countries by March 31, leaving a 
236-million-dollar hole. 
  The main beneficiary of United Nations aid is 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, followed by Croatia.

  [Text] Vienna, May 10 (AFP) -- A total of 485 nuclear 
reactors were either on stream or under construction globally 
last year, according to a report published Tuesday [10 May] by 
the International Atomic Energy Agency at its Vienna 
headquarters. 
  Last year saw the start-up of nine reactors in Canada, 
China, 
France, Japan, Russia and the United States, taking the number 
of operational sites to 430, with 55 under construction in 18 
countries, the IAEA said. 
  Several states, led by France and Lithuania, depend largely 
on nuclear power for their supplies of electricity.

<F P=106> [Interview with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz by </F>
Gudrun Harrer in Vienna; date not given: "Iraq Has Fulfilled 
the UN Resolutions"] 
  [Text] [Harrer] You have come to Vienna to hold talks with 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), one of the bodies 
that decides whether or not Iraq has complied with UN 
Resolutions 687 and 715, on which the lifting of the sanctions 
depends. The UN Security Council is meeting again in the middle 
of May to discuss Iraq. What is the IAEA position toward Iraq? 
  ['Aziz] We have satisfactory, normal relations with the 
IAEA. 
The IAEA has noted the major progress we have achieved in 
fulfilling the conditions, and we want this information to be 
conveyed to New York. 
  [Harrer] The last time the Council met, in the middle of 
March, it voted against the lifting of the sanctions vis-a-vis 
Iraq. 
  ['Aziz] If a free, secret vote were to be held, the majority 
of the Council would vote for the lifting, or at least a 
relaxation, of the sanctions. Even in March, some Council 
members were in favor of issuing a public statement recognizing 
Iraq's progress. The U.S. side opposed the idea. But, for the 
first time, the Council failed to adopt a statement against the 
lifting of the sanctions because a consensus was not reached on 
this matter. That says a lot. 
  [Harrer] Are you optimistic this time? 
  ['Aziz] It is the Council's credibility that is at stake. 
The Council adopted resolutions that were formulated in clear 
language. Iraq has fulfilled these resolutions. If certain 
Council members choose to ignore this fact -- and this has been 
documented not by Iraq, but by UN bodies -- they are undermining 
the credibility of the Council itself and its resolutions. 
  Most countries, including Austria, merely want Iraq to 
fulfill the resolutions that were adopted in connection with 
Kuwait -- nothing more and nothing less. However, when other 
things are suddenly brought into play, such as a unilateral U.S. 
policy vis-a-vis Iraq, and the United States attempts to impose 
its unilateral wishes on the Council, the Council's image is 
bound to suffer. 
  [Harrer] How much progress has been achieved in installing 
control systems inside Iraqi armaments plants? 
  ['Aziz] Things are moving quickly, and we are doing what is 
necessary in this connection. UN special envoy Rolf Ekeus 
confirmed this in his report at the end of April. 
  [Harrer] Apart from France and China, Russia also spoke out 
in favor of Iraq at the March Security Council meeting. What 
are your relations with Russia like, and is there any truth to 
the rumors that Vladimir Zhirinovskiy supports the Iraqi Ba'ath 
Party? 
  ['Aziz] Our relations are good. Russia has great economic 
interests in Iraq. Zhirinovskiy visited Iraq in 1992 and 
expressed support for our standpoint. But we do not imagine we 
can influence Russian domestic policy, and we certainly have no 
money to support other parties. Zhirinovskiy invited a Ba'ath 
delegation to his party's latest congress, but the Iraqis also 
used this opportunity to talk to all other parties with the 
exception of Russia's Choice, as well as holding talks at the 
Russian Foreign Ministry. 
  [Harrer] What are moods like in Iraq after four years of 
sanctions? Is a radicalization of the population to be feared? 
What about the opinions that Iraq's claim to Kuwait is by no 
means a closed chapter? 
  ['Aziz] The Iraqi population is suffering much hardship 
because of the sanctions, but we are an ancient civilization, 
and we will survive. You will hardly find anyone who says he 
hates the American people. 
  For the government, the Kuwait issue is finished, but one 
cannot stop people from thinking whatever they want to think. 
One cannot erase historical facts either. But the Iraqis 
support the government and know that what the government is 
doing -- for example, implementing the resolutions in order to 
permit the lifting of the sanctions, is good for the country. 
  I think frustration is the cause of such opinions concerning 
the Kuwait issue. People see Iraq doing everything the United 
Nations wants, but this does nothing to help them, and their 
situation gets even worse. But this has nothing do with the 
government's stance. 
  [Harrer] What is Baghdad's relationship with the Kurdish 
leaders Talabani and Barzani? 
  ['Aziz] In 1991, they spent several months in Baghdad, and 
one reached a consensus with them concerning the extent and form 
of autonomy, Kurdish involvement in the central government, 
elections, and so on. Barzani told us later that no sooner had 
he and Talabani returned to northern Iraq when they were 
summoned to Washington. Talabani went, but Barzani did not. In 
Washington, Talabani was told: "Are you crazy supporting Saddam 
Husayn's government when we want to topple it?" That was the 
end for the time being. The Kurds are not free to decide.

  [Text] Paris, May 11 (AFP) -- French Defence Minister 
Francois Leotard and his counterparts from the three Baltic 
states Wednesday [11 May] signed the first military cooperation 
accord among their countries in Paris. 
  Leotard said the agreements "open up new perspectives in 
relations between France and each of the three (Baltic) states" 
allowing bilateral exercises as well as joint manoeuvres within 
the framework of the NATO Partnership for Peace, a military 
coooperation agreement recently signed by several East European 
states. 
  Estonian Defence Minister Indrek Kannik stressed that his 
country and Latvia and Lithuania attached great importance to 
participation in all international forums. 
  Leotard said Wednesday's accords would provide for young 
soldiers to attend training courses in French military schools 
and for wide-ranging exchanges of military personnel.

<F P=106> [Anne Segall and Christopher Lockwood report: "Tax Rises </F>
Will Put Brake on Britain's Recovery, Says EC"] 
  [Text] Last month's tax increases will depress consumer 
spending causing the economy to falter next year just as the 
rest of Europe accelerates out of recession, the European 
Commission claimed yesterday. 
  Mr Henning Christophersen, Commission vice president, said 
that after leading Europe in 1994 Britain was likely to 
underperform its main Continental rivals in 1995. 
  The commission has raised its expectations for Europe and is 
now looking for overall growth of 16 per cent this year and 2.5 
per cent in 1995. The new forecasts came as the German 
Bundesbank announced an unexpected half point cut -- to 4 per 
cent -- in its key discount rate, thereby underpinning the 
optimism about European growth. 
  The forecast for the British economy is being cut to 2.3 per 
cent next year, down from an original 2.7 per cent and below 
Government projection for this year of 2.5 per cent growth. 
  However, the commission's pessimism is not shared by the 
majority of independent economists in Britain. They believe 
that as consumer spending slows, the momentum of the economy 
will be maintained through higher exports and rising levels of 
investment. 
  This view is supported by a Confederation of British 
Industry 
survey which yesterday revealed that exports have become a key 
factor in the revival of industry. 
  All eleven regions of the country are now benefiting from 
higher order levels, the first time this has happened for five 
years, the survey reveals. 
  A slowdown in consumption would not be unwelcome to the 
authorities. Mr Eddie George, the Governor of the Bank of 
England, said last night that steady and sustained growth would 
be preferable to the kind of booms of the past which would lead 
to an inevitable bust. 
  Speaking in the City, Mr George said: "If we are patient, we 
now have the best opportunity that I can recall to achieve 
continuing, steady expansion that can be sustained through much 
of the rest of the decade. Now I know that some people say, 
`That's all very well, but it still doesn't feel much like a 
recovery. Demand is not like it was in the boom; house prices 
are not going up much; and I still don't feel much better off.' 
  "But that is precisely the point -- we have to avoid the 
excesses of the late 1980s, which felt wonderfully good in the 
short-term, but which were the root cause of the misery that 
followed." 
  A survey from the Institute of Directors, due out today, 
will 
also report the most significant increase in orders, business 
volume and profits since the start of the recovery. The picture 
of an economy which is still gathering momentum was underlined 
yesterday by figures showing an increase in manufacturing output 
of 14 per cent in the first quarter of the year -- the fastest 
quarterly growth rate since 1989. 
  Recovery in Europe would be welcomed by British businesses 
which have been struggling to increase sales on the Continent 
despite a competitive pound. Surveys suggest that the 
improvement in the European economy has already had a beneficial 
impact on export orders in Britain. 
  The commission's forecasts are not all negative. Britain's 
borrowing requirement is expected to go on falling, to well 
below the EC average next year, as will its unemployment rate. 
It calculates that unemployment in Britain will fall to 9.3 per 
cent in 1995, compared to 9.5 per cent in Germany, 11.4 per cent 
in France and 11.7 per cent in Italy. 
  Mr Christophersen said: "The recovery in all EC countries is 
stronger than we had thought... the only exception is the UK."

<F P=106> [Terence Shaw report: "Britain Aids Human Rights Court </F>
Reform"] 
  [Text] Britain was among 31 countries that signed an 
agreement in Strasbourg yesterday for reform of the Council of 
Europe's machinery for protecting human rights. 
  The aim is to provide a streamlined procedure for dealing 
with alleged violations under the European Human Rights 
Convention whose enforcement machinery is in crisis because of a 
burgeoning workload. 
  Cases are taking an average of five years, and sometimes 
nine 
years, to resolve. Without the reforms the delays are expected 
to worsen as more central and eastern European countries sign 
the Convention. 
  Under the agreement, known as the 11th Protocol to the 
European Human Rights Convention, the two-tier system of 
commission and court for investigating and adjudicating alleged 
violations will be replaced by a single court in permanent 
session. 
  It will absorb the role of the commission, deciding if cases 
are admissible, and if so to investigate their merits, then seek 
a settlement. If this fails, it delivers an opinion on whether 
there has been a breach of the Convention. 
  Under the present system, cases can then be referred to the 
Strasbourg court, which, after a hearing gives a binding 
judgment on Governments found to be in breach. 
  In the new system, people in the states of the Council of 
Europe will have direct access to Strasbourg after exhausting 
domestic remedies. The court will have one judge for each 
country, elected for six years by the council's Parliamentary 
Assembly. 
  Most cases will be decided by seven judges. A committee of 
three will take over the role of the commission in deciding 
whether complaints are initially admissible. 
  Cases raising important issues of interpretation of the 
Convention can be referred by the normal seven-judge court for 
adjudication by a larger "Grand Chamber'' of 17 judges, unless 
one party objects.

  [Excerpts] Admiral Carmo Duro is in trouble following an 
interview given to the press. The Oeiras [outside Lisbon] NATO 
commander spoke about the possibility of that command being 
closed down. Some people assumed that this information was a 
fact, and this was a good enough reason for NATO and the 
Ministry of Defense to want to know what was really going on. 
More details from Cid Saldanha: 
  [Saldanha] It all started with an interview Admiral Carmo 
Duro gave about a NATO exercise. In response to a question by 
Renascenca, the Oeiras NATO commander spoke about a hypothetical 
closure of this Atlantic command, a possibility that may never 
come through. It all depends on NATO's will and the opinion of 
its member countries: 
  [Begin Commander Carmo Duro recording] If NATO is to be 
paying increasingly less attention to the MSCs [military sealift 
command], let us admit that some ideas generated on the other 
side of the Atlantic lead to, or might lead to, NATO saying that 
it does not want any more MSC's in the Atlantic. At that stage, 
I believe there would be a greater pressure for this command to 
be rotating. The issue will be more of a national concern rather 
than a NATO concern, at that point. [passage omitted] 
  As I have stated, this is a possibility that may be raised; 
and, although I do not have access to documents, it is in some 
people's minds. It is possible it will be brought up at the 
[word indistinct] Maritime Seminar scheduled to take place at 
the end of June; it may or may not. It all depends on the 
sensibility Admiral Miller finds in other commands -- the 
SACEUR. [end recording] 
  [Saldanha] The SACEUR -- the NATO Command in Brussels -- 
recorded the interview and sent it to NATO in Oeiras. [passage 
omitted] 
  Admiral Carmo Duro's words did not go down well, either in 
Brussels or at the Ministry of Defense in Portugal. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Madrid, 11 May (EFE) -- Spanish Prime Minister 
Felipe Gonzalez reiterated today, Wednesday, his decision not to 
resign and to remain in charge of the executive branch to 
achieve "an atmosphere of confidence, which is necessary for 
strengthening the economy." 
  In an appearance before the Parliament, Gonzalez recognized 
the "social alarm" and the "political uncertainty experienced in 
the last few days" in Spain, but he pointed out that "a greater 
atmosphere of instability would be created" if I were to resign. 
  Gonzalez said he was willing to ask for the parliament's 
vote 
of confidence but only "at the necessary moment and that moment 
is not here yet."

<F P=106> [Report by Xavier Ventura: "CiU Deems Government's Attitude </F>
Toward Tackling Corruption Positive and Firm"] 
  [Text] Barcelona -- The Convergence and Union (CiU) 
leadership yesterday confirmed its support for the Felipe 
Gonzalez government in deeming positive the measures adopted by 
it in order to combat corruption. The CiU liaison committee, 
which met yesterday, Monday, decided to grant the Socialist 
Party a margin of confidence, after assessing that the recent 
resignations of some of its members and the announced intention 
expressed by the prime minister to tackle corruption show "a 
positive will" to resolve this problem, now regarded as the main 
threat to Spanish political stability. 
  To this effect, the liaison committee pointed out in its 
final communique that political stability is essential for the 
country's necessary economic recovery. According to the 
nationalist coalition's leaders, Spain's current situation 
requires clear political stability, since it is "an essential 
factor for economic recovery, necessary for job creation." 
Hence, CiU yesterday publicly guaranteed its support for the 
Socialist government again, although some of its leaders do not 
conceal their reservations about what they deem to be the 
government's irretrievable public image and the excessive 
slowness in tackling the corruption cases affecting the PSOE 
[Spanish Socialist Workers Party]. 
  The liaison committee meeting was chaired by Jordi Pujol on 
behalf of Convergence and by Josep Antoni Duran Lleida on behalf 
of Union and lasted more than two hours. Among other topics, 
the recent statements by Jose Maria Aznar, who accused CiU of 
"blackmailing" the government and Spain, were analyzed. 
According to the coalition's leaders, the People's Party 
leader's remarks fall within a campaign by the conservative 
party, which is judged "destabilizing and devoid of proposals" 
and which was described as "irresponsible" since it even impedes 
the country's economic recovery. 
  CiU's support for the government was expressed directly to 
Felipe Gonzalez by Pujol last Thursday at a meeting held in 
Madrid between the Generalitat [Catalan autonomous government] 
premier and the prime minister, shortly before the Socialist 
leader's public appearance, and it has been confirmed again now, 
two days before Gonzalez appears before the Congress [of 
Deputies] in order to report on the situation. Yesterday, it 
was Jordi Pujol again who showed the greatest desire to support 
the government, since, in his opinion, Gonzalez is determined to 
get to the bottom of the corruption problem. 
  The liaison committee also urged the government to follow 
through the economic measures adopted so far, which, according 
to the CiU leaders, have made possible the beginning of the 
economic recovery. The danger that calling an early election -- 
a possibility which, moreover, is borne in mind in the medium 
term -- will represent an insurmountable curb on Spain's 
economic recovery was one of the arguments which CiU uses to 
justify its support for the government. 
  The liaison committee's communique states that CiU's 
political stance gives priority to the struggle against 
corruption, the policy for economic recovery, and the resolute 
will to implement the autonomy policy. This last-mentioned 
point, which the crisis caused by the corruption scandals has 
apparently overshadowed, was discussed at length yesterday, 
since it is believed that progress in this field remains 
decisive for the coalition's maintaining its support for the 
government. When the meeting was over, the CiU leaders learned 
of the statements by [former Secretary of State for the National 
Plan on Drugs] Baltasar Garzon, which sources in the two parties 
played down in describing them as an internal matter for the 
Socialists.

<F P=106> [Interview with Justice and Interior Minister Juan Alberto </F>
Belloch by Jose Maria Brunet in Madrid; date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Brunet] Do you consider the 
government's political responsibilities concerning the 
corruption affairs to have been discharged with the resignations 
that have occurred? 
  [Belloch] The events that have occurred have meant accepting 
particularly rigorous political responsibilities, largely owing 
to the social atmosphere that has been created. This does not 
mean that there could not be more people accepting 
responsibility if there are further developments or information. 
But with what we have right now, this matter has been resolved, 
except for those who can only repeat: "Resign, Mr. Gonzalez." 
That assertion does not acquire further intellectual nuances by 
being said many more times. That kind of line is unreasonable 
from the democratic viewpoint, because Felipe Gonzalez won the 
election with a very clear message that he was going to act 
against corruption. If we who work with him do not do our jobs 
well, let us be called to account at the polls. 
  [Brunet] Do you believe that the government and Felipe 
Gonzalez have suffered a grave deterioration over the past few 
days? 
  [Belloch] My sincere opinion is that it depends whether or 
not we do things well. If we are able to restore an atmosphere 
of calm and win confidence through sensible and balanced 
actions, he will more than surmount the crisis and carry out 
what he promised and what we members of his government must now 
implement. 
  [Brunet] There is an impression that this crisis could be 
tackled because the nationalists have caused the government to 
dig its heels in and shake off its doubts. 
  [Belloch] I do not believe so. All that I believe is that 
this has been a month in which it had to be shown which is the 
parliamentary majority and which is the minority. Naturally, 
majorities are formed in accordance with their own laws; the 
partners in that majority have the right and duty to intervene 
and act. That is what has happened, but I would not submit a 
confidence motion right now. It would be like succumbing to a 
minor pitfall. If anybody should submit anything, the People's 
Party should submit a censure motion. A confidence motion makes 
sense only when you lose the parliamentary majority -- that is, 
the vote on an important bill. 
  [Brunet] Why has cooperation between yourself and Baltasar 
Garzon not been possible, when you are both judges and 
independents? 
  [Belloch] The first thing that I must say is that I greatly 
regret that he has tendered his resignation. I regret it 
because he was the appropriate person to take charge of the task 
that he had -- namely, the struggle against drug trafficking, 
plus the set of policies entailed by the National Plan Against 
Drugs, and also the possibility of coordinating anticorruption 
units. He had the right profile for that task, and that is why 
I offered him that post. But I am going to create a 
secretaryship of state for the interior, and I certainly have 
not offered him that. I believe that the profile of a secretary 
of state for the interior is different. He has very 
wide-ranging duties and a very different set of general 
guidelines, and another profile is needed for that. I believe 
that he was not satisfied with the offer to stay in the current 
secretaryship, and that is why he tendered his resignation to me. 
  [Brunet] Garzon was the Interior Ministry's number two. 
Was there no basis for a relationship of trust between 
yourselves and for his remaining so? 
  [Belloch] The point is that we are now going to set up a 
different structure, because there is now a new ministry, the 
Ministry of Justice and the Interior. This should be organized 
in accordance with a principle of autonomy: on one hand, the 
secretaryship of state for justice and the secretaryship of 
state for the interior, and coordination from above through the 
minister, and also, in parallel, two autonomous central matters 
-- the struggle against drug trafficking and corruption, and 
prison institutions -- that should have autonomous 
secretaryships of state. That structure means that the 
secretaries of state for the interior and justice are actually 
deputy ministers or responsible overall for the area as a whole. 
I believe that they have more appropriate profiles for that 
task than Garzon. That is why, while greatly regretting it, I 
had to act accordingly. The prime minister had a high opinion 
of Baltasar and knew that he must be doing a good job in his 
field, but it matters more to me that I choose people with the 
appropriate profile. 
  [Brunet] In any event, you showed Garzon the door by saying 
in public that if he tendered his resignation, you would accept 
it. 
  [Belloch] I would be sorry for that impression to remain. It 
is true that he asked me for two weeks to reflect, and I did not 
give him them. In my opinion, it is essential to finish 
appointing the secretaries of state this weekend. As the 
situation stands, the impression of a makeshift situation must 
not be given. 
  [Brunet] Has the government "applied the scalpel" against 
corruption, as Garzon demanded? 
  [Belloch] Of course. This is not a matter of the past two 
months. When he offered me the post of justice minister, the 
prime minister told me that my aim was to combat corruption 
thoroughly, with all the means available at the Justice 
Ministry. Moreover, I am convinced that he chose me for that 
reason. There is no doubt, because it was a result of his 
commitment to the electorate with two messages -- to surmount 
the economic crisis and to end corruption and the atmosphere of 
impunity. I was one of the elements for this second major aim, 
and he appointed me minister for that reason. 
  [Brunet] The most sensational corruption cases were raised 
by 
the press. 
  [Belloch] Following my appointment, I gave the state 
attorney 
general instructions, making it clear that the struggle against 
corruption was an absolute priority in terms of criminal policy. 
After that, a series of investigations which are producing 
results began. In short, the instruments are working. 
Paradoxically, the uncovering of corruption cases can become a 
matter which disturbs the impression of calm and civil peace. 
However, it is the natural consequence of going all-out to 
combat any form of corruption. 
  [Brunet] Have you been appointed to clean up the Interior 
Ministry? 
  [Belloch] I do not believe that is the central aim. I have 
been appointed to investigate all the cases which may exist, but 
it is not fair for us to speak in general terms of the Interior 
Ministry or the Civil Guard. The Civil Guard cannot bear the 
blame of the director general who commanded it. That is not in 
keeping with the feeling of the public, who have a level of 
confidence in the security forces which many other institutions 
would like for themselves. 
  [Brunet] In any event, the prevailing view is that the 
government did not take the struggle against corruption so 
seriously before the cases of Roldan and Rubio. 
  [Belloch] That is the public impression, but it is not in 
keeping with the facts. The qualitative change in the 
assessment of the corruption phenomenon dates from the first day 
of the formation of the current government. There is, however, 
a change of approach in assessing the phenomenon's importance in 
comparison with the previous situation. If this were not so, we 
would not have been able to ensure that many investigations 
would be completed so quickly. 
  [Brunet] Do you believe that there could be concealed 
interests behind the outbreak of the Rubio affair? 
  [Belloch] I believe that precisely because we have begun a 
process of thorough investigation of corruption, there are a 
number of consequences. There are people who may have taken 
part in such activities and are rightly afraid that they will be 
uncovered. So one thing can lead to another. This could cause 
some people to play at a war of cases. We knew that this 
possibility existed when we accepted this priority, but it was 
necessary. The public's confidence cannot be restored unless we 
end this atmosphere. The public should see that this process 
has a cost but that it is unavoidable. So they should be calm. 
Cases could, of course, continue to emerge. The important 
thing is that the public support this struggle. 
  [Brunet] In any event, the question is whether the cases 
are a consequence of the current atmosphere concerning 
corruption or else are one of the causes of it. Are more cases 
emerging because there are those who have an interest in this? 
  [Belloch] There are undoubtedly moves of that kind, but I 
would like to make a general observation: You cannot switch 
from an atmosphere of a certain passivity and inhibition with 
respect to tax crime to suddenly setting up a Holy Inquisition 
or launching general inquisitorial processes. Our duty is that 
there should be neither tolerance not inquisitors in this 
respect. Inquisitors, especially those acting in the name of 
the good, have always caused very clear consequences. The 
principle of legality, calm, confidence, and balance must be 
restored. 
  [Brunet] Do you believe that an anticorruption Holy 
Inquisition has been set up? 
  [Belloch] It is clear that we cannot switch overnight from a 
situation in which the public considered that this matter of tax 
crime was a minor matter to launching a historical crusade of 
the masked warrior. I am not here for that purpose. I have 
always had a poor opinion of inquisitors, and if, moreover, the 
cause for which they fight is just, they are usually more 
dangerous. Against that, there should be reason, the 
rule-of-law state, legality, and each institution's doing its 
job, and so confidence will spread. 
  [Brunet] Over the past few days, the government has joined 
the crusade with the arrest of Rubio. 
  [Belloch] That impression may exist, but those who acted 
were 
two professional prosecuting attorneys, without anybody's 
instructions. These prosecuting attorneys immediately placed 
the matter in the hands of a police court judge. Nobody can 
express suspicions of a judge's acting with the intention of 
favoring somebody's image. This judge examined the facts and 
took the steps that he deemed opportune. Along with this, an 
atmosphere of confusion is being created according to which the 
necessary steps were not taken with Luis Roldan, who was accused 
simply of a tax offense, and in this other matter, in which the 
accusations are more serious -- because they include forgery -- 
the same people criticize the latter situation. Precautionary 
steps were not taken with Roldan, and the result is that this 
gentleman has been able to escape. In the second case, the 
steps that in fact have prevented this were taken. No 
inquisitorial spirit should be seen in this. It is a matter of 
the gravity of the alleged conduct and of the evidence gathered 
by some professionals. 
  [Brunet] Was it necessary to make these arrests by night? 
Was 
it not intended that they spend that night in the cells? 
  [Belloch] I do not believe so. The main work of this 
ministry is legality and reason. Therefore, insofar as it is my 
responsibility, I will try to ensure that there is always 
proportion in what falls within the police sphere, and the least 
possible harm is done to the accused person's rights. I reject 
any formula of the kind which they have suffered in Italy -- 
unnecessary cameras, handcuffing people needlessly, and turning 
these actions into a spectacle. It is necessary to act very 
vigorously, but always with the least possible harm to those 
accused of the offense. 
  [Brunet] The opposition says that this arrest was made on 
the 
day before Garzon's press conference in order to influence the 
atmosphere. 
  [Belloch] That is an insult to the two prosecuting attorneys 
in the case. They do not deserve it. I sincerely believe that 
that is quite enough. All those who aim to hold political 
responsibilities should realize that this leads nowhere except 
to unnecessarily discrediting the institutions and destroying 
the country. And nobody who aims to hold responsibility can 
afford that. 
  [Brunet] Could the government do nothing to prevent Roldan's 
escape? 
  [Belloch] The administration could have been more effective 
in remote surveillance or other methods which are not 
interpreted as coercion, but that is all there is to it. The 
interior minister -- a particularly courageous, honorable, 
upright, and competent person -- accepted his political 
responsibility and resigned. In any country in the world, it is 
destructive to continue to speak of these matters. 
  [Brunet] But what would you do in a similar case? 
  [Belloch] Order that there be a reasonable remote 
surveillance system in order to try to prevent escape. That is 
what I believe Asuncion did. 
  [Brunet] Then he was not obeyed. 
  [Belloch] We are investigating whether there are 
administrative responsibilities, in order to find out how those 
methods were organized. There are no conclusions as yet. 
  [Brunet] That is, the system failed; it has been shown that 
it is not always possible to reconcile individual rights with 
collective security. 
  [Belloch] It is very possible. One of the reasons for 
seriously considering a change of procedural model is because 
there are structural defects. For instance, a prosecuting 
attorney could adopt those surveillance measures. Our model has 
its difficulties. Would you accept three policemen accompanying 
you everywhere? Asuncion said so: All this has happened 
because it was the Roldan affair. In no other case would he 
have accepted political responsibility. This was an exceptional 
situation, in which the system could have worked better, but, as 
a method, it makes no sense for a gentleman against whom 
proceedings have been opened to be under police surveillance. 
  [Brunet] Is it difficult to explain to the public that there 
was no arrangement with Roldan? 
  [Belloch] Those who refer to the possibility of an 
arrangement necessarily do so in bad faith or believe that other 
people do not have a normal intelligence quotient. It is clear 
that the chief interest which the government and the minister 
had was for this not to have happened. We have launched a very 
large-scale search operation to find him. The theory of an 
arrangement is untenable. 
  [Brunet] Would you negotiate a posteriori with Roldan for 
him 
to give himself up? 
  [Belloch] The only thing of which he can be assured, like 
anybody else, is that he will have security, but the same as any 
other criminal: Excuse me, suspected criminal. [passage

  [Text] Madrid, 11 May (EFE) -- Mario Conde, former 
president of the Spanish Credit Bank (Banesto), today denied 
having collected multimillionaire commissions from the sale of 
two companies. Conde made the denial in reply to a report given 
by Luis Roldan, former director general of the Civil Guard, to 
the daily EL MUNDO. 
  According to that report, Deputy Prime Minister Narcis Serra 
ordered Roldan, who has been a fugitive of justice for the last 
two weeks and against whom there are serious accusations of 
corruption, to spy on Mario Conde and his alleged plans to 
engage in politics and to try to use Banesto as a "springboard" 
for reaching power. 
  The central bank intervened in Banesto on 28 December after 
it detected that some $4 billion was missing. It also dismissed 
Mario Conde, the top bank official. 
  EL MUNDO went on to say that Roldan entrusted the espionage 
tasks to Kroll Associates, a U.S. company, which determined that 
Conde had established a personal association with the Union of 
Swiss Banks (USB) for the joint collection of Banesto 
operations. In this manner, the newspaper added, the Swiss 
corporation shared with the former president of the Spanish bank 
group some 2.9 billion pesetas (nearly $21 million) from the 
sale of Petromed [expansion unknown] to British Petroleum and 
1.6 billion pesetas ($11.5 million) from the sale of La Union 
and El Fenix, of the Banesto group, to the French AGF. 
  In a press release, Mario Conde denies all of this 
information and charges that representatives from the Kroll 
company met last year with officials from the U.S. company J.P. 
Morgan to give them false information about him. Concerning the 
alleged surveillance carried out by Kroll against him, Conde 
showed "consternation in view of the fact that our private lives 
and our family's intimacies have been under investigation by a 
foreign company at the request of the Spanish Government." 
Likewise, he warns that if the existence of this report is 
confirmed, he will undertake proper action. 
  The daily EL MUNDO explained that the "original" report that 
contains all of this information was shown by the former 
director general of the Civil Guard and that the contents of the 
document were only known by Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, 
Deputy Prime Minister Serra, and Carlos Sochaga, who was 
minister of economics and finance at that time.

  [Text] Madrid, 11 May (EFE) -- Spanish Deputy Prime 
Minister Narciso Serra today denied he asked former Civil Guard 
Director Luis Roldan to investigate Mario Conde in 1992 when he 
headed the Spanish Credit Bank (Banesto), as reported by the 
daily EL MUNDO. 
  In a statement to the SER radio network, Serra said the 
report published by EL MUNDO is completely false, adding that 
the only knowledge he had about the alleged investigation is 
what he read today in that newspaper. 
  Serra, however, did not rule out the possibility that such 
an 
inquiry could have existed as implied in the newspaper, but he 
denied ordering the investigation, reiterating: "I did not order 
that or any other inquiry." 
  According to EL MUNDO, Serra asked Roldan to investigate 
Mario Conde's financial and personal activities in view of the 
banker's alleged intentions of participating in politics, citing 
Roldan himself, who is currently at large. 
  With regard to his possible appearance before the 
parliamentary commission probing Roldan's actions -- which four 
parliamentary groups viewed as unnecessary last week -- Serra 
said he is willing to appear if summoned. 
  Today, representatives from the Popular Party (PP, 
conservative), United Left (IU, pro-Communist), and the Mixed 
Group reiterated their request for Deputy Prime Minister Serra 
to appear before the commission to explain his relation with 
Conde's actions. They added that this is more necessary now in 
view of the report published by EL MUNDO. 
  In his statement to the radio, Serra stressed he is "the 
most 
interested in showing" that reports that he requested an 
investigation on Mario Conde "are false." 
  Serra noted that he would like Roldan to "make an appearance 
to say what he has to say. In this way, others would have the 
opportunity to completely refute all charges." 
  Roldan, who is under investigation for serious corruption 
charges, escaped early this month and, in an interview published 
by EL MUNDO, threatened to reveal political maneuvers and 
secrets about corruption in Spain if he does not receive 
favorable treatment from the government. 
  Conde was Banesto president until December 1993, when the 
Bank of Spain intervened in the institution because of its grave 
financial situation. He was removed from his post. 
Subsequently, Banesto's financial situation improved, and the 
Bank of Santander purchased most of its capital.

<F P=106> [Joint news conference by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and </F>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin with unidentified foreign and 
domestic correspondents in Bonn and short statement by German 
Economics Minister Guenther Rexrodt; Yeltsin speaks in Russian 
with superimposed German translation -- live; broadcast in 
progress] 
  [Text] [Kohl] ...Another key subject in our talks -- they 
will of course be continued tomorrow -- is the subject of 
security and stability in Europe. I have once again discussed 
with President Yeltsin the goals of the NATO partners as 
expressed at the NATO summit in January this year. We Germans 
are interested in Russia supporting and participating in the 
proposed NATO Partnership for Peace program. 
  We also discussed the most acute threat to European security 
and stability, namely the conflict in former Yugoslavia. We 
both agreed -- this also applies to the talks held on this 
matter by our two foreign ministers in particular -- that after 
the most recent escalation, a solution to the conflict in Bosnia 
is particularly urgent. Our two countries and the ministers 
responsible are playing an active part in the so-called contact 
group consisting of representatives of the United Nations, the 
European Union [EU], Russia, the United States, and France, 
Great Britain, and Germany. The goal of these joint efforts is 
to achieve a comprehensive cease-fire in Bosnia as soon as 
possible, and to work resolutely toward enabling the parties to 
the conflict to achieve a peace plan. 
  The day after tomorrow, a meeting will take place between 
the 
five foreign ministers from the contact group. I hope that this 
discussion too, will lead further in this direction. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, in bilateral terms German-Russian 
relations are free of the strains and problems we have 
unfortunately known so often in the past. We have discussed a 
number of matters of particular common interest. These covered, 
among other things, the establishment of a joint historical 
commission for research into recent German-Soviet, 
German-Russian history. Both President Yeltsin and myself are 
most interested in this, and will bring our influence to bear 
here to ensure that this commission begins its activities very 
soon -- and we have agreed that very soon means by the end of 
June. 
  We also discussed the repatriation of cultural artifacts 
removed during circumstances of war. You are aware of the legal 
basis for this enshrined in the German-Russian cultural 
agreement. We have received a report from the first session, 
which took place recently. One or two matters have still to be 
clarified. Again, both of us are very keen to see this work 
make very swift progress. We also agreed that the next meeting 
-- which I expect to produce quite concrete results -- will take 
place by mid-June, that is four weeks from now. Then, ladies 
and gentlemen, we talked about a subject that is currently 
coming in for a great deal of discussion -- here in Germany and 
also in Russia -- that is, the farewell ceremony for the Russian 
soldiers leaving Germany. President Yeltsin and I will jointly 
conduct this farewell ceremony on 31 August. I attach 
particular importance to the farewell for the Russian soldiers 
in Germany taking place in a worthy, respectful manner, and in a 
spirit of friendship. We have agreed that the whole event will 
take place in Berlin. In that context we agreed that we intend 
to see to the details personally, to do justice to the aims I 
explained before. 
  I would like to add a second matter, which resulted in 
misunderstandings that I in some respects found 
incomprehensible. I will now examine why. You are aware that 
in the original proposal, I presented the idea that we should 
meet in Weimar on that day. The underlying idea was and is that 
in addition to the farewell to the soldiers -- who were at the 
head of the military and martial part of our history -- we 
should express appreciation for the long, common cultural 
experience of our nations, and not least go to Weimar, where the 
cradle of modern democracy in Germany -- the adoption of the 
first democratic Reich constitution [Weimar Constitution of 11 
August 1919] -- took place. 
  Since this idea met with incomprehension, and since I would 
like to avoid further misunderstandings here, we both agreed 
today that at a later date -- but not postponed until an 
indefinite time -- at a foreseeable time, we will meet in Weimar 
and take the opportunity to invite men and women who have played 
a major part in the cultural life of our nations to a joint 
event, to bring to life and make clear for everyone the great 
common cultural traditions of our nations. 
  I pointed out again earlier in our talks that we share a 
lengthy common chapter in a great common culture, be it in 
philosophy, painting, or music, and not least literature and 
poetry and much else besides. It is our joint desire -- and I 
am very grateful to President Yeltsin that he thinks as I do -- 
it is our joint desire that this great, respectful tradition in 
the two countries will become evident here. 
  Of course, bilateral economic relations have also played a 
great role in this connection. I want to express my desire once 
again to German industry that we hope that as many German 
companies as possible will invest in Russia. President Yeltsin 
will take the opportunity to talk to major German business 
representatives about this subject during his visit to Stuttgart 
on Friday [13 May], above all about the conditions -- which are 
repeatedly discussed in Germany -- for foreign investors so that 
these conditions also improve in Russia. 
  We also discussed the relations that have evolved between 
eastern German enterprises and Russian partner enterprises. 
These contacts have been very much to our disadvantage [word 
indistinct] due to the problems of adapting over the last few 
years. This was discussed, also successfully -- my colleague 
[Economics Minister] Rexrodt will announce some details of this 
afterward in the discussion. 
  In a word, ladies and gentlemen, it is only the first stage 
of the visit, but this is an opportunity to open a new chapter 
in the history of our nations, continually improving 
German-Russian relations. Russia is, from the German point of 
view, our most important neighbor. In the ups and downs of 
history we have shared many experiences and did each other a 
great deal of harm. I think it is now very important not to 
forget history, to try and learn from it, both now and in the 
future -- the future means the 21st century in six years -- to 
set the right signals for the coming generations of our nations. 
Mr. President, may I ask you to take the floor? 
  [Yeltsin] Federal Chancellor, Ladies and Gentlemen: The 
first few hours of my stay on the hospitable soil of Germany 
have been very intense. I am pleased with the results of the 
talks that took place today with President Richard von 
Weizsaecker and with Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl. The talks 
with Herr Kohl were conducted in an open and friendly 
atmosphere, and this has already become a good tradition with 
him, and this reflects the special character that has marked the 
relations between our two states in recent years. The results 
of the talks have demonstrated the unity of our views and of 
German-Russian relations. With the federal chancellor, we 
agreed that in recent years we have come a long way toward each 
other. We have succeeded in overcoming the overwhelming 
majority of the problems that have burdened us since the war. 
  The agreements (?reached at our previous meetings) are 
working, and in particular after my official visit two years 
ago. Already 38 large joint projects are being realized. 
  Federal Chancellor Kohl and I discussed at length the 
conclusion in August this year of the stay of Russian troops in 
Germany. We agreed that the Russian troops should be sent off 
in a dignified fashion and to give this event a ceremonial 
character, in Berlin, and this farewell should be a symbol of 
the end of a certain stage of history and the entry of our two 
states and Europe as a whole into a new era of relations and a 
new era of reconciliation. Also, this will be a prologue to 
what will take place on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of 
the end of World War II. 
  At the same time Russia and Germany have declared themselves 
in favor of this anniversary being given a common impulse, and 
so we are proposing that in the political declaration that is 
planned for December 1994 for the meeting of the heads of state 
of the CSCE states in Budapest, some special statements should 
be adopted dedicated to the end of World War II 50 years ago. 
These sentences should reflect the principles of the world 
order and the relations with which the participating states of 
the CSCE approach the third millenium. 
  We also touched on the problems of human rights and 
democracy. Life has brought us in different ways to these 
objectives. Russia now also finds itself on the road to 
upholding democratization. This process cannot be described as 
painless. On this road various speeds can be (?adopted), 
various ways of progressing, and various methods of 
democratization appropriate to the state of society. 
  But there is no turning back, nor will there be. We are 
not giving up on progress, nor will we do so. This is 
demonstrated by the development of events following the 
Russians' vote for the new constitution and the parliamentary 
elections. The recent signing by Russia's leading political 
forces -- which number several hundred -- of a Treaty on Public 
Accord reiterated that the majority of Russians continue to 
support the implementation of peaceful transformations and 
political changes in society. 
  Economic cooperation between our two countries likewise 
featured prominently in our talks today. Germany remains 
Russia's largest trading partner. Given the problems currently 
facing Russia in the period of restructuring, it is virtually 
impossible to avoid certain shortcomings. There are temporary 
difficulties, but I am sure that we will be capable of 
surmounting these difficulties. We agreed to devote the 
greatest attention to such fields of cooperation as energy, 
conversion of the defense industry, mechanical engineering, and 
support for small and medium-sized businesses, especially on the 
operational side. We also proposed using such effective 
mechanisms for economic relations as interest-free commercial 
credit or the swing, to use its other name. Our discussions of 
economic problems and the problems of economic relations will 
continue tomorrow. 
  Our exchange of views on international issues was very 
intensive. The new nature of German-Soviet [as heard] relations 
and the atmosphere of trust that marks my present contacts with 
Chancellor Kohl dictate our countries' actions on international 
issues. Now that we have embarked on the path of democratic 
development, Russia wants to develop side by side with the whole 
democratic world. The maintenance of peace and security in the 
face of new global problems demands comprehensive development of 
the processes of integration. Russia does not view itself as 
standing aside from these processes, and this explains our 
desire to take part in all international involvements, in the 
G-7 industrial countries, and in cooperation in the NATO 
Partnership for Peace program, taking account of Russia's 
importance. 
  The federal chancellor reiterated Germany's previously 
expressed view that it is necessary for Russia to play a weighty 
part -- and he spoke about Russia joining the G-7 -- about 
cooperation between Russia and the EU, and about Russia's 
involvement from the outset in the new post-Cocom [Coordinating 
Committee for Multilateral Export Controls] export regime. I 
expressed our continued support for Germany at the United 
Nations. Russia regards Germany as a worthy candidate for 
permanent membership of the UN Security Council when such a 
decision is made. We agree that it is necessary to strengthen 
the NPT [nuclear nonproliferation treaty]: This treaty must be 
made unlimited in duration, and a situation must be created that 
will make it possible to conclude an agreement on a universal 
test ban throughout the whole world. 
  Finally, we also discussed in detail with Chancellor Kohl 
the 
question of the development of the situation in Bosnia and 
agreed that we will do everything to bring this war in Bosnia to 
an end, so that the settling of the problems of former 
Yugoslavia can be achieved. In this direction also, we must 
work more closely and on the basis of the resolutions of the 
United Nations and the CSCE. Thank you for your attention, and I 
am ready to answer your questions. 
  [German Economics Minister Rexrodt] Mr. President, ladies 
and 
gentlemen. My colleague Aleksandr Shokhin and I have held 
talks, among other things about the order for the DWA plane in 
Annendorf. As you know, without Russian orders this plant would 
not, for the foreseeable future, be used to full capacity. 
  After thorough preparation, in which retired State Secretary 
Koehler was involved, but also Mr. Shokhin and myself, we have 
today agreed that for 1994 the Russian side will place an order 
worth 500 million marks [DM] for passenger trains with 
Halle-Annendorf. We will again be making an exception and 
guaranteeing this order with special conditions. 
  For 1995 there will be other orders, but on a smaller scale, 
and the whole thing will be replaced -- and here German and 
Russian interests meet -- by comprehensive cooperation in the 
field of the manufacture of passenger trains. This means that 
the DWA, but quite possibly other firms as well, will work 
closely in Russia on the extension and the setting up of Russian 
passenger train construction plants. This close cooperation 
will incidentally extend to other economic fields, in particular 
in the area of high technology. 
  I am very pleased that with this we are able to give a very 
positive signal to the new laender -- for Saxony-Anhalt, for 
Halle, and for the passenger train makers in Halle-Annendorf. 
Thank you. 
  [Yeltsin] We have agreed on DM500 million for 1994, and the 
Russian Government will make a decision to this effect. Second, 
for 1995, the task has been assigned to draw up a separate 
agreement between the two sides and to lay down precisely the 
scope of this order. 
  [Interfax correspondent] Boris Nikolayevich, I would like to 
ask you the following question. After everything you have said 
here about your talks with the chancellor, to what extent has 
Europe come closer to a lasting and just peace? This question 
is above all asking about a just peace, since that is 
particularly important for Russia. 
  [Yeltsin] Of course, you understand very well that the 
securing of a comprehensive peace and comprehensive security in 
Europe does not depend on bilateral agreements alone. But the 
fact that two very important states are in agreement, one of 150 
million people, the other of 80 million -- Germany is the second 
largest country in Europe after Russia -- this suggests that we 
will also find it easier in relations with other states with 
regard to a unified security system in Europe. 
  [Correspondent] Chancellor Kohl, you have both already 
touched on the role and the goals of NATO. Did you also discuss 
the question of whether a special relationship with NATO could 
be found for Russia -- that is, a system of relations that could 
go beyond the Partnership for Peace? Thank you. 
  [Yeltsin] You are absolutely right. You have formulated the 
question very precisely. Of course, we cannot simply sign the 
document on Partnership for Peace -- which we basically agree 
with --and sign it without a special protocol with NATO. That 
means there will have to be a further document with NATO, in 
which a number of concrete questions on Russia's special 
features are laid down. Special features in the sense that, for 
example, an army of 3 million men is there, with the attendant 
technical equipment, and that, for example, there is equipment 
there that does not match NATO's unified standards. 
  There is a whole series of questions, but we are already 
starting this May to lay down work on this protocol together 
with NATO. After the protocol with NATO has been signed -- and 
I don't think there will be any major insoluble questions for 
NATO on this -- then we will also sign the document on the 
Partnership for Peace. 
  [Correspondent] Boris Nikolayevich, Mr. Chancellor, a 
question to you both: You have already addressed this to some 
extent -- Russia's cooperation with international organizations. 
I would like to ask more specifically about the G-7. Boris 
Nikolayevich and you, Mr. Chancellor, how do you assess the 
transformation of the G-7 into a G-8, and how do you regard the 
issue generally? 
  [Kohl] Clearly, in the time ahead -- I am not referring to 
the meeting in Naples in a few weeks but in the years to come -- 
a G-8 will come about [word indistinct]. This is not something 
I alone can determine; it is a matter for talks, and like the 
agreements in the G-7 sphere, it is a procedure whereby the 
party doing the inviting, that is, the host, must have a say, 
but of course with the relevant feedback. We will no doubt 
discuss the issue in connection with overall developments at our 
Naples meeting, but as I said -- I am repeating my first 
sentence -- developments are quite clearly heading in this 
direction, and from the German point of view this is desirable. 
  [Yeltsin] I would like to add a few words. This question is 
topical; it is no longer the same Russia as three, five, or 10 
years ago. Russia is taking a democratic path, Russia is going 
over to a market economy. Half of the companies in Russia are 
currently already private companies. It is a Russia that from 
1917 to 1989 did not even know what private ownership meant. 
Russia is a big country, a superpower. For that reason it has 
the moral right to take part in the tackling of international 
issues that are addressed by the politicians of the seven 
leading states, that is, Russia should become the eighth 
country. However, at the same time we understand that this 
issue cannot be settled at once in one step. We therefore 
discussed with Helmut Kohl that the first stage must be 
concluded, that we should participate in the preparatory 
drafting of the political issues and their discussion. The same 
applies to security issues, and that in a second stage after 
Naples we should also be involved in economic questions and that 
there should then be a G8 next year, but not yet now in Naples. 
  [Correspondent] President, Colonel General Burlakov 
[commander in chief of Russian forces in Germany] and the 
leadership of the Red Army has always insisted that there should 
be a joint farewell parade of the troops of all four allies from 
Germany. Your statement now and your agreement with Helmut Kohl 
-- how do you think this can be harmonized with feelings in the 
Red Army and the leadership of the Red Army? 
  [Yeltsin] Well, I don't think I quite understand. To start 
with, there is no Red Army any more, and the question is not 
very comprehensible either. There was a Red Army in 1917. 
  [Correspondent from Russian TV station NTV] Boris 
Nikolayevich, I would like to return to the question of the 
farewell ceremony for the Russian soldiers. You know very well 
that this question has met with a very sensitive reaction in 
Russia -- one could go so far as to use the word discontent. 
What can you say to us about this problem; what have you 
discussed with the chancellor in this respect? 
  [Yeltsin] I am very content that my friend Helmut Kohl has 
sensed the mood in our society and the mood of the president as 
well. One cannot of course do things in such a way that might 
destabilize the political situation in Russia. For this reason 
he very rapidly came forward with the proposal that we should 
perform all the ceremonies in Berlin but separately, without the 
Allies. 
  [Correspondent] One question for the chancellor, one 
question 
to President Yeltsin. Chancellor, the G-7 has until now been 
defined as an association of the strongest economic states of 
--to use an earlier term -- the free world, in other words the 
six Western states plus Japan. So how does the future role of 
Russia, which is certainly a large, powerful, respected country, 
fit in? [passage indistinct] 
  [Correspondent] A question to President Yeltsin. People in 
Germany have a lot of trust in you, but there are concerns in 
Germany about nationalist developments in Russia. What would 
you say to those citizens who are concerned about extremist 
nationalist tendencies in parts of Russia? 
  [Yeltsin] Please understand that there have been 
conflagrations in many countries of the CIS, that wars are in 
progress there, and, among other things, these are 
nationalist-based wars. One nation is fighting another, one 
region is fighting another. In Russia alone, in which there are 
21 national republics, 88 components of the federation, no blood 
has yet been shed for those reasons. 
  Yes, it is true that some extremists are shouting -- it is 
not much different in your own country. But we have no fear of 
Zhirinovskiy. No, no, we don't fear him. No, he has no power 
base and he won't have any in the future either, since Russia, 
which went through the 1941-1945 war, knows what nationalism 
means. 
  [Correspondent from Russian TV] Boris Nikolayevich, could 
you 
explain to us the essence of Russian policy on the ethnic German 
Russians? 
  [Yeltsin] As we had agreed, there is a commission that 
started its work two years ago. As you know, there are already 
national districts. We naturally do not by any means want to 
lose the Germans in our regions. We do not want them all to 
emigrate, not by any means. We want them to live in our country 
-- that they work in our country so they can live well in our 
country -- and our work is channelled in that direction. This 
work is being done at the moment. 
  [Correspondent] Boris Nikolayevich, here there is a lot of 
polemicizing about the repatriation of works of art that came to 
Russia during World War II. What is the Russian president's 
opinion on this? 
  [Yeltsin] What would you think if an officer here stole 
books 
in a library and took them with him to Russia? How should we 
actually judge that? What should we think of it? That is to 
say, this question is extremely complicated, and cannot be 
resolved at one go. We cannot say it must be resolved in the 
course of repatriation and that the Germans have also taken 
things from Russia, and various objects have gone here and 
there. In any case, we cannot work out where more artifacts 
have ended up, and so we have set up a joint commission to work 
on this, involving the Russian minister for cultural affairs, 
and the minister from Germany. They have been working, but they 
have been working poorly and slowly. What is that, one meeting 
a year? But they have of course already resolved some of the 
questions. They have decided that there are many of our 
cultural artifacts here that will have to be given back; there 
is the Gotha library, which will have to be returned. That is 
the situation. But today we decided with the chancellor that 
the work of this commission will have to be speeded up--that is 
the first thing. The next point is that the second meeting will 
have to take place by 15 June. Third, by the end of this year, 
Helmut Kohl and I will agree on and sign a schedule for the 
further meetings of this commission. But we will clearly not 
intervene in what the experts, the professionals, have to do. 
We will naturally bow to the decisions made by the commission, 
the professionals. 
  [Voice, in Russian] That is enough -- the last question. 
  [Correspondent] How do you see Russia's prospects for 
accession? In the EU there is some movement on this question. 
How do you see it? 
  [Kohl] I do not think this question is topical in the sense 
of the agenda. You know that we in the EU have just undergone a 
very difficult process in the parliament last week and agreed on 
an EU enlargement involving Austria, Sweden, Finland, and 
Norway. These countries now have to pursue this path in their 
own referenda. The definition of the EU with regard to Central, 
East, and southeastern Europe is still entirely unresolved. I 
am firmly of the opinion that we should now do what is most 
important with respect to the EU and Russia. That is, we should 
actively address the questions of association, of working 
together, particularly in the economic sphere. A number of 
questions still have to be solved, but I very much hope that it 
will be possible to sign the texts now available in the very 
foreseeable future. Everything else is a development in the 
distant future. That involves two kinds of decision -- those who 
wish it, and the others who [word indistinct]. I regard it as 
entirely out of the question for us to make a statement at this 
time. 
  [Yeltsin] My position on this: Federal Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl has assured me that when Germany holds the EU presidency it 
will very emphatically support the conclusion of the agreement 
between Russia and the EU so that this takes place within a 
month if possible. That means that everything must be agreed 
upon, the quotas, the cargoes, the goods, the market, and so on. 
There are hundreds of issues. We still have to overcome this 
final stage and then everything will develop in this way. We 
must not, of course, forget that Russia is a European country 
even though we are also in Asia. But one has to consider then 
that Russia should belong to the Council of Europe.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Rudolf Scharping, the SPD [Social 
Democratic Party] leader and candidate for the chancellorship, 
has described the dispute, now resolved, over the farewell 
ceremony for the Russian troops as "incomprehensible and 
harmful." Following a talk with Yeltsin in Bonn today, 
Scharping said the German Government bears sole responsibility 
for the unncessary irritations which have arisen. The SPD has 
from the beginning insisted on a "worthy" farewell for the 
troops in Berlin. The talk at the Petersberg near Bonn was also 
attended by North-Rhine Westphalia Premier Johannes Rau (SPD), 
and SPD Bundestag group leader Hans- Ulrich Klose. 
  Scharping accepted an invitation from Yeltsin to visit 
Russia. An appropriate date for the visit still has to be 
discussed. 
  Scharping said that in his talk with Yeltsin he referred to 
the special importance of the "good" German-Russian relations. 
It is important for other Western states to become as strongly 
involved in Russia as the Federal Republic to lend support to 
Yeltsin's policy of political and economic reform. The SPD 
leader described economic relations between the two countries as 
"capable of being developed." He cited as examples the 
scientific, research, and technology spheres. Yeltsin stressed 
that his country wants to be a partner with equal rights in 
international organizations. 
  Yeltsin will also meet this morning with Theo Waigel, CSU 
[Christian Social Union] chairman and federal finance minister. 
Afterward, Yeltsin and Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl will set 
off on a tour of the Palatinate district. The two politciains 
are to visit Speyer Cathedral this afternoon. Yeltsin has also 
been invited to Kohl's home in Ludwigshafen-Oggersheim. 
  Yeltsin will go to Baden-Wuerttemberg tomorrow, the third 
and 
final day of his visit to Germany.

  [Text] Budapest (DDP/ADN) -- Germany has promised Hungary 
support on its path toward NATO. Now that the Partnership for 
Peace initiative has shown the way, the individual problems must 
be tackled. This was stated at a news conference today in 
Budapest by Bundestag Defense Committee Chairman Fritz Wittmann. 
The main issues are compatibility, communication, education, 
and leadership. 
  Wittmann stressed that of all the eastern bloc states, 
Hungary is the closest to Germany. He did not rule out joint 
German-Hungarian military exercises. However, language problems 
would certainly arise, as shown by the example of the 
Franco-German brigade. 
  The military preparedness of the Hungarian Armed Forces is 
at 
a very high level, the politician continued. This shows that 
they have survived the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and the 
process of adaptation very well. This is important insofar as 
Hungary plays a special role in the region, geographically and 
politically. 
  Hungary's Defense Minister Lajos Fur expressed gratitude for 
the gratis supply of materiel from stocks of the former GDR 
National People's Army. This help has strengthened the 
excellent relations between the two states.

<F P=106> [Interview with North Rhine-Westphalian Minister President </F>
Johannes Rau, SPD candidate for the office of federal president, 
by Dieter Buhl and Robert Leicht; place and date not given: "`I 
Want To Be a Good Patriot"] 
  [Text] [DIE ZEIT] Mr. Rau, many years ago you talked about 
conducting an election campaign under the slogan "reconciliation 
instead of division." In the meantime, Germany has been 
reunified, but internally it is more divided than before. How 
can this divide between east and west be overcome? 
  [Rau] The situation is the same as it was in 1949 when we 
placed material reconstruction ahead of dealing with the past: 
We are now in danger of viewing unification as nothing more 
than the rebuilding of the eastern laender by way of introducing 
free market economics while too little is being done to enable 
us to understand one another. People have to talk to each 
other. We have an obligation to tell each other about our 
different lives. We also need to forge a whole series of 
relations. 
  [DIE ZEIT] For example? 
  [Rau] One can rebuild the Church of Our Lady in Dresden and 
one can visit the concentration camp at Oranienburg, places that 
lead us back to our common history in both its good and its bad 
aspects. 
  [DIE ZEIT] You have recently been criticized as someone who 
personally rejected unification. Following the collapse of the 
Wall, the government of your land, in which Bonn is situated, 
was opposed to the move to Berlin. Are or were the 
conservatives the better patriots? 
  [Rau] I never rejected reunification. It was always -- even 
if I considered the word inappropriate, because of the first 
syllable, which sounded too mechanical and smacked of 
restoration -- my political goal. Incidentally, I first became 
involved in politics through the issue of unity -- with the 
foundation of the All-German People's Party in 1952. However, 
like all other politicians, I did not envisage such a 
development in the foreseeable future. However, that is also 
true of the chancellor, the foreign minister, and almost 
everybody else. 
  As far as Berlin is concerned, in 1991 I expressed support 
for the parliament and government remaining in Bonn, but before 
the decision was made, I said that whatever decision is adopted, 
it should be loyally implemented. I have maintained that. The 
first section of the motion that I backed in the Bundestag on 20 
June 1991 stated: "The seat of federal president is in Berlin." 
I do indeed believe that the role of federal president can best 
be performed in Berlin. 
  [DIE ZEIT] The Stasi files are a source of discord in the 
country. Is it not time that they were closed and the matter 
put aside? 
  [Rau] Sometimes, one wants to say what the chancellor said 
spontaneously: Close the files. However, I can see that such 
an approach will not work. It will not work because of the 
victims, who have a right to see that the people who committed 
crimes against them are punished. I sometimes become concerned 
only about the way in which we Germans go about all of this. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Germans are wealthy, but they are not 
necessarily economically successful anymore. What must happen 
for the economy and society to once again achieve an external 
and internal balance? 
  [Rau] Many people are rich, but poverty is growing. I 
think that the current discussion about Germany as a center for 
business does not go far enough. The issues that are being 
argued are cost factors and the duration of permit procedures. 
That is not enough. I believe that we must concentrate more on 
technological advancement as well as new products rather than 
the export of established goods. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Technological renewal -- does that not encounter 
great obstacles in Germany with respect to genetic engineering 
or other future-oriented technologies? 
  [Rau] Our postwar history has been marked by a pendulum-like 
movement between euphoria over technology and fear of 
technology. This cannot be rectified by speeding up the 
movements of the pendulum, only by seeking a balance. That 
means that one must increase the opportunities for research in 
the case of genetic engineering and other appropriate scientific 
disciplines. However, one must also set limits. In my opinion, 
interference with human embryos should not be permitted. As far 
as I am concerned, there are no relative boundaries, only 
absolute ones. 
  [DIE ZEIT] In difficult times for the economy, how can one 
achieve both, higher performance -- in the context of 
international competition, too -- and greater solidarity? Is 
our society not too egoistical? 
  [Rau] The past few decades have witnessed a process of 
individualization that also contains elements undermining a 
feeling of solidarity. There is a form of personal development 
that is so absolute that it rules out any form of reference to 
solidarity or love of one's fellow man. The dangerous thing is 
always to demand solidarity from those who need it and not from 
those who must be ready to display such feelings. I do not like 
the kind of discussion in which the factory director says: "We 
must tighten our belts," which means lower wages, but for those 
who receive their wages from the factory director and not for 
factory directors themselves. By saying that, I do not want to 
conduct any kind of outmoded class war, but I do believe that 
this has something to do with the example set by those who are 
models and create models in this society. 
  [DIE ZEIT] The "political class" has fallen into disrepute. 
The current president, Richard von Weizsaecker, has given the 
parties a piece of his mind. What must change for you not to 
find yourself scolding the parties one of these days? 
  [Rau] There are many things about the president's diagnoses 
that I consider correct, and it also somewhat hurt me that I had 
to contradict him. I could understand part of the criticism but 
it was also polemical, and I also believed that what we needed 
was more encouragement for politics rather than polemics 
directed against parties. 
  We are witnessing a development that sees fewer people 
becoming involved in politics, because they are concerned that 
they will be placed on the same level as bad examples and will 
only be considered to be people who can do nothing other than 
destroy their political opponents. The result is that politics 
severely lacks an up and coming generation. 
  [DIE ZEIT] What can parties themselves do to become more 
responsive to those who are committed to issues and to problems? 
  [Rau] The parties still do not have an adequate answer. The 
commitment that is there is bypassing the parties, the 
churches.... 
  [DIE ZEIT] ...and the unions.... 
  [Rau] ...and the unions. That is why I believe that we are 
dealing with an institutional crisis for which I have no simple 
solution, but which, I think, must be overcome. I still say 
that we have a wonderful house, a fine brick building, but the 
mortar is beginning to crumble. The institutions no longer keep 
people together. However, we cannot change people so that they 
fit into our organizations, we must change our organizations so 
that people want to join. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Germany's position has changed since 
reunification. Should the FRG be a normal country that presents 
itself in the way that its neighbors in the EU and United 
Nations expect or should the Germans choose a special course, 
because they have better morals and a better understanding of 
history? 
  [Rau] I do not think that the Germans should pursue a 
special course and I do not think that it would be right for the 
Germans to do so. However, it seems to me to be right and 
important that the Germans be particularly conscious of their 
history and draw lessons from it. We Germans must make it 
perfectly clear that what we want is a European Germany, not a 
German Europe. We do not want our feeling of national identity 
to be a product for export! We need to be a part of Europe, 
because if such a large country in the center of Europe is not, 
it will be viewed as a threat by others and might indeed turn 
out that way -- I would consider that to be a disaster. As far 
as Germany's history this century is concerned, I believe in 
what Gustav Heinemann said: "There is only a chance of others 
forgetting what happened because of Germany, if we do not forget 
what happened." 
  [DIE ZEIT] What does that mean in the context of the 
anniversaries that will be celebrated this year and next year -- 
in Normandy, the end of the war. How should we approach those 
dates? 
  [Rau] Before that, we have a key date that concerns only us 
and I believe that it will be a moving day. I mean the 20th of 
July, the 50th anniversary of the Stauffenberg's attempt on 
Hitler's life. I think that it would be a good thing if this 
anniversary were not only an occasion for discussing the men and 
women of 20 July, but also for discussing the history of 
resistance in general. 
  We have our own dates. For example, 8 May of next year, 50 
years since the end of the war: It must be clear to us that it 
is the day of liberation and a day of defeat for Germany, that 
it was not a catastrophe the befell us from without, but was the 
consequence of a disaster that we ourselves set in motion. 
  [DIE ZEIT] What conclusions are to be drawn from German 
history? Should we keep out of every conflict? Or should we, 
because of historical experience, be particularly active in 
international politics and shoulder responsibility? 
  [Rau] Undoubtedly the latter. I would only say that the 
question of whether "particularly active" is only "responsible" 
when German soldiers are involved has been put to me too 
quickly. I do not think that one should think of soldiers as 
soon as one thinks of international assistance, especially as 
one knows that most military conflicts have social or ecological 
causes. I think that the idea of a European peace corps that is 
available for peaceful missions should be revived. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Would that have helped in the case of Yugoslavia? 
The SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] approached the 
Constitution Court in Karlsruhe in connection with several 
specific questions, but before the deliberations in Karlsruhe, 
it had approved military operations in former Yugoslavia in the 
Bundestag. How can those two things be reconciled? 
  [Rau] The approach to Karlsruhe was about clarification of 
our constitution and not that we were of the opinion that 
Karlsruhe could or had to prohibit or facilitate certain steps. 
We went to Karlsruhe because we considered the chancellor's 
statement that such missions were not possible unless the 
constitution was amended to be correct. We really wanted to 
know that and when the constitution has been amended, we want to 
make political decisions on a case by case basis. 
  [DIE ZEIT] If the Bundeswehr becomes more intensively 
involved abroad in UN missions, there will be casualties. Can 
you envision missions for which German soldiers should die? 
  [Rau] I cannot view the matter so casually, because without 
blood being shed by Americans, Englishmen, and Frenchmen as well 
as Russians in our case, there would have been no liberation 
from national socialism. Despite my previous reservations about 
the rearmament of Germany, that is why I said yes to national 
defense, as we expressed it in Bad Godesberg in 1959. However, 
I want to exhaust all ways and means involved in national 
defense unless the international community sees no other option 
and demands that we make a contribution to peacekeeping. What I 
do not want is for us to become a kind of rapid deployment force 
that is dispatched wherever there is a crisis. 
  [DIE ZEIT] For decades, a feature of the discussion about 
policy on Europe in this country has been harmony, but now it is 
the subject of disagreement. How can one continue to advocate 
European integration and more involvement in Europe? 
  [Rau] There can be no internal calm in Europe if a people 
that is 80-million-strong, living in the center of Europe and 
surrounded by neighbors, is not integrated in the process of 
European unification. 
  I can understand why many people view the community as 
strongly oriented toward agriculture, as being a subsidy 
machine. I can understand that German steelworkers are 
skeptical about Europe, because the policy on steel is wrong. I 
can also understand that many are opposed to excessive 
bureaucracy and excessive regulations, because there is no 
adequate democratic control system to counterbalance that, that 
more and more guidelines are initiated, approved by national 
governments, guidelines that cannot be overseen. In that 
respect, I agree with Stoiber's criticism, but I do not want to 
have anything at all to do with the basis for his criticism. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Is it true that Helmut Kohl is the last German 
statesman who is firmly committed to Germany's integration with 
Europe? 
  [Rau] I was just about to say that if I were president, 
there would be two of us, at least two of us. 
  [DIE ZEIT] The republic has to deal with right-wing 
extremism, not for the first time, but it has never had to do so 
intensively before. There are the right-wing terrorists and 
right-wing parties. What should be done? Should the 
Republikaner be kept under surveillance or should the party be 
banned? 
  [Rau] I believe that the Weimar Republic did not collapse 
because there were too many extremists, but because there were 
too few democrats. That is why I am in favor of a political 
debate, which must, of course, take into account its effects. I 
am not in favor of holding a discussion with Schoenhuber on 
television, and I think it is wrong for us to be taken in by 
provocations staged for the media. 
  We have conducted research in those areas where the 
Republikaner have obtained a high number of votes and we have 
come to the conclusion that the areas are consistently trouble 
spots, always towns and neighborhoods where the prospects for 
young people are particularly bad because there are few 
occupational training positions, few jobs, few meeting places. 
We must pay more attention to the reasons people are drawn to 
extremism and try to remove the causes. 
  [DIE ZEIT] So, that means that right-wing voters are not so 
much the result of Mr. Schoenhuber's activities as society's 
indifference. 
  [Rau] That is correct. That is true of a great many voters. 
Everywhere there are people who cannot be taught anything. 
There are such people in France, in Italy, and in Germany. 
However, we as Germans know best -- or we should know best of 
all -- what the result of such views being held by a majority of 
people can be. That is also why we have to react in a 
particularly sensitive manner. We do not have more extremism 
than in other countries, but we need to have a higher threshold, 
because once bitten twice shy. 
  [DIE ZEIT] If that is the case, then why are we ready to 
introduce new national, partly nationalist sentiments into 
politics? 
  [Rau] There is no place for nationalist sentiments. 
However, I concede that -- in view of the rupture in our 
history -- I consider a natural relationship to one's country 
to be necessary, we should not leave that to the extremists. 
What I say is that a patriot is someone who loves his 
fatherland, whereas a nationalist is someone who despises other 
peoples' fatherlands. I want to be a good patriot. 
  [DIE ZEIT] What can a president do in this situation in this 
difficult fatherland -- to quote your political mentor Gustav 
Heinemann? Has Richard von Weizsaecker's presidency not shown 
that regardless of how much of an effort he makes, the president 
cannot influence the course of politics, but can only accompany 
it symbolically? 
  [Rau] I think that Richard von Weizsacker has accomplished 
much more than that. The speech that he delivered on 8 May 1985 
in itself justified the 10 years in office. It was the kind of 
speech heard once in a century. One can hardly overestimate the 
effect that the speech had all over the world in clearly showing 
Germany to be a democracy. 
  At least half of a president's role is connected with 
foreign 
policy. He is to a certain extent the first ambassador, and 
that applies not only to travel, with which I would be sparing. 
However, I believe that the way in which one visits foreign 
countries and the experience that one introduces into political 
talks can be more than a symbolic "accompaniment." 
  [DIE ZEIT] Can the president be someone who makes people 
think about their lives? 
  [Rau] No, he cannot and should not act that way, not even as 
a constitutional organ. However, in the way in which he poses 
questions and the way in which he brings people together, he can 
be -- to point to areas where meaning is lacking in life and 
make people think that way. 
  I believe that it is desirable for the president to have a 
clear-cut image, but it should always be an invitation to others 
to show where they stand. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Which country would you visit first if, as 
president, you were free to decide that? 
  [Rau] I would be drawn to Israel, but perhaps I would go to 
the Netherlands, to our neighbor, which has problems with us. 
Then, of course, talks with our neighbors in the east would be 
important for me. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Every president has sought a role for himself, 
and the question that arises every time is how political can a 
head of state be? How would you answer that question in 
relation to yourself? Is it not the case that a politician 
sometimes has to cause divisions or a polarization to set things 
in motion? 
  [Rau] He must also be able to focus on minority positions, 
knowing that they are minority positions: If he thinks it is 
useful to make them majority positions, then he can seek support 
for them. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Mr. Rau, it now seems unlikely that you could be 
elected with the votes of the SPD alone. How do you want to win 
votes from the liberals and the Greens? 
  [Rau] My candidacy is an offer addressed to all democratic 
parties. I know from many talks I have had that there is a lot 
of support for my candidacy in other democratic parties. I hope 
that it will be translated into votes.

<F P=106> [Article by Jutta Falke: "Lead among Nonvoters--Internal </F>
Strategy Papers: How the Social Democrats Intend to Win Points 
Against Gysi's Party in the Bundestag Election Campaign"] 
  [Text] At the dinner table in Bonn's parliamentary society 
Wolfgang Thierse was telling tales out of school. He would not 
have a face-to-face debate with his opposite number, PDS [Party 
of Democratic Socialism] candidate Stefan Heym, in September, he 
said. Was he throwing in the towel? Polling results appear to 
indicate that more than 50 percent of the voters in the 
Berlin-Mitte district plan to vote for Heym, the PDS' direct 
candidate. 
  The respectable showing by the SED [Socialist Unity Party] 
successor party in the Brandenburg local elections has the SPD 
[Social Democratic Party of Germany] worried--and not just the 
SPD. After those elections [Guenter] Verheugen, the SPD national 
executive director, was quick to say that there will be no 
cooperation with the PDS. But what good does that do? However 
honorable such statements might be they do not necessarily help 
obtain the votes of potential PDS supporters. 
  That suits Gysi's party fine; it continues to move ahead. At 
least that is what the polls say. According to Infratest Burke 
Berlin, 55 percent of the eastern Germans polled would like to 
see the PDS represented in the Bundestag again; 24 percent said 
they might vote for the PDS in the next Bundestag election. And 
according to Infas, 62 percent of the eastern Germans consider 
the PDS to be a party "committed to social issues." 
  In that regard it competes with the SPD, of course. Under 
the 
circumstances, SPD headquarters would just as soon leave well 
enough alone. The debate has not yet come to a close, it is 
said. A plan on how to deal with the issue only exists in 
"Guenter Verheugen's head." 
  That is not entirely correct because a lot of thought is 
already being given to the matter behind the scenes. These 
deliberations include a reexamination of the SPD's own role--and 
how it is perceived among the voters. It was not until 1990 that 
the newly founded eastern German SPD which initially went by the 
name of SDP decided not to accept former members of the SED. 
That decision held for a year to start with. These days, the 
local party organizations decide on a case-by-case basis, but 
they are very restrictive. 
  Are they too restrictive? At this point party headquarters 
no 
longer want the SPD in eastern Germany to act as a new party 
unhampered by the SED past, but as an activist political force 
involved in current issues. Wolfgang Thierse, it is said, is 
inclined to adopt such a position. Given the unclear majority 
situation, who can afford to drive potential voters into the 
arms of the PDS by asking them: "what did you do the day before 
yesterday?" 
  Certainly not the SPD. The membership figures alone send a 
loud and clear message. The SPD has 30,000 members in eastern 
Germany while the PDS has about 130,000. The only recourse is to 
go on the offensive. On orders from the party executive 
committee Rudolf Hartung, the executive director of the Berlin 
SPD and a former functionary at party headquarters, worked up a 
set of theses. 
  The revised version of the "33 Theses for Self-Confident 
Dealings with the PDS" will be completed within the next few 
days. It will then be presented to the executive committee. A 
shorter version will subsequently be published. 
  The document calls for focusing more on SPD successes in 
national politics. It contains quotations from statements by 
Gysi and analyses of the PDS membership structure and comments 
such as "everyday political life in the PDS is joyless and has 
little to do with Gregor Gysi talk shows." The document also 
includes optimistic, albeit helpless statements such as: "among 
nonvoters there is a distinctly greater potential for confidence 
in the SPD than in the PDS." Or: "about 20 percent of the PDS 
voters admit that the SPD is more effective and can be more 
successful on major social policy issues than the PDS which is 
by and large a regional political party limited to the former 
GDR." 
  Hartung is not the only one to prepare such a strategy paper 
on the PDS issue. Uwe Kuester and Rolf Schwanitz, two deputies 
from eastern Germany, have also drawn up an analysis. Kuester, 
the SPD parliamentary group's executive director, would not like 
to see an "election campaign that focuses on party platforms," 
nor does he want the SPD to concentrate on the SED past. "In the 
final analysis," he says, "one cannot exclude 2.3 million former 
SED members for life." His study goes into the PDS membership 
structure and election strategy as well as into the consequences 
for the SPD election campaign. "It would be counterproductive to 
stigmatize the PDS members as individuals who are forever 
looking backward," Kuester writes. As an example he cites PDS 
politician Kutzmutz in Potsdam who met with a lot of 
understanding when he noted that "my biography does not start in 
1989." The market economy is another issue to be raised, he 
recommends. The PDS which casts doubt on it in its platform is 
"totally unrealistic and ideologically overburdened" on that 
score. 
  In his view, the PDS is trying to blame the SPD along with 
the government for the negative consequences of Bonn's 
decisions. This attempt must be countered. The election campaign 
should therefore be based on SPD achievements, including those 
in the Bundesrat. In essence, Kuester's paper says, "by 
attacking the CDU [Christian Democratic Union], our principal 
adversary, in this manner we will simultaneously be dealing in 
the most elegant way with the PDS, our principal competitor." 
  In his paper entitled "The PDS--Antidemocratic, Divisive, 
Separatist" Rolf Schwanitz, who made a name for himself in the 
SPD as head of the working group on German unity, places 
particular emphasis on the PDS's past and its programmatic 
goals. He feels nonetheless that "attitudes toward the GDR past 
have changed, particularly among those who sympathize with the 
PDS." Schwanitz would not only like to confront the PDS with 
"soft issues" in the election campaign but rather to "expose its 
core." The PDS is merely interested in "focusing on problems and 
not on their solutions," he says. "The PDS primarily represents 
the interests of the former nomenklatura." 
  In his paper Schwanitz analyzes the role played by the PDS 
in 
reports prepared by the Office for the Protection of the 
Constitution, examines its draft statutes and its dealings with 
SED assets. "In united Germany," he writes, "the PDS tries to 
secure freedoms for left-wing extremist forces and agitates 
against a well-fortified democratic system of government." 
Schwanitz then turns against "a response adapted to the public 
mood in which the issues already preempted by the PDS, e.g. 
Stasi activity, its role in the past and present, are respected 
and ignored." 
  Can the PDS "campaign of conquest" still be stopped? If it 
did return to the Bundestag, it could thwart some options and 
force others to be adopted. "The consequence could be a grand 
coalition," Hartung speculates. Do others share this fear? At 
any rate, CDU headquarters is also busy working on strategies 
directed against the PDS. Campaign materials directed against 
the Gysi party are to be distributed following the summer recess.

<F P=106> [Article by Thomas Hanke: "Between Hope and Anxiety"] </F>
  [Text] Is Rudolf Scharping, Social Democratic Party of 
Germany (SPD) candidate for chancellor, secretly dreaming of an 
election victory in the style of Bill Clinton? Citizens, 
battered by crisis and disappointed, turn their backs on the 
incumbent whom they no longer credit with any competency at all 
in economic matters and bet on the younger challenger--and he 
not only inherits the office, but also an economic upturn that 
no one had clearly seen coming prior to the election. 
  Possibly nothing will come of it. Granted, according to the 
polls, the German citizenry still credits the Social Democrat 
with greater ability to solve economic and social problems, but 
since the majority of economic research institutes now expect a 
definite revival of the economy, the mood could certainly 
change. The end of the recession confronts the Social Democrats 
with a political problem: If they point out the risks that still 
exist, they will be accused of aborting the recovery with their 
pessimistic talk; if they go over to the optimists' camp, they 
will be campaigning for Helmut Kohl. 
  The Federal Government, on the other hand, is no longer 
racking its brains: It is proceeding full steam ahead with 
optimism. Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Minister for Economics 
Guenter Rexrodt are already cheerfully talking about the 
recovery. It does not bother them that both the research 
institutes and their own experts in the ministries are prudently 
avoiding this notion. Weak economic growth of 1 percent in 
western Germany--which is what the institutes are 
expecting--makes up for just one-half of the economic slump that 
the old federal laender suffered last year, and an upturn that 
produces new capacity and jobs is not in sight this year. 
  Nonetheless, even Minister of Finance Theo Waigel was trying 
to spread nothing but sunshine at the spring meeting of the IMF 
and the World Bank in Washington. The IMF's prognosis--0.9 
percent growth in Germany--was supposedly too pessimistic. 
Waigel's optimism, motivated by the election campaign, certainly 
did not catch on with the Americans. U.S. Secretary of the 
Treasury Lloyd Bentsen sees only a gradual recovery in the most 
important industrial countries that, moreover, is still very 
uncertain in some regions. Bentsen is convinced that more must 
be done to ensure a long-term recovery. His undersecretary [for 
international affairs], Larry Summers, is calling upon the 
Germans as well as the Japanese to do more for the recovery: The 
economy should be stimulated by interest rate reductions. And 
the IMF grouses that German banks are not passing declining 
interest rates on to their customers. 
  Not only abroad, but in this country as well there are 
admonitions to prudence in evaluating the economic situation. In 
that vein, Herbert Hax, chairman of the Council of Experts, 
opines: "Granted, predicting a certain upward trend for the 
German economy in the last half of the year is justified; how 
strong it will be, however, is still completely up in the air." 
Hax reminds that thus far, only foreign orders and popular mood 
indicators have improved: "Data for the first quarter of 1994 
still do not reveal an increase in production--something that no 
one expected." 
  The coalition parties, however, are not being held back by 
realism. Count Otto Lambsdorff, Free Democratic Party (FDP) 
economic policy specialist, is damaging his own credibility with 
the comment, "the recovery in Germany is picking up tempo." His 
Christian Democratic Union (CDU) colleague Rainer Haungs is 
already talking about "the leading role of the German economy." 
It does not bother the coalition members that they are becoming 
entangled in their own glaring contradictions: Just a few weeks 
ago, Germany as a place for business and industry was allegedly 
threatening to plunge into third-rate status; if economic 
shortcomings were not piling up, then first-rate structural 
problems were: the cost crisis, the innovation crisis, and the 
employment crisis. But that is all old hat now. 
  In its euphoria, the Federal Government runs the risk of 
talking at cross-purposes with the citizenry, for this much is 
certain: Workers will be perceptibly worse off this year. If the 
citizens make judgments based on their wallets, Kohl will 
continue to be in a difficult position: Because of modest wage 
settlements and tax increases, disposable income has shrunk a 
total of 1.5 percent--and total income has even declined by 3 
percent. "That is the steepest decline in the history of the 
Federal Republic," emphasizes Heiner Flassbeck of the German 
Institute for Economic Research. 
  The six institutes disagree only as to whether private 
consumption will decline by 0.5 or 1.5 percent as a consequence 
of this slump. Nor will there be any substantial improvement in 
the coming year: The institutes expect that private consumption 
will probably only stabilize in the foreseeable future. To be 
sure, the research economists are counting on growth of more 
than 9 percent in incomes from business activity, yet whether 
that is a cause for celebration on the part of the broad mass of 
voters may be doubtful indeed, for the rising profits are having 
no effect on the most serious problem: unemployment. It 
continues to increase this year and, according to the 
institutes, a turnaround in the trend will not occur until 1995. 
On this score, they are more optimistic than the president of 
the Federal Association of German Industry, Tyll Necker: He is 
not expecting growth in jobs before 1996 at the earliest; next 
year the slide will only be halted. What the entrepreneurs, 
labor unions, and economists have been preaching for months 
remains true: Unemployment will not go away by itself. After the 
brutal down-sizing and efficiency cure that industry has been 
undergoing, production can be increased with a reduced labor 
force. 
  The Federal Republic, like the European countries as whole, 
cannot survive in the long run solely on the life support 
provided by American demand. They themselves must provide for a 
more stable domestic economic situation. More robust domestic 
demand as well as markedly fewer jobless will not occur 
automatically, however, and it would therefore be disastrous if 
the economic policymakers were to lie back now and celebrate 
their putative successes. Klaus-Werner Schatz of the Kiel 
Institute for Global Economy warns: "Our biggest worry is: How 
can we again achieve a higher rate of employment? To do so, the 
tax burden must be reduced, but fiscal policy is not yet 
undertaking the efforts that are necessary for us to achieve a 
strong upturn with growth in employment." 
  While the institutes are calling for tax reductions, the 
Federal Government is doing the opposite: The solidarity surtax 
[to assist in financing the reconstruction of eastern Germany] 
will once again be increased at the beginning of next year and 
capital and insurance taxes will be raised. Moreover, there will 
be another increase in oil taxes or other taxes to finance the 
reform of the railroad system. Even an increase in the 
value-added tax cannot be excluded any longer since the Federal 
Government is negotiating with local governments on granting 
permission to the latter to share in this revenue 
source--something that, should it come about, will hardly be 
feasible without an increased tax rate. 
  Thus, the Federal Government talks about the necessity for 
the tax burden to be reduced again but does the exact opposite. 
In so doing, it not only mortgages the national economy, it also 
does nothing short of forcing the labor unions to adopt a more 
aggressive wage policy that would threaten the unit labor cost 
reductions that have just been achieved. In violation of all its 
promises, the government is staking everything on further tax 
increases because it is plagued by debt. In spite of constantly 
increased taxes, the debt burden continues to grow and early 
next year the 2-trillion-mark level--equating to 60 percent of 
the GNP--will be surpassed. Driven by the avalanche of debt in 
fiscal policy matters, the Federal Government's economic policy 
is currently exhausting itself in a battle over the repeal of 
the Rebate Act. 
  Nonetheless, the struggle for power is becoming more 
difficult for Scharping: If Kohl can point to an economic bright 
spot on the horizon, it would be frivolous to continue to hew to 
the same line that holds that the chancellor will do himself in. 
Scharping can no longer restrict himself to the message that he 
agrees with the Federal Government on many fundamental 
issues--it is just that his policy would be somewhat better in 
the area of social welfare. Should he, in fact, have better 
prescriptions for freeing the German economy from its state of 
paralysis between recession and recovery, he must explain them 
now as quickly as possible. Remaining silent and trusting that 
the Federal Government will make itself an unacceptable choice, 
is likely to be the surest way to put himself out of the race.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Volker Wolff: "Grand Coalition"] </F>
  [Text] Right on, Germany! The governing parties' pithy 
campaign slogan of yesteryear has fallen on fertile soil. Also 
in the opposition. How nice it is to have a common continuity 
when it is a matter of covering up the fiasco of the German tax 
policy with phony figures and hollow words and misleading the 
citizens. 
  The decisive elections are approaching, and the chancellor 
as 
well as his adversary agree that German taxes are not to be 
increased. There will be a little redistribution, to be sure, 
but, and there too they are agreed, that is not the same as a 
tax hike. Both of them are tacitly taking for granted that the 
new taxes known as the solidarity tax (CDU [Christian Democratic 
Union]) and the supplementary tax (SPD [Social Democratic Party 
of Germany]) have already been passed and are thus not new. 
  The campaign promises of lower taxes will be broken. It is a 
sure thing that the next finance minister in Bonn, regardless of 
his party affiliation, must implement two directives of the 
Constitutional Court justices and, in addition to the 
supplementary or solidarity tax, must undertake something which 
will equate to higher property taxes, estate taxes, assets 
taxes, and/or value-added taxes. All the parties in Bonn know 
that and are laughing softly. 
  The grand coalition against the taxpayers is a done deal. 
Both camps have further snatches up their sleeves. The 
chancellor would like to raise gasoline prices to save the 
railroad system, his opponent cites other methods to achieve the 
same purpose and, apart from that, broods on the budgetary 
risks. And despite all their bombast, neither gives the 
slightest insight into how the maximum-taxation country of 
Germany is to become a region in which achievement will once 
again pay off. 
  Regardless who leads the next government, it will skim 
generously off the top of their subjects' incomes--including 
church tax, roughly 62 percent. A grasp of this magnitude will 
not be an isolated occurrence. For single persons, incomes will, 
according to the tax tables, be taxed at this rate up to 120,000 
German marks [DM]. Regardless who leads the government, it will 
continue taking also from its subjects' consumption and capital 
assets--most of which were created from taxed incomes. 
  From the standpoint of its impact on the national economy, 
the pincer attack on capital assets and incomes can only be 
depicted in gloomy colors: The creation of capital assets is 
hampered in threefold fashion with all the negative consequences 
for investments, growth, and standard of living. How, under 
these circumstances, the collective vigor and entrepreneurial 
spirit of these subjects are to bring about a revival of the 
economy, and how the urgently needed new jobs are to be created 
in the process, will remain the secret of the grand coalition 
parties. 
  Less of a secret is the assumption that the entrepreneurial 
spirit of the ripoff victims will discover the higher marginal 
utility in the development of countermeasures. The figures 
confirm the expectation: The transfer of capital to Luxemburg 
and Switzerland continues unabated; the cash money in 
circulation increased from early in 1990 to the end of 1993 from 
DM65 billion to DM212 billion. Doing unreported work on the side 
and tax evasion have what it takes to become trivial offenses 
and a mass phenomenon. If they would stop and think a little, it 
should occur to all the parties that their uninhibited "right 
on" is leading into a cul-de-sac. 
  Eminent economists, with the Bundesbank in the lead, have 
been preaching consolidation and savings for years. No one in 
Bonn is listening. Where is the party that will honestly and 
bluntly point to the predictable budgetary gaps and, instead of 
making nebulous taxation promises, tells the responsible citizen 
in clear terms that it will save the missing billions, and where 
it will do so?

<F P=106> [Article by Martin Kessler: "Hefty Increases; No Matter Who </F>
Wins the Bundestag Elections--A Rude Awakening Awaits the 
Germans: Higher Taxes Are Due"] 
  [Text] Joachim Gruenewald, parliamentary state secretary in 
the Federal Finance Ministry, had ventured too far out on a 
limb. His announcement that, following a successful election, 
the Federal Government would eliminate significant portions of 
the trade tax in 1996 left a bad taste in the Chancellor's 
mouth. All discussions concerning taxes, thus Helmut Kohl 
directed, regardless whether they dealt with increases or 
decreases, were "taboo for the time being." Not until June may 
Finance Minister Theo Waigel announce the basic features of the 
future taxation policy of the black-yellow coalition. 
  The chancellor's injunction comes too late. The debate on 
taxes is already in full swing--and it is as chaotic as it ever 
was. Rhineland-Palatinate Economics Minister Rainer Bruederle, 
for instance, who has aspirations to a higher office, is 
demanding that the corporate tax reform take place in 1995 
already. His party boss, Klaus Kinkel, on the other hand, 
considers the room for maneuver for short-term tax decreases to 
be "extremely limited." 
  For his part, Wolfgang Schaeuble, the leader of the CDU 
[Christian Democratic Union] caucus in the Bundestag, again has 
his sights set on persons with higher incomes. Helmut Kohl's 
right-hand man sees further room for movement in the assets and 
estate taxes (see WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE 17/1994). 
  The confused discussion concerning the future tax policy of 
the coalition does not bode well for the postelection period. 
  The six leading economic research institutes have figured 
out 
in the their spring report that the Federal Government, the 
laender, the municipalities, and the Trust Agency, will incur 
debts this year to the tune of 200 billion German marks [DM], 
more than 6 percent of the total German GNP. Only if the economy 
grows at a faster rate in the coming years than expected will 
Waigel reach his goal of lowering the new indebtedness of the 
Federal Government to under DM40 billion by 1997. In the 
meantime, he and his colleagues in the laender and 
municipalities will once again reach deeply into the pockets of 
the taxpayers. In 1995, that much is already certain today, the 
tax burden will rise to the record level of 45 percent. 
  It is not even clear if the already passed 7.5-percent 
solidarity tax will suffice to bring the horrendous deficits 
back to a tolerable level. The number of unemployed in Germany 
as a whole, the finance policy spokesman of the CDU/CSU 
[Christian Social Union] caucus, Hansgeorg Hauser, conjectures, 
has to drop well "below 3 million." Hauser: "If not, things are 
going to get tight." 
  Against this background, it is small solace that the Social 
Democrats, as well, have little to offer. How Oskar Lafontaine, 
the candidate for finance minister in Rudolf Scharping's shadow 
cabinet, plans to plug up the gaps in the revenue receipts 
remains his secret for the time being. 
  Scharping and his men must, after all, also come up with an 
answer to the question as to how they envision the future 
taxation system after the elections. For it is then that the 
Germans will be facing a revolution in the tax law. By 1996, the 
Federal Constitutional Court has decided, the government, be it 
black-red, social-liberal, or red-green, must exempt from 
taxation the minimum subsistence level of circa DM11,555 for 
single persons and DM23,111 for married persons. The costs of 
this measure: circa DM40 billion. 
  And because the justices in Karlsruhe have gotten so nicely 
warmed up [are on a roll], the supreme German body of justice 
will probably topple another pillar of taxation by the end of 
the year: The specification in effect to date of the so-called 
standard values used for determining the worth of private and 
corporate assets, real estate, and single-family homes. 
  Because the standard values for tax purposes comprise only 
between 10 and 21 percent of the actual sales values, jurists 
consider this method of calculation unconstitutional. The 
wealth-based taxes collected are of five different types: 
  --Property taxes (revenues collected in 1993: DM10.8 
billion); 
  --Trade taxes (revenues collected: DM41.4 billion); 
  --Assets taxes (revenues collected in 1993: DM6.8 billion); 
  --Estate and gift taxes (revenues collected in 1993: DM3.1 
billion). 
  For property taxes alone, there is a gap of approximately 
DM65 billion between the actual and the tax value. Quite a shock 
to property owners: The owner of a single-family house worth 
circa DM500,000 would, instead of DM700, suddenly have to pay 
DM5,400 per year in property taxes. 
  There is material enough here for a fundamental reform of 
the 
German tax law, which has meanwhile become arcane. But precisely 
now, at a time when the governing parties in Bonn are presented 
with an opportunity to thin out the jungle, they "fail to 
display an all-in-all convincing concept," as the fiscal 
researchers of the Rhenish-Westphalian Institute for Economic 
Research (RWI) note with polite restraint in their latest study. 
To be sure, representatives of the Christian-liberal coalition, 
such as Schaeuble, Waigel, and Kinkel, never grow tired of 
emphasizing that "tax increases after the elections are out of 
the question." Secretly, however, they have long since had their 
eye on surcharges on the tax on petroleum products and the 
value-added tax. Waigel wants to plug the DM8 billion fiscal 
hole with revenues coming from a reform of the railroad system. 
Schaeuble is looking for ways to finance the tax exemption of 
the minimum subsistence level. 
  When there is an emergency, the politicians will grasp at 
any 
straw to save themselves. The warning of the German Bundesbank 
in its latest report, namely that the "further increasing tax 
burden" is becoming "the critical factor with respect to the 
operating location conditions for the German economy," is being 
ignored in the same way as the admonition by the six economic 
institutes in their latest spring [1994] report to gradually 
decrease the solidarity tax from 1996 on. 
  Germany, the institutes demand, must drastically scale back 
its high taxation rates. As recently as 1990, according to an 
RWI study, the FRG, with a tax "bite" of 37 percent, occupied 
the "middle ground" among the OECD countries. Three years later, 
the picture has changed completely. While the United States and 
Japan take an average of only about 30 percent of incomes from 
their citizens, the FRG has now reached the same level as the 
traditionally high-taxation countries Netherlands, Sweden, and 
Norway. 
  Instead of submitting a convincing plan for bringing the tax 
burden of 45 percent, which is unprecedented in the history of 
the FRG, back to a normal level, the coalition is tinkering 
around aimlessly with individual measures. 
  For example: Income taxes. Since no one among the Christian 
Democrats and liberals knows where the DM40 billion are to come 
from that the Constitutional Court's minimum subsistence level 
resolution costs, Waigel's civil servants are resorting to 
deceptive packaging tactics. And so, for example, the finance 
minister wants to grant the tax exemption up to the minimum 
subsistence level only to the lower income groups. This, 
officials in his ministry have figured out, would result in a 
loss to the public coffers of "only" DM4 billion. 
  Whether or not this is constitutional is questionable. If 
the 
finance minister establishes income limits for the granting of 
the tax-free minimum subsistence level, tax expert Professor 
Joachim Lang of Cologne fears, he will be violating the 
"uniformity of taxation" prescribed by the Basic Law. There 
would then be variable tax rate progressions, depending on the 
levels of income. 
  However, Waigel's solution is controversial not only in a 
juristic but also in an economic sense. If the tax-free minimum 
subsistence income benefited only the lower income groups, hefty 
fault-lines in the tax rate structure would result--with a tax 
rate limit of more than 100 percent. 
  Already now, Waigel has crafted a special taxation rate for 
recipients of incomes up to DM11,555 per year which leads to 
dubious results. To be sure, as the decision of the 
Constitutional Court prescribes for the transition period up to 
1996, persons with low incomes do, in fact, not have to pay any 
taxes. At the same time, however, the tax offices, in 
calculating the amount of these persons' taxes, no longer use 
the taxable income as the basis, as in the past, but the total 
earnings, which closely follow the criteria used for making 
welfare payments. The fatal consequence: Whoever earns more will 
be taxed in accordance with the traditional tax tables--with the 
result that by going above this limit he has less in his pocket 
after taxes than before. "Very annoying," says CDU/CSU spokesman 
for fiscal matters, Hansgeorg Hauser. 
  Now the price is being paid for the fact that the Kohl 
government did not raise taxes during the time of the 
unification boom. Then it would have been able, following the 
elections, to couple the tax computation reform that is being 
demanded with a general tax decrease. But the opportunity was 
missed. Kohl's tax policy experts are faced with the dilemma of 
either tightening the progression again or collecting the 
missing revenues elsewhere. 
  Therefore, regardless who governs after the 16th of October, 
the Germans will have to prepare themselves for new tax hikes. 
Already firmly planned by the current coalition--all denials 
notwithstanding--are higher taxes on petroleum products and a 
higher value-added tax. "If we are to reduce income taxes 
perceptibly," says Hermann Rind (FDP [Free Democratic Party]), 
the chairman of the finance committee in the Bundestag, in 
defense of tax plans to that end, "we must speak openly about 
such reflections." 
  Lower taxes on earned incomes and investments, higher taxes 
on consumption--that would indeed strengthen the much invoked 
growth forces of the economy. But currently it does not look as 
if that will happen. It may well be that, with the tills empty, 
the tax burden on incomes will decline hardly at all, but the 
treasury will help itself generously to increased taxes on 
gasoline and a higher value-added tax. 
  How little the finance policy experts concerned themselves 
with economic interrelationships in the process is illustrated 
by the discussion of the assets tax. It is the unanimous opinion 
of almost all economists that this tax is completely 
superfluous, one which burdens economic savings in no less than 
three different ways by taking away from corporate assets, stock 
holdings, and incomes from property. For this reason, thus the 
pronouncements by economic policy experts of the coalition all 
over the country, this tax must be done away with as soon as 
possible. In actuality, the Christian Democrats and the liberals 
raised the tax allowances and doubled the rates only just last 
year. And Schaeuble does not want to rule out further increases. 
  The Social Democrats, on the other hand, are pinning their 
hopes entirely on growth. Their supposed miracle drug: An 
employment pact between the state, the collective bargaining 
partners, and the Bundesbank. In the event of an SPD victory in 
the election, the labor unions are then to content themselves 
with moderate wage increases. 
  In return, Lafontaine plans to lighten the tax burden of 
employees and investing enterprises, and the Bundesbank is to 
reward the restraint shown by the collective bargaining partners 
with low interest rates. If the economy grows strongly in the 
way that it has in the United States, thus the hope of the 
opposition party, the fiscal problems will automatically lose 
some of their acuteness. 
  If the complicated SPD calculation does not work out, the 
Social Democrats must either go back to the long-standing tactic 
of tightening the tax screws again, or the public finances will 
go out of control. Events of the most recent past have shown, 
however, that the Bundesbank is allergic to growing budget 
deficits. 
  And that will not change for the foreseeable future. In the 
persons of Hans Tietmeyer and Johann Gaddum, the monetary 
institute in Frankfurt is headed by no less than two CDU 
politicians.

  [Text] Paris, May 11 (AFP) -- French Prime Minister Edouard 
Balladur demanded Wednesday [11 May] the unconditional release 
of 11 French aid workers held by Bosnian Serbs for alleged arms 
trafficking. 
  Balladur's Minister of European Affairs Alain Lemassoure 
warned the Serbs that, if they continued with their "parody of a 
trial" of the 11, Paris would regard the affair as a war crime. 
  The 11 members of the Premiere Urgence (First Emergency) 
group have been held since April 8 at the Sarajevo suburb of 
Lukavica and deny the smuggling allegations. The Bosnian Serbs 
have just extended their detention for a month pending trial and 
say the detainees could face up to 15 years in prison. 
  UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali said here Wednesday 
that he hoped to obtain the men's release. "We hope that 
through negotiation we can find a way to free the hostages," he 
said after a 45-minute meeting with Balladur. 
  Balladur assured French National Assembly deputies the 
government was "using all the means it can" to obtain its 
nationals' release. He decried that the aid workers were being 
"held hostage in the most cynical fashion". 
  The French premier also told parliament the time was 
approaching when France would have to consider if there was any 
point in continuing her presence in Bosnia if the "Great Powers" 
and the warring factions were not ready to take appropriate 
action to resolve the conflict. 
  Foreign Ministers from Europe, the United States and Russia 
are due to hold a meeting on Bosnia Friday in Geneva.

  [Text] I have just learned that the 11 French people from 
the aid organization Premiere Urgence who are being detained in 
Bosnia could be released soon. This was said this morning by 
Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader. According to the 
Bosnian Serb agency SRNA [Serbian News Agency], the release 
could take place as soon as a legal formula has been found.

  [Excerpt] French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, who is in 
Washington, asked the United States to support the political 
settlement to the Bosnian conflict proposed by Paris. He also 
threatened to withdraw the 6,000 French peacekeeping forces from 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] if there is no prospect of a 
political settlement. 
  Speaking at John Hopkins University, Alain Juppe said the 
French plan envisions the gradual lifting of international 
sanctions against Serbia once a cease-fire has been concluded 
and territorial partition agreed on. 
  Alain Juppe told U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
there is no question of spending another winter in Bosnia. 
Christopher remained very cautious. He reaffirmed that the aim 
of the United States is to obtain a cease-fire and a renewal of 
the peace talks between the two sides. We cannot predict 
precisely what will come of it, he added. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report on Interior Minister Charles Pasqua remarks made to </F>
the National Assembly in Paris on 11 May -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Announcer] In Paris today, Interior Minister 
Charles Pasqua announced that he will be taking supplementary 
measures to avert terrorist activities by foreigners in France. 
He declined to give any further details. He was in fact 
answering a question from a deputy on the situation in Algeria, 
and on the arrest last Friday [6 May] of an Algerian in 
possession of weapons in France. In fact, in Pasqua's view, the 
best way of avoiding this export of terrorism is to support the 
Algerian Government in its effort to put an end to the crisis: 
  [Pasqua] Algeria is an independent, sovereign state, faced 
with terrorist action in which, unfortunately, about a dozen of 
our nationals have been victims. The Algerian Government should 
provide itself with the means to restrict these terrorist 
actions and to fight them. It is applying itself to this 
matter. It is not for us to intervene in Algeria's internal 
affairs. Our country's interest, the interest of France, and, 
in general terms, of Europe -- which cannot fail to take an 
interest in what is happening on the other side of the 
Mediterranean -- is to see a democratic solution found to the 
situation in Algeria, and to see peace prevail throughout this 
territory once more. This is the reason why the French 
Government wishes to encourage the efforts of the Algerian 
Government along the path of a peaceful search for this solution.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Nuclear Testing: Balladur Disagrees </F>
With Mitterrand"] 
  [Text] Prime Minister Edouard Balladur yesterday closed the 
48th session of the IHEDN [National Institute for High Level 
Studies] at the French Military School with a speech in which he 
stated his views on defense. The text of his speech revealed 
that he does not share the views of the president of the 
Republic with regard to nuclear deterrent policy. 
  The prime minister did not rule out "the possible restart of 
nuclear testing, depending on the international situation and 
the behavior of the other nuclear powers," stressing that 
"France never agreed to link the suspension of its nuclear 
testing with the negotiation" of the Complete Test Ban Treaty 
(CTBT). Mr. Balladur explained that this possible restart of 
testing and "our involvement in the negotiation" of the treaty 
"were not therefore incompatible." The prime minister reiterated 
that, on 13 October 1993, he had told the National Assembly that 
the government "would not subscribe to any definitive ban on 
testing as long as it felt such testing was essential to the 
technical credibility of our deterrent force." 
<H5>  `Threshold' Countries </H5>
  With these words, Mr. Balladur distanced himself from the 
stance taken on nuclear testing by Mr. Mitterrand last Thursday 
[5 May]. In a speech to 200 guests, including representatives 
of the military establishment and arms manufacturers, the head 
of state assured his audience that "for as long as he remained 
in office, there would be no further testing." He also said he 
was convinced that "afterward, they would not resume testing 
because France will not want to offend the whole world by 
restarting the arms race." He added: "I have confidence in my 
successors; they will not be able to do otherwise," implicitly 
referring to the upcoming diplomatic deadlines of the revision 
of the Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) in 1995 and the conclusion 
of a test ban treaty expected shortly afterward. 
  The prime minister also asked that the "threshold" countries 
(those on the verge of acquiring nuclear arms) should 
participate in the drawing up of the CTBT, something that is not 
currently envisaged. Balladur argued that the "forum for 
negotiation, which must be multilateral, should immediately 
involve the threshold countries." He continued: "It is very 
important for the disarmament conference to extend as far as 
possible so that all threshold countries are represented." With 
regard to the implementation of the treaty, Mr. Balladur warned 
that it could only take effect if the threshold countries also 
ratified it. 
  While the chairman of the committee charged with drawing up 
the text for this complete test ban said at the end of March 
that this treaty could be ready by 1995, Mr. Balladur emphasized 
that "there was absolutely no fixed deadline for the conclusion" 
of the treaty which is to "settle numerous and complex" issues. 
The prime minister added that the government would oppose "in 
particular linking the extension of the NPT at the May 1995 
conference to the conclusion of a CTBT." He warned: "The 
failure to extend the NPT could place question marks over our 
commitment to a test ban treaty." 
<H5>  Conscription To Remain </H5>
  In addition, Edouard Balladur argued that the mixed army 
system was "certainly not designed to be inflexible," even if, 
"in the short- to medium-term, the Armed Forces cannot do 
without conscription." Mr. Balladur continued: "The government 
has made choices for the foreseeable future, some 15 years 
hence," and he considered it "high likely" that "the system will 
evolve in one direction or another after that time." As far as 
the "modalities of this evolution" were concerned, the prime 
minister said that he thought it was "wiser to firstly implement 
the military programming law...before trying to imagine future 
changes." 
  Nevertheless, the prime minister stressed that he "did not 
believe" that a professional Army would "be sufficient to meet 
French defense obligations and ambitions." He said: "France 
has ambitions and responsibilities far beyond its national 
borders...which require a large [defense system]." He pointed 
out that a professional Army not only posed the question of 
structural coherence in view of missions, but also of human 
resources and cost. 
  With regard to staffing levels, Mr. Balladur estimated that 
some 48,000 men would have to be hired every year if 
conscription were to be abolished. He noted that the United 
Kingdom had "problems recruiting 28,000 men per year." With 
regard to cost, he explained that if forces were reduced by 20 
percent as a result of total professionalization, there would be 
an "annual additional expenditure of 20 to 25 billion francs." 
He added: "Thus, unless the defense budget were increased 
together with a tax on wealth, abolishing conscription would 
lead to a drastic reduction in the size of the Armed Forces."

<F P=106> [Report signed "S. Pol": "Balladur's Popularity Picks Up </F>
Again"] 
  [Text] Edouard Balladur's popularity is rising. According 
to opinion polls carried out by Gallup and BVA [Brulle Ville 
Associates] in early May, it increased by eight and 10 points in 
one month. (Footnote) (The 5-6 May Gallup poll was conducted on 
a sample of 961 people by telephone. For the 21-5 May [as 
published] BVA poll, 951 people were interviewed face to face.) 
These two opinion polls confirm the rising popularity of the 
government leader, who had suffered significant losses at the 
end of March and in early April, after the demonstrations 
against the job training contract. "Balladur's lower popularity 
in early April was cyclical," Romain Pache, BVA's research 
manager, opined. "No other government leader has enjoyed such a 
confidence rating 13 months after entering office," he stressed. 
According to Gallup, 50 percent (up 8 percent) of the French 
people approve Balladur's policies while 41 percent (down 10 
percent) disapprove of them. Nine percent (up 2 percent) gave 
no opinion. For the BVA poll, favorable opinions with regard to 
the prime minister increased by 10 percent to reach 54 percent. 
Balladur is also leading the confidence ratings given to 
politicians, with 51 percent of positive responses (up 6 
percent). "Today Balladur's increased ratings can be seen in the 
socioeconomic categories or age groups which had penalized him. 
In particular this applies to the 25- to 34-year-olds, 
intermediate professions, ecologists, Socialists, or those who 
say they are not close to any party," according to Pache's 
analysis. 
  Last week a Sofres [French Opinion Polling Company] poll 
noted a 4-percent increase for the prime minister, with 57 
percent of people having confidence in him. For a Louis Harris 
poll, 46 percent of the French people (up 5 percent) felt that 
the government's policies "were going in the right direction" 
compared with 47 percent (down 7 percent) who thought the 
opposite. At the end of April CSA [Audiovisual High Council] 
noted a 4-percent increase to 44 percent in its monthly poll, 
after a 12-percent drop in March.

<F P=106> [Report by Patrice-Henry Desaubliaux: "New Chiefs of Staff </F>
for Navy and Air Force"] 
  [Text] On a proposal by Defense Minister Francois Leotard, 
the cabinet appointed two new chiefs of staff for the Navy and 
Air Force yesterday. 
  Admiral Jean-Charles Lefebvre was appointed to the post of 
Navy chief of staff effective as of 1 July, at which time he 
will also receive his fifth star. He replaces Admiral Alain 
Coatanea, who reached the age limit for his rank at the end of 
March. 
  Born on 1 May 1938, Jean-Charles Lefebvre has commanded the 
Naval Action Force (FAN) since June 1992. A former student of 
the Naval Academy and nuclear engineer, he commanded an escort 
ship, the frigate Georges-Laygues and, from 1985 to 1987, the 
aircraft carrier Clemenceau. At the Navy staff, he was the head 
of the planning and finance division from 1990 to 1992. He has 
a reputation for great intellectual rigor. He becomes head of 
the Navy at a time when it has been rocked by the accident of 
the nuclear attack submarine Emeraude, when the Armed Forces are 
being increasing organized on an interforce basis, and when the 
way is opening up toward a European defense policy. At the Rue 
Royale, where the "Optimar" plan was launched, he is the one who 
will have to implement and lead the military programming law 
(with the priority of maintaining the credibility of the 
strategic ocean force and the preparation of the project for a 
second nuclear aircraft carrier by 1997). He will also ensure 
that the Navy indeed remains, as Admiral Coatanea would like, 
"above a critical size." 
  General Jean-Philippe Douin has been promoted to general of 
the Air Force and he succeeds General Vincent Lanata as chief of 
staff for the Air Force. . 
<H5>  Changes To Be Implemented </H5>
  Born on 8 April 1940, Gen. Douin is a fighter pilot. Since 
October 1992, he has been the deputy chief of staff of the Armed 
Forces, the deputy to Admiral Lanxade, after serving as the 
second in command for operations at EMA [Military Air Force 
College] and earlier in the Air Force. 
  The Air Force, of which he will take command on 1 July, has 
experienced profound changes in the past two and a half years 
since the Gulf War, under the authority of Gen. Lanata. There 
has been a series of administrative and operational 
reorganizations, as well as a major rejuvenation of its combat 
aircraft fleet. Going beyond the minimum of 460 combat aircraft 
on line, it has opted for fewer aircraft (390), but more modern 
ones. By summer, it will be possible to refuel all of its 
combat aircraft in flight. 
  This reorganization, which will give the Air Force "more 
muscle," will be offset by a considerable -- some say excessive 
-- downscaling of its size. The programming law calls for some 
5,000 jobs to be cut, including 1,600 officer positions, and 
therefore the closing of several bases. 
  Gen. Douin will have to implement these changes. He will 
have to pursue the Rafale (to be operational by 2002) and Mirage 
2000-5 (to be operational in 1998) programs; launch the major 
future transport aircraft program; decide on the withdrawal in 
1996-97 of the Mirage-IV's from the strategic Air Force; prepare 
the eventual launch of a second component of nuclear deterrence, 
the one favored by Gen. Lanata, i.e., the duo comprising the 
Rafale and a long-range surface-to-air missile. 
  He will also have to ensure that the modernization of the 
combat fleet is maintained through a steady series of new orders 
and deliveries. This is an ambitious objective since, if the 
current pace is maintained, three-fourths of this fleet will be 
more than 10 years old in the year 2000, whereas today, half of 
it is less than 10 years old. 
  To succeed Gen. Douin as deputy chief of staff at the Armed 
Forces staff, the cabinet appointed another aviator, Lieutenant 
General Jean Rannou. For three years, Gen. Rannou was head of 
the military staff of the defense minister (under Pierre Joxe 
and then Francois Leotard), where he proved to be an efficient 
organizer and a loyal adviser. A master at speaking frankly, 
which is actually a rather rare (and sometimes burdensome) 
quality, he knows how to speak in confidence, which is even 
rarer in the military world.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Political Leaders Oppose Referendum </F>
on Employment"] 
  [Text] The proposal put forward last week by National 
Assembly Speaker Philippe Seguin to hold a referendum on the 
fight against unemployment is still giving rise to numerous 
reactions. Seguin seems to have found further support in the 
person of Jean-Pierre Chevenement, the chairman of the Citizens' 
Movement. 
  As a guest of France-2 television's "Hour of Truth" talk 
show 
on Sunday 8 May, Chevenement subscribed to the idea, provided 
that "the question is properly worded." In his opinion, this 
was not the case in the proposals currently being advanced by 
Mr. Seguin. According to the former defense minister, the 
question the French should be asked is the following: "Do you 
agree with the plan to compel companies, within a three-year 
period, to hire 1.5 million unemployed, who will continue to be 
payed by the Assedic [Association for Employment in Industry and 
Commerce] and will benefit from a number of training schemes?" 
  All other political leaders have rejected the idea of 
holding 
a referendum on employment. When asked for his opinion during 
the "Grand Jury RTL-LE MONDE" program, Budget Minister and 
Government Spokesman Nicolas Sarkozy flatly rejected the 
proposal: "We will not succeed in strengthening the 
intermediary organizations by acting over their heads." He also 
attacked those who wanted to reduce the "passive costs 
associated with unemployment," that is to say, the benefits 
payed to the unemployed. 
  For his part, Industry Minister Gerard Longuet expressed his 
reservations in an interview with NOUVELLE REPUBLIQUE published 
on Monday, 9 May: "Let us not lead the French people to believe 
that genuine reforms can only be carried out via a referendum. 
I am still convinced...that a government and a parliamentary 
majority have all the necessary legitimacy to carry out 
far-reaching reforms, including reforms in such sensitive areas 
as education, employment, and health," Mr. Longuet said. 
  Finally, former Socialist Employment Minister Martine Aubry 
made fun at Mr. Seguin's proposal. "I thought it was a joke. 
If the intention is to ask the French people whether 
unemployment is their number-one concern, it is rather worrying 
that a referendum should be needed for this," she remarked. On 
Friday, 6 May, Francis Wurtz, who is heading the Communist lists 
in the European elections, told FORUM RMC-L'EXPRESS that, 
although he "favored consulting the people," he believed that 
Mr. Seguin's proposal "is a trap," aimed at "making the French 
ratify an austerity policy which, as is well known, they do not 
want."

<F P=106> [Interview with French Democratic Union President Valery </F>
Giscard d'Estaing by Patrick Jarreau; place and date not given: 
"Giscard d'Estaing: `Fight Against Unemployment Too Crucial To 
Wait for Referendum'" -- first paragraph is LE MONDE 
introduction] 
  [Excerpt] Philippe Seguin's 1 May proposal for a referendum 
on employment confirmed that the Right's presidential election 
campaign will be focused on economic and social policy issues. 
In this interview, UDF [French Democratic Union] President 
Valery Giscard d'Estaing explains why he believes the fight 
against unemployment cannot wait for the procedural reform 
required to consult the French on such a topic in a referendum. 
  [Jarreau] What do you think of Philippe Seguin's proposal 
with respect to a referendum on employment? 
  [Giscard d'Estaing] I am delighted to see that the debate on 
unemployment and employment has regained momentum. There is one 
point I regret, however, and that is the fact that no one has 
dared to utter the word "full employment," and that we are still 
only looking for means to curb the growth of unemployment. 
  The referendum proposal has to do with form, not with 
content. One could envision extending the scope of Section 11 of 
the Constitution to include issues such as education or 
employment, but this would imply that the government needs to 
draft a bill of law to that effect before the French can be 
consulted. 
  The experience of the five-year employment act passed 
earlier 
this year showed that this legislative approach is probably not 
the most efficient method. We need to go about it differently. 
Asking the public to voice its opinion on a controversial issue 
is not an intrinsically bad idea, but we need to know which 
concrete measure would be embedded in the bill subjected to a 
referendum. 
  [Jarreau] Do you think that such a proposal for a referendum 
may take away a number of responsibilities from elected 
officials and members of Parliament? 
  [Giscard d'Estaing] That is a real danger. Charles Millon 
[president of the UDF caucus in the National Assembly] was right 
to emphasize it. The best way to avert it would be to have 
Parliament discuss the bill first. A referendum held pursuant 
to Section 11 can only be decided during a parliamentary session 
or on a joint proposal from both houses. One can hardly imagine 
that the public would then be consulted on a bill against the 
will of the National Assembly. 
  Concretely, such an approach would go like this: parliament 
would be given an opportunity to discuss the bill and to 
indicate that it does not oppose it, and then a referendum would 
be held. In my opinion, a debate in parliament is essential to 
improve the bill, to lessen the excessive influence of senior 
civil servants, and to help French people understand the bill. 
  The extension of the scope of Section 11 on referenda is a 
reform that must be carried out thoughtfully and seriously. The 
urgency of the unemployment problem does not allow us to wait 
for such a reform to come to pass. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Alain Juppe, the RPR [Rally for the Republic] 
secretary general, believes that "there is no such thing as a 
magic solution to the unemployment problem" and advocates 
"simple measures" adopted by parliament rather than through a 
referendum, as was proposed by Philippe Seguin. In his 
editorial in the RPR weekly NATION MAGAZINE, the foreign 
minister states that "it is up to the political authorities to 
define simple measures, but which would constitute a real change 
with regard to the attitudes of the social partners, and to have 
them voted by parliament."

<F P=106> [Report by Jean-Pierre Robin: "Credits: Matignon To Review </F>
Situation With Bankers"] 
  [Text] The economic recovery should not be hampered by lack 
of credit. This is the increasingly insistent theme taken up by 
business leaders and members of parliament, which Edouard 
Balladur will shortly discuss with representatives of the banks. 
As was the case last November, the Matignon [office of the 
prime minister] intends to bypass all problems which are tending 
to slow down the distribution of credit to small- and 
medium-sized businesses: interest rate levels, access to 
financing, and lender guarantees. 
<H5>  Point of Turnaround in August 1993 </H5>
  The monthly statistics published yesterday by the Bank of 
France, which go up to the end of February, confirm the 
economy's volatility. "Over the past seven months, M1, i.e., 
currency in its most limited definition such as banknotes and 
cash deposits, rose 4.1 percent (i.e., 7.1 percent annually)," 
according to the statement released by the Bank of France. 
Using the situation seven months ago is justified by the fact 
that the month of August 1993 corresponds to the beginning of 
the recovery. 
  The bank experts feel that there is no doubt that this 
takeoff of "cash transactions" is "linked primarily to the 
improved prospects for economic activity." 
  The other monetary and financial indicators, however, are 
more uncertain. The money supply M3, which includes virtually 
all means of payment, is continuing a downward trend (3.8 
percent in one year). This is the result, we were told, of 
intense arbitrage "in favor of savings and loan savings plans, 
just before the announced drop in their yield rate." 
  If we go to the other side of the balance sheets to take a 
look not at the money in circulation and savings, but at the 
financing which has been made available to the economy, there is 
not much change in the landscape. Overall, "total domestic 
indebtedness" has risen 5 percent over one year. However, this 
is used primarily to finance the public deficit, the financing 
of which has risen by 26.3 percent over one year. 
  On the other hand, business debt has shrunk by 2.7 percent. 
Only households are once again looking for credit (up 3 percent 
over 12 months), a phenomenon which is relatively recent. 
<H5>  Curious Paradox </H5>
  If the recovery actually materializes, businesses will have 
increased need for operating capital. Paradoxically, the 
recovery is showing an upsurge in bankruptcies, warns Paul-Henri 
Denieuil, the president of SFAC, the French Credit Insurance 
Company. 
  "Access to credit" has become the main concern of small- and 
medium-sized businesses. The cost of money takes second place, 
although it has not disappeared. There is a curious paradox: 
Banks are tending to no longer pass on drops in the Bank of 
France's standard rates. "Like in the United States, French 
financial establishments must become more solid before they 
start lending again," an adviser on monetary policy explained. 
  There is still a trump card that can revive the banks' 
desire 
to lend: the reform of the 1985 law on bankruptcies. 
  The text, as it emerged from the joint (National 
Assembly-Senate) parliamentary committee today, reestablishes 
the safeguards that were requested by creditors.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Balladur Launches `Great Debate' on </F>
Social Security"] 
  [Text] Yesterday, Edouard Balladur announced the launch 
"this fall" of a "great national debate" on social security 
funding, following the submission of the white paper on health 
insurance reform. France is a country "in which protection, 
deemed vital by the vast majority of the population, could be 
regarded as a constraint for the economy," the prime minister 
said, but "this constraint must be fully accepted." He 
explained that social security had "a great advantage in 
preventing risks of social conflagration, which would be 
inevitable if this system did not exist." The prime minister 
warned that we "must not expect that France, like other large 
countries, can create millions of jobs which are paid scarcely 
more than one-fourth of the minimum wage...; that is not our 
social and political system." Although it is necessary to make 
"efforts" to reduce business costs, we must "think" about means 
of funding social security by "other methods." Balladur 
wondered whether it would be possible to "partly substitute, 
add, or replace" the existing funding "based on salaries" by 
"methods of funding based on consumption or revenue." This big 
fall debate will probably turn this vast and necessary reform 
into one of the themes of the presidential campaign, which 
Mitterrand's successor will have to implement.

  [Excerpts] The transportation minister is opposing the 
opening up of the Orly [Paris airport]-London route to the 
British airline TAT from next Monday [16 May]. Bernard Bosson 
has said he does not believe it is in keeping with the 
regulations in force and expressed the strongest possible 
reservations concerning the consequences that attempts to 
operate flights outside the law could have. Yet the European 
Commission recently gave its agreement, and the company TAT was 
even preparing to open up this route. Michel Polacco: 
  [Polacco] [passage omitted] The European Commission's 
decision of 27 April makes it obligatory for Orly to be opened 
up to competition, and TAT -- which has become a subsidiary of 
British Airways -- pleased with this decision, has decided, like 
British Airways and Air UK, to enter this market niche. 
[passage omitted] The French Government has lodged a complaint 
with the European Court of Justice, and in the meantime has 
banned the first three flights scheduled to leave Orly from 
Monday for three reasons: Orly is overloaded, and to add to this 
burden would cause environmental problems; Heathrow, which is 
the Orly of London, is not offering any slots to new companies 
-- Air France, for example, who would be interested; third, the 
time limit set by the Commission does not make it possible for 
the carriers to prepare these flights properly. The plans of 
the three airlines have thus not been approved. The flights are 
not authorized for the time being. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial by Philippe Tesson] </F>
  [Text] True to a time-honored show-business tradition, 
Francois Mitterrand began staging his farewell show yesterday. 
Judging from the show he offered the country, we can expect 
some fine displays of seduction in the coming months. With 
inimitable talent, the old star has begun casting its last rays 
of light. Visibly, the president has determined to leave behind 
him an image as flattering and as affable as possible, in 
contrast to his real nature, which may be inferred from his 
partisan past. Now that the end of his mandate is near, the 
activist ideologue of the seventies and eighties, whose overt 
goal was to change society, has now been replaced by a shrewd 
man who has had an opportunity to gauge time, people, things, 
and probably also his own ability to influence history. Truth 
be told, Francois Mitterrand's pride has been sorely tried over 
the last few years. What is left of his appetite for glory, if 
not the deflated dream of Socialism triumphant, a few 
grandiloquent building sites, and the crumbs of shared 
authority? It is no accident that the only issue about which he 
came across forcefully yesterday is that of nuclear testing; he 
had no other topic through which he could show he still had some 
power. 
  What was new was the fact that he did not systematically 
resort to the one other power he made such liberal use of in the 
past: sowing the seeds of discord. Such cordiality was out of 
character, barely tinged with what irony was needed to show he 
remains nobody's fool. But indeed, why fight when there is 
nothing at stake, no more prize to be won? So Francois 
Mitterrand quietly leaves the melee of current history. 
Already, all he has to do is observe its games with amused 
aloofness and controlled nostalgia. So he indulges in mild 
jesting, and politics is reduced to a conversational topic. And 
Francois Mitterrand is very eloquent. Ah, if only the program 
could have lasted one or two hours longer! And his mandate two 
or three extra years! But it is way too late now. 
  Francois Mitterrand's end will not be tragic. He was no born 
hero. Had he been endowed with a little less pride and 
intelligence, he would have preferred the image of a nice and 
harmless old man. One has the feeling that, in the twilight 
years, the temptation is there.

<F P=106> [Report by Guido Passalacqua: "Maroni: `Scalfaro Can Rest </F>
Assured -- I Will Guarantee Italy's Unity'"] 
  [Text] Milan -- "President Scalfaro has nothing to worry 
about. On the contrary, through the presence of one of its 
members in the Viminale [Interior Ministry], the federalist 
Northern League will guarantee Italy's unity." Barely a few 
minutes after the official announcement of his appointment to 
the Interior Ministry, Bobo "the mediator" [Roberto Maroni] -- 
staying in his Lozza cottage -- was already thinking of the 
future and of the president's doubts. For his part, [League 
Secretary] Umberto Bossi learned the news in his office in Via 
Bellerio. He had been unavailable for the whole day, not 
answering phone calls, and giving rise to some concern, 
especially in Rome, that he might be in the throes of a 
brainstorm. For the time being, Bossi limited himself to a few 
spirited remarks: "I am satisfied with the whole government 
team. It is made up of fairly young people. Besides, there are 
few recycled individuals, and this, too, is an important factor." 
  Later on, an official communique arrived in which the League 
secretary confirmed the "democratic guarantor's role fulfilled 
by the League through the Interior Ministry." In the economic 
field, the League ministers will play "a reformist role" while, 
through the Institutional Reform Ministry, the League will 
pursue a twofold objective: "Reforming the existing republican 
Constitution along federalist lines," and embodying the local 
governments' competences in a new ministry. 
  Yesterday was Bobo Maroni's day, however. Sitting on the red 
and green sofa in his living room, holding hands with his wife 
Emi while his children played in the garden, Maroni waited for 
the official announcement on television. "Moved, touched -- I 
defy anybody not to be," he said, but he then returned to 
politics. "I was not worried. We were in no doubt. Early in 
the afternoon [Prime Minister-designate] Berlusconi phoned to 
tell me `everything is in order.'" Not even the story of the 
exchange of letters between Scalfaro and Berlusconi had shaken 
Maroni's confidence: "I would myself have signed the letter 
that Berlusconi sent to the president of the Republic," he 
remarked in the morning. "Scalfaro's letter," he now added, "was 
intended, in a sense, to make Berlusconi assume responsibility 
for the fact that he was appointing a League member to the 
Interior Ministry. Under the circumstances, I believe that the 
prime minister behaved like a true prime minister." Maroni then 
resumed the tones of political and institutional reassurance: 
"Today, through the signature of the state's highest authority, 
it has become apparent that federalism and national unity are 
not incompatible, that federalism is not the same thing as 
separatism." The new interior minister made a promise: "I will 
not tell you what my first measure will be, it will be a 
surprise -- but, paradoxically, I who am a northerner by 
definition, will have the moral obligation to tackle and solve 
the South's problems -- I am fully aware of this." 
  What about the protests from high-ranking bureaucrats and 
the 
prefects? "I have been told that the Interior Ministry has a 
very efficient structure. I will spend the first few months 
studying and observing matters, meeting with senior officials 
and staff, as well as traveling." He then promised: "I will be 
prudent. You see, the first phone call I received this 
afternoon, after the news came that the government had been 
formed, was not from a fellow party member or a politician, but 
from a police inspector whom I did not know. He congratulated 
me and wished me all the best, and told me not to worry. This 
pleased me very much." 
  Yesterday was not only Maroni's day, however. It was also 
the first time the League has been in government and at the 
Viminale -- a true miracle in which, up to a few months ago, 
only Bossi seriously believed. Yesterday he said that, during 
the consultations, he provokingly proposed himself for the 
Interior Ministry: "They all jumped to their feet," he 
recalled, "crying out against subversion." Early in the morning 
on Tuesday [10 May], in the yard of party headquarters, he told 
of how his decision to aim for the government had been reached 
on the night Patelli was arrested. It was in the course of a 
dinner at the "Patrizia" pizzeria that the League's leader 
outlined the path that, months later, enabled his party to 
obtain the appointment of the first non-confessional interior 
minister in close to 50 years, as well as four other portfolios. 
  "We came out of this in tiptop form," Maroni said. "We are 
part of the government, we have been legitimized by the voters, 
by the ministries, and by our visibility within the majority. 
The League is a political subject."

<F P=106> [Report by Raimondo Bultrini: "The Left Warns: `Dark Times </F>
Are Back'"] 
  [Text] Rome -- "The darkest times of the five-party system 
are back," PDS [Democratic Party of the Left deputy leader] 
Massimo D'Alema asserted. "One of the worst moments in the 
republic's history," former Labor Minister Gino Giugni echoed. 
No, "the worst moment in Italy's history," CGIL [Italian 
General Confederation of Labor] Secretary Alfiero Grandi 
corrected. 
  Immediate (or almost) reactions from opponents to 
Berlusconi's government came in a crescendo of alarmed and 
pessimistic tones. The PPI [Italian Popular Party] also spoke 
in hard, uncompromising tones: "The `new' amounts to very 
little, and is not always of the highest quality," Rosa Russo 
Jervolino said. For his part, [Pact for Italy leader] Mario 
Segni asserted that the Knight [Berlusconi nickname] had applied 
the Cencelli manual [powersharing system] and favored "many 
first republic personalities." [Italian Socialist Party, PSI, 
Secretary] Ottaviano del Turco accused Berlusconi of having 
given in to [League Secretary] Bossi's "veto power." Such 
things used to happen -- the PSI secretary recalled -- during 
the so-called First Republic and used to be called instances of 
"partyocracy degeneration." 
  This comparison between the "new" which is being offered to 
the country by the new majority, and the old establishment which 
is reemerging here and there in Berlusconi's order, has become 
to some extent the "refrain" of many current comments: "The 
only novelty lies in arrogance," D'Alema said. "The only 
criterion is power sharing. And this," he added, "is supposed 
to be the new politics? The Second Republic?" Fellow party 
member Claudio Petruccioli spoke in almost identical terms: "A 
government which certainly seems neither new nor reassuring." 
  Specific accusations were also made. Again, Russo Jervolino 
remarked: "The government is plethoric. The fascists' presence 
is significant." It is therefore a government which gives rise 
to concern among PPI members "because of the way it came into 
being and because of its structure." Again, Segni said: "We 
probably owe it to [President] Scalfaro, whom I sincerely thank 
for this, that the prime minister's lawyer (Previti -- LA 
REPUBBLICA editor's note), who had advocated placing the public 
prosecutors under the government's authority, did not get hold 
of the Justice Ministry." 
  The increasing number of opinions expressed as the evening 
unfolded, concerned not only the government's overall 
composition, but also the individual ministers appointed by the 
Knight. The most targeted were [Christian Democratic Center, 
CCD, member and new Education Minister] Franceso D'Onofrio ("We 
are waiting for him," the Students Union said threateningly), 
and [League member and Institutional Reform Minister] Francesco 
Speroni, who was the object of former President Cossiga's 
sarcasm. 
  "Now," Cossiga remarked, "we can finally expect a 
significant, specific Italian contribution to the never resolved 
political-constitutional debate between Schmitt and Felsen on 
the role of guarantees in modern rigid constitutions and the 
evolution of federalism -- the latter being a subject area which 
so far had not been addressed by Italian constitutional science, 
and in which Canadian and North American contributions were 
predominant." "Now" -- and this is where the sting came -- 
"this science will be greatly advanced by the new institutional 
reform minister." Speroni replied immediately, making use of a 
historical quotation: "Federalist Switzerland," he said, "has 
been better governed than the Italy of centralist and Christian 
Democratic know-it-alls." 
  "Number One Berlusconi" was not targeted exclusively by 
critics. Among the trade unions, only the CGIL was decidedly 
against, together with CISL [Italian Confederation of Trade 
Unions] member Raffaele Moreste, who, referring to the 
government, said doubtfully: "I do not think it is highly 
qualified." According to UIL [Italian Federation of Trade 
Unions] confederal secretary Giancarlo Fontanelli, "they are men 
whose professionalism and prestige are unquestionable," while 
CISL leader Sergio D'Antoni preferred to wait for "the platforms 
and the choices made" before giving an opinion. 
  A wait-and-see position was also adopted by Confindustria, 
which requested Berlusconi to "present an `organic' platform, as 
well as immediate initiatives in the areas of taxation, finance, 
and the labor market." Small businessmen, on the other hand, 
did not conceal their satisfaction, speaking as they did of "a 
firm statement of trust," while they waited -- as Confapi 
[Italian Confederation of Small Industrialists] Chairman 
Alessandro Cocirio said -- "for economic recovery, particularly 
for small- and medium-sized businesses." Stock Exchange Council 
chairman Attilio Ventura also expressed "personal satisfaction." 
In his view, "we have a solid government," which "for some 
time, the country had been waiting for," with the economic 
portfolios having been "given to people who are competent and 
businesslike." The women in Federcasalinghe [housewives 
federation] were also "fully satisfied," particularly "because 
of the creation of a Family Ministry," their chairwoman Federica 
Rossi Gasparrini explained. 
  Finally, magistrates were cautious: "There are no objections 
in principle among magistrates," said national secretary Livio 
Pepino, "but we will be looking very closely at the minister's 
choices." Tribute to new Justice Minister Alfredo Biondi was 
paid by Pact for Italy deputy Pietro Milio, the criminal lawyer 
currently defending former Sisde [Intelligence and Democratic 
Security Service] employee Bruno Contrada: "A valid and 
appropriate choice," he said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Cesare Previti by Barbara </F>
Palombelli in Rome on 10 May: "Previti: I Became Minister in 
100 Days"] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- [passage omitted] [Palombelli] So you 
lost: You wanted the Justice Ministry and they gave you Defense. 
  [Previti] No. It is a change for the better. This is a 
wonderful moment for me: It is enough to consider that I 
entered politics on 3 February, and now, 10 May, I am a 
minister. It is incredible. 
  [Palombelli] Do you have a program yet? 
  [Previti] I will be one of the few defense ministers to have 
done my military service. I was an Air Force officer in 
Florence; that was a wonderful experience. 
  [Palombelli] It is not much. 
  [Previti] Actually, apart from my half serious reference to 
my military service, I do have real experience of defense 
matters, acquired during my nine years as deputy chairman first 
of Selenia, then of the new Alenia, the state electronics and 
aeronautics concern. Not everybody knows that our military 
industry is in the vanguard. Right now I can make a pledge to 
increase the annual budget and investment in the Armed Forces, 
which I consider our country's boast, a great human and 
professional asset. Furthermore, it will be necessary to examine 
the role of women . 
  [Palombelli] End of commercial. Who decided to shift you -- 
[President] Scalfaro or [Prime Minister-designate] Berlusconi? 
  [Previti] Neither. Scalfaro did not raise any objections in 
my regard; he did not even mention me in the letter in which he 
set out his anxieties. And Berlusconi insisted that I be made 
justice minister. It was I who decided to stand aside, in view 
of the hail of opposition. I did not want to constitute a 
problem. I did not want Silvio [Berlusconi] to have to fight a 
battle over me. I must say that [Northern League Secretary] 
Bossi and [National Alliance leader] Fini too encouraged me to 
stand firm. I am sure that [Justice Minister] Alfredo Biondi 
will do very well; in particular, he has much more political 
experience than me. 
  [Palombelli] This is a victory for the Democratic Party of 
the Left, which said: Berlusconi's lawyer cannot become justice 
minister. 
  [Previti] Those people are professional detractors. I have 
left my job, relinquished all my posts within Fininvest, have 
been elected to the Senate by the people; as of this morning my 
legal practice has passed to my son, Stefano, and I will resign 
immediately from the lawyers' association. Of course, I am come 
from a modest background, and from a profession that has given 
me both satisfaction and money: Forza Italia won the elections 
precisely on this basis, because it set its sights on the entry 
of professionals into positions of power. But perhaps they 
preferred the previous relationship that existed between the 
caucus leaders and the colonels, a relationship that was often 
murky. 
  [Palombelli] Luigi Berlinguer, the progressive forces' 
leader 
in the lower house, pointed out that you are "a company lawyer 
and a senior manager of Fininvest, a firm into which the 
judiciary have initiated criminal inquiries." 
  [Previti] I can confidently reply with an example that will 
please the progressive forces: U.S. President John Fitzgerald 
Kennedy appointed his brother, Bobby, attorney general. I 
became a friend of John and Bobby in September 1963 when I 
organized an international conference on forensic medicine in 
New York and Washington. A thousand academics, Italians and 
Americans, took part; it was a great success. 
  [Palombelli] A friend of the Kennedys but a member of the 
MSI 
[Italian Social Movement]. 
  [Previti] The time has come to clarify this matter. True, I 
was an MSI member as a boy. Like many others at Rome's Mamiani 
High School, we felt the shame of having lost the war and were 
motivated by our love of our country, the desire to regain 
Trieste. At university I was elected to the "Caravella" list, 
which comprised the Social Movement, monarchists, Liberals, the 
Everyman Movement. Then, at the age of 20, I graduated and 
abandoned all that. In the sixties I was a member of Malagodi's 
PLI [Italian Liberal Party] and joined the leadership; I was 
convinced that if we opted for a right-wing line we would win 
back all our votes from the MSI. My faction was defeated and I 
left. Now, 30 years later, here we have Forza Italia. 
  [Palombelli] You often appear in photographs with a giant 
flame [MSI symbol] behind you. Are you happy about that? 
  [Previti] That business of the photographs with the tricolor 
flame is a petty one. There is no mystery. I was a joint 
candidate for Forza Italia and the MSI, so I was very glad to 
take part in the final rally with Gianfranco Fini. He is a 
politician whom I highly esteem, but recently I have discovered 
that Bossi too is much better than he appears at first glance. 
  [Palombelli] What about the international alarm about a 
Berlusconi government full of MSI ministers? 
  [Previti] The National Alliance is something different from 
the old MSI, which in turn was something different from Fascism. 
Be that as it may, I think it is right that the government team 
that has been chosen is as remote as possible from that distant 
past. And yet people abroad accepted the Communists. 
  [Palombelli] In fact the old PCI [Italian Communist Party] 
has split in two. Within the National Alliance we seem to see 
the coexistence of both tendencies -- the regressive and the 
moderate. 
  [Previti] Perhaps some day there will be a separation on the 
Right, too. 
  [Palombelli] In view of your past, if you had become justice 
minister, would you have demanded the extradition [from 
Argentina] of the executioner of the Fosse Ardeatine [Erich 
Priebke]? 
  [Previti] Of course. Except that, unlike some former 
ministers, I would also have succeeded in securing it quickly.
