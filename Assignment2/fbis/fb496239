<F P=106> [Report by Otmar Lahodynsky: "Unfulfilled Wishes in EEA"] </F>
  [Text] Brussels -- At the first joint ministers' meeting 
of the 17 European Economic Area (EEA) member countries in 
Brussels, Economics Minister Wolfgang Schuessel on the one hand 
praised the EEA as an "important intermediate step" for 
Austria's accession to the European Union [EU]. He said the EEA 
has been able to dispel a number of fears. Thus, the freedom of 
movement for persons within the EEA has not burdened the 
Austrian labor market, and the introduction of common standards 
for food products has not reduced quality. 
  But Schuessel also mentioned several "unfulfilled wishes" 
Austria has in the EEA. Talks between the EU and EFTA [European 
Free Trade Association] on a common zone of origin for the EEA 
and the Eastern European reform states have come to a halt. 
This means that a compensatory duty is put on goods exported to 
the EU that consist of Austrian primary material that is 
processed in Hungary. In the same way, Austrian textiles are 
discriminated against over EU material in the so-called 
"passive, across-the-border processing." Schuessel fears that 
the problem "cannot be settled before Austria joins the EU." 
  The EU was also asked to reduce duties for certain food 
products. The industry that is hardest hit by this delay are 
Austrian jam producers, who still have to pay a 30-percent duty 
on exports to the EU, while jam from EU countries is exported to 
Austria at the reduced 10-percent rate. 
  The 17 ministers also reviewed the implementation of EU 
documents in the five EFTA states participating in the EEA. 
Schuessel rejected recent criticism by the EFTA Supervisory 
Authority, which had blamed Austria for delaying the 
implementation of EEA regulations. Apart from two EU regulations 
on textile fibers and sewage sludge, Austria has "completely 
implemented" all EU regulations relevant to the EEA, Schuessel 
said. In connection with transition periods for environmental 
impact assessments of industrial plants and traffic- related 
projects, Schuessel said that all projects will be subject to 
such evaluations as of 1 July 1994.

  [Text] The Turkish Air Force today launched an air raid on 
the Zhala camp in northern Iraq belonging to the PKK [Workers 
Party of Kurdistan]. It is reported that all targets were 
completely destroyed in the operation. The Chief of Staff's 
Press and Public Relations Office issued the following statement 
on the issue: 
  Intelligence information has been received that the bandits 
are regrouping in the Zhala camp in northern Iraq, which was 
rendered ineffective as a result of an air raid launched by the 
Turkish Air Force on 28 January 1994, and that they are 
preparing to engage in various activities. Between 1200 and 1230 
today, the Turkish Armed Forces used 19 planes, eight of which 
have air to ground assault capability, to launch an air 
operation against the bandit settlement called the Zhala camp. 
All intended targets have been destroyed. The planes completed 
their mission and returned to their base.

<F P=106> [`Mue'-signed report: "Brussels White Paper Reveals </F>
Considerable Differences Between Bonn and Paris"] 
  [Text] Finance Minister Theo Waigel clashed with Jacques 
Delors, the president of the European Union [EU]. It was 
apparently unavoidable and overdue. Delors vehemently rejected 
Waigel's proposal to form an independent team of experts that 
would review all legislation of the EU "as to whether 
unnecessary regulations can be eliminated and whether reliefs 
for the enterprises are possible." At the finance ministers' 
meeting in Brussels on Monday [16 May], Delors made no secret 
that he understood this proposal as a vote of no-confidence 
against himself because the Commission has been examining the 
tangle of EU rules for quite some time. 
  Bonn's financial leader does not deny that. His proposal has 
a completely different background. The Commission's efforts are 
taking place under the motto "subsidiarity." It is discussing 
the distribution of the competence between the community and the 
member states. Waigel's suggestion, however, is partly an 
attempt to translate the findings of the so-called "White Paper 
on Growth, Competitiveness, and Employment" into practical 
economic policy in the community of the Twelve. The leader of 
the Christian Social Union has recently criticized that this 
White Paper, which was drafted by Delors and his aides behind 
closed doors, threatens "to fall apart because of the lack of a 
cohesive concept." In fact, the White Paper contains some ideas 
that the Federal Government supports: More Europewide norms and 
standards to ensure a more efficient use of the single market, 
EU-wide tax and financial reliefs for small and medium-sized 
enterprises, open external borders and flexibility of the labor 
markets, as well as deregulation and consistent privatization. 
Yet the main emphasis of the White Paper is on "trans-European 
energy, transportation, information, and communications 
networks," whose rudimentary establishment alone, however, would 
involve over 300 billion German marks. 
  It is true that Delors' arguments that the national states 
are primarily responsible for deregulation, privatization, and 
the general reform of the political preconditions for 
competitiveness and job-creating investments, but that Brussels 
should be entrusted with planning trans-European networks are 
logical. However, one cannot ignore the fact that the 
Commission is increasingly fascinated by the prospect of 
launching large projects involving huge sums that would make it 
possible to indulge in the redistribution ideology to an even 
greater extent. Even the Brussels news service AGENCE EUROPE, 
which is completely loyal to the Commission, announced recently 
that the EU working group, "Networks," is making good progress, 
whereas the group, "Employment," which is considered more 
important in Bonn, is lagging behind. Delors' policy is totally 
in keeping with the thought pattern of his home country. The 
two governing conservative parties, the Gaullist Rally for the 
Republic and Giscard d'Estaing's liberal-conservative Union for 
French Democracy, are basing their current campaign for the 
European elections on the "large building programs" that are 
currently being drafted in Brussels. 
  The EU heads of state and government want to examine what 
has 
become of the White Paper in about four months. They will 
probably have to make enormous efforts to cover up the fact that 
the economic concepts of the northern and the southern member 
states are hardly compatible. The dividing line runs between 
France and Germany. As early as the most recent summit in 
Brussels in December, when the White Paper was presented, 
dissonance arose spontaneously. The Commission pointed out the 
significance of a solid budget policy to the member states, 
always trying to use the "networks" as a vehicle for obtaining 
permission to take up capital at its own initiative.

the Greek position on Skopje's [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia--FYROM] name has been stated and the Greek Government 
is not under any pressure. This was in reference to today's 
press reports and to UN mediator Cyrus Vance's meeting with 
Ambassador Khristos Zakharakis, the Foreign Ministry secretary 
general. He said the government is talking with everyone who 
has undertaken any initiative to resolve the issue and is 
seeking solutions. 
  Venizelos reiterated that Greece remains firm in its 
positions, and discussed the obvious U.S. interest toward a 
Skopje solution.

  [Excerpts] Paris has threatened to take such a decision 
several times and Francois Leotard announced it this morning: 
France will withdraw 2,500 blue helmets from Bosnia; that is, a 
third of the French contingent, before the end of the year. 
[passage omitted] 
  The French Foreign Ministry adds a note of caution: this 
figure of 2,500 will have to be adjusted. First, because the 
withdrawal operation of 1,000 blue helmets from Sarajevo was 
already planned. As for the rest, we will wait and see, Alain 
Juppe says: 
  [Begin Juppe recording] This operation is under way. It is a 
gradual reduction, if I may say so, which was planned and 
announced within the context of the concentration of our troops 
in Sarajevo, an idea we have entertained for a long time. For 
the rest -- that is, the 1,500 men or so who are in Bihac -- 
their status will be considered by the end of the year but no 
final decision has yet been taken. This, I repeat, will depend 
on the development of the diplomatic process. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Sebastiano Messina: "Truce Already Broken; </F>
Scalfaro Under Siege"] 
  [Excerpts] Rome -- [President] Scalfaro was already under 
siege even before the ministers, having left the [presidential] 
Quirinale Palace all in their blue suits, reached their 
respective offices. The moment the president finished signing 
the 25 appointment decrees, he heard the first sounds of mortar 
fire. It came from the direction of National Alliance [AN] 
headquarters, and the trigger was pulled by Maurizio Gasparri, 
one of [AN leader] Gianfranco Fini's generals. He said 
nonchalantly: "Scalfaro was very worried about the Italian 
Social Republic, which ended 50 years ago. We, however, are 
very concerned and very worried about the Sisde [Intelligence 
and Military Security Service], which is much more currently at 
the center of judicial developments. Furthermore, time will 
tell whether Scalfaro is as beyond reproach as many believe him 
to be, or whether, as interior minister, he too, like others, 
was implicated in the scandal." 
  In Fini's MSI [Italian Social Movement], it is Gasparri who 
sets the line every day with his editorial in IL SECOLO. So his 
recent interview marks the end of the cease-fire between the new 
government majority and the chief of state. Its tone gives no 
room for uncertainties, because the National Alliance deputy 
even hints at problems for the president with the judiciary: 
"The fact is that the chief of state enjoys legal immunity only 
with respect to acts performed in the exercise of his duties. 
The Sisde affair, however, does not concern these duties." So 
according to Gasparri, Scalfaro could be accused and tried over 
the scandal of the intelligence service funds. This was made 
clear by MSI member Teodoro Buontempo, known for his plain 
speaking: "Scalfaro must go, because he has everything to lose 
if he remains a prisoner in his own palace." [passage omitted] 
  Former President Francesco Cossiga has sided with Scalfaro: 
"The president's strong intervention [sending a letter to 
Berlusconi] was correct and legitimate. I approve of and agree 
with his action, and he personally enjoys my esteem, my 
friendship, and my support." 
  Senate Speaker Carlo Scognamiglio agrees that he was right: 
"Overall, I judge it a very opportune act at this stage in 
Italy's political life," because the presence of the National 
Alliance "is prompting anxiety" abroad. "The aim was to issue 
as clear and as strong a signal as possible to the international 
community and to the national community on three issues of 
particular importance from the viewpoint of internal and 
international relations."

Minister Andrzej Olechowski had talks in Stockholm with Foreign 
Minister Margaretha af Ugglas. Minister Olechowski pointed out 
that Sweden, in entering the European Union [EU], will open the 
way to that organization for Poland and other Central and East 
European states. In his opinion, if Swedish society votes in 
the November referendum against Sweden's entry into the EU, this 
will probably make it impossible to start negotiations for other 
states to enter -- including Poland. 
  Margaretha af Ugglas stressed that her government was in 
favor of an open Europe and supported the Central and East 
European states' strivings to enter the EU.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Trade With Eastern Europe Continues </F>
To Boom"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- The first quarter of 1994 saw a further 
boom in Austria's trade with Eastern Europe. This was due to 
the economic upswing in Austria and in several other Western 
countries, as well as the economic recovery in some of Austria's 
major trading partners in the East, statistics by the Austrian 
East and South East Europe Institute indicate. 
  For the first time since the mid-1980s, imports from Eastern 
Europe showed a bigger increase than exports, the study says. 
Over the first quarter of 1993, imports rose by 18.5 percent, 
to 11.2 billion Austrian schillings, while exports increased by 
14.3 percent, to 15.2 billion schillings. This also reflects 
the results of the EFTA [European Free Trade Association] 
agreements with Hungary and Poland that came into force in 
autumn last year. These agreements are "asymmetrical," which 
means that the EFTA countries reduce their trade barriers more 
quickly than the Eastern neighbors. In spite of imports picking 
up, the quarterly figures show a new 4 billion schilling record 
surplus in exports. 
  Bilateral trade with Slovakia saw the biggest growth rates. 
Slovakia imported 41 percent more in Austrian products while 
increasing its exports to Austria by 79.5 percent. This also 
means a shift in Austrian trade with the successor states of 
former Czechoslovakia: While in the first quarter of 1993, 
Slovakia accounted for only 22.3 percent of Austrian exports to 
former Czechoslovakia, the figure rose to 25.8 percent this year. 
  Trade with Hungary, Austria's most important trading partner 
in the East, indicates enormous growth rates, following a slight 
decrease in 1993 (exports plus 15.1 percent, imports plus 12.4 
percent). Trade with the Czech Republic continued to expand. 
  The increase in trade with Slovenia was smaller than last 
year (exports plus 8.1 percent, imports plus 10 percent), but 
trade with Croatia, especially exports, continued to increase 
significantly (plus 41.2 percent). Imports from Croatia went up 
by only 16.5 percent. 
  For the first time since the late 1980s, Austrian trade with 
the successor states of the former Soviet Union saw a 
stimulation. Exports to Russia grew by 27.8 percent, exports to 
the CIS went up by 19.7 percent. Total imports from Russia and 
the CIS increased by 22.7 percent.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Future UN Actions Need Clearer </F>
Mandate"] 
  [Text] In a speech on Saturday [14 May] afternoon delivered 
to Vesalius College at the Free University of Brussels, Foreign 
Minister Willy Claes explained the Belgian view of UN 
peacekeeping operations. The minister naturally referred to the 
dramatic outcome of the Belgian participation in the UN 
peacekeeping force in Rwanda. Claes believes that future UN 
missions should be more clearly defined and the Blue Helmets 
should be better armed. 
  After the end of the Cold War, "peacekeeping operations 
seemed to be the answer to all kinds of crises, ranging from 
humanitarian aid situations to the difficult implementation of 
complex peace accords," Claes stated. Hence their 
proliferation. "Peacekeeping operations normally begin 
following previous authorization from all the parties 
concerned," the minister said. "But the Security Council has 
initiated a number of operations without the prior consent of 
all the parties to a conflict." The minister referred to Bosnia 
and Somalia. However, Claes stated that "there was no ambiguity 
in the case of Rwanda: There was a political agreement and both 
parties had given their express assent to the UNAMIR [UN 
Assistance Mission in Rwanda] deployment." 
  The large number of peacekeeping operations is making it 
increasingly difficult for the United Nations to obtain the 
required number of soldiers. Another problem Claes raised was 
the "chronic deficiency of the UN budget for peacekeeping 
operations, due to the failure of a number of member states to 
pay up on time." As a result, it is not certain that it will be 
possible to provide the United Nations with its own standby 
forces. Claes also believes that the UN Secretariat lacks a 
structure with responsibility for military operations. 
  "The feeling at the moment is that the Security Council 
should better assess a peacekeeping operation's chances of 
success within the overall framework of efforts to restore 
peace." The mandate for a peacekeeping operation must, the 
minister believes, be "precise and flexible." He believes it 
must describe the objectives of the operation and must be clear 
regarding the different elements of the mandate, such as the 
disarming of the militia in Somalia. Once defined, the mandate 
of a peacekeeping operation must be correctly implemented. 
<H5>  Rapid Review </H5>
  According to Claes, the United Nations should be able to 
rapidly review the mandate of a peacekeeping operation, when 
necessary. This requires "a serious improvement in 
communications between UN troops in the field and UN 
headquarters." The mandate should also be limited in time. 
With the exception of UN operations under Chapter 7 of the UN 
charter, Blue Helmets may only use their weapons in 
self-defense. This limits the ability to respond to direct 
threats. "I believe we must stop the practice which only allows 
UN soldiers to bear light arms: They must be sufficiently 
equipped, not only with a view to their specific mandate but 
also so that they are able to respond to changed circumstances 
and effectively defend themselves." 
  After the problems encountered by U.S. soldiers during the 
UN 
operation in Somalia and after the death of Belgian Blue Helmets 
in Rwanda, "governments are now going to find it much more 
difficult to win domestic support for participation in 
peacekeeping operations," Claes stated. "This also relates to 
the difficult balance between national responsibilities with 
respect to UN troops and the recognized authority of UN 
commanders in the field. UN commanders must not be hindered by 
the interference of national commanders. On the other hand, 
national governments must remain responsible for assessing the 
safety of their soldiers and must be able to withdraw them." 
Claes said that "although the idea of the United Nations having 
its own force may seem attractive, it is still a long way from 
being realized."

  [Text] Fifty-eight terrorists have been killed in 
operations launched by the security forces in the state of 
emergency region. Two terrorists have been captured in the 
operations. The State of Emergency Governor's Office has issued 
the following statement on the issue: 
  Operations aimed at preventing the activities of the 
militants belonging to the illegal separatist terror 
organization are continuing in the region at large. The 
security forces on 17 May launched an operation in the Bezar 
Mountain region, some 20 km north of Adiyaman, after learning 
that there was a large group of terrorists in that region. 
Twenty-eight terrorists were killed in the operation and their 
weapons were seized. 
  Meanwhile, other operations were also carried out by the 
security forces on 17 and 18 May. Seventeen terrorists were 
killed on the Kato Mountain west of Hakkari, four in the pursuit 
of terrorists who fired at buildings belonging to the security 
forces in central Siirt, three near the Ortabagi village of

  [Text] Ankara, May 17 (A.A.) -- Prime Minister Tansu Ciller 
on Tuesday [17 May] said that the force of the terrorist PKK 
[Workers Party of Kurdistan] organization is dwindling from day 
to day. 
  `As long as terrorism is the biggest problem of the country, 
the fight against terrorism will rank at the top of the agenda,' 
Ciller said. 
  Addressing the True Path Party (DYP) parliamentary group 
meeting, she said that the PKK wants to spread new scenarios to 
the world public opinion, and for this reason defenseless people 
in the southeastern Anatolian region such as women, children and 
senior citizens were forced to migrate to northern Iraq forcibly 
by armed groups. 
  `These people had wanted to move to other regions under the 
security of the state,' she said. `All the world knows the pkk 
is a group of terrorists burning and destroying all the means 
provided by the state to develop that region.' 
  Ciller said she is once again calling on young people and 
their families not to fall into the trap of the terrorists, 
adding the state will continue to fight against the PKK until 
the terror ends. 
  She said the government is also closely following the 
developments in the region. 
  Concerning the Kirkuk-Yumurtalik oil pipeline, she said that 
Turkey is willing to solve the problem with a decision by the 
United Nations. 
  On the Turkish military units to be sent to Bosnia she said 
preparations are in the last stage.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report] </F>
  [Text] Interior Minister Nahit Mentese has said that the 
fight against the separatist terrorist organization PKK [Workers 
Party of Kurdistan] is continuing successfully and added that 
there is a 300 percent increase in the number terrorists who 
surrendered in the first four months of 1994 in comparison to 
the same period last year. 
  In the statement, Mentese explained that the terrorists 
suffered great losses and lost their logistics abilities as a 
result of the determined fight waged against the terrorist 
organization with the intensive support of the people and the 
democratic institutions. Indicating that the terrorists could 
not put up a fight against the fully-equipped, trained, and 
disciplined security forces, Mentese said that the struggle 
became increasingly successful when the logistics support of the 
organization was cut off following the cross-border operations 
into northern Iraq. 
  Mentese stated that 500 terrorists -- 186 terrorists killed, 
four wounded -- were captured in operations conducted against 
the dissipating terrorist organization during 1-15 May. Mentese 
added that 197 long-barreled rifles, 37 revolvers, 386 bombs, 
and large quantities of ammunition were seized during these 
operations. 
  Explaining that collective surrenders, including members in 
high-level positions, were taking place for the first time, 
Mentese stressed that during this period 48 terrorists -- 22 in 
Sirnak and 7 in Agri and Van [as heard] -- surrendered to the 
security forces, handing in their weapons. Mentese said that 
collective surrenders from the terrorist organization's militant 
cadres in the mountainous region are expected to increase. 
  The statement further notes: Nowhere in the world did 
terrorism achieve its goal. The terrorists will not be able to 
reach their goal in our country also. Our state will fully 
control the terrorist organization and render it ineffective, 
thus eradicating it completely from the country's agenda. 
  I am taking this opportunity to call on everybody who joined 
the PKK terrorist organization: Come, trust the state, and 
surrender yourself to its affectionate hands. Take advantage of 
the Law of Repentance and thus attain the right to live as one 
of the respected citizens of this country.

<F P=106> [Report entitled: "Claims About Bombed Villages on Turkish </F>
Parliamentary Agenda"] 
  [Text] Selim Sadaq, pro-Kurdish Democracy Party (DEP) 
deputy from Sirnak, has brought on the parliamentary agenda the 
allegations that villages in the province of Sirnak were bombed 
by war planes on March 25-26 and that 48 people were killed in 
the bombings. 
  In the interrogatory motion he presented on Friday [13 May] 
to the Office of the Parliament Speaker, Sadak asked Interior 
Minister Nahit Mentese to respond to those claims. 
  He said according to the claims of the villagers and local 
sources, the villages of Caglayan and Hisar annexed to the town 
of Cizre, the villages of Kusagili and Beave annexed to the 
Sirnak city center, the village of Kuskonar annexed to the town 
of Guclukonak and the village of Sapaca annexed to the town of 
Uludere town had been bombed by Turkish warplanes. 
  In his motion, Sadak claimed that there were allegations 
that 
48 people had been killed and that the names of all the deceased 
could not be determined due to the migration of the villagers. 
  He listed the names of the people who he claimed were 
identified as having been killed in the bombings as follows: 
  "The village of Kuskonar: Mehmet Benzer (30), Ali Benzer 
(25), Omer Benzer (10), Nurettin Benzer (7), Cicek Benzer (2), 
Ayse Benzer (35), Ayse Benzer (30), Elmas Yiuldirim (50), Serfie 
Yildirim (30), Baharuk Yildirim (13), Melese Yildirim (14), 
Saban Yildirim (4), Mirza Yildirim (2), Cicek Yildirim (2), 
Irfan Yildirim (4), Krem Yildirim (2), Fecire Altan (40), Haci 
Altan (10), Kedin Altan (3), Mahmut Aygur (65), Adil Aygur (18), 
Ayse Aygur (18), Ibrahim Burak (50), Anna Burak (50), Omer 
Kalkan (40). Those who were wounded in this village are 
Suleyman Benzer (4), Rasit Benzer (4), Fatma Benzer (30) and 
Asya Benzer (30). 
  "The village of Kusagili: Serve Kacar (100), Xoxe Kacar 
(60), 
Masallah Kacar (17), Ahmet Kacar (baby), Hasan Kacar (baby), 
Ayse Bengin (60), Nuriye Bengin (14), Fatma Bedir (6), Leyla 
Erdinc (baby), Zahide Kilinc (baby) and an unidentified 
villager. Those who were wounded are Sehristan Kacar, Behiye 
Bengin, Bahar Bengin, Netise Bengin, Halil Aykac, Mehmet Aykac, 
Hatice Bayir, Husnu Kirac, Zulfu Bengin, Cafer Kacar and Bedri 
Ardin." 
  Sadak inquired whether or not Mentese had launched an 
investigation into the bombing incidents which resulted in the 
death of 48 people and the wounding of more than 100. His 
motion contained the following questions: 
  "More than one month has elapsed since the incidents. Has 
your office launched any investigation? 
  "If an investigation has been conducted, have the people who 
suffered from the bombing been interviewed? 
  "Do you agree with the statement that the bombs were dropped 
mistakenly? If you do, do you play to compensate for the 
damages suffered by those people? 
  "If a `deliberate' action led to the massacre or 
`negligence' 
caused the disaster, has anyone been prosecuted or punished? 
  "Do you play to take serious action and enlighten the public 
about this issue? If those who gave instructions to bomb are 
not brought to the surface, it will be very difficult for the 
people to become motivated to be loyal to the administration."

  [Text] Ankara, May 17 (A.A.) -- President Suleyman Demirel 
said today that Turkey had very intensive relations with Iran 
with which it was holding cooperation on Iraq and the PKK 
[Workers Party of Kurdistan] issue. 
  "The foreign ministers of Iran and Turkey meet from time to 
time to discuss the developments in Iraq," he said. 
  He pointed out that there were still a number of PKK 
infiltrators to Turkey from the Iranian border, even though the 
two countries have an excellent cooperation. 
  On the Iraqi-Turkish pipeline which has been closed since 
the 
Gulf War because of an international embargo, Demirel said, 
"Turkey is being treated unjustly. Its losses because of the 
ban is 3 billion to 5 billion U.S. dollars annually. Moreover, 
our pipeline is on the verge of rotting and needs to be filled 
and emptied several times." 
  He stressed that Turkey opposed the division of Iraq and 
that 
Iran wanted the territorial integrity of Iraq to be maintained 
too.

  [Text] President Suleyman Demirel has said that there are 
extremely good relations between Turkey and Iran, and that the 
two countries cooperate in connection with Iraq and the PKK 
[Workers Party of Kurdistan]. He pointed out that the embargo 
on Iraq causes Turkey a loss of $3 to $5 billion annually. He 
stressed that the UN Security Council and the concerned 
countries must show understanding in connection with the oil 
pipeline. 
  The president was replying to reporters' questions at 
Cankaya 
Mansion in connection with press reports that Iranian President 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani offered to carry out a joint intervention to 
end the fighting in north Iraq. Demirel recalled that Turkey 
has close relations with Iran, adding that the two countries 
cooperate regarding both Iraq and the PKK issue. He said the 
ministers of the two countries and officials of their respective 
security organizations meet from time to time to review 
developments. 
  [Begin Demirel recording] There are still PKK members who 
are able to infiltrate into Turkey through Iran. I told 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani's brother, who was here last time, about 
this. It is true, I said, we cooperate very well with Iran, but 
such things are still happening from time to time. So I told 
him to bring me something from Hashemi-Rafsanjani which shows 
Iran's sensitivity about this issue and a reassurance that its 
interest will continue. [end recording] 
  Demirel pointed out that the invitation to visit Iran on 25 
July was reiterated. 
  Asked to comment on the UN debates scheduled for tomorrow in 
connection with the embargo on Iraq, Demirel stressed that 
Turkey's interests necessitate joint action with the world. 
  [Begin Demirel recording] However, a great injustice is 
being done to Turkey. The embargo causes Turkey a loss of $3 
billion to $5 billion annually. Also, the pipeline is corroding. 
It must be filled and emptied a few times. The United Nations 
and the coalition states, especially the United States, France, 
Britain, Germany, and Russia must show understanding. That is 
what we are hoping. [end recording] 
  Demirel stated that Turkey has been stressing the issue for 
more than two years and urging Iraq to do whatever the United 
Nations asks it to do. He stressed that Turkey does not want 
Iraq to be divided. Iran too wants Iraq's territorial integrity 
to be maintained, he added.

Greece trains Kurdish autonomists. Meeting with his Spanish 
counterpart, Golhan said Turkey has been fighting against PKK 
[Workers Party of Kurdistan] activities for the past 10 years. 
He also noted that this party causes damage in Europe by 
carrying out arms and narcotics trade, and said: "Germany and 
France have banned the activities of this organization." 
  The Turkish minister added: "We expect similar behavior from 
other countries. However, this is not done by certain 
neighbors, such as Greece. We have learned, through confessions 
by members of this organization, that certain people are trained 
in that country." 
  Referring to the Cyprus issue, he stressed that Turkey 
supports a solution that would appease both sides.

  [Text] Ankara, May 12 (AA) -- Ankara State Prosecutor 
Nazmi Sarvan on Thursday [12 May] said that an investigation was 
started following the telephone conversation between Prime 
Minister Tansu Ciller and two ministers from her cabinet was 
taped and leaked to the press. 
  He said the investigation will be conducted to determine 
whether there were any premeditations, or whether the 
conversation was heard and taped by chance. 
  Sarvan said that if it was determined that it was 
premeditated, the investigation will be conducted by Ankara 
State Security Court. 
  He said that there have been no initiatives undertaken by 
the 
Prime Minister's Office or the Chief of Staff's Office on the 
issue, adding the State Prosecutor's Office has used its power 
to start the investigation on its own authority. 
  The Turkish Constitution's Resolution No. 132 on crimes 
against the personal identity of the states [as received] and 
No. 195 on crimes on divulging state secrets would be considered 
during the investigation, he said. 
  A scandal broke out last week when a man listened to a 
three-way telephone conversation between Prime Minister Tansu 
Ciller, and two cabinet members. The conversation was recorded 
because one of the ministers was using his phone car. 
  In the conversation Ciller was asking her ministers to make 
necessary arrangements to extend the duty of the chief of staff, 
General Dogan Gures, for another year.

  [Text] Ankara, May 16 (A.A.) -- Turkey obtained important 
financial gains from the F-16 production for Egypt, the Defense 
Ministry said on Monday [16 May]. 
  A ministry secretary told the ANATOLIA Agency that according 
to the agreement signed previously between Egypt and the United 
States, two F-16 planes were manufactured and delivered to Egypt 
by Turkey on April 4. 
  According to the agreement, the planes were inspected by 
Tugas aviation and space industries. 
  The official said that there are no off-set agreements 
signed 
between Egypt and Turkey but that there is a memorandum of 
understanding on cooperation in defense industries between the 
two countries. 
  Turkey will deliver 44 more F-16's to Egypt on June 31, in 
line with the agreement.

  [Text] New British High Commissioner David Madden arrived 
in Cyprus this afternoon to assume his duties. In a statement 
made at Larnaca Airport, he said that the efforts made in the 
Cyprus issue must continue on the basis of the current process 
of the confidence-building measures. David Madden reiterated 
the British view that the confidence-building measures offer a 
great deal to both communities and called on the Turkish Cypriot 
side to realize this position so that the process can continue. 
  The new British high commissioner said that his country will 
continue to encourage the two sides to implement the 
confidence-building measures. On the consultations in Vienna, 
he said he has not yet been fully briefed and that this will be 
his first priority. He also announced that he will be received 
by President Kliridhis on Tuesday [17 May], and that he will 
listen to Mr. Kliridhis' views on the confidence-building 
measures and the prospects for achieving progress.

  [Excerpt] President Glavkos Kliridhis called on Great 
Britain, in its capacity as a permanent member of the UN 
Security Council, to play an active role in considering 
alternative ways to implement the UN resolutions on Cyprus. 
  Speaking at a ceremony for the presentation of the 
credentials of David Madden, the new British high commissioner 
in Cyprus, the president said the provocative defiance of these 
resolutions by the Turkish side is likely to hurt trust in the 
United Nations. President Kliridhis again attributed the lack 
of progress in the Cyprus issue to the lack of political will by 
the Turkish side. 
  Presenting his credentials, the new British high 
commissioner 
stressed that the division of Cyprus has lasted a long time and 
that the British Government desires to see Cyprus converted into 
a successful bicommunal and bizonal federation safe for all 
Cypriots. Madden said his priority will be a Cyprus settlement 
through negotiations between the Greek Cypriot and the Turkish 
Cypriot communities and welcomed the constructive approach 
maintained by the president toward realizing this goal. [passage

  [Text] President Rauf Denktas has said that some progress 
was made during the Vienna talks on the confidence-building 
measures last week. 
  David Madden, Denktas received the new British ambassador to 
Lefkosa [Nicosia], at the presidential palace today. In a 
statement after the one-hour meeting, Denktas said they 
discussed the latest situation in the Cyprus problem and the 
contacts held in Vienna. He pointed out that progress was made 
in Vienna toward eliminating the imbalance in the package. He 
added: We believe that if the Greek Cypriot side agrees to it, 
some progress was made in Vienna. Certain steps were taken to 
eliminate the imbalance in the package. We do not know how the 
Greek Cypriots will react to that. Consequently, the side that 
wants to reach an agreement must help the concerned officials 
restore the balance that existed in the original package. 
  In a statement before the meeting, David Madden pointed out 
that a line of action will be determined about the process 
concerning the confidence-building measures in accordance with 
the contents of the UN report. He pointed out that the UN 
secretary general will draw up his report very likely this week. 
Madden expressed the belief that use can be made of the time 
until the report is published. Therefore, he said, efforts will 
be made and a couple of more meetings can be held within this 
framework.

  [Text] Cyprus has secured credit facilities to the tune of 
$100m under an agreement signed in London this week with a 
consortium of foreign banks. 
  The group is made up of 19 banks from the US, Japan, 
Germany, 
Britain, France, Switzerland, Italy, Luxembourg, Greece, Belgium 
and the Middle East. 
  It was headed by Chase Investment Bank, Commerzbank, Societe 
Generale and Union Bank of Switzerland. 
  Avxendis Avxendiou, Governor of the Central Bank, who signed 
on behalf of the Cyprus Republic, referred to the achievements 
of the island's economy in recent years, the conditions of full 
employment and the relatively low inflation rate, as well as to 
the "comfortable" exchange reserves situation. 
  Chase Manhattan vice-president D. Comnas [name as 
published], 
speaking on behalf of the group, referred to the confidence 
shown by international banks and financial institutions in the 
island's economy. 
  He mentioned in particular the high ratings in 
creditworthiness given to Cyprus by the prestigious "Standard 
&amp; 
Poor's" organisation in the United States.

<F P=106> [Report on news conference by Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel </F>
in Bonn on 18 May -- recorded] 
  [Text] Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, who has now been in 
office for about two years, viewed topical foreign policy issues 
at a news conference in Bonn this morning. He mentioned nearly 
the whole spectrum of German foreign policy, including Germany's 
policy vis-a-vis Africa, the war in the former Yugoslavia, the 
European Union [EU], and the United Nations. He also made it 
clear what a disastrous effect the right-wing extremist violence 
in Germany has abroad. He said he was seriously alarmed when he 
read reports that he received from German embassies abroad. One 
can only be ashamed of Germany's image in the United States, 
Kinkel pointed out. The fact that the blacks were chased 
through the streets made the headlines in New York and 
Washington. 
  The foreign minister also devoted great attention to the 
upcoming German presidency in the EU, which will start on 1 July 
and last six months. Europe continues to be our fate, he 
stated. In fact, quite a few things have been achieved in the 
past few years, he pointed out. The Federal Government has set 
a few priorities for the next six months: Establishing closer 
ties with the Central and East European states and the 
completion of the EU enlargement by the three Nordic states and 
Austria, which will improve the balance in the EU. Thus, he 
mentioned an issue that has caused irritation and annoyance 
among the southern partners and in France. The third priority 
will be the fight against unemployment. 
  In the preparation of the 1996 government conference, it 
will 
be important not to concentrate only on the enlargement but also 
on the deepening of the EU, the foreign minister pointed out. 
The larger the EU becomes, the more difficult it will be. Thus, 
the question should be raised as to whether the troika can 
remain unchanged. The troika consists of the acting, previous, 
and future presidency. Kinkel asked what will happen if the 
troika that represents the EU at the international level 
consists only of small countries, if a smaller and 
internationally not so important country assumes the presidency 
three times in a row. This might have a negative impact on the 
efficiency of the EU. It should be considered whether the large 
countries -- France, Britain, Italy, Spain, and Germany -- 
should assume this office more often. Concerning the filling of 
the commissioner's offices, new ideas are also required. 
  Russia was another topic of Kinkel's news conference. He is 
concerned about a Russia that feels isolated. Russia has become 
much more sensitive in the past few months. Thus, the 
relationship with its leadership, which has to take into 
consideration domestic problems and opponents for the first 
time, has also become more difficult. One must be fully aware 
of this sensitiveness, the minister stressed. However, this 
does not mean granting Russia the right of veto concerning 
relations of the Baltic and Central and East European states 
with the EU, the Western European Union, and NATO. 
  Referring to the United Nations, Kinkel reiterated his view 
that the obstacles in the Basic Law to German participation in 
UN missions must be removed. It is about time for the 
Constitutional Court to give a green light. The current 
situation is unbearable. However, once this step is made, 
Britain and France would no longer object to Germany becoming a 
permanent member of the UN Security Council.

<F P=106> [Interview with Johannes Rau, Social Democratic Party of </F>
Germany presidential candidate, by Michael Jach and Ulrich Reitz 
in Bonn; date not given: "I Would Like To Be a Patriot"] 
  [Text] [FOCUS] Now the Russians are permitted to say 
farewell in Berlin after all. Do you feel that it is good that 
they are treated like the Western allies, to whom we owe a great 
deal? 
  [Rau] I am glad that an agreement was achieved after all. 
However different the experiences with the former occupation 
powers may be -- we must not forget that the Russians paid a 
high toll in the fight against the Nazi empire and also played 
an invaluable role in Germany's unification. Without Gorbachev, 
there would have been no unification. 
  [FOCUS] Does one therefore have to go as far as Manfred 
Stolpe, who is insisting on equal treatment of Russians and 
Western allies? Rudolf Scharping and Guenter Verheugen 
contradicted him. 
  [Rau] I can understand the position of Stolpe and many 
eastern Germans. There is one day in recent German history of 
which we western Germans are far too little aware: 9 October 
1989, when the peaceful revolution in the GDR hung upon a 
thread. At that time, the Russians did not intervene. And he 
who wants partnership and reconciliation in the future has to 
prevent a farewell that has a discriminatory effect on the other. 
  [FOCUS] Was it wrong of the chancellor to envisage a 
farewell ceremony in Weimar -- far away from Berlin? 
  [Rau] It would have been better if the impression of 
discrimination had not been created at all. 
  [FOCUS] The withdrawal of the four powers from Berlin at the 
end of August marks a historic turning point. The beginning of 
German normality. 
  [Rau] Normality only in the sense that we do not take any 
special courses. By no means normality as if we are able to get 
rid of our history. Gustav Heinemann said: "If we want the 
others to forget what we did to them, we must not forget." 
  [FOCUS] The fact that the Nazi past is not supposed to pass, 
results in the Germans' neurotic relationship with the nation: 
Some take shelter in self-abnegation, some in arrogance. 
Neither of the two alternatives is historical thinking. 
  [Rau] I agree with you. But not only Richard von 
Weizsaecker made it clear that we have to deal with the burden 
of German history in a special way. Theodor Heuss rejected 
bitterly the concept of collective guilt, but he said: There is 
collective shame. Today there is the danger of offsetting: 
liberation against expulsion; harm that we did to others 
against harm that was done to us. This would be unhistorical 
thinking. It is important to consider the whole of German 
history. We cannot choose the dates. A few days after the U.S. 
President's visit to Germany, we will remember 20 July 1944. 
Those who recall resistance also have to talk of adaptation, 
which resulted in the suppression of this resistance for such a 
long time. 
  [FOCUS] Why is the national feeling not so natural for the 
Germans as for the French? 
  [Rau] The French national consciousness is based on French 
history and ours on German history. With a view to the past 100 
years, it will have to be a more broken one. 
  [FOCUS] One can buy the Danish flag in Danish supermarkets. 
In German supermarkets one will look for the black-red-gold 
cloth in vain. Is this also a sign of brokenness? 
  [Rau] If you do not get a German flag in the supermarket, 
you will get one from me. 
  [FOCUS] The fear that the Germans are drifting to the right 
is centered around the concepts of nation, German identity, 
normality. Is this a real danger? 
  [Rau] It is not greater than in other nations. However, we 
Germans must have higher inhibition thresholds because we know 
what was caused by extremism, nationalism, and insufficient 
democracy. The Weimar Republic was not ruined by too many 
extremists, but because there were not enough democrats. The 
reference to Le Pen in France must not play down extremist 
currents in our country. 
  [FOCUS] Are we facing a situation as in 1920, when leftist 
and rightist extremists began to put the screws on the big 
democratic parties and to paralyze them? 
  [Rau] No, I do not see a parallel here. In 1920 the Germans 
were still unskilled democrats. Now we have practiced and 
learned democracy for 50 years -- and it has proved to be very 
stable. First, of course, many adopted democracy only because it 
was connected with economic and social benefits. 
  In a time without growth like now, forces that are hostile 
to 
democracy may become stronger. This is not a danger for the 
democratic state, however, but a challenge for the democrats. 
  [FOCUS] Is the GNP discarded as a reason of state? What 
holds the Germans together? 
  [Rau] We must see to it that the GNP is not the only 
cohesive force. A nation is always also a community of history, 
experiences, and culture. 
  [FOCUS] Also a protection community? 
  [Rau] Also that. But in Germany it is constituted by the 
diversity of temperaments and regions. I feel that it is an 
enrichment that there are Saxons, Thuringians, Bavarians, 
Rhinelanders, and Westphalians. Everyone goes his own way and 
yet he knows: It is the same direction. 
  [FOCUS] Does the constitution belong to the cohesive forces? 
  [Rau] Clearly yes. 
  [FOCUS] What do you make of the concept of constitutional 
patriotism? 
  [Rau] I think that it is right what Gustav Heinemann said: 
Our Basic Law is not a tie, but a great offer. The decisive 
point of our constitution is the first sentence: The dignity of 
man -- any man -- is inviolable. It is given to the state, and 
the state is not to define and assign dignity. 
  [FOCUS] Cordt Schnibben wrote: "People who are national 
without becoming nationalist must be suspiciously watched like 
anonymous alcoholics who claim that they only want to drink a 
small glass." Are the Germans in danger of becoming addicted? 
  [Rau] Apparently some Germans, but not the majority. 
  [FOCUS] Wolfgang Schaeuble? 
  [Rau] At any rate, some are pursuing the game with the 
nationalist idea. They disregard the fact that the division 
between national and nationalist is very thin and the tightrope 
walk is very dangerous. A nationalist is someone who despises 
the motherland. A patriot is someone who loves his motherland. 
I would like to be a patriot. 
  [FOCUS] The German nationality law of 1913 defines the 
nation as a community of origin that is determined by blood. Is 
this way of thinking still up to date? 
  [Rau] At any rate, it is not the only democratic way. There 
are several democracies that are going another way. In view of 
the high immigration rate of the past decades, we as Germans 
should come to an understanding of the citizen that is no longer 
based on ethnicity alone. 
  [FOCUS] Is there a tolerance limit to immigration? Does one 
have to establish criteria that determine which people from 
which culture areas one wants to invite? 
  [Rau] One cannot choose that. The economic, ecological, and 
political causes of flight resulted in migration movements of 
such an extent that no humane state can completely insulate 
itself. One has to distinguish between asylum and immigration 
law. In the asylum compromise in which I participated, I am 
missing an immigration policy that takes worldwide causes of 
flight into account. The following is right: The integration 
capability ends where we become the scene of substitute civil 
wars. 
  [FOCUS] Can you specify your ideas of an immigration law? 
  [Rau] At any rate, I do not want a Canadian or U.S. law -- 
that is, a law that is mainly determined by the economic 
usefulness of the immigrants. We need an immigration law that 
is connected with our services for the refugees' countries of 
origin. We need another refugee policy. The task is not to 
combat the refugees, but the causes of flight. 
  [FOCUS] Let us talk of the integration of the foreigners who 
have lived in our country for a prolonged period of time. Are 
they to be given dual citizenship? 
  [Rau] It can be an offer, so that people who have lived in 
our country for a long time and want it can find a home here. I 
am convinced of that. 
  [FOCUS] Do you not see a contradiction between integration 
-- which would mean naturalization -- and dual citizenship that 
releases the foreigner from the decision on where he will 
integrate? 
  [Rau] I am prepared to accept this contradiction in 
well-grounded cases. There is an abundance of people who need 
the dual citizenship for different reasons, but do not get it. 
The reasons for objection do not convince me. 
  [FOCUS] Should foreigners who decide against naturalization 
be sent home again after a certain period? 
  [Rau] I think that this idea is just as new as it is 
useless. 
In this way, we would revise a practice of more than 30 years 
that is in the interest of all.

<F P=106> [`bb'-attributed report: "Concentration on Asian-Pacific </F>
Region"] 
  [Text] Canberra -- This year's annual general meeting of 
the German-Australian Chamber of Trade and Industry in Canberra 
served as an illustration of the German rediscovery of Australia 
and the Pacific region and the consequent intensification of 
relations between Germany and the antipodean continent. 
  After three years in office, Hugh Morgan, managing director 
of the Western Mining Corporation, left the chairmanship of the 
Chamber. His place was taken by John Ralph, one of the most 
prominent Australian captains of industry. He is managing 
director of Conzinc Riotinto of Australia and president of the 
influential Business Council of Australia. The meeting mainly 
discussed Australia's role as a springboard for Asia, as a 
location for branch offices of German enterprises, and as a 
partner in trilateral cooperation. 
  "The Asia-Pacific Conference in Bangkok has provided 
positive 
signals that German industry and the German Government are at 
last devoting proper attention to this region of economic 
growth," explained Bernd Schlickum, chairman of the Chamber's 
board of management. "Australia is clearly recognized as a part 
of this region. Sixty percent of its exports have already gone 
to Asian countries." 
  The presence of Senator Bob McMullan, Australian minister of 
trade, served to underline the importance that the Australian 
Labor Government attaches to Germany's involvement in Australia. 
"The relations between our countries have expanded considerably 
over the past few years," said the minister. "Today, one notes 
a shift in the balance of economic power. Despite our 
concentration on the Asia-Pacific region, we shall not turn our 
back on Europe," he promised. 
  McMullan was particularly pleased by the fact that German 
enterprises are establishing regional offices on the fifth 
continent. With a level of investments exceeding 6.4 billion 
Australian dollars (7.6 billion German marks), Germany is in 
third position regarding the size of investments by EU [European 
Union] countries in Australia. Franz Keil, German ambassador in 
Canberra, said the difficulty lies in encouraging smaller German 
enterprises to embark on the long road to Asia. Keil said the 
German Embassy would do more to help establish contacts between 
German and Australian enterprises. 
  Heinrich Zimmermann, managing director of the Chamber, made 
it clear that an intensification of the Chamber's economic 
functions is essential if only because of the fact that Germany 
has curtailed subsidies for foreign trade chambers. "In the 
future, the trade chambers must concentrate on profit-bearing 
activity, adapt their services to the new situation, and at the 
same time undertake harsh cost-saving measures," said Zimmermann. 
  Continuing with his business report, Zimmermann said that 
German firms' search for representatives or importers in 
Australia has increased. "But many German companies still seem 
oblivious to the fact that such half-hearted attempts to 
establish contacts offer only limited prospects of success," he 
said. "Obviously they do not want to avail themselves of the 
expert services of the chamber of trade, such as market analyses 
and the finding of suitable partners, because these services 
cost money." 
  In 1994, trade between Australia and Germany rose by 12 
percent. In 1992-93, 5 to 7 percent of Australia's imports came 
from Germany, so that Germany occupies fourth place among 
Australia's most important supplier countries.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Federal Interior Minister Manfred 
Kanther (Christian Democratic Union) has strongly criticized the 
decision by the federal states of Rhineland-Palatinate and 
Schleswig-Holstein, which are governed by the Social Democratic 
Party [SPD], to halt the deportation of Kurds for the next six 
months. This "change in policy" is "politically completely 
unacceptable", Kanther said in Bonn on Wednesday [18 May]. The 
SPD is "obliged for the sake of social peace within Germany" to 
continue to put the asylum compromise agreement of 1993 into 
practice. 
  Kanther warned that the behavior of Rhineland-Palatinate and 
Schleswig-Holstein is "really an invitation to illegal 
immigration". 
  The impression is being created in the countries of origin 
that the German asylum procedure is "meaningless because 
deportation will not be carried out anyway." The interior 
minister said it is "quite clear" that the Kurds are not 
threatened "with persecution in most areas of Turkey." The 
Federal Administrative Court has confirmed the possibility of 
finding safe havens within Turkey itself.

  [Text] Kiel (DDP/ADN) -- Schleswig-Holstein is the first 
German state to introduce a halt to deportations for Kurds. 
Interior Minister Hans-Peter Bull accompanied the announcement 
of today's decision by the state government with an appeal to 
all other states to follow this example in view of the dramatic 
increase in human rights violations in Turkey. As the situation 
was not expected to change quickly, Bull also urged German 
Interior Minister Manfred Kanther "to rapidly grant approval for 
a more long-term halt to deportations." The German Government 
must also push for the observance of human rights in Turkey, 
Bull said. 
  The state government's halt to deportations, which is to 
last 
six months, is based on a provision of the law governing 
foreigners under which the Interior Ministry can take this 
action for a maximum of six months if this is imperative for 
reasons relating to international law or on humanitarian 
grounds. The measure is restricted to Kurds from the emergency 
provinces in southeast Turkey and applies only to asylum-seekers 
who are pursuing their case in Schleswig-Holstein. 
  Bull explicitly referred to remarks by German Foreign 
Minister Klaus Kinkel that the human rights situation in Turkey 
is "not satisfactory." He also referred to information from the 
prisoner aid organization, Amnesty International, that the 
Turkish Government is reported to have announced a major 
offensive to destroy the Kurdistan Workers' Party.

  [Excerpt] Hannover (DDP/ADN) -- Lower Saxony Interior 
Minister Gerhard Glogowski has announced a halt to the 
deportation of Kurds from his federal state to Turkey. Should 
the heads of the regional governments fail to decide tomorrow on 
a collective halt to deportation, Lower Saxony will act 
unilaterally, Glogowski told the Lower Saxony Landtag today. 
The interior minister assured the Landtag that at the moment no 
one is being sent from Lower Saxony to face death or torture. 
  In his speech, the text of which was released in advance, 
Glogowski stressed that no Kurds will be deported from Lower 
Saxony until the prime ministers' decision. The interior 
minister criticized the fact that weapons are again being 
supplied to Turkey, despite its being well-known that the 
Turkish Army uses them against the Kurds. The minister spoke of 
a war of extermination against the Kurds in Turkey. He called 
on Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel to take a firm stand to bring 
the murder in Turkey to an end. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["tl" report: "SPD Wants To Reduce German Contribution to </F>
European Union"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 16 May -- The Social Democratic Party of 
Germany [SPD] wants to reduce Germany's net contribution to the 
European Union [EU]. This plan is part of a 10-point 
declaration, which was presented by SPD federal and land experts 
for financial matters yesterday. 
  A fairer distribution of the contributions must be ensured 
in 
the European Union, the SPD's financial program says. Since 
Germany has fallen from second to seventh place on the European 
scale of prosperity after unification, in particular the returns 
from Brussels to the new laender are to be increased. To 
"prevent" Germany's payments to Brussels "from continuing to 
skyrocket," strict budget discipline must be ensured in the EU, 
in the SPD's view. Within the framework of a reform of the EU 
budget, the SPD also wants to check which fields need to be 
regulated at the EU level in the first place. 
  With these proposals the SPD financial experts go even 
beyond 
the plans by FRG Finance Minister Theo Waigel (Christian Social 
Union [CSU]), who has also come out in favor of reducing the 
German net contribution to the EU. Furthermore, the 10-point 
declaration of the SPD budget experts, which was presented by 
SPD Deputy Chairman Oskar Lafontaine and North Rhine-Westphalian 
Finance Minister Heinz Schleusser yesterday, contains harsh 
criticism of the Federal Government's budget policy. Over the 
past years the government has decided tax increases of about 115 
billion German marks per year. With the SPD there will not be 
any further increase in the tax quota, the statement says. 
Lafontaine accused the CSU/CDU [Christian Democratic Union] and 
the FDP [Free Democratic Party] of planning four tax increases: 
raising value-added tax, property tax, and petroleum tax, as 
well as introducing highway tolls. Lafontaine underpinned this 
by citing statements by top politicians of the coalition, which 
were however partly denied or retracted.

<F P=106> [`mes'-signed report: "Scharping Defends Himself Against </F>
Criticism From Industry"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- A public row on future economic and 
financial policy has suddenly deteriorated relations between 
leading industrial associations and the Social Democratic Party 
of Germany [SPD]. While SPD chairman Rudolf Scharping 
criticized the German Confederation of Trade and Industry's 
[DIHT] "biased support" for the ruling government coalition, the 
Association of German Industry [BDI] criticized the SPD's 
government plans, claiming that they are geared to a 
redistribution of funds. 
  Industry's criticism of the SPD program coincides with the 
publication of the results of new surveys showing that more 
people think Helmut Kohl will win the October elections than 
they did a few weeks ago. SPD general manager Guenter Verheugen 
said that the SPD leadership rejects the industrial criticism, 
based on false assumptions, as a "massive biased interference" 
on Kohl's behalf. Vorheugen "urgently" called on the industrial 
associations to be more restrained and "not interfere in the 
election campaign in such a way." 
  Scharping revealed a five-page letter he had written to DIHT 
Chairman Hans Peter Stihl, rejecting the criticism Stihl had 
expressed one week ago and asking him "for the sake of future 
cooperation to be so kind as to restrict his criticism of SPD 
resolutions to those resolutions which the SPD has actually 
adopted." Among other things, Stihl had said that Scharping's 
appointment as chancellor would have a negative effect on 
economic development and employment, as illustrated by the SPD's 
plans for taxation and energy policy. 
  In his letter to Stihl, Scharping reminded him that during 
mutual talks, the SPD leadership and the DIHT had agreed that 
the only way to solve the economic difficulties was gradually to 
overcome the problem of unemployment. The SPD, said Scharping, 
has recognized this need and drawn clear conclusions. For 
instance, it has resolved that taxation cannot exceed the level 
planned for 1995. All the expenditures foreseen in the SPD 
program are strictly dependent on the size of funds, said 
Scharping, who also promised that the SPD would attach priority 
to a reduction in wage-related costs on account of the 
competitiveness of enterprises. 
  Further in this letter to Stihl, Scharping dismissed Stihl's 
opinion that the SPD's plan to impose greater tax on family 
firms and increase capital gains tax would lead to the 
liquidation of entire businesses. He also rejected the claim 
that the SPD was trying to impose the costs of German unity on 
one-fifth of the population. 
  Apart from the DIHT, BDI General Manager Ludolf Georg von 
Wartenberg and employers' confederation chief Klaus Murmann also 
criticized the SPD plans. Wartenberg said the SPD was too 
concerned about a redistribution of funds, and Murmann charged 
the SPD with failing to explain how it intended to finance its 
expenditures.

<F P=106> [Report by Ulrich Rosenbaum: "A Disappointed Rudolf </F>
Scharping"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- Whenever over the past few weeks a large 
number of black limousines pulled up in front of the "Haribo 
Villa" in Bonn's Godesberger Allee, former home of gummi bear 
manufacturer Hans Riegel, one could be sure that SPD [Social 
Democratic Party of Germany] chief Rudolf Scharping was meeting 
top German industrialists. 
  Just like other SPD chancellor candidates before him, 
Scharping values the confidential "tete-a-tete talks" at the 
Political Club of the Friedrich Ebert Foundation. Everyone of 
any importance among German entrepreneurs on account of name, 
rank, and turnover, attends these talks. No wonder Scharping 
was upset when Hans Peter Stihl criticized the SPD's economic 
program. "But we showed you what we wanted just as we showed 
other leading German industrial personalities," said Scharping 
in a letter to Hans Peter Stihl, chairman of the Association of 
German Trade and Industry [DIHT] 
  For Stihl was also a participant in the confidential talks. 
There were further rounds of talks with the industrial 
associations, the Employers Association, the Automobile Industry 
Association, and the Chemical Industry Association. On the SPD 
side, regular participants included Scharping's economic and 
financial expert, Oskar Lafontaine, and other members of the 
Program Commission, as well as experts from the SPD faction. 
  "We had the impression that the gentlemen from industry were 
positively impressed by the changes in SPD policy, away from 
thinking in terms of a welfare state toward more growth, 
employment, and a labor market," recalls one participant in the 
talks. Someone had said that the SPD did not want to increase 
the tax burden, but nevertheless it was important to limit the 
supplementary levy to higher incomes to boost domestic demand. 
"We also told Herr Stihl that we do not want to burden smaller 
entrepreneurs with bigger taxes," it was said. But this is 
exactly what the DIHT chairman is accusing the SPD of wanting to 
do. 
  The interlocutors did not hide their disappointment with the 
government's policies, especially those of the economics 
minister. The industrial representatives thanked Lafontaine for 
preserving the regressive tax levy in the Bundesrat. 
Representatives of the German industrial associations 
complained that the chancellor was displaying excessive euphoria 
about the economic upturn. These cozy tete-a-tete talks are now 
being followed by criticism from the DIHT and the German 
industrial associations. 
  Inside the SPD, people remember a saying by former Minister 
Karl Schiller whereby the highest accolade the SPD can expect 
from industry is a lack of criticism of the SPD.

  [Text] Heidelberg (DDP/ADN) -- Chancellor Helmut Kohl said 
he is confident that the outstanding economic and social 
problems in eastern Germany can be resolved. The most important 
thing now is "to live in the spirit of common solidarity", Kohl 
said today at the opening of the new offices of a German 
research center in Heidelberg. Then one will have the strength, 
"to successfully get through the second great beginning for the 
second great stage of our republic." 
  The chancellor reiterated that spring brings with it a "new 
upswing in Germany." Order books are filling up again. Kohl 
pointed out that economic research institutes are expecting 
growth of 1.5 percent in Germany this year and show the carping 
critics that they are wrong. 
  The chancellor urged progress instead of stalling with 
regard 
to structural changes in the interest of Germany's future as a 
business and investment location. "A rethink instead of a 
redistribution" is necessary.

<F P=106> [Interview with Horst Eylmann, German CDU justice expert, by </F>
Andrea Tarquini in Bonn; date not given: "Instant Trials for 
Nazis"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- President von Weizsaecker's appeal and 
the new laws promised by Chancellor Kohl will not remain just 
words: Germany is taking action against neo-Nazis. One of those 
responsible for hunting foreigners in Magdeburg was slapped with 
an arrest warrant and other, similar provisions are being 
examined. The severe criticism leveled by the head of state and 
the chancellor encouraged dozens of citizens from the ancient 
city in eastern Germany to come forward and testify, thus making 
it possible to identify the neo-Nazis. The publication of laws 
which increase sentences for xenophobic violence is imminent: 
On Wednesday [18 May], the extraordinary meeting of the Justice 
Commission will conclude its work, and on Friday this work is to 
be examined in the Bundestag. 
  While Chancellor Kohl's party yesterday confirmed that 
it "severely" condemns Nazi violence, we talked to Horst 
Eylmann, a prominent member of the CDU [Christian Democratic 
Union] and chairman of the Justice Commission. He is the father 
of the package of laws aimed at stopping fascist subversion. 
  [Tarquini] Mr. Eylmann, what are the priorities in the 
struggle against the neo-Nazis? 
  [Eylmann] It is of the utmost importance that we punish 
xenophobic violence by the extreme Right with the greatest 
speed. Effective deterrents are needed. All too often, the 
trial procedure is slow. The guarantees provided by the law 
cannot be extended to such a point that they become an advantage 
for the enemies of that state. We want to toughen up the 
sentences for injury from three to five years, lengthen custody 
for those caught in the act up to a week, and make it possible 
to hold summary trials. 
  [Tarquini] Do you think that your proposals will be passed? 
  [Eylmann] There is a good chance that the Bundestag will 
approve them in its plenary session on Friday. 
  [Tarquini] How important is the struggle against extreme 
right-wingers? 
  [Eylmann] The state must do its duty. We have not forgotten 
the memories which any act of Nazi violence evokes among our 
neighbors. Preventing a repetition of Magdeburg is also of 
crucial importance for our image in the world. However, the 
state intervenes when the crimes have already been committed. 
Schools, too, must do more to explain to young people what the 
ideas of the radical right have brought to our country and to 
the world. We have underestimated the sway which these 
ideologies can hold in society, seducing ignorant and 
marginalized young people who are suspicious of the state: both 
here and in other countries. 
  [Tarquini] Would the entry of a postfascist or neofascist 
party into the majority in Italy encourage the extreme Right in 
Europe? 
  [Eylmann] I do not know if your neofascists can be compared 
to our violent ultrafascists. You can judge that better than I. 
Of course, I would not rule out the Republikaner taking 
advantage of the events in Italy during their election campaign. 
They will say that if that happened in your country then it can 
happen in Germany. However, they would be a mistake: I do not 
think that they will get into parliament. 
  [Tarquini] Why not? 
  [Eylmann] Because neo-Nazi violence distances voters from 
them, and because no German party is, or ever will be, prepared 
to be part of a coalition with the radical Right. They will not 
enter the inner sanctum of politics. 
  [Tarquini] How much influence will the fight against 
neo-Nazis have in the election campaign? 
  [Eylmann] It will have an influence, of course, but I think 
that the parties would be well advised not to exchange 
accusations on this matter. Rather they should stand together 
in rejecting the ideas of the extreme right. The required 
consensus already exists among the democratic parties. 
  [Tarquini] How do you explain this difference between 
Germany 
and the European countries where the Right is entering the inner 
sanctum of politics? 
  [Eylmann] We are still living with the trauma of the 
suffering which Nazism inflicted on the world and which made us 
suffer, too. Here in Germany, all it took was a film like 
"Schindler's List" to revive the shock and to make many young 
people understand what really happened. It provoked a 
collective emotional response from those who try to play down 
and forget the past. 
  [Tarquini] [Italian National Alliance leader] Fini called 
Mussolini the greatest statesman of the century. What do you 
say about that? 
  [Eylmann] That is an irresponsible view.

<F P=106> [Report by Alexander Wendt and Robert Vernier: "Wooing for </F>
Red Socks"] 
  [Text] Wolfgang Kurzweg has little liking for the 
"blessings of the western community of values": "Robbery, 
violence, and fraud," the chairman of the Brandenburg 
Republikaner preaches, have swamped the former GDR. Saxony's 
Republikaner chief Guenter Bernard added his comments on market 
economy: "A system of money and crooks." 
  Franz Schoenhuber, federal chairman of the right-wing 
extremist Republikaner, is sending his men to catch votes in the 
east with anticapitalist statements. The targets are the 
typical losers in the change: people over 50, whom unification 
deprived of their jobs and their firm view of the world. Old 
cadres are supposed to build the bridges for the right-wing 
extremists. 
  Saxony's Republikaner chief Bernard is using familiar 
vocabulary in his efforts. In the time of the GDR the professor 
of sociology taught in the "Scientific Communism" section in 
Leipzig and kept his colleagues toeing the party line as party 
secretary of the SED [Socialist Unity Party of Germany]. 
  Brandenburg's Wolfgang Kurzweg was also an SED official. The 
professor was the head of the central Animal Hygiene Institute 
in Eberswalde -- there party membership was compulsory. 
Kurzweg's career as a Republikaner was controlled by the 
headquarters in Bonn. "A high-ranking member of the party 
leadership" asked him to take over the land chairmanship. "They 
saw that I had experience with administration and leadership." 
And good connections with the clients. In the east, 
Schoenhuber is wooing the same potential voters as the Party of 
Democratic Socialism: "People who do not agree with 
reunification as it is," as Kurzweg describes them. 
  Schoenhuber has been wooing party cadres and National 
People's Army [NVA] soldiers right from the beginning of his 
expansion toward the east, "where many things have remained more 
German than in the satiated and gluttonous west." SED Professor 
Kurzweg is helped by his deputy, NVA Colonel Hermann Flemming. 
  In Saxony, Republikaner chief Bernard is proud of the former 
NVA officers, who now serve in the Bundeswehr. With great 
pleasure Berlin's Republikaner chairman Werner Mueller, a former 
government official of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, 
also points "to several former GDR officers." Schoenhuber's 
troop in Thuringia is headed by former SED official Goetz 
Rudloff. 
  Schoenhuber's wooing of the red socks has had little result. 
The comrades in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania are now 
investigating Land Manager Juergen Zedler, who is suspected of 
having cooperated with the Stasi. Only 3,440 of the 24,000 
Republikaner members come from the new laender. And in Leipzig 
the red-brown socks may not even run for local elections: They 
did not get the 360 signatures necessary.

  [Text] There is an alarming report by the Federal Office 
of Criminal Investigations [BKA]: "Organized crime has 
established itself in Germany." 
  From 1991 to 1993, trials involving organized crime doubled 
from 369 to 776; at the same time, the number of suspects rose 
from 5,149 to 9,884 -- with a proportion of foreigners of 54.5 
percent. In addition to drugs, the BKA registered increasing 
activities by gangs smuggling people but also concerning 
"illegal disposal of hazardous waste." 
  In 50 percent of the cases of organized crime, the gangs are 
nowadays conducting their business via German cover companies. 
The overall damage caused in 1993: almost 2 billion German 
marks.

<F P=106> ["ban"-attributed report: "Kanther Calls For Tougher Laws"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn, 16 May -- Interior Minister Manfred Kanther 
(Christian Democratic Union) stated on Monday [16 May] that the 
"1994 law on the fight against crime," drafted by the coalition, 
contains measures against criminals like those who are 
responsible for the riots in Magdeburg. Kanther condemned the 
attacks by racist skinheads on foreigners last week. They are a 
"shame" for the country. However, the interior minister 
refrained from criticizing the work of the police in Magdeburg 
on Monday. President Richard von Weizsaecker stated during the 
weekend that he does not understand why the criminals who were 
detained in Magdeburg were released again immediately. 
  Kanther pointed out that the draft of the coalition on 
internal security is designed to accelerate legal proceedings 
with conclusive evidence. According to domestic-policy experts 
among the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union 
[CDU/CSU] and the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP], the 
so-called summary proceedings will be used both in the fight 
against violent crime and for the "extension of the reason for 
detention because of the danger of recurrence." Kanther 
announced that the law on custody will be more effective in the 
future. The legal rules on incitement to hatred and violence 
against segments of the population and on instigation of racial 
hatred will be expanded. The use of Nazi symbols will be 
punishable. The law on bodily injury will be tightened. The 
first and third reading of the draft law will take place at the 
Bundestag on Friday. In a speech at the Konrad Adenauer 
Foundation in St. Augustin near Bonn, Kanther described internal 
security as a precondition for freedom and internal peace. 
There is no easy solution in the fight against crime, he 
emphasized. New forms of crime must be combated with additional 
legal rules. Kanther regretted the fact the package of the 
coalition does not include the CDU/CSU demand for the permission 
to tap private residences in the fight against organized crime. 
"I regret that, but I hope that the coalition partner will one 
day see the need for this measure." Kanther stated that the 
government and the coalition are making efforts to adopt a new 
law on the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation and to amend 
the law on the Federal Border Police before the end of the 
legislative period. The cabinet approved the draft last week. 
However, there are doubts among the coalition that there will 
be enough time before the Bundestag elections to comprehensively 
amend the legal basis of the Federal Office of Criminal 
Investigation. 
  Kanther announced that the "preconditions for practical 
cooperation among the security authorities" should be improved 
during the German presidency of the European Union in the second 
half of 1994. Europe's integration must not have the effect 
"that borders fall for the criminals but continue to exist for 
the investigating authorities," Kanther pointed out. If border 
controls are eliminated, compensatory measures must be adopted. 
Otherwise there is the danger that "new obstacles" are being 
created at the borders of the national states. Cooperation with 
the police in the East European states must be improved. It 
must primarily be designed to enhance the fight against 
organized crime, drug trafficking, and car thefts. Smugglers of 
refugees are to be treated in the same way as drug dealers 
because "they are driving other people into misery because of 
pure greed for profit," Kanther stressed.

<F P=106> [Peter Seidlitz commentary: "Beijing Does Not Let Itself Be </F>
Dictated To"] 
  [Text] The United States has maneuvered itself into a dead 
end in its policy toward China. Having come under the pressure 
of the large corporations, President Clinton feels forced to 
renew the most-favored-nation (MFN) clause before 3 June. The 
White House is now desperately looking for a face-saving 
formula, because last year Clinton made the renewal of the MFN 
dependent on a generally improved situation of human rights in 
China and Tibet. 
<H5>  The Situation of the Dissidents Has Not Changed </H5>
  Not only in the WASHINGTON POST can Clinton read that the 
actual situation in China has not changed. The usual cynical 
game is being played with the dissidents. Political dissidents, 
people who think differently, and intellectuals who are too bold 
are subjected to the arbitrary actions of the Chinese security 
organs. Recently adopted new laws, which can be interpreted in 
various ways, give the police a wide leeway for action. Some 
leading dissidents have been arrested or deported. 
  With a view to the fifth anniversary of the bloody clearing 
out of Tiananmen Square by the military, CPC General Secretary 
Jiang Zemin said that the development has shown that the actions 
taken on 4 June 1989 were right. This is to be understood as a 
warning to the dissident scene. The government is trying to 
tighten the screws again. Stricter control of the media and the 
film industry has been put into motion. Newscasts such as the 
BBC World News, which are very popular in China, have been 
switched off. Journalists, particularly from Hong Kong, have 
been sufficiently intimidated by deportations and trials. 
  The obvious impatience with which U.S. companies are pushing 
into the Chinese market, which is now opening up, brings 
problems of argumentation for the U.S. Administration in 
Washington. In an analysis, which has been leaked, Winston 
Lord, who was U.S. ambassador to Beijing until 1989 and is now a 
high-ranking State Department official, confirmed the mistakes 
of the policy of coupling the MFN clause to human rights, even 
though it was Lord, deeply disappointed and personally affected 
after 1989, who had advised Clinton to pursue this policy. 
  The Chinese are watching the confusing game of the Americans 
with some amusement. It is not the government in Beijing but 
the Administration in Washington that is under self-inflicted 
pressure, in particular since for some time ordering a different 
treatment of state companies and joint ventures in granting 
trade preferences was even considered in the U.S. capital. Such 
a policy cannot be implemented in administrative terms at all 
and is pointless, because it has been proved that working 
conditions in joint-venture factories of businessmen from 
Guangzhou and Taiwan in southern China are often much worse than 
those in state companies, where things are inefficient but at 
least relatively socially acceptable. 
  For Clinton the policy toward China is only one aspect of a 
policy without contours toward Asia. At the summit in Seattle 
in November 1993 he had classified the importance of the 
Asia-Pacific region as being greater than that of relations with 
Europe. In the meantime he has ended up in a clinch with the 
Japanese; a war of words is under way with Singapore; Indonesia 
has forbidden U.S. interference in trade union issues; and 
Malaysia is keeping its cool distance. The people in Washington 
are now learning that dealing with the old partners in Europe is 
easier than with Japanese, Chinese, and other Asians. 
<H5>  Honesty in Washington Would Be Refreshing </H5>
  Under pressure from Congressional and Senate circles, 
Clinton 
is now in the unpleasant situation of having to slap China's 
fingers without annoying the U.S. business world. One out of 
seven planes produced by Boeing are nowadays sold to China. 
U.S. banks and securities companies are smelling big business, 
and many products in U.S. shopping centers would become more 
expensive if the customs preferences were abolished. In view of 
this helpless situation, honesty would be refreshing. 
Washington should admit that quite definite economic interests 
are determining its policy toward China.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Alexis Papakhelas from Washington] </F>
  [Text] U.S. President Bill Clinton's government has 
actively intervened in the mediation efforts for Skopje by 
promoting an overall package solution and the name "North 
Macedonia." U.S. Presidential Envoy Matthew Nimetz has presented 
the U.S. package of "new ideas" to both sides. Nimetz is also 
trying to convince the Greek community's leadership on the need 
to compromise, and to focus on the name "North Macedonia." 
  U.S. officials said that President Clinton asked Prime 
Minister Andreas Papandreou, during their recent telephone 
conversation, to study seriously the U.S. proposals. According 
to the same officials, Papandreou agreed to submit a reasonable 
alternative solution. The White House has taken the Greek prime 
minister's promise very seriously and believes that it is 
possible to reach a compromise by June. 
  President Clinton's close associate George Stephanopoulos 
told private station MEGA that (during their telephone 
conversation) Clinton "encouraged Papandreou to proceed with a 
swift solution to the problem." Stephanopoulos stressed that 
"the United States has submitted some new ideas and is now 
waiting for the Greek proposals." He added: "The United States 
believes the more comprehensive a solution is, the better." 
  UN mediator Cyrus Vance met Ambassador Khristos Zakharakis, 
the Foreign Ministry secretary general, in New York yesterday. 
According to reliable information, Vance is trying to determine 
Greece's real intentions on the name issue. In the first phase, 
concerning Skopje's name, he tried to determine whether the 
Greek side would prefer a geographical or a national definition 
before the term "Macedonia." Diplomatic observers believe Vance 
considers the solution of a composite name as a given, but has 
abandoned the term "Nova Majedonia" because he knows that it has 
been identified with negotiations of former Prime Minister 
Konstandinos Mitsotakis' government. 
  The same observers appear pessimistic about the outcome of 
the New York talks. They note that both sides may accept the 
principle of a "package solution," but point out that it would 
be very difficult to agree on a compromise solution on the name 
issue.

  [Text] Referring to UN mediator Cyrus Vance's meeting with 
Ambassador Khristos Zakharakis, the Foreign Ministry secretary 
general, government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos today said 
that Greece remains firm on its positions on Skopje. 
  A short while ago, correspondent Dhimitrios Filios reported 
from New York that the talks were suspended, and will resume 
after the European Parliament elections. Filios is on the line: 
  [Filios] About half an hour ago, George Sills, the UN 
secretary general's spokesman, issued a statement at UN 
Headquarters. He distributed a written statement by Vance on 
Skopje that says over the past few days detailed talks with both 
sides were held and views were exchanged. The statement adds 
that the talks were suspended today and will resume in New York 
at foreign ministerial level on or around 13 June. 
  There are two characteristic points of these talks: One, 
that the proposals submitted were discussed by the various 
sides, including Vance and U.S. Presidential Envoy Matthew 
Nimetz. Nimetz participated in all recent talks. 
  The other is the date that the talks will resume at foreign 
ministerial level. Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias, not 
Ambassador Zakharakis, will represent Greece, and Skopjean 
Foreign Minister Stevo Crvenkovski will represent Skopje.

  [Excerpt] Madrid--Deputy Foreign Minister Yeoryios 
Papandreou was interviewed on Skopje [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] by the Spanish newspaper ABC. 
According to the MACEDONIAN NEWS AGENCY, Papandreou said that 
"he is not very sure of the outcome of the economic measures 
against Skopje," but added that there is new movement 
surrounding these negotiations. He expressed the hope that this 
could result in a solution to the problem. 
  According to the MACEDONIAN NEWS AGENCY, the deputy foreign 
minister expressed the hope "that a way to break the impasse of 
the talks will be found." He added: "For now, we are proposing 
a package of measures to strengthen mutual trust and to 
reexamine the name issue." Another point, Papandreou said, is 
that Greece is not afraid that it may be led to a military clash 
with Skopje. He stressed, however, that a clash with any side 
could cause war to spread. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Athens, May 18 (AFP)--A blast wrecked the third 
floor offices of US computer giant IBM in a building in central 
Athens Tuesday evening [17 May], but no injuries were reported, 
police said. 
  A caller who said he was from the November 17 extremist 
group 
phoned a commercial radio station to give a warning a few 
minutes before the blast in the Sindagma building. 
  He said November 17 were going to fire a rocket at the 
building, although police could not immediately establish that a 
rocket had caused the blast. 
  Police cordoned off the entire area, which includes the 
Greek 
parliament and the new European parliament headquarters. 
  November 17 has assassinated more than 20 people and carried 
out around 50 bomb or rocket attacks since it surfaced in 1975 
with the murder of US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Athens 
station chief Richard Welch.

  [Text] The 17 November organization hit the IBM offices 
eight minutes after midnight with two 2.6-inch-caliber antitank 
rockets. The offices are on the corner of Filellinon and 
Dhedhalos Streets near Sintagma Square in the capital's center. 
The explosions caused only material damage. A homemade 
launcher, consisting of a tripod and a metallic pipe, was found 
in a building across from the offices. A few minutes before the 
attack, an unidentified person telephoned SKY radio warning 
about the strike and claiming responsibility in the name of 17 
November.

    [Editorial Report] The results of a poll conducted by the 
Project Research Consulting firm in the First and Second 
Districts of Athens from 8 to 16 April among a randomly chosen 
group of 500 individuals were reported in the 30 April-1 May 
Athens KIRIAKATIKI ELEVTHEROTIPIA. Respondents were asked to 
express their preference for Athens mayor in a future mayoralty 
race. A majority of them chose former Eurodeputy and present 
Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) Deputy Vaso Papandreou. 
Among PASOK voters, Papandreou obtained 52.1 percent, while 55.8 
percent of New Democracy (ND) voters believe that her candidacy 
would be favorable for PASOK. Papandreou's candidacy is also 
viewed favorably by 50.9 percent of Communist Party (KKE) 
supporters and 40.1 percent of Coalition of the Left for 
Progress voters. PASOK voters also gave 26.9 percent to former 
Athens Mayor Dhimitris Beis and 9.3 percent to deputy Minister 
of Transportation Athanasios Tsouras. When asked who would be 
the best ND candidate, respondents gave first place to former 
Coalition leader Maria Dhamanaki (21.8 percent), followed by ND 
luminary Dhimitris Avramopoulos (18.3 percent), Mayor Leonidhas 
Kouris (11.8 percent), and ND deputy Dora Bakoyianni (8.6 
percent). 
  Respondents in the First District, the ND's traditionally 
best voting area, were also asked their voting preference for 
the European Parliament elections. According to poll results, 
PASOK gathered 31.7 percent; if the percentage of undecided 
voters were added to this figure, the total for PASOK would be 
around 35-36 percent. The ND gathered 36.9 percent, compared to 
the 42.75 percent it obtained in last October's parliamentary 
elections, and it is estimated it could reach 40-41 percent. 
Again in the First District, Political Spring obtained 7.9 
percent, compared to 6.4 percent last October, and is expected 
to achieve a showing of 8.5-9 percent. The Left's percentages 
remained more or less stable. Coalition gathered 5.8 percent, 
compared to 6.4 percent in October, and is expected to be around 
6.5 percent. The KKE obtained 4.96 percent, versus its past 4.6 
percent, with the prospect of reaching 5 percent.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams by reporter </F>
Jon Snow; Adams in Belfast, Snow in London, on 16 May; Adams' 
remarks spoken by an actor; from the "Channel 4 News" program -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Snow] Are you encouraged that the British 
Government would respond to your questions on Anglo-Irish 
Declaration, but with comments? 
  [Adams] Well, I think it is gratifying that for five months 
we were told that clarification wasn't necessary, that it was a 
matter of take it or leave it, and now we are being told -- yes 
there are issues that need clarifying, there are questions to 
deal with, core issues. I do think on a personal level that the 
British response was a little bit childish, a little bit 
begrudging. I mean the real test would be in the answers that 
they supply which need to be comprehensive, which need to be 
honest. We are not dealing with clarification here as a matter 
of formality, we're dealing with getting comprehensive, honest, 
and unambiguous responses to detailed questions. 
  [Snow] What is the prize if you get the clarification you 
seek? 
  [Adams] We are engaged in a peace process. I mean, there 
aren't any quick fixes. Our response is dictated to a large 
degree by what the British Government's clarifications and 
elaborations are. 
  [Snow] Could be as strong as to say -- yes a permanent 
cessation of violence is on my agenda under the right 
circumstances? 
  [Adams] Well it was on my agenda from the very beginning. 
When John Hume and I kick-started the whole peace process, an 
end, a cessation, a complete stop to all armed action by the 
IRA, by the British, by the loyalists was quite clearly on my 
agenda. That's part of a peace settlement. We have to persuade 
people engaged in armed actions to give up those actions, to be 
part of a process, and that's why I said at the beginning of 
this interview -- peace requires change and we have to move the 
whole position forward -- the British Government responding in a 
comprehensive way, engaging in the peace process. Providing 
clarification allows the whole business, the whole search for 
peace to move forward. I hope it would lead to cessation of 
armed actions by those engaged in armed actions, but I'm not 
going to raise expectations to have them dashed again. I want 
to move forward building the bricks on which a solid foundation 
for lasting peace can be established, and it's important also 
that we want a lasting peace, we want a durable peace, we want a 
peace settlement. 
  [Snow] All right then, what are you holding out to the 
British people as something that they can cling on to? What is 
the best expectation that we could see? Are you talking in 
terms of weeks, months, years? 
  [Adams] Well, I don't know, I have always said that we are 
into the conflict resolution phase of this struggle. I don't 
know how long that phase is going to take. I want it to be as 
short as possible, I want people around me, all the people of 
this country and the people of Britain who deserve peace as much 
as the people in Ireland to have a normal, political life, to 
have a society which is just. So we are definitely in the final 
phase. There will be unforeseen obstacles in the way. There 
will be difficulties. It will be dangerous and risky. How long 
will it take -- I don't know. The sooner and the shorter the 
better.

  [Excerpts] The Libyan foreign minister visited Paris twice 
during this current month. [passage omitted]. A report by 
Laurent Bazin, Eric Bourbotte, and David Cosset: 
  However official it might be, the visit smacks of heresy. 
Twice in less than a week, the Libyan foreign minister spent a 
few happy days in Paris, staying at the glamorous Hotel de 
Crillon. The first time [Libyan Foreign Minister] 'Umar 
al-Muntasir stopped in Paris was when he was on his way to South 
Africa. The second time, for a longer period, was on his return 
from South Africa. The long weekend was organized by his old 
friend, Adnan al-Khashoggi, a Saudi businessman who specializes 
in all kinds of transactions between the West and Arab 
countries. [passage omitted] 
  No official contact with al-Muntasir was made, the French 
Foreign Ministry stressed, but there was no reason to ban the 
visit: 
  [Begin Juppe recording] He is the foreign minister of a 
country with which France has not severed its diplomatic 
relations. When he asked us to travel via Paris, as was the 
case today, I don't see on what basis we could refuse the 
stopover. [end recording] 
  After a rest, the Libyan minister returned to Tripoli via 
Tunis.

  [Excerpts] A Libyan in Paris: The rumor went round Paris 
this morning and it was correct. The Libyan foreign minister 
did visit the capital last weekend. His presence has surprised 
and saddened the families of the casualties of the terrible bomb 
attack against the UTA DC-10. Philippe Boisserie reports: 
  [Boisserie] [passage omitted] For [Foreign Minister] Alain 
Juppe, there is nothing abnormal about this visit: 
  [Begin recording] [Juppe] [Words indistinct] not at all 
sudden, it has been his 10th or 15th visit over the last three 
or four years. I would like things to be clear. What is all 
this about? France has an extremely firm position -- perhaps 
the most firm position among all Western countries -- concerning 
the sanctions against Libya. 
  [Boisserie] What did he come for then? Do you know? 
  [Juppe] You will have to ask him, I did not see him. [end 
recording] 
  [Boisserie] The Quai d'Orsay [Foreign Ministry] added that 
it 
was merely a private stopover on his way back from South Africa, 
that there were no official contacts. However, among those 
taking part in the trip was someone who is not insignificant and 
who is of interest to Judge Bruguieres: The lawyer of the four 
Libyans whose extradition to France he has been demanding in 
vain. For the families of the casualties, this is too much.

that he was unaware of the visit to Paris last weekend by the 
Libyan foreign minister. The visit has provoked reaction since, 
as is probably known, there is a serious dispute between France

<F P=106> [Report by Anne Fulda: "Balladur Supports Baudis on His </F>
Home Ground"] 
  [Excerpts] For his first meeting after the presentation of 
the full RPR-UDF [Rally for the Republic-French Democratic 
Union] majority list last Monday, Dominique Baudis assembled a 
fine team in his home city of Toulouse yesterday evening. 
Appearing as an American-style star was the prime minister, who 
had hitherto observed an expedient silence, having his ministers 
say that this European campaign is a "party matter," a 
"Giscard-Chirac" list, in short. 
  Edouard Balladur, who had forbidden members of his 
government 
to be candidates in the European elections, was to make the 
journey with four ministers from his "inner circle:" Philippe 
Douste-Blazy, the Centrist responsible for health alongside 
Simone Veil, but also Industry Minister Gerard Longuet, who had 
made no secret of his preference for Jean-Francois Deniau to 
head the UDF-RPR union list, and [Research Minister] Francois 
Fillon and [Environment Minister] Michel Barnier. 
  Similarly, the arrival in Toulouse of 19 RPR fellow list 
members was expected, including Helene Carrere d'Encausse, 
number two on the list, and 23 UDF candidates. 
  This learned assembly's aim in this first big meeting was to 
encourage the city's son, the "little one" as he is nicknamed in 
Toulouse. He is a list leader who preferred to keep his mandate 
as mayor of Toulouse but resign from the National Assembly to be 
able to take his seat in the European Parliament and who, for 
his part, was to uphold once again his concept of a "strong" 
Europe which regains "its protective role." 
  As for the prime minister, he was speaking yesterday for the 
first time in the European election campaign after saying very 
little in the cantonal elections. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  The Prime Minister's Statements </H5>
  "The institutional reforms will change Europe's face. We 
must prepare for that. The French Government and the French 
European deputies will have to work in close cooperation on 
these fundamental questions. Together, we will have to 
strengthen France's role in Europe, defend France's interests, 
and assert our concept of Europe, not a federal concept but a 
new concept -- a union of states which pool some of their 
abilities, must be unanimous in their most important decisions, 
and also keep their sovereignty.... 
  "Europe's situation has also changed since 1989. 
  "In the economic sphere, the main factor is the serious 
crisis which all the member states have experienced, the most 
serious in 20 years, which has resulted in the increase in 
unemployment. 
  "Europe seems weakened: While America was returning to 
growth, Europe was only recording mediocre results. The member 
states are now suffering from high public deficits. 
  "The monetary crises have presented the threat of a 
dismantling of the EMS [European Monetary System] and, in some 
sectors, have produced distortions of competition. 
  "We must be aware that these problems have undermined the 
European idea among the public. All too often, Europe has 
become synonymous with impotence (against unemployment and in 
the Bosnian tragedy) and bureaucracy, with inability to 
guarantee peace, with ridiculous attacks on national identity by 
Community regulations felt to be pointless and annoying. 
  "Does the European idea still have a future? Yes, more than 
ever. We are here to bear witness to it.... 
  "Expansion is inevitable. It is also desirable provided 
preparations are made for it. Of course, this move will take 
time. We must help the states of Central and East Europe by 
clarifying the future for them.... 
  "The European nations grouped within the Union, which have 
become more numerous, will have to adopt a more democratic joint 
way of functioning. 
  "Indeed, distrust of Europe is fueled by the feeling that 
decisions are not made at the political level, in other words by 
those who are elected and answerable to the people. We need a 
more democratic Europe.... 
  "It is necessary for the citizens of each country to feel 
closer to the decisionmaking process. It is in this way that we 
will popularize the European idea, and not in any other way. 
The French no longer accept the fait accompli, and they are 
right not to do so. 
  "In a way, it is a calling into question of 30-year old 
methods. The problems are new, they require new solutions.... 
  "A more democratic Europe will be able to develop its 
ambitions and apply them to the spheres in which it can be 
useful: security, control of immigration, and the fight against 
organized crime, and drug trafficking. European cooperation 
will be focused on better security for the citizens of every 
country.... 
  "We were behind a unique prevention effort, the Pact for 
Stability, which will be launched at a conference in Paris in 10 
days. Its aim is to encourage the Central and East European 
countries to sign among themselves agreements on good neighborly 
relations. It is a difficult and huge task, but it is our duty 
and in our interest to do all we can to ensure that this effort 
succeeds. It is also a "European" task. The Community was 
built immediately after the war to overcome long-standing 
divisions and hatreds. It succeeded and consolidated peace.... 
  "Economically, France needs the European market, provided it 
is organized. Its enterprises enjoy greater competitiveness. 
They need a market of the dimension of the one which their 
American or Japanese competitors enjoy.... 
  "We must also more effectively defend ourselves against the 
rest of the world. The GATT negotiations in 1993 showed that, 
when it was united and determined, Europe could see its ideas 
triumph. This is an example to be followed. Our deputies will, 
I am sure, strive to remember this and guarantee a better 
protection of Europe, a defense of its interests which is not 
inferior to the defense of the interests of other areas in the 
world.... 
  "France's problems are serious, we know the concerns of all. 
The French people would not forgive us for political divisions 
which made us lose sight of what is essential: devoting all our 
efforts to our country's recovery."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Mr. Monory Agrees With Mr. </F>
Mitterrand on Nuclear Test Moratorium"] 
  [Excerpts] Senate Speaker Rene Monory (UDF-CDS [French 
Democratic Union-Social Democratic Center]) thinks that the idea 
of a referendum on employment launched by Philippe Seguin (RPR 
[Rally for the Republic]), his National Assembly counterpart, is 
"too simple." Mr. Monory, who was the guest on the Radio-J 
"Forum" program on Sunday, 15 May, said: "Employment deserves 
more than passing comments. It requires a series of measures. 
We must stop indulging in demagoguery and controversy.... I 
think that the majority and opposition should not taunt each 
other with each other's failures." The Senate speaker hopes 
that the presidential election will provide the opportunity "for 
a great debate" on this employment question. "Otherwise, we 
will be heading for decline," he said. [passage omitted] 
  Questioned on the disagreement between the prime minister 
and 
the president of the Republic on the question of the moratorium 
on nuclear tests, Mr. Monory expressed the view that this 
controversy is "rather pointless" because "our decision," he 
said, "is determined more than ever by the attitude of our big 
partners." Taking up the argument used by Francois Mitterrand 
during his 10 May television speech, he added: "It is true that 
if the others do not resume the tests, we will not resume them; 
and if the others do resume them, we will resume them." 
  On the question of the European elections, the Senate 
speaker, who had supported Dominique Baudis as candidate to head 
the UDF-RPR list, thinks that "35 percent" would be "a good 
score."

<F P=106> [Report by Klaus C. Engelen: "The Balladur Government Is </F>
Resolutely Reducing the Influence of the State"] 
  [Text] Paris, 14-15 May -- In an interview with 
HANDELSBLATT, French Economics and Finance Minister Edmond G. 
Alphandery said that at the next G-7 summit in Naples in several 
weeks, Russia, being the "greatest challenge of our time," will 
be the dominant topic. In his view, the medium-term strategy to 
restore stable economic growth that Germany and France have 
jointly pursued since the monetary crisis of August last year, 
has been successful. 
  He said the new joint course between Bonn and Paris, which 
is 
aimed at stability and growth, has increasingly proved to be an 
important cyclical pillar for Europe and the world. His 
counterpart, Theo Waigel, is seeking a real growth for Germany 
of 1.5 percent. The French Government is expecting a real 
growth rate of 1.4 percent in 1994. These are "the stages of a 
German-French conversion program that are strictly being 
observed." The program -- with budget consolidation as its core 
-- was jointly presented and defended in Paris on 3 August last 
year, and was subsequently also expounded before the Council of 
Economic and Finance Ministers in Brussels. 
<H5>  Colbert Has Been Dead for Many Years </H5>
  When the Balladur government took over government 
responsibility in April 1993, "the French economy was in the 
most serious postwar recession, with a reduction in overall 
economic output of 1.2 percent in real terms in the preceding 
six months and short-term interest rates of almost 11 percent in 
nominal terms and 8 percent in real terms," says Alphandery. 
  The recovery in the German economy will also help France 
achieve the much higher growth rate of 2.7 percent in real terms 
fixed for 1995. According to Alphandery, economic recovery in 
France is attributable to various factors. In the second half 
of last year, exports improved by 4 percent. This year, 
industrial investment has increased between 3 and 4 percent, 
whereas in 1993, it decreased 15 percent. From July 1993 to 
January 1994, construction increased 40 percent. This year, 
between 30 and 40 percent more cars have so far been sold than 
last year. Short-term interest rates, which are less than 6 
percent, have reached the lowest level in 20 years. Since the 
monetary crisis in the summer of 1993, the business barometer of 
French entrepreneurs has increased by 70 points. 
  The image of French industry and banks being dominated by 
the 
state -- an image that still prevails in Germany and the 
Anglo-Saxon countries -- must be drastically revised. The 
economics and finance minister, who is assessed as a liberal and 
conservative politician, stresses that "Colbert has been dead in 
France for a very, very long time." 
  First, a look at the privatization that the Balladur 
government has carried out is sufficient to put the facts right. 
In the past six months, the government implemented 
privatization projects totalling 100 billion French francs 
(almost 30 billion German marks). In view of the widely 
ramified holdings -- meaning secondary and tertiary 
privatization effects of former state-run concerns -- which are 
included in privatization, the state's influence at various 
levels of the French economic sector has been reduced. "Judging 
by the vehement criticism voiced by the Socialists, they have 
realized how successfully we have set the course in the 
direction of privatization." 
  Second, the high capital influx to France indicates the 
country's continuous attractiveness for foreign investors. This 
could hardly be compatible "with a strangulating governmental 
influence." In 1992, Great Britain and France shared the top 
place among Western industrial nations. 
  Third, analysts would be surprised if they compared the 
assets controlled by foreigners -- as measured by GNP. Neither 
Germany nor the United States, and even less so Japan, "could 
cite as high a share held by foreigners as France, which is open 
and must remain open." 
  As in many other areas of international and European 
policy, "France and Germany are pulling together on the great 
task of supporting Russia in transition to democracy and the 
market economy." According to Alphandery, this is of crucial 
importance in the G7 and on the European stage. However, the 
French minister left it open whether the formal step to the 
"G-8" -- including Russia as another member in the club of the 
economically powerful countries -- could already be made at the 
summit in Naples. At the Naples summit, the heads of state and 
heads of government would also discuss in detail the labor 
market problems in the Western industrialized states, on the 
basis of the recommendations given at the Detroit employment 
summit. In this respect, Alphandery is amazingly optimistic: 
"Just as France must do more to overcome high youth 
unemployment, Germany continues to be confronted with the 
serious structural problems on the labor market in the new 
laender. I am optimistic that France and Germany will jointly 
master their specific structural weaknesses in the next few 
years through higher economic growth and a certain amount of 
flexibility and innovation." 
<H5>  Bundesbank and Bonn Offended </H5>
  Alphandery, who has been in office for about a year, had a 
really unfortunate start, in particular in the relationship with 
Germany. By making awkward remarks on "planned steps to lower 
interest rates, that were coordinated with the Bundesbank," 
Balladur's new man for the Finance Ministry provoked sharp 
protests from the Bundesbank and his Bonn counterpart, Theo 
Waigel, and the unusual cancellation of a German-French meeting. 
After that, Alphandery made himself suspicious because he "had 
not been invited" to take part in crucial talks held by Waigel 
and Balladur at a critical stage during the European monetary 
turmoil early in August last year. Asked about his "wrong 
start," Alphandery reacts calmly: "I think there are many 
misunderstandings that I am eventually planning to clarify in a 
book. What is important, however, is that this period is over. 
We, Waigel and I, with the support of Larosiere (the former 
president of the Banque de France) and Trichet (chief of the 
Treasury), did a very good job in August. We made the right 
decision by widening the bands in the European Monetary System. 
I coordinated the measure closely with Balladur. We had a long 
talk in the Matignon on Sunday morning. Subsequently, we had 
difficult negotiations in the afternoon and evening."

growth rate forecast. Three indicators are encouraging. First 
of all, there is the European Commission's decision to raise its 
projected growth rate for France. The Commission had only 
credited us with a mere 1 percent this year. Today, it 
anticipates a 1.6- percent increase in France's GDP. According 
to this forecast, we should do better than our German and 
Italian neighbors this year, and reach a 2.8-percent growth rate 
in 1995, a performance better than Great Britain's. Mention 
must also be made of the manufacturing industry's index, which 
rose by 2.2 percent in the first two months of the year. To be 
sure, measures taken last January have given a boost to the car 
industry. But things have improved in all other sectors as 
well. Last, the third encouraging indicator is the fact that 
the economy as a whole has started creating new jobs: 20,000 in 
the first quarter, which is more than expected. We had only 
expected such results to occur during this years's second 
quarter. Furthermore, the service sector has created 53,000 
jobs. And this is the sector in which progress is likely to be 
the strongest. 
  [Potriquet] So will you revise official figures soon? 
  [Alphandery] We do not change our figures on a daily basis. 
Our new projections will be elaborated this summer as part of 
the 1995 budget exercise. 
  [Potriquet] Economists did not expect a very moderate growth 
to have any positive impact on employment. However, recent 
figures show an improvement. What is it that has changed in the 
French economy? 
  [Alphandery] A major factor early this year were the 
measures taken by Edouard Balladur in favor of the car industry, 
which were based on our proposals. We achieved our objective as 
those measures had the intended impact. Should we be satisfied 
with this in a country that still has 3.5 million unemployed? 
Obviously not. All we have achieved so far is two out of three 
goals. The first one is a substantial decline in the rate of 
increase in unemployment. Currently, the average monthly 
increase is only 4,000 to 5,000. The second goal is getting the 
economy to start creating jobs again. This is where we now 
stand. However, we shall only reach our objective when the 
curve reverses, that is when net new job figures are enough to 
absorb the natural increase of the active population, an 
increase estimated to be 120,000 persons this year. What is 
encouraging is that activity is likely to increase while 
cyclical unemployment should decline. Moreover, we note that 
structural measures taken in the spring of 1993 have begun 
producing their intended impact: qualification contracts, 
employer-supported apprenticeship contracts, lower charges on 
unskilled labor, etc. 
  [Potriquet] Will such evidence of recovery make you abandon 
any further support measure this year? 
  [Alphandery] The government remains highly attentive to 
economic activity. Again, we are headed in the right direction. 
We need to look at this performance in the European context. 
Two days ago, for example, the Bundesbank lowered its discount 
rate to 4.5 percent. 
  Pressure is being decreased with care being taken not to 
harm 
monetary stability, which is all in our economies' interest. 
But is not this also a consequence of a "French-style," 
recovery-oriented economic policy, initiated by Edouard 
Balladur? This policy consists of three components. First, 
renewed confidence through gradual restoration of economic and 
social equilibrium. 
  Second, savings consolidation, which funds economic recovery 
through increased short-term savings. 
  This was the goal of the various measures taken to redirect 
funds invested in monetary open-end funds toward private 
housing, and to support economic activity through the bond 
issues and privatization, which have already brought in 95 
billion francs over 10 months. 
  The third component is a series of temporary measures meant 
to stimulate the real estate market last year, and the car 
industry in January 1994. 
  [Potriquet] Will there be more stimulating measures this 
year? 
  [Alphandery] In the current situation, we have every reason 
to be confident that the French economy's outlook is good. 
  However, we remain pragmatic and attentive. When you have 
had your head under the hood every day in order to get the 
economic engine running again, it is quite stimulating when 
first results begin to appear.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "My Ministers Will Give All Necessary </F>
Assurances to the President"] 
  [Text] Rome -- "Relations between me and the president are 
excellent, they have always been good, we fully cooperate, we 
are constantly in touch." Thus [Prime Minister] Silvio 
Berlusconi tried to minimize the story of the letter he had 
received from the head of state inviting him to guarantee that 
all the ministers in his cabinet would comply with institutional 
rules. In an interview with GR [Radio News] Director Livio 
Zanetti, the prime minister also denied that Scalfaro had named 
any of the ministers in particular. Scalfaro's concern, 
according to Berlusconi, stemmed from "the possible inclusion in 
the ministers' list of personalities who may have given rise to 
reservations being expressed by a certain section of the press 
and, particularly, by a certain section of the international 
press." Berlusconi further explained: "I believe that the 
ministers' list has provided the president with the assurances 
that he requested from me." 
  The prime minister then denied the existence of a "[Judge] 
Di 
Pietro case," following the news of contacts having taken place 
-- while the government was in the process of being formed -- 
between himself and the most famous Clean Hands public 
prosecutor. "I kept on reading in the press," Berlusconi said, 
"about offers that were actually never made, about negotiations 
and talks that had never taken place. I therefore decided to 
check the situation personally with Di Pietro." "We had a 
friendly, straightforward, honest, pleasant meeting, and that 
was it. In my view," he added, "Di Pietro did well to decide to 
continue the work that he had started and that he is currently 
carrying out." 
  As for the government's next moves in the economic field, 
Berlusconi said that he did not have a "magic wand," but that he 
would be aiming, in particular, to revive the public works 
sector and to reform the tax system. Concerning foreign policy, 
he stressed that his government would not change European policy 
in any respect: "We are staunch Europeanists," he asserted. 
  Finally, having been asked what he intended to do with RAI 
[Italian Broadcasting Corporation], he replied: "I will watch 
it and listen to it."

<F P=106> [Interview with National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini by </F>
Alessandro Caprettini in Rome on 14 May: "The Confidence Vote? 
It Is Not a Problem"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Caprettini] Confidence or 
elections. Some people who were members of the fascist team 
have said this be a matter of alternatives. 
  [Fini] No, it is a matter of clearness, as opposed to those 
who are dreaming about the existence of other majorities. It is 
also the clearest reply to [Italian Popular Party, PPI, member] 
De Mita who hopes to be able to get up to his games again. 
  [Caprettini] Secretary, what do you think of De Mita's idea 
of opposing the government just to form another one, considering 
that the PPI does not want to hear about an agreement with Forza 
Italia and that there are not sufficient numbers for an 
alternative? 
  [Fini] They want to show that they exist. However, they are 
continuing to reason with the methods of the First Republic. 
They put personal interests before those of the nation. They 
are not at all worried about the possibility of losing precious 
time to form a new executive body. It is the oldest and most 
decrepit Christian Democrat who is coming back to peer in. 
  [Caprettini] Secretary, there are some points about the 
negotiations with the government that are still obscure. Maroni 
[Northern League] at the Interior Ministry, for example. You 
opposed him, then...perhaps you convinced him to nominate 
Gaspari [of the AN] as undersecretary? 
  [Fini] It would be bad for the government if the 
undersecretaries were given mandates to control the ministers. 
No, the story is simple. I had expressed political perplexity. 
However, on the one hand, I am convinced that either I gave 
them a free rein or the government would not have been formed, 
and, on the other hand, I obtained clarification from Bossi and 
Berlusconi. 
  [Caprettini] Another little mystery is the veto on 
Tremaglia. 
Who gave it? 
  [Fini] I do not know. He has been personally wronged and we 
have been the subject of a considerable political wrong. So 
much so that I obtained the commitment of the majority to 
entrust Tremaglia with the presidency of the Foreign Affairs 
Committee in the Chamber of Deputies. 
  [Caprettini] And will he accept? 
  [Fini] I think so. He is not one of those gentlemen of 
before -- I am talking about the PPI members -- who put personal 
interests before those of the country. 
  [Caprettini] The final unresolved mystery is Di Pietro. 
First of all, is it true that you proposed him? 
  [Fini] No, it is true that I said that I was greatly in 
favor 
of his participation of the government. 
  [Caprettini] Who is responsible for his renunciation? 
  [Fini] This is still a little mysterious for me too. From 
what was understood, Di Pietro was not insensitive to the 
proposal. Then a veto fell. Who gave it? I do not know, 
perhaps [Chief Prosecutor] Borrelli. 
  [Caprettini] Are you worried about the accusations that 
continue to come from abroad about the presence of neofascist 
ministers in the Italian Government? 
  [Fini] Not at all. They will be forgotten in a month. There 
are the European elections. You will see that after 12 June 
this story of bogies that is being stirred up by the European 
politicians of the Left will end. Then there will be other 
occasions to show how things stand. There is the G-7 summit. 
There are the EC ministerial meetings. 
  [Caprettini] Are you satisfied with what you have obtained 
in 
the government? Or do you feel a bit like a spare wheel? 
  [Fini] I do not have worries of this type, and I am 
satisfied 
with five important ministries. 
  [Caprettini] However, there have been some grumbles within 
the party. Buontempo says that it is necessary to think about 
splitting the MSI [Italian Social Movement] and the AN. 
  [Fini] Buontempo is an objector by nature. Criticisms? Let 
them be made, I have no wish to strangle the internal debate. 
However, I think that the press is more interested in these 
subjects than my party is. 
  [Caprettini] What do you think of the government's program? 
  [Fini] It is good. It is very realistic and therefore 
viable. 
  [Caprettini] Will you manage to obtain the confidence of the 
Senate? 
  [Fini] Yes, we will...also because it is clear that if there 
is no majority we will have elections. Wait and see, at the 
crucial moment many of our adversaries will leave for coffee!

of the sovereign people, and he has not lost the habit of 
dreaming up new governmental alliances which, unlike those of 
the government of Silvio Berlusconi, belong to the partyocracy 
of the First Republic." 
  This was how Gianfranco Fini chose to comment on the veto 
made against Berlusconi by Mancino and by the Italian Popular 
Party [PPI], which had asked the prime minister to "modify the 
political picture" by dropping the National Alliance and forming 
a new ruling alliance with "the Democratic Alliance and the PPI."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Segni: `If Silvio Falls, Try </F>
Someone Else'"] 
  [Text] Rome -- Who will succeed if the Berlusconi 
government fails to pass the Senate? For Pact for Italy leader 
Mario Segni, the present prime minister will have to hand over 
the reins. "Nowhere is it written," he reasons, "that it is 
necessarily Silvio Berlusconi who has to form the government. 
In the majority of the Right, which has won and which should 
provide the prime minister, there are other individuals and, 
hence, other possible governments." 
  "It is absurd to call new elections if the government 
falls," 
Segni went on to warn, even venturing to suggest a possibly 
benevolent attitude of his group toward a new government "headed 
by a different person and who would not pose the serious 
problems of incompatibility (as posed by Berlusconi), and who 
would not promote exponents of a Right which is discredited in 
Europe." 
  Senator Francesco Cossiga gave a more articulate forecast. 
"If the government fails to pass the Senate," the former 
president of the Republic stated, "resignation will be 
necessary" for Berlusconi, who will have to hand over "to the 
person whom we have to get used to seeing as the head of the 
opposition, that is PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] leader 
Occhetto." If the PDS too fails to win a vote of confidence, 
for Cossiga this would open the way to the formation of a 
"government of national unity, with a short program and led by 
an individual acceptable to both Left and Right, or a government 
which would take the country into the elections." This last 
possibility, for the former head of state, should not be 
"absolutely dramatized, because in the system which we have 
chosen early dissolution is a built-in part of the mechanism 
when the majority expressed by the people does not function." 
  "I hope that the Senate will find the votes, because -- 
[Interior] Minister Roberto Maroni states bluntly -- who will 
take on the responsibility of bringing down the government, to 
which there is no alternative, whatever Segni says. He knows 
that the only alternative is new elections." But new elections, 
in the opinion of the new interior minister, would be an 
unpopular step, which people would not understand. "From all 
sides, including those who voted progressive, I sense a desire, 
" Maroni confesses, "to get the government started off in order 
to then assess its actions. Everyone's real wish is for 
governability."

<F P=106> [Interview with Pact for Italy leader Mario Segni by Fabio </F>
Inwinkl in Rome; date not given: "Segni: I Am Turning Down the 
Popular Party; It Will Split Up" -- first paragraph is L'UNITA 
introduction] 
  [Text] We meet Mario Segni in the Largo del Nazareno 
offices that, in quite a different scenario, had been the 
headquarters of the referendum movement. He has just sent Rocco 
Buttiglione [Italian Popular Party, PPI] a letter expressing 
concurrence as regards strategy for the next few years: "All we 
have to do is follow through what we have already been doing." 
The overtures to "the pope's philosopher" come on the eve of a 
conference announced by the secessionists from the Pact 
(Michelini, the newly appointed Minister Tremonti, and former 
magistrate Stajano), who also share Buttiglione's position. 
They were also preceded by a heartfelt appeal the day before 
from Gerardo Bianco, who called for a joining of forces with 
Segni, starting with the European election campaign. 
  [Inwinkl] What is your reply to the former DC [Christian 
Democratic Party] floor leader? 
  [Segni] I should like to point out that I founded the Pact 
as 
a liberal-democratic group providing an alternative to the Left: 
An tolerant platform in the European mold against the dominant 
Catholic-communist culture. I repeat that we were not born to 
form the Center: We were born to oppose [Democratic Party of 
the Left, PDS, Secretary] Occhetto. 
  [Inwinkl] In that case, your reply to Bianco is negative. 
  [Segni] I have to turn Gerardo down. Our alliance with the 
PPI harmed us in the general election. They still have pieces 
of the old regime in their ranks. This has once again proved to 
be the case in Sardinia in the last few days, preventing us from 
drawing up joint lists for the 12 June regional elections. The 
party is being pushed in different directions: There are those 
who want to join up with Berlusconi and those who are looking 
leftward. The price of these contradictions will be schism. We 
have already given enough. 
  [Inwinkl] Will you go into opposition on your own? 
  [Segni] Joining up with the PPI would mean laying more gifts 
in Berlusconi's lap. It would be the same if I made a deal with 
the PDS. This assessment, moreover, is confirmed in a recent 
interview that [PDS Deputy Secretary] Massimo D'Alema granted LA 
VOCE. Berlusconi has already had enough presents. Make no 
mistake about it, we are not an opposition on the left of the 
new government. We lay claim to the liberal-democratic values 
and policies that are not to be found in the forces that won the 
election. 
  [Inwinkl] But the polls failed to support you. 
  [Segni] We did not give the country the feeling that we 
represented something new. People believed in Berlusconi. 
Well, we must now compete with him, prove that we have greater 
credibility and consistency than the Freedom Alliance. As I 
have said, we are being placed at the center of the political 
spectrum merely because that is how we are seen, not because 
this is the image that we wish to project. Indeed, it is 
because we are not a centrist body that, knowing its liberalist 
tendencies, we sought a deal with the League. 
  [Inwinkl] The overture failed. What do you think of 
[Northern League Secretary] Bossi now? 
  [Segni] If Bossi had not nipped that deal in the bud, 
Berlusconi would not have entered the fray, and we should not 
now have Fini's ministers to contend with, as even a number of 
left-wing journalists have acknowledged over the last few days. 
Bossi chose another ally, and now he risks being eaten alive, 
even though he has scored a success in the formation of the 
government, with Maroni at the Viminale. But it is only a 
tactical victory. 
  [Inwinkl] So let us talk about the government. What is your 
assessment? 
  [Segni] I was the only one who questioned the appointment of 
the owner of Fininvest. In this connection, I believe the PDS 
was wrong not to take a strong line on this matter with 
Scalfaro. The lineup that has now been fielded confirms our 
worst fears: Berlusconi's employees and the exponents of 
neofascism. But apart from all this, there is another factor 
that has surprised me. 
  [Inwinkl] What is that? 
  [Segni] What I would call Berlusconi's "dorotheization" 
[referring to a former Christian Democratic faction]. From a 
man like him, I did not expect the long negotiations, the 
reinstatement of the Cencelli manual [power-sharing system], the 
recycling of notables from the First Republic, all in all, an 
immediate adaptation to the rituals and figures of the old 
system. 
  [Inwinkl] Gerardo Bianco criticizes you for your decision to 
head the lists of candidates for the European elections in all 
five constituencies. He calls it "Gaullism on a rather modest, 
rather comical scale." What do you say to that? 
  [Segni] Bianco is making friendly criticism. I took this 
step to give the lists a distinguishing political mark once 
Berlusconi and Fini had done the same thing. 
  [Inwinkl] Deputy Segni, once you were running for prime 
minister, and now you find yourself almost alone in parliament. 
Other promoters of the referendum movement, which changed the 
rules and course of Italian politics, have ended up in the 
shadows, from Barbera to Scoppola. Does this merely confirm the 
adage that every revolution devours its own children? 
  [Segni] It does not surprise me. The fact of the matter is 
that we are still in a confused stage of transition from the 
First Republic to the Second. When things have settled down, a 
new governing class will emerge. I hope and believe that we 
shall see those who contributed to victory in the referenda 
entering the fray once more, even though they will not be on my 
side: Anyway, that was a cross-party movement. 
  [Inwinkl] Do you have any more referendum initiatives in 
mind? 
  [Segni] First of all, I shall sign and give my support to 
the 
motion in favor of a referendum against the Mammi Law [on media 
monopolies].

<F P=106> [Open letter to Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi from </F>
Italian Republican Party Secretary Giorgio La Malfa: "Prime 
Minister, Please Explain..."] 
  [Text] Dear Prime Minister, for the first time in Italy the 
prime ministership -- the country's most senior government post 
-- is held by the owner of a large economic group that is very 
prominent in the mass communications field but also in many 
other areas, from large-scale commercial distribution to 
financial services, insurance, and so forth. 
  This raises a number of issues that must be broached 
promptly 
and with a constructive attitude. 
  The first issue, which has already been raised on various 
sides, concerns the matter of the television networks and, more 
generally, the information media that you own through the 
Fininvest group. This constitutes a problem, as is confirmed by 
the fact that, at your suggestion, the government has decided to 
entrust three experts with the task of preparing by September a 
possible supplement to existing regulations. 
  But if the problem exists, its solution cannot be entrusted 
merely to the lengthy procedures of a study drawn up by a group 
of experts, the formulation of a legislative document by the 
government, and its subsequent examination by parliament. A 
temporary solution must at least be provided -- pending possible 
amendments to the law -- that will immediately ensure the 
independence of television networks and other media from the 
government. 
  This is all the more necessary inasmuch as a campaign is 
under way for the election of the European Parliament on 12 
June, in which there should be no repetition of the favorable 
conditions that your political group was able to enjoy during 
the recent general election campaign. I hope that in your 
speech to the Senate today you will be able to announce 
something specific in this regard. 
  There is also a second important issue. It concerns the need 
to inform parliament and the public about the economic 
activities of which you are in charge. In the absence of 
accurate and exhaustive information in this regard, there would 
inevitably be suspicions concerning the motivations of all 
government decisions that could influence the course of any of 
these activities. 
  For this reason I ask you to make a pledge in your speech to 
publish soon all relevant data in this regard, some of which by 
law have to be published in any case. I am referring in 
particular to the following: 
  -- a statement of assets and liabilities for fiscal year 
1993 
of Fininvest Spa and the consolidated statement of accounts of 
the group belonging to it, together with an auditor's 
certification and, where necessary, accompanied by the 
corresponding documents for 1992; 
  -- an analysis of the debts of the umbrella group and of the 
group itself, with special reference to identifying the private 
and public banks to which the group is indebted and the 
specified terms of these loans. It is obviously necessary to 
know this information, especially in the case of public banks; 
  -- any debts and credits on the part of the umbrella group 
with respect to the companies that it controls; 
  -- the final balance of the umbrella group and the 
consolidated accounts of the group, with an analysis of 
capitalized costs and of any revaluations carried out during the 
accounting period; 
  -- a detailed list setting out the composition of the stock 
ownership of the Fininvest group, specifying which shares you 
yourself own directly and which you own indirectly and through 
which channels. 
  Last, I think it would be correct to provide a complete list 
of electoral contributions whether in the form of money or in 
the form of any services provided by the companies of your group 
in support of the political movement that you lead. 
  I am sure that you will understand that these requests are 
dictated not by an attitude of political contentiousness but, 
rather, by the need for openness common to all 
liberal-democratic societies -- a model that you yourself often 
cite. 
  I take this opportunity to send you my best wishes for 
success.

<F P=106> [Article by Bjarne Nitovuori: "No EU Referendum Until Next </F>
Year"] 
  [Excerpts] Organized opponents of the European Union [EU] 
are demanding that enough time be allowed for a citizens' debate 
on Finland's possible membership in the EU and that the planned 
referendum be postponed until next year. 
  "All the parties currently in the government promised before 
the last legislative elections that Finland would not seek EU 
membership during this election period. Since no EU debate was 
held before the election, there should be one now, and enough 
time should be provided for it," says the EU opposition's new 
umbrella organization in a resolution. 
  The umbrella organization introduced itself yesterday. It 
was 
formed by the four strongest civic organizations opposing 
Finland's membership in the EU, and its name is An Independent 
Finland -- The Best Alternative. [passage omitted] 
  It is a very mixed organization, and that is its strength, 
since the intention is to achieve majority support for a no vote 
in the referendum, according to the organization's 
representatives at yesterday's presentation. 
<H5>  Tiitinen Criticized </H5>
  Erkki Pulliainen noted that the current process means that 
we 
are passing from parliamentary democracy to domination by civil 
servants and the courts. 
  "From the West European standpoint, that is a very much a 
step in the wrong direction," he said. 
  Pulliainen promised that the organization would soon take a 
stand on the Tiitinen Committee's proposal concerning the effect 
of EU membership on the Constitution. Among other things, the 
committee said that Finland's membership in the EU could be 
approved by a two-thirds majority in one session of the 
Eduskunta. The umbrella organization and its supporting 
organizations take an unequivocally different view on that 
subject.

<F P=106> [Article by Bjarne Nitovuori: "Vayrynen: `No, I Am Not </F>
Leading Opposition to EU'"] 
  [Excerpt] Eduskunta Member Paavo Vayrynen (Center Party) 
does not feel that he assumed leadership of the European Union's 
[EU] opponents during his speech at the party delegation meeting 
in Tornio last Sunday [24 April], as the party organ ILKKA 
claimed on Monday that he had. 
  "That criticism is completely wrong in that I do not oppose 
EU membership in principle. And I do not feel that I oppose it 
at all," Vayrynen says. 
  He also denies that a power struggle is going in the Center 
Party between him and the party's chairman, Prime Minister Esko 
Aho. 
  "I am not competing with Esko Aho in any way at all, of 
course. He is party chairman; I am not, and I am not trying to 
be. I am a member of the Eduskunta from Uusimaa Province, and he 
is from Vaasa Province. No power struggle between us is even in 
sight. It's just that we have disagreed on certain issues. And 
at least to some extent, those differences of opinion show up on 
the issue of EU membership." 
<H5>  Impossible Subsidy Package </H5>
  Vayrynen is therefore denying that he opposes the EU, but he 
reiterates that he is very skeptical about whether it is 
sensible to join on the terms that exist and according to the 
timetable currently in effect. 
  "But I have not yet decided what I will do if it turns out 
that membership cannot be postponed." 
  Vayrynen's proposal that the matter be postponed has been 
met 
generally with the comment that no such alternative exists. 
  "Assuming that the agreement as it now stands is rejected in 
one way or another, will its supporters then feel that the issue 
is settled, or will they propose new negotiations the very next 
day as a way of making membership possible? As a rule, the 
latter is what happens. And that, too, would result in a 
postponement," Vayrynen replies. 
  So if the possibility of postponement exists for the 
supporters, then that same possibility also exists according to 
Vayrynen's model, he says. 
  Vayrynen's criticism of the EU agreement is based on the 
fact 
that we will have to follow a very short timetable in 
introducing unrestricted free trade in the food economy without 
any corresponding move by the EU to even out the differences 
arising from the fact that we have a cold climate, a short 
growing season, and other natural conditions. On the contrary, 
the EU has arrangements favoring those countries enjoying the 
best conditions for production. 
  "And when I have tried to get it clear in my mind how the 
Finnish farmer and food industry will be able to compete under 
such conditions, frightening prospects open up." 
  He points out that there is sizable overproduction in the EU 
and that the GATT agreement requires that the EU reduce its 
agricultural exports considerably. The big producing countries 
expect to partially compensate for that by conquering new 
markets in the new member countries. 
  The fact that Finland is being given the right to use its 
own 
money to subsidize agriculture does not make things any better. 
  "Finnish taxpayers would then be forced to compensate not 
only for the disadvantages due to climate but also for the 
distortion caused by the fact that the EU's common measures will 
compel it to subsidize production in the strong producing areas. 
  ``My opinion is that we will be incapable of paying enough 
in 
subsidies to support our own agriculture and food industry.'' 
<H5>  Not Worn Out </H5>
  Following the presidential election, in which he was 
defeated 
in the first round, Paavo Vayrynen has not had any major 
political responsibilities. At one point he seemed to be 
thinking of challenging Esko Aho in the election for party 
chairman at this summer's party congress. Above all, he wanted 
to be chairman of the party's Eduskunta group. All of this has 
been viewed as part of a power struggle between Vayrynen and Aho. 
  He claims, however, that he did not consider running for 
party chairman. 
  "But I did think about the matter after being questioned 
about it," he admits. 
  Vayrynen sees nothing strange about the fact that he did not 
inform Aho of his ambition to become group chairman. 
  "Questions of that kind are discussed with the chairman of 
the Eduskunta group because what they involve is an election 
within the group. And it has not been the custom to discuss them 
beforehand with the party chairman," he says. 
  "As far as I am concerned, there would have been no reason 
not to discuss the matter with Aho as well if the opportunity 
had arisen. I don't know why (group chairman) Kalevi Mattila did 
not take the matter up with Aho." 
  Nor does Vayrynen share Aho's view that he should not have 
given up the post of minister of foreign affairs a year ago. 
  "In view of the conditions existing at the time, that was 
the 
only possible solution. I knew from personal experience what it 
was like to be a potential candidate for president. It was very 
difficult to work in the government, and I wanted to be able to 
pursue my election campaign very freely. From the standpoint of 
the campaign, it was a good solution. 
  ``On the other hand, one can speculate as to how the EU 
negotiations would have turned out if I had been involved in 
them. My position now is that we should have continued the 
negotiations. We should have stuck to our principal negotiating 
objectives and not have signed an agreement on these terms.'' 
  Vayrynen does not yet see himself as a worn-out pensioner. 
  "You would think that in a party as big as this one, there 
would be something for me to do -- something that I would also 
consider meaningful." 
  The general opinion is that Aho has now won a decisive 
victory in the struggle between him and Vayrynen. Vayrynen does 
not share that view. He admits, however, that there have been 
problems in his relations with party chairman Esko Aho. 
  "I don't see it as being a matter of a power struggle. Aho 
is 
indisputably party chairman. I am not thinking of challenging 
him, nor do I see anyone else in the running to become party 
chairman." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem </F>
Brundtland by Othar Ruehl in Oslo; date not given: "Russia Is a 
Great Nation, We Have To Take It Seriously"] 
  [Text] [Ruehl] If Norway is to become a member of the 
European Union [EU] in 1995 -- along with Sweden, Finland, 
Austria -- there will be a fundamental change in the political 
structure and internal balance of the union envisaged by the 
Maastricht union. Will the union be less cohesive? 
  [Brundtland] I do not think so. That is because at its 
meeting in Lisbon, the EU Council decided that the expansion 
should proceed on the basis of the existing balance. However, 
there will, of course, be new discussions once a country is 
admitted. We will enter such discussion without any 
preconceptions. 
  [Ruehl] But does this expansion toward the north and 
northeast not mean that there will be a geopolitical change, 
especially for Russia? 
  [Brundtland] Yes, because if one views such a move from a 
historical angle, against the background of the Cold War, then 
northern Europe was geographically and militarily close to the 
focal point of East-West confrontation, if only because of 
Russia's access to the Atlantic and the USSR's strategic 
complex, the North Sea Fleet, and the submarines that could 
launch missiles based at Kola. The "northern balance" in the 
Cold War became apparent after Norway and Denmark joined NATO in 
1949, while Sweden and Finland remained neutral. That was how 
everything was settled. With the collapse of the Soviet empire, 
this eastern barrier disappeared and the road to the West was 
opened up. All of northern Europe now has the possibility of 
embarking on the EU path, so that it can then have a common 
border with Russia, one that will include Norway's border with 
Russia in the north and the entire Russo-Finnish border. This 
is now part of the European reality. However, if one looks back 
to the time when the Soviet Union still existed, then one also 
realizes that all the countries here in the north had good 
relations with Soviet Russia; trade, cross-border traffic, and 
relations in general were good. That will also make future 
European policy vis-a-vis Russia simpler. The three northern 
European countries will make a significant contribution in this 
respect. 
  [Ruehl] So, you share a view that is widespread in Moscow, 
namely, that an expansion of the EU could be a way of pressuring 
Russia? Some would see it as an advance staged by the Western 
bloc of states or, in any event, by a strong military grouping. 
For example, the head of the Russian intelligence service, 
Primakov, spoke of the dangers of the West's offensive military 
capacity in connection with NATO. 
  [Brundtland] I do not think that such views reflect current 
Russian thinking about West Europe. The Russians have the 
experience of cooperating with Norway, Finland, and Sweden. 
This has enabled them to develop confidence in the northern 
European countries, in the fact that those countries desire to 
live in peace in the region along with Russia, without 
confrontation and to the exclusion of no one. With the "Barents 
initiative," Norway made a proposal for the further development 
of regional cooperation that was taken up by Russia. The 
proposal envisages cooperation in the fields of business, 
ecology, technology, and culture -- cooperation extending beyond 
borders and involving the northern European countries, Russia, 
the United States, and the EU. Russia understands a positive 
initiative of this kind. Foreign Minister Kozyrev has said that 
it would be advantageous from the Russian viewpoint for Norway 
to be a member of the EU. Some people were surprised by that, 
but I was not. 
  [Ruehl] Would that also apply to an expansion of the EU in 
the north and in the Baltic region? 
  [Brundtland] As a NATO member, Norway is an associate member 
of the Western European Union [WEU]. We also want to become 
full members of the WEU as soon as we have joined the EU. That 
also depends, of course, on how the Norwegian people vote on the 
admission treaty. We want to be able to function fully in both 
organizations, because we cannot be only members of the EU or 
alternatively, only members of the WEU. Norway will then be an 
active partner in the common foreign and security policies 
envisaged by the Maastricht Treaty and contribute to their 
development. That is our goal. 
  [Ruehl] Does this mean that Norway will also advocate 
enhancing the status of the WEU as a "European pillar" within 
NATO? Should one try, in the course of expanding the EU, to make 
more of the WEU than has been the case so far? The WEU has in 
fact already assumed the tasks of the alliance's European group 
of partners and has established direct relations with NATO in 
Brussels. 
  [Brundtland] I am not sure about that question until we are 
in the EU. At this point, I cannot judge how different roles 
should best be assigned to the EU and WEU in the future. I want 
to see how things function within the EU. One must also 
consider the fact that the European partners in the EU cooperate 
much more closely within the EU than within the WEU or NATO. 
The EU foreign ministers meet each other more often, more than 
once a month, which means that political consultations at the 
governmental level are the most frequent within the EU. These 
meetings mean that there is an ongoing dialogue and a process of 
reaching agreement. There is no doubt that this central 
relationship within the EU will be the basis of common policy 
and will have a vital function in determining European security 
interests and security policy tasks. At the head of government 
and foreign minister level, the European governments formulate 
common NATO policy and represent the decisions made by their 
countries with NATO in the same way as they do within the EU in 
the case of European affairs. This is the background against 
which one must consider what is left for the WEU as a "European 
pillar." Countries and their governments are always the key 
elements. 
  [Ruehl] To ensure its security, Norway has in the past 
primarily relied on the United States and Great Britain to 
protect NATO's northern flank and has insisted on an adequate 
U.S. presence on the northern flank with the provision of 
reinforcements from the United States and the U.S. Atlantic 
fleet for crises deployment in the Norwegian Sea. Has something 
changed for Norway in this respect following the end of the 
Soviet Union or does Oslo still always look across the Atlantic 
to the distant west and count on a strategic umbrella and a 
military commitment on the part of the United States? 
  [Brundtland] We are still of the opinion that the 
transatlantic bond should not be weakened. In Europe, one would 
no longer have security or would not have security at the same 
level if this bond were weakened. One can say that as a 
Norwegian, but also as a German, a Briton, and even as a 
Frenchman, which is something that the French have incidentally 
recognized in the meantime. The Norwegian Government has 
constantly lobbied the U.S. Administration and the Congress in 
Washington to maintain, not reduce the U.S. military presence on 
Norway's coastline and northern flank. In view of reductions in 
the military budget, particularly the U.S. one, and the 
restructuring of the U.S. Armed Forces, we have been emphasizing 
the fact that the transatlantic link and U.S. military forces 
are still needed. The alliance's strength and Europe's security 
is based on the sum total of European and North American defense 
efforts. 
  [Ruehl] Should this support be extended to the Baltic and 
eastern Central Europe by expanding NATO eastward? 
  [Brundtland] I think that we should leave things in the form 
that was decided on at the NATO Council meeting in January. The 
offer of Partnership for Peace [PFP] to all European countries 
that do not belong to NATO, which also means all the countries 
to the east of the alliance, makes it possible to hold 
discussions with everyone about their specific circumstances, 
and on the basis of the actual situation of each country, look 
at a given country's security needs, at what obligations it can 
assume, and what contributions it can make. In any event, there 
will be a bilateral relationship between a given country and 
NATO and not simply a security guarantee issued by NATO. NATO 
made that a precondition for these new partnerships before the 
offer was made in Brussels. It is a good solution. 
  [Ruehl] Do you consider the PFP to be an experiment or a 
fixed program, a model enabling NATO to organize European 
security beyond alliance territory? 
  [Brundtland] I view it as a flexible process that will allow 
experience to be acquired. Now that some countries have 
accepted the offer, a certain dynamic can be set in motion that 
will parallel the expansion of the EU. The process will take 
several years and create a network of bilateral ties between 
NATO and other states. 
  [Ruehl] This leads one back to the question of a special 
security partnership between NATO and Russia. President Yeltsin 
and Foreign Minister Kozyrev have expressed concern that a new 
form of confrontation might not necessarily come into being, but 
that a new dividing line might appear in Europe, one created by 
the West. Kozyrev even warned France against reviving the 1920's 
policy of a "cordon sanitaire to isolate Russia." 
  [Brundtland] Well, that is one aspect of an analysis of the 
situation in Europe. NATO started a discussion about these 
issues, about the relationship to Russia, and the result was the 
January council resolution with an offer that also applies to 
Russia so as to prevent the appearance of a new dividing line 
between Europe and Russia. Earlier Russian statements conveyed 
concern and expressed warnings about pursuing a policy that 
would exclude Russia. Nothing of that sort occurred in Brussels 
in January. That is why the PFP has also been offered to 
Russia. No new barriers should be erected. 
  [Ruehl] With regard to security, President Yeltsin always 
returns to the same point: Russian participation in a special 
relationship with NATO and, incidentally, a bilateral 
relationship with the United States, one between two nuclear 
superpowers with a great military potential. Evidently, he 
wants more than the partnership offer, something very special, 
something appropriate to Russia's significance and not the 
expansion of NATO to cover the territory of the former Warsaw 
Pact. He has been talking about the "geopolitical balance" in 
1990, which should not be changed in a way that would be to 
Russia's disadvantage. He has also proposed a "joint security 
guarantee" given to other states by both NATO and Russia instead 
of admission to NATO, and he has taken up what Clinton said 
about a "strategic partnership with Russia." 
  [Brundtland] In its declaration, the NATO Council avoided 
potentially negative aspects in that sense. This period of 
history is not one in which one could have a division of power 
in Europe, a "condominium" between two superpowers, or the 
creation of "strategic spheres of interest." The days of empire 
and hegemony are over, as Yeltsin himself said. However, the 
rejection of such ideas does not mean that one should fail to 
take account of Russia's history and interests. Indeed, it 
means that one must take account of Russia's interests with 
respect to economic development, to participate in European 
institutions and international agreements such as the GATT 
customs and trade treaty, and to have an input into the kind of 
"mixed economy" that we have in the West. That is because none 
of us lives in a "capitalist society." In our free market 
economies, we have a public sector alongside a private sector. 
The East European countries, including Russia, could develop in 
line with this model of a "mixed economy." 
  [Ruehl] Let's stay with this model. As part of the EU, 
what could northern Europe do in the Baltic region? 
  [Brundtland] Our goal is to develop and consolidate 
democracy. That applies to all the East European countries, but, 
of course, also to Russia, with which we live in the same part 
of Europe. Our own security needs dictate that we support the 
development of democracy and a cooperative attitude on the part 
of Russia toward its neighbors, beginning with the Baltic 
states, whose development we are also assisting and that also 
look toward northern Europe. The northern European countries 
have a democratic tradition, one composed of a social democracy 
along with a "mixed economy," in which the state is also active. 
This could provide a model for the East European countries. 
Europe must view the opening up of the East as a historic 
challenge. The EU now has the possibility of acquiring a truly 
pan-European significance -- to go beyond a single market and 
political union -- and to become more than just a customs and 
monetary union for an economic region, although that in itself 
is already of great significance. That is of even greater 
benefit to the countries of East Europe, because only 
cooperation can settle problems with Russia pertaining to the 
present situation and history and thus create a community of 
neighbors between whom, just as in West Europe, there can be no 
confrontation. Of course, it is not easy to balance interests, 
but we can conclude compromises. We will make an effort to 
achieve that. 
  [Ruehl] Thus, should Russia become a G-7 partner? 
  [Brundtland] That is difficult to say today, especially if 
one is not a member oneself. In a certain sense perhaps; it 
depends on the arrangements that are made. In any event, Russia 
is a great nation that must be taken seriously and must 
participate in discussions about the future of the world 
economy. That is in our common interest, because we are all 
involved in developing a democratic society. We are already 
cooperating with Russia in the north and in the Baltic region, 
and Germany and Poland are also involved in that cooperation. 
  [Ruehl] Irrespective of that, what is your opinion of a 
"strategic partnership with Russia," which has also been offered 
by NATO General Secretary Manfred Woerner? 
  [Brundtland] We all have an interest in a good relationship 
between the United States and Russia, which also involves 
bilateral relations between the two superpowers and especially 
cooperation with Russia participation on the UN Security 
Council. This should also be given a multilateral institutional 
configuration, covering Russian relations with the EU and NATO 
as well as Russia's position within the CSCE. 
  [Ruehl] We would like to turn to the subject of Bosnia now. 
What conclusions are to be drawn from Western policy on the 
collapse of the Yugoslavia and the ensuing conflict there and 
from what NATO has done? 
  [Brundtland] The main problem in the EU as well as in NATO 
was that the most important partners did not agree on a common 
analysis of the causes of the conflict, criteria for action, and 
common interests in good time. That also had an impact on the 
Security Council. 
  [Ruehl] If one views all these things together: What are 
the implications for European security and the role of various 
organizations, for example, the CSCE, or the WEU and NATO? 
  [Brundtland] As far as the application of CSCE rules and 
principles and the oversight of situations and developments are 
concerned, the CSCE has a positive role. However, in the case 
of preserving or establishing peace, authority lies with the UN 
Security Council, which is alone in having the authority to 
decide on the use of force and sanctions and to issue a mandate 
for specific political or military operations. The United 
Nations is the only organization that has a mandate from all 
nations to act in the name of international security. Outside 
the bounds of collective security, NATO can only act with a UN 
mandate, that is, in the service of NATO. 
  [Ruehl] Through its actions, has the West not played into 
the hands of the parties to the conflict? 
  [Brundtland] The problem is that when this tragedy began, 
the United States and the most influential nations in Europe 
were unable to agree on a common assessment of what was at 
stake. Differing views were expressed for too long a time, and 
the parties to the conflict played these differences off against 
each other, going along with one European opinion on one 
occasion, then switching to another European view or that of the 
United States in order to gain advantages. I hope it has now 
been realized that it is necessary to adopt a common stance 
based on a joint assessment of the situation and a joint concept 
for a policy. The alliance summit resulted in the unanimous 
adoption of basic principles on Bosnia. The difficulties 
involved in reaching agreement and deciding on joint action did 
indeed -- to answer your question -- play into the hands of the 
various parties to the conflict. They used that opportunity in 
dealings with the EU and UN Security Council. We have been 
taught a lesson, a very bitter one, I believe.

<F P=106> [Report by Dhimitrios Filios] </F>
  [Text] The negotiating procedure in New York for the 
resumption of talks on Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia, FYROM] has entered a new phase with both sides 
accepting a package for negotiation that includes the name 
issue. Ambassador Khristos Zakharakis, the Foreign Ministry 
secretary general, had a 90-minute meeting this morning with UN 
mediator Cyrus Vance. Afterward, Zakharakis simply said that 
views are being exchanged to find a way to promote the 
negotiating procedure. 
  Answering a question, Zakharakis said there is no progress 
in 
the talks but added that there are hopes. Asked whether U.S. 
Presidential Envoy Matthew Nimetz will participate in the talks 
and if there is a UN proposal that includes the term New 
Macedonia, North Macedonia, or Nova Majedonia, the Foreign 
Ministry secretary general said Nimetz submitted no proposals; 
he is merely participating in a procedure to exchange views. 
  Joe Sills, the UN secretary general's spokesman, today said 
there is no timetable for the talks on Macedonia. Vance will 
hold a new meeting with Skopjean Foreign Minister Stevo 
Crvenkovski late tonight, and tomorrow he is expected to meet 
Zakharakis.

Economics: "Eight Truths Which We Do Not Want to Hear"] 
  [Text] Because misinformation and the systematic 
disorientation of the citizenry on the Skopje issue have taken 
on kafkaesque proportions, I will attempt, in this brief note, 
not to develop, but simply to mention a small number of points 
that all of us should know in order to formulate a logical and 
nationally advantageous position vis-a-vis this smoldering 
problem, a problem which day by day becomes even more 
unsolvable, thereby worsening our country's position vis-a-vis 
friends and foes. 
  1. After the Balkan Wars and the First World War, the 
geographic region of Macedonia was divided into three parts. 
Greece received 53 percent, Serbia received 33 percent, and 
Bulgaria--as the loser in the wars--received the smallest part. 
  2. As early as 1919 the two areas not joined to Greece were 
called Yugoslav Macedonia (or Vardar Macedonia) and Bulgarian 
Macedonia (or Pirin Macedonia) by foreign and Greek politicians, 
diplomats, historians, geographers, and journalists. For 
example, look in theIliou Encyclopediaunder 
"Macedonian Question." 
  3. In 1924, after the Asia Minor disaster and the massive 
population exchanges, our part of Macedonia became "Greek" not 
just due to the division, but also ethnographically: that is, 
the Slavonic minorities in Greek Macedonia became from that 
time, and continue to be today, insignificant. Therefore, after 
1924 no serious minorities issue arises in Greek Macedonia, as 
it does in Thrace. 
  4. After the Second World War, the area joined to Serbia in 
1919 became, under the name Macedonia, one of the "republics" of 
Socialist Yugoslavia, which was tolerated by Greece. Since then, 
up to today, the inhabitants of that area have, in the main, 
been raised with the notion that they are Macedonians. 
  5. The issue of not accepting Skopje, not just under the 
name 
of "Republic of Macedonia," but also under a "hybrid" name (e.g. 
Vardar Macedonia), began with Mr. Samaras, who managed to set 
the basic rules of the game (that is, making the name absolutely 
paramount), rules which the two large parties decided to follow. 
  6. Greece's insistence on not recognizing Skopje, not just 
under the name of "Republic of Macedonia" (something that is 
logical), but also under a "hybrid" name (something illogical), 
is at variance with basic democratic rules concerning the right 
to self-determination for individuals, groups, and peoples, as 
these rules have been formulated, for example, by the United 
Nations. 
  7. Even if we were to find friends and allies who would be 
disposed to "pressure" Mr. Gligorov into accepting our 
maximalist position (that is, forbidding the use of the term 
"Macedonia and its derivatives"), the latter could never impose 
such a solution on the Skopje Parliament. The parliament would 
by an overwhelming majority vote down every name not having some 
reference to the term "Macedonia." 
  8. When we maintain at demonstrations and elsewhere that 
"Macedonia is Greek," or, even worse, that it is "one and 
Greek," every rational human being could only give two 
interpretations to the aforementioned slogans: either we are 
ignoring what occurred in 1919, or we do not accept the 
division, and therefore have plans to annex the two areas of 
Macedonia that are at this time outside Greek borders. 
Therefore, when our political and religious leaders not only 
tolerate, but also passionately promote these slogans, it is not 
at all strange that foreigners think that we have lost our 
reason, or that we have imperialist tendencies vis-a-vis two 
other non-Greek Macedonias. 
  The aforementioned eight informational observations cannot 
be 
ignored by arguing that Skopje has taken leave of its senses, 
and that its chauvinism and irredentism has taken on paranoid or 
ludicrous proportions, etc. Although Skopje is truely talking 
absurdities, that is no reason for us to talk absurdities as 
well in supporting positions unbecoming to a country with our 
cultural heritage, a country that is a member of the European 
Union [EU] and has behind it two centuries of democratic 
parliamentary tradition. Above all there is no excuse for hiding 
from the Greek people basic information such as that which I 
have just mentioned. Systematic misinformation underestimates 
the intelligence of the Greek people, and is based on an 
extremely antidemocratic, obscurantist, autarchic mentality. 
Above all, it impedes us in correctly evaluating the current 
situation. 
  Specifically, at this time there are two basic strategies 
that we can follow: 
  Strategy A: Insisting on making absolutely paramount, or 
monolpolizing, the term "Macedonia." 
  This strategy can only result in the following: the 
continuation of the diplomatic isolation of our country; 
everyone recognizing Skopje under the truely irredentist name of 
"Republic of Macedonia;" the worldwide projection of the image 
of [President] Gligorov, and the support of all governments for 
Skopje as "victim" of Greek intransigence; the "embracing" of 
Skopje on the part of Bulgaria and Turkey; the dramatic rise of 
Turkish influence in the Balkans and western Europe; and, 
finally, the loss of a unique opportunity for our country to 
become the unifying link between the EU and the Balkans. 
  Strategy B: the acceptance of a "hybrid name." 
  The clear acceptance on the part of Greece that a name 
containing the term "Macedonia" constitutes a negotiable matter 
will immediately open the way for a "Pinheiro" type of solution. 
That is, Greece will on the one hand accept a hybrid name (e.g., 
Vardar Macedonia) and offer economic cooperation in return for 
the three well-known conditions (changes in the Constitution, a 
change of symbols, and an end to irredentist propaganda). In 
addition, Greece could request and easily attain special 
security provisions for her current borders. 
  If the aforementioned points are right, one must wonder how 
it is possible for the government and the larger part of the 
opposition to insist on self-destructive Strategy A. Perhaps our 
politicians have gone mad? No, they have not gone mad; they are 
simply putting party interest, the much-vaunted calculation of 
"political cost," above every other calculation. Populist 
flagwaving would seem to triumph yet again. The Skopje question 
is the most blatant sign of a deep political and social crisis 
through which our country is now passing.

Economics: "Who Benefits From the Demonstrations?"] 
  [Text] There is no doubt that last Thursday's demonstration 
in Salonica was a great success. However, who benefits from this 
kind of mobilization? Answer: the prime minister, the three 
major parties, and the church. But, according to no logic does 
the country benefit at this time. With this note I will attempt, 
as briefly as possible, to support this position. 
  First of all, the demonstrations on the Skopje problem 
benefit the leader [Andreas Papandreou] of the Panhellenic 
Socialist Movement [PASOK]. Although he can see that making 
absolutely paramount the issue of the name [Macedonia], and 
insisting (in spite of intraparty pressures) on not accepting a 
hybrid name [Vardar Macedonia], has driven the country to 
unprecedented international isolation, he does not desire to 
finish his prime ministership in the same way as he began it: 
with a 180-degree turn similar to that which he made on the 
issue of the EEC and NATO. Seen from this vantage point, the 
mobilization in Salonica both reinforces his position in PASOK, 
and affords him yet another opportunity to avoid the bitter 
medicine of changing policy on the name issue--a change which 
must necessarily take place for us to get out of the dead end 
into which [Political Spring Party leader] Andonis Samaras and 
the leaders of the other two parties have lead our country, for 
clearly vote-getting reasons. 
  Second, the three largest parties, which actively support 
this kind of populist mobilization, benefit by the 
demonstrations (in the short run, of course). Even if they do 
not manage to turn a popular upsurge into political capital for 
themselves, they at least avoid the possibility of being left 
outside the vote redistribution game at a time when, because of 
the nationalist upsurge, all things are in flux and everything 
is on the line. 
  Thirdly, in an attempt to alter its marginal, almost 
exclusively ceremonial role in Greek society today, the church 
benefits by mass mobilizations through its active participation 
in the "national uprising." The church, which had already lost 
its autonomy from the middle of the last century (for reasons 
that I cannot explain here[.sup]1[/]) and was rendered an 
extension of public administration, finds in the Skopje question 
a unique opportunity to demonstrate that it is not just suited 
for baptisms, weddings, and funerals; that, its politicization 
aside (which has intesified in pace from the time of the 
dictatorship and afterward), it has a fundamental nonpartisan, 
patriotic role to play. 
  So the prime minister, the three parties, and the church are 
the gainers--at least in the short run. The Greek people, 
however, who have never been apprised of the Skopje problem by 
means of an open, democratic dialog, are the big losers. They 
not only lost a unique opportunity to become the connecting link 
between the European Union and the Balkans, but were lead to 
unprecedented international isolation which, with mathematical 
precision, harms them economically and politically, because it 
eliminates the possibility for northern Greece in general, and 
Salonica specifically, to become the main pole for the 
development of the Balkans (something that would of course 
become the most substantive means of controlling the chauvinism 
of Skopje), and which pushes Skopje, especially after the 
embargo, into the embraces of Bulgaria and Turkey. Thus, we give 
Turkey a unique opportunity to increase its clout in the Balkans 
and in West Europe at a time when we have managed to be without 
any friends (except for Serbia, of course!). 
  And while Turkey furiously strengthens its position, we 
expend all our energies, and divert all our attention to the 
clearly imaginary dangers contained in a "hybrid name" (which is 
the only democratic solution[.sup]2[/]). In other words we 
are concentrating on the Skopje flea, and ignoring the Turkish 
elephant--or rather, we are doing what we can to reinforce 
Turkey's position, and undermine our own, in an arena where 
Greece's interests and borders are truely at risk. Conclusion: 
the prime minister, the three largest parties, and the 
church--if they really desire what is good for the land--will 
have to do the following: 
  a. The prime minister will make another 180-degree turn on 
the issue of the name, and will clearly declare that a hybrid 
name is a negotiable matter (e.g. we will accept a hybrid name 
in exchange for the three well-known conditions). 
  b. The parties will cease putting, at such a critical 
moment, 
their party interests above the national interest. 
  c. The church will fight for its autonomy from the system of 
state and party politics--something that will allow it to devote 
itself more to the cultural and religious problems of the modern 
Greeks, and less to the formation of the country's foreign 
policy.

"derivatives") is not possible, beneficial for the country, or 
democratic. On this topic see my related articles in VIMA TIS

<F P=106> [Article by Irini Kakoulidou: "Greece Dependent on Turkish </F>
Electric Energy"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Obliged To Pay High Prices for Imported </H5>
Electricity 
  At a time of critical importance for national matters, and 
while it is busy with its numerous preelection commitments, the 
government is energetically pushing through its project to 
connect the electrical networks of Greece and Turkey, in spite 
of having to accept disadvantageous terms for the Greek side in 
doing so. 
  Last week, the executive committee of the Public Electricity 
Corporation [DEH] discussed the project to connect the 
electricity grids of Greece and Turkey, and decided to initiate 
procedures with a view to signing the relevant agreement with 
Turkey. One of the government's main arguments for the necessity 
of this connection is that it will create an energy axis linking 
Turkey, Greece, and Italy, in which our country will occupy a 
central position. The connection between Greece and Italy will 
be accomplished by an underwater cable whose construction has 
already begun. 
  Because Italy is in need of large supplies of electricity 
and 
Turkey has considerable quantities of it available for export, 
such an energy axis could be of great advantage to Greece. For 
obvious reasons, nevertheless, Turkey does not wish to let its 
Western exports be dependent on an intervening Greek network, 
and is therefore pursuing the construction of an alternative 
route which will link Turkey with Italy by going through 
Bulgaria, Skopje, and Albania. (The agreement about this 
connection between Italy and Albania -- which is to be 
accomplished by underwater cable between the two countries -- 
has already been signed.) By means of such a northern energy 
route, designed to link Turkey to the West and to the Balkan 
countries in-between, Greece is deprived of its advantage. 
  Connecting the electricity grid of Greece to that of Turkey, 
however, will have yet another, graver, repercussion. Given the 
fact that our country is now facing a shortage of electric 
energy and that this shortage is expected to keep growing until 
at least 1998, the Turkish hookup will make us dependent on our 
neighbor for energy. That means that the exclusive function of 
the hookup will be to export Turkish electricity to Greece for 
Greek consumption only, under terms -- as indicated by talks 
between DEH and TEK [the Turkish electric company] -- very 
unfavorable for Greece. During a meeting of representatives of 
the two electric companies which took place in Athens on 
February 23-24, TEK asked DEH to pay 6.265 cents for each 
kilowatt-hour of imported electricity. This is almost twice the 
present cost of 3.46 cents per kwhr produced by the large 
oil-fired generating unit that DEH is currently using. The cost 
of energy produced by large-capacity lignite coal units is even 
lower than that. Of course, DEH has not yet made known its final 
decision regarding the asking price, as this is scheduled to be 
discussed at the next meeting of the representatives of the two 
companies next month. 
  In any case, the bargaining position of DEH does not inspire 
one with confidence. It is currently within TEK's discretion to 
offer our country electricity at high prices because, on the one 
hand, Greece faces serious difficulties in being supplied by 
either the Yugoslav or the Bulgarian network and, on the other, 
it has been too slow to install new electric generating 
facilities with which to meet its steadily rising electricity 
needs. During their meeting with representatives of TEK last 
February, the representatives of DEH negotiated imports of 
electric energy from Turkey equivalent to the output of one 
generating plant of 180 mw capacity, functioning continuously 
with lowered rates at night. 
  Through the connection of the two networks, therefore, 
Turkey 
achieves two objectives: In the first place, it makes our 
country, and more especially the nationally sensitive region of 
Thrace, dependent on Turkey for electricity. It is an undisputed 
fact that the supplies of electricity from Turkey will be 
channelled to Thrace, first because this border region does not 
possess even a single electricity-producing unit, and second, 
because any attempt to circulate imported electricity through 
the entire extent of the Greek network would be financially 
ill-advised. Even now, all the electricity imported from 
Bulgaria is used exclusively by Thrace. 
  In the second place, it coerces Greece to pay excessively 
high prices before it can satisfy urgent and extensive 
electricity needs. In the opinion of some energy experts, the 
reason for which Turkey is exacting such prices from Greece is 
that it hopes, by so doing, to finance its plan of rendering the 
Balkans dependent on itself for energy. The high tariffs it is 
proposing to Greece will allow it to depress the prices at which 
it can sell electricity to the other Balkan countries (all of 
whom are also in urgent need of electricity imports), 
facilitating in this manner their economic and political 
dependence on Turkey. 
<H5>  The Meetings </H5>
  Turkey's coercive tactics toward Greece in regard to 
electric 
energy prices is evident in the way meetings between DEH and TEK 
have evolved since 1990. In the first of these meetings 
(Constantinople, 8-9 October 1990), there was no discussion of 
prices but only of the theoretical rationale for the schedule of 
rates, which were to be based on the cost of production per oil 
unit (i.e., cost of oil plus operation and maintenance costs). 
During the second meeting (Athens, 8-9 November 1990), the Turks 
proposed a price of 2.93 cents per kwhr, while DEH countered 
with 2.1 cents. At the third meeting (Smyrna, 19-20 December 
1990), the two sides agreed on theoretical methods of 
determining price, while postponing the practical and precise 
determination of basic parameters until a later date. During the 
same meeting, it was also mentioned for the first time that the 
yearly quantities to be imported by Greece between 1991 and 1994 
would be of the order of 1.2 to 1.4 billion kwhr. Two additional 
meetings have taken place since: the first before the elections 
on 24 September 1993 at Ankara, and the second on February 23-24 
in Athens. At this last meeting, TEK representatives proposed 
the markedly high price of 6.265 cents for each imported kwhr. 
  It must be noted that the price Turkey is asking is almost 
double not only the production costs of DEH, but also those of 
the cost of the notorious BOO facilities which the previous 
government had negotiated with private interests. Analyses 
conducted by DEH in regard to the offers made for the Lavrion 
generating plants led to the conclusion that their production 
cost would be between 3.5 and 4.0 cents per kwhr, inclusive of 
the investment cost.

<F P=106> [Report by Yeoryios Karelias] </F>
  [Excerpts] PASOK's [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] calm 
waters were disturbed following the election of its new 
Executive Bureau. Prominent members like Theodhoros Pangalos 
and Vaso Papandreou were not elected, while Konstandinos Simitis 
just made it. The three are considered to be "antileaders." 
  Akis Tsokhatzopoulos' team is considered responsible for the 
exclusion. Tsokhatzopoulos, who controls the largest group in 
the Central Committee and has Prime Minister Andreas 
Papandreou's support, was triumphantly reelected secretary. 
<H5>  Questions and Explanations </H5>
  Pangalos' and Papandreou's exclusion raises justified 
questions. This is because: 
  -- The alternate foreign minister was triumphantly present 
at 
the recent congress, coming in second in voting after Yeoryios 
Yennimatas. In his case, PASOK's Central Committee disagreed 
with the feelings of the party's organized supporters. 
  -- Vaso Papandreou was the big winner of the national 
elections, ranking first in Athens B District. She also did 
very well at the congress (she ranked sixth in the Central 
Committee voting). In her case, the Central Committee disagreed 
with PASOK's voting and partisan basis. 
  -- Konstandinos Simitis was 12th out of 18 members. The last 
time, he was at the top of the Executive Bureau. Simitis and 
Pangalos are considered to be the two that will most probably 
pursue the party's leadership when Papandreou decides to resign. 
  The outcome of the election the day before yesterday may be 
explained as follows: 
  -- Pangalos "paid" for his recent, continuous, and 
"heretical" remarks on various issues. Mainly, however, he paid 
for his very recent statement that he will pursue the party's 
leadership. 
  -- Simitis, who nearly did not get elected, "paid" for being 
against Tsokhatzopoulos at the party congress. Simitis was the 
only Executive Bureau member who insisted that a vote be taken 
on the incompatibility of being a secretary and a minister. It 
is well-known that the congress finally adopted this position. 
The day before yesterday, Tsokhatzopoulos' team "paid him 
back." Associates of the party's secretary and other officials 
blamed the small number of votes received by Simitis on the fact 
that his side is mainly responsible for the 29 blank votes cast 
during Tsokhatzopoulos election. 
  -- It seems that Vaso Papandreou "paid" for her 
antileadership remarks, her accusations about the operation of 
mechanisms, and her rapid promotion through the mass media. 
  Last night, PASOK members characteristically said that "it 
was Akis' [Tsokhatzopoulos] revenge" and expressed skepticism 
about future interparty operations, particularly what could 
happen when Papandreou leaves the leadership. 
<H5>  Initiatives and Relaxation </H5>
  Initiatives are expected to be adopted in the next few days 
to relax the situation. Yerasimos Arsenis' (he ranked 7th) 
office mentioned that the defense minister intends to undertake 
a "joint and balanced" initiative so that future sector 
secretaries will be mutually accepted in order to end the 
Tsokhatzopoulos-Simitis dispute. Chamber of Deputies President 
Apostolos Kaklamanis, who ranked first, expressed similar views. 
  Other impressive points of the election are: 
  -- The failure of Karolos Papoulias and Evangelos Venizelos 
to get elected in the new Executive Bureau despite Papandreou's 
wishes. The prime minister appears dissatisfied with this 
development. Venizelos' failure is again attributed to 
Tsokhatzopoulos team, given that the government spokesman is the 
secretary's opponent in Thessaloniki. In the last elections, 
Venizelos ranked first. Indicatively, the organization's 
secretary in Thessaloniki, Ioannis Magkriotis, a close associate 
of Tsokhatzopoulos, was elected to the Executive Bureau. 
  Papoulias' failure is attributed to the fact that he has 
minimal party involvement so far. 
  -- That Kaklamanis was first. Kaklamanis wants to play the 
top role in PASOK when Papandreou decides to jump over to the 
presidency. In any case, the Chamber of Deputies president 
refrains from referring publicly to this issue and stresses his 
unifying role, which secured him first place. 
  -- The failure of Yeoryios Papandreou, who did very well at 
the congress. Khatzimikhalis, a member of the former Executive 
Bureau, also was not elected. Anastasios Peponis, the deputy 
minister to the prime minister, who was a member of the former 
Executive Bureau, was not a candidate, saying he prefers to deal 
solely with his ministerial duties. 
  -- That second place went to Konstandinos Laliotis who kept 
saying he is not a part of "groups and mechanisms." [passage 
omitted] 
<H5>  Composition and Reaction </H5>
  Five ministers (Konstandinos Laliotis, Yerasimos Arsenis, 
Ioannis Souladhakis, Konstandinos Skandhalidhis, Konstandinos 
Simitis), a deputy minister (Andonios Kotsakas) and a ministry 
secretary general (Papaioannou) are in the new Executive Bureau. 
All of them can retain both positions, since the recent 
congress decision provides that at least nine of the Executive 
Bureau members should not have a government position. 
  Eleven Executive Bureau members currently meet this 
requirement. Papandreou now has to name those who will 
participate in the Executive Bureau's Political Bureau and in 
the Executive Secretariat. 
  After the outcome of the voting: 
  -- Simitis said blocking mechanisms had operated, thus 
indirectly accusing Tsokhatzopoulos' side. He wished that the 
Central Committee "would realize that more unity is necessary." 
  -- Vaso Papandreou noted that the congress had one view and 
the Central Committee another. In the same spirit, Pangalos 
said that the organized base of the party thought differently 
than the Central Committee. 
  -- Oikonomou, who was not elected, spoke about "the 
aristocracy of mediocrity." Thessaloniki Deputy Kastanidhis 
noted that some members who are distinguished in society were 
not elected, while the opposite happened with others. He said 
this is because "mechanisms of mediocrity" prevail.

    [Editorial Report] The recent congress of the New Democracy 
(ND) party was the subject of commentary in the Greek press. 
<H5>  Party Officials' Attitudes </H5>
  In anticipation of the congress, the 19 April Athens daily 
TA 
NEA published a commentary by Yiannis Politis characterizing the 
attitudes of various ND officials. ND Vice President Yiannis 
Varvitsiotis, Politis wrote, will be ND leader Miltiadhis 
Evert's "most faithful Supporter" and will advocate party unity. 
Another ND official, Yiannis Kefaloyiannis, is accusing Evert 
of engineering the Varvitsiotis vice presidency without previous 
consultation and of ignoring the party's statutes. For his 
part, Stefanos Manos states that "he will never undermine Evert 
or participate in plots against him," despite the fact that 
relations between the two have never been good, according to 
Politis. Manos, Politis commented, makes no secret of his 
ambition to become party leader but has confided to friends that 
"he can wait as long as necessary, given that leaders are no 
longer permanent." Evert's ideological opponent in the party is 
Andreas Andrianopoulos, Politis continued. While Andrianopoulos 
knows that his "neoliberal" positions have little resonance 
within the party, he nevertheless wishes to "preserve them for 
the future" after it becomes clear that "Statism has been 
overtaken." 
<H5>  Poll on ND </H5>
  The 21 April Athens daily I KATHIMERINI published the 
results 
of a 15-16 April poll conducted by the MARTEL organization in 
the Greater Athens area among 800 individuals. Poll results 
showed that when queried on what the ND should be as a party 
after the congress, 27.2 percent stated that it should be "from 
somewhat to completely similar" to the 1990-93 period, while a 
majority of 66.2 percent said that it should be "totally 
different." Some 6.6 percent did not know or did not answer. 
<H5>  Profile of Party "Elite" </H5>
  Yiannis Mavris comments on the results of a January-April 
1993 poll on the ND's profile commissioned by the "Flash" radio 
station and conducted among high government and party officials 
of the 1981-1993 period. Of the 125 respondents, 54 (43.2 
percent) were members of the ND. Their answers were published in 
the 23 April I KATHIMERINI. Poll data revealed that the average 
age of the ND leadership "elite" is 48. Some 59 percent of 
these officials have a public school education, and the rest 
come from private institutions. According to Mavris, this 
differentiates Greece from other West Europe countries, where 
political "elites" are shaped by "compartmented and very 
specific school mechanisms." Some 84 percent either lived or 
studied abroad. A total of 32 percent have a doctoral degree 
and 30 percent hold a graduate degree. Some 38 percent studied 
in Great Britain, 17 percent in the United States, and 14 
percent in France. In general, Mavris continues, the ND "elites" 
have not entered politics due to family tradition, since 72 
percent stated they have no relatives in politics. Many 
officials entered politics through youth party organizations (31 
percent), with 26 percent reporting they entered politics before 
the age of 25. However, 33 percent said they entered politics 
after they were 40. It should be noted that 39 
percent--compared to 16 percent for the Panhellenic Socialist 
Movement (PASOK)--held a position in the private sector before 
entering politics. 
  The poll asked officials to positions themselves on the 
ideological-- political spectrum. The great majority (63.6 
percent) declared themselves "liberals," 18.2 percent said they 
are "neoliberals," 2.3 percent described themselves as 
"conservatives," 11.4 percent said they believe in "other 
ideologies," and 4.5 percent said they are "social democrats." 
Respondents were given three choices when asked to state their 
preference for other parties worldwide. Some 60 percent said 
they feel closest to the U.S. Democratic Party, 52.5 percent to 
the British Conservative Party, 50 percent to the German 
Christian Democrats, 35 percent to the U.S. Republican Party, 20 
percent to the German Social Democrats, and 12.5 percent to 
France's Gaullists. 
<H5>  Andrianopoulos Dissents </H5>
  According to Yiannis Politis writing in the 26 April TA NEA, 
Andreas Andrianopoulos strongly dissented from the congress' 
decisions to reject neoliberalism as a party tendency. While 
Evert is cited as saying that party officials are henceforth 
duty bound to respect the decisions of the congress and that 
ideological dissenters essentially put themselves "outside the 
party," Andriansopoulos stated on 25 April that he "never made a 
secret of his opinions" and charged that developments in the 
congress "risk opening the way for dangerous new party 
formations." Politis noted, however, that according to his 
information Andrianopoulos will make no move before the European 
Parliament elections, which will test the popularity of the ND's 
ideology. 
  An interview with Andriansopoulos by Takis Mikhas appeared 
in 
the 21 April Athens daily ELEVTHEROTIPIA. Andrianopoulos said 
he did not agree with the ND's insistence on "consensus," noting 
that the "consensus" the ND accepts means that "we are all 
traveling in the same train, whose route, however, is determined 
by the government." "Consensus" on the economy, Ansdrianopoulos 
continued, means agreeing with the government that funds must be 
collected to plug the deficit while ignoring ballooning 
governmenst expenditures. In foreign policy, Andrianopoulos 
said that he disagrees with the ND's approval of the 
government's policy on "national Issues," despite Evert's 
statement that dissent is almost equal to "treason." Never 
before in recent Greek history, Andrianopoulos charged, has 
Greece been so isolated in the Balkans, Europe, and the world, 
first because of Athens' pro-Serbian stance and secondly because 
of what is interpreted as an inimical Greek attitude on the 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM). Speaking on the 
government--imposed, ND--approved embargo on the FYROM, 
Andrianopoulos termed the measure "catastrophic" and predicted 
it will lead to an "impasse." 
<H5>  Evert Statement Stirs Party Tensions </H5>
  In the 28 April TA NEA, Politis reports that new tensions 
arose within the ND following Evert's 27 April statement on SKY 
radio that the ND is not yet ready to assume the reins of 
government by demanding new elections, even if the party makes a 
strong showing in the Euroelections. Evert's rationale, Politis 
notes, is that the ND must first prepare itself to deal 
efficiently with the problems the country faces. In a harsh 
reaction to the statement, ND officials who support former Prime 
Minister Mitsotakis charged that it "fails to provide a vision 
and a goal" for Euroelection voters. 
<H5>  Congress Assessed </H5>
  Katerina Koletsi drew conclusions from the ND congress in a 
28 April ELEVTHEROTIPIA commentary. Evert's goal for the 
congress, she wrote, was to change "Mitsotakis' ND" into his own 
party, which harkens back to its "Karamanlist" past. While 
Evert achieved his goal at the congress, Koletsi continued, he 
had not foreseen that Mitsotakis and his large bloc of 
supporters, encouraged by ND official Dora Bakoyanniis strong 
showing, would criticize him, that Andrianopoulos would react so 
negatively to the rule forbidding neoliberalism as party 
ideology, that while stating he is not a neoliberal, Manos would 
disagree with Evert's decisions, and that Yiorgos Souflias would 
express his concern about the party's course in the coming 
months. 
  While at the three-day congress "forces were registered, 
fronts determined, foes revealed, alliances concluded, and the 
ND assumed the Evert identity," the "absence of political 
contact between party officials" also became evident, Koletsi 
said. The party, she concluded, is "walking on a tightrope, 
united only in appearance, a unity that will endure only until 
the final confrontation."

  [Text] For the first time in the history of the Ministry of 
Defense, a Defense Council that will play the role of adviser to 
the defense minister is planned. The council will be constituted 
by both active and retired military officers, diplomats, experts 
in international affairs, and university professors. The 
establishment of the Defense Council is envisioned in a bill 
that will be submitted to the Chamber of Deputies for approval. 
According to information our newspaper has received, the 
council's exclusive responsibility will be planning the 
ministry's strategy, not only in times of crisis, but also under 
normal circumstances. The council will also elaborate proposals 
on weapons issues. 
  Minister of Defense Yerasimos Arsenis is seeking the 
agreement of all political parties. To this end, he will soon 
invite to the ministry the various party representatives, who 
will present their views on the council's field of competence 
and the choice of council members. The same bill, which aims at 
giving a more civilian configuration to the ministry of defense, 
creates the position of secretary general, which will be 
occupied by a civilian. 
  If the bill is approved by the Chamber of Deputies under its 
present form, it will be the second time that a secretariat 
general is established at the Ministry of Defense. The first 
time was in 1985, but the position did not function properly 
because the responsibilities of the secretary general were 
constantly clashing with those of the chief of the general 
staff. Finally, the bill envisions the upgrading of the role of 
the chief of the general staff, who would henceforth play the 
role of a "field marshal," since his responsibilities would 
include the coordination of the three branches of the service in 
wartime as well as in peacetime.

  [Text] Political support is growing for the 
decriminalisation of drug use as investigations continue into a 
lethal supply of pure heroin that has caused the deaths of at 
least eight addicts this week. 
  Environment Minister Konstandinos Laliotis, a senior deputy 
of the ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement, yesterday 
expressed support for the controlled distribution of drug 
substitutes such as methadone as part of a comprehensive 
rehabilitation programme. 
  His remarks during a radio interview found support from 
party 
officials across the political spectrum. A major overhaul of 
drug policies and their enforcement is expected to be announced 
next week. 
  Justice Minister Yeoryios Kouvelakis, meanwhile, has issued 
a 
directive to all prison officials banning the granting of prison 
leave to convicted drug dealers. It was prompted after drug 
kingpin Adem Huseinoglu, serving a 22-year sentence in Patras, 
failed to return after a five-day leave. 
  The recent heroin deaths have shocked Greeks, with surveys 
showing there are an estimated 400,000 users of hard drugs in 
Greece.

  [Text] Vienna, May 17 (AFP) -- German Foreign Minister 
Klaus Kinkel insisted Tuesday [17 May] that Russia must not be 
granted an official veto over whether Eastern and Central 
European countries join NATO. 
  He said this rule also should apply to membership of the 
Western European Union, effectively the military wing of the 
European Union. 
  Kinkel was in Vienna with his Dutch counterpart, Pieter 
Kooijmans, to present a joint initiative on strengthening the 
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) in the 
area of conflict prevention. 
  Speaking at a press conference, they expressed hope that the 
plan would be approved at a CSCE summit in December in Budapest. 
  Kinkel said that in the wake of the Cold War, Eastern and 
Central European countries needed to avoid "new divisions" and 
that this was why NATO's Partnership for Peace [PFP] plan was 
open to both Russia and them. 
  The Russians, he noted, want to join the partnership but 
"are 
seeking certain specific rules in their negotiations with the 
alliance." 
  The plan offers military cooperation in a number of areas 
between NATO and mainly the former Warsaw Pact countries but 
stops short of offering full membership any time soon. 
  It was conceived in January by the United States as a way to 
respond to Eastern European countries' pleas for greater 
security at a time of political volatility and growing 
nationalism in Russia without alienating Russia itself. 
  On the CSCE, Kooijmans said one of the main goals of the 
German- Dutch initiative was to boost the CSCE as a regional 
organization to help the United Nations. 
  "When we see that the United Nations is not in a position to 
do everything asked of it around the world, it is important to 
consolidate regional organizations to help the United Nations," 
Kooijmans said.

<F P=106> [Interview with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali by </F>
correspondent Franz-Olivier Giesbert in the Paris studio -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Giesbert] Good morning, Butrus Butrus-Ghali. 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Good morning. 
  [Giesbert] The United Nations is taking a lot of flak right 
now. You will have heard what [Prime Minister] Edouard Balladur 
and [Foreign Minister] Alain Juppe have said: If things continue 
like this in Bosnia, we shall withdraw our peacekeeping troops. 
What do you think about this? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] I think that any peacekeeping operation must 
be of limited duration, and that we must encourage the 
protagonists in the conflict to find a peaceful solution as 
quickly as possible, because there is fatigue on the part of the 
member states, on both the military front and the financial 
front. 
  [Giesbert] What will happen if France puts its threat into 
action? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] It is for the Security Council to decide what 
we must look at, to which troops we should turn to replace the 
troops that wish to leave. A similar operation was conducted in 
Somalia, where the French, American, German, and Belgian troops 
withdrew, and we were able to continue the operation with 
African and Asian troops. 
  [Giesbert] You saw Francois Mitterrand yesterday, as well as 
Edouard Balladur. Did they tackle you about it? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] No, on the contrary; I received support from 
both the prime minister and the president for the action the 
United Nations is taking worldwide, whether in Angola, 
Mozambique, Rwanda, Burundi -- more or less throughout the world. 
  [Giesbert] But in order to make progress in this matter of 
Bosnia, should one not in fact send more peacekeeping troops? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Yes, but if the states do not wish to do 
this, 
then we are dealing with an established fact. We have to try to 
continue with our action with the number of peacekeeping troops 
at our disposal at the moment. 
  [Giesbert] With regard to your action in Bosnia, when you 
are 
accused, as happens often, of playing the Serbian card, how do 
you answer this? You have a representative there who is very 
fond of the Serbs. 
  [Butrus-Ghali] No, not at all. We are neutral, we represent 
the international community. Our presence there is made up of 
French troops, British troops, Egyptian troops, Jordanian 
troops. You have an international group, it is a multinational 
force, and the decisions which are adopted are not decisions 
adopted by one or two states. They are adopted by 15 states, 
including the five big powers. So, we cannot be accused of 
subjectivity in so far as we are implementing decisions which 
are adopted by the international community. 
  [Giesbert] You are not being accused of subjectivity, Mr. 
Secretary General, but your representative there is accused of 
subjectivity. 
  [Butrus-Ghali] No, it is not true. The representative who is 
on the spot is applying the recommendations and the resolutions 
which are adopted by the member states of the United Nations, 
and it is a normal thing that the various protagonists are going 
to accuse us of subjectivity when this or that action is not in 
keeping with their particular objectives. 
  [Giesbert] The Bosnians are howling. 
  [Butrus-Ghali] The Bosnians are howling, the Serbs are 
howling, the Croats are howling, and we have had problems with 
all three protagonists at different moments. 
  [Giesbert] What about the basic question raised by the 
Bosnia 
problem, because you are accused of many things, but in the 
final analysis, you do not have the necessary means? Does this 
not raise the question of this real army which the United 
Nations ought to have, a real army which would be capable of 
making war? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] I agree, but this real army depends on the 
willingness of the member states. The United Nations does not 
have an army, arms, or the financial resources to be able to 
act, if the member states do not decide that this should be the 
case. 
  [Giesbert] And what do the member states say? They say if we 
cannot do that, it is because of the United Nations. In other 
words, you are being used as a scapegoat. 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Yes, certainly the United Nations is often 
used as a scapegoat, but I believe everyone knows very well 
that, in the final analysis, when a resolution which demands 
10,000 men is adopted by the Security Council and we are unable 
to obtain the 10,000 men, this is not the fault of the UN 
Secretariat. It is due to the fact that the member countries do 
not wish to put the 10,000 men demanded by the Security Council 
resolution at the UN Secretariat's disposal. Or, alternatively, 
if members of the United Nations, after having put certain 
forces at UN disposal, decide to withdraw these forces, then I 
have no means of preventing these members from withdrawing their 
forces. 
  [Giesbert] You, the secretary general, the United Nations, 
are insulted all the time. There are even French ministers who 
say it is this, it is that. There is talk of impotence, 
cowardice -- do you have the impression that you are being 
supported in your action? For example, do the states willingly 
help the United Nations -- in all ways, I am not just talking 
about financially? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] No, no, no, the financial problem is another 
aspect of the problem. States do not pay their contribution. 
The United States owes us more than a billion dollars, so we 
have financial difficulties. 
  [Giesbert] Are you saying that it is in fact the Third World 
that pays the United Nations? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] To a certain extent it is the Third World 
which sends the troops, but obviously the logistics, the means 
of transporting these troops, the arms required for these 
troops, the means of communication, are those of the big states. 
  [Giesbert] Mr. Secretary General, let us talk about Rwanda 
now. There is a dual genocide taking place there, and all that 
you are doing at the United Nations in the end is to reduce the 
contingent. 
  [Butrus-Ghali] No, we are not reducing the contingent. Here 
again we are talking about a decision by the Security Council. 
I gave a report to the Security Council... 
  [Giesbert, interrupting] In other words, it is not you? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] On the contrary. [sentence as heard] I asked 
the Security Council to replace immediately...[pauses] To give 
you an example, the Belgian troops withdrew, and they have the 
right to withdraw, because the contribution is a voluntary one. 
I read a report to the Security Council, calling on it as a 
first option to replace the Belgian troops immediately by other 
troops. 
  [Giesbert] In other words, you are the UN Secretariat 
General. In other words, it does not care about anyone else. 
  [Butrus-Ghali] No, the member states made a choice, but if 
the United Nations is to be used as a black sheep and this helps 
the member nations, then highlighted whereas the successful 
operations are generally overlooked] 
  [Giesbert] You still have a lot of work on your plate. For 
example, as an Arab, are you not afraid of what is going to 
happen in Algeria? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] No, at present Algeria is a matter of an 
internal conflict. But if the Algerian Government should ever 
ask for our assistance, then we are ready to give it -- just 
like any other country, just as the Georgian Government asked 
for our help. We have observers on the spot helping to find a 
solution to the conflict between the Georgians and the 
Abkhazians. [passage omitted] 
  [Giesbert] Thank you, Mr. Secretary General. I wish you 
success and a good day. 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Thank you.

<F P=106> [EC Information Memo No. MEMO/94/32: "Negotiations on the </F>
Accession of Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway to the 
European Union -- Summary of the Results"] 
  [Excerpts] 
<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  Following applications made by Austria, Sweden, Finland, and 
Norway to join the European Communities, accession negotiations 
with Austria, Sweden, and Finland were opened officially on the 
1 February 1993 and with Norway on the 5 April 1993. The 
negotiations with the candidates were conducted in parallel, at 
various levels, in the framework of separate conferences meeting 
at ministerial or deputies (ambassadors) level. As the Treaty 
of European Union entered into force on 1 November 1993 they 
were formally transformed into negotiations for accession to the 
European Union. The negotiations on an important number of 
chapters were facilitated by the existence of the free trade 
agreements between the Community and the candidates, and the 
recent entry into force of the European Economic Area Agreement 
whereby the candidate countries were already committed to take 
over in their national legislation most of the acquis concerning 
the single market. A basic principle of the negotiations was 
the requirement that the candidate countries should accept the 
actual and potential rights and obligations attaching to the 
Community system, its legislation and its institutional 
framework -- the Community acquis -- subject (if necessary) to 
technical adjustments and exceptionally to temporary (not 
permanent) derogations and transitional arrangements. 
  The negotiations were concluded at the political level with 
Austria, Sweden, and Finland on the 1 March 1994 and with 
Norway, slightly later, on the 16 March owing to the need to 
negotiate further on some remaining issues, notably fisheries. 
Following this political agreement between the Union and the 
candidates on all points raised by them, the final outstanding 
chapter, institutions, was settled by the Union at Ioannina on 
the 27 March 1994. The accession conferences then agreed on all 
negotiating chapters on the 30 March. It was then necessary to 
put these political agreements into legal form for the 
establishment of the instruments of accession (a treaty, an act 
of accession with annexes and protocols, declarations). Texts 
were being drafted as negotiations progressed, and eventually 
were agreed upon at the final session of the accession 
conferences at deputy level on the 12 April 1994. 
  What follows is a general description of the outcome of 
negotiations, without being exhaustive, in the main chapters. 
<H5>  Free Movement of Goods </H5>
  One of the major concerns of the applicant countries during 
the negotiations was to maintain a high level of health, safety, 
and environmental standards after accession. It became clear, 
however, during detailed expert discussions that the scope of 
the difference between their own regulations and the EC 
provisions was relatively limited. For a number of exceptional, 
well-justified cases, it was agreed that each acceding country 
could maintain its national rules for a transitional period of 
four years. The derogations, which vary in coverage between the 
four countries, relate to the classification, packaging and 
labelling of pesticides and certain other dangerous substances, 
the marketing and use of certain chemical products (including 
cadmium, arsenic, pentachlorophenol) and the composition of 
fertilizers and batteries. The enforcement of the national 
rules during the transitional period must not be achieved by 
means of border control. During the transitional period the EC 
provisions will be reviewed according to normal procedures and 
at the end of the period the acquis will apply to the new member 
states in the same way as to the present member states. [passage 
omitted] 
<H5>  Road Transit -- Austria </H5>
  The problem of transit through Austria by heavy lorries was 
one of the most important subjects in the negotiations with 
Austria -- perhaps the most sensitive subject in Austrian public 
opinion. 
  Heavy goods vehicles normally enjoy unrestricted passage 
through member states of the Union, provided that they comply 
with the rules on weights, dimensions and so on. However, in 
view of the environmental threat to the alpine passes, and the 
narrow valleys leading to them, the Community had concluded in 
1992 a bilateral agreement with Austria to control the number of 
vehicles by means of an "Ecopoint" system of transit licences. 
In the accession negotiations, Austria requested a special 
derogation so that this agreement could be continued after 
membership. It was agreed, therefore -- and this was the last 
and most important problem to be solved in the negotiations with 
Austria -- that the essential objective of the transit agreement 
will be honoured, namely the reduction (by 60 percent by the end 
of the year 2003) of pollution from heavy lorries in transit 
through Austria. In addition, other measures to deal with the 
transit problem will be accelerated, including the creation of 
extra rail capacity, and a decision on the construction of a new 
tunnel under the Brenner pass. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Environment </H5>
  In respect of the conservation of natural habitats, wild 
fauna and flora, and wild birds, a number of adaptations are 
made to EC provisions, reflecting the specific environmental 
conditions and the different conservation status of certain 
animal and plant species in the acceding countries. [passage 
omitted] 
  Austria can maintain its provisions on the import, export 
and 
transit of waste for a transitional period of two years. Norway 
is granted a transitional period until 1997 for the application 
of EC provisions on pollution caused by waste from the titanium 
dioxide industry. Austria, Norway, and Sweden may maintain 
their bans on the recycling of polychlorinated byphenyls and 
polychlorinated terphenyls (pcbs/pcts). 
<H5>  Energy </H5>
  Discussions under this heading concentrated on the question 
to what extent different national energy policies in the 
candidate countries could be continued after accession. 
  In particular, some of the implications of membership of 
EURATOM [European Atomic Energy Community] caused concern among 
candidates, given that for instance Austria has by law rejected 
the use of nuclear energy, that Sweden intends to do so in a 
number of years and that Norway does not have any commercial 
nuclear installations. 
  Furthermore, the Treaty transfers certain competencies from 
national authorities to the EURATOM supply agency in the field 
of trade in nuclear materials and to the Commission as regards 
safeguard measures concerning the use of these materials, all 
matters of a highly sensitive political nature in the countries 
concerned. To meet the concerns of the candidates on these and 
other points, the following was agreed upon: 

  -  A joint 
declaration relating to Austria, Sweden, and Norway noting that 
member states are free to decide whether or not to produce 
nuclear energy according to their specific policy 
orientation; 
  -  The recognition that Articles 105 and 106 of the 
EURATOM Treaty allow agreements and contracts concluded before 
accession to continue unchanged; 
  -  A joint declaration concerning 
the fulfillment by Sweden of obligations under the 
Non-Proliferation Treaty; 
  -  A transitional period of two years for 
Austria, Finland, and Sweden to implement the "acquis" on basic 
safety standards for health protection against the danger of 
ionizing radiation. 

  A separate question was the Norwegian demand concerning 
sovereignty over petroleum resources. This demand was met by a 
protocol recognizing this sovereignty within the limits of 
Community law. Finland was granted a transitional period of one 
year to implement the obligation to maintain minimum stocks of 
crude oil and/or petroleum products. 
<H5>  Agriculture </H5>
  Agriculture naturally involved detailed and difficult 
negotiations in view of accession, because it is the economic 
sector in which the acceding countries will have to make the 
biggest adjustments as a result of membership. 
  Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway each have a distinctive 
national system of support for agriculture, which -- unlike the 
industrial sector -- never figured in their mutual free trade 
under EFTA [European Free Trade Association]. The objectives of 
their national policies, similar to those of the Union's Common 
Agricultural Policy, have been to support the incomes of 
farmers, maintain rural society, and ensure security of food 
supplies. [passage omitted] 
  In the negotiations, therefore, the main problems to be 
resolved were: 

  -  The transitional period for agricultural 
prices requested by Austria, Finland, and Norway; 
  -  The adaptation 
of the instruments of the Common Agricultural Policy in such a 
way as to take account of the particular problems of the new 
members. 

  The Union insisted that, in view of the single market, and 
the need to avoid border controls for trade between member 
states in the enlarged Union, the acceding countries should 
adopt common agricultural prices immediately on accession, 
without a progressive adaptation of prices (accompanied by 
charges on trade between members) as was the case in previous 
enlargements. The acceptance of this principle by Finland, 
Austria, and Norway was a key stage in the final round of 
negotiations. It was accompanied by: 

  -  Agreement on the 
payment of national aids to farmers in those countries, to 
compensate for the reduction of prices; these aids, payable over 
a period of five years, will be degressive, and their cost to 
the national budgets will be offset by a special 
"agro-budgetary" contribution from the Community over four 
years. 
  -  The introduction of a "safeguard clause", for rapid 
action by the European Commission in case of disruption of their 
markets for agriculture and food as a result of the opening of 
free trade with other members of the Union. 

  In addition to these transitional measures, many technical 
adjustments were agreed to the Union's rules on agricultural 
markets, structural policy, and so on, to permit the full and 
effective implementation of the Common Agricultural Policy in 
the new member states. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Fisheries </H5>
  The fisheries issue, particularly with respect to Norway, 
was 
one of the more difficult and complex subjects of the 
negotiation. This was the result of the need, on the one hand 
to incorporate into the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) a large 
fishing nation that had developed its own comprehensive approach 
to fisheries policy and, on the other hand to find solutions to 
a number of internal concerns of the Union in this sector. In 
this connection it has to be recognised that Norway has 
developed a sophisticated and high quality fisheries policy and 
that it was in the common interest to maintain certain aspects 
of it in order to safeguard the sustainable management of 
resources. 
  On the assumption that new entrants cannot be better treated 
than existing member states, on the key issue of access to 
waters it was necessary to agree that Norway, Sweden, and 
Finland should be subject, where relevant, to a regime 
equivalent to that currently applied to Spain and Portugal for a 
transitional period. In practice, this transitional regime 
will, overall, enable the new member states and the present 
Union to maintain the status quo in the Baltic and the North Sea 
in their fishing relations until the Community establishes a CFP 
that is uniform for all member states and until the adoption of 
a Community fishing permit system, external trade and customs 
Union. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  External Trade </H5>
  External trade was one of the less difficult chapters of the 
negotiations. The acceding countries agreed to apply the common 
external tariff immediately on their accession, with some very 
limited exceptions for Finland and Norway, which may reduce some 
higher tariffs progressively over a period of three years, and 
will benefit from a duty-free quota for imports of styrene for 
five years. 
  The new members will become parties, immediately on 
accession, to all the Union's international agreements with 
nonmember countries, and will apply them according to the normal 
rules. However, in cases where it is necessary to adapt these 
agreements to take account of enlargement (for example, the 
textile quotas) the necessary negotiations will be undertaken 
with the third countries before accession. 
  In response to the request of Sweden, Finland, and Norway to 
maintain their free trade arrangements with the Baltic States 
(Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania), the Union promised to do its best 
to ensure that the Union's new trade agreements with those 
countries, already proposed by the Commission, will be in force 
by the date of enlargement. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Institutions </H5>
  The appropriate adjustments to the institutions of the Union 
were made on the basis of existing institutional provisions in 
the Treaty on the Union. Consequently, in the European 
Parliament the total of members will be increased by 74 to 641 
(Sweden 22, Austria 21, Finland 16, and Norway 19). In the 
Council the current weighing of member states' votes is 
maintained, in addition Sweden and Austria will have four votes 
each and Finland and Norway three votes each. The qualified 
majority is fixed at 64, which maintains the current balance. 
The Commission is to be increased from 17 to 21, with one 
additional member to be designated by each new member state.

  [Excerpt] Brussels (DPA) -- Germany plans to ratify the 
membership treaties of Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway with 
the European Union [EU] before the Bundestag elections in 
October. This was stated by Ursula Seiler-Albring, state 
minister in the Foreign Ministry in Bonn, in Brussels on Monday 
[16 May]. During a break in the meeting of the EU foreign 
ministers, the state minister stressed that Germany thus wants 
to make sure that the four new members will be accepted as of 1 
January 1995 in any case. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "European Union: Martino Meets </F>
Delors"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Brussels, May 16 -- Italy's new Foreign 
Minister Antonio Martino met with European Commission President 
Jacques Delors Monday morning [16 May] and assured him that 
"Italy's European vocation will not diminish." 
  "I confirmed to Delors that the fundamental lines of our 
country's European policy will not change," Martino told the 
press after his 25-minute meeting with the executive Commission 
chief. 
  During their meeting, Martino explained the current 
political 
situation to Delors, saying that last March's general election 
"did not represent a victory for the right so much as a victory 
for an alternating system in which there is a governing majority 
and a minority which keeps checks on what it does, while 
preparing to take its place." 
  Answering journalists' questions about a recent statement in 
which Belgian Deputy Premier Elio Di Rupo criticised the 
presence of "neo-fascist ministers" in the Italian government, 
Martino said "I share Di Rupo's opinion: I would never have 
entered a government with neofascists either. But in this 
government there are no neofascist ministers. There are five 
from National Alliance, which is different from the Italian 
Social Movement, which in its turn was not the Fascist Party." 
  National Alliance was born last year out of the Italian 
Social Movement, but two out of the five National Alliance 
ministers joined the new party without ever belonging to the old 
one. 
  Top-ranking sources at the Commission confirmed that "the 
foreign minister came to reassure us and dealt with the issue of 
National Alliance ministers in government. Martino stressed 
that the "basic lines of foreign policy will not change." 
  According to Martino, a victory for the left in last March's 
elections would have meant a return to the old power-sharing 
system of government "similar to the one which recent electoral 
changes were designed to eliminate." 
  Martino met Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Mahmud Musa 
yesterday evening for talks on the Mideast situation, and is 
expected to hold bilateral talks with foreign ministers Klaus 
Kinkel of Germany, Alain Juppe of France and Douglas Hurd of 
Britain during his stay in Brussels for the regular monthly 
meeting of EU [European Union] diplomatic chiefs. 
  The new Italian foreign minister has been dubbed a 
"Euro-skeptic" by the British press which cites his friendship 
with former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and his 
membership of her mainly anti-EU Bruges Group. 
  Martino also focused his attention on economic matters 
during 
his official debut in Brussels, saying that the new government 
would now have to study carefully the decision of its 
predecessor to place reservations on its approval of the 1995 EU 
budget. 
  "It is a problem that we have inherited... We have revised 
our national accounts and gross national product system, 
something which other countries have not yet done," said 
Martino. "We are going to end up paying more. We are currently 
trying to overhaul our finances, which means holding down public 
spending and therefore stopping it from increasing." 
  Italy recently became a net contributor to the EU, paying 
more to Brussels than it receives from it. The refusal to 
approve the 1995 budget gave Italy a lever in difficult 
negotiations over milk quotas. 
  On the topic of the EU loan to Italy, the third two billion 
ECU tranche of which can now be released if Italy meets certain 
economic goals, was also dealt with by Martino who said "it is 
going to be up to the government and to the treasury minister in 
particular to decide" whether to ask for the money. 
  "I have always seen this loan as being rather like a letter 
of intents from the International Monetary Fund which, as 
everybody knows, is not drawn up and imposed by the IMF but 
drawn up and requested by governments so that they are obliged 
to do things that they would have had to do anyway," said the 
foreign minister.

<F P=106> [Interview with European Commission President Jacques Delors </F>
by "A.Bo." in Brussels on 16 May: "Delors: Martino Wanted To 
Reassure Me -- But I Am Prudent, I Will Judge From the Facts" -- 
first paragraph is CORRIERE DELLA SERA introduction] 
  [Text] Brussels -- Jacques Delors remained cautious. Even 
after his personal meeting with [Italian Foreign Minister] 
Martino, the president of the European Commission was not thrown 
off balance: "The new foreign minister strove to reassure me 
that Italy will pursue its traditional policies in the European 
field. This is all. I have noted what he had to say," he 
stated to a small group of journalists in a corridor at European 
Council headquarters. 
  [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] Do you indeed feel reassured, Mr. 
President? 
  [Delors] I am a prudent man. Experience has taught me to 
judge from facts, not words. On the other hand, I do not want 
to call intentions into question. 
  [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] What assurances or guarantees have you 
requested from Minister Antonio Martino as regards the 
continuity of Italian policies? 
  [Delors] None. In fact, what articles of the Community 
treaties could I have invoked in order to put his Europeanism to 
the test? I am certainly not a teacher examining students and 
giving out marks. This is not my role. 
  [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] Early in the year you met [Prime 
Minister] Silvio Berlusconi in Brussels. Did you discuss 
politics with him, or did you receive him simply as a private 
businessman? 
  [Delors] Yes, I met Mr. Berlusconi, but only in his capacity 
as a businessman. Of course, I asked him for his opinion -- as 
a businessman -- of the economic situation in Italy. But we did 
not discuss politics. If anything, we talked about movies and 
Cinecitta [film studios in Rome], a subject I am very interested 
in. 
  [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] Are you now planning to meet 
Berlusconi 
in his capacity as head of the new Italian Government before the 
European summit in Corfu? 
  [Delors] There are no meetings scheduled. On the other hand, 
I believe Mr. Berlusconi's agenda is very, very full.

Praised"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Athens, May 13 -- The appointment of Antonio 
Martino as Italy's foreign minister "was the best choice that 
could be made," assistant Greek Foreign Minister, responsible 
for European affairs, Theodhoros Pangalos said to the press here 
on Friday [13 May]. 
  The Greek diplomat went on to add "Mr. Martino is a person 
who stands out for his sincerity." 
  Following the results of the election in Italy at the end of 
March, the Greek minister for European affairs had voiced his 
reservations on Silvio Berlusconi as premier, opinions which 
were amplified by the Italian press. 
  Greece currently holds the rotating European Union

<F P=106> [David Gardner report: "Sutherland Ready To Join Race for </F>
EU Presidency"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- The race to succeed Mr Jacques Delors 
as president of the European Commission was joined last night by 
Mr Peter Sutherland the Irish director-general of the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), who signalled he was 
available for the job. 
  Mr Sutherland, whose leadership at GATT was instrumental in 
securing the Uruguay Round world trade liberalisation deal, 
recently said he would be stepping down at the end of the year. 
  "If I was asked the question about being a candidate (for 
the 
Commission presidency) by a member state then I would have to 
give it serious consideration," Mr Sutherland said. 
  He told RTE, Irish television, that "it's an entirely 
hypothetical situation." But he stressed twice that "it's a 
very important position for Ireland, for Europe and the world." 
  Mr Sutherland's candidacy opens up a field which includes Mr 
Ruud Lubbers, the outgoing Dutch prime minister, Mr Jean-Luc 
Dehaene, the Belgian premier, and Sir Leon Brittan, the senior 
British commissioner in charge of the EU's [European Union] 
external economic relations. 
  The Irishman, a successful competition commissioner in 
Brussels in 1984-88, is a plausible if long-shot compromise. 
But he must pick up endorsements from leading member states -- 
particularly Germany -- and win the support of Dublin. The EU's 
12 heads of government are expected to decide on Mr Delors' 
successor at their summit in Corfu on June 24-25. 
  It is understood that of the larger member states, only 
Spain 
has so far sounded out Mr Sutherland. The GATT chief has a 
Spanish wife, and a Commission president from Ireland, which is 
a member of the "Cohesion" group of the four poorest member 
states including Spain, Portugal and Greece, would be a useful 
ally for Madrid. 
  Mr Lubbers remains the front-runner, but has less than warm 
relations with Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Mr Kohl is said by some 
leading EU officials to favour Mr Dehaene, who could also get 
backing from Paris. Sir Leon is hampered by being from the UK, 
which has opt-outs from the Maastricht Treaty.

  [Text] Paris (dpa) -- According to French Defense Minister 
Francois Leotard, a German-French arms agency could serve as a 
model for Europe. At the end of a meeting between scientists 
and the military in the Ecole Polytechnique, an elite academy in 
Palaiseau near Paris, he said on 18 May: "Cooperation does 
exist. It is Franco-German, with the plan to create a 
Franco-German agency" for the procurement of arms. 
  The French defense minister said it will above all aimed at 
standardizing the armaments of the European Corps that is 
currently being set up. A group of arms experts is currently 
examining the creation of a Franco-German research center in 
Palaiseau for efficient laser technology. The research 
capacities surrounding the Ecole Polytechnique will be given an 
opportunity to take part in development and technology transfer, 
said Leotard.

<F P=106> [Roger Boyes article: "Europe Under Germany"] </F>
  [Text] Amid the fireworks of reunification, Hans Dietrich 
Genscher, the grey fox of German diplomacy, made a promise to 
Bonn's worried neighbours. "Rest assured," he said, "you can 
expect a European Germany rather than a German Europe." Does 
anyone now remember that pledge? 
  Only weeks before Germany takes over the presidency of the 
European Union [EU], it is threatening to flout European law by 
banning British beef imports for fear of mad cow disease. Its 
politicians are grumbling loudly about Germany's budget 
contribution. Inside the country the mood is at its most 
Eurosceptical for four decades; all the major and minor parties 
are contesting the European elections with hard-nosed, 
nationally centred rhetoric. There is no sign of Herr 
Genscher's "European Germany." 
  Instead, the political class seems to have opted for a 
German 
Europe. The naked assertion of power abroad is replacing the 
frothy vision of Europa. Bonn has been quietly subverting the 
Greek EU presidency for months. It was the Foreign Minister, 
Klaus Kinkel, who threatened to break the spine of his Spanish 
colleagues unless they allowed the Scandinavian states into the 
Union. (Explanations for this rugged phrasing include: "a 
mistranslation", "just a joke" and "the minister's robust 
Swabian manner".) It was Germany, not Greece, which engineered 
the compromise on voting rights for the extended Union. And it 
was Chancellor Kohl who leaned most heavily on the European 
Parliament to admit the new boys from Scandinavia and Austria. 
Germany, in short, has taken charge. In July, it takes the job 
formally. 
  The French have noticeably lost ground in the past nine 
months. But Britain, which could have profited from these rifts, 
fumbled the issue of European voting rights, and the beneficiary 
was Germany, which is now the unchallenged protector of Central 
Europe within the Union. 
  This steady assertion of German power comes at a time when 
the country is relatively disadvantaged. It is hamstrung by 
elections, its economy is still in recession, its constitution 
limits its military posture abroad. By 1996, the economy should 
have recovered. The constitution will have been amended, or be 
open to more flexible interpretation about German missions 
abroad. The European Parliament will be more powerful, more 
federally inclined -- and more German. 
  The driving force behind this new definition of Germany 
within Europe is Chancellor Kohl. There are times when his 
physical bulk seems to be a metaphor for his country: not just 
big, but complicated, thin-skinned, slightly uncoordinated, 
capable of sitting out crises, perpetually tired yet capable of 
sudden bursts of energy. The Chancellor's Christian Democrats 
are catching up in the polls, gaining a second wind after 
lagging for months behind the Social Democrats. His room for 
electoral manoeuvre is limited, however. On most issues, there 
are no clear differences between the two parties. Increasingly, 
all seems to depend not on Kohl's utterances but on the success 
or failure of his small coalition partner, the Free Democrats, 
who may fail to capture the 5 per cent of votes needed for 
parliamentary representation. 
  So the battlefield has shifted to foreign grounds. Herr 
Kinkel, the Foreign Minister, is the Free Democrats' chairman. 
Herr Kohl is the supreme foreign policy maker. Together they 
can make a powerful point by running Europe. The federal 
European dream barely enters this calculation partly because it 
might scare away voters. Instead, Herr Kohl treats Europe as his 
personal playground, where he disports with "Dear John" and "My 
Friend Felipe," and of course "Cher Francois." Herr Kohl's 
message is clear: I am not only the Chancellor of reunification, 
but the fixed point around which Europe revolves. Remove me and 
this small universe collapses. 
  But what would happen to Europe if Herr Kohl were turfed out 
in October? The current betting is that either the Christian 
Democrat/Free Democrat alllance will survive, or that the Free 
Democrats will flounder and Herr Kohl will have to make common 
cause with the Social Democrats. Neither outcome would derail 
Germany's European policies. Only a Red-Green government could 
do that. 
  British Eurosceptic calculations about a changed European 
environment helping to bail out the Conservative Party are 
misplaced. Yes, Spain and Italy appear to be more sceptical 
than in the past; even Bavaria is striking different notes. But 
German interests are now clear: to build Europe into a bulwark 
of security against future buffeting; to expand the range of 
Europe and consolidate its institutions; and to create layers 
and layers of cushions between Germany and an unstable Russia. 
For the German political class, much more than in Britain, the 
Bosnian war has been a profound shock. Helplessness in the face 
of a European war has contributed far more to the current 
cynicism than the protracted debate about Maastricht. Fear of a 
collapsing Russia, rather than expansionism, is directing much 
of Germany's behaviour. So this new assertiveness in Europe 
should not worry Germanys partners. Better that the Continent 
has a strong heart than a weak stomach.

<F P=106> [Article signed GGD(LAU): "The Largest Belgian Air Base: </F>
More Than 60 Aircraft in the Heart of the Forest"] 
  [Excerpt] Weelde, 17 May (BELGA) -- On Tuesday [17 May], 
the Belgian Air Force opened up the doors of its surplus 
aircraft storage depot in Weelde (in the northeastern part of 
the province of Antwerp) to the press. In total, 38 "Mirage 
5's" and roughly 20 F-16's are stored there in ultramodern 
hangars. In fact, Weelde is the largest air base in Belgium, 
and it is there that combat aircraft await potential buyers. 
  "These aircraft have somehow plunged into lethargy," 
Lieutenant General Guido Vanhecke, the Air Force commander, 
said, addressing journalists from the Aviation Press Club (APC). 
  The so-called Delcroix Plan for restructuring the Armed 
Forces has obliged the Air Force to downgrade its latest 
"Mirage" hunter-bombers, 20 of which are currently being 
modernized, and to withdraw from service some 35 of its F-16's. 
While awaiting a potential buyer, preferably another state, 
these machines have been gathered in Weelde, at one of NATO's 
spare aerodromes. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Stephen Castle and Paul Routledge: "Blair Tops </F>
Leadership Poll"] 
  [Text] Opinion polls published today make Tony Blair the 
clear front-runner to succeed John Smith as the contest 
threatens to become a classic left-right Labour Party battle. 
  Robin Cook, the shadow trade and industry secretary, emerged 
yesterday as a likely challenger for the leadership, increasing 
the prospect of an ideological battle between the party's 
traditionalists and modernisers. 
  Mr Cook is seriously considering standing for the job left 
vacant by Mr Smith's death last week, his allies said. No final 
decision will be made before Mr Smith's funeral on Friday. 
  However polls by ICM [International Communications and 
Marketing Research] in today's SUNDAY EXPRESS, by Gallup in THE 
SUNDAY TELEGRAPH and a Mori telephone poll in THE SUNDAY TIMES 
all make Mr Blair, the shadow home secretary, the public's 
favourite to lead Labour. 
  He has a lead of between 11 and 15 percentage points over 
his 
closest rivals, John Prescott and Gordon Brown. Mr Blair's lead 
is smaller among Labour voters but remains substantial. Mr Cook 
is Bottom in every poll -- none gives him more than seven per 
cent. They were carried out after Mr Smith's death. 
  Mr Cook's probable candidature, made known before the polls 
were published, ensures at least one candidate from the party's 
left when the election takes place, almost certainly in July. 
John Prescott, the shadow employment secretary, could be 
another: his allies argued yesterday that Mr Cook's early 
apparent entry to the race could rebound on him. They can also 
point to today's opinion polls which show that Mr Prescott is 
far more popular than Mr Cook both among the public and among 
committed Labour voters. He is running second to Mr Blair both 
among the public at large and among Labour voters. 
  However, Mr Blair and Mr Brown, the leading contenders from 
the right, are looking increasingly reluctant to stand against 
each other. Mr Blair's firm lead in today's polls could create 
pressure on Mr Brown to stand down. But the shadow chancellor's 
supporters insist that he cannot be counted out of the race. 
  Some modernisers warn that traditionalist Labour members and 
trade unionists abhor the media "froth" in favour of Mr Blair. 
Under the "one member, one vote" system pushed through by Mr 
Smith last year, constituency Labour parties and trade unionists 
together make up two thirds of the electoral college. 
Supporters of Mr Brown argue that their man might have stronger 
backing among the mass membership. 
  The first signs of a potentially divisive battle began to 
emerge yesterday just as the acting leader, Margaret Beckett, 
tried to damp down electioneering. She appealed to the leading 
potential candidates not to speculate about the succession until 
after the European Parliament elections on 9 June. Labour 
sources said: "They have all agreed that this must be the case." 
But the self denying ordinance -- already under strain -- is 
likely to break down after Mr Smith's funeral service in 
Edinburgh on Friday. 
  Mr Brown and Mr Blair have met since Mr Smith's death but 
are 
unlikely to reach any agreement or pact until next week. 
  Supporters of both men believe it is vital to present one 
strong, modernising candidate who offers greater clarity, more 
radicalism and more specific policies than Mr Smith did, while 
building on his ability to include all shades of opinion. 
  Both are aware of the potential threat from Labour's 
traditionalists and the left, who were brought back into the 
fold by Mr Smith after the battles of the Kinnock years. 
  Mr Prescott's allies believe that the deputy leadership, now 
occupied by Mrs Beckett, could still be contested at the same 
time as the leadership. Mrs Beckett would, in any case, be open 
to a later challenge at the time of the party conference in 
October. However, the trade unions, who finance most of the 
estimated 1.5m pound cost of the election, are unlikely to want 
two separate contests, Mr Prescott's allies said. 
  That could revive talk of a Blair/Prescott dream ticket, 
earlier dismissed when it became clear that a July contest was 
the widespread wish of the party. Some senior Labour figures 
argue that Mrs Beckett could secure her position as deputy 
leader if she decided not to stand for the leadership.

<F P=106> [Roland Rudd report: "Events Hand PM a Chance"] </F>
  [Text] History is made by accidents. Early this week, few 
MPs were willing to bet on Mr John Major's leadership. 
Yesterday it was difficult to find any parliamentarian who did 
not believe the prime minister would last the course. 
  The death of John Smith appeared to wipe Mr Major's slate 
clean. True, there were still one or two right-wing Eurosceptics 
who warned that nothing, not even the death of the opposition 
leader, would alter their determination to replace the prime 
minister. 
  But they were in a minority. Most Tories felt that the 
positions of Mr Major and the government might be strengthened. 
  A senior member of the 1922 backbench committee said: "Luck 
appeared to be running out for the prime minister until the news 
of today's tragedy swept through the House." 
  In part, the analysis of Mr Major's strengthened position is 
based on the assumption that it would be folly to have a 
leadership election at the same time as the Labour party. 
  Whether the race to succeed Mr Smith takes place at a 
special 
conference in mid-summer or in the autumn, it would still be 
uncomfortably close to the November deadline by which the 
Conservatives have to hold a leadership election if there is a 
challenge. With the media's attention fixed on Labour, Tories 
believe they ought not to create distractions. Many hope that 
the Labour election will bring out the divisions that Mr Smith 
so successfully masked over. 
  Sir Rhodes Boyson, a senior backbencher, asked: "Will the 
face of moderation outlive the sad death of Mr Smith?" Mr John 
Watts, another Tory backbencher, readily conceded that Mr 
Smith's great achievement had been to make the Labour party 
electable. 
  But Mr Major's improved standing also owes much to the 
sudden 
decrease in support for Mr Michael Heseltine. Mr Smith's death 
was a vivid reminder of human mortality. Unfortunately for Mr 
Heseltine, most Tories no longer believe it prudent to elect 
someone who has already suffered a heart attack. 
  Mr Heseltine is said to have made a full recovery from the 
attack last summer. But the same was said about Mr Smith after 
an attack in 1988. 
  It was not just Mr Heseltine's enemies who were signalling 
the end of his ambitions. A significant number of his 
supporters were equally downcast. "Regardless of Michael's 
fitness," said one friend, "I fear the party will never elect 
him. John Smith's death has transformed the situation." 
  Some supporters of Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, found it 
difficult to conceal their relief that the chances of a 
leadership election had receded. One parliamentary private 
secretary said "Labour's loss is John Major's gain."

<F P=106> [Edward Gorman report: "MI6 Fears IRA May Obtain Missing </F>
Afghan Missiles"] 
  [Text] Kabul -- American attempts to control the black 
market in Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, first supplied eight 
years ago to rebels fighting the Soviet Union's Army in 
Afghanistan, are proving virtually futile. 
  Inquiries by THE TIMES in Afghanistan and Pakistan suggest 
hundreds of these highly sophisticated and deadly shoulder-held 
weapons have now gone astray in South Asia and the Middle East. 
A serious fear in British intelligence circles is that the IRA 
will succeed in buying or being given the weapon and the 
training to enable its terrorists to use it. 
  The heat-seeking infra-red Stinger, which is difficult to 
deflect with flares or chaff once it has locked onto a target, 
would transform the military balance in Northern Ireland, 
allowing the Provisionals to shoot down military transport 
helicopters virtually at will. At a stroke this would cripple 
army logistics in the province and force a substantial rethink 
on military strategy. A constant watch for signs that IRA 
members or their representatives are on the hunt for the Stinger 
in the arms bazaars of the Middle East and Asia is being mounted 
by British intelligence, but so far none has been detected. 
However, at least one alert has been issued in the past year in 
Pakistan. 
  An accompanying danger is that Iran may supply Stingers to 
the Provisionals or has already done so. At the end of last 
month, the full extent of Iranian contacts with the IRA was 
disclosed by British intelligence sources after a leak to a 
Greek newspaper, prompting a diplomatic dispute between the two 
countries. The Iranians are known to be among the main 
beneficiaries of Stingers sold by Afghan Mujahidin commanders 
first obtaining them in 1987 when they "confiscated" four 
launchers and 16 missiles from a commander, and are now thought 
to have many more of the weapons. 
  The IRA is not the only danger. The Americans fear Islamic 
radicals may attempt to use the missiles against civilian 
passenger aircraft and the Turks are concerned about Kurdish 
rebels getting them. Other countries known to have Stingers 
include Libya, Iraq, North Korea, and militant Palestinian 
groups. 
  The CIA supplied more than 1,000 Stingers to Afghan rebels 
between June 1986 and April 1988. The weapons, originally worth 
about $30,000 (20,000 pounds) each, had a decisive effect on the 
war and are credited with turning the tide in favour of the 
Mujahidin. Despite careful control over who received them, it 
quickly became apparent that unscrupulous commanders were 
prepared to sell them for more than $100,000 each, making vast 
profits. In 1992, the Bush Administration authorised a $10 
million CIA operation to try to buy the weapons back. A year 
later, with prices rocketing, the budget for the operation was 
increased by a further $50 million. However, Western diplomats 
in Islamabad, the Pakistan capital, believe that although there 
has been some success the programme has probably been 
counterproductive. 
  "I think it has been futile," one source said. "It has made 
the Stinger much more desirable because the Americans are on the 
scene wanting to buy them and this has driven the price up. 
There are plenty of parties willing to outbid the Americans, 
notably the Iranians, the North Koreans and the Iraqis." 
  Inquiries suggest that, of the original estimated 1,000 
intended for Afghanistan, around 300 were used inside the 
country, 200 are now stored in the arsenals of Pakistan, a 
further 200 have already gone missing, and about 300 are still 
in the hands of former Mujahidin commanders. The numbers are 
unverifiable but are regarded as a reasonably accurate guide by 
diplomatic sources. These sources say of the 300 still in 
Afghanistan at the beginning of this year about 100 have 
recently been sold, including around 60 to the Americans who 
have paid between $85,000 and more than $100,000 for each 
launcher. The North Koreans, who closed their embassy in Kabul 
last month, are thought to have bought at least 30, with another 
ten going to the Iranians and two to the Iraqis. The Americans 
are not willing to discuss the programme beyond confirming that 
it is still going on. 
  American sources have been quoted as saying they believe 
many 
of the weapons in Afghanistan have not been maintained properly 
and may now have damaged battery packs, triggering mechanisms or 
circuitry, rendering them useless. While clearly concerned, 
Washington claims that the prize of defeating the Soviet Union 
in Afghanistan and its subsequent consequences easily outweighs 
the residual problem of the Stinger on the black market. 
  This is a view not entirely shared by other Western 
diplomats 
in Islamabad. "You only need one to function to bring down a 
Boeing 747 with 300 people on board and you have a major 
problem," one said.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Challenge to Broadcasting Ban Fails"] </F>
  [Text] A legal challenge to the Government's broadcasting 
ban on Sinn Fein, the political arm of the IRA, has been 
rejected by the European Commission on Human Rights. 
  The Commission has declared inadmissible an application to 
take the British Government to court in Strasbourg charged with 
breaching freedom of expression, which is safeguarded by the 
European Convention on Human Rights. 
  The decision was greeted with dismay by the National Union 
of 
Journalists [NUJ], which has been backing the challenge mounted 
by seven broadcasters and journalists and one member of the 
public. 
  The NUJ said yesterday that it was now considering other 
courses of action "to highlight the effect of the ban on the 
freedom to receive and impart information which is so 
fundamental in a democratic society." 
  The broadcasting ban means that actors have to be used on 
radio and television to give the text of Sinn Fein's speeches. 
  The Commission, which vets all applications to the European 
Court of Human Rights, has followed an earlier decision that the 
broadcasting ban is acceptable in the Irish Republic. 
  But the NUJ has pointed out that the Irish ban was removed 
this January by the Dublin government when it did not renew the 
relevant part of the Broadcasting Act. 
  "It was widely accepted that the crude censorship imposed by 
the ban could no longer be justified," the union said. 
  The NUJ statement went on: "The operation of the ban in the 
United Kingdom, particularly following the visit of Gerry Adams 
to the United States, has highlighted how it is interfering with 
the free movement of information within Europe and the rest of 
the world."

<F P=106> [Paul Brown report: "Plea To Raise Aldermaston Secrecy </F>
Veil"] 
  [Text] The Cold War mentality perpetuated by the Ministry 
of Defence is denying people who live near the Aldermaston 
atomic weapons establishment in Berkshire the right to know what 
dangers they face from its activities, a leading civil rights 
lawyer says in a report to be published today. 
  The report, "Secrecy versus Safety," by Helena Kennedy QC, 
follows an inquiry set up by Reading council in March to give 
local people and organisations a chance to air their concerns. 
  Its main recommendation is that Malcolm Rifkind, the Defence 
Secretary, set up a public inquiry into safety at the base to 
inform people of the risks. 
  Ms Kennedy says the establishment, "like many other British 
government institutions, seems to be suffering from a very 
British disease -- the need to cover even its most mundane 
activities in a cloak of official secrecy. 
  "This is very much a remnant of the Cold War mentality which 
is being perpetuated by the Ministry of Defence. Consequently, 
however much the management genuinely wish to be more open, they 
will run up against superiors who seem to have little concept of 
public feeling in and around Aldermaston. 
  "If any one factor is clear from this inquiry, it is the 
fact 
that the concerns and anxieties will not go away. Furthermore, 
it is difficult to see why they should. People have contracted 
fatal illnesses for which they and their families have received 
no satisfactory response, waterways are threatened with 
pollution and the environment is seen to be constantly at risk. 
  "As most of the witnesses stated there may be nothing to 
fear 
from AWE's activities, but then again there might. Without any 
information the fear, anxieties and rumours will continue and 
expand. There is no greater way to encourage such feelings than 
for a government institution to hide behind the Official Secrets 
Act at every turn and refuse any independent monitoring of its 
activities." 
  Ms Kennedy says local people need to be able to make 
informed 
choices about work, housing and schools. These concerns could 
be satisfied only by a full, independent public inquiry covering 
all aspects of the establishment. 
  The report suggests the inquiry should start before the end 
of 1994. Reading council will today forward the report to Mr 
Rifkind with a request that one be set up. 
  Natalie O'Toole, a spokeswoman for the council, said local 
people had no proper means of communicating with the plant. 
There was a liaison committee on which the council had a 
representative but it had met only twice and the public had no 
access to it. 
  The council is planning to set up a community forum on 
Aldermaston to raise locals' concerns. The council would then 
ask for answers on their behalf at the liaison meetings. 
  Ms O'Toole said: "Getting answers out of Mr Rikind on these 
matters is like chipping away at a block of granite."

<F P=106> [Nick Nuttall report: "Cash Cut Forces Britain To Abandon </F>
Space Project"] 
  [Text] Budget cutbacks have forced Britain to pull out of 
a European venture to develop a 21st-century space plane. The 
country's most celebrated rocket designer is so angry and 
disillusioned that he is poised to take his expertise overseas. 
  Alan Bond, the inventor of the revolutionary air breathing 
engines for Hotol (Horizontal Take Off and Landing), Britain's 
first -- abandoned -- space plane project, has been struggling 
for three years to raise the cash needed to develop a new plane, 
Skylon. He had pinned his hopes on Britain's participation in a 
European programme named FESTIP (Future European Space 
Transportation Investigations Programme). 
  FESTIP is to review the technology for space launchers and, 
in about two years, recommend which should be developed for the 
21st century. 
  Skylon would take off and land on a runway. Its new Sabre 
engines are designed to work in air and space and to cut the 
trip from London to Sydney to an hour. 
  But spending cuts by the Department of Trade and Industry 
have left Britain's dwindling space budget too small to join 
Germany, Holland, Belgium, Italy and Spain in FESTIP, it was 
disclosed yesterday. A spokesman for the British National Space 
Centre in London said the overall budget to the European Space 
Agency [ESA] had been cut from 124 million pounds to 114 million 
pounds. "The space budget is already committed so we would be 
looking at an extra spend which we are not going to get." 
  Germany, which has a space plane design called Sanger, has 
put up 8 million pounds despite budgetary pressures. 
  Mr Bond, whose attempts to develop the engines for British 
Aerospace's [BAe] Hotol space plane were frustrated when the 
Ministry of Defence classified the patents, said yesterday that 
the Government was yet again throwing away a world lead in 
technology. "It is a disaster. Among the whole of Europe we are 
the only country without a space plane programme and we bloody 
well started it all," he said. 
  Private financiers in Britain had told him that without 
government backing they were not prepared to fund the 
development of Skylon. Mr Bond, 49, said he was now planning to 
go overseas with Reaction Engines, the company he founded with 
two former members of the Hotol team. Among those showing 
interest were the Japanese. 
  Mr Bond, whose firm is based at Stanford in the Vale, 
Oxfordshire, said: "We, including British Aerospace, have a 
technological lead, but the head of the British National Space 
Centre and ministers at the Department of Trade and Industry 
simply do not care." 
  He said British Aerospace Space Systems in Stevenage, 
Hertfordshire, which had also hoped to join the ESA programme 
with a revised version of Hotol, had spent millions of pounds of 
its own and taxpayers' money. 
  Paul Down, business development director at BAe, said 
yesterday: "We have gathered a vast amount of expertise working 
with Rolls-Royce and Alan Bond and we have been working with the 
Russians and Deutsche Aerospace.... We will be distressed 
beyond measure if we are not able to play our part." 
  Derek Davis, director general of the British National Space 
Centre, said yesterday: "My heart goes out to Mr Bond...we are 
trying to find ways which would allow these companies to get 
involved." 
  Britain's participation in FESTIP seemed assured last year, 
30 years after it pulled out of the Blue Streak project. 
  Edward Leigh, the former industry minister responsible for 
space, believed Britain could not be left behind. About 3 
million pounds over three years was believed to be enough to 
assure British entry into FESTIP and the involvement of Skylon 
and the revised Hotol.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Richard von Weizsaecker by </F>
unidentified correspondent in Berlin; date not given: "Building 
Bridges Instead of Digging Trenches"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [STERN] The most important 
event of your term of office was Germany's unification. Did not 
something go wrong? 
  [Weizsaecker] I would like to mention two things right at 
the beginning: First, our foreign policy's speedy, responsible, 
and successful seizing of the historic opportunity and, second, 
my conviction that, despite all the difficulties and mistakes 
regarding the need for financial resources and time, we will, in 
the end, successfully solve the great task of unification. 
  At the beginning it looked as if only the Germans in the 
east 
had problems. Now the west, too, is struggling for jobs, just 
to mention the most important example. It was difficult enough 
for the eastern Germans to learn that they had to change their 
way of thinking day by day. Now the western Germans, too, must 
learn something. This brings us closer together. 
  In my view, there was one clear mistake. In winter 1989-90 
there was widespread and profound readiness in the west for 
solidarity and material sacrifice, which was, unfortunately, not 
made use of. Instead, the state financed the enormous transfers 
preferably through gigantic debts. It is very difficult today 
to cope with this. 
  The community spirit of the citizens, which in a democracy 
is 
so vital and does not make itself felt so often, unfortunately 
did not encounter an active political partner. 
  [STERN] Did unification not take place in the style of an 
occupation? 
  [Weizsaecker] Large supermarkets with western goods, banks, 
and political parties, looking for votes.... 
  [STERN] ....marched into the eastern laender. 
  [Weizsaecker] No. Of course, this was not done militarily. 
However, everybody was looking for his own advantage, just as is 
done on the market and among competing parties. There is no 
point in criticizing this. The people in the east want the 
market economy instead of the old, mismanaged state economy. 
However, they do not want to see their entire life, with its 
values and goals, defined overnight by the strength of their 
elbows or by prices. In addition, of course, they wanted 
pluralism in terms of party policy instead of the coercion of a 
single party. And this cannot be had without competition for 
power. However, the struggle should be conducted visibly for a 
better solution of the problems and not just for power for the 
sake of power. One must also mention the unfortunate issue of 
property. The Germans in the east read in our constitution that 
property entails obligations. Many of them, however, think that 
in practice property only entails rights. How can one harmonize 
the two legitimate sides of this matter? 
  [STERN] Today prominent Christian Democratic Union/Christian 
Social Union politicians disparage Bonn's policy of detente in 
the 1970's and 1980's as collaboration with the GDR regime. You 
yourself have always been an advocate of this policy and were 
actively involved in it. 
  [Weizsaecker] I was and still am convinced that two things 
had to be linked: A firm attitude above any doubt by the West, 
on the one hand, and a clear and credible policy of detente on 
the other. If today we are sometimes confronted with the bold 
theory that the policy of detente prevented or at least delayed 
unification because it contributed to consolidating and 
prolonging a long ailing system, this is historical nonsense. 
  [STERN] In 1983 you were the first mayor of West Berlin to 
talk to Erich Honecker. Then in 1987 you received him on an 
official visit in Bonn. Do you regret shaking his hand? 
  [Weizsaecker] No. In particular as mayor of Berlin I, like 
my predecessors, considered it our special task to make the 
division more bearable for the people while it existed. In 
particular here in Berlin, in the divided city, everyone could 
see every day that our political command was to make the inhuman 
wall more permeable and to humanize the cruel border regime. 
Therefore, it was our duty to talk to the people who were in 
power on the other side. I do not regret it at all that I did 
that. 
  [STERN] GDR politicians such as Modrow or Berghofer, who 
helped to ensure that the upheaval happened without bloodshed, 
are politically degraded now. Do you think this is right? 
  [Weizsaecker] Even peaceful revolutions bring about human 
injustice and wrong generalized judgments. In many states of 
the former Soviet sphere of influence we are today cooperating 
with old communists, who essentially contributed to the reforms 
at some time or other for more or less ethical reasons. 
  The course of the upheaval gave us no opportunity to find 
out 
to what extent there were similar serious reform forces in the 
Socialist Unity Party of Germany [SED]. However, I would like 
to recall that some people in the SED who thought in a humanly 
responsible way contributed to the great and difficult task of 
ensuring that the endangered mass demonstrations took a peaceful 
course, for instance those in Leipzig on 9 October 1989. 
[passage omitted] 
  [STERN] Hitler's shadow still hangs over Germany. Your most 
important speech was probably the one on 8 May 1985, the 40th 
anniversary of the end of the war. You were the first president 
to call this date a "day of liberation," saying what many 
Germans think, but at the same time many people blamed you for 
it. Have we really overcome Hitler? 
  [Weizsaecker] Let me first comment on the criticism: Among 
other things, I said that at that time, when the crimes were 
being committed primarily against the Jews, many of us, also in 
my generation, who were young did not open their eyes and ears 
wide enough to get more information about the terrible things 
that were happening. Not just a few people took umbrage at this 
statement of mine. I was told that I had failed to recognize 
the good faith of the overwhelming majority of the German people. 
  [STERN] But the core of your speech was that 8 May was a day 
of liberation. 
  [Weizsaecker] That is what I said and I stick to it firmly. 
In my speech I added clearly -- and I repeat it today -- that, 
naturally, I was fully aware of the fact that for a great number 
of people misery and the loss of their homes came only after 8 
May 1945. However, this terrible suffering must not be blamed 
on 8 May but on what happened beforehand and, in particular, on 
30 January 1933. May 8 was for us all the liberation from the 
unbearable Nazi regime. 
  [STERN] Are you worried about the rising xenophobia and 
neofascism? 
  [Weizsaecker] The great majority of Germans are immune to 
that. However, under no circumstances should we delude 
ourselves with carefree security. Nor should we reassure 
ourselves with the fact that some other countries are struggling 
with even worse phenomena of this kind and that there is hardly 
any nation in the world that is pleased to make room for large 
numbers of foreigners. We have every reason to be particularly 
vigilant. Our difficult past remains a lesson forever. The 
murders of Solingen and Moelln have deeply shocked and shaken 
us. Irresponsible slogans propagated at restaurant tables can 
be a dangerous seed. In addition, too many young people are 
left to their own devices, often without job prospects and 
without orientation. They are easily tempted by political 
rat-catchers and are easily misled to commit acts of violence 
even if there is no visible political program behind such deeds. 
  [STERN] Do you not believe that there is a real, hard 
neo-Nazi core? 
  [Weizsaecker] Yes, there is core, even though it is 
difficult to say how hard it is and what "real" means in this 
connection. Regarding programs, the scene is rather misty. In 
addition, there has been an increase in the number of people who 
write letters in a far more aggressive and brutal tone -- also 
to me -- and give their full name and address. This did not 
happen 10 years ago. 
  Increased vigilance is necessary not only in politics and 
the 
administration but, above all, among the citizens, in the 
communities and towns themselves. And there one must note with 
great satisfaction that there has been a sharp increase in 
positive, democratic activity and vigilance. The many chains of 
light were the most visible sign of that, but they are not by 
far the only good signals. 
  [STERN] Abroad the change in the political climate is, 
however, watched with the greatest suspicion. Do we Germans 
actually have to press to participate in celebrating the 50th 
anniversary of D-Day? 
  [Weizsaecker] I have already said regarding 8 May 1945 that 
such days have a quite different meaning for different people. 
It is good for us to think about what such anniversaries mean 
among ourselves. I still hold this opinion. The profound 
reconciliation with France, Britain, and the United States that 
has taken place over the past decades is not in danger because 
of this. 
  [STERN] Recently there were serious disagreements between 
France and Germany, at the core of the Western alliance. Does 
the new Germany have a solid foreign policy concept? 
  [Weizsaecker] Our situation is characterized by the fact 
that, after Russia, we are the country in Europe that has by far 
the most inhabitants, is located centrally, and is surrounded by 
nine neighbors. In the past we were severely punished for every 
attempt to follow a special national path. Our central 
interest, which is perhaps greater than in most other European 
countries, is that the period of nation states is overcome and 
is replaced by a common European concept. We need and want 
security around us, open borders for trade, and the insight and 
ability to make responsible contributions to the survival of man 
and nature. This is no idealized altruism, these are our 
interests. At peace with our neighbors we were able to complete 
the unification of our state, but all around us we are watched 
with tense attention to see whether we recognize the concerns 
that others had and still have about us with the necessary 
sensitivity and allay them with our behavior. 
  [STERN] Recently one has gained the impression that this 
sensitivity has been lost and that we are suddenly once again 
acting with a diplomacy that runs along the lines of "hello, now 
it is my turn!" 
  [Weizsaecker] Of course, there are better and worse days, 
also regarding the impression that we sometimes give outside 
Germany. All in all, however, there is positive clarity about us 
also among our foreign policy friends, allies, and 
interlocutors. Furthermore, sometimes we are subjected to 
rather contradictory criticism. 
  For instance, every time we make propaganda among our 
partners for strong and clear support of the reform forces and 
countries in the East, these partners have repeatedly told us: 
If you consider this so important, then do it yourself. 
However, as soon as we do do it -- and we have done it to a 
greater extent than other Western countries -- the next 
criticism comes immediately, namely whether we are not going it 
alone again with these support measures and seeking to ensure 
monopoly advantages for ourselves. One must cope with that, and 
we manage to do it. The core of our European policy is and 
remains the close friendly cooperation with France and, step by 
step, also a trilateral cooperation between France, Poland, and 
Germany. 
  [STERN] You are one of the last active politicians of the 
war generation.... 
  [Weizsaecker] ...almost the last. 
  [STERN] Experience cannot be transferred to others. Does 
one have to fear that your generation's immunity to militarism 
and antidemocratic thinking will be lost? 
  [Weizsaecker] Indeed, every generation has its own 
experience. This will determine its attitude along the lines of 
its convictions. However, the Germans' relations with their 
neighbors have changed fundamentally compared with the time of 
my youth -- despite all current concerns and difficulties, they 
have changed in a historically incredible, very impressive sense. 
  The key thing is not when we get a common currency in Europe 
and whether we are already on the path toward a European federal 
state. Rather, the key thing is that the states that make up the 
European Union no longer settle conflicts by force, as in the 
past, but by coming to a common understanding and that the 
democratic nature of this entire European Union has been 
secured. The great historic change compared with the past is the 
fact that we in Germany are able to follow this path together 
with the others. And I see the strength to do that in the young 
Germans.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel intends 
to urge the European Union [EU] to reinclude Croatia into 
economic and financial cooperation. One day after the Geneva 
foreign ministers' conference on a peaceful solution in Bosnia, 
Kinkel said in Bonn on Saturday [14 May] that one should think 
about whether one should grant funds and resume negotiations on 
a cooperation agreement. The parties to the conflict must 
realize that the efforts for peace are worthwhile. Yet, the 
aggressor cannot expect support for the reconstruction of his 
country. 
  Kinkel noted that, despite all criticism of the 
international 
peace efforts to date, one must not overlook that in some 
spheres, the situation has improved in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In 
the past few months, Croatia has made a contribution to a 
peaceful development. By pointing to the talks in Geneva, Kinkel 
said that the sanctions against the Serbs would have to be 
consistently maintained. According to Kinkel, the signal of 
Geneva was: "The Bosnian Serbs and the government in Belgrade 
must realize that they are facing a joint position of the 
countries that participate in the conference, countries they 
will need politically, and, later, also for economic 
reconstruction." 
  Kinkel stated that one must not harbor any illusions 
regarding the difficulties of the future course of the 
negotiations. Too many promises and agreements have been broken 
to date, particularly from the Serbian side. "Hence, there is 
no reason to be euphoric," Kinkel concluded.

  [Text] Bonn -- Interior Minister Manfred Kanther 
(Christian Democratic Union) is concerned about the "alarming" 
increase in criminal offenses in Germany. During a meeting at 
the Konrad Adenauer Foundation in St. Augustin near Bonn, 
Kanther stressed today that the overall number of registered 
criminal offenses rose to 6.7 million last year. In 1992, the 
number was approximately 6.3 million. The citizens "feel very 
insecure and are very worried." The citizens' feeling of 
security is greatly impaired. 
  Kanther mentioned particularly street crime, burglaries, and 
offenses involving cars. In addition, "thefts are rising fast 
and organized crime is spreading in a disquieting manner." 
Criminal organizations with rigid and hierarchical structures 
that are based on the division of labor increasingly infiltrate 
Germany's economic and social system. Because of the enormous 
profits, this development takes place at an "alarming speed," 
the minister pointed out. 
  Cross-border crime also plays an increasingly dangerous 
role. 
As a result of the collapse of communism in East Europe, the 
international embezzlement of motor vehicles has risen 
considerably. According to the findings of the investigating 
authorities, around 40 percent of the cars registered as stolen 
are never found. Cooperation with the police in the East 
European states must be intensified. The protection of the 
external borders and the fight against smuggling refugees is 
assuming increasing significance, Kanther stressed. Last year, 
over 54,000 foreigners were caught crossing the border illegally. 
  Europe's desired integration must not have the effect that 
borders fall for the criminals but continue to exist for the 
investigating authorities, the minister emphasized. Europe 
needs a common asylum policy. By shifting personnel within the 
Federal Border Police (BGS) and through flexible deployment 
concepts, the BGS units should be used for the protection of the 
borders to a greater extent than in the past, Kanther announced. 
The 1994 law on the fight against crime will probably be 
adopted by the Bundestag before the end of this week. The law 
on the BGS and the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation are 
also designed to enhance internal security.

  [Excerpt] Gelsenkirchen (DPA) -- Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel has asked the German people to "bluntly renounce" those 
who are intellectually paving the way for xenophobic acts of 
violence in Germany. "Regardless of where it comes from, 
violence cannot and must not have any place in our country," the 
minister told 2,500 people at a German-foreign friendship 
festival in Gelsenkirchen. 
  "We again have reason to be ashamed of ourselves," Kinkel 
said, and also expressed his deepest sorrow on behalf of the 
Federal Government for Thursday's [12 May] riots in Magdeburg. 
It is a task for all of society to show solidarity and to say: 
This country is friendly toward foreigners. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Halle -- The leadership of the Bundestag group of 
the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] has sharply 
criticized the behavior of the police and judicial organs in 
connection with the bloody riots in Magdeburg last Thursday [12 
May]. SPD Deputy Chairman Wolfgang Thierse stated today at the 
end of a two-day visit to Saxony-Anhalt that it is unacceptable 
that the impression is being created that the perpetrators have 
been released again. This is an invitation for more acts of 
violence. The Magdeburg policy apparently did react resolutely 
enough. It is the state's duty to react to violence with all 
instruments that are available.

  [Text] Magdeburg (DPA) -- So far, five arrest warrants 
have been issued in connection with the Magdeburg riots on 
Ascension Day [12 May]. Three rioters, for whom an arrest 
warrant has been issues, are still at large, Magdeburg Senior 
Public Prosecutor Rudolf Jaspers told DPA on Wednesday [18 May]. 
  According to Jaspers, one arrest warrant was refused. The 
Magdeburg Regional Court did not consider the evidence 
sufficient to take the Magdeburg citizen, who was sentenced to a 
two-year suspended sentence in the Elbterrase trial in Magdeburg 
in 1992, into preventive custody. Instead, the conditions for 
his suspended sentence were tightened. 
  The first arrest warrant was issued on Monday against a 
suspected leader of the bloody riots. On Tuesday, detention 
pending trial was ordered for another four right-wingers. One 
of the persons in detention pending trial had been sentenced to 
a suspended sentence of one year and six months for an attack in 
the Magdeburg city center. 
  According to Jaspers, another two arrest warrants are to be 
decided on Wednesday. One of the two rioters in question is at 
large. The other was temporarily arrested on Tuesday.

  [Text] Magdeburg (DPA) -- In the course of the 
investigation against suspected participants in the xenophobic 
riots in Magdeburg on Ascension Day [12 May] a sixth arrest 
warrant has been issued. It applies to an adult hooligan, who is 
suspected of having violated the laws relating to civil disorder 
and rioting in a particularly serious case, Senor Public 
Prosecutor Rudolf Jaspers told DPA on Wednesday [18 May]. He 
probably participated in the hunt for foreigners and the 
storming of the Marietta Bar, into which the attacked persons 
had fled.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- In a question-and answer session on 
Wednesday [18 May] called for by Alliance 90/Greens, the parties 
represented in the Bundestag condemned the xenophobic riots in 
Magdeburg on Ascension Day [12 May]. Deputy Konrad Weiss 
(Alliance 90/Greens) harshly criticized the "hesitating work" of 
the police as well as statements and actions by Magdeburg Police 
President Antonius Stockmann. The police not only did not 
protect the attacked foreigners but even harassed them, he 
pointed out. 
  Statements by Roman Herzog, the Christian Democratic Union 
[CDU]/Christian Social Union candidate for president, concerning 
the naturalization of foreigners are practically calling for a 
manhunt, Weiss said. Social Democratic Party of Germany Deputy 
Juergen Schmude stated that Germany is beginning to change and 
we are doing nothing to stop this development. If we are not 
able to nip such developments in the bud, "we will not recognize 
our country again," Schmude said. Rolf Olderog (CDU) warned 
against condemning the police. Media reports about the riots in 
Magdeburg were often incorrect and exaggerated. Free Democratic 
Party of Germany Deputy Burgkhard Hirsch said in the debate that 
statements by Police President Antonius Stockmann, which played 
things down after the events, were worthy of a cabaret.

  [Text] Munich (DPA) -- The Republikaner are for the first 
time cited in the constitutional protection report on political 
extremism in Bavaria. However, Franz Schoenhuber's party is 
just mentioned as an "object for observation." At the 
presentation of the report for 1993 in Munich on Monday [16 May] 
Interior Minister Guenter Beckstein (Christian Social Union) 
said that so far the investigations as to whether the party is 
to be classified as right- wing extremist in Bavaria have not 
yet been concluded. 
  In Bavaria -- as in seven other laender -- the Republikaner 
have been watched with intelligence service means since the end 
of 1992. So far, the party has been classified as right-wing 
radical and not as right-wing extremist in Bavaria. Therefore, 
the party was not mentioned in the constitutional protection 
reports. Baden-Wuerttemberg has already classified 
Schoenhuber's party as "right-wing extremist." At its latest 
meeting at the beginning of May, the interior ministers' 
conference also spoke of "right-wing extremist intentions." 
  According to Beckstein, Bavaria's internal security is still 
"massively" threatened by politically motivated violence. 
Right-wing extremism is in the foreground in this connection. 
Thus, xenophobic crimes such as graffiti, threats, and coercion 
rose from 390 to about 460 cases last year (plus 18 percent). 
Antisemitic and racist incidents even increased by 44 percent 
to almost 700. The number of acts of violence -- such as massive 
physical attacks -- remained constant at 110. 
  With a view to the highway blockade by Kurds near Augsburg 
in 
mid-March, Beckstein announced a Bavarian initiative in the 
Bundesrat. According to this initiative, offenses against the 
laws relating to civil disorders and rioting are to become a 
"compulsory reason for expulsion." So far, the regulation in 
the law was optional. It remains an "ambitious goal" to deport 
foreign violent criminals after examining each individual case. 
Politically motivated violence by foreigners has reached an 
"unbearable degree." All over the FRG 195 such deeds were 
registered last year; in 1992 there were only 141. 
  Concerning the classification of the Republikaner, Beckstein 
demanded a nationwide coordinated action by the conference of 
the interior ministers of the laender. Bavaria has included the 
party in the constitutional protection report for the first 
time, because there are "considerable clues" pointing to goals 
that are hostile to the constitution. Beckstein rejected an 
action alliance against the Republikaner, which the Social 
Democratic Party of Germany has demanded. Real democrats cannot 
be onesidedly "antifascist," but must defend themselves against 
extremism from both the right and the left. In total, 
right-wing extremism in Bavaria has almost 5,000 followers, thus 
being considerably stronger than left-wing extremism with about 
3,500 followers, the Christian Social Union politician said. 
  For the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS] Beckstein 
demanded observation with intelligence service means. He will 
continue to urge a nationwide classification of the PDS as a 
party hostile to the constitution, the minister said. In the 
160-page Bavarian report the PDS is again classified as 
left-wing extremist. According to the interior minister, it is 
watched with intelligence service means.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Defense Minister Volker Ruehe 
(Christian Democratic Union) plans to save billions of German 
marks in the armed forces in the future by tightening and 
rationalizing the operation of the Bundeswehr. In the Bundestag 
Defense Committee, the minister announced in Bonn on Wednesday 
[18 May] that in the Bundeswehr, too, work is going to be done 
as much as possible along the line of business management. The 
goal is to "rationalize and, wherever useful, privatize" the 
entire operations through "internal optimization." By the end 
of the 1990's, the Defense Ministry is to be restructured and 
the staff is to be reduced by 38 percent, from 5,200 to 3,300 
employees. Ruehe told DPA that he expects a "broad consensus" 
among the parties for his concept. 
  Ruehe bases his plans on the investigations of the "Work 
Group for Limiting Expenditure in Operations" (AGAB), which was 
established in March 1993 and headed by General Lorenz Huber. 
In cooperation with civilian consulting companies, Huber showed 
possibilities to save up to 35 percent of personnel and 25 
percent of costs. By optimizing operations over the next years, 
up to 2 billion German marks [DM] per year could be saved just 
in equipment maintenance and administration. Ruehe explained to 
the deputies that the storage of material and stock management 
must be made considerably more economical. 
  According to Ruehe, depot organization must be centralized 
far more. The repair facilities of the Army, Air Force, and 
Navy will be newly organized. Considerable numbers of personnel 
are to be reduced. The transportation sector and the 
telecommunications system of the armed forces will be 
rationalized and modernized. The restructuring of logistics 
requires "a keener awareness for using the scarce resources 
efficiently" at all leadership echelons of the Bundeswehr," 
Ruehe stressed. Motivating the employees for the set targets is 
one of the keys to success. The military commanders must see 
"that saving in their sphere of responsibility pays off." 
  The Defense Ministry is to "be brought back to its basic 
tasks." Its organization structure will be tightened to 
facilitate speedy processes of command and decisionmaking. The 
military command staffs, the civilian departments, and the 
Armament Main Department will be maintained "in a balanced 
degree." The assignment and responsibility of the inspector 
general and the inspectors of the units will not change. 
  In the Command Staff of the armed forces, however, "the 
ministerial tasks of the military sector will be concentrated." 
The civilian part of the ministry will get a "largely new 
structure, which will be more functional." There will be a new 
Department for Personnel, Social, and Central Matters (PSZ). 
The Legal Department will also be reorganized. The Armament 
Main Department will be reduced to the ministry's basic tasks. 
  According to Manfred Opel, defense expert of the Social 
Democratic Party of Germany [SDP], a "rationalization potential 
is lying fallow" in the Bundeswehr, "which adds up to about DM4 
billion." If, for instance, the "scrap" of the former National 
People's Army (NVA) of the GDR [German Democratic Republic] in 
84 storage facilities, on which a lot of money is spent for 
guarding it, were to be immediately disposed of privately, at 
least DM300 million could be saved.

  [Text] Bonn -- In spite of the tight budget situation, 
Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt (Free Democratic Party of 
Germany) wants to reduce further the rates of the income and 
corporate tax. However, before that, the 7.5-percent solidarity 
surcharge that is to be reintroduced in 1995 "must be abolished 
at the earliest possible date," Rexrodt announced at the meeting 
of medium-seized enterprises in Bonn today. In fact, the 
location safeguarding law has reduced the tax rates to the 
lowest point since the war, "but we must proceed on this path 
because the taxation of our enterprises is still unfavorable." 
  In front of representatives of 22 associations of 
medium-sized enterprises, the economics minister confirmed his 
intention to abolish the property tax on enterprises and the 
trade capital tax by 1 Janaury 1966. Rexrodt stressed: 
"Lowering the corporate tax is the best program for the 
medium-sized enterprises." Tax privileges for risk capital for 
innovative small and medium-sized enterprises in the new laender 
might also be useful. 
  As far as the implementation of the 1-billion-mark scheme, 
promised by the banks for the eastern German economy, is 
concerned, the majority of the sum should be granted to 
medium-sized industrial enterprises. Rexrodt stressed: 
"However, we should jointly think about how more private 
foreign equity capital can generally be attracted -- preferably 
in the form of active shares to combine the transfer of capital 
and know-how." To improve vocational training, he wants to 
"ensure that the promotion of trade will be maintained at the 
current level, and that sufficient apprenticeships are available 
in the new laender." 
  Referring to a reduction of the corporate tax, the minister 
pointed out that the tax quota in Germany is among the highest 
in industrialized nations, Rexrodt emphasized. Particularly the 
taxes that do not depend on the profit represent a clear 
disadvantage in international competition. Moreover, the trade 
income tax should be reduced. In return, the communes should 
participate in the turnover tax. As a result of the reduction 
of the trade income tax, "the cause for the split top rate of 
the income tax would also disappear," Rexrodt explained. Since 
the beginning of the year, it has been 53 percent for private 
income and 47 percent for business income. The corporate tax is 
currently 45 percent. According to Rexrodt, this split should 
temporarily compensate for the special burden on the trade tax 
until its reform.

  [Text] Frankfurt/Main (DPA) -- Germany's citizens are 
obviously no longer willing to continue to incur debts for 
consumption to the current extent. As the German Bundesbank 
writes in its latest monthly report, the decline of the savings 
quota went hand in hand with a decline in the readiness to incur 
debts for consumption purposes. With 15 billion German marks 
[DM] the additional loans taken out in 1993 were one-third less 
than the previous year. The Bundesbank attributes this to the 
decline in income and the "more somber economic prospects in 
western Germany." 
  Concerning the short-term overdraft of current accounts, it 
noticed that new debts "were only one-quarter of the sums of the 
previous year." At the end of 1993 private debts for 
consumption amounted to DM354 billion, which was about 17 
percent of the available budget income. Given savings of DM222 
billion, the savings quota, which is the share of savings in 
available income, went down by about one percentage point to 
approximately 13 percent. 
  As the Bundesbank continues, net capital expenditures in 
fixed assets as well as the savings of the overall economy went 
down considerably in 1993 due to the economic crisis. After the 
deduction of write-offs, capital expenditures in fixed assets 
amounted to DM255 billion and thus were "almost one-fifth lower 
than the previous year," the Bundesbank writes. 
  The financing gap in the economy was again closed by foreign 
investors. "The fact that this was possible despite generally 
declining interest rates is to be seen as an expression of trust 
of foreign creditors in the stability of the German mark," it is 
said. 
  The main reason for the gap between supply and demand on the 
financial markets was "the borrowing of public budgets, which 
was high before and continued to increase in 1993." With DM155 
billion it exceeded -- due to unification -- the sum of 1992 by 
almost half and thus amounted to about two-thirds of the overall 
private formation of monetary capital in Germany. 
  While capital expenditures in fixed assets in western 
Germany 
declined by 30 percent to DM161 billion as a result of the 
recession, the development was reversed in the new laender: The 
formation of fixed assets rose to an almost equal extent to DM94 
billion. Thus, the east German economy "made good progress in 
all fields" in reconstruction and restructuring, in the view of 
the Bundesbank. 
  The profit situation of west German companies continued to 
deteriorate; in eastern Germany manufacturing companies were 
generally not able to return to profitability in 1993, the 
Bundesbank continues.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Clinton Sends Berlusconi Best </F>
Wishes"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 13 -- United States President Bill 
Clinton has sent a letter of congratulations and best wishes to 
Italy's new Premier Silvio Berlusconi on the formation of the 
new government. The letter was delivered to Berlusconi Friday 
evening [13 May] by the American ambassador to Rome, Reginald 
Bartholomew, and in it Clinton wished Italy every success in the 
renewal process underway in the country. 
  The U.S. President said he was looking forward to working in 
close contact with the Italian head of government to further 
strengthen the strong bilateral partnership that exists between 
the two countries. 
  Clinton recalled that he would be meeting with Berlusconi in 
Rome next month and again in Naples in July during the Group of 
Seven summit there. These encounters will offer excellent 
opportunities to develop that cooperation aimed at enlarging the 
democratic community, at spurring world economic growth and at 
promoting collective security, the message added. 
  During his meeting with Bartholomew, Berlusconi confirmed 
the 
intention of his government to work to strengthen civic society 
and political democracy in Italy. He urged that his government 
be judged on its actions and concrete results. 
  The premier also noted that the important international 
appointments in the offing will afford an opportunity for him 
and Clinton to take a deeper look at the many topics of mutual 
interest to them, also with a view to strengthening the firm 
partnership that already exists between Italy and the United 
States. 
  Foreign Minister Antonio Martino, who was present at the 
Bartholomew-Berlusconi encounter, will be going to Washington 
the last week in May to prepare for Clinton's Rome visit.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Bosnia: Previti, Martino, on </F>
Italian Peacekeepers"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 16 -- There was a chance that 
Italian peacekeeping forces might one day take part in peace 
operations in Bosnia but only if there were a unanimous request 
to this effect from the United Nations, and always within the 
framework of NATO, and in the presence of a bona fide peace plan 
to be safeguarded and brought to a successful conclusion, 
Italian Defense Minister Cesare Previti told journalists today 
coming out of a meeting with Reginald Bartholomew, the United 
States ambassador to Rome. 
  In response to a question, Previti said that in his talk 
with 
the American ambassador, Bosnia had come up only marginally and 
was barely touched upon. The U.S. ambassador, however, took the 
occasion to voice appreciation for Italy's "essential 
cooperation" in NATO's initiatives in and for the former 
Yugoslavia. 
  Turning to Italo-American ties, Previti stressed that the 
long-time alliance between the two countries would continue 
unfailingly in the future. 
  Meanwhile, out of Brussels, where the new Italian foreign 
minister Antonio Martino was attending an EU [European Union] 
ministerial meeting, the first signals were given that the 
Berlusconi government would like to play a more active role in 
the Balkan crisis. 
  Stressing that "the problem is very close to our interests", 
Martino announced to his European colleagues that an Italian 
diplomatic representation was imminently about to open in 
Sarajevo and would be placed in the hands of ambassador Vittorio 
Pennarola. 
  The minister did not rule out the sending in of Italian 
peacekeepers "under certain conditions" to oversee, within a 
NATO context, the implementation of an overall peace plan agreed 
to by all sides. However, Italy's controversial recent 
experience in Somalia led the government to want to be certain 
that it had a say in all the relevant decisions before 
committing peacekeeping troops to Bosnia, Martino said.

  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 13 -- Italy's new defense minister, 
Cesare Previti, the day after the government was sworn in, sent 
messages containing assurances to the secretaries of NATO and 
the WEU [Western European Union], as well as to the U.S. 
secretary of defense, to the effect that Italian policies of 
defense and security would keep to the firm traditional 
guidelines followed by previous Rome governments, the ministry 
information office reported this evening. 
  In his message, Previti said that Italy was firmly anchored 
to the Atlantic Alliance and deeply committed both to close 
relations with the United States and to the building of a 
credible European security identity. 
  The defense minister also emphasized the serious tensions 
that exist within an international framework and to which Italy, 
because of its geographical position, is particularly exposed.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Government Programme; Reactions, </F>
Italian People's Party"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 16 -- Senators from the Italian 
People's Party [PPI] (the former Christian Democrats) backed the 
document approved by the party leadership this evening which 
turned thumbs down on the speech Premier Silvio Berlusconi 
delivered to the Senate today prior to a confidence vote. 
  As a result, the PPI senators are expected to vote against 
the government which they accuse of showing no opening 
whatsoever to the opposition forces in parliament. 
  It was also learned that life senator Giulio Andreotti, a 
veteran Christian Democrat, discussed various scenarios with the 
PPI senators in the event the government does not win the 
confidence vote in the Senate. 
  In the document released by the party leadership this 
evening, the People's Party decried the government program put 
forth by Berlusconi as a mere list of promises with no 
indication as to how these generalized goals are to be achieved. 
  The PPI was especially sharp about the fact that Berlusconi 
in no way settled the problem of the conflict between his role 
as premier and his ownership of a large part of the means of 
communication in this country.

<F P=106> [Interview with Nicola Mancino, Italian Popular Party Senate </F>
caucus leader, by Gianfranco Ballardin in Rome; date not given: 
"Mancino: Not Now -- We Are Thinking in Terms of the Future..."] 
  [Text] Rome -- [Ballardin] Senator Mancino, have you in the 
PPI [Italian Popular Party] already decided whether next 
Wednesday [18 May], when the vote of confidence is taken, you 
will vote against the Knight [Prime Minister Berlusconi 
nickname]? 
  [Mancino] No, not yet. The party's leadership and the Senate 
caucus will both be meeting today. After listening to its 
policy statement, we will publish our overall assessment of the 
government, both as regards its makeup (which is rather poor, 
frankly speaking) and its platform's contents. 
  [Ballardin] Seven or eight PPI senators (among whom Grillo, 
Delfino, Costa, and De Gaudenz) have already made it known that 
they intend to be absent, when the vote of confidence is taken, 
in order to ensure the government's viability. 
  [Mancino] I hope our 27 senators, as well as our 33 
deputies, 
will all vote the same way. How? We must decide this together 
by Wednesday. But we must be an opposition party both in the 
Chamber of Deputies and in the Senate. 
  [Ballardin] Are you prepared, however, to assume 
responsibility for the government being defeated, which may 
result in new general elections being called early? 
  [Mancino] I am aware that voters have pronounced themselves 
in favor of a coalition which has a reasonable majority in the 
Chamber of Deputies, but not in the Senate, where it must build 
such a majority each time as need arises. So far, in the 
Senate, the government coalition had luck on its side, both on 
the occasion of the appointment of the Senate speaker, and when 
it came to appointing the chairperson of Immunity Committee. 
However, we do not have the duty to ensure governability. This 
task falls to Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. 
  [Ballardin] In an interview with LA STAMPA, [former 
Christian 
Democratic Party, DC, Secretary] De Mita suggested the 
following: We refuse our vote of confidence to the Knight, the 
government is defeated, Berlusconi resigns, and he is replaced 
by Berlusconi Two, who will negotiate with us before addressing 
parliament. Have we correctly interpreted the meaning of the 
former DC secretary's words? 
  [Mancino] No, he did not say "negotiate with us." He only 
said that, at a later stage, the absence of a majority in the 
Senate would become even more noticeable. 
  [Ballardin] Hence the PPI's decisive role. 
  [Mancino] A power over life and death. 
  [Ballardin] According to some, the Berlusconi Two option 
suggested by De Mita looks like a mirage in the Sahara desert. 
In your capacity as Senate floor leader, are you prepared to 
instruct your fellow senators to vote against, at the risk of 
having to go back to the polls? 
  [Mancino] Once upon a time nobody even dreamt of asking an 
opposition party this kind of question. In any case, we cannot 
be a mere appendage of the majority, and therefore we confirm 
our role in opposition. As a matter of fact, we are currently 
considering the best way of stating our position in the house. 
  [Ballardin] If I may ask, out of curiosity: Whom do you 
prefer: Berlusconi, [National Alliance leader] Fini, or [League 
Secretary] Bossi? 
  [Mancino] One of them, namely Bossi, is a territorialist, 
and 
therefore he favors the country's political fragmentation. 
Next, Fini, in relation to us, the PPI, is poles apart. As 
regards Berlusconi, he was chosen as the winning coalition's 
leader not by us, but by the voters. Why should we question the 
voters' decision? 
  [Ballardin] Some PPI members are saying: If Berlusconi 
jettisons the fascists, it may be possible to reach an agreement 
with him. 
  [Mancino] Undoubtedly, there is an alternative solution in 
parliament. In fact, we might envisage a dialogue between AD 
[Democratic Alliance], any willing Socialists, and the PPI. 
Added to the League and Forza Italia, they could form a 
majority, both in the Chamber of Deputies and in the Senate. 
This, however, is not an immediate prospect, because Silvio 
Berlusconi, having won the elections with a specific coalition, 
is not in the position to make such a move, which, however, 
could be considered by the parliamentary groups, acting 
autonomously. 
  [Ballardin] Such a move, then, might become a real 
possibility in the future. 
  [Mancino] Yes, we might work in that direction.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Confidence Debate Under Way"] </F>
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 17 -- Sixty-one senators have put 
their names down to speak in the confidence debate which resumed 
in the Senate on Tuesday morning [17 May], official sources said. 
  Kicking off the debate today was Gianfranco Miglio, speaking 
from the mixed group benches in his first address since breaking 
away from the Northern League recently. Miglio said he would be 
voting in favour of the new government, but went on to criticise 
the government programme presented yesterday by Premier Silvio 
Berlusconi, and the stance of the Northern League. 
  Describing himself as "disappointed and amazed" by that part 
of the programme statement dealing with local autonomy, Miglio 
said that the government was aiming not at "federalism which 
guarantees liberty", but at "autonomy which covers centralism". 
  Miglio, until yesterday the Northern League's ideologue, is 
in favour of dividing Italy up into three macro-regions in a 
federative state. 
  The former Leaguer's defection from the governing Freedom 
Front alliance enhanced fears of a confidence debate defeat in 
an upper house where the ruling coalition controls only 155 
votes, against the 164 needed. A no-confidence vote by Miglio 
would have brought this down still further, to 154.

Confidence Voted, Poll Says"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 16 -- Two-thirds of the Italian 
people want parliament to vote confidence in the Berlusconi 
government, a CIRM [Italian Center for Market Research] poll 
indicated. 
  66.4 percent of 911 persons polled in 180 towns around Italy 
replied Yes to the question "Would you vote confidence in the 
Berlusconi government if you were a member of the Lower House?" 
24.4 percent replied No and 9.2 percent expressed no view. 
  CIRM highlighted that one-third of Communist Refoundation 
voters and 0.4 percent of other Progressive voters would give 
the government their confidence, alongside a majority of Greens, 
the ex-Christian Democrats of the People's Party and the Pact 
for Italy, and the ex-radicals of the Pannella List.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "New `Liberal-Socialist' Movement </F>
Unveiled Sunday"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 14 -- A new party calling itself a 
Liberal-Socialist "Movement" and claiming to group the remnants 
of four coalition parties that almost disappeared after 
elections in the wake of corruption scandals will be founded 
officially Sunday [15 May] in Rome. 
  Margherita Boniver of the Socialist Party, who is among the 
founders of the new body, on Saturday claimed the 
Liberal-Socialist "thing" will be a "political subject...not a 
party but a cultural political movement" which will include 
members of the Liberal, Republican and Social Democratic parties. 
  "Many parties, like the Socialist Party, have disappeared, 
but that does not mean their heritage of ideas must also be 
lost," she said, adding that the movement will place itself 
"left of center" and will adopt as its slogan and official 
magazine the phrase, "don't give up." The magazine (NON 
MOLLARE) already exists and was founded in 1925.

<F P=106> [Report signed "R.R.": "Former Pact Members, Now the </F>
`Liberal Democratic Foundation'"] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- "The Segni Pact was finished just after 
the elections, because it lacked a popular consensus and because 
the nondenominationalist members moved away from it. Now that 
La Malfa and Amato left, the Segni Pact will remain Segni and 
that is enough. More than a political movement, it is an 
abstraction given form by a name and aimed at a new Italian 
political absurdity: opposition from the Center! Hence, Giulio 
Tremonti, Berlusconi's finance minister, lent official status to 
the final farewell to the referendum leader by announcing the 
birth of the "Liberal Democratic Foundation," which has paid a 
lot of attention to Berlusconi and which held its first, crowded 
meeting yesterday at the Antonianum. 
  Segni's reply was extremely tough: "Now that Tremonti has 
become a minister, it is obvious because he embraced Berlusconi. 
It is displeasing to see deputies who, after 20 days, back away 
from the programs for which they were elected and betray the 
electorate." Joining Tremonti (absent due to one of his 
ministerial duties) are Alberto Michelini and two other former 
Pact deputies, Ernesto Stajano and Pietro Siciliani. They want 
to become an important point of reference for the liberal world 
within the Center-Right coalition, yet want to remain distinct 
from Forza Italia. Referring to Segni, Michelini condemned "the 
lack of clarity" and felt that now it is "more than likely" that 
there will be a fresh division in the PPI [Italian Popular 
Party]. "I am convinced that at the time of the confidence 
vote, six or seven PPI senators will not be present. No matter 
what Ciriaco De Mita says about it, not everyone wants the 
government to fall." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Achille Occhetto, secretary general of the </F>
Italian Democratic Party of the Left, by Paolo Franchi; place 
and date not given: "This Government Humiliates Italy" -- first 
paragraph is CORRIERE DELLA SERA introduction] 
  [Text] Rome -- "The country's democratic life has reached 
danger level." This was Achille Occhetto's immediate comment 
Tuesday [10 May] on the birth of the new government. And in 
today's L'UNITA he went even further: [President] Oscar Luigi 
Scalfaro's letter to [Prime Minister] Silvio Berlusconi is "a 
shocking, extraordinary, and disturbing development." Does that 
mean that you deny that this government has the democratic 
legitimacy necessary to govern? "No, we said immediately after 
the elections that the victorious Right has the entitlement and 
the duty to govern. But this is a different matter. This 
government humiliates Italy because of the quality of its 
ministers; because of the lies and intrigues that dominated the 
period of its formation, just as in the darkest days of the 
First Republic; and because at the very moment of its birth it 
is already violating all the promises that it made to the 
Italian people." 
  [Franchi] But the Right has won. We might feel prompted to 
say: Here is the New that you appealed for... 
  [Occhetto] The New? Let us be serious. There have been 
times when the Right was the New: Fascism was the New with 
respect to liberal Italy. So the term "new" is a subject of 
debate. Be that as it may, this is a government of recycled 
persons. There is even something derisive in what has happened: 
Riding on the tide of self-righteousness and revanchism, in an 
atmosphere like that of the Circus Maximus, the Bossis and the 
Finis have brought to power the rearguard of the forces that 
held sway during the first phase of the republic. It is a base 
example of the mere appearance of change. 
  [Franchi] What do you mean? That the people have been 
victims of an optical illusion, a great deception? 
  [Occhetto] A deception, a deception. After a great campaign 
against the parties, we find ourselves again with Big Brother 
looking out at us from every wall. I say this quite frankly: 
We cannot compete with this huge financial and business power, 
with a mega-party-cum-firm which wants to render the parties 
ineffective. 
  [Franchi] Do you not think that you are exaggerating? If I 
am not mistaken, you were in the forefront of the challenge to 
the Old Regime. And the election result and the consequent 
government are the outcome of a new electoral system that was 
supposed to open the way to alternation... 
  [Occhetto] But this is not the democracy of alternation that 
we wanted when we promoted the referendums. We are in a 
republic led by a family business. As an Italian, I feel 
ashamed of this. Especially when I think about the European 
Parliament where we poor post-Communists -- universally 
acknowledged as cultured, intelligent, and civilized -- will 
appear with this mass of ignoramuses behind us... Some Liberals 
in the twenties actually liked the Fascist action squads, at 
least from an aesthetic viewpoint. This time, with people of 
this sort, there is no danger of committing the same mistake. 
What democracy of alternation? Here we have a prime minister 
who in the European elections is standing as a candidate at the 
top of his lists in five constituencies, knowing that he will 
have to resign immediately. This is a deception against the 
voters, an attempt to introduce a system of election by 
acclaim... 
  [Franchi] I take note of your opinion. I would like to ask: 
What does an opposition do when it is convinced that the winners 
pose a threat to democracy? 
  [Occhetto] We will conduct a democratic and constitutional 
opposition. But we cannot ignore the sinister sickness revealed 
by the exchange of letters between Scalfaro and Berlusconi: It 
is precisely the existence of this sinister sickness that 
demands that we be not only the vanguard of a combative 
opposition but also the champions of a democracy that has 
reached danger level. 
  [Franchi] I assume you realize the serious implications of 
what you are saying. 
  [Occhetto] Of course. And I would never have said it unless 
Scalfaro had taken the serious action that he did. Let us be 
frank. Either Scalfaro was not in earnest, which I exclude, or 
his words are set in stone. And these stones must be removed. 
  [Franchi] Pardon me, but I still find it difficult to 
reconcile two such different approaches to opposition. It is 
one matter to plan revenge in the next elections, which is what 
happens in all the Western countries. But it is an entirely 
different matter to combat the threat of reaction... 
  [Occhetto] I will try to make this clear by means of an 
example. In Britain the Laborites combat the Conservative 
governments' economic and social policies by monitoring them and 
putting forward alternative proposals. And we will do this. 
But there is a serious additional problem. This government has 
been born amid the suspicion that it wants to deviate from 
observance of the fundamental principles of the Constitution. 
And we intend to act as guardians of these principles. I would 
like to add that it is not we alone who will be establishing 
which aspect of our opposition will prevail. A great deal will 
obviously depend on what the government does. 
  [Franchi] Do you not think that a Left that adopts such a 
stance will, rightly or wrongly, be accused of being progressive 
by name but conservative in deed? 
  [Occhetto] Why? I say, on the contrary: Left, wake up; do 
not close yourself up in your own narrow domain; learn to talk 
to the 60 percent of Italians who did not vote for the Right and 
who, let us never forget, constitute the virtual majority, 
  [Franchi] Yes, but the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] 
and 
its progressive allies obtained one-third of the votes. And 
very few people actually believe in the possibility of their 
increasing to the extent of becoming a majority. 
  [Occhetto] I do not believe it either. We have crossed our 
Red Sea. We are still standing. Indeed, we have gained some 
votes. But we certainly must not imagine that the PDS and the 
Left can achieve a majority on their own. Not even by taking 
nonexistent shortcuts... 
  [Franchi] Shortcuts? 
  [Occhetto] Yes, the idea of dissolving, of turning ourselves 
-- us and the forces close to us -- into a democratic party, 
that is, of eliminating the "S," the Left, from our name, as 
though the problem facing the Left were how to constantly escape 
from itself... Nonsense. Just as it is nonsense to account for 
everything in terms of a sociology of leadership, though sooner 
or later the issue will arise of a PDS secretary that does not 
have behind him the experience of the PCI [Italian Communist 
Party], if for no other reason than that generations come and 
go. Just as it is superficial, if not indeed stupid, to believe 
that the basic issue is one of appeal to the moderates... 
  [Franchi] Do you mean that this issue does not exist? 
  [Occhetto] I accept no criticisms in this regard, even 
implicit ones. I went to NATO. I went to talk to bankers in 
the City. The enlightened bourgeoisie voted for us en masse. 
If I had been told that only a few years ago, I would not have 
believed it. What I mean is that there certainly is a problem 
regarding the Left, but that above all there is the problem of 
the center. 
  [Franchi] And what is that? 
  [Occhetto] It is that there is not a center capable of 
looking toward the Left with the same vigor and pragmatism with 
which Berlusconi, also from the center, looked toward the 
right-wing forces, causing them to communicate with each other. 
And leading them to victory, thanks to the first-past-the-post 
system. This, despite the fact that the progressive forces, the 
Popular Party, and the Pact gained more votes. 
  [Franchi] What do you have in mind to ensure that this 
dynamic center takes shape? 
  [Occhetto] You are asking too much of me. I already have my 
problems with the Left. We can, and will, conduct an opposition 
that is non-demagogic, non-extremist. And we can confederate 
our forces. Of course, I will not ask the Popular Party to join 
the confederation of left-wing forces. But I will ask it to 
create a new rapport with the left-wing forces in order to set 
Italy on a new track. 
  [Franchi] I almost forgot: What happened to your fling with 
[League Secretary] Bossi? 
  [Occhetto] What fling... I was well aware that Bossi wanted 
to use us too to raise the bidding in the government 
negotiations. But I also knew that Bossi had, and still has, a 
problem: Part of his voters are threatening to leave him for 
Forza Italia, while another part could leave him precisely 
because he has allied with Forza Italia. Be that as it may, 
Bossi has shouldered a serious responsibility. Without him, who 
was portrayed as the quintessence of the new, Berlusconi would 
not now be prime minister.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Environment Minister Hit With Wrath </F>
of Greens"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 12 -- Statements from the new 
minister for the environment, Altero Matteoli, that he favored 
nuclear energy, a highway through the Tuscan coastal reserve of 
Maremma, has sparked the wrath of Italian greens who declared 
their readiness to defend the earth. 
  The spokesman for the Greens and former environment 
minister, 
Vittorio Ripa de Meana, branded the appointment of Matteoli, a 
member of the righist National Alliance, as a "provocation" 
against mainstream environmental thinking. 
  Premier Silvio Berlusconi, he claimed "has decided to carry 
out a vulgar attack against this nation's environmental policy 
tapping as head of the ministry a person who is totally inept on 
environmental questions, who since yesterday has only babbled 
dangerous absurdities: a return to nuclear power, expanding 
highways, no limits to high-speed trains, trimming legislation 
which protects the environment." 
  World Wildlife Foundation [WWF] president Grazia Francescato 
issued a statement saying "I have the impression that he 
(Matteoli) has not understood that he is environment minister. 
Someone should explain to him that his job is to protect the 
environment, not work to destroy it". Nevertheless, the WWF 
said it hoped it was wrong and offered to give the new minister 
all information he needed to help him perform his duties. 
  Green Gianni Mattioli said the new minister "has always been 
an opponent of environmentalism, against parks and in favor of 
laying cement for profit," while Roberto Musacchio of Communist 
Refoundation stressed how a popular referendum was passed 
against nuclear energy and how many of the projects of the past 
which destroyed the environment were rooted in corruption. 
  Adelaide Aglietta, the Green whip in the European 
Parliament, 
said "the environment minister's declarations sound like a true 
declaration of war on the environment."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Fascist Skinheads Hold First </F>
National Demo"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Vicenza, May 15 -- Extreme right-wing 
skinheads with arms raised in the Fascist salute and wearing 
black leather jackets marched through the streets of this 
northern town Sunday [15 May] in their first national 
demonstration. Police estimated the number of demonstrators at 
"several hundred." 
  Led by Piero Puschiavo, who is under investigation here for 
attempting to re-organize the banned Fascist Party of Benito 
Mussolini, the skinheads shouted slogans and displayed signs 
against the republic and the mass media. 
  Puschiavo, who heads an organization calling itself the 
Veneto Skinheads Front, founded in Rome in 1991, at a rally 
following the march praised Fascist ideals and compared Fascists 
killed during World War II to those who died fighting against 
Mussolini and Hitler. 
  An 80-strong police force watched over the event and 
prevented clashes between the skinheads and anti-Fascist 
counterdemonstrators. 
  In local reactions, Vicenza deputy mayor Sergio Carta said 
"the event was at the very least inopportune in a city where an 
inquiry into this phenomenon is still open." 
  "It is singular that as soon as a centre-right government is 
installed, extremist positions automatically come to light," he 
went on, adding that "I have the impression that there is an 
attempt to soften or anaesthetise certain memories of this 
country and Europe as a whole, and I am worried by the absence 
of a civic reaction, because indifference brings the risk of 
violence prevailing." 
  The Veneto leader of the opposition Democratic Party of the 
Left sent Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro a telegramme 
expressing "the keenest concern over the signal given by the 
Vicenza neo-Nazi march, and the way it was underestimated by the 
authorities." 
  "I remind those who say that these are isolated phenomena 
that in Germany these groups are the subject of abundant 
legislation aimed at suppressing them," he added. 
  The chairman of Venice's Jewish Community, Sandro Romanelli, 
sent a message to President Scalfaro, Premier Berlusconi, and 
the Speakers of both Houses of Parliament, expressing his 
concern over the Vicenza rally. 
  A communique said the Jewish Community of Venice "calls on 
the Public Powers to exercise their due role and apply the law, 
and invites public opinion and all conscientious citizens to 
stand a democratic, antifascist guard, that our country may be 
spared useless violence at such a delicate moment in political 
life." 
  National police chief Vincenzo Parisi issued a communique 
this evening saying that he had issued instructions that no such 
marches or rallies will henceforth be allowed, in the interests 
of public order.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Skinhead Demonstrations; Maroni </F>
Issues Ban, Replaces Officials"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 16 -- As a national demonstration 
staged by skinheads Saturday [14 May] in the northern city of 
Vicenza continued to spark a hue and cry of protest throughout 
Italy, Interior Minister Roberto Maroni this evening said that 
he had imparted instructions that from now on such 
demonstrations would be banned and recalled the Vicenza police 
chief and prefect. 
  Maroni said that the Vicenza police chief had authorized the 
march off his own bat, without informing the ministry, and that 
the latter had evidently given the green light after taking only 
matters of public order and safety into account, with no 
political assessment. 
  In fact, no violence broke out during the demonstration, but 
the sight of hundreds of skinheads marching through the streets 
in black leather, arms raised in the Fascist salute, set off 
alarm bells up and down the peninsula. Already Sunday evening, 
national police chief Vincenzo Parisi issued a communique saying 
that he had issued instructions that no such marches or rallies 
would henceforth be allowed, in the interests of public order. 
  The Vicenza police chief Romano Argelio was said to be 
replaced by his colleague Di Censo, while the prefect Michele De 
Feis was being replaced by Castronovo. 
  Meanwhile, it was learned that police blocked an attempted 
demonstration outside the French embassy in Rome Monday night 
[16 May] by a score or so of extreme right-wing youths belonging 
to an association called Spina nel Fianco (Thorn in the Side). 
  Men from the special Digos branch of the police force 
detained the youths who said they wanted to commemorate 
Sebastien Dyzisu, the 22-year-old ultra who plunged to his death 
from a fifth-floor window in Paris on May 7 trying to escape 
police after clashes which erupted when a skinhead boutique was 
shut down. Among the members of Spina nel Fianco detained and 
later released was Stefano Andrini who, along with his brother 
Germano, was convicted in 1991 to 4 years and 8 months in jail 
for taking part, along with other skinheads, in an attack on two 
youths in Rome in June of 1989. 
  For his part, Gianfranco Fini, leader of the rightist 
National Alliance [AN], said those who took part in the skinhead 
demonstration in Vicenza over the weekend were numbskulls who 
would do better to go work in the mines. There is absolutely no 
connection between the entrance of the AN in the government and 
this first ever national skinhead demonstration in Italy, he 
insisted. 
  It was later learned that he called for the withdrawal of a 
bill presented earlier by the AN to abrogate that part of the 
Constitution which bans the recreation of the Fascist Party. 
  The Vicenza demonstration was led by Piero Puschiavo, who is 
under investigation for attempting to re-form the banned Fascist 
Party of Benito Mussolini. 
  Puschiavo, who heads an organization calling itself the 
Veneto Skinheads Front, founded in Rome in 1991, at a rally 
following the march praised Fascist ideals and compared Fascists 
killed during World War II to those who died fighting against 
Mussolini and Hitler.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Race Distinctions `Make One </F>
Shudder,' Scalfaro Says"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Florence, May 17 -- "Every now and then we 
have painful manisfestations that smack of bullying, invading 
the freedom of others, and despising others because they are 
different; they smack of a distinction -- which makes one 
shudder -- on the grounds of race," said Italian President Oscar 
Luigi Scalfaro today, in the wake of the controversial weekend 
national neo-Nazi skinhead rally in the northern town of Vicenza. 
  Scalfaro made no direct reference to the rally -- which 
spurred Interior Minister Roberto Maroni to ban repetitions and 
suspend the local police chief and prefect (top government 
representative) -- in a speech at Italy's oldest charity 
organisation, the Misericordia of Florence. But he did say, 
addressing the present members of the 750-year-old voluntary 
work organisation, that "you are a response to all this". 
  Referring to present-day extremists' balaclavas and to the 
early members of the Misericordia's practice of wearing cowls to 
be able to do their good works anonymously, Scalfaro said "there 
has been a leap, over 750 years, from covering one's face so 
that no one might know who is doing good, to covering one's face 
in order to be able to do ill". 
  In later remarks, Scalfaro referred to racist manifestations 
as "an expression of that terrible evil which is to think of 
oneself only, from which stem also wars, violence and the search 
for spasmodic wealth". The response to "all this evil", he 
said, is to solve "the fundamental crisis of today's world, a 
crisis of love". 
  At the end of the ceremony at the Misericordia, Scalfaro 
walked to the Florence Prefecture for a luncheon with Queen 
Margrethe II of Denmark, with whom he will inaugurate the show 
Royal Treasures of Denmark at Palazzo Pitti this afternoon.

<F P=106> [Interview with LA REPUBBLICA editor Eugenio Scalfari: </F>
"Fascism Is Not the Danger"] 
  [Text] Italian democracy could be endangered, not by the 
presence of neofascist ministers in Silvio Berlusconi's 
right-wing government, but by the social tensions that its 
policies could arouse, Mr Berlusconi's arch-opponent warned 
yesterday. Eugenio Scalfari, the distinguished editor of the 
left-wing daily LA REPUBBLICA, who had long spearheaded the 
battle against the old political regime before the corruption 
scandals sealed its fate, was contemplating its successor: a 
government led by Mr Berlusconi in person and including the 
federalist Northern League and the heirs of fascism. 
  Dr Scalfari, like many influential Italians, is not as 
alarmed as people abroad about the presence of ministers from 
the extreme right-wing National Alliance in the cabinet. On the 
one hand, he said in an interview with THE INDEPENDENT, "they 
have never repudiated their continuity with fascism, their 
historical and cultural continuity, and particularly their 
derivation from the Republic of Salo" -- the puppet government 
headed by the dictator Benito Mussolini, which ran Nazi-occupied 
northern Italy from 1943 to 1945 and fought the Italian 
partians. That was "the worst kind of fascism," he said. 
  On the other hand, however, "I nust honestly say that they 
are no longer fascists now, because fascism is unthinkable in 
Italy today. They are exponents of the most right-wing right in 
Italy, the Italian extreme right." At the same time there was a 
"danger of contagion, in Germany and also in France. We are 
only too aware that Italy has once already been the start of a 
European contagion." 
  In Italy they "are not a danger to democracy," Dr Scalfari 
said. He worried, however, about their future policies -- their 
attitude to immigrants and the Catholic Church. He recalled 
that Mussolini, in order to gain respectability, negotiated a 
concordat with the church which made Italy subject to church 
laws against, for instance, divorce and abortion, for many 
years, in order to win its support for his regime. 
  Dr Scalfari was particularly worried about the government's 
Reaganite laissez-faire economic ideas. The recent sackings of 
many tens of thousands of workers had been tolerated because at 
that point the government in charge was more or less 
centre-left. "The sackings which will take place from this 
moment on will be seen as a class conflict," he warned. 
  "This government which the stock exchange and and the 
financial markets like so much...the stock exchange does not 
realise that it can do practically nothing that it wants and 
hopes for, because if it did, there would be riots in the 
streets." 
  Such things, he said, "could put democracy at risk. I am not 
afraid of fascism. But they could provoke social tensions so 
bitter that they could create a situation of risk." 
  If social or regional egoism took the upper hand and social 
solidarity disappeared, "then a danger of a dictatorship could 
emerge." 
  Another fear was that the Northern League's federalism, 
particularly its fiscal federalism, could effectively mean the 
end of the Italian state. "A certain degree of federalism, with 
certain limits, would be right," he said. But he was highly 
sceptical of the League's proposals that taxes be collected by 
local governments -- and mostly spent where they originated, 
with only a very limited amount to be passed on to the national 
government for defence, justice and a few other "services." 
  "It would be like the European Community -- we pay our taxes 
to our national governments and they pay their contributions to 
the Community. If that happened in Italy," he said flatly, 
"there would not be a state any more." 
  He shared the fear of the italian president, Oscar Luigi 
Scalfaro, that Italy might then break up. "I am afraid it could 
happen." 
  The League's ideas, he went on, "would leave the southern 
regions, the poorer ones, with no more (financial) means." If 
this aim really was achieved, and if the rich regions kept their 
money, "the south would turn into dynamite." 
  Dr Scalfari had been a fierce opponent of Silvio Berlusconi 
long before the latter entered politics, and now has no 
confidence whatever in the formula devised by the media mogul -- 
owner, among many other things, of half the nation's television 
networks and a huge publishing empire -- to allay concern of a 
conflict of interests while he is in office. 
  Mr Berlusconi's appointment of "three wise men" to study and 
propose improvements to Italy's anticartel laws was irrelevant, 
he said. For a start, "they were nominated by the person they 
are supposed to supervise." One of them was a member of Mr 
Berlusconi's team of lawyers. 
  For instance, he said, Mr Berlusconi's Fininvest company 
pays 
the state about 7 billion lire (2.9 million pounds) a year for 
the use of its television frequencies. The state broadcasting 
corporation RAI used to pay 170 billion lire a year. Recently, 
because the RAI is in severe financial difficulties, it was 
reduced to 40 billion. ``Faced with a situation like that, any 
serious government would say `either we bring the RAI down to 7 
billion or Fininvest up to 40 billion.' 
  ``Here there is a conflict of interest between Berlusconi 
the 
prime minister and Berlusconi the owner of Fininvest. If 
Berlusconi doesn't do anything and leaves the situation as it 
is, this is a conflict of interest. The three wise men don't 
have the task of studying problems like this, they have to 
improve the anticartel laws. But what do anticartel laws have 
to do with a situation like this?'' 
  In election broadcasts, Mr Berlusconi, when asked about his 
lack of experience in politics, remarked dismissively that while 
building up his vast empire he had faced far more difficult 
tasks than those confronting any prime minister. Dr Scalfari 
believes he has another thing coming. 
  "Running a government is nothing like running a company if 
you are in a democratic state. You can run a company because 
you are the boss, but then a company is not a democracy." 
  One might be able to govern well in a dictatorship, but in a 
democracy one has an obligation to take into account many other 
views and concerns. 
  The new government, he concluded, would be in some ways 
better than the last government of the old political order, but 
in other ways it would be worse. Better, because the old ones 
were corrupt and had basically commandeered the state for their 
own ends. Worse, because while the old leaders had parties with 
long political traditions and ideals behind them, "these have 
nothing -- just fascism, small northern businessmen and the 
Fininvest company."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Craxi Ordered To Stand Trial"] </F>
  [Excerpt] (ANSA) Milan, May 12 -- Former Socialist Party 
secretary and ex-premier Bettino Craxi has been ordered to stand 
trial for his role in the fraudulent bankruptcy of the Banco 
Ambrosiano and for the kickbacks the bank paid into the party's 
so- called "protection account" in Switzerland. 
  Also on trial will be Craxi's ex-right hand and former 
justice minister Claudio Martelli; the head of the outlawed 
secret free mason P-2 lodge Licio Gelli; the former vice 
chairman of the state fuels group ENI [National Hydrocarbons 
Corporation], Leonardo Di Donna; and architect Silvano Larini. 
  All face charges of fraudulent bankruptcy in connection with 
the collapse, in the early 1980s, of the Banco Ambrosiano of the 
late Roberto Calvi and for the latter's 20 billion dollar 
financing of the Socialist Party through a Swiss bank. The 
trial is slated to open June 16. 
  The court here has also ordered that the passports of those 
indicted be confiscated. The confiscation of Craxi's passport 
had already been ordered earlier in the day, while Martelli's 
passport was confiscated last week, and Gelli has not had a 
passport for years. 
  The decision was branded by Craxi as being "persecutory" and 
he claimed he was being unfairly discriminated against through 
being treated differently than the others. 
  The former premier, and close friend of the current 
government chief, Silvio Berlusconi, went on to accuse 
magistrates of conduct which was "discriminatory, politically 
exploiting and morally odious". 
  The action taken against him, Craxi argued, was not based 
"on 
any reason nor any convincing justification. Against every 
action which is of only a persecutory nature I intend to 
continue to defend myself. I will do it not only for myself but 
also to ensure that the balanced and correct use of judicial 
power represent a civilized barrier for all". [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Paolo Franchi: "Words and Deeds"] </F>
  [Text] A glance at initial opposition reaction to [Prime 
Minister] Silvio Berlusconi's investiture speech yields 
something for all -- from the charge that the prime minister is 
merely a new kind of Doroteo [former conservative Christian 
Democratic Party faction] to the criticism of his slight 
vagueness with regard to policies, and invectives against the 
videocrat who confuses a policy platform with a television 
commercial. Of course, in all of these reactions there may be a 
grain of truth and justification, and perhaps something more. 
But altogether they confirm the following pessimistic 
observation: If the winners are still a long way from providing 
all the reassurances demanded of them, the losers are even 
further away from correctly identifying the nature of their 
adversaries and of what kind of opposition they intend to carry 
out. 
  Berlusconi faced three problems. The first was how to make 
apparent the characteristics -- liberal in politics and 
derestrictive in economics -- of the change of course that his 
government intends to impart to the country; and on the whole he 
has succeeded brilliantly in this, at least in principle. As 
for the specific feasibility of the objectives indicated and the 
paths proposed for attaining them, we can only agree with what 
the prime minister has asked, namely, that the government be 
judged on the basis of its deeds, not on the basis of 
preconceptions. This, even though -- and this really is no 
minor consideration -- we still refuse to regard as a prejudice 
or, worse, as a restriction of the political rights of a citizen 
and businessman, the demand, -- with regard to which Berlusconi 
still remained rather vague, to say the least -- for guarantees 
that will immediately dispel even the suspicion of confusion 
between the public interest and private interests. 
  Berlusconi's second, and more difficult, problem was how to 
provide the Italian and international public with strong 
reassurances of the democratic reliability of a majority and a 
government of which Northern League and especially postfascist 
ministers are authoritative members. With regard to the League 
members, what benefited Berlusconi even more than his remarks 
about the unity and indivisibility of the Italy of the 100 
cities and the "respect and interest" to be granted to the 
"debate on federalism" was [League ideologue] Miglio's sudden 
divorce -- by no means by mutual consent -- from [League 
Secretary] Bossi who, according to the League's octogenarian 
enfant terrible, is guilty of having sold the federalist 
revolution for a mess of pottage. 
  The problem of the National Alliance is of a different and 
thornier kind. Especially the day after the shameful and 
intolerable skinhead demonstration in Vicenza, it was truly 
justifiable to expect some clearer and more incisive remarks 
from the prime minister on the subject of fascism and 
antifascism. This, partly and, we are inclined to say, above 
all, in order to grant the proper prominence to the most 
convincing aspect of Berlusconi's argument, that concerning the 
necessity and advisability of proceeding along the path of the 
complete "constitutionalization of extremes" if we really do 
intend to create a proper two-party system in Italy too. 
  This in fact leads onto the third problem that Berlusconi 
had 
to tackle: how to demand from the opposition forces full 
legitimization to govern for himself, his majority, and his 
government. Though "the difference of historical assessments of 
the past" with regard to fascism is not exactly a matter of 
academic debate, and even though the League remains an unruly 
ally, to say the least, on the whole Berlusconi found the right 
words to achieve this. It will not be easy for the Left -- 
assuming that it aspires to win the next contest to govern the 
country -- to maintain the ambiguity of, on the one hand, 
promising combative democratic opposition while, on the other 
hand, portraying itself as the champion of freedom in jeopardy. 
It will be even less easy for the Center opposition, assuming 
that it does not intend to form an appendage of the Left, to 
ignore the issue with which Berlusconi is directly confronting 
it, namely, that of permitting this government, which lacks a 
majority in the Senate, to be put to the test. This, without 
granting it any political blank checks or jeopardizing its own 
votes. 
  Far be it from us to suggest any particular tactic to the 
various forces. But the prospect of a government that governs 
and of opposition forces that engage in opposition seems to us 
the most realistic and desirable. Certainly much more realistic 
and much more desirable -- for everyone -- than the risky 
prospect of another election or of messy pseudo-institutional 
muddles that would follow the Senate's failure to approve the 
government. At least as far as it was in his power to do so, 
despite all the shortcomings of his speech, Berlusconi does not 
seem to have made such a prospect any more remote. Certainly, 
Berlusconi's show of flexibility would have been more convincing 
if the majority had not recently attempted such rash moves as 
that in connection with the chairmanship of the Senate committee 
on authorizations to initiate legal proceedings. It is to be 
hoped that words are matched by deeds.

<F P=106> [Paolo Franchi commentary: "Umberto the Tactician"] </F>
  [Text] That much-maligned thing, politics, may not be an 
art. But it does seem likely to remain, in our country too, a 
discipline having its own rules, its own "fundamental articles," 
and its own internal codes. A discipline in which we are not 
all equally expert. Moreover, a discipline whose professionals 
reveal their real capabilities when everything seems to militate 
against them. And they are forced -- as in the case of Umberto 
Bossi, as Lucio Colletti highlighted in this newspaper Saturday 
[7 May] -- to perform tightrope acts to try to get out of a very 
dangerous predicament. 
  Let us be clear about this. In such an act, the business of 
the Interior Ministry was just an initial step; further very 
dangerous steps lay ahead for the League's acrobat, starting 
with the imminent European elections. But it was undoubtedly a 
crucial test. If, as seems to be the case, in the list of 
ministers that Silvio Berlusconi will submit to the chief of 
state today, the Interior Ministry will be allocated to Roberto 
Maroni, the League will deserve some congratulations, and it is 
pointless to deny it. This, if only from those who have never 
believed that the demise of the First Republic entailed the 
inevitable shelving of politics. For days and days, in the 
crude -- to say the least -- language to which the League itself 
has greatly helped to accustom us, we have wondered whether, to 
what extent, and how Bossi had "adopted a posture of submission" 
after Berlusconi's rejection of Maroni's candidacy, for reasons 
which, curiously, the prime minister- designate deemed too 
delicate to convey to the public. 
  We wondered about the actual likelihood that [Judge] Antonio 
Di Pietro -- perhaps in response to an improbable demand by 
[President] Scalfaro -- had acted as a "deus ex machina." An 
ever longer and vaguer list was drawn up of other authoritative 
magistrates who could have replaced Di Pietro, after his 
refusal. We paid serious heed to the League leader's latest 
diversion tactic, his suggestion of the Milan police chief 
[Achille Serra] as a possible interior minister. 
  Sooner or later, and rather sooner than later, we will 
discover the real background to this incredible performance. 
However, even now we must acknowledge that Bossi has proved to 
be the most skillful in this game of names. Committed not only, 
and not so much, to securing for the League the ministry that 
was once the symbol of the eternity of DC [Christian Democratic 
Party] power, but also, and above all, to demonstrating what an 
arduous task it will be for Berlusconi to transform himself from 
the unquestioned winner of the elections into the authoritative 
prime minister of the Second Republic. On the basis of the way 
things have turned out, Bossi could say that he has succeeded in 
this latter, and for him more vital, operation, even if at the 
last moment Maroni himself were to fall victim to the hail of 
intersecting vetoes. 
  We are talking about tactics, of course. About the certain 
amount of totally unscrupulous tactics which, with apologies to 
the proponents of new-style ethics, the formation of a coalition 
government necessarily entails -- and this, not through any 
unavowable sin on the part of the coalition partners. Strategy 
is another matter, of course. Even for that tightrope walker, 
Bossi. Let him make the most of things while he can. But he is 
probably the first to realize that he needs to resort to 
something more than clever maneuvering and perhaps some 
half-baked fellow-feeling with the PDS [Democratic Party of the 
Left] in order to impart a new boost to the League.

  [Text] Rome, May 17 -- Polish Prime Minister Waldemar 
Pawlak, on a visit to Italy, was received by Pope John Paul II 
on Tuesday [17 May]. 
  Prime Minister Pawlak coming out of the meeting said that 
the 
pope was feeling well. He said he discussed with the pope the 
social, economic and political situation in Poland. 
  Pawlak added that during the meeting, the two also touched 
upon the question of the ratification of the concordat signed by 
the Republic of Poland and the Holy See. 
  In Pawlak's opinion "the parliamentary debate on the 
ratification of the concordat will be very difficult. I am 
convinced that it will end favourably," said the prime minister. 
  The Polish-born pope is staying at the Gemelli Clinic where 
he is recovering from a broken right thigh bone since April 29. 
  Before meeting with the pope, Prime Minister Pawlak laid a 
wreath at the altar of the homeland and toured the colosseum 
together with members of the Polish delegation. 
  Following the meeting with the pope, the prime minister went 
to the Vatican where he was received by secretary of state, 
Cardinal Angelo Sodano.

<F P=106> [Interview with OECD Secretary General Jean-Claude Paye by </F>
Beatrice Bazil; place and date not given: "Jean-Claude Paye: 
Toward an Organization With a Variable Geometry"] 
  [Excerpts] Facing competition from three other candidates 
(from Canada, Great Britain, and Germany), Jean-Claude Paye, 
OECD secretary general since 1984, is now a candidate for his 
own succession, supported by the French Government, to serve out 
his third consecutive term in office. His strong points include 
having demonstrated his capacity for managing the changing 
mission of the OECD in the light of the new balance of world 
forces and being in the best position to bring the shift that is 
currently under way to its conclusion. His handicap is being a 
European. 
  [Bazil] By supporting the candidacy of a Canadian, the 
United 
States would appear to be seeking to bring the OECD back under 
its wing, or at least contest its eurocentric character and 
European leadership since 1961. What do you think of this? 
  [Paye] In my eyes, the important thing is that at a time of 
uncertainty and change throughout the world, the OECD is able to 
remain an objective, peaceful forum for consultations between 
countries. This presupposes that the necessary agreements can 
be reached within it. 
  If the impression is given that the OECD is being used as a 
means of exerting pressure at the service of one country or 
another or a group of countries, then the machine will become 
blocked. 
  [Bazil] In saying that, are you having a go at the United 
States? 
  [Paye] Not at all! You are the one saying that the United 
States wants to get rid of a European secretary general so as to 
use the Organization for their own benefit. If that is the 
calculation they are making, then they have gotten their sums 
wrong. I hope they are not reasoning along such lines and that 
it is simply out of principle that they would like to see the 
OECD change its leader after a certain period of time, which in 
my book is not a compelling argument in itself. 
  What is more, why should the United States seek to "regain" 
its influence over the OECD? It has always exerted such 
influence. Quite frequently in recent years it is the United 
States which has pushed for the exploration of new areas. When 
the secretariat believed that these proposals were justified and 
were pointing in the same direction as general interests, it 
helped the United States to convince other countries of this 
fact. 
  [Bazil] Today, some candidates are arguing that the OECD has 
greater prominence and is playing a more political role... 
  [Paye] It is the governments that must choose. Personally, I 
believe that it would be wrong to politicize the OECD. The 
constant danger in an organization for dialogue such as the 
OECD, is of provoking a public confrontation between countries. 
It is not by being antagonistic and beating on this drum that 
the secretary general will manage to play a useful role. In my 
opinion, the quest for a more political profile of the OECD does 
not appear to be a way of making it more efficient. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Bazil] What is your view of the future for the OECD? Does 
the OECD not risk losing its identity by opening up to countries 
with a very different culture and past history than our own, 
like Mexico or South Korea? 
  [Paye] The OECD is currently faced with a dilemma. Today, 
virtually all the countries of the world are counting on the 
market economy as a means of economic growth and social 
development. Many of them are rapidly nearing the averages set 
by the OECD. The OECD must open up to these countries under 
pain of going into decline. Intergovernmental cooperation that 
was limited to certain countries and ignored the new major 
players in the world arena would lose its pertinence. 
  On the other hand, the modus operandi of the OECD 
presupposes 
a certain homogeneity between the member countries, a similar 
approach to problems, and a willingness to reach consensus. 
This "culture" must be enriched, but also maintained. So I 
believe we must be selective when choosing new members as well 
as cautious with regard to the pace at which we open up the 
organization. The countries applying to join the organization 
can start off by participating in certain activities, 
familiarizing themselves with it, and gradually approximating 
their policies and institutions to the tone expected of them 
after their accession. Mexico, which has just become a member, 
underwent this process and South Korea, like several Central 
European countries, is currently undergoing it too. The OECD, 
however, is not only interested in countries that might join 
within the near future. In fact, it is developing its relations 
with a large number of countries around the world in various 
ways. 
  [Bazil] Does that mean we will soon see a multispeed OECD? 
  [Paye] Let us imagine the world 15 years from now and 
imagine 
that a market economy has been established everywhere. To 
remain useful, the OECD will have to include the principal 
economic powers, whether large countries or sufficiently 
well-integrated regional groupings. Working methods will have 
progressed: The European Union will undoubtedly speak on behalf 
of its member states; less well-integrated groupings will be 
represented by their leading countries or, in each committee, by 
the countries most closely involved, or maybe there will even be 
rotating representation. By means of a kind of variable 
geometry, the OECD will manage to remain an official forum for 
effective dialogue between the most prominent economies in the 
world at that time.

<F P=106> [Report signed "est": "UN Human Rights Commissioner Visits </F>
Vienna"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- Austria agrees with new UN High 
Commissioner for Human Rights Jose Ayala Lasso, who demands that 
the Geneva-based UN Human Rights Commission hold a special 
meeting on Rwanda soon. The high commissioner, who was appointed 
at the beginning of April and had protested against the 
"genocide" there when he visited Rwanda last week, came to 
Vienna on Monday [16 May] on his first official visit abroad. 
  Foreign Minister Alois Mock promised the 62 year old 
diplomat 
from Ecuador Austria's full support, since the protection of 
human rights is "an important part of our foreign policy" and 
the "high commissioner is, casually speaking, a product of last 
year's UN Human Rights Conference in Vienna." 
  Asked by DER STANDARD how he plans to react to human rights 
violations, Ayala Lasso said he wants to "take a new path of 
seeking dialogue" with the governments concerned. If this does 
not help, there is still the traditional way of "pointing out 
and condemning violations and publicizing them."

<F P=106> [Report by Norbert Mayer: "Vranitzky Wants EU Help for </F>
Eastern Reform States"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- "The European Union [EU] must help 
promote the evolution toward democracy in the neighboring 
reform states today," Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky said 
in a talk he gave before the renowned Paul Henri Spaak 
Foundation in Brussels on Wednesday [18 May]. 
  With all the criticism of the Community's pragmatic 
step-by-step course, one tends to forget the economic and 
political success of integration. A military confrontation in 
Western Europe is unthinkable today. "The tragedy in 
ex-Yugoslavia is dramatic evidence of this," the chancellor 
emphasized. 
  Vranitzky said that Austria's specific contributions after 
joining the EU will be its commitment for Central and Eastern 
Europe, as well as some impulses in environmental policy. The 
transit agreement is a milestone on the way toward an ecological 
transport policy. Austria will also show a strong commitment in 
social affairs. 
  The deepening of integration and enlargement do not 
contradict each other; these are just two sides of the same 
coin. "The challenges of the next few decades -- preserving 
European competitiveness, protecting jobs, preventing 
environmental disasters, stabilizing Eastern Europe, and 
reacting jointly to the pressures of migration -- could hardly 
have been tackled by the original six European Community members 
alone." 
  The fear that in coping with these tasks, Austria is part of 
a "North European bloc," is unfounded. "We have applied for 
membership in a Union that represents all of Europe." Austria's 
traditional role of mediator and its ability to reach a 
consensus are helpful in this.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Czech Republic Criticizes Mock"] </F>
  [Text] Prague -- The planned award of the "European 
Charles IV Prize" of the Sudeten German Landsmannschaft to 
Foreign Minister Alois Mock, Mock's interview on Sudeten German 
issues as well as the invitation for Czech politicians to attend 
the 45th Sudeten German congress in Nuremberg have given rise to 
harsh criticism in Prague. 
  By awarding the "European Charles IV Prize," which is not 
identical with the Charlemagne Prize awarded in Aachen, the 
Landsmannschaft next Saturday [21 May] wants to pay tribute to 
Mock's intensive work for "a just order of people and states in 
Central Europe." 
  On Tuesday, Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus expressed surprise 
about the fact that the prize will be awarded to Mock. He said 
in a radio interview that he does not believe this is an 
Austrian initiative. 
  An article by Mock in the latest edition of the weekly 
SUDETENDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG, the organ of the Landsmannschaft, has 
also caused some excitement recently, since the foreign minister 
came out in favor of establishing a dialogue between the 
Landsmannschaft and the Czech Republic. 
<H5>  The Social Democratic Party of Austria [SPOe] Distances </H5>
Itself 
  Mock's "shoulder-to-shoulder stance" with the leadership of 
the Sudeten German Landsmannschaft is not only an affront to the 
Czech Republic but also to the coalition's good neighbor policy, 
SPOe International Secretary Karl Schramek said. 
  Mock reacted to the storm of criticism by saying that he 
will 
continue to advocate the safeguarding of human rights and to 
oppose their violation.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Paul Vaute: "Dehaene's Team Fears Implosion"] </F>
  [Excerpt] If the upcoming European elections confirm the 
results of the latest opinion polls, the current government 
majority will represent just 36 to 37 percent of the electorate 
in Flanders, while in French-speaking Belgium it will just hold 
on at the 50 percent mark. Even these figures could be overly 
optimistic, however. 
  While the DIMARSO DE MORGEN poll, published a few days ago, 
still gave the French-speaking Socialist Party (PS) 31.2 percent 
(with 19.3 percent for the Social Christian Party (PSC), this 
could not have taken into account the effect of the recent 
Hainault scandals, which were all the more traumatic since they 
hit the federation assumed to be the most solid and disciplined 
in the party. In the north, the previously dominant Flemish 
Christian People's Party (CVP) was still on around 21.9 percent 
while the Flemish Socialist Party (SP) stood at 15.2 percent. 
Another global survey on Belgium by THE EUROPEAN gave the PS 24 
percent and the PSC 23 percent. This would give the coalition 
47 percent, and therefore less than the critical threshold. 
  Of course, in principle these elections are about renewing 
the European Parliament in Strasbourg, and are not a 
pronouncement on the national level. However, the political 
leaderships are under no illusions: The effect of a debacle 
would be considerable. How could the government "hold on" for 
almost a year and a half, to the end of this legislature, 
knowing that the coalition could not be reestablished? How 
could the coalition parties resist, during this long period at 
the end of their reign, the temptation to lay the ground for the 
future with a top secret wooing of blues or greens? 
  Just as revealing of the underlying fragility is the extent 
of the speculation surrounding the chances of [Prime Minister] 
Dehaene's team surviving if its great helmsman were to succeed 
[European Commission President] Delors. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [`hal'-signed report: "DIHT Sees No Reason To Criticize </F>
Net-Payer Position"] 
  [Text] Bonn 17 May -- Despite Germany's hefty payments to 
the European Union [EU], German industry is profiting greatly 
from the European single market. The German Federation of Trade 
and Industry [DIHT] considers it necessary to indicate this fact 
in good time before the European elections. 
  "The waves of criticism vis-a-vis Germany's net-payer 
position should not go any higher," DIHT's Peter Korn told 
FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE in Brussels, where he and fellow DIHT 
employees presented a report entitled "Germany -- the Paymaster 
of Europe?" 
  The occasion for this report was the Bundesbank's November 
1993 monthly report, which had led people to believe that 
Germany was at a disadvantage because it was making excessive 
net payments to the EU. These net payments are the difference 
between Germany's contributions to the EU budget and the 
services that Germany has already derived from the EU. In 1992, 
this net payment amounted to 22.1 billion German marks [DM]. 
However, for 30 years now, German enterprises have been reaping 
greater advantages from European integration than the 
enterprises of other countries because they have always 
maintained close economic contacts with foreign enterprises, 
said DIHT business manager Franz Schoser. He admitted that the 
advantages of the European single market for the national 
economies of EU member countries are relatively difficult to 
document. "However, the mere continuation of the EU's growth in 
the 1980's and 1990's serves to emphasize the stimulating 
effects of this single market," he said. 
  In 1991, German payments to the EU budget rose by 46.7 
percent against 1990 and amounted to DM33 billion. In 1992 they 
rose by another 8.2 percent, reaching DM35 billion. The 
Bundesbank criticized this increase because, in terms of the 
ratio between the GNP and average purchasing power in the EU 
countries, united Germany has dropped to sixth place in the 
European prosperity league. In its report, the DIHT points out 
that the EU Commission used to apply a different method of 
reckoning, and used the ratio between per capita GNP expressed 
in ECU's on the one hand, and market prices of commodities on 
the other hand, as a basis for assessing prosperity. By this 
method, postunification Germany was in third place, behind 
Denmark and Luxembourg. Altogether, therefore, the German net 
contribution to the EU suits Germany's size and economic 
potential. In 1991, financial refluxes from Brussels back to 
Germany were 28.4 percent less than in 1990 and amounted to DM14 
billion; in 1992 they sank by 2.9 percent and amounted to DM13.6 
billion. The DIHT has no criticism of the refluxes, but is 
critical of the distortions caused by the agrarian portion of 
the European budget. Thus, German agriculture has received 14.6 
percent of the resources of the Agrarian Fund, while at the same 
time German agriculture only takes up 1.1 percent of the German 
GNP. 
  What is decisive is that Germany is the main beneficiary of 
free trade within the EU. The DIHT welcomes the fact that in 
the meantime, the EU has recognized the eastern laender as a 
top-priority aid region, thanks to which between 1994 and 1999, 
the eastern laender received DM27.6 billion out of the 
Restructuring Fund. 
  The DIHT doubts whether Germany will be granted a rebate in 
its payments to the EU, like Great Britain. A limited German 
rebate would only be expedient as a temporary measure. The main 
objective of European policy must be to bring about a change in 
common agrarian policy and to render the new laender appropriate 
assistance within the framework of regional policy.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Interior Minister Manfred Kanther by </F>
Gerhardt Pelletier; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Pelletier] Minister Kanther, according to the 
latest reports, two more SPD [Social Democratic Party of 
Germany]-governed laender, in other words Lower Saxony and 
Saarland, want to join the ban on deporting Kurds. You have 
spoken out vehemently against this. Why? 
  [Kanther] Because one of the features of the German asylum 
compromise is that when an asylum review procedure is completed 
and it is established that the person in question does not 
qualify for asylum, the answer is deportation. In the case of 
deportation, it is necessary to be able to deport the persons 
involved to a country where they are safe from persecution, and 
the Kurds are safe in most of Turkey. Most of the Kurds do not 
live in those areas where the civil war is taking place, but in 
other parts of Turkey, therefore we can also deport them. 
  [Pelletier] But the SPD interior ministers who wish to do 
this are saying that the return of the Kurds to southeast Turkey 
is not safe at all, and situation reports by the Foreign 
Ministry indicate that they would be subject to further 
persecution and might expect punishment, torture, and even 
death. Do you accept this possibility? 
  [Kanther] That is completely wrong. I neither accept it, 
nor does the Foreign Ministry situation report say anything 
about it. We must differentiate between Kurdistan, where there 
is civil war, and the rest of Turkey, the larger part, and we 
deport people back to Turkey, not to Kurdistan. We deport them 
to a country where most of the Kurds live peacefully and fully 
undisturbed. Whoever abandons the so-called principle of 
internal state escape possibility aimed at finding a safer 
locality in his country of origin, whoever abandons this 
principle in Germany, invites all those wanting to come to 
Germany to stay here forever. That cannot possibly be the right 
policy. 
  [Pelletier] According to the media, you told Schaefer today 
that he is perforating the asylum compromise. Can the SPD 
laender that would prefer to see a Germanwide solution not 
postpone the deportation of Kurds for the time being, in 
accordance with the asylum compromise? 
  [Kanther] The asylum law in force provides a clear answer to 
that. A land can postpone deportation for six months, as a 
result of its own decision. If it wants to postpone deportation 
for longer than six months, it needs to coordinate with the 
remaining laender and obtain permission from the federal 
interior minister. To this extent, there is a responsible 
political decision by the laender. But the issue is so important 
that as federal interior minister, I not only have a legal 
opinion on this matter, which is obvious, but also a political 
opinion, and I consider that a great error, and I insist that 
the SPD laender governments also adopt a uniform interpretation 
of our asylum law and law on foreigners.

<F P=106> [Interview with Justice Minister Sabine </F>
Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger by Cornelia von Wrangel; place and 
date not given: "One Cannot Put Everyone Into Detention Pending 
Trial"] 
  [Excerpts] [Von Wrangel] In Magdeburg about 40 young 
people hunted down foreigners. Is it not finally time for the 
judiciary to act more strictly against young criminals? 
  [Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger] It is very alarming that in 
Germany foreigners are hunted down in the streets while many 
people look on indifferently. Particularly in the new laender 
the judiciary is reacting with great consistency and is fully 
applying the valid laws. In contrast to repeated demands, it is 
not necessary to change the youth penal code. However, it is 
very important that, in order to combat right-wing extremist and 
xenophobic crimes, we quickly implement the changes envisaged in 
the anticrime law: that instigators can be punished more 
easily, that the use of Nazi-like symbols is banned, and that 
carrying these symbols is a punishable offense. In our penal 
code there are still certain gray zones, which we must eliminate 
by making clear changes to the valid laws. 
  [Von Wrangel] Is it another such change that it will be 
punishable by law to say that Auschwitz is a lie? 
  [Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger] Yes. It is very important 
that the denial of the holocaust must be punished as incitement 
in any case. The coalition round has followed my proposal. 
Next week it will also be included in the discussions about the 
anticrime law. 
  [Von Wrangel] However, adolescent criminals between 18 and 
21 are still being punished in line with the criminal law 
relating to young offenders. Do you call this deterrence? 
  [Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger] This is not automatically so. 
In about 70 percent of the cases adolescents are punished in 
line with the youth penal code and in 30 percent in line with 
the adult penal code. In the trial of the attack in Moelln one 
adolescent criminal was punished in line with the adult penal 
code, and the young perpetrators were given the highest sentence 
-- 10 years in prison. This shows that these possibilities of 
punishment, that is, prison terms even in the first instance of 
violent acts, do indeed have a deterrent effect on young people 
and adolescents. The important thing is that the trials be held 
quickly and that years are not allowed to pass before a decision 
is made, because then threats of punishment hardly have a 
deterring effect. 
  [Von Wrangel] Is it deterrence that the morning after the 
Magdeburg riots the only two young people who were still in 
detention were those for whom previous arrest warrants had been 
issued for similar offenses? All the others were released. 
  [Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger] This does not mean that no 
criminal proceedings will be initiated against these young 
people. One cannot put everybody into detention pending trial. 
However, the anti-crime law now envisages easier arrest in case 
of recidivism, which has no precondition of a previous sentence 
in the past five years. The Free Democratic Party of Germany 
also insisted that a system of public prosecutors' 
investigations be established. This makes it possible to find 
out whether proceedings are pending in any other town. This is 
a far better basis for deciding whether the danger of recidivism 
exists and whether an arrest warrant must be issued for that 
reason. [passage omitted] 
  [Von Wrangler] Apropos young people: Does the so-called 
hashish ruling pave the way for a more liberal drug policy? 
  [Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger] The ruling of the Federal 
Constitutional Court on soft drugs has been completely 
misunderstood by the public, because the Federal Constitutional 
Court just confirmed our law, according to which the possession 
of small amounts of drugs for one's own consumption is also 
punishable. Then the Federal Constitutional Court said that 
punishment may be unnecessary if small amounts are involved. 
Actually, this is precisely the situation that we have at the 
moment. Among the justice ministers of the laender we have 
dealt with the question of what is to be defined as a small 
amount. The Federal Constitutional Court has not answered this 
question. There are very different ideas, ranging from 2-30 
grams. So far, we have not been able to agree on a uniform line 
and, therefore, we will meet again this year. 
  [Von Wrangler] Will you agree on an amount below 10 grams? 
  [Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger] Yes, I think so. 
  [Von Wrangler] Thus, the next political step will not be the 
complete release of hashish? Or the release of heroin, as North 
Rhine-Westphalia Justice Minister Krumsiek advocates? 
  [Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger] No, the legislature will not 
legalize soft drugs in the foreseeable future. What applies to 
soft drugs must also apply to heroin and other hard drugs. The 
ruling of the Federal Constitutional Court does not apply to the 
latter, which means that there is no suspension of punishment 
for the possession of small amounts of hard drugs. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Franz Sommerfeld report: "Against False Normality"] </F>
  [Text] In 10 days the federal convention will elect a new 
president in the Reichstag in Berlin. In an interview with 
BERLINER ZEITUNG North Rhine-Westphalian Minister-President 
Johannes Rau, Social Democratic Party [SPD], discussed the 
internal climate in united Germany. 
  Johannes Rau said that eastern Germany not only needs an 
investment offensive; equally important is the exchange of 
people. Rau recalled the tears of joy on 9 November 1990 and 
drew up a sober balance sheet: In many places to the western 
German call: "Now pay us a visit!" there has been added: "But 
not all the time." The Germans must live with the intellectual 
and material differences much longer than they expected. The 
politician spoke of the "long way" Germany has to go "until 
people again meet and understand each other without any 
problems." 
  At the same time he warned against "blurring all regional 
and 
historical peculiarities." Johannes Rau cited the example of 
the United States, where, under rather similar economic 
conditions, the different characteristics of northerners and 
southerners can still be clearly felt. 
  Rau wants to intensify the exchange of teachers, pupils, and 
athletes between eastern and western Germany. He calls on young 
people in the west to study in Leipzig, Dresden, or 
Frankfurt/Oder. In particular for western Germans it is 
important to go to Weimar and Erfurt to learn that "one might 
perhaps have a few marks less in one's pocketbook" there, but 
one would not be poorer but richer -- for instance in cultural 
terms. The candidate appeals: "We must never and will never 
resign ourselves to the wall in the minds and the isolation in 
the hearts in Germany." 
<H5>  Their Own Lives </H5>
  Johannes Rau, who since the 1950's regularly visited friends 
in the GDR, wants "much more understanding" for the people "who 
now suddenly feel that they have not lived their own lives, and 
this at an age when they no longer have any chance of a 
`western' career simply because they will not find work." 
  Johannes Rau thinks it is quite natural that, 
four-and-a-half 
years after unification, the Germans feel internal insecurity 
and are "not sufficiently sure of themselves." Rau recalls that 
other industrial states, such as Japan, France, and Britain, are 
also going through crises of orientation at the moment. He 
finds it very encouraging "that our democracy has been so stable 
over the past four-and-a-half years." 
<H5>  Do Not Forget </H5>
  Nevertheless, by pointing to the neighbors, Rau does not 
want 
to relativize German problems: "In our country xenophobia and 
racism are of worse significance than in the other countries, 
because this has happened before to us." The SPD politician is 
worried about the trend toward saying: "Let us be normal." And 
he retorts: "We, with our special German history, cannot afford 
this self-imposed normalcy. Because of our deficit in democracy 
in the Weimar Republic we brought misery to the world. This was 
unique. Denying it would be fateful. In my view, Gustav 
Heinemann's words apply: `The only chance that the others will 
forget is that we do not forget.'" 
  Rau wants to bring the debate about the past to the present: 
"I think that the discussion about the normalcy of our present 
is more important than a controversy among historians about the 
alleged normalcy of German history."

  [Excerpt] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- German Defense Minister Volker 
Ruehe (Christian Democratic Union) has described as good the 
chances of the Bonn coalition parties reaching agreement on a 
common overall policy for the Bundeswehr. After the first 
meeting of the coalition working group examining broad outlines 
for the future of the Bundeswehr, Ruehe said in Bonn on Thursday 
[19 May] that they agreed to meet again in June. He did not 
give any details. 
  The working group was set up by top coalition members after 
the differences of opinion between the Christian Democratic 
Union/Christian Social Union and the Free Democratic Party [FDP] 
came to light regarding future overall policy for the 
Bundeswehr. Given the current financial situation, Ruehe is 
aiming for a reduction of the Bundeswehr from 370,000 to 
340,000. Basic military service is to be shortened from 12 to 
10 months. Military service for the crisis reaction forces will 
be 12 months. The FDP has voiced its criticism over this.

<F P=106> ["G.P."-signed report: "Rexrodt Opposes Abandoning Nuclear </F>
Energy"] 
  [Text] Stuttgart, 17 May -- At the opening of the 1994 
Nuclear Technology Annual Conference in Stuttgart, Federal 
Economics Minister Guenther Rexrodt warned against the FRG 
abandoning nuclear energy. It completely lacks logic to abandon 
a technology in which German companies occupy a leading position 
internationally. Those who call for the abandonment of nuclear 
technology should realize that the resulting energy shortage 
will have to be made up for and that jobs for highly qualified 
people will be affected. In addition, it will be scarcely 
possible for Germany to make an effective contribution to 
improving the security of nuclear power plants in Central and 
East Europe without the necessary technology. 
  Rexrodt said that the long-term option for the use of 
nuclear 
energy should not be given up now, even if a discussion is 
currently taking place on issuing permits for new nuclear power 
plants. He called on the laender governed by the SPD to stop 
resisting the law on the use of coal and nuclear energy, which 
the Federal Council is to decide about on Friday [20 May]. The 
law will set new conditions that have to be fulfilled before a 
permit for the operation of a nuclear power plant is issued. 
The main aim is to significantly reduce the danger to the 
population in the event of reactor accidents by way of 
preventative measures, including the prevention of melt-downs. 
  The minister regretted that last year's talks on achieving a 
consensus had collapsed, at least temporarily. There should be 
a broad social consensus on the supply of energy in the future. 
Schwaben Energy AG board of directors member Staebler said that 
the consensus talks had, despite their collapse, increased 
acceptance for nuclear energy, because the discussion had 
acquired much more of a factual character. Thus, within a year, 
the number of people who wanted to abandon nuclear energy 
quickly fell from 32 to 24 percent. The number of people who 
are of the opinion that a modern industrial state needs nuclear 
power plants has risen from 29 percent at the beginning of the 
1990's to 41 percent. Incidentally, with technological and 
other improvements to reactors over the past two decades, a 
notable degree of safety has been achieved. Serious accidents 
involving the release of radiation, even if the amounts do not 
exceed a natural level, have not occurred so far. Approved 
limits were only exceeded in the case of the "incident" at the 
Lingen nuclear power plant in 1969.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with presidential candidate Roman </F>
Herzog by Peter Heinacher in Karlsruhe on 17 May: "Herzog: 
Overregulation Obstructs Economic Development"] 
  [Text] Roman Herzog, candidate of the Christian Democratic 
Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] for the federal 
presidency, has renounced "pessimism" regarding the economic 
developments in the new laender. In an interview with 
HANDELSBLATT, the president of the Karlsruhe Federal 
Constitutional Court emphasized that all current economic 
indicators were giving reason to be optimistic. 
  Herzog cited three main reasons for his optimistic 
appreciation of economic developments in eastern Germany. On 
the one hand, he pointed to the experience gained by the West 
Germans after 1945. The dismantling of industrial plants 
constituted a "terrible blow" for the West German economy at the 
time. However, the effect was that the dismantled industrial 
plants were replaced by new, much more efficient ones. "The 
same will now take place in the new laender." 
  In addition, Herzog pointed to the economy in the 
construction sector, which had picked up significantly over the 
past few months. "I am not claiming that things are developing 
in the same way as in the West after 1950. Yet, the fact is 
that the construction sector has always been the driving force 
for the economy in West Germany in the past few decades." 
  Finally, the CDU/CSU candidate pointed to the increasing 
number of new enterprises that have been established in the new 
laender. An economy is working best when "it can rely on this 
grass-roots economy of small- and medium-sized enterprises and 
industries." 
  Moreover, Herzog underlined the qualifications of the people 
in eastern Germany and their readiness to work hard. In many 
cases their knowledge went far beyond technical things. The 
knowledge of East European languages, which many people in the 
new laender possess, was still lying absolutely fallow. "If the 
markets in East Europe recover, there is a great potential for 
employment here. I think that we do not have to fear too much 
about the economic development in eastern Germany. It is 
certainly going to be a long haul but the upward trend is 
indisputable." 
  Herzog commented most favorably on the role of the trade 
unions in German society. The reaction to the economic 
development, to the widening gap between economic developments 
and the labor market can be acknowledged only with words of 
praise, Herzog said. "I cannot judge whether this year's wage 
agreements are watertight to the last detail or what the future 
of the Volkswagen working week model will be. Yet, quite 
certainly one can say that steps in the right direction have 
been taken, and I have been following them with the greatest 
respect." 
  The president of the Constitutional Court strongly 
criticized 
overregulation in the FRG. This was currently even obstructing 
a positive course for the economy. As everybody knows, the 
liberal law-governed state lives on the fact that the citizens 
voluntarily behave in the way they are expected by the law. 
Yet, if the legal system has become so intricate and 
complicated that even the most loyal citizens no longer know 
what they are expected to do, then this potential for loyalty is 
not utilized. The development of the FRG legal system has 
certainly also something to do with a certain German urge for 
perfectionism. Yet, the essential thing is that in the last few 
decades one has more and more abandoned the type of law "that 
only sets out the general direction." Lawmaking today 
increasingly often means to seek justice for individual cases 
and to produce an ever increasing number of special regulations. 
"I do not think that we can afford that in the long run. I 
would prefer a somewhat less exhaustive legal system that leaves 
a certain room for all parties involved -- including the 
administrative bodies." 
  In this connection, Herzog pointed out that the Federal 
Constitutional Court has always been very open in this respect. 
He was sometimes wondering that the legislators were making 
relatively little use of the possibilities that have become 
possible under constitutional law. 
  Regarding his chances in the election of the federal 
president, the CDU/CSU candidate said that he thought from the 
very beginning that his election was not "absolutely certain." 
Yet, at the moment he thought that his chances were bigger than 
those of the other candidates. Nevertheless, the race was still 
open. "I am preparing myself for both results." 
  The question whether in the future the president should be 
directly elected by the people depends on the powers the office 
will be entrusted with, Herzog said, adding that he discussed 
this problem before in his commentary on the Basic Law. Under 
the Basic Law, the federal president has only limited powers, 
"one can say he is absolutely weak." Herzog emphasized that 
there was the danger that a politician might be elected with far 
more than 50 percent of the vote in a general election but lack 
the necessary competence. "I find this discrepancy between 
backing from the population and real powers to be too great." 
That way "full-blooded politicians" would "burn out." 
  Herzog stressed that, according to the Basic Law, the 
federal president had to examine all laws and, if necessary, 
even withhold his signature if a law appears to be 
unconstitutional. He argued that all federal presidents refused 
to sign a document at least once. The Federal Constitutional 
Court is indeed the real keeper of the constitution, which is 
why all federal presidents have so far, quite rightly, only 
reluctantly made use of their right to withhold a signature in 
extreme cases. 
  In this connection, Herzog pointed to a "fact" that, in his 
view, had gotten not enough public attention so far. If, in a 
law of 200 paragraphs, one paragraph is dubious under 
constitutional law, then the Federal Constitutional Court is 
able to pick out this paragraph and declare it void if asked to 
do so. Yet everything else in the law would stay the way it is. 
  The federal president can only sign a law in its entirety or 
refuse to sign it. This was the real reason that the federal 
presidents were very reluctant in many cases to withhold their 
signature. Some presidents expressly emphasized in the past 
that they had reservations regarding the constitutionality of 
certain points of a law, but still wanted to put their signature 
to it to clear the way for Karlsruhe. "I regard that as a most 
reasonable practice that is basically consistent with the 
rulings of the Federal Constitutional Court." 
  The discussion about shifting responsibilities from Bonn to 
the Karlsruhe Federal Constitutional court is looked at with 
certain skepticism by Herzog. "If I understand it right then 
this happened only once, namely in connection with the 
out-of-area missions of Bundeswehr units." The Federal 
Constitutional Court itself did not regard the discussion as 
being so "dramatic." He said he did not quite understand the 
criticism of politics in this connection. There are certainly 
examples for a shift in responsibilities, but there are only a 
few. 
  Herzog noted that if he were elected he would mainly "do 
what 
in England they call warning, admonishing, and encouraging. The 
federal president will be well advised not to interfere in 
political controversies between the various camps." In 
addition, and in constant agreement with the Federal 
Government's foreign policy, particularly toward the outside, he 
has to do a great deal for "all things that make up the 
atmosphere." "I think that wherever the necessary political 
discussion is not conducted, it is also his job if not to set up 
programs at least to point to the issue," Herzog said.

  [Excerpt] Bonn, 17 May -- An open conflict has broken out 
within the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] over the 
party's course on financial and social policies. The chairman 
of the SPD's employees' association, Rudolf Dressler, 
contradicted the Deputy SPD chairman and "shadow finance 
minister" in Rudolf Scharping's election team, Oskar Lafontaine, 
who advocated a tough austerity course that might also affect 
social benefits. Such announcements are "not legitimate at 
all," Dressler stated in Bonn yesterday. Neither the section of 
the draft of the SPD government program on economic policy nor 
the part on social policy include intentions to cut social 
benefits, Dressler stressed. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["uhl"-signed report: "CDU: Savings Banks and Land Banks </F>
Should Also Be Privatized"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- The CDU [Christian Democratic Union] 
Economic Council has proposed a "new privatization offensive" to 
achieve more growth and investment and thus make Germany more 
attractive as a center for business. 
  As was stressed by Juergen Westphal, the chairman of the 
Economic Council's "Economic and Competitive Policy" Commission, 
there is also a need for savings banks and land banks to be 
privatized. These public law institutions have a market share of 
over 35 percent and their volume of business amounts to about 2 
trillion German marks [DM]. Contrary to their original aims, 
the savings and land banks have developed into universal banking 
institutions. In terms of the range of services they offer, 
they are hardly distinguishable from private banks and credit 
cooperatives. 
  Nevertheless, the privatization of the savings and land 
banks 
should involve more than just a formal legal change. The more 
important point is that at least 51 percent of the capital 
should be really sold to the private sector. According to 
Westphal, privatization does not mean that the savings banks 
have to lose their regional links. 
  According to the Economic Council, by far the greatest 
potential for privatization among all public bodies is at the 
municipality level, where there are over 100,000 publicly owned 
companies. The gains in efficiency resulting from privatization 
would amount to an estimated DM40 to DM50 billion a year for the 
municipalities. The most important areas are garbage 
collection, sewage treatment, cleaning streets and buildings, 
planning, construction, transportation, telecommunications, 
energy, and housing administration. 
  Western German laender should also step up privatization 
efforts, especially with regard to public law financial 
institutions, housing and energy companies, as well as airport 
and trade fair companies. The nominal value of their direct 
capital holdings amounts to over DM13 billion. This amount is 
twice that held at the federal level. In addition, there are all 
kinds of forms of indirect ownership. For example, through its 
43.6 percent share in the WestLB [bank], North Rhine-Westphalia 
owns 10 percent or more of nine companies quoted on the stock 
exchange. 
  Privatization must also continue at the federal level. The 
reform of the federal railroads and the postal service should 
involve more than just reorganization. Telekom, above all, is 
suited for wide ownership on the part of citizens. The 
implementation of all federal privatization projects to date, 
including Lufthansa, has reduced federal ownership by 40 percent 
or DM2.3 billion.

<F P=106> [Interview by Hans D. Barbier: "We Want a Europe of </F>
Competition; the Economic Policy Program of the League of Free 
Citizens; A Conversation With Joachim Starbatty"] 
  [Text] "We are against the Maastricht Treaty because we 
love Europe." With this formulation, Joachim Starbatty, deputy 
chairman of the League of Free Citizens, outlines the party's 
position with regard to the European Union [EU]. Starbatty 
rejects two points of the treaty with particular vehemence: the 
firm timetable toward a single European currency, and the 
emphasis on the role of industrial policy in the economic policy 
of the EU. In both, the unified currency and industrial policy, 
he sees a turning away from the principle of competition. 
  From the debates concerning the Maastricht Treaty, and from 
the positive and negative reactions of the mail he has been 
receiving since the party was founded, one might think that this 
slogan "We do not want the Europe of Maastricht" can drive him 
into the corner of nationalism and "Germany first" sentiment. He 
fights against that by pointing out his spiritual relationship 
to one of the founding fathers of the concept of the European 
Community, Alfred Mueller-Armack. 
  As a young economist, says Starbatty, Mueller-Armack's plea 
for the basic pattern of European integration, which was 
prevalent even then, convinced him: harmonization through 
competition. He said competition meant, even in politics, 
finding the best solutions, and, in the competitive process, 
homogenizing them and adapting them to one another. Thus, 
competition gives rise to homogenization, but it is not a 
prerequisite for homogenization. 
  The Treaties of Rome were pledged to uphold the spirit of 
competition. Even then, he said, Ludwig Erhard and 
Mueller-Armack had to argue with the foreign policymakers who 
would have preferred a drawing-board Europe. He said now the 
economists played an inferior role in the debate surrounding the 
further development of Europe. Because in the meantime, the 
integration pattern has been turned around completely. Now, the 
issue is not "harmonization through competition," but 
"competition through harmonization." 
  Behind that, Starbatty opines, is the misleading conception 
that all market conditions and overriding political data be made 
uniform before the competitive process could take root. Not only 
does Starbatty consider this pattern to be totally wrong from 
the economic standpoint; he also considers it risky in terms of 
the prospect of European unification. He said that the 
harmonization via the resolution--such as the homogenization of 
all social standards and working conditions, the superfluous 
homogenization of taxes--would cost a good deal of money in the 
interior of Europe in order to render the consequences of 
harmonization homogeneous, such as, for example, cost-related 
unemployment in less developed regions. On the outside, however, 
he said that Europe, which had been harmonized by the regulatory 
route, was sealing itself off so as not to jeopardize the 
harmonization successes that have, supposedly, been achieved. 
"Whoever follows the slogan competition through harmonization is 
turning Europe into an expensive fortress," says Starbatty. 
  Therefore, the Free Citizens' League was not just entering 
the lists in the marketplace in favor of suppliers, but also in 
favor of the regulations and legal systems in unifying Europe. 
In any event, he said, the tendency to render everything uniform 
had to be halted: he said the social laws and tax laws were 
examples of rules that in no way would have to be harmonized to 
guarantee the four freedoms--of goods, money, services, and the 
mobility of people. 
  Sarbatty rejects the suspicion that the Free Citizens' 
League 
is following a nationalistically colored policy by virtue of the 
example of the party's attitude toward the acceptance of the 
reform states of East Europe. He said the Free Citizens' League 
supported the acceptance of these countries. He said it was 
precisely the proponents of an orderly harmonization who kept 
raising the barriers for an expansion of the EU. In an initial 
step, he said, the borders would have to be opened for those 
products of the reformed countries in the case of which these 
countries were in a strong competitive position: textiles, 
leather, steel, agricultural products. 
  Starbatty mistrusts the slogan: "expansion through 
intensification." Against a backdrop of harmonization, that 
could quickly be construed as an alibi for a policy that places 
no particular value on new members. The more harmonization is 
scrapped, he said, and the more authority over details the 
council and the commission have, the more arguing would occur 
concerning the weight attached to voting and veto powers in the 
deciding committees. The entry negotiations of Austria and the 
Nordic countries offered a foretaste of such conflicts. In the 
final analysis, there was the policy of exclusion. A harmonized 
Europe was closing itself against the newcomers out of fear of 
their voting power. 
  In Starbatty's opinion, harmonization by decree is not only 
a 
policy that would damage the openness and integration of Europe. 
As a result of such a policy, in particular, the mid-sized and 
small enterprises would be placed at a disadvantage. He said 
they could not afford to build up an ever greater apparatus for 
observing countless values and guidelines. The motto 
"competition through harmonization" promoted concentration, in 
point of fact, he said. Logically, then, industrial policy would 
grab for the major enterprise units. In that way, in the final 
analysis, everything that stood for the unification of Europe at 
the beginning of the policy would turn against competition. 
  Starbatty knows that a "No to Maastricht" is a far cry from 
a 
program of economic policy that convinces voters who would like 
to have information concerning the configuration of individual 
policy areas that are very close to their lives. For this 
reason, he valued the notion of giving a few positive guidelines 
of economic, financial, and social policy to the "Brunner 
Party," which was named for its founder. 
  In the course of the conversation, it becomes apparent that 
this program, in large measure, corresponds to that which 
economists and consultants who are oriented toward liberal 
regulation recommend as recipes for market economic reforms. "I 
do not believe there is another party with such a thoroughly 
liberal program that is oriented toward the principles of a 
market economy," says Starbatty. From his experiences in giving 
advice in the policy of economics, however, he knows that 
programs in political practice tend toward imprecision. He 
places that much greater emphasis on giving the economic program 
of the Free Citizens League shape, orienting it uncompromisingly 
toward the principles of a market economy. "Practice brings 
compromises," he says. 
  In the policy of the labor market, Starbatty considers a de 
facto or de jure reform of the responsibility of the parties to 
the rate agreements to be of primary importance. More decisions 
have to be shifted to the operational level, he said, so that 
once again, greater differences in wages would result, and the 
firms could more shape the degree of their involvement in terms 
of labor in a more flexible way. Flexibility of working hours, 
on which agreement was reached this year in the agreements of 
the rate talks marked, at any rate, the modest beginning of the 
reform process, he said. 
  In terms of social policy, he said, the principle of its 
subsidiary nature would have to come into its own. In urgent 
cases, the community would have to understand, assurances would 
have to be provided against incalculable risks, but they would 
have to be provided in accordance with the principles of 
actuarial mathematics. The state could promulgate an obligation 
to provide insurance, but it would have to leave it to the 
individual to decide who the provider of that insurance coverage 
would be. Even the entity "security" could, and would, have to 
be provided under competitive conditions. If society did not 
want to eliminate a collectively organized safety net 
altogether, those entities that provide coverage would have to 
be organized on the principle of capital coverage, and not 
financed, as they are today, on the principle of shifting 
assets. In addition, whether as a result of self-involvement or 
contribution refunds, incentives would have to be created to use 
the services provided by the collective systems sparingly. 
  In taxation policy, Starbatty considers two reform 
principles 
to be of primary importance: easing up on the tax on capital 
investment, and the capital gains tax, in order to stimulate 
growth and employment, and lowering the wage and income tax 
rates. Starbatty not only wants to decrease the rates, however. 
At the same time, he wants to level off the wide range of 
tax-lowering exceptional situations. Without going into detail, 
Starbatty looks favorably upon those considerations of 
consolidating welfare payments, the family tax offset payments, 
and the income tax into a "negative tax" or "citizens' money." 
  The agricultural aid package is something Starbatty wants to 
revamp--from price subsidies, the cornerstone of the 
organization of the European agrarian market--to direct income 
subsidies (deficiency payments). 
  Starbatty has no opinion at all concerning industrial 
policy: 
not on a national or European level, not as a "shock absorbing" 
policy, and not as a "forward-looking" policy. Turn it however 
you will: in the last analysis, industrial policy may be defined 
in terms of the definition supplied by a mid-sized businessman: 
"Industrial policy consists of taking money from successful 
enterprises and giving it to unsuccessful ones." Starbatty 
allows a broad-based research program that is not specifically 
addressed to any one industry of product to hold sway. 
  At the end of the interview, he returned once more to the 
topic of Europe: "Whoever sees regulatory policy as a policy of 
competition cannot approve of any pattern of integration that 
leads to a Europe of regulated harmonization." 
<H5>  [Box, p 17] </H5>
  The Free Citizens League is one of 23 parties admitted to 
participate in the 12 June European election. Its chairman is 
Manfred Brunner, who left the employ of the commission as "an 
opponent of Maastricht." He has also become well-known as a 
result of his constitutional complaint against the Maastricht 
Treaty, and because of his sympathizing contacts with the 
Austrian right-wing populist Joerg Haider. The decisiveness of 
the repudiation of a centralistic Europe and the uncompromising 
support for the principles of the market economy have become, as 
with no other party involved in the European election, the 
trademark of the Free Citizens League. Because of this special 
feature, we present the economic program in an interview with 
Joachim Starbatty. As deputy chairman, Starbatty is the economic 
policy head of the party. He is a professor of economics in 
Tuebingen. He was a pupil of Alfred Mueller-Armack, and, in his 
younger days, he worked as an expert in economic and currency 
policy matters in the [Christian Democratic Union/Christian 
Social Union, CDU/CSU] caucus in the Bundestag. He was a member 
of the CDU, but then he left the party. He has been a member of 
the Free Citizens League since its founding in January 1994.

<F P=106> [Article by Barbara Gillman: "The HWWA Head Fears Budget </F>
Cuts by the Hanseatic City's Senate"] 
  [Text] The president of the HWWA Institute for Economic 
Research in Hamburg, Erhard Kantzenbach, fears that in the 
future he will have to manage with perceptibly fewer funds, for 
the science senator of the city state has set up a drastic 
austerity budget. If the land cuts its share of HWWA's basic 
funding, the Federal Government may follow suit. 
  Kantzenbach's worries are well-founded. In Hamburg's Office 
for Science and Research, which has jurisdiction over HWWA, it 
is said that the Institute "is included in the austerity 
considerations." Nothing is final yet, and Kantzenbach hopes for 
something definite from the HWWA advisory board meeting in June. 
Its chairman, Hamburg's science senator, goes in for large-scale 
savings: The university's personnel costs alone are to drop by 7 
or 8 million German marks [DM], which amounts to 10 or 15 
percent per sector. 
  If the land cuts the subsidy to HWWA, the Federal Government 
will probably also lower its contribution so that the 50:50 
financing is preserved. It could even get worse. It is being 
pointed out by the Federal Economics Ministry (BMWi) that even 
today, one-fourth of HWWA researchers do not work in science, 
but rather for the information center. If the importance of 
research in the plan is receding, one "must examine" whether the 
general agreement between the Federal Government and laender on 
joint research funding, according to Article 91b of the Basic 
Law, still applies to HWWA. Spelled out: Bonn might withdraw 
completely and leave the fate of the renowned HWWA to the 
Hanseatic city. 
<H5>  The Hamburg Institute Holds Second Place in Basic Funding </H5>
  This year, the institute receives DM9.96 million each from 
the Federal Government and the land. Only the IfW in Kiel 
receives more; all other large economic research institutes must 
make do with fewer funds. 
  Kantzenbach, who has been heading the HWWA since 1989, is 
known to any economics student who has even scratched the 
surface on the theory of competition. In his dissertation the 
Hannoverian, born 1931, proclaimed the thesis that competition 
is fiercest among a given group of competitors who manufacture 
similar products and have an overview of the market. Economists 
call that: "broad oligopoly with limited product homogeneity and 
market transparency." 
  In 1967, Kantzenbach became a professor at the University of 
Frankfurt. There the SPD [Social Democratic Party] 
member--elected as representative of the liberal wing of 
professors and teaching assistants--held the office of president 
from 1971 to 1975. Subsequently he moved to the University of 
Hamburg. Following tradition, he remained a professor there even 
after assuming office at the HWWA. 
  As a member of the Commission on Monopoly (1974 to 1986) and 
its chairman (as of 1979), Kantzenbach criticized the megafusion 
of Daimler and AEG, as well as the merger of Daimler and MBB. 
  For over a year now, the HWWA has had a scientific advisory 
board composed of five professors, thus fulfilling an old demand 
by the Scientific Council. Presidents of other institutes long 
opposed the additional tutelage; now all six economic research 
institutes have an advisory council. Kantzenbach makes the best 
of it: The advisory board meetings "are interesting for me 
personally," and the research departments are forced "to think 
about themselves." 
  One of the first pieces of advice by the external scientists 
was to establish a new research group for "regulation, 
industrial economics, and competition." It was occasioned by the 
reports on the situation of competition in the new laender 
prepared for the economics ministry. Competition specialist 
Kantzenbach summarizes tersely the essence of the observations: 
With the exception of local markets, such as for newspapers and 
sugar, competition in Germany "in no way was intensified" by 
unification. 
  In early May, the institute will devote a conference to 
Germany as a business location, because this "political slogan" 
now stands for a number of economic problems, says Kantzenbach. 
In addition to short-term foreign exchange rate problems, it 
concerns investment incentives, profitability, research and 
development, and employment. The moderate wage agreements, 
"economically tenable," must be differentiated more according to 
quality, sectors and regions. But tax policy must then balance 
social hardships. 
  Political "crash programs" cannot achieve the link-up with 
high technology. Instead of conducting "industrial policy par 
excellence" as in the case of Transrapid, the state should put 
more funds into the basic research of institutes and 
universities. The "miserable" training conditions of students 
also need urgent improvement. 
  The HWWA research departments, "Economy, Money, and Public 
Finances" as well as "Economic Structure and Economic Order," 
are nationally oriented. Four of a total of six departments deal 
with international issues: "World Economy," "Economic and 
Financial Relations Between Industrial Countries," "Development 
Policy and Integration of Developing Countries," as well as 
"Economic Systems and Relations of East European Countries." 
  Banks above all work with the HWWA index for raw material 
prices. On a daily basis, researchers update the index to the 
latest stock market quotations and use it to compute prior work 
[costs] and the terms of trade. 
  The Hamburg institute reports regularly to the BMWi on the 
economic situation in the Baltic states as well as St. 
Petersburg and Koenigsberg [Kaliningrad]. Information on these 
regions encountered lively interest, especially in enterprises. 
  The HWWA earns annually DM325,000 by this commission--a 
small 
contribution to the total budget which amounted to DM20.3 
million in 1993. Personnel costs alone were DM16.2 million. In 
addition to the basic funding, the HWWA had additional revenues 
of DM2.1 million through commissioned work. Three-fourths of the 
reports were ordered by public authorities, among them the BMWi 
alone for DM1.47 million. 
  If one measures the outside funds ratio against the overall 
budget, it amounts to only 10.3 percent. But according to 
Kantzenbach's figures, the research budget plus proportionate 
costs for administration amounts to only DM9.5 million. Computed 
on this basis, the share earned by 53 scientists through expert 
opinions increases to 22 percent. 
<H5>  Of 221 Staff Members 130 Work for the Info Center </H5>
  The remainder of the budget funds, about DM9 million, goes 
to 
the HWWA Information Center which employs 130 of a total of 221 
HWWA staff members. The library houses over a million volumes. 
Last year 72,300 people utilized this scientific resource. In 
addition, there is the press documentation which stores 17.3 
million articles. One of the Info center's tasks is also 
advising enterprises. For that, fees of about DM400,000 were 
collected in 1993. 
  The collection of press clippings and books was the 
institute's original task when it was founded in 1908 as the 
central department of the Colonial Institute in Hamburg. In the 
Weimar Republic, it was given the name of "Hamburg's World 
Economy Archive" (HWWA). After 1945 it also turned to more 
practical research; as of 1970 this was expressed in the new 
name, "HWWA Institute for Economic Research-Hamburg." 
  The institute publishes research results regularly in the 
periodicals WIRTSCHAFTSDIENST (monthly), INTERECONOMICS 
(bimonthly), and FINANZIERUNG UND ENTWICKLUNG (quarterly). 
KONJUNKTUR VON MORGEN appears every two weeks. 
  To provide the institute with more flexibility, the Hamburg 
senate and the BMWi in 1991 wanted to turn the HWWA agency into 
a [registered] association. All other economic research 
institutes are organized under this private legal form, with the 
exception of the university institute, IfW. The staff violently 
opposed the plans. They feared deterioration of their working 
conditions; furthermore, the institute even as "e.V." 
[registered association] would not be granted additional rights. 
The protest was successful, and the HWWA remained an agency.

<F P=106> [Article by Ulrich Deupmann: "Mondays It's a Matter of </F>
Power; Scharping's Kitchen Cabinet: Six Strategists Bet on 
Victory"] 
  [Text] The "Monday circle," which is shrouded in secrecy, 
met for seven and a half hours, from four in the afternoon until 
half past eleven at night. Rudolf Scharping, head of the Social 
Democratic Party [SPD], met with a group of his closest advisors 
at party headquarters in a brainstorming session concerning 
election campaign strategy. Election slogans were presented to 
the circle, then rejected once more. Then it was a matter of 
selecting some pictures for election posters. The slide 
projector showed pictures of the chairman on the wall: Scharping 
on vacation in Mallorca, in a denim shirt, or in a highly 
serious pose. Suddenly it was nearly as cozy as if it were in 
someone's living room. There were some jokes about some of the 
snapshots, and Scharping, like any "pater familias," got just a 
bit touchy. 
  "Monday circle": under this by-word, since January, at the 
outset of nearly every week a sort of SPD party chairman's 
kitchen cabinet, for which the party by-laws make no provision, 
has been meeting to chart the party's "operative course." Among 
this circle of the elect, in addition to Guenter Verheugen, the 
national managing director, are the head of the state chancery 
in Rhineland-Palatinate, Karl-Heinz Klaer; Wolfgang Clement, 
Klaer's counterpart from North Rhine-Westphalia; Reinhard 
Klimmt, head of the SPD caucus in Saarbruecken's Landtag: and 
Peter Struck, parliamentary managing director of the SPD 
Bundestag caucus. All these men are in their mid-forties to 
early fifties, that is to say, as old as the party chairman. All 
have strategic minds'; all are professionals in the day-to-day 
business of politics; all are anything but pantywaists. Being 
possessed of a strategic mind: that means knowing one's way 
through Bonn's political jungle, finding it fun to sniff out the 
opponent's traps early in the game, and laying a few traps of 
one's own, but it also means finding the hazardous focal points 
in one's own camp and disarming them. 
  The exceptional meeting on Sunday [24 April] definitely 
served as an external expression of the fact that "the training 
period is now over and the first half-time is starting," as 
Scharping said last week in the SPD Bundestag caucus. In the hot 
phase of the campaign, what is at stake for the SPD is rescuing 
over time the opinion poll results, which have been less and 
less favorable, by election day, which is set for 16 October. It 
nearly appears as if the electorate, for the fourth time in a 
row, believed that the SPD overdid it in the training and came 
up short in the game. The pitiful experience of the defeat, and 
the knowledge that Kohl can pour it on for a final spurt at the 
end, are matters of which most participants of the Monday circle 
are only all too keenly aware. In 1986-87, Wolfgang Clement had 
a key contributory role in managing the fruitless Bundestag 
campaign for the SPD's candidate for the chancellorship, 
Johannes Rau. In 1990, Reinhard Klimmt and Karl-Heinz Klaer 
attempted to advise the candidate for chancellor, Oskar 
Lafontaine, in the election campaign. By no means the last 
lesson shared by the group as a result of its experiences is 
Rudolf Scharping's firm article of faith: the opposition has 
never yet been elected to the government because of its better 
program; quite the contrary: the people have elected their 
chancellor out of pity for him or his policies. A participant in 
the Monday circle expresses the SPD strategy that follows from 
this in very simple terms: "Disarm the government, take the toys 
right out of its hands, then crack the nut." 
  The "strong men" before whom Kohl and Schaeubele are 
expected 
to quake in fear, are unknown quantities in terms of national 
politics. Karl-Heinz Klaer, for example, as head of the state 
chancery in Mainz, the right hand man of the minister-president 
of Rhineland-Palatinate: after the 1990 defeat in the Bundestag 
election, Klaer offered Scharping, who was the leader of the 
opposition at the time, to organize the Landtag election with 
him, and go with him to Mainz. Up to that point, Klaer had been 
responsible within party headquarters, in his capacity as 
division chief, for strategic planning and "observing the 
enemy"; prior to that, he had served party boss Willy Brandt as 
office manager. Scharping knows that in the last analysis, he 
owes his victory in the election to the party chairmanship to 
this intimate party acquaintanceship. After that, Klaer 
consciously remained in Mainz. With their "close ties" to one 
another, they want to disarm the charge that Scharping, because 
of obligations in Bonn, was neglecting his job as 
minister-president. Should Scharping become the chancellor in 
October, it is almost a certainty that he will entrust 
Karl-Heinz Klaer with the post of head of the office of the 
chancellor. 
  Peter Struck, the managing director of the SPD Bundestag 
caucus, who is skilled with the media, may justifiably hope that 
in that case, he would occupy the influential boss' chair in the 
caucus. With his outgoing ways--Struck uses the familiar form of 
address with nearly everyone in Bonn, from Theo Waigel, head of 
the Christian Social Union [CSU] to the Greens' Joschka 
Fischer--he has managed to pull off many a political trick that 
would have eluded a person with a gloomier disposition. He 
always garners the evil eye from members of his own party 
whenever he leans against the government's bench, engrossed in 
some confidential joke or other with Chancellor Helmut Kohl. In 
addition, the rough-and-ready way in which, from time to time, 
Struck calls the SPD deputies to order has won him a few 
enemies, as well as friends. 
<H5>  Political Craftsmen </H5>
  Wolfgang Clement and Reinhard Klimmt create the axis to 
Scharping's chief allies in the SPD in Scharping's Monday 
circle. Clement is considered to be Johannes Rau's alter ego, 
Klimmt, as "permanent number two man" behind his friend from 
student days, the head of the Saarland government, Oskar 
Lafontaine. Both have been selected by their ministers-president 
as crown princes. 
  This circle--together with Verheugen--is unified by the view 
of political practice. For them, ultimately, political questions 
are questions of power, or, as one participant put it: "Of what 
good is the most beautiful ecological platform to us if we do 
not have the power to implement it?" Their understanding of 
themselves rather resembles that of craftsmen, political actors 
who, in the second tier, keep the machinery running. Visions are 
not their field of expertise. 
  And certainly, it is no accident that the SPD boss has 
surrounded himself with precisely these friends. Scharping and 
his cronies have had enough of "opposition politics without 
consequences." That is the explanation for current tensions 
between this second tier of the party leadership and that wing 
of the Social Democrats who think in terms of platforms. For 
Scharping, taking over the power is of primary importance, not 
pure convictions. 
  The tensions were discharged in thunder and lightning over 
the weekend when it became known that Christoph Zoepel had 
vented his spleen in DER SPIEGEL. Zoepel, who is responsible for 
transportation and housing in Scharping's government platform 
committee, used his well-known sharp tongue to analyze the 
situation: "Since the original election, there have been nothing 
but personalities. They have opinions that can no longer be 
altered by the opinions of the party. The SPD is now a party of 
the presidium." For a long time, Zoepel had fought for the 
inclusion of a speed limit in the platform, also for confessing 
that any federal government, regardless which one, would have to 
increase the petroleum tax. Scharping blue penciled these 
provisions from the draft on him, and at some point, Zoepel 
decide to save his breath to cool his porridge. 
  Perhaps he would have done better not to have done so, 
because Scharping's reactions to public slogans of the 
"presidial party" type are definitely touchy. At the SPD 
presidium on Monday [25 April], there was such a row between the 
two that those who were sitting in the vicinity prefer to 
maintain a guarded silence on the subject, even after the fact. 
Scharping took an imperious tone toward Zoepel, saying if he had 
something against the platform, he should say so beforehand, in 
private. Zoepel interjected it was a matter of his reputation. 
Finally, the SPD boss threatened to throw Zoepel out of the 
government committee. Ultimately, they struck a compromise, 
demanding a speed limit according to the resolutions of the 
European Parliament. That body has decided to impose pretty much 
everything from 120 to 150 kilometers per hour. And so, in the 
future, anyone can pick from the platform whatever speed limit 
he likes, more or less. Oskar Lafontaine and Gerhard Schroeder, 
incidentally, at least so it is rumored, were amused by the 
quarrel. A "presidial party" would not be so bad at all, 
Schroeder is claimed to have said. 
  Scharping cut a deal by which he was permitted to state his 
views in a preface to the governing platform all by himself. It 
is said that the content will not contain any surprises, Guenter 
Verheugen hastens to explain. The party boss wants to bring 
those matters that concern him the most to the foreground, 
namely fighting unemployment and the desire for a fresh start 
for the country. The fact that the speed limit played an overly 
important role in the process is something no one has to 
believe. That is "the least important matter we have discussed 
in two years," one high-ranking member of the party leadership 
says and he adds: "Whoever believes we can win an election on 
that point also believes in Santa Claus."

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Francois Leotard by Patrick </F>
Poivre d'Arvour, in Paris on 18 May -- live or recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Poivre d'Arvor] Among the main 
proposals of Bernard-Henri Levy and his friends, there is the 
lifting of the arms embargo in favor of the Bosnian fighters who 
have been asking for it from the start. 
  [Leotard] This can be done, but the French troops would 
leave 
a quarter of an hour after that. We should know that supplying 
weapons would obviously mean extending the conflict. We cannot 
put in soldiers to act as a buffer force between the 
belligerents, and at the same time supply one of these 
belligerents with arms. It is clear that if weapons are 
supplied, in the quarter of an hour that follows, I would make 
the decision -- with the agreement of the prime minister and the 
president, of course -- to pull the French troops out. [passage

  [Text] The diplomatic stalemate is such in the Bosnia 
conflict that France is having doubts about its considerable 
contribution to operations aiming at keeping a peace which is so 
uncertain. Should we talk of a withdrawal of French UN troops 
or a redeployment? A nuance emerged between Defense Minister 
Francois Leotard and Foreign Minister Alain Juppe. The nuance 
has now disappeared, but what seems to be certain is the fact 
that there will be fewer French UN peacekeepers in Bosnia. 
Philippe Harrouard reports: 
  [Harrouard] Things are now clear: France will concentrate 
its UN troops round Sarajevo. At the same time, it will bring 
home 1,000 men posted in Glina, in Krajina. This number 
corresponds to that of the extra troops sent provisionally last 
March at UN request. This means that we are back to the 
original figure. 
  As for the battalion in Bihac -- that is, 1,500 men -- it 
will be withdrawn only if the peace plan which the belligerents 
have been invited to negotiate does not succeed. Therefore, 
there is no disagreement -- or there is no disagreement any 
more, as we originally believed was the case: 
  [Begin Leotard recording] It is very natural for diplomats 
to 
use diplomatic jargon and for the defense minister to use a 
language which is more military; it is totally normal. There is 
no basic difference, no basic disagreement, I repeat, there is 
none. 
  All these decisions were taken by the prime minister, with 
the consent of the president, and they were submitted to the 
United Nations as what France intended to do, which is the 
normal procedure. We told the United Nations about the 
battalion in Glina, and we are telling them about the battalion 
in Bihac. [end recording] 
  [Harrouard] Right now, there are 6,858 French soldiers in 
the 
former Yugoslavia, including 5,000 in Bosnia. Eighteen French 
UN soldiers have lost their lives.

  [Excerpts] Paris, May 18 (AFP) -- Eleven French aid workers 
detained for over a month by Bosnian Serbs for alleged arms 
trafficking were freed and flown out of Sarajevo Wednesday after 
payment of $44,000. [passage omitted] 
  The organisation's field coordinator, Jacques Ladyson, told 
AFP that "until a visit by French ambassador Henry Jacolin, the 
conditions of our comrades were very difficult. 
  "They were poorly fed, moved here and there, and were given 
mock executions." 
  "One evening, they were made to walk around in their 
underpants, with their eyes blindfold, for no apparent reason." 
  The 11 -- 10 men and one woman -- had been held by Bosnian 
Serbs since April 8, the day after being stopped at the last 
Serb checkpoint before entering Sarajevo and forced to travel to 
the Serb-held suburb of Ilidza for a full search. 
  The Serbs refused to allow the team to remain overnight in 
their vehicles. 
  The next morning, when they returned to their convoy, they 
found Bosnian Serbs filming ammunition crates, removed from the 
trucks. The aid workers were immediately detained and accused of 
gun-running to the Moslems, which the 11 strenuously denied. 
  Their Serb captors initially offered to exchange the group 
for 11 Serb prisoners held by the Bosnian army, but Premiere 
Urgence refused. 
  On May 7, the Serbs said that a trial of the aid workers had 
been put off until early June. A day later they extended their 
month-long detention for another month. [passage omitted] 
  The 11 were due at Paris's Villacoublay military airport 
around 11:00 p.m. where they were to be met by Defense Minister 
Francois Leotard and Foreign Minister Alain Juppe. 
  French President Francois Mitterrand expressed "joy" at the 
release and praised the courage of all aid workers in Bosnia- 
Herzegovina. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The German foreign minister has put forward a figure 
of 500,000 for the number of dead in Rwanda -- 500,000 deaths is 
seven percent of the population of the country. 
  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe repeated in the National 
Assembly today that it is a real case of genocide. In order to 
put an end to it, he suggests that a regional summit be 
organized: 
  [Begin Juppe recording] Faced with the offensive by the 
Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF], the Rwandan Government troops 
have been carrying out a systematic elimination of the Tutsi 
population, which then, of course, resulted in the massacres 
becoming generalized. 
  France has denounced this situation very vigorously. We 
support the efforts of the states of the region -- Tanzania, 
Zaire, and Uganda -- to achieve a cease-fire, and we advocate a 
summit of the heads of state of the region so that they can 
bring all possible pressure to bear on the warring sides -- the 
RPF on the one side and the Rwandan forces on the other -- to 
halt the hostilities and to resume the Arusha process, which, 
allow me to point out, was established in 1993 thanks to the 
efforts of France. This made it possible for the cessation of 
hostilities at the time, before the attack which was launched on 
the plane carrying the Rwandan and Burundi presidents. [end 
recording] 
  Alain Juppe also announced that the French health minister 
would be going to Burundi and Tanzania tomorrow or the day after 
tomorrow with the teams of French doctors given the task of 
going to the aid of the refugees. 
  On the political front, thus, France is proposing a summit 
of 
the heads of state of the region, in other words, the presidents 
of Tanzania, Uganda, and Zaire. We look at the reasons behind 
this initiative with you, Monique Mas: 
  [Mas] Tanzania, first of all, because it was in Arusha that 
the peace agreement between the RPF and the Rwandan Government 
was signed last August. President Mwinyi had brought all his 
weight to bear to this end. Then Uganda, where the original 
core of the RPF was formed. Furthermore, its military 
commander, Paul Kagame, won his spurs in President Museveni's 
underground movement. Finally, Zaire, which remains a faithful 
ally of the Rwandan Government, which is having plenty of 
problems on an international diplomatic front at the moment. 
Paris considers it useful to get President Mobutu involved 
again at the same time as Ugandan President Museveni, whom 
France accuses of supporting the RPF. France itself has 
supported the Habyarimana regime financially and militarily. 
  What Paris expects from this summit is a cease-fire in 
Rwanda 
between the government and the RPF. However, on the military 
front, the RPF has the wind in its sails, and, furthermore, it 
does not recognize the government as an interlocutor. On the 
other hand, for the government, negotiations would be the 
occasion for it to put itself forward as an obligatory political 
partner.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Mitterrand: `The Alternative is </F>
War'"] 
  [Text] French politicians did not appreciate being called 
to order by an intellectual. With the exception of Ecology 
Generation President Brice Lalonde, who gave Bernard-Henry Levy 
the title of "France's conscience for Bosnia," the political 
class has been very harsh. On Monday, 16 May, the president of 
the Republic himself reacted vigorously to the comments made by 
Mr. Levy the day before, questioning France's attitude in 
relation to Bosnia. Without mentioning the philosopher by name, 
Francois Mitterrand spoke of the "sincere voices that are being 
heard," but which "are sometimes misled by passion." He 
continued: "I note that those who accuse the executive powers 
are careful not to mention the alternative to international 
negotiation, for what is this alternative if it is not war?" 
  Defending his position before the representatives of the 
European administrative courts, the head of state said: "My and 
the government's responsibility is to ensure that progress is 
made in negotiations in the spirit of justice so that the state 
of law we aspire to is created. If people speak of doing 
anything else, that would mean war. If France was ready to go 
to war, I know no other state that would join us." In a comment 
directed at the person "who addresses the French public to rouse 
indignation," Mr. Mitterrand added: "I agree, I feel the same 
way." However, he stressed: "before accusing people of 
inhumanity or indifference, we should refer this choice to the 
French people." 
<H5>  `Media Diplomacy' </H5>
  On Monday morning, Jean Glavany, the spokesman for the 
Socialist Party [PS], was the first to voice his annoyance at 
the philosopher's "lessons." According to Mr. Glavany, 
Bernard-Henri Levy's announcement of a possible "Sarajevo" 
election list "is not a threat" and "does not scare the PS." He 
added that Mr. Levy "has the right" to say what he thinks, "but 
on condition that we cannot merely accept his ideology." 
Stressing that "no one can teach the Socialists lessons," Mr. 
Glavany pointed out: "When [PS First Secretary] Michel Rocard 
went to Sarajevo, no one took any photographs. He went to see 
without being seen." Mentioning Bernard Kouchner [former 
Socialist humanitarian minister] (number three on the PS list), 
who is currently in Rwanda, the spokesman observed: "He is 
getting fired on in the true sense of the word while others 
merely figuratively shoot on sight at everyone else. That is the 
difference." 
  Jean-Pierre Chevenement [former Socialist defense minister] 
did not have any kinder words for the Bernard-Henri Levy's 
comments. In a press release, the Belfort deputy said: "The 
priority today is to end the massacre and stop using human 
suffering for political ends." The leader of the Communist list, 
Francis Wurtz, considered for his part that Mr. Levy "is doing 
the Bosnians a disservice," by letting them "foster the illusion 
of a military solution." 
  Movement of the Radical Left [MRG] President Jean-Francois 
Hory said that establishing a Sarajevo list ran the risk of 
"wasting political energy." Warning against the rise of 
"corporatist groups that want to address public opinion 
directly," Mr. Hory considered this "divisive approach to be 
scarcely in line with the workings of representational 
democracies." 
  Fierce criticism also came from the Right. The UDF-RPR 
[French Democratic Union-Rally for the Republic] majority left 
it to the "intellectual" on its list, Helene Carrere d'Encausse, 
to reply to Mr. Levy. Taking the opportunity to speak at the 
public meeting that launched the UDF-RPR campaign in Toulouse on 
Monday evening, Mrs. Carrere d'Encausse said that while "Europe 
had not been prepared" for the Yugoslav conflict, "no one has 
the right to be indignant." She wondered: "Apart from 
negotiation, what else is being proposed apart from outright 
war?" and warned against "comments whose real effects we do not 
know." 
  Richard Cazenave (RPR deputy for Isere), who had spoken for 
the neo-Gaullist group in the parliamentary debate on Bosnia on 
12 April, did not attach any worth to a Sarajevo list, either. 
In his opinion, this approach was "completely oversimplified." 
  Condemning the philosopher's "media diplomacy," Philippe de 
Villiers accused Mr. Levy of "recommending dangerous 
initiatives" and of running the risk of "preventing peace."

<F P=106> [Report by Judith Waintraub: "Rocard the Victim of Unfair </F>
Competition"] 
  [Text] Although Philippe de Villiers' candidacy the 
European election may prevent the Right from being cut off from 
its anti-European electorate, the multiplication of lists on the 
Left follows a rationale of pure competition. The division of 
roles is being carried out at the expense of the Socialists, who 
are not managing to find their role in the campaign. 
  Thanks to the slogan dreamed up by Jacques Seguela -- 
"Europe, yes, but with solidarity" -- the Socialist Party [PSF] 
hoped to reconcile what is irreconcilable: loyalty to the 
historical ideal of the Left and rejection of the reality of a 
Community which this same Left has largely helped to construct. 
The Socialists' aim was to win forgiveness for Maastricht 
without repudiating their convictions, arouse enthusiasm while 
integrating the Euro-skepticism of a large section of their 
electorate, and to promise to repaint the liberal Europe of 
business in Socialist colors. This is a difficult task which 
the multiplication of lists has gradually turned into an 
impossibility for Michel Rocard. 
  And yet, the PSF first secretary tried to protect himself 
against dangers of which he was fully aware. He took on the 
role of prophet of doom, in keeping with his natural vocation. 
His is a role of realism and critical statements. Bernard 
Kouchner [former Socialist minister] has the role of dreamer. 
The most famous of the "French doctors" was to give the 
Socialist list a historical dimension. The intellectuals' plot 
hatched by Bernard- Henri Levy is likely to deprive the PSF of 
this breath of fresh air. The indignation expressed yesterday by 
Jean Glavany, its spokesman, bears witness to the painful shock 
felt by the Socialists who thought they were protected from such 
an outrage. 
  Of course, the humanitarian card is not out of date. 
Bernard- Henri Levy, even with the backing of Andre Glucksmann 
and Edgar Morin [French philosophers], is still less credible 
than the former minister [Kouchner]. If only he were there to 
provide his own defense. At Rue de Solferino [PSF 
headquarters], they hope that Bernard Kouchner will return from 
Rwanda quickly enough to meet urgent electoral needs and deter 
his intellectual friends from carrying out their evil plan. 
  This position must be held. This is all the more vital for 
the Socialists, because they face competition on all other 
fronts. Michel Rocard's efforts to rally the Left's 
anti-Europeans have not enabled him to drown the deafening 
statements of his rivals. The prime minister, who tried to 
inaugurate his reign behind the scenes, wanted to launch the 
European election campaign in the poorest districts. 
  Unfortunately, the working class voters only have eyes for 
Bernard Tapie! He does not bother with speeches on Europe. He 
talks to "the people," as Rocard likes to say, about what 
interests them, and the first secretary cannot even fight him 
face-to-face. Francois Mitterrand would be offended and Jack 
Lang [former Socialist minister] would certainly make that known. 
  Michel Rocard cannot even give in to systematic opposition. 
The "other policy" is represented by Jean-Pierre Chevenement 
[former Socialist minister] or the Communist Party: left-wing 
voters are spoiled for choice. And, above all, the tone of 
protest does not suit the advocate of "telling the truth," be it 
on Europe or anything else. You cannot change who you are.

<F P=106> [Report by Sandrine Briclot: "Strange Visit by Libyan </F>
Minister; Victims of Bomb Attack Against UTA DC-10 Protest"] 
  [Excerpt] A (private) visit by Libya's foreign minister to 
Paris this weekend raises pressing questions and indignation on 
the part of families of victims of the bomb attack against the 
UTA DC-10 in September 1989. They criticized Charles Pasqua. 
  What in the world was Libya's foreign minister doing in 
Paris? The mystery remains 48 hours after he left France. 
Although the Libyan Embassy in France and the French Foreign 
Ministry vigorously state that 'Umar al-Muntasir's visit was 
definitely a "private" one, his short stay in Paris is still 
raising controversy. Yesterday, Interior Minister Charles 
Pasqua's comment that he had not been "informed" about this 
visit only added to a general feeling of skepticism. It is 
indeed nothing short of incredible that the interior minister 
would not be aware of the presence in Paris of a member of 
Colonel al-Qadhdhafi's government. Especially in view of the 
fact that Mr. al-Muntasir's visit had been scheduled at least 10 
days earlier, according to both the Libyan Embassy and the 
Foreign Ministry. A transit visa was issued to him by the 
French Embassy in Tripoli before he left for South Africa, where 
he attended Nelson Mandela's swearing in ceremonies. 
  Versions differ as to 'Umar al-Muntasir's time of arrival in 
Paris: either very early on Sunday morning [15 May], via a 
South African Airlines flight from Johannesburg, or the day 
before. And he left the following afternoon for Tripoli via 
Tunis. His 30-hour stay, or more likely the whole weekend, in 
the French capital raises some major questions: What did he do, 
who did he see, what did he talk about? 
  It is known that 'Umar al-Muntasir stayed at Hotel Crillon, 
which often accommodates foreign ministers on an official visit 
to France. First question: Who took care of the logistics of 
the Libyan minister's visit? According to "reliable sources" of 
AFP, that would be Adnan al-Khashoggi, the prominent Saudi 
Arabian businessman, who reportedly acted as a middleman to 
ensure the informal visit took place smoothly. However, the 
Libyan Embassy firmly denied al-Khashoggi's involvement 
yesterday, stating that it alone had made arrangements for the 
minister's stay. At any rate, the embassy could hardly 
acknowledge any participation from the Saudi Arabian, as it 
would imply that, through its foreign minister, Libya may have 
been trying to negotiate some arrangement with the Americans or 
with the Mossad (Israeli intelligence service). 
  More prosaically, the lawyers representing the victims of 
the 
bomb attack against the UTA DC-10, Messrs Levy and Szpiner, are 
convinced that there is a connection between Mr. al-Muntasir's 
visit in Paris and the case they have been working on. The 
airliner exploded in 1989 while flying over Niger, killing 170 
people. The bomb was presumably planted by Libyan terrorists. 
  "Judge Jean-Louis Bruguiere has almost completed his 
investigation," Jean-Paul Levy insisted; "This is why they (the 
Libyans) are getting restless!" The lawyers, who were informed 
about the Libyan minister's visit on Monday night, cannot see 
another explanation for the successive visits to 'Umar 
al-Muntasir's room in the Crillon Hotel by Adnan al-Khashoggi, 
by one of the French lawyers defending the Libyans in the DC-10 
affair, and by British and American businessmen." "The 
pro-Libyan lobby has a lot of clout," says Mr. Levy. "We are 
faced with states and international companies that are eager to 
do business with Libya. 
  It is true indeed that 'Umar al-Muntasir had "no formal 
contact" with French political figures. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Charles Pasqua: `The Crime Spiral </F>
Has Been Broken'"] 
  [Text] "France has stopped the increase in the crime rate, 
which has been rising almost continually over previous years," 
Interior Minister Charles Pasqua told members of the National 
Assembly yesterday as part of the government address on 
security. The following are the main points of his speech. 
<H5>  Statistics </H5>
  According to Mr. Pasqua, from April 1993 to March 1994, the 
overall increase in crimes and misdemeanors in metropolitan 
France "was a mere 0.47 percent." Mentioning as an example car 
thefts and crimes on public highways, he explained that the 
former "fell by 3.1 percent" while the latter "increased by a 
modest 1.1 percent." Furthermore, and "this is the first time in 
20 years that violent thefts decreased by .12 percent," he 
indicated. Mr. Pasqua said these figures were "encouraging if 
one looks at the general 34-percent increase in crime in the 
years 1989-1992, a figure that reaches 54 percent for crime on 
public highways and even 67 percent for armed robberies." In 
his view, this means that "the spiral is conclusively broken." 
<H5>  Drugs </H5>
  Drug trafficking "decreased by 4 percent" over the last 12 
months. To demonstrate "intensive police activity," Charles 
Pasqua indicated that 6,070 dealers, 55 percent of whom were 
foreigners, and 6,289 users-dealers had been arrested and 
subjected to legal proceedings. Last, "for the first time in 
France in 10 years, there was a decline in deaths by overdose: 
454 compared with 499."

<F P=106> [Article by Francois de Guillebon: "French-Chinese Trade: </F>
The Balladur Effect"] 
  [Text] Is [Prime Minister] Edouard Balladur's trip to China 
beginning to yield results? This is now a question worth asking 
after Friday's [13 May] visit of Beijing Mayor Li Quiyan in 
Paris, which resulted in various companies announcing 
partnership agreements. Manufacturers had been calling 
insistently for improved bilateral relations, whose past 
acrimony had slowed the progression of trade agreements and 
investment in China. 
  The positive impact of Edouard Balladur's trip to China in 
early April had been rather overshadowed by internal policy 
disputes triggered by the various arrests of dissidents in 
Beijing. People soon seemed to ignore the trip's actual goal: 
To put an end to the crisis following the sale of aircraft to 
Taiwan and to restore relations between Paris and Beijing. 
However, in a few weeks' time, French companies have managed to 
successfully expand their activities in China. 
  GEC Alsthom, which was defeated in the competition for the 
Canton subway, announced yesterday that it had signed a letter 
of intent for the creation of a joint venture near Beijing which 
will manufacture steam turbines and alternators for nuclear 
plants. As for Lafarge-Coppee, it is tackling the Chinese 
cement market (350 million tonnes per year and a 10-percent 
growth rate). It signed an agreement with the Beijing city 
authorities involving the establishment of a joint venture. 
Later this year, Carnaud-Metalbox will begin with the 
construction of a plant for beverage cans capable of producing 
500 million cans per year to meet the demand of local and 
international brewers. 
  "Diplomatic relations between France and China have improved 
greatly following the visit of the prime minister," the company 
says. "This undoubtedly helped us win this contract, which is 
worth almost Fr200 million. But one must also mention the years 
of talks, meetings, trips, and negotiations." 
  There is action on the agro-food market as well. On 
Wednesday, the Danone group, formerly BSN, signed an agreement 
involving the creation of a joint venture on a number of 
products that remain to be identified, with the exception of the 
group's leading product: Danone yogurt. Pernod-Ricard has also 
created a joint venture with Beijing Winery for the production 
of 11 million bottles of wines and vermouths worth Fr80 million. 
Pernod-Ricard will be hard-pressed to compete with 
Remy-Cointreau, whose cognac has been enjoying a good reputation 
in the Chinese community in Singapore and Malaysia since 1979. 
"Drinking cognac is a sign of success, it is the trendy thing 
to do," the company explains. Since 1980, two joint ventures 
have been established. The first produces a wine called Dinasty 
on a site 120 kilometers from Beijing and has now reached the 
10-million-bottle mark. The second produces a sparkling wine 
based on the champagne method, called Imperial Court. Its first 
vintage won instant approval last year with 150,000 bottles sold. 
  Last March, Degremont, a Lyonnaise des Eaux subsidiary and 
the world leader in water processing, announced five contracts 
for the design and construction of waste water reprocessing 
plants. The company first established itself in China as early 
as 1987; today it has 25 plants in the country. Because it had 
been largely benefiting from financial grants by France, 
Degremont was hit by the tension between Paris and Beijing 
caused by the Tiananmen massacre and by the susbsequent sale of 
aircraft to Taiwan. As a result, there were no new developments 
between 1990 and 1993. The company is currently seeking to end 
its dependence on the state's changing moods and is pleased to 
note that more and more contracts are funded with Chinese 
capital.

  [Text] Luxembourg, May 19 (AFP) -- The European court of 
justice dismissed a suit by Air France on Thursday [19 May] 
seeking to stop British Airways from buying out 49.9 percent of 
the French air company TAT. 
  The case dates back to November 1992 when the European 
Commission gave the go-ahead for the purchase. Air France 
lodged an appeal three months later, arguing that commission 
officials handling antitrust and competition regulations had 
refused to apply them to British Airways though they had 
enforced them in other comparable circumstances.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Philippe Tesson] </F>
  [Text] To the great embarrassment of the so-called 
institutional lists representing political parties or headed by 
men who are or have been in power, Bosnia is making a loud entry 
into the campaign for the European elections. Yesterday, 
Bernard-Henri Levy [French writer] announced a "Sarajevo" list. 
Today, Alexandre Minkowski [French professor] is due to confirm 
his intention of fighting a campaign in which the Bosnian 
tragedy would be one of the central themes. 
  The emotional impact of these initiatives, if they are 
confirmed, will be strong and will give the campaign an 
unexpected tone. The leaders of the "big" lists will be 
questioned on ground which they were planning to avoid. The 
intrusion of this tragic war into the debate on Europe will 
strengthen the public's image of the Twelve's impotence and 
hence revive the question of European legitimacy. 
  Indeed, how can people be criticized for questioning the 
meaning of Europe if it cannot help to settle conflicts causing 
bloodshed within it? But, at the same time, how can they be 
made to understand that the Twelve's responsibility lies not so 
much in their present paralysis, to which they are doomed, as in 
the criminal lack of foresight they demonstrated before the war 
broke out? Even if Europe had had or now had the political will 
to become involved in the conflict, it does not have the 
military means of doing so. This obvious fact should not calm 
our revulsion, but it should prompt us to moderate our European 
fervor. Maastricht is only at stake in this lamentable affair 
to the extent that the misleading campaign waged during the 
referendum presented that treaty as a panacea serving a utopia. 
  The Bosnian tragedy brings us back to the reality of Europe. 
It is a good thing that it should emerge in the campaign. Not 
to generate new illusions, which could lead us to believe that 
there is still time for the Twelve to intervene (what 
intervention and stemming from what unity?), but to ensure that 
we finally understand that, for a long time to come, Europe, and 
especially if it is expanded, will never be more than a 
community of interests, in the least lofty sense of the word.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Rocco Tolfa] </F>
  [Text] [Tolfa] Gianfranco Miglio Two - The Revenge. Until 
yesterday, he was preparing the ammunition for Umberto Bossi to 
fire. Today Miglio prepared another round of ammunition, but 
this time it was aimed at the leader of the Northern League and 
what powerful ammunition it was. 
  Miglio said Bossi was a liar when he told judges the 200 
million lire which the Northern League had received from 
Montedison was subsequently stolen. Miglio said this version of 
events was not true; instead, the money had ended up in the 
coffers of the party. Miglio added that the money was only an 
advance, and that the League's bosses believed that they would 
get more money. Miglio maintains that the League received money 
from a number of sources. 
  The League's Francesco Speroni said that the allegations 
were 
inferences, and Roberto Maroni added that the allegations were 
the product of bitterness. However, Miglio had plenty more 
revelations. He said that Bossi was preparing to form a 
secessionist movement and that he would try and get Silvio 
Berlusconi in trouble. 
  Miglio said he did not like the Freedom Alliance government, 
but he said he would vote for the confidence motion. 
  [Begin Miglio recording] If I have to drink a glass of 
castor 
oil, I prefer to drink it immediately so that I can get it over 
with. [end recording] 
  [Tolfa] Silvio Berlusconi can smile at another vote which he 
has managed to obtain. 
  Bossi, on the other hand, appeared disillusioned. He said 
that Miglio was a poor man who was bitter because he had not 
been made a minister, but that nevertheless he would go to see 
him soon. [end Tolfa recording]

<F P=106> [Report signed "r.l.": "Poor Devil, He Is Going Bananas -- </F>
Bossi Has the Last Word"] 
  [Text] Rome -- [Northern League Secretary] Bossi spoke 
last, and his words were heavy-handed: "[former League 
ideologue] Miglio? He must have felt so peeved at young 
[Institutional Reforms Minister] Speroni getting ahead of him 
that he went mildly bananas...." Thus ended the day when the 
League's former ideologue shot point-blank at the Bandwagon's 
[League nickname] leaders, and the latter finally replied with a 
broadside: Some, like [Interior Minister] Maroni, with 
affection; others, like Bossi, by branding him as a quasilunatic. 
  The first to reply to Miglio's accusations, in the morning, 
was [League Chairman] Franco Rocchetta. Interviewed immediately 
after the senator's [Miglio] speech in the house, the party's 
chairman minimized its impact: "Miglio? He was relatively 
tough, very articulate, but he did not say anything that we did 
not know already." 
  Then the press agencies published an interview granted by 
Miglio in the morning, in which he accused the League of being 
involved in illegal financing operations. This time it was 
Francesco Speroni who replied: "The professor is so outside the 
League from an organizational point of view, that I fail to 
understand how he dares make such inferences." The recently 
appointed minister also stated that he had offered Miglio the 
post of head of the institutional reform organizational 
structure: "I tried asking him for his help but, much to my 
regret, he refused," Speroni explained. 
  By now it was lunchtime and, in the Senate's refreshment 
bar, 
it was Roberto Maroni's turn to answer the professor's charges. 
"Despite everything," the interior minister said, "I am very 
fond of Miglio, and I would rather leave it to him to say 
spiteful things than say any myself, but his behavior is similar 
to [former Senate speaker] Spadolini's after [current Senate 
speaker] Scognamiglio was elected." In fact, according to 
Maroni, Miglio wanted a ministry for himself: "I personally 
followed all the negotiations with a view to forming the 
government, and I can assure you that we had to choose between 
accepting the Institutional Reforms Ministry without Miglio, or, 
alternatively, renouncing the Institutional Reforms Ministry in 
order to give Miglio another ministry, such as the higher 
education portfolio. For strategic reasons, the League opted 
for the first solution. Miglio would have preferred the latter." 
  Maroni went on to deny that the break-up between Miglio and 
Bossi took place in December: "I can testify to the fact that, 
three days before the negotiations for forming the government 
came to a close, there was a meeting at which Miglio did nothing 
but heap praise on Bossi." 
  Finally, in the evening, Bossi also joined the issue. "Poor 
devil, it is sad to see a 76-year old man seeking fulfillment 
through a portfolio.... But I understand him. He felt 
excluded. One of these days I will go to have a talk with him in 
the Senate." Bossi confirmed that the veto against Miglio came 
from [National Alliance leader] Fini and [Prime Minister] 
Berlusconi: "They had strong objections. I defended Miglio, 
but I can understand Berlusconi's viewpoint. Clearly, if a 
prime minister has someone in his cabinet who shoots his mouth 
off like this, the government would fall three times a day." 
Finally, as regards the illegal funding of the League: "Tell 
me where the bank is. I wish I had the power...."

<F P=106> [Interview with Maurizio Boccacci, leader of the extreme </F>
right-wing, by Gianluigi Pellegrino; place and date not given: 
"Fini, Watch Your Step or We Will Again Establish The True 
Social Movement" -- first paragraph is LA REPUBBLICA 
introduction] 
  [Text] Rome -- "Gianfranco Fini [National Alliance leader] 
must really watch his step. Otherwise he will lose his 
grassroots support with incredible speed, and we are ready here 
to reconstruct the true Italian Social Movement [MSI], with the 
help, among others, of many of his own men, including all those 
from the Salo Republic [fascist republic in northern Italy in 
1943] and the MSI grassroots groups." Thus spoke Maurizio 
Boccacci, the 37-year old leader of the Italian extreme right 
and formations which were disbanded last year through the 
Mancini law. 
  [Pellegrino] How come? The whole world is clamoring against 
the risk of a fascist comeback, and you who profess to be 
fascists are not satisfied? 
  [Boccacci] The question is not whether we are satisfied or 
not, but rather that no one can join forces with [Prime 
Minister] Berlusconi and be a fascist at the same time. At 
most, you can be a Freemason -- a full-fledged freemason of the 
worst kind. Remember that [former Freemason leader] Gelli said 
of him "he is quite a nice young lad." Since then, the 
magistrature has rehabilitated the P2 [outlawed Masonic lodge], 
and Berlusconi has become prime minister. If you put two and 
two together. We do not want to have anything to do with 
Freemasons. Let me tell you that I am much more concerned that 
today, as fascists, we are associated with Berlusconi, than I 
was concerned when they called us fascists and blamed us for all 
the evils in the world. 
  [Pellegrino] Let us go back to Fini. 
  [Boccacci] If Fini does not watch his step, if he does not 
uphold the values of fascism which nourish his broad electoral 
base, he runs the risk of becoming an empty shell, of losing his 
most genuine voters, and of having to rely increasingly on the 
traditionally Christian Democratic voters who have such a good 
understanding with the P2 members and the Freemasons. Great 
opportunities will then open up for us to reorganize -- for us 
who abhor unbridled capitalist liberalism even more than we do 
communism. 
  [Pellegrino] [MSI member] Pino Rauti started his electoral 
campaign in the European elections by commemorating Bombacci, 
the Communist who became a Mussolini supporter and was then 
executed at Dongo, and who certainly was not a capitalist. 
  [Boccacci] In fact, this is the hub of the question. If Fini 
pays heed to this kind of demand from the people as he only 
seems to do when he says that Mussolini was the greatest 
statesman of the century, it is one thing. 
  [Pellegrino] Otherwise? 
  [Boccacci] Otherwise a genuine reconstruction of the MSI 
might take place around Rauti and others like him. 
  [Pellegrino] On what issues, then, will Fini be put to the 
test? 
  [Boccacci] Broadly speaking, he should be adamant, rather 
than unconditionally accept Berlusconi's hyperliberalism, and he 
should relaunch an anti-Zionist policy which is opposed to 
international big business. I am also thinking in terms of a 
number of anti-immigration measures, of reclaiming Istria and 
Dalmatia, of abolishing the Mancino Laws and the Scelba Law, 
which prohibit the reconstruction of the Fascist Party. This is 
what the MSI grassroots movement claims and demands. 
  [Pellegrino] So, for the time being, you will remain 
bystanders. 
  [Boccacci] Not at all. Great opportunities are already 
opening up for us. Engrossed as he is in his portfolio-hunting 
and thirst for power, I really do not think that Fini will be 
capable of displaying the consistency which the grassroots 
expect from him.

<F P=106> [Report by Vittoria Sivo: "Trentin Tells Government: `This </F>
Will Increase Unemployment'"] 
  [Text] Rome -- Bruno Trentin called it "empty," "vague," 
and even "worrying." Sergio D'Antoni called it "confused," 
"unrealistic, and "generic." The program presented by Silvio 
Berlusconi has been rejected by the trade unions. The CGIL 
[Italian General Confederation of Labor] leader demolished it 
using with his severe criticism of the prime minister's Senate 
speech on Tuesday [17 May]. The CISL [Italian Confederation of 
Trade Unions] secretary general was slightly less harsh: 
"neither passed nor failed," the government will be judged on 
its deeds, but it was given very low grades in several subjects. 
  All the trade unions have issued their assessments, 
nullifying the albeit cautious expressions of favor that 
Berlusconi won a fortnight ago when he promised the three 
federations full observance of the July 1993 collective 
bargaining agreement. Pietro Larizza of the UIL [Italian 
Federation of Trade Unions] had already criticized the 
government's aims -- "That is not a program; it is merely a 
draft of a program" -- because of the number of questions left 
unanswered and its excessively vague formulations. 
  In a crescendo of alarmed comments, Trentin declared himself 
"worried and frightened" by the "substantial vagueness" rather 
than by the program's gaps and omissions. It reveals both the 
difficulty in reconciling the various tendencies within the 
coalition and the attempt to "reserve such a broad discretionary 
decisionmaking margin as to prompt serious concern about how the 
government intends to manage its relations with parliament and 
the social partners." This very serious charge is almost 
tantamount to one of authoritarianism. The CGIL secretary 
general noted "serious ambiguities" concerning foreign policy, a 
"surprising methodological contrast" with the programs of all 
the other governments of the industrialized countries, and major 
inconsistencies left unresolved by the historical assessment of 
fascism. A "total" absence of analysis of the Italian economic 
crisis, which has led to a complete silence regarding the means 
of reviving the economy envisaged by the July agreement. 
Trentin also criticized the tax proposals and the way in which 
Berlusconi intends to resolve the matter of guarantees regarding 
his business interests. 
  The section concerning unemployment was given a definite 
thumbs-down. The CGIL leader accused the government of wanting 
to carry out "complete deregulation throughout the labor market, 
modifying existing legislation to the extent of promising a 
continuation of the Ciampi government's policy, which was itself 
very much open to criticism." It would entail making employment 
"increasingly unstable," with the result of increasing the 
number of unemployed, as in Spain. 
  The CISL's verdict was a negative one, too, though the tone 
and the language used at the press conference that D'Antoni and 
his deputy, Raffaele Morese, devoted to Berlusconi's program 
were somewhat different from those of the CGIL secretary. Faced 
with a government plan that "does not choose and that creates 
expectations on all sides," with a considerable "gap" between 
the stated objectives and the policies for achieving them, "we 
will issue a challenge," placing the emphasis on an incomes 
policy, responding "to every point," and defending the trade 
unions' role in the policy of consultations, without any 
preconceived opposition. Indeed, D'Antoni's reservations did 
not extend as far as to make him advocate a no-confidence vote 
in the Senate. "At this stage it is better for them to govern." 
In other words, if he were a senator, the CISL secretary would 
probably choose not to vote, since he could not grant his vote 
of confidence." 
  Though they do not consider the creation of a million jobs 
impossible ("who could say they oppose it?"), the CISL leaders 
find the proposals for achieving this objective very 
unsatisfactory, if not actually counterproductive. It would be 
better to implement the measures identified in [European 
Commission President] Delors plan, which depend chiefly on 
boosting public works and a reorganization of working hours. 
The proposals with regard to taxation seem unclear too: Does 
the promise of tax exemption for those earning less than 10 
million lire affect only employed workers, or self-employed 
workers, too? It is a major difference, since according to the 
experts consulted, the resulting loss of revenue "would vary 
from 600 to 6,000 billion lire." The CISL also wants to know 
how this loss of revenue will be compensated. 
  Even CISNAL's [Italian Confederation of National Trade 
Unions] initial enthusiasm has cooled having been given some 
"surprises" by Berlusconi's program -- some good, some bad. The 
assessment issued by its secretary general, Mauro Nobilia, is 
worth quoting, not so much because of his confederation's 
influence (very small in numerical terms), but because of the 
union's closeness to the MSI [Italian Social Movement]. Nobilia 
was reassured by the "reaffirmation of a state presence in the 
economy," while he feared a "sharply derestrictive" approach, 
and he appreciated the references to solidarity and the family, 
the rejection of the patronage system, the boost to the role of 
small business, and the intention to "examine" the Maastricht 
Treaty. But he believes that the program was "ill-defined" on 
the subject of taxation and is "very worried" about the measures 
announced affecting the labor market.

<F P=106> [Interview with Budget Minister Giancarlo Pagliarini by </F>
Monica Setta in Rome; date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [LA VOCE] Minister, there is 
something that is not very clear about the so-called war over 
the responsibility for privatization. Should this not have been 
yours? 
  [Pagliarini] We discussed this during the negotiation stage 
of the formation of the government. However, I do not think 
that there are still problems. The responsibility should go to 
[Industry Minister] Gnutti. He will have to manage the layoffs 
with my agreement and with that of the treasury minister [Dini]. 
  [LA VOCE] But was there not a Northern League move to give 
Lamberto Dini the authority? 
  [Pagliarini] We have gotten to know each other better, and I 
am sure that there will be an agreement with Dini. We will not 
have great difficulty. Those who are speculating about presumed 
quarrels within the three-man team are making a big mistake. I 
have the impression that the government will not delude 
expectations, particularly on privatization. 
  [LA VOCE] Then let us get down to details. Let us start with 
the mother of all privatization: STET [Turin Telephone Finance 
Company]. Is it true that you want this to be a public company? 
  [Pagliarini] Certainly, we are even in favor of a super 
public company. However, STET must also manage to find strong 
industrial alliances. In the coming years there will only be 
five giants in the world telecommunications market. STET must 
have its cards in order to be one of these. 
  [LA VOCE] So an alliance with [French] Alcatel-Alsthom will 
be all right? 
  [Pagliarini] Let us put it this way: I think that perhaps it 
would be possible to find a partner that would offer STET better 
guarantees of success by looking in Asia, or in the United 
States. No, Alcatel is not the best. However, STET is open to 
offers. 
  [LA VOCE] Excuse me if I am insistent. Will the Berlusconi 
government diligently take [former Prime Minister] Ciampi's last 
note on STET's privatization into consideration? 
  [Pagliarini] I repeat that we are in favor of a public 
company. However, we will discuss everything again. 
Berlusconi's privatizations will not see any clashes between 
small shareholders and the Mediobanca-type shareholding. 
Decisions will be made wisely, case by case. 
  [LA VOCE] Let us pass on to ENEL [National Electric Power 
Company]. What are the government's ideas? 
  [Pagliarini] The hypothesis of the golden share over 10 
years 
is good for ENEL. We still have to discuss the AGIP [Italian 
National Oil Company] issue in greater depth. We have to take 
measures that favor plurality, and avoid one thing in particular 
at all costs. 
  [LA VOCE] What? 
  [Pagliarini] We must avoid making harming the small saver. 
It 
is a risk that could be run with the privatization of STET, and 
that risk must be eliminated completely. Finally, privatization 
must be used to trigger off a real industrial policy.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Federico Orlando: "Oscars Night"] </F>
  [Text] What is President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro playing at? 
Shamelessly flouting the rules of the new television democracy, 
he granted not a single smile, not the shadow of a smile, to the 
television cameras that focused on him as he listened 26 times 
to the litany of Berlusconi and his ministers pledging to him 
their allegiance to the Republic, the Constitution, the laws, 
and so on, and so on. 
  Why was Scalfaro not smiling, while the prime minister 
openly 
(and justifiably) displayed his joy and even [Interior Minister] 
Maroni, in his casual gray suit contrasting with the prevailing 
blue, looked less than usual like some character from one of 
Ossian's funeral poems. We think we know why: On Republic 
Night, the president felt his shoulders burdened by a second 
responsibility together with that of guarantor assigned to him 
by the Constitution -- an unexpected responsibility as leader of 
the opposition. 
  This is no paradox. Since election day there has been no 
opposition in Italy. There is no opposition from the Left, 
which is lying like some huge, brain-dead organism; and there is 
no opposition from the Center which, despite the million votes 
gained, is represented in parliament by a tiny minority 
undermined by many opportunists prepared to go over to the 
winning side. 
  In fact, to be honest, this is not the first time that the 
opposition has disappeared in Italy. During the years of the 
historical compromise, which was previously called assemblyism 
(because it substituted the parliamentary assembly for the 
government in the role of the country's political leader) and 
subsequently called associationism (that is, criminal 
association between majority and opposition in order to avert 
problems), Italy relinquished both the function of government, 
which was delegated to the assembly, and the function of 
opposition, which was eliminated by criminal agreement. Now 
credit is due to the Right led by Berlusconi at least for its 
loudly proclaimed determination to regain the function of 
government. 
  But the opposition remains invisible, like some mythical 
creature. The Left cannot make up its mind to throw out the 
rubbish of the ideologies inherited from the 19th century and to 
create the great Democratic Party -- liberal and Rooseveltian. 
The Center cannot make up its mind to become intensely liberal, 
that is, equidistant from the radicalism of the Left and from 
the Reaganism of the Right, thus facilitating liberal gains and 
at the same time opposing illiberal regressions. 
  In this coma being suffered by the opposition, which is as 
profound as the new majority is coarse and unsubtle, there is 
only one force on which democracy can depend to ensure that its 
two supporting columns, government and opposition, remain 
standing as best they can: Scalfaro. Berlusconi in government 
and Scalfaro in opposition. This will be the Italian people's 
democratic guarantee. We know that the Italian people do not 
like Scalfaro much. Those of his own generation do not like him 
because of his youthful Catholic intransigence, and the younger 
generations do not like him because of his ecstatic manner of 
talking, with his eyes raised to the heavens, using lofty words, 
spelling out the most obvious concepts in the most leaden manner. 
  And yet this man is the repository of the trust of those 
Italian democrats (by the way, how many democrats are there in 
Italy?) who refuse to see guarantees and rules left like the 
beaches on a Sunday after the encampment by the hordes, with 
their baggage of lasagne, eggplant pie, toilet paper, and other 
goods. We must hope that the chief of state and leader of the 
opposition, Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, will be granted the most 
complete success, namely, the government's democratic 
irreproachableness.

  [Excerpt] The controversy among Socialists continues and 
Armando Vara, a Socialist Party leader, has contributed to 
fanning the flames. He is the author of newspaper commentary in 
DIARIO DE NOTICIAS. He believes that President Mario Soares is 
acting as an opposition force and not as an organ of 
sovereignty. His opinion mirrors that of Jorge Lacao. 
  [Correspondent Sandra Sousa] Jorge Lacao's criticism of 
President Soares has inflamed the Socialist rank and file, who 
immediately shied away from the stand taken by this 
distinguished member of the party's national secretariat. 
Armando Vara, a socialist leader, however, fanned the flames of 
this controversy. In an article published today in DIARIO DE 
NOTICIAS, Armando Vara says President Soares is acting not as an 
organ of sovereignty but as an opposition force. He says that 
in this way, Soares is diminishing the role of the Socialist 
Party. Without beating about the bush, he said it is legitimate 
for the Socialist Party to feel its territory has been invaded. 
And just like Jorge Lacao, he asked the president to let them 
work. 
  [Announcer] Socialist Party Secretary General Antonio 
Guterres continues to distance himself from this controvery. 
Guterres, who declined to react publicly to Jorge Lacao's 
article, is doing the same with regard to Armando Vara's 
article. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["S.N." report on "Gruppo" opinion poll: "People's Party </F>
Leads PSOE by 7 Percent in Voting Intentions for European 
Elections"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- The People's Party would win the 
elections to the European Parliament if they were held today, 
according to the voting intentions shown in a "Gruppo" opinion 
poll for ABC. Nearly 40 percent of the electorate would cast 
their votes for the party led by Jose Maria Aznar, which would 
mean a 17-percent increase on the 1989 European elections and 
winning 26 or 27 seats out of a total of 64. The PSOE [Spanish 
Socialist Workers Party] would come second, with 31 percent of 
the votes and 22 European deputies. Abstention would be less 
than 15 percent of voters. 
  The escape of the former Civil Guard director general, the 
"Ibercorp affair," with the jailing of former Bank of Spain 
Governor Mariano Rubio and former Madrid stock exchange trustee 
Manuel de la Concha, the Filesa affair -- in short, corruption 
-- could take their toll and cost the PSOE very dear if the 
current voting intentions for the European elections persist. 
  According to an opinion poll conducted by "Gruppo" for ABC, 
citizens' voting intentions have undergone a considerable change 
since the last elections. Whereas in 1989 the PSOE prevailed 
with 40 percent of the votes, while the People's Party won 21.7 
percent, it would now be Jose Maria Aznar's party which would 
win the support of 38.5 percent of the electorate, as against 
the Socialist Party's 31.7 percent. 
  In terms of the number of seats, the People's Party could 
see 
the figure from the last elections increased by a dozen, since 
it could hold 26 or 27 -- the same as the PSOE four years ago -- 
while Felipe Gonzalez' party would win 22, representing a loss 
of five European deputies. 
  The other political parties would scarcely change their 
position. The exception is United Left [IU], which, if the 
voting intentions shown in the poll persist until 12 June, would 
double its number of votes and seats. In 1989, Julio Anguita's 
candidates won 7.3 percent of the votes, which enabled them to 
hold four seats. The figures indicated by the poll are much 
more encouraging; IU could win the support of 14 percent of the 
electorate, which would be equivalent to nine or 10 seats. 
  Convergence and Union would also experience an improvement, 
although less marked than IU's. Jordi Pujol's party could gain 
a seat (rising to three from the two won in 1989), thanks to the 
votes of 4.7 percent of the electorate. 
  The aforementioned four parties could share 60 of the 64 
seats which Spanish citizens have to elect. The four remaining 
seats would be distributed as follows: One for the Nationalist 
Coalition (comprising the Basque Nationalist Party, the Canary 
Islands Coalition, the Valencian Union, the Aragonese Party, and 
the Majorcan Union), and between one and three for PEP 
(comprising Eusko Alkartasuna [Basque Solidarity], Republican 
Left of Catalonia, Comunero Land, and the Castilian Regionalist 
Party), the Greens, and Andalusian Power. The Social and 
Democratic Center Forum, with 0.8 percent of the interviewees' 
votes, would secure no European deputy. 
  According to the opinion poll, only 13.7 percent of citizens 
have expressed their intention not to vote. Hence the turnout 
would be quite high, since 57 percent of voters, who have firmly 
stated that they will vote, would go to the polls, plus another 
18.4 percent undecided. In addition, the level of abstention 
would not differ between men and women (13.7 percent of both 
sexes), although 3 percent more men than women will go to the 
polls. 
  Last, abstention will be greatest among the voters who voted 
for IU in the last elections.

<F P=106> [Susana Alcelay report: "Grinan: Labor Market Has Revived, </F>
at Stage Prior to Recovery"] 
  [Excerpt] Madrid -- Labor Minister Jose Antonio Grinan 
asserted yesterday that "we are witnessing a stage of revival of 
the labor market, which normally precedes expansionary cycles of 
the economy," although he pointed out that it will depend on the 
reforms pending -- the INEM [National Employment Institute], 
vocational health, and a single law on unemployment benefit. He 
also announced that the government is considering imposing 
penalties when one of the parties refuses to negotiate an 
agreement. 
  The labor minister appeared yesterday after the Congress [of 
Deputies] had given its approval to the labor reform in order to 
explain that the government had kept its election pledge to 
carry through this law, which he said is the only law possible 
right now. "It is a reform," he stated, "which goes no further 
because it would be impossible to apply, and if it fell short, 
it would be impossible to apply." 
  Grinan admitted that the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers 
Party] has had to yield to the demands of some groups such as 
Convergence and Union and the Basque Nationalist Party in some 
aspects of the labor reform, although he emphasized that "the 
amendments which have been introduced have improved the original 
text and served to achieve greater consensus." "The labor 
reform," he stressed, "is basically what the Socialist 
government wanted." 
  The minister showed himself very optimistic about the fall 
in 
unemployment recorded in April -- 24,810 people -- and stated: 
"I will not say that we are in a stage of growth, but that the 
economic trend has changed, and we must consolidate this period 
of revival in order to proceed to recovery, which will be more 
effective if we introduce structural reforms capable of creating 
jobs." 
  He pointed out that the reforms pending are a single law 
containing all the changes introduced in unemployment benefits, 
a vocational health law, and the reform of the INEM. 
Nevertheless, he made it very clear that the government does 
not intend to approve the strike law for the present, although 
it was also included in the PSOE's election program. 
  Grinan did not hesitate to cite the labor reform as one of 
the factors which have helped revive the labor market, since "it 
has especially helped the hiring of groups with difficulties." 
  He referred to the outcome of the first labor reform 
measures 
to be introduced -- the forms of hiring approved by decree law 
in January -- and disclosed that 75,000 apprenticeship contracts 
were registered up to 30 April, mostly with pay exceeding the 
Interprofessional Minimum Wage, and 40 percent with young people 
who have not completed Basic General Education. 
  The labor minister cited one of the essential aspects of the 
labor reform -- collective bargaining -- and emphasized that the 
aim is to give labor relations between the social agents a 
priority role. He therefore called on employers and trade 
unions for an effort to "make profitable" the negotiations and 
end the year with the creation of net employment. 
  On this point, he announced that the government is 
considering the possibility of imposing penalties when any of 
the parties refuses to negotiate, contrary to the ethical 
principle of the "duty to negotiate" contained in the Workers' 
Statute. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Denmark is saying no to a UN request to contribute 
personnel and equipment to the UN peacekeeping force in Rwanda. 
The Danish foreign minister says Denmark is already 
contributing UN troops at other sites. In addition, he 
questions whether the United Nations has a reasonable chance to 
carry out the task in Rwanda. 
  The United Nations has also asked Sweden to support the UN 
force in Rwanda. According to UN diplomats, Sweden could 
contribute engineering troops, helicopters, and hospitals.

<F P=106> [Article by Pekka Vaisanen: "Supplemental Budget Promises </F>
Youth Jobs and Educational Opportunities"] 
  [Excerpt] The government is trying to create 40,000 new 
positions for young people yet this year in either the labor 
force or in schools. The employing of young people was a central 
theme in this year's second proposed supplemental budget that 
was presented to the Eduskunta on Friday [22 April]. 
  About 700 million Finnish markkas [FMk] are set aside for 
increasing educational and job opportunities for youth. 
  The intention is to increase by 33,000 the projected number 
of young people that will be accepted for educational placement 
this fall. About 8,000 of these slots will require indentured 
service by the recipient. Education by indenturement will almost 
double if reality follows the projections. 
  Job-providing subsidies will be paid for those accepted 
under 
the indenture program. This will amount to FMk1,500 monthly per 
person for the first year, and FMk750 per month during the 
second year. 
  The remainder of the educational spots will be provided in 
the 10th grade of high school, in trade schools, and in tertiary 
schools. 
  Some 6,500 young people completing their education this year 
will have job-providing subsidies offered on their behalf for a 
period of six months if they do not find employment on the open 
market. 
<H5>  Insuring EKA Costly </H5>
  The supplemental budget will add almost FMk1.4 billion to 
this year's government expenses. The increase in expenses will 
be covered by additional borrowing. 
  Besides the program for the youth, the biggest budget item 
will be the insuring of savings deposits in EKA [expansion 
unknown]. This phase of the government deficit will amount to 
FMk635 million. The total government deficit will be almost 
double this amount. 
  The government will achieve spending cuts in financing 
arrangements and bonuses linked to the national debt. These 
spending cuts are estimated to equal FMk400 million. Over FMk100 
million will be cut from the supplementing of local government 
tax income. Expenses associated with refugees will be FMk80 
million under earlier estimates. 
  Some FMk40 million will be set aside for humanitarian aid to 
Bosnia. 
<H5>  50 Million for EU Referendum </H5>
  Fifty million markkas are being set aside in the 
supplemental 
budget for conducting the referendum on European Union [EU] 
membership. Some of the funds needed for this purpose have 
already been provided by this year's budget. 
  Compensation payment for the whitewater preservation will 
cost 55 million more over the remainder of the year. 
  The local government crisis act, the so-called Karkkila Law, 
formulated by the cabinet, will lead to an expense of FMk15 
million over the rest of the year. This to-be-enacted law will 
authorize the granting of over FMk200 million in loans to local 
governments in financial crises. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Trade Across Eastern Border </F>
Increasing Rapidly"] 
  [Text] Trade between Finland and Russia is continuing its 
explosive growth. During the first three months of this year, 
nearly 390,000 metric tons of export and import goods crossed 
the border. If the trend continues at this rate, the total trade 
in goods will exceed 1.5 million metric tons this year. The 
corresponding figure in 1993, a record year, was just under 
900,000 metric tons. 
  The main increase has been in exports to Russia. During the 
first three months of this year, the flow of export goods 
increased a full 217 percent over the corresponding period last 
year. At the same time, the flow of import goods rose by 4.9 
percent. 
  Most of the export products originate in other countries and 
pass through Finland as goods in transit. During the first three 
months of this year, transit trade totaled 214,000 metric tons. 
That is an increase of 365 percent over the corresponding period 
last year.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Unemployment in March at February </F>
Level"] 
  [Text] According to figures from the Government Office of 
Statistics, the number of unemployed in March remained at the 
level for February, but rose by more than 60,000 compared with 
March last year. The figure for seasonably adjusted unemployment 
also stabilized at the February level. 
  The jobless rate rose from March of last year to March of 
this year by 2.5 percent, or to 19.8 percent. The rate for males 
was a full 22 percent, while that for females was around 17 
percent. 
  There were around 100,000 unemployed youths. The rate for 
youth unemployment was 41 percent. 
  In the public sector and private service sector there were 
96,000 individuals without jobs, in industry 85,000, and in 
construction 74,000. The highest rate of unemployment was found 
in home construction, with nearly half of this sector's labor 
force not working.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Bo Stenstrom: "Austerity Even Under Lipponen </F>
Government"] 
  [Text] Social Democratic Party [SDP] leader Lipponen spoke 
sensibly about economic policy. Generally speaking, the next 
government will have to pursue the same policy as the current 
one, but that is scarcely what Lipponen's and Ehrnrooth's 
listeners had been expecting, writes Bo Stenstrom. 
  Things went as many people had suspected they would -- on 
the 
same day that Social Democratic Party leader Paavo Lipponen and 
mining consultant Casimir Ehrnrooth were speaking at the 
People's Palace, the number of unemployed dropped by 30,000, and 
had it not been for the farmers' and forest owners' MTK 
[Agricultural Producers Association], there would have been no 
devil to attack. 
  Excluding the attack on the MTK, the message by both 
Lipponen 
and Ehrnrooth seemed objective and responsible. But that was 
scarcely what their listeners had been expecting. 
  It is true that Lipponen talked about speedy and selective 
economic stimulation and rapid tax relief as a way of increasing 
consumption. But he did not say what should be stimulated or by 
how much. 
  It should be noted that the SDP leader favored an austere 
finance policy during the next election period in order to get 
the deficit in the national economy under control. And he said 
that the public economy's share of the gross national product 
was extremely high. 
  There will not be enough room for investments in such an 
environment, Lipponen said. That is what Aho, Viinanen, Korkman, 
Koroma, and others are in the habit of saying. 
  Is tax relief the answer? 
  Lipponen said quite rightly that it is not sensible to 
postpone all tax relief until the economy improves -- an upswing 
that, incidentally, will probably occur sooner than the current 
indicators show. He also pointed out that there is no 
possibility of major tax changes, but at the same time, he said 
that we must look for opportunities to widen the tax base. 
  That sounds hopeful -- but wait until Lipponen, who may end 
up as prime minister after the election, states specifically 
what is going to be taxed or what is going to be subjected to 
higher taxes and how much higher those taxes will be. That is 
something he ought to be talking about in plenty of time before 
the election. 
  When Ehrnrooth talks about the MTK and timber prices, he is 
in the highest degree a party to the proceeding. It is not an 
easy matter to raise timber prices, but it should also be 
remembered that timber prices fell 40 percent before being 
increased by 15 percent. 
  It is estimated that the export industry will earn about 2.5 
billion markkas more thanks to the VAT [valued-added tax] reform 
this summer, and in connection with both the decision on nuclear 
power and that on the EU [European Union], the lumber industry 
has clearly stated that if the right decisions are not made, it 
will move abroad. And no one can guarantee the opposite no 
matter what happens. 
  So there may be the sound of clinking glass in the house if 
it accuses others of "blackmail." 
  Regardless of the MTK, more and more forest land is coming 
to 
be owned by someone other than farmers and MTK members. Many of 
those owners are average supporters of the SDP and Lipponen. 
Unlike the farmers, they cannot cut timber themselves and can 
scarcely afford to sell their forest property at a loss. 
  Ehrnrooth was right about a lot of other things. The more 
pressure and even the more unforeseeable international effects 
we are exposed to (exchange rates and interest rates, for 
example), the more important it is that there be continuity and 
predictability in the economic policy over the long term. 
  It would be ridiculous to claim that the current government 
ought to have continued the Blue-Red government's policy just 
for the sake of continuity -- even beyond the first budget, 
which it inherited -- after the bottom fell out completely. 
  On the other hand, there is much in Lipponen's and 
Ehrnrooth's message to indicate that it should be possible to 
form a government across the center line after the election. The 
government should commit itself to a program extending into the 
following election period and based on the labor market, so that 
we do not squander the economic upswing through devastating 
inflation. 
  If membership in the EU becomes a reality on the first of 
next year, Lipponen knows as well as Aho or Salolainen that that 
will put further pressure on the national economy. 
  If someone is likely to become prime minister next spring, 
he 
does not need to learn from Siberia as long as there are public 
opinion polls. It remains to be seen whether the presidential 
election tactics will be repeated in such a way that Lipponen 
represents the indispensable prime minister approach while 
others take care of painting the current government in dark 
colors and building castles in the air for the future.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "`Partnership' Neither Demands nor Promises </F>
Much"] 
  [Text] Finland now lacks but the final signatures before 
taking on the obligations of something that NATO offered with 
the description: Partnership for Peace. According to government 
explanations, our purpose is "to primarily be a contributing 
partner," particularly as regards the training of peacekeeping 
troops. Our other spheres of interest are cooperation in rescue 
missions and conservation of the environment. 
  In international relations a contributor typically also 
expects to get something in return. It is likely that Finland's 
aim is to gain more avenues for diplomatic contact. Partnership 
opens the possibility of many different types of communication 
and discussion, and these can be used to express one's own 
opinions as well as to gain useful information. It is through 
these means that Finns can be expected to become more familiar 
with the customs and modes of thinking of the Western alliance. 
  Finland is not, on the other hand, seeking new "defense 
solutions". The partnership treaty does not even make such a 
thing possible, but the government is still doing the right 
thing when it emphasises this fact. The original purpose of the 
partnership was to offer some sort of replacement for East 
European nations that, after they had separated from the Warsaw 
Pact, were seeking, specifically, a new defense solution, to 
wit: NATO membership. The partnership was NATO's novel way to 
offer them a hand at the same time that the other hand was 
keeping them at arm's length. 
  Part of the reason that the NATO countries wanted to 
initiate 
a partnership with neutral countries such as Finland and Sweden 
is that then the treaties would not appear to merely be a polite 
form of evasiveness toward East Europe. Russia was invited to 
join for the opposite reason: so that the partnership would not 
be seen as an attempt to isolate Russia and to bind its 
neighbors into a foreign military alliance. 
  Up until now the effort to strike a balance has been only 
half successful. Finland and Sweden have agreed to join. Russia, 
which also agreed to join in time, has begun delaying the 
procedure. In Moscow irritation with NATO has been strong at 
times, particularly because of the events in the Balkans. Russia 
also has its own thoughts on what kind of relationship it wants 
with NATO. It feels that, in one way or another, any treaty must 
underscore Russia's status as one of the world's great powers. 
  Originally the NATO offer had the attached condition that 
the 
rate and direction of developing collaboration can be determined 
on a case-by-case basis. In this way NATO keeps its options open 
while avoiding the peril that it would be required to deal with 
its partners as a single, united entity. Even so, NATO will have 
a tough time accepting Moscow's latest opinions. Were Russia to 
gain a decidedly privileged status, the value of the partnership 
for East European countries might be eroded. 
  From Finland's standpoint it is preferable that Russia would 
also enter some form of a partnership treaty. This would 
facilitate multifaceted communication throughout Europe. 
Russia's decision is not actually a pivotal issue, however, for 
significant security decisions are unaffected by the partnership 
treaties. These will be dealt with in other forums. 
  Part of the intended contents, generally, is of secondary or 
no interest to Finland. For example, Finland does not have to 
separately prove to NATO that its Armed Forces are subject to 
democratically chosen supervision. For Finland, the partnership 
means one form of multifaceted cooperation. If if is correctly 
implemented, it promises limited but real benefits.

  [Excerpts] President Denktas received Gustave Feissel, the 
UN secretary general's deputy special representative, in 
connection with the talks that have been held in Vienna. 
[passage omitted] In a statement to journalists after the 
meeting, Denktas said: 
  [Begin Denktas recording] Although Feissel attached 
importance to the matters we insist on, he maintained that we 
should agree to the map. Regarding the access road to Maras 
[Varosha], they agreed that we should have authority over that 
road. However, they took the approach that we should reach an 
agreement with the United Nations to enable the UN officials to 
control it. In that case, we would be able to stand around it, 
etc. Meanwhile, a partial withdrawal of troops from that area 
is being discussed. 
  They have confirmed that the Nicosia International Airport 
[NIA] will have two gates for entry and exit. Nevertheless, we 
have not been furnished with a map of the airport thus far. 
Consequently, we have not been given enough help to be able to 
consider the matter as a whole. We are worried that the Greek 
Cypriots may seek a court decision to close down the airport 
because of the noise it will make. Statements have been 
published in the Greek Cypriot newspapers on that matter. They 
say that they will consult their legal advisers and note that 
they will be able to obstruct the operation of the airport. 
  Regarding the use of the NIA by the Greek Cypriot airline, 
they have agreed that the Turkish Cypriot airline should also 
use that airport under equal conditions. It seems that they 
also agree that Turkish Cypriot passenger aircraft using that 
airport should be allowed carry their logo. 
  Yes, a certain degree of progress has been made. However, 
the problems have not been resolved. We must have authority to 
resolve those problems. We shall hold talks with the Government 
and quickly take the matter to the Republican Assembly. They 
have said that we do not have much time. They may be right. We 
have informed them that we are prepared to convene the Council 
of Ministers and the Republican Assembly even during the 
religious holidays. [end recording] 
  A correspondent recalled the proposal to open simultaneously 
Maras and the NIA. Denktas replied: 
  [Begin Denktas recording] A certain degree of progress has 
been made on that matter. They have made a proposal that is 
close to the one we made some time ago. However, they have not 
agreed to our proposal as it stands. They have proposed that 
that the Greek Cypriots get access to the northern part of 
Dhimokratias Avenue after our direct flights from the NIA begin. 
That area will be placed under UN control, but the Greek 
Cypriots will have access to it when our direct flights take off 
from the NIA and when the routes our aircraft will fly are 
established. They are trying to work out the simultaneous use 
of Maras and the NIA. 
  We also have to consider our passports. When we say we shall 
fly with our own passports, it means that we shall be issued a 
visa on a piece of paper. That is the system that is now 
applied when Turkish Cypriots wish to travel to Britain and the 
United States. However, we still retain our passports. 
  Russia was the country that opposed that most. We have not 
been able to understand Russia's approach. That country is an 
important UN Security Council member. We hoped that Russia too 
would agree to the UN Security Council's decision, but Russia 
reportedly is opposed to the idea for the time being. Let us 
wait and see whether it will change its mind. [end recording] 
  Another journalist asked Denktas whether or not the UN 
secretary general's report will be delayed or an interim report 
submitted. Denktas replied as follows: 
  [Begin Denktas recoding] I do not know. However, I tried to 
explain to Mr. Feissel today that there were matters that should 
have been discussed. We have held talks on them in Vienna, 
which means that not everything was discussed in detail in the 
past. That is why we had to meet in Vienna. An effort was made 
to have Robert Lamb and Gustave Feissel agree on various issues. 
Lamb agreed on various points, but the UN officials objected to 
them. Talks were held in goodwill. They have put a kind of 
pressure on us by saying that the UN secretary general's report 
is ready and the UN secretary general is about to sign it. 
However, they have failed to clarify various issues even at the 
present time. They have not submitted the map of the NIA. The 
agreement about having two gates at the airport was clearly 
confirmed only today. We were informed that the map will depict 
the two gates. All that means that there is still work to be 
done. 
  Nevertheless, they still maintain the approach that all 
these 
are details and ask us whether or not we accept the map and to 
place the access road to Maras under their juristiction. They 
caution us that the UN secretary general's report will be 
reflect our approach if we object. They wish to place the 
matter in their own preferred framework. What is important, 
however, is the agreement that will be reached between the two 
sides. [end recording]

  [Text] Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department special 
coordinator on the Cyprus issue, expressed grave disappointment 
over Rauf Denktas' negative response to the 21 March document on 
the confidence-building measures. In a statement to CyBC [the 
Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation] in New York, the U.S. official 
said the current opportunity was the first in years to remove 
the deadlock and noted the need for a new direction. Lamb told 
the CyBC correspondent that Gustave Feissel has sent his report 
to UN Headquarters and that the Butrus-Ghali report to the 
Security Council would be submitted on Monday at the latest. 
  The U.S. official said he expects the bulk of the 
responsibility for the collapse of the talks to be attributed to 
Denktas. Asked what will follow the report, Lamb said it was 
too early to say and added that after the report is submitted 
there will be consultations among the Security Council members.

  [Text] European Parliament [EP] President Egon Klepsch has 
stated that the EP supports the European Union [EU] expansion 
through the accession of Cyprus and Malta, and that he will also 
support this position at the Corfu Summit conference to be held 
in June. Klepsch stressed: We must exert every effort toward 
finding a peaceful Cyprus solution. It would be an honor for 
whomever achieves this goal. 
  Klepsch, who is on a two-day official visit to Cyprus, made 
this statement after meeting with House of Representatives 
President Alexis Galanos this morning. 
  The House of Representatives president said Klepsch's visit 
stresses the EP decision and collective desire to support 
Cyprus' efforts for its accession to the EU. Galanos noted: The 
most substantive message to the Turkish side so that it may sit 
at the talks with the political will to find a solution is for 
the talks on Cyprus' accession to the EU to begin in January 
1995. Galanos said he was satisfied with Klepsch's moral support 
in these difficult times. 
  The EP president also met with party leaders and 
representatives today. Now he is in a meeting with President 
Glavkos Kliridhis.

<F P=106> [Article by N. Khasapopoulos: "Unified Defense Gains Ground"] </F>
  [Text] Immediately after the Easter holiday the formulation 
of the Unified Defense Area of Greece and Cyprus will enter its 
final stage with the (second within two months) visit of K. 
Iliadis, the Cyprus minister of defense, even though the 
strategic obligations of the two countries have yet to be 
defined fully. Although the timetable for the implementation of 
the joint Greek-Cypriot decisions is being followed faithfully 
(this was achieved following specific instructions by Prime 
Minister A. Papandreou to Minister of Defense Yer. Arsenis) 
several issues remain undecided on both sides and need to be 
settled as soon as possible. 
  Arsenis appears optimistic on the implementation of the 
second defense doctrine in Greek history (the first is that of 
advanced border outposts) not so much because of the faithful 
implementation of the timetable as because of the fact that the 
objections of our allies, especially the British, have been 
toned down. According to a statement of the minister of defense 
to "TO VIMA," in his recent discussions with foreign military 
attaches, the unified defense doctrine of Greece and Cyprus has 
been relegated by the allies to a secondary issue. Even within 
NATO -- as he said -- the interest of the allies, including the 
Turks, to learn more about the content of this unique defense 
system has stopped. 
  A certain embarrassment felt especially by the Greek 
military 
after the TV presentation of certain aspects of the doctrine by 
Cypriot officials has now been overcome since both sides agreed 
on the necessity to keep the strategic plans secret. New 
Democracy Chairman Milt. Evert told at some point Cyprus 
President Gl. Kliridis (who in Salonica had made certain 
statements regarding the defense doctrine) that "the Turks would 
be willing to pay even $10 million to find out about details we 
make public on television." As a result, the official statements 
are now curtailed and the initiative is in the hands of the 
military staff officers (Greek and Cypriots) who feverishly work 
on the strategic plans. 
  A second problem relates to the best possible coordination 
between the Ministries of Defense and Foreign Affairs in 
handling this issue. The military side found out that in the 
view of the diplomats the new defense doctrine had one 
objective, namely to serve as a strong bargaining card in the 
hands of the Greek Cypriots and that the withdrawal of the 
doctrine will coincide with the announcement that Cyprus is 
demilitarized. The coordination of the diplomats with the 
military was achieved after a recent meeting between [Foreign 
Minister] K. Papoulias and [Defense Minister] Ger. Arsenis. 
  Both the diplomats and the military agree on one important 
point: the implementation of the new defense doctrine is now a 
one-way street for Greece, in the sense that Greece has no more 
room for vacillation since the political, diplomatic and 
possibly military cost will be several times heavier than the 
potential benefits. Nicosia which welcomed enthusiastically the 
enunciation of the new military doctrine, is now concerned with 
mainly two issues: The first relates to the very philosophy of 
the doctrine itself since it implies the unified dealing with 
any threats on the entire national area. The appearance of a 
threat, however, will mean automatically a joint defense, 
something which the Cypriot leadership views with skepticism at 
this delicate phase of the Cypriot issue. The second concern of 
the Cypriots is related to the economy since the implementation 
of the doctrine automatically will involve added expenditures 
for the heavily burdened Cypriot economy, especially with the 
construction of defense infrastructure projects such as a naval 
yard, an airport and air defense equipment, as well as 
fortification projects, etc. This was the reason why certain 
Cypriot political parties had expressed some objections to the 
full implementation of the doctrine three months after its 
enunciation. 
  With the work done on the military plans all these problems 
appeared to be resolved since all now understand that (at this 
final stage of the issue) the doctrine is the way for a 
comprehensive reorganization of Cyprus' defense infrastructure, 
the quantitative and qualitative upgrading of the Cypriot 
National Guard, the reestablishment of secure communication 
channels, the development of training programs for the National 
Defense officers and for joint military exercises which are so 
useful for a coordinated defense. 
  All these, of course, take place on paper at this moment and 
no one knows --as reported by the military -- how they will be 
implemented in action and most importantly how it will be 
possible to rapidly deploy Greek forces on the island (in the 
event of a crisis) without at the same time weakening the Greek 
defense. 
  The Greek military staff officers believe that a serious 
crisis with Turkey in the future will not be limited to Cyprus.

    [Editorial Report] While Political Spring leader Andonis 
Samaras states he is mainly interested in attracting "the 
thousands of his anonymous supporters" since adherence to his 
party by well-known political figures is "natural," it would not 
be surprising if his longtime presence in the New Democracy (ND) 
resulted in a number of former and present ND deputies switching 
to his party, writes Dhimitris Kapranos in the 30 April-1 May 
Athens daily I KATHIMERINI. Nevertheless, a cautious Political 
Spring official cited by Kapranos warns that "switches" should 
not be expcted before the European Parliamentary elections, the 
results of which may "determine the fate of the big parties." At 
any rate, Political Spring aspires to doubling the 5-percent 
share of the vote it obtained in the last legislative elections. 
At the same time, Samaras' decision to vote in the Chamber of 
Deputies against the enlargement of the European Union has been 
much discussed, Kapranos continues. Samaras fears that 
enlargement without previous deepening will contribute to the 
creation of a weak European Union (EU) in which Germany will 
become a "European superpower" with ties to the Baltics, Poland, 
the Czech Republic, and other European countries, and which will 
be defined by German interests. Kapranos notes also that the 
Political Spring view of a "determined Greece possessing strong 
national characteristics" apparently has a deep resonance in 
public opinion.

  [Text] Ankara, May 18 (AFP)--Turkey on Wednesday [18 May] 
warned Iraqi Kurds against cooperating with Kurdish rebels after 
Turkish warplanes attacked a rebel base in north Iraq in the 
second such cross-border raid this year. 
  Foreign Ministry spokesman Ferhat Ataman said Turkey would 
not remain neutral if either of the two Kurdish movements in 
Iraq started cooperating with Turkey's separatist Kurdistan 
Workers Party (PKK). 
  Nineteen aircraft took part in Wednesday's raid and eight 
bombed the camp, 110 kilometres (70 miles) from the border and 
500 kilometers (310 miles) from airforce bases in east and 
southeast Turkey, according to military headquarters here. 
  All planes safely returned to base, but there was no 
immediate word on casualties. 
  A first cross-border air raid at the end of January was 
described by the military as their biggest air strike against 
the PKK rebels in the 10 years of the movement's separatist 
insurrection. 
  At the time military officials said the Zhalah base which 
was 
manned by 1,600 PKK rebels had been wiped out. 
  In a warning to Kurdish movements in Iraq Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Ferhat Ataman said Wednesday that Turkey had so far 
remained neutral in rows between Iraq's Democratic Party of 
Kurdistan and Jalal Talabani's Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. 
  "Should one of these two movements cooperate with the 
separatist organization (the PKK), it will no longer be able to 
continue this neutrality," he added. 
  Ankara suspects Talabani of tolerating and even fostering 
PKK 
activities in Iraqi Kurdistan and notably in areas under the 
control of Patriotic Union fighters, according to Kurdish 
sources in Ankara. 
  Ataman said Turkey was concerned about the instability in 
north Iraq but would stick to its non-interventionist policy. 
  Government officials meanwhile said 86 PKK fighters had been 
killed since Monday in security force operations in southeast 
Turkey, where Kurds are the majority of the population. 
  Officials enforcing emergency regulations in the region said 
a large amount of weapons had been captured. 
  The army has stepped up sweeps since the end of March in a 
major push to finish with the rebels once and for all, according 
to official briefings.

  [Text] Turkey has announced that if the citizens who went 
to northern Iraq because they were forced into it at gunpoint or 
intimidated into doing it by the terrorist organization want to 
come back, the necessary steps will be taken to resettle them 
safely. 
  Replying to a question during his weekly news conference, 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Ataman said that the citizens who 
went to northern Iraq in this way should see that they were 
tricked. A terrorist organization can promise nothing but blood 
and tears, he stressed, adding: Consequently, if they decide to 
return to their country, we will naturally open our arms to 
these citizens. There is no doubt that our state will do 
whatever it can to resettle these people and ensure their 
welfare.

  [Text] Ankara, May 18 (A.A.) -- Foreign Ministry spokesman 
Ferhat Ataman said today that Russia shared Turkey's concerns 
over the Iraq-Turkish pipeline and has expressed that it will 
support Ankara on the issue. 
  Ataman told his weekly press conference that during his 
contacts in Moscow last week, Ambassador Bilgin Unan conveyed 
Turkey's views on the oil pipeline, which has been shut since 
the Gulf war. 
  During his contacts, Unan told Russian officials that Turkey 
awaited Russia's understanding and support, in relation to 
measures foreseen to `save the pipeline', Ataman said. 
  Russian officials said that they shared Turkey's concerns 
and 
were supporting Turkey in this matter. 
  Turkey wants to drain the oil remaining in the pipeline 
since 
the U.N. imposed sanctions on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait 
and to repair the pipeline which is presently rotting away.

  [Text] Turkish Grand National Assembly speaker Husamettin 
Cindoruk has participated in the Parliamentary Assembly of Black 
Sea Economic Cooperation [PABSEC] meeting within the framework 
of his visit to Tbilisi, Georgia. Cindoruk also conducted some 
bilateral meetings. Ersin Kucukbarak reports from Tbilisi: 
  [Begin recording] [Kucukbarak] Cindoruk participated as the 
guest of honor at the opening of the PABSEC meeting where he is 
also the term president. In his opening speech, Cindoruk said 
that the Black Sea Economic Cooperation [BSEC] was an important 
step in blending all the cultures toward establishing a 
democratic and civilized world. Pointing out that increasingly 
borders were being eliminated, Cindoruk added that the view 
would dominate that worldly values can be shared by means of 
peace instead of war. 
  [Cindoruk] The aim of the PABSEC is not only regional. The 
joint economic and political cooperation achieved in the region 
will contribute to world peace, to peace in Europe and Asia. 
  [Kucukbarak] Cindoruk stated that the aim of the cooperation 
is to share democracies and wealth. Stressing that this has 
started to come true, Cindoruk noted that the steps taken two 
years ago have started to give fruit. 
  [Cindoruk] We, the people of this region, will protect our 
independence and our contemporary values by loving and 
understanding each other and by valuing a market which caters to 
more than 300 million persons. 
  [Kucukbarak] Georgian Head of State Eduard Shevardnadze, in 
turn, stated that cooperation is a must in the Black Sea region. 
Pointing out that the borders in the region are slowly being 
eliminated, Shevardnadze stated that this fact helps countries 
to approach each other. Zeki Naci Tarhan, the head of the BSEC 
legal and political committee, said that the PABSEC will 
contribute to regional peace and friendship. 
  Cindoruk later visited Vakhtang Goguadze, Georgia's Supreme 
Council speaker and deputy prime minister [title as heard]. 
During the meeting, Cindoruk said that although difficult, it is 
possible to protect democracy and added: We will realize that 
problems will lessen if we establish a joint political and 
economic power. 
  Goguadze, in turn, said that after its independence Georgia 
formed its best relations with Turkey and continued: The 
problems ended after the iron curtain between us was lifted. 
  Cindoruk later met with Georgian Prime Minister Otar 
Patsatsia. During the meeting, Cindoruk pointed out that the 
Sarp border gate was not sufficient and proposed the opening of 
two new border gates. Patsatsia, in turn, said that they want to 
cooperate in all areas, principally in the areas of energy, 
transportation, and communication. Patsatsia also stated that 
work was under way to open the new border gates. 
  Cindoruk later visited Tbilisi University where he received 
an honorary doctorate title. Cindoruk participated at a dinner 
given in his honor by Shevardnadze. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] President Suleyman Demirel has said that he has 
been loyal to democracy, the supremacy of the laws and the 
principles of a constitutional state since he assumed office on 
16 May, 1993. He added that during his one-year term in office 
he has also managed to put an end to the controversy regarding 
the presidential seat. Demirel noted that Turkey will 
definitely surmount the current difficulties within the 
framework of democracy and freedom, pointing out that the 
reconstruction of the country will continue. He added: No one 
should cast aside daily problems to engage in discussions 
concerning the regime. Demirel expressed his views on various 
issues at a news conference he held at the Cankaya Mansion on 
the first anniversary of his presidency. [passage omitted] 
  [Begin Demirel recording] Terror is one of Turkey's primary 
problems. Turkey's second problem is the current situation 
which started as a monetary crisis on 16 January and is 
gradually showing a tendency to become an economic crisis. 
There is the problem of inflation which we are trying to 
reduce, but we have not been able to succeed despite all 
efforts. On the one hand there is growing unemployment for 
various reasons and on the other the need for infrastructure. 
There is a need for reform. There is the problem of 
insufficient resources for investments. There is the problem of 
expanding the social security umbrella. There is the problem of 
distribution income and the problem of equalizing the 
development levels among various regions. There is also the 
problem of making the state function better. There is the 
problem of speeding up the judicial system. There is the 
problem of consolidating the democratization process. Then 
there is the problem of making the market economy function 
better. Finally, there is the issue of waging a struggle 
against irregularities and corruption. [end recording] 
  Demirel said that there are many pluses in the country 
together with the problems and cited the functioning democratic 
regime, the free parliamentary and judicial systems, the 
government which has received a vote of confidence, and the 
political parties as among the country's major assets. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Begin Demirel recording] When we begin to discuss the 
institutions instead of the issues, when we begin to discuss the 
political system instead of the economic problems, when we again 
begin to discuss the political system instead of the security 
issues, we destroy our trust in that political system. We then 
weaken the political system which is supposed to help us. 
Whatever the discussion it should remain within the boundaries 
of that particular issue. 
  Of course economizing is a most important issue. I would 
like to state, however, that bringing the state to a standstill 
for the sake of economizing is not a feasible measure. In other 
words, we may cause psychological damage. If the trust in the 
state is shaken then it would take much more than what has been 
economized to repair the damage. The trust in the state should, 
therefore, continue. The current situation in various parts of 
the country can be understandable for a while but this period 
should not continue for long. Investments have almost come to a 
standstill. A project such as the Southeastern Anatolian 
Project cannot come to a standstill. The same goes for similar 
big projects. [end recording] 
  Demirel later replied to reporters' questions on various 
issues. [passage omitted] 
  [Begin Demirel recording] The jump in the exchange rate of 
the U.S. dollar from 16,000 Turkish Lira [TL] to over TL20,000 
on 16 January 1994 cannot be explained away with what happened 
in the years 1993, 1992, and 1991. The Turkish currency is 
convertible. It has to be linked to something. There must be an 
explanation. There is a free market economy in Turkey. There is 
a free and fluctuating currency exchange rate within this 
system. There is a banking institution. We are experiencing 
inflation which is affecting the exchange rates, which in turn 
affect the interest rates. If one fails to regulate the 
association among the rate of inflation, the exchange rate, and 
the interest rates, then certain difficulties might arise. Now 
you ask if this is the reason? Yes it is. [end recording] 
  Demirel recalled that Turkey's budget deficit has been an 
issue for each government and said: If those who prepared the 
1994 budget thought that it could be prepared without first 
estimating the budget deficit and that their economic measure 
would be to assess the deficit within three to five months, then 
they should have done so within that time. Demirel further 
pointed out the burden of the interest rate was present in both 
the 1992 and 1993 budgets. 
  [Begin Demirel recording] If, after seven months -- that is, 
today -- or after eight, nine, 10, or 11 months, a government 
says that current difficulties are the result of the situation 
two or three years ago, this raises questions. If you claim 
that today's situation results from the fact that the necessary 
measures were not taken three years ago, then you should have 
done what is necessary the day after you established the 
government. Of course, that is only if these are the real 
reasons. I think this argument is meaningless. I have to 
clearly state that the government [word indistinct] [end 
recording] 
  Demirel said he has no arguments with anybody, is not 
responding to anybody, but is acting only in self-defense. 
  Demirel stated that during their meetings with him, the 
political party leaders had communicated their distrust of the 
existing political and bureaucratic cadres and that he, in turn, 
had communicated these views to the prime minister and to the 
deputy prime minister. 
  [Begin Demirel recording] Let us assume that the opposition, 
by virtue of being in the opposition, can only condemn the 
present government -- that is, oppose whatever government is in 
power. Yes, but it has a voice. What am I to do with this 
voice? Now I want to make my point: Government issues are not 
Cankaya's concern. Anybody who wants to establish a government 
or has complaints about the present government should address 
the Assembly. Let everybody know his place, speak correctly, 
and not try to implicate me in all kinds of things. [end 
recording] 
  In answer to a question on whether it had occurred to him 
that today's situation would be better if he were leader or 
prime minister, Demirel said that events propel him forward and 
not backward. Stressing that the presidency is a very honorable 
and important position, Demirel stated that he is happy with his 
post and is exerting every effort necessary to be of better 
service. Demirel said: If you believe that I left a void when I 
took this office, then you assume that I am indispensable. I am 
not indispensable. 
  Answering another question, which recalled the article in 
the 
Constitution that grants the Council of Ministers, headed by the 
president, the power to declare a state of emergency during 
difficult economic conditions and asked whether he would use 
this power, Demirel said: There are no hardships in the country 
despite the fact that a state of emergency has not been 
declared. If a law must be adopted, the Turkish Grand National 
Assembly adopts it. I do not think it necessary to declare a 
state of emergency, Demirel said. 
  In answer to another question, Demirel said that he has no 
disputes with the government or with its leader, but added that 
he cannot be indifferent to criticism of his term as prime 
minister. Demirel said: A charge was made. Whoever presents 
this charge will receive this reaction from me. I have also 
conveyed this to Mrs. Ciller. I presented an account of my 
500-day term in office in a news conference, such as this, in 
the presence of Mrs. Ciller. The account I submitted then was a 
good account, Demirel said. 
  Demirel noted that it is everybody's right to ask what 
economic measures were proposed and rejected during his term as 
prime minister. 
  [Begin Demirel recording] I have communicated these measures 
to the parties concerned on various occasions. I have told them 
that they were also members of the 500-day cabinet they are 
criticizing. I ask those who claim that they did not have the 
necessary authority during those 500 days whether they 
participated in that government unwillingly and also whether 
they were not aware of the word resignation. [end recording] 
  Demirel noted that joint responsibility is essential for a 
government.

  [Excerpts] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has stated that the 
government of the country is in control, and has called for an 
end to the arguments. Stressing that she will always make use 
of President Demirel's years of experience, Ciller stated that 
she and the president are in full accord and that nobody should 
be concerned about this issue. Ciller said: There are no 
disputes at the top of the state, and I will not permit any. 
  Demirel received Ciller at Cankaya Mansion and conferred 
with 
her for approximately one and a half hours. Ciller answered 
reporters' questions on various issues after her meeting with 
Demirel. 
  [Begin recording] [Ciller] I am not offended by Demirel. 
The president is a person for whom I have great respect. Our 
honorable president is at the top of the state, and there is no 
place for dispute. A very beneficial dialogue took place during 
the meeting. We assessed all the issues facing the country. We 
will continue to hold such meetings. We discussed various 
issues, from internal politics to foreign affairs and the 
economy. I have a very positive dialogue with the president. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] How do you interpret Demirel's 
news conference this morning and his criticism of you? 
  [Ciller] He has not informed me of any such criticism. He 
presented me with a summary of his news conference. I read it. 
I did not find any criticism there. I cannot comment on this 
issue, because I do not know the contents of the news 
conference. I repeat: There are no disputes at the top of the 
state. 
  [Correspondent] Did the president advise you on any issues? 
  [Ciller] He had various ideas and advice. There were issues 
to which I listened carefully. I would like to point out that 
this kind of dialogue has always existed between the president 
and myself. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] Do you still hold the view that the former 
government's mistakes play a role in the present economic crisis? 
  [Ciller] There are a series of problems which have existed 
since 1986. We cannot ignore those issues. I am determined in 
this view. My job is to find solutions, and that is what I am 
doing. Let there be no doubt that this country will emerge from 
this situation healthier than ever. We are going to reestablish 
the balance and, within a short time, everybody will notice the 
changes. I fully believe that the future of our country is 
bright. It has only been a month since we started to implement 
the measures. If it were possible to solve all these issues in 
one month, they would have been resolved in 1987. What the 
other governments could not do while they were the only ones in 
power, we are determined to achieve with a coalition government. 
The worst is over. We are going to start witnessing favorable 
developments. I must point out that once we emerge from this 
situation, the country will have achieved a balance that will 
enable us to compete with the most developed countries in the 
world. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] What do you think of the president's view 
that the life span of coalition governments is not long? 
  [Ciller] The coalition emerges from the Assembly. In the 
1991 elections, the people voted for a coalition. We are going 
to solve this issue in the Assembly. The regime will function. 
There will be important developments regarding the regime and 
democracy. Let nobody have arguments regarding the regime. Our 
democracy will also develop. We will continue with the 
coalition. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] The Council of Ministers has discussed the fight 
against terrorism and foreign policy issues. 
  The Council of Ministers met under Prime Minister Tansu 
Ciller for two and a half hours last night. In a statement 
after the meeting, Yildirim Aktuna, state minister and 
government spokesman, said that the interior minister briefed 
the Council of Ministers on the developments in the fight 
against terrorism. Aktuna pointed out that as a result of the 
determined attitude of the government regarding this issue, the 
terrorist organization incurred significant logistic [word 
indistinct] and personnel losses, especially during recent 
months. He pointed out that the morale of the separatist 
terrorist organization is very low, and consequently, increasing 
numbers of members are deserting the organization. 
  Aktuna charged that the terrorist organization is 
continuously avoiding a confrontation with the security forces 
and is suffering from a shortage of food, weapons, and 
ammunition. He said: Our security forces will continue to 
effectively carry out operations both inside the country and 
across our borders until such time as the separatist terrorist 
organization is completely eliminated. 
  Aktuna then said that the foreign minister briefed the 
Council of Ministers on the latest developments regarding the 
Cyprus and Azerbaijan issues. 
  Replying to a question, Aktuna stressed that the terrorist 
organization's efforts to force the citizens in the southeast to 
emigrate to northern Iraq are aimed at deceiving the world. The 
necessary measures have been taken in connection with this 
issue, he said. 
  Replying to another question, Aktuna said that the Council 
of 
Ministers did not discuss whether or not to extend the state of 
emergency.

  [Text] Ankara, May 18 (A.A.) -- Orhan Tasanlar was 
reinstated as Ankara security director today, after being 
removed following the roughing up of May Day celebrators and a 
deputy by the police on May 1. 
  After assuming his post in the morning, Tasanlar told the 
Anatolian Agency that Turkey was a state of law and everything 
took place before the public. 
  `The inspectors concluded their interrogation and could not 
find any element of crime against me,' he said. `There, the 
state was destroyed. What I regretted most was the fact that 
the police were injured and state vehicles were destroyed in the 
incidents which broke out on May Day and no one mentioned this.' 
  Interior Minister Nahit Mentese had removed Tasanlar from 
his 
position temporarily after calls from the government's junior 
coalition partner Social Democratic Populist Party (SHP) for an 
investigation into the charges of police brutality.

  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] Klaus Kinkel [FRG foreign 
minister] stated at the new conference [after the Geneva talks 
on Bosnia-Herzegovina] that "the tragedy" in Bosnia, with the 
killing, rapes, and the devastation of the country, is 
unfortunately still continuing. Although progress has recently 
been made -- for example, the settlements for Sarajevo and 
Gorazde and those for a Croat-Bosniak federation -- the 
situation is still "fragile." 
  Both Kinkel and [French Foreign Minister] Juppe stressed 
that 
many obstacles still have to be eliminated on the road to a 
peaceful solution. Before German journalists, Kinkel was 
reserved in his evaluation of the results of the negotiations. 
"I do not want to be seized with false euphoria, we have so 
often been disappointed." After his talks with President Yeltsin 
and [Russian Foreign Minister] Kozyrev, he hopes for Russian 
pressure. 
  Referring to the lifting of the arms embargo for the 
Muslims' 
benefit, which is recommended by the U.S. Senate, Kinkel said 
that "10 of the 12 states of the European Union [EU] have 
problems with the lifting of the arms embargo." Moreover, in 
the UN Security Council, Great Britain and France would vote 
against it. On Friday evening, Kinkel also met with Croatian 
Foreign Minister Mate Granic in Geneva. [passage omitted] 
  While the agreement that was negotiated between Croats and 
Muslims and centrally handled by the Americans in Vienna 
apparently started from 50 percent for these two groups, the 
circle of ministers in Geneva agreed on a ratio of 51 percent 
for the federation to 49 percent for the Serbs. Thus, it 
accepted the ratio that was put forward by the European Union as 
early as at the end of last year. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Bonn/Vienna (DPA) -- On Tuesday [17 May] the 
foreign ministers of Germany and the Netherlands, Klaus Kinkel 
and Pieter Kooijmans, took the first steps in Vienna to equip 
the CSCE with the right to clear majority decisions. The 
German-Dutch initiative presented to the Steering Committee of 
the 52-nation CSCE was published by the Foreign Ministry in Bonn 
and is addressed to the summit of the CSCE heads of state and 
government, which will be held in Budapest from 7 to 9 December. 
  Kinkel and Kooijmans demand from the December summit the 
right for the CSCE to call on the UN Security Council, to work 
out recommendations, and to support their implementation by the 
United Nations if necessary also without the approval of the 
affected or defendant members. The two ministers voiced the 
demand for a considerable strengthening of the position of the 
secretary general, which is currently occupied by German 
diplomat Wilhelm Hoeynck. In certain areas he is to be able to 
call for majority decisions and to initiate himself immediate 
measures in critical situations involving members, such as 
observer missions.

<F P=106> [Article signed OJE: "Belgium Passes Council of Europe </F>
Presidency to Bulgaria"] 
  [Text] Strasbourg, 11 May (BELGA) -- Wednesday [11 May] 
marked the end of the six-month Belgian presidency of the 
Council of Europe. The committee of ministers of the 
organization, which comprises 32 states, will be chaired by 
Bulgaria, the first country of Central and East Europe to head 
the Council. 
  Another important event was the signature by all of the 
organization's countries except Italy, because of the formation 
of its new government, of the protocol of the European 
Convention on Human Rights which set up a single court. 
Although the protocol has been signed by 31 states, the date 
when the court will be operational is not yet known. It is 
believed that it will not become operational until 1998 at the 
earliest, which is one year after all countries are expected to 
have ratified the protocol. 
  At a news conference, Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes 
recalled that Belgium had assumed the presidency of the Council 
of Europe and that of the European Union at the same time. He 
added: "There are still six weeks of troika ahead, and then we 
can have some rest." He said the 32 states had talked a lot 
about Russia's application for membership to the Council of 
Europe. 
  Stressing that the presence of foreign troops on the 
territory of a sovereign state against the will of the latter is 
contrary to the principles of the Council of Europe, Mr. Claes 
stated that as far as he is concerned and as long as he is a 
member of the committee of ministers of the Council of Europe, 
he will say "no" to Russia's membership if its troops remain 
stationed in countries against their will. 
  Questioned on the presence of neofascist ministers in the 
new 
Italian Government, Mr. Claes said he was convinced that "the 
emergence of individuals who have a nasty tendency to take away 
the freedom to think is a danger for the future of democracies." 
"I am not one of those who believe that electors cannot be 
wrong in a democratic state," he added. "All the European 
institutions will have to be very diligent in monitoring the 
application of democratic principles."

<F P=106> [Bruce Clark report: "UK Troops To Exercise in Poland"] </F>
  [Text] A company from the British army will today start a 
military exercise in Poland that is small in scale but large in 
political importance. It will be the first set of war games by 
British troops in a former Warsaw Pact country. 
  The four-day manoeuvre, which will focus on peace-keeping 
and 
involve 96 British soldiers, is one of the first concrete signs 
of the long-mooted military relationship between eastern and 
western Europe coming to life. 
  In a related move, Germany and the Netherlands yesterday 
announced an initiative to upgrade the powers of the 52-nation 
Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. 
  This initiative will be welcome in Moscow and could help to 
allay growing Russian concerns over ties between its former 
allies and members of NATO. 
  The German-Dutch proposals coincide with ideas mooted by 
President Boris Yeltsin during his visit to Germany last week, 
and they suggest that a tentative compromise is emerging over 
the extension eastwards of NATO. The proposals would give the 
CSCE the right to address the UN Security Council, and in some 
circumstances to intervene in conflicts without the agreement of 
the warring parties, in other words to impose a settlement. 
  According to a German foreign ministry statement, a decision 
by the CSCE to intervene in conflicts would be taken "by 
consensus." This could suggest something short of absolute 
unanimity among the CSCE's 52 members, which include the U.S., 
Canada, all European states and former-Soviet republics. 
  Moscow badly wants international approval for a de facto 
Russian sphere of influence in the Commonwealth of Independent 
States. The German-Dutch ideas say the CSCE should become 
involved in "peace-keeping" in the CIS, and in practice this is 
likely to refer mainly to Russian forces. 
  This week's Anglo-Polish exercise, in the Polish town of 
Kielce, has been arranged by London and Warsaw bilaterally, but 
is being billed by Britain as a project "in the spirit of" 
NATO's Partnership for Peace plan. 
  Poland has been the quickest of the former Warsaw Pact 
nations to build military ties with Western Europe, both 
bilaterally and in the context of Partnership for Peace.

  [Excerpts] Vienna, May 18 (AFP) -- UN nuclear inspectors 
who traveled to North Korea to determine if spent reactor fuel 
was diverted for bomb-making have begun their work, the 
International Atomic Energy Agency said Wednesday [18 May]. 
  A spokesman for the UN agency said the three inspectors had 
got down to their week-long assignment but he refused to provide 
details. 
  North Korea said over the weekend that it had already begun 
replacing spent fuel rods from a reactor at Yongbyon, 90 
kilometers (54 miles) north of Pyongyang. 
  The inspectors are pressing to check the rods to see if 
fissile material has been diverted to make a nuclear weapon. 
  North Korea denies having a nuclear weapons program. 
[passage 
omitted] 
  The IAEA says the operation could take a few months.

<F P=106> [Interview with Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene by </F>
Francoise Crouigneau, Jacques Decquiert, and Jean-Michel Lamy; 
place and date not given: "Jean-Luc Dehaene: `Belgium Is a 
Forerunner as Far as Federal Matters Are Concerned'"] 
  [Text] As the leader of a center-right coalition, the 
Belgian prime minister is no stranger to compromise, whether it 
is a matter of following the line of decisionmaking within his 
political family or looking for a new balance within the new 
federal system. In Belgium, the regions and the communities 
actually have real powers. The essential thing is to manage to 
run the government efficiently. 
  This constraint -- or this ambition -- is exactly the same 
as 
that involved in organizing Europe. This head of government is 
so convinced of this that most of the diplomats are saying that 
he will succeed Jacques Delors at the head of the European 
Commission. Officially, he is not a candidate. However, he is 
the favorite of France and Germany. His vision of Europe is one 
of a pragmatic government which takes action to correct extreme 
diversity via carefully identified unifying elements. 
  [LES ECHOS] You played a major role in the rise of Belgian 
federalism. How does a prime minister, a man of power, judge 
its strengths and weaknesses? 
  [Dehaene] For 15 years I was very closely involved in the 
reform of the Belgian state, convinced that we could develop a 
policy which was more in line with the particular features of 
each region and community. This process began in the seventies, 
after the preliminary implementation of a number of language 
laws. The options for an eventual Belgian federation were then 
potentially integrated. Our success was due to the stages we 
undertook. In 1970, we created separate Parliaments comprising 
national members of Parliament who had two separate duties. In 
1980, we set up regional and community governments with their 
own administrations and budgets. Initially, they were put 
together within the context of national power. In 1988, the new 
phase transferred many more powers and resources to the regions 
and communities. As of the next elections, this will be the 
final phase: Each region or community will have its own 
Parliament. 
  In 20 years, we have moved from a unitary system to a 
federal 
organization, as used in Switzerland, Germany, and the United 
States. We did this through political agreements passed with 
special majorities, and this never led to any bloody fighting. 
I am convinced that this is an evolution which will eventually 
be achieved in several European countries. 
  In Spain, there are 16 different regions having differing 
powers. Italy is debating the same issues now that it is forming 
a government. In Germany, the Laender are asking for more 
powers. All this is not just the mere application of the 
principle of subsidiarity. I never saw this better expressed 
than at the Edinburgh summit, where the issue was to avoid too 
much centralization at European level. As European unity grows, 
there is a need for a stronger link with the basic identity and 
a search for ones roots. In many countries, this is the nation. 
However, in several countries, the nation concept was born in 
the 19th century by driving back deeper fundamental links that 
will now have to be reassessed. To use a cliche, we need unity 
in diversity. 
  Europe needs unity to get the most out of its own potential 
capacities, while at the same time avoiding to become a uniform 
melting pot. Belgium is a forerunner as far as federal matters 
are concerned. Sublimating diversity necessarily implies forms 
of nationalism which will lead to racism if there is no European 
unity to counterbalance this tendency. The Yugoslav crisis is 
exactly that. 
  [LES ECHOS] Can one imagine a federal Europe which even the 
French and British find satisfactory? 
  [Dehaene] I am wary of labels. I think that Europe must be 
given a structure while at the same time avoiding the struggle 
for labels. In certain strategic areas there must be enough 
coherence for Europe to operate as it is. I am convinced that 
we never would have reached a GATT agreement if trade issues had 
not been defined, since the time of the Treaty of Rome, as 
falling within the authority of the Community. If the Twelve 
had negotiated separately, we never could have concluded the 
negotiations. We must therefore put the authority at the level 
where it should be. In certain cases, the national or regional 
dimension is more efficient. 
  [LES ECHOS] Over the past few years, has too much priority 
been given to harmonization? 
  [Dehaene] Europe has fallen somewhat victim to the process 
of 
building up the single market; "1992" was a major factor in 
anticipatory economic dynamics. With the recession, the good 
times collapsed in an even more visible manner. It must be 
stressed that the Single Act called for an increase in the 
number of directives, something which will never be repeated. 
These European laws were often implemented in an overly 
detailed and overly centralist manner. Most of the time, this 
was not the fault of the Commission, but was the result of 
demands made by certain countries which wanted to safeguard 
national interests. Afterwards, it is easy to poke fun at it. 
However, this centralism does not spring from the wishes of the 
European bodies. 
  [LES ECHOS] In the future will you be favorable toward 
strengthening the system of European Union [EU] preferences? 
  [Dehaene] In the context of GATT, we reached certain 
agreements on this matter within the EU. We have to be able to 
successfully eliminate elements of social and environmental 
dumping. The constitution of the World Trade Organization (WTO) 
is an important factor in regulation. The EU must play an 
active role. We cannot deny it certain protectionist tools 
which others might be using as well. 
  [LES ECHOS] How do you view France's attitude during these 
trade negotiations? 
  [Dehaene] The French position contributed a number of 
factors 
to the EU strategy. France played an important role on the 
cultural clause, which was adopted on its behalf by the EC. 
Conversely, Paris was forced into positions which, in the long 
term, seem to me to be easier to defend. The situation would 
have been different if France had operated on its own. All in 
all, the outcome was better. 
  [LES ECHOS] Should not the member states be given back their 
role with respect to the Commission? Where does the right 
institutional balance lie? 
  [Dehaene] This debate will be at the heart of the 
intergovernmental conference to be held in 1996 on the reform of 
the institutions. It will take a lot of creativity to find a 
balance between the various approaches. There is a tendency to 
mix them up. Some are using the enlargement process as an excuse 
to demand more decisionmaking powers for large countries, while 
at the same time pleading for an intergovernmental approach to 
Europe. Now, this would imply equality between all the 
governments. Clarification is needed. Subsidiarity requires 
one to know the different approaches one wants in different 
areas. If we take the example of trade policy, the element of 
control lies more at the level of the European Parliament and 
the Commission, with a specific role for the Council of 
Ministers. When the intergovernmental aspect dominates, then it 
is the Council of Ministers which takes precedence. 
  The principle of subsidiarity makes it possible to move 
forward. In this respect, and with all its weaknesses, the 
Maastricht Treaty represents progress. Especially if we look at 
it in terms of a dynamic process. 
  [LES ECHOS] Does this concept not imply at least an element 
of arbitration, if not the elaboration of a Constitution? 
  [Dehaene] One of the challenges of the years to come is to 
guarantee this European dynamism by being pragmatic enough to 
take into account the way in which reality develops. It is 
clear that such dynamism was evident at one stage. It is also 
clear that for the time being, in public opinion practically 
everywhere, there is at least skepticism and, even in some 
places, a tendency to fold back on oneself: Supposedly Europe 
no longer has the meaning it had following the end of the Cold 
War. Admittedly, the environment is different, but then the 
Community was not a product of the Cold War. And outside the EU, 
there is tremendous hope. Maybe these outside hopes are 
excessive, but maybe the internal disappointments are also 
excessive. We must ponder this paradox of a certain tendency to 
once again call into question this dynamism at a time when the 
European element needs strengthening. 
  [LES ECHOS] This skepticism on the part of Europeans is a 
product of concern about rising unemployment, in particular. 
What do you consider to be the most interesting aspect of the 
White Paper in terms of creating jobs? 
  [Dehaene] The merit of the White Paper is that it created a 
framework of reference for organizing the labor market. Some 
elements are common to all countries: There is a structural 
unemployment problem, which is characteristic of Europe. In 
Belgium, the "global plan for employment and competitiveness" is 
a specific application of the chapter on employment in the White 
Paper. We have introduced reforms along the lines of what is 
happening virtually everywhere in Europe. We must be able to 
achieve this transformation of the labor market in a manner that 
avoids calling the European model into question once again. In 
most countries of the Community, social security is funded to an 
excessive extent by taxes on employment, by increasing wage 
costs and, above all, the gap between gross and net salaries. 
The issue can only be resolved by completely "unraveling" the 
system providing social protection. Consequently, we must seek 
alternative sources of financing. However, this choice could 
lead to distortions if it is done separately in all the member 
states. Taking up one of the ideas contained in the White 
Paper, we should use new sources of financing, such as taxes on 
carbon dioxide emissions. I am in favor of this provided that 
the fiscal pressure on companies is not increased. A change 
must be made in the way social security is financed, while the 
tax burden on an overabundant factor, employment, should be 
relieved in return. 
  [LES ECHOS] How do you view the dynamics of the present 
enlargement? 
  [Dehaene] We should have deepened the Community before 
enlarging it. However, the compromise agreed in Lisbon in June 
1992 opened up the way for negotiations with the four candidate 
countries, before any deepening could take place. This enabled 
us to break the impasse concerning ratification of the 
Maastricht Treaty, which was blocked at the time. It is rather 
facile to go over the discussion again today without taking 
account of the context. 
  Why this prejudice claiming that the four new member states 
will weaken European dynamism? I have noted a political will on 
their part that goes beyond mere participation in the single 
market. In other bodies they play the institutional game to the 
best of their ability. They must be given their chance. 
  As for Eastern Europe, we should probably proceed with 
political cooperation at a swifter pace. Association with 
Western Europe is important. The agreements concluded in the 
economic sector are also important. However, for the moment, it 
is premature to set any date. On the other hand, we must 
establish a timetable and define its stages. 
  [LES ECHOS] In Belgium, as in France, there are those who 
criticize the strong monetary policy and its rigor. Do you 
still believe that you will manage to respect the convergence 
criteria laid down in the Maastricht Treaty? 
  [Dehaene] If we do not manage to achieve monetary union, 
then 
sooner or later the single market will be rendered unsound. 
Devaluation can perhaps be used as a competitive tool only once; 
using it two or three times is untenable. In order to keep its 
place in the world, Europe needs the single market. The path 
mapped out at Maastricht is the only way forward. I am 
convinced that the decision on the single currency will be 
political, and not purely mechanical. Just look at the example 
of the union of the eastern and western German mark. If Helmut 
Kohl had taken a gradual approach, Germany would definitely not 
have become unified. I am aware that the policy of monetary 
stability that Europe has chosen is not an easy option, but it 
is the only road that will provide us with a healthy structural 
base. The other path would put us to sleep and lead, sooner or 
later, to a painful awakening.

<F P=106> ["eli/ub." report: "Foreign Ministry for Bundeswehr Mission </F>
in Rwanda; Defense Ministry Thinks Situation Is Too Dangerous"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- Within the FRG Government, a new 
controversy over the dispatch of soldiers to a region outside 
the NATO area is imminent. The Foreign Ministry and the Defense 
Ministry take different views on whether one should comply with 
a UN request for the dispatch of German blue helmets to Rwanda. 
They would mainly be medical soldiers. Last week, the FRG 
Government received a relevant inquiry from Kofi Annan, UN 
undersecretary general for blue-helmet issues. While the 
Foreign Ministry is advocating participation in humanitarian 
actions, the Hardthoehe [Defense Ministry] and the Chancellor's 
Office reacted reservedly. 
  On Tuesday [17 May] evening, FRG Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel (Free Democratic Party of Germany) and Defense Minister 
Volker Ruehe (Christian Democratic Union) agreed for the time 
being only on the dispatch of an Air Force Transall transport 
aircraft to the country shaken by civil war. In this way, they 
reacted to a request of the United Nations, which urgently needs 
a replacement for a defective Canadian plane. However, before 
the dispatch of the Transall, the hazards of the situation are 
to be analyzed. So far, the Canadians have flown relief flights 
throughout Rwanda as well as to the capital, Kigali. 
  Apparently, the ministers have not yet discussed in detail 
the inquiry from the under secretary general of 12 May. It not 
only asks for the dispatch of an Air Force transport unit, but 
also for a medical contingent. Apparently, the United Nations 
is thinking of participation similar to that in Cambodia, where 
the Bundeswehr operated a hospital. Since the mission in 
Somalia, the armed forces have also been in possession of a 
field hospital. In the inquiry the dispatch of 50 armored 
personnel carriers is also requested. Thus, the Bundeswehr 
would be able to take care of refugees and to attend to a large 
number of injured people. After the positive decision on the 
dispatch of the Transall aircraft, it was stated in the 
Chancellor's Office that it has to be carefully examined whether 
the employment of medics is also possible. 
  On Monday, the Security Council decided to increase the UN 
contingent in Rwanda to 5,500 men. Three African states -- 
Ghana, Tanzania, and Nigeria -- already want to provide 
contingents. The United Nations knows from its experience in 
Somalia that only armed forces with a highly sophisticated 
technology come into consideration for transportation, supplies, 
and medical help. Thus, the African states depend on help. 
  In the Foreign Ministry, participation in the support for 
humanitarian aid is advocated. However, details have not yet 
been discussed. Foreign Minister Kinkel talked of the 
inconceivable figure of 500,000 murdered people. This is a 
tragedy of an unimagined dimension. In its rather positive 
attitude, the Foreign Ministry also seems to be guided by the 
consideration that the FRG, as a candidate for a permanent seat 
on the Security Council, must not shirk from helping. 
Apparently, however, there is no intention to make an offer 
overeagerly either. A quiet environment is important as the 
prerequisite for a mission, it was stated. 
  Kinkel said that he is personally in favor of helping 
Rwanda. 
Genocide is taking place there. According to his assessment, 
however, "boundless disappointment" is prevailing in the states 
that might intervene in Rwanda. The outcome of the mission in 
Somalia and the helplessness of Europe and the world in 
Yugoslavia are depressing. He is noticing "immense caution" 
everywhere. 
  The Hardthoehe, however, reacted to the inquiry with great 
reserve. Defense Minister Volker Ruehe stressed again and again 
that he rules out another UN mission before the judgment of the 
Constitutional Court on the "out-of-area" missions. Military 
circles also point out that the Bundeswehr is overtaxed 
regarding materiel and staff. Moreover, German interests cannot 
be perceived in a mission in Rwanda, since the military 
situation is confused and therefore dangerous. For every 
medical soldier, three paratroopers are needed as protection. 
Their dispatch results in endless unclarified questions that 
already caused great difficulties for the coalition before 
Somalia or the AWACS mission over former Yugoslavia. After all, 
one does not exactly notice any pressure from the United 
Nations. Rather, the excitement is homemade, it was stated.

  [Text] Bosnia: Edouard Balladur has announced the partial 
withdrawal of the peacekeeping troops from former Yugoslavia. 
The withdrawal from Bihac will take place in six months. As 
for the destination of this contingent, France will decide on 
what action to take, depending on the progress of the peace 
process. Edouard Balladur was speaking in the National Assembly: 
  [Begin Balladur recording] Things are clear, ladies and 
gentlemen, we are at the service of the United Nations and at 
the service of a policy aimed at restoring peace. If this 
restoration of peace were to prove impossible, if the other 
powers were not working toward this end, then, as I said last 
week, we should be forced to ask ourselves questions about the 
meaning and duration of our action. We do not have to blush; 
quite the contrary, we can be proud of what we have done, and of 
what we are continuing to do. We have the largest number of 
soldiers -- by a long way -- at the service of peace on the 
territory of former Yugoslavia. We are quite prepared to 
continue with our efforts, on condition that every party is 
willing to make its own contribution. [end recording]

  [Text] Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's 
alternate special representative in Cyprus, held a meeting with 
Rauf Denktas in the occupied areas this afternoon. A statement 
Mr. Feissel made after the meeting indicated that again today 
Denktas did not give a positive reply on the implementation of 
the confidence-building measures. Mr. Feissel said that he and 
Denktas reviewed the Vienna meetings as well as the current 
state of affairs in the Cyprus issue. 
  Mr. Feissel further noted: I told Mr. Denktas that the 
preparation of the UN secretary general's report is in progress. 
He also said that he has sent material that will help the 
secretary general to prepare the report which, as Mr. Feissel 
noted, should be issued in mid-April. Mr. Feissel added that he 
will keep in touch with Rauf Dentkas. Responding to a question, 
he said that he is not going to send any more material to New 
York on the current situation. 
  Asked whether there was progress in Vienna--as Denktas, 
Ulucevik, and Madden had maintained in their statements--Mr. 
Feissel said: What is important is not progress or whether 
progress was made in Vienna but achieving agreement on the 
confidence-building measures package. This is what we worked 
for and this is our goal, because we will either reach an 
agreement or fail. Responding to another question, he said that 
again today there was no agreement, adding that today they and 
Rauf Denktas discussed many aspects of the packet, which he 
described as useful. He further noted that the secretary 
general's report will be ready by next week. He said that 
Denktas asked that they keep in touch, and added that until the 
secretary general issues his report Denktas has an opportunity 
to give a positive reply.

  [Text] The Foreign Ministry is insisting on serious 
preparations for the Greek-Albanian meeting. It is also 
proposing a substantive preliminary meeting between the 
officials who are in charge of preparations for the meeting of 
the two foreign ministers. 
  Acting on instructions from the Foreign Ministry, Greek 
Ambassador in Tirana Khristodhoulos Tsalikis conveyed this 
"issue" to Albanian Deputy Foreign Minister Arjan Starova. 
  The Greek side insists on all questions and decisions being 
raised before the meeting, which is anticipated to be held 
before the end of July, so the two ministers will be in a 
position to "close" the differences. 
  According to the Greek proposal, these meetings could be 
held 
at the border-crossing of Kakavia, alternatively on Greek and 
Albanian territory.

  [Text] Vienna, May 19 (AFP) -- IAEA [International Atomic 
Energy Agency] inspectors in North Korea to find out if that 
country is making nuclear weapons, have visited an experimental 
reactor and a radiochemical laboratory at the Yongbyon nuclear 
complex and will continue their inspection Friday [20 May], an 
IAEA spokesman said Thursday. 
  Hans-Friedrich Meyer would not comment on a report by THE 
WASHINGTON POST that the reclusive Stalinist country had begun 
removing spent fuel rods from the reactor at the Yongbyon 
nuclear complex in defiance of international warnings not to do 
so. 
  The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) receives daily 
reports from the inspectors, he said, adding that IAEA member 
countries were kept informed "in confidence" about what was in 
the reports. 
  He said the inspectors were tasked only with maintenance 
work 
consisting in verifying seals placed on the reactor and 
replacing films and batteries in cameras monitoring the nuclear 
site. 
  The United Nations and the United States have warned 
Pyongyang not to remove the fuel rods before the IAEA inspectors 
can check them to see if fissile material has been diverted to 
make a nuclear weapon. 
  For this purpose they will also take samples in the 
radiochemical lab. 
  Sources familiar with a preliminary report filed by the IAEA 
team had told the POST that defueling at the Yongbyon reactor, 
90 kilometers (54 miles) north of Pyongyang, was in its early 
stage, meaning that only a small portion of the estimated 8,000 
plutonium- laden fuel rods had been removed. 
  North Korea's continued refusal to abide by the IAEA's non- 
proliferation rules has led to international threats of UN 
sanctions, which in turn prompted war threats from Pyongyang. 
  U.S. Defense Secretary, William Perry, said Wednesday that 
his government faced "a very substantial near-term crisis" with 
North Korea.

  [Text] Copenhagen, May 19 (AFP) -- Denmark has protested to 
the United Nations about a refusal to provide close air support 
for the Nordic battalion under attack by Bosnian Serbs at Tuzla 
Airport this week, Defence Minister Hans Haekkerup said here 
Thursday [19 May]. 
  Ritzau news agency said he complained about "excuses and 
reservations" among the UN Protection Force command in Bosnia 
which had occurred many times in recent months. 
  "It is not for the fun of it that the Danish commanding 
officer on the ground asks for NATO planes to intervene," 
Haekkerup said. "He is within his rights to have that backing 
when the life of his soldiers is in danger." 
  The minister announced the protest after the head of 
parliament's foreign affairs committee Peter Duetoft called for 
such a move to protest lack of protection for the UN force's 
Nordic contingents.

  [Text] Vienna, May 20 (AFP) -- A conference to launch the 
rebuilding of Sarajevo's infrastructure and public services 
called by special UN envoy Yasushi Akashi is to be held here 
next week, the UN office in the Austrian capital said on Friday 
[20 May]. 
  The two-day gathering, opening on Tuesday, is billed as a 
conference to coordinate an action plan for the besieged Bosnian 
capital. The aim is to mobilise widespread support for 
restoring the battered city. An appeal for funds is to be made 
immediately after the meeting, with another conference due in 
New York within a few months to finalise matters. 
  The Vienna meeting is being chaired by U.S. diplomat William 
Eagleton, named in March as UN civilian administrator for 
Sarajevo. Participants are to include 31 countries, UN and other 
international bodies, non-governmental organisations and 
municipal associations.

<F P=106> [Report by Guenter Schmidt from Brussels] </F>
  [Text] Chancellor Franz Vranitzky is currently in Brussels, 
where he has met with EU Commission President Jacques Delors and 
other Commission members. They agreed that the EU summit in 
Corfu should discuss the railroad line through the Brenner Pass. 
According to Jacques Delors, the project stands a good chance 
of being financed by the EU. Following the talks, Vranitzky met 
the international press. He declined to answer questions about 
Austria's ideas on the next institutional reform, or who should 
succeed Jacques Delors as Commission president. He said he 
would not comment on such matters before Austria was a member. 
  Other questions focused on Austria's security policy 
concept. 
Vranitzky said Austria had expressed its interest in helping set 
up a European security system. Asked about the country's 
possible membership of the Western European Union, the WEU, or 
its participation in the Partnership for Peace program, 
Vranitzky said that these were not urgent problems. 
  Regarding the WEU, Austria did not rule out a role as an 
observer, the chancellor said. Time was not pressing, because 
the 12 EU member states themselves still held differing views on 
the future of the WEU, which, according to the Maastricht 
Treaties, will become the WEU's defense arm. 
  Regarding Partnership for Peace with NATO, for which most 
Eastern European countries and recently also Sweden and Finland 
have opted, Chancellor Vranitzky said that Austria would closely 
examine the matter in the second half of this year. Such an 
examination could be made without any hurry; after all, Austria 
has concluded similar peace-preserving agreements with its 
Eastern European neighbors. Neutrality was no obstacle to such 
partnership, because it was not a military alliance, the 
chancellor said.

<F P=106> [By Sian Clare, Ian Graham, Chris Parkin, Alison Little, PA </F>
News] 
  [Text] A referendum would be held in Northern Ireland to 
discover the views of the people over their future, the British 
Government said today. 
  In response to 20 questions posed by Sinn Fein on the 
Downing 
Street peace declaration, the Northern Ireland Office issued a 
statement saying the wishes of the greater number of people in 
Ulster would be determined in a special poll. 
  The Government also drove home its message to the terrorists 
to give up violence. 
  The statement bluntly told Sinn Fein to stop "playing for 
time" and that democracy and violence cannot be reconciled. 
  The Government regards only one of the 20 questions put by 
Sinn Fein as involving an explanation of the text of the Joint 
Declaration. 
  In the declaration, the Government had said they would 
"uphold the democratic wishes of a greater number of the people 
of Northern Ireland." 
  Sinn Fein challenges the Government over the precise 
definition of this phrase and asks how it would be measured in 
practical terms. 
  The Government's comment is: "The wish of a greater number 
of 
the people of Northern Ireland would be determined by a 
numerical majority of those validly voting in a poll fairly and 
explicitly organised for this purpose. 
  "Provision for such a poll is made in Section 1 of the 
Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973." 
  In comments on the other questions, the Government 
frequently 
refers Sinn Fein to the text of the Joint Declaration, quoting 
large chunks. 
  At the end, the Government poses its own question for Sinn 
Fein, urging them to renounce violence in accordance with the 
wishes of the people of Northern Ireland. 
  "Democracy and violence cannot be reconciled. Sinn Fein must 
choose. They know what they have to do if they are effectively 
to fulfil their democratic mandate. 
  "The democratic path leads to a meaningful role in the 
political process: a process in which, as has been explained, 
all issues are open for discussion and negotiation. 
  "The alternative is isolation -- standing on the outside 
while those committed to democracy shape the agreement, 
structures and institutions that will determine the 
relationships between the peoples of these islands." 
  The Government says the majority of people in Ireland want 
an 
end to violence now. 
  "Their wishes could not be clearer. There is no conceivable 
justification for continuing to rob people of their lives, least 
of all a call for a textual explanation of the Joint 
Declaration," the statement says. 
  "Sinn Fein asks what comes next. Certainly no further 
playing for time," it warns. 
  Sinn Fein's questions were sent to the Northern Ireland 
Office through the Irish Government. 
  Final agreement on the British Government's response was 
reached at a Cabinet sub-committee meeting today. 
  Elsewhere in its commentary on the questions, the Government 
makes clear that acceptance of the Joint Declaration is not a 
precondition for entering the talks process. 
  "What is required is a permanent end to the use of, or 
support of, paramilitary violence," the statement says. 
  The British Government says it "accepts the validity of all 
electoral mandates, including that of Sinn Fein." 
  It runs through what would happen if Sinn Fein and the IRA 
renounced violence, saying exploratory talks would take place 
after a three-month lapse. 
  These talks would explore the basis on which Sinn Fein would 
be admitted to the peace process but without anticipating the 
negotiations within that process. 
  There would also be an exchange of views on how Sinn Fein 
would be able eventually to play the same part in the public 
life of Northern Ireland as current constitutional parties. 
  The talks would examine the practical consequences of the 
ending of violence. 
  The statement also makes clear: "A lasting and general peace 
would render military operations in support of the police no 
longer necessary." 
  Sinn Fein said tonight that they would examine the answers 
they had received to see if they provided the clarification they 
required. 
  Mitchel McLaughlin, Sinn Fein party chairman, said: "Clarity 
on the issues we have identified is in everyone's interest and 
is crucial to the development of a viable peace process. 
  "The response from the British Government can only assist in 
the development of such a peace process if it provides direct, 
unambiguous and comprehensive answers to the 20 questions we 
have asked." 
  He added: "We will therefore be examining the British 
response to see if it provides the clarification which we 
require to make a properly informed assessment of the Downing 
Street Declaration." 
  Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams was today on the first of a 
five-day trip to Italy. Sinn Fein said it would be faxing a 
copy of the response to him. 
  It was thought unlikely he would make an off-the-cuff reply 
before returning to Northern Ireland next week for consultations 
with party leaders. 
  In its response the Government tells Sinn Fein that no 
organisation has a veto over the peace process "whether by 
withdrawing from it or by refusing to renounce violence." 
  It adds: "An end to violence would open the way for a 
comprehensive reassessment of existing provisions against 
terrorism, many of which would become irrelevant and obsolete in 
a climate of peace." 
  Sinn Fein's questions probe a wide range of issues 
surrounding the Joint Declaration, many of which the Government 
responds to merely by quoting the document's text. 
  Only one of the 20 questions submitted to the Government by 
Sinn Fein was genuinely seeking clarification of the Downing 
Street declaration, Ulster Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew 
indicated tonight. 
  He said: "The rest of them are invitations to negotiate. We 
are not going to negotiate. That is made very clear." 
  Sir Patrick said on the BBC Six O'Clock News before the 
Government had published the questions and its commentary on 
them: "We are facing something of great seriousness. We are 
facing the continuance of violence for political purposes." 
  He insisted that the future of Northern Ireland would be 
decided "by consent and democracy and not by violence or 
coercion."

  [Excerpts] Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds tonight 
welcomed Britain's response to Sinn Fein's clarification request. 
  He saw the document as comprehensive and positive and 
believed it should enable the Ulster peace process to move 
forward. The onus for creating peace in Northern Ireland was 
firmly back with Sinn Fein and their IRA allies. 
  Deputy premier Dick Spring said: "I welcome this document -- 
and Sinn Fein should, too. It has to potential to end the 
logjam to the peace process thrown up by clarification. 
  "There is a great deal of explanation that should be helpful 
to Sinn Fein, and others as well. 
  "I would hope that it provides that clarification that was 
expected, and that the same consideration the British Government 
gave the issue will now be given by Sinn Fein as quickly as 
possible." He described the document as "a very serious 
attempt...to answer the Sinn Fein questions." He went on: "The 
leadership of Sinn Fein said they wanted matters clarified. 
That challenge was taken up by the British Government. Matters 
have now been clarified and that should put at end to that 
particular debate." Mr Spring stressed the British reply did 
not amount to a negotation of the peace declaration. 
  A source close to the Reynolds government said: "It is now 
up 
to Sinn Fein to decide what to do -- they have a choice. 
  "They can decide to enter into the political process on the 
basis of the peace declaration -- or continue with the 
violence." [passage omitted] 
  Ulster Unionist leader James Molyneaux said there was now no 
excuse for the IRA to continue its campaign of violence. He 
said the Government had to refute the allegations and innuendoes 
which had been raised by the questions from Mr Adams. There 
was now "no room, no excuse, no justification for violence and 
there is no need for any further clarification." But he did not 
think it would clear up the issue of clarification in the mind 
of the Sinn Fein president. "He will go on rabbiting on until 
he devalues that device just as he has devalued the phoney 
ceasefire. 
  "He now has run his course, he will not now be able to say 
to 
America or any other nation that he is in any sort of puzzlement 
or any misunderstanding about what was meant -- he has got it 
all set out there. 
  "I think it is a very good thing that the Government refuted 
and rebutted all the monstrous assertions which appeared in Mr 
Adams' paper because if that not been done it would have given 
encouragement to republican terrorists and would have made the 
law abiding people of Northern Ireland uneasy. Now it has all 
been cleared up." 
  The Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist 
Party, was outraged at the response. 
  He said the Government had produced a 14 paragraph 
declaration and now a 20-page clarification. 
  "The thing is not finished at all. It means the British 
Government has been in cahoots with Dublin while Dublin is in 
cahoots with the murderers." And he accused the Government of 
"lying through its teeth" about a border poll. It was only a 
"red herring" which he claimed would be held only if it ran 
concurrently with one in the Irish Republic. 
  Mark Dirkin, chairman of the nationalist Social Democratic 
and Labour Party said: "I would hope that people would find no 
more need for clarification. I hope they come to that 
conclusion by reading the paragraphs provided by the British 
Government today." 
  He said the SDLP [Social Democratic Labor Party] had always 
encouraged Sinn Fein to accept the Downing Street Declaration 
and continued to do so. [passage omitted] 
  Kevin McNamara, the shadow Northern Ireland Secretary, said: 
"The Labour Party for some time has called on Sinn Fein to 
specify points of clarification and for the British Government 
then to respond to such points." 
  "Sinn Fein can no longer use clarification as an excuse to 
prolong their support for and justification of the use of 
violence for political ends. 
  "Sinn Fein must now renounce the use of force and enter 
political negotiations to seek a just and lasting settlement on 
the basis of Irish self determination as specificed in the 
Downing Street declaration." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Martin S. Lambeck report: "Secret Paper: Poland's Offer </F>
to NATO"] 
  [Text] Brussels/Bonn -- Poland is prepared to render 
unusual services to become a full NATO member as quickly as 
possible. This is shown by a secret presentation document of 
the Polish Republic that is known to DIE WELT. The paper, which 
serves as the document for NATO's Partnership for Peace program, 
is to be presented to the NATO defense ministers in Brussels 
next week. In Brussels it is stated that Poland is pressing for 
full membership because the developments in Russia are viewed 
with increasing concern in Warsaw. 
  Full membership of NATO would mean that Poland is protected 
by the alliance in the case of an attack. The document says 
literally: "Poland is determined to gain full NATO membership. 
The Polish Government regards the partnership initiative as a 
step that takes us closer to this objective." Poland wants full 
military integration within the alliance. Here the democratic 
control of the armed forces will be ensured. The Polish 
officers are already being prepared for the NATO language, 
English. 
  In the overall field of the command and control system, 
military intelligence, and communications, Poland is seeking 
speedy cooperation with NATO. The telecommunications systems 
are to be converted to the NATO standard. A permanent data 
exchange is offered. NATO norms and terms are to be introduced 
in the Polish armed forces. The Poles not only expect 
integration within NATO air defense, but they also ask for help 
in reequipment. 
  Warsaw wants to establish a Polish representation at the 
NATO 
headquarters in Mons. The Poles are offering training areas for 
international contingents. For UN peace missions, Poland wants 
to provide units that would be operationally ready within 30 
days. A unit of about 1,000 men is envisaged. 
  Moreover, Warsaw is planning several joint maneuvers, 
including: a Polish-U.S. paratrooper exercise; Polish-U.S. Air 
Force maneuvers with combat aircraft in Poland; joint exercises 
on German training areas; joint infantry exercises with German 
and Danish units in Denmark; and numerous naval exercises with 
German, Dutch, and Danish naval units are planned. In addition, 
Poland is planning joint exercises with Belgium, France, and 
Great Britain. Over the long term, it wants to convert its Naval 
ports and Air Force bases to NATO standards. 
  The presentation document still has to be negotiated with 
NATO, before it is finally handed over next week. At the 
conference of the NATO defense ministers in Brussels, the entry 
of those countries who want to participate in NATO's Partnership 
for Peace program will be discussed.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel; place and </F>
date not given: "An Important Partner"] 
  [Text] [SPIEGEL] Mr. Kinkel, the Federal Government 
resolved last Wednesday [4 May] to lift the four-week ban on the 
sale of arms to Turkey. Can you accept the responsibility for 
the Turkish military continuing to use German weapons against 
the Kurdish population in its own country? 
  [Kinkel] Of course not. But there is no definite proof to 
support this accusation. I have had all the photographic 
evidence examined by the Defense Ministry. No conclusive 
evidence was found that would indicate that weapons supplied by 
Germany had been used in internal altercations in Turkey in a 
manner contrary to our agreement. Had we had any proof of this, 
the sales would have been banned for good. 
  [SPIEGEL] Independent observers have seen with their own 
eyes 
Turkish military unimogs made by Mercedes, small arms made by 
Heckler and Koch, and Kalashnikovs and armored personnel 
carriers from former NVA [National People's Army] stocks, in the 
Kurdish region. Has all of this just been faked? 
  [Kinkel] I would not want to say that. At any rate, I have 
seen no convincing evidence. We really did not act rashly, 
instead we deliberately suspended the sale of arms following the 
most recent accusations and have carefully examined the 
photographic material we were given, with the known results. 
  [SPIEGEL] Only the conclusion differs completely from 
statements made by independent arms experts and former NVA 
officers, who positively identified eight-wheeled BTR-60 armored 
personnel carriers as former NVA vehicles based upon their 
special design features for German roads. 
  [Kinkel] According to the Defense Ministry, these features, 
like outside mirrors or white crosses on the backs of the 
vehicles, are not proof of German origin. They could also, quite 
obviously, have been put on vehicles that were sold to Turkey 
from other, for example Russian, stocks. Or the Turks may have 
put them on themselves. In addition, not one of the photographs 
we were presented with indicates that it was taken during a 
military deployment. 
  [SPIEGEL] German representatives attest to the fact that 
they 
detected poorly overpainted GDR symbols on some armored vehicles. 
  [Kinkel] Again: The Defense Ministry has said that this 
proves nothing regarding German sales. I cannot enter into 
criminal investigations and assessments at this time. 
[SPIEGEL] Is it not politically naive to sell 256,000 
Kalashnikovs and 5,000 machine guns to a government that has 
been criticized for its human rights policies, trusting that 
they really will not be used in the civil war? 
  [Kinkel] The Federal Government has always made it 
clear--most recently in a policy statement I presented--that 
human rights violations are occurring in Turkey, now as before. 
We are constantly pointing this out to Turkish politicians and 
are doing everything we can on this issue. That is why I do not 
allow myself to be saddled with it personally. But you must also 
see that we have been on friendly terms with Turkey for decades, 
and it is a politically, economically, and culturally important 
partner. It is a partner in NATO and since the abandonment of 
the East-West conflict has taken on an important new function as 
a bridge to the Islamic, to the Asian world. In addition to 
this, Turkey has its problem with the Kurds--and it is not the 
only one--and, since the most recent municipal elections, it is 
also facing a fundamentalist threat. All of this must enter into 
a well-balanced German policy on Turkey. 
  [SPIEGEL] Taking into account the danger that Bonn will 
become jointly responsible for the civil war in Turkey? 
  [Kinkel] Such criticism is unwarranted. The issue of the 
Kurds is a very difficult one for Turkey. Unfortunately there is 
little that can be done to help them with it. They must handle 
it themselves, but in conformity with the rule of the law. We 
Germans cannot solve Turkey's problems from here. But during 
difficult times our friends and partners also deserve our 
support. 
  [SPIEGEL] You are the one who propagates the idea of NATO 
being a community of values that should defend freedom and 
democracy. 
  [Kinkel] Yes, I do. Unfortunately a pluralist stance, such 
as 
you represent for ethical-moral reasons--and on that point we 
are in complete agreement--is not possible in the area of 
foreign policy. For example, we have NATO commitments with 
respect to Turkey. It simply is not possible to say we no longer 
want Turkey as a NATO partner. That would be a fatal decision 
given the current political situation. 
  [SPIEGEL] Now you are making German influence less than it 
is. 
  [Kinkel] I do not think so. It is becoming increasingly 
difficult for me as foreign minister to remind others of human 
rights violations when we ourselves are not able to maintain 
order in our country. More and more often I am reminded by 
foreign countries of how things were prior to 1945 with the 
unlawful German state and the holocaust. I am asked how things 
were until 1989 in the other part of Germany; was that not an 
unlawful state? And how are things now with the violence and 
murderous acts perpetrated by the radical right in Moelln and 
Solingen? I know of what I speak because in Turkey I stood at 
the open graves of those who had been murdered in Germany. That 
is why we should be a little more careful and hesitant to point 
a finger.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Richard von Weizsaecker by Einar </F>
Koch and Claus Larass; place and date not given: "`Longing for a 
Home is Good...'"] 
  [Text] [BILD] Mr. President, your 10 years in office will 
come to an end on 30 June. Would you like to stay on? 
  [Weizsaecker] No. These have been 10 years of fulfillment. 
Ten years are really enough for this gratifying, but also 
difficult and responsible office. 
  [BILD] An increasing number of citizens are skeptical about 
our state. Is there a crisis of meaning in people's lives? 
  [Weizsaecker] It is not a crisis of meaning, but a wrong 
understanding of the state. Who is the state? It is us, the 
community of citizens. There is no point in distancing oneself 
from the state on the one hand, and overstraining it as 
addressee of our claims and rights. It is in our, the 
citizens', interest, that the state meets its duties in 
connection with public welfare. That is why there must not be a 
crisis of public feeling. 
  [BILD] How can we expect the citizens to support the state, 
if the state itself sometimes does not take its own laws 
seriously? 
  [Weizsaecker] Of course there are shortcomings. Who would 
deny it. The acting in the state is done by humans. But the 
appearance of a state is formed by its citizens. The more they 
help each other and the more courageous they are, the better our 
state is. 
  [BILD] Can the term "home country" provide more orientation 
to people than it did over the past few years? 
  [Weizsaecker] The longing for a home is a natural and good 
human desire. Its becomes even more important at a time when we 
have grown far beyond national boundaries in terms of political 
decisionmaking and economic and scientific developments. 
  The stronger European integration gets, the more important a 
feeling of being rooted in one's own home country. 
  We want to promote the traditional, charming, and lively 
regions of Europe all the more, as we realize that there will no 
Scottish monetary policy, Brittanian trade policy, Lombardian 
energy policy, nor Bavarian defense policy, but that we will 
have to find a common ground in all of these fields. 
  [BILD] Are you proud of being German? 
  [Weizsaecker] I have been a convinced German without ifs and 
buts throughout all phases of this turbulent century, and I will 
stay that way. During my 10 years in office I have considered 
it my priority task to inspire and increase confidence in the 
Germans among our neighbors and all European nations. 
  If you are trying to promote such confidence you need to 
have 
confidence in your own country, which I have always had. 
  [BILD] If we want to integrate foreigners, will we not need 
double citizenship to achieve this? 
  [Weizsaecker] Let me give you an example: Take an 18 year 
old Turkish girl in Berlin who was born here and has grown up 
with her Berlin friends during school years and job training. 
Her future is here, and not in the country of her ancestors. 
  It is obvious that she not only wants to have the duties, 
but 
also the rights of a German citizen. It is understandable, is 
it not, that she does not want to draw a line with her parents 
and grandparents, does not want to hurt them by not giving a 
damn about her Turkish origin, but wants to go on respecting it 
and, therefore, does not want to cut the ties of citizenship? 
  Human fates and administrative traditions must be brought 
into harmony with each other. We will have to continue the 
debate and make progress. 
  [BILD] During your 10 years in office Helmut Kohl was 
chancellor. What is your opinion of him? 
  [Weizsaecker] The constitution provides for a division of 
labor, which we have followed in mutual respect. 
  The chancellor is elected in a legitimate power struggle 
between party politicians. The president is not unpolitical in 
his work, but independent and free of party ties. 
  These are two completely different mandates. This does not 
result in personal tensions, but in a division of power that 
makes us both work for the well-being of our country together. 
This is the way that Helmut Kohl and I have always seen it. 
  [BILD] We cannot believe that you want to retire 
politically.... 
  [Weizsaecker] My lively political interest dates back to the 
time before I held my first political office and it will go on 
after I retire from my last office. It is one of the tasks of 
old, retired people to share their experience, although not too 
loudly.

  [Text] Augsburg, Germany, May 20 (AFP) -- German 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl criticised the courts in an interview 
published Friday [20 May] for failing to use the full force of 
the law against people guilty of criminal violence. 
  But he refused to lay the blame solely on extreme-right 
supporters, adding that "all form of extremism is shameful for 
our country." 
  His comments in the AUGSBURGER ALLGEMEINEN followed 
incidents 
last week in Magdeburg when a crowd of skinheads and other 
youths chased a group of Africans through the town. In the 
ensuing clashes five people were injured, all Germans. 
  Kohl said he had "so often been to funerals of victims of 
the 
extreme Left that I refuse to put the problem down solely to 
violence by the Right." 
  "We must combat energetically all forms of violence," he 
said. 
  Kohl said he was not opposed to tightening the law but he 
said "the courts often hand down the lightest sentences." 
  The 49 people arrested after the Magdeburg clashes were 
later 
released by police.

<F P=106> [`eli'-signed report: "Conflict Between Bonn and </F>
SPD-Governed Laender; Coalition Sticks to Hard Drugs Ban"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- The first conflict seems to be developing 
between the government and a few laender governed by the SPD 
[Social Democratic Party of Germany] on the subject of future 
drugs policy. On Tuesday [17 May], the coalition talks 
consisting of leading Union [Christian Social Union and 
Christian Democratic Union] and FDP [Free Democratic Party] 
politicians decided against the implementation of a far-reaching 
drugs policy like the one in North Rhine-Westphalia. In the 
nearest future, a working group is to decide whether a 
German-wide legal amendment is required to keep the possession 
of hard drugs punishable. In North Rhine-Westphalia and 
Schleswig-Holstein, the possession of small quantities of heroin 
and cocaine has recently been legalized. One can even buy up to 
30 grams of hashish before the law intervenes. 
  CSU [Christian Social Union] Land Group Chief Michael Gros 
expressed criticism of North Rhine-Westphalian 
Minister-President Johannes Rau. "It is quite wrong for Rau to 
remain silent about the policy of his own justice minister, Rolf 
Krumsiek," said Gros, who described this policy as a "political 
dare-devil escapade." As a presidential candidate, Rau is 
supposed to bear responsibility for "the whole of German youth," 
said Gros. The coalition talks avoided any criticism of Rau, 
but spoke out firmly against the availability of hard drugs. 
The coalition believes that hard drugs will indeed be freely 
available in North Rhine-Westphalia. Therefore the drugs rule 
must be abolished, it was said. 
  A working group consisting of Health Minister Horst Seehofer 
(CSU), Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger 
(FDP), and Interior Minister Manfed Kanther (Christian 
Democratic Union, CDU) is to establish soon whether the law on 
intoxicating substances should be changed. One of the 
provisions of this law says that drug consumers must not 
necessarily be prosecuted if no damage to public interests is 
detectable or the perpetrator's guilt seems "slight." This is 
the case when drugs are used exclusively for private consumption. 
  Unlike in the case of North Rhine-Westphalia, the coalition 
has so far not expressed any criticism of the drugs policy of 
the Schleswig-Holstein government, which adopted a ruling last 
week whereby the acquisition and possession of up to one gram of 
heroin and up to five grams of cocaine and amphetamines is not 
punishable, just as in North Rhine-Westphalia. People can even 
possess up to 30 grams of cannabis products. In North 
Rhine-Westphalia, the upper limit on cannabis is 10 grams. 
There are still no upper limits in Lower Saxony, where it is up 
to the prosecution to decide whether or not drugs are consumed 
for private purposes. 
  The debate on drugs policy was initiated by a Constitutional 
Court ruling which allows law enforcement bodies to quash cases 
of drug consumption without actually sanctioning this 
consumption explicitly. The Court has said several times that 
it never meant to permit the consumption of hashish. 
Nevertheless prosecution can be waived in petty cases. In 
addition, the Court recommended working out uniform rules 
concerning drug consumption applicable to the entire republic. 
The justice ministers conference in Hamburg in early May 
decided that the above recommendation be implemented before 
summer. As a result, some laender, such as North 
Rhine-Westphalia, have produced preliminary rules. The justice 
ministers of the individual laender doubt whether these uniform 
German rules can be produced by the time of the 16 October 
elections. The justice ministry of North Rhine-Westphalia says 
there are major differences of opinion between northern and 
southern parts of the country on the subject of drugs. Hesse 
Justice Minister Christine Dennhardt and her Berlin colleague 
Lore-Maria Peschel-Gutzeit (SPD) -- Berlin is governed by a 
CDU/SPD coalition -- support North Rhine-Westphalia's policy. 
  Bavaria is opposed to a liberalization of drugs consumption, 
and wants life imprisonment for drug dealers. The Bavarian 
government has resolved to present a federal legal initiative 
empowering the courts to impose life imprisonment on drug 
dealers working in organized bands.

<F P=106> [`kl'-signed report: "Dispute in the SPD Over Drug Policy"] </F>
  [Text] Duesseldorf -- An open row has erupted inside the 
SPD [Social Democratic Party] on the subject of drug policy. On 
Wednesday [18 May], Peter Struck, federal general manager of the 
SPD Bundestag Group, criticized the SPD North Rhine-Westphalian 
government's decision to permit the possession of smaller 
quantities of drugs, even hard drugs. The North 
Rhine-Westphalian government defended its own decision. Partly 
as a reaction against sharp criticism from the federal 
government, however, the Duesseldorf government underscored the 
"provisional" nature of Justice Minister Rolf Krumsiek's drug 
guidelines, and called for uniform German rules laying down 
penalties for violating the law on intoxicating substances. 
  According to a declaration released following a cabinet 
meeting on Wednesday, the waiving of criminal proceedings for 
the possession of small quantities of hard and soft drugs as 
suggested by Krumsiek does not mean a legalization of the 
possession of drugs, nor does it mean a relaxation of the 
practice of law enforcement bodies until now. With its 
decision, North Rhine-Westphalia is merely acting within the 
limits of feasibility. 
  Interior Minister Herbert Schnoor said that the Federal 
Government was criticizing the North Rhine-Westphalian 
government's decision merely to deflect attention away from the 
failure of its own drug policy, which was geared strictly to 
prosecution rather then therapy and prevention. Evidence of the 
failure of this policy is the fact that since 1982, over 10,000 
people have died as a result of a misuse of drugs, and almost 
100,000 have consumed drugs for the first time in their lives. 
  Although Minister-President Johannes Rau also supports the 
stance of his justice minister, members of the North 
Rhine-Westphalian government consider both the timing and the 
official reason for Krumsiek's decision to be wrong. They are 
especially critical of the fact that in his guidelines, the 
minister availed himself of the ruling of the Constitutional 
Court even though the Court has said nothing about the 
possession of smaller quantities of hard drugs. 
  According to AFP, Strick called on the justice ministers of 
the SPD-led land governments to find a common line of policy. 
Strick told DEUTSCHLANDFUNK that the SPD wants no unconditional 
prosecution of drug consumers if they only consume soft drugs 
for private purposes. But Krumsiek's position goes further than 
this, he said. On the other hand, Johannes Singer, the drug 
expert of the SPD Bundestag group, defended the North 
Rhine-Westphalia government's decision.

<F P=106> [`mes'-signed report: "Scharping Supports Lafontaine"] </F>
  [Text] Berlin -- SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] 
leader Rudolf Scharping has said that if he takes over the 
government, he will subject state benefits to continuous review. 
After holding talks with his financial and social security 
experts, Oskar Lafontaine and Rudolf Dressler, he said in Bonn 
on Wednesday [18 May] that this did not mean a lowering of 
social benefits, but an urgently required modernization of the 
state's social activity. In this way, Scharping was reacting to 
Dressler's sharp criticism of Lafontaine, who had announced that 
the SPD would also be examining social benefits to consolidate 
the state's finances. 
  Scharping said that the state's permanently increasing debt 
was strangling the budget, erasing the government's political 
room for maneuver, and turning taxpayers into debtors with the 
banks. "The SPD," he said, "will not continue with this policy. 
Instead it will subject all state benefits, including tax and 
social benefits, to constant review."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Very Realist Retreat--The Greens </F>
Preparing To Be in Opposition in Bonn"] 
  [Text] Rudolf Scharping's greatest admirers are found among 
his political opponents: "He mercilessly backs the center," says 
CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union] 
Parliamentary Caucus Chairman Wolfgang Schaeuble respectfully, 
"the smartest thing he can do." 
  The SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] candidate for 
chancellor, on the other hand, represents the greatest 
disappointment to the Greens: "He is continuing," says Spokesman 
for the Executive Committee Ludger Volmer furiously, "where 
Helmut Schmidt dropped off--back in the seventies." The Greens 
are frustrated. 
  Never before had the alternative party believed themselves 
so 
close to governmental power as prior to election year 1994. What 
had played through with mixed reviews in several laender and 
municipalities appeared for the first time to be a realistic 
model for Bonn: a red-green government. 
  But the awaited signal from the candidate for chancellor 
failed to appear. While the Greens tirelessly continue promoting 
their social-ecological reform alliance, Scharping is making 
every effort to provide for conservative security demands. 
  For some time the irritated, ecologically minded peaceniks 
placated themselves with the idea that the SPD chairman was 
pursuing a well-planned strategy to increase the combined number 
of votes: Rather than getting in the way of the Greens and their 
agenda, so goes the benevolent interpretation, Scharping would 
prefer to try to take voters away from the union. 
  Since then, however, the mood has changed dramatically. 
Suspicion is growing that Scharping is turning into a true 
descendant of Helmut Schmidt. For him red-green is not a serious 
option, but "an accident," as Professor of Political Science 
Joachim Raschke pointedly put it last week at the presentation 
of a book on the SPD candidate. "Center-right," suspects 
Raschke, is apparently "nothing more than a tactic." 
  Scharping has already become all too involved with the 
union, 
almost as if he intends to document its indistinguishability 
from the SPD. This "idiotic self-imposed moderation," grumbles 
Hesse Environmental Minister Joschka Fischer, is "a fatal 
signal." 
  Apparently nothing frightens the SPD chairman more than the 
role of a reformer. True, in the "1994 Governmental Policy 
Program" a "social and ecological society" created "by a 
reversal of the economy" was heralded. The policy also speaks of 
a new energy and transportation policy. But most of it remains 
vague or safeguarded by clauses, particularly symbolic issues 
such as the speed limit or a higher mineral oils tax. 
  Rather than writing "time for a change" on his banners, 
complains Greens Politician Hubert Kleinert, Scharping is 
contributing "to the onerous atmosphere." How he, as a copy of 
Kohl, expects to win SPD sympathizers, "to reach 37 or 38 
percent" (Raschke), continues to puzzle many. 
  "We are not available as personal reinforcement for a policy 
of austerity and emergency government," says former civil rights 
campaigner Werner Schulz, who is currently secretary of the 
Alliance 90/Greens Bundestag parliamentary group. 
  Of course the ecos have long been aware that no atmosphere 
of 
departure reigns in the country, that there is not much left to 
distribute. And the term market economy is no longer a stimulus 
for them. At their party conference in February they joined in 
the economic debate with moderate proposals. 
  The demand initiated during the founding years that society 
be turned inside-out starting at the bottom has become passe. A 
number of unrealistic resolutions--withdrawal from NATO, 
immediate ban on the use of nuclear energy, abolishment of the 
Bundeswehr--are debatable even for members of the Left, like 
Volmer. What is important, qualifies the spokesman for the 
Fundamentalist faction, "is that action be initiated." 
  Realist faction leader Fischer has established himself 
firmly 
in politics. If he had first "taken his thrashing," as he puts 
it, in the party over his project of establishing the Greens as 
an "FDP [Free Democratic Party] substitute" in the political 
spectrum, even the party left would now admit that he was right. 
  At one appearance before the Frankfurt Chamber of Industry 
and Commerce Fischer was received with distrust and was bid 
goodbye with ovations. 
  And still, gulfs remain. 
  The Greens are under the impression that Scharping, with his 
dislike for the red-green project, is allowing himself to be 
guided by his experiences as minister president. In 
Rhineland-Palatinate he declined a coalition with an 
unpredictable Greens group and put his money on the Free 
Democrats instead. 
  The conflict between economy and ecology that has become 
more 
critical during the crisis has been worked out, as the Greens 
were forced to realize, in the older, established parties--and 
not in their favor. 
  To people who are losing ground socially and as a result of 
modernization, the SPD again appears as "protector of the little 
people," in keeping with the Social Democratic formula. From 
this angle, the desires of the Greens seem like post-industrial 
luxuries. 
  This also explains setbacks in the red-green models, which 
appeared to be well established all over the country. "These 
experiences have, on the whole, had a sobering effect," assesses 
Volmer. 
  Partly under pressure from the SPD labor union wing, and 
partly because of their empty coffers, land governments have 
been forced to very realistically halt plans to reorganize 
industry and the great transition scenarios for transportation 
and energy. This has also been the case in Fischer's Hesse home 
coalition. 
  The Wiesbaden coalition agreement of 1991--like the Hannover 
agreement--had already robbed the Greens of any illusions. The 
agreement provides for only "rearrangements" in the land budget 
for new policy estimates. It goes on to say, "the financial 
elbow-room, which has been decreased by German unity," will 
force "the clear establishment of priorities." 
  Even firmly established projects quickly began to slip. The 
ban on ecologically harmful PVC [polyvinyl chloride] materials 
in public buildings and dwellings was lifted. As former SPD 
Social Minister Armin Clauss explained, "In times of recession" 
his party could not share in such a "destruction of jobs." 
  Transportation policy is almost always a matter of conflict 
of the highest order. After the SPD's heavy losses in the 1993 
municipal elections in Hesse, the party was no longer ready to 
ban automobile drivers from downtown areas. Allowances for 
industry and for automobile enthusiasts interfered with the 
planned change. 
  In Frankfurt, where Greens member Tom Koenigs watches over 
the finances, the automobile-free city has become stuck in the 
planning stages, along with the "bicycle-friendly city." SPD 
head of the Planning Department Martin Wentz is fighting against 
the green-belt project: "We must decide whether we want to build 
homes or not." 
  Banning the use of nuclear energy remains a distant 
objective. At the land level Fischer has been able only to 
express "severe safety concerns." Still, he succeeded in 
bringing the old installation used to process plutonium in Hanau 
to a standstill and in harassing managers at the power plant in 
Biblis with taxes. 
  Seldom has coalition harmony been completely untroubled. The 
SPD differs from the Greens, according to a paper published by 
the left-leaning Hesse-South SPD district, "in that when 
planning for the necessary ecological restructuring of the 
industrial society it takes into account the social situation of 
workers who will be affected." 
  The fact that even mutual support does not protect the 
Greens 
from disappointments has become apparent in Lower Saxony, where 
Minister President Gerhard Schroeder can now govern with an 
absolute majority following the March elections. 
  It was a partnership of affection. Contact with the state 
chancellery was brief: "Come on over sometime." 
  From the very beginning, however, the Social Democrat had 
adhered to a proeconomic policy, in order to appease the 
traditional working clientele. Again and again Schroeder tested 
the ability of the Greens to withstand suffering--for example 
with his weakness for weapons exports or in the removal of the 
basic right to asylum, in the construction of a testing strip 
for Mercedes-Benz in swampland or with a pipeline through the 
mud flats. Not one of the Lower-Saxony nuclear power plants was 
dropped from the network. 
  After these types of experiences, departing Greens Bundesrat 
Minister Juergen Trittin doubts that a reform alliance with the 
SPD in Bonn is a possibility: "What is needed there first is 
crisis management." 
  Schroeder's neighboring colleague, Klaus Wedemeier, SPD 
mayor 
of Bremen, also has little positive support to contribute. In 
his stoplight coalition the Greens are gaining prestige, as they 
are in Hesse, to the detriment of the SPD. 
  In the stoplight coalition with the FDP, the Greens were 
hoping for "a modernization alliance." Instead, 
"reappropriations and reductions" were agreed upon. Social and 
cultural projects had to be cut--everything, according to Greens 
Senator Ralf Fuecks, "is a compromise with reality." 
  It is the same everywhere that is marked by an overstrained 
fiscal policy: "We muddled through," according to Volmer; "there 
is no influence in that." 
  After all these frustrations some Greens have rediscovered a 
desire to be in the opposition. In Lower Saxony, where they will 
no longer be needed in the government, "many are breathing 
freely," as the former Minister of Women's Affairs Waltraud 
Schoppe observed: "Now they can say everything they have been 
wanting to say all along." 
  In Bonn, too, believes the former Bundestag spokesperson, 
who 
hopes to return there in the fall, "we in the opposition can 
wait until a braver man than Scharping arrives on the scene." 
  That could be quite some time.

<F P=106> ["-ann" report: "Neuber: Further Prime Rate Reductions"] </F>
  [Text] Duesseldorf, 18 May -- Because of many special 
influences, the money supply has lost -- at least temporarily -- 
its significance as a central indicator of monetary policy. 
Thus, the Bundesbank is well advised to orient itself toward 
other values, such as costs and capacity utilization, which can 
help to predict the future development of prices. Since these 
indicators signal a further easing of tensions at the price 
front for the foreseeable future, one can probably assume that 
the Bundesbank will be willing to make further cautious 
reductions of the prime rate in the coming months -- even if the 
money supply does not move toward the target corridor. This was 
stated by Friedel Neuber, chairman of the board of directors of 
West Landesbank, at the news conference presenting his bank's 
balance sheet. 
  In Neuber's view, the overall economic constellation in the 
FRG is fundamentally different from that in the United States: 
There they have a strong upswing with expectations of rising 
inflation and an increasing demand in net capital imports, which 
goes hand in hand with increasing deficits in the balance of 
goods and services; here we have a generally moderate recovery 
of the economic development with expectations of declining 
inflation and a declining dependence on capital imports, which 
goes hand in hand with shrinking deficits of the balance of 
goods and services. In addition, short-term interest rates in 
Germany are now clearly below long-term interest rates, so that 
sooner or later shifts to longer-term forms of deposits can be 
expected. All this indicates that the German capital market 
will decouple itself from the U.S. capital market to a certain 
extent so that the German capital-market interest rate will 
probably go down again over the next few weeks. However, Neuber 
does not foresee a decline to the record low of the beginning of 
the year. 
  In the view of Neuber, who quoted a new 1994-95 forecast for 
Germany of the West Landesbank economists, the international 
economy has gotten out of the longest period of weakness of the 
postwar period so that, for the first time since 1989, the 
German economy will once again get tangible stimuli from abroad. 
In the wake of product and process innovations at the companies 
and a moderate wage round, Neuber sees a clear reduction of unit 
labor costs in industry in 1994, while productivity and profits 
will increase considerably.

<F P=106> [Interview with Johannes Ludewig, head of the department of </F>
economic and financial policy in the chancellery, by Stefan 
Baron and Friedrich Thelen; place and date not given: "There Is 
No Alternative'"] 
  [Text] Johannes Ludewig is Helmut Kohl's most trusted 
economic adviser. From 1967 to 1971 he studied economics in 
Hamburg; in 1972 he was awarded a Master of Science degree by 
Stanford University in California. Two years later he was 
awarded his doctorate with the thesis: "Basic Structures for 
Simulated Models of Whole Enterprises." He then aided FDP [Free 
Democratic Party] economics ministers for eight years, until he 
moved to the Chancellor's Office in 1983. Eight years later he 
became head of the ministerial department of economic and 
finance policy. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Mr. Ludewig, people used to believe the 
SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] did not know how to 
handle money; today they are said to have as much financial 
competence as the government. What did you do wrong? 
  [Ludewig] The financial competence of an opposition leader 
who cannot differentiate between gross and net is nothing to 
write home about. And take a look at the economic situation in 
the Saarland, which is governed by the chief economics 
spokesperson for the opposition! Where is the competence there? 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] When the CDU [Christian Democratic 
Union]/FDP coalition took over government in 1982 it promised 
the population a free-market renewal. 
  [Ludewig] Wait a minute! Railway reform, postal reform, the 
law on genetic engineering, the law governing working hours, 
health care reform--is that not something? By 1989 we had 
reduced taxes by 50 billion marks [DM], had reduced the ratio of 
public expenditure to GNP by almost 45 percent, and had created 
three million new jobs. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] We are writing this in 1994. 
  [Ludewig] True. But in 1989 German unification created a 
fundamentally different situation. We had to first create the 
conditions under which private capital would flow to the east, 
for example via a massive renewal of the infrastructure. Thus, 
an associated temporary increase in the ratio of public 
expenditure to GNP was unavoidable. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] The decisive issue in the Bundestag 
elections in the fall will be the high rate of unemployment. And 
in this area the Federal Government has not exactly covered 
itself with glory. The result of 12 years of Kohl is 4 million 
unemployed. 
  [Ludewig] That is unfair. Despite the current recession, 
during which approximately a million jobs have been lost, at 
this time we are registering a comparatively high rate of 
employment. We have more jobs in Germany today than we did in 
1989, before unification, and during the past four years we have 
experienced an afflux of 4.5 million people. Late repatriates, 
asylum-seekers, and refugees from what was formerly Yugoslavia. 
We have to deal with this first. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] So you are completely confident that the 
unemployment rate will drop soon? 
  [Ludewig] The competitiveness of German industry has already 
improved. So our chances of achieving an increase in employment, 
as was the case during the eighties, are good. Perhaps not as 
much in industry as in the services sector. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Even as the tax burden becomes more and 
more oppressive? 
  [Ludewig] Wolfgang Schaeuble has already given the answer to 
this in WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE: The total tax burden cannot be 
increased. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Then where would you get the 
approximately 
DM40 billion it will cost to implement the Constitutional Court 
ruling that states that lawmakers must make the minimum standard 
of living tax free? 
  [Ludewig] Obviously that will not be easy. It will have to 
be 
financed gradually, following a reasonable timetable. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Many lawyers consider a graduated 
settlement unconstitutional. 
  [Ludewig] I do not choose to comment on that at this time. 
We 
will present a plan in the summer, as announced. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] And that will be just another bit of 
patchwork! This government, which took office with the promise 
of a free-market renewal, has never mustered the courage to weed 
out our tax jungle according to free-market criteria. 
  [Ludewig] First of all the government has taken action in 
this area as well: Over the past four years it has reduced the 
number of tax breaks and special tax regulations in the amount 
of DM40 billion. But the fact remains: Tax simplification is a 
task that is high on the political agenda. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] A few months ago the federal chancellor 
announced a joint offensive. This has not been mentioned since 
then. 
  [Ludewig] We are working on that. You will be hearing of it 
soon. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] If you again receive a majority of votes 
you will again do nothing at all for quite some time. This 
government did not awaken until a crisis arose, until the 
possibility of its reelection began to be questioned. 
  [Ludewig] That is not entirely true, however you have raised 
an important issue: What will happen when we emerge from the 
recession, when we have positive growth rates, and when the 
increase in unemployment levels off? Can we then return to 
business as usual, can we then lean back again? That would be 
fatal. We still have much to do. The list of jobs we have made 
for ourselves, including the future business location program 
and the 30-point program, has not yet been completed, and I am 
doubtful as to whether we have actually come so far compared 
with other countries that we can in good conscience march out to 
greet the year 2000. Work on this agenda should continue, 
consistently and with perseverance. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Is a different government not the best 
defense against business as usual? 
  [Ludewig] No one seriously believes that on important 
strategic issues such as German unity or international 
competetiveness there would have been, or is, any real 
alternative to our policy. If the opposition itself can think of 
nothing definitive, our policy cannot have been so misguided.

<F P=106> [Helmut Egenhardt report: "No Hit: Who Is Supposed To Pay </F>
for That?"] 
  [Text] The Bundesbank expects about 2 trillion German 
marks [DM] in debts for the regional authorities (Federal 
Government, laender, communities, and supplementary budgets) in 
1994. This gigantic mountain of debts is, however, classified 
as "acceptable" in various comments, because it is a sum that 
amounts to "only" about 67 percent of the annual GNP -- "no fear 
of debts," because there exists a high amount of monetary and 
fixed assets of private persons (about DM9.5 trillion) and of 
companies and the state (about DM6 trillion). However, the 
state debts are, by far, not the total debts of the FRG. How 
much are they? 
  For decades, the FRG has engaged in an enormous policy of 
incurring debts, above all on the part of the governments. By 
1993, a gigantic mountain of debts of about DM6.5 trillion 
(after deducting potential double counting) had accumulated. 
How did it come about? 
  The mountain includes the above-mentioned debts of the 
state,in particular of the federal government of about DM700 
billion, the western German laender of about DM380 billion, and 
the communities of about DM150 billion. The supplementary 
budgets also had high debts, e.g. the railroads of about DM53 
billion and the post of about DM98 billion. The "successful 
work" of the Trust Agency has so far added a deficit of about 
DM150 billion. Debts of about DM180 billion have been incurred 
for the Unity Fund and the Loan Payment Fund. European Recovery 
Program loans amount to DM28 billion. For the eastern laender 
and the eastern communities, about DM45 billion in debts 
developed just over the three years of anschluss policy. This 
already adds up to about DM1.8 trillion in state debts for 1993. 
  In addition, there are debts of companies, self-employed 
people, farmers, etc. These debts are considered to be "normal" 
in the market economy and are, therefore, mostly excluded from 
the overall picture. Quite contrary are the statements on the 
former GDR, where all "debts" (including those of the companies) 
are always mentioned. 
  By the third quarter of 1993, the western German banks had 
issued leans of about DM4.9 trillion -- DM3.8 trillion to 
domestic nonbanks. Of these enormous loans about DM1.8 
trillion, for instance, went to companies and DM1.1 trillion to 
housing construction. Savings and loan associations issued loans 
of DM160 billion and insurance companies about DM450 billion. 
  This was not enough, however. In the FRG there are also the 
so-called commercial loans (debts of companies among each other 
without a bank) and acceptance credits, which add up to about 
DM700 to DM800 billion. This adds up to the total debts, which 
set off the assets. 
  Even though comparisons with the GDR are currently 
officially 
taboo -- unless one runs this country down -- it is permissible 
to mention the GDR debts. In this, one has to take into account 
that in the GDR there were only direct bank loans (no commercial 
loans, securities, capital markets). Calculated in German 
marks, the loans in the GDR amounted to about DM220 billion in 
1989. These were about 70 percent of the GDR GNP -- calculated 
in German marks and assessed at relatively low values -- in this 
year. In the FRG the proportion of overall domestic debts 
compared with the GNP in 1989 was 217 percent. A harsh verdict 
in terms of monetary policy! 
  Regarding the debts of the state (budget including bezirks 
and communities), in 1989 the GDR had about DM7 billion in 
investment loans for institutions in the cultural-social area, 
but basically no current loans. In contrast, the balance sheet 
even showed positive sums -- e.g. about DM90 billion from 
foreign trade direction coefficients. When, in 1990, loans of 
about DM28 billion were raised on the eve of unification, this 
was due to the political situation in this year. 
  In contrast to the FRG, the GDR had about DM20 billion debts 
abroad, which were relatively low by international standards but 
are mentioned as particularly negative nowadays. 
  What does this all mean for the citizen? Statistically, in 
1989, the overall debts per capita of the inhabitants in the FRG 
was about DM75,000 and in the GDR DM13,700. This includes debts 
for housing in the FRG of about DM15,000 and in the GDR of about 
DM2,800. Particularly important for everyone, however, are the 
debts of the state, because they are to be carried by all 
citizens: In 1989, they were about DM16,000 per person in the 
FRG and about DM3,000 (mid-1990) in the GDR (including foreign 
debts, without housing). What was thus contributed to 
unification by each side is obvious. If, in 1994, the state 
debts are skyrocketing to a total of DM2 trillion, each FRG 
citizen will have a share of DM24,700 in it (for a four-person 
family: DM99,000). For the sake of justice, at least the FRG 
debts incurred until unification should not burden the eastern 
citizens (DM16,000). 
  Beyond the state debts, loans to companies and private 
persons in the FRG, for instance, have risen by DM1 trillion to 
about DM3 trillion since 1989. One can see that the development 
of debts is not primarily due to the anschluss of the GDR, as 
politicians like to claim.

  [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  Readership Losses Noted </H8>
  The postunification rush of publishers to reestablish or buy 
into Berlin newspapers has not led to the increased circulation 
figures that were anticipated. Surveying the media situation in 
Berlin, the 25 April DER SPIEGEL weekly magazine noted that 
cumulative readership loss by Berlin newspapers in the last 
three years exceeds 250,000, a trend not even reversed by the 
Springer Verlag's flagship, DIE WELT, which, after moving its 
offices to Berlin, had 1993 losses of 70 million German marks 
[DM]. Eleven newspapers are competing for Berlin's readership 
and advertising revenue, making it "Germany's roughest and most 
chaotic press market." DER SPIEGEL speculated that "the 
combatants are thinking of the dazzling twenties, when 60 
dailies were published in the national capital...," noting that 
government ministries, offices and associations are still in 
Bonn, while the "legions of educated officials everyone dreamed 
of," as well as a strong intellectual milieu, are lacking in 
Berlin. DER SPIEGEL also reports that Germany's largest 
publishers, Axel Springer Verlag and Gruner and Jahr, have 
invested triple-digit millions in the Berlin market, which an 
unnamed expert sees as a "warmup run for the year 2000," when 
the national government is due to complete its move from Bonn to 
Berlin. 
<H5>  Circulation Losses and Promotion </H5>
  The 17 March FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE reported that a recent 
meeting of its stockholders expressed concern about its 
Berlin-based subsidiary, Deutsche Zeitungsverlag GmbH, publisher 
of NEUE ZEIT. The latter daily, once the organ of the GDR's 
Christian Democratic Union, has a circulation of only 33,000 
(compared to the 1990 figure of 104,000). The paper lost 
double-digit millions in 1993, and despite "widely recognized 
journalistic achievement and the redesign of the newspaper"--its 
unique blue newsprint and expanded eastern coverage, for 
example--its hoped for break-even point is expected in four 
years at the earliest. The report in DER SPIEGEL noted that 
despite costly promotional offers and extensive revisions in 
format, smaller publishers are having a hard time sustaining 
themselves in the current business environment: DER 
TAGESPIEGEL, a conservative and venerable daily, estimated it 
would reach 450,000 circulation after unification, equaling its 
1946 level, but circulation has stagnated at about 130,000. The 
DM100 million invested in its staff and new printing plant have 
led to annual losses in double-digit millions, and the new press 
has been sold to Springer Verlag. Although a new Gruner and 
Jahr plant is being built in Berlin, DER SPIEGEL observed "there 
is a shortage of material for so great a capacity. The eastern 
Berliners' initial enthusiasm for newspapers from the west is 
gone." So, too, is the enthusiasm for the daily BERLINER 
ZEITUNG, the former Socialist Unity Party [SED] Berlin bezirk 
organ, a favorite of old former party members: its circulation 
has fallen from 303,000 at unification to about 250,000, as 
reported in IVW circulation bureau figures. Erich Boehme, 
one-time editor in chief of DER SPIEGEL, in his fourth year as 
publisher of the BERLINER ZEITUNG, was cited in the paper's 25 
March issue as saying: "I want to get a foothold in western 
Berlin," claiming as inducements the impending introduction of a 
larger weekend edition and color presses and the expansion of 
the business section. 
<H5>  Victims in the Competition </H5>
  According to DER SPIEGEL, six Berlin newspapers have folded 
since Germany's unification in 1990, and a longtime daily, the 
SPANDAUER VOLKSBLATT, has become a weekly. The end may be near 
for NEUE ZEIT; JUNGE WELT, once the central paper for the SED's 
youth corps; and for the one-time SED national organ, NEUES 
DEUTSCHLAND, which suffered a drop in circulation from 1.5 
million to 80,000, and is being kept afloat by donations. The 
left-leaning western daily, TAGESZEITUNG, just celebrated its 
15th anniversary and dismissed its editor in chief for writing 
that the editors had become too well-behaved and conservative. 
With circulation stagnating at 60,000, down from the 1990 figure 
of 100,000, and only 3,500 copies being sold in the east, the 
newspaper chose to make its editor a "victim of the rock-hard 
competition in the capital's media market," and to replace him 
with a former VOGUE editor, in the hope of succeeding in a media 
market changing "as fast as men's necktie styles."

  [Text] Montpellier, France, May 20 (AFP) -- French 
Socialist leader Michel Rocard late Thursday [19 May] 
recommended lifting the ban on supplying arms to Bosnian Muslims 
as the only way to bring the Bosnian Serbs to their senses. 
  Rocard told a campaign rally for next month's European 
parliamentary elections that lifting the ban on weapons sales 
was "from now on, given the attitude of the Serbs, the only way 
to attain a political settlement, which will prove elusive for 
as long as the aggressors think they have more to gain through 
force of arms." 
  "Lifting the embargo only as far as the Muslims, the victims 
of the aggression, are concerned is a decision we no longer have 
the right to reject." 
  But he added it would be a "grave decision." 
  "We cannot on the one hand prove incapable of protecting the 
Bosnians and on the other hand refuse them the means to defend 
themselves against the aggression to which they are falling 
victim. 
  "We should use air strikes every time the (Serb) attacks 
start again. As for the embargo, the U.S. Senate itself has 
proposed lifting it. But in that case we would have to be sure 
that NATO could provide all the necessary cover." 
  The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) is on standby 
to provide air cover as and when requested by the United Nations 
to protect UN aid convoys and UN peacekeepers, and to enforce a 
ban on Serb artillery on the hills overlooking the Bosnian 
capital Sarajevo. 
  Rocard, a former prime minister, was responding to an 
initiative by French intellectual Bernard-Henri Levy, who has 
entered a list of candidates for the Euro-elections with a 
manifesto urging intervention in Bosnia, including the lifting 
of the ban on arms sales to the Bosnian Moslems. 
  Meanwhile French Premier Edouard Balladur, on a visit to 
France's Caribbean departments, defended his government's policy 
in Bosnia, where French soldiers have been the mainstay of the 
UN peacekeeping effort. 
  Speaking in Pointe-a-Pitre, capital of the French Caribbean 
island of Guadeloupe, Balladur said that thanks to French 
involvement in the peacekeeping mission, "the worst was avoided, 
humanitarian aid got through and talks aimed at reaching a 
peaceful settlement began."

<F P=106> [Report by Jean-Baptiste Naudet: "France Will Only Withdraw </F>
Troops From Bosnia if Negotiations Fail"] 
  [Text] Is it the result of domestic political 
considerations? Is it a warning to UN officials who are not 
taking a firm stance in defending the "blue helmets?" Is it a 
warning to the warring factions which continue to fight despite 
the peace plan theoretically agreed on by the big powers in 
Geneva? The announcement in Paris on Tuesday, 17 May, of the 
"partial" withdrawal of the French "blue helmets" from Bosnia 
caused some dismay among the leaders of the UN troops on the 
spot. 
  The withdrawal of almost 1,000 French troops from Glina in 
northern Krajina (territory in the hands of Serbian separatists 
in Croatia) by 15 June was planned "to compensate for the 
dispatch of French reinforcements to Sarajevo (1,000 men) in 
March following the NATO ultimatum. But the announcement of 
another "withdrawal," that of the French battalion (almost 1,300 
men) from Bihac, a Muslim enclave in western Bosnia, surprised 
everybody in Zagreb, the general headquarters of the UN 
Protection Force (UNPROFOR). Especially those mainly concerned 
-- the leaders of the French contingent. 
  The statement by French Defense Minister Francois Leotard 
(full withdrawal from Bihac by the end of the year), then the 
qualifying remarks by Foreign Minister Alain Juppe ("if there is 
no progress in the peace negotiations"), sowed doubt about 
Paris' real intentions. 
  UNPROFOR "understands the frustrations" of France, "which 
has 
long been the main contributor of troops to this operation," but 
it has not been "officially informed" about France's intention 
to reduce its contingent, a spokesman for the force, commanded 
by French General Bernard de Lapresle, said on Tuesday. 
  The leaders of the French "blue helmets" have not been 
informed about the intention to withdraw from Bihac, a UN "safe 
area," where the military situation continues to deteriorate 
under the double blows of Fikret Abdic's Muslim dissidents, 
supported to the west by the Krajina Serbs (Croatia), and the 
assaults of the Bosnian Serb forces to the east. The statement 
came as a surprise although the French have been trying for 
months, without success, to be replaced by other "blue helmets," 
especially Malaysians, in Bihac. 
  Diplomatic and financial circles have speculated that 
financial considerations or rather that of "media profile" lies 
behind this decision: The French battalion in Bihac is costly. 
And although it is popular and has probably saved the enclave 
from a Serbian invasion, the press, concentrated in Sarajevo, 
says little about it. Some people do not rule out the 
possibility that, by overdramatizing the situation, the defense 
minister is trying to secure more funding. 
  Nor is it possible to rule out the possibility that French 
officials are trying rather noisily to send a signal both to the 
UN civilian leaders and to the warring sides. With regard to 
Bihac, incidents took place in March during a Serb offensive 
between the French authorities and the UN civilian officials. 
France cannot continue its participation in the UN forces in 
Bosnia "on a lasting basis" if its soldiers cannot "defend 
themselves against aggression," Mr. Leotard said, while the UN 
secretary general's representative took a long time to ask the 
NATO planes to silence the Serb guns which were bombarding the 
French "blue helmets" in Bihac. Prime Minister Edouard 
Balladur, who made a surprise visit to Bihac after this 
incident, criticized "the excessively long delays, the 
excessively cumbersome administrative and political procedures" 
for organizing military responses by air in the case of attacks 
on the "blue helmets." 
  The new warning of the "partial withdrawal" comes at a time 
when the UN "safe areas" of Bihac, Tuzla, and Sarajevo are once 
again the target of Serbian fire, without UN officials reacting. 
That cannot "improve the situation" a UNPROFOR spokesman 
explained to us. 
  The cacophony in Paris -- which is not the first -- on all 
events is sowing confusion within the ranks of UNPROFOR in 
Zagreb. Many people here are simply wondering whether the 
French Government has just one policy on Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Text] France seems to be working on a major new diplomatic 
initiative in Rwanda. Yesterday, it was calling for the 
organization of a regional summit to end the genocide. Today, it 
was hosting Faustin Twagiramungu, the Rwandan interim prime 
minister-designate, who was appointed by the Arusha accords as 
representing a kind of third way between the Rwandan Armed 
Forces and the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front]. 
  Faustin Twagiramungu held talks this afternoon at the 
Foreign 
Ministry in Paris. A Foreign Ministry spokesman this evening 
revealed that there had been a broad consensus. According to the 
spokesman, the prime minister-designate insists on the validity 
of the Arusha accords, on condemning extremists on all sides, 
and on setting up an international tribunal to judge those 
guilty of the massacres. Twagiramungu will also see President 
Francois Mitterrand and Prime Minister Balladur.

<F P=106> [Interview with Budget Minister Nicolas Sarkozy by </F>
Jean-Francois Couvrat; place and date not given: "Sarkozy 
Tightens Up 1994 Budget"] 
  [Text] [Couvrat] The government has announced a lot of new 
spending since January. How will you maintain your budgetary 
objectives this year? 
  [Sarkozy] When we came to government, the French economy was 
in a deep recession. We therefore had to completely reshape the 
1993 finance bill which the Socialists had left us and then 
launch the Balladur loan. This is the gamble we took in 
announcing a 1.4-percent growth rate for 1994. There were then 
many observers who thought that we would never achieve that 
rate. Today most have rallied round and the average growth rate 
forecast by the economic institutes for this year is 1.4 
percent. For several weeks, all the indications have been that 
the economic machinery is starting up again. Manufacturing 
production apparently grew by 2.4 percent in the first quarter, 
even if it stagnated in March. Job offers have increased by 38 
percent. Redundancies have fallen by 19 percent. Finally, the 
most spectacular thing is that, for the first time since 1990, 
20,700 more jobs were created than were lost in the first 
quarter. Who would have thought that was possible just a few 
months ago? 
  [Couvrat] What is your objective? 
  [Sarkozy] Our objective is twofold. We must fund the 
government's priorities: the fight against unemployment, which 
is our absolute priority; security, urban, and regional 
development policies. But we must also ensure that the aim of 
reducing public deficits is strictly respected. Because, 
contrary to the false idea which sometimes circulates, it is the 
accumulation of public deficits which could jeopardize the 
emerging growth. Deficits increase long-term interest rates; 
they are a source of anxiety for the future, whereas we must 
encourage demand by reassuring it; finally, if the state borrows 
too much, that is money which private investors will not have. 
The budgetary limitations will therefore be maintained. 
Consequently, we must control the deficits. This is a formal 
request from the prime minister. The 1994 budget deficit will 
not exceed 301 billion francs [Fr]. And the deficit forecast in 
the draft 1995 budget will be around Fr275-280 billion. 
  [Couvrat] Will you have to cut into the budgets of some 
ministries this year to finance the new expenditures which have 
been announced? 
  [Sarkozy] There are two bad courses of action which can be 
taken. The first is to set a ceiling on all the budgets, 
without thinking about the government's priorities, which would 
deprive it of all credibility. The second consists of spending 
without counting and without worrying about how to fund it. 
Here, you find yourself in the situation which we inherited from 
the Socialists, which led to the worst recession ever since the 
war. 
  We chose the path of reason. It consists of guaranteeing all 
new expenditures by economies in public spending. We already 
did that at the beginning of April. An advance decree made it 
possible Fr2.2 billion in savings on all ministries, to fund 
Fr2.2 billion in new expenditures: aid to fishermen, automobile 
subsidies, safety measures in the schools. 
  Still on the subject of the 1994 budget, we must now finance 
the other new expenditures: the youth employment subsidy, i.e., 
between Fr2 and Fr3 billion, and the measures accompanying the 
devaluation of the CFA [African Financial Community] franc. It 
should be noted that the new funding allocated to the police, 
the legal system, regional development, and even the 
implementation of the military programming law will only take 
place from 1995 and will be spread out. Moreover, we expect 
around Fr10 billion in additional fiscal revenue this year 
compared with the forecasts. 
  [Couvrat] What savings will you make? 
  [Sarkozy] The prime minister has just authorized me to carry 
out a budget adjustment of Fr7 billion over a base of Fr118 
billion. These are current operational funds or subsidies which 
the ministries will not be able to spend without justifying 
every franc. Anything which is not vital will be canceled. 
Everybody must understand that failing to reduce the deficits 
is running the risk of stifling growth. All the European 
countries have made the same choice. It should be noted that in 
our case, we are doing it without increasing the compulsory 
deductions, unlike the British Government, the only country in 
the Community whose growth forecasts for 1995 have been lowered 
after it had to propose a substantial tax increase. 
  [Couvrat] If new savings finance new expenditures, why 
privatize the AGF [French General Insurance Company] this year? 
  [Sarkozy] We are privatizing the AGF in order to be able to 
renew the capital of the public enterprises, especially Air 
France, which should receive Fr10 billion this year, then Fr5 
billion in 1995, and another Fr5 billion in 1996. Moreover, I 
find it difficult to see how the European Commission could 
prevent us from saving as important an enterprise as Air France, 
after the efforts which the staff have been asked and have 
agreed to make. The government's European choices are 
well-known. That is why we cannot afford to be either weak or 
naive. 
  [Couvrat] Is the announcement of this budgetary adjustment 
not intended to reassure our German partners, worried by the 
loss of control over public spending in France? 
  [Sarkozy] No. The aim is to pursue the economic policy in 
which we believe. I would like to add that the pace of economic 
activity is virtually the same on both sides of the Rhine. In 
France and in Germany, the recovery is being led by foreign 
trade and investment. As for the efforts made by our partners 
to balance their accounts, they are naturally worthy of praise. 
But the action we launched in 1993 was equally spectacular in 
its efficacy and content. We reduced our deficit by 1.2 percent 
of GDP! The social security deficit will thus be halved 
compared with the underlying deficit. Unemployment insurance 
will generate a surplus this year. As for the budget deficit, it 
is and will continue to be reduced. Between 1993 and 1995 it 
will be reduced by Fr65 billion! 
  [Couvrat] The Germans criticize the French Government, above 
all, because it has increased public debt, with the elimination 
of the one-month lag in VAT [reimbursement of value-added-tax] 
in particular, without it appearing in the budget. 
  [Sarkozy] I do not accept that criticism, which, moreover, I 
have not heard from our German partners. The reimbursement of 
the one-month VAT lag has enabled thousands of enterprises to 
survive. This debt to businesses existed already, if not in the 
state's accounts, at least in the accounts of those who had been 
waiting for reimbursement for years. In France and in Germany, 
moreover, everybody has his accounting conventions. For 
instance, the deficit of the [German] Trust Agency, which funds 
investments in the East, does not appear in the German public 
deficit. Who is the most open? The one who reintroduces into 
the state accounts a debt which ought to have been there, or the 
one who takes out of the state accounts a debt which is not 
there? All in all, the French public deficit will amount to 5.4 
percent of GDP in 1994 and 4.2 percent in 1995, compared with 
5.3 percent and 4.2 percent respectively in Germany. 
  [Couvrat] But what is your answer to the foreign investors 
who seem to share the anxiety of the German authorities? 
  [Sarkozy] There is no reason to be worried. The deficits 
will not increase. The government's priorities will be funded. 
French growth is starting again on a sound basis. We know that 
there is money in savings accounts and money in businesses. 
Everything is in place for strong growth to resume. The 
nervousness of the financial markets depends very largely on a 
bad analysis of the situation, which means that the U.S. economy 
and the European economy are treated in the same way. Is there 
a risk of the recovery in the United States leading to a new 
increase in inflation? I would refrain from giving a verdict on 
that. What I do know is that there is no risk of inflation in 
Europe. And, to say the least, we are not worried about too 
rapid a recovery. There is no objective reason why the pressure 
on interest rates in Europe should continue. 
  That is why we are determined to reduce the budget deficit. 
Advocates of an unlimited deficit must shoulder their 
responsibilities. They must therefore explain to us how, with 
public accounts which are not well kept, it would be possible to 
maintain interest rates; and how, with rising interest rates, 
the economic recovery could last. A different policy is 
certainly possible. But I do not think that it would produce 
better results than the policy implemented over the past year by 
Edouard Balladur. 
  [Couvrat] Did the increase in household contributions last 
year not curb the economy too strongly? 
  [Sarkozy] That was one of the great debates at the time. It 
was explained to us that increasing the CSG [General Social 
Contribution] was likely to postpone all the prospects of 
growth. The facts proved us right. I do not regret the fact 
that we increased the CSG immediately. Because it was a painful 
operation which cannot constantly be repeated, it is now forcing 
us to find savings in health insurance. 
  Those who reject that must be prepared to explain to the 
country that the CSG must be increased again. For the 
government, matters are clear: There will be no new increase in 
the CSG. The only path which can be envisaged is that of 
savings. 
  [Couvrat] Do you regret the fact that you had to adapt your 
budget policy to the constraints of an excessively restrictive 
monetary policy? 
  [Sarkozy] It was obviously necessary for us to adapt. There 
is no good budget policy in absolute terms. A good budget 
policy must be adapted to the economic situation of the moment. 
As for monetary policy, I leave it to the theoreticians to 
decide whether or not it is too restrictive. Finally, interest 
rates have dropped spectacularly, and the economy is taking off 
again. This is the essential thing. I therefore do not 
understand the continuation of the controversy on this subject 
now. 
  [Couvrat] In 1995, how much room to maneuver will you have 
for public finances? 
  [Sarkozy] Our room to maneuver will not be great. The 
recovery is being led by exports and investments, which do not 
increase the state's main revenue -- VAT. In addition, we will 
continue to suffer the consequences of the crisis. Moreover, 
this makes the debate on passive spending on unemployment, which 
some people would like to turn into active spending for 
employment, unrealistic. But who would suggest reducing the 
benefits paid to the unemployed and those who have had to retire 
early? 
  [Couvrat] When will you succeed in making savings on social 
security spending? 
  [Sarkozy] We have already done so. We will continue to do 
so. If we want to maintain the French people's social benefits, 
we must continue the vital effort to achieve medical control of 
health spending. It is not emergency services which worry us: 
The increase in costs in this sphere is consistent with the 
agreement reached between the social affairs minister and the 
professionals. On the other hand, spending on drugs increased by 
7.2 percent in 1993, which is equivalent to a spontaneous 
increase of 10 percent, partly disguised by the reduction in 
reimbursements decided last year. And hospital spending has 
also increased by 7 percent over 12 months. 
  If we do not want to increase compulsory contributions, we 
have no other course but to control spending. But we will not 
succeed in doing that without convincing the professionals 
concerned: doctors, members of the drug industry, and hospital 
staff. It is with them that we will succeed. 
  [Couvrat] The prime minister has just suggested a reform of 
social security funding which, with regard to contributions, 
would replace methods of funding based on consumption or income. 
Is this the right time to reduce income tax, as you have 
promised to do for 1995? 
  [Sarkozy] In 1993, we carried out a first stage in this 
reduction by returning Fr19 billion to the French people. That 
was a good initiative. The first reduction of Fr6 billion, 
which took effect with the first interim tax payment, is not 
unconnected with the good economic indicators. The remaining 
amount, in other words Fr13 billion, will be implemented on the 
final one-third of taxes due. 
  Should we go further? I am convinced that the income tax 
reform must be continued. But should it be continued as of 1995 
or later? The question is this: For what should we use the 
margins which the new-found growth will give us? This is the 
heart of the debate. I am listening. I am gathering views. I 
am listening to the arguments of those like Jacques Barrot or 
Christian Poncelet, who propose to defer the reform, not to use 
the room to maneuver which is available for cutting income tax, 
but rather for reducing social security costs in order to create 
jobs. I will participate in this debate. This matter has not 
been decided. The majority will have to debate it. It will be 
for the government to draw the conclusions when the time for 
budget adjustments comes, in other words during the summer.

<F P=106> [Interview with European Commission President Jacques Delors </F>
by Franco Papitto; place and date not given: "Individualism 
Threatens Europe"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- Just a few days away from the European 
elections and a few months away from the end of his third term 
of office, European Commission President Jacques Delors promised 
to continue working in his position "unceasingly and until the 
last day." But Europe is about to witness the end of the 
"Delors decade" -- a period which has already acquired legendary 
status within the Brussels institutions; a period which many 
factors suggest is coming to an end too soon, and which is 
referred to as some kind of "golden age" in the offices of 
Europe's capital. This era has come to an end mainly because 
today's Europe seems to reject the values of Jacques Delors. 
  [Papitto] Mr. President, you are about to leave a Europe 
very 
different from the one you found 10 years ago. A swing to the 
right is occurring in almost every country, and a party that has 
always declared itself to be heir to fascism, at least until a 
few months ago, is joining the Italian Government. Is this a 
good thing or a bad thing for Europe? Could it set an example 
for other countries? 
  [Delors] The president of the European Commission must be 
careful not to intervene in a Community member country's 
internal affairs. For my part, I will judge the Italian 
Government's action on the basis of what it does and without any 
mental reservations. As far as I am concerned, it is only deeds 
that count. 
  [Papitto] Mr. President, Italy's affairs are also Europe's 
affairs. We could regard Italy as a portion of Europe. 
  [Delors] There are two disturbing factors in Europe today. 
On the one hand, the vigor of our democracies is growing 
weaker. The Europeans are drawing in on themselves, in a crazy 
individualism that ignores the real situation, namely, that the 
future of each one of us depends partly on the future of the 
group to which we belong. And, on the other hand, there is the 
return of false prophets -- and not only in the East. 
Yugoslavia is the tragic expression of all this, with the 
monstrous ideology of ethnic cleansing. Furthermore, we are 
witnessing everywhere the advance of populism, the spread of an 
attitude of rejection of others, of those who are different by 
virtue of their religion, their ethnicity, or the color of their 
skin. Irrespective of individual elections, this is the real 
danger that threatens to poison our democracies. 
  [Papitto] How should we respond to this? 
  [Delors] It is more necessary than ever to return to the 
fundamental values that led to the formation of the European 
Community: respect for others, the awareness that in the world 
of today and tomorrow none of our countries -- even the 
strongest -- can defend its interests on its own and disseminate 
its own values. We are at a crucial moment in Europe's 
evolution, which is more vulnerable precisely because it is 
stronger. 
  [Papitto] Mr. President, why is it stronger and more 
vulnerable? 
  [Delors] A doctor too will tell you that a virus makes 
swifter progress in a strong and healthy body than in an aged 
body. As it progresses, Europe becomes more vulnerable because 
it becomes more and more part of everyone's life. Then citizens 
rightly begin to wonder about the nature of this Europe that is 
influencing their lives. Until Maastricht Europe was something 
to be taken for granted; not any more. And I do not say this 
with regret. In fact it is a good thing, because the citizens' 
involvement will be more aware. 
  [Papitto] Are the Euroskeptics among the false prophets who 
are returning? 
  [Delors] Until a few years ago, our cooperation developed 
within the context of the historical necessity of a Europe split 
in two. Since the collapse of the Berlin Wall other problems 
have arisen, and we must not be surprised if there are 
hesitations with regard to their scale. The priority now is to 
heed the countries of the East in order to understand their 
demands, hopes, and expectations. I have visited them, and it 
seems to me that their main concern is security. Some of them 
have been received into the WEU [Western European Union] as 
associate members; and we are working on the stability pact 
proposed by France and taken up by the European Council. 
  [Papitto] Meanwhile the European Union [EU] is extending to 
include four more countries -- Austria, Norway, Finland, and 
Sweden -- while another two, Poland and Hungary, have officially 
applied for membership. As of next year we will be 16, and 
later 20 or 24. How will such a huge EU function? 
  [Delors] There are plans for a meeting in two years of an 
intergovernmental conference that will broach these very issues. 
It is obvious to everyone that a Europe of 20 or 24 members 
cannot function with the existing institutions. But permit me 
to say that this is a matter that the next Commission will 
broach, insofar as it is its responsibility to do so, and I will 
not be free to express myself as an ordinary citizen until next 
1 January. I will do so, because my battle for Europe will 
continue. But I do not own any television channels or 
newspapers, nor do I lead any large political party. I will 
continue thinking about and working for Europe; whether I will 
be heeded, I do not know. 
  [Papitto] Will these issues be broached at the coming 
European Council meeting in Corfu? 
  [Delors] The Corfu meeting will mainly discuss the economy 
and how to improve cooperation within the context of the second 
phase of Economic and Monetary Union that we are building. It 
will also make up a balance of the first implementation phase of 
the Maastricht Treaty which created the EU. There will also be 
a discussion of the implementation of the White Paper on 
competitiveness, growth, and employment approved by the European 
Council in Brussels. Judging from what I was told by the Greek 
presidency, there will not be much discussion of Europe's future. 
  [Papitto] What about unemployment? 
  [Delors] This was the subject of the European Council in 
Brussels, which approved the White Paper whose implementation 
will be discussed in Corfu. Its analysis of the situation can 
be summed up in three points: 1. We are emerging from the most 
serious recession since the thirties; 2. we are doing so without 
any instances of overheating of the economy, partly because the 
great European market and the policy of competitiveness have 
proved to be important resources in combating inflation; 3. 
despite the recovery of growth, unemployment will remain large 
and Europe's chief problem. The White Paper already contains 
some ideas and proposals, but we must develop them, move 
forward. We cannot find solutions without considering such 
fundamental issues as the role of work in tomorrow's society, 
and the overall organization of society. At the European 
Council in Essen in December, the Commission will submit some 
new ideas for considerably reducing unemployment. We are 
already working on this, and it will be my "vacation homework." 
  [Papitto] With "Europe's chief problem" so highly developed, 
is it really possible to build Economic and Monetary Union? 
  [Delors] Our countries could resign themselves and exclude 
7-8 percent of the population; or they will realize that 
societies with strong exclusions are generally socially and 
politically unstable. If the latter happens, the evil of 
unemployment will be tackled vigorously. The voters will say: 
A single currency is all very well, but what do you propose in 
order to build a more homogeneous society that displays more 
solidarity? This will be the main subject of political debate 
before the end of the century. 
  [Papitto] What do you think you could say to the voters in 
this election campaign, when almost everywhere national issues 
are stifling European issues? 
  [Delors] This campaign takes place every five years and is a 
valuable opportunity to take stock after the very busy years 
that Europe has experienced. It is necessary to vote, not to 
yield to the temptation to abstain, because through their votes 
citizens express their interest in their own collective future. 
Basically the choice is simple: There are those who want a 
political Europe -- in which the member countries will agree to 
exercise their sovereignty together whenever their interests are 
shared, and which for this purpose provides itself with the 
necessary capacity for decisionmaking and action -- and there 
are those who advocate a soulless and spineless trading area. 
  [Papitto] What is the European Parliament's role? 
  [Delors] It has been crucial in boosting our cooperation. My 
efforts to gain approval of the Single Act -- the first reform 
of the Community -- would have been in vain without the support 
of what was called the "Spinelli report." The Parliament that I 
have known, during my 10 years as president of the Commission, 
has played its part in strengthening European building. The 
next one will have a more important role because it will have 
greater powers, granted to us by the Maastricht Treaty, and 
because in 1996 there will be the institutional reform that will 
decide on Europe's future. 
  [Papitto] What is your greatest regret, looking back over 
these years? 
  [Delors] Not to have been heeded when I said that Germany's 
unification would place a heavy recessionary burden on everyone. 
I did not stress this sufficiently, because I risked appearing 
like the Frenchman hindering unification, whereas I was the 
first to support it. 
  [Papitto] What is your overall assessment of the "Delors 
decade?" 
  [Delors] I think I am leaving a more compact European 
Community, with almost irreversible bases. But in the meantime 
the world has changed, and new challenges have therefore 
emerged. They must be taken up. Even as a youngster, I did not 
believe that a man could become God or Prometheus. I know that 
often the obstacle lies at the end of the road, that failure 
always lies in wait, and that it is necessary to start over 
without a break. But this is mankind's adventure.

<F P=106> [Jean Beyls report: "Two-Speed Europe Unavoidable"] </F>
  [Text] Karel van Miert, vice president of the European 
Commission (EC), spoke yesterday [16 May] at the International 
Relations Organization (VIRA) forum on the subject "More Europe 
or Less Europe?" "There are two issues: The apparent gulf 
between the European public and European bureaucracy and the 
controversy over the transfer of responsibilities," he said. 
"Some years ago this choice of title for a talk would have been 
inconceivable; it would have seemed ridiculous or 
Moscow-inspired. But now the advocates of European building 
must come to terms with a challenge to its very principle, as 
well as doubts and unenthusiasm. This was not serious as long 
as the very foundations of Europe were not threatened, but this 
is happening now, and publicly too. Mrs. Thatcher has gained 
converts, and not only in Italy. In other words, to be a 
European now means to expose yourself to suspicion or 
marginalization," Van Miert explained. 
<H5>  Minimalist Europe </H5>
  "The Paris-Bonn axis is no longer the heart of European 
action. Paris is not happy about Europe's enlargement or about 
Germany's growing influence, so much so that it is becoming an 
internal French problem of balance," Karel van Miert continued. 
"But there is more to it than that: Every member state is 
engaging in an increasingly sharp debate on its financial 
contribution and on what benefits its derives in terms of 
budgets and transfers. Germany and Spain stand out in this 
regard. This kind of inter-Belgian debate, with which we are 
well acquainted, is now developing throughout the Europe of the 
Twelve. We have even heard remarks that indicate a negative 
attitude with regard to aid to Palestine. Thus the minimalist 
Europe is gaining ground. The possible elimination of the 
Commission is even being suggested. Such ideas are being 
advocated publicly and even in election campaigns." 
<H5>  Positive Aspects of Europe </H5>
  Nevertheless, Karel van Miert believes that the advocates of 
Europe must go back onto the offensive more. And that they have 
every justification for doing so. "First, there is the historic 
necessity for European unification, which guarantees peace in 
Western Europe. Furthermore, if we slide down the slippery 
slope of nationalisms, nobody knows where the trend could lead. 
And threats of confrontation could reemerge, doubtless more 
quickly than is imagined." And this is why the European 
commissioner considers populism and hypernationalism major and 
very dangerous faults. 
  "Last, there is the entire internal dynamic of the great 
European market, despite certain shortcomings, compromise 
decisions, and disappointments. It is leading to the 
liberalization of markets in both telecommunications and air 
transport. It is a difficult transition, but the change will 
enable Europe to meet the challenges presented by the United 
States and Japan worldwide." 
  "This dynamism also occurs in other fields, such as 
audiovisual media. The Commission is currently examining some 
20 cases: The disputes are between the public and private 
sectors, the national and the regional, while major groups are 
being established to implement the latest advances in computer 
technology and other innovations. The dispute extends to sports 
and to the broadcasting of soccer matches." "I also note," 
Karel van Miert said, "that it is often the countries that most 
criticize European building that are also most demanding in 
terms of community directives." "Experience also shows that 
major principles are not enough if they are not accompanied by 
specific instructions for their implementation. Last, within 
the growing interdependence, of which even the Germans are now 
becoming more aware, in the light of their own difficulties, 
European Monetary Union also appears to be a necessity. And the 
Twelve absolutely must reach agreement on this." 
<H5>  Crucial Issues </H5>
  Having described the negative and positive aspects of the EU 
today, the EC vice president concluded by saying that "the EU 
enlargement will raise some crucial issues. He fears blockages, 
because individual members will from time to time raise 
questions, as in connection with the accession of Malta and 
Cyprus. The EU foreign and defense policy also suffers as a 
result of this. At the institutional level, some major member 
states are unwilling to accept that the rotating presidency be 
granted to minor states." 
  "Last, there is the huge cost of the envisaged enlargement. 
In order to achieve it it will be necessary to increase the 
Union's resources `enormously.' And there is therefore a danger 
of lapsing into a policy of expedience." Karel van Miert 
therefore thought it inevitable that the trend would be toward a 
two-speed Europe. This prospect has become unavoidable. 
  "To pretend otherwise would be to lie to the public," he 
said. "Some countries are tired of waiting for new progress on 
the road to union. Some member states must also realize that at 
the end of the transition period they must better honor the 
obligations connected with their EU membership. This also 
applies to Switzerland, which citing its democratic aspirations, 
is trying to establish new relations with the Twelve, in the 
belief that it can derive the maximum benefits for the minimum 
of drawbacks and offsets."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Spadolini: But Now It Will Be </F>
Difficult To Govern"] 
  [Text] Rome -- "By a single vote -- the very same result as 
in my vote..." Giovanni Spadolini, former speaker of the Senate, 
could not fail to note the analogy with his own, most painful, 
failure to be elected. "Now it will be very difficult to 
govern," Spadolini said. "Great wisdom and balance will be 
demanded from the government and Parliament..." Does Berlusconi 
have these gifts? "I said from the government and Parliament. 
It is not a matter of personal gifts." 
  Gianfranco Fini, the National Alliance leader, was not 
surprised by the result in the Senate. "It could not have 
worked out in any other way than it did. Those members of the 
Italian Popular Party that distanced themselves from Mancino and 
his entrenched and prejudiced position did well to do so." 
  "It went very well," Defense Minister Cesare Previti said 
enthusiastically. "I hope now that through our deeds we will 
succeed in convincing part of the opposition that we deserve 
their confidence." Francesco Tabladini, the Northern League 
group leader, took the result as a "victory for the League, for 
its central position in this government, as well as for its 
position as guarantor of the democratic institutions." 
  The CCD's [Christian Democratic Center] Clemente Mastella 
made the following cautious comment: "It is a limited result 
but it was sufficient to achieve a majority. For the present 
the situation is calm, but later it will be necessary to contend 
with the opposition forces at the parliamentary level..." Livio 
Caputo, Forza Italia's under secretary for foreign affairs, had 
this to say: "After this initial division, necessitated by 
circumstances, it will be possible to work with the Popular 
Party group in the committees on the substance of various 
measures."

<F P=106> [Report over video by correspondent Paolo Cantore] </F>
  [Text] [Announcer Mimo Liguoro] Telecommunications will be 
the big money-maker of the year 2000. This sector is dominated 
by sophisticated and up-to-the minute technology that will 
generate thousands of billions of lire and that will change our 
lives. In Italy, up until now, the sector has been run by a 
number of state-controlled companies. These will now merge into 
a new company called Telecom Italia. Paolo Cantore reports: 
  [Cantore] The Italian telecommunications colossus is about 
to 
be born. Telecom Italia--the new society created by the merger 
of five companies that were formerly part of the IRI-STET 
[Institute for Industrial Reconstruction-Telephone Finance 
Company] group into SIP [state-owned telephone company] --will 
be the sixth largest telecommunications operator in the world. 
The new company will have 100,000 employees, an income of 27 
trillion lire, and technological assets worth 52 trillion lire. 
  The merger was decided today by the boards of the five 
companies, but the merger will become effective on 18 
August--the date on which Telecom Italia's stock market listing 
will replace that of SIP and Italcable. 
  Over 55 percent of Telecom shares will be in the hands of 
STET, 25 percent of shares will be in the hands of foreign 
investors, a little under three percent will belong to IRI, and 
17 percent to Italian investors. 
  Telecom will be the challenge of Italian state-controlled 
industry to the major world players on the telecommunications 
stage --a sector that in the year 2000 will represent two-thirds 
of the jobs in the industrial sector and whose interests will 
range from the good old telephone to cellular networks, from 
interactive television to multimedia markets. 
  [Liguoro] A short time ago, the Telecom Italia board was 
appointed. It is made up of nine people who previously worked 
for SIP, STET, IRI, and the Ministry of Posts and 
Telecommunications. In a surprise move, Ernesto Pascale will 
assume not only the role of company chairman, but also that of 
managing director. Filippo Galliano will be the deputy 
chairman, and the three general directors will be Vito 
Gamberale, Francesco Chirichigno, and (Tommaso Tommasi Di 
Vignano).

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "A Barrier Between Different </F>
Activities"] 
  [Text] Rome -- Concerning the Antitrust Commission and 
Fininvest: "The three experts," Antitrust Commission Chairman 
Francesco Saja explained, "should establish a barrier between 
public activities and entrepreneurial activities, or rather, I 
should say private activities." During the press conference 
given by the highest authority on competition, questions about 
Berlusconi and his group were snowballing. Saja explained: 
"The aim is to establish a dividing line between political 
activity and other activities. Let us hope they will be able to 
do so." 
  It is now up to the experts -- Antonio La Pergola, Giorgio 
Crisci, and Agostino Gambino -- to study the situation, and Saja 
was saying that "studying is always a good thing." However, he 
seemed "less than enthusiastic" about the solution adopted: 
"Let us hope they will be able to do something. Political 
power must be distinct from economic power. This is the 
objective." 
  What formula should be adopted? "Transferring his assets 
would be the most radical as well as the best solution." Could 
foreign models whereby the management of the assets is entrusted 
to a third party be effectively adopted? "They have 
limitations." What about the idea put forward by Andreatta 
[Italian Popular Party lower house floor leader], who invited 
Berlusconi to give the banks a mandate to sell? "A mandate 
would be required." What about the PDS's [Democratic Party of 
the Left] plan whereby anyone who has been granted a government 
concession should not be allowed to govern? "We must first be 
clear about what is meant by concession. A concession may also 
involve a small state-owned plot of land." 
  Concerning Fininvest, the PDS, and guarantees: On this point 
he is also engaged in a long-distance polemic with Fininvest 
chairman Fedele Confalonieri, who considered the progressive 
proposal "a little over the top," and who stated: "It is 
Fininvest that needs assurances, because now Berlusconi is 
devoting himself to his job as prime minister and he is 
relatively uninterested in us -- assurances that we can continue 
to work, without major cuts or hasty sellouts." Saja's reply to 
this: "Why, who owns Fininvest?"

<F P=106> [Report by Rosa Paz: "Gonzalez Calls on Socialists for Calm </F>
in Face of Tension"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- Felipe Gonzalez acknowledged yesterday 
that the Socialists are experiencing "a low, extremely 
difficult, point," and tried to encourage the Spanish Socialist 
Workers Party leaders and members to redouble their mobilization 
effort for the 12 June European elections. He also asked them 
to avoid increasing the social tension, which he said is being 
"fueled by the Right." Gonzalez made these remarks at the 
presentation of the Socialist list of candidates in the European 
elections. The meeting was attended by a thousand officials of 
his party, including the main leaders, but not Alfonso Guerra. 
The organizers did not fill the Conference Center auditorium. 
  "We are experiencing an extremely difficult time, a very 
delicate moment," Felipe Gonzalez asserted, "with considerable 
social tension, fueled by the Right. And we must make an 
enormous effort to mobilize all our members in order to explain 
what the 12 June elections mean, and do so without creating 
social tension; without falling into the dynamic of tension in 
the face of tension." 
<H5>  Stay in Touch </H5>
  The prime minister therefore added that despite the 
"personal 
harassment" to which the Right is subjecting him, "we must not 
become infected and must continue to convey calm and tolerant 
conduct" despite "the anguish and embarrassment" the Socialists 
feel at "some slippery conduct" and at having "placed trust in 
some people who have abused it." 
  He emphasized that "calm is important" at this difficult 
time, and announced: "I will stay calm and in touch with the 
situation. I am sometimes tempted to respond angrily to many of 
the things that are said, and could respond very toughly." 
"Therefore," he added, "I prefer to maintain a clear commitment 
to pursue the corruption cases -- those which exist and those 
which may emerge -- and to try to implement economic recovery, 
in order to continue the path of solidarity on which we have 
embarked, so there will be no turning back in this historic 
process which some people wish to stop." 
  He reiterated, as he did in Seville a week ago, that the 
Socialists are prepared to transform Spain and to restore 
international dignity to this country, "but we are not prepared 
to endure scoundrels in our ranks. We could not imagine it." 
And, on the other hand, he praised "the upright and honest 
conduct" of thousands of Socialist officials who have made 
possible Spain's transformation, which can be observed "by 
noting our country's image." 
  Given this political and social situation--which he 
acknowledged on several times--he warned the Socialists that 
they have ahead of them "a great challenge, which will not be 
easy, because we are experiencing a political situation of great 
difficulty and an economic crisis which is beginning to be 
overcome," although this is not yet perceived by the public. In 
order to encourage them, he asserted that they have "the best 
list for the European Parliament," considerable political 
experience, both domestically and in helping to develop European 
unity, and also a considerable responsibility to millions of 
citizens who have trusted the Socialists and "made this party 
the party which champions the values of freedom, equality, and 
solidarity." These arguments led him to assert that "if the 
electoral confrontation takes place on level ground, our success 
is assured." Nevertheless, he expressed his fear that the 
People's Party does not have that intention and is not 
interested in a debate on European issues, because "it has very 
little to offer, because they represent the negative tradition 
of turning our backs on Europe." 
  These were not his only criticisms of the Right. For 
instance, he also said that the Right "still has the same 
attitude of alarmism" and of refusing to see achievement, and he 
asserted that "they even refuse to acknowledge" the figures 
showing the beginning of economic recovery. He also hinted that 
the People's Party, which he at no point named, will try to 
conduct a dirty campaign. He also pointed out that 12 June is 
the ninth anniversary of the signing of Spain's treaty of 
accession to the EC, and asserted: "If we acted like others," 
referring to the Right, "we would spend our time recalling who 
accomplished this."

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Maria Brunet: "Government Takes Note of </F>
Anguita's Moderate Tone and Proposes New Agreements With United 
Left"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- The government takes note of the 
relatively moderate tone used by United Left [IU] in the latest 
parliamentary debates, Minister of the Prime Minister's Office 
Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba stated yesterday. The minister made 
this remark during an overall assessment of the political 
framework following Wednesday's [11 May] parliamentary session 
devoted to debating the Roldan affair and corruption. 
  According to Rubalcaba, it was made clear in the debate that 
the government stands by its intention to tackle corruption, and 
that it has stability to continue its work. At the same time, 
it is obvious that relations with the People's Party are 
experiencing a difficult time, although this does not mean that 
relations between the two main parliamentary forces have been 
severed. 
  So the main new development in the sphere of political 
relations stems from the fact that the government takes note of 
IU's stance in that session, and reiterates its desire to pursue 
agreements with Anguita on the matters on which it is possible. 
"The prime minister," Rubalcaba said, "has already expressed 
gratitude for the tone of Mr. Anguita's speech, which was 
different from that used by other parliamentary groups upholding 
the same political stance or the the same main aim (Felipe 
Gonzalez' resignation). Mr. Anguita used a radically different 
tone, which undoubtedly makes possible a different political 
debate and political dialogue. It is true that there are some 
agreements with IU, and it is not a characteristic of this 
latest stage of the legislative term, because there were already 
some agreements at the beginning. We have never concealed our 
desire to reach agreements with IU on the issues on which it is 
possible. There are certainly considerable differences -- for 
instance, on economic policy or on matters such as labor reform, 
except for the matter of trade union elections -- but there can 
be no doubt that there have been agreements on other matters. We 
will spare no efforts to ensure that those agreements can 
continue to occur." 
  Despite the toughness of the confrontation between Jose 
Maria 
Aznar and Felipe Gonzalez, the government asserts that not "all 
the bridges have been broken." "At the parliamentary level," 
Rubalcaba stated, "there are some relations. Nor is anybody 
unaware that relations with the People's Party are certainly not 
at their best, but that does not mean that there are no kind of 
relations with the People's Party. They are not smooth right 
now -- they are experiencing difficult circumstances -- but 
there are relations at levels other than those of the prime 
minister and the People's Party chairman." 
  In any event, the government believes it has a stable basis 
for continuing its work, and this has been made clear in the 
recent sessions in the Congress of Deputies. In short, the 
government emerged from Wednesday's debate on corruption with 
the conviction that it has been made clear that the nationalist 
forces are giving it "the parliamentary support needed to 
perform its work." 
  The government is in constant touch with those forces. A 
result of this has been the resumption of contacts with the 
Basque government in order to continue the process of a "joint 
reading" of the Basque autonomy statute. The Basque Nationalist 
Party complained a great deal about the blocking of the dialogue 
on autonomy. For its part, the government wishes at all costs 
to prevent the smooth relations with the nationalists being 
interpreted as a concession or quid pro quo for the support it 
receives from them, especially in view of the imminence of the 
election campaign. 
  Hence Rubalcaba was at pains yesterday to emphasize that the 
recent contacts with representatives of the Basque government 
stem from the pledge to enhance the government's autonomy 
policy, begun at the beginning of the legislative term. In 
keeping with this decision, the government yesterday passed a 
resolution admitting the autonomous communities to the Spanish 
committee on cooperation with UNESCO. 
  In addition, the government is beginning the European 
campaign by denying that its results can be interpreted as if it 
were a general election, Rubalcaba stated yesterday. With 
respect to the opinion polls forecasting an electoral victory 
for the People's Party in the coming European elections, Perez 
Rubalcaba stated that the government attaches great importance 
to them. 
  In addition, Rubalcaba added that the "it is not reasonable 
to seek to turn the European elections into something other than 
what they are: They are European elections, and the results 
should be assessed in that context." "Those who seek to infer 
other things from those elections," he continued, "will have to 
explain what nature or significance they attribute to that 
assessment."

  [Excerpts] Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari is very 
pleased with his visit to Russia, which ended today. [passage 
omitted] 
  President Martti Ahtisaari, unlike previous presidents, 
carried out his first official visit to Russia according to a 
short schedule. During his visit, which only lasted 25 hours, 
Ahtisaari had time to meet President Boris Yeltsin and Premier 
Viktor Chernomyrdin several times. This morning he met the 
leaders of both chambers of Parliament. On returning to 
Finland, Ahtisaari reiterated that there are no political 
problems between the two countries. 
  According to the president, future relations will be handled 
more and more between the parliaments. He cited as an example 
the exchange of visits by the Foreign Affairs Committees. 
[passage omitted] 
  According to the president, when Finland becomes a member of 
the European Union [EU], trade between Finland and Russia will 
be guided primarily by agreements between Russia and the EU. 
  The industrial delegation that accompanied Ahtisaari on his 
visit held talks with the Russians that concentrated on how the 
financing of individual deals could be guaranteed. There is 
currently no comprehensive system in Russia which would 
guarantee repayment of loans. No individual large deals were 
signed during the trip. 
  At the end of the presidential news conference given at 
Helsinki-Vantaa Airport, the president explained when asked what 
he did late last night. According to Ahtisaari, the atmosphere 
at the dinner was enlivened mainly by good orchestral music. 
After the dinner, which ended at about 2100, he had discussions 
with the Finnish industrial delegation. The president's night 
ended with a football match between AC Milan and Barcelona.

  [Text] The Greek Government has expressed the conviction 
that following the latest developments, the Cyprus issue has 
reached the point where the UN secretary general should assess 
the situation, determine who is responsible for it, and present 
a report to the Security Council. Greek Foreign Ministry 
Spokesman Konstandinos Bikas said alternative solutions to the 
Cyprus issue should also be examined, adding that it is not 
possible to continue the current time consuming process. This, 
he said, is necessary because of the continuing Turkish 
intransigence and the lack of political will, which were 
confirmed at the latest meeting between Gustave Feissel, the UN 
secretary general's deputy special representative in Cyprus, and 
[Turkish Cypriot Leader Rauf] Denktas.

  [Text] European Parliament President Egon Klepsch departed 
Cyprus this afternoon following the conclusion of his contacts 
with government and political party leaders. He said the 
European Parliament will support Cyprus' accession to the 
European Union [EU], and expressed the hope that in the future 
Cyprus will be united. The European Parliament, he added, has 
an obligation to do what it can to end the period of injustice 
and suffering which has prevailed in Cyprus for the last 20 
years. I know the pain, he underlined, because I am German and 
I know what it means for your city to be divided. 
  House of Representatives President Alexis Galanos, who 
accompanied Klepsch to Larnaca Airport, said Cyprus believes 
that even if the Turkish intransigence continues both on the 
substance of the Cyprus issue and on the confidence-building 
measures, the EU will give the green light to begin talks on our 
island joining the Union by the beginning of 1995. Galanos also 
expressed his gratitude and appreciation that the president of 
the European Parliament included Cyprus in his tour during an 
important period when there are many developments.

  [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis has reiterated that the 
Turkish side has proved beyond any doubt that it does not have 
the political will to permit an overall Cyprus settlement. This 
lack of political will, he noted, contributed to the current 
deadlock in the confidence-building measures. 
  Receiving the credentials of new German Ambassador to Cyprus 
Friedrich Garbers, President Kliridhis said he appreciated 
Germany's position in promoting a Cyprus solution and 
maintaining UNFICYP [UN Forces in Cyprus]. President Kliridhis 
stressed: The people of Cyprus look forward to the day when the 
Nicosia wall will be demolished, just like the Berlin Wall. 
  Presenting his credentials, the new German ambassador 
expressed the conviction that mutual trust is necessary between 
the two sides and added that it should be built soon through 
measures such as those proposed by the UN secretary general. He 
also said that the German Government welcomes the European 
Union's [EU] recognition of Cyprus' European identity, thus 
confirming the expectation of full accession to the EU. Garbers 
is 62, and a career diplomat. He has served in Milan, Helsinki, 
Nairobi, and Rome.

  [Text] Greece has rejected Turkey's demarche claiming that 
members of the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] are being 
trained on Greek territory. Government spokesman Evangelos 
Venizelos said the relevant Turkish deputy foreign minister 
summoned the Greek ambassador in Ankara and lodged a demarche, 
claiming that PKK members are being trained on Greek territory. 
  The spokesman stressed: Statements and demarches by Turkey 
that cause artificial tension have no meaning; Greece will not 
become an accomplice in creating an artificial climate of 
tension. Venizelos said: Greece condemns every act of violence 
and terrorism. There is no official representation of the PKK 
in our country. Greece is a pluralist state of law, with a 
legal order; whoever violates that legal order is punished. And 
he also noted that there is no reason for Turkey to attempt to 
export its domestic problems.

  [Text] Greece has not been accused of violating the embargo 
on Serbia and Montenegro, according to the Foreign Ministry. 
While the U.S. House of Representatives is safeguarding the 
7:10 ratio in military aid to Greece and Turkey, according to a 
proposal, it must first be established that the embargo is not 
being violated. 
  The Greek Government, the Foreign Ministry says, has taken 
all the necessary measures to maintain the sanctions against 
Serbia and Montenegro. 
  Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos noted that Greece 
and Serbia have no joint territorial border. He reiterated that 
Greece is not violating the embargo against Serbia and 
Montenegro and noted that the 7:10 ratio in U.S. aid to Greece 
and Turkey continues.

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Yeoryios Papandreou </F>
by Juan M. Amoros; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Amoros] What is the current 
state of the conflict between Greece and The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia [FYROM]? 
  [Papandreou] Right now there are talks under way with UN 
representative Cyrus Vance to try to break the deadlock in the 
negotiations and seek a solution to the problem still existing 
between our countries. For the present, we have proposed a 
package of measures to promote mutual trust, in which we 
reexamine the name issue. 
  [Amoros] Of what do those measures consist? 
  [Papandreou] On the one hand, Skopje should offer guarantees 
about the borders, as well as not using Greek symbols and 
eliminating any allusion to expansionist matters. It would also 
have to reinterpret some articles in its Constitution which 
refer to changing the borders. 
  For our part, we would immediately lift the measures that we 
have adopted. We would also urge that negotiations be held on 
Skopje's possible entry into the European Union [EU], assist in 
the implementation of joint programs with Europe and the EU, and 
normalize our relations. 
  [Amoros] Is Greece afraid of some action by Skopje? 
  [Papandreou] No, really no. We are not afraid that there 
could be a military confrontation. Indeed, there is no desire 
for that. What we wish to say is that any border dispute, any 
questioning of the borders by any of the sides, could create a 
widespread conflict involving many powers. 
  [Amoros] What were the reasons for imposing the Thessaloniki 
embargo? 
  [Papandreou] After two years of negotiations, we were hoping 
for some sign of goodwill on Skopje's part, but we found that 
Skopje was seeking the institutionalization of a de facto 
situation, and its stances were increasingly firm and 
inflexible. We therefore decided that there must be an immediate 
reaction, and that is why the embargo on using the port of 
Thessaloniki was decreed. 
  [Amoros] And what has been the effect of these sanctions? 
  [Papandreou] I am not very sure what the effect of these 
sanctions has been, but we can see that there is again some 
movement concerning the negotiations, and we hope that this will 
lead to progress in resolving the matter. 
  [Amoros] How does Athens assess the EU's harsh reaction to 
these sanctions? 
  [Papandreou] The Balkans is an area of Europe in which 
Greece believes that stability is essential, and so it must be 
ensured that all countries understand this. Greece wishes to 
convey the message that stability in the Balkans is essential 
for the stability of the whole of Europe, and that is something 
that not all countries have been able to grasp. 
  [Amoros] And if the sanctions fail? 
  [Papandreou] Well, for the present we are optimistic because 
the negotiations are beginning to move again. We hope for new 
results from Cyrus Vance's mediation, and believe that this time 
there will be a satisfactory final solution.

<F P=106> [News conference by Prime Minister Tansu Ciller to answer </F>
written questions from journalists following her introduction of 
the government democratization and restructuring plan in Ankara 
-- live; passages in italics spoken in English] 
  [Excerpts] Honorable friends: I will respond to the 
issues and the questions one by one. I will try not to overlook 
any of them. A journalist friend says: We see that the issues 
cited in the package are not bound by a schedule. Does this not 
create the impression that the package is nothing but an 
intention? 
  I cannot agree with this, because after a long study we 
analyzed about 60 laws, one by one. We agreed on the amendments 
that are necessary, starting from the Constitution. We are 
thinking of having these amendments passed in a very short time 
-- in fact, before the Assembly goes into recess. We are 
getting ready to do whatever is necessary to ensure that. 
Consequently, you can see that in the first stage, in their 
most basic lines, these issues have indeed been tied to a 
schedule. Second, we have determined the first 20 laws to be 
debated within this package. We did not name the date when the 
laws will be passed by the Assembly. We were not able to do 
that in the economic package either. As you see, the Assembly 
worked with great dedication and passed all the laws of the 
economic package. What is important is to start this working 
process. Sometimes, the Assembly needs more time to debate 
certain issues. Therefore, it is impossible to mortgage the 
behavior of the Assembly and tie it to a schedule. Our deputy 
friends worked with great dedication until late last night to 
pass all the laws to which we gave priority in the economic 
package. The important thing is to be determined and to convey 
to the Assembly the priority issues. The coalition government 
will stand behind these issues, and the True Path Party [TPP] 
and Social Democratic Populist Party [SDPP] deputies will work 
on these issues with great enthusiasm. We have determined the 
priorities, we have shown our determination, and we will 
continue to do whatever we can in connection with the Assembly 
debates on the issues, just as we did in connection with the 
economic package. 
  Another question asks if the issue of eight-year compulsory 
education was eliminated last night. No, we eliminated an 
article from the law, but the issue is not one of ending 
eight-year compulsory education. Our colleagues want us to 
debate the contents of the law. The TPP and SDPP deputies agree 
that there should be eight-year basic education. There is no 
question about that. They want us to study the legislation. 
That is what we will do. We have not given up on eight-year 
basic education. We consider it essential. 
  Will this package mean that in the future fewer writers 
and journalists will be persecuted for expressing their views? 
Well, I would feel that whatever the laws have dictated in 
Turkey, we have adhered to them -- and we had to -- but the 
basic thing is to limit all those prohibitions and lift the 
various prohibitions that exist in the laws. If there is a law, 
you implement the law. So what you need to do is to change the 
law to change the implementation, and that is what we are after. 
  At what stage, if any, will the coalition consider the 
idea of allowing Kurdish-language broadcasts and teaching in 
Kurdish? 
  As I have specified in our democratization program, 
reform program, we are not going to segregate or separate any 
ethnic group. Whatever will be done needs to be done for the 
whole country and for all our citizens. We are not going to 
separate or segregate the Kurdish people, the people in my 
country of Kurdish-origin. The needed steps that will be taken 
in the future will be comprehensive. It will include all of my 
citizens and will not segregate a certain area geographically or 
a certain group. It will be for the whole country, for all the 
people. 
  Another question is whether the state of emergency and the 
village guards system will be lifted, and if so, when. 
  The state of emergency is in force because it is necessary. 
For it to be lifted, first the necessary conditions must be 
secured, security must be ensured, and the law on provincial 
administrations must be passed. We approach this process stage 
by stage. Conditions of security have emerged in the southeast 
and in our provinces in the east. The state and the regional 
people have become united. Our government is continuing to 
implement every necessary measure with determination to ensure 
that this goes on. 
  Furthermore, the provincial administrations law is one of 
the 
first 20 laws to be debated. After the law is passed, it will 
be easier to lift the state of emergency. We will ensure that 
the necessary developments take place. 
  Another question is whether we are considering turning the 
compulsory religion class in school into an elective course. 
  The National Education Ministry will conduct a study on this 
issue. At the end of the study, the issue will be debated by 
the councils concerned and by our party assembly groups, and a 
conclusion will be reached. Before the study is completed, I 
cannot say that any decision has been reached. 
  Another question asks if we are working on a second 
democratization package. 
  Democratization is not a static matter; it is dynamic. It 
must continuously be changed and fed by the needs of the 
society. It is impossible for us to say that this is all there 
is to democracy in Turkey, that nothing else can be done, that 
nothing more or nothing less can be done, or that it is static. 
If there are any more needs in line with the development of the 
society and with the developments in general, then they will be 
discussed in line with the needs of the society. Today, that is 
what we foresee. [passage omitted] 
  Another question says: The agreements you reached with Mr. 
Karayalcin are undone by certain other alliances. Are you aware 
of this, or do you not have any control over your party's 
assembly group? 
  Let me say clearly that our friends in the TPP have been 
working very responsibly on all the issues we have announced, 
including the economic package and other matters. Naturally, a 
coalition means consensus, means conciliation. The two parties 
can have different views. We have had a very long series of 
conversations and dialogue to bring the two different views 
together. We will continue with this process. There is no 
other way, my honorable friends, because it was a coalition that 
emerged from this parliament. The coalition formed the 49th 
government and continues in the 50th government. We see that 
the consensus reached by this coalition is far more effective 
than the ones reached by previous coalitions. This coalition 
arrived at a variety of decisions. It made the most difficult 
decisions regarding the most difficult days of the government. 
It did so while meeting the needs of the economy on one hand 
and the democratization needs of the dynamic society on the 
other, while keeping everything under the umbrella of consensus. 
  I am not saying that we think the same way on every issue or 
that we do not disagree on any matter. This has happened in the 
past and will happen in the future. We try to achieve consensus 
whenever there is no agreement. We start dialogues. You have 
seen this. This will continue to be the case. As far as I am 
concerned, we are providing a very good example of democracy.

  [Text] Vienna, May 20 (AFP) -- North Korea has begun 
extracting fuel rods from its Yongbyon reactor in a "serious 
violation" of International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] 
inspection teams that will be reported to the UN Security 
Council, the IAEA said late Thursday [19 May]. 
  The removal of the rods, if not halted immediately, could 
wreck the IAEA's attempts to see if fuel had already been taken 
from the reactor, the IAEA said in a strong statement. 
  Washington wants the IAEA to check whether North Korea has 
been hiving off weapons-grade plutonium to make a nuclear bomb. 
  But the IAEA said: "As of today, it still seems possible to 
implement the required safety measures." 
  But it warned: "Should (North Korea) continue the discharge 
operation without these measures, it would result in irreparable 
loss of the Agency's ability to verify whether all nuclear 
material subject to safeguards in (North Korea) is in fact under 
safeguards and that no such material has been diverted." 
  The IAEA said it had sent a telex to North Korea on Thursday 
to complain that the discharge of fuel rods "constitutes a 
serious violation of the safeguards agreement" for monitoring 
nuclear facilities. 
  The statement said IAEA inspectors on site had "confirmed 
that core discharge has indeed started." 
  "The Agency has concluded that further discharge of fuel 
rods 
would jeopardise the possibility of the Agency applying 
safeguards measures necessry to verify whether any fuel has been 
diverted in the past." 
  The statement said the IAEA would report the violation to 
the 
United Nations Security Council. 
  "The Agency has asked (North Korea) to make arrangements 
promptly for the requisite safeguards measures and has urged 
that until these are in place, further discharge be deferred." 
  It said it wanted to send an IAEA team to the site 
immediately to discuss implementing the checks. 
  In Washington, President Bill Clinton said this week: "I 
think it would be an error for North Korea to continue to thwart 
these inspections after they have agreed to comply with them." 
  U.S. Defense Secretary, William Perry, said Wednesday that 
the United States faced "a very substantial near-term crisis" 
with North Korea. 
  The fuel rods in the reactor contains enough plutonium for 
four or five nuclear bombs, the Pentagon said. 
  North Korea has denied that it has a nuclear weapons program 
but has balked at international inspections. 
  The Central Intelligence Agency has estimated that North 
Korea withdrew enough plutonium in the late 1980s to make at 
least one nuclear device and that there is a more than 50 
percent chance it actually did so. 
  North Korea's continued refusal to abide by the IAEA's 
non-proliferation rules has led to international threats of UN 
sanctions, which in turn prompted war threats from Pyongyang. 
  North Korean President Kim Il-Sung, in his latest warning, 
said that North Korea would not bow to international pressure 
over its nuclear ambitions, saying that "pressure can never be a 
solution to the problem," according to the Korean Central News 
Agency (KCNA). 
  "If the United States continues to clamour to put pressure 
on 
our republic, we will be compelled to take due measures of 
self-defence to safeguard the dignity of our nation and the 
sovereignty of our country," added the leader of the Stalinist 
state.

  [Text] The following is the text of the Government's 
response to Sinn Fein: 
  Five months have passed since the British and Irish 
Governments published their Joint Declaration. 
  The Joint Declaration was framed as a balanced set of 
principles, fairly addressing the concerns and aspirations of 
both traditions in Northern Ireland. It demonstrated that, in 
their approach to Northern Ireland's future, the governments of 
the United Kingdom and of the Republic of Ireland stand on 
common ground. 
  The Declaration underlined the principle that the future of 
Northern Ireland must be founded on consent. If offered the 
people of Ireland, North and South respectively, the basis to 
agree that their differences could be negotiated and resolved 
exclusively by peaceful political means. 
  The Declaration looked to the full participation in politics 
of "democratically mandated parties which established a 
commitment to exclusively peaceful methods and which have shown 
that they abide by the democratic process". 
  To join the political dialogue with the two governments, 
parties were not required to accept the Joint Declaration. They 
were required only to declare and demonstrate a permanent end to 
violence, and to abide by the democratic process. 
  Since its adoption, the Joint Declaration has attracted very 
wide support thoughout Ireland and far beyond. More than ever, 
the people of Northern Ireland want to live in peace and to 
resolve their problems democratically and by negotiation. 
  Yet paramilitary and sectarian violence continues. They see 
no justification for this. The Joint Declaration shows that 
there is none. It is against this background that we are today 
publishing the questions from Sinn Fein, passed to us by the 
Irish Government, within this statement. 
  We have always sought to ensure that our position on the 
Joint Declaration is clearly understood by all. As both 
Governments have repeatedly emphasised, the terms of the 
Declaration are not open to negotiation. Nor will we enter into 
questions about future arrangements in Ireland which can 
properly be decided only through negotiations involving 
democratic parties dedicated exclusively to peaceful political 
means. 
  Both Governments are anxious to see such negotiations take 
place on a comprehensive basis, as set out in the Declaration. 
  Our comments on this document are as follows. 
  As will readily be seen, the questions which have been 
passed 
to us range much more widely than seeking elucidation of the 
text of the Joint Declaration, though some can be dealt with by 
reference to it. 
  The questions can be considered under these headings: 
  (i) Questions involving an explanation of the text of the 
Joint Declaration; (ii) Questions which appear to seek to 
reopen the negotiations which led to the Joint Declaration; 
  (iii) Questions concerning the British Government's policy 
in 
respect of Northern Ireland which, far from arising from any 
uncertainty about the text of the Joint Declaration, are 
answered by reference to it. 
  (iv) Questions not arising directly from the text of the 
Joint Declaration but concerning procedures consequent on a 
cessation of violence, including questions about the agenda for 
subsequent substantive political dialogue. 
  (v) Questions not arising from any obscurity in the text of 
the Joint Declaration but raising substantive questions of wider 
Government policy, or questions which would arise in a process 
of substantive political dialogue following a cessation of 
violence. 
  (vi) Questions repeating earlier questions or essentially 
covering the same ground. 
  These headings are dealt with in turn. There were 20 
questions in the (Sinn Fein) paper passed (to us) by the Irish 
Government, and the question numbers which follow are those from 
that paper. 
  I. Questions Involving an Explanation of the Text of the 
Joint Declaration. 
  Q. 4 The British Government says, in the Downing Street 
Declaration, "that they will uphold the democratic wishes of a 
great number of the people of Northern Ireland." What is the 
British Government's precise definition of "a greater number of 
the people of Northern Ireland" and how would this be measured 
in practical terms? 
<H5>  Comment </H5>
  The wish of a greater number of the people of Northern 
Ireland would be determined by a numerical majority of those 
validly voting in a poll fairly and explicitly organised for 
this purpose. Provision for such a poll is made in section 1 of 
the Northern Ireland Constitution Act: 1973. 
  II. Questions which appear to seek to reopen the 
negotiations which led to the Joint Declaration. 
  Q.2 Given that the document put to you in June 1993 was 
welcomed by the IRA leadership which commented, on October 3, 
1993, that it "could form the basis for peace", could you 
clarify the differences, if any, between this document and the 
Downing Street Declaration? 
<H5>  Comment </H5>
  This question, referring to a document put to us by the 
Irish 
Government, does not arise from any uncertainty about the text 
of the Joint Declaration which was the product of detailed and 
extensive discussions between the two Governments. 
  These discussions were largely directed towards ensuring 
that 
the Declaration was clear and unambiguous in its treatment of 
the key principles to which both Governments are committed -- 
including consent, agreement, and parity of esteem and equity of 
treatment for both parts of the community in Northern Ireland. 
  Therefore the only text that bears our name and on which we 
can comment is that which was issued on 15 December, 1993, by 
the Prime Minister and the Taoiseach [Irish Prime Minister 
Albert Reynolds] . 
  III. Questions concerning the British Government's policy 
in respect of Northern Ireland which, far from arising from any 
uncertainty about the text of the Joint Declaration are answered 
by reference to it. 
  Q.1 The long-term political objectives of the two 
Governments are of crucial importance if we are to move out of 
the conflict situation caused by the present failed political 
structures. 
  The Taoiseach has clearly stated the long-term objectives of 
the Irish Government in the search for a lasting settlement. It 
is essential that the British Government displays the same 
honesty and frankness in outlining its long-term attitude 
towards the Irish people. 
  What are the British Government's long-term interests and 
objectives in relation to Ireland? 
<H5>  Comment </H5>
  Paragraph 4 of the Joint Declaration already spells out the 
British Government's objectives and interests in relation to 
Ireland -- in terms which speak for themselves. In particular, 
it states that the British Government's "primary interest is to 
see peace, stability and reconciliation established by agreement 
among all the people who inhabit the island, and they will work 
together with the Irish Government to achieve such an agreement, 
which will embrace the totality of relationships." 
  Q.3 The British and Irish Governments have said that the 
political structures cannot be predetermined, now or in the 
future. How do you reconcile this with your adherence to the 
partition of Ireland and the maintenance of the union? 
  Paragraph 4 of the Joint Declaration makes it clear that the 
British Government "will uphold the democratic wish of a greater 
number of the people of Northern Ireland on the issue of whether 
they prefer to support the Union or a sovereign united Ireland." 
  Further, the Government reaffirm as a binding obligation 
that 
they will introduce the necessary legislation to give effect to 
any measure of agreement on future relationships in Ireland 
which the people living there, North and South, may themselves 
freely determine without external impediment. These statements 
confirm that in political dialogue no outcome is either 
predetermined or ruled out. 
  In relation to partition, both Governments are guided by the 
reality of the present situation and the principle of consent. 
This is reflected in Article 1 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, 
and in paragraph 7 of the Declaration: 
  "Both Governments accept that Irish unity would be achieved 
only by those who favour this outcome persuading those who do 
not, peacefully and without coercion or violence, and that, if 
in the future a majority of the people of Northern Ireland are 
so persuaded, both Governments will support and give legislative 
effect to their wish." 
  Q.7 Given the British Government's statement in the Downing 
Street Declaration that it is for the Irish people to exercise 
our right to self-determination, what is the basis for the 
British Government's qualification of this right in Paragraph 4 
of the Downing Street Declaration? 
<H5>  Comment </H5>
  The British Government's position on self-determination in 
paragraph 4 of the Joint Declaration -- that it is to be 
exercised "on the basis of consent, freely and concurrently 
given, North and South..." -- is entirely consistent with that 
of the Irish Government set out in Paragraph 5 of the Joint 
Declaration in which the Taoiseach: "accepts, on behalf of the 
Irish Government, that the democratic right of 
self-determination by the people of Ireland as a whole must be 
achieved and exercised with and subject to the agreement and 
consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland and 
must, consistent with justice and equity, respect the democratic 
dignity and civil rights and religious liberties of both 
communities." 
  IV. Questions not arising directly from the text of the 
Joint Declaration, but concerning procedures consequent on a 
cessation of violence, including questions about the agenda for 
subsequent substantive political dialogue. 
  Q.8 In the Downing Street Declaration the British Government 
gives a commitment to allow the Irish people to freely determine 
our future without external impediment or interference, to 
encourage, facilitate and enable agreement on this basis and to 
introduce the necessary legislation to give effect to this 
agreement. Does this mean that the Government of Ireland Act, 
Section 75 of which states "the supreme authority of the 
parliament of the United Kingdom shall remain unaffected and 
undiminished over all persons, and things in (Northern) Ireland 
and every part thereof," would be needed as part of an overall 
agreement? 
<H5>  Comment </H5>
  The content of an overall agreement will depend on the 
outcome of negotiations within the talks process. The British 
Government have confirmed that they wil introduce the necessary 
legislation to give effect to any measures of the agreement in 
future relationships which the people of Ireland may freely 
determine on the basis set out in paragraph 4 of the Joint 
Declaration. The implications for the Government of Ireland Act 
would depend on the nature and content of any such agreement. 
  Q.11 Given the commitment by the two governments that 
everything will be on the table for negotiation: 
  (a) Will the union between Ireland and Britain be on the 
agenda for negotiation? 
  (b) Will the Government of Ireland Act be on the agenda for 
negotiation? 
<H5>  Comment </H5>
  The 26 March 1991 statement, outlining the basis for the 
three stranded talks, said that "in order to ensure a full 
airing of the issues, it will be open to each of the parties to 
raise any aspect of these relationships, including 
constitutional issues, or any other matter which it considers 
relevant". No political objective could properly be excluded 
from discussion in the talks process. 
  Q.13 Does the British Government accept that while the 
consent of a majority of the people of the six county state to 
constitutional change, as referred to in the Downing Street 
Declaration, may be desirable it is not a legal requirement in 
international law? 
<H5>  Comment </H5>
  Both Governments make clear in the Joint Declaration that 
any 
change in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland would be 
subject to the consent of a majority of its people as set out in 
the Anglo-Irish Agreement, itself an international instrument 
registered at the United Nations. 
  Q.14 Given the commitment in the Downing Street Declaration 
to work towards a balanced constitutional accommodation does the 
British Government accept that the present structures and 
arrangements do not represent a balanced constitutional 
accommodation? [no comment on Q.14 as received] 
  Q.15 Given the commitment in the Downing Street Declaration 
to work towards a balanced constitutional accommodation, what 
constitutional options does the British Government see as being 
consistent with this objective? 
<H5>  Comment </H5>
  In paragraph 1 of the Joint Declaration both Governments 
recognise an "absence of a lasting and satisfactory settlement 
of relationships between the peoples of both islands...". 
Constitutional issues are among those eligible to be addressed 
in the talks process. 
  Q.17 The Taoiseach has said that political parties need not 
accept every phrase or word in the Downing Street Declaration. 
In fact the DUP [Democratic Unionist Party] have rejected the 
Declaration in total and the UUP [Ulster Unionist Party] have 
said that it has run its course. 
  (a) Does the rejection of the Declaration by a political 
party exclude that party from involvement in talks on the 
development of new political arrangements? 
  (b) Do parties which are opposed to aspects of the Downing 
Street Declaration have the right to dissent from it and yet be 
engaged in talks on the development of new political 
arrangements? 
<H5>  Comment </H5>
  The Declaration is an agreed position between the two 
Governments. It does not depend for its validity on the 
attitude of other parties, who are free to determine their own 
views on it, and to represent those views in future negotiations. 
  Acceptance of the Joint Declaration is not a precondition 
for 
entering the talks process. What IS required is a permanent end 
to the use of, or support for, paramilitary violence. The two 
Governments say in the Joint Declaration that "...in these 
circumstances, democratically mandated parties which establish a 
commitment to exclusively peaceful methods and which have shown 
that they abide by the democratic process, are free to 
participate fully in democratic politics and to join in dialogue 
in due course between the Governments and the political parties 
on the way ahead." 
<H5>  Q.18 Exploratory Dialogue </H5>
  Sinn Fein, as a matter of policy, advocates inclusive 
dialogue without preconditions. We do not accept the imposition 
of preconditions on our party or on any other party. However, 
in the interests of clarity we wish to explore the British 
Government position on these matters as outlined in the Downing 
Street Declaration. 
  (a) The British Government has called upon Sinn Fein to 
renounce violence. What does this involve? 
  (b) Patrick Mayhew is reported as saying that a permanent 
cessation of violence "is the way in which full recognition can 
be accorded to the mandate which Sinn Fein candidates are 
accorded at the polls" (Irish Times, Thursday, 14/4/94). How 
does the British Government reconcile its refusal to recognise 
our democratic mandate with its stated commitment to democratic 
principles? 
  (c) The British Prime Minister has referred to a period of 
decontamination for Sinn Fein. What does this mean? 
  (d) What would be the purpose of the exploratory dialogue 
between Sinn Fein and the British Government? 
  (e) How long would this exploratory dialogue last? 
  (f) Within this process, when would negotiations about the 
future constitutional and political shape of Ireland take place? 
<H5>  Comment </H5>
  The position of both Governments is set out clearly in 
Paragraph 10 of the Joint Declaration. There has to be a 
permanent end to the use of, or support for, paramilitary 
violence. In these circumstances "democratically mandated 
parties which establish a commitment to exclusively peaceful 
methods and which have shown that they abide by the democratic 
process, are free to participate fully in democratic politics 
and to join in dialogue in due course between the Governments 
and the political parties on the way ahead." 
  For Sinn Fein and the IRA this would involve a public and 
permanent renunciation of violence as a means of achieving 
political ends, and commitment to peaceful and democratic means 
alone. 
  Within three months, as has already been publicly made 
clear, the British Government would in these circumstances begin 
exploratory dialogue with Sinn Fein. The purposes of such 
dialogue would be: 
  (i) to explore the basis upon which Sinn Fein would come to 
be admitted to an inclusive political talks process to which the 
British Government is committed but without anticipating the 
negotiations within that process; 
  (ii) to exchange views on how Sinn Fein would be able over a 
period to play the same part as the current constitutional 
parties in the public life of Northern Ireland; 
  (iii) to examine the practical consequences of the ending of 
violence. 
  The reason for the time lapse between a permanent cessation 
of violence and exploratory dialogue is to enable the commitment 
to exclusively peaceful and democractic methods to be fully 
demonstrated. 
  The British Government accept the validity of all electoral 
mandates, including that of Sinn Fein; and, being committed to 
the democratic process, endorses the freedom of voters to choose 
their elected representatives. There is no inconsistency 
between this and requiring that all who join in political 
dialogue should demonstrate a commitment to exclusively peaceful 
methods and to the democratic process. Democracy and violence 
cannot be reconciled. 
  Q.20 The Downing Street Declaration is described as "the 
starting point of a peace process designed to culminate in a 
political settlement." What are the subsequent steps which the 
British Government envisages as part of a process of dialogue, 
reconciliation and demilitarisation leading to peace and a 
political settlement? 
<H5>  Comment </H5>
  Paragraphs 10 and 11 of the Joint Declaration and associated 
statements (see comment on Question 18 above) spell out what 
will happen when there is a permanent cessation of violence. 
The exploratory dialogue leading to Sinn Fein's involvement in 
the political talks process would then begin. A lasting and 
general peace would render military operations in support of the 
police no longer necessary. 
  If the Joint Declaration is "the starting point of a peace 
process," the next step is for the violence to end for good. 
  V. Questions not arising from any obscurity in the text of 
the Joint Declaration, but raising substantive questions of 
wider Government policy, or questions which would arise in a 
process of substantive political dialogue following a cessation 
of violence. 
  Q.5 The British Government has said that it has "no selfish 
strategic or economic interest in Northern Ireland." Would it 
not be more in accord with democratic principles for the British 
Government to base its Irish policy on the objective of ending 
the union? 
<H5>  Comment </H5>
  The Joint Declaration makes it clear that the British 
Government is committed to upholding the principle of consent. 
  Q.6 The British Government has said that its primary 
interest is to see agreement reached between all the Irish 
people. 
  (a) Given the continued intransigent attitude of the 
Unionist 
leadership, how, in real terms, is such an agreement to be 
reached, particularly if the unionist leadership refuses to 
engage in the search for agreement? 
  (b) What is the framework which the British Government 
intends to create for the achievement of agreement. [no graf (c) 
as received] 
  (d) Does the British Government accept that, given the 
weight 
of nationalist opinion throughout Ireland in opposition to 
partition, that substantial movement on constitutional issues by 
the British Government and the Unionist Parties will be required 
if democratic agreement is to be reached? 
  e) How is agreement to be measured in practical terms and at 
what stage does the withholding or absence of agreement on the 
part of one section of the Irish people become a veto over 
change? 
<H5>  Comment </H5>
  In Paragraph 4 of the Joint Declaration, the British 
Government commits itself to working together with the Irish 
Government to achieve peace, stability and reconciliation 
established by agreement among all the people who inhabit the 
island and to "encourage, facilitate and enable the achievement 
of such agreement...". No organisation has a veto over that 
process, whether by withdrawing from it or by refusing to 
renounce violence. The two Governments will continue to seek 
agreement between themselves and the main constitutional parties 
in Northern Ireland on the basis of the agreed statement of 26 
March 1991 -- focusing on the three main relationships which are 
those within Northern Ireland, among the people of the island of 
Ireland and between the two Governments. A keynote of the Joint 
Declaration is that any new arrangements must be founded on 
consent. It would be wrong to attempt to anticipate the outcome 
of the discussions or to set an artificial time limit on the 
achievement of agreement on issues of fundamental importance to 
the people of these islands. Other issues raised in this 
question are properly the concern of participants in the process 
of political dialogue. 
  Q.16 The Taoiseach has said that Unionists possess a veto 
only in regard to whether to belong to a sovereign United 
Ireland or the UK, that they do not possess a veto over the 
policy of the two governments or over interim measures which may 
be adopted. Is this also the position for the British 
Government? 
<H5>  Comment </H5>
  No group or organisation has a veto over the policy of a 
democratically elected Government. The policy of both 
Governments, set out in the Joint Declaration, is however, 
founded firmly on the principles of democracy, agreement and 
consent. 
  Q.19 (a) Given the declared opposition of both Governments 
to coercion, how will the coercion of Northern nationalists 
into the six county state be addressed in real terms? 
  (b) How will the denial of nationalist rights be redressed 
in real terms? 
  (c) When will repressive legislation be ended? 
<H5>  Comment </H5>
  This question is based on assumptions which have no 
foundation in reality. The Government's approach is reflected 
by paragraph 4 of the Joint Declaration which includes the 
statement that: 
  "The role of the British Government will be to encourage, 
facilitate and enable the achievement of... agreement over a 
period through a process of dialogue and co-operation based on 
full respect for the rights and identities of both traditions in 
Ireland." 
  It is the clearly declared aim of both Governments that ALL 
new arrangements agreed in the course of political dialogue 
should be based on consent. An end to violence would open the 
way for a comprehensive reassessment of existing provisions 
against terrorism, many of which would become irrelevant and 
obsolete in a climate of peace. 
  VI. Questions repeating earlier questions or essentially 
covering the same ground. 
  Q.9 How does the British Government reconcile its stated 
objective of maintaining the union with its declared lack of 
strategic or economic interest in Ireland? 
  Q.10 Given the British Government's declared lack of 
"selfish 
strategic or economic interest in Northern Ireland," what is the 
British Government's political interest in "Northern Ireland"? 
<H5>  Comment </H5>
  These points are covered in comment on questions 1 and 8. 
  Q.12 Given the statement by the British Government in the 
Downing Street Declaration that "it is for the people of the 
island of Ireland alone, by agreement between the two parts 
respectively, to exercise their right of self-determination on 
the basis of consent," 
  (a) Is the continued operation of the Government of Ireland 
Act subject to agreement on this basis? 
  (b) Is the continued existence of the union subject to 
agreement on this basis? 
<H5>  Comment </H5>
  There is nothing to add to the comments given above. 
Paragraph 4 of the Joint Declaration could not spell out more 
clearly the position in relation to the Union. 
<H5>  The Question for Sinn Fein </H5>
  Sinn Fein have asked their questions. But the most 
fundamental question being asked by the people of these islands 
is for them to answer. Democracy and violence cannot be 
reconciled. Sinn Fein must choose. They know what they have to 
do if they are effectively to fulfil their democratic mandate. 
The democratic path leads to a meaningful role in the political 
process: a process in which, as has been explained, all issues 
are open for discussion and negotiation. The alternative is 
isolation -- standing on the outside while those committed to 
democracy shape the agreement, structures and institutions that 
will determine the relationships between the peoples of these 
islands. 
  Sinn Fein claim a commitment to the principle of self- 
determination. That means abiding by the will of the people. 
The vast majority of people in Ireland, North and South and of 
both traditions, demand an end to violence now. Their wishes 
could not be clearer. There is no conceivable justification for 
continuing to rob people of their lives, least of all a call for 
a textual explanation of the Joint Declaration. 
  Sinn Fein ask what comes next. Certainly no further playing 
for time. If the Joint Declaration is "the starting point of a 
peace process", the next step is for violence to end for good.

  [Excerpt] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- The Bundesrat called upon Bonn 
to deepen and strengthen the European Union [EU] during the 
German EU presidency in the second half of 1994. In that 
context, the government should in particular work toward greater 
closeness to the people, democracy, and strengthening the Union 
externally to allow the swift admission of the European Free 
Trade Association states. 
  Cooperation with the Central and East European states has to 
be moved forward, German must be recognized as an official EU 
language, and the European Parliament must be strengthened. All 
the laender endorsed a resolution underlining their joint 
responsibility for preparing "the important task of the German 
presidency of the Council." 
  Saarland Prime Minister Oskar Lafontaine (SPD) stressed that 
all those questioning European integration were jeopardizing the 
stability of the continent and facilitating nationalism. The 
most important task is to combat widespread unemployment by 
creating new jobs. Democracy also means access to work.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Alain Juppe by </F>
correspondent Franz-Olivier Giesbert in the Paris studio -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Giesbert] Good morning, Mr. Juppe. Now, you 
are rejoicing that the 11 Premiere Urgence hostages held by the 
Bosnian Serbs were released yesterday evening. We have to say 
that this is a victory for French diplomacy. 
  [Juppe] It is a victory for the French Government, which has 
spared no effort for nearly two months now, from the moment we 
learned about this hostage-taking -- and I was the one who 
described it as such from the very beginning. We immediately 
started to make repeated diplomatic approaches. 
  [Giesbert] There is one problem: The hostages were released 
on bail. It is a kind of extortion, isn't it? 
  [Juppe] Wait, let me finish. We made repeated diplomatic 
approaches of all kinds -- in Belgrade, in Sarajevo, in Pale; we 
ourselves, through the Greek presidency of the European Union, 
with the support of Lord Owen, the international mediator, and 
also a number of great powers who helped us. [passage omitted] 
  We knew several days ago -- I said it myself in Washington 
-- 
that these diplomatic approaches were going to bear fruit. This 
is the only method used by the Foreign Ministry. I learned 
later -- as you did, indeed -- that Premiere Urgence paid what 
it called bail. It bears the responsibility for that, and it is 
not for me to comment. 
  [Giesbert] 280,000 francs? 
  [Juppe] That is the figure I heard, as you did. 
  [Giesbert] There has been this (?success), but at the same 
time no one can understand France's strategy in Bosnia. 
  [Juppe] I understand it perfectly well. I hope I can 
enlighten you. 
  [Giesbert] Francois Leotard said on Europe 1: We are going 
to 
withdraw our troops. You replied right away: It is more 
complicated than that. Then Eduard Balladur came along and gave 
a sort of synthesis: Perhaps we will, perhaps we won't. Can you 
explain the [word indistinct] position? [passage omitted] 
  [Juppe] There is a perfect consensus. What is our position? 
Actually it is perfectly well known, if you do not want to 
create artificial problems where they do not exist. 
  For several months we have had about 6,000 men in Bosnia, on 
the ground in Bosnia, and indeed in the whole of former 
Yugoslavia -- I am thinking of Croatia. We increased our troops 
in Sarajevo temporarily a few weeks ago, sending an extra 1,000 
men. At the time it was planned that this reinforcement would 
only be temporary. So we are cutting 1,000 men, withdrawing a 
battalion from Glina. That is clear. 
  The second thing is that we have warned the United Nations 
-- 
because you have do it in advance -- that we are planning to 
withdraw from Bihac at the end of the year. This is an area of 
Bosnia where in fact we are keeping Muslim forces apart. This 
decision has not yet taken definitive shape, since it is for the 
end of the year. So all three of us said exactly the same thing. 
  [Giesbert] What do you think of the intervention by 
intellectuals on the debate over Bosnia? 
  [Juppe] It is their right, and I would even say that in a 
way 
it is their duty. Nevertheless, as you know, we do not share 
the same analysis. [passage omitted] 
  The situation in Bosnia today -- provisionally, perhaps, so 
we have to be very careful, because the embers are still alive 
under the ashes -- the situation has stabilized. And we owe 
this to France and the EU. It is a great advance compared with 
what was happening only a few months ago. 
  So today we have a very clear choice: Either we rekindle the 
war -- and as far as I am concerned, supplying arms to all the 
belligerents means rekindling the war -- or else we try to make 
peace. My personal obsession is to make peace. 
  [Giesbert] If there really were no more war, as you are 
saying, tell me frankly: Would Francois Leotard be suggesting 
the withdrawal of French peacekeeping forces? 
  [Juppe] I do not see the connection. 
  [Giesbert] Because there are risks to be taken. Why would 
the French withdraw from the Bihac region, for example? Is it 
not because it is dangerous? 
  [Juppe] You think it is because it is dangerous that we are 
withdrawing from Bihac? We shall perhaps withdraw from Bihac at 
the end of the year, simply because we want to concentrate our 
forces at Sarajevo, where the dangers are much greater than in 
Bihac. I would not accuse French soldiers of cowardice, Mr. 
Giesbert. 
  [Giesbert] Nor would I. 
  [Juppe] Nor would the French Government. It is not because 
Bihac is dangerous that we are going. It is because we want to 
be consistent. And being consistent means reinforcing our 
troops in Sarajevo as we have been doing for several months. 
  I would like to come back to the choice: war or peace. I 
think today we really do have a choice between war and peace. 
The only way to make peace is to try to convince the sides to 
sit down at the negotiating table to advance along the bases of 
the plan that the Americans, the Russians, and all the 
Europeans, the Twelve, unanimously, proposed. [passage omitted] 
  [Giesbert] Mr. Juppe, if we withdraw, Michel Rocard says 
that 
the embargo on arms for the Bosnians should be lifted. 
  [Juppe] I think the problem should be put exactly the other 
way round. It is that if the embargo is lifted, then we should 
withdraw our troops. If we were to lift the embargo today, 
there would be more fighting. That is quite obvious. And in 
such a case, of course, we should not be able to keep our 
peacekeeping troops among the belligerents. We would have to 
withdraw them. There would be offensives again -- in Sarajevo, 
in Gorazde, or elsewhere -- and we would see things getting to 
the point where the Bosnian Muslims find themselves in 
difficulty and then who will they call on to help them? 
  [Giesbert] You favor compromise. Everyone favors compromise. 
But from compromise to compromise, are we not giving Bosnia to 
the Serbs? 
  [Juppe] I do not think so. [passage omitted] Fifty-one 
percent goes to the Croat-Muslim Federation, and 49 percent to 
the Serbs who today occupy more than 70 percent of the 
territory. That means that they must withdraw from more than 20 
percent of the territory that they have conquered by force. 
  [Giesbert] Mr. Juppe, you are now going to Moscow. What are 
you hoping for from your meeting with Boris Yeltsin? 
  [Juppe] First of all, I would like to convince Boris Yeltsin 
of France's desire to conduct a policy of close cooperation and 
openness with Russia. We must not leave Russia in its corner. 
It is a great power, and will remain one. 
  Second, of course, we shall talk about Bosnia. There has 
been great progress in the fact that Russian diplomacy has 
joined with us around the same table to put forward the same 
plan. We have to strike while the iron is hot. I must tell you 
that we should be having another meeting on 13 June -- we, the 
foreign ministers, the same group that met in Geneva a few days 
ago -- in other words, in three weeks' time, and there perhaps 
we shall have a moment of decision again. 
  If nothing has happened between now and then, if there has 
been no progress along the path to peace, if we see that no 
settlement seems to be in view, then, as the French prime 
minister said, France must draw the obvious conclusions. 
  [Giesbert] A new NATO offensive? 
  [Juppe] I did not say that. I said that we should have to 
think of moving on to something completely different. 
  [Giesbert] Meaning? 
  [Juppe] We shall speak of it at the right time. 
  [Giesbert] Can we not speak of it now? 
  [Juppe] You know very well that we have indicated the 
direction in which we are looking. We cannot leave our 
peacekeeping forces on the ground indefinitely. If the people 
for whom they are there, if these people and governments do not 
want to make peace, there is no reason to leave our peacekeeping 
forces there indefinitely. That is what will be at stake 
between now and the end of June or beginning of July. 
  [Giesbert] Have a good trip, Mr. Juppe.

<F P=106> [Report by Stefano Maroni: "Things Could Not Have Gone </F>
Better"] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- [passage omitted] At Botteghe Oscure 
[Democratic Party of the Left, PDS, headquarters] they had not 
cherished any false hopes about the results in the Senate. On 
the contrary, as PDS Secretary Occhetto explained: "We were 
ready to be in the opposition, we expected Berlusconi to obtain 
a majority eventually, in the same way that he managed to obtain 
one when [Senate speaker] Scognamiglio was elected. However, a 
month after that vote was taken, the result is an unexpected 
confirmation of the opposition's resilience in the face of the 
intense maneuvering that has taken place. It was clearly 
apparent from Berlusconi's speech (you could tell from the tone 
he used) that he believed he had a safer majority in the bag. 
The situation, however, is rather different: The newly formed 
government is the expression of a slender majority, and it will 
not have an easy life." 
  Occhetto had no doubt. As he got ready to put the finishing 
touches on his contribution to today's debate in the lower 
house, he confidently expounded a line of reasoning which was 
both a "What is to be done?" for the PDS and a polemic against 
those who had been tormenting him over the past few weeks: 
"This vote," he explained, "represents a twofold advantage for 
us. On the one hand, it sanctions the transition to a democracy 
based on alternation: We have witnessed the formation of both 
an executive which has the mandate to govern the country, and an 
opposition which has the duty to control the executive's 
performance. On the other hand, the vote confirms that the 
government has come into being in a situation of serious 
numerical, as well as political, weakness. The opposition can 
rely not only on the 60 percent of Italians who did not vote for 
the right-wing coalition, but also on a strong, solid base in 
parliament. This confirms that the Left's great and shattering 
defeat which is being spoken and written about is not, after 
all, so great and shattering. This much is apparent from the 
figures, and only the majority's rhetoric and self-flagellation 
which some people indulge in on the Left," Occhetto added with 
his numerous critics in mind, "can lead anybody to believe the 
contrary." 
  The PDS leader was thus pleasantly surprised and doubtlessly 
satisfied at what he defined as "the Italian Popular Party's 
[PPI] resilience." He stressed that this was an important fact, 
"an encouraging factor for those who aim to open a new political 
stage in our country." The Knight [Berlusconi nickname] did not 
win over the center, and this "highlights the element of 
political weakness in the Right." "Clearly," Occhetto argued, 
"the Right is beset by serious political and programmatic 
contradictions. During the debate, Berlusconi unsuccessfully 
tried to overcome them by means of rhetorical and propagandist 
subterfuges, instead of providing politically convincing answers 
and clear indications about his platform. But probably there 
was little else he could do." 
  However, Occhetto was very cautious when it came to 
suggesting any political indications from the PPI's confirmed 
intention not to join the Knight's bandwagon: "After this 
vote," he explained, "we will be able to do whatever can rightly 
be done with the PPI. Overall, the opposition's strength and 
solidity have been confirmed. However, it is important for us 
not to get jumbled together in a single melting pot -- which 
indeed the PPI is not prepared to do -- and to fully respect 
each party's identity and autonomy while developing a rigorous, 
serious, and purposeful opposition. This, of course, does not 
rule out the possibility of finding important areas of agreement 
with the center. In particular, I hope we can agree on 
institutional matters and on the equally decisive issue of 
safeguarding democratic guarantees." 
  From Palazzo Madama [Senate], Cesare Salvi [progressives 
floor leader] and [PDS Senator] Claudio Petruccioli echoed the 
secretary's words: "The government only made it by one vote, 
the usual single vote," remarked Calvi. "But, despite the 
resources at its disposal, the majority will find it 
increasingly difficult to find such a vote every time a vote is 
taken in the Senate -- which basically means always..." 
Petruccioli also referred to "a second edition of 
Scognamiglio's election," but he added that "the government must 
become aware that it does not have a majority here, and that it 
cannot seriously contemplate continuing to resort to this kind 
of expedient in the future, as it has done once again on this 
occasion. Above all," the PDS senator concluded, "the 
government must renounce the arrogance of believing that it owns 
the assembly, which, as mater of fact, it does not, because it 
does not have a majority..."

  [Text] In Copenhagen today, Danish Prime Minister Poul 
Rasmussen received the president of the republic of Kosova, Dr. 
Ibrahim Rugova, who is touring several European countries. 
  At today's meeting with Danish Prime Minister Rasmussen, 
President Rugova gave a briefing on the situation in Kosova. He 
stressed that over the last five years a campaign of Serbian 
violence has been continuing in Kosova, and this represents a 
danger to the region. 
  The president of the republic of Kosova went on to brief the 
Danish prime minister on the Albanians' political aim of an 
independent and neutral Kosova, as being the best solution to 
the Kosova problem. He stressed that the people of Kosova have 
expressed their own will through a referendum and through other 
institutional acts and that they are waiting for international 
support in implementing this will. 
  President Rugova said that they had expressed their 
readiness 
for a dialogue with Belgrade in the presence of a third party. 
Denmark, which plays an important role in the European Union, 
can make a contribution to resolving this issue, president 
Rugova said, thanking the Danish prime minister for the interest 
that his country has so far shown in the Kosova question and 
regional problems. 
  In his speech, Danish Prime Minister Rasmussen stressed that 
it was an honor to meet with Dr. Rugova and that he knew the 
Kosova problem well. He said that the European Union was 
worried about the situation in Kosova and that, within this 
framework, Denmark would continue with its commitment. He said 
that Denmark would exert pressure for the return of the CSCE 
observers to Kosova and a resolution of this matter. He 
expressed his support for the peaceful policy of president 
Rugova and the Kosovar people on the road to realizing their 
aspirations. Danish Prime Minister Rasmussen promised that 
Denmark would be active in this direction. 
  After the reception and the friendly talks held with the 
Danish prime minister, the president of the republic of Kosova, 
Dr. Ibrahim Rugova, addressed the members of the Foreign Policy 
Committee of the Danish Parliament. 
  Tomorrow, president Rugova is expected to meet Danish 
Foreign 
Minister Niels Helveg Petersen and other Danish officials. It 
is reported that today Dr. Rugova gave several interviews to the 
Danish press.

  [Text] Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis has said 
that Rauf Denktas' ongoing statements about progress in the 
confidence-building measures are part of his tactics to avoid 
being accused of responsibility for the deadlock by the UN 
secretary general's report. Kasoulidhis added: On the basis of 
the official briefing by Gustave Feissel, no progress was made 
in Vienna. The spokesman made it clear that the Cypriot 
Government does not want to discuss with the United Nations or 
anybody else anything beyond the 21 March document, which the 
Cypriot side has accepted as it stands. Kasoulidhis noted: Any 
talk with us is out of context, since the negotiations are being 
held with the other side. 
  Answering a question, the government spokesman said there is 
no information about the United Nations having amended the 21 
March document, and added that the time limits the Security 
Council set for discussing the confidence-building measures have 
expired. Kasoulidhis stressed: What is expected following the 
UN secretary general's report is to determine alternative ways 
of promoting the UN resolutions. Our side will cooperate only 
through this process.

<F P=106> [Statement by Prime Minister Tansu Ciller to introduce the </F>
government democratization and restructuring plan, in Ankara -- 
live] 
  [Text] My dear colleagues and valued representatives from 
our press and television. I respectfully greet you all. 
  The coalition governments established by the two big central 
right parties and the central left party following the 1991 
elections made a great promise to our people. This was a 
promise of democratization and restructuring. The activities 
undertaken by the 49th government on this issue have now 
achieved a comprehensive entirety and a concrete essence as a 
result of the democratization and restructuring plan the 50th 
government is announcing today. 
  Our world will enter a new century in six years. It is 
natural and necessary for Turkey, which experienced a great leap 
in the 20th century with a lot of effort and unfaltering 
conviction, to get ready for a new leap. Turkey will have 
another encounter with history. Since the establishment of our 
republic we have made achievements in all fields of our social 
life of which we can really be proud. We have achieved great 
developments. No one can deny this. I would like to state with 
gratitude and appreciation that all previous governments have 
exerted efforts and have a share in these developments. Our 
world, however, is rapidly changing and being restructured. 
Turkey, on the other hand, needs to change at a faster pace. 
Naturally, our people's expectations have increased. When we 
come to think of it, we were a nation of 13 million, most of 
whom were living in villages and rural areas with little 
involvement in world developments. Now our population exceeds 
60 million. Most of our citizens live in cities and urban 
areas. Our youth are especially well aware of world 
developments. They aspire for the same rights and opportunities 
granted to the people of the contemporary world. They, 
therefore, have expectations and rightfully so. It is not 
possible nor is it right to keep our people within narrow 
confines. From time to time there are calls for advancement 
from all sectors of our community and from all parts of our 
country. A new leap is needed in Turkey. We should be entering 
the 21st century as a contemporary and productive country with 
an equitable distribution of wealth and in which human rights 
and democratic freedoms are being fully exercised. 
  The economic stability and restructuring program which we 
announced on 5 April might well be the most comprehensive in our 
country's history. We are implementing the 5 April decisions 
with strong convictions and determination. We will not allow 
for any deviations. The current passing difficulties should not 
discourage anyone. The economic measures we have taken are, 
step by step, reaching their goals. By the end of the first 
three-month implementation period everyone will realize that 
better results will be achieved. 
  The aim of the 18 May decisions, which we are announcing 
today, is to provide a brand new structural framework for Turkey 
-- politically, administratively, and socially. The two main 
approaches that will be used to bring about this process are: 
first, amendments to the Constitution and its laws; second, the 
seventh five-year development plan for 1995-1999 to which we 
attach great importance. 
  I would like to discuss first the Constitution and then the 
envisaged amendments to the laws. The government will support 
removing all constitutional, legislative, or de facto deterrents 
to freedom of thought and expression in our country. We want 
all of these obstacles and difficulties eliminated. We think 
that this is an essential element of a democratic society that 
respects its people. 
  We cannot ignore Turkey's Constitution during the process of 
democratization. We are all aware that the Turkish Republic was 
guided by three different constitutions over 70 years. Today, 
the Constitution of 1982 lags behind the process of 
democratization and restructuring. For this reason, we need a 
new constitution to meet the expectations and ideals of a 
democratic civilian society; a constitution that will include 
the characteristics of democratic institutions found in the 
Western world and that will also provide for the participation 
of its citizens. This constitution, by recognizing and 
determining basic rights and freedoms, has to be based on a 
democratic framework. 
  For these reasons, we believe that we have to start our 
democratization program with a new constitution. Experts from 
the two parties that are partners in the coalition government 
worked intensively on the problems involved in creating a new 
draft constitution and they will continue to do so. During the 
next three months, we will hold discussions with the other 
political parties on the draft constitution and the discussions 
will be open to the public. Following these assessments, the 
new draft constitution will be submitted to the Turkish Grand 
National Assembly [TGNA]. 
  I call on all political parties and public institutions to 
cooperate in drawing up a civil and democratic constitution. 
  Honorable members of the press, undoubtedly preparing a new 
constitution will take time. We propose the following: 
  Regarding Article 67 of the Constitution -- already existing 
and approved by the TGNA -- on the right to vote, to be elected, 
and to conduct political activities, we propose the right to 
vote and participate in a referendum for all Turkish citizens 
who are 18 and older and the right to vote for Turkish citizens 
living abroad. 
  Regarding Article 68 on political party legislation, we 
propose reducing the membership age for political parties from 
21 to 18 and that permission be granted to establish auxiliary 
organizations such as women's or youth groups to encourage a 
participatory and pluralistic democracy. 
  In Article 69, on the principles by which political parties 
have to be governed, we propose eliminating all restrictions on 
cooperation and relationships between political parties and 
trade unions, professional organizations, syndicates, waqf's, 
corporations, and public institutions. 
  As to Article 76, on the requirements for running for the 
post of deputy, we propose reducing the minimum age to be 
elected deputy from 30 to 25. 
  We want these amendments to take effect as soon as possible. 
Work is under way to achieve this. 
  In addition, in Article 82, we think that the ban on 
deputies' not being able to serve in professional organizations 
and trade unions should be removed. We also envisage eliminating 
the restrictions in Article 84 regarding the resignations of 
TGNA members. 
  Regarding Article 135, we believe in removing the laws which 
foresee the abolition of professional establishments on the 
contention that they are politically active. 
  It is necessary to eliminate the existing bans in Article 51 
of the Constitution on the right to establish unions and in 
Article 52 on union activities. 
  Work on these issues will be completed as soon as possible. 
These amendments to the Constitution will assist Turkey in 
making great leaps forward toward democratization. When these 
amendments are made, 7 million young people will, for the first 
time, vote and thus play a role in determining the fate of our 
country. Out of 2.5 million citizens who live abroad, 1.4 
million will have the right to vote from their place of 
residence. In the 1991 elections, only 46,000 citizens could 
vote by personally arriving at the border gates. This 
modification will eliminate our citizens from feeling alien and 
will give them the right to have their say in governing their 
countries. 
  Unions, syndicates, and trade unions, as an organized power 
in our society, will be able to increase their participation and 
effectiveness in the political life of Turkey. 
  Lowering the eligible age to be elected deputy to 25 will 
increase the voice of the younger generation in our parliament 
and will encourage the youth to be more responsive to the 
country's problems. With this modification, in the 1996 
elections, approximately 6 million young people will have the 
right to be elected and enter the parliament. This kind of 
participation will give the Turkish parliament a new force and 
dynamism. 
  These amendments will also eliminate a great number of 
restrictions which do not meet the principles of 
democratization. For these reasons, we give great importance to 
these changes in the Constitution. We believe these changes are 
the stepping stones toward democratization and reconstruction. 
  In addition to these modifications, valuable experts from 
both parties have worked intensively on other articles in the 
Constitution. Assessing these works, we are going to propose 
other amendments to the Constitution. 
  Undoubtedly, there is a need for conciliation and 
cooperation 
with the political parties represented in the assembly in order 
to initiate the changes in the Constitution. Our government is 
ready to fulfill all the duties that fall on it to facilitate 
this cooperation and conciliation. 
  In addition to the changes in the Constitution, we foresee 
60 
new draft bills within the framework of the democratization and 
reconstruction program. We decided that 20 of the planned 60 
draft bills have high priority. After the 20 draft bills with 
high priority are passed we will submit the rest to the Assembly. 
  In the report that we have distributed to you, there is a 
list of all the proposed draft bills. 
  Dear friends, with your permission, I would like to explain 
the reconstruction process. We see the reconstruction process 
embodying all political, legal, economic, administrative, and 
social arrangements envisaged by the democratization process. 
  Reconstruction has both internal and external dimensions. 
Our government believes that Turkey should integrate with the 
civilized world. Turkey has made its choice to become a member 
of the European Union. We will also achieve a uniform customs 
arrangement. Communication and flow of information with the rest 
of the world is of utmost importance. For this reason, we are 
going to increase the channels of communication and information 
and if necessary we are going to institutionalize them. 
  The reconstruction process aims to use the seventh 
development plan as its main mean in attaining the hoped for 
ends. Turkey, up to now, has survived six different development 
plans. We are integrating with the world and we have to offer a 
new strategy in the seventh development plan. We will provide 
this strategy. This development plan is different than its 
predecessors; it will provide for Turkey's reconstruction and 
integration into the civilized world and include the necessary 
principles and measures toward that end. 
  There are differences in the development levels of various 
regions in our country at the socioeconomic level. The 
differences are especially obvious in the east, southeast, and 
Black Sea regions. All the former governments exerted great 
efforts to eradicate these differences. One of the most 
important examples of these efforts is the GAP [Southeast 
Anatolia Project]. Our government sees the eradication of the 
developmental differences between the regions as the most 
important and basic need of a social state. It is essential to 
provide minimum living conditions for everybody in the country, 
for all the citizens of our country. The state will continue to 
have a leading role in the regions which have priority regarding 
development plans. Industry will have priority until it reaches 
a certain level. New centers will be established in the pilot 
regions to make them more attractive. Regional development 
projects will be implemented. 
  The seventh five-year plan will make use of regional and 
physical techniques. GAP, which is the largest integrated 
regional development project, will be serve as an example for 
other regions. Regional development plans will also be 
implemented for the Black Sea town of Zonguldak. One of the 
main prerequisites for the development of our undeveloped 
regions is to provide security. For this reason, before 
everything else, we are determined to bring peace and 
tranquillity to these regions. 
  Valued members of the press, the Turkish Republic is a 
undivided state. As we have announced in our government 
program, we will not allow any behavior that will harm the 
structure of this undivided state. We are going to handle all 
social issues within this framework. As indicated in the 
government protocol; any physical or legal shortcomings, 
hindrances, or limitations in the protection, free expression, 
or development of our citizens' cultural, linguistic, or ethnic 
identities will be handled within a national unity framework and 
eradicated. The important point here is that all citizens, who 
are faithfully tied to the Turkish Republic by their 
citizenship, should continue to profit equally from their rights 
as citizens and individuals, without discrimination, and this 
guarantee should be strengthened. 
  Another aspect of the restructuring and democratization 
process is to provide Turkey with an up-to-date understanding of 
a centralized administrative structure. Our plan has the 
characteristics of reform. We had the following determination 
when we started our work, that today a centralized structure is 
not possible anymore and that today it is impossible to govern 
Turkey from Ankara. For this reason, we are determined to hand 
over to provincial administrations a great number of services 
which are conducted by the central government. Provincial 
administrations will be responsible for the development and 
progress of their own regions in cooperation with the 
municipalities. These provincial administrations will not only 
play a leading role in developing their regions but will also 
have full authority -- in cooperation with the municipalities -- 
over their area in the construction, maintenance, and management 
of villages; roads, drinking water installations, electricity, 
mosques and schools, social and administrative installations, 
small industry centers, organized industrial areas, cultural 
centers, sports installations, health centers, and hospitals. 
  The basis of this structure we developed for the provincial 
administrations and municipalities is that these establishments 
will have the authority to collect and impose taxes in their 
regions by councils appointed through elections. 
  Valuable press members, in conclusion I would like to point 
out the following: Obviously, democratization and restructuring 
is a process. We cannot belittle the great steps taken toward 
this end since the establishment of our republic. 
  Today when we are on the threshold of the 21st century, our 
government is determined to overcome all obstacles in the way of 
democratization and contemporary values. Our government sees as 
its historical duty the opening of the horizons of our people by 
establishing a pluralistic and participatory democratic system 
based on tolerance and conciliation. Turkey, which is part of 
the changing world, will enter the new century as an exemplary 
and leading country on the one hand -- without losing its 
identity and national values -- and on the other, as a country 
which embraces universal values. 
  Our government, with the belief that the state exists to 
serve its people, has announced this democratization and 
restructuring implementation plan fully aware of its 
responsibilities. We call on all our political parties, 
democratic organizations, and each and every one of our people 
to cooperate in the application of this package.

<F P=106> [Article signed GGD/MAR: "`No Specific Partnership for </F>
Russia,' NATO Attests"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 19 May (BELGA) -- NATO is refusing Russia 
the right to have a special status within the context of the 
Partnership for Peace (PFP), the initiative launched by the 
Atlantic Alliance to increase its cooperation with the European 
countries that are not members, it was pointed out Thursday [19 
May] at the organization's Brussels headquarters. 
  "There will not be any `specific PFP' for Moscow," affirmed 
two senior NATO officials, who requested anonymity. 
  According to the same sources, the alliance nevertheless 
wishes, albeit in an informal manner, to establish relations 
involving close contacts on the subjects of Bosnia, peacekeeping 
operations, and nuclear weapons, due to the "important 
geopolitical role" played by Moscow in the area of European 
security. However, the details of this specific relationship 
still have to be worked out. 
  Meanwhile, the Kremlin wants a special treaty to obtain 
specific rights within the PFP before signing the framework 
accession document. Russia also wants to place NATO under the 
supervision of the CSCE, which comprises 52 countries in Europe 
and Central Asia. 
  The question of the relations to be established between NATO 
and Moscow was raised Wednesday by the ambassadors of the 16 
member countries, who had gathered for their weekly meeting, but 
our sources added that no decision had yet been made. 
  "There is room for dialogue and cooperation which would 
reflect the role of Russia in Europe," the two senior NATO 
officials went on, emphasizing that it was in the interests of 
both parties for Moscow to join the PFP. 
  These statements come just a few days before the arrival in 
Brussels of General Pavel Grachev, the Russian defense minister, 
who will be coming to present the Russian military doctrine to 
his NATO counterparts (minus France) on Tuesday evening. The 
next day, he will participate in a meeting of defense ministers 
from NATO countries and the countries of Central and East Europe. 
  General Grachev recently stated that he would benefit from 
the occasion to present NATO Russia's "own concept" of a PFP. 
  The Russian minister is then scheduled to proceed with a 
two-day visit to Belgium, at the invitation of his Belgian 
counterpart, Mr. Leo Delcroix.

Presidency on Behalf of the European Union on The Signing of the 
Latvian-Russian Agreements on The Withdrawal of Russian Troops 
From Latvia"] 
  [Text] The European Union welcomes the signing of the 
Latvian-Russian agreements which guarantee the complete 
withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia no later than 31 August 
1994 and which stipulate that the Skrunda radar is not a 
military base but an installation under civilian authority. 
  The Union wishes to emphasise that these agreements do not 
limit Latvia's sovereignty and will not delay the development of 
closer ties between Latvia and the European institutions, for 
which the Union has often demonstrated its support. 
  The signing of these agreements represents an important 
event 
in the history of independent Latvia and removes a major 
obstacle in the development of bilateral relations with Russia, 
based on good neighbourly relations and mutual respect. 
Followed by early ratification on both sides, the signature 
will form a tangible contribution to overall stability in the 
Baltic region and thus form part of the perspective created by 
the European Union initiative on a stability pact in Europe.

<F P=106> [EC press release No. IP/94/404: "Formal Opening of </F>
Negotiations for the Mid-Term Review of the Fourth Lome 
Convention"] 
  [Text] On 20 May 1994, at the annual meeting of the ACP/EU 
[African Caribbean and Pacific/European Union] Council of 
Ministers in Mbabane (Swaziland), negotiations for the mid-term 
review of the Fourth ACP/EU Convention will be formally opened. 
  On 8 September 1993, the European Commission approved a 
proposal requesting authorization from the Council and the 
Member States to negotiate the review of certain provisions of 
the Lome IV Convention signed on 15 december 1989 by the 
European Union and the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) 
states. 
  The proposal, together with draft negotiating directives, 
was 
presented by Mr Manuel Marin, Commission vice-president for 
development cooperation and humanitarian aid. 
  On 7 February 1994, the European Union Council of Ministers 
approved, by unanimity, the negotiating directives for the 
partial revision of the convention. 
  The Lome IV signatories provided for the possibility of a 
review midway through the convention's ten-year term, to 
coincide with the renewal of the financial protocol, which must 
in any event take place after five years. 
  The Commission believes that there is an urgent need to 
adapt 
the convention to present-day development cooperation 
requirements. Thus, the Commission proposed that the European 
Union confirm to the ACP states its commitment to the system of 
cooperation introduced by the first Lome Convention, underlining 
the special nature of a relationship based on the equality of 
the partners and on mutual interest. 
  In the light of recent developments on the international 
political stage and of the lessons learned in implementing the 
present convention up to now, the European Union proposals, 
adopted at the initiative of the European Commission, are 
primarily designed to make European Union support for ACP 
development more effective. Accordingly, the main objectives 
are: 

  -  To ensure that the convention asserts the principles 
of democracy, the rule of law and good governance, alongside 
existing references in the convention (Art.5) to respect for and 
enjoyment of human rights; 
  -  To adapt the instruments of dialogue 
between the ACP and the European Union to take better account of 
the basic principles and priorities of the European Union 
cooperation policy and implement them more effectively; 
  -  To 
achieve more coherent and effective use of ACP-EU cooperation 
instruments and procedures. 

  Furthermore, the Commission proposed that, as in the case 
with other European Union partners, the scope of the ACP-EU 
Council of Ministers be extended in order to create, preferably 
on a regional basis, a political dialogue. 
  A memorandum based on these proposals and on the subsequent 
discussions in the Council was sent to the ACP states in 
accordance with the procedure and timetable laid down in Article 
366 of the Fourth Lome Convention. 
  Negotiations will be formally opened at the ACP/EU Council 
of 
Ministers, on 20 May 1994 in Mbabane (Swaziland). 
<H5>  Background: the Lome Convention </H5>
  The European Union and its member states together constitute 
the principal source of official development assistance (ODA) 
for the benefit of all developing countries. Today they account 
for almost half of all aid received by developing countries. 
The ECU2.5 billion made available every year to the countries 
of the southern hemisphere thus gives the European Union, 
considerable weight in its development action. 
  European Union financial aid managed by the European 
Commission represents around 5 percent of the total world oda 
and 15 percent of that of the twelve member states. 
<H5>  From Lome I to Lome IV </H5>
  The Lome Convention is the best known and most complete 
example of the European Union's development cooperation policy. 
It expresses at European Union level the interdependence woven 
by history, trade, economics and culture between Europe and the 
south. 
  In 1975 Lome I took over from the two Yaounde conventions, 
marking the beginning of what was soon to be known as Lome 
policy. A second convention, signed in 1980, assured continuity. 
Lome III, concluded in 1985, enshrined new ambitions centred on 
the objectives of rural development and food security. 
<H5>  Lome Policy Rests on Four Pillars: </H5>

  -  Cooperation between 
two regional groups, based on respect for the political and 
economic choices of each partner; 
  -  Stable, sustainable and 
predictable cooperation based on legally binding arrangements 
set out in a freely negotiated contract; 
  -  Comprehensive 
cooperation combining a whole range of aid and trade development 
instruments; 
  -  On-going dialogue in the framework of three joint 
institutions: the ACP-EEC Council of Ministers, the ACP-EEC 
Committee of Ambassadors and the ACP-EEC Joint Assembly. 

<H5>  Lome IV -- a Ten-Year Convention for 70 ACP Countries </H5>
  The European Union and 66 ACP states signed on 15 December 
1989 the Fourth Lome Convention. Two new Caribbean states, 
Haiti and the Dominican Republic, joined the convention. 
Namibia and Eritrea also became members immediately after their 
independence; the Lome Convention thus comprises all the 
countries of Sub-Saharan Africa except South Africa. 
  For the first time, after a series of five-year conventions, 
the Fourth Convention will last for ten years (with a renewable 
five-year financial protocol expiring on 28 February 1995). It 
will be in force from 1 March 1990 until the end of February of 
the year 2000. 
  The financial resources made available for ACP/EU 
cooperation 
went from ECU8.5 billion under Lome III to ECU12 billion 
(approx. $15 billion) for the first five years of Lome IV (up to 
the end of february 1995). These resources are as 
follows: 

  -  ECU10.8 billion to the European Development Fund, 
i.e. an increase of 45 percent in nominal terms and of 25 
percent in real terms with respect to Lome III. This amount 
includes individual allocations for the 70 ACP states (the 
"indicative programmes": ECU6.215 billion) as well as other 
sectoral areas: structural adjustment (ECU1.15 billion), 
stabilisation of agricultural revenues (the "stabex" system: 
ECU1.5 billion) and of mining resources ("sysmin": ECU480 
million), emergency aid (ECU250 million), aid to refugees 
(ECU100 million), interest rate subsidies (ECU280 million) and 
risk capital (ECU825 million). 
  -  ECU1.2 billion on own resources 
from the European Investment Bank (EIB). Together with this 
increase in aid, an important effort has been made in order to 
improve the quality of European Union aid: with the exception of 
risk capital managed by the EIB, all of the European Development 
Fund is now made of grants.

<F P=106> [EC Document No. DOC/IP/94/400: "Chairman 'Arafat and Vice </F>
President Marin Sign Documents on EU Aid to Occupied 
Territories"] 
  [Text] PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat and European Commission 
Vice President Manuel Marin signed two documents in Tunis on 13 
May on EU aid to the Occupied Territories. They provide for the 
European Community to make available 10 MECU [million ECU's] for 
the establishment of the Palestinian police force and 1.8 MECU 
for the election process. 
  Chairman 'Arafat and Vice President Marin signed a document 
providing 10 MECU on aid to the police force. The grant will be 
split equally into finance for recurrent expenditure on the 
force (operational expenses, fuel and maintenance, salaries 
etc.) and the provision of equipment for the force, mostly 
vehicles. It will not be used for the provision of lethal 
equipment. 
  The 10 MECU will contribute towards expenditure for the 
priority period covering the first 5 1/2 months of the 
deployment of the force. In view of the urgency of the rapid 
and effective establishment of the force, the Community is using 
accelerated procedures to ensure rapid availability of the 
finance. 
  Chairman 'Arafat and Vice President Marin signed a second 
document providing 1.8 MECU aid for the electoral process in the 
Occupied Territories. Under this document the European 
Community will assist the Palestine Commission for Local 
Government and Elections (PCLGE) to enable the preparation and 
execution of democratic Palestinian elections and the building 
of new local government institutions. This will cover such 
activities as the preparation of the electoral law, training of 
officials, preparation of manuals, definition of boundaries, as 
well as the registration of voters and the physical arrangements 
for the elections themselves. 
  The EC contribution will cover the major part of the costs 
involved in the electoral process. The EC has also agreed to 
assist the Palestinians in the organisation of a donors' 
conference to ensure the funding of the final elements of the 
election preparations.

Ecofin Council Session"] 
  [Text] Meeting on Monday [16 May] at a session chaired by 
Giorgos Romeos, Greek Deputy Minister for the National Economy, 
the Ecofin [economic and financial issues] Council concluded its 
work shortly after 1800. Its results were summarized as 
follows: 

  -  Economic situation. The Council took note of the 
Commission's new projections, which were nevertheless sharply 
criticized by Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke as 
regards the United Kingdom. Belgian Minister Philippe Maystadt 
said the Commission had made low-range projections for certain 
Member States. 
  -  Progress of work on the white paper. Based on a 
Commission note, the Twelve continued preparation of the Corfu 
Summit, examining in particular a German memorandum which was 
warmly endorsed by the British delegation. 
  -  Financial assistance 
to Central and East European countries. The expected decisions 
were taken in part. 
  -  Combatting fraud. The ministers held the 
expected exchange of views. 
  -  Banks. The Council adopted the 
directive on the guarantee system. 
  -  Securities exchanges. The 
Council completed and simplified the directive on prospectuses 
for admission of shares to the exchange.

<F P=106> [EC Document No. DOC/IP/94/408: "Results of Monthly Surveys </F>
of European Opinion (January-April 1994)"] 
  [Text] Since January 1994, the Commission is doing pilot 
monthly surveys (five questions). The definitive formula with a 
solid sample and methodology will come into force at the end of 
the year. Here are the results of the four first months 
test-exercises: 
<H5>  White Paper </H5>
  Between the 3rd and 13th January 1994 -- monthly monitor 1 
-- 
18 percent of Europeans say they have heard or read something on 
the white paper. In April -- monthly monitor 4 -- 25 percent 
had become aware of something on the subject. 
  On EC average, the level of expected positive effects of the 
white paper fell a little between January (47 percent) and April 
(42 percent). 
<H5>  Enlargement </H5>
  In March 1994, the vast majority support membership of 
Sweden 
(83 percent), Austria, and Norway (82 percent), Switzerland (81 
percent) and Finland (80 percent). 
  In April 1994 -- monthly monitor 4 -- "after the next 
accession to the European Commission (European Union) of 
countries such as Austria, Finland, Norway or Sweden," 64 
percent of Europeans favour membership of Hungary, 61 percent 
membership of Poland, 59 percent membership of the Czech 
Republic and 57 percent membership of Slovakia. 
<H5>  The Conflict in Ex-Yugoslavia </H5>
  Between the 1st and the 8th of February 1994 -- monthly 
monitor 2 -- four out of five European citizens (82 percent) 
opposed "letting things as they go now" in the conflict between 
the Serbs, Croats, and Muslims in Bosnia. 
  Of the possible measures proposed to the respondents, that 
of 
using "fight when necessary to get humanitarian convoys through" 
received the highest support: 75 percent (90 percent in 
France). Followed by, though not closely: 

  -  Launch air 
strikes: 37 percent for; 55 percent against (53 percent of 
French favour this but only 9 percent of Greeks and 6 percent of 
Portuguese). 
  -  Lift the arms embargo against Bosnia: 33 percent 
for; 54 percent against. 
  -  Withdraw all troops: 31 percent for; 
62 percent against (71 percent of Greeks are in favour). 
  -  Lift 
the embargo against Serbia: 28 percent for; 58 percent against 
(67 percent of Greeks are in favour). 
  -  Break off negotiations 
with all sides: 23 percent for; 69 percent against. 

<H5>  European Elections </H5>
  In April 1994 -- monthly monitor 4 -- one in two (50 
percent) 
European citizens confessed that in casting their vote to elect 
members of the European Parliament, their opinion about national 
issues will be more important. Forty-two percent said that 
European problems will be more important for them at the time of 
their vote. 
<H5>  Satisfaction With Democracy and Support for the European </H5>
Union 
  In April 1994, 48 percent of Europeans said they were "very 
satisfied" or "somewhat satisfied" with the way democracy works 
in their country. 
  Support for the European Union among those who think 
membership is a good thing has not really changed between 
January (56 percent) and April (58 percent) 1994. The situation 
among those who think membership is a bad thing is almost 
identical: 14 percent in january, 13 percent in April. 
  Following a slight decrease from February to March in those 
who think that "all things considered, their country has 
benefitted from membership of the EU" (- 3), the level remained 
stable between March and April (49 percent).

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "France/Spain/Italy: Police </F>
Cooperation Protocol Signed"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 13 -- The commander general of 
Italy's Carabinieri force, General Luigi Federici, with a 
mandate from the ministry of the interior, Thursday [12 May] 
signed a protocol agreement with his counterparts from France 
and Spain so that the police departments from the three 
countries can work more closely together, an official communique 
from the Carabinieri's general command reported here this 
evening. 
  Patrice Maynial signed for the French national gendarmerie, 
while Ferran Cardenal De Alemany signed for the Spanish Civil 
Guard. 
  The three police forces agreed to step up their ties within 
the framework of international accords and national norms, with 
regard to training, recruitment, the organization of services, 
the exchange of information and experience, scientific data and 
techniques, and the acquisition of new technologies. 
  The battle against drugs will figure highly in their 
cooperative efforts, plus, in addition to their crime-fighting 
activities, the three institutions also will promote protection 
of the environment and of the artistic heritage of their 
countries.

<F P=106> [Article signed GGD/JWI: "Relief Begins for Belgian </F>
Engineer Company in Bosnia"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 16 May (BELGA) -- The Belgian Army began 
taking over on Monday [16 May] from some 170 Belgian blue 
helmets in the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] working on the 
"Bosnia Road" operation (the repair of the road system in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina), it has been learned from a military source 
in Brussels. 
  A vanguard of 33 soldiers took off on Monday morning for 
Zagreb (Croatia), from where they will travel to the Bosnian 
capital of Sarajevo, a military spokesman informed the BELGA 
agency. 
  On the return journey, the aircraft will be bringing back 
some 50 blue helmets who have completed a four months tour of 
duty in this former Yugoslav Republic. 
  Three other flights are planned to relieve the other members 
of this engineering company, most of whom were drawn from the 
11th Battalion from Burcht, near Antwerp. These will take place 
on 20, 24, and 27 May, the spokesman added, stating that on each 
occasion the relieved soldiers will be returning to Belgium on 
the same flights. 
  The third "Bosnia Road" contingent since the start of the 
operation last September consists principally of soldiers from 
the third Engineering Battalion from Westhoven, near Cologne 
(Germany), and from the 15th Engineering Battalion. The "Bosnia 
Road" members are stationed in Kakanj, north of Sarajevo. 
  In addition to these 170 engineers, two other Belgian units 
are also in Bosnia. A transport company (consisting of around 
100 men and code-named "Moving Star") which is delivering 
humanitarian aid and an infantry company (also of around 100 men 
and known as "Belbos" by the Army) which is responsible for 
ensuring respect for the cease-fire concluded at the end of 
February between Croats and Muslims. They are both stationed in 
Vitez (in central Bosnia, 45 km northwest of Sarajevo).

<F P=106> [Article signed GGD: "Air Force Prepared To Engage F-16's </F>
in Operations Abroad"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 17 May (BELGA) -- The Air Force is 
prepared to play a larger part, primarily by deploying its F-16 
fighter planes, in Belgian Army missions in Africa or in Bosnia, 
said Lieutenant General Guido Vanhecke, Air Force chief of staff. 
  "For a long time we have been emphasizing combined 
operations. Or, more advanced cooperation between the various 
services could be envisaged," the general said during a meeting 
with journalists from the Aviation Press Club in Brussels. 
  The Air Force "boss" cited the example of operation "Silver 
Back" organized in Rwanda to evacuate foreign nationals after 
the resumption of the civil war there. During such 
interventions, fighter planes could, according to him, "play an 
effective role in deterrence, support, fire support, or the 
protection of ground units." 
  Reiterating that French Jaguar fighter-bombers based in 
Bangui (central Africa) carried out flights of "intimidation" 
over Rwanda during the evacuation of foreigners, General 
Vanhecke wondered about the possibility of deploying units of 
Belgian F-16's in such cases. The F-16 has a range of up to 
3,500 km, even without in-flight refueling, a technique for 
which all pilots are qualified. 
  The general emphasized that the Air Force has always been in 
a position to deploy a complete squadron at a maximum notice of 
72 hours within the context of the Allied Mobile Force, as was 
the case when 18 Mirage's were rushed to southeastern Turkey, in 
early 1991, just before the outbreak of the Gulf War. 
  "This time period could be reduced for a group of six 
airplanes," he added, noting that the decision to engage combat 
aircraft had to be made at the "political level," primarily 
because of the need to negotiate fly-over rights or parking 
rights in the case of armed humanitarian operations. 
  The defense minister is convinced that these should be joint 
operations, the chief of staff added, referring to a recent 
meeting with Mr. Leo Delcroix. 
  Mentioning the possible participation of the Air Force in 
NATO's "Deny Flight" operation, which enforces the ban on flight 
through Bosnian airspace and provides air support to the 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] Blue Helmets, the chief of staff 
said "certain allied countries would probably be pleased to be 
able to share the burden of this mission with others." 
  He also acknowledged that the Belgian F-16's were currently 
"handicapped" by the lack of certain equipment, such as 
electronic countermeasures. However, the French system 
"Carapace", which is passive in so far as it only detects the 
radar used in antiaircraft defense systems, is scheduled to 
arrive in the Belgian Air Force squadrons in early 1995. 
  "If Belgium were called on to participate in operation `Deny 
Flight,' the Air Force would have to decide whether an active 
system was essential," the general continued, saying that these 
pod-mounted systems could be obtained on loan from allies which 
have them, as could certain precision, laser-guided munitions. 
  According to the chief of staff, the F-16's are "excellent 
aircraft," flown by pilots who have an "operational level 
comparable" to that of the allied air forces present in the 
skies over Bosnia. 
  "Our F-16's can be deployed for all NATO or UN missions for 
which they are 
or could be used," he concluded.

<F P=106> [Colin Brown and David McKittrick Report: "Cabinet Plans </F>
Response to Sinn Fein"] 
  [Text] The Prime Minister and senior Cabinet ministers last 
night decided to reply tomorrow to the IRA demands for 
clarification of the Downing Street declaration, as the killing 
in Ulster continued yesterday with two Catholic workmen shot 
dead. 
  Ministers said the Government would publish a "commentary" 
on 
the declaration. They insisted that it would not amount to a 
clarification, but it would put pressure on the IRA to enter the 
peace process. A statement is expected in the Commons by Sir 
Patrick Mayhew, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. 
  Meanwhile, two Catholic building workers were gunned down as 
they sat having their lunch on a building site in the Protestant 
North Queen Street area of Belfast. In the attack, claimed by 
the Ulster Volunteer Force [UVF], the gunmen opened fire with an 
automatic weapon, killing the two men almost instantly. A third 
man escaped with cuts. 
  The RUC [Royal Ulster Constabulary] later made arrests and 
recovered firearms. A police officer condemned the killings as 
blatantly sectarian. The two men, both commuters from rural 
areas, were easy targets working in a strongly loyalist area. 
One was a 44-year-old father of five, the other was 24 with one 
child. Friends denied UVF claims that they were active 
republicans. SDLP [Social Democratic Labour Party] councillor 
Ignatius Fox said: "Neither of the two was involved in anything. 
They were trying to rear their families and do a day's work." 
The Cabinet committee on Northern Ireland is due to continue 
the work today on the response to a series of questions 
submitted by Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein. The aim 
is to answer the questions in a "dead-pan" manner, without 
shifting the joint position that Sinn Fein can only enter the 
talks process after renouncing violence. 
  "An end to violence is the bottom line. We are not getting 
involved in negotiations," one ministerial source said. Ulster 
Unionists have been assured that it will be a "one-off" exercise. 
  Mr Adams said yesterday he was disturbed and concerned at 
reports that the Government's answers to Sinn Fein's questions 
would not amount to clarification of the Downing Street 
declaration. 
  Mr Adams claimed there was growing concern among 
nationalists 
that the Government "may squander yet another opportunity to 
advance the peace process." He called for "comprehensive, 
unambiguous and honest" responses. 
  Neither London nor Dublin believes that the Government's 
responses stand any change of bringing about a cessation of IRA 
violence. The prevailing Northern Ireland Office view is that 
Mr Adams has painted himself into a corner and cannot deliver 
the republican movement.

<F P=106> [Report by Foreign Ministry spokesman Radko Vlaykov] </F>
  [Text] London, May 19 -- Bulgarian Foreign Minister 
Stanislav Daskalov started his working visit to Britain today. 
  Foreign Minister Daskalov's visit is a continuation of 
Bulgaria's efforts to maintain regular dialogue with the EU 
[European Union] member states. 
  The most important of Mr. Daskalov's meetings here was his 
working lunch and meeting with British Foreign Secretary Douglas 
Hurd and with other senior Foreign Office representatives. The 
two sides discussed a wide range of issues of mutual interest 
and Balkan security issues. They exchanged opinions on the 
situation in the former Yugoslavia and in Bosnia-Herzegovina in 
particular. The Bulgarian foreign minister recalled Bulgaria's 
stand against Balkan countries' participation in the UNPROFOR 
[UN Protection Forces] in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The two sides 
also discussed issues of bilateral relations. 
  Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov also visited the British 
Parliament where he met Michael Marshall, chairman of the 
Interparliamentary Group and chairman of the Group for 
British-Bulgarian Parliamentary Cooperation.

<F P=106> [John Gittings article: "BBC Prison Film Angers China"] </F>
  [Text] China has denounced BBC Television for 
"fabricating" a report about Chinese prison labour, only six 
months after another BBC programme led to fierce diplomatic 
protests from Beijing. 
  The row coincides with separate information suggesting that 
hundreds of previously unknown prisoners were arrested after the 
1989 Tiananmen Square massacre and remain in jail. 
  The Foreign Ministry in Beijing said yesterday that reports 
on labour camps, broadcast on BBC Breakfast News this week, were 
"sheer fabrication." 
  "A handful of hostile people in the world have gone out of 
their way to smear China with fabricated stories," it said. 
"Their motive is very sinister." 
  The films were made secretly by the journalist Sue 
Lloyd-Roberts, helped by Henry Wu, a former prison camp inmate 
who has returned several times to China to expose the system. 
  Using a secret camera, Ms Lloyd-Roberts filmed prisoners at 
work under police guard in three provinces. Prisoners and local 
residents confirmed the existence of the camps in interviews. 
  The scenes included an asbestos mine where alleged prisoners 
were shifting the mineral without protective clothing, and a 
shop selling clothes made by prison labour. 
  Farmers in the north-west region of Xinjiang were filmed 
complaining that the prison camps' output undercut their own 
produce. 
  Many inmates are young people sentenced for petty crime in 
the cities. The programme alleges that prisoners are often not 
allowed to leave after completion of their sentence. 
  The claims come at an awkward time for China as President 
Clinton considers whether to renew the country's Most Favoured 
Nation status. Negative news about Chinese human rights 
increases the pressure to withhold it. 
  China has previously denied that goods made in prison are 
sold abroad. The Justice Ministry said yesterday that the shops 
shown in the film had nothing to do with prisons. 
  The row may also create further problems for BBC and other 
British journalists seeking to cover China. 
  After a BBC Timewatch film in December made lurid 
allegations 
about Mao Zedong's sex life, journalists were refused visas and 
Beijing staff have had dificulties in working normally. 
  The BBC's reporters in Beijing and Hong Kong were not 
involved in making either programme. But China claims to see a 
British plot behind the negative publicity. 
  Meanwhile new evidence on almost 500 previously unknown 
prisoners arrested after the Beijing massacre in June 1989 has 
been released by the Human Rights in China and Asia Watch 
organisations based in the United States. 
  The list was compiled by local Chinese human rights 
activists 
who gathered information from the families of the alleged 
prisoners. Most had been charged with criminal offences after 
attempting -- sometimes violently -- to prevent the entry of 
Chinese troops and tanks into Tiananmen Square. But the list 
also includes several prisoners convicted of "counterrevolution" 
for crimes such as publishing an unofficial magazine. 
  Some prisoners in Beijing No. 2 prison, the report says, are 
forced to work ten- to 16-hour days. The work includes checking 
latex gloves which, it is claimed, are being shipped to the 
United States. 
  The Chinese Foreign Ministry has also denied reports that 
Beijing is preparing to prosecute its most famous dissident Wei 
Jingsheng. Wei was near the end of a 15-year sentence after 
criticising Deng Xiaoping in the 1979 Democracy Wall movement. 
He was detained again last month.

<F P=106> [Ruth Kelly and Larry Elliott report: "Clarke Denies Rift </F>
Over Loan Rate"] 
  [Text] The Chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, last night said he 
was four-square behind the Bank of England Governor and refused 
to jeopardise the Government's anti-inflationary credibility in 
a short-term dash for growth to boost Conservative popularity. 
  His comments follow strong hints last week from the 
Governor, 
Eddie George, that the last cut in the base rate to 5.25 per 
cent had been mistaken if inflation was to continue falling. 
  In the United States yesterday the Federal Reserve moved to 
rein in inflation by raising both its interest rates by a full 
half-point, more than the markets were expecting. 
  In an attempt to calm jittery global financial markets, it 
hinted that the increases would be the last for the time being, 
but the rise almost certainly ends any lingering hopes that 
Britain's base rate could come down further, lowering the costs 
of borrowing to industry and reducing mortgages for home-owners. 
  The Fed's move underpinned the Chancellor's point that 
economic growth must not be allowed to get out of hand as it did 
in the late l980's. 
  Speaking to industrialists at the Confederation of British 
Industry's annual dinner, Mr Clarke admitted that the 
Government's popularity was suffering because the economic 
recovery was less than spectacular and said most people still 
believed Britain was stuck in recession. 
  But he ruled out any suggestion that he was at odds with the 
more cautious Mr George over the level of interest rates, and 
was at pains to emphasise his determination to keep inflation 
down even if that ran counter to "short-term political or 
populist" objectives. 
  "Too many people still hanker after the go-for-growth in 
living standards they enjoyed in the years of boom. Well this 
Chancellor does not want a boom because boom gets followed by 
bust," he said. Sustainable economic growth meant keeping 
interest rates high enough to ensure inflation remained firmly 
within his 1-4 per cent target band and would fall to the lower 
half of that range by the end of the present Parliament -- 
probably in l966 or early l997. 
  But in the Bank of England's latest Inflation Report 
released 
last week, the Governor argued that at current interest rates 
the "core" rate of inflation would remain stuck at 3-3.5 per 
cent over the next two years. 
  The Chancellor, however said he had "let the Bank loose to 
write its own inflation report" in order to improve the 
credibility of policy, and there was no "clash of cultures or 
objectives" between the Treasury and Threadneedle Street. 
  "Eddie George and I share the same aim of low inflation and 
sound money. I decide, but we discuss and seek to agree," he 
said. 
  Striking out at the right wing of the Tory party, who insist 
Britain's place lies outside the European Union [EU], Mr Clarke 
argued that the EU was "good for British industry and British 
entrepreneurship" and if that meant taking on "those who cling 
to a more dirigiste vision of Europe, then so be it." 
  He insisted that the argument was moving in Britain's 
direction. "To be pro-European does not mean that we should 
accept the soggy social democrat consensus of the European Union 
in recent years." 
  Meanwhile, City analysts will be watching data released 
today 
on unemployment, average earnings, public borrowing and 
inflation for any signs in a slowdown in activity after April's 
wave of tax increases or, conversely, a hint of a pick-up in 
inflationary pressures if growth is too robust. 
  The Prime Minister yesterday appeared to be softening up 
MP's 
at Question Time in the Commons for some bad economic news. He 
said prospects were extremely good, but "every single indicator 
in the months ahead may not be as good as we would wish." 
  In the United States, bond and share prices rose strongly 
after the news of the increase in interest rates. However some 
members of Congress fear the Fed has indulged in overkill and 
may push the economy back towards recession in an election year. 
  The increase in the Fed funds rate -- the rate at which 
banks 
lend to each other -- to 4.25 per cent was the fourth in as many 
months, though the three previous rises were each of a quarter 
point. The half-point rise in the discount rate -- the rate at 
which banks borrow money from the Fed -- to 3.5 per cent was the 
first in five years.

<F P=106> [Gillian Tett article: "CBI President Pours Scorn on </F>
Brussels"] 
  [Text] The out-going president of the Confederation of the 
British Industry [CBI] yesterday delivered a blistering attack 
on the European Commission, claiming that Brussels was hampering 
UK business interests by excessive regulation and out-dated 
"50's-style" policies. 
  In a clarion call to the UK Eurosceptics, Sir Michael Angus, 
who is chairman of Whitbread, accused the Commission of ignoring 
the views of European businessmen, and called on the UK 
government to "take up the cudgels" of industry. 
  "Doubts have once again begun to set in as to whether the 
Community is capable of adopting an agenda that makes a positive 
contribution to the ability of businesses to face intense global 
pressures," he said. 
  If European legislators introduced any more anticompetitive 
initiatives they should simply "go into a dark room, lie down, 
and keep taking the tablets," he said at the CBI's annual dinner. 
  The unusually provocative speech, which marks the swan-song 
of Sir Michael's two-year term as CBI president, cited five main 
areas where the Commission had apparently failed to listen to 
business views. 
  The first was the white paper on competitiveness and growth, 
drawn up by Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president. This had 
been given a "disappointingly thin" follow-up. But when he had 
raised these criticisms with Mr Padraig Flynn, social affairs 
commissioner, he had been shocked by Mr Flynn's "outdated" focus 
on industrial relations. 
  The second target was the green paper on social policy, 
which 
was accused of paying too little attention on the need to get 
Europe's 20 million unemployed back to work. 
  The Commission's attempts to introduce the directive on 
employee information and consultation provided another bone of 
contention. The directive would erode the competitiveness of 
European companies and leave U.S. businessmen "chortling." 
  Fourth, the proliferation of anticompetitive state aids was 
undermining the European industry, Sir Michael said. He accused 
the Commission of undermining competitive policy in areas where 
the UK was strongest -- civil aviation, steel, 
telecommunications and energy. 
  Finally, Sir Michael concluded, the Commission was failing 
to 
get to grips with its own spending policy, producing a "dismal 
catalogue of fraud and waste."

<F P=106> [Anthony Bevins report on the results of a Telephone poll </F>
conducted for THE OBSERVER by ICM in Britain: "Eighty Per Cent 
Reject Referendum on Single Currency"] 
  [Text] A Referendum on a single European currency, the 
issue that divided the Tory leadership last week, is supported 
by only a fifth of the electorate, an OBSERVER/ICM 
[International Communications and Marketing Research] poll 
suggests today. 
  Three times as many people wanted a referendum on further 
constitutional change in the European Union [EU] -- the subject 
for discussion at the next intergovernmental European conference 
in 1996. 
  That left 60 per cent in favour of a constitutional 
referendum, compared with 21 per cent favouring a referendum on 
a single currency, due to be introduced by other EU states from 
1999. 
  When ICM asked people whether they would be more or less 
likely to vote Labour if it made a firm commitment to a single 
currency, nearly half said they would be less likely to do so, 
while 18 per cent would be more likely. A quarter said it would 
make no difference. 
  The most marked antipathy towards a single currency, on the 
basis of that question, was shown by Conservative supporters, 
but even 58 per cent of Liberal Democrats said it would make 
them less likely to vote Labour. compared with only 38 per cent 
of existing Labour supporters. 
  The stronger support of Labour voters for Europe was also 
shown when those interviewed were asked whether they would be 
more or less likely to vote Labour if the party made a firm 
commitment to closer political integration. Among Labour 
voters, that question scored a positive rating of eight points 
(34 per cent more likely to vote Labour; 26 per cent less 
likely). 
  While the overall negative rating was 31 points on the 
single 
currency question, that fell to a negative rating of only nine 
points on closer political integration, with 29 per cent more 
likely to vote Labour; 38 per cent less likely. 
  That ambivalence became more pronounced when ICM asked 
whether people would be more or less likely to vote Labour if it 
made a firm commitment to halt any further shift of sovereignty 
from Westminster to Brussels: 35 per cent said more likely, 35 
per cent less likely, and 23 per cent that it would make no 
difference. 
  With the European parliamentary elections taking place on 9 
June, the debate between the Government and the Opposition 
parties revolves around two questions -- the public hostility 
towards Brussels centralisation, and the fear of being left 
behind in the second division of a two tier European Union. 
  The Conservative campaign centres on the charge that Labour 
favours socialist centralisation, while Labour argues that the 
Tories will opt into the second division. 
  ICM asked: "If all members of the European Union cannot 
agree to a timetable for economic and political integration, do 
you think those willing to proceed should go ahead anyway, or 
should all countries proceed together even if it means slowing 
down the process?" 
  While a fifth (21 per cent) said those willing to go ahead 
should do so, almost three-quarters (73 per cent) preferred a 
united, slower pace -- compared with just over a half (56 per 
cent) when the same question was put in October 1992. That 
increase in the fear of isolation could help Labour when the 
Conservatives are playing up John Major's Maastricht opt-outs, 
and senior Tories are mooting withdrawal or use of the veto to 
block further integration -- a move that could lead to a 
two-tier development. 
  But when people were asked whether further economic and 
political integration should be accelerated or slowed down, 63 
per cent wanted it slowed down, while 23 per cent wanted it 
accelerated -- an eight point increase on the 15 per cent 
wanting acceleration in October 1992.

<F P=106> [Conor Cruise O'Brien article: "Puncturing the PLO </F>
Illusion"] 
  [Text] Gaza and Jericho are in the process of being handed 
over to a non-existent organisation known to the media as "the 
PLO." The Palestine Liberation Organisation was set up in 1964. 
It was then a cover for Syrian intelligence, which gave it 
credit for Syria's own covert fedayeen attacks on Israel. The 
object of the exercise, accompanied by a lavish propaganda war, 
was to shame Nasir's Egypt into conflict with Israel. The 
outcome was the Six Day War, in 1967. 
  In the aftermath of that war, the PLO was reformed on a 
broader basis, and to meet a shared need of the defeated Arab 
states. It became a loose association of the Palestinian 
clients of the different Arab states. The need it met was an 
urgent one: to provide an answer to the awkward question, put 
by ordinary Arabs: "What are you going to do about Israel, now?" 
  The answer was: "We are giving unflinching support to the 
PLO, in its continuing struggle." 
  As the Arab states continued to have to rely on that answer, 
over the decades, the PLO became exalted to great heights, in 
terms of propaganda, and richly subsidised. Every Arab summit 
re-dedicated itself to the support of "the PLO, sole legitimate 
representative of the Palestinian people." The PLO remained 
what it had been since 1974, a loose association of factions 
competing with one another in sporadic acts of terrorism against 
Israel. The most important faction is -- or rather has been -- 
Yasir 'Arafat's Fatah, and media references to "the PLO" have 
almost always meant Fatah. 
  The main trouble with the present fumblings over Gaza and 
Jericho is that Fatah itself has now been reduced to the same 
nebulous condition as that in which the PLO has subsisted for 20 
years. Mr 'Arafat's daft gamble in embracing Saddam Husayn at 
the time of Desert Storm cost Fatah its rich sponsors in the 
Gulf. Once Mr 'Arafat no longer had the money to pay his troops, 
many defected. Further defections, of more committed followers, 
followed on Mr 'Arafat's second gamble: the self-government 
interim agreement with Israel. 
  Leaflets are now being distributed in the territories, in 
Fatah's name, pledging continuance of the armed struggle. Even 
those who still nominally support Mr 'Arafat are locked in 
inter-factional struggles. He has found it extremely difficult 
to nominate the 24-member Palestinian authority that is supposed 
to rule Gaza and Jericho until the elections that are supposed 
to be held four months from now. At the time of writing, only 
15 members have been nominated, and the best known are reported 
as having accepted with reluctance. 
  Leaving aside the conditional promises of billions of 
dollars 
from the international community, Yasir 'Arafat has just one 
thing going for him in the here and now: the desire of the 
people in Gaza and Jericho to see the last of the Israeli 
occupying troops. But once the troops are gone -- to the extent 
to which they are committed to going -- Mr 'Arafat will be left 
with nothing, except the odium attached, in the eyes of 
Palestinians, to the terms under which the Israelis have 
executed this limited withdrawal. 
  Under Article XVIII of the agreement signed on 4 May, "the 
PLO" is committed to various forms of military co-operation with 
the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) -- including joint patrols -- 
as well as "to take all necessary measures to prevent...hostile 
acts directed against the (Jewish) settlements, the 
infrastructure serving them and the (Israeli) military 
installations in the area." 
  Such a policy runs counter to the feelings of the population 
in the territories concerned -- especially the young -- and Mr 
'Arafat cannot even attempt to deliver on what he has promised 
to the Israelis without alienating the population he and his 
dwindling band of friends are about to attempt to govern. Last 
September, when the Declaration of Principles was signed in 
Washington, I thought the test would be a matter of whether Mr 
'Arafat's followers would be able to face down Hamas and other 
organisations bent on continuing hostilities against Israel. At 
the time, I assumed that Mr 'Arafat still had a substantial 
following, which he might just be able to equip for such a 
struggle. But he has had difficulty even in mustering the token 
force of policemen required for the initial takeover of 
installations abandoned by the Israelis. "The PLO" is in 
manifest disarray. 
  For most of last week the telephone at the PLO office in 
Jericho went unanswered, while reports from PLO headquarters in 
Tunis tell of "a group of people inhabiting a complex of offices 
who report to no one and have no idea what is to become of 
them.... People who have worked for the PLO for 20 or 30 years 
are just milling about, stunned." 
  If Mr 'Arafat tries to deliver on Article XVIII, he will be 
overwhelmed by the forces arrayed against him in a renewed 
intifadah. If he does not try to deliver, the IDF will -- 
probably informally -- resume responsibility for security in any 
areas from which attacks on Israeli targets are resumed. Either 
way, Mr Arafat is the loser. His first gamble, over Desert 
Storm, crippled the only organisation he had: Fatah. His second 
gamble, over "peace with Israel," seems certain to finish Fatah, 
and Yasir 'Arafat along with it. 
  About the only people who have cause for any degree of 
satisfaction in the immediate wake of the impending fiasco are 
Israeli diplomats in Western countries, who can now say: "You 
were always pressing us to give `territory for peace.' All 
right, we gave some territory -- Gaza, Jericho -- and just look 
what we got! No peace, only anarchy in the ceded territories and 
continued hatred and terrorism, coming out of them, against us." 
  In the longer term, some good may follow from the puncturing 
of the great illusion, of peace through the PLO and Palestinian 
self-government. Once all that nonsense is dissipated -- as it 
must be, even within the present year -- both Israeli and 
Western minds will have to concentrate on the only solid option 
that is actually attainable: peace between Syria and Israel. 
  In a move that escaped general attention last month amid the 
orgy of hype surrounding the PLO's peace process, Yitzhaq Rabin 
made the first great breakthrough towards peace with Syria. 
Showing courage and vision, Mr Rabin indicated conditional 
willingness to withdraw Jewish settlers from the Golan Heights. 
It was through a similar willingness, in the case of the 
settlers in Sinai, that Menahem Begin made peace with Egypt 
possible in 1979. 
  In both cases, the question is one of ceding territory for 
peace -- but ceding it to a former adversary who can deliver 
peace, in exchange for unencumbered territory. Anwar al-Sadat 
was able to do that. Yasir 'Arafat cannot. But Hafiz al-Asad 
can. Mr Rabin knows that and is moving that way, with the 
deliberate caution that the politics of Israel require from him. 
  There is hope there. But first, the remains of the PLO's 
peace process will have to be carted away, and that is likely to 
be an ugly business enough.

<F P=106> [Doug Payne report: "Ireland Works Up to a Boom"] </F>
  [Text] Dublin -- Ireland's jobs growth rate could double 
by the end of the decade as the country experiences boom times 
with the best economic growth and biggest rise in living 
standards since the early 1960's. 
  The growth in employment could bring with it increases in 
consumer spending -- exports are surging, and the currency 
appears finally to be taking on a life of its own; a decline in 
the birth rate also looks likely to provide some much-needed 
medium- and long-term benefit. 
  Unless there are significant unexpected changes in family 
size, emigration and, most importantly, in wage demands, the 
country's performance in the next five to six years could be the 
best recorded. 
  Both the Central Bank and the Economic and Social Research 
Institute (ESRI) have been remarkably upbeat in their most 
recent estimates -- the Central Bank in its review for the year, 
the ESRI in its Medium Term Review 1994-2000. 
  The Central Bank has increased its prediction of growth for 
the rest of the year from three to four per cent of GNP. 
Although partly based on an assumption of a gradual improvement 
in the world economy, the Central Bank is also confident of a 
rise in the volume of consumer spending and a recovery in both 
construction and business investment. It forecasts that up to 
22,000 jobs could be created. Given that the job increase last 
year was 9,000 -- and emigration was flat -- this year could see 
those without work drop to 288,000. 
  The Central Bank warns, though, that further steps to limit 
government intervention in the economy are needed: there are, 
it points out, eight social welfare recipients and eight people 
in the noncommercial state sector for every nine workers in the 
market economy. 
  The ESRI predicts annual economic growth of 4.5 per cent to 
the year 2000: growth of 20,000 jobs a year; unemployment 
dropping to 13.5 per cent; per capita income rising from 72 per 
cent of the EU [European Union] average to 83 per cent; 
inflation averaging 2.5 per cent; the national debt falling to 
60 per cent of GDP; and a falling tax burden. 
  The punt [Irish Pound] is showing signs of independence. 
Since the departure of sterling from the ERM [Exchange Rate 
Mechanism], the punt had tracked sterling closely. But the 
markets of late have begun to more accurately reflect low Irish 
inflation and better growth prospects. The punt, worth 98 
pence, is within a whisker of sterling as opposed to 92 pence 
last August. If it continues on its own path, however, it is 
also unlikely to show a decline in its trade-weighted value 
against all other currencies beyond last year's 2.2 per cent. 
  It is also likely that the bond market will reflect this 
strength; analysts from Dublin-based Davy stockbrokers suggest a 
fall in the yield on five-year bonds by the end of this year 
from 7.3 per cent to 6.15 per cent. Davy's expect interest 
rates closer to 5.5 per cent, which would provide a necessary 
fillip to retail rates 
  Exports also remain strong. Last year's world recession 
couldn't dampen an 8.75 per cent surge to IR18.1bn [Irish 
Pounds] (26bn), give in a cumulative increase for the past five 
years of 23 per cent. Given that world trade grew 2.6 per cent 
last year the Irish export figure reflected the attainment of an 
increasing market share at the expense of international 
competitors. 
  The Irish boom is likely to peak next year but growth should 
remain robust until the end of the decade. The main pay-off 
will be in jobs; between 1994 and 2000 the number at work in 
Ireland should expand from 1.155 million to 1.285 million, an 
increase of 130,000, or an average yearly increase of 1.7 per 
cent -- almost double the growth figure since 1990. 
  Unemployment will fall from 16.9 per cent this year, says 
the 
ESRI, to 13.4 per cent by 2000. Significantly, agricultural 
employment will continue to plummet. The expected decline in 
the birth rate will bring a rapid drop in those entering the 
work force from the year 2000, and a major increase in the 
proportion of the population in working age groups (with a 
resulting boost in tax revenues). 
  Last year's birth rate was estimated at 13.7 per 1,000 (EU 
average is 11.6 per cent), and has fallen since. Children under 
15 were 27 per cent of l991's population, by 2005 this is 
expected to be 18 per cent, resulting in lower education 
spending. Ireland has a small proportion of those over 65 -- 
just 11 per cent in 1991. A gradual rise over the next decade 
should allow planners to cushion resulting demands on health and 
social services. If ESRI projections are correct, 1995 could 
see a surge in confidence, with investment topping 16 per cent 
and staying above ten per cent in 1996. But a sharp rise in 
interest rates, for example, could, if tied to a sterling dive 
and a wild wage price spiral, put out everything.

  [Text] Bonn -- During the German presidency of the 
European Union [EU] in the second half of 1994, the Federal 
Government wants to tackle the upcoming tasks "in close 
cooperation" with Paris. Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free 
Democratic Party of Germany) confirmed this during the debate on 
European policies at the Federal Assembly. Among other things, 
he cited "modernization to ensure the transition to the age of 
information" to create future jobs as one of the major tasks. 
  Moreover, the prosperity gap vis-a-vis Central and East 
Europe must be removed, and the eastern neighboring countries 
must be moved closer to the western stability zone and to the EU 
in the long run. As the state located at the center of Europe, 
Germany feels particularly great responsibility. Kinkel also 
stressed that practical progress must be achieved soon 
concerning police cooperation and a common asylum and 
immigration policy. 
  The reason for the debate of the Federal Assembly was the 
upcoming German EU presidency. Representatives of the laender 
unanimously called for more democracy and closeness to the 
citizens in the European Union. Saarland Minister-President 
Oskar Lafontaine (Social Democratic Party of Germany) stated 
that the course for the reform of the EU, scheduled for 1996, 
must be set during the German presidency in the second half of 
1994. Europe must not become a super state. 
  Saxony Minister-President Biedenkopf (Christian Democratic 
Union) demanded that clear information should soon be provided 
as to how the Central and East European states are to be 
incorporated in the EU. Biedenkopf confirmed the call for more 
rights for the European Parliament.

  [Text] Oxford (DPA) -- According to Defense Minister Volker 
Ruehe, Russia is entitled to play a certain special role in 
security partnership with NATO, but it should not make 
exaggerated demands. In a speech at St. Antony's College of 
Oxford University on 19 May, Ruehe said according to the draft 
text that Russia should not be treated like Tajikistan or 
Albania. "However, it must learn to see itself as Russia, as 
neighbor among neighbors, and as a partner among basically 
equals, and act accordingly." He said it was understandable 
that Russia as a big power wanted to play a part in pan-European 
security issues. Moscow should become a strategic partner of 
NATO, but "must not hinder our neighbors' step-by-step 
integration into Western structures."

  [Text] Bonn -- The government wants to build 2,000 
apartments for ethnic Germans in western Siberia before the end 
of the year. This was announced by the government's 
representative for resettlers, State Secretary Horst 
Waffenschmidt (Christian Democratic Union), in Bonn today. 
  The apartments are designed for ethnic Germans who do not 
want to emigrate to Germany, but who are looking for new homes 
because of the unstable situation in their home country, 
particularly in Kazakhstan. The government wants to provide 30 
million German marks for these measures and buy houses, build 
new homes, or grant credits for self-help measures. At present, 
about 600,000 ethnic Germans are living in western Siberia.

  [Text] Bonn -- The Bundestag adopted the law on the fight 
against crime with the votes of the coalition today. It is 
designed to accelerate legal proceedings, to increase the 
punishment for drug dealers, and to make possible the 
involvement of the Federal Intelligence Service in the fight 
against criminal gangs. The Social Democratic Party of Germany 
[SPD] rejected the law and announced improvements by the 
Bundesrat. 
  The Bundestag unanimously adopted several amendments to laws 
making the fight against right-wing radicalism more efficient. 
Among other things, denying the killing of Jews by the National 
Socialists and the wearing of Nazi symbols will become 
punishable.

  [Text] Munich (DPA) -- Despite declining numbers last 
year, one should not expect a general decline of politically 
motivated arson and bomb attacks. According to the news 
magazine FOCUS, this is what the Federal Office of Criminal 
Investigations (BKA) has noted in a confidential study. 
According to investigations, experts noted a decline of attacks 
"at a high level," since attacks went from 901 in 1992 to 540 in 
1993. A return to the situation in 1990 with 128 acts of 
violence of this kind cannot be expected, however, experts think. 
  According to BKA findings, 300 attacks last year were 
motivated by right-wing extremism. A total of 150 acts of 
violence were committed by radical foreigners. According to the 
BKA, xenophobic actions have declined clearly. In some of the 
new laender, this kind of crime went down by 75 percent. In 
1993 the most peaceful laender were Thuringia, Bavaria, and 
Saarland.

the attack by right-wing radicals on the Marietta bar in 
Magdeburg on 12 May was planned. The personnel received a 
corresponding hint before 12 May but did not inform the police, 
Saxony-Anhalt Senior Public Prosecutor Juergen Hossfeld told 
journalists in Magdeburg today. Five black Africans fled to the 
bar after being brutally beaten and chased through the streets 
by about 60 right-wing radicals. 
  One day before the riots, the Federal Office for the 
Protection of the Constitution warned the police against attacks 
by right-wing extremists. Interior and Justice Minister Walter 
Remmers (Christian Democratic Union) stressed that there was no 
reason to assume that the suspicions of the Federal Office for 
the Protection of the Constitution would come true.

  [Text] Magdeburg (DPA) -- Saxony-Anhalt Free Democratic 
Party [FDP] chairman Peter Kunert has called upon his party's 
representatives to vote for the Johannes Rau, the Social 
Democratic Party's [SPD] candidate, in the presidential election 
in Berlin on 23 May. In a statement published in Magdeburg on 
20 May, he says that it would be a wrong signal to vote for a 
conservative like Roman Herzog, the candidate of the Christian 
Democratic Union/Christian Social Union. 
  Kunert does not assume that his own party's candidate, 
Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher, will get a majority of the Federal 
Convention. He argues that, unlike Herzog, Rau has the 
capability of integrating people and building bridges beyond 
ideological differences. Kunert says that the social democrat 
could be the federal president of all Germans, beyond party 
borders.

  [Excerpt] Hamburg (DPA) -- The Federal Executive Committee 
has removed its own chairman, Bernd Schuenemann, from office and 
simultaneously initiated proceedings on his expulsion from the 
party. The majority in the executive committee accuses the 
Munich lawyer of having violated the statutes, resolutions of 
the Federal Executive Committee, and principles of the party. 
  "On his own authority," Schuenemann pursued the founding of 
an Instead Party in Saarland and did not check the infiltration 
of former Republikaner into the organization, Deputy Chairman 
Mike Bashford stated in Hamburg on Wednesday [18 May]. The 
decision to take such massive action against the chairman, who 
was only elected at the end of March, was made by six of the 11 
executive committee members on Tuesday evening. [passage

more than 40,000 members. This is the result of an increase in 
members, which has continued since 1993, as the federal 
headquarters reported on Thursday [19 May]. With 36,320 
members, the absolute low of the past few years was December 
1992. In the first quarter of 1994, the party had 40,686 
registered members -- 37,914 in the west and 2,772 in the east

  [Text] Bonn May 19 (CTK) -- By its "sharp rejection" of 
official dialogue with the Sudeten Germans and by "dubious 
attacks" on Austria and its Foreign Minister Alois Mock the 
Czech Republic is making a "mistake," Sudeten German 
Landsmannschaft (SL) Chairman Franz Neubauer said today in 
reaction to statements made by the leading Czech politicians. 
  He said that Prague's "sharp reaction" to his letter to the 
chairmen of the Czech coalition parties inviting them to start a 
dialogue and to attend the SL forthcoming congress in Nuremberg 
was incomprehensible. It clearly shows that the Sudeten German 
question is indeed open and urgently demands a solution, he said. 
  Neubauer recalled that in 1990 the Czechoslovak ambassador 
to 
Germany accepted a similar invitation to a SL meeting and a year 
later it was also accepted by a Czechoslovak parliamentary 
delegation. It was therefore incomprehensible to him why such 
an invitation should be a "provocation" this year. 
  Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus, who was invited to come to 
Nuremberg by Neubauer, described the invitation as a 
"provocation." 
  At the close of his statement today Neubauer thanked Mock 
for 
clearly expressing his stance on the Sudeten German question and 
for not being reluctant to receive the SL's European Charles IV 
award. 
  Mock who is to be presented the award at the SL' weekend 
congress in Nuremberg, in the latest issue of the 
SUDETENDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG magazine supported in a diplomatic way 
contacts between Sudeten Germans and the Czech side. He 
indirectly compared their postwar expulsion from Czechoslovakia 
to ethnic purges in the current Balkan war.

  [Text] Nuremberg, Germany May 20 (CTK) -- The realisation 
of the right to homeland and self-determination just as the 
abolition of president Edvard Benes's decrees on the postwar 
transfer of Sudeten Germans and expropriation of their property 
should be the result of a dialogue with the Czechs sought by the 
Sudeten Germans, Franz Neubauer said today. 
  Speaking at a press conference on the eve of the 45th 
Sudeten 
German Days, to be held in Nuremberg at the weekend, Neubauer, 
spokesman for the Sudeten German Landsmannschaft (SL), said that 
the Sudeten Germans were interested in "a mutually acceptable 
solution" and were not demanding anything impossible. 
  Without specifying, Neubauer said that the Czech Republic 
had 
indicated to Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel and Bavarian Premier Edmund Stoiber prospects of such a 
dialogue. 
  Neubauer explained the right to homeland as allowing Sudeten 
Germans to live in their former homeland and to have equal 
rights like other citizens, including the right to vote. By 
abolishing the Benes decrees, the Czech Republic would 
dissociate itself from the principle of "expulsion" and property 
confiscation. The SL demands collective settlement because the 
Germans were expelled collectively as well, Neubauer said. 
  The Benes decrees, approved by the Potsdam conference of the 
victorious powers, affected about 2.5 million Sudeten Germans. 
  Asked by CTK on what basis the SL wanted to conduct a 
dialogue with the Czech party in a situation where the 
Landsmannschaft had rejected the German-Czechoslovak treaty of 
1992, which both parties had called a positive contribution to 
building a new Europe, Neubauer said that "not the treaty, but 
goodwill is what matters." 
  He pointed out that the Czechs were putting up for auction 
the former Sudeten German property while property questions were 
not addressed by the treaty, but were left open. 
  Turning to the work group which is to deal lodge a possible 
complaint against the Benes decrees with the Hague-based 
International Court of Justice, Neubauer said that the lodging 
of the complaint did not have to be accelerated, adding that the 
Landsmannschaft preferred negotiations. 
  Reacting to Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus recent rejection of 
the invitation to attend the SL congress, calling it 
provocation, Neubauer said that the SL "will not let itself be 
provoked" by the term "provocation." 
  Hans Sehling, chairman of the `Sudeten German Parliament', 
who was present at the press conference, said that he had 
information from "certain sources" that a "crisis committee" had 
been set up in the Czech Republic in connection with the Sudeten 
German Days. Asked at what level the committee was, Sehling 
declined to reply. 
  Neubauer said Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock, who will 
be presented with the highest Sudeten German distinction -- the 
Charles IV Award -- at the SL congress, as "an ardent defender 
of the European idea." He did not mention Mock's contribution to 
the protection of the German expellees' interests which Sudeten 
German circles say unofficially is the main reason for the 
decision to confer it on Mock. 
  Charles IV (1316-78) was King of Bohemia and Roman Emperor. 
  The winners of the award, conferred by the SL on those who 
have contributed to understanding among nations, include former 
Belgian Premier Leo Tindemans (1978), former Bavarian Premier 
Franz Josef Strauss, former German President Karl Carstens 
(1991) who has been the only German president to attend the 
Sudeten German Days during his tenure, and European Parliament 
President Egon Klepsch (1993). 
  It is expected that the participants in the 45th Sudeten 
German Days will be addressed by Mock, German Interior Minister 
Manfred Kanther (CDU), German Finance Minister Theo Waigel (CSU) 
and Bavarian Premier Edmund Stoiber (CSU).

  [Text] Bielefeld (DPA) -- On Wednesday [18 May] evening, 
FRG Finance Minister and Christian Social Union [CSU] Chairman 
Theo Waigel vehemently defended the strict austerity course of 
the FRG Government. The financial scope for new expenses and 
"social charitable acts" are not currently available, the 
minister said at a Christian Democratic Union event on the 
European election in Bielefeld. Bonn's priority objective must 
be a solid financial and tax policy. One must not deviate from 
the course of annual savings of 70 billion German marks, he said. 
  For this year, Waigel predicted an economic growth of 1.5 
percent in the old laender and 7 to 10 percent in eastern 
Germany. The inflation rate will probably have a two before the 
decimal at the end of 1994. "Things are improving again; we 
have the problems under control," the minister said.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- German exports to the Arab states 
increased 2 percent to 15.8 billion German marks [DM] in 1993. 
The main importer of German products was Saudi Arabia, which 
bought goods worth DM3.6 billion (1992 -- DM4.2 billion) from 
Germany, the Federal Economics Ministry stated in Bonn on 19 
May. The United Arab Emirates replaced Egypt as second most 
important buyer, purchasing goods worth DM2.2 billion (up 26.6 
percent). Similarly high growth rates were reached in German 
exports to Syria and Lebanon. Exports to Egypt increased 11.8 
percent to DM2.1 billion. 
  German imports from the Arab states only reached the value 
of 
DM11.2 billion (down 7.3 percent). A good two-thirds of the 
imports was crude oil. Even though quantitatively, 1.2 percent 
more crude oil was imported, the oil bill decreased by 5.6 
percent to DM7.5 billion because of lower crude oil prices.

Germany's imports from Latin America decreased by 15.1 percent 
to 12.4 billion German marks [DM] in 1993. All big Latin 
American countries were affected by it, which is shown by 
statistics published by the FRG Economics Ministry in Bonn on 
Thursday [19 May]. Smaller countries like Bolivia and Paraguay 
registered gains. 
  However, German exports to Latin America increased by 7.2 
percent to DM14.8 billion. For the first time after 1991, this 
resulted in a trade surplus for Germany again.

  [Excerpt] Schwerin (DPA) -- The new EU [European Union] 
structural funds for eastern Germany will be made available as 
soon as possible. A group of experts will be set up to remove 
any existing problems of a structural improvement concept. This 
is what the minister-presidents of the new laender and the 
president of the European Commission, Jacques Delors, agreed 
upon in Schwerin on 13 May. 
  Since the beginning of this year, the new laender have 
formed 
part of the highest category of EU aid, the so-called target-1 
regions. From 1994 to 1999, they will receive a total of 
approximately 27.5 billion German marks [EU] from the EC 
structural fund. So far, it was not clear in what way and for 
what purpose the structural funds were to be used. The EU, the 
Federal Government, and the new laender have negotiated for 
months on a common aid concept for eastern Germany. That is why 
the EU funds could not flow into the new laender. [passage

  [Text] Bonn -- The government, the laender, and the 
communes are facing sizable tax losses in 1995 and the following 
years as compared with the medium-term planning. As a result of 
the recession, lower wages, prices, and interest rates, 21 
million German marks [DM] less will be available in 1995 than 
estimated as recently as in May last year. The government alone 
will receive DM9.9 billion less. This was announced by the tax 
assessment working group today after four days of consultations 
at the Finance Ministry. 
  Finance Minister Theo Waigel (Christian Social Union) stated 
that this shortfall in receipts can be absorbed in the 1995 
budget. The projection of the global shortfall serves this 
goal. In addition, personnel reductions are planned, and 
privatization will also yield proceeds. Waigel called on the 
laender and communes to exercise strict discipline concerning 
expenditure to curb the overall new indebtedness. 
  Waigel considers the shortfall that has been caused by the 
economic situation to be a consequence of last year's serious 
recession but also the result of the "agreeable moderate 
development of wages, prices, and interest rates." They will 
have a dampening effect on the increase in the nominal tax 
revenue in the coming years. Thus, the assessment also reflects 
the "success of our stability policy." 
  In view of the economic development, DM2.7 billion more in 
tax revenues are expected to be earned as compared with the 
short-term assessment for 1994. A total of DM375.9 billion fall 
on the government, which results in an additional DM1.9 billion.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Antonio Martino by Rodolfo </F>
Brancoli in Rome; date not given: "Martino: No Adventures in 
Foreign Policy, We Are Loyal to Europe"] 
  [Text] Rome -- The international offensive by the 
Berlusconi government is to begin in Brussels, a sort of 
"operation information" which is the absolute priority of 
Italian diplomacy. A wave of telegrams sent from the Foreign 
Ministry will make all the ambassadors who represent Italy in 
the EC countries converge on the Belgian capital Sunday [15 May] 
so that they can agree with Minister Martino on what should be 
said and done to begin restoring an image which, at this time, 
could not be any worse. The next day the minister is to meet 
with [EC Commission President] Delors and take part in a meeting 
with his colleagues, even at the price of sweeping aside the 
planned statements by the president of the Council. "It is 
essential that we quickly make it understood that we do not 
intend to renounce Italy's European vocation," said Antonio 
Martino in his new office on the second floor of the Foreign 
Ministry. Soon afterward, there will be a visit to Washington. 
The objective is to complete the "clarification" before the G-7 
summit, which is to start on 8 July in Naples and which will 
mark Silvio Berlusconi's grand international debut. There is 
not a lot of time, and no Italian Government has ever been so 
gripped by distrust and reservations. 
  [Brancoli] Minister, how will you be impacted by making a 
debut at the head of the Italian Foreign Ministry in such a 
climate? 
  [Martino] It is certainly a difficult time, for objective 
reasons and also for reasons having to do with our image. We 
must make it quite clear to both international public opinion 
and our allies that the radical change in our political system 
does not mean discontinuity in the basic lines of our foreign 
policy. Foreign policy will be characterized, above all, by 
continuity. I do not mean that nothing will change, but I do 
mean that the basic lines will stay the same. 
  [Brancoli] Good, but I think that your interlocutors will 
ask 
you first of all for other explanations and other guarantees. I 
do not need to remind you of how the government of which you are 
part was received, or of the alarmed questions that were raised. 
  [Martino] I would say that our country has turned a page in 
its history and adopted a more modern electoral system which 
will force us to change the attitude toward what were once 
considered extreme attitudes, and as such were marginalized. I 
would then say that we need to look at the government program, 
which nobody can honestly say is a right-wing program. The same 
program by the National Alliance was drafted by people who have 
nothing to do with, I would not say fascism, but the Italian 
Social Movement. 
  [Brancoli] The NEW YORK TIMES -- and it is not the only one 
-- wondered whether there is a risk of contamination. 
  [Martino] That is mistaken. It does not make sense to talk 
about contamination. In our elections it is true that the Left 
was defeated, but is not true that the Right won. I would 
explain that Forza Italia, the authentic novel element in this 
coalition, draws its inspiration from the great liberal 
tradition, occupying a central position in the old scheme of 
things. I would also underline the importance of the change 
made among politicians. 
  [Brancoli] The FINANCIAL TIMES feels that the new government 
has a "worrying lack" of experience. 
  [Martino] We have already experienced expert politicians, 
and 
it was not a good experience. 
  [Brancoli] Meanwhile, however, friendly and allied 
governments are discussing the "Italian case," and there is even 
talk of a cordon sanitaire. Do you not fear isolation? 
  [Martino] Honestly no. I do not fear it because the picture 
is a mixed one. There are governments which have shown that 
they understand what is happening here in Italy, and the press 
in some countries has been much more articulate in its judgments 
than in other countries. We are also taking account of the 
electoral climate for the European elections, which causes 
political people in some countries to make strong affirmations 
for domestic purposes. I feel that when we will come out of 
this, the climate will change, and naturally we will not be 
sitting there hand in hand. This image problem is the first 
thing. 
  [Brancoli] There are also problems of substance. For 
example, your position on the Osimo Treaty [on borders with the 
former Yugoslavia] will take on symbolic importance for 
understanding who you are. 
  [Martino] Among all the members of the pole of freedom there 
is absolute agreement on some points. First, the borders will 
not be touched. Second, we have no intention of just throwing 
out the treaty. Third, there are bilateral problems which can 
be tackled calmly, without creating a big drama. As a supporter 
of laissez- faire, I have always loathed the borders. 
  [Brancoli] Let us move on to Europe. You are described not 
only as a "Euroskeptic," but even as anti-EC. 
  [Martino] Do you think it possible that the son of Gaetano 
Martino could be anti-European? 
  [Brancoli] I will quote [French Socialist Party Secretary 
General] Rocard for you: "It is not enough to say that you 
support Europe. You have to say which Europe you support." 
  [Martino] He is right. But we know that we can also agree on 
what Europe must do. The point is how do we achieve it. 
Choosing a mistaken strategy means, in actual fact, creating 
anti-European sentiment, and thus meaning that we do not achieve 
it. 
  [Brancoli] You, for example, criticize the strategy of 
monetary unification. 
  [Martino] That is nothing new. I feel that after what 
happened in September 1992, with the de facto collapse of the 
European exchange rate mechanism, defending the strategy of 
European monetary unification would be the same as defending a 
problematic position against all evidence to the contrary. 
However, this does not mean that I am against the European 
currency -- just as I am not anti- European when I criticize 
excessive intervention on markets. I would like to reiterate 
that an excess of directives creates an impression among the 
people that Europe is just another level of regulation 
superimposed on national regulations. The reaction of rejection 
is visible. 
  [Brancoli] I will quote for you a question asked by LE 
MONDE: 
What will be the European policy of Berlusconi's Italy? 
  [Martino] It will be a convinced and active policy in favor 
of a political Europe, something which is absolutely necessary. 
Europe must find a way of speaking with a single voice only in 
matters of foreign policy. It must also achieve a common 
defense. The United States, among others, has asked for this 
because it realized that the pax americana is an illusion. 
  [Brancoli] How would you reproach previous governments' 
European policies? 
  [Martino] My criticism would mainly be that they did not 
allow our presence in Europe to be up to the level of Italians' 
enthusiasm for Europe. There was also a widespread perception 
in the political class that the power was only at national level 
and therefore our presence in the institutions could be 
entrusted to people with a low political profile. At the same 
time, paradoxically, the idea prevailed that Europe is the 
solution to all our problems, when it is actually the opposite 
that is true. We have to solve our problems independently of 
our membership in Europe, knowing that if we fail to solve them 
we will become incompatible with the other member states. 
  [Brancoli] For many years now there has been very broad 
agreement about our foreign policy. How much value do you 
attach to maintaining it? 
  [Martino] A lot of value. In fact, I have already had 
contacts with members of the opposition. Our foreign policy 
must aim to serve the national interest. It is also important 
that the main lines are understood and shared by the greatest 
number of people possible. It seems to me that there are 
conditions for a foreign policy based on a broad consensus. 
  [Brancoli] Judging by the debate, it would seem, however, 
that your arrival in the government has swept the issue aside. 
  [Martino] I believe that when we get down to work, if we 
manage to keep the channels of information open with all the 
political forces, we will manage to extract foreign policy from 
the guerrilla warfare of ordinary politics. Naturally, there 
can be differences of opinion on individual points: We cannot 
follow a policy which is the weighted average of the opinions 
prevailing in parliament. However, the general lines can be 
broadly shared. 
  [Brancoli] One condition is that you do not end up isolating 
Italy in the decisionmaking bodies. 
  [Martino] Both of these are linked. If we have an 
authoritative, credible, and acceptable foreign policy, then we 
will also have the chance to give it prominence in international 
organizations. This is a new Italy. It has turned a page. It 
will surprise a lot of people.

<F P=106> [Report by "R.R.": "Occhetto Very Critical: Unfit </F>
Government"] 
  [Text] Rome -- All [Prime Minister] Silvio Berlusconi's 
allies and Confindustria [General Confederation of Italian 
Industry] like his program, but it is the subject of a barrage 
of attacks from the opposition forces of both Left and Center. 
And Gianfranco Miglio did not like the image of the "dream" 
taken from Martin Luther King: "He is one of the people I 
abhor," he commented, caustic as ever, "like all preachers and 
people of that kind." The Northern League's Roberto Maroni was 
pleased, appreciating the pragmatic nature of the speech and its 
references to federalism. According to Gianfranco Fini 
[National Alliance], "Berlusconi is not only someone who likes 
specifics, but someone who is quite clear about this 
government's political profile." New Minister Clemente 
Mastella, of the CCD [Christian Democratic Center], was excited 
by the prospect of a million new jobs: "It is like an athlete 
trying to beat the world record." 
  The comments from adversaries were very different. While on 
the one hand reassuring Berlusconi, ("ours will be a democratic 
and constitutional opposition,") Occhetto reaffirmed his very 
tough verdict: "This government humiliates Italy because of its 
unfitness, the intrigues and maneuverings that accompanied its 
formation, and the violation of the promises made to the 
voters." As for its program, the PDS [Democratic Party of the 
Left] leader described it as "very vague," and described as 
"frightening" the absence of any reference to the issue of 
southern Italy. Cesare Salvi, the PDS Senate leader, was blunt 
about it: "Our `no' is unconditional." Luigi Berlinguer, the 
PDS floor leader in the Chamber of Deputies, observed: "Rather 
than a government program, it seems to me more like a television 
program." Armando Cossutta, leader of the Communist Renewal 
caucus, dismissed the speech "for three reasons: the failure to 
reject all vestiges of fascism; the arrogance displayed with 
regard to the political and ethical incompatibility between his 
assets and the prime ministership; and because in economics he 
is even further to the Right than Confindustria." The PSI's 
[Italian Socialist Party] Ottaviano del Turco dismissed it as 
follows: "Reticent on the subject of fascism, vague with regard 
to guarantees, and generic with regard to all the points in the 
program." The Rete's Mancuso criticized the speech for being 
"obvious" and "demagogic, designed to win easy applause on the 
subject of [killed anti-Mafia judges] Falcone and Borsellino." 
Without going into details, the Democratic Alliance's Passigli 
reaffirmed: "None of us will vote in favor." The Greens too 
were tough; they do not believe in Berlusconi's promises with 
regard to environmentalism: "If it really interested him," 
Manconi said, "he would not have granted the ministry to 
Matteoli, who is a real enemy of the environment." On the 
Center, officially all the responses are negative. "It would be 
irresponsible to grant a vote of confidence," Rosy Bindi 
commented; "it would be like setting a locomotive on a track in 
the knowledge that you cannot in any way influence its course 
and direction." Segni [Pact for Italy] called it "a second-rate 
speech, just as the government team is second-rate." Senator 
Agnelli summed it up as follows: "The part on foreign policy 
was excellent, the part on economic policy was good, and the 
rest was mediocre." He will decide how to vote after hearing 
Berlusconi's reply. Giovanni Spadolini [Italian Republican 
Party], however, has already decided not to vote in favor. 
Roland Riz (South Tyrol People's Party) considers the speech 
"good on the whole" but nevertheless confirmed that he will not 
be granting his vote of confidence. Cesare Dujany (Val D'Aosta 
Union) is still undecided, but wants more guarantees with regard 
to local government. Last, the social partners. Confindustria 
"acknowledges with pleasure" Berlusconi's pledges, and positive 
assessments also came from Confartigianato [General 
Confederation of Italian Artisans and Craftsmen] and CIDA 
(business managers). The trade unions were more cautious, 
preferring to judge the government on its actions.
