<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Poland/Italy: President Walesa in </F>
Rome"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 18 -- Polish President Lech Walesa 
arrived in Rome today with a large delegation of Warsaw 
government representatives to a welcome led by Polish Premier 
Waldemar Pawlak, who came to this capital yesterday. 
  Following Walesa's arrival, aboard a Polish Air Force flight 
which landed at the Ciampino military and civilian airport, the 
full delegation departed for Cassino, midway between Rome and 
Naples, for a ceremony marking the 50th anniversary of the World 
War II battle of Montecassino. 
  In fierce fighting during the offensive mounted against a 
German stronghold by Allied troops, including the II Polish Army 
Corps, more than 2,000 Polish soldiers were killed. Cassino is 
also the site of Italy's largest Polish cemetery. 
  This evening, the visiting president will return to Rome for 
a meeting with Head of State Oscar Luigi Scalfaro. Tomorrow, 
Walesa will go to Rome's Catholic Gemelli Hospital for a visit 
to his friend and compatriot, Pope John Paul II, who is 
recovering from surgery following a broken leg. The president 
will return to Warsaw tomorrow in the early afternoon.

<F P=106> [Interview with Justice Minister Alfredo Biondi by Marco </F>
Nese in Rome; date not given: "Biondi: If the Skinheads Do Not 
Commit Criminal Offenses, We Must Grant Them Freedom of Speech" 
-- first paragraph is CORRIERE DELLA SERA introduction] 
  [Text] Rome -- What does the government intend to do to 
stop the skinheads? "We have laws which allow us to take 
action," [Justice Minister] Alfredo Biondi asserted. "In the 
first place we must evaluate the phenomenon. If we consider it 
an attempt to reconstitute the Fascist Party, or even as a 
dangerous subversive faction, there are ad hoc norms regulating 
this kind of activity. If, however, we regard the phenomenon as 
an episode indicating the attitude of a minority group, however 
raving the latter may be, one has to accept it, because freedom 
of speech is sacred, even when it manifests itself somewhere 
between folklore and cretinism." 
  [Nese] But can we agree to skinheads marching in the 
streets? 
  [Biondi] In civilized countries people who are considered a 
bit freakish also have the right to express their views. In 
front of the White House, for example, you always find the 
strangest kinds of people, who protest for ideological, 
political, or even personal reasons. Nobody would dream of 
silencing them. 
  [Nese] A law has been passed in Germany condemning anyone 
who 
denies that the Holocaust took place. 
  [Biondi] This means hindering freedom of speech. We have no 
reason to pass repressive laws. There is no need for them. 
Rather, inside our country there ought to be a moral and civil 
rejection of the skinhead phenomenon. What they do, and what 
they believe in, must make us reflect and lead our consciences 
to reject them. 
  [Nese] Are you not concerned that a neofascist movement may 
cluster around these subversive groups? 
  [Biondi] I believe Italy is mature enough to rule out any 
fascist danger. A movement of this kind would have no 
following, people are not nurturing any revanchist furor. 
  [Nese] How can these groups be stopped, then? How can they 
be prevented from causing any harm? 
  [Biondi] I believe that if the late Bassaglia were still 
alive, he would gladly reopen the lunatic asylums so as to lock 
up these weird characters in them. From a legal point of view, 
I think that we ought to be strong enough to allow them to have 
their say too. If there is the right to freedom of speech, then 
it must apply to everybody. The right to freedom of speech 
involves a risk. If we grant this right, then we cannot 
discriminate against anyone in particular. We are used to 
considering the things we like good, and the things we dislike 
unfair. This is making things too easy for us. 
  [Nese] What if the skinheads carry out acts of violence? 
  [Biondi] Then it is a different story. If their actions 
constitute an offense, then of course we must intervene. But 
what I would like to stress is that, as long as they limit 
themselves to folklore, this cannot lead to a reaction. An 
offense must first have been committed. Once I defended a judge 
according to whom Jews could not be convicted because they had 
committed deicide. I took up his defense because, although his 
views were aberrant, he had the right to express them. He 
deserved to be rebuked, not convicted. And the charges against 
him were dropped.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Maroni Rules Out Nazi Effect on </F>
European Vote"] 
  [Excerpts] (ANSA) Rome, May 17 -- Italian Interior Minister 
Roberto Maroni said here this evening that he expects 
intimidation by Nazi extreme right groups or other "criminal 
phenomena" to play no role when the Italians go to the polls in 
the European elections next month. 
  The role of swastika-toting Nazis and other extreme 
rightists 
in the new Italian political scenario hit the headlines when 
hundreds of mostly youngish shaven-headed, leather-jacketed Nazi 
skinheads marched the streets in Vicenza on Saturday afternoon 
[14 May]. 
  "I don't think the Nazi skinheads or other criminal 
phenomena 
can influence the regular prosecution of the coming European and 
local elections," said Maroni, who reacted to the local 
prefect's failure to ban the march by recalling the local police 
chief and the local representative of the central executive to 
Rome. "Everything is ready, we've taken every precaution, and 
everything will proceed with the maximum of calm and order, even 
in the hot zones," the minister asserted in a TV interview 
broadcast this evening as a curtain-raiser for the election 
campaign. 
  Chatting with reporters earlier, Maroni said his first 
knowledge of the Nazi demonstration was when police chief, 
Vincenzo Parisi, rang him and asked him to switch on the TV: 
"That was when I learned of the demonstration." Maroni was 
reported to be meeting Justice Minister Alfredo Biondi on the 
question of pro-Nazi and fascist political activity later today, 
at a time when hard-rightists with a neo-fascist past have been 
given ministerial responsibility in an Italian government for 
the first time since World War II. 
  In the furore surrounding Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's 
appointment of National Alliance ministers and undersecretaries, 
Maroni's prompt sacking of Vicenza's prefect has come under fire 
for allegedly infringing freedom speech. At the same time, 
apparently unrepentant neo-fascist MPs from the National 
Alliance filed a motion to repeal constitutional wording 
outlawing the Fascist Party and attempts to recreate it. 
  Officials at the prosecutor's office in Vicenza said the 
slogans on show Saturday were closer to Fascism than classical 
Nazism and were "close to the limits" laid down by the law. 
"The big effect was in political, rather than penal or public 
order terms," said one official of Maroni's decision to recall 
the prefect. "Certainly, there is a `bad' right and the `good' 
right would like to exorcise it." [passage omitted] 
  The meeting between Maroni and Biondi was organised after 
the 
publication of a dismissive interview in which the Justice 
Minister was quoted as urging the need to defend the right to 
freedom of expression, even when it is an expression "between 
folklore and cretinism". At the Justice Ministry, a statement 
pointed out that Italian -- and European -- laws against the 
violent extreme right had been extended two years ago when the 
first recrudescence of neo-Nazi and fascist violence appeared. 
"We have the laws we need to intervene," Biondi was quoted as 
saying. "We now have to evaluate the phenomenon." 
  In his later gloss on the interview, Biondi claimed he 
simply 
asserted that it was up to the administrative authorities to 
decide whether or not to allow demonstrations that "may seem 
seditious or repress them as they develop. It is up to the 
judiciary to assess whether the demonstrations are a crime and 
therefore to be considered under penal law." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Mario Monti: "Constraints and Necessities"] </F>
  [Text] "Disciplined and strict economic liberalism." These 
are the words -- kindly taken from the "memorandum for the new 
government" published here on 8 May -- that the prime minister 
chose to describe his government's economic policy line in his 
program speech to parliament. 
  It was not an obvious choice. The election platforms of some 
of the parties of the majority raised a fundamental question. 
Will the new majority's social base and political 
representatives, I wonder, be able to display impatience with 
state control, with rigidity, and with unproductive situations 
without, however, being taken over by impatience with the 
discipline of the state budget and with the rules that must 
govern the market? 
  Of course, this question remains. It will be answered by 
actual conduct, not by policy statements. But by espousing the 
concept of "disciplined and strict economic liberalism," the 
prime minister accepts that it is on the basis of this 
criterion, and no others, that his government's economic policy 
must be judged. 
  A negligent laissez-faire attitude to the rules that must 
govern the market, or a correct market economy accompanied by an 
unbalanced public finance situation are as much to be rejected 
as the state control that it is intended to combat. 
  A government that espouses this aim and that accepts being 
judged on the basis of this aim is accepting an even clearer and 
stricter constraint, I think, than if it had submitted a program 
full of figures. 
  Of course, the time for figures and specific measures will 
come soon. For the time being, the bare guidelines of the 
program permit us to hope that the anxieties expressed in our 
"memorandum" will be kept well in mind. 
  The aim for the "first 100 days" is indeed to boost the 
economy -- but less to the detriment of the state budget than 
was expected. Of the seven measures announced for the first 100 
days, six are, appropriately, directed toward enhancing the 
flexibility of the markets; and only one places a burden, at 
least in the immediate term, on the budget (tax relief for firms 
creating new jobs). Further tax incentives seem to have been 
postponed for a later stage. It was correct to say: 
"Intervention in support of the economy...will only really be 
such if they are compatible with the reform of the public 
finance situation." 
  Still with regard to public finance, the idea has been 
accepted -- indeed, how could it not? -- that, despite the work 
begun by the Amato and Ciampi governments, the legacy inherited 
is a very onerous one. But if it is so, how could a policy to 
boost the economy be based on placing a further burden on the 
budget? 
  As for the government's position on Economic and Monetary 
Union [EMU] -- another fear in recent weeks -- the following 
wise statement was made: "A careful examination of the 
Maastricht Treaty must not delay the implementation of the 
unification program." 
  Public finance reform and European Union. If we connect 
these two matters --the prime minister did not do so, but 
perhaps his program speech was not the right place for this -- 
we must consider two necessities. 
  First, the need for Italy not to evade the monitoring 
procedure connected with the next installment of the Community 
loan -- a useful and visible stimulus to the correction of the 
state budget for 1994, though from a currency viewpoint the loan 
will certainly be less necessary than was estimated at the 
beginning of 1993. 
  Second, the need in a few months' time -- once a stringent 
finance bill for 1995 has been introduced -- for new lira 
exchange rates within the EMS [European Monetary System]. With 
fluctuation bands as broad as those currently permitted for all 
countries (15 percent either way), the decision should not 
impose impossible constraints and should at the same time enable 
Italy not to be excluded a priori from the EMU if it were to 
materialize in 1997. Indeed, according to the Maastricht 
Treaty, it will be necessary to observe the normal fluctuation 
bands during the previous two years, that is, 1995 and 1996.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Agnelli on Government Program, </F>
Confidence Vote"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 17 -- Fiat chairman and 
Senator-for-Life Gianni Agnelli today voiced a favorable opinion 
of the government's economic program and expressed his hope that 
the executive of Premier Silvio Berlusconi wins Wednesday's [18 
May] confidence vote in the Senate. 
  Speaking to the press following a luncheon of life senators, 
offered by Senate Speaker Carlo Scognamiglio, the Fiat chairman 
explained how the government economic program aimed at 
stimulating economic growth while, at the same time, limiting 
risks. The positive aspects of the program, outlined by 
Berlusconi to the Senate yesterday, included, Agnelli said: the 
commitment to curb public spending; boosting the economy through 
investments and greater flexibility on labor costs. 
  Turning his attention to tomorrow's confidence vote in the 
Senate, Agnelli said "I hope the government makes it" in reply 
to those who asked how he would vote. 
  Asked to comment on the positions of the other life 
Senators, 
the Fiat chairman said "I believe that each senator maintains 
his own opinion. On the other hand, life senators are 
individuals and each decides for himself". 
  The other life senators attending the luncheon were 
ex-president Francesco Cossiga, former Senate Speaker Giovanni 
Spadolini, Giulio Andreotti, Francesco De Martino and Paolo 
Emilio Taviani.

<F P=106> [Interview with Northern League Secretary Umberto Bossi by </F>
Giuseppe Sangiorgio; place and date not given: "League a 
Mountain, Miglio a Pebble; Bossi: If Professor Wants To Leave 
Us, He Is Free To Do So"] 
  [Text] Turin -- "Come, now. Let us not make too much of 
this Miglio business. I still do not know what is going on, I 
do not know what he wants to do. I heard that he is annoyed, 
that he is this, that he is that... Let him decide. If he 
wants to leave the League, he is free to do so." 
  [Sangiorgio] Mr. Bossi, the professor [Gianfranco Miglio] 
has 
announced that he will not vote for the government in the Senate 
because he was rejected as institutional reforms minister. And 
he says that you are the traitor. Does that charge not worry 
you, either? 
  [Bossi] Nonsense; I have not betrayed anyone. Miglio's is an 
idle argument, not a defense of federalism. And that says a 
great deal about his anger. [Prime Minister] Berlusconi and 
[National Alliance leader] Fini would never have granted him 
that ministry. That is the truth of the matter. 
  [Sangiorgio] What if the government were to fail to gain a 
vote of confidence, through Miglio's fault? 
  [Bossi] Come, now... Let us not exaggerate. We are short of 
a majority in the Senate, but I am sure the government will 
succeed nevertheless. Those people are not stupid. To hold 
another election could be dangerous to the stability of the 
country's democratic framework. People want governability. It 
would be a huge mistake to hold another election. Everyone 
knows that. You will see that when the time comes to vote in 
the Senate many representatives of the forces that are attacking 
us now will do the opposite of what they have said. 
  [Sangiorgio] So you think that, whatever happens, the 
government will win the confidence vote and the League will lose 
Miglio? 
  [Bossi] Well, personally, I will be sorry if Miglio leaves, 
but from the strategic and political viewpoint it changes 
nothing for the League. The League is a mountain, and if a rock 
breaks away nobody will notice. 
  [Sangiorgio] What about the friendship, affection, and 
gratitude that you owe Miglio? 
  [Bossi] Just a moment. I have already told you that I would 
be sorry from a personal viewpoint, and that is all. My 
relations with Gianfranco have always been clear and correct. 
We probably speak no more than once every two months... Yes, 
there is also some affection; I cannot deny it. I have always 
liked children and old people. 
  [Sangiorgio] Miglio has always claimed to be your teacher, 
to 
have instilled the idea of federalism in you. Have you already 
forgotten it all, Mr. Bossi? 
  [Bossi] What teacher? That really is not true. Miglio 
joined the League in 1990, when we were already very strong; we 
already had 15 regional council seats in Lombardy. 
  [Sangiorgio] Do you not think that you are being too harsh? 
  [Bossi] Look, if somebody makes all this trouble because he 
is not granted a ministry, he is making a big mistake. I 
telephoned him last week and found him very angry. And I can 
understand it. But in politics you cannot permit yourself to 
take things personally. No, you really cannot. I tried to 
recommend him for the post, but there was nothing to be done. 
  [Sangiorgio] But Miglio has apparently said that you 
promised 
him Institutional Reforms. 
  [Bossi] Nonsense. We of the League never promise anything, 
and none of us has ever said: I want this or that post. He was 
the only one to have done so; he asked Berlusconi or Fini, since 
he knows them. 
  [Sangiorgio] Then what happened? 
  [Bossi] Simple; they both deceived him. 
  [Sangiorgio] Why? 
  [Bossi] What do you mean, "why?" Miglio was an impossibility 
for that post. Consider Fini: Do you think that the leader of 
the National Alliance, which needs votes from the South, could 
want as minister someone who calls southerners "hicks." Fini 
and Berlusconi did not trust him, and now Miglio is making too 
much of the issue. He expected too much; Berlusconi probably 
made him all kinds of empty promises, and now he is venting his 
anger on me. 
  [Sangiorgio] Will you talk to him before the Senate vote? 
  [Bossi] I do not know, I do not know. Tabladini went to 
see him yesterday, and he told me that he is still angry. I 
think, I hope, that he is sufficiently mature to realize on his 
own where his contentiousness could lead. 
  [Sangiorgio] What if he persists? 
  [Bossi] Then there would be a problem with Miglio in the 
League. I really do not see how he could vote against this 
government. 
  [Sangiorgio] Be patient, Mr. Bossi. Is Mr. Miglio not one of 
the founding fathers of the League? 
  [Bossi] What do you mean by "founding fathers?" 
  [Sangiorgio] The ideologist, one of the linchpins of the 
movement, one of its members' reference points. 
  [Bossi] Look. He is someone with a special background; he is 
a teacher, and I have always given him a free rein. But he has 
never played the devil with me, and he must not start doing so 
now. I like him, but he must not confuse his battle for 
federalism with the battle over ministerial posts. I have 
certain very clear principles, and I hope that he will remember 
that he has them too. 
  [Sangiorgio] But do you think he is angry partly because you 
preferred Speroni to him? 
  [Bossi] I do not know. Speroni is an extremely efficient 
person, who used to travel around a great deal at a time when 
Miglio was a university teacher. And, as we know, teachers do 
not achieve much in politics... The federalist objective, which 
is my plan and the League's plan, does not change if that 
ministry is entrusted to one person rather than another. There 
will be a great deal of work to do, and Miglio's knowledge, 
expertise, and experience will certainly be useful too. I hope 
that he will be proud to cooperate, to help young Speroni. 
  [Sangiorgio] So, there is a dispute. Who is more stubborn? 
You or Miglio? 
  [Bossi] How should I know? I can talk to him as a friend, 
but I also have to think as secretary of the League. He counts 
for a great deal in the League; he is a likable old fellow. But 
in the League when someone starts talking about appointments, he 
becomes less likable. So, remember, my friend: The League is a 
mountain. The sound of a falling stone is virtually inaudible.

<F P=106> [Interview with Institutional Reforms Minister Francesco </F>
Speroni by Gianluigi Da Rold; place and date not given: 
"Speroni: He Is Wrong If He Thinks We Will Betray Federalism"] 
  [Text] Busto Arsizio (Varese) -- Institutional Reforms 
Minister Francesco Speroni said: "It is something I personally 
regret. [Northern League ideologue] Miglio's attitude has not 
changed. Perhaps for a while he may not be part of the Northern 
League's Senate group." Speroni, like other "veteran" League 
members, feels that something has changed. His relations with 
Miglio are based not only on allegiance to the same flag, but 
also on friendship and affection. 
  Friday evening [13 May] the new minister went to Como, to 
Miglio's home, accompanied by Senator Marcello Staglieno, 
Miglio's "disciple." They constituted a special League 
"delegation" sent to sound out Miglio's thinking and to try to 
mend a rift that has become apparent more from Miglio's pregnant 
silences than from his public statements. 
  [Da Rold] Do you think that Professor Miglio could vote 
against this government? 
  [Speroni] He could also abstain. I do not know exactly. My 
understanding is that Miglio's attitude is not due to his 
exclusion from the government. He seems to think that we have 
abandoned, relinquished federalism. But this is not true. And 
I am sorry that the professor could believe such a thing. He 
thinks that in the final stage of the negotiations we sacrificed 
federalism on the altar of governability and gained only a 
Pyrrhic victory. 
  [Da Rold] The other day you announced that you will be 
forming a committee, a study group, to examine a new draft 
constitution that will set out the path to a federal Italy. 
Will Professor Miglio contribute to this project? 
  [Speroni] I personally went to offer him this opportunity. 
But he seems to have no intention of taking part, of helping. 
And I regret this even more. [Speroni ends] 
  Speroni refused to discuss the matter further. He too is 
waiting for the news conference that Gianfranco Miglio will give 
in Rome on Tuesday after Silvio Berlusconi has presented his 
program to the Senate. Then the professor will speak in 
parliament. 
  [Da Rold] Pardon me, Minister, but the first incident seems 
to have taken place within the government already. Perhaps it 
is because the 13th fell on a Friday this month. You were 
criticized in a communique from Berlusconi's spokesman, Antonio 
Tajani, for having said in a radio interview that you want to 
split the Interior Ministry. 
  [Speroni] There was no incident. Perhaps I was 
misunderstood, or I did not express myself well. It was a radio 
interview conducted very hurriedly. But I was certainly 
misunderstood on the subject of collegiality; I spoke not 
personally but on behalf of the League. Nobody wants to split 
the Interior Ministry. We have already said that we want the 
establishment of a Ministry of Local Government, and we have 
seen, among other things, that a number of responsibilities are 
divided among several different ministries, not only the 
Interior Ministry. We have already talked about this. I did 
not take part in the government negotiations, which is why this 
morning I spoke with [League Secretary] Bossi and [Interior 
Minister] Maroni, who confirmed to me that the League is putting 
forward the proposal of a local government ministry. We will 
not do everything at once. We will propose the separation of 
responsibilities for the Interior Ministry in an ordinary law. 
  [Da Rold] Let us return to the subject of the committee, the 
study group: Who will it include? 
  [Speroni] I do not know yet. It will include experts, 
constitutionalists; I shall see. I have come to a ministry 
where there is nothing. Only typists and secretaries, and a 
constitutional adviser. There is not even a computer, and there 
is no money. This too shows how keen previous majorities were 
to carry out reforms. 
  [Da Rold] You will be guided by federalism. Will you also be 
guided by the so-called Assago constitution, which set out the 
republics, or cantons, or macro-regions? 
  [Speroni] Definitely by the Assago document, but also by the 
document drawn up by the Bicameral Committee. We are open to 
everyone. Personally, I identify more with the Assago document. 
  [Da Rold] How long will it take you to draw up a final 
draft? 
  [Speroni] If I have the means available and I make my staff 
work hard, I think we will have a draft in three months. 
  [Da Rold] Do you think you will encounter resistance from 
within the majority over the federalist inspiration of a new 
constitution? 
  [Speroni] I have listened to their arguments and have 
talked with many of our allies' representatives. If they are in 
good faith, I do not think there will be any resistance. 
  [Da Rold] Does the same apply to the National Alliance? Even 
allowing for what has been called the "counterbalance" of 
presidentialism? 
  [Speroni] That is a technical constitutional matter. It is 
enough to consider the experience of other countries. Is the 
United States not a federal and presidential republic? 
  [Da Rold] Then there is the idea of the macroregions. It 
will be more difficult to reach an agreement in this regard. 
  [Speroni] It seems to me to be the most sensible idea. I see 
that even the Agnelli Foundation is now thinking in terms of 
seven large regions. 
  [Da Rold] The left-wing federalist, Massimo Cacciari, 
however, has in mind a federalism based rather on the major 
cities, on Italy's big municipalities. 
  [Speroni] What, then, do you do about Gallarate? No, I think 
that the macroregions are the right approach, the best starting 
point. 
  [Da Rold] Do the reform plans include bodies of 
constitutional importance? What is your opinion concerning the 
Higher Magistrates Council? 
  [Speroni] I think it should be removed completely from 
political influence. I am talking about the members of the 
Council elected by parliament on the basis of political vested 
interests. Furthermore, I would rather await whatever 
suggestions emerge from the Justice Ministry. I have my own 
personal opinions in this regard. For instance, I would like 
district attorneys to be elected by the people, as in America. 
However, I repeat, these are my personal opinions.

<F P=106> [Report by Paola Di Caro: "The Red Intelligentsia Flunks </F>
Spaventa: Enough With Eternal Lent!"] 
  [Text] Milan -- It is not exactly a new idea. However, the 
man himself is certainly a new discovery as far as the Left is 
concerned: former Budget Minister Luigi Spaventa, Silvio 
Berlusconi's defeated challenger in Rome's leading constituency 
in the March election. The idea, which was launched by Venice 
progressive mayor -- philosopher and left-wing critic -- Massimo 
Cacciari, consists of organizing a shadow cabinet, to be headed, 
in fact, by Spaventa, a nonpartisan man with liberal democratic 
ideas. 
  An old structure, therefore, and a new man to revive an 
opposition which, according to Cacciari, must become an 
alternative force to the government as soon as possible. 
  An immediate "yes" -- also on behalf of the other 
progressive 
mayors -- came from Catania's leading citizen Enzo Bianco: 
"Spaventa suits me fine, and I also agree with the idea of an 
`opposition government' acting as an interface." The 
progressive intelligentsia, however, did not find the proposal 
all that appealing. Luciano Canfora said: "This is an attempt 
to find a shortcut, a mechanism to win. Setting up a government 
led by Spaventa -- whom I very much appreciate but who 
nevertheless lost the contest with Berlusconi -- means setting 
up a government which would be very similar to the right-wing 
government, albeit without all those nasty mugs around. What is 
the point of building such a Left?" 
  The same question was being asked by Pietro Barcellona, 
chairman of the Center for Research on the State: "Spaventa 
does not convince me in the least. I appreciate him, but I do 
not think we can convince the left-wing grassroots to keep Lent 
eternally." The example given was clear enough: "During the 
election campaign, the Left asked for continuous sacrifices, 
whereas Berlusconi was offering lottery tickets to his voters." 
In any case, "the first step is social opposition at grassroots 
level." Political expert and former Socialist European deputy 
Gianni Baget Bozzo agreed with this view: "For a shadow cabinet 
to work, real unity would be needed among the Left with a view 
to forming the government, but no such unity exists with 
Communist Renewal and Rete. Particularly if led by Spaventa -- 
who represents continuity with [Former Prime Minister] Ciampi -- 
a shadow cabinet would confirm the split within the Left by 
forcing it to confront the real issues faced by a government." 
This is why "the Left should remain an opposition force, in 
order to stay united." 
  "A shadow cabinet makes sense if it includes the whole 
opposition, otherwise it is weak," constitutional expert and 
former PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] deputy Augusto Barbera 
asserted. "It only makes sense if it includes the democratic 
Catholics. This is why we must wait for the PPI [Italian 
Popular Party] congress in July, in order to understand whether 
they want to conduct opposition based on party agreements, that 
is to say, with the aim of replacing the MSI [Italian Social 
Movement] in the government, or an alternative-type of 
opposition, joining forces with the Left." However, a shadow 
cabinet with the PPI would mean losing "two of the First 
Republic's myths, namely the Left's unity, and the Catholics' 
political unity," because Communist Renewal would be lost on the 
way, and the PPI would certainly split. Who could lead the 
shadow cabinet? "Spaventa might do," Barbera said, "but then, 
in such a context, so could Prodi [chairman of the Institute for 
Industrial Reconstruction]." 
  "Prodi? An interesting name, as indeed is Spaventa's," 
Social Christian leader Ermanno Gorrieri said. However, he 
appeared to entertain some doubts: "I am not entirely convinced 
by the idea of a shadow cabinet. In short, the search for unity 
must be based on a common ethos, and this requires time. 
Besides, will Communist Renewal be included or not?" He also 
had doubts about making overtures to the PPI: "It must be done, 
but I wonder whether a shadow cabinet would be the ideal means 
of doing so. Putting pressure on the PPI by calling for a 
united front may have the effect of pushing the PPI further away 
from us." 
  A flat "no" came from former PCI [Italian Communist Party] 
exponent Napoleone Colajanni: "The Left's crisis cannot be 
solved by means of shadow cabinets, even more so considering 
that, according to Cacciari, such a government would have to be 
led by Spaventa because the latter challenged Berlusconi. Well, 
seeing the result of the contest, it seems a rather ill-omened 
choice to me."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Forza Italia Popularity Up, Directa </F>
Poll Says"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Milan, May 13 -- Forza Italia has increased 
its popularity with voters by 4.6 points since the March general 
elections, according to the Directa polling institute today, 
saying that 25.6 percent of those questioned judged the party of 
Premier Silvio Berlusconi favorably. 
  The Milan polling institute said that from now on it would 
sound out the voting propensities of Italians on a weekly basis 
right up to the European elections in June. 
  The latest poll was taken at the request of Telemontecarlo 
which commented on the results this evening. The full results 
of the survey will be published tomorrow. 
  In telephone interviews, Directa questioned 1,020 people 
from 
96 cities and towns over a three-day period (May 9-10-11). The 
sample was said to be representative in terms of age, sex and 
socio- economic class. 
  Forza Italia was found to be the only political group to 
show 
any significant rise in popularity since the March 27-28 
elections. 
  Directa said that 13.3 percent of the sample did not reply 
when asked who they would vote for in the June 12 elections for 
the European Parliament. 
  Below is a table showing the percentage of party preferences 
voiced for the coming European elections and the percentage each 
party gleaned in the last general elections in March:

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Trieste Citizens Want Border </F>
Treaties Unchanged"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 17 -- Citizens in Trieste, the 
Italian city near the frontier with Slovenia, believe that any 
renegotiation of the border treaty with that country would be 
"impractical," according to a poll carried out by the SWG 
[Integrated Research Services] agency. 
  Raising the issue of alterations to the Osimo treaty, which 
in 1975 put an end to border haggling between Italy and 
Yugoslavia, would be "impractical" according to 65.7 percent of 
Trieste citizens polled by SWG. 
  Italians from other areas were not so sure, however, with 
just 44.6 percent of those questioned agreeing with Trieste. 
Over 56 percent of ethnic Italians living across the Slovene 
border were against any changes. 
  Asked whether discussing changes to the treaty was 
"desirable", negative answers came from 55.4 percent of Trieste 
citizens, 42 percent of Italians, and 34.1 percent of Italians 
in the Istrian peninsula. 
  Should the treaty come up for debate, as some areas in the 
National Alliance, part of the governing coalition, have 
suggested, 34.1 percent of Italians across the border would like 
to see greater safeguards for the Italian minority there 
introduced, while just 7.6 percent said that the border itself 
should be changed. 
  Of those questioned in the former Yugoslavia, 39.8 percent 
said that the best solution for the Italian minority there would 
be "full administrative autonomy within Slovenia and Croatia". 
  Seven hundred Italians and 250 people in Istria were 
questioned for the poll.

<F P=106> [Report by Antonietta Calabro: "Berlusconi Gets To Grips </F>
With Secret Services"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Intelligence service heads are 
getting nervous about what decisions [Prime Minister] Berlusconi 
will make. Parliamentary sources say that there will be 
changes, either at the level of the secretary general of Cesis 
[Executive Committee for the Intelligence and Security Services] 
(a post currently held by General Giuseppe Tavormina, very close 
to Andrea Manezella, the former secretary general of the Palazzo 
Chigi [office of the prime minister] during the Ciampi era and a 
Democratic Party of the Left [PDS] candidate for the European 
elections), or at the head of Sismi [Intelligence and Military 
Security Service] (a post occupied by Cesare Pucci), or at the 
head of Sisde [Intelligence and Democratic Security Service] 
currently run by Domenico Salazar. The favorites to take over 
at Sismi are General Carlo Jean (already the military attache 
under former President Francesco Cossiga) and Franco Angioni 
(former commander of the Lebanon mission). Where the military 
secret services are concerned, however, a candidate from within 
could also have a very good chance. 
  Possible successors at Sisde (routed by scandal and 
developments in the inquest into the fake bomb "discovered" on a 
train) are Milanese police chief Achille Serra, a Northern 
League favorite, and the current District Attorney of Florence, 
Pierluigi Vigna. Vigna could also be the right man for Cesis, 
where he would be in the running with General Pietro Sotgiu 
(from the drugs squad) and General Domenico Pisani, commander of 
Rome's Second Carabinieri Division. However, while there will 
be some rotation of staff, informed sources say that the changes 
will not be immediate. One of the reasons for this is the 
extremely important G-7 summit in Naples from 6 to 8 July which 
will involve the security organizations to a maximum and which 
suggests it would be ill-advised to make any changes at the head 
of the intelligence services for the time being. Other sources 
say, on the contrary, that for this very reason the government 
wants to make sure immediately that the services are headed by 
totally faithful people. 
  The plans that Berlusconi's government has for these 
departments do not stop there. Admiral Fulvio Martini's plan 
for reform is picking up speed again and has also received the 
approval of Ugo Pecchioli, chairman of the Parliamentary 
Oversight Committee. In practice, this plan would create a 
single service of around 6,000 to 7,000 men at the direct 
disposal of the prime minister via an ad hoc undersecretary of 
state and which would take on the role of a national security 
authority. As a result, the prime minister could go over the 
head of the interior and defense ministers. The secret service, 
which in this plan would be a strictly professional force, would 
be split into six departments, one of which would be charged 
with tackling organized crime. To counterbalance the resulting 
centralization, the powers of the parliamentary committee would 
be increased, especially for budget control and for timely 
information on the operations carried out.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Fiori Will Pass Judgment on </F>
Alitalia Plan Within Days"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 17 -- The new transport minister, 
Publio Fiori, today promised to pass judgment within four or 
five days on the restructurization plan drafted for Alitalia by 
the management team led by managing director Roberto Schisano, 
who moved to the loss-making Italian flagcarrier airline three 
months ago from Texas Instruments. 
  Ahead of a meeting with Alitalia senior executives scheduled 
for Thursday [19 May], Fiori cautioned, "The government does not 
intend to throw more money into the well of public companies." 
"If the plan is credible and is aimed at revival and the 
recovery of quality and rests not only on job cuts, 
recapitalization -- with interventions which can be diverse and 
provide also for a bond issue -- will be no problem and it will 
be possible to bring in private investors as well," added the 
minister. 
  Speaking at the end of a meeting with union representatives, 
Fiori said the policy of the new government will be to "reduce 
state financial interventions to a minimum. If there is a 
public company in crisis, it is more correct to go to the 
market, with a bond issue guaranteed by the state, for example, 
if the European Commission allows it." 
  The minister said he was confident of an EU [European Union] 
go-ahead "if the plan is credible and the unions allow it. In 
parallel, this will make Alitalia shares more tasty and there 
can be thinking on the entry of private capital in the company," 
he added with reference to the airline controlled by the 
Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale [Institute for 
Industrial Reconstruction] public holding company. 
  Fiori's comments came one day after unidentified ministry 
sources talked of a bond issue and opening Alitalia's doors to 
private investors to generate the 1.5 trillion lire (932 million 
dollars) needed to carry out the recovery plan. 
  On ways and means to cut up to 4,000 jobs, for the purpose 
of 
reducing operating costs by 12 percent, Fiori today said the 
early retirement scheme could be extended beyond the 800 flight 
personnel but that the government will attempt to assure that 
"no pockets of unemployment" are created. "A system of social 
shock absorbers will have to be found and problems of management 
and fares will have to be looked at," he added. 
  After saying that for any privatization plan, he "favors a 
golden share maintained by the state," the minister voiced his 
confidence in the airline's management. "I have no doubts about 
their capabilities; I just have the duty to verify." 
  Fiori said he will meet the union side again after he has 
given the restructurization plan further study. 
  Last week, Alitalia reported first-quarter losses of 190 
billion lire, compared to loss for all of 1993 of 345.6 billion 
lire (215 million dollars) and 16.8 billion in the red for 1992. 
Total losses as of the end of the first quarter this year 
accounted for more than one-third of Alitalia capital. 
  Aside from job cuts, according to the Alitalia board, the 
main points of the new restructurization plan are aimed at 
improving service, overhauling the entire network of regional 
connections and schedules, looking north and turning the Milan 
airport into a major hub for European flights, management 
reshuffles at the group's subsidiaries, cost cuts and new rules 
for flight crews. 
  The board attributed the poor results of 1993 to a 
four-year-long global slump in the airline industry and to fare 
wars for intercontinental routes. Operating losses amounted to 
80 billion lire (50.3 million dollars) last year compared to 
profits of 155 billion lire in 1992. 
  Union representatives, speaking for the CGIL's [Italian 
General Confederation of Labor] FILT [Italian Federation of 
Transportation Workers], FIT [Italian Transportation Federation] 
of the CISL [Italian Confederation of Trade Unions] and the UIL 
[Italian Federation of Trade Unions] transport union, were 
generally non-committal at the end of their talk with the 
minister but said Fiori promised to roll back United Airlines' 
management of their own ground services at Rome's International 
Leonardo Da Vinci Airport. 
  "Fiori took on the commitment to examine a legislative way 
which takes account of job guarantees," said Sandro Degni of the 
UIL with reference to union worries about job losses which could 
result if the recent agreement between United Airlines and the 
Aeroporti di Roma, which runs the Rome airports, is expanded to 
bring in other carriers. 
  Paolo Brutti of the FILT said the government's opinion of 
the 
Alitalia restructurization plan is "fundamental. Ownership has 
to bet on the future of the company, otherwise, it will be 
difficult for the workers to do so. Then if fresh capital 
arrives from sell- offs and bond issues, this does not interest 
us." 
  The FIT's Salvatore Frisella said recapitalization is a 
"duty 
within the civil code, if for no other reason." On trimming 
jobs, this union official said his side would be willing to 
discuss non- productive areas but "is not in agreement with cuts 
deriving from the curtailment of services." 
  Silvano Barberini of the FIT, said that according to rumors 
ahead of the resignation tomorrow of the Aeroporti di Roma 
board, the new managing director could come from Texas 
Instruments, the company whose European operations were led by 
Schisano, and that Schisano may take over the chair. 
  Named as a likely deputy chairman is Renato Cassaro, the 
present managing director of Fintecna, the IRI company which 
holds 40 percent of Aeroporti. The union official said these 
changes at the top, in line with the recent shake-up in the 
senior management of Alitalia, show that Aeroporti di Roma will 
not be put up for sale "but revived. And on this, the unions 
can only be in agreement."

<F P=106> [Article signed NN/AB: "The Chairman of the Council of </F>
States at UN Headquarters in New York -- Blue Helmets and 
Election Monitoring Missions on Agenda of Talks"] 
  [Text] New York, 17 May (ATS) -- Chairman of the Swiss 
Council of States Riccardo Jagmetti met with several 
high-ranking UN officials in New York on Monday [16 May] and 
Tuesday. This visit provided the opportunity to assess the 
current state of relations between Switzerland and the United 
Nations. The creation of a contingent of Swiss blue helmets was 
a main point on the agenda of the talks. 
  Mr. Jagmetti told the press that he had been "impressed by 
the prestige that Switzerland enjoys at the United Nations." 
His guests highlighted the quality of Switzerland's performance 
in the different UN missions, mainly in Namibia, Western Sahara, 
and South Africa. In this respect, the officials in charge of 
UN election operations would appreciate an increased commitment 
by Switzerland during election monitoring missions principally 
during the preparation phase, Mr. Jagmetti said. 
  Marrack Goulding, deputy UN general secretary for political 
affairs, showed a marked interest in the possible creation of a 
contingent of Swiss blue helmets. The participation of 
militiamen [miliciens] in peacekeeping operations would be most 
welcome at a time when the United Nations lacks specialists 
active in civilian life. Finally, the conditions set by 
Switzerland, as a result of its neutrality status, are fully 
accepted by the United Nations, Mr. Jagmetti added. 
  The upper house chairman underlined the importance of the 
role played by members of Parliament in the relations between 
the different states and the United Nations. He said that their 
involvement in UN affairs is essential for forming public 
opinion. Parliament must pass the information from the United 
Nations to the citizens.

<F P=106> [Interview with Flavio Cotti, head of the Chief Department </F>
of Foreign Affairs, and Kaspar Villiger, head of the Chief 
Department of Military, by Thomas Haeberling and Bruno Lezzi; 
place and date not given: "`Blue Helmets Strengthen Foreign 
Policy Qualities of Neutrality'"] 
  [Excerpt] On 12 June, the Swiss will decide in a 
referendum on the bill on blue helmet missions. In an interview 
with NEUE ZUERCHER ZEITUNG, Defense Minister Villiger and 
Foreign Minister Cotti explain why, for reasons of security and 
foreign policy, the federal law on the participation of Swiss 
Forces in peacekeeping operations deserves to be supported. The 
interview with the two ministers was conducted by Thomas 
Haeberling and Bruno Lezzi. 
  [NEUE ZUERCHER ZEITUNG] Why should Switzerland participate 
with troops in UN and later maybe even CSCE peacekeeping 
operations? 
  [Villiger] Blue helmets do not wage war but give peace a 
chance wherever arms remain silent, where there is a truce, or 
where a conflict has not yet erupted. UN peacekeeping forces 
have been a tried and tested instrument to fulfill this task for 
30 years. This is also absolutely clearly in the interest of 
our country. I am thinking, for example, of the preventive 
stationing of troops in Macedonia; after all, if a conflict were 
to break out there, we would be bound to receive large numbers 
of refugees. Tasks of security policy, which directly benefit 
also Switzerland, cannot generally be left to others in the long 
run, particularly since I am convinced that small neutral 
countries are destined for credible mediating functions. 
  [NEUE ZUERCHER ZEITUNG] Mr. Cotti, how do you see this 
issue? 
  [Cotti] From the foreign policy point of view I can only 
support what Mr. Villiger said. Blue helmets are a new form of 
good services, which has become even more topical over the past 
few years -- quite certainly also in connection with the fall of 
communism, which I would like to describe as something like a 
geological stratum. This geological stratum suppressed latent 
conflicts in many parts of the world; they could not erupt. The 
danger of a worldwide nuclear conflict has certainly diminished, 
but there are many more very cruel local conflicts. This is why 
demand for these services has increased. 
  [NEUE ZUERCHER ZEITUNG] The opponents to this bill sometimes 
claim that in many cases blue helmets are useless. Let us take 
Somalia or the former Yugoslavia as examples. It has been 
claimed that the blue helmets have even created additional 
problems. What is your reaction to that? 
  [Villiger] This is simply not consistent with the facts. It 
is obvious that not every UN action has been successful. 
Failures aside, there is an impressive series of successes. 
The arguments brought forth by the opponents are biased because 
they always mention those countries where something is going 
wrong at the moment, whereas they fail to talk of those actions 
of obvious benefit. Moreover, blue helmets do very useful work 
in the humanitarian sphere, save lives, and secure the supply of 
vital goods. Of the current 17 UN missions, only three are 
taking place in combat areas. It is symptomatic that successful 
blue helmet missions do not make headlines or get any television 
coverage because they do not offer any reports that are out of 
the ordinary. 
  [NEUE ZUERCHER ZEITUNG] Mr. Cotti, one subject that always 
gives rise to debate is our neutrality. Will Swiss blue helmets 
threaten our foreign policy maxim or, put differently, will 
neutrality be undermined through Swiss participation in blue 
helmet operations, and might not its function as a security 
strategy be lost in the event of a change of the strategic 
situation? 
  [Cotti] Not only are blue helmets compatible with 
neutrality, but in a new overall political environment, 
neutrality even demands a service such as the blue helmets. 
That it is compatible with neutrality is more than obvious. 
Mr. Villiger has said that before. Swiss blue helmets would 
only be sent to places with the agreement of all parties to the 
conflict who would have to ask for our presence. We would never 
go anywhere against the will of any party. The condition of 
nonpartisanship has to be fulfilled. Mr. Villiger quite rightly 
said that no country can more rightfully be regarded as 
nonpartisan than a neutral one. We have rendered good services 
in many instances: with UN observers, election observers, and 
with functions such as those being looked after by Colonel 
Arbenz or Ambassador Brunner. Against the background of the 
great demand for peacekeeping missions, blue helmets are nothing 
but the normal, updated implementation of our policy of 
neutrality. 
  [NEUE ZUERCHER ZEITUNG] Does this apply to the sphere of 
security policy, too? 
  [Villiger] I would like to clearly emphasize what Mr. Cotti 
said. History proves the importance of this view. Up to 1990, 
it was neutral countries that bore the main burden of blue 
helmet missions: Sweden, Finland, Austria. And in those 30 
years nobody even had the faintest doubts about the neutrality 
of these three countries. This allows us to conclude that blue 
helmet operations strengthen the foreign policy qualities of 
neutrality. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article signed EE/SV/AL: "End of Jean-Pascal Delamuraz' </F>
Visit to Russia -- Reinforced Trust Between Both Countries"] 
  [Text] Moscow, 13 May (ATS) -- Federal Counselor Pascal 
Delamuraz has returned from a two-day trip to Moscow. At a news 
conference at the Swiss Embassy in Moscow, he highlighted the 
"particular openness" of his talks with Russian officials. The 
main purpose of this first official visit to Russia was the 
signing of a trade and economic cooperation agreement on 
Thursday [12 May] by the head of the Federal Department of 
Public Economy [DFEP] and Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin. 
  Mr. Delamuraz stressed that his visit has contributed to 
reinforcing the trust between potential investors and between 
the two countries. The DFEP head also insisted on the "human" 
value of the trade and economic cooperation agreement that was 
signed last Thursday. This accord is intended to replace three 
bilateral agreements that were concluded with the former Soviet 
Union, as well as the 1979 program for economic, industrial, 
scientific, and technical cooperation. 
<H5>  Arduous Privatization </H5>
  On Friday morning, the federal counselor met with Mr. 
Anatoliy Chubays, Russian deputy prime minister in charge of 
privatizations. They discussed the issue of privatization. 
"This is a sensitive topic. Calling for privatization is not 
enough. Russia is a state which is experiencing rapid change, 
where the structure of law, the consistency and prevalence of 
specific rules are hardly established," Mr. Delamuraz said. 
  The Russian Government assured the federal counselor that 
access to foreign assets would not be limited and that there 
would not be any discrimination. "Many fields of activity are 
open, except that of rail transport," Mr. Delamuraz added. 
  As far as Russia's debts to 83 Swiss companies, amounting to 
320 million Swiss francs [SFr], are concerned, the DFEP head 
said that the Russian prime minister had confirmed that a 
solution would be found by summer. 
<H5>  Exports on the Rise </H5>
  The visit by Mr. Delamuraz comes at a time when Swiss 
exports 
to Russia have increased considerably. Totaling SFr327 million 
last year, exports mainly comprise machines, chemicals, food, 
and watches. Imports (SFr376 million in 1993) chiefly are fuels 
and metals.

  [Excerpt] Bonn/Ankara (DPA) -- According to eyewitness 
reports, Turkish and Iranian troops have intervened in the 
internal Kurdish conflict in northeastern Iraq. In the 
Sulaimaniya area, thousands are fleeing from the fighting, 
Eberhard Walde, chief of the German Liaison Bureau in the 
region, told DPA in Bonn in a telephone interview on 19 May. 
  He said that while Iranian artillery attacked Kurdish 
settlements from the east, Turkish aircraft dropped bombs from 
the north, which has led to another stream of civilian refugees. 
Meanwhile, the autonomous Kurdish region in Iraq has virtually 
been shared between the two rival parties, the Patriotic Union 
of Kurdistan and the Democratic Party of Kurdistan, which are 
continuing their armed conflicts, Walde said. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Sofia, May 18 (BTA) -- A Bulgarian delegation, led 
by Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov, which arrived on an 
official visit to Turkey on May 16, met with representatives of 
the Turkish business community in Istanbul today, Bulgarian 
national radio special correspondent Apostol Saruivanov 
reported. At the meeting, Mr. Farzat Kucani, chairman of the 
Council for External Economic Relations, set forth the Turkish 
businessmen's views of the state of trade and economic contacts 
between Bulgaria and Turkey, as well as of the opportunities for 
their expansion. Bilateral trade, which has been around 300 
million U.S. dollars in the last few years, is seen as too low 
for the considerably larger potential of the two neighbouring 
countries, the sides agreed. Mr. Kucani discussed the prospects 
for cooperation which requires assistance and decisions of the 
government authorities. He said that Turkish companies are 
ready to share in the modernization of the Port of Burgas (on 
the Black Sea), of tourist facilities in the area of Burgas, and 
in the construction and implementation of other projects in 
Bulgaria. 
  For his part, Mr. Daskalov pointed out that common 
understanding had been reached at the talks in Ankara to draft 
agreements on the avoidance of double taxation and on reciprocal 
investment protection and promotion. These agreements are 
expected to be signed during the visit of Bulgarian President 
Zhelyu Zhelev to Turkey. 
  Mr. Daskalov visited Turkey to arrange the forthcoming visit 
of President Zhelev to Ankara and a visit to Bulgaria by Turkish 
Prime Minister Tansu Ciller. During his stay, the chief 
Bulgarian diplomat met with his Turkish counterpart Hikmet Cetin 
and with the President of Turkish Grand National Assembly 
Husamettin Cindoruk. Yesterday Mr. Daskalov was received by the 
president of Turkey Suleyman Demirel. The two countries' 
foreign ministers yesterday signed a protocol on expansion of 
bilateral cooperation. Bulgarian Foreign Ministry spokesman 
Radko Vlaykov said at a news briefing today that this is an 
important document as it specifies areas of future cooperation 
between Bulgaria and Turkey. From Istanbul, Mr. Daskalov is 
scheduled to leave on a working visit to London.

  [Text] Vienna, May 20 (AFP) -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) Friday [20 May] rejected a North Korean 
proposal to keep fuel rods from a controversial nuclear reactor 
in a "safe place under seal" ahead of resumed talks on the 
issue, an IAEA spokesman said. 
  "That won't work. We will no longer be able to verify with 
certainty if any of the nuclear material has been diverted," 
from the Yongbyon experimental reactor, he said. 
  The North Korean ambassador to China, Chu Chang-Jun, told a 
Beijing press conference Friday North Korea would keep "the fuel 
rods in a safe place, under seal in order that the inspectors 
can verify that nuclear material has not been diverted to 
non-peaceful ends. 
  "When the next round of discussions takes place between 
North 
Korea and the United States and a technical solution is found, 
then the agency will be able to take its samples," the 
ambassador said. 
  The IAEA said late Thursday that North Korea has begun 
extracting fuel rods from its five-megawatt Yongbyon reactor in 
a "serious violation" of IAEA inspection terms and said it would 
inform the UN Security Council. 
  The removal of the rods, if not halted immediately, could 
wreck the IAEA's attempts to see if fuel had already been 
diverted, the IAEA said. 
  The agency called on North Korea to allow immediate 
inspections and to delay the extraction of fuel rods until 
arrangements were in place. 
  "No North Korean response to our demands has reached us," 
the 
IAEA said. 
  The three agency inspectors in North Korea are attempting to 
check whether any of the 8,000 nuclear fuel rods in the reactor 
have been diverted and used to nuclear weapons. 
  The IAEA said it would still be possible to carry out 
inspections and offered to send its top officials to discuss how 
it could be done.

<F P=106> [Report signed "b.b.": "Hope for Karabakh"] </F>
  [Text] Vienna -- Since the cease-fire agreed upon by the 
warring parties in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict on 11 May has 
been holding, CSCE is now making increasing efforts to 
consolidate this truce. If the three conflicting parties 
(Azerbaijan, Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh) sign a relevant 
agreement in Vienna, CSCE will send 34 observers to Karabakh 
within three days (10 of whom would be mine clearing experts), 
the CSCE's Karabakh rapporteur, Ambassador Jan Eliasson, told 
correspondents on Thursday [19 May]. 
  Within another two weeks, this CSCE team would be increased 
to 66. Twelve CSCE states are prepared to provide military 
personnel for the Karabakh mission. Eliasson stressed that this 
mission will be a first step toward a peace process. 
  He said that the Armenian and Azerbaijani presidents, 
Ter-Petrosyan and Aliyev, have pointed out to him that this is 
an "historic chance" to end this "war that has been forgotten by 
the world" (Eliasson). So far, cease-fires in the Karabakh 
conflict have always been broken shortly after they were signed.

securing the cease-fire, Eliasson said.

  [Text] Copenhagen, May 20 (AFP) -- Bulgarian Foreign 
Minister Stanislav Daskalov called Friday [20 May] for a 
resolution of the Greek-Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic 
of Macedonia -- FYROM] conflict and said that Greek sanctions 
against its neighbour could affect the region's stability. 
  "This situation is very regrettable because these sanctions 
are also affecting Bulgaria," Daskalov said during a one-day 
official visit here. "This conflict must be resolved on the 
negotiating table rather than through an embargo." 
  Greece has refused landlocked Macedonia access to its 
northern port of Salonika since mid-February in a dispute over 
names. 
  Athens accuses Skopje of having designs on the northern 
Greek 
province of Macedonia and of usurping Greek symbols on its flag. 
  Daskalov on Friday also said that his country was paying a 
heavy price as a result of the UN trade embargo against the 
rump-Yugoslavia -- Serbia and Montenegro -- for the Serbs' role 
in the wars in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia.

  [Text] Brussels, May 19 (AFP) -- A plan to restructure the 
European steel industry by reducing capacity and shedding 50,000 
jobs has collapsed because of disputes over subsidies for 
Italian plants. 
  The plan by the Commission of the European Union [EU] was 
well and truly dead because it had proved impossible to reach a 
minimum figure for the reduction of productive capacity, 
Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert said here Thursday [19 
May]. 
  It would be impossible to achieve cuts of 19 million tonnes 
per year in the capacity to produce rolled steels. 
  State-owned and private firms had promised to close 
factories 
with capacity amounting to 11 million tonnes, he said. 
  The plan had been launched by industry ministers from the 12 
EU countries in February 1993 to put the industry, which has 
been hard hit by a fall of prices, on a competitive footing. It 
would also have led to the loss of at least 50,000 jobs. 
  Van Miert and Commissioner Martin Bangemann, who is 
responsible for industry, were obstructed by the problem of the 
Bresciani, the small Italian steel manufacturers in the region 
of Brescia in northern Italy. 
  They had agreed to remove capacity to produce five million 
to 
six million tonnes on condition that they could receive aid of 
415 million ECUs (477 million dollars) from the Italian state. 
But all such aid must be approved by the commission. 
  Van Miert had asked the rest of the commission to accept 
what 
was termed a "flexible interpretation" of EU regulations 
concerning state aid so that capacity could be cut quickly 
towards the figure of 19 million tonnes. 
  But a majority of the commission rejected this. 
  The decision that the plan is now dead throws into question 
social, financial and commercial measures which were to have 
been part of the scheme. They were intended to protect 
companies while they restructured. 
  Funds would have been available for the re-training of 
workers who lost their jobs, and imports of steel from central 
and east Europe, and particularly from the Czech Republic, would 
have been restricted temporarily. 
  Van Miert said that these measures were no longer justified. 
  The commission had also authorised industrialists to 
establish financial arrangements to help each other. This was 
never used. 
  Ministers from EU countries are to study the situation at a 
special meeting in June. 
  The 12 EU countries approved plans for reductions of 
capacity 
by six subsidised companies, among them Ilva of Italy, SCI of 
Spain and EKO-Stahl of Germany, on December 18, 1993, after many 
difficulties. 
  But private or non-subsidised producers held that the 
agreement was unbalanced since it approved public subsidies 
totalling 6.7 billion ECUs in respect of cuts in production 
capacity of 5.5 million tonnes. 
  These unsubsidised producers have since shown reluctance to 
close plants, fearing that in so doing they would hand market 
share to their competitors.

<F P=106> [Report signed "cs": "Euphoria Over Membership in the </F>
European Union Has Subsided"] 
  [Text] Linz -- A majority of Austrians continues to endorse 
Austrian membership in the European Union [EU], but the number 
of supporters has clearly declined since the beginning of April, 
and the opponents have won ground again. This is revealed by the 
most recent Market opinion poll. 
  A total of 46 percent are currently in favor of entry into 
the EU, and 36 percent are against it. When those who are 
undecided or who have not made up their minds were asked whether 
they would rather vote for or against EU membership, it is clear 
that three out of four who are undecided would rather vote in 
favor of entry into the EU. In fact, the April poll revealed a 
larger number of EU supporters, but those who were undecided 
were more inclined to vote against the EU. 
  Thus, Market head Werner Beutelmeyer draws the conclusion 
that the euphoria that prevailed after the announcement of the 
results of the Brussels negotiations has subsided. "Yet the 
mood continues to be good, even though the outcome of the 
referendum is by no means certain," the pollster stated. 
  The result among supporters of the Freedom Party of Austria 
has changed considerably. A total of 46 percent rejects EU 
membership for the first time; 31 percent support Austria's 
entry into the EU.

situation in Rwanda is so bad that, for the time being, the 
Netherlands is not to provide troops for a UN peacekeeping 
force. Apparently, the gruesome murder of 10 Belgian blue 
helmets in Rwanda last month was an important factor in the 
Dutch Cabinet's decision. Rwanda used to be a Belgian colony 
and the Dutch ministers fear that Dutch soldiers could be 
mistaken for Belgians.

<F P=106> [Article by Pierre Petit: Defense Wrestles With Half a </F>
Billion Deficit"] 
  [Text] The Defense Ministry is facing a budget deficit of 
500 million guilders. Top military officials fear that, partly 
as a result of new cutbacks, the restructuring of the armed 
forces will be jeopardized. 
  UN operations are costing much more than estimated, the sale 
of redundant army equipment has proved disappointing, and the 
Defense Ministry is no longer benefiting from index-linking. 
This year, the department has to save 241 million guilders. 
Over the last four years, a total of 8 billion guilders has 
been saved. 
  Further considerable defense savings are expected next year, 
as Minister Ter Beek constantly repeats that "the savings from 
the peace have been exhausted." The CEC [Central Economic 
Commission] has suggested a cutback of 500 million guilders in a 
confidential report submitted to those responsible for 
conducting government negotiations. 
  In order to reduce the deficits to some extent, the Army has 
already cut back drastically on military exercises. Fewer 
people are also being called up for national service. 
  Ter Beek has also submitted a claim of 150 million guilders 
to the government to fund peacekeeping operations. He wants 
other ministries to help pay the bill. The costs of such 
operations are estimated to already amount to 350 million 
guilders, but are likely to increase further. The government 
had allocated 125 million guilders to peacekeeping operations. 
  In addition to savings on military exercises, the Defense 
Ministry also wants savings on equipment purchases. Secretary 
of State Frinking welcomed the purchase of 33 combat helicopters 
rather than 40 for the light mobile brigade, the showpiece of 
the new, modern Army. Other, smaller projects have also been 
downgraded. 
  Ter Beek, who is considered unlikely to be included in a 
future government, cannot count on his own party. The PvdA 
[Labor Party] believes it can save at least another 900 million 
guilders over the next four years in his department. 
  Although defense is not yet a "hot item" in current 
negotiations with the party leaders on a possible "purple" 
coalition [comprising the PvdA, the D66 (Democrats 66), and the 
VVD (People's Party for Freedom and Democracy)], specialists are 
still concerned about prospects of arriving at a joint defense 
program. 
  The D66 and the VVD do not want any further defense cuts. 
Calculations by the CPB [Central Plan Bureau] based on the party 
programs show, however, that the D66, like the CDA [Christian 
Democratic Appeal], will seek to achieve savings of 600 million 
guilders, the VVD 300 million and the PvdA as much as 1.4 
billion. 
  In VVD circles in particular, questions are being raised as 
to whether these enormous differences will be bridged. Minister 
Ter Beek himself believes that although it is not easy, it is 
"solvable."

  [Text] The tanaiste [Deputy Prime Minister Dick Spring] 
said this morning the British reply to Sinn Fein's demands for 
clarification of the Downing Street declaration ought to remove 
the last barrier to ending the violence. He told a conference 
in Tralee that the British Government had once again repeated 
what most already knew -- that the future of the Irish people 
was in the hands of the Irish people. Mr. Spring said it would 
be a future won by negotiation, agreement, and consent. It 
would not rely on coercion and terror. He said everything would 
be on the table. 
  The tanaiste described the violence of the past 25 years as 
cruel and unjust. He said it had robbed the country of a 
significant part of its potential. He said peace would be the 
foundation for a dramatic surge in opportunities for investment 
and in development support from the European Union.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Sinn Fein leader Martin McGuiness </F>
by unidentified correspondent on 20 May; place not specified -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] As you may have heard on "Morning 
Ireland" this morning, the chairman of Sinn Fein in the north, 
Mitchell McLaughlin, said that measurable progress was made with 
the British Government's commentary on his party's questions 
about the Downing Street Declaration. Mr. McLaughlin told RTE 
that Sinn Fein was committed to working its way round the 
clarification roadblock, and he was hoping that the answers they 
had got would succeed in that purpose. But he said the 
conditions required to render the IRA campaign redundant were 
still some way off. While our bulletin was on air, I spoke to 
the Sinn Fein leader Martin McGuinness about his response to the 
British Government's commentary. 
  [McGuinness] We believe that the peace process, necessarily 
by the nature of the thing, will be a series of small steps, and 
we believe that is far more important than grand unilateral 
gestures. We believe that small steps are actually the [word 
indistinct] substance of a developing peace process, and we will 
have to look at what the British Government has said in that 
context. I have been saying, as you're aware, for some time 
that what Republicans were looking for was a level playing 
pitch. And we will look at what the British Government has said 
in these answers and see whether or not this actually provides a 
level playing pitch. 
  [Correspondent] Well, what would you single out as advances 
in the commentary? 
  [McGuinness] Well, I wouldn't be prepared to single anything 
out at this stage, it's much too early. Sinn Fein personnel 
individually will be examining what the British Government has 
said in their reply and they will then by the nature of our 
organization [words indistinct] collective thinking on this, and 
we will then arrive at a position -- hopefully, shortly.... 
  [Correspondent, interrupting] Mitchell McLaughlin said this 
morning that measurable progress was made with this British 
Government commentary. He said that the British had recognized 
that Sinn Fein had serious and legitimate questions to ask, and 
I believe he referred to the fact that your electoral mandate 
was recognized. 
  [McGuinness] Yes. Well, I mean obviously this is very 
important from our point of view and we will look at all that 
the British Government said in their reply in the context of the 
questions which we put to the British Government, which were 
very detailed questions, which go to the heart of what we 
believe to be the problem here in the (?six counties). And 
obviously we are going to have give that [word indistinct] 
consideration and that isn't something that can be done in hours 
or days; it's going to take some time. But it will be done as 
expeditiously as we possibly can do. 
  [Correspondent] But the taoiseach [Irish Prime Minister 
Albert Reynolds] has already questioned whether or not another 
life should be put in danger, given the fact that so much effort 
has been made to open the door to Sinn Fein to come into the 
democratic political arena. 
  [McGuinness] And we have been at the heart of that movement. 
Sinn Fein has taken a very active role. In fact, I think we can 
credibly make the case that we have been the initiators of this 
process. And I'm not going to go into a history of the whole 
business, but I think we can say with some credibility that we 
were the initiators of it, and we have been trying to bring 
about a situation where (?not a single life is lost). We 
realize that there's massive tragedy here in this part of 
Ireland where we live -- (?many) soldiers have lost their lives; 
a young child is lying on its deathbed in Armagh; Catholics have 
been killed daily by Loyalist paramilitaries. And all that we 
are doing --this is our primary political objective -- is to 
attempt to bring an end to all of this, and we are trying to do 
this as constructively as we possibly can. 
  [Correspondent] But don't you recognize that that child 
would 
not be lying on that bed in Armagh if it weren't for the IRA? 
  [McGuinness] Well, I (?just) don't think anybody would lose 
their lives in the situation here in the north if it wasn't for 
the political situation which we've all been condemned to live 
in for the last 25 years. And I don't think that we can see the 
issue of violence and what people are doing as separate somehow 
from the factors which are there in the background, which have 
caused this instability and violence which afflicts our 
community [words indistinct] 
  [Correspondent, interrupting] Can you give people 
encouragement, then? Can you give them some hope as the result 
of what has transpired over the last 24 hours? 
  [McGuinness] Yes, I think we can. Sinn Fein is still very, 
very committed to an effective peace process, but that must be a 
peace process which embraces everyone. No party must be 
excluded. And we are prepared to play a full and positive role 
in this. And we will continue with that. Of course. 
  [Correspondent] But don't you think this process could be 
speeded up at this stage? Because the longer it goes on, the 
more blood will be spilt. People are talking about something 
coming after the European elections now -- surely that's 
allowing the agony to continue too long? 
  [McGuinness] Well, I mean, even reading this morning's IRISH 
TIMES, I mean, there are people in Dublin, in the establishment 
there, who accept that because of the nature of Republicanism 
and the type of organization we are that this is by necessity 
going to take some time. Now I certainly hope that it will not 
be an overdue length of time and that we can get rid of this 
whole issue as quickly as we possibly can. And the reality is 
that we are in the middle of an election, the European 
elections, we do have a policy of consulting our membership. 
This is something that we do on a regular basis and by the 
nature of things we have to do this and this is going to cause, 
I believe, a slight delay. But hopefully it won't be too long. 
  [Correspondent] Given the fact that the British Government 
says that constitutional matters, including the Government of 
Ireland Act, can be on the table, do you feel that you can 
advise your supporters to look favorably on this commentary? 
  [McGuinness] Well, I think we will have to look at all of 
that, at everything which the British Government has said -- all 
the positive stuff and anything which may be negative -- and see 
what our opinion is at the end of that process. And I couldn't 
at this stage attempt to prejudge what the positive elements or 
negative elements are, but certainly we will give it very very 
serious consideration. And we will attempt to move the peace 
process on in a positive way -- absolutely. 
  [Correspondent] And that was the Sinn Fein leader Martin 
McGuinness speaking on the line from Northern Ireland.

<F P=106> ["j.t./DW"-signed report: "Germany Has a Duty To </F>
Participate"] 
  [Text] Oxford/Brussels -- German Defense Minister Volker 
Ruehe has once again called for a security partnership between 
NATO and Russia. Speaking at Oxford yesterday, he said NATO 
would be well-advised to respond positively to Moscow's 
expectations. It is, quite simply, entirely understandable that 
the great power Russia should wish to participate in the 
alliance process of formulating views if the issues in question 
concern overall European security and global strategic 
considerations. Ruehe said: "NATO cannot treat Russia like 
Tajikistan or Albania." 
  In comments addressed to Moscow, the defense minister said 
that Moscow must learn how to be a neighbor among neighbors as 
well as a partner among equals and act accordingly. Ruehe thus 
indirectly criticized statements by leading Russian politicians 
who have recently reserved for themselves the right to take 
unilateral steps should circumstances become critical in 
neighboring countries. 
  Russia must become a strategic partner for NATO, said Ruehe, 
and it must also feel that it is that. This should not mean, 
however, that the integration of Germany's immediate eastern 
neighbors into Western structures should be hindered. 
  In his Oxford address, Ruehe came out in favor of an active 
German foreign policy. If one does not "export" stability now, 
one will later be affected by instability oneself. Germany has 
a duty to participate. Ruehe said: "Germany must develop a new 
national tradition for the Berlin republic." 
  At NATO headquarters in Brussels, it was said that Russia 
should not be accorded any kind of special role under the 
Partnership for Peace. However, the alliance should develop 
appropriate relations with the Kremlin in view of Russia's 
significant geopolitical role. Defense Minister Pavel Grachev is 
coming to Brussels next week to hold talks. He will also 
discuss Russia's new military doctrine.

night, Hesse Interior Minister Herbert Guenther (SPD) decided in 
Wiesbaden to take this step. Kurdish offenders were to be 
excluded from the deportation ban, the Hesse Interior Ministry 
said. 
  The reason given by Guenther was that the situation of the 
Kurds in Turkey had deteriorated to such an extent that no 
responsibility could be assumed for the possible consequences of 
deportation. Guenther said the efforts of the German Government 
to make Turkey comply with human rights by means of a bilateral 
agreement were increasing doubts that deportees were at present 
dependent on the whim of government organs. Guenther called on 
the Federal Government to exert pressure on the Turkish 
Government to at last find a constructive, humanitarian solution 
to the Kurdish problem in Turkey.

  [Text] Ottobrunn near Munich -- The aviation and aerospace 
company of Daimler-Benz and the French aviation concern 
Aerospatiale have now specified their plans for a joint venture 
in the production of satellites. As Aerospatiale boss Louis 
Gallois reportedly announced in Cannes (southern France), a 
holding society is to be founded in Munich before the end of the 
year in which the two enterprises are to participate on a 50:50 
percent basis. Negotiations on this cooperation have not yet 
been concluded, a spokesman of the German Aerospace AG company 
stressed. According to Gallois, the two firms hope to achieve 
results by July. The partners believe that, in a self-confident 
manner, they will jointly become the largest European producer 
of satellites and a serious competitor for the English-French 
Matra-Marconi group.

  [Text] Berlin (DDP/ADN) -- As expected, none of the five 
candidates for the office of federal president has achieved the 
necessary absolute majority of 663 votes in the first Federal 
Assembly ballot. Of the l,317 valid votes cast, 604 went to the 
CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union] 
candidate Roman Herzog. The SPD [Social Democratic Party] 
candidate and North Rhine-Westphalian Minister-President 
Johannes Rau received 505 votes. The FDP [Free Democratic 
Party] candidate Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher received l32 votes. 
The east German civil rights campaigner Jens Reich received 62 
votes, and the candidate of the right-wing Republicans, Hans 
Hirzel, received 12 votes. There were two abstentions, and two 
votes were invalid. 
  Thus a second ballot is required where once again an 
absolute 
majority for the election of the new federal president is 
needed. A simple majority is sufficient in a third ballot.

<F P=106> [Martin S. Lambeck report: "Presidential Elections: </F>
Nervousness Within CDU Is Growing"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- In spite of intensive efforts to win over 
the electors of the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] before the 
vote by the Federal Assembly in Berlin on Monday [23 May], the 
CDU leadership is not certain that its candidate Roman Herzog 
will received the majority of votes. Against the backdrop of 
increasing nervousness -- also because of the votes of the Free 
Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] -- Juergen Ruettgers, the 
manager of the CDU/CSU [Christian Social Union] Bundestag group, 
admonished his own party in an interview with DIE WELT: "Every 
vote will be decisive in Berlin. No experiments should be made 
in the election of the head of state." 
  The statement by Saxony-Anhalt FDP leader Peter Kunert that 
there is a tendency in the new laender that "speaks clearly in 
favor of the candidate of Johannes Rau, the Social Democratic 
Party of Germany," caused quite a stir. The CDU/CSU leadership 
has made it clear that "if Herzog fails, the coalition will 
break apart, and we can forget the rest of the election year." 
The CDU/CSU Bundestag group, which is particularly skeptical of 
the FDP, stated: "If Rau should be elected, a completely new 
situation will arise." Last Monday CDU/CSU Bundestag group 
leader Wolfgang Schaeuble made the following skeptical statement 
at the meeting of the CDU Executive Committee: "No decision is 
made until all votes are counted." 
  The CDU/CSU leadership is particularly concerned about the 
voting behavior of the electors from the new laender. They are 
unpredictable, and it is not clear for whom they will vote. 
There were rumors in Bonn that the SPD is trying to "buy" 
electors by promising them positions in their east German home 
towns. In view of this, the critical position of former 
Transportation Minister Guenther Krause (CDU) is to be assessed 
as less significant. The leadership of the CDU/CSU Bundestag 
group does not consider this a "Bonn issue." 
  This became clear during a meeting between Roman Herzog and 
about 50 east German CDU deputies in the basement of the 
government building in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania on Thursday 
evening. Deputy Bundestag group leader Clemens Schwalbe from 
Saxony-Anhalt assured Herzog of the following amid the applause 
of the delegates: "You can rely on the east Germans next 
Monday." Krause did not attend the meeting, during which beer 
and fish specialties were served. 
  The east German CDU delegates vehemently rejected any 
suspicion that one of them is preparing a stab in Herzog's back. 
Ulrich Klinkert from Saxony-Anhalt stressed: "Those who speak 
of the east German delegates as a wavering front are not 
realistic." Participants in the meeting, which lasted well into 
the night, spoke of a "breakthrough for Herzog." 
  The candidate succeeded in creating a humorous atmosphere. 
He referred to Humphrey Bogart's legendary final scene in 
"Casablanca." When he was asked what he thinks of the criticism 
voiced by Saxon State Minister Arnold Vaatz, Herzog humorously 
quoted the final sentence from the famous film: "This might be 
the beginning of a wonderful friendship."

<F P=106> [Interview with Irmgard Schwaetzer, construction minister </F>
and FDP deputy chairperson, by Ursula Welter; place and date not 
given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Welter] The Federal Assembly 
will elect a president -- a successor to Richard von Weizsaecker 
-- in Berlin tomorrow. Roman Herzog rejected general dual 
citizenship. He was criticized for that by the Free Democratic 
Party of Germany [FDP]. Still, the Christian Democratic 
Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] hopes that the FDP will 
support Herzog in the third ballot. The CDU/CSU has threatened 
that the climate in the coalition will deteriorate if the FDP 
does not comply with its wishes. Will your party yield to 
pressure? 
  [Schwaetzer] No, on no account. It would be better for the 
CDU/CSU to cease these threatening gestures because this is no 
way to behave between partners. It is simply bad form. By the 
way, the threats will certainly have an effect on the FDP, but 
by no means the desired one. The FDP will discuss its future 
plans completely independently between the individual ballots. 
The FDP will support Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher. We have an 
excellent presidential candidate. It would have been good for 
the CDU/CSU if it had endorsed our fine candidate instead of 
desperately searching for a candidate of its own. 
Unfortunately, this was not the case. Anyway, the FDP will not 
yield to pressure. We will calmly discuss our behavior in every 
individual ballot. 
  [Welter] Thus, we have to discuss the hypothetical case 
that, after the deliberations between the ballots, you might 
arrive at the conclusion that Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher will not 
participate in the third ballot. This possibility cannot be 
ruled out completely. Will it then be possible for the FDP to 
vote for candidate Herzog whom it criticized strongly in the 
past? 
  [Schwaetzer] A candidate that has been nominated by another 
party is never the ideal or desired candidate of the Liberals. 
Thus, the FDP will have to deliberate carefully which candidate 
it should support. I am optimistic that the FDP will vote 
largely unanimously for a certain candidate. This might require 
a longer process of discussion, but this is the way many 
decisions are made within the FDP. My personal opinion is -- I 
already stressed this before some of the candidates were 
nominated -- that what we need in the next five years is a 
president who can build bridges, who can bring people together, 
and who does not polarize society. Particularly because other 
countries are observing Germany with a sharp eye, it is very 
important for the head of state himself to represent a 
confidence-building measure. 
  [Welter] You have just described the qualities of the future 
president. Yet, you mention no name. 
  [Schwaetzer] This is not my task at the moment. We support 
Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher, and we will vote for her. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Rudolf Scharping, SPD chairman and </F>
minister-president of Rhineland-Palatinate, and Joschka Fischer, 
Greens deputy and environmental minister of Hesse, by Thomas 
Hanke and Fritz Vorholz; place and date not given: "You Have To 
Say What Is Important"] 
  [Text] [DIE ZEIT] Mr. Scharping, have we understood you 
correctly? You said you want to struggle for "ecologically 
honest prices" and an "economic and ecological reorientation of 
the tax system," and you have also said that "the costs of 
mobility must reflect the costs of environmental damage." 
  [Scharping] Yes. Then there will be no constant development 
without ecological progress. 
  [DIE ZEIT] We are basing our question on quotations from the 
CDU [Christian Democratic Union] basic program. 
  [Scharping] That does not matter. The CDU makes 
unscrupulous use of definitions. If one wants to understand CDU 
policies, one must pay attention to results, and ignore the 
practice of playing about with definitions. 
  [DIE ZEIT] I take it that if you become chancellor you will 
combine the combating of unemployment with the ecological 
revival of the economy? 
  [Scharping] That is correct. It will include a 
modernization of the state's social spheres. 
  [DIE ZEIT] You, Mr. Fischer, have described the SPD [Social 
Democratic Party of Germany] program as "Green cosmetics." Why? 
  [Scharping] If the SPD wants an ecological restructuring, 
that is certainly praiseworthy and good. But we will have to 
see whether the government assumes responsibility for this. 
That is the problem. 
  But before we indulge in a political dispute, I would like 
to 
say what this country really needs, and I simply cannot imagine 
how one can create the required number of jobs without investing 
major funds in an expansion of the transportation system or 
energy supply. These funds will have to be consumed, and society 
will have to be told about this. 
  [Scharping] There is a major difference between the SPD and 
the Greens. We say that the level of taxation to be reached in 
1995 must not go any higher. 
  [Fischer] I agree. We are united on that issue. 
  [Scharping] In that case you have to explain how, apart from 
the 10 percent supplementary tax, you intend to include the 
investment aid levy, labor market levy, increase in capital 
transfer tax, property tax, capital gains tax, crude oil tax, 
living space tax, speculation tax, tax on increased property 
value, and packaging levy in your concept. The Greens are 
saying virtually nothing about the SPD's wish to balance out 
these expenses. 
  [Fischer] Wrong. When we talk about additional tax burdens, 
we must examine shifts in the tax balance, not additional 
quantities of taxes. The tax we want to impose on raw material 
and energy consumption must of course be gradually balanced out 
in the form of improved services, or by a reduction in 
income-related taxes. 
  [Scharping] The SPD program is extraordinarily specific 
concerning ecological measures and concerning ways of relieving 
incomes of the tax burden and easing the tax burden of 
enterprises that are undertaking investments. Examples are tax 
exemption on the lowest incomes, a uniform child benefit of 250 
marks per month and per child, and an abolition of Kohl's 
solidarity tax supplement, instead of which an extra tax could 
be imposed on the first 20 percent of one's income. That would 
increase and strengthen growth. We want to create jobs and 
reduce wage-related costs, in this way making a serious effort 
at relieving the burden on employment and increasing the burden 
on raw materials and energy consumption. On the other hand, the 
Greens program is doing nothing except causing a new ecological 
debate. 
  [Fischer] I admit our party congress did not discuss a 
specific adaptation to the finance concept. We did not intend 
to discuss it in any case. But the SPD also seems not to have 
examined this topic comprehensively. It seems to have given it 
merely a cursory examination. The situation will look quite 
different when an onslaught on the state's coffers is finally 
made and the financial realities are spelled out in Bonn. 
  But it is quite wrong to believe that we have not said 
anything on the subject of tax relief. For instance, we want to 
balance out the capital gains tax by means of adjustments to 
other taxes. In this point I think we are more honest. 
  [Scharping] But the Constitutional Court must provide a 
guideline before then. Our program states that we cannot impose 
a bigger tax burden on used assets and on pensions. Neither can 
we increase tax on owner-occupied accommodation. 
  But the main point of economic and ecological development is 
the need to release the forces of growth in Germany. That can 
only succeed if enterprises have clear conditions that they can 
rely on, conditions that are not bureaucratic and do not inhibit 
a product-oriented environmental protection. But that will not 
work if we keep getting new signals for new tax burdens. 
  [Fischer] I see no reason to object. These new signals, 
primarily signals for investments, must be green-oriented, so 
that new environmentally friendly jobs can be created. Then I 
too will be ready to help abolish the bureaucracy surrounding 
environmental legislation. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Mr. Scharping, basically the SPD also wants to 
change the price traffic lights to green. But your program 
conceals real intention behind the statement "appropriate 
measures." That is very vague. 
  [Scharping] On the contrary. We have said very clearly that 
the consumption of energy and raw materials must be made more 
expensive. But since the Maastricht Treaty, we no longer have 
the possibility of implementing our own energy taxation. This 
now has to be decided on a European level. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Our research has provided us with a different 
answer. There is no real ban on implementing our own tax. 
  [Scharping] Yes there is. In any case, the German economy's 
international bearing is stronger than that of the other major 
economies, and one cannot support Europe politically while 
retaining an economy that is only geared internally. 
  [Fischer] Rudolf, the European Union [EU] does not stop 
you taking the lead, and that does not mean one is a 
nationalist. You seem to be hiding behind Europe, just like the 
present Federal Government. 
  [Scharping] On the contrary. 
  [Fischer] And I do not think we can seriously restructure 
the 
environment after energy prices have become more expensive. 
European electricity prices are moving in a sort of channel. I 
think we should travel along the top of this channel in order to 
create pressure leading to a greater efficiency of new 
technologies. That is also the idea behind establishing the 
price of gasoline to five marks per liter. No one among us has 
said that we want to raise gasoline prices to this level 
immediately. 
  [Scharping] In the first year, a liter of gasoline should go 
up by 50 pfennigs, and in subsequent years 30 pfennigs annually. 
  [Fischer] We gradually want to raise crude oil taxes, in 
order to finance the development of an energy-saving automobile. 
That is the main objective. At the same time, we want to use 
these funds to develop local transportation systems. On the 
other hand, I consider your views half-hearted. You know very 
well that if you are serious about your slogan of "work, work, 
work," you have to proceed in this direction. But you obviously 
do not have the courage to say so right now. 
  [Scharping] You are not going to make this idea any more 
correct by constantly repeating it. As far as energy prices are 
concerned, we are quite near the top of the European table. A 
global market can no longer be financed out of German state 
resources alone. I consider it naive and dangerous to think 
that it can. 
  Ecological modernization is the human-friendly way to the 
future. It is a political and technological challenge, and not a 
bureaucratic straitjacket. At the same time, this is one of the 
growth markets of the future. One must convince others about 
this. 
  [DIE ZEIT] When will you convince the European partners? 
  [Scharping] There are enough objectives we can implement 
independently. In the construction sphere, we want to draw 
attention to ecological aspects. Electricity can be generated 
from recycled energy sources, and thus relieved of tax. We want 
to improve storage facilities for this type of electricity, and 
we want to encourage the use of solar energy in our "100,000 
Roofs Program." In this sphere of environmental progress alone, 
the SPD has come out with over 30 very specific suggestions that 
I fail to see among the Greens. This is national policy that 
only we can implement. It is scientifically future-oriented and 
environmentally wise, and it will create jobs. 
  [Fischer] The main problem is the prices of energy. Even 
the "100,000 Roofs Program" will not help much unless recyclable 
energy sources are economically viable. What I miss in the 
entire debate is a determination to proceed with a thorough 
renewal, for example a decision to solve traffic problems in 
conurbations in the course of 20 years, or turn Germany into a 
leading nation in the use of solar energy. If there were a 
second railroad revolution or a breakthrough in energy 
economization, you would certainly get your new jobs. But you 
must have the courage to set the financial points in such a way 
that the train travels in the right direction. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Until now, Germany has performed quite well with 
its leading cost-effective environmental policy. 
  [Scharping] Careful. It is true that we are number one in 
the world concerning industrial smoke filtering, water 
filtering, and removal of waste. But I fear we are threatened 
with a delay in development because until now we have 
concentrated almost exclusively on the environment. In Japan, 
on the other hand, the government, industry, and science are all 
involved in what is known as "ecolution," that is a combination 
of ecology and evolution. In the United States there are 
similar initiatives -- not just in the sphere of "information 
highways," but also in the "clear car" concept. With the 
government acting as anchorman, the experiences of science, 
industry, and research are brought together in order, for 
example, to produce cars that consume less fuel. Therefore in 
Germany, too, we must redirect our steps so as not to miss this 
opportunity. 
  [DIE ZEIT] For this purpose, the SPD has suggested a "Forum 
of Future-Oriented Products." Mr. Fischer obviously has grater 
trust in price signals. 
  [Fischer] So does Rudolf Scharping. If he pauses to examine 
the consequences of what he is saying, he will go further than 
the mere idea of producing a fuel-efficient car. The price of 
gasoline is presently 1.50 German marks per liter, about the 
same as at the end of the 1950's and the beginning of the 1960's 
when one ignores inflation. In any case, I am quite prepared to 
talk to him about the speed with which the price of gasoline 
should increase. I do not understand why the SPD is so afraid 
to discuss this. 
  [Scharping] You are underplaying people's acceptance of an 
ecological reform policy. You will never gain support for a 
policy aimed at increasing the price of gasoline by 50 pfennigs 
next year, just as you will never make people believe that 
nuclear energy can be given up in one or two years. That is 
utter nonsense. 
  [Fischer] Your idea about reducing the speed limit is just 
as nonsensical. To bring speed limits in line with the rest of 
Europe... 
  [Scharping] We have not done that. We have said: A 
reduction in the speed limit to 130 kmh on 90 percent of German 
freeways, in keeping with EU recommendations... 
  [Fischer] But Germany is the only country without a general 
speed limit. This makes as much sense as the statement of ours 
that you keep on quoting. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Mr. Scharping, is it possible that you do not 
trust the voters? 
  [Scharping] The voters are much wiser than some 
propagandists think. But in Germany there is a shortage of at 
least 5 million competitive jobs, 2 million people are looking 
for affordable accommodation, and 1 million children are being 
brought up with social security benefits. No progress can be 
achieved in Germany if one pursues the slogan "More Tax and More 
Bureaucracy." Therefore we must open the road to growth, or 
else there will be no boom, no permanent jobs, and no stable 
state finances. I also wish to win majority support for a 
triple reform idea -- a socially strong, socially just, and an 
ecologically modern Germany. 
  [Fischer] We will see what happens about majority support. 
But as far as the diagnosis is concerned, I see nothing wrong. 
However, the mass unemployment, the enormous costs of 
unification, the missing kindergarten places, the necessary 
educational expenses, and the costs of the environmental 
restructuring have brought us to a point where we just tell the 
people: The high level of consumption of the 1980's cannot be 
maintained because of the drastically rising state debts under 
the Kohl/Waigel government, and because we need additional funds 
to safeguard the future. Therefore I think it is a good idea to 
say before the elections what is the most important thing. 
  [Scharping] You must say what is important. You are talking 
not of restructuring, but of increases. Let me tell you this. 
If the Greens suggest a tax on the size of accommodation, and 
raise the tax on property and crude oil and introduce an 
additional tax... 
  [Fischer] I had better keep quiet after the public row you 
have caused. 
  [Scharping] That is why I am asking. When you carry out all 
your plans and work out how much they cost, you will realize 
that a typical family with two children in a Frankfurt suburb 
will never be able to make ends meet. You Greens can never 
reimburse with benefits what you demand in the form of levies. 
  [Fischer] That is childish. I would not want to see a 
worker's family with two children earning a mere 3,500 marks per 
month. But one cannot avoid considering a fairer distribution 
of burdens. He who can afford more should pay more, for I am 
convinced that a greater burden has to be borne in order to 
combat unemployment. 
  [Scharping] Joschka, your idea of a new "social contract" 
between "ecologically conscious better wage earners," as the 
Greens describe them, and the "socially disadvantaged" is too 
short-sighted. This is not a reform coalition. Qualified 
workers, engineers, and self-employed persons belong to it. 
  [Fischer] Exactly. And these are the people who have to be 
told the truth. 
  [DIE ZEIT] According to the SPD program, the social security 
system and tax system are supposed to be implemented together. 
  [Scharping] Right. State benefits that serve to bridge the 
social gap must not increase in line with incomes. That is why 
we insist on fixed amounts of money for child benefit and 
housing construction, and the abolition of tax on these 
benefits. This will release many people from the tax burden, 
and render many bureaucratic procedures superfluous. 
  [DIE ZEIT] I wonder how long we can continue making certain 
benefits also available to better wage earners. 
  [Scharping] That is something which the tax system must 
control, not the social security system. Otherwise there will 
be overview, and no majority support. 
  [Fischer] We will see. 
  [Sharping] I overlook the fact that some of your views are 
quite unfeasible. Even in environmental policy, you are not 
doing the things you should have and could have done. Saarland 
has gone further than any other land as far as solar energy is 
concerned, Hamburg has achieved the greatest progress concerning 
water conservation. The pollution map shows only two rivers 
marked in dark red -- the Emscher, and the Ried in Hesse. I 
could give more examples. 
  [Fischer] Your examples are inaccurate. You omit to mention 
our 105 million mark expenditure on water conservation measures, 
our law on energy conservation, our program for improving the 
safety of chemical installations, and a lot of other things. 
But let us stick to nuclear energy. The Greens have resolved 
-- against my wishes -- that the abandoning of nuclear energy 
within the space of two years is technically and legally 
possible. There is nothing wrong with that. But who is to pay 
for it? 
  [Scharping] It would cost 200 billion marks. 
  [Fischer] It is possible to reach a consensus whereby the 
abandoning of nuclear energy can only be seriously possible when 
there is a reform coalition. But I do not know how long that 
would last. What I do know is that the oldest nuclear plants, 
such as Biblis A, will be out of service. One can immediately 
say no to the processing of nuclear fuel abroad. 
  [Scharping] I agree. 
  [Fischer] Wonderful. Therefore, the processing facility in 
Sellafeld will also be expendable. All this can be achieved. 
The remaining operating periods for individual reactors will be 
agreed upon, and the disposal of strict limits of nuclear waste 
will have to be arranged. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Mr. Scharping, if you become chancellor, how long 
will it be before the last nuclear plant is switched off? 
  [Scharping] Not very long. Stade can be closed down, and 
Biblis A as well. Closing down the rest depends on an energy 
consensus that must lead to the abandoning of nuclear energy. 
  [DIE ZEIT] What about the option of reverting to nuclear 
energy if there turns out to be a safe reactor? 
  [Scharping] No, there would be no return to nuclear energy.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "ZDF Political Barometer: Mood in </F>
May; Optimism Is Prevailing Again"] 
  [Text] Never before after the all-German Bundestag 
elections have the citizens in east Germany assessed the general 
economic situation as optimistically as this month: A total of 
4 percent described it as good (3 percent in April), 53 percent 
(45) believe that it is partly good and partly bad, and only 43 
percent (52) consider it bad. 
  Increasing optimism is also noticeable in the assessment of 
the further economic development in Germany: For the first time 
this year, a majority of Germans (52 percent) believe that the 
German economy will improve. In fact, optimism is still greater 
than in the east, but it has increased in both parts of Germany. 
<H5>  Remarkable Trends </H5>
  These two trends are among the most remarkable results of 
the 
May poll which was carried out by the Mannheim election research 
group among over 2,000 citizens in east and west German for the 
ZDF political barometer. 
  The general political mood has changed in different ways in 
east and west Germany in the past four weeks: In the west, 
support for the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social 
Union [CDU/CSU] has slightly declined, whereas it has clearly 
increased in the east. the Social Democratic Party of Germany 
[SPD] achieved slightly better results in the west, but lost 
considerable support in the east. There have been no changes 
for the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP], which would 
receive under 5 percent of the vote. Support for Alliance 
90/Greens has slightly dropped both in the east and the west. 
In the whole of Germany, the CDU/CSU was supported by 35 
percent in May (unchanged), the SPD by 41, and the FDP by 4 
percent. Alliance 90/Greens received 9 percent (-\2 percentage 
points), and all other parties together 11 percent (+\2), 
including the Republikaner at 4 (+\2), and the Party of 
Democratic Socialism [PDS] at 4 percent (unchanged). 
  As usual, these results have not been assessed according to 
their political significance. Thus, a comparison of the 
question concerning future voter behavior and the popularity 
measurements of the political barometer with the politically 
assessed results of other polling institutes is only possible to 
a limited extent. For this reason, the political barometer 
publishes the "projection," which means that the political mood 
measured in the topical investigations are projected to an 
election result ("If Bundestag elections were held next 
Sunday..."). This calculated projection is based on findings 
concerning the long-term stability of voter behavior during 
Bundestag elections resulting from the social structures, and on 
findings concerning the theoretical outcome of Bundestag 
elections under "normal" conditions. In May the result is as 
follows: CDU/CSU 38 percent (+\1 percent as compared with last 
April), SPD 39 percent (unchanged), FDP 5 percent (unchanged), 
Alliance 90/Greens 8 percent (-\1), other parties 10 percent 
(unchanged), including the Republikaner at 4 and the PDS at 3 
percent. Thus, a coalition between the SPD and the Alliance 
90/Greens could rely on a parliamentary majority (47 percent) in 
May, too. 
<H5>  Good Rating for the Government </H5>
  Satisfaction with the government -- as usually measured on 
the basis of a scale reaching from +\5 (very satisfied) to -\5 
(very dissatisfied) -- has again improved throughout Germany in 
May. to -\0.4 percent. This is the best rating for the 
government since May 1992; in April it was still -\0.6, and in 
March -\0.9. At 0.3, the performance of the SPD in its 
opposition role has been assessed slightly better in May than in 
April (0.2) 
  What is remarkable about the results of the poll by the 
election research group in May is that the popularity of the 10 
major politicians -- according of those polled -- has not 
decreased: Chancellor Helmut Kohl's popularity has slightly 
increased throughout Germany from 0.1 to 0.3, Labor Minister 
Norbert Bluem improved his rating from 0.7 to 0.9, Finance 
Minister Theo Waigel from -\0.4 to -\0.2, Parliamentary 
President Rita Suessmuth from 1.0 to 1.1, and CDU/CSU Bundestag 
group leader Wolfgang Schaeuble from 0.9 to 1.1. 

<H5>    Preference for Scharping </H5>
  Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel's popularity has clearly 
increased throughout Germany (from 0.4 to 0.7 percent). 
Hans-Dietrich Genscher, who is still considered one of the 10 
major politicians by the population, received a rating of 2.6 in 
May (2.5 in April). 
  At 1.1, SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping reached the same value 
as in April throughout Germany. The popularity of the SPD's 
presidential candidate Johannes Rau has clearly increased -- 
from -\1.5 to +\1.9. Nothing changed for Brandenburg Labor 
Minister Regine Hildebrandt (1.8 percent; known to 61 percent). 
  In May, too, the majority of the German population prefers 
Rudolf Scharping as new chancellor. His lead over Kohl has 
again increased slightly. A total of 40 percent of all those 
polled would prefer Helmut Kohl as chancellor. In April the 
percentage was 39 and in May 35 percent. Fifty-one percent 
would like a Chancellor Scharping. The share of those who did 
not want to or could not make a decision dropped to 9 percent in 
May. It is true that, at 55 percent, support for Scharping is 
still greater in east Germany than in the west (50), but the 
difference has become smaller. Support for Kohl, too, is 
largely the same in east (39) and west Germany (40). 
  Sixteen percent of all Germans believe that it is already 
clear who will win the next Bundestag elections in October; 83 
percent are of the opposite view. In May, the majority of 
Germans also expect a victory of the Bonn opposition parties, 
but the lead over the CDU/CSU has decreased. In the whole of 
Germany, 40 percent believe in a victory of the SPD and its 
leader, and 5 percent in a majority for a coalition between the 
SPD and Alliance 90/Greens. A total of 27 percent expect a 
victory of the CDU/CSU and of Helmut Kohl, 5 percent a 
continuation of the existing government coalition, and 15 
percent do not know who will win the next Bundestag election. An 
election victory by the CDU/CSU is considered more likely in the 
west. The same applies to the SPD. A grand coalition or an 
alliance between the SPD and the Alliance 90/Greens is viewed 
more likely in the east. 
<H5>  Mood for Rau as President </H5>
  In the event that no party can govern on its own, the 
following preferences resulted form the May poll: Coalition 
between the SPD and the Alliance 90/Greens 24 percent, grand 
coalition (CDU/CSU and SPD) 23 percent, and continuation of the 
existing coalition 15 percent. 
  A few days before the election of the president by the 
Federal Assembly, Johannes Rau enjoys a clear lead among the 
population. Asked about the president they would prefer out of 
four candidates, exactly 50 percent chose Rau, 19 percent Roman 
Herzog, 16 percent Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher, and 4 percent Jens 
Reich. Every 10th German has not yet made up his mind. The 
preference for Rau is even clearer in the east (53 percent) than 
in the west (49 percent). Herzog can rely on more support in the 
old laender (20 percent) than in the east (16 percent). 
Irrespective of the popularity among the population, 40 percent 
expect Herzog to win presidential elections; only every third 
German believes in a victory for Johannes Rau. 
  In May the fight against unemployment was again the major 
topic in Germany --even though its significance declined 
slightly in the east and the west. Asked to mention two issues, 
without any suggestions being given, 55 percent of the west 
Germans chose unemployment. It was followed by asylum and 
foreigners (31 percent), right-wing radicalism (17), 
environmental protection (13), inflation and economic 
developments (12), crime, law and order (7), rents and housing 
(6), problems resulting from German unification (5), other 
social problems (5), weariness of politics (5), and taxes (5). 
  The priorities are as follows in the east: Unemployment 
(79), crime, law and order (17), problems resulting from 
unification (14), asylum and foreigners (10), rents and housing, 
right-wing radicalism, economic developments and upswing (9 
percent each), other social problems (7), pensions, peace and 
detente, reduction of social benefits, and environmental 
protection (5 percent each).

<F P=106> ["rmc"-signed report: "FDP Blocks Ruehe's Bundeswehr Plan"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn -- The first attempt by a coalition working 
party to overcome the FDP [Free Democratic Party of Germany] 
blockade with respect to the plans of Defense Minister Volker 
Ruehe, Christian Democratic Union [CDU], for the Bundeswehr has 
failed. The coalition conflict has been postponed. 
  The working party held a meeting at the Defense Ministry's 
visitors mess yesterday morning. The members include the 
defense minister, the CDU's Friedrich Bohl, chief of the federal 
chancellery, Foreign Office Secretary Ursula Seiler-Albring of 
the FDP, and defense politicians from the coalition parties. 
  The group held a meeting to settle a dispute between the FDP 
and the CDU/CSU [Christian Social Union] about Ruehe's concept 
for the Bundeswehr. The concept envisages a reduction in forces 
from the current 370,000 to 340,000 and a reduction in the 
length of military service from 12 to 10 months. 
  The coalition was unable to settle the dispute yesterday. 
The next meeting is scheduled for 16 June. Results are 
expected before the summer Bundestag recess. It seems 
questionable whether the new Bundeswehr concept can be presented 
by the end of the current Bundestag term of office in the fall. 
In FDP circles, it is being said that the there are substantial 
differences on important points. The Liberals have criticized 
the fact that Ruehe's guidelines completely lack clarity on "the 
foreign policy and general policy implications" of troop 
reductions. That is why the FDP members of the working party 
have presented an 11-page catalogue of questions that are 
intended to provide the guidelines with a "solid and serious 
basis." They envisage a "further need for agreement." 
  The FDP is also opposed to the defense minister's intention 
to introduce a 12-month voluntary period of service alongside 
the 10-month period of military service. The move is said to be 
"half-hearted." The FDP believes that basic military service 
should be reduced to nine months. Conscripts should have the 
option of being "soldiers on a monthly basis" for up to 23 
months. In contrast to the CDU/CSU, the FDP insists that if 
basic military service is reduced, then alternative civilian 
service should be reduced to under 15 months. 
  The working party also failed to agree on which garrisons 
would be closed in the event that troop levels are reduced. 
Ruehe's plan envisages the closure of 50 bases.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Today, the cabinet approved the 
agreement between the Federal Government and Lufthansa on 
pensions for Lufthansa employees in Bonn today. The cabinet has 
thus cleared the way for a complete privatization of Lufthansa, 
Federal Transport Minister Matthias Wissmann (Christian 
Democratic Union) told the Bundestag. The privatization is a 
milestone on the path toward securing the company's 
competitiveness. 
  Agreement on the pension claims came about in early May. 
Finance Minister Waigel said he is prepared to provide 1.5 
billion marks for Lufthansa employees. As the Federal 
Government does not wish to participate in the impending 
increase in share capital, its proportion of Lufthansa shares 
will fall to under 50 percent. The agreement on a new company 
pension arrangement for the 48,000 or so Lufthansa employees was 
concluded on 10 May.

  CSO 

  [Editorial Report] The recent federal court decisons in 
cases involving the public dissemination of the so-called 
"Auschwitz lie" (Auschwitz-Luege)--the claim that mass 
extermination of Jews did not occur at Auschwitz during World 
War II--coinciding with an increase in anti-Semitic incidents 
and growing public concern about the state's inability to deal 
with right-wing extremism, have evoked a good deal of press 
commentary critiquing the courts' rulings, assessing their 
effect on the freedom of expression, and debating the 
advisability of specifically criminalizing public expressions of 
the "Auschwitz lie." 
  The Munich daily SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG reported on 27 April 
that the Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe issued an 
opinion on 26 April that clears the way for the prosecution of 
individuals for the public utterance or publication of the 
"Auschwitz lie," the denial of the systematic murder of Jews in 
the concentration camps of the Third Reich. The case was brought 
by the Munich-Upper Bavaria district organization of the NPD 
(National Party of Germany) against Munich officials who had 
granted the party a permit for a public meeting only on the 
condition that no speaker utter a denial of the Holocaust. The 
Court's First Chamber, presided over by Constitutional Court 
President Roman Herzog, ruled that the "Auschwitz lie" is a 
palpably false assertion and a serious denigration of the 
reputation of both the actual victims and Jews still living in 
Germany. The Court thus ruled that it is not covered by freedom 
of speech, and is punishable under law. In contrast, in an 
opinion on a second case issued at the same time, the court 
ruled that banning a book in which the author denies German 
guilt for the outbreak of World War II would be unconstitutional 
and that the author's exposition of his historical thesis is 
protected under freedom of speech. 
  This pair of decisions came only days after the Federal 
Supreme Court (BGH) had issued a written opinion substantiating 
its decision--announced on 15 March--overturning the public 
incitement conviction of NPD national chairman Guenter Deckert 
for spreading the "Auschwitz lie," and returning the case to the 
lower court for retrial. Since the BGH decision in the Deckert 
case had created the impression in some quarters that the 
"Auschwitz lie" was no longer punishable under law, as reported 
by SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG on 27 April, the Federal Constitutional 
Court, evidently in response, acted "unusually quickly" to issue 
its own unanimous opinion to the contrary. 
  Commenting on the BGH decision in the Deckert case, Ursula 
Knapp in the Frankfurt/Main daily FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU of 12 
April described the current period as one in which no day passes 
without "anti-Jewish attacks," and anti-Semitism has again 
become a "topic" in Germany. In this atmosphere, if the federal 
judges were to hold to their view "that the `Auschwitz lie' in 
itself, without further evidence of neo-Nazi sentiment, can no 
longer be forbidden as public incitement, there would be dire 
consequences." In an indictment of the FRG political and legal 
establishment for having "prepared" the ground for the growth of 
right-wing extremism, Martin Winter, in the FRANKFURTER 
RUNDSCHAU of 7 April, took aim at federal judges and other 
justice authorities: "Federal judges who cannot recognize public 
incitement in the Auschwitz lie make themselves just as culpable 
as protectors of the constitution, police officers, prosecutors, 
and judges who have long treated right-wing extremist 
perpetrators of violence with amazing leniency." 
<H5>  No Acquittal </H5>
  Following the Federal Constitutional Court's decision, 
Joachim Kaeppner, in a signed page-one editorial in the Hamburg 
weekly DEUTSCHES ALLGEMEINES SONNTAGSBLATT of 29 April, defended 
the Federal Supreme Court judges, who had "never" meant their 
decision to be interpreted as an "acquittal" of the "Auschwitz 
lie," and cited the satisfaction of Ignatz Bubis, chairman of 
the Central Council of Jews in Germany, with the Constitutional 
Court's unambiguous ruling which ensures that "there can never 
be an acquittal of the `Auschwitz lie.'" Thus, the "much 
maligned" judicial authorities, he asserted, "are proving 
themselves capable of putting up a fight against the right." 
Rudolf Wassermann, commenting in the Hamburg daily DIE WELT of 
28 April, also welcomed the Constitutional Court's militant 
response to those who would deny the horrors of Nazism: "With 
the decision, Karlsruhe has knocked a weapon out of the hands of 
extremists on the far-right wing of the political spectrum." In 
a broader sense, since the deniers of the Holocaust "are 
betraying" the principles on which the Federal Republic was 
founded, "this state should be a militant democracy which 
defends itself when antidemocrats want to break loose." 
<H5>  Two Lies </H5>
  Viewing the Court's seemingly divergent opinions on the 
"Auschwitz lie" and the "war guilt lie," the SUEDDEUTSCHE 
ZEITUNG, in an editorial on 27 April, posed the question: "How 
should a state which has been damaged throughout the world due 
to the neo-Nazis react to such propaganda nonsense?" In both 
cases the "basic rule of a free democracy," that each person 
should be able to say freely what he or she thinks, should 
apply, but with the proviso that "the right of freedom of speech 
gives no unlimited right to lies and insults." Christian 
Semler, in a signed editorial in the 27 April edition of the 
Berlin daily DIE TAGESZEITUNG, also welcomed the Constitutional 
Court's placing of limits on the freedom of public expression of 
opinion as it applies in the case of the "Auschwitz lie." With 
its decision, he writes, "the Constitutional Court has not so 
much broken new ground, as newly staked out the boundaries on 
familiar territory." At a time when even the Office for the 
Protection of the Constitution has "no criteria for right-wing 
extremism in Germany," Hans Schueler wrote in the Hamburg weekly 
DIE ZEIT of 29 April, "how good it is, therefore, that the 
Karlsruhe constitutional judges at least, with two decisions, 
have now let us know what's what, so that voters may preserve 
their basic democratic attitude and at the same time protect 
themselves from deviations toward the extreme Right." However, 
while the Karlsruhe court has cleared the way for convictions on 
the charge of public incitement in cases involving the 
"Auschwitz lie," the FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU pointed out in a 27 
April editorial: "How the criminal court judges will handle 
these directives, how they will rule in individual cases, does 
not of course fall within the purview of the guardians of the 
constitution." Reacting positively to the suggestion of former 
Constitutional Court judge Ernst Mahrenholz that the laender 
appoint special prosecutors to speed up prosecution in the 
mounting cases of right-extremist criminality, including the 
"Auschwitz lie," the Bonn weekly RHEINISCHER MERKUR 
editorialized in its 29 April edition: "Only swift punishment 
is a deterrent and creates respect for the law which tramples 
right-extremist criminals under foot. Immediate action is 
called for. Also and especially because in 1994 we are in an 
election year." 
<H5>  Criminalization Debated </H5>
  The federal court decisions have also sparked a debate over 
whether the penal code should be amended to specifically 
criminalize the "Auschwitz lie." In a page-one editorial in the 
Frankfurt/Main daily FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE on 7 April, Eckhard 
Fuhr opposed the intention of the SPD, shared by Federal Justice 
Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, to quickly close 
the perceived legal loophole ostensibly permitting the 
dissemination of the "Auschwitz lie" in the wake of the initial 
announcement of the Federal Supreme Court's decision in the 
Deckert case: "If the genocide against the Jews is not to become 
a dark, tabu-reinforced myth in the public consciousness, but is 
rather to remain an object of living and tormenting remembrance, 
then the penal code should be left alone. The recognition of 
truth cannot be forced." Also addressing renewed efforts--such 
a proposal had been made in the early 1980's--"to stiffen the 
threats of the penal code against disputing or minimizing of 
National Socialist acts of violence against the Jews," Friedrich 
Karl Fromme, editor for domestic politics and coordination, in a 
later page-one editorial in the FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE on 27 
April, reached a similar conclusion: "Historical truth cannot 
be established by the penal code; that ill befits a state 
committed to liberality, as painful or embarrassing as it may be 
in any particular case." According to Goetz Aly, commenting in 
the 19 April edition of DIE TAGESZEITUNG, more important than an 
amendment of the penal code is the development of a "democratic 
consensus" including the historical fact of Auschwitz as an 
integral part: "For if one advocates the punishment of those 
who assert an `Auschwitz lie,' then for that purpose not a 
scientific, but rather a democratic agreement is necessary. 
With the use of Auschwitz as a political-moral all-purpose 
weapon, as chiefly representatives of the left and left-liberal 
milieu treat it, such a consensus is made more difficult." In 
response to the views published by Fuhr and Aly, SPD (Social 
Democratic Party of Germany) Deputy Chairman Herta 
Daeubler-Gmelin, in DIE TAGESZEITUNG of 2 May, forcefully 
advocated making the denial and minimization of the Holocaust 
punishable under law: "No, this concerns us all. Here it is 
essential, also by means of precisely targeted penal code 
prohibitions, to set limits which underline and safeguard the 
sociopolitical proscription of such conduct." DIE TAGESZEITUNG 
of 29 April reported that both the SPD and Alliance 90/Greens 
have introduced draft laws in the Bundestag that would 
criminalize the "Auschwitz lie."

  [Text] Paris, May 23 (AFP) -- Bosnian President Alija 
Izetbegovic vowed Sunday [22 May] to negotiate and, if 
necessary, fight to preserve the territorial integrity of Bosnia. 
  Izetbegovic arrived here on Sunday night from Saudi Arabia 
as 
guest of French intellectual Bernard-Henri Levy, who is 
campaigning for a lifting of the arms embargo against the 
mainly-Moslem government forces and recently released "Bosnia," 
a film about the war in Bosnia-Hercegovina. 
  Izetbegovic complained that the intervention of the 
international community in his country had been "negative" and 
had left the Moslems with their "hands tied." He said he would 
continue to strive to have the arms embargo lifted. 
  "If our conditions are not met and if the arms embargo is 
not 
lifted, we will go on fighting," he told journalists. 
  The French Government has opposed lifting the embargo, 
saying 
it could precipitate the "crushing" of the Moslem forces or lead 
to a long-drawn out war. 
  Izetbegovic, who returns home Monday, told compatriots who 
came to applaud him on his arrival that the Serbs "will never 
kill as many Bosnians as we will have children." 
  Referring to a tour he made of territory under Bosnian army 
control, Izetbegovic said government forces were making 
progress. "We will fight or die," he said. 
  Levy, who has denounced Europe's failure to counter militant 
"Serb nationalism," is considering launching a "Sarajevo" list 
of candidates in the European elections next month. 
  The list, called "Europe Begins in Sarajevo," would be 
headed 
by cancer specialist Leon Schwartzenberg.

<F P=106> [Interview with Health Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy </F>
following his visit to Rwandan border areas in Burundi and 
Tanzania by Claire Chazal in Paris -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Chazal] Health Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy 
has just returned from the refugee camps in the Rwandan border 
area [passage omitted]. Mr. Douste-Blazy, you're just back from 
the region; you came back just an hour ago. Can you give us the 
latest on the situation -- how many injured, how many refugees? 
  [Douste-Blazy] I would like to say first of all: Stop the 
massacre -- and especially let us prevent the massacres of 
tomorrow. It is both terrifying and terrible. It is terrible, 
because it is, I think, the greatest genocide of the end of the 
20th century: Between 200,000 and 500,000 people have been 
killed in two months; there are 2 million refugees. It is 
terrifying because it is a genocide. We are dealing with 
genocide: Not just the adults, but children are being killed. 
This morning, before I left, I heard a radio station in Rwanda 
saying: Let's not repeat the mistakes of 1959; let's not spare 
the children, let's kill them. 
  This is absolute horror. From a humanitarian point of view, 
it creates enormous problems. We have hundreds of thousands of 
refugees coming to Tanzania, to Burundi, to Zaire. The Ngara 
refugee camp [in Tanzania] where I was yesterday has some 
250,000 people. It is the largest refugee camp ever seen, with 
the attendant danger of epidemics. [passage omitted]. There is 
a lack of drinking water. We brought two large water purifying 
plants, which can process 125 cubic meters an hour, to save 
these people. The children are suffering from malnutrition, so 
we brought lots of energy bars, providing 2,000 calories a day. 
If we don't do something there will be a horrific carnage. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Chazal] Talking about the problem is one thing. What can we 
do to help the humanitarian organizations on the ground, and 
what can the UN force do? 
  [Douste-Blazy] On the humanitarian level, thanks to the 
Development Ministry and to Development Minister Michel Roussin, 
we have provided 200 tonnes of aid per air lift, and 300 more 
tonnes are on their way. We really have to support Doctors 
Without Borders, Doctors of the World, and International Action 
Against Hunger who are doing an incredible job. 
  On the political level, there has of course been the UN 
resolution. [Foreign Minister Alain] Juppe was one of the first 
to call for this resolution. We have to send 5,000 men, but 
those men will encounter an absolutely apocalyptic situation. 
  [Chazal] Will they be able to get to Rwanda in the first 
place? 
  [Douste-Blazy] They will, but I would like them, instead of 
being a buffer force, to be in the country in such a way as to 
prevent the massacres being committed by the militias. 
  [Chazal] Their mission for now is purely humanitarian. 
  [Douste-Blazy] Yes, but one can wonder what an unarmed 
soldier can do in a country like Rwanda. I think that before 
the spark becomes a fire, we have to anticipate developments. I 
want to send out a warning about neighboring Burundi. The same 
ingredients are all in place: There are Hutus and Tutsis, 
hundreds of thousands of refugees will arrive in the north of 
the country, and are threatening to destabilize the precarious 
balance there. Our role is also to prevent tomorrow's massacres. 
  I would also like to raise another question. UN observers 
are present. We know that there are countries neighboring 
Rwanda which are supplying arms. The Kalashnikovs are coming 
from somewhere. I think the observers have to tell us where the 
arms are coming from and when. 
  On Tuesday [24 May], the UN Commission for Human Rights will 
be meeting in Geneva. This is [UN High Commissioner for Human 
Rights] Mr. Ayala Lasso's first mission, and I think that we 
have to bang our fist on the table, because crimes against 
humanity are being committed in Rwanda. It is absolutely 
horrible, the international community has to say this aloud. 
  [Chazal] Is France prepared to send troops to support the UN 
force in Rwanda? 
  [Douste-Blazy] Yes, the prime minister has decided that 
France should be present. France is very active in the 
humanitarian field. France will of course be present with UN 
forces. 
  I would, however, like to say -- of course we have to go to 
Rwanda, we have taken anesthesiologists, emergency doctors, 
surgeons, we have to act in the humanitarian field -- but we 
must also prevent disasters in the political field, in 
particular in Burundi. This is my point of view. 
  [Chazal] We have the feeling that we could fall in a 
Bosnia-like trap, where the UN found itself almost impotent. 
  [Douste-Blazy] Absolutely. I think that the best thing for 
the UN is to arrive at the moment when they are accepted by both 
sides, and this is a way for the UN not to have to fight. The 
UN is there then -- but if we already have a fire here, an 
apocalyptic horror, then how can we ask the sides to respect 
each other if we go in without guns. 
  I think that today we are seeing the limits of the UN. For 
Rwanda, from a humanitarian point of view, these 5,500 men must 
arrive immediately to prevent further massacres, but they must 
especially go to the neighbors, to Zaire, Burundi, of course, 
and Tanzania. Otherwise, I think we will be seeing similar 
massacres there in a few months. 
  [Chazal] Thank you very much Mr. Douste-Blazy for giving us 
your impressions so soon after returning from Rwanda.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "A Deal Worth More Than 3 Billion </F>
Francs: The Sale of Three French Submarines to Pakistan 
Expected in June"] 
  [Text] France and Pakistan are now in the final phase of 
negotiations with respect to the delivery of three conventional 
submarines worth 3-3.5 billion francs. The two countries are 
still discussing the financial terms, which cover compensation 
and technology transfers to local industry. However, talks 
should be completed by June, barring any late trade 
counterattack by Sweden or Britain. Defense Minister Francois 
Leotard visited Islamabad in mid-January. 
  The deal pertains to the Agosta-90B submarines with a 
1,700-tonne displacement in submersion. This type of submarine 
has a conventional propulsion unit and is equipped with 
torpedoes as well as Exocet SM.39 antisurface missiles. The 
first ship will be built in Cherbourg by the Naval Construction 
Directorate (DCN); the other two will be assembled in Pakistan. 
  France is faced with strong competition from Sweden, whose 
submarines only carry torpedoes, and from the United Kingdom. 
The British recently made a new offer to Islamabad, which may 
make Pakistan defer its final choice. In addition to the 
missiles it carries, the Agosta-90B is well-suited for open-sea 
missions, an added advantage from the perspective of Pakistani 
Navy officials. 
  The Americans are not really party to the competition, as 
they are not sure whether they should maintain military trade 
ties with Pakistan as long as that country has not given formal 
assurances with regard to nuclear nonproliferation. This is why 
the delivery of F-16 aircraft is currently frozen, despite 
Islamabad's having made a down payment. 
  This American attitude is also explained by the fact that 
U.S. dockyards no longer build conventional submarines and that 
they often act as intermediaries for Germany, for which they 
assemble ships to be fitted with U.S.-made equipment. This is 
currently the case for Taiwan and Egypt, which have been trying 
to obtain submarines and which may purchase Sub-Harpoon missiles 
from the United States.

<F P=106> [Report by Olivier Provost: "Precision Missile -- </F>
Aerospatiale Lagging Behind Matra"] 
  [Text] Mention of its name already brings a smile to the 
lips in defense circles. Called APTGD, the French acronym for 
"long-distance precision weapon," this missile -- for so it is 
-- is, according to Defense Minister Francois Leotard, the only 
major new program in the 1995-2000 military planning law. Its 
estimated development cost is 1.65 billion French francs [Fr], 
of which Fr1.4 billion has been set aside for the period covered 
by the law. The total cost of the whole program should be at 
least Fr2 billion. Some 200 missiles will be required. 
  The aim of this APTGD -- with a range of 400 km and accurate 
to within one meter -- is to strike an enemy and destroy his 
headquarters, military bases and energy sources without having 
recourse to nuclear weapons and without harming the civilian 
population. In short, a kind of French cruise missile, but more 
modern than the American Tomahawk which had its moment of glory 
during the Gulf War. 
  The problem is choosing a company to manufacture the 
missile. 
While France has one manufacturer of combat aircraft, one tank 
producer, and one helicopter-maker, it has two missile 
companies, Aerospatiale and Matra. Each company has very 
different ideas for the APTGD: Aerospatiale is proposing a 
conventional (C) version of its ASMP medium-range air-to-ground 
nuclear missile. The development cost would be around Fr1 
billion, and Aerospatiale Missiles boss Jean-Louis Fache is 
proposing lowering this cost if his company is also given the 
contract for the ANNG new-generation antiship missile which 
would also use elements of the ASMP. In his view, the operation 
would make it possible to lower ASMP-C and ANNG development 
costs by a global 25 percent. The icing on the cake is that the 
ASMP missile is equipped with technology currently mastered only 
by France and Russia -- although U.S. and UK scientists are on 
the case -- namely the statoreactor. This superturbine means 
the missile can travel at supersonic speeds. Aerospatiale's 
reasoning is that even if the missile is detected it will then 
be too late to try and counter it. 
  Across the board from Aerospatiale is Matra, with its 
Super-Apache missile. Matra is the current favorite to win the 
contract and has the backing of current Chief of Staff Admiral 
Lanxade, Air Force Commander General Lanata, and the influential 
head of the General Arms Delegation, Henri Conze. The 
Super-Apache is derived from the original Apache antitrack 
missile and is a partial offshoot, since the planning law 
devotes Fr2.6 billion for the purchase of 137 Apaches, just 75 
of which are antitrack, the other 62 being the new 
anti-infrastructure missiles. As a result, the total order 
remains the same. Lengthened and equipped with a new warhead, 
the Super-Apache will cost a little more than Fr1 billion to 
develop, but the unit price of each missile will be lower than 
that for the ASMP-C. The special feature of the Super-Apache is 
its stealthiness (specially designed by Matra in a huge 
"anechoic" chamber), although it flies at subsonic speeds. This 
low speed must therefore be compensated by radar invisibility. 
Moreover, according to the defense minister, it will be "more 
flexible to use and even more precise since it will be 
adjustable" in flight, unlike its competitor. 
  Even Aerospatiale chiefs realize that they have only a one 
in 
three chance of wresting the contract away from Matra. As a 
result, Aerospatiale managing director Louis Gallois made the 
sibylline statement: "It is likely that Aerospatiale and Matra 
will both have a stake in this missile. The distribution 
already exists for the Apache. If the choice revolves around a 
supersonic statoreactor program, Matra will doubtless want to 
participate. Then the question of a redistribution will be 
raised." Thus, his company seems to be sending a clear message 
to Matra, perhaps offering a share of the precious ASMP 
statoreactor technology. Noel Forgeard, head of Matra Defense 
Espace, could be tempted by this offer. He has no such worries, 
however. If the Super-Apache wins the day, the industrial 
distribution of tasks that exist for the Apache will guide the 
program: Matra will be prime contractor with 12 percent of the 
contract, while the other 88 percent will go to industrial 
subcontractors, split 50-50 between Aerospatiale and Matra -- 
the final share-out will thus be 44 percent and 56 percent 
respectively. 
  However, the ASNP-C cannot be counted out yet. First, its 
detractors could be called on to fill new positions. Second, 
the Americans and the British, with their Casom missile, are 
starting to reflect on the future of their cruise missiles and 
are wondering whether it might be time to make the switch to 
supersonic missiles.

<F P=106> [Article by Olivier Provost: "Does It Cost Too Much To </F>
Defend France?"] 
  [Text] Less money for guns, and more for weapons to fight 
AIDS: That was the phrase sung during an anti-AIDS television 
event in response to the money which France spends on defense. 
Apart from that, a terse statement from the Ecology Generation 
wondered about, among other things, "the government's indulgence 
of the arms industry's pressure groups." Setting aside these 
discordant notes, public opinion did not react to the 613.118 
billion current francs [Fr], which represent Fr658 billion in 
constant francs based on an annual inflation rate of 2 percent, 
provided for in the military programming law covering the 
1995-2000 period. That is half of France's total annual budget. 
  Should one conclude from this that the French are losing 
interest in the issue and that, above certain amounts (the Fr20 
billion for the recapitalization of Air France seemed to strike 
home a lot more), we are wandering out in the realm of the 
abstract? Or does it mean, as some optimistic elected 
representatives allege, that as a result of the Bosnian and 
Somalian interventions, the French understand completely the 
importance of having an optimal national defense and 
intervention capacity? The elected representatives hardly 
reacted either. Next Tuesday [24 May] evening, and probably 
Wednesday too, they are supposed to debate the text. This 
presentation is to be preceded by a speech by Prime Minister 
Edouard Balladur. The vote itself, as is the case with 
important texts, will not take place until a week later. 
However, the outcome is already known. It will be positive. 
  The military planning law could even be marked by the seal 
of 
consensus. The RPR [Rally for the Republic] -- except for a few 
grumblers like Jacques Baumel -- and the UDF [French Democratic 
Union] will obviously vote in favor. The Communists will vote 
against, as is traditional. The Socialists will vote "yes" 
under pressure from President Francois Mitterrand, who will let 
it be understood that he is the main instigator behind the text 
which he supposedly managed to get "accepted" by the government. 
  The 1995-2000 military planning law should therefore be 
widely adopted, but not necessarily applied, because it has no 
legitimacy in terms of substance. At Bercy [Finance Ministry], 
they always have trouble getting used to the idea that the 
government and the elected representatives are going to commit 
themselves to spending over a period of six years. 
  Budget experts are "completely prepared to take with one 
hand 
what was given with the other," one deputy commented. It was 
with some reluctance that the Finance Ministry agreed to an 
annual increase of .5 percent in defense spending -- and even, 
beginning in 1998, of 1.5 percent if the economic recovery and 
the cost reductions for arms programs materialize -- while the 
law on controlling spending calls for each ministry to receive 
.5 percent less per year. However, Budget Minister Nicolas 
Sarkozy indeed realized that, since Balladur's arrival at the 
Matignon [office of the prime minister], the prime minister has 
favored [Defense Minister] Francois Leotard with each volley 
between the Finance and the Defense ministries. This is a 
political choice since Defense was favored in the prime 
minister's first speech on general policy. It is also a 
politician's choice: His defense minister is also the honorary 
president of the Republican Party, which is the UDF's strike 
force, and a source of hoped-for support in the 1995 
presidential elections, even if it means promising "Leo" the 
prime ministership and painting a glowing picture of support 
for the presidential elections in 2002. 
  The 1993 interim budget, the 1994 budget, the financing of 
external operations: The Finance Ministry had to defer to the 
Defense Ministry, but is not losing anything by waiting. In the 
past, the moral validity alone of a programming law did never 
withstand annual budget cuts. According to Francois Leotard, 
the difference would only be 4.9 percent, but this calculation 
is based on the initial finance law. According to a calculation 
currently being made in Parliament, after the budget audit, the 
gap would reach 20 to 25 percent. The elected representatives 
regret seeing their vote in favor of a programming law scorned 
by these little cuts based on the principle of the "Huron 
curve." That is the name for the financial mechanism whose 
program authorization curve starts at a very high level, but 
which is systematically being eroded at the lower levels 
representing payment credits, or the money that is actually 
allocated. 
  Despite everything, in the year 2000, France will have the 
most modern fighter aircraft in the world, the Rafale; a 
missile-launching nuclear submarine which can rival those made 
by Russia and the United States; a nuclear propulsion aircraft 
carrier in a class that only Washington has; an armored division 
of Leclerc combat tanks, the newest in Europe; and helicopters, 
satellites, missiles. Everything will be new and high-tech. Is 
this a stroke of genius or a stroke of madness? It is, first of 
all, a sort of "concatenation" logic. The kind that, in the 
eighties, first under the Right and then under the Left, made 
France simultaneously launch a renewal of all its major armament 
programs. Total cost: Fr700 billion! 
  Not to mention the fact that at the same time we had to 
continue equipping our troops with the existing equipment, which 
is not included in the total. By the early nineties, it was too 
late to stop these major programs. The industrial and social 
risk had become too great. Squaring the circle meant keeping 
the programs while making savings. The 1995-2000 programming 
law tried this tack by encouraging the manufacture of equipment, 
by counting on cost reductions of 2 percent, and by postponing 
or staggering future programs, since there could be no question 
of rewriting the "concatenation" logic. Why 2-percent cost 
reductions? Quite simply because there were those among 
Francois Leotard's staff who thought they could "fit things in" 
over the six-year period with an annual growth of 2.5 percent. 
However, such a growth rate is inconceivable at a time when the 
Matignon is asking all its ministers to economize. The 
.5-percent increase was only won after applying a lot of 
pressure that irritated more than just one person at the 
Matignon. Two percent was still needed to make the operation 
succeed, hence the objective of productivity gains. 
  The worst thing is that all this is just not enough. So far, 
bearing in mind the Fr700 billion that has to be found, the 
various governments have always "passed the bucket." Preceding 
programming laws definitely provided for a slight progression, 
but they did not show the necessary and substantial increases in 
spending to finance the actual project cost in the subsequent 
years (up 5 percent, up 10 percent, up 12 percent). This is a 
time bomb left behind; and one which the planning law for 
1995-2000 has not completely defused. 
  In six years, France will therefore have top quality arms. 
There are plenty of geopolitical reasons for this: The 
celebrated "peace dividends," mentioned by Laurent Fabius 
following the fall of the Berlin Wall, have given way to a great 
many fears. Is France at risk of one day being hit by a nuclear 
missile from Ukraine? From Belarus? A SCUD from Algeria? A 
chemical bomb from the Balkans? Not to mention the threat of 
terrorism, nuclear proliferation, etc. 
  The white paper, which was drawn up just before the 
programming law, reviews all possible crises. France must 
therefore combine maintaining its deterrent force with 
developing its capacity to project its forces via helicopters, 
future troop transport aircraft, landing craft, and even Cruise 
missiles. It is a sort of compromise between Desert Storm and 
the Cold War, an attempt to, at a price, maintain the armaments 
industry with its 230,000 employees throughout France and its 
technological skills, which are often the best in Europe. 
  However, the main reason for these Fr613 billion over six 
years may lie elsewhere. France has a seat on the Security 
Council and is fighting to get its voice heard everywhere in the 
worldwide diplomatic chorus, starting in Bosnia, where it has 
more soldiers than other nations, to Cambodia. "It is not the 
Quai d'Orsay [Foreign Ministry] that allows France to keep this 
place," an RPR senator said with regard to these strategic 
questions, "it is the weight of its Army, its capacity, 
independent of the United States, to intervene militarily. 
Without its Armed Forces, France would be relegated to the rank 
of second-class nation." So Paris has every reason in the world 
to put more than Fr600 billion into this programming law: 
political consensus, disinterest -- but not hostility -- from 
public opinion, a geostrategic key, the industrial and social 
imperative, and technological necessity. 
  This will remain true until the next annual budget debate. 
Even in the government, they will then realize that one Leclerc 
tank costs Fr30 million, one fully equipped Rafale fighter plane 
Fr588 million, and a nuclear aircraft carrier Fr17 billion. How 
many schools, kilometers of freeway, or how much AIDS research 
could all that buy? Questions of choice and priority, or even 
of demagogy will inevitably arise throughout the six years 
covered by the programming law.

<F P=106> [Interview with EU Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan by Luis </F>
Tiberio in Portugal; date not given: "To Change the Criteria for 
Convergence Would Be Premature and Dangerous"] 
  [Excerpts] For the media in general, the evidence is 
undeniable: Leon Brittan is in the race for the presidency of 
the European Commission, some 13 years after he joined the 
British Government as Margaret Thatchers's chief secretary to 
the treasury, "at the request of Geoffrey Howe," chancellor of 
the exchequer, as "Maggie" relates in her memoirs. [passage 
omitted] 
  Last year Brittan won the post for foreign economic 
relations 
of the European Union [EU]. He came into the limelight as the 
EU's chief negotiator in the Uruguay Round of the GATT. Now the 
hour has arrived to run as successor to Delors. 
  In an interview with EXPRESSO, Brittan conducts his 
campaign, 
but does not proclaim it.... Attempting to overcome resistance 
to the fact that he is British, he tries to dispel the image of 
a faithful "Thatcherite" and to distance himself from the 
positions of the Major government. 
  For now, he succeeds in being seen as London's most 
European-minded possibility. Otherwise, he would not be 
defending the role of the Commission, the criteria for 
convergence, and the single currency. 
  [Tiberio] So you are campaigning for the presidency of the 
European Commission.... 
  [Brittan] (laughing) No, I am not campaigning. The truth is 
that my name was mentioned in the context of the presidency. And 
I believe in openness and clarity. For this reason, for those 
who would like to know my opinions, I am more than pleased to 
explain them. 
  [Tiberio] If you are not campaigning, what brings you to 
Portugal? 
  [Brittan] The Uruguay Round of the GATT is of enormous 
importance to Portugal. I was with the Portuguese prime minister 
in October, hence before I had completed the negotiations of the 
Uruguay Round. Now I want to inform him of the results. There is 
no mystery. I am aware that people will ask me questions about 
the presidency and I am prepared to answer them. But this is not 
an election campaign. 
  [Tiberio] I do not say it is an election campaign, because 
there has never been a formal campaign for the presidency of the 
Commission. But no one believes that it would be a sacrifice for 
you. 
  [Brittan] A sacrifice? Clearly not. I mean, it is a 
difficult 
job, but I have been on the Commission for five years, first in 
the post for competitiveness and now that of foreign economic 
relations of the EU. So, either we feel bored and tired (and I 
do not feel this way) or we are ready for new tasks that people 
wish us to perform. Hence it is natural that we explain our 
points of view. 
  [Tiberio] But this means competing for a post that, in your 
country, is categorized as a "civil servant." 
  [Brittan] They may call it what they like. The fact is that 
it is necessary to have a Commission that will guarantee a fair 
balance between the interests of the Community as a whole -- 
particularly of the small member states, because the Commission 
is the guardian of the rights of the small countries and the 
vanguard of the policies of cohesion -- and excessive 
bureaucracy. We have to achieve a balance between moving forward 
too far and too fast and not moving forward at all. 
  [Tiberio] Then the Commission is an ally of the small 
countries? 
  [Brittan] Without the Commission, there would be no cohesion 
policies and there would be too many conflicts of interest. When 
I was responsible for competitiveness, I had to seek limits to 
government subsidies in the richer countries -- for the benefit 
of countries like Portugal. It is a tremendous mistake to think 
that an efficient Commission is a danger to small countries like 
Portugal. But, at the same time, the lesson of Maastricht that 
we must learn is that people are concerned about too much 
bureaucracy. We must explain, and explain clearly, what we are 
doing. As it happens, I was the one on the Commission who 
suggested the principle of subsidization, which was accepted and 
which is now in the treaty. We must give guarantees to people 
for them to accept what we are doing. But this is why we must 
offer explanations. 
  [Tiberio] It appears to be a statement of principles or a 
program. And it is precisely this week -- when you have almost 
finished your "tour" of the capitals of the Twelve (only the 
Paris-Bonn axis was left for later) -- that your book 
Europe: The Europe We Need is coming out. Does what 
has already been said constitute "your" concept of the Europe we 
need? 
  [Brittan] Well, if it were a simple message, it would not 
have been necessary to write 320 pages. My message is that we 
must address the problems of Maastricht with more clarity, more 
democratically, and with more subsidization. Except that, at the 
same time, we must go forward with what the Twelve have 
undertaken, such as the Economic and Monetary Union [EMU], in 
which, I hope, Portugal will participate -- and your prime 
minister is quite interested in this. We have to find a way to 
do this within the framework of change resulting from the 
alterations to the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) of the European 
Monetary System (EMS). But we must also develop a policy that 
benefits the Europe of the citizens -- a concept that I call 
"stewardship." 
  We have to make our industry more competitive and I have a 
program to do this. And we must be open to the outside world 
(both in foreign policy and commercial terms) and, at the same 
time, be strong enough to protect our interests. And we have to 
have a balance: We will not turn only toward the north and east, 
but we will have an effective policy in relation to the south. 
  [Tiberio] Let us return to the EMU. You have already 
publicly 
advocated convergence for the EMU, but without the need to go 
back to the narrow band of the ERM. Would the criteria for 
convergence be altered? 
  [Brittan] No, no. The criteria must be maintained, because I 
feel they exercise a salutary pressure for economic change in 
all the countries of Europe and this will be to the benefit of 
these countries. For example, Portugal benefited from the 
criteria for convergence. It was not easy. It required courage 
on the government's part, but the Portuguese economy would be 
worse off without the criteria. 
  It is clear, however, that these are not mathematical 
criteria to be applied in the strictest sense. When the time 
comes, we will have to look not only at the grid and the 
position on the grid, but also at the trajectory. 
  In any event, I feel that, for the time being, the criteria 
should not be changed. They may be extremely unpopular, but they 
are very beneficial. To change them would be premature, 
dangerous, and ill-advised. 
  [Tiberio] Even though you are presumably in favor of free 
exchange, you also support a single currency. 
  [Brittan] Yes. I have been in favor of a single currency for 
many years. There are at least two disadvantages to not having a 
single currency. The exchanges are costly for private 
individuals and in international negotiations (bilateral or 
multilateral), companies are too vulnerable and dependent on the 
exchange rates. 
  [Tiberio] But do you go along with the intransigent 
positions 
of the United Kingdom and Spain in the "guerrilla action" 
regarding the number of votes necessary for a group of countries 
to form the so-called minority blockade? 
  [Brittan] The positions are not the same. I think that we 
are 
making great progress in the negotiations for expansion to the 
Scandinavians and to Austria, and now there is a persisting 
problem with the right to vote, for which a compromise has been 
presented. I myself, on Monday [28 March] morning, publicly (on 
the BBC) urged my country to accept this compromise. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Tiberio] You called the GATT agreement "the greatest 
liberalization ever carried out." But on the verge of the formal 
signing of the accord, there are those (such as France, Italy, 
Canada, and Greece) who are advocating the introduction of a 
"social clause" to restrict child labor and forced labor by 
prisoners. As chief negotiator of the EU, are you in agreement? 
  [Brittan] This will not be included in the GATT accord, but 
will be discussed only on the next "round" of trade 
negotiations. Everyone accepts that it is not an issue of 
including the matter in the accord, but of putting it on the 
agenda for the future. And the EU will fight for this two weeks 
from now in Marrakech. 
  [Tiberio] You stated that to have left the audiovisual 
[category] out of the GATT accord made the Twelve more 
vulnerable to retaliatory measures by the United States. Do you 
in fact fear the most "notorious" of the U.S. retaliatory 
measures, the "Super 301" clause, or is it the case that -- as 
someone has already said -- "`the Super 301' is 20 percent 
economic and 80 percent political?" 
  [Brittan] No, I am not afraid of it. As a result of the GATT 
agreement, we have limited its possible effects. And Mickey 
Kantor (the U.S. chief negotiator) has personally assured me 
that he accepts that the "Super 301" may not be applied in any 
way contrary to the present or future rules of the GATT. 
  And since the future rules of the GATT will be quite 
restrictive, the Americans will not be able to use it against 
Europe in any dangerous way. 
  [Tiberio] But they continue to use it against other GATT 
signatories, as was the case now with Japan. 
  [Brittan] Well, the Japanese must look out for themselves. 
But even in relation to Japan, they [the Americans] are limited 
by the new GATT rules. 
  [Tiberio] The GATT negotiations earned you harsh attacks 
"within" Europe, especially from the French. Marie France Garaud 
(former adviser to the French Government for the GATT) accused 
you of "behaving like a Trojan horse" and Alain Juppe, French 
minister of foreign affairs, went so far as to call you a 
"traitor." 
  [Brittan] (laughter) If you were to ask Mr. Juppe what he 
thinks of me, I do not think he would speak this way any longer. 
  [Tiberio] On 13 December, Portugal stressed its reservations 
regarding the GATT accord and Minister Durao Barroso stated: "As 
it stands, the accord is unacceptable." Your response was: "I 
would prefer not to comment." 
  [Brittan] By 15 December, it was already acceptable. Well, 
there is no mystery. Portugal had a problem, and we were able to 
solve it. An agreement was reached, and Portugal was a party to 
the unanimous vote. 
  [Tiberio] Precisely because it was "unacceptable" on 13 
December and "acceptable" on 15 December, many people said that 
Portugal had "sold out" its textile sector for 400 million 
ECU's.... 
  [Brittan] The accusation is extremely unjust. Portugal 
fought 
hard in defense of its textile industry and, incidentally, as a 
result of Portuguese pressure, we managed to achieve a change in 
the Uruguay Round. Above all, we succeeded in winning more 
concessions from the North Americans, because I repeatedly 
insisted on Portugal's needs. 
  In the second place, on the very last day, in Geneva, we 
managed to arrive at a statement affirming that we will not go 
ahead with the dismantling of the Multifiber Accord if the 
developing countries do not meet their obligations both 
regarding the rules and regarding the opening of their markets. 
  Moreover, Portugal brought up the problems in its industry 
and the Union responded very positively, with a new financial 
instrument to assist the industry. In short, I think Portugal 
fought hard and quite successfully for the textile industry and 
the Commission and the Council responded very positively. The 
final result was a victory for the Portuguese Government. 
  [Tiberio] The EU representative to the GATT has changed: 
Paul 
Tran van Tinh was replaced by Jean-Pierre Leng, who has been in 
Tokyo until now. 
  [Brittan] Both men are highly professional civil servants, 
truly public servants in this case. I think Jean-Pierre Leng 
will do excellent work; incidentally, we chose him because of 
his performance in Japan. And he will be, I am certain, an 
effective defender of EU interests in Geneva. 
  [Tiberio] There was another change, earlier. Arthur Dunkel 
was relieved by Peter Sutherland as director general of the GATT. 
  [Brittan] I would not like to make comparisons. But Dunkel 
struggled hard for many years, bringing the Uruguay round to 
"near conclusion." Sutherland provided the final impetus. Now 
that we have an accord, no more need be said. 
  [Tiberio] When Clinton chose him, Mickey Kantor was 
denigrated by trade experts. They "accused" him of not having a 
trade background and of being simply a skilled lawyer connected 
with the film industry in Los Angeles. What is your image now of 
your great adversary in the GATT? 
  [Brittan] I found him an energetic counterpart who fought 
hard for the interests of the United States, but who was 
concerned with reaching an accord. And he was capable of making 
the necessary compromises. We fought hard, but we achieved an 
accord. 
  [Tiberio] You two have something in common besides being 
jurists; you are both of Lithuanian descent. 
  [Brittan] Yes, but I don't believe that it was a great help. 
In both cases, the lineage is so remote as to be much more a 
part of family history than an important factor in the 
negotiations. 
  [Tiberio] Curiously, you share the same roots with Yehudi 
Menuhin, who had extravagant praise for your musical learning. 
  [Brittan] It was extremely kind of him. And, I must say, it 
is always more flattering to be praised by someone from the 
world of art than by a politician. [passage omitted] 
  [Tiberio] Let us move to the European Commission. Jacques 
Delors.... 
  [Brittan] There is no doubt. Jacques Delors greatly advanced 
the development of Europe. And he also greatly strengthened the 
status of the Commission. Without a doubt. 
  [Tiberio] And potential successors, such as Ruud Lubbers.... 
  [Brittan] He is prime minister of the Netherlands, and 
highly 
successful. 
  [Tiberio] Yes, but can he be as successful as president of 
the Commission? 
  [Brittan] This question is entirely up to the chiefs of 
state 
and government to decide. 
  [Tiberio] Felipe Gonzalez.... 
  [Brittan] It is the same question. I am not going to give 
grades to all the chiefs of government. But it is obvious that 
Gonzalez is a prime minister who is highly respected in Spain. 
  [Tiberio] You will end by saying precisely the same thing 
about all the chiefs of government. 
  [Brittan] Not all of them. I would not say the same, for 
example, about Colonel al-Qadhdhafi. (Laughter) Obviously it is 
not the place of a member of the Commission to say one prime 
minister is good and another one is bad. 
  [Tiberio] But there are potential candidates to succeed 
Delors who are not chiefs of government. For example, a former 
commissioner such as Peter Sutherland. 
  [Brittan] I was partly responsible, with Mickey Kantor, for 
recommending (first to the Community countries and then to the 
rest of the world) that Sutherland be appointed director general 
of the GATT. And he has met my expectations fully. 
  [Tiberio] Finally, a completely different figure. Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy.... 
  [Brittan] I do not think the danger lies in Zhirinovskiy, 
because he is too ridiculous to be dangerous. The real danger 
would be someone who espouses Zhirinovskiy's principles, but in 
a more temperate and credible manner.

<F P=106> [Merce Beltran report: "Serra Asserts That Aznar Is </F>
Unworthy To Be Prime Minister"] 
  [Excerpt] Barcelona -- [Deputy Prime Minister] Narcis 
Serra asserted yesterday that [People's Party Chairman] Jose 
Maria Aznar "is not a person worthy of the prime ministership," 
in a tough indictment of the People's Party [PP], a force that, 
in his opinion, "lacks the most elementary ethics" and commits 
"acts of political effrontery" such as using "statements by 
somebody who has fled justice that have been denied," referring 
to the assertions by [former Civil Guard Director General] Luis 
Roldan, in which he accused the deputy prime minister of 
ordering him to conduct an investigation into Mario Conde. 
  Narcis Serra made these remarks at the presentation of the 
Socialist Party of Catalonia (PSC) candidates for the European 
Parliament. Criticisms of the People's Party, an absence of 
references to Convergence and Union, and the Socialists' firm 
commitment to the struggle against corruption dominated most of 
the speeches. The deputy prime minister began his address with 
optimistic remarks about the economic situation. "We are 
emerging from the tunnel of the crisis. The economy is 
reviving, we are correcting our shortcomings, and new jobs are 
being created thanks to the labor reform." 
  In his opinion, "much remains to be done," because emerging 
from the crisis "requires more effort today," and so he 
advocated a new "social, trade union, and business culture. And 
it will be our involvement in Europe that will help us make this 
change of outlook a reality, provided that Europe is guided by a 
project of progress that will bar the way to the right." 
  The Socialist leader warned that all the progress achieved 
"is in danger. The gravest threat to Spain's progress is the 
policy of the PP and Jose Maria Aznar, and this would be the 
case if they were in power, because they have no policy." He 
added that "the opposition's gravest threat is its sectarianism; 
wishing to attain power without taking the results of the polls 
into account. Their sectarianism even prevents them from 
acknowledging the effort that Spanish society is making." 
  He reiterated the Socialists' pledge to combat corruption: 
"We will continue to the bitter end, whoever may fall." Serra 
stressed that the Socialists have a great deal at stake in this 
battle, "and so does society, because the democratic system's 
credibility could be at issue unless drastic action is taken, 
but it will be very difficult to ease the tension in political 
life as long as the PP is there." He pointed out differences 
from the PP in explaining that "we are different. Our voters 
are more demanding, and we have a higher idea of the political 
action that we put into practice. We will relinquish government 
responsibility when citizens so wish at the polls." 
  In the deputy prime minister's opinion, the PP's own 
strategy 
"helps us surmount the situation. People know that the 
implementation of the PP's policy would be very bad for 
political stability. It has no arguments and has a lack of 
elementary ethics. They demand everything except respecting the 
results of the polls. They wish to turn what is their problem 
into everybody's problem." In his opinion, the PP's problem is 
the censure motion. "It does not submit one because the PP 
stands alone, in the solitude of those who persist in error; of 
those who for a handful of votes are capable of stirring up a 
language war in Catalonia; in the solitude of those who would 
like to place in the prime ministership a person who is unworthy 
of it. This is the real reason why they do not submit a censure 
motion -- not the parliamentary arithmetic." 
  He added another reason to these arguments: "When a censure 
motion is submitted, an alternative government program must be 
presented, and they have none. Aznar would have to confront 
Gonzalez, and he cannot win that battle. The Spanish people 
will never be able to trust somebody who, in an act of real 
political effrontery, used statements by somebody who has fled 
justice that have been denied. Nobody will ever trust those 
ethics." 
  Serra concluded with references to Europe, expressing his 
conviction that the Socialists will win the elections because 
"Europe has always seemed very distant to the PP; they do not 
believe in the social Europe, they are a danger to the 
structural funds, and their European partners defend interests 
detrimental to us." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Manuel Estape report: "Camdessus Does Not Believe That </F>
Atmosphere of Corruption Will Affect Economic Recovery in Spain"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- IMF Director General Michel Camdessus 
believes that the atmosphere of corruption experienced in Spain 
will not affect economic recovery and acknowledges that the 
institution he heads was overly pessimistic in forecasting a 
1-percent growth rate for the Spanish economy this year. "Growth 
could be a little higher," he stated at a news conference with 
which he yesterday concluded a two-day visit to Spain, during 
which he met with the king, the prime minister, the economy 
minister, and representatives of the financial and academic 
communities. 
  Camdessus believes that the phenomena and the turmoil 
created 
by the atmosphere of corruption "cannot delay investment 
decisions amply justified by the macroeconomic prospects and the 
growth potential" of the Spanish economy. The IMF chief 
concludes from the contacts held over the past two days that 
"there are already some initial figures that clearly point to an 
economic recovery, such as the value-added tax revenue and the 
performance of the balance of trade and the housing market." In 
addition, at his meetings with Spanish bankers, he was informed 
of the existence of "signs" of a revival of investment, which 
would thus become "the second driving force of growth, giving 
way later," he added, "to a recovery in domestic consumption," 
the variable that has fallen furthest during the recession, 
owing to the "2-percent" increase in the family savings rate 
because of the fear of unemployment. 
  The IMF director general yesterday sought to make quite 
clear 
his support for the government's economic policy, a policy that 
should extend and accelerate the structural reforms. "It is 
very satisfactory that, despite the recession, the Spanish 
Government has undertaken a crucial dual initiative to restore 
sustained and job-creating growth -- the reduction of the public 
deficit and the far-reaching measures to make the labor market 
more flexible." Michel Camdessus emphasized that the "budget 
deficit in the first quarter was well below" that of a year ago. 
  In his opinion, "the government has decided to do many 
important things; it must now implement them, and quickly," and 
so he expressed his "joy" at the "good prospects" of the reform 
of the labor market being approved in the Cortes. The IMF, he 
pointed out, "supports what the government is trying to do" with 
the labor reform, and "there are already promising results 
concerning the introduction of some measures," he said, 
referring to the apprenticeship contract, stressing that "this 
is the direction that must be taken if people want this country 
to reduce its high unemployment rate through growth and labor 
flexibility." 
  He warned, however, that further steps should be taken in 
order to ensure that "the small and medium-sized enterprises are 
not afraid to recruit." It will be necessary "to continue to 
reduce the obstacles to finalizing labor contracts, continue to 
cut labor costs, improve vocational training, and increase the 
quality of the job supply, because this country must create 
skilled jobs and can do so, although it will take time." 
Camdessus regretted not "having been able to reach agreement 
with the trade unions" in the course of his "brief" visit, and 
expressed his intention to meet with them "before the October 
meeting in Madrid." 
  The most critical assessment that Camdessus made concerning 
the Spanish economy's performance was in taking the view that 
keeping inflation between 4 and 5 percent -- a level that is 
"certainly too high" -- will force the Bank of Spain to cut 
interest rates cautiously. Control over inflation and the 
public deficit will make it possible in the long term to ensure 
sustained growth with lower interest rates. 
  Michel Camdessus would not answer in specific terms a 
question on whether the conduct of the former Bank of Spain 
governor and the former Civil Guard director general invalidates 
one of his "prescriptions" against corruption -- improving 
officials' training and pay. "I will not talk about specific 
cases until justice has been done, because the presumption of 
innocence applies to everybody." The IMF official emphasized 
that "corruption is a universal scourge," and pointed out that 
"where it is not known, it is hidden under some form of 
totalitarianism." The important thing "in Spain, on the other 
side of the Pyrenees, and in any developed country" is that 
corruption be prosecuted, that there be strong and democratic 
institutions, and that "some trees" be prevented "from hiding 
the quality and the high sense of public service existing in the 
Spanish administration."

  [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis has said explicitly that 
he will not agree to discuss any changes to the 21 March UN 
document on the confidence-building measures. He said: I have 
accepted this document. Either Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf 
Denktas accepts it too, or we don't play anymore. Kliridhis 
clarified that he has not been informed that the United Nations 
has accepted any changes to the UN document, as reported by the 
Turkish Cypriot press. 
  The president was speaking this afternoon after meeting AKEL 
[Restorative Party of the Working People] Secretary General 
Dhimitrios Khristofias, in his series of meetings to brief the 
political leaders before the National Council convenes. 
Kliridhis said if measures are taken to make the Turkish side 
show willingness for a solution, then the substance of the 
Cyprus issue will be discussed. 
  Khristofias said he and Kliridhis agreed that after the 
failure of the talks on the confidence-building measures the 
process must return to the substance of the Cyprus issue, but on 
the condition that Denktas and Ankara are forced to abandon 
their intransigent stance. He added that the UN Security 
Council must make decisions about drastic measures to bend 
Turkish intransigence, but expressed reservations about this 
possibility.

  [Text] The Cypriot Government launched a protest today with 
the United Nations and sought explanations for the delay in the 
submission of the UN secretary general's report. Government 
Spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis stated that it is no longer 
certain that the UN secretary general's report will be 
circulated today or tomorrow, as expected. 
  The protest was made by Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis 
to Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's deputy special 
representative in Cyprus. The foreign minister also asked the 
UN official to explain whether Turkish press reports that the 
United Nations submitted a series of proposals to the Turkish 
Cypriot side during the deliberations in Vienna are true. The 
proposals reportedly satisfy many of the Turkish demands on 
implementing the confidence-building measures. 
  Specifically, the Turkish press reports note that the United 
Nations and Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department special 
coordinator on Cyprus, made the following proposals to the 
Turkish side: First, two separate customs departments should be 
established; second, there should be an equal number of flights 
for the two sides from the Nicosia Airport; third, the Greek 
Cypriots' access to Famagusta will be monitored by Turkish 
Cypriot policemen in civilian clothes; and fourth, within one 
year, before the operation of the Nicosia Airport, France, 
Germany, Canada, and Australia will accept the entry of Turkish 
Cypriot citizens using Turkish Cypriot passports. The press 
reports also note that Feissel accepted that access to Famagusta 
will be controlled by the Turkish side. 
  Kasoulidhis repeated that the confidence-building measures 
process has ended, and that a Cyprus solution be promoted only 
through alternative methods. He also said that if the submission 
of the UN secretary general's report is delayed beyond Tuesday 
[24 May], it would mean that the actions of the pseudostate in 
convening the so-called council of ministers and the pseudostate 
itself receive consideration. The spokesman stressed that the 
21 March document clearly refers to all the issues. He added 
that the elements noted in the Turkish Cypriot press are new.

  [Text] Strong elements of the Greek Government have drawn 
up an action plan for disengagement from the so-called 
confidence-building measures in case the United Nations insists 
on continuing to try to implement them despite the continuing 
negative stance of the Turkish side. 
  According to our information from an extremely well-informed 
and reliable source in Athens, the Greek Government expects to 
see attempts to implement the collapse of the 
confidence-building measures. However, if the United Nations, 
the British, and Americans promote alternative scenarios to 
implement the confidence-building measures, the Greek side will 
move to disavow them. 
  According to our information, Greece has already drawn up a 
specific action plan to disengage from the confidence-building 
measures that will be implemented in coordination with the 
Cyprus Government. 
  It should be noted that the U.S. President knows about the 
Greek Government's objections to and reservations about the 
confidence-building measures, and was informed by Greek Prime 
Minister Andreas Papandreou of his intentions in this regard 
during their meeting last month in Washington. 
  According to our information from Athens, during the last 
few 
days the Greek Government has informed President Glavkos 
Kliridhis that it wants to see the confidence-building measures 
collapse, and that it intends to work to formulate a new policy 
on the Cyprus issue with a new orientation. 
  In Athens we also learned that the Greek Government will 
proceed with the establishment of a National Security Council, 
which will take over the formulation of policy and strategy on 
the Cyprus issue. A representative of the Cyprus Government 
might participate in the proposed National Security Council in 
order to have firm cooperation between Athens and Nicosia at the 
policy level. 
  In view of this, it is understood that the Greek Government 
does not favor the convening of a pannational conference on the 
Cyprus issue, at least for the now.

  [Excerpt] President Glavkos Kliridhis met British Deputy 
Foreign Secretary Tom Richardson in the Presidential Palace this 
morning. Speaking afterward, Richardson said the current 
process in the Cyprus issue has reached a decisive point. He 
expressed the hope that there would be an agreement on the 
confidence-building measures before the UN secretary general 
submits his report to the Security Council. After the report is 
submitted, he said, we can evaluate the direction that should be 
followed. 
  Richardson said that in a meeting he will have tomorrow with 
[Turkish Cypriot leader] Rauf Denktas, he will discuss the need 
to accept the confidence-building measures, which he described 
as important. The British official also referred to the British 
Government's continuing interest in reaching an agreement on the 
confidence-building measures. But added, he is not in a 
position to know whether Denktas is willing to change his stance 
to facilitate moves toward an agreement. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] British Deputy Foreign Secretary Tom Richardson 
arrived in Cyprus this afternoon. [passage omitted] 
  Richardson said his country wants to see the 
confidence-building measures succeed and described them as a 
very significant step. He added that he does not believe the 
confidence-building measures process has failed. 
  Asked if the reason for his visit is to persuade Turkish 
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas to accept the confidence-building 
measures, the British official said his country has been 
attempting this for a long time. He added: The British 
Government is in continuous contact with Turkish Prime Minister 
Tansu Ciller, Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin, and the 
leaders of the Turkish Cypriot community. Richardson said he 
assumed his current duties three months ago, but that he had 
dealt with the Cyprus issue in his former position of British 
alternate representative to the United Nations.

<F P=106> [Report by Eleni Apostolopoulou] </F>
  [Text] According to information received this morning from 
a diplomatic source at the Greek Embassy in Tirana, there is 
concern about the arrest of six members of Omonoia, the Greek 
minority party in Albania, because it is not known how long they 
will be in prison. 
  The six members were charged with illegal possession of arms 
and with being associated with secret Greek groups seeking to 
change Albania's territory. The charges, which are considered 
to be equal to treason, were made against Theodhoros Bezanis, 
Iraklis Sirmos, Konstandinos Kiriakos, Evangelos Papakhristou, 
and Konstandinos Tsiavos [five names as heard]. 
  Greek minority circles believe the charges are unfounded 
because no arms other than hunting rifles were found in the 
possession of the six men. They also believe the Albanian 
Government is taking this action to create more problems in its 
relations with Greeks and to warn Omonoia what will happen if it 
publicizes its opposition to Tirana. Today's Albanian press did 
not carry any reports on the arrest of the six members, and 
there has been no official reaction so far. 
  Responding to a question on the arrest, Government Spokesman 
Evangelos Venizelos said Greece's stance toward Greek Albanians 
and the activity of the Albanian authorities is firm and well 
known. He said: We want the protection of Greeks within the 
framework of Albanian and international law. 
  Venizelos noted that the government has accepted the 
proposal 
for a meeting between the foreign ministers of the two 
countries, but added that it would be more meaningful if a 
meeting of experts was held in advance. He stressed: A top 
issue is respect for the human rights of the minority and for 
Albania to become a just state. 
  Referring to the visit by Yasushii Akashi, the UN secretary 
general's representative, to Skopje [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] and his meeting with [President 
Kiro] Gligorov, the spokesman noted that this visit must be 
evaluated along with developments in UN mediator Cyrus Vance's 
initiative.

  [Excerpts] Tension has again risen in Greek-Albanian 
relations because the [Albanian President Sali] Berisha regime 
brought very serious charges against six North Epirus persons 
who are members of the Omonoia organization. Specifically, the 
Albanian authorities filed charges against six North Epirotans 
that could even result in the death penalty for so-called 
espionage, separatist acts, and contacts with the Greek 
intelligence services. [passage omitted] 
  In a statement today, New Democracy Chairman Miltiadhis 
Evert 
called on all political and social organizations to mobilize 
overseas in order to exert pressure on the Albanian Government 
to free the six Greek Albanians, who are being held 
unjustifiably and illegally. The Greek Government should deal 
with the indictment of these Greek Albanians in a strong manner 
through diplomatic avenues, Evert stressed. The opposition 
leader also stressed that the Foreign Ministry should mobilize 
all Greek ambassadors and international organizations to this 
effect. In conclusion, Evert underlined that next week New 
Democracy deputies will go to international organizations 
related to human rights to brief them and inform international 
public opinion.

<F P=106> [From the "Views" column: "A Just State..."] </F>
  [Text] It is at the very least contradictory for Tirana to 
seek improvement of its relations with Greece and the 
international community while its stance toward the Greek 
minority hardens. The latest incident was the persecution of 
the Greek minority leadership under serious charges, which may 
even involve the death penalty. 
  A basic prerequisite for the improvement of Greek-Albanian 
relations is the protection of the Greek minority's rights in 
Albania. The rights of the minority, basic human rights, are 
not being protected as, in many cases, the current [Albanian 
President Sali] Berisha regime behaves as that of the former 
president Enver Hoxha did. 
  It has been announced that the six Omonoia members, who were 
recently arrested, will stand trial and face the most serious 
charges under Hoxha's regime penal code, which provides for the 
death sentence. 
  The goal is most obvious: The persecution of Omonoia's 
leadership is aimed at terrorizing Greek Albanians and making 
them continue their return to Greece. 
  The method of terrorization by persecuting leading members 
of 
the minority is well known, but Albania is supposedly moving 
toward a democratic system. 
  Mere talk about democracy is not enough when a just state is 
not being established in Albania, a state that will fully 
respect human rights. With its actions, Tirana must show that 
it is developing into a just state that abandons arbitrariness. 
  Yesterday, the Government spokesman said that the Greek 
side, 
in its efforts to improve Greek-Albanian relations, has as a top 
priority "respect for the rights of the Greek Albanians." 
  Berisha's regime must evaluate Greece's friendly intentions, 
but also realize that no Greek concessions can be made on this 
issue. The Greek side must also make this clearer. 
  Bilateral relations cannot be improved or promoted by 
provoking, persecuting, and terrorizing the Greek minority.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Rwanda: Tutsi Official Denies </F>
UNHCR Claims of Massacres"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Bari, Italy, May 19 -- Reports by the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) of massacres and 
tortures of Rwandan refugees by armed groups belonging to the 
Rwandan Patriotic Front (FPR) were denied and labeled "totally 
unfounded" in a statement released by the Tutsi-led FPR here 
Thursday [19 May]. 
  The statement, in the form of a letter of protest to the 
UNHCR chief, Sadako Ogata, demands an "immediate and public 
retraction" of the reports, made two days ago by a UNHCR 
official in Geneva. 
  The letter was signed by Jacques Bihozagara, deputy prime 
minister of the Rwandan transition government, formed by an 
agreement in Tanzania but which never took office because of the 
outbreak of warfare between the Tutsi and the Hutu tribes. 
  "Not even our most severe critics," the FPR claims, "have 
doubted the (our) commitment to the security and dignity of all 
civilians in Rwanda." Bihozagara also called the UN agency's 
allegations "irresponsible and incomprehensible."

<F P=106> [EC Document No. DOC/PESC/94/50: "Declaration by the </F>
European Union on Rwanda"] 
  [Text] The European Union, recalling its declaration of 18 
April 1994 on Rwanda, again appeals urgently to all parties to 
the conflict to bring an end to the genocide now taking place in 
the country. 
  The European Union expresses its full support for the United 
Nations' humanitarian efforts and in this context welcomes the 
resolution that is currently before the Security Council. The 
European Union looks forward to an urgent decision on measures 
which can be implemented soon. 
  The European Union welcomes the initiative of the United 
Nations High Commissioner on human rights to conduct a mission 
to both Rwanda and Burundi and supports the call for a special 
meeting of the UN Commission on human rights. 
  The European Union expresses its appreciation and support 
for 
the efforts of the OAU and to President Mwinyi of Tanzania for 
their initiatives in convening a regional conference, in which 
both the authorities of Rwanda and the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic 
Front] will be invited. 
  The European Union urges the two sides to agree on the need 
to respect the Arusha Agreement, which, through the way of 
negotiation, offers the best available basis for national 
reconciliation. In this context the European Union supports the 
call for an early imposition of an arms embargo on Rwanda, and 
calls on all concerned to refrain from any action that is liable 
to exacerbate the situation. 
  The European Union is eager to increase its humanitarian aid 
whenever and where such aid can be brought to the populations 
that have suffered so cruelly from the violence. In this 
respect it will continue its immediate assistance to refugees in 
the neighbouring countries and will endeavour to equally assist 
the stricken populations within Rwanda, whenever conditions 
allow this. 
  The European Union has decided on 6 May 1994 to dispatch a 
Troika mission, on a development ministers level, to visit as 
soon as possible the countries neighbouring Rwanda, with a view 
to evaluating the humanitarian situation vis-a-vis the influx of 
the refugees.

<F P=106> [Article signed ALN (ADB): "Chamber -- Neofascists in the </F>
Italian Government: Vigilance"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 18 May (BELGA) -- On Wednesday afternoon 
[18 May], the Chamber dedicated a long debate to the attitude 
which the government must take regarding the entry of the 
neofascists into the Italian Government of Silvio Berlusconi. 
It was an opportunity for Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene to 
repeat what he had already said to the same audience last 
Thursday. 
  The prime minister began by reaffirming that democracy is 
like a fragile plant. "So it requires constant vigilance and an 
effort on the part of each individual." Jean-Luc Dehaene also 
reiterated that Italy is a democratic country. "The elections 
took place there in full respect of the constitutional rules. 
Consequently, the results must be accepted," he said, adding 
that "the Italian Government had been formed in a legally 
correct manner." 
  "Within the European Union," he went on, "Belgium will 
reaffirm the democratic principles and continue to be highly 
vigilant in ensuring that they are respected. Regarding direct 
bilateral contacts with foreign colleagues, it is up to each 
individual Belgian minister to decide on and regulate them 
personally, naturally within the context of Belgian European 
policy," the prime minister concluded. He was applauded by the 
entire majority, including the PS [Walloon Socialist Party],

<F P=106> [Report by Christopher Lockwood: "Austria Sinks British </F>
Hopes of New EC Ally] 
  [Text] Brussels -- The Austrian Chancellor Herr Franz 
Vranitzky, yesterday declared himself in favour of further 
European integration, dashing British hopes of acquiring an ally 
in the struggle to curb the increasing power of Brussels when 
Austria joins the EC at the start of next year. 
  Both Mr John Major and Mr Douglas Hurd, the Foreign 
Secretary, have championed the accession of Austria and three 
Nordic countries. 
  They have stressed repeatedly the virtues of "widening" the 
EC as opposed to "deepening" it -- that is, moving further down 
the road to federalism. Mr Major has constantly presented the 
widening as a clear alternative to deepening. 
  Britain has also argued that Austria, Finland, Norway and 
Sweden will help to shift the balance of power within the EC 
away from the federalisers and towards the concept of a 
decentralised "Europe of nation states" which is the key 
principle underlying the Conservatives' Euro-election manifesto, 
to be launched on Monday. 
  Yesterday Chancellor Vranitzky begged to differ. In 
Austria's case at least, the supposed ally would appear to be 
something of a Trojan horse . 
  Herr Vranitzky said: "We do not see any need to choose 
between widening and deepening the EC. From the very beginning 
of our membership we will contribute to the process of 
deepening." 
  He said he expected Austria to approve EC membership when 
the 
country votes at a referendum on June 12, the same day as its 
Euroelection poll. The way will then be clear for it to join 
the EC on Jan 1. 
  During a visit to Brussels, Herr Vranitzky also declared 
himself in favour of an extension of the Qualified Majority 
Voting system, to cover some of the areas in which currently 
each country enjoys a right of veto. 
  "It is my firm conviction that the extension of this 
principle is necessary to give the institutions of the Union 
flexibility," he said. Institutional reform of the EC will be 
discussed at an intergovernmental conference in 1996, and 
Conservative Eurosceptics will view with horror the idea that an 
alleged new ally will be pressing for further dilution of 
national sovereignty. 
  Herr Vranitzky also pronounced himself in favour of drawing 
up a European constitution, something which Britain has not 
favoured. 
  In a calculated attack on British and German proposals that 
the EC should concentrate its energies on deregulation as a tool 
to cure Europe's economic ills, Herr Vranitzky again outlined a 
more Euro-activist position. "The crucial issues on the 
European agenda can in my view not be solved by deregulation or 
removing barriers alone, but call for a common active approach," 
he said. 
  It has suited Britain to project the new EC members as close 
to British positions on free trade, sound economics and minimal 
bureaucratic interference from Brussels; but Herr Vranitzky said 
that there was no question of his country joining such a 
"northern bloc". 
  He also registered a firm commitment to a progressive social 
policy and appeared to criticise Britain's opt-out from the 
Social Chapter of the Maastricht Treaty. It does not appear 
that, on the awkward political issues that will confront the EC 
in the next two or three years, the hand of Herr Vranitzky will 
often be raised alongside that of Mr Major.

  [Text] [Announcer] The taoiseach [prime minister], Mr. 
Reynolds, has said following the clarification of the Downing 
Street Declaration he believed we're now getting closer to the 
day when we will have a complete cessation of violence. 
  On the question of the involvement of loyalist 
paramilitaries 
in the talks process, Mr. Reynolds said this was a matter for 
the Unionist population, but if there was a cessation of 
violence he wanted to see everyone around the table. He said it 
must be an evenhanded approach. The taoiseach was speaking in 
County Mayo. 
  [Correspondent] The taoiseach is in Mayo campaigning in the 
by-election and the European election. A short time ago he said 
he welcomed the comments of Unionist leader Jim Molyneaux about 
loyalist involvement in the peace process. If there is a 
cessation of violence then who represents the Unionists will be 
a matter for them, but he said he favored everyone being at the 
table. This must be an evenhanded equal approach if there is a 
cessation of violence. 
  On the Sinn Fein response to the clarifications by the 
British government, the taoiseach said he accepted that they 
needed more time, but he said there is no time left to stop the 
killing. It must happen now. 
  Overall Mr. Reynolds said, the peace process was now back on 
the rails and he believed we were edging closer to the day when 
we will have a complete cessation of violence.

  [Text] In Alain Juppe's opinion, lifting the embargo on 
arms to the Bosnian Muslims would hasten their destruction. 
Such a measure would also run the risk of launching a drawn-out 
war, with its attendant deaths, ruin, refugees, and deep-rooted 
hatreds, the foreign minister said. 
  Let me remind you that the lifting of the embargo on arms is 
being called for notably by the U.S. Senate, and in France by 
Michel Rocard and intellectuals like philosopher Bernard-Henri 
Levy.

  [Excerpt] Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos today 
reiterated Athens' firm decision to insist that the human rights 
of the Greek minority in Albania be respected in order to 
improve relations with Tirana. Venizelos reminded the Albanian 
Government about the recent demarches that Greece made to 
international organizations about the issue. 
  The spokesman made this statement after [Albanian President 
Sali] Berisha's regime accused six individuals from North 
Ipirotes of serious charges following the border incident in 
Episkopi. Venizelos stressed that the Greek Government has 
always linked the improvement of Greek-Albanian relations, an 
improvement that it wants and pursues, to full respect for the 
Greek Albanian's human rights. He added that Greek-Albanian 
relations as well as Albania's relations with the European Union 
[EU] depend on this prerequisite. 
  Venizelos concluded: Greece will lodge new diplomatic 
demarches with all the international organizations and third 
countries. It has already lodged demarches with the United 
Nations, CSCE, the EU, and the U.S. Government. [passage

<F P=106> [Umit Sezgin report: "Nine Militants Killed, 1,000 Others </F>
Wounded in Zalakh Camp"] 
  [Text] Al-Sulaymaniyah--BIRAYATI [as published], the organ 
of the Democratic Party of Kurdistan, reported yesterday that 
nine militants from the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] were 
killed and 1,000 others injured when several Turkish military 
aircraft attacked the PKK camp in Zalakh two days ago. 
Meanwhile, the PKK, which recently established close relations 
with Jalal Talabani, leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan 
[PUK], has issued a statement on the attack through that party. 
The PUK official in Irbil said that Kala Dizeh, commander of 
the Zalakh camp, informed his office that "the attack by the 
Turkish military planes was completely unsuccessful. No one was 
killed or wounded." 
  The air attack on the camp created a shock wave in northern 
Iraq. Many of the PKK militants, who did not expect another 
attack after the air raid in February, had already returned to 
the camp. With the return of the militants, the military 
officials in Turkey ordered several F-4 and F-104 aircraft to 
take off from their bases in Malatya and Diyarbakir to attack 
the camp for the second time. It has been reported that all the 
buildings and other constructions in the camp were destroyed. 
Meanwhile, it has been learned that groups of PKK militants 
have begun to leave the vicinity of the camp.

  [Text] Several Turkish military aircraft bombed the Zalakh 
camp in northern Iraq at about 1200 yesterday. We contacted the 
Kurdish Workers Party's Kurdish People's Liberation Army [KPLA] 
Press Office immediately after the hour-long air attack. The 
KPLA Press Office confirmed the air attack, and said there were 
no casualties in the camp. 
  However, the Turkish General Staff Press and Public 
Relations 
Office stated that the air operation took place from 1200 to 
1220. It said that 19 aircraft took part in the attack on Zalakh 
camp and that the aircraft returned to their bases after 
destroying their targets. 
  The Zalakh camp was bombed for the first time on 28 January, 
after the government's move to devalue the Turkish lira. A 
statement made at the time said all of the targets were 
destroyed.

<F P=106> [Interview with Nizamettin Toguc and Felemez Basboga, </F>
members of the pro-Kurdish Turkish Party of Democracy, by 
unidentified correspondent in Brussels; date not given: "Real 
Separatism Is Practiced by the Turkish State" -- interviewees 
are not identified in the text] 
  [Text] Five deputies of the DEP (Party of Democracy), a 
pro-Kurdish Turkish party that has undergone a series of 
metamorphoses, have been stripped of their positions and 
arrested for "separatism." They are liable to appear before the 
State Security Court, which can pronounce death sentences. 
Deputy Nizamettin Toguc and Felemez Basboga, a member of the 
DEP Central Committee, recently made a stopover in Brussels. 
They gave their explanations: 
  If the State Security Court decided to ban the DEP, the (17 
-- LA LIBRE BELGIQUE editor's note) deputies of the party will 
be dismissed and arrested, as will most of the leaders. Several 
files have already been opened with regard to their statements 
on Kurdistan and democracy. The party's property will be 
seized. The constitution specifies that, when a party is 
banned, its deputies cannot engage in politics for 10 years. 
This constitution was drawn up in 1980, following the military 
coup d'etat. It is still in force. 
<H5>  Money </H5>
  [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] This is the fourth time you have 
reformed 
the party. That must be costly. Where does the money come 
from? There is often talk of a revolutionary tax... 
  [DEP Official] We have been supported by the people, without 
any other support. We have not forced anybody. In Turkey, 
there are also rich Kurds, but even those who are not rich give 
their support to the parties which are fighting for liberation. 
  [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] The DEP is being prosecuted for 
separatism. 
  [DEP Official] The real separatism is practiced by the 
Turkish state. Turkey is led by the military. That is why it 
does not recognize any minority, no other people, no other 
culture. Our party wants democracy, fraternity, and respect for 
human rights. 
  [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] Is fraternity synonymous with 
federation, 
or confederation? 
  [DEP Official] The important thing, when we talk of 
fraternity, is that everybody should be able to express 
themselves freely. Fraternity means equality. If everybody 
could express themselves freely, we could talk of federation or 
confederation, a different system in which peoples can live 
fraternally, in full equality. 
<H5>  Cover </H5>
  [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] Could the question be: Do you want to be 
independent? 
  [DEP Official] Independence is not our objective as a party. 
It is for the people to choose, not us. 
  [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] It is sometimes said that the DEP serves 
as a cover for the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan], which is 
waging an armed struggle against Ankara. 
  [DEP Official] There are many things that the PKK does and 
that we do too, but not together. The PKK is acting to show the 
will of the population living in this region, and that is what 
we are doing too. There are similarities between us, but the 
DEP is not a cover for or a section of the PKK. We are fighting 
in a legal and democratic way. Unfortunately, we are being 
prevented from doing that. Armed struggle is one method. As 
the Party of Democracy, we cannot say we are for or against the 
armed struggle. 
  If there was a means of struggling legally and 
democratically, I think that even the PKK would not wage an 
armed struggle. But, as you can see, we cannot wage a 
democratic struggle. Many Kurds are taking up arms, and this is 
not surprising. 
<H5>  Changing the Rationale </H5>
  [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] Is there a solution? 
  [DEP Official] The Turkish Government must stop its war 
against people who are demanding their rights. We need a 
political and democratic solution. Instead of spending so much 
on the war, this money should be devoted to investment in 
Kurdistan. But the Turkish Government is headed by military 
leaders and that is why it insists on waging war in Kurdistan. 
If the Turkish Government does not change its policy and 
persists in this military rationale, the republic of Turkey will 
disappear. If the war continues, it will not be separation but 
the destruction of the Turkish state. The Turkish budget for 
1993 was 394 trillion Turkish pounds, but the money spent on the 
war was 400 trillion. If this continues, Turkey will be in a 
complete blind alley economically.

  [Text] Ankara, May 21 (A.A.) -- Prime Minister Tansu 
Ciller said on Saturday [21 May] that the government will 
transfer 250 million dollars to Eximbank and called 
industrialists to apply to Eximbank to take credit to have 
exportation. 
  Ciller said exportation is extremely important nowadays and 
this credit that we have transferred to Eximbank is a good 
opportunity for our industry to continue its production toward 
exportation. 
  Ciller said `We have allocated this money from public 
sector's resources'. 
  She said the difficulties have not finished yet but Turkey 
is 
resolved to overcome all its problems step by step.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report] </F>
  [Text] State Minister Aykon Dogan has said that the 
preliminary results of the economic stability program are 
positive. He pointed out that the results in domestic and 
foreign borrowing, budget deficits, the foreign trade balance, 
and inflation are in line with the targets of the program. 
  In a statement he issued today, Dogan said that the tax 
revenues and domestic borrowing levels in April were in line 
with the program and that public expenditures were kept within 
the limits of the program. There was no delay in the repayment 
of foreign debts or of their interest, he said, adding that the 
positive results of the efforts to collect public revenues were 
observed in April. 
  Dogan stressed that the restriction of public expenditures 
will continue vigorously, as envisaged by the 5 April decisions. 
He pointed out that the monthly average of the 
January-February-March public deficit was 17.3 trillion Turkish 
lira [TL], while in April this figure dropped to TL5.2 trillion. 
  The consolidated budget deficit for April-May-June has been 
estimated at TL10 trillion, he said, and this target will be 
reached if the balance in the planned budget revenues and 
expenditures is maintained in May. 
  Aykon Dogan pointed out that the IMF's complete approval of 
the program was an important development. This has created 
resources of up to $600 million in 1994, he said, as well as 
World Bank project loans of up to $1.2 billion. Furthermore, he 
added, this creates the possibility of private foreign credit 
channels. 
  The state minister explained that as a result of the 
measures 
and of the realistic foreign exchange rate policy, imports 
became expensive and exports attractive. The exporters now work 
on the basis of insured guarantees, which is a modern practice, 
he said. 
  Dogan announced that exports in April rose to $1.4 billion 
while imports dropped to $2.1 billion. He added: In April, the 
ratio of exports to imports rose to 65 percent. 
  Dogan further said that a drop in the monthly rate of 
inflation will be observed in May. He said that an increase of 
less than 10 percent is expected both in the consumer price 
index and in the wholesale price index. This is an important 
sign of a healthy economy, he said. 
  Dogan said: Obviously, the program is difficult and calls 
for sacrifice. However, the sacrifice is being made by all 
sectors of the community. 
  He pointed out if implemented without concessions, the 
program will reduce the dimensions of the sacrifice in the 
coming months. Then the economy will surely recover and develop, 
he stressed.

<F P=106> ["Foreign Policy" column by Mustafa Necati Ozfatura: "The </F>
Cyprus Problem and Western Pressure"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The Cyprus problem is not a 
run-of-the-mill problem. It is a national problem about which 
the Turkish nation is very sensitive. 
  To portray Rauf Denktas as intransigent or as the party that 
is preventing an agreement would be tantamount to working for 
the Greek Cypriots. It is the Greek Cypriots who do not want a 
solution. It is the Greek Cypriots who had Butrus-Ghali 
puncture the package, eliminate the rights granted the Turkish 
Cypriots, and accord more gains to the Greek Cypriots. The aim 
is to portray Denktas and the Turkish Cypriot side as the guilty 
party, and thus pave the way for the Greek Cypriot 
Administration to join the European Union [EU]. The aim is not 
to solve the problem through a balanced and mutual 
give-and-take, but to ensure that the negotiations fail and 
blame the Turkish Cypriot side for it. 
  In fact, the confidence-building measures are a trap that is 
leading Cyprus toward enosis step-by-step and toward the 
implementation of the salami tactic in favor of the Greek 
Cypriots. 
  It is time for Turkey to set its Cyprus policy. The best 
policy is to maintain the legal and practical existence of the 
Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus [TRNC] and to assist in 
securing its recognition by other countries. The Cyprus problem 
was resolved with the 1974 peace operation. The West's 
calculations regarding a return to the pre-1974 era do not 
concern us. Let them try it if they can. 
  The fact that the $60 million in economic aid Turkey extends 
to the TRNC every year was not delivered this year is being 
interpreted as a move to pressure the TRNC. It is a significant 
shortcoming that Turkey has not met the power and water needs of 
the TRNC since 1974. Electrical power still comes from the 
Greek Cypriot side. 
  Addressing a panel meeting on the economic relations between 
Turkey and the TRNC, organized by the Turkish Businessmen and 
Administrators Fund, Rauf Denktas said that his feelings were 
hurt by Turkey, that the past 20 years were wasted, and that a 
deep-rooted dialogue was not formed between Turkey and the TRNC 
during all those years. He said: "The TRNC is a separate 
country, but we have a common religion, language, and ancestry. 
The interests of the two countries are the same as the 
interests of the 60 million Turks. The Greek Cypriots always 
see the Turkish Cypriots as a disintegrating community. Despite 
all the negative stands, however, including the attitude of 
Turkey, we have fought the difficulties and we have not 
collapsed. We could have been in a much better position today. 
We could have undertaken joint tourism investments with Turkey 
during the past 20 years. The existing facilities in the TRNC 
could have been exploited better through joint tourism projects. 
Small- and medium-size industries could have been set up. The 
TRNC's economy could have supported Turkey abd not been a burden 
to it. It is not too late now...." 
  Unfortunately, with pressure from the EU, Turkey is 
implementing a sort of economic embargo on the TRNC. For some 
reason, the TRNC- Turkey customs union agreement could not be 
concluded during the past two years. TRNC citizens are not 
allowed to set up companies or trade in Turkey. Turkey does not 
conduct with the Turkish Cypriots the commercial cooperation it 
has with the Greek Cypriots. Turkey even refuses to recognize 
the TRNC's sovereignty rights in the sea. The status of the 
TRNC is always unclear during the UN debates on Cyprus. The 
Turkish Republic does not recognize the TRNC as a fully 
independent state. 
  Turkey is not helping the TRNC economy, which is tied to its 
own economy, stand on its own two feet. Turkey's cool attitude 
toward the TRNC upsets the balance in favor of the Greek 
Cypriots.

  [Text] Mehmet Gulcegun, deputy leader of the Social 
Democratic Populist Party [SDPP], has said that the Habur border 
gate with Iraq will regain its old vitality in the coming period. 
  At a news conference in Ankara, Gulcegun said this step will 
partly alleviate the load placed on the Turkish economy by the 
embargo imposed on Iraq. Furthermore, he said, reopening the 
Habur border gate will end the crisis in the transportation 
sector, which is an important source of income in southeast 
Anatolia. 
  Gulcegun pointed out that Murat Karayalcin, SDPP leader and 
deputy prime minister, will go to Baghdad next month. During 
the visit, the SDPP deputy leader said, work will be conducted 
to develop cooperation possibilities. 
  [Begin Gulcegun recording] We are trying to solve the Habur 
problem, because it is the source of other negative developments 
in the region. Loyal to the unity of the country and to the 
state, the industrious regional people will make use of this 
opportunity in the best possible way. They will ensure their 
income while contributing to the economy of our country. [end

  [Text] National Defense Minister Mehmet Golhan has left 
for Brussels to participate in the NATO Defense Planning 
Committee and Nuclear Planning Group meetings. 
  In a news conference at Ankara's Esenboga Airport prior to 
his departure, Golhan said the developments following the 
dissolution of the former Yugoslavia will be discussed at the 
meetings. Explaining that the unstable situation that emerged 
after the Cold War ended is very critical, Golhan stated that 
achieving security and stability is the prime concern of all 
countries and international organizations, especially NATO. 
Golhan said: 
  [Begin Golhan recording] These developments prompted the EC 
to develop into the European Union and led to the revival of the 
Western European Union, to the establishment of the North 
Atlantic Cooperation Council, to Partnership for Peace projects, 
and to the emergence of mutual responsibilities and duties. 
[end recording] 
  Golhan stated that in its meetings, the NATO Defense 
Planning 
Council will make decisions regarding the above developments, 
while the NATO Nuclear Planning Group meetings will assess 
measures taken with regard to the deployment of nuclear weapons. 
Golhan added that he will also hold bilateral meetings with his 
counterparts.

<F P=106> [Speech by Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi to the Chamber </F>
of Deputies in Rome -- live] 
  [Excerpts] Dear deputies, my late arrival was due to a 
delay in concluding the morning session of the confidence 
debate, because many deputies did not respect the time limits 
allocated to them. [passage omitted] 
  Please allow me to start by offering my best wishes and my 
thanks at the efforts put into discussing my speech, which 
according to practice I read to the Chamber immediately after 
having read it to the Senate. Once the custom was to repeat 
without omissions the speech of the prime minister, but this 
practice has been, I think wisely, abolished. The repetition of 
an identical speech came to be considered a mere formality, or 
if you will, a rite rather than a homage to the rules of 
institutional communication. On the other hand, as my colleague 
Giorgio Napolitano [former speaker of the Chamber of Deputies] 
reminded us, ours is a system of perfect bicameralism, where one 
assembly repeats, or almost repeats, that which the other does. 
[passage omitted] 
  As every one knows, the elections took place on 27 and 28 
March of this very year, and the republic will from this 
evening, if of course I obtain your confidence, have a 
government that is completely in control of its duties. [passage 
omitted] 
  For the hundreth time, I will tell you how things stand: I 
founded, nurtured, and administered until a few months ago a 
large number of companies. I acted in accordance with the 
constitutional laws that guarantee free enterprise. However, 
today I am no longer a businessman, I no longer carry out any 
administrative duties in my companies, I do not take part in the 
decisions concerning the running of these companies, I do not 
hold any posts in these companies, I am the managing director of 
nothing, I do not attend any meetings, nor do I attend any 
shareholder assemblies. This is my ethical behavior with regard 
to the assets that I own. Furthermore, I am supervised by my 
conscience -- which no one in good faith can doubt -- I am 
supervised by the president of the republic, by the anti-trust 
authorities, by the media ombudsman, by the Council of Ministers 
-- which is a collective body -- by the parliament, and most 
especially by the opposition parties, by judiciary, by the free 
press, by the electors, and by public opinion. If all this is 
not enough, if we want to look into the future and exercise 
without control the normal functions of surveillance to which 
all public men are subject then this is bad. [passage omitted] 
  Let us return to serious matters, former speaker Napolitano 
touched upon points with which I frankly agree. [passage 
omitted] 
  It is true that a first-past-the-post system must have a 
series of checks and balances. The American system of 
democracy, which is a presidential and first-past-the-post 
system par excellence, is indeed based on a cast-iron system of 
checks and balances, of autonomous powers, which are controlled 
by great authorities. However, in Italy we are only at the 
beginning of this process. For the past few months, we have had 
a first-past-the-post system with a strong proportional 
counterweight. [passage omitted] 
  I am sensitive to the question of counterweights and 
guarantees, of rules and the rigorous adherence to those rules. 
[passage omitted] 
  I will not repeat here the considerations on my government's 
policy or on the various points of this policy, as I already did 
this in the Senate. I am convinced that even the best policy 
cannot exist and thrive without the existence of instruments to 
put this policy into practice. [passage omitted] 
  I am certain that I have formed a capable team full of 
competent and enthusiastic people. [passage omitted] 
  Mr. Fausto Bertinotti [leader of the Communist Refoundation 
Party], what do you mean when you say that the crisis in the 
Italian economy is a structural one? I think that you mean that 
the crisis is a serious one, that it has nothing to do with the 
current situation, that it cannot be solved without 
intervention, that the sectors involved are productive, 
agricultural, industrial, financial, and commercial, that 
briefly what is at stake are the destiny and the aims of our 
economy. If structural means this, then my honorable colleague, 
be so kind as to realize that there is no difference of opinion 
between us as far as our country's economy is concerned. We 
disagree on the means of overcoming these difficulties. Our 
disagreement is a simple one and is one that everybody can 
understand without oversimplifying the nature of the problem. 
[passage omitted] 
  I am referring to a point in your speech in which you blame 
all of the world's suffering on capitalism. Allow me to say 
that you are forgetting a fact that is now universally 
recognized in our time. [passage omitted] 
  Most of the suffering in our time should be laid at the door 
of Communism and the Socialist reality and to the misery that 
they caused, rather than at the door of captalism. 
  Everyone knows how I feel about this, and my views were put 
to the electorate. I do not expect this to be accepted, but I 
only ask that it should be put to the test, because, as I said, 
they are not dogmatic thoughts. [passage omitted] 
  The government must intervene in two ways, by supporting the 
economy by freeing it from too many rules that stifle it, and, 
at the same time, by supervising the adherence to those rules 
without which there would be no free market: support and 
supervision. This does not mean managing the economy. [passage 
omitted] 
  The free market is a strategy of development that must be 
treated cautiously, but it is a strategy to whose principles 
this government has decided to adhere with wisdom and restraint. 
[[passage omitted] 
  Dear deputies, I would like to thank Achille Occhetto for 
his 
speech. I am sure that he made the right choice when he said 
that the Left would not follow a blind and factious opposition 
line. [passage omitted] 
  Achille Occhetto was one of the first to recognize after the 
general election vote the right of the winning coalition to 
govern. Then, for some reason, he changed his mind, and the 
secretary of the largest party on the Left called this 
government a humiliating one for Italy. Furthermore, he used a 
tone that was completely out of character in an attempt to take 
away the government's legitimacy. [passage omitted] 
  I do not believe that this is simply a right-wing 
government. 
This morning, the honorable Taradash [Radical Party] and the 
honorable Bonnino, with her moving silence, asked me how I 
regarded the role of the reformers in my government. [passage 
omitted] 
  I intend to keep the helm firmly in the center. The 
coalition that feeds the government with ideas and proposals -- 
as we saw during the course of the debate in the chambers -- has 
a common moderate and democratic denominator. The coalition 
encompasses the liberal left wing of the reformers to the 
Catholics then through to the center politics of Forza Italia 
and to a grassroots movement such as the Northern League, and 
finally encompassing the institutional right of Gianfranco Fini. 
However, one can coin the definitions that one prefers. 
[passage omitted] 
  A pretext for bitterness is the presence in the government 
of 
the National Alliance. This is an electoral slate and political 
organization that has signed a pact with the electors and with 
other movements to govern Italy; it emerged from the polls 
triumphant. This is a political organization that, as the 
Honorable Fini solemnly confirmed this morning, has consigned 
its links with fascism to history. This is a political movement 
that, as Francesco Cossiga reminded us in the Senate, in the 
past, when it was not called National Alliance and when it was 
very different from what it is today, used its determining votes 
to elect people to the highest offices in the state. These 
actions were received with thanks. [passage omitted] 
  If you want to criticize us, then let me be the target of 
your criticism, because I am a liberal democrat antifascist or 
perhaps you can criticize my policies; however, do not look for 
any pretexts to criticize the National Alliance. [passage 
omitted] 
  I would like to thank the groups that make up the Freedom 
Alliance and that have decided to give their vote of confidence 
to the government. [passage omitted] 
  We have a shared vision of a united and federal Italy in a 
united and federal Europe. [passage omitted] 
  I listened carefully to the things said by the Honorable 
Gianfranco Fini during the course of this parliamentary 
confidence debate. I do not know if one can say that 
antifascism is the opposite of fascism. However, it is certain 
that the Honorable Fini confirmed this morning the rigor of his 
intention that many, including his adversaries, recognize. I am 
certain that he says what he means and what he believes in when 
he affirms his belief in the principles of democracy and liberty 
and when he affirms his opposition to the political 
totalitarianism that has marked the history of this century. 
Italian democracy has always shown, my dear colleagues, a great 
capacity to attract its ideological adversaries, and this has 
been recognized instinctively by true liberals: liberty 
liberates. 
  Madame speaker and honorable colleagues, if we obtain your 
confidence, then from tomorrow the work of the government will 
begin in earnest. You know that we have been summoned here by 
millions of Italians who have a great desire for change. You 
know the principles that we believe in and the values that 
inspire us. We believe in all forms of liberty -- the liberty 
of thought, the liberty of expression, of association, the 
liberty to practice one's religion -- every religion, those 
faiths that encourage man to improve himself. We believe in the 
individual, we believe that we each have the right to fulfill 
ourselves, to build our future with our own hands and to aspire 
to well-being. We believe in the family, which is the center of 
our affections and the fundamental nucleus of our society. We 
believe in enterprise, which is the organization and institution 
that creates work, well-being, and wealth. [passage omitted] 
  We believe in tolerance, and for us it is natural to 
practice 
this. We believe in respect, in respect for everyone -- even 
our enemies and above all for those who are the weakest. 
[passage omitted] 
  We are ready for everything. Today we are ready to govern 
and tomorrow to be in opposition. We are a new force managing 
the state, and for this precise political motive, we ask to be 
judged by facts. [passage omitted] 
  It is obvious that it will not be easy to put the country 
back onto the right road, it will not be easy to relaunch the 
economy and to safeguard jobs and above all to create new jobs. 
It will not be easy to manage public money with attention and 
with the capacity to make savings by reining in public 
expenditure to relieve fiscal pressure. [passage omitted] 
  We know that our task will not be easy, but we will try to 
succeed. 
  Dear colleagues, I thank you and ask that you give the 
government your confidence.

<F P=106> [Interview with Finance Minister Giulio Tremonti by Massimo </F>
Giannini in Rome; date not given: "I Will Not Be the Tax 
Cadorna"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Finance Minister] Tremonti 
finds himself with a heavy burden on his shoulders. To try and 
translate into reality the umpteenth "dream" which the new 
Luther King of Arcore, [Prime Minister] Silvio Berlusconi, has 
recounted to Italians: a drastic cut in tax pressure and a 
reduction in personal income tax, with an exemption on all 
incomes under 10 million lire a year. 
  [Giannini] What do you think of this, minister? 
  [Tremonti] At this stage it is premature to make grand 
promises. I have not made any and I never make any, also 
because we have to set everything within a major general reform 
of the system. [Tremonti ends] 
  This already tells us a lot about the caution and the 
"realpolitik" of the person. We are already light years distant 
from the triumphalist preelection mirages drawn by Berlusconi. 
  [Giannini] Does this mean that, after employment and health, 
the new government of the Right is preparing to beat another 
retreat in the area of finance? 
  [Tremonti] Nothing of the sort. But one has to progress in 
an ordered manner, and to distinguish immediately between two 
phases. There is an immediate kick-start action in the tax area, 
which should take place within the first 100 days. The first 
measure to prepare is the detaxation of reinvested profits, 
extended to all manufacturing companies. 
  [Giannini] You are already talking of lightening the burden. 
How do you resolve the problem of less income? 
  [Tremonti] The effect of this measure, if we calibrate it 
correctly, will in 1994 be limited to the November installment. 
In 1995, however, the effects of the recovery of industrial 
activity should increase tax revenue, compensating for the fall 
in income of the previous year, but with an additional 
advantage. For the first time, the tax office will cease having 
a simply tax-levying function, and will become the positive 
partner of enterprises. Then there is the second measure, the 
"hiring premium" -- tax relief or a reduction in contributions 
for companies which take on personnel. In this case, too, the 
reduction in income will be compensated for, because the new 
jobs create salaries, and hence new personal income tax, and 
hence new VAT. 
  [Giannini] Let us now come to the major structural changes 
in 
the system. What should we expect in the next budget? 
  [Tremonti] Talking already about specific measures is 
premature. I can say that I will seek to obtain the necessary 
legislative instruments with which to design a new tax system. 
The reform, it seems to me, ought to move in three basic 
directions. Number one: from complex to simple. Citizens ought 
to be able to do their own tax duty in a linear and transparent 
fashion. For me there are two fundamental teachings. One is 
that of Stuart Mill: The human mind is simple, and needs simple 
stimuli. The second is that of the French people, which closed 
their bill of grievances with a precise demand: one king, one 
law, and one tax roll, because it wanted to be governed, it 
wanted the certainty of law, and it wanted to pay its taxes in a 
nonoppressive fashion. Up till now, in Italy, each of these has 
functioned in the opposite way. Too much confusion, two much 
legislative stress. Do you know how many laws and decrees have 
been passed in the tax area between 1986 and 1993? 
  [Giannini] Tell us, Minister. 
  [Tremonti] Exactly 1,820. And do you know how many decrees 
we have inherited, be it through a correct choice of legislative 
policy, from the old government? Well 60, and 60 decrees all 
currently in the pipeline are not law, but totally the reverse. 
Is it not absurd that, to simplify the model 740 [Italian 
personal tax declaration], my predecessor as minister had 
produced a cubic meter of legal text? That I will never do.... 
  [Giannini] And what will you do? And what should we expect 
for the 1994 model 740. 
  [Tremonti] I hope that, with a finally new tax system, it 
will be a more humane income tax declaration, from every point 
of view. 
  [Giannini] Tell us about the two other directions. 
  [Tremonti] The second is the move from direct to indirect 
taxes, from taxation on income to taxation on consumption. We 
are at the end of the political centrality of personal taxation 
and progressive taxation, which must remain but which can no 
longer pretend to be the queen of the system. We are no longer 
in the age of idealism, but in the age of consumerism, and the 
brunt of the levy should fall on things and on nonessential 
consumer goods. In this way the philosophy too is changing, no 
longer just Hegelian and authoritarian, but Kantian and 
contractualist, with people who, buying and consuming, choose 
themselves how much tax to pay. 
  [Giannini] OK, but will the tax rates change, will personal 
income tax bite less hard? 
  [Tremonti] We will need a change in rates, in order to 
reduce 
the progression, and hence contain the burden, in particular for 
single-income families. 
  [Giannini] For you, is Berlusconi's idea that one can reduce 
general tax pressure in our country credible? 
  [Tremonti] In theory yes, in practice we need to look at 
the balance sheet figures, from the side of expenditure and that 
of income. From this viewpoint, we are in May and the data we 
have at the ministry are still those from March. In any event I 
must wait for the outcome of the self-assessment operation. But 
in general I have the feeling that the general situation is 
anything but rosy. 
  [Giannini] We ought then to expect a deficit which is even 
higher than what has been forecast? 
  [Tremonti] It is early to say so, I am taking a major 
inventory. One thing which is certain is that, even to mark the 
political change from the First to the Second Republic, I will 
not do any make up job on the income, and I will state clearly 
whether these are only nonoperating losses, that is whether the 
hole is really due solely to the recession, or whether there is 
not also an active shortfall, that is true and real holes. 
  [Giannini] In which case other body blows will be dealt, 
other than tax relief. 
  [Tremonti] I hope not, also because I am counting on the 
move 
to a new tax system. We have had enough body blows. I do not 
believe in the tactics of the Cadorna front [Italian front in 
World War I]: 40,000 dead to recover 30 meters of ground; 
maneuvers of 15 trillion lire to discover after a few months 
that we are back again where we started. It is not a question 
of defending Isonzo [Italian World War I battlefield], we need 
to win the war and reconstruct the system from the beginning. 
  [Giannini] Precisely. What is the third and last direction 
of the reform? 
  [Tremonti] It is the move from the center to the periphery, 
i.e., tax federalism. This means here reconstructing our 
democratic system from the bottom, based on the very simple 
mechanism of "I come, I see, I pay," which is our translation of 
the Anglo-Saxon principle of "no taxation without 
representation." Today, this is a problem of direction. 
Historically, federalism moves from the divided to the united. 
For us it runs in the opposite direction, federalism is 
imposing itself as a reaction to an excess of etatism. It does 
not burn with the fire of race and language. It is, 
secondarily, a problem of naming. For us the most valid model 
is that of self-government, autonomy which moves from the bottom 
to the top. 
  [Giannini] What does this mean, at the level of taxes? 
  [Tremonti] Local taxes should remain where they have been 
paid, without me carrying them to Rome. The major taxes, on the 
other hand, are structurally state-level and should serve to 
finance the state and for the purpose of territorial 
redistribution. We need, ultimately, to find a just balance 
between sacrifice -- with a sense of solidarity and at national 
level -- and benefit -- at the individual and local level. 
People who pay taxes should have the tangible impression that 
they get back something and that they control with their own 
vote who uses their money. This is an essential factor for 
democracy, but also for public morality. It is not by chance 
that, under the previous regime, it was precisely local entities 
which were the main sources of embezzlement of state funds. 
  [Giannini] On this subject, someone has just spoken about 
partial remission of taxes on buildings, and of tax remissions 
which should even be covered by those found guilty of bribery 
and corruption. What do you think of this? 
  [Tremonti] Absolutely not. Nobody has ever spoken to me 
about this. And in any cause, to consider this, one would need 
a two-thirds majority consensus. 
  [Giannini] Tell us the truth, minister. You are said to be 
an independent technician. In reality you have seemed 
ideologically to be closer to the Left, then you entered the 
Segni Pact, and now you are governing with the Right. rom WHere 
are you coming? 
  [Tremonti] I consider myself as being on the Left in so far 
as the Left is a metaphor for change. And, leaving aside the 
metaphor, I accepted the proposal of the person who offered me 
this prospect of change in total autonomy. I have accepted the 
challenge. I am in this government not for the sake of the 
ministerial office, but solely to be able to try, among other 
things, to design a new tax system. If I can not work well, I 
am going.

  [Text] This is the first week which sees the government 
taking control of the full powers invested in it. At the same 
time the dispute between the government and the opposition is 
growing over the chairmanships of the parliamentary committees, 
and campaigning is already in full swing for the European 
elections, which are 20 days away. Mauro Mazza reports: 
  [Mazza, over video of Forza Italia election rally] We can 
hear his amplified voice: Silvio Berlusconi chose to take part 
in the rally at Cagliari over the telephone. He told the Forza 
Italia rally of his dream of an Italy which was prevented from 
falling into the clutches of the Left when he joined the 
election. He explained that 80 percent of his party's 
objectives have already been met, only 20 percent are left, and 
these consist of giving Italy a good government. 
  Berlusconi, citing a number of opinion polls, maintains that 
only one out of 10 Italian Popular Party voters support the 
opposition line chosen by the current leadership and he forecast 
that many Popular Party parliamentarians will support his 
government. In other words, Forza Italia has the wind in its 
sails even if Berlusconi, for the first time, puts his troops on 
the alert: Be careful and pay close attention to the many 
people, the recycled ones -- as he called them -- who want to 
change their spots and who want to join the movement. 
  The leaders of the Christian Democrat Center have also 
commented on the presence of the fascist ministers in the 
government. Clemente Mastella, Pierferdinando Casini, and 
Francesco D'Onofrio say that Italian democracy has nothing to 
fear from the National Alliance. 
  Even the opposition are now choosing other ways in which to 
attack the government: Mino Martinazzoli, the former secretary 
of the Italian Popular Party, said at a meeting in Iseo that the 
party must remain at the center of Italian politics and warned 
that it should lean neither to left or the right. However, not 
everybody agrees, and (Veltroni) has said that the left and the 
center must find a way of coming together as an opposition force 
and also as a future ruling coalition. 
  Achille Occhetto cuts short any questions on the arguments 
involving the party leadership. He said that the party congress 
will put an end to speculation, but at present it must be united 
in order to fight in the European elections on 12 June. 
  Massimo Cacciari [mayor of Venice] seems to be giving 
Occhetto a hand. Cacciari is being wooed as the next possible 
secretary of the Party of the Democratic Left. He said that 
even if he wants to become leader of the party, he could not 
because he is not a party member. The argument goes on.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Knight Up, Bossi Down"] </F>
  [Text]The Knight [Berlusconi's nickname] is galloping while 
the Bandwagon [Northern League symbol] is slowing down. The Oak 
Tree [symbol of the Democratic Party of the Left, PDS] is 
growing on terrain where the bushes are getting ever thinner. 
These, along with the increase in the extreme wings of 
Communist Renewal and the National Alliance [AN] are the most 
significant predictions coming from a CIRM poll on voters' 
intentions for the 12 June European election. The poll was 
conducted among 4,155 individuals between 18-29 April, and 
compared voting intentions for the European election with votes 
cast under the proportional system for the Chamber of Deputies 
in the election of 28 March. 
  Compared with the preceding election, today Forza Italia 
would gain 3.1 percent, going from 21.1 to 24.2 percent of the 
total vote; the PDS would grow by 1.4 percent, AN by 1.1 
percent, Communist Renewal by 0.9 percent. The Greens would 
remain stable, while all the others would register serious 
losses. On the progressive front, the greatest loss would be 
registered by the PSI [Italian Socialist Party] (minus 0.9), 
followed by the Rete and AD [Democratic Alliance] (minus 0.4 
and 0.3 respectively.) In the Center, the most penalized would 
be the Segni Pact, which would lose 0.8 percent, while the 
Italian Popular Party [PPI] would lose 0.5 percent. [Marco] 
Pannella's loss is considerable (minus 1.5), while among the 
government coalition the Northern League would be the only one 
to lose (minus 1.1). 
  How many of the voters would today repeat the choice made on 
28 March? The table below reports the "degree of loyalty" for 
each party, keeping in mind the high number of undecideds just 
a little over a month before the election. In this case the 
award for loyalty goes to the extreme factions (Communist 
Renewal with 78 percent and AN with 76). However, CIRM has also 
elaborated the poll data using the so-called "French method," 
that is, hypothesizing a certain distribution of the undecided 
votes. Using this method, the most loyalty is that shown by AN 
voters, 96 percent of whom would repeat the choice made on 28 
March. A close percentage--above 90 percent--goes to the 
following, in numerical order: Forza Italia, PDS, Northern 
League, Communist Renewal, and PPI. The "traitors" would seem 
to be above all among the voters of Pannella (66.7 percent 
loyal), the Rete (74.6), AD (78.7) and the PSI (80.8). Where 
would these wandering votes go? According to CIRM data, the 
most significant number of votes would go from Communist Renewal 
to the PDS; from the Rete and AD to the PDS and (hear, hear!) to 
the AN; and from the Segni Pact and Pannella list to Forza 
Italia. 
  The Northern League's "tough line" attracts male voters in 
particular: [Umberto] Bossi's party clearly receives more 
preferences from men than women. The same goes for the AN, and 
in a lesser sense, for the PSI, AD, and Communist Renewal. The 
Knight's indiscreet charm, instead, attracts women in 
particular, who vote for him more than men, a phenomenon that 
also occurs within the PPI and the Segni Pact. Young voters 
especially reward Communist Renewal, the Greens, Forza Italia, 
and the AN. The elderly --those over 65--instead show a marked 
preference for the PPI.

<F P=106> [Article signed WDN: "Kurdish Leader Kani Yilmaz Denies </F>
Triumphant Reports From Ankara"] 
  [Text] Kani Yilmaz is the representative in Europe of the 
National Front for the Liberation of Kurdistan (ERNK), which is 
closely linked with the guerrilla movement PKK [Workers Party of 
Kurdistan]. At a news conference in Brussels yesterday, he 
denied the triumphant reports released on a virtually daily 
basis by the Turkish Government. Not a day goes by without the 
official Turkish press agency ANATOLIA reporting the deaths of 
dozens of PKK guerrillas. The day before yesterday, General 
Dogan Guces, the commander of the Turkish Army, told the Turkish 
newspaper HURRIYET that "the PKK was eradicated." 
  "We have recently suffered some severe blows," Yilmaz 
admitted, "but on the other hand, the PKK guerrillas have never 
had such a flood of young Kurds streaming to join their ranks 
and fight the Turkish state." 
  "However," Yilmaz went on immediately, "the Turkish 
Government of Prime Minister Ciller is peddling false victories. 
As time goes on, the Turkish Army is daring less and less to 
engage in direct confrontation with the guerrillas, and is 
consequently switching to wholesale psychological warfare, in 
which the Turkish press is playing a key role in spreading 
triumphant reports that are manufactured out of thin air. Not 
we, but Turkish Prime Minister Ciller will surrender before the 
summer is out," Yilmaz predicted. In a detestable war like the 
one currently raging in Turkish Kurdistan, where no prying is 
tolerated, and where many journalists have lost their lives, it 
remains difficult to verify the correctness of any reports. 
However, yesterday it was Yilmaz's turn to be absolutely sure: 
"In the last four months, the Kurdish guerrillas have suffered 
882 losses; 152 PKK fighters have been wounded, and eight taken 
prisoner." Yet Yilmaz contrasts these figures with the losses 
suffered by the Turks: "2,155 soldiers and 33 officers have 
died during the same period, as have 15 leading watchmen 
(members of the Turkish militia in Kurdistan); moreover, 482 
village watchmen were taken without a struggle. A total of 884 
village watchmen has gone over to the guerrillas." 
  Yilmaz requested that special attention be paid to the 
scorched earth policy currently being implemented by the Turkish 
Army in Kurdistan. "In recent weeks, 30,000 Kurds have fled to 
northern Iraq as a result," Yilmaz said. "And there, they land 
right in the middle of the fight raging between Iraqi Kurdish 
parties under the guerrilla leaders Barzani and Talabani, which 
have already been shelling each other for weeks," he went on. 
According to Yilmaz, "Barzani and Saddam Husayn have joined 
forces to suppress the Kurdish people. Turkey has been given 
the role of clearing Iraq's name of all guilt. Ankara and 
Baghdad are working together closely again in their common fight 
against the Kurdish people," Yilmaz said. 
  Yesterday, the Kurdish leader reiterated in no uncertain 
term 
that the Kurdish guerrillas will continue their attacks on the 
Turkish economy and hence also on tourism in Turkey. "We advise 
foreigners not to come to Turkey. Tourism is something one does 
in the pursuit of pleasure, but surely there can be no pleasure 
in visiting a country where one people is killing off another."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "No Unilateral Action in European </F>
Policies"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- The 1993 foreign policy report, which has 
been submitted to parliament, focuses on the European Union 
[EU]. In the report, Foreign Minister Alois Mock mentions the 
difficulties that Austria would be facing if it were forced to 
"go it alone" as far as European policies are concerned. 
  Mock also tries to dispel fears that the Austria's foreign 
policy has narrowed in scope because of its orientation toward 
the EU, referring to Austria's participation in the Council of 
Europe and the European Free Trade Association, as well as to 
its commitment to the CSCE and the United Nations. 
  Mock noted a particular focus on human rights. The report 
deals extensively with the United Nations and the Council of 
Europe. The country's commitment to the Council of Europe shows 
that, for Austria, European policies are not identical with the 
EU. Generally, the report assesses the Council of Europe as a 
catalyzer for the process of European unification. 
  In 1993, too, the cruel war in the former Yugoslavia was the 
darkest chapter in Austria's foreign policy, according to Mock. 
"Our most important concern was to prevent efforts aimed at the 
partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina," he stressed. The foreign 
minister expressed satisfaction at the creation of safety zones, 
which Austria has demanded for a long time. 
  The foreign policy report explains the need for European 
integration with the argument that internal and external 
security can neither be ensured at the national level nor 
achieved against each other. The future Europe must share 
common values and a common political culture. For Austria, the 
EU is the center of the new Europe. 
  Referring to the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy, 
Mock stated that Austria is working from the premise that 
participation in the common foreign and security policy is 
compatible with its constitution. Legal amendments will be 
required as a result of Austria's entry into the EU. However, 
this does not entail any obligation to participate in wars or to 
join military alliances. 
  Commenting on the Western European Union (WEU), the report 
stresses that it should be expanded as an instrument to 
strengthen NATO's European pillar. In this context, the report 
refers to current cooperation with regard to the embargo against 
Serbia. After entry into the EU, Austria wants to apply for the 
status of "observer" with the WEU.

<F P=106> [Report signed "i.m., kps": "Dispute Over Sudeten Germans: </F>
Prague and SPOe Against Mock"] 
  [Excerpts] Vienna/Prague -- Foreign Minister Alois Mock 
finds the debate over the Charles IV Prize, which will be 
awarded to him by the Sudeten German Landsmannschaft on Saturday 
[21 May], sad: "This discussion reflects a tragic human 
catastrophe of German history," Mock told DIE PRESSE on Thursday. 
  Mock said he thinks people can learn their lessons from 
history; the European unification process based on German-French 
reconciliation was one of these enormous learning processes, and 
it still is today. 
  "In the case of Germans in the Czech Republic, I have always 
spoken out for the protection of human rights, and I will 
continue to do so in the future -- my commitment in the CSCE and 
the Council of Europe also proves this," Mock added. 
  Mock finds the irritation about his comparison of expulsions 
and ethnic cleansing in Bosnia especially incomprehensible: "I 
only mentioned views of [Czech President Vaclav] Havel's that 
are supported by quotes and which I found very impressive, which 
I share and which have never been revoked." [passage omitted] 
  Karsten Eder, chairman of the Sudeten Germans in Austria, 
cannot understand "why the Czechs are making such a fuss when 
someone is awarded a prize for advocating a just order of 
nations. I cannot understand how they can protest against this. 
I also cannot understand how the Czech Government can react 
with dismay and indignation to an invitation by the Sudeten 
German Landsmannschaft," Eder said. Like Mock, he stressed that 
problems can only be solved through talks. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "`Government Must Save 20 Billion'"] </F>
  [Text] Over the next four years, the new government will 
have to save almost 20 billion guilders in order to halt growing 
unemployment. This recommendation, contained in a memo to the 
government formation, was made by the Central Economic 
Commission (CEC), which is comprised of senior officials from 
the Ministries of Finance, Social Affairs, Economic Affairs, as 
well as from the Central Planning Office. 
  The CEC's savings measures are on the high side compared to 
the electoral platforms of the four major parties. Only the VVD 
[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] wants more savings: 
17 billion guilders in addition to the 5 billion the current 
government has already chalked up. 
  According to the CEC, 10 billion guilders must be saved in 
social benefits. Next, 11 billion guilders must be used to 
lower employers' wage costs to the level of the minimum wage. 
At the same time, the CEC is advocating measures to maintain 
the purchasing power of those earning the lowest incomes. 
  In this respect, the officials are opting for a completely 
different path than that taken by the committee chaired by 
former European Commissioner F. Andriessen. Last week, he 
advised increasing the difference between benefits and wages by 
giving working people a tax break. The CEC wants to make it 
more attractive for employers to create jobs for people who are 
poorly trained. 
  According to the CEC, intervention measures are inevitable 
if 
the government wants to prevent a situation in 1998 in which 
there are 89 people not working for every 100 employed. The 
officials call the growth in the number of nonactive people 
"socially and economically disruptive." 
  They want to maintain the current social security system for 
those people who are currently dependent upon it. The changes 
should apply only to newcomers. As was already known last week, 
the CEC wants to place further limits on access to occupational 
disability insurance. 
  Only those people who have worked five years or longer and 
who are more than two-thirds occupationally disabled will still 
be considered for occupational disability benefits. The 
officials feel that people suffering from partial occupational 
disabilities must remain at the service of their employers. 
This was also suggested by parliament's Buurmeijer committee of 
inquiry. 
  As for the investigation into the viability of a "purple" 
government coalition comprising the Pvda [Labor Party], the VVD, 
and D66 [Democrats 66], the results of the Buurmeijer committee 
play an important role. The D66 embraced them in its electoral 
platform and VVD leader Bolkestein let it be known even before 
the elections that he wanted to give up the former system if the 
Buurmeijer proposal was adequate. The PvdA, which rejects the 
former system, also feels that the Buurmeijer proposal is more 
open to discussion. 
  The CEC also wants to privatize the national health 
insurance 
system, abolish the Heir Act, and lower the contribution for 
single people to 60 percent of the minimum wage. In addition, 
old age pensioners who have a supplementary pension of at least 
10,000 guilders per year will have to pay taxes for all kinds of 
national insurance, including of course the old age pension. 
  The senior officials also proposed putting stiffer taxes on 
cars and energy. These measures should yield almost 5 billion 
guilders. 
  Working through the plan it would appear that the ratio of 
working to nonworking people may become more favorable over the 
next four years: 100 working people to 82 nonworking people. 
The advantage of this is that the linking of benefits to wages 
in industry can continue. The law states that linking may only 
be applied if per 100 working people there are not more than 
82.6 nonworking people.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Investments in East Europe Growing </F>
Fast -- Netherlands Fifth Investor] 
  [Excerpt] Netherlands investments in Central and East 
Europe are growing rapidly. In 1993, Netherlands companies 
invested a record amount of $754 million in the former east bloc 
countries. That is twice as much as in 1992 ($373 million) and 
substantially more than was invested in 1991 ($155 million) and 
1990 ($7 million). 
  These figures were released on Thursday [19 May] by 
accountants and consultants in Amsterdam. They were contained 
in a study carried out by KPMG Corporate Finance and its 
European desk regarding the attractiveness of Central and East 
Europe for Netherlands companies. 
  Now, together with France, Netherlands is the fifth-ranking 
investor in the area. In all, Netherlands companies invested 
$1.3 billion in East Europe during the period 1990-1993. The 
biggest investor during this period was the United States, with 
$7.8 billion, followed by Germany ($7.2 billion), Italy ($3.4 
billion), the United Kingdom ($1.9 billion), and both France and 
the Netherlands ($1.3 billion each). Together, over the period 
1990-1993, foreign companies invested $26 billion in the East 
European countries. 
  The lion's share of Netherlands investments was made by 
multinationals headquartered in the Netherlands. According to 
J.A.W.M. van Rooijen of KPMG Corporate Finance, their investment 
behaviour was shaped primarily by the race to beat the 
competition and profit from the low production costs and the new 
sales possibilities. For companies like Heineken, Unilever, and 
various supermarket chains, it was the latter argument that was 
decisive, van Rooijen believes. "Moreover, the study shows that 
consolidating market share was considered to be more important 
than generating quick profits," he said. 
  Netherlands companies appear to have invested for the most 
part in Hungary and the Czech Republic. Of the total amount of 
$1.3 billion invested since 1990, $449 million was invested in 
the Czech Republic (and Slovakia, which until recently was 
united with it), and $317 million was pumped into Hungary. 
During the same period, Netherlanders invested $183 million in 
Poland and $340 million in the other East European countries, 
including Russia and Kazakhstan. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By Chris Parkin, PA News] </F>
  [Text] Prospects for advancing the Northern Ireland peace 
process were examined by five British and Irish government 
ministers today against a background of continuing terrorism in 
Belfast and Dublin. 
  The ministers met near the Irish Republic's County Cavan 
border with Ulster after the opening of a restored waterway link 
between the republic and the north. 
  But before talks were under way, fresh violence in Belfast 
brought security issues back to the top of the agenda. 
  IRA gunmen killed a former regular Army soldier from the 
Shankill Road as he worked as a security guard near the city 
centre. Loyalists bombed a Sinn Fein office at Belfast City Hall 
injuring two workmen and a soldier was hurt in a blast at the 
Fort George Army base in Londonderry. 
  At the weekend in Dublin, the Loyalist Ulster Volunteer 
Force 
paramilitary organisation attacked a city centre pub being used 
by Sinn Fein for a fundraising event. 
  The ministers had planned to concentrate on political 
questions following Britain's response last week to a series of 
questions about the Downing Street peace declaration posed by 
Sinn Fein. 
  Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew and deputy 
Irish premier and foreign minister Dick Spring later said they 
pledged to maintain the current "highest ever level" of 
cross-border security co-operation to combat the terrorists. 
  Sir Patrick said what had happened in Dublin had 
demonstrated 
the problem of terrorism was one that had to be faced by the 
security forces on both sides of the border. "The highest 
degree of co-operation will be maintained between us," he said. 
  Irish Justice Minister Maire Geoghegan-Quinn, who was also 
at 
the talks, said she would be presenting a report to cabinet 
colleagues in Dublin tomorrow on the weekend shooting and 
bombing attempt. She will meet Irish Police Commissioner Patrick 
Culligan tomorrow to review security precautions being applied 
in Dublin and border areas to counter loyalist raids. 
  On the political front Sir Patrick said he had noted and was 
grateful for the "very positive Irish government response" to 
Britain's statement last week following Sinn Fein's request for 
clarification of the peace document. 
  Prime Minister John Major and Irish premier Albert Reynolds 
are to meet in London later this week to assess the development 
of their peace initiative. 
  Sir Patrick said: "Both governments stand shoulder to 
shoulder in this respect and in their attitude to Sinn Fein and 
the IRA and the use of violence for political purposes." 
  Also at today's discussions was Northern Ireland Office 
junior minister Michael Ancram who has been involved in 
behind-the-scenes talks with political leaders in Belfast in a 
bid to force a restart of the stalled inter-party talks process 
on the future of the province. 
  Mr Spring reported that a considerable amount of work had 
been done towards establishing a framework for fresh talks but 
further progress had still to be made. 
  Security measures in and around the border area fringed by 
the Irish Republic's County Cavan and Northern Ireland's County 
Fermanagh was intense from daybreak for the top-level 
get-together. 
  Sir Patrick and Mr Spring jointly declared open a canal 
connecting Northern Ireland's Lough Erne and the River Shannon 
on the southern side of the border. The canal first opened 125 
years ago but closed soon afterwards as a nautical flop. It has 
been restored at a cost of 30 million pounds in a project funded 
partly by European Union funds and backed by both the British 
and Irish governments.

  [Excerpt] [Announcer] Well, I'm joined on the line now by 
the Tanaiste [Deputy Prime Minister] Dick Spring from County 
Cavan, where he was attending the opening of the Ballyconnel 
Canal and from Belfast by the Presbyterian minister, the 
Reverend Roy McGee, who has been meeting loyalist paramilitaries 
regularly to try to wean them away from violence. First, if I 
can come to you, Tanaiste. Do you have a sense of heavy irony 
attending a cross-border project, which is aimed at 
strengthening cross-border links, in the aftermath of this 
bombing, or attempted bombing? 
  [Spring] Well, indeed, Shane, it is one of the ironies of 
the 
situation that we are here today celebrating a tremendous 
project, a north-south project, the big investment from the 
international fund for Ireland from the European Union, indeed 
both governments, and it's a tremendous opportunity for the 
locals in Fermanagh, Cavan, and Leitrim, and obviously we had 
what was, would have been another very serious situation in 
Dublin over the weekend. I have to say, though, that the Irish 
Government, with the British Government, would be very concerned 
about all instances of violence, whether they are in Dublin or 
in the north or, indeed, in the UK, and we will pursue the 
policy of cooperation between the security forces at the highest 
level to ensure that the men of violence will not be able to 
make any progress. 
  [Announcer] Did you manage to hear what Jim Molyneaux had to 
say in his interview just before you came on? 
  [Spring] I did. I listened very carefully to what James 
Molyneaux was saying. In fact, I listen very carefully at all 
times to what Mr. Molyneaux has been saying. 
  [Announcer] You heard what he said about it being the 
inevitable outcome of the Downing Street Declaration? How did 
you respond to that? 
  [Spring] I would dispute that with him, in fact, and I have 
on many occasions since the Downing Street Declaration attempted 
to draw the attention of Unionists and Loyalists, indeed, to the 
Downing Street Declaration and to the benefits for them in the 
Downing Street Declaration. Unfortunately, this has not been -- 
we have not been successful in drawing their attention to it, 
but I would also support Mr. Molyneaux's call over the weekend 
for the Loyalist paramilitaries to realize that they, too, have 
an obligation to end their part in the violence, because, 
obviously, we want violence to end from all quarters. And 
whereas efforts are being made in terms of the clarification to 
end the Provisional violence, efforts must also be made by the 
Unionist community to end the Loyalist violence as well. 
  [Announcer] Well, Jim Molyneaux has appealed for a 
cease-fire, but it does appear that there is a threat of further 
attacks. Do you agree with what the minister of justice, Maire 
Gheoghegan-Quinn, was saying that a ring of steel cannot prevent 
earnest bombers and those intent on murder getting through? 
  [Spring] Well, that obviously would be, I think, a realistic 
assessment of the situation. We obviously are going to maintain 
the highest level of security possible, both north and south, to 
ensure that we contain any threats of aggression or violence, 
and also we are going to pursue our political efforts to bring 
the talks to -- restarting the talks and to make progress. 
  [Announcer] Is there any possibility that efforts to control 
border security have been, perhaps, too relaxed in recent times, 
given the knowledge of the possibility of these attacks? 
  [Spring] No, I certainly -- perhaps, obviously it's a matter 
for the minister of justice to reply, but I can tell you from 
the government's point of view there has been no letup in our 
pursuit of the violence, or men of violence, from whatever 
quarter it comes. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Athens today lodged a harsh demarche with the 
Albanian Government on the continuing detention of the six 
leading members of the Greek minority organization Omonoia as 
well as on the unfounded and provocative accusations against 
Greece. Our correspondent Foivos Karzis reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Karzis] The Greek demarche was extremely 
strong and concerned not only the continuing detention of the 
six Omonoia leading members but also the new attempt to involve 
Greece in activities within Albania. Two of the accusations 
leveled against the six people concerned cooperating with the 
Greek secret services and conspiring to separate Albanian 
territory. Acting on instructions from Foreign Minister Karolos 
Papoulias, Ambassador Petros Angelakis, head of the Albanian 
Affairs Department at the Foreign Ministry, summoned the 
Albanian ambassador in Athens to express Greece's strong concern 
and protest over these actions. Angelakis pointed out to him 
that such actions weaken the Athens- Tirana relations. A short 
time ago, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Konstandinos Bikas pointed 
out that Tirana's options do not lead to defusing the crisis. 
  [Bikas] The Albanian Government has to realize that with the 
aforementioned actions it follows a slippery road which exposes 
it to the appropriate international organizations and does not 
render trustworthy its efforts to restore the democratic lawful 
order and the rule of law in the country, nor is it possible for 
Albania to convince anybody that it respects its international 
obligations. 
  [Karzis] Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos had 
earlier reiterated the warning to Tirana. 
  [Venizelos] Greece has depended and continues to depend on 
the improvement of Greek-Albanian relations. Greece pursues the 
respect for the rights of the Greeks in Albania and the Albanian 
Government knows this very well. 
  [Karzis] Official opposition leader Miltiadhis Evert 
approved of Greece's intervention to suspend the EU [Economic 
Union] grant to Albania while Nikolaos Konstandopoulos, chairman 
of the Coalition of the Left and of the Progress Party, called 
for mobilization at all international forums. 
  [Evert] It is a most positive step and proves that when all 
the parties get together and follow a decisive policy, a 
coordinated policy, we can really achieve much more. 
  [Konstandopoulos] I believe that in order to defend the 
Greek minority rights there should be a decisive, cool 
mobilization by Greece at all the international organizations.

<F P=106> [Report by Ioannis Loulis] </F>
  [Text] The first major poll conducted on the upcoming 
European Parliament elections gives an idea of the possible 
outcome of that election. On behalf of private station Sky, MRB 
conducted the poll from 13 to 18 May in the greater capital area 
using a sample of 1,000 voters and the ballot method. The 
information received outlines a series of critical parameters in 
the election behavior of voters. 
  First, the distance that PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist 
Movement] established from ND [New Democracy] in October's 
election appears to be decreasing. The MRB poll gives PASOK 
30.7 percent and ND 27.2 percent. The respective percentages of 
the parties in the same election district were 45.19 percent for 
PASOK and 36.46 percent for ND. As expected, the governing 
party is in the lead. 
  Second, PASOK's losses in the greater capital area come from 
both the left and the right and do not appear to be accidental. 
PASOK has lost 3.7 percent of its power to the Political 
Spring, 2.7 percent to the Coalition of the Left and Progress, 
and 1.2 percent to ND, while 8.7 percent of those who voted for 
PASOK in October are now undecided. The "unity" of PASOK voters 
(those voters who say that they will vote for their party again) 
is 78.9 percent, a percentage that is neither low nor high. 
This percentage does point out the possibility of some 
remarkable losses for PASOK. 
  Third, among all parties ND shows the highest "unity" 
percentage (83.3 percent), followed by KKE [Greek Communist 
Party] with 81.8 percent. This percentage shows that ND will 
possibly not suffer any serious losses compared to October. (If 
this happens, it will not be unnatural, given that the 
percentages that both large parties expect to receive at the 
European Parliament elections tend to be lower than those 
received in the national elections.) 
  Currently, other than its remarkable "unity" percentage, ND 
appears to have suffered some losses to the Political Spring 
(3.4 percent), while for the first time it appears to have a 
very small gain from PASOK (1.2 percent). Therefore, there is 
an initial feeling (which other polls taken closer to the 
European Parliament elections will confirm or deny) that ND has 
"clear gains" (although very small) from the movement of voters 
from and to PASOK. It is crucial for ND to minimize its losses 
to the Political Spring and increase its "gains" from PASOK. 
  Fourth, the Political Spring, with a low "unity" percentage, 
will be the big question mark in the elections. The poll gives 
it 7.1 percent in a region where it received approximately 6 
percent. As a protest party (something that has been confirmed 
by every poll before the October elections), Political Spring 
shows great movement in voters "coming" and "going." It is 
becoming clear, however, that the party is gaining more than it 
is losing. At the same time, it is also showing a greater 
percentage of undecided voters (16 percent) compared to other 
parties, something that makes safe predictions of its course 
very difficult. 
  Fifth, Coalition of the Left and Progress shows clear rising 
tendencies. Its gains come mainly from PASOK. 
  Concluding, the gap is narrowing between PASOK and ND, with 
the former one maintaining the lead position at a safe distance. 
There is also a clear tendency of the Coalition and the 
Political Spring to increase their power, a tendency that is 
notable but not impressive. In any case, the two large parties 
appear to be confirming their sovereignty despite any small 
losses, particularly those of PASOK, which do not appear to be 
accidental.

    [Editorial Report] Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's 
recent visit to the United States and meeting with President 
Bill Clinton were the subject of commentary in the Greek press. 
<H5>  Tilt to U.S. Viewed </H5>
  K.I. Angelopoulos comments in the 30 April-1 May Athens 
daily 
I KATHIMERINI on Prime Minister Papandreou's perceived foreign 
policy tilt toward the United States to the detriment of the 
European Union (EU). While Papandreou's entourage was aware he 
believed that developments in the Balkans brought Athens closer 
to Washington than to Brussels, the prime minister's recent 
visit to the United States confirmed his "spectacular" switch, 
Angelopoulos writes. Papandreou did not hide his satisfaction 
over the White House "understanding" of the Greek problems. He 
did not hesitate to express to Greek-American audiences his 
"bitterness and disappointment" at the lack of "solidarity" on 
the part of the EU. Following his meeting with President 
Clinton, Papandreou "exempted" the United States from any 
responsibility for the Yugoslav tragedy, blaming the EU instead. 
Angelopoulos comments that these developments are occurring 
during Greece's term as EU president and wonders whether the 
Skopje issue will prove "fateful" for Greek-EU relations. It is 
well-known that the views of a majority of EU partners on Balkan 
issues do not coincide with those of Athens, Angelopoulos 
continues. The country's EU partners showed from the start that 
they did not wish Greece to be the EU "representative" in the 
Balkans, with Germany, France, Great Britain, "and even Italy" 
signaling that a "new Balkan order would be their own preserve." 
Angelopoulos observes that there are risks involved in 
Papandreou's tilt toward the United States, given that the Greek 
economy depends to a great extent on EU funds. 
<H5>  Trip Results "Positive" </H5>
  According to an editorial in the 25 April Athens daily 
ELEVTHEROTIPIA, Papandreou's meeting with President Clinton 
produced "rather positive" results, tempered by problems related 
to the Cyprus issue and Greek-Turkish relations. Among the 
positive developments, the editorial continues, are President 
Clinton's acknowledgment that Greece is "rightfully" concerned 
about the Skopje issue; his statement that "we are concerned 
about the Greek minority in Albania" and his acknowledgment that 
"Greece is facing the problem with wisdom and discernment"; his 
expression of interest in the Ecumenical Patriarchate to the 
Turkish prime minister; and his acknowledgment of Greece's 
important role in the Balkans. However, the Cyprus issue 
remains unresolved, with President Clinton assigning 
responsibility for a solution to his negotiator, and 
Athens-Ankara relations are still a "puzzle" for the President, 
with him only wishing for cooperation between the two countries 
while making no mention of what Turkey should do to achieve it. 
The visit, the editorial concludes, showed that while further 
understanding and development of Greek-American relations are 
possible, reservations should be maintained. 
<H5>  Cartoons Lampoon Papandreou Policy Change </H5>
  A cartoon in the 24 April Athens KIRIAKATIKI ELEVTHEROTIPIA 
shows a disgruntled Papandreou listening to a beaming President 
Clinton stating that "Greece can play a leadership role in the 
Balkans...behind Turkey, Albania, and Skopje." Another cartoon 
in the 23 April ELEVTHEROTIPIA depicts Papandreou, accompanied 
by his wife Dhimitra, insistently and plaintively knocking on 
the White House door, calling "Biiill," after climbing a number 
of steps, each labeled with slogans progressively more friendly 
to the United States. The lowest is labeled "Americans, 
murderers of people," the next "out forever from NATO," then 
"out with the [U.S.] bases of death," followed by "the struggle 
is coming into its own," "forward for better days," and 
"Greek-American business."

<F P=106> [Erik Bjorn Moller report: "Government Expects Only Minor </F>
Delays"] 
  [Text] Even though the Swedish environment minister is 
jubilant and is predicting a new round of consultations in 
Sweden, the Danish Government tried to play down the Water 
Rights Court's surprising finding. "A minor problem," was the 
transport minister's comment. 
  The Water Rights Court's call for new calculations of the 
water through flow in the Oresund will not lead to much delay 
for the Oresund project. It is simply a case of a "minor 
problem" that will shortly be dispatched. 
  That was the optimistic comment from the government 
yesterday 
after the Swedish Water Rights Court's surprising call for new 
calculations of the Oresund project's environmental impact. 
  While Olof Johansson, the Swedish environment minister and 
an 
opponent of the bridge, was jubilant and was talking about a new 
round of consultations in Sweden, Danish Transport Minister Jan 
Trojborg (Social Democratic Party) hurried at record speed from 
a meeting of Nordic ministers in Nyborg to an emergency meeting 
of the cabinet. And later in the day he had to brief the group 
following the progress of the Oresund project on developments 
that for the time being at least have in reality deprived the 
Danish political parties that are in favor of the bridge of any 
influence over the future of the bridge. 
  Once again Danish supporters of the bridge were able to note 
that it is now "up to the Swedes," and that "we naturally expect 
them to keep their side of the bargain." 
  Trojborg even went as far as to call the Water Rights 
Court's 
ruling "a step in the right direction." However, when asked, he 
admitted that he had been hoping for a clearer pronouncement 
from the court. 
  The transport minister is convinced that the two governments 
will be able to produce the calculations that have been 
requested as early as next week: "And it is my hope that the 
Swedish Government will be able to reach a decision in the space 
of a relatively short period of time. I am expecting only 
minimal delays. Today the Swedish Government has confirmed the 
existing agreement between Denmark and Sweden. There is no 
reason to dramatize the situation." 
  According to Conservative People's Party leader Hans Engell 
"there ought to be no suggestion of significant delays." "But 
in fact we will not know anything until we find out about the 
decisionmaking process that the Swedes are contemplating. And 
we will not find this out until next week. But now we must 
apply pressure for them to keep their side of the bargain." 
  Hans Engell called the decision "surprising, because the 
experts' material was so well documented and comprehensive." He 
also dissociated himself unambiguously from Olof Johansson's 
remarks about a new round of consultation in Sweden. 
  "This would be a very unfriendly act toward Denmark," Engell 
said. 
  Not unexpectedly, the Socialist People's Party, the Radical 
Liberals, the Progress Party, and the Christian People's Party 
exploited the court's pronouncement to underline once again the 
hostile view they take of the bridge. "Halt all construction 
activity now. We now have the court's word that the project is 
far from being as well founded or as environmentally neutral as 
the parties in favor of the bridge have claimed hitherto," the 
Socialist People's Party's Steen Gade said. 
  The Christian People's Party's Ole M. Nielsen said that a 
new 
investigation into the impact of the bridge will be one of the 
party's new demands in any negotiations to reach agreement on a 
possible future government base. He is considering a proposal 
that all the parties opposed to a bridge should enter into a 
sort of musketeer agreement -- all for one and one for all -- so 
that regardless of which party is involved in the negotiations 
to produce a government platform, it will demand a new 
investigation of the bridge.

Defense System Not To Be Changed"] 
  [Excerpt] Commander in Chief and President Martti Ahtisaari 
noted in his first order of the day that Finland's defense is 
based on an independent and believable national defense 
capacity, and it does not require any changes to the current 
system, but instead needs careful and goal-oriented development 
work. 
  "This decade has shown that the changes are unpredictable 
and 
the reform difficult to foresee. Therefore, the words of Field 
Marshal Augustin Ehrensvard, which are inscribed at the entrance 
to the coastal fortification Suomenlinna, still hold true: 
`Coming generations, stand on your own feet and do not trust 
help from outside!'" [passage omitted]

Tuesday [26 April], that such a debate should have taken place

  Ahtisaari said that he had not noticed Vayrynen's comments

  "This is the opinion of a single citizen, who, of course, is

<F P=106> [Article by Arja Nukarinen: "EU Opponents Publish </F>
Periodical"] 
  [Text] Last Tuesday [26 April], a new periodical began to 
appear in Finland. The paper addresses people who are 
dissatisfied with Finnish society, and who are especially 
opposed to membership in the European Union [EU]. The paper, THE 
CITIZEN IS ON YOUR SIDE, is scheduled to be published monthly. 
It will primarily be distributed through direct sales on streets 
and in marketplaces. 
  The paper will be published by the Helsinki-based Citizen 
Cooperative, which will be founded during the latter part of 
May. Until then, the paper's financial affairs are being handled 
by Sirkka Korhonen, from Nurmes, and Eero Taivalsaari, from 
Helsinki, who came up with the idea for the paper, and who are 
both opponents of EU membership. 
  According to editor in chief Taivalsaari, the intention is 
not to stop the publication of the paper after the popular 
referendum regarding the EU. Based on Taivalsaari's 
calculations, 13,000 issues of the paper would need to be sold, 
in order for the paper to remain financially viable. 
  When announcing the birth of the new paper, Taivalsaari 
stated the reason for producing such a publication to be the 
lack of public debate about alternative solutions. The paper 
declares itself to be politically unaligned, although 
Taivalsaari admits that its ideology "fairly closely" originates 
from issues put forth by the Finnish People's Independence Front. 
  Among others, Korhonen, who is one of the paper's central 
backstage figures, is active within the Finnish People's 
Independence Front. Ella Karki-Sormunen, who is responsible for 
marketing the paper, is secretary general for the Independence 
Front.

<F P=106> [Article by Arja Nukarinen: "SKP(Y) Brings Back Communist </F>
Party -- In Party Program Draft, Revolution Based on Citizen 
Power and Freedom"] 
  [Text] The minority communist faction Finnish Communist 
Party-Unity, SKP(Y), has set out to build a new Finnish 
communist party. At the end of the year, in connection with the 
party congress, a decision will be made on how to continue from 
here with the bankrupt Finnish Communist Party (SKP). 
  Last Thursday [21 April], SKP(Y) made public a new draft for 
a party program. The draft emphasizes "a new kind of socialism 
and a humane civilization." 
<H5>  Revolutionary Goal Still Alive </H5>
  According to Yrjo Hakanen, chairman of the SKP(Y), who 
presented the draft, the goal of a socialist revolution is still 
intact. However, the collapse of the USSR has changed the 
concept of revolution. Hakanen noted that we learned from the 
example of the USSR that seizing power is not the same thing as 
implementing socialism. 
  "We need the creation of a fundamentally different 
democratic 
use of power in our society. For example, based on the 
experiences in the USSR, there has been an inclination to view 
matters strictly from the perspective of the state and the 
governing of the state. We want to emphasize the use of power by 
individuals themselves. The development of individual ways of 
influencing and a new type of society of citizens is 
unavoidable." 
  According to Hakanen, it is not enough anymore to move into 
the government or to be part of the state machinery. "It is easy 
then for matters to move out of the control of the citizens, and 
thus there is a tendency for events to turn against people." 
  SKP(Y) proposes a "new and radical program." According to 
this, markets and capital flow should be subjected to democratic 
guidance, the banks should be nationalized, and workers should 
be given greater opportunities for influence. The government 
should be turned into a "government of democratic change, which 
would be guided by the needs of people and not by the 
requirements of the markets." 
<H5>  Six-Hour Workday </H5>
  According to the program, the general workday should be 
shortened to six hours. Thus employment will improve. Shortening 
the workday without decreasing earnings is possible, according 
to the program, as work would become more productive and profits 
would be distributed in a new manner. Individual companies 
would, among other things, be responsible for the employment of 
people. Correspondingly, society would ensure that companies 
could continue to operate. 
<H5>  Cooperation Instead of Alliances </H5>
  Existing gender-based inequities should be eliminated, by, 
among other ways, eliminating the division between male and 
female work in the job market. 
  According to the program, the public sector should be in the 
forefront of implementing equality. The size of the public 
sector should not be reduced. Instead, it would be its function 
to develop employment, regional democracy, and environmentally 
safe technologies, as well as guaranteeing citizens a high level 
of social services. 
  On the international scene, the renewed SKP would like to 
develop Finland's policy of neutrality, which has "traditions 
that still contain much of value and worth developing." As 
examples of this are mentioned an active role in resolving 
conflicts proactively and peacefully, as well as the development 
of a good cooperative relationship with Russia. 
  The program would reject membership in the European Union 
[EU], as this would avoid "supporting the development of new 
opposing political blocs and unequal structures." The program 
suggests that the security of Europe could be ensured by 
promoting disarmament and by dismantling "remnants of the Cold 
War, such as NATO." 
<H5>  Final Program Taking Form </H5>
  A decision will be made regarding SKP's program, in 
connection with the party congress at the end of the year. The 
communists want to debate the matter, based on which the final 
program will take shape. The new program will replace SKP's old 
program. 
  According to Hakanen, the date of the party congress will 
not 
be set until the date of the popular referendum regarding 
membership in the EU is known. Because of the campaign against 
the EU, the party leadership does not want to take any chances 
by having the congress convene around the time of the plebiscite. 
  Hakanen stated that SKP(Y)'s view is that if the party 
congress accepts their concepts, there will be no need for a 
separate SKP(Y) any more, and "the communists in this country 
will act in the name of SKP."

  [Text] Staff Headquarters and the Defense Ministry have 
found mutual ground on the development of new ways to administer 
the Armed Forces, and on the spending cuts that will result 
thereby. Elisabeth Rehn, the minister of defense, and Jan 
Klenberg, commander of the Armed Forces, made a joint

administration during peacetime. The presentation included 
unveiling the program that will be followed in applying 
scientific principles of management to develop the Armed Forces. 
  The program deals with developments to be implemented for 
the 
21st century during the years 1996-97. The primary purpose in 
these implementations is not to decrease the number of 
employees, but deliberate reorganization of staff and operations. 
  Up until now less than 200 employees of the Armed Forces 
have 
been dismissed from their jobs, mainly in the armories. Other 
dismissals were prevented by the government's job contract 
negotiations. 
  The program that has now been adopted will mean a certain 
amount of staff transfers, according to Rehn, but hardly any 
dismissals. Personnel reductions will be achieved mainly by the 
natural departure from the work force by individuals. "The 
personnel will not come to suffer hard times," promised Rehn. 
  According to Admiral Klenberg, clarity on the issue has been 
especially important for Armed Forces personnel. The agreed-upon 
program is not what everybody wanted, "but even a difficult 
decision is better than continued confusion on the issue," said 
Klenberg. 
  After the government asked for designated funds, the defense 
ministry drafted a streamlining program for the land forces in 
1992. This program would have closed 15 military bases. Staff 
headquarters agreed to the main points of the ministry spending 
cuts proposal. 
  According to staff headquarters, the spending cuts are only 
part of the reason for reorganization. While the number of 
conscripts has been reduced from 40,000 to about 30,000, the 
organization is still dimensioned according to the higher number 
of conscripts. 
<H5>  Concentrations and Transfers </H5>
  The Armed Forces Training Development Center will be moved 
to 
Tuusula in 1996. 
  The operation of the Iisalmi, Kuopio, Vammala, and Ahtari 
armories will be changed according to scientific management 
principles in a way that has already been agreed upon. 
<H5>  Land Forces Troop Units </H5>
  The training of reserve officers needs to be kept, 
principally, as one entity. Reserve officer training methods 
will be developed in Hamina. 
  Part of the infantry training conducted in Oulu will be 
transferred to Kajaani. Conscript training will be terminated in 
Ylamylly, and be transferred to Kontioranta and Mikkeli. 
Infantry units in Helsinki will be consolidated. 
<H5>  Field Artillery </H5>
  The main training center for the field artillery will be 
reorganized at the Niinisalo Field Artillery Brigade. 
  The field artillery units will remain in the Light Infantry 
Brigade, Kainuu Brigade, Karjala Brigade, Armored Brigade and 
the Uusimaa Brigade. 
<H5>  Antiaircraft </H5>
  The Kymi Antiaircraft Regiment will cease to operate as an 
independent unit. The Salpausselka Antiaircraft Batteries will 
become a unit within the Reserve Officer's Training Center. 
<H5>  Combat Engineers </H5>
  Operations will be concentrated primarily in four units: in 
Sakyla, Keuruu, Valkeala, and Oulu. Combat engineer training in 
Kontioranta will be terminated during 1994. 
<H5>  Signal Corps </H5>
  The training for the Signal Corps will be primarily 
concentrated in Riihimaki, Keuruu, and Oulu. Separate Signal 
Corps companies in Turku and Mikkeli will be terminated. 
<H5>  Maintenance and Supply </H5>
  Maintenance and Supply training will be concentrated in 
Lahti. The Weapons Training site will be transferred from 
Kokkola to Lahti during 1996. 
<H5>  Northern Defense Zone </H5>
  The training and maintenance and supply organization of the 
Northern Defense Zone will be concentrated at four bases 
including Kajaani, Rovaniemi, and Sodankyla. A unit for training 
infantry, combat engineer, and signal corps training will be 
formed in Oulu. Part of Oulu's training mission will be 
transferred to Kajaani. 
  Northern Finland's Signal Corps Battalion will be reassigned 
to the Pohja Brigade by 1997. 
<H5>  Eastern Defense Zone </H5>
  The training and maintenance and supply organization of the 
Eastern Defense Zone will be formed at eight different bases. 
  The Kymi Antiaircraft Regiment will be terminated as an 
independent unit. The Salpausselka Antiaircraft Batteries will 
be an attached unit of the Reserve Officers' Training Center. 
  Conscript training in Ylamylly will be terminated by the end 
of 1997. 
  Parts of the Paratrooper and Military Police training, plus 
the Transport Flight Squadron, will be united to form a Special 
Forces Training Center in Utti in 1997. 
<H5>  Western Defense Zone </H5>
  One infantry unit, (the Kaarti Light Infantry Regiment) will 
be formed in the Helsinki area. 
  Scientific management practices will be applied to the 
operations of the Helsinki Antiaircraft Regiment. The

Fleet will be reorganized as the Support Flight Fleet and based 
in Tikkakoski and Utti. 
<H5>  Navy </H5>
  A study will be made on possible savings resulting from the 
proposed transfer of the Naval Combat Training Center to the 
naval units themselves. 
  The gunship fleet, the guided missile array of the gunship

<F P=106> [Article by Erkki Paanannen: "Niinisalo Artillery Brigade </F>
Would Take All Reservists"] 
  [Text] Kankaanpaa -- During their formulation, the rank and 
file heard only bits and pieces of information on the 
reorganization plans for the Armed Forces. A description of the 
situation is given in the comment by Major General Hannu Sarkio, 
commander of the Turku-Pori Military Province, after the 
official news release: "A sigh of relief is being breathed in 
many a unit today." 
  The artillery brigade in Niinisalo is one of the units that 
is satisfied with the results. "We are especially pleased with 
the description: a large and multipurpose training center," said 
Colonel Esa Tarvainen, the brigade commander. "We have already 
begun developing in that direction." 
  The artillery brigade trains almost half of the artillery 
conscripts, and the Kankaanpaa Battery trains approximately 70 
percent of the reservists with this military occupation 
specialty. This is about 2,000 men annually in each group. 
  "Already at this time we could train all of the artillery 
reservists, or about 3,000 men per year," said Tarvainen. 
  Niinisalo was changed into a training center last year when 
all of the units at the base were consolidated into an artillery 
brigade. There are about 500 persons on duty there, and that is 
sufficient for the current mission. 
  The changes will be toughest for instructors at the UN 
training center operated under the supervision of the Defense 
Ministry. The responsibility for training international military 
observers, for example, has grown enormously. When the course 
was initiated, there was one class per year, and now a total of 
200 officers in five different classes are trained yearly. 
  The biggest problems for the brigade involve maintenance and 
supply. The buildings are old, built at various times, and 
operating the mess hall and the central warehouse, for example, 
is expensive. 
  Building a mess hall is in the ministry's plan. Tarvainen 
estimates that modernizing supply and maintenance facilities 
will cut expenses considerably, and that as many as 30 persons 
could be transferred from maintenance to training duties.

<F P=106> [Hans Strandberg report: "Bridge Consortium Meets With a </F>
Rebuff"] 
  [Excerpt] The Water Rights Court does not consider that 
the bridge consortium has demonstrated that the link across the 
Oresund does meet the criteria for a so-called zero solution 
with regard to the flow of water into the Baltic Sea, but 
asserts nevertheless that such a zero solution is achievable. 
  The court's pronouncement yesterday -- its second on the 
Oresund link -- will delay construction, perhaps until after the 
election, and is open to differing interpretations -- as was 
rapidly demonstrated. First provincial governor Ann-Cathrine 
Haglund: 
  "The important thing is that the Water Rights Court has said 
that a zero solution is technically possible." 
  Then Berith Cavallin of the Skane Nature Protection League: 
  "I think that this is a clear message to the government that 
it is time to say `no' to the Oresund bridge." 
  The court has remained firm on its demand for an absolute, 
mathematical zero solution -- that is, that the bridge should in 
no way reduce the inflow of oxygen and salt into the Baltic Sea, 
in order not to disturb the ecology of the Baltic Sea. 
  Thinking hitherto has been that building the bridge itself 
will slow down water through flow by 0.5 percent, and that the 
channel should then be dredged to reduce this figure to zero. 
The Water Rights Court is now saying that the bridge consortium 
has not produced figures that demonstrate that the present 
configuration of the link achieves this figure of 0.5 percent. 
  This means that there is a risk, the court claims, that the 
bridge consortium will not achieve the zero solution or the 
demand for a maximum of 7 million cubic meters of dredged 
material. 
  But even if this is the case, the court is nevertheless 
saying "yes" in principle and is proposing, for example, that 
the water inflow on the Danish side be increased by shortening 
one of the artificial islands south of Saltholm by 900 meters. 
  Nature does not always behave as in theory and this is why 
it 
is impossible to check whether a zero solution really has been 
achieved until the bridge is built. The Water Rights Court is 
therefore repeating its demand that two independent research 
institutes should undertake detailed simulations of water and 
salt flow. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Elisabeth Crona report: "Johansson Views Ruling as a </F>
Victory"] 
  [Excerpt] Prime Minister Carl Bildt (Moderate Coalition 
Party) is clearly disappointed with the Water Rights Court's 
ruling and clearly irritated that the bridge consortium did not 
provide the court with the full figures. 
  The matter must now be settled as soon as possible, he 
declared at a news conference yesterday afternoon. At the same 
time he reiterated that the new supplementary investigation must 
not be "a rushed and slovenly job." 
  Yesterday, Carl Bildt was several times in contact with 
Danish Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen (Social Democratic 
Party). Their comments have been restrained in tone and well 
coordinated. 
  But according to information received by SVENSKA DAGBLADET, 
the Danish Government is extremely impatient that the go-ahead 
from Sweden is taking such a long time. 
  Every time there is a new delay the Danish media show 
pictures of the places where hundreds of houses have already 
been demolished to make way for the bridge and interviews with 
unhappy former house owners. 
  At the same time internal Danish criticism is growing. And 
Denmark, like Sweden, will hold elections in the fall. 
  However, Center Party leader and Environment Minister Olof 
Johansson is happy and while on an election tour visiting a high 
school in Harnosand commented as follows on the court's 
pronouncement: 
  "This is something of a victory for the Center Party," he 
said, speaking of a "rebuff for the consortium," a new round of 
consultations, and a possible decision as late as this fall, 
perhaps after the election. 
  Carl Bildt responded by saying that the question of a new 
round of consultations has by no means been decided and that he 
dislikes Johansson's talk of victory. 
  Johansson is confusing his roles, the prime minister hinted: 
  "If he is approaching the issue in party political terms, 
this could bring him into conflict with his responsibility as 
the minister who must deal with the matter." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [From the "Radio Newsreel:" Limassol Dispatch by Sotiroula </F>
Khristofidhou--recorded] 
  [Text] [Khristofidhou] President Glavkos Kliridhis said 
today that any attempt to alter the 21 March document would 
release us from our acceptance of it. The President made this 
warning clear today in an address at a luncheon hosted by the 
Limassol Bar Association. The topic of his speech was on the 
latest developments in the Cyprus issue. Mr. Kliridhis stressed 
in his address that the Turkish side is trying to avoid the 
implementation of the confidence-building measures [CBM's], but 
without being condemned for its intransigence. He added the 
Turkish side is taking advantage of the delayed release of the 
UN secretary general's report to create the impression that it 
has accepted the 21 March document. By asking for 
clarifications for points of the document, the Turkish side is 
actually attempting to alter them, President Kliridhis stressed 
and then warned: 
  [Kliridhis] I have told the United Nations and I say again 
that we abandoned certain stipulations that we wanted under the 
condition that the Turkish side would also accept the document 
as is. Any attempt to alter the 21 March document by Mr. Rauf 
Denktas or Turkey, would release us from our acceptance of it. 
Despite our reservations, for the sake of progress in the 
Cyprus issue, we accept the document as it is. 
  [Khristofidhou] The president then called upon the United 
Nations to submit the report without any further delay and 
warned: 
  [Kliridhis] I would also like to stress that we have both 
protested and stressed that these delaying tactics do not find 
us in agreement. They say they are not postponing it to see 
whether or not the Turkish side will accept it. I would like to 
inform them that we are not children, some of us have long 
familiarity with how the United Nations operates, and that we 
are not sure if this is so. For a while, it was true that the 
secretary general was away from his headquarters and he needs to 
approve the final form of the report, but I think this excuse no 
longer exists. I am not convinced that the report will be 
translated into various languages and I publicly call upon the 
United Nations to submit its report without any further delay as 
I have also called upon it in private. 
  [Khristofidhou] Mr. Kliridhis further pointed out that the 
Cyprus issue has reached a crossroads which should make both the 
Greek Cypriot side and the Security Council ponder. The 
president stressed: The time has come for the Security Council 
to think of alternative ways of promoting a Cyprus solution, 
given the fact that the other side follows filibustering 
tactics. Referring to the significance of the European element, 
President Kliridhis said that we must convince Europe that only 
when Turkey realizes that talks on Cyprus' accession have begun 
will it then abandon any expansionist designs on Cyprus in that 
such designs could not be realized if Cyprus is a member of a 
united Europe. 
  Referring to the Turkish policy, Mr. Kliridhis said that the 
Turkish side is not interested in a Cyprus solution but in a 
period of avoiding a solution and also perpetuating the problem 
with the aim of having the pseudostate recognized or, at a later 
stage, the recognition of a federation. President Kliridhis 
also added in his speech that we are not seeing light at the end 
of the tunnel of the Cyprus problem due to the lack of political 
will by the Turkish side. He stressed: It is necessary for the 
Security Council to adopt the appropriate measures which would 
create the prerequisites for the Turkish side to acquire 
political will.

  [Text] There is no information that Turkish Cypriot leader 
Rauf Denktas has accepted the confidence-building measures 
[CBM's] and there is no reason for the UN secretary general to 
delay his report to the Security Council. The report is 
expected to be submitted next week. 
  In a telephone conversation this morning, Gustave Feissel, 
the UN secretary general's alternate special representative in 
Cyprus, reiterated this statement to President Glavkos 
Kliridhis. Government Spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said the 
president contacted Feissel to find out if the UN secretary 
general would delay his report. He added that Kliridhis made it 
clear to Feissel that he has accepted the 21 March UN document 
as is and that he will not accept any changes either in the form 
of interpretations or clarifications. President Kliridhis 
stressed that the 21 March document is crystal clear in its 
contents.

<F P=106> [Report by Anthos Likavyis] </F>
  [Text] The postponement or at least the delay in the 
expected submission of the UN secretary general's report as well 
as contradictory information on a possible positive Turkish 
Cypriot response to the confidence-building measures, create 
uncertainty and much confusion. 
  And all the above, despite assurances given to President 
Glavkos Kliridhis by Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's 
deputy special representative in Cyprus. That is because the 
American element continues intensive interjections for more 
positive developments. 
  In light of the above, this week is described as 
particularly 
critical, because: 
  The government considers it certain that a Turkish maneuver, 
which could take the form of some "conditional" acceptance of 
the UN document, is imminent. 
  An authoritative source close to President Kliridhis told O 
FILELEVTHEROS yesterday: "Something is happening backstage and 
the U.S. positions unfolding after the impasse cannot be 
considered accidental." Under the pressure of this information, 
which causes concern, and the American statements in particular, 
the president was forced to warn the United Nations, through 
Feissel, that he will accept no amendments to the 21 March 
document, "either in the form of interpretation or in the form 
of clarification." 
  President Kliridhis' exact warning is a sign that "something 
is happening" backstage and that something is being prepared 
based on the "progress" achieved in Vienna! 
  Informed diplomatic sources reveal that this progress, noted 
by the U.S. State Department spokesman, relates to some 
interpretations that "balance" other interpretations and satisfy 
[Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf] Denktas somewhat. These 
"balancing interpretations" concern: 
  First, the "ownership" of territory that will be used for 
access to Famagusta and methods of supervising it. 
  Second, the operational structure of Nicosia Airport, the 
status of the "Turkish Cypriot Airways" and the regulations 
governing the taxation of imported goods. 
  Third, the time, and particularly the coordination, of 
settlement in the area north of Dhimokratias Avenue, in relation 
to the reopening of the Nicosia Airport, in light of the new 
arrangements. 
  The pseudostate's so-called "Council of Ministers" will meet 
in the presence of Denktas tomorrow to finalize its decisions in 
view of the extraordinary meeting of the pseudoparliament the 
following day. Ankara let it be known that the pseudoparliament 
will accept the package of confidence-building measures! This 
is contrary to the impression created by a section of the 
Turkish Cypriot press, thus making the confusion even stronger. 
  Nicosia considers that the process of the 
confidence-building 
measures has indeed ended but does not cease to have 
particularly strong worries that in time and due to the 
uncertainty, the Turkish responsibility will seem less severe. 
  Decisive developments though, which will clarify the 
situation, will occur in the coming days.

<F P=106> [Report by Andreas Khatzikiriakos] </F>
  [Text] The negative prospects for a quick solution to the 
Cyprus issue have resulted in discussions at the European Union 
[EU] headquarters on radical scenarios for the accession of 
Cyprus, or part of it, to the EU. 
  The EU bureaucracy in Brussels appears positive regarding 
Cyprus' accession to the Union, as long as this does not bring 
it into confrontation with Turkey, does not get it involved in 
the Cyprus issue, and provided structural changes within the EU 
have proceeded to a conclusion. 
  Despite all the above reservations, there are thoughts about 
the accession of Cyprus to the EU through Greece, or the 
clarification and amendment of the German formula for the Cyprus 
case. It appears that what the EU will not accept is the 
existence of two clearly Greek states with the same prerogatives 
(presidency-veto). 
  A source in Brussels who favors Nicosia's positions has told 
O FILELEVTHEROS that what the Cyprus Government should make 
clear is that Cyprus itself would agree to have the free areas 
alone join the EU if there is no solution to the Cyprus issue. 
  Regarding the Cyprus Government's demand for talks with the 
EU to begin as quickly as possible, the Brussels bureaucracy 
appears to have divided views. 
  There are some who support the beginning of some kind of 
talks in 1995, but not necessarily accession talks. On the 
other hand, others feel that the EU should limit itself to a 
statement regarding expansion that will satisfy Cyprus and Malta 
but will have no practical effect at this stage. 
  In general, it is thought that Germany's presidency 
[beginning in July 1994] will prove decisive for the EU's 
relations with Cyprus and Turkey because the EU-Turkey Accession 
Council will convene in the second half of this year, when 
deliberations that are expected to lead to full customs 
association between Turkey and the EU in 1995 will be 
intensified.

  [Text] Nicosia, May 19 (CNA)--Cyprus Communications and 
Works Minister Adhamos Adhamidhis left Thursday [19 May] for 
Moscow on an eight-day visit, at the invitation by his Russian 
counterpart. 
  Adhamidhis, who is accompanied by his ministry's permanent 
secretary Kiriakos Khristofi, will have meetings with the 
Russian minister of transport and the director general of the 
Department of Air Transport to discuss prospects for further 
development of air links between the two countries, an official 
press release said Thursday. 
  During his visit, Adhamidhis will also have official talks 
with the Russian Federation minister of communications which are 
expected to focus on issues of mutual interest, including postal 
and telecommunications services. 
  The Cypriot minister will see the mayor of the Russian 
capital and other government officials. 
  Russia and Cyprus have enhanced their relations in the 
recent 
past in tourism and joint ventures. Several Russian offshore 
units operate from Cyprus while the national carriers, Aeroflot 
and Cyprus Airways, have recently struck a cooperation agreement. 
  Adhamidhis will return to Cyprus next Thursday.

<F P=106> [Speech by President-elect Roman Herzog after winning the </F>
election in Berlin -- live] 
  [Text] Madame President, ladies and gentlemen: It is a 
moving hour for me. Over the past few days, it has repeatedly 
been recalled how the last presidential election that was held 
here in Berlin in the Reichstag building took place in March 
1969. Many of you may not know it, but, at that time, my wife 
and I were citizens of West Berlin and we saw how the GDR 
Government closed the roads leading into Berlin for a few hours, 
even though no one knew how long it would really take at that 
time. We never considered it possible that we would live to see 
an event like this again. 
  It is a miracle. It is a miracle that we are experiencing, 
and we -- I above all -- are very grateful to you, to those who 
voted for me and to those who were unable to vote for me, that 
this has become possible. I deliberately address those who 
refused to vote for me for their own good reasons. I will try 
to conduct my office in such a way that in the end, they will 
regret not having voted for me. [laughter, applause] 
  Let me say a few words to my fellow candidates. For many 
months, there were four of us and we were in constant contact 
with each other. We had a good relationship. I do not claim 
that I did not want to receive the majority, but I would not 
have been envious of any of the three others -- and this is not 
just an attitude; I really mean it. I also thank them for the 
way in which we dealt with each other over the past few months. 
I believe that what we did was a good piece of democracy, and 
it is never wrong if, in a state like ours, things go this way. 
My cordial thanks and respect to all of you. 
  I will do everything -- even though this is only a formula, 
as you know -- to be the president of all Germans. [applause] 
  In our state and in our society, there are many borders that 
run through us -- borders of conviction, borders of origin, 
borders of historical experience, borders also of economic 
interest, but, ladies and gentlemen, there are innumerable 
things that we all have in common, which does not always become 
clear in the controversy of the parties and in the controversy 
of the large associations, but which must be clear so that this 
state and this liberal society continue to exist and are able to 
act. I will do everything to stress these unifying things, 
these things that unite us all here in this hall and those who 
are represented by us. 
  Our path into the future is more uncertain than it was five 
or 10 years ago. The future that we are moving into is 
difficult. It is not predictable without any problems as it 
used to be for some decades in the past. However, ladies and 
gentlemen, we Germans have the strength, we Europeans have the 
strength to find this way and to follow it. We should never 
doubt that, and we should never hide this fact. It is part of 
our life. If we did not have this hope, we would not be able to 
follow the path that we are facing. 
  I say this in particular referring to the irritations that 
arise today from the difficulties in the wake of German 
reunification. I address the citizens of the former FRG, who 
now must make many sacrifices. Ladies and gentlemen, I cannot 
spare telling you again and again: This is the compensation for 
an injustice of international history, which was committed by 
coincidence at the Elbe border. [applause] 
  On this side and the other side of the old Wall there lived 
Germans. On this side and the other side of the old Wall, there 
lived industrious, imaginative, and creative people -- and the 
ones progressed more quickly, and the others did not. The ones 
did so because the Americans helped them, which we do not want 
to forget in this hour [applause] and, therefore, ladies and 
gentlemen, because they had a political system that promoted the 
fruits of their industriousness and did not again and again ruin 
them and hinder them. This was an injustice of history, and 
those who were favored by this injustice have the moral duty now 
to create a balance. 
  I also want to address the people in the new laender. They 
must understand that they are not a burden for us but an 
enrichment. [applause] 
  They are contributing incredible things -- in terms of 
experiences, which we in the West did not have. They lived in a 
completely different world, in which many things were more 
humane than in our world, in which many things were completely 
different. They contribute experiences from their professions. 
Treasures are lying fallow there, which must be dug out again 
and on which these people can rely. We must be happy -- and I 
am happy -- that they are with us again. [applause] 
  Madame President, ladies and gentlemen, over the next five 
years, I want to represent Germany as it really is -- 
peace-loving; freedom-living; capable; trying, at least, for 
justice; ready for solidarity; tolerant; open to the world; and, 
which almost seems to be the most important thing for me, ladies 
and gentlemen, easygoing. [applause] We Germans have not always 
been easygoing. One certainly cannot claim that. We have 
managed relatively well to eliminate this tenseness of the late 
nation. It is my greatest concern today that this tenseness 
might return, and we must counter this, perhaps also by some 
elegant formulations, by some casual words. This Germany must 
play its role in the world, but it must be easygoing and must 
not show its teeth. This is the most important thing that we 
have to do over the next few decades. [applause] 
  Just as I began with a personal reminiscence, I would like 
to 
close with a personal reminiscence, ladies and gentlemen. I 
began my career almost 30 years ago in this city in West Berlin, 
as it was called at that time. Then I moved around for 25 
years. Your vote has now brought me back to this city, which I 
have never stopped loving. I thank you. Berlin, I am back 
again. [applause]

<F P=106> [Interview with President-elect Roman Herzog by Klaus </F>
Bresser and Klaus-Peter Siegloch in Berlin -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Bresser] Congratulations on your election, Mr. 
Herzog, and thank you very much for coming to us in this news 
office so quickly after your reception. You have been elected 
president by the representatives of the Christian Democratic 
Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] and large parts of the 
Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP]. They represent one half 
of the republic. What are you going to tell the other half now? 
  [Herzog] What I said in my brief acceptance speech: The 
president has the task of representing all parties, all groups 
of the population. I fully understand that one part of the 
Federal Assenbly did not consider me the most suitable 
representative of their views. However, as I have had to do and 
liked to do over the past 10 years as a constitutional judge, I 
will try to be there for everyone and, as it has been said, 
stand above the parties and establish understanding where it is 
necessary and possible, given the weak powers of the president. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Siegloch] From politicians of the Social Democratic Party 
of Germany [SPD], one hears that the president has been elected 
against the desire of the population, which has been deduced 
from many polls. Is this irritating? 
  [Herzog] It is indeed irritating, I must admit that. 
However, you know, on the other hand, I must say that if we had 
conducted a six-month presidential election campaign, I would 
have been just as well-known [as SPD candidate Rau], and if I 
had been as well-known as one of the leading SPD politicians 
without such an election campaign, I would not have properly 
fulfilled my previous office, whose main task it is not to 
constantly appear in public. This was included in the 
conditions, so to speak. 
  [Bresser] This election was characterized by party tactics 
and power interests. This was the case already in past 
elections. However, today this is particularly true in view of 
the forthcoming Bundestag elections. If this election is now 
contrary to the wishes of the majority of the people, does this 
have consequences for you? For instance, if you run again for 
president in five years, would you then advocate a direct 
election by the people? 
  [Herzog] I have always been of the view -- and this is not 
an ad hoc invention, as my latest comprehensive, printed 
statement on this matter dates back to 1985 -- that two things 
must be clarified if one wants to do that: First, the president 
would have to have quite different powers in this case. A 
president who conducts a six-month election campaign all over 
the country and is then supported by more than half of the 
people and their votes and who then notes that he has only the 
few powers that the Basic Law gives him would simply not be able 
to stand this psychologically. 
  [Siegloch] But would you want it? Would you want to be the 
president elected by the people? 
  [Herzog] Yes, I would very much want that, but not for the 
price that afterwards the powers are missing. 
  [Siegloch] The example of Austria would not convince you? 
  [Herzog] No, precisely that would not convince me. 
  [Siegloch] Thus, powers first and then popular election? 
  [Herzog] Yes, but I am not calling for the powers. 
  [Siegloch] And, therefore, not for popular election? 
  [Herzog] This is the essential point. Of course, one can 
topple the Basic Law and establish a presidential democracy, as 
in France or in the United States, but our parliamentary 
democracy -- regardless of the bugs it occasionally shows -- has 
basically worked well. Why should one now create a completely 
new constitutional structure? And then, think of one thing. If 
we four candidates had attacked each other in a real election 
campaign all over the country for the past six months, how would 
the person elected today by the people be able on 1 July to make 
it clear to the people that he is there for everyone. This is a 
completely different situation. 
  [Bresser] But the past few weeks have shown that the people 
want such a popular election, that they do want it. Does one 
not have to draw consequences from that, at least think about 
whether one should change the Basic Law? 
  [Herzog] One has to discuss this rationally, also with the 
people. I understand this quite well. 
  [Siegloch] Thus, the last word has not been spoken, in your 
view? The matter must just be clarified? 
  [Herzog] I repeat: powers and popular election or no powers 
and no popular election. At the moment, I really do not see any 
reason to turn our entire constitutional system inside out just 
because this is fashionable now. 
  [Siegloch] Very different men have held this office: 
Theodor Heuss, Gustav Heinemann, and Richard von Weizsaecker. 
Whom do you think you are closest to regarding the way you will 
fulfill this office? 
  [Herzog] These are all very great names and it would be 
difficult for me at the moment to compare myself with one of 
them. Probably, the situation that we are facing can be best 
compared with the one that Theodor Heuss was facing. 
  [Bresser] Why? 
  [Herzog] Under Theodor Heuss, the FRG was established anew; 
it entered a very difficult international situation, and now we 
are certainly in a far easier, but similar situation of 
upheaval, as well as at the international level. This large 
Germany is currently having problems, but must find a completely 
new role in the world as soon as the problems are overcome, 
which I do not doubt. I am not speaking about Bundeswehr 
missions -- this matter has been sent to Karlsruhe and must be 
decided there -- but I mean that quite in general. Of course, 
this Germany, which is watched a bit suspiciously -- and rightly 
so for obvious reasons -- currently needs a representative who, 
similar to Theodor Heuss, shows -- also with a certain bonhomie 
-- that Germany is now different than some textbooks say. I 
mentioned the term easy-going before. 
  [Siegloch] Is this some kind of slogan for your office? 
  [Herzog] This is very important to me. 
  [Bresser] You are talking about being easy-going; you are 
talking about bonhomie. But do you not also want to utilize the 
leeway that the Basic Law -- and you participated in writing the 
comment on the Basic Law -- leaves to the president? And where 
would you prefer to use it? 
  [Herzog] This will not change. There is not anything new in 
this field. The president has powers of decisionmaking in case 
of a permanent government crisis, if the Bundestag is no longer 
able to elect a chancellor with the chancellor's majority or 
keep him in office. In this situation, the president has a few 
powers of decisionmaking -- you know, appointing a minority 
chancellor or dissolving the Bundestag and announcing new 
elections, which cannot be repeated at will. 
  [Siegloch] All this might happen on 16 October. 
  [Herzog] Yes, of course, but all these are things that I 
hope will not happen. Then there remains the power to check the 
laws that must be signed as to their constitutionality. You 
know how this was done by the previous president. Everyone used 
this right once, if at all. This is quite correct because the 
president can sign only an entire law or not sign it at all. If 
he has constitutional reservations regarding one stipulation in 
a long law, he will not be well-advised to refuse to sign the 
entire law, but he will probably sign it -- as many of the 
presidents expressly stated -- to make it possible to go to 
Karlsruhe, because the Federal Constitutional Court can examine 
an individual stipulation and, if necessary, declare it 
unconstitutional and null and void. This will not change much, 
and these are basically the president's powers. Anything else 
involves representation, giving an example, and making speeches. 
This is, in my view, the attraction of this office. 
  [Siegloch] Nevertheless, the relationship between the 
chancellor and the president is watched relatively closely. 
Helmut Kohl brought you into politics in Rhineland-Palatinate. 
Will it be easier for him with you than with Richard von 
Weizsaecker? 
  [Herzog] We will have to wait and see. I never analyzed the 
relationship between Richard von Weizsaecker and Helmut Kohl so 
thoroughly as some of your colleagues. I will wait and see. In 
any case, I am my own man and no one's governor. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Bresser] When you went into politics, you first went to 
Bonn for Rhineland-Palatinate and then to Baden-Wuerttemberg as 
cultural minister and later as interior minister. There you 
were considered a very tough politician. You advocated.... 
  [Herzog] You are warming up this story again! 
  [Bresser] Yes, this is part of your curriculum vitae. You 
advocated rubber bullets against demonstrators and also tear gas 
for the police as a weapon. Would you do that again today? 
  [Herzog] I would do both again, because of the 
considerations I made at that time, which your colleagues did 
not believe. It was always said that using a baton is a milder 
method. If you have ever seen the use of a baton from both 
sides' perspective, this is hand-to-hand combat. There is real 
brutality there. In this case, the only way is to separate the 
groups involved, including the police. This was the point of 
this gas. The second matter was the rubber bullets. From the 
very beginning, their use was intended only in cases in which, 
according to police law, the police are permitted to use live 
ammunition. Now, I ask you whether it can be justified to use 
live ammunition in case of emergency, if there is a milder 
method, namely rubber bullets, even though they are still 
dangerous. I am still convinced that I was right about that. I 
just was misunderstood. 
  [Bresser] You were understood as meaning that you wanted to 
use these means against demonstrations in general. Now you are 
obviously talking about people committing acts of violence. 
  [Herzog] This was said in this way at that time; I just was 
not believed. This is really not my fault. 
  [Siegloch] For the public, there was quite a different 
Herzog as a constitutional judge: Under your leadership, the 
ban of a demonstration against the Brockdorf nuclear power plant 
was lifted -- freedom of assembly also in those cases where 
there is the risk that some people might abuse this right. Have 
you become more liberal due to your experiences, or how would 
you interpret this? 
  [Herzog] No one should rule out that a new task and a new 
office also give him a new view on some problem. However, what 
was decided in this ruling on Brockdorf was my policy as 
interior minister in Baden-Wuerttemberg, this was the so-called 
Stuttgart line, which consisted in not seeing a demonstrator as 
an enemy right from the start, which consisted in saying: If 
someone demonstrates peacefully, he has this right, even if 
others are not peaceful. 
  I would like to put it as follows: As interior minister of 
Baden-Wuerttemberg, I would not have issued the comprehensive 
ban on demonstrations around the Brockdorf nuclear power plant 
in the way this was done. And I have witnesses to that. 
  [Bresser] The liberals have recently criticized you with 
considerable harshness because of your attitude on dual 
citizenship. You retracted your statements afterwards. You 
said that those foreigners who do not want to become Germans may 
also stay in our country. However, then you stuck to your basic 
attitude, which is: no dual citizenship. Is this not also 
interference in politics, and would you continue this as 
president? 
  [Herzog] Basically, no. These are statements that I made in 
the Bundesrat 10 or 12 years ago. I must admit that a sentence 
was left out in this interview because I was not paying 
attention. By the way, if you read this interview, the 
formulation of dual citizenship only in exceptional cases is 
correct, but the exceptional case is mentioned right afterwards, 
namely the second and third generation of foreigners. This is 
not an exception in terms of numbers [sentence as heard]. One 
must indeed discuss these matters. In my party, I have so far 
been attacked because I have advocated dual citizenship under 
certain circumstances. Of course, this must be discussed. Over 
the past few weeks, I have had a very lively correspondence with 
foreigners' associations and my attention has been drawn to 
completely new problems, which are linked with ius soli, for 
instance. I am quite open to that. However, I expressly repeat 
that, even though I did not retract anything, I should have 
noticed that this one sentence was missing. 
  [Siegloch] Originally, an eastern German should have become 
president; a southern German, a Bavarian, now has become 
president. You like to talk about different German tribes. Is 
it not first necessary to have east and west grow together. You 
briefly mentioned that in your acceptance speech. Will you 
appeal to the west Germans' conscience more in the future? 
  [Herzog] First of all, it must be clarified in a relatively 
broad discussion what must grow together and to what extent we 
must grow together. I have repeatedly said that the idea that 
there is a wall in the people's minds is partly linked with the 
idea that all people, all Germans, must be identical. They have 
never been that -- individuals have never been that nor have the 
tribes. One can certainly not demand -- even if this is done in 
the most intellectual newspaper articles -- of a group of 17 or 
18 million Germans, like the ones in the new laender, who had 
completely different experiences of life for 40 years than we 
had, that they suddenly think in the same way as the Germans in 
the west. This simply cannot be and does not need to be either. 
  This means, first of all, that we have to talk about the 
extent to which we should and want to come together. Second, of 
course, there are the basic problems that we have at the moment 
-- namely that it is made clear to the western Germans, who have 
to make great sacrifices for the reconstruction in the new 
laender, that this is just the compensation for a more fortunate 
fate that they had. For me it is very important that the 
citizens in the new laender see, as I said before, that we need 
them. They are contributing much of what we do not have in this 
way. I just want to mention the economic sector: They have an 
enormous knowledge of East Europe. Just think of their language 
skills. At the moment, we do not need that very much, but this 
may be different in two or three years. 
  [Bresser] In this matter and in others the president mostly 
works through talking. Next year you will have to give a great 
speech on 8 May 1995. What will this day, the end of World War 
II, be for you: a day of liberation or a day of defeat? 
  [Herzog] I will certainly not give you this speech today. 
  [Siegloch] In your acceptance speech, you said that a casual 
word may allay some tenseness. Now you have an opportunity to 
do so. We would like to give you the beginning of a sentence 
and ask you to complete it quite spontaneously. 
  [Herzog] Only if I can think of something. 
  [Bresser] Loving Germany.... 
  [Herzog] I love only people. I can love the German people. 
  [Siegloch] A grand coalition in Bonn is.... 
  [Herzog] ...probably the ultimate resort. 
  [Bresser] That the Germans deserve a permanent seat on the 
UN 
Security Council.... 
  [Herzog] ...we should not fight for it, but we cannot avoid 
our responsibility either. 
  [Siegloch] That the people should have more of a say in the 
future.... 
  [Herzog] ...I am for it, but one finally has to talk about 
the issues that can be subjected to a referendum. I mostly 
think of personnel decisions at the local level. 
  [Bresser] That a Bavarian becomes president for the first 
time.... 
  [Herzog] ...need not necessarily be bad. 
  [Siegloch] Anyone who takes politics too seriously.... 
  [Herzog] ...probably also takes the rest of his life too 
seriously and thus sometimes blocks his view of the truth. 
  [Bresser] Really important for me is.... 
  [Herzog] Really important for me is that I feel everyday 
that I have lived up to my tasks. 
  [Siegloch] Anyone who thinks that I am sociable fellow.... 
  [Herzog] ...is free to do so. 
  [Bresser] I get quick-tempered if.... 
  [Herzog] ...if I intend to do so. Normally, I am not 
quick-tempered. 
  [Siegloch] Anyone who says that in the future, I have to 
beware of what I am saying.... 
  [Herzog] ...is right -- and you have been trying do that, 
too -- but I am still rather satisfied with myself at the 
moment. It is inherent in the office that has been transferred 
to me today. This office must have a certain degree of dignity. 
  [Bresser] However, who wants to be understood by the 
people.... 
  [Herzog] ...who must speak quite clear German, in particular 
-- I quote Kurt Tucholsky -- main clauses, main clauses, main 
clauses. 
  [Siegloch] Being in the limelight.... 
  [Herzog] ...is something that I have not always wanted. 
However, I will manage. 
  [Bresser] Anyone who says that I am cool right down to my 
heart.... 
  [Herzog] ....does not understand me very well. 
  [Siegloch] Thank you very much, Mr. Herzog. In conclusion, 
after such a day, are you a bit proud this evening? 
  [Herzog] If I say no, you will believe that I am flirting 
with myself a bit. There is a certain satisfaction. Proud is 
not the proper word. There is a certain satisfaction, but, you 
know, it is an enormous challenge, and I must first see whether 
I can live up to it. 
  [Bresser] Thank you very much, Mr. Herzog.

  [Text] Berlin (DDP/ADN) -- According to Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl, with the election of Roman Herzog, Germany has chosen a 
"good federal president." Following Herzog's election, Kohl 
said on ZDF [Second German Television] that Herzog, as a man who 
believes in a state based on the rule of law, will be able to 
fulfill his duties well. Kohl stressed he was completely 
convinced that the Free Democratic Party [FDP] would also vote 
for Herzog in the end. The FDP made a decision which is also 
important for the future. He saw the election of Herzog as a 
"good omen" for the outcome of the Bundestag elections.

<F P=106> [Interview with FDP Chairman and Foreign Minister Klaus </F>
Kinkel by Carlo Gerhardt in Berlin -- live] 
  [Text] [Gerhardt] Klaus Kinkel, Free Democratic Party 
[FDP] chairman and foreign minister, is here with me. Your 
candidate, Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher, did not make it. 
Nevertheless, Mr. Kinkel, are you satisfied with the results? 
  [Kinkel] Yes. First of all, we are proud of Hildegard 
Hamm-Bruecher. In two ballots, she achieved results that were 
far beyond the number of votes that we had; this is a great 
achievement. I advised her not to run in the third ballot. 
This was also approved by the vote in the FDP group. We also 
voted for Mr. Herzog and, thus, we made this decision possible 
-- that is, the FDP was the linchpin. 
  [Gerhardt] Why did you vote for Roman Herzog? What were the 
reasons? 
  [Kinkel] Personally, I told the FDP group that, following 
the coalition statement, it was correct, in my view, to decide 
as we did. We need a clear, reliable course. We want to 
continue the coalition with the Christian Democratic 
Union/Christian Social Union. I do not think the voters would 
have understood a different decision, with all respect to the 
other candidates -- especially Johannes Rau, whom I like 
personally very much and appreciate greatly for his work. 
  [Gerhardt] Johannes Rau received a number of votes from the 
FDP. Was the party facing an acid test? 
  [Kinkel] No, never. We had a very clear result of our vote 
in the group. We always act in a very democratic way. I was 
happy that the majority of the deputies voted in the way that I 
had asked them to, which means that after the vote in the group, 
they cast their votes for Mr. Herzog in the third ballot. 
  [Gerhardt] Thank you very much, Mr. Kinkel.

<F P=106> [Interview with Rudolf Scharping, leader of the Social </F>
Democratic Party, by unidentified reporter in the studio -- live] 
  [Text] [Reporter] What does the Social Democratic Party 
[SPD] expect of Roman Herzog as the new German president? 
  [Scharping] We hope Roman Herzog will carry out his duties 
as 
excellently as Richard von Weizsaecker did. But that will 
remain a hope for the time being. The first speech by Roman 
Herzog did not suggest this. There were many things he should 
have said and did not. 
  [Reporter] What do you mean by that? 
  [Scharping] Well, no one will contradict him when Roman 
Herzog says he supports a tolerant, peace-loving Germany that is 
open to the world. But, you have to choose the appropriate 
words to do so, and also relate it to the conditions as they are 
in Germany -- high unemployment, the economic and social worries 
many people have, the justified concern that we are jeopardizing 
the basis of our existence too much. And, also, I think right 
now we have to give a clear signal in Germany that extremism, 
and violent right-wing extremism in particular, has no chance. 
And I hope the European elections on 12 June will give this 
signal. Unfortunately, Roman Herzog did not give this signal. 
I am not saying that he is not thinking this, but he did not 
say it. 
  [Reporter] In his first speech, Roman Herzog said that he 
wants to represent Germany as Germany really is -- easy-going. 
What does that mean to you? 
  [Scharping] I also asked myself that. 
  [Reporter] In a first reaction, Chancellor Helmut Kohl 
described the election of Roman Herzog as a good omen for the 
Bundestag elections and said: We will sow the seeds in April 
and May, and in October we will bring in the harvest. What's 
your view on this? Has a preliminary decision been made? 
  [Scharping] Even the vegetable growers in the Palatinate 
region and in Oggersheim [Kohl's home town] tell me it is right 
that the cabbage should be harvested in the autumn. 
  The chancellor's statement also confirmed that this election 
was purely to do with holding onto power. And that influenced 
the decision much too strongly. If the Federal Assembly had 
been sovereign enough to support the visible wish of the 
majority of the population and to support the particularly high 
respect for Johannes Rau -- his great popularity right across 
Germany, right across all social and political groups -- then we 
would have had a different result. 
  But, a legitimate decision was made. The Free Democratic 
Party [FDP] surrendered itself totally to Kohl's interest in 
holding onto power. And one thing is crystal clear now: Anyone 
who is conservative in Germany votes Christian Democratic Union 
[CDU] and anyone who has a social or liberal point of view, 
votes for the SPD. After the way it behaved, the FDP is no 
longer needed in this set up. 
  [Reporter] So do you consider the FDP vote for Herzog as a 
rejection of what in terms of numbers could have been a possible 
social-liberal coalition? 
  [Scharping] I noted with concern that Mr. Kinkel said that 
coalition considerations were the reasons why it was necessary 
to hold the test vote in his Federal Assembly group to get a 
majority together, and I also noted the comment by Roman Herzog. 
Overall, this is not a good advertisement for liberalism but 
for the wish, whatever the cost, to retain power. That is not 
the FDP which we got to know as a liberal party, and, in this 
respect Mr. Kinkel is taking an unusually difficult path for 
himself and his party. But that is his responsibility and I do 
not have to worry about that. 
  [Reporter] Will the consequence be that you will seek to 
move 
closer to the Greens with a view to the elections in October? 
  [Scharping] No. There is only one conclusion we draw from 
the presidential election and that is that a change in political 
leadership in Germany, which is urgently necessary, can only be 
achieved with the Social Democrats. And we will fight for this. 
The Federal Assembly made a decision on the basis of majority 
decisions mainly from 1990. The people will be able to make 
their first decision on 12 June [European elections]. We are 
appealing to all social and liberal and reasonable people in 
Germany to show what they think of the three rounds of voting in 
Berlin in the fourth round of voting. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Scharping, in retrospect was it not a 
mistake by the SPD to nominate Minister President Rau? Would it 
have been better to nominate an eastern German, such as Richard 
Schroeder? 
  [Scharping] If you look at the way that Mr. Kohl dealt with 
Mr. Heitmann, who did not even qualify for membership of the 
Federal Assembly, then you will soon recognize that Helmut Kohl 
has always played a tactical game with the office. First he 
proposed Johannes Rau. Then he brought into play the 
considerations which he cited and a few more things up to and 
including Mr. Heitmann. I think that the office of federal 
president has not deserved this handling characterized by power 
tactics. 
  [Reporter] Nevertheless, would it not have been appropriate 
to place an eastern German at the head of our state and to give 
him an opportunity bearing in mind that all the other posts have 
been occupied by western Germans to date? 
  [Scharping] In my view, the best person we have belongs at 
the head of our state and particularly in the office of federal 
president, and that person was clearly Johannes Rau. 
  [Reporter] You have said that if the majority of the 
population had an opportunity to elect the federal president 
directly, Johannes Rau would probably have been elected and not 
Roman Herzog. Do you now seriously want to seek an amendment to 
the constitution in favor of direct election of the federal 
president? 
  [Scharping] We are certainly seeking to clearly broaden the 
public's opportunity to take part in political decisionmaking 
and possibly in the election of the federal president. We have 
made these proposals within the constitutional affairs 
commission which has been dealing with reforms to the Basic Law. 
In my personal view, the whole process of reforming the Basic 
Law has progressed in a rather regrettable manner. All the 
initiatives from the civil rights movement of the collapsed GDR 
have not been adopted, including the possibility of a petition 
for a referendum or referendums themselves. We shall continue 
to pursue this with the aim of increasing the direct 
opportunities for the public to take part in political decisions. 
  [Reporter] Can I put the question to you again: Do you want 
to seek the direct election of the federal president, yes or no? 
  [Scharping] Against the background of this decision I do not 
want to put this up for discussion, because that looks 
immediately as if we are looking for a new procedure in a huff. 
However, I would like to point out that the present federal 
president, who enjoys great respect and recognition in the SPD, 
has raised the question of whether the procedure is the correct 
one if the members of the Federal Assembly make a decision 
ignoring the recognizable will of the majority of the public. 
This is a matter which has been raised by Richard von 
Weizsaecker. 
  [Reporter] But was it not the oldest member of the Federal 
Assembly, 93-year-old Josef Felder, from the SPD, who warned 
against a direct election during the election. He spoke of the 
dangers that a populist might be elected as head of state. How 
seriously do you take such an argument? 
  [Scharping] This is a serious consideration and therefore I 
would not like to shoot from the hip in the heat of the moment 
on this issue. It has to be weighed up very carefully and we 
have about four years in which to do this. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Scharping, you have made forecasts in recent 
elections. The SPD has remained the same, the CDU/CSU have 
caught up a bit. There is a difference of just one point 
between the two major parties. Nonetheless you have managed to 
increase your personal lead over Helmut Kohl. Do you have 
difficulties passing on the popularity which you enjoy to your 
party? 
  [Scharping] No, the SPD is making headway and you will see 
this on 12 June.

Social Democrats. He said he could not understand the 
complaints of several SPD representatives. The SPD has proved

  [Text] Berlin (DDP/ADN) -- In the view of FDP [Free 
Democratic Party] Chairman Klaus Kinkel, the decision by the 
liberals to support new Federal President Roman Herzog is 
important for the strategic orientation of the FDP in the 1994 
election year. The liberals have proved themselves to be a 
reliable factor, Kinkel said following a group meeting of his 
party in the Berlin Reichstag today. The FDP acted responsibly 
in its key role in the election of the federal president. 
  The SPD [Social Democratic Party] candidate, Rau, enjoyed 
his 
high regard, Kinkel continued. At the same time, he strongly 
criticized SPD comments suggesting the FDP was no longer needed. 
"I do not like aggressive noises of this kind; we will not let 
ourselves be blackmailed by the SPD." The FDP was free to 
decide for whom it wanted to vote. 
  Asked to comment on the discussion about a direct election 
of 
the head of state, Kinkel said this could be discussed. 
However, it had to be considered whether this should also apply 
to other representatives. Kinkel admitted that he was 
personally opposed to direct election by the people. 
  Asked whether the FDP has a favorite candidate for the new 
president of the Federal Constitutional Court, Kinkel said he 
did not wish to comment but already has a favorite.

<F P=106> [Peter Scherer report: "Drug Mafia Launches Offensive on </F>
the German Drug Market"] 
  [Text] Security experts are sounding the alarm: They fear 
that the international drug mafia will significantly increase 
its activities in Germany this year and will "more or less 
flood" the German market with drugs of all kinds. To stimulate 
demand, one can expect "dumping prices" for a transitional 
period. 
  This trade offensive can be interpreted as a response to the 
Federal Constitutional Court ruling on hashish and the new drug 
policy adopted by North Rhine-Westphalia, say top German police 
officials. 
  Using their stocks in North Africa and Europe, the drug 
cartels have been bringing more hashish and marijuana onto the 
German market over the past few months. According to the 
Federal Office of Criminal Investigations [BKA] in Wiesbaden, 
the quantity of cannabis products that have been found has 
increased sharply to 1,352 kg during the first quarter of 1994. 
In the corresponding period last year, police and customs 
officials confiscated 711 kg. In 1993, German law enforcement 
agencies removed a total of almost 11.4 tonnes of cannabis 
products and 2.5 tonnes of hard drugs from the market. 
  The overwhelmingly greater part of the cannabis products 
delivered to the drug scene in Europe by "tightly controlled, 
top criminal organizations" came from Morocco. The country is 
one of the states -- alongside Lebanon and Pakistan -- that 
primarily produces hashish, whereas America and the African 
states of Zaire, Nigeria, Ghana, Uganda, and South Africa mainly 
produce marijuana. Nigeria is the main source of marijuana on 
the German scene. 
  The largest European port of entry for cannabis products 
smuggled from Africa is Spain. The dealer organizations run the 
European wholesale trade from there. Various points in the 
Netherlands serve as the largest "half-way storage center" for 
Germany. The Netherlands and German ports organize the bulk of 
the cannabis for the German drug scene. The BKA's view of the 
current situation is: The so-called ant-like process of 
smuggling from the Netherlands is "continuing unabated." 
  According to BKA information, in addition to German drug 
dealers, Turks, Algerians, Moroccans, Italians, and Austrians 
are particularly involved in large-scale trading in cannabis. 
  Because of the relatively large volume, cannabis tends to be 
transported by container via sea, air, truck, or railroad. A 
tried and tested option is the use of barges, that is, pontoons 
used for transporting freight that smugglers use to take the 
drug to ships. This means that ships no longer have to enter 
ports, which means that the turnaround in the use of containers 
is higher and port dues are avoided. In 1992, 9.5 tonnes of 
marijuana were found on these special boats in ten cases. In 
every case, the cargo came from Lagos in Nigeria. 
  The readiness to resort to violence in the drug business is 
causing the police considerable concern. Addressing 
international experts at a working conference in Wiesbaden, BKA 
boss Hans-Ludwig Zachert said: "Organized smugglers and 
wholesalers as well as street dealers are in extensive 
possession of weapons. This great availability of weapons means 
that there is an increased danger that such weapons will be used 
in conflict situations. Police forces at the laender level have 
indications that members of the drug scene are preparing 
themselves for such conflicts. Reports have been received of 
training in the use of firearms. The criminals themselves are 
preparing for the danger of being hit by wearing bullet-proof 
vests."

<F P=106> [Helmut Loelhoeffel report: "Ordered `Deafness' Is a </F>
Problem for the Federal Intelligence Service"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 18 May -- The Federal Intelligence Service 
(BND) has warned against dangerous developments in the arms 
trade and called for an expansion of its tapping rights to get 
on the track of illegal deals. 
  During a hearing of the Economic Committee of the Bundestag, 
the government's intention to extend the control of letters, 
telephone conversations, and telexes of suspicious companies 
until the end of 1996 was discussed. The Customs Criminal 
Office is allowed to do that. According to its vice president, 
Karl-Heinz Matthias, it prevented "several exports of sensitive 
goods" on the basis of observation. 
  BND President Konrad Porzner told the committee that some 
countries in the African, Arab, and Asian region are making 
"massive" efforts to build missile systems. He cited Libya, 
Syria, and Iran as examples. He considers this "the real 
threat." Porzner believes that several states will possess 
carrier missiles with ranges of up to 1,000 km in six to eight 
years' time. Medium-range missiles of a range of up to 3,000 km 
might follow "soon." The efforts of these countries to acquire 
machines, parts, and specialists in the international market are 
continuing at an "intensive level," the BND chief pointed out. 
Particularly trade with the so-called dual-use goods -- 
products that can be used for civilian and military purposes -- 
"is developing in an increasingly problematic manner." 
"Sophisticated acquisition networks" are being established. 
Technically, the BND is in a position to provide "first hints" 
as a result of the control of the telecommunications traffic, 
but it is not allowed to evaluate findings in Germany. "We have 
to pretend not to hear and see anything," Porzner regretted. He 
demanded the expansion of the "instruments designed to discover 
individual illegal deals" and to involve the BND. 
  Whereas representatives of the Customs Criminal Office and 
the Stuttgart public prosecutor reported initial success in the 
prosecution of violations of the foreign trade and the war 
weapons law, Bielefeld jurist Christoph Gusy warned against 
continued control of the post and telecommunications traffic. 
Gusy is representing Rhineland-Palatinate in a lawsuit against 
infringements of the secrecy of post and telecommunications 
traffic with the Federal Constitutional Court.

<F P=106> [Interview with Thomas Roser, manager of the German Atomic </F>
Forum, by Wolfgang Proissl; place and date not given: 
"`Germany's Pullback from Nuclear Energy Would Pose Serious 
Problems for France'"] 
  [Text] Thomas Roser is the manager of the German 
Atomic Forum, which represents the interests of the civil 
nuclear sector. He believes that abandoning this mode of 
generation would harm technology exports. 
  [Proissl] What would be the consequences for German industry 
of a hypothetical decision to abandon nuclear energy? 
  [Roser] Such an abandonment would, in the long term, involve 
holding German industry back from the world market in nuclear 
technology and, with it, the entire European industry, for 
German political decisions on the subject will have 
repercussions throughout Europe. 
  If Germany withdraws, then Paris will have a hard time 
explaining to the French people why France must be the only 
major European country still counting on nuclear energy to 
generate its electricity. In Spain, there is a de facto 
moratorium; in Sweden and in Belgium, no more nuclear power 
stations are being built. At the moment, France and Germany are 
the only countries where nuclear power stations can still be 
built. In short, a German withdrawal would pose major problems 
for France. 
  [Proissl] What kind of consequences would this have for 
exports of German nuclear technology and know-how in this sector? 
  [Roser] Negative ones in both cases. You merely have to call 
to mind the South Koreans' choice in favor of the TGV 
[high-speed train]. Countries seeking to purchase 
high-technology products only do so if they can assure 
themselves that they work well in their country of origin. For 
exports, we definitely need models of reference which have 
proved themselves. 
  Naturally, a withdrawal would also result in a loss of 
know-how. It is already proving difficult to find young people 
who believe that they can build a future by making a career for 
themselves in the area of nuclear technology. The builders or 
managers of power stations are experiencing great difficulties 
in hiring young technicians. 
  [Proissl] Which export contracts are currently liable to 
prove of interest to German builders? 
  [Roser] At present there is only one call for tenders, put 
out by Taiwan, which wishes to purchase one power station and 
take out an option on a second. Nowadays, a power station 
represents a contract worth between 3 and 5 billion German marks 
(10 to 17 billion French francs). Three consortia have 
submitted proposals: one American-British; one American-Swedish; 
and one French-German. The French-German consortium is proposing 
a French power station. There is a simple reason for this. The 
latest German power station is approximately 10 years old. 
Since the Taiwanese want the most recent technology, they are 
opting for France, where power stations have been built much 
more recently.

Treaty] and to include India and Pakistan in a regional 
conference emphasizes the lack of concept that the current 
disarmament policy suffers from. 
  This was expressed by India's Prime Minister Rao, among 
others, during his visit to Washington, when he criticized that 
moral leadership is claimed by those who demand from others what 
they themselves are not prepared to do. 
  Although the U.S. Administration is calling on the nuclear 
have-nots to join a discriminating nonproliferation regime, it 
is by no means planning to scrap the U.S. nuclear weapons 
altogether. The Geneva UN Disarmament Conference may be seeing 
preliminary talks on the renunciation of the use of nuclear 
weapons against nonnuclear states; however, talks on extending 
the nuclear deterrent in the sense of Klaus Kinkel's 
nonproliferation policy failed because the nuclear states 
rejected an expansion of multilateral defense obligations. 
  Bilateral talks are no longer about arms testing but "only" 
about deploying operative arms systems. Clinton's advisers know 
very well that a nuclear condominium in South Asia and the Far 
East makes nonproliferation more difficult. However, sobered by 
the experience in Bosnia, Somalia, and Haiti, the Pentagon is 
preparing a counter proliferation initiative -- although 
modestly funded at a mere $450 million -- in case the 
non-proliferation talks fail. Just as Reagan's Strategic 
Defense Initiative was to protect the United States from a 
strategic first blow, Clinton's program of Counter Proliferation 
is taking a unilateral course of its own. According to a few 
critical voices in the U.S. Congress, this could lead to an 
unpredictable nuclear race, as a result of which the world would 
face more than the 15 states that are known as possessing 
nuclear weapons today. 
  The annual meeting of the UN Disarmament Commission in New 
York was aiming at a clear signal toward an unconditional and 
unlimited extension of the NPT in April 1995. But instead, 
reaching a consensus was prevented because there was no clear 
definition of the objectives of disarmament. This gives rise to 
the question whether the current nonproliferation regime is fit 
to survive. Although the nuclear states basically share the 
view of nonnuclear states that nonproliferation is inseparably 
linked with nuclear disarmament, the codifying of an 
international agreement to eliminate nuclear weapons arsenals, 
which has been demanded by several states, and the direct 
coupling to nonproliferation of nuclear weapons still fail to 
take place.

<F P=106> ["bag" report: "Debts Not To Exceed DM70 Billion"] </F>
  [Text] Cologne, 18 May -- For the 1995 federal budget, 
which the government wants to present in a few weeks, the 1994 
net borrowing of 70 billion German marks is to remain the 
yardstick. This was announced by FRG Finance Minister Theo 
Waigel (Christian Social Union). Additional wishes by 
individual ministries must be financed through redistribution. 
The generally lower revenues of 1994 will "certainly" recur 
next year, the minister promised. 
  The large auditorium of the university in Cologne did not 
prove to be hostile territory for the minister. Invited by the 
Economics Policy Institute of Cologne University, Waigel's 
description of the problems of a finance minister was received 
with sympathy by the students. Even when he asked for 
understanding for the fact that the students' subsidies were not 
raised because of declining real wages and cutbacks of 
unemployment benefits and assistance and that he doubts that 
"their reexamination in 1995 will yield positive results," there 
were only a few protests. 
  Speaking to the students, Waigel primarily defended the 
state 
debts: "Anyone who today pretends that we incurred debts just 
for the fun of it, ignores reality." Referring to former 
Chancellor Helmut Schmidt (Social Democratic Party), Waigel said 
that the latter's criticism does not take the historical 
conditions of the past years into account and is thus directed 
"against reunification and German solidarity." 
  Even though in 1995 the debt level will "temporarily brush 
against the 60-percent marker," which the Maastricht Treaty has 
defied as the upper limit in relation to GDP, in 1996 a decline 
to a value "just below this limit" is expected. Thus, Germany 
is clearly below the average in Europe. Even Japan and the 
United States reach 64 to 68 percent. 
  Regarding the overall state deficit, in 1993 the FRG almost 
reached the Maastricht mark of 3 percent with its 3.3 percent. 
In 1995 the limit will be undercut. The current DM70-billion 
deficit in the federal budget is hardly due to unification but 
to "special burdens caused by the economic development." 
  More important than stimulating overall economic demand is 
to 
preserve trust in financial and monetary policy. The level of 
long-term interests, which are about 2 percent below the 
longstanding average, is evidence of the trust in financial 
markets. Even though the economic research institutes warned in 
their spring reports against "consolidation as an end in 
itself," "we have not endangered the trust through insufficient 
efforts for consolidation," Waigel said. 
  Regarding the privatization of Lufthansa, the Bundespost, 
and 
railroads, the finance minister rejected the accusation that he 
is "selling off the last treasures from the federal coffers out 
of financial need." After deducting the pension insurance 
payments for the employees, the revenues of the Federal 
Government are "relatively small." 
  The privatization of the roads is not a "source of 
financing," either, Waigel stressed. He said that reports about 
the fees and potential compensation are "wild speculation." The 
point is to achieve better traffic conditions at appropriate 
prices -- "in the end companies and private drivers will not be 
worse off," the Christian Social Union politician promised. 
  Asked whether he seriously believes that tax on interest 
rates can be harmonized in Europe, Waigel said: "Neither 
Switzerland nor Austria will refuse a basic solution," and 
"Luxembourg will not stand alone in the end." He thinks that 
the fear of the British chancellor of the exchequer that capital 
will emigrate to the Bahamas if harmonization is implemented in 
Europe is unfounded.

<F P=106> ["na"-signed report: "In the European Monetary Union, the </F>
Wage Sin Is Promptly Followed by Employment Policy Atonement"] 
  [Text] Duesseldorf, 14-15 May -- In the European Monetary 
Union (EMU), the employment policy responsibility of employers 
and trade unions will increase. This is stated in a study of 
the IW German Economic Research Institute, which was written on 
behalf of, and subsidized by, the European Commission. 
  The IW argues that, since, in the framework of the 
convergence process during the next few years, monetary policy 
has been fixed at a strictly antiinflationary course and 
financial policy has been oriented at structural consolidation, 
wage policy errors can in the future no longer be covered up by 
an expansive governmental demand management. In addition, it 
will no longer be possible to devalue the currency to correct an 
exaggerated wage policy. 
  In view of the recession, which has led to a drastic 
increase 
in unemployment throughout the European Union [EU], employers 
and trade unions are particularly called upon in the nineties to 
promote economic growth within the EU by pursuing a wage policy 
that must be aimed at combating rising costs and improving 
international competitiveness. They are also called upon to 
make an active wage policy contribution to solve employment 
problems. 
<H5>  Competitive Disadvantage Through Higher Wage Unit Costs </H5>
  The IW study criticizes the fact that, in the recent past, 
the development of wages in many areas has been faster than the 
productivity rate, so that wage unit costs have increased 
steeply. With the changes in the international exchange rate 
mechanism, the EU's competitiveness toward the United States and 
Japan since 1985 has clearly deteriorated as far as wage costs 
are concerned. As a result, EU industrial products in 1992 
involved wage costs that were almost 14 percent higher than 
comparable U.S. and Japanese products. 
  According to the IW study, regarding EMU requirements, the 
undesirable wage policy developments in recent years cannot be 
corrected in one year or over several years by means of lower 
wage agreements. What is rather necessary is a lasting and 
sustained change of attitude among employers and trade unions. 
Employees should not primarily define their wage demands on a 
distribution policy basis, according to the formula of 
"productivity increase plus fully expected price increase plus 
redistribution component." 
  Employers and trade unions should basically start operating 
a 
productivity-oriented wage policy. Such a policy confines the 
wage increase to the rate of increase of labor productivity and 
is thus aimed at a certain stability of wage unit costs. Then 
no cost-induced price increase will take place. To that extent, 
this form of wage policy is also stability-oriented and thus in 
line with the EMU. 
  However, because the economy of the EU is currently in a 
situation of structural underemployment, the IW is going a step 
farther with its demands. According to the IW, an 
employment-oriented wage policy in this situation requires wage 
increases to be lower for a certain period of time than the 
productivity increase. This will improve the companies' profits. 
Since, in that case, capital profitability will increase, the 
scope for investment will also increase. Without such a clear 
stimulation of investment activities and the stimulation of 
growth, no improvement in the labor market can be expected, it 
says in the IW study. 
  As a possible way to reach the goal of a wage policy that 
is less marked by distribution struggles, the IW recommends that 
employees should not only take part in the national income in 
the form of wages, but should also participate in the second 
type of the national income -- gross earnings from 
entrepreneurial activities and property. Trade unions and 
employees would then not have to fear that they could be left 
behind in distribution policy terms if they pursue a moderate 
wage policy. For companies, such a change of system would also 
pay. Labor and capital productivity would increase, as would 
the profitability of the capital invested. 
<H5>  Profit-Oriented Wage Component </H5>
  According to the IW, a standardization of the wage creation 
systems in the individual EU member states cannot be expected, 
nor would it be appropriate. Nor does the IW see any 
economically convincing reasons for a wage policy centralization 
within the EU in the sense of supranational collective 
negotiations. On the contrary -- EU-wide pay settlements could 
not take the very different conditions and developments in the 
individual member states adequately into account and would thus 
rule out an increased orientation at productivity. 
  The example of the Federal Republic shows that the 
introduction of the currency union does not entail any central, 
generally valid collective negotiations. Separate negotiations 
have been conducted for the old and new federal laender to make 
it possible to take their different capacities into account in 
pay settlements. 
  To solve the European employment problems, the required 
moderate wage policy must be accompanied by structural reforms 
of the labor market, stresses the IW. In many countries, the 
current individual and collective legal regulations tend to 
reduce the employment policy effectiveness of collective 
bargaining policies.

<F P=106> [Report by Jacques Fleury: "Edouard Balladur in Guadeloupe: </F>
`France Needs You'"] 
  [Excerpts] Basse-Terre (Guadeloupe) -- "France needs you. 
The government needs you. However, it cannot do everything. 
You must make your contribution to building this new society to 
which we all aspire." In his first visit to the Antilles, 
Edouard Balladur launched an appeal to all the inhabitants of 
overseas departments to take direct control of their future by 
developing their economies. [passage omitted] 
  Under the dome of the Regional Council, Lucette 
Michaux-Chevry [president of the Guadeloupe Regional Council] 
(she has been away from Paris for three weeks and some observers 
said she was on bad terms with the government) argued in favor 
of a greater solidarity effort from the state to help the 
overseas departments and, like all the deputies present, 
expressed the desire for better cooperation between the state 
and Guadeloupe, a "frank and active partnership based on mutual 
respect." 
<H5>  Large Amounts of Aid </H5>
  This is the message the prime minister echoed. "The state 
will support you by encouraging you to exercise your local 
responsibilities. Moreover, the state is at your side every 
time Guadeloupe experiences problems. I am anxious that the 
state should honor the pledges made in 1989 following Hurricane 
Hugo. To this end, a sum of 30 million francs [Fr] has been 
allocated for economic recovery. The remaining Fr75 million for 
rebuilding public buildings will be allocated very shortly." 
  These are not the only measures that he was to announce. For 
instance, state funds for Guadeloupe will increase from Fr589 
million to Fr824 million in the 11th Plan. The state will 
devote Fr285 million to the funding of major port, airport, and 
road facilities. Guadeloupe's social policy will be 
strengthened with an allocation of FR122 million; FR326 million 
will go to agriculture. Finally, a package of Fr89 million will 
be allocated for environmental protection. 
  "The state," Mr. Balladur stressed, "is ready to cooperate 
out with you on economic development and a more united society." 
Explaining the bill drawn up by Dominique Perben [the minister 
for overseas departments and territories] to combat unemployment 
more effectively in the DOM [overseas departements], he 
continued: "We want to encourage the DOM to develop their 
economies. We want to compensate for the financial handicaps of 
remoteness, insularity, and the small market size. If we are 
able to use its potential, this bill should make it possible to 
increase the activities available to those in job creation 
programs by two-thirds in two or three years. This ambitious 
project is costly. National solidarity will pay for the reform 
of the job creation program. Employment aid measures will have 
an annual cost of over Fr1 billion." This cost will be funded 
partly by the increase in overseas departments of VAT on 
products which are not essential. This is a measure which has 
not been well received here but which the prime minister regards 
as necessary. This plan, he argued, "is an opportunity for the 
overseas departements. It is an opportunity which Guadeloupe 
must not waste." 
  Before continuing his visit to Les Saintes and relaxing on 
the beach, Mr. Balladur stressed the need to achieve unity to 
jointly take up the "challenge of the new society."

<F P=106> [Interview with Bank of France Governor Jean-Claude Trichet </F>
by Michel Drancourt in Paris; date not given: "Bank of France 
Governor Answers Strong Franc's Detractors"] 
  [Text] Jean-Claude Trichet, 51, governor of the Bank of 
France, is the first governor of an independent Bank of France. 
Endowed with a Monetary Policy Council -- an independent group 
that defines monetary policy -- its legally defined objective is 
to contain inflation and to ensure that a solid currency 
contributes to healthy expansion. 
  He is not sure that public opinion -- including that of 
those 
in charge politically -- fully supports this goal, but 
Jean-Claude Trichet hopes that it will be convinced, by the 
results, that monetary stability draws the economy into a 
virtuous circle of lasting growth, which in turn promotes new 
jobs. 
  [Drancourt] I propose that the underlying theme of this 
interview be the relationship between money and employment. For 
many people, the strong franc policy of which you are the 
driving force and the symbol is partly the cause of unemployment. 
  [Trichet] I know that certain people believe this in good 
faith. Allow me simply to recall certain facts: 
  - in general in the world, those economies with stable 
currencies are also economies with low unemployment rates: 
western Germany, Japan, and Switzerland, to mention just a few 
examples. 
  - the medium-term growth of the French economy has not 
suffered from the stable money strategy of the last seven and a 
half years, during which our currency has taken up its position 
as one of Europe's most stable currencies: Since 1986, annual 
economic growth has been 2.3 percent in Western Germany, 2.1 
percent in France, 1.8 percent in Great Britain. 
  - the French recession will have been one of the shortest of 
those recorded by the other major industrial countries. 
  The real problem of the French economy is to understand why 
it creates fewer jobs for every one percent growth in gross 
domestic product than comparable industrial economies. This is 
a vital question which "challenges", as they say, everyone in a 
position of responsibility. In my opinion, we must do 
everything possible to enrich the "job content" of France's 
growth. This presupposes a whole range of structural reforms, 
none of which is easy to design and to translate into hard 
facts. Coming to monetary policy itself, my own conviction, 
shared by those responsible for the currencies of the major 
countries, is that there is no contradiction, but rather 
complementarity, between a monetary strategy of stability and 
credibility and our ability to obtain for our economy the best 
possible means of financing with which to promote growth and job 
creation. For a given currency, market interest rates, which 
are defined in the last analysis by national and international 
investors, depend on the judgment by these people of the 
long-term value of the currency. If a country's currency is 
"credible," investors accept lower market rates. Nowadays this 
is clearly visible: The ranking of currencies according to the 
greater "resistance" to the rise in long-term U.S. rates 
coincides with their "credibility" ranking. 
  [Drancourt] In his recent book "Les Infortunes de la 
Prosperite" [The Misfortunes of Prosperity], Daniel Cohen, a 
professor at the Ecole Normale Superieure, evokes good old 
Keynes. To end the crisis of his time, he recommended the 
"euthanasia" of modest income which represented 30 percent of 
domestic product prior to 1914. A transfer took place in the 
form of social protection. This would not have been possible 
without monetary erosion. The author suggests attacking today's 
retired people, by sacrificing monetary solidity, in order to 
give work to the working generation. What do you think of this 
approach? 
  [Trichet] One must examine what it means to be part of a 
world economy in which modern economies are closely interlinked 
and observe that a country like France is not able on its own to 
change the shape of this economy. In the 1970's and 1980's, a 
vast world market was created. Almost every country, including 
the former Soviet Union, adhered to its operating rules. In 
this vast market, obtaining the best possible interest rates 
demands a currency with maximum possible credibility. For this 
reason I do not know any central bank manager who would sing the 
praises of monetary erosion. As to the question of whether, in 
the West in general and in Europe in particular, achieving a 
balance between the working and retired populations and between 
young and old is being done well, that is another matter. No 
doubt we have to concern ourselves with our demographic 
development, which is ineluctably increasing the proportion of 
the non-working population, and to draw the necessary 
consequences. But I do not believe that these questions are 
directly linked to monetary policy. 
  [Drancourt] Without reverting to the Bible, which recommends 
that debts be wiped out every 50 years, one notes a nostalgia 
for monetary instability among certain entrepreneurs and other 
social categories. Indeed, in their mind, this is one way of 
questioning acquired positions, the establishment, and promoting 
innovation. 
  [Trichet] In the long term, one sees clearly that countries 
like Germany, Switzerland and Japan, for example, who have opted 
for a policy of monetary stability, have had no cause to repent. 
Good monetary management has promoted the progress of their 
economies and their standard of living. Small- and medium-sized 
businesses are strong in these countries. Enterprise creation is 
active. And Japan is not the last when it comes to innovation. 
Finally I observe that the feeling which the Bank of France 
gains from its very many contacts with small, medium and 
large-sized enterprises (we question 12,000 of them every month) 
is that the interest of the economy and of business in having a 
solid monetary base is very widely understood by those in charge 
of the economy. 
  [Drancourt] A strong currency forces companies, so to speak, 
to "find their way out through the top." However, for a long 
time, in France, some counted on the easy way out. Today they 
are suffering competition from low-salary economies. If one is 
in the category of enterprises which count on inflation to get 
them out of difficulties, one can always find an Asian country 
which is cheaper. But it will take time for every company to 
move into the higher category. Those who are not yet that far 
blame the strong currency and its supporters for their 
difficulties and those which result for employment in particular. 
  [Trichet] Yes, I believe that one can say this: once the 
currency is stable, fleeing forward is not a paying proposition. 
If inflation can make things easier in the short term, the bill 
becomes heavy when the time comes to put one's house in order. 
When France used to give in to the temptation of inflation, it 
then had to pick up the inevitable costs of regaining control. 
This is what used to be known as the "cooling down plan." The 
advantage which it thought it had gained was quickly lost. Lax 
monetary policy can be like a drug. It procures satisfaction, 
but this is short-lived. Then you have to pay the bill. I 
notice that those countries which have not ceded to this 
temptation have, ultimately, done better. In any event, I would 
remind you that the Bank of France's Monetary Policy Council is 
bound by law to watch over price stability. 
  [Drancourt] Does not a country with an aging population need 
ultimately to be able to invest capital which secures long-term 
earnings, which is one way of guaranteeing its future resources? 
  [Trichet] Allow me to pose the question differently, without 
reference to population data. In an economy based on 
international trade, a country like France, with strong 
industrial traditions, needs to take global positions in a whole 
series of activities and industries. It has to be in a position 
to invest large amounts, in particular abroad, something which, 
moreover, we have been doing for a number of years: We were the 
second largest international industrial investor in 1992. To 
carry out such a policy, it is better to have a stable currency 
with a strong global purchasing power. 
  [Drancourt] From now on the Bank of France is autonomous. 
What does this mean in terms of responsibility? 
  [Trichet] Under the law we have a clear responsibility. The 
Monetary Policy Council defines our country's monetary policy 
with the concern to ensure price stability. It may not receive 
or solicit instructions from anyone. Public opinion, it seems 
to me, does not question this independence, in particular as the 
Monetary Policy Council consists of a woman and men with 
recognized competence and with rich and varied experience. 
  [Drancourt] But there are nonetheless people who do not 
accept the Bank's independence, saying that this does not permit 
the necessary adaptation. 
  [Trichet] The Bank's independence is, indeed, something new 
in France. Like any new institution, it needs to take its place 
in the institutional landscape of our country, as is the case in 
Switzerland, the United States or the Netherlands, for example, 
not to mention Germany. But independence does not in any way 
mean that the Bank of France is outside the field of democracy. 
The law itself scrupulously organizes the Monetary Policy 
Council's relations with the government and the Bank of France's 
relations with the president of the Republic and with 
parliament. With regard to the latter, the law states that the 
National Assembly's Finance Committee can ask at any time to 
hear the governor. And the governor can ask at any time to be 
heard by the Finance Committee. This is a very strong link, as 
you can see. Finally, in any democracy, any institution -- 
whatever it may be -- must constantly listen, meditate, decide, 
explain and, if possible, convince. This is what the Monetary 
Policy Council is determined to do. And it is what we are all 
doing together, methodically, not only in Paris but in every 
region of France. 
  [Drancourt] You are, in a way, the ringmaster. Monetary 
policy which has been set presupposes, for example, that public 
deficits do not increase and that public companies are better 
managed. 
  [Trichet] All Europeans, with the exception of Luxembourg, 
are currently having serious problems with the management of 
public finances. And I say: all European members of the 
European Union [EU], whatever their monetary policies. This is 
why 11 European governments have begun "convergence programs" 
aimed at regaining control of public deficits. Last November 
[Economics Minister] Alphandery presented a convergence plan at 
the same time as the German Government. The budget minister in 
turn presented a five-year bill relating to the state budget 
which was voted last January. In the letter I sent, as required 
by law, to the president of the Republic and to parliament, I 
indicated that I was very pleased at the commitments made by the 
French Government and that it was naturally important that they 
be respected. 
  [Drancourt] You mention the Maastricht Treaty. Part of 
public opinion seems to believe that it is not applicable and 
even seems to have forgotten it. 
  [Trichet] The central banks are not there to make laws but 
to 
apply them. The Maastricht Treaty has been signed, ratified, 
and constitutionally approved by the 12 countries of the EU. It 
is the law of these countries. If one day the Treaty is 
amended, we will apply the amended Treaty. But today my 
European colleagues and I are naturally responsible for applying 
the Treaty, and that is what we are doing, all together, within 
the European Monetary Institute presided over by Mr. Lamfalussy, 
with its offices in Frankfurt, and whose director general is Mr. 
Raymond, a Frenchman. 
  [Drancourt] Despite this, we see countries like Great 
Britain 
and Italy carrying out their own foreign exchange policies. 
Either one wants Europe and one follows the rules. Or one does 
not follow the rules and does not want Europe. While waiting 
for Maastricht to be implemented, how does one correct the risks 
of unfair competition? 
  [Trichet] I believe, like you, that one cannot at one and 
the 
same time construct a single market and even a simple common 
market and neglect the question of monetary organization. The 
risk indeed would be that of the erratic handling of exchange 
policy creating new and invisible barriers, in contradiction to 
the idea of the elimination of all borders. The founders of the 
Treaty of Rome got it right when they said that foreign exchange 
questions were questions of common interest. And yet at the 
time of the signature of the Treaty of Rome, all currencies were 
bound by the very strict "Bretton Woods" exchange system. In 
Europe I remind you that nine economies out of 12 are part of 
the Exchange Rate Mechanism, which is managed jointly by the 
"12." Finally, I am struck to see that the North American 
countries has just given themselves an embryonic monetary 
organization to accompany the single market which is being 
created between the United States, Mexico, and Canada. There is 
no better illustration of the pertinence of the European 
approach. 
  [Drancourt] Some politicians, if they carry their logic to 
the extreme, recommend that France leave the European accords on 
monetary matters. What would happen in this case? 
  [Trichet] This is a question which, as you know, has to be 
answered by the government. It is Mr. Alphandery whom you 
should pose the question to. Everyone knows what his 
convictions are in this area! 
  [Drancourt] We are going through a deflationary period. 
Would 
it be wrong in these conditions to increase money supply? 
  [Trichet] Allow me me to offer two comments, the first about 
the "deflationary period," the second about the "economic 
situation" and the Monetary Policy Council's strategy. First of 
all I should emphasize that for several months now the Bank of 
France has been observing that the narrow monetary 
aggregates--known as "M1" and "M2"' in our jargon--are proving 
much more dynamic. During the past seven months, they have 
grown at an average annual rate of seven percent. Here we have 
a clear sign of monetary dynamism accompanying and supporting 
the movement of recovery which has been under way since November 
1993. We are not at all in a "deflationary" situation. 
Secondly, I notice that everyone today agrees to say that the 
economy is moving again: the experts, the European 
institutions, even industrialists. The Bank of France is very 
glad about this recovery, which it was the first to observe 
through its monthly survey of almost 12,000 business leaders. 
Let us remember that the Monetary Policy Council had clearly 
indicated, from the time it was established, that it placed 
France's monetary policy within the context of sustained 
medium-term growth of the order of 3 percent a year. At the 
time -- this was at the end of January -- the return to growth 
seemed a long way off and our forecasts somewhat fanciful. 
Today we have got there and I am convinced that our monetary 
policy had more than a little hand in this! 
  [Drancourt] As long as interest rates were higher than 
growth 
rates, companies had an interest in "putting their money on the 
markets" and reducing their debt rather than investing. Has the 
time come for reinvestment? 
  [Trichet] The period of "deceleration" of investment appears 
to be behind us, and it seems that we are now, fortunately 
enough, coming into a period of renewed investment. That is 
what INSEE [National Institute of Statistics and Economic 
Studies] is telling us. Everything is pushing in this 
direction. First of all the fact that industries in the 
manufacturing sector have a self-financing rate of, on average, 
well above 100 percent. This means that they are able to invest 
more. Secondly, the fact that order books have filled up again, 
in particular with orders from abroad and orders due to stock 
movements, and that industrial capacity utilization is rising. 
The very sizeable fall in short-term interest rates is also 
naturally acting in favor of manufacturing investment. Today, 
the three-month rates are at around 5.5 percent instead of 12 
percent more than a year ago. Finally the fact that our 
long-term interest rates are able -- despite pressure from the 
United States -- to remain at a relatively low level close to 
the best rates seen in Europe and, when possible, below U.S. 
rates, is a further advantage for investment in France.

<F P=106> [Report by Xavier Harel: "National Statistics Office Sees </F>
France `On Its Way to Recovery'"] 
  [Text] According to the INSEE [National Institute of 
Statistics and Economic Studies], a more vigorous recovery than 
expected is giving rise to hopes that the rise in unemployment 
will be "significantly smaller" than initial estimates. For the 
second time since December, the INSEE's growth forecasts for the 
second half of the year have been adjusted upwards. 
  The INSEE, which had predicted "a gradual reactivation" and 
a 
.5-percent increase in business in the first semester, now 
believes that "the French economy is on its way to recovery," 
and is counting on a .9-percent increase of GDP. "Against a 
background of a substantial increase in expected demand and in 
exports, recovery would seem to be supported by a growth of 
stocks, a slight reactivation of productive investments, and the 
housing sector's dynamism," the INSEE stated. 
  In such conditions, even if there is zero growth in the 
second semester, which would be highly unlikely, GDP will 
increase by 1.3 percent in 1994. This figure will probably be 
surpassed. Last Thursday, Economics Minister Edmond Alphandery 
considered it "highly probable" that this summer the government 
will adjust its 1.4-percent forecast for 1994 upwards. Two new 
factors are underpinning this more favorable prognosis. To begin 
with, a confirmation. The improvement in manufacturers' 
expectations since the fall resulted in an increase in 
manufacturing output. Even on the pessimistic assumption of 
industrial production stagnating in March, it would still have 
risen by 2.4 percent in the first quarter, thus invalidating the 
INSEE's December forecasts (0.1 percent). 
  The second factor is a piece of good news: The labor market 
has stabilized more rapidly than expected. Paid employment in 
the non-agricultural business sector increased by 0.1 percent in 
the first quarter thanks to a significant hiring increase in the 
tertiary, particularly services, sector. In addition, the loss 
of industrial jobs was less serious than expected (down 0.5 
percent). Overall, "the rise of unemployment during the first 
semester should be smaller than predicted (0.5 percent) in 
December's statement," the INSEE anticipated. 
<H5>  Recovery of Industrial Investments Confirmed </H5>
  Why is recovery apparently more vigorous? To begin with, the 
international environment is continuing to improve. The 
locomotive effect of North American growth and the expansion of 
Asian markets (excluding Japan) on the European economies has 
become more tangible than in 1993. But, above all, "as regards 
demand expectations, it is fairly established that things seem 
to be getting better in Europe," according to Eric Chaney, one 
of the authors of the INSEE's statement, who highlighted the 
fact that most of the trade carried out by European Union 
countries was carried out within Europe itself. 
  One of the factors which was working against recovery, 
business stocking behavior, now seems to have taken a favorable 
turn. The improvement in demand expectations is encouraging 
manufacturers to slow down stock depletion, which in itself is 
enough to contribute positively to growth. The slight increase 
in the price of intermediate products (up 0.2 percent in the 
first quarter) for the first time since 1992, highlights this 
progress. The recovery of industrial investment, which this 
year should rise by 1 to 2 percent after an 11-percent drop, is 
being confirmed. In addition, these forecasts are more likely 
to be adjusted upward than downward: Demand expectations, which 
largely determine investment behavior, have been rising since 
the autumn of 1993. 
<H5>  Uncertainty in Financial Markets </H5>
  Finally, "the improvement in the labor market that has been 
noted since early in the year is gradually reestablishing 
confidence among households, whose consumption may prove more 
dynamic in the second quarter than in the first," the INSEE 
stated. 
  The only shadow in the picture is cast by the uncertainties 
besetting the financial markets. The rise in long-term interest 
rates in most of the industrialized countries, including France, 
as well as the acute volatility experienced in the financial 
markets remain a reason for concern and could indirectly affect 
economic activity, particularly in the real estate markets.

<F P=106> [Article by Ramon Oriol: "Santander Pursues Its American </F>
Adventure"] 
  [Editorial Report] The Spanish bank is going to 
increase its ownership in the First Fidelity Bank, which is 
going to take over a fifth bank, the Baltimore Bancorp, and 
reinforce its position on the U.S. market. 
  Before the end of the year, Banco de Santander will increase 
its ownership in the First Fidelity Bank from 22.7 percent to 
24.9 percent, exercising all the warrants it expects to receive 
from the agreement it signed in 1991. At the same time, First 
Fidelity just acquired the Baltimore Bancorp, a Maryland bank 
with branches in Virginia, Delaware, and North Carolina, for 
$346 million. It is the fifth bank acquired by First Fidelity 
during the last i2 months, after Northeast Bancorporation, 
Village Financial of New York, People's Westchester, and the 
First People National Bank. 
<H5>  Three Types of Activities To Be Developed </H5>
  Last summer the Banco de Santander requested permission from 
the Federal Reserve to operate as an investment bank and stock 
brokerage on the U.S. financial market through its affiliate 
Santander Securities, Inc. If the [Federal Reserve] response 
turns out to be positive, the bank group will invest $20 million 
in the capital of this affiliate. Banco de Santander wants to 
develop three types of activities on the U.S. market: to 
negotiate government securities and corporate stocks from Spain, 
Italy, Portugal, and South America; support companies in stock 
operations, mergers and reorganizations; and develop an active 
presence on the futures and options market. The Banco de 
Santander explains that the activity of its affiliate will be 
carried out as a priority in cooperation with institutional 
investors. 
  If the Federal Reserve gives its green light, the Banco de 
Santander will be the first Spanish bank to operate as an 
investment bank and stock brokerage on the U.S. market. The 
bank group is already the first Spanish group on the U.S. market 
in terms of its assets, which have reached $8.127 billion--$3.5 
billion alone for the Banco Santander Puerto Rico affiliate. 
Since August 1993, the bank also has owned 89.3 percent of the 
Kemper Corporation, which fulfills for Santander today the role 
which the new affiliate will play tomorrow. In fact, Santander 
intends to acquire the stock brokerage business of the U.S. 
group. Since 1982, Kemper Securities has lost $207 million. 
The commercial bank, Santander de Negocios, also helps Kemper 
manage the investment fund, The Growth Fund of Spain. 
  All these operations will in the future be subject to the 
fate of the Banesto reorganization of its operations on the 
American continent and on their eventual integration into the 
Santander network.

<F P=106> [Interview with Nicola Mancino, Popular Party Senate floor </F>
leader, by Gianluca Luzi on 19 May; place not given: "This Is 
How Our Opposition Will Be Pending a Return Match"] 
  [Text] Rome -- Just 24 hours later, the chairman of the PPI 
[Italian Popular Party] senators no longer wore the frown that 
marked his expression after the vote of confidence in the 
government. The rebels who disobeyed the party in order to 
salvage [Prime Minister] Berlusconi played a nasty trick on him, 
but Nicola Mancino has succeeded in keeping the PPI in 
opposition, as promised. 
  [Luzi] Senator Mancino, what is meant by "neither blind nor 
hostile opposition"? 
  [Mancino] Our aim is to work in the country's interest. This 
means we will not constitute a confrontational opposition, we 
will not seek polar confrontations. This is the last thing that 
those, such as ourselves, who have the ambitious plan to break 
up the artificial coalitions that came about during the election 
campaign can permit themselves to do. Dialogue will bring about 
a thaw and will bring to light the very many inconsistencies 
already present within this majority. 
  [Luzi] Do you see many inconsistencies? 
  [Mancino] There is no agreement on the concept of the 
country's unity and indivisibility. In foreign policy there is 
still cause to be wary, both with regard to the not entirely 
placated forms of nationalism (I am talking about the revision 
of borders) and to the single European currency. As for the 
economy, this emphatically announced neoliberalist stance needs 
to be thoroughly clarified. Will the welfare system continue to 
be afforded an important position, or will it be scaled down, 
causing the most disadvantaged sectors to become completely 
neglected? 
  [Luzi] Do you long for a return to welfarism? Do you not 
think that there has been too much of that? 
  [Mancino] This is a criticism that the DC [Christian 
Democratic Party] used to make of itself, because in the past 15 
years the gains in the welfare system were undermined by an 
exaggerated welfarism. 
  [Luzi] That was called cronyism. 
  [Mancino] Partly that. There were all kinds of things -- the 
conservation of the ruling bloc, the limitation or exclusion of 
imagination in production... If Berlusconi is aiming to create 
a million new jobs within two years, he can do it, inasmuch as 
already the forecasts for this year indicate an increase of at 
least 400,000. But we must beware of undermining the recovery. 
In order to achieve this target it is necessary not to try to 
go too far. The issue of the South is a crucial one; but 
specifically on the topic of southern Italy resistance and 
conflicts could occur within the coalition. 
  [Luzi] Rather than criticisms, these sound like suggestions 
to Berlusconi. Is the economy the most fertile field for 
understanding with the government? 
  [Mancino] Unquestionably. 
  [Luzi] Does that mean that in connection with the Finance 
Bill you will display generous attention to the government's 
proposals? 
  [Mancino] To create new jobs is not the prerogative of the 
majority forces alone; the responsibility of the opposition 
forces will be measured on this too. 
  [Luzi] One of the inconsistencies that you mentioned in the 
Senate was the prime minister's dual role, including that of 
owner of a number of television channels. What does the PPI 
think Berlusconi should do? 
  [Mancino] This is the most serious problem. When the power 
of information becomes concentrated in the hands of a single 
person -- either through ownership (Fininvest) or by virtue of 
his status (the administration of RAI [State Radio and 
Television]), there is a real, not merely potential, danger of a 
limitation of the scope for freedom. Good intentions are not 
enough; it is not enough to move away from the news production 
centers. There must be a relinquishment. There is already an 
incompatibility between the role of prime minister and ownership 
of television channels. True, a businessman cannot be prevented 
from engaging in politics, but when you choose to serve the 
interest of the community, you must eliminate these 
inconsistencies; and in this instance there is a formal and 
substantive inconsistency. 
  [Luzi] If and when you approve some government measure or 
another you will be voting the same way as the National Alliance 
[AN]. Does this prospect embarrass you? 
  [Mancino] I do not think it embarrasses us. This raises a 
more general issue. What [AN leader] Mr. Fini must come to 
terms with is not my nostalgic feelings, but the nostalgia for 
banners, flags, and blackjacks not unconnected with the 
political tradition of his old MSI [Italian Social Movement]. 
The Rautis, the Buontempos, Miss Mussolini, the Maceratinis, 
and the Tremaglias are not insignificant figures in Parliament. 
In order to become a European-style moderate Right it is 
necessary to shed these people. A cosmetic operation is not 
enough. 
  [Luzi] You have said that within the opposition you will 
"never become confused with left-wing cartels." Will there be 
no battles waged jointly with the progressive forces? 
  [Mancino] There will definitely be battles to guarantee and 
defend freedoms. Of course, this cannot authorize anyone to 
talk in terms of regressive associationism. We want to create a 
center capable of achieving groupings after it has undermined 
the stability of alignments that we still consider unnatural. 
  [Luzi] In other words, you want to bring Forza Italia into 
the center. 
  [Mancino] Yes. I think that the objective must be not only 
to bring Forza Italia into the center: The objective is to win 
back our traditional electorate. The recent CEI [Italian 
Episcopal Conference] document stressed the need for the 
presence of a Christian-inspired party. With such a party there 
is a nonexclusive preferential relationship. It is up to the 
secularist Christians active in politics to recompose the 
fragmented area lying both to the Right and to the Left of the 
PPI. When we have won back our electorate, the strategy of 
coalitions will not be a chimera for us and we will present a 
less fragile political proposal than that which we presented for 
the general elections. 
  [Luzi] With which allies? 
  [Mancino] The frame of reference could be a group situated 
to 
our Right -- and Forza Italia is definitely situated to our 
Right -- and a group situated to our Left, if the idea of a 
democratic alliance embodying Liberal, Republican, and Socialist 
tendencies materializes. 
  [Luzi] But that is the old five-party alliance... 
  [Mancino] It is not. It is something new born from the ruins 
of the five-party alliance. 
  [Luzi] What about the Left? 
  [Mancino] The Left is the other aspect of the old system. 
The collapse of the old majorities was accompanied also by the 
collapse of the idea of a left-wing government, and this defeat 
makes the crisis of the left-wing coalition much more serious 
and profound than the sharp defeat suffered by the Popular 
Party. The potential for recovery is more on our side than 
theirs. 
  [Luzi] What does it feel like to be in opposition for the 
first time? 
  [Mancino] Personally, it feels like a transition, therefore 
like a change. I still wonder, will we succeed? Can we 
recover? Do people understand the new effort that is being made? 
So the experience borders on an existential and political 
crisis. While on the one hand there is a feeling of depression, 
on the other hand there is the impetus to carry on in order to 
recover. 
  [Luzi] Opposition means remoteness from power... 
  [Mancino] It purifies... 
  [Luzi] Yes, it purifies, but it has already lost you the CCD 
[Christian Democratic Center] and yesterday it lost you four 
senators... 
  [Mancino] We have not lost them. I have heard from them, 
listened to them. There is a desire to return, to remain full 
members of the PPI. In any case, they have been suspended, not 
expelled... 
  [Luzi] What would have happened if the government had 
fallen? 
  [Mancino] It would have made our strategy more clearly 
understood, and even Berlusconi would have realized that he is 
not invincible. In other words, that politics is not the Milan 
soccer club...

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Raquel Abecassis on news conference </F>
by Manuel Dias Loureiro, minister of internal administration, in 
Lisbon on 23 May -- passages within quotation marks recorded] 
  [Excerpts] The head of the Portuguese secret services [SIS] 
has resigned. The minister for internal administration has 
already accepted the resignation and announced it a little while 
ago at a news conference. In addition, Dias Loureiro has 
dismissed Joao Evangelista, the Madeira regional director of 
SIS. All this follows the outcome of an inquiry carried out by 
the parliamentary monitoring committee that looked into the work 
of the secret services in Madeira. Dias Loureiro read, 
appraised, and decided. A few moments ago, the minister 
announced the resignation of Ladeiro Monteiro and the dismissal 
of Joao Evangelista. Raquel Abecassis reports. 
  [Abecassis] Dias Loureiro has a week to study the results of 
a report that, despite not proving the existence of recent 
investigations into magistrates in Madeira, proved that the SIS 
in Madeira did carry out highly irregular activities. 
  [Loureiro] "However, the monitoring council's report 
recognizes that something, or some things, included in the 
reports I looked at that were sent by SIS Madeira to central SIS 
have gone beyond the legal jurisdiction of the SIS." 
  [Abecassis] The minister said this was a serious affair, and 
to make things clear he announced one resignation and one 
dismissal. 
  [Loureiro] "Hence, I have decided to dismiss, as of today, 
the regional director of SIS Madeira, who is the SIS regional 
delegate in that autonomous region. In the meantime, SIS 
Director General Ladeiro Monteiro has tendered his resignation. 
He believes that, despite not being directly responsible for 
the reports, he had suggested the appointment of the regional 
director of the SIS. Therefore, he felt objectively responsible 
and decided to resign. This is a gesture I praise because it is 
a very dignified gesture." 
  [Abecassis] [passage omitted] As for the alleged involvement 
of SIS in the bugging of the attorney general's office, Dias 
Loureiro said that there was no proof so far. Just to be on the 
safe side, however, the monitoring council would follow events 
closely and could open another investigation into SIS activities. 
  [Loureiro] "The monitoring council has every power to 
monitor 
SIS activities. I, for one, would like the monitoring council 
to do so every time it feels it is justified, whether in 
connection with this affair or other issues. The monitoring 
council is not the main body in charge of monitoring, or rather, 
in charge of the inquiry into the appearance of a bugging device 
in the attorney general's office. As you know, it is the police 
who are in charge of this.... Besides, there is no proof of the 
SIS's involvement at the moment. The monitoring council said in 
its report that it wishes to follow this matter closely. It has 
not asked for special resources. It shall have them when it 
does." 
  [Abecassis] Dias Loureiro expressed total confidence in the 
mechanisms set up to monitor the SIS. He also clearly 
reiterated his confidence in the activities of the secret 
services. 
  [Loureiro] "I maintain my confidence. I have no reason not 
to do so. I also saw with my own eyes what happened regarding 
the reports from Madeira, and I want to make this clear. 
Obviously, I am not going to reveal their content. It was not 
a case of investigations as such, however, but it was more like 
a news report, here and there, opinions that, indeed, are not 
the job of the secret services. What I said is that there must 
be strict compliance with the law in these matters. Even though 
it was just news -- who said what, what is being said -- even 
this goes beyond the jurisdiction of the SIS. There is no room 
for ambiguity in these matters. There must be strict compliance 
with the law. Therefore, I decided to relieve the director 
general of the SIS from his post." [passage omitted]

university professor, was interviewed in the 12 May Lisbon 
weekly VISAO by Lurdes Feio. Among other questions, he was asked 
whether he thought Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva will run 
for the presidency when President Mario Soares' term ends. 
Rebelo de Sousa answered that he believes the prime minister 
will seek another absolute majority in the 1995 legislative 
elections instead. He thinks so, he said, because of the prime 
minister's efforts to mend fences with Soares and his 
involvement in mobilizing the party. Rebelo de Sousa noted that 
it would be possible for Cavaco Silva to run in the year 2001 if 
in 1999 he thought that conditions were ripe, and if a 
constitutional revision that he as prime minister would launch 
gave more powers to the presidency. When asked who the PSD's 
presidential candidate would be, Rebelo de Sousa named longtime 
PSD luminary Eurico de Melo, but also former Prime Minister 
Francisco Pinto Balsemao, who has "reappeared" on the political 
scene after a long eclipse. Rebelo de Sousa also commented on 
potential candidates such as former Minister of Foreign Affairs 
Joao de Deus Pinheiro -- now an EU commissioner -- who, however, 
is "far away" and ought to support Balsemao, PSD official Alvaro 
Barreto, who seems to have "dropped out," and former Center 
Social Democratic (CDS) party leader Diogo Ferreira do Amaral, 
who would "fit the position of prime minister better" as an 
eventual successor of Cavaco Silva. Rebelo de Sousa also said 
that both Madeira regional President Alberto Joao Jardim and 
Azores regional President Mota Amaral, who are considered 
potential candidates, have been "weakened" in national terms 
because of their present positions. Referring to a candidate 
outside the PSD, Rebelo de Sousa said that the best known is 
former President Ramalho Eanes, despite his affirmation that he 
does not envisage an immediate candidacy. According to Rebelo de 
Sousa, "it is always a mistake to return to positions occupied 
in different historic contexts." When Lurdes Feio pointed out 
that General Eanes's popularity scores are higher than the prime 
minister's, Rebelo de Sousa said that people already perceive 
that Cavaco Silva will not run. On the opposition side, Rebelo 
de Sousa opined that Socialist Party (PS) leader Antonio 
Guterres "will do everything in his power" to prevent the 
candidady of Lisbon Mayor Jorge Sampaio because of poor personal 
relations and the fear that Sampaio would not be "propitious" 
for him. Asked whether PS official Joao Soares could become 
party leader, Rebelo de Sousa thought not, arguing that Porto 
Mayor Fernando Gomes carries "more political weight." Turning to 
Cavaco Silva's succession, he said Minister of Defense Fernando 
Nogueira is the most frequently mentioned candidate, despite the 
fact "he lacks strong charisma as a leader." Others could be 
Ferreira do Amaral, who has more of a populist profile and 
Miguel Cadilhe, who was a "great" minister of finance. Rebelo de 
Sousa concluded by saying that even if he "does not feel great 
affection" for the prime minister, they maintain a relationship 
of "mutual respect."

  [Text] The Spanish Government denied today that it had sold 
weapons to the Angolan authorities. It did confirm that Spain 
was supporting the training of the Angolan Government police. 
Vasco Lourinho reports from Madrid. 
  [Lourinho] New scandals are being uncovered as 
investigations 
proceed into the Luis Roldan affair. The former head of the 
Civil Guard was a discreet intermediate in the sale of Spanish 
weapons to Angola worth 40 billion escudos. The operation was 
carried out with the knowledge of Foreign Minister Xavier 
Solana, who less than a year ago was still trying to deny what 
was a reality. 
  [Begin recording] [Solana in Spanish with superimposed 
Portuguese translation] As you know, we have a commitment to 
Angola. We are contributing to the UN initiatives -- that is our 
role and no more. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] And the weapons? 
  [Solana] We did not sell weapons. We have a commitment with 
the police that we are fulfilling. [end recording] 
  [Lourinho] The deal was made by the Spanish public company 
(DEFEX), which with the help of Luis Roldan, disguised the 
weapons as antiriot equipment.

<F P=106> [Josep Gisbert report: "Pujol Asserts That CiU's Support </F>
for Government Does Not Depend on European Elections"] 
  [Excerpt] Barcelona -- Jordi Pujol asserted yesterday that 
"our support" for the government "does not depend on the 
European elections, which were not called in order to say who 
should govern Spain; rather, it depends on our reaching 
agreement to carry out the policy that must be effected in the 
economic, labor, and autonomy fields, and on the government's 
acting severely against the corruption cases." 
  At the news conference following the latest cabinet meeting, 
held yesterday, the Generalitat [Catalan autonomous government] 
president stressed that "it is these criteria that guide us, 
because the best thing for the country is that there be 
stability"; not the results of the European elections, "which 
will perhaps be important and crucial for the PSOE [Spanish 
Socialist Workers Party] and for the government, but not for 
us." Jordi Pujol, who stated that "we do not know what will 
happen 13 June, not because of us but because of what the PSOE 
may do," thus made it clear that the outcome of the European 
elections will not affect his support for the government, and 
that, in any event, the initiative for what might happen in 
Spain's political life the day after 12 June remains in the 
hands of Felipe Gonzalez himself. 
<H5>  Call for Calm </H5>
  Concern about the aspersions that the PSOE and People's 
Party 
leaders are exchanging in this framework was also expressed by 
the Generalitat president, who stated: "I never assess favorably 
wounding tones from anybody -- neither PSOE people not People's 
Party people." Jordi Pujol's opinion is that "this is not a 
good approach," because "the atmosphere of constant threat is 
not good, nor is that of radical attacks, which seem to show 
that there is a desire for destruction." In view of this, he 
showed himself opposed to "everybody's excesses of language," 
and called for calm and "forgoing aggressive and not always 
accurate criticism and insults, since, although everybody does 
what he can, there are sometimes people who use this approach 
because they really have nothing else to say." 
  The Generalitat president, who specified that CiU 
[Convergence and Union] will not allow itself to be swept along 
by this dynamic, finally demanded that "everybody restrain 
themselves," although he expressed his doubts about achieving 
this in view of the "insults and slanders" that are being 
leveled, and when "there are rallies such as last weekend's," 
referring to the Socialist Party of Catalonia meeting in 
Barcelona, at which Narcis Serra severely criticized Jose Maria 
Aznar, and the People's Party meeting in Moron de la Frontera 
(Seville), at which both the PSOE and CiU were very harshly 
attacked. For his part, Miquel Roca also condemned yesterday 
the aspersions that the PSOE and the People's Party are 
exchanging, and, referring to the People's Party rally, stated 
that "to say that Felipe Gonzalez is selling Spain out to Jordi 
Pujol is unfair, offensive, and very unpleasant nonsense, aimed 
solely at stirring up an anti-Catalan message based on 
demagoguery; and demagoguery only creates problems that are 
difficult to resolve." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Politicians, Which Have Been </F>
Appointed To Assess Feasibility of Various Coalitions, Seek To 
Achieve Succinct Government Agreement"] 
  [Excerpt] De Vriess of the PvdA [Labor Party], Van Aardenne 
of the VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy], and Vis 
of the D66 [Democrats 66], appointed by the crown to assess 
possibilities for forming a government, are seeking to achieve a 
succinct government agreement. This would be confined to 
difficult questions which could quickly trip up a "purple" [the 
VVD, the PvdA, and the D66] government, a spokesman for the 
three "investigators" indicated yesterday. 
  PvdA leader Kok also called for a "succinct, but solid" 
government pact outlining the basic ideas. "We must not be too 
restrictive, but we must impede the political parties from using 
the government agreement for their own purposes." 
  Kok wants to see "a unifying line" in the government 
agreement in order to "restore confidence in democracy." He 
believes there is an urgent need for this due to the 
"fragmentation, protest votes, and votes supposedly out of 
self-interest" during the elections for the Second Chamber. 
  De Vries, Van Aardenne, and Vis believe they will be able to 
get down to serious negotiations on the formation of a "purple" 
government on Thursday [19 May]. Major stumbling blocks will 
have to be tackled immediately, such as the future of social 
security, the extent of cutbacks, and the situation surrounding 
residing aliens. 
  Moreover, they believe it will be clear within about two 
weeks whether there is any chance of the parties reaching an 
agreement and therefore if there is any purpose in pursuing the 
negotiations. 
  Beginning this week, the three "investigators" will try to 
reach an agreement on the method of working during subsequent 
weeks. This involves deciding on the order in which subjects 
are to be discussed. Another question is whether the three 
party leaders involved in the negotiations can be accompanied by 
party experts in particular fields. 
  Yesterday, the "investigators" discussed this with party 
leaders Kok and Bolkestein (VVD); today they are to meet with 
D66 leader Van Mierlo. 
  Kok has recommended first assessing all the problems. He 
finds that methodology better than always taking one subject at 
a time and sticking with it until the end. He sees the most 
important question as being the promotion of job opportunities 
"at a social cost which is fairly distributed." He has also 
cited the environment and law and order as major subjects. 
  The VVD party has decided to set up two working groups that 
will provide negotiator Bolkestein with files on subjects to be 
discussed at the negotiations. One working group will 
concentrate on financial and economic affairs, and the other on 
remaining matters.

  [Text] There are unclear reports from New York about the 
postponement of the UN secretary general's report to the 
Security Council. Last night, UN alternate spokesman 'Ahmad 
Fawzi said the report would be submitted by the end of the week 
and clarified that the international organization has no 
information that Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas has 
accepted the confidence-building measures [CBM's]. 
  But the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation correspondent in New 
York reported that according to UN Security Council circles, 
after intervention by Turkish diplomats, the Turkish side has 
been given a new extension until the end of May. According to 
the same information, Inal Batu, the Turkish permanent 
representative to the United Nations, sought a meeting with 
Marrack Goulding, Alternate UN Secretary General, at which time 
he conveyed a Turkish Government request that the report not be 
submitted before 31 May. His justification was that the Turkish 
Cypriot community is still holding meetings with Gustave 
Feissel, the UN secretary general's alternate special 
representative in Cyprus. The Turkish representative also 
claimed that Denktas informed Ankara of his decision to accept 
the 21 March UN document on the CBM's but said he could not 
announce it to Feissel before the extraordinary meetings of the 
pseudogovernment and the pseudoparliament today and tomorrow 
respectively. 
  According to our correspondent, UN Security Council circles 
said the Turkish side was given the requested extension after it 
was stressed that no new extension would be given. U.S. 
officials said an extension would not be given even for the 
so-called referendum that Denktas may attempt to hold.

<F P=106> ["eli/ub"-signed report: "Bonn: No Medical Troops to </F>
Rwanda"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free 
Democratic Party of Germany) has joined Volker Ruehe (Christian 
Democratic Union) in his decision not to send German medical 
troops to civil war-stricken Rwanda for the time being. Ruehe 
had said: "We will not send our troops to Rwanda." The Foreign 
Ministry said that if the defense minister, who is the minister 
responsible for such missions, finds that the use of German 
troops is out of the question, the foreign minister can only 
agree to that view. 
  A week ago, the United Nations had asked Bonn via the German 
Mission in New York whether it would be prepared to send a 
medical unit of 100 soldiers, a field hospital, and 50 vehicles, 
as well as an air transport unit to Rwanda. In a paper 
assessing the matter, the Foreign Office says that this was a 
"deviation from general practice." Usually, such requests are 
made orally and on all the members of the community. In the 
case of Rwanda, Germany was approached direct and in writing. 
This shows the urgency with which the matter is being treated 
and the pressure that the Security Council is putting behind the 
request. 
  Irrespective of this request, a Bundeswehr Transall aircraft 
is to take drugs and food to Rwanda. Government spokesman 
Dieter Vogel said that the cabinet is "clearly willing" to meet 
a relevant request by UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali. But 
first it must be clarified whether the situation is secure 
enough for such a mission. The Transall plane is to operate as a 
shuttle taking drugs and food from Nairobi to the Rwandan 
capital Kigali. 
  The request from New York for the deployment of medical 
troops has not yet been officially decided in Bonn. Ruehe said 
that the security situation in Rwanda has to be clarified first 
and the conflicting parties must agree to the mission. Also, 
irritations must be avoided prior to the Federal Constitutional 
Court passing its judgment on international Bundeswehr missions. 
  The Foreign Ministry said that there is absolute chaos in 
Rwanda. The security of German medical troops would not be 
safeguarded. Kinkel is torn between two opinions in the Rwanda 
question. On the one hand he said that Germany must not stand 
aside when there is a genocide happening. On the other hand, he 
said that no European country is currently prepared to send 
troops to the African country. 
  Kinkel and Ruehe had already discussed the UN request on 
Wednesday [18 May]. In this discussion, Kinkel was especially 
responsive to the argument of danger to German troops. The 
decision to provide the Transall was made in a talk between 
Kinkel, Ruehe, and Friedrich Bohl, the minister in the 
Chancellor's Office.

    [Editorial Report] On 4 May the European Parliament (EP) 
passed a motion in Strasbourg reminding Italy, which is 
currently organizing a new government that includes members of 
the neofascist National Alliance (AN), that it must continue 
adherence to the principles it endorsed as a founding member of 
the European Union (EU). Reaction in the Italian press has 
varied from condemnation of the motion to demands that the AN 
formally reject fascism. 
  The motion, which passed by one vote, stated: "The European 
Parliament demands that EU members let the president of the 
Republic of Italy clearly know that his government must be 
faithful to the fundamental values upon which the European 
Community was founded, after the horrors of fascism and Nazism." 
Only the Italian-language version of the motion contained the 
reference to the "horrors of fascism and Nazism," which prompted 
an apology and a promise to investigate the matter from EP 
President Egon Klepsch, according to the Turin daily LA STAMPA 
of 5 May. 
<H5>  Top Leaders React </H5>
  An article in the Milan daily IL SOLE--24 ORE of 6 May 
reported that Italy's top political leaders denounced the EU 
motion. According to the daily, the motion prompted a "harsh" 
reply by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro. The president of the 
Senate, Carlo Scognamiglio, and of the Chamber of Deputies, 
Irene Pivetti, wrote letters to Klepsch expressing their "strong 
regret" for the approval of a motion which to many "seemed like 
interference in national sovereignty." The article reported 
that Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and Luigi Abete, president 
of the General Confederation of Italian Industry 
(Confindustria), lauded Scalfaro's reply, as did outgoing Prime 
Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. According to the article, 
Berlusconi said the EP is "incapable of understanding the new" 
and is guilty of "reasoning with the old schemes." National 
Alliance (AN) leader Gianfranco Fini said the motion was "an 
instrumental polemic carried out by the Left, destined to be 
deflated as soon as the government receives the confidence of 
parliament." Northern League ideologue Gianfranco Miglio said 
it was a "classic case of limitation of sovereignty." The 
leftist opposition, from Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) 
Secretary Achille Occhetto to Communist Renewal member Ersilia 
Salvato, were less offended and said they could not understand 
Scalfaro's reaction, because the motion in no way damaged 
Italy's independence and was a "legitimate" and even "opportune" 
political act, the article reported. Outgoing Foreign Minister 
Beniamino Andreatta of the Italian Popular Party said the motion 
expressed the "sentiment that is widespread among European 
leaders." 
<H5>  Invalidating Motion Considered </H5>
  An article by IL SOLE's EU correspondent Adriana Cerretelli, 
which appeared on the same date, reported on efforts by Klepsch 
to smooth things over by saying he "deplored the assembly's 
undeserved unwarranted interference in the affairs of a member 
state" and did not exclude that the vote could be invalidated 
because of the difference in the text between the Italian 
version and those in other languages. Italian Social Movement 
Eurodeputy Cristiana Muscardini has requested that the vote be 
invalidated, saying the motion was "unjust interference in the 
nomination process of Italian ministers and a serious injury to 
the dignity of, as well as discrimination against, the new 
majority which resulted from democratic elections." According 
to Cerretelli, certain "ill-intentioned" individuals connected 
the affair to PDS leader Occhetto's presence at the parliament 
during the vote. 
<H5>  Commentaries Assess EU Jurisdiction, AN Values </H5>
  In a commentary in Milan's PANORAMA of 14 May, Gianni Baget 
Bozzo wrote that in trying to exert power the EP often exceeds 
its jurisdiction, but that it has never gone as far as its 
recent instructions to Scalfaro on the moral and political 
standards of the new government. According to Baget Bozzo, 
Italy's longtime loyalty has been repaid by an insult. It is 
understandable, he wrote, that the mere fact "postfascists" will 
sit in the EP could upset some individuals, but the concern is 
excessive and self-serving. After having accepted for years 
that Italy was a country where communism was different because 
of national character, it was incorrectly believed Italy's 
European partners would think the same about the neofascist 
party. Baget Bozzo suggested that Italians explain to their 
European counterparts that the neofascists have been members of 
Italian democracy since 1947 and have in fact been regularly 
used in the political game by both the Christian Democrats (DC) 
and the Communists. The DC used them as allies and the 
Communists never wanted the party outlawed for fear their votes 
would go to the DC, giving it an absolute majority. Thus the 
European partners have collaborated with a political system in 
which the neofascists were a functional part, Baget Bozzo wrote. 
It is precisely because it is so old that the Italian 
neofascist party cannot be compared with the French, German, and 
Austrian nationalist movements. The National Alliance is more 
postfascist than the progressives are postcommunists, Baget 
Bozzo maintained. In any case, Baget Bozzo argued, no EU 
institution can dispute the composition of the government of a 
member state. 
  PANORAMA correspondent Renzo Rosati wrote on the same day 
that the verb "demand" is not part of the regular Europarliament 
vocabulary. It has never been used in reference to the highest 
institutions of an EU member. Rosati thus found Scalfaro 
entirely justified when he wrote the EU that "Italy's loyalty to 
the principles which are at the roots of Europe is a clear and 
undisputed fact that does not need reminders or instructors." 
  Commentator Marcello Sorgi wrote in the Turin daily LA 
STAMPA 
of 5 May that, although the Parliament's motion "constitutes an 
absolutely exceptional incident and unprecedented interference 
by a supranational organ in the political and institutional life 
of a member country," it is also a fact that the current 
situation in Italy is seen throughout West Europe as an anomaly. 
To date, little emphasis has been placed on the problem of 
having postfascists in a government that is a member of the EU, 
Sorgi maintained. Thanks to the European reaction to this 
phenomenon it can no longer be ignored. 
  In addition to its news reports on the incident, LA STAMPA 
of 
6 May reported the comments of former Chamber of Deputies 
President Nilde Iotti of the PDS. Iotti said she could 
understand how the Italian situation may be viewed as worrisome 
but added that the Europarliament's resolution was a little 
"overbearing." She could not recall a position of this type 
ever being taken before and called it an interference in Italian 
internal affairs. Iotti termed the motion "something unusual 
and of a certain seriousness." She said that President 
Scalfaro, rather than express offense, should have tried to 
offer the Europeans some guarantees. 
  Also on 6 May, LA STAMPA ran a front-page commentary by 
journalist Sergio Romano in which he said that although no 
European forum exists that can dictate regulations on the 
formation of the Berlusconi government, an "Italian problem" 
does exist which can "upset foreign observers." If the First 
Republic had not gone into crisis, Romano wrote, the AN would 
still be an outsider and no one would have asked AN leader Fini 
to cut his ties with the hardline members of his party. 
According to Romano, Fini seems determined to promote democracy 
in his party; he must, therefore, recognize the two souls of the 
AN, reject the undemocratic one, and bring to full completion 
the democratization process begun a few months ago. Fini must 
do this, Romano wrote, because the people have a right to know 
exactly what the AN is, what its ideology and political values 
are, what programs it intends to work for. If he does this 
quickly, Romano concludes, "no one will pay attention to the 
`Catos' in Strasbourg; if he continues to hesitate, the 
Berlusconi government will be born with an `original sin' for 
which everyone will end up paying." 
  Angelo Bolaffi's commentary in the Rome daily IL MESSAGGERO 
of 6 May tried to assess whether the "Italian case" was provoked 
by "unjustified reactions and ill-intentioned insinuations." He 
concluded that the EP motion expressed a real problem in the 
wrong way. Thus the motion cannot be ignored and rejected as an 
inadmissible intrusion in the internal affairs of the country. 
According to Bolaffi, the way the vote was held was a mistake, 
as it split the Parliament in two. Since those who voted 
against the motion can hardly be suspected of being fascists, it 
is evident, he wrote, that the motion distorted the facts in a 
way that damaged the image of European institutions. "Why 
criticize Berlusconi's intentions without first waiting to see 
what the outcome will be?" Romano asked. A real problem does 
exist, he added, observing that during AN demonstrations the 
fascist "Roman salute" is still in use and Fini pretends not to 
see it. More clarity is needed from the AN, especially a formal 
condemnation of the fascist era. The AN must do what the old 
Italian Communist Party did--make a formal act of abjuration. 
Otherwise, it will continue to be politically excluded in Europe. 
  The Rome daily LA REPUBBLICA of 6 May published a front-page 
commentary by journalist Alberto Cavallari saying that the clash 
between Scalfaro and the EP over the entry of neofascists in the 
Italian Government presents some real problems. First, it is an 
interference by the EU in the internal affairs of a member 
state. Second, it shows a lack of respect for the will of the 
Italian people, which was violated by the warning issued in 
Strasbourg. Third is the international isolation Italy is 
risking with a government that includes neofascists; the 
Rome-Strasbourg clash confirms this possibility. While the EP 
motion has created these problems, Cavallari nevertheless wrote 
that the EP has a right to make appeals and issue instructions 
to its member states because it was legally elected by those 
states. The EU is no longer an economic community but a 
European political union that is headed towards 
supranationality. It therefore has the legitimate right to 
issue ethical and political guidance to its member states. Were 
that not the case, the EP could never vote on decisions that in 
any way modify the sovereignty of its members. Europe, 
Cavallari observed, is not "foreign": "We are this Europe; its 
parliamentarians are ours."

<F P=106> [EC Press Release No. PRES/94/97: "Ministerial Meeting and </F>
Fifth GCC-EU Joint Council"] 
  [Text] Riyadh, 8 May -- The fifth session of the Joint 
Council established in accordance with the cooperation agreement 
between the EU [European Union] on the one hand, and the 
countries parties to the charter of the Cooperation Council for 
the Arab States of the Gulf (UAE, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Oman, 
Qatar and Kuwait) [GCC] on the other hand, was held in Riyadh, 
Saudi Arabia on 8 May 1994. 
  Both sides discussed a number of regional and international 
questions of common interest in an open and constructive way, 
with a view to fostering cooperation between their two regions. 
  The Joint Council reviewed developments in commercial and 
economic cooperation between the two sides. Ministers noted the 
continuing importance of bilateral trade relations. They 
welcomed the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round and the 
signature of the final act in Marrakesh on 12-15 April 1994 
which would provide a major boost to the improving prospects for 
the world economy. GCC ministers informed EU ministers of the 
recent actions of GCC countries to become full members of the 
GATT or to make applications for membership. EU ministers 
welcomed these developments as positive steps which would 
contribute to the strengthening of the international trading 
system. Ministers welcomed prospects of EU and GCC countries 
being members of the new world trade organization. 
  The Joint Council received a report from the Joint 
Cooperation Committee on implementation of the cooperation 
agreement. 
  The Joint Council took note of the report of the ad hoc 
group 
on the interrelated issues of energy and environment which had 
been set up in accordance with the Joint Council's decision to 
continue the EU-GCC dialogue on these issues. Ministers agreed 
that the report was an excellent, comprehensive study which 
constituted a useful basis for clarifying the relevant issues 
and providing guidance for future cooperation between the two 
parties. 
  The Joint Council agreed that cooperation in the field of 
energy and the environment should be based on the principles and 
objectives of the EU-GCC cooperation agreement and should also 
be guided by the principles of GATT and moves towards a more 
balanced world economy and more liberalised world trade regime. 
  Ministers recognised the interrelationships between energy 
and economic growth policies on the one hand, and environment 
policies on the other hand. They took note of forecasts in the 
report of continuing world economic growth and growth in world 
demand for energy as well as prospects for increasing EU-GCC 
energy interdependence. They noted the complementary aspects of 
the environment/energy/economic growth relationship and the need 
for appropriate policies to deal with these issues without 
arresting economic growth or harming the international flow of 
trade. 
  Ministers noted the importance of stability and transparency 
in world energy markets and that balanced supply and demand 
would be in the best interests of both suppliers and consumers 
of energy and would also facilitate energy investment. 
  Regarding global environment concerns, ministers recognised 
that the Framework Convention on Climate Change seeks to find 
reasonable, balanced and comprehensive approaches to the issue 
of climate change consistent with sustainable development. 
  Ministers agreed to continue the dialogue on the important 
energy/environment interrelationship and reaffirmed their 
commitment to strengthen economic and trade relations in 
accordance with the principles and objectives of the cooperation 
agreement. 
  The Joint Council approved the recommendations and proposals 
for cooperation on other subjects contained in the report of the 
Joint Cooperation Committee. 
  Ministers welcomed the proposals for a three-year programme 
of cooperation agreed between the standardisation and metrology 
organization of the GCC countries and the European Commission 
and European standards organizations. They supported the 
proposal of the Joint Cooperation Committee to examine the 
possibility of increasing EU investment and joint venture 
creation in the GCC region and in this connection drew attention 
to the important contribution which would be made by the third 
EU-GCC industrial conference to be held in Muscat in 1995. The 
Joint Council expressed satisfaction with the extensive two-year 
programme of training GCC customs officials prepared by the 
official consortium of EU customs services and urged the joint 
cooperation committee to intensify human resources development 
cooperation. The Joint Council approved the decisions of the 
Joint Cooperation Committee to convene meetings of the 
Industrial Cooperation Working Group, the Energy Group and the 
Environment Group to draw up new proposals for cooperation in 
the respective sectors. 
  Both sides reiterated their determination to speedily 
conclude the ongoing free trade negotiations. 
  The ministers of the EU and the GCC countries had a full 
exchange of views on developments in their two regions. 
  The ministers reviewed a series of international and 
regional political issues of mutual interest in an open and 
cordial manner. In this respect, they were guided by their 
continued commitment to the principles enshrined in the UN 
charter and the principles of international law applicable to 
the development of cordial relations among nations. The GCC 
ministers, while noting the diversity of systems of values, 
which should be taken fully into consideration, joined the EU 
ministers in reiterating their continuing commitment to the 
promotion of human rights. They reaffirmed their commitment to 
respect for the sovereignty, unity, independence and territorial 
integrity of all states and held these principles to be 
universal in character and therefore applicable equally. 
  The ministers noted with the utmost concern the continued 
Iraqi defiance of UN Security Council resolutions. They 
reiterated their view that prompt and full Iraqi implementation 
of all relevant Security Council resolutions remained a 
prerequisite for the establishment of peace and stability in the 
Gulf region. In this context, the ministers condemned the Iraqi 
regime for its failure to implement Security Council resolutions 
in full and its policy of selectivity in implementing such 
resolutions. In particular, the ministers underlined the 
importance they attached to Iraq's full and unconditional 
compliance with Resolution 687 concerning the immediate release 
of all Kuwaiti and other POWs and detainees held by Iraq, Iraq's 
weapons of mass destruction, and Iraq's payment of full 
compensation for the losses and damages caused by her aggression 
against the State of Kuwait. The ministers reiterated their 
support for Security Council Resolution 833 which reaffirms the 
inviolability of the international borders of the State of 
Kuwait and endorses the final report of the special UN committee 
entrusted with the demarcation of the Iraqi/Kuwaiti 
international borders. 
  Reaffirming their governments' continued commitment to the 
unity, territorial integrity and sovereignty of Iraq, the 
ministers expressed alarm and dismay at the continued repression 
and sufferings of the entire Iraqi population, for which the 
Iraqi regime bears sole responsibility. The ministers stressed 
the need for Iraq's unconditional compliance with and effective 
implementation of Security Council Resolutions 688, 706 and 712. 
  The ministers emphasised the need for cooperation and 
peaceful coexistence among all states in the Gulf region based 
on respect for recognized norms and principles of international 
law. They acknowledged the right of countries to acquire the 
means to defend themselves, but expressed concern over arms 
acquisition policies which were not justified by the 
requirements of legitimate defence. They expressed their strong 
belief that individual countries' arms procurement should not 
pose a threat to regional stability. The ministers reaffirmed 
their strong opposition to all forms of terrorism, whatever 
their origin, cause and motive, as well as subversive activities 
in other countries. Basing themselves on the principles of 
non-interference in the internal affairs of other states and 
respect for national laws, the ministers expressed their strong 
belief that no state was entitled to apply its laws outside its 
boundaries or to assume the jurisdiction of another sovereign 
state. 
  In this respect the ministers noted with concern the lack of 
progress in the dialogue between the United Arab Emirates and 
the Islamic Republic of Iran over the question of the three 
islands. In this context, the foreign minister of the United 
Arab Emirates briefed the ministers on the initiative of His 
Highness Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan, president of the 
United Arab Emirates, calling for a resolution to the question 
through negotiations in accordance with international law and 
peaceful co-existence among states. The ministers called on the 
Islamic Republic of Iran to respond positively to this 
initiative. 
  The ministers reaffirmed their commitment to the non- 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. They reiterated 
their commitment to promoting the establishment of a zone free 
from all weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East and 
called upon all countries not yet parties to non proliferation 
treaties [NPT] to become signatories to them as soon as 
possible. They noted with satisfaction that the Convention on 
Non-Proliferation of Chemical Weapons which constitutes an 
essential contribution to the establishment of zones free from 
all weapons of mass destruction has been signed by a large 
number of countries both in Europe and in the Middle East and 
urged all countries in both regions to do so. 
  In this context the ministers expressed their hope for a 
successful conclusion of the NPT at the 1995 conference. 
  The ministers reviewed developments in the Middle East peace 
process. They paid tribute to the vision and courage of the 
Palestinian and Israeli leaders who signed the historic 
Declaration of Principles in Washington on 13 September 1993, 
which represented a breakthrough in the peace process. 
  The ministers reiterated their governments' support for UN 
Security Council Resolution 904/94, which called for the 
establishment of a temporary international presence in the 
occupied territories and was adopted following the massacre at 
Hebron. The ministers expressed their abhorrence for and 
condemnation of all acts of violence against innocent civilians 
and their sorrow at the resulting loss of life. The ministers 
agreed that such tragic events highlighted the importance of the 
peace process under way, which should not be interrupted. 
  The ministers appealed for the question of the safety of 
Palestinians to be addressed urgently in accordance with the 
Fourth Geneva Convention. They reiterated their view that the 
Israeli settlements in the occupied territories, including east 
Jerusalem, are illegal under international law and constitute an 
obstacle to peace. In the EU's view, the lifting of the Arab 
boycott would also contribute to furthering the cause of the 
peace process. 
  The ministers welcomed the agreement on Gaza/Jericho signed 
in Cairo on 4 may and expressed their complete support for its 
full and early implementation. They urged all sides to 
cooperate in ensuring the successful implementation of the 
agreement. They highlighted the importance they attach to the 
achievement of early and substantial progress in the other 
bilateral negotiations, particularly the Syrian track, with a 
view to ensuring a just, comprehensive and durable peace in the 
Middle East. 
  The ministers expressed the determination of the EU and the 
GCC to continue to play an active and constructive role in the 
multilateral negotiations, which complement but are not a 
substitute for the bilateral tracks. The ministers reiterated 
their view that substantial progress in the bilaterals would 
greatly contribute to the success of the multilaterals. Both 
sides reiterated the importance of all forms of assistance, 
including economic assistance, to the occupied territories. 
  Both sides reaffirmed their support for the Ta'if Accord as 
the best basis for enabling the state of Lebanon to extend its 
authority over the totality of the Lebanese territories and for 
preserving Lebanon's independence, sovereignty, unity and 
territorial integrity. The ministers expressed their 
satisfaction with the progress achieved in the context of this 
accord. They remain committed to participation in Lebanon's 
reconstruction. 
  EU ministers briefed GCC ministers on progress made in the 
development of its relations with the Maghreb; and on their 
efforts to secure the implementation by Libya and others of 
Security Council Resolutions 731, 748 and 883. 
  The ministers were deeply concerned by the eruption of the 
hostilities in Yemen. They called on all the parties concerned 
to exercise self-restraint, cease hostilities, listen to the 
dictates of reason and dialogue and place the interests of the 
people of Yemen above all other considerations. 
  The ministers welcomed the agreement on a constitution for a 
Muslim-Croat Federation and the cease fire in central Bosnia. 
They condemned the attack against Gorazde. They called for 
full respect for all safe areas and for the strengthening of 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces in Yugoslavia] with a view to 
ensuring that the ceasefire is maintained, the safety of these 
areas is ensured and normal life can be restored. 
  The ministers expressed full support for the efforts of the 
international community to reach an early negotiated settlement 
of the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina acceptable to all parties. 
In this context they underscored that the parameters of the EU 
action plan, which have been approved by all the parties in 
Geneva, remain a solid basis for reaching a comprehensive 
agreement, not only for Bosnia-Herzegovina, but in the former 
Yugoslavia as a whole. 
  The GCC ministers expressed the view that the arms embargo 
be 
lifted so as to allow Bosnia-Herzegovina the right of 
self-defence in accordance with article 51 of the UN charter. 
  The ministers reiterated that those responsible for brutal 
violations of human rights in the former Yugoslavia must be held 
personally accountable and urged all countries to actively 
cooperate with the international war crimes tribunal. 
  The ministers underlined that their countries must stand 
prepared to contribute to the future process of implementing a 
peace settlement as well as political and economic 
reconstruction in the former Yugoslavia. 
  Both sides agreed that the sixth meeting of the Joint 
Council 
will be held in the European Union in the first half of 1995.

<F P=106> [Report by Emma Tuckers in Paris and Andrew Hill in Milan: </F>
"Brussels to Scrap Steel Industry Rescue Plan"] 
  [Text] The European Commission [EC] threw EU [European 
Union] steel producers into confusion yesterday after a surprise 
announcement that it was scrapping its plans to rescue the 
crisis-stricken industry. 
  The announcement came from Mr Karel Van Miert, the 
competition commissioner, and coarchitect of the 12-month-old 
steel rescue plan, who left the industry uncertain as to whether 
this was a tactical move or the end of the plan. 
  Hopes for achieving an essential 5 million extra tonnes of 
capacity cuts from Italy were scuppered after Mr Van Miert 
suffered an unexpected defeat at the hands of his fellow 
commissioners at a meeting on Wednesday [18 May] evening. 
  They were alarmed by the dubious legality of the use of 
state 
funds for restructuring at the privately owned Bresciani steel 
mills of northern Italy. 
  Mr Van Miert said the Italian reductions represented the 
last 
hope for achieving a minimum 19 million tonnes of capacity cuts 
considered necessary to save the industry. 
  "The plan is dead," said Mr Van Miert. "It is obvious we are 
not going to get near the target. But don't blame us. We 
tried." 
  But during the meeting, Sir Leon Brittan, the external 
affairs commissioner, backed by the commission's legal 
department pointed out that the deal would be difficult to 
reconcile with European law. It would also jeopardise 
negotiations for a multinational steel agreement and contravene 
the subsidies code of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement 
on Tariffs and Trade. 
  Sir Leon's case rested on the fact that state aid offered to 
the Bresciani mills in return for the capacity cuts contravened 
European law. This says that state aid can only be offered to 
steel companies in return for permanent closure. At Bresciani 
the aid was destined for companies proposing only partial 
closure. 
  In spite of Mr Van Miert's strong words and obvious anger, 
senior Commission officials yesterday stressed that the steel 
plan's so-called death had been exaggerated. With the crisis in 
the industry far from resolved, commissioners are unlikely to 
throw out the package entirely. 
  Nonetheless, big doubts about its viability remain. The 11 
million tonnes of capacity cuts achieved so far fall well short 
of the plan's aim for minimum cuts of 19 million tonnes. Even 
if the Commission had accepted Mr Van Miert's latest proposals, 
this would only have achieved, at most, a further 5 million 
tonnes of cuts -- still well short of the target. 
  In addition, the private, unsubsidised steel sector has been 
leery of accepting a rescue package that involves giving state 
aid to subsidised enterprises.

<F P=106> [Interview with European Commissioner for Competition Policy </F>
Karel van Miert by "A. Bo." in Brussels on 19 May: "Yes, Your 
Funding Operations Are Irregular"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- Even now that he had overcome his great 
wrath -- and was sitting in his quiet commissioner's office -- 
Karel van Miert was holding out: "I submitted the plan, and I 
then withdrew it. I fail to see how we can go back now," he 
said. 
  [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] Is there really no way, then, of 
reviving this plan for the steel industry, despite the fact that 
you have now declared it dead? 
  [Van Miert] I see no way. We are not in the position to 
reach, or even to approach, the 19 million ton productive 
capacity reduction quota which had been set by the Council of 
Ministers as a minimum target. We have stopped at 11 million 
tons. Now we have also lost the opportunity to cut back 5 or 6 
million tons in Italy. 
  [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] How did this failure come about? 
  [Van Miert] On the one hand, we had received promises of 
closures which did not materialize. On the other hand, if we 
interpret the aid regulations rigorously, we are forced to 
acknowledge that the Italian funding operations are irregular, 
and therefore the solution envisaged for Italy has also become 
impracticable. 
  [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] Is there no other way to break the 
deadlock? 
  [Van Miert] I can see no other solution. The aid regulations 
are adamant: There can be no funding for partial closures, 
which is what many Italian firms would be prepared to do. Given 
that cutting back 5 or 6 million tons in Brescia was essential 
to the plan's success, we tried to find a solution based on a 
less stringent interpretation of the aid regulations. I did 
everything I could, right from the beginning, to try to 
implement this plan in the interests of the steel sector as a 
whole. However, the Commission has now reached this decision, 
and it has done so knowing what it was up to. I highlighted all 
the consequences of such a decision. I did everything in my 
power. 
  [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] So what will happen now? Will the 
plants have to close down without receiving any aid? 
  [Van Miert] I do not know. We will see. Some will close 
down, others will not. Actually, government funding only 
accounted for a relatively small amount compared to the extent 
of the planned closures. Just think that, in order to cut back 
5 million tons in the public sector, aid had been authorized to 
the tune of 5 billion ECU. Here, barely 400 million ECU had 
been earmarked for an even larger reduction. 
  [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] So will you now impugn the Ciampi 
government's decree? 
  [Van Miert] Of course. I will be forced to do so. Out of a 
sense of loyalty, I must accept the Commission's decision.

<F P=106> [EC Press Release No. IP/94/414: "White Paper Tour of the </F>
Capitals: the Future of Employment in Europe"] 
  [Text] [EC] Commissioner Padraig Flynn yesterday raised the 
stakes regarding Europe's employment problem by reasserting the 
importance to the Union of a sustained and credible attack on 
untenable levels of unemployment, and what this means to the 
basic health of Europe. He had just completed fruitful and 
positive discussions with ministers of the Belgian Government 
concerning the employment dimension of the White Paper on 
Growth, Competitiveness and Employment. This was the ninth step 
of his tour of capitals. 
  With the Corfu Summit only a few weeks away, Commissioner 
Flynn pleaded for greater vision to ensure the future of 
employment in Europe, a plea which he had made in a major 
presentation delivered on Tuesday [17 May] in the University of 
Leuven. 
  In that sometimes controversial address to academics, 
politicians and the wider Flanders Community, Commissioner Flynn 
warned that "we ignore at our peril the human damage and 
dislocation caused by the scale of unemployment we face." 
  In a clear message to member states in the run up to the 
Corfu Summit, he stated that his tour of capitals, to discuss 
follow-up to the White Paper, had heartened him in many ways, 
but had left him with some concerns. 
  "I do not believe that member states have yet fully grasped 
the enormity of the challenge, the urgency of the need for 
collective reflection and coordinated action". 
  Mr Flynn went on to give a strong warning against the 
temptation to simply wait for growth as the solution to the 
union's unemployment problems. 
  "Let us be careful. We need to consider the implications of 
the choices we now make. Do we continue with our short-term -- 
even day-to-day -- approach to managing political, social and 
economic affairs, or do we really engage in a longer term 
strategy. Do we just sigh with relief at the glimmer of 
returning growth, or understand that it is very welcome but far 
from enough." 
  Commissioner Flynn urged the union to commit itself to an 
ambitious and balanced strategy now. He believes that the 
messages which emerge from the Council in June must be 
affirmative and must offer both hope and credibility. 
  "We need to mobilise support on a massive scale, before 
improved, and very welcome, growth offers the illusion of relief 
from the pressure for change. We need to use the breathing 
space which growth will bring over the next couple of years. Or 
the next downturn will be bigger, for more people, than the one 
we have just suffered. The last crash was traumatic for Europe. 
It shook the union, and its reverberations continue." 
  "Make no mistake," he stressed, "if we do not grasp this 
opportunity, we will have left behind too many people and 
families by the time the next crash arrives, as it surely will." 
  But aspiration must be joined to substance in addressing 
such 
complex problems. In this regard the commissioner outlined the 
importance of translating growth into jobs, and stressed that, 
to do so in a sustained and effective way, structural change was 
required. He described the way that new balances could be 
achieved in the design, operation and interplay between 
taxation, social protection and regulation. 
  He believes that it is crucial for governments and the 
social 
partners to look at how to develop new ideas on working time and 
work organisation, new technology and quality of human 
resources, competitiveness and greater employment generation. 
Mr Flynn stressed the importance of the new synergies between 
manufacturing and services, the difficulties and opportunities 
represented by demographic change, and the clear need for social 
protection and taxation systems to be transformed into pathways 
to employment, not barriers to access. 
  At Leuven, Commissioner Flynn recalled that President Delors 
had chosen the single market project as the way to relaunch the 
European endeavour when he became president-elect in 1984. The 
commissioner stated that "in my view the new commission in 1995 
should set as its number one priority the design and 
implementation of a new Europe- wide employment strategy, for 
without this, talk of further integration will ring hollow in 
the hearts and minds of ordinary people, European Union 
citizens." 
  Mr Flynn pointed out that the White Paper offers challenges 
as well as opportunities to all those invested with 
decision-making responsibility, not least in the way that they, 
themselves, now operate, and suggested that perhaps government 
has to reinvent itself, that the dynamics of government, not 
just the workplace, have to change. 
  "Europe can be the crucible for future development for the 
world, a Europe of quality leading the way, engaging its 
citizens. But it is in danger of being looked back on as a 
transient bloc, that did not serve and draw the most potential 
from its human resources," he said.

<F P=106> [Article by John Phillips: "New Boy Swears Allegiance to </F>
European Club"--quotation marks as published] 
  [Text] Italy will consider changing strategy on policy 
areas such as the "potentially dangerous Social Chapter but will 
remain faithful to the ultimate goal of European integration, 
Antonio Martino, the Foreign Minister, said yesterday. 
  "There will be changes in foreign policy but I don't expect 
them to be as dramatic as the political change that has taken 
place in the last election,' the minister said. Signor Martino, 
52, master-mind of Silvio Berlusconi's election-winning economic 
programme, is a witty, approachable man who disarms visitors 
with a charm recalling his roots in one of Messina's oldest 
aristocratic families. He is dean of political science at Rome's 
Luiss University, a disciple of Milton Friedman who speaks 
fluent English and reads P.G. Wodehouse to relax when the strain 
of settling into his new office at the Farnesina over-looking 
the Tiber becomes unbearable. "The curious part is that I am 
considered a Euro-sceptic in this country while some of my 
friends in England consider me a Euro-enthusiast. 
  "When I stress continuity in European policy I mean that the 
ultimate goals will not change,' he says. "When I say there 
might be change I refer to the strategy that may be used to 
achieve those goals. 
  For years followers of Friedrich Hayek and Friedman were 
thin 
on the ground in Italy to the extent, he half jests, that they 
almost felt themselves an endangred species. "Once two 
colleagues of mine and myself were flying from Rome to 
Stockholm. One said `we should never take the same flight 
because if the plane falls all the free marketeers will 
disappear." 
  Forza Italia's success has turned Signor Martino into a 
national guru. But as the son of Gaetano Martino, the 
anglophile Foreign Minister who signed the Treaty of Rome for 
Italy in 1957, he takes a pragmatic approach to his new 
diplomatic responsibilities. "I will study the Social Chapter 
closely because I think I will have to know well what it is all 
about before deciding, he says. "I have expressed the view that 
it is potentially dangerous to try to impose the same standards 
on labour markets all over Europe. We have had something 
similar in this country where we have imposed the same standards 
prevailing in the rich north on the south, the result is we have 
a tremendous difference in unemployment. 
  In the same cautious spirit, he is pondering his position on 
the Delors White Paper to be discussed at the European Foreign 
Ministers' meeting at Corfu. M Delors has mooted the prospect 
of creating 20 million jobs in Europe by 2000, a grandiose plan 
that may also win the outgoing Commission president support in 
his campaign to succeed President Mitterrand at the Elysee 
Palace. 
  "The issue that I consider most important is the financing 
of 
the infrastructure that the Delors plan envisages," Signor 
Martino said. "If the infrastructures are properly financed 
through market mechanisms I would not object to them but if they 
were financed in a non-market way would have strong 
reservations. 
  Italy cannot afford to invest blindly in European fantasies 
any more, he hints, because "unless this country changes its 
course in economic and financial policy it will go bankrupt. 
  He shares British anxieties over excessive Euro-dirgisme 
while recognising that to some extent, some of these directives 
are justified to prevent national governments from interfering 
with free circulation of goods. "In general it seems to me that 
when governments intervene in markets at the national level and 
also at the supernational level they create problems." 
Reflecting on a recent opinion poll that shows Italians more 
pessimistic about Maastricht, Signor Martino adds that the 
diminished enthusiasm is not limited to Italy. 
  Signor Martino has been quick to reassure European 
neighbours 
that Italy is not in the throes of a neo-Fascist revival, 
although five ministers in the new government are from the 
National Alliance, whose main component is the Italian Social 
Movement (MSI), the political heirs of Benito Mussolini.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPE: "General </F>
Affairs Council Supports Energy Charter Compromise"] 
  [Excerpt] The General Affairs Council has adopted 
conclusions on the European Energy Charter. Announcing what 
constituted in his opinion an "important element for conclusion" 
of the negotiations on the Charter in June, Council President 
Theodoros Pangalos, Greek deputy foreign minister, was in fact 
only announcing the event a little early: The Committee of 
Permanent Representatives put the finishing touches on these 
conclusions at its meeting on Wednesday [18 May] and the 
decision will be taken formally (without debate) at the 
Transport Council on 25 May. EUROPE recalls that the European 
Energy Charter was signed in The Hague on 17 December 1991. Its 
purpose is to create the framework of an effective European 
energy market making energy supplies secure, improving energy 
yield and limiting the negative effects of energy generation on 
the environment. Negotiations on the conclusion of a treaty 
have been in progress since September 1991 under the 
chairmanship of Dutch Ambassador Rutten in order to give the 
undertakings made with regard to the Charter a sound and binding 
international legal basis. Mr. Rutten presented a compromise 
text on 22 April last for debate at the plenary session of the 
signatory countries of the Charter scheduled for the week of 6 
June. The Twelve are preparing to take a position on this 
compromise in the following terms. 
  1. The European Union reaffirms its conviction that the 
conclusion, at an early date, of a substantial European Energy 
Charter Treaty is important not only for the future economic 
development of the European continent, but also for political 
stability in the world and the future of international relations. 
  2. At the initiative of the European Union, the Chairman of 
the Conference on the European Energy Charter agreed to draw up 
a final draft compromise of the Charter, which he presented to 
the parties on 22 April 1994. The EU considers that this text 
constitutes a solid basis for concluding the negotiations and 
will incontestably facilitate agreement at the upcoming and 
final plenary session in June 1994. 
  3. Nevertheless, to attain this objective, improvements must 
still be made in a certain number of areas. These include 
questions of trade and investments, as well as the need to 
ensure that the trade provisions of the European Energy Charter 
are fully compatible with the relevant provisions in the 
Treaties or agreements concluded or to be concluded in this 
spirit, and in particular the agreements negotiated or to be 
negotiated with Central and Eastern European countries, as well 
as the Republics of the Commonwealth of Independent States. 
  4. The EU will approach the final session in June with the 
will to reach an agreement on a global compromise, depending on 
satisfactory solutions to its fundamental concerns. It 
reaffirms its commitment to signing such an agreement, along 
with, it hopes, all other parties to the negotiations and is 
convinced that the latter will adopt the same attitude. 
  5. If the June plenary session does not lead to a 
satisfactory solution, the European Union will examine the best 
way of proceeding. It will, however, do all it can for 
negotiations to succeed and is convinced that all the other 
partners in the negotiations will do the same. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Andrew Grice and Michael Prescott report: "Tory Right </F>
Claims Supporters are on Strike Against Major"] 
  [Text] John Major's hopes of maintaining Conservative 
party unity during the European election campaign were shattered 
last night when Tory rightwingers gave a warning that the 
party's natural supporters were "on strike" against the 
government's performance. 
  The right-wing Conservative Way Forward group, which has 
Lady 
Thatcher as its president, said economic recovery was not 
improving the government's fortunes. Its statement came two 
days before Major launches the Tory European election manifesto. 
"Political benefit from economic improvement will continue to 
elude us as long as ministers remain out of touch with public 
opinion," the group said. It demanded "leadership of a very high 
order" during the European campaign, which ends on June 9, 
noting the Tories had suffered a "disaster" in this month's 
council elections. 
  "Our natural supporters focused their gaze on national 
government and failed to find inspiration. Effectively, Tory 
supporters are on strike," the group said in its magazine. 
  Major will try to rally his party tomorrow by accusing 
Labour 
and the Liberal Democrats of supporting federalist policies. 
"We will fight for the kind of Europe we want -- not a European 
superstate but a Europe of nation states," Major writes in a 
foreword to the manifesto, leaked to THE SUNDAY TIMES. "We 
believe it is for nations to build Europe, not for Europe to 
attempt to supercede nations." 
  While emphasising that Britain's national interest lies in 
Europe, Major says: "We want less interference from Brussels, 
not more." Labour and the Lib Dems [Liberal Democrat Party] 
"would submerge Britain in a socialist superstate". 
  The 56-page manifesto, entitled A Strong Britain in a Strong 
Europe, promises the government will preserve Britain's "vital 
national interests" by using its veto to block unnecessary EC 
integration. Hinting at a two- speed Europe, it calls for 
"flexibility" as new members join the EC. 
  The manifesto says the decision on whether to join a single 
European currency will be for the British parliament. There 
will be no re-entry into the European exchange-rate mechanism 
(ERM) "in the foreseeable future." 
  Sir Norman Fowler, the Tory chairman, refused to predict 
that 
the Tories would gain seats, which he did before the recent 
council elections. "We have a winning message. What we have to 
do is get that message over and get our voters out," he said. 
  The Labour manifesto launched tomorrow, anticipates the Tory 
attack over increasing EC powers. A draft giving greater powers 
for the European parliament was amended to emphasise that the 
party would retain Britain's veto over economic issues, foreign 
policy, EC integration and "other key areas of national 
interest." Labour has watered down its commitment to a 35-hour 
working week. The draft manifesto said changes "might involve a 
substantial cut in working time." The final version says they 
"might involve reductions in working time". 
  The Labour programme, A New European Future, says: "Britain 
has the chance to change direction on Europe, moving us from the 
margins -- where the government resists co-operation, alienates 
allies and opts out of progress -- into the centre where Britain 
can help to o shape and direct Europe." 
  The Lib Dems, who will pledge a referendum on further EC 
integration in their manifesto tomorrow yesterday accused the 
Tories of breaking the promises they made in the last Euro 
campaign five years ago.

<F P=106> [Jon Craig `Exclusive' report on DAILY EXPRESS Poll: "Get </F>
Tough On Euro Bullies"] 
  [Text] Voters want John Major to take a tough stand 
against power-hungry Brussels, a DAILY EXPRESS poll reveals 
today. 
  They are looking to the Premier to block Euro moves aimed at 
bullying Britain into a single currency and greater integration. 
  And in a glimmer of light for the Tories, the survey 
suggests 
they will lose 13 of their 32 Euro-seats on June 9, nothing like 
as bad as the party's worst fears. 
  There is also a personal boost for Mr Major. Fifty-seven per 
cent of Conservative supporters want him to stay as Prime 
Minister even if the Tories are hammered. Only 38 per cent say 
he should go. Labour are on course next month to win 61 seats, 
up from 46, and the Liberal Democrats three, their first ever in 
Strasbourg. 
  Voting intentions for the Euro-poll are Labour 46 per cent, 
Tory 27 per cent, Liberal Democrats 22 per cent and others five 
per cent. 
  If there was a general election Labour would collect 48 per 
cent, the Tories 26 per cent, Lib-Dems 23 per cent And others 
four per cent. 
  The poll, carried out by ICM [International Communications 
and Marketing Research] coincides with the launch of election 
manifestos by the three main political parties in London today. 
  Last night Mr Major underlined how polarised they will be in 
the campaign, with the Tories increasingly Euro-sceptic and 
Labour and the Liberal Democrats pro-federal. 
  In a letter to voters in key constituencies, he declared: 
"Some people say, `Does it matter who runs the European 
parliament?' Yes, it does and now more than ever before." 
  He pointed out MEPs [members of the European Parliament] 
would have a say in choosing a successor to Commission president 
Jacques Delors and had new powers to make laws. "By voting 
Conservative you will be voting for a strong Britain in a strong 
Europe," said the Prime Minister. "And what will you be saying 
if you vote Labour or Liberal? 
  "You will be saying you are in favour of a United States of 
Europe. You will want more powers to pass to Brussels." 
  Launching the Lib-Dem manifesto, Paddy Ashdown said: "We 
want a Europe which provides practical opportunities or people, 
not grand theories for politicians. 
  "We won't want Europe for Europe's sake. We want Europe for 
Britain's sake." 
  His party's document says: "We want a European Union [EU] 
which is democratic, decentralised and diverse, a federal Europe 
that works for Britain." 
  Worryingly for the Tories, four out of five voters say 
domestic politics rather than Euro issues will influence how 
they vote. 
  Among Conservative voters who want a new leader 46 per cent 
favour Michael Heseltine, 24 per cent Kenneth Clarke, 17 per 
cent Michael Portillo, seven per cent Virginia Bottomley and six 
per cent Michael Howard. 
  The poll suggests that a new Prime Minister could cut 
Labour's 22-point lead over the Tories in a general election to 
14 points. 
  Under a new Tory leader, Labour would poll 46 per cent, the 
Tories 32 per cent, Lib-Dems 19 per cent. 
  The ICM survey was taken among more than 1,019 voters in 52 
constituencies last week, after the death of Labour leader John 
Smith. 
  Though it predicts the Conservatives holding only 19 Euro 
seats, it suggests they could reduce their losses if they can 
get their supporters out during the campain. 
  Two-thirds of those determined to vote but still undecided, 
voted Tory in the 1992 general election and two-thirds of those 
live in Conservative-held seats. 
  But if all the don't knows stay at home or vote Labour or 
Lib- Dem, the Tories could be annihilated, holding only 11 
seats. Asked what would be the most important influence on how 
they would vote, 79 per cent said the political situation in 
Britain and only 14 per cent Europe. 
  When ICM asked voters which party best represents Britain in 
the EU, 37 per cent said Labour, 27 per cent Conservative and 15 
per cent the Liberal Democrats. 
  Fifty-nine per cent of all voters want Mr Major replaced if 
there is a Tory election disaster next month. 
  But although 52 per cent said he should regard the polls as 
a 
verdict on him as Premier, the figure was only 42 per cent among 
Tory supporters. 
  Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd yesterday played down Tory 
divisions on Europe and promised a positive manifesto message. 
  The twofold theme of the Conservative campaign will be Put 
Jobs First, highlighting opposition to the social chapter and 
Keep The Veto, a pledge to fight Britain's corner in Europe.

<F P=106> [David Sharrock report: "Loyalists Hint at Ceasefire"] </F>
  [Text] Belfast -- Loyalist sources indicated last night 
that they are seriously considering a call from the Ulster 
Unionist leader, James Molyneaux, for an immediate halt to their 
campaign of violence. 
  The hint came as pressure intensified on Sinn Fein to issue 
a 
definitive response to the Downing Street Declaration. 
  The leading republican Martin McGuinness yesterday welcomed 
the Government's response to Sinn Fein's 20 questions. He 
called it "a small step in the slowly evolving peace process," 
and said Sinn Fein's reply would come within "a few short 
weeks." But while Mr McGuinness said he did not know whether an 
IRA ceasefire would result, the Irish prime minister, Albert 
Reynolds, called for an immediate cessation of violence by 
republicans and loyalists. 
  In a significant statement aimed primarily at loyalist 
paramilitaries, Mr Molyneaux said the declaration made no 
distinction between various terrorist groups, which would become 
eligible -- three months after a permanent renunciation of 
violence -- to enter exploratory talks on participation in the 
democratic process. 
  Amid reports that senior Unionists have been involved in 
secret talks with loyalist paramilitaries, Mr Molyneaux denied 
knowledge of "high-level" contacts, but admitted that party 
representatives had met "people close to the paramilitaries." 
  The Belfast Telegraph reported that Unionist politicians 
hoped the Combined Loyalist Military Command, an umbrella body 
of the illegal Ulster Freedom Fighters and the Ulster Volunteer 
Force, would consider entering talks. 
  Mr Molyneaux said it would be a small step for the loyalist 
paramilitaries to enter the democratic process. "There is no 
bar now to any paramilitary body terminating violence after a 
period of three months entering into exploratory discussions." 
  Sources close to the loyalist leaderships said that Mr 
Molyneaux's request would be given serious consideration and 
hinted at a "gesture." 
  But they also said they were studying the Government's 
response to Sinn Fein's questions and expressed reservations 
about Dublin's involvement.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Clear Need for Change"] </F>
  [Text] The clarification of the Anglo-lrish declaration 
offered to Sinn Fein by the Northern Ireland Office yesterday 
was pointless rather than outrageous. Though little in the 
document could be counted a concession, Sinn Fein will doubtless 
consider the exchange a propaganda success. In anticipation of 
this, British officials have sought to justify the response as 
"commentary" rather than "clarification -- a semantic 
distinction which may be less than obvious to the anxious 
Unionist community. The more important point is that Ulster 
seems not an inch closer to peace as a result of this sterile 
correspondence. 
  The stern language of the statement -- which warned Sinn 
Fein 
to stop "playing for time" and to realise that "there is no 
conceivable justification for continuing to rob people of their 
lives" -- masks its tactical significance. On balance, the 
contacts between John Major and Gerry Adams, president of the 
IRA's political wing, were probably ill-advised. 
  Sinn Fein's strategy since the Prime Minister and Albert 
Reynolds, the Irish Prime Minister, signed the declaration in 
December has been to cultivate a specious legitimacy without 
fulfilling the preconditions for exploratory talks. Mr Adams 
has encouraged the view that his movement is ready to lay down 
its weapons and join the political process. Trips abroad, the 
stagemanaged Sinn Fein conference in February and the three-day 
Easter truce have all played a part in this relentless public 
relations campaign. 
  Meanwhile, the IRA has shelled Heathrow airport, a British 
helicopter has been shot from the skies in Armagh, and troops, 
policemen and civilians have continued to be targeted 
ruthlessly. The Government may claim that yesterday s response 
has laid the troublesome ghost of "clarification" to rest once 
and for all. Sinn Feins interpretation will surely be just the 
opposite: that the preconditions required by the declaration are 
not absolute and that negotiation by stealth remains an option. 
  Regrettably, Mr Major's faith in the five-month-old peace 
process has not been vindicated. While ministers agonised over 
Sinn Feins demand this week, blood was flowing in the province 
as if the declaration had never been signed. A teenager died in 
Armagh yesterday from injuries suffered in a Loyalist sectarian 
attack on Wednesday; earlier this week, two Catholic building 
workers were shot dead by the Ulster Volunteer Force. The 
determination of the men of violence to continue their work 
could not be clearer. Against this background, the tired 
reiteration of the declarations principles seems increasingly 
irrelevant. 
  The fact of yesterday's response is more illuminating than 
its detail. It confirms that the Prime Minister has yet to 
accept the need for a new strategy in Ulster. On security 
matters, he should begin by considering the intelligent 
amendments to the Criminal Justice Bill proposed by David 
Trimble, the Unionist MP for Upper Bann. In the constitutional 
field, he should press ahead with the stalled plans for an 
administrative assembly in the province. Wooing Sinn Fein has 
done nothing but raise the party's profile and alarm the 
Protestant community in Ulster. If his wish to be remembered as 
a peacebroker in Ireland is sincere, Mr Major will have to think 
again.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Retribution"] </F>
  [Text] When Mr Andreas Papandreou regained power last 
October, there was some optimism that the new Greek government 
would take urgent action to correct the country's severe 
economic imbalances. This hope has evaporated into the Athenian 
ether. 
  The upheavals surrounding the drachma following the ending 
of 
capital controls last week are a symptom of a more widespread 
Greek crisis. Since his unsuccessful premiership between 1981 
and 1989, Mr Papandreou and his Panhellenic Socialist Movement 
have toned down left-wing radicalism. Yet they appear as 
ill-equipped as ever to manage the economy of the poorest and, 
on many measures, most wayward member of the European Union [EU]. 
  Mr Yiannis Papandoniou, the new economy minister, has given 
no sign that he will prove better able to master Greece's 
challenges than his predecessor, the late Mr Yeozyios 
Yellimatas. By freeing capital controls without announcing 
measures to curb the fast- growing budget deficit, Mr 
Papandoniou exposed Greece to the risk of instant retribution 
from the financial markets. 
  The measure, anticipating by six weeks the liberalisation 
deadline of July 1, looks like a gamble that has failed. The 
Greek authorities have managed to prop up the drachma with a 
draconian tightening of short-term interest rates to levels of 
more than 100 per cent. This has further damaged the outlook 
for the Greek economy in the coming year. 
  A monetary squeeze of the sort the Bank of Greece has been 
imposing can at best buy time for stern budgetary action. In 
the absence of such moves, and in the wake of last week's 
estimated $1bn fall in foreign exchange reserves, a decision to 
let the drachma float down abruptly against the D-Mark could be 
only a matter of time. 
  A combination of recession, lack of spending controls and 
large- scale tax evasion may push central government borrowing 
to 17 per cent of gross domestic product this year, compared 
with a target of 12.9 per cent. In view of the inertia of Mr 
Papandreou's administration, it seems unlikely to summon the 
necessary political will either to increase the efficiency of 
tax collection or to expand the privatisation programme. 
  The government appears to be banking on extra revenue from 
EU 
structural funds later this year to ease the problems caused by 
revenue shortfalls. However, a country already heavily 
dependent on EU transfers, and which has antagonised its 
partners by its intransigence over neighbouring Macedonia, can 
expect tough treatment from the rest of the EU. 
  Greece's prospective transfer to Germany of the EU's 
six-monthly presidency should be the signal for a more 
uncompromising EU line over the chronic divergence of the Greek 
economy. Disbursement of EU grants for planned infrastructure 
projects should be made dependent on the Greek government's 
ability to fulfill rigorous economic targets. 
  Additionally, there can be no question of Brussels 
discussing 
any new EU loans to Greece until the Papandreou government has 
put its house in order. If Greece needs additional external 
credits which cannot be raised on capital markets, it should 
turn not to the EU but to the International Monetary Fund.

  [Excerpt] Berlin (DPA) -- Leading Social Democratic Party 
of Germany [SPD] politicians have reacted with harsh criticism 
to the acceptance speech of future President Roman Herzog at the 
Federal Convention in Berlin. "The best thing one can do is not 
to comment on the speech," SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping said on 
Monday evening [23 May]. Deputy SPD Chairman Wolfgang Thierse 
stated that Herzog immediately lived up to his reputation as an 
arch-conservative and terrified half of those present. Peter 
Struck, parliamentary manager of the SPD group, called the 
speech "disastrous." 
  SPD Deputy Chairman Oskar Lafontaine said that Herzog 
probably did not prepare his speech well. Therefore, one should 
not weigh his every word. Reinhard Hoeppner, SPD land chairman 
of Saxony-Anhalt, was "relatively shocked" by the speech. 
  Joschka Fischer, Hesse environment minister and Greens top 
politician, shook his head and said: "Read the speech; this 
says more than any comment." Former FRG Interior Minister 
Gerhart Baum stated: "My skepticism regarding the newly elected 
president has not declined after this speech." 
  On the other hand, Christian Democratic Union/Christian 
Social Union [CDU/CSU] Group Chairman Wolfgang Schaeuble said 
that Herzog's election is a "good day for Germany." The elected 
head of state is a man who has always felt committed to German 
unification. CSU Land Group Chairman Michael Glos expressed the 
conviction that Herzog will be a good president. [passage

  [Text] Berlin (DPA) -- The Social Democratic Party [SPD] 
has reacted to the election of the new federal president, Roman 
Herzog, by sharply criticizing Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl 
and the Free Democratic Party [FDP]. SPD Chairman Rudolf 
Scharping told journalists in Berlin on 24 May that the Bonn 
coalition had only had an interest in "demonstrating power" in 
this connection. 
  The selection of the Christian Democratic Union/Christian 
Social Union [CDU/CSU] candidate was not marked by the will to 
find the best president for the Germans, "but by Helmut Kohl's 
power policy calculation." He said the SPD was in agreement 
with most Germans that Johannes Rau would have been the better 
choice. 
  The SPD chairman said the SPD would cooperate loyally with 
the new head of state. However, the Social Democrats expected 
Herzog to conduct his office "in an absolutely impartial way" 
and to orient himself at the line pursued by his predecessor, 
Richard von Weizsaecker. His first official speech on Monday 
evening [23 May] had, however, failed to create this impression, 
said Scharping. 
  The SPD chief also sharply criticized the FDP. By their 
attitude in the Federal Convention, they had abandoned their 
role as an independent political force. What they presented as 
loyalty to the coalition, was complete subjugation, said 
Scharping. It was typical for FDP Chairman Klaus Kinkel to 
virtually have to ask for a vote of confidence, in order to push 
through his line. 
  Despite his defeat, Johannes Rau had met with broad support 
in the Federal Convention and above all from the people. The 
SPD would make use of this impetus for the upcoming elections 
and would make the European elections in three weeks a "fourth 
ballot," said Scharping.

  [Excerpt] Dortmund -- Rudolf Scharping, chairman of the 
Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], has called for more 
European Union funds for Germany. During his party's European 
festival in Dortmund, the candidate for the chancellor's office 
stated today that, in view of the economic situation, Germany is 
paying too much for the European Union. "We have fallen back to 
seventh place in the European prosperity scale. For this 
reason, the return of European funds to Germany must increase," 
Scharping stressed on the sidelines of the SPD rally on the 
occasion of the European elections, which was attended by 
approximately 300,000 people, according to the police. 
  During his speech, Scharping advocated a stronger role of 
the 
European Parliament and rejected a "European central state with 
excessive bureaucracy." The identity of the regions must be 
preserved. With a view to European financial policies, the SPD 
chairman pointed out that he prefers a stable German mark to an 
unstable European currency that is introduced too early.

  [Text] Nuremberg -- On the occasion of the 45th meeting of 
the Sudeten Germans, German and Austrian politicians have called 
on the Czech government to recognize the expulsion of the 
Germans after World War II as an injustice. When awarded the 
European Charlemagne Prize in Nuremberg today, Austrian Foreign 
Minister Alois Mock (Austrian People's Party) described the 
expulsion as one of the "great unjust deeds" of this century. 
  Addressing about 200 participants, Mock rejected all efforts 
to "justify the resettlement of the Sudeten Germans with 
previous Nazi crimes." Also, its cannot be explained with the 
argument of the "collective guilt" of the Germans, Mock 
stressed. He stated that it is "quite understandable" that the 
Sudeten Germans want to open a "new chapter" in the relationship 
with their old home. The minister added: "I do not believe 
that one should discard the sincere attempt to restore dialogue 
as a 'provocation'." Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus used 
this term when reacting to the invitation of the Sudeten Germans 
to attend their meeting. 
  Theo Waigel, leader of the Christian Social Union and 
finance 
minister, stated: "The future between Germany and the Czech 
Republic can only be shaped by the awareness of historical 
truths." Prior to an entry into the European Union, the Czech 
Republic must be willing to "accept the European house rules." 
Reconciliation is not possible without the integration of the 
Sudeten Germans. 
  The opening of the Whitsun meeting of the Sudeten Germans, 
which will continue on Sunday, was disrupted by three German 
women who described themselves as trade union activists. They 
carried banners with the slogans "No to the Munich agreement" 
and "Cheb must remain Czech." After some tussling, the women 
were pushed out of the hall by ushers and are now facing charges 
of illegally entering the hall. They pointed out that their 
action was intended as a protest against the demands of the 
Sudeten Germans.

  [Excerpts] Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov 
has arrived on an official visit. He was received at Ankara 
Esenboga Airport by Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin. 
  In a statement at the airport, Cetin pointed out that Turkey 
and Bulgaria are not only neighbors, but two friendly countries 
with close relations. 
  [Begin Cetin recording] The cooperation and relations 
between us will contribute significantly not only to our two 
countries, but to the solution of the problems in the Balkans. 
They will also contribute to the peace and stability in Europe. 
Actually, the relations between Turkey and Bulgaria offer an 
example for the region. [end recording] 
  Daskalov said that, during his visit, they will discuss ways 
of further developing existing relations. 
  Daskalov then visited Cetin and conferred with him for some 
time. Later, official talks were held between the delegations of 
the two countries headed by the respective foreign ministers. 
  Cetin said before the meeting that they were trying to 
conclude certain agreements before them. These agreements will 
further strengthen the legal basis of the relations between the 
two countries, he said, adding that cooperation is intensively 
developing especially in the field of defense. [passage omitted] 
  Daskalov also met with Murat Karayalcin, state minister and 
deputy prime minister. 
  [Begin Karayalcin recording] As you know, tomorrow I will 
pay a one-day visit to The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
[FYROM], to Skopje. We discussed that a little. The approach 
of both countries to FYROM is very positive and warm. 
Consequently, I thought it was appropriate that this visit was 
paid one day before my visit to Skopje. [end recording]

  [Text] Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov has 
ended his contacts in Turkey and left the country. A new 
cooperation protocol was signed that updates the action protocol 
signed between the two countries in 1992. 
  Daskalov was received this morning by Mustafa Kalemli, 
deputy 
speaker of the Turkish Grand National Assembly. President 
Suleyman Demirel received Daskalov at the Cankaya Mansion. 
Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin was also present at the meeting. 
  Cetin and Daskalov signed a new cooperation protocol that 
updates the action protocol signed by the two countries in 1992. 
  Speaking at the signing ceremony, Cetin said the protocol 
envisions the development of cooperation in the military field, 
and in the fight against drug trafficking, organized crime, and 
terrorism. He pointed out that the Turkish minority in Bulgaria 
constitutes a bridge for the friendship between the two 
countries. Bulgaria has been acting in an exemplary fashion 
regarding this issue in recent years, Cetin said, adding: 
Turkey and Bulgaria are two important countries in the Balkans. 
The Balkans today are the hottest and most problematic region 
in the world. What is happening in Bosnia-Herzegovina today is 
a shame for humanity. We have a common understanding to make 
every effort to prevent the spreading of the tension and of the 
conflict. We also discussed the issues of the Caucasus, the 
Middle East, and Iraq. We assessed in detail the effect of the 
embargo on Iraq on the economies of Turkey and Bulgaria. 
  The Bulgarian foreign minister pointed out that his visit 
showed that the two countries have the political will to develop 
their bilateral relations. Replying to a question, Daskalov 
said his country has incurred a loss of about $1.5 billion as a 
result of the embargo on Iraq. He stressed that Bulgaria wants 
the embargoes on Iraq and on Bosnia-Herzegovina to be lifted. 
  Daskalov stressed that Bulgaria is not opposed to the 
deployment of Turkish troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina within the 
framework of the relevant UN resolution.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Mesut Yilmaz, leader of the </F>
Motherland Party, by NOKTA KIBRIS correspondent Nedret Ersanel 
in Ankara; date not given] 
  [Text] [Ersanel] Can you make a general assessment of the 
"Cyprus problem," which has continued for many years and has 
become more and more intricate as new developments arise? In 
particular, can you comment on TRNC [Turkish Republic of 
Northern Cyprus] President Rauf Denktas' statement to the 
Turkish parliament that "the TRNC will move to integrate with 
Turkey if the Greek Cypriots are allowed to join the European 
Union [EU]"? 
  [Yilmaz] I attended the EC ministerial meeting as Turkey's 
foreign minister in Luxembourg in 1988. I disagreed with then 
Foreign Minister Genscher when he described the Cyprus problem 
during the opening session of that meeting as a determining 
factor in EC-Turkish relations. The meeting broke up because of 
that. Unfortunately, the same view was adopted during the 
summit in Dublin as official EC policy. Consequently, we have 
to considere EC policy on Cyprus in our relations with that 
organization. Actually, that was a step the EC considered but 
failed to take for many years. That approach was adopted as the 
EC's official policy in 1990. The second step the EC plans to 
take at the present time is to allow Cyprus to join that 
organization. Purporting to be the legal government of all of 
Cyprus, the Greek Cypriot Republic of Southern Cyprus [title as 
published] has signed a partnership agreement with the EC. The 
question of Cyprus becoming an EC member is now on the agenda. 
Contacts are being held on when the talks should begin. As far 
as Turkey and the TRNC are concerned, the matter is extremely 
important. Turkey was one of the first countries to sign a 
partnership agreement with the EC. It officially applied to 
join that organization as a full member in 1987. However, its 
application has been suspended during the past seven years. 
Considering all that, Southern Cyprus joining the EC as an 
entity that represents the entire island will be an EC move 
against Turkey. Furthermore, it will make a solution of the 
Cyprus problem more difficult. 
  [Ersanel] Will the EU fail to realize that? It seems that 
President Denktas has a clearer approach to the matter. 
  [Yilmaz] The EC will definitely feel the need to make an 
assessment to avoid having the Cyprus problem placed within its 
framework. Turkey's stance is an important factor. I am 
convinced that Turkey must clearly explain Rauf Denktas' 
argument. This will contribute to the EC's assessment. The EC 
must be informed immediately that Southern Cyprus joining it 
will mean the "de facto" solution to the Cyprus problem because 
north Cyprus will move to fully integrate with Turkey. 
Consequently, the effort made within the UN framework to 
resolve the Cyprus problem will have failed. 
  Meanwhile, it must be recalled that the 1960 agreements, 
which provided for the establishment of a partnership government 
in Cyprus, contain a provision that Cyprus can become a member 
of international organizations only with the consent of Turkey 
and Greece, the guarantor powers of the partnership. A legal 
debate can be held on the validity of a partnership between 
Southern Cyprus and the EC, which Turkey will not approve. 
  [Ersanel] It seems that you regard this stance as a 
"diplomatic trump card." 
  [Yilmaz] Yes, I do. That is what I am saying. 
  [Ersanel] Can an argument be made on its validity? 
  [Yilmaz] Two factors must be established if effective steps 
are to be taken to find a solution to the Cyprus problem. 
First, the two communities in Cyprus must be regarded as two 
separate entities. That is not the case at the present time. 
The existence of the Turkish Cypriot community as a separate 
entity is a reality that is ignored by the world. The second is 
the removal of the differences, economic differences in 
particular, between the two communities in due course of time. 
The outcome of integration with the EC will an very negative 
effectson these issues. The economic imbalance between the two 
sides will worsen. 
  [Ersanel] Can you comment on the U.S. approach to the 
Cyprus problem? 
  [Yilmaz] The United States has always regarded the Cyprus 
problem as a priority issue that has a bearing on its domestic 
politics. In view of the Greek lobby's influence, the U.S. 
Administration has always focused attention on the Cyprus 
problem and regarded it as a priority issue that has a bearing 
on domestic politics. Meanwhile, the views the U.S. 
presidential candidates expressed on the Cyprus problem during 
past election campaigns were modified in accordance with U.S. 
foreign policy after they were elected. 
  However, the matter is completely different from Turkey's 
viewpoint. The Cyprus problem does not concern domestic 
politics in Turkey, it is a national issue. I have always 
argued that the Cyprus problem does not concern Cyprus alone. 
It is a matter that tests Turkey's will to defend its 
legitimate rights and interests. Turkey has maintained the 
right approach on the Cyprus problem and its intervention on the 
island was legally justified. Otherwise, the problem would not 
have continued for 30 years. If Turkey agrees to a solution, 
which would conflict with its interests and with those of its 
kinsmen in Cyprus, the implications of that approach will not be 
limited to the island. In fact, it would set an example for 
similar problems in other parts of the world. 
  [Ersanel] Can you give an example? 
  [Yilmaz] A very important example is the problem in the 
Aegean Sea. 
  [Ersanel] Can you comment on Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's 
Cyprus policy? She has said that the "Cyprus problem will be 
solved." 
  [Yilmaz] I do not believe that Mrs. Ciller is aware of the 
historical perspectives of the problem. She has already said 
that the Cyprus problem is an obstacle for Turkey and has 
described the existing state of affairs on the island as a 
no-win situation. She has said that this harms Turkey. 
Furthermore, she has claimed that the effort made to resolve 
the problem has been deliberately obstructed in the past and has 
noted that she is determined to solve the Cyprus problem. 
  What Mrs. Ciller has said in a diplomatic way is that Turkey 
has significantly suffered because of the Cyprus problem. 
Therefore, it is ready to make concessions to have it solved. 
Naturally, that approach will stimulate more pressure on 
Turkey. In view of that, I believe that her approach is very 
wrong. It conflicts with the policies of the governments that 
have come to power in Turkey during the past 30 years. The only 
hopeful factor is that her approach is not shared. It is not 
shared even in her own party and government. Therefore, I hope 
that she will refrain from making new assessments and 
initiatives on the matter. 
  [Ersanel] Can you explain the solution you have in mind for 
the Cyprus problem? 
  [Yilmaz] Considering the Greek Cypriot intentions and 
approach, I believe that Turkey must clearly say that it is 
convinced that the continuation of the negotiating process is 
useless. I believe that we must send a clearer message on the 
matter to the United States, the United Nations, and the other 
countries that are related to the problem. The Turkish Cypriots 
responded positively to the two packages former UN Secretary 
General Javier Perez de Cuellar proposed in the past. The 
packages were rejected by the Greek Cypriot side. Regarding UN 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's confidence-building 
measures, the Greek Cypriot side has disclosed that it is 
prepared to agree to that package only if certain changes are 
made. That indicates that the Greek Cypriots intend to use the 
confidence-building measures to achieve their objectives. In 
view of that, I believe that the Turkish Cypriot side must 
inform the world that it is convinced that maintaining the 
present process is useless. Meanwhile, it must use the 
political developments in the world to strengthen its case. The 
adoption of a determined approach by Turkey may create an 
opportunity for new efforts to find a realistic solution to the 
problem. Of course, the pressure on Turkey may be intensified. 
That, too, must be considered. 
  Nevertheless, the future of Cyprus may be hopeless if the 
effort that is made to solve the problem through the concessions 
the Greek Cypriots demand is maintained. Cyprus may turn into a 
country like Bosnia. 
  In short, Turkey must clearly inform the world about what 
can 
and cannot be achieved in Cyprus in light of the Greek Cypriot 
approach and international opinion on the problem. I am 
convinced that initiatives that are only aimed at gaining time 
are useless.

  [Text] It has been announced that Turkey welcomes the 
German decision to extradite certain terrorists who violate the 
law and engage in terrorist activities and that it is ready to 
receive those who will be extradited. 
  A Foreign Ministry statement on the issue notes that Turkey 
has, on various occasions in the past, noted that the death 
sentence has not been implemented in the country for the last 10 
years and that every legal and operative measure has been taken 
to prevent torture. Stressing that Turkish-German talks are 
continuing on the preparation of a memorandum of understanding 
concerning those to be extradited, the statement expresses the 
hope that a solution will be reached on the issue soon. The 
statement continues: We are sorry [words indistinct] efforts by 
certain German laender to prevent the extradition of these 
persons. No one should doubt that Turkey, just like Germany, is 
a constitutional state and everyone should refrain from behavior 
that might encourage acts of terrorism. The existing friendship 
and mutual trust between Turkey and Germany is the strongest 
guarantee to the solution of such problems.

  [Text] Ankara, May 18 (A.A.) -- Social Democratic Populist 
Party's [SDPP] deputy group chairman Nihat Matkap criticized the 
return of Ankara Security Director Orhan Tasanlar to his 
position today. 
  `No one should expect us to accept this situation,' Matkap 
said. 
  Tasanlar was removed from his position after the roughing up 
of demonstrators and SDPP Deputy Salman Kaya by the police 
during the May Day celebrations in Ankara. He was reinstated 
today as the investigation on him proved him to be not guilty. 
  In a written statement Matkap said that the government 
agreement of the SHP and senior coalition partner True Path 
Party [TPP] had promised to remove all obstacles on 
democratization of the Turkish society. 
  He recalled that civil servants and workers who sought their 
rights have been beaten up by the police over the last six 
months, while the shariah (Islamic law) supporters who stoned 
the U.S. Embassy and TPP headquarters were allowed to carry out 
their rallies in the streets without police retribution. 
  `Most recently, press members and participants of the May 
Day 
celebrations were beaten up,' he said, adding that one deputy of 
their party was also beaten up the same day. 
  `As a consequence of these unfavorable developments, the 
security director was removed from his post, was returned and it 
should be recalled that a number of deputies from our coalition 
partner had been opposed to his removal at that time,' he said. 
  Meanwhile, a statement by the Ministry of the Interior said 
today that Police Chief Mehmet Okur, officers Mithad Budak and 
Suleyman Yalman will be tried on charges of police brutality for 
the beating of Kaya. 
  If convicted, they will receive prison terms ranging between 
three months and three years and suspension of their civil 
servant status.

CSO 

    [Editorial Report] The relations between President Francois 
Mitterrand, former Prime Minister Michel Rocard, and Movement of 
Leftist Radicals leader Bernard Tapie have been discussed in the 
French press. 
<H5>  PS Attacks on Rocard Noted </H5>
  The new element in the 20-year quarrel between Mitterrand 
and 
Rocard is Tapie, who has consistently benefited from 
presidential favors, Patrick Jarreau writes in the 29 April 
Paris daily LE MONDE. At the beginning of the month, Tapie was 
received at the presidential office, where polls on voting 
intentions are carefully analyzed. Socialist Party (PS) 
officials such as Jack Lang and Segolene Royal publicly stated 
that if Rocard's European Parliament list gets less than 23 
percent of the vote, the former prime minister ought not to 
represent the Left in the presidential elections. According to 
a commentary by Agathe Logeart in the same issue of LE MONDE, 
this demand is likely to trouble Rocard, who had so far been 
content that the party which he took over about a year ago 
appeared "pacified," with the cantonal elections producing 
"rather encouraging" results for the party and with the PS 
Euroelections list "headache" over. However, Rocard "does not 
take into account the cactuses that spring up almost 
spontaneously on the path of the PS secretary general," Logeart 
commented. At Mitterrand's instigation, Rocard was prevented 
from attending the ceremony commemorating the death of former 
Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy after his widow publicly alleged 
that the party and its leaders abandoned her after turning their 
back on her late husband. Tapie, however, was at Mitterrand's 
side. In addition, PS luminary Catherine Lalumiere joined 
Tapie's list, probably after discussing it with Mitterrand, 
Logeart contends. Finally, on 27 April, a group of PS 
supporters of former secretary general Laurent Fabius issued a 
statement against the enlargement of the European Union (EU), 
which Rocard favors. While these incidents point to a "real 
attempt to destabilize Rocard and his team," the secretary 
general and his friends have thus far ignored the attacks, 
Logeart writes. 
<H5>  More on Anti-Rocard Moves </H5>
  The anti-Rocard "destabilization" attempt "behind which one 
can see Mitterrand's hand" was also discussed in Jacques Patoz's 
article in the 29 April Paris daily LE OUOTIDIEN. Contending 
that the most dangerous attacks against Rocard come from fellow 
socialists, Patoz writes that it would be "naive" on Rocard's 
part to be surprised, since he knows that many in the party hold 
no affection for him. The Euroelections, Patoz continues, are 
only a pretext, the essential issue being that many Socialists 
cannot "resign" themselves to a Rocard presidency. They are 
therefore counting on a leftist defeat in the 12 June elections, 
with blame going to chief campaigner Rocard, who would lose his 
position as the PS' "natural candidate" for the presidency. 
This "underhanded" fight against Rocard is led by those who 
insist that the PS can gather more than 22 percent of the vote 
in the Euroelections, despite Socialist luminary Lionel Jospin's 
statement that anyone who thinks the PS can get more than 20 
percent "either knows nothing or is dishonest." President 
Mitterrand himself is engaged in "barring the way" for his 
former prime minister by supporting Tapie, "a good way to 
succeed given that the Tapie list will obtain most of its 
support from the Socialist electorate," Patoz contends. Faced 
with Mitterrand's "resentment," he continues, Rocard is 
"defenseless," for he cannot accuse Mitterrand of attacking him. 
Mitterrand remains the "master of the game," Patoz concludes. 
In addition, "it is no secret" that EU Commission President 
Jacques Delors' supporters "ardently wish" for a PS defeat in 
June, which would allow them to provoke "more or less 
spontaneous" calls from the party's grassroots for a Delors 
presidential candidacy. 
<H5>  Mitterrand Support For Tapie Viewed </H5>
  In an article in the 28 April-4 May Paris weekly LE NOUVEL 
OBSERVATEUR, Francois Bazin discusses Tapie's rise in politics, 
which he terms the "Tapie mystery." Repeatedly questioned on 
his activities and expelled from the French soccer association, 
Tapie remains popular, Bazin maintains. A billionaire who uses 
"brutal" methods, he is encouraged by Mitterrand. Although a 
candidate of France's oldest party, he "cultivates the image of 
a political sniper." Bazin cites an unconcerned" Mitterrand 
replying to a former Socialist minister worried about eventual 
presidential support for Tapie that "there are multiple Lefts" 
and that "partisan rivalries are not his concern." Bazin 
interprets the president's reply to mean that, while Mitterrand 
has thus far not granted his "seal of approval" to any 
candidate, Tapie benefits from an "authorization to proceed." 
The president, he wrote, is experienced in the type of "furtive 
campaign where nothing is said but everything is suggested." 
Beyond some technical advice, the presidential contribution to 
Tapie's "new adventures" is to remind the party that Tapie "is 
not an intruder." By "opening the doors of the family," 
Mitterrand is saying that Tapie must not be "demonized" or 
become the victim of "ostracism," Bazin contends. Tapie is now 
implicated in an electoral adventure that serves Mitterrand's 
designs and opposes those of Rocard. However, Bazin argues, 
only the Euroelections will determine Tapie's real place in the 
Left--whether he will be a "shooting star," a "minor actor," or 
a "cumbersome ally." 
<H5>  Tapie Personality Analyzed </H5>
  Laurent Joffrin comments on Tapie's personality in the 28 
April-4 May LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR. Tapie's real vocation, he 
writes, is that of an "actor or producer." Such professionals 
know that "taking a strong personality, good or bad, and 
confronting him with successive obstacles will lead him to 
quickly conquer the public's sympathies." Tapie's is a 
"marvelous scenario," Joffrin continues, which dovetails 
perfectly with the "concerns of Mitterrandian France." "In a 
country where elites are powerless to heal the main diseases of 
society, where justice is uncertain and scandals discredit the 
political class, where trade unions, parties, and parliament 
have been weakened, a handsome sniper benefits from an automatic 
bonus. In a country subjected, like all democracies, to the 
inexorable progression of individualism, the public figure who 
talks about his misfortunes, ostentatiously enjoys his wealth 
but returns blow for blow in adversity, who goes from euphoria 
to depression, confesses his anguish and spits out his disdain, 
is more alive than all the mannequins of the leading class. Of 
him the people will say: `He, at least, has lived.'" Of course, 
all this is "fake," Joffrin continues. Tapie's struggle against 
the powerful is "all eyewash" and his past as an entrepreneur is 
a "myth," since he sold most of his companies to turn a quick 
profit. According to Joffrin, Tapie, who has created nothing, 
saved nothing, solved nothing" is only interested in his own 
good for he "knows how to convince, seduce, and dupe by 
fascinating the simple-minded."

<F P=106> ["Political Diary" column by Derya Sazak: "Why Doesn't Papa </F>
Come Back?"] 
  [Text] While observing the True Path Party [TPP] Assembly 
group meeting yesterday, in which Prime Minister Tansu Ciller 
promised the deputies that the TPP would come to power on its 
own in the 1996 elections, we again witness how the TPP members 
are suffering. 
  While half of the group was listening to Mrs. Ciller inside, 
the other half was nervously smoking outside in the lobby, as if 
they were trying to get rid of the blues in a prison yard. The 
reason for the blues is obvious: The intraparty opposition is 
proving incapable of getting rid of Ciller, and no solution is 
coming from Cankaya, the presidential mansion which has been 
turned into a wailing wall. 
  Recently, scenarios on the establishment of a new government 
became prevalent once again as the news spread that Papa 
[Demirel] had "pulled out all the stops" to get rid of Ciller. 
At yesterday's group meeting, however, Mrs. Ciller challenged 
the opposition within the party by criticizing the 49th 
government and praising the success of the 50th. She finished 
her speech amid applause. This put off the expectation of a 
coalition without Ciller until after the Bayram holiday. 
  In fact, why do those who sweat up and down the road to 
Cankaya not opt for an easier way? Would it not be better if 
Papa came down instead of them going up? Since Demirel is 
complaining that the country is not being run well, he can, in 
an Ozal-like move, leave the Cankaya mansion and assume the TPP 
leadership. In this way, the deputies who stealthily go to 
Cankaya at night to get rid of Ciller will relax, and Demirel 
will be able to resume running the country from where he left 
off. 
  We do not know if Tansu Ciller is also thinking of such 
solutions, but it was noteworthy that in a defiant tone, the 
prime minister listed the victories of the 50th government in 
every field -- from banking to terrorism, from foreign policy to 
the economy -- and blamed the previous governments, including 
the 49th, for not having done what had to be done. 
  She also tried to push Motherland Party [ANAP] leader Mesut 
Yilmaz to the wall by recalling his preelection promise that in 
a TPP-ANAP coalition, the leader of the second party would 
withdraw. It is obvious that the TPP is drawing up plans to 
cause cracks within the ANAP. There is no doubt, however, that 
divisions within the TPP are also being planned. Various wings 
within the party expect that motions for an investigation with 
regard to the banks will put the Ciller family in a difficult 
position. (When the deputies criticized Ozer Ciller for the 
first time at the group meeting yesterday, the prime minister 
was forced to defend her husband. Deputies who complained that 
Mr. Ciller was interfering suggested that the prime minister 
make him a minister.) On the other hand, it is being suggested 
that promises of ministerial posts will reduce the speed at 
which dissent is spreading within the group. 
  The same assessment can be made with regard to the Social 
Democratic Populist Party [SDPP]. The lionhearted Social 
Democrats are continuing to receive blow after blow. 
  Ankara Security Director Orhan Tasanlar, who was suspended 
after Ankara Deputy Salman Kaya was horribly beaten up by the 
police on May Day, has been allowed to return to his post. On 
the same day, the SDPP received another unexpected blow from its 
partner, the TPP: Neither of the two SDPP candidates were 
elected for membership on the Radio and Television Council. The 
Left was left out. 
  What is as interesting as the TPP's moves is the attitude of 
the SDPP and the Republican People's Party -- an attitude far 
removed from solidarity. These parties cannot even unite on 
candidates representing the same views at a vote in the 
Assembly. How can they cooperate in municipal elections that 
have been canceled and will be held again? Forget it! 
  The SDPP carries less weight within the coalition with each 
passing day, and it cannot even establish coordination among the 
party group, cabinet, and party headquarters because of certain 
people who are expecting ministerial posts. For example, Fikri 
Saglar, who was made SDPP secretary general, insists on the 
Culture Ministry (he was offered a state ministry). This 
insistence is making artists in various fields nervous. 
Ministry officials allege that Saglar's family members are 
running it. 
  The fact that Karayalcin has not been using his "initiative" 
in the cabinet since he became party leader and his repeated 
postponement of an expected reshuffle are escalating tension 
within the SDPP group. It is being said that Saglar has started 
preparing for the leadership at the next party congress. 
  Everything will become clear on 5 July, three months after 
the economic package was presented in early April; including the 
future of the SDPP.

  [Text] Vienna, May 25 (AFP) -- Inspectors from the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have completed their 
inspection of a controversial nuclear reactor in North Korea and 
took samples from spent fuel rods, IAEA officials said in Vienna 
Wednesday [25 May]. 
  The samples should allow the IAEA to determine how long the 
fuel rods were in the reactor and thereby calculate whether 
plutonium could have been diverted, possibly for use in making 
nuclear bombs.

  [Text] Brussels, May 24 (AFP) -- Russia signalled here 
Tuesday [24 May] that it would sign NATO's Partnership For Peace 
initiative only if at the same time it is also given a separate 
accord on closer Russia-NATO relations. 
  Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev said he or Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev intended to travel to NATO 
headquarters here at an undetermined date to sign both documents 
at once. 
  The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation has been pressing 
Russia to join the Partnership For Peace (PFP) programme of 
military cooperation between NATO and former communist countries. 
  But Moscow has indicated it will sign the partnership 
programme only if NATO agrees to a parallel accord of political 
cooperation between Russia and the Western Alliance. 
  Grachev said he would be presenting Russia's proposals for 
the partnership, plus "concept" proposals for a bilateral 
relationship, to NATO here Wednesday. 
  "In principle we are ready to sign (the partnership) even if 
it is not a Russian initiative," he said, but suggested strongly 
that Moscow would not accept the PFP without the separate 
bilateral accord. 
  Grachev was speaking ahead of a meeting with the NATO 
defence 
ministers to present Russia's long-awaited new military doctrine 
to replace the security blueprint of the defunct Soviet Union. 
  NATO has said it is particularly anxious to find out how 
Russia intends to treat its "near abroad" -- other republics of 
the former Soviet Union with Russian minorities.

  [Text] Brussels, May 24 (AFP) -- Russia intends to sign 
NATO's partnership for peace (PFP) programme of military 
cooperation with countries of the former Soviet bloc, Russian 
Defence Minister Pavel Grachev said here Tuesday [24 May]. 
  Speaking after a meeting with NATO defence ministers, he 
said 
Russia would sign the programme "without setting forth any 
conditions." 
  This contradicted a remark Grachev made on his arrival here 
earlier in the day -- that Russia wanted the partnership accord 
accompanied by a separate agreement with NATO on bilateral 
political relations. 
  He told journalists after the meeting that the partnership's 
framework agreement "does not fully set forth the principles and 
themes of cooperation (as sought by Russia.)" 
  The framework accord lays out the basis of military 
cooperation but it does not detail the specific levels of 
activity which each country of the partnership will contribute 
to the programme. 
  The Russian general said he would set forth the details of 
Russia's proposed participation here Wednesday during a meeting 
between NATO and its Eastern Bloc partners in the North Atlantic 
Cooperation Council. 
  Reacting to persistent reports that Russia might not sign 
the 
partnership accord unless it gets a parallel political accord 
with NATO, Grachev said: "President (Boris) Yeltsin has made it 
clear that Russia will join the PFP." 
  He gave no date for the signing. But the general added that 
the Russian military was "ready and willing" to cooperate in the 
partnership with the military structures of NATO and the former 
Eastern Bloc members of PFP.

  [Text] Brussels, May 24 (AFP) -- Russia's new military 
posture is purely defensive and not aimed at any other state, 
Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev said here Tuesday [24 
May]. 
  He was speaking after a meeting with defence ministers of 
the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organisation to explain Russia's 
long-awaited military doctrine to replace the security blueprint 
of the defunct Soviet Union. 
  But Grachev said Russia would continue to use its nuclear 
weapons "as a means of deterrence against a large-scale nuclear 
war." 
  He said Russia might use its nuclear weapons against 
countries with nuclear arsenals of their own, and perhaps 
against non-nuclear aggressor countries, whether or not they 
were in coalition with nuclear states. 
  Before his arrival, the ministers said NATO had reaffirmed 
the essential role of nuclear forces "including sub-strategic 
forces widely deployed in Europe at the minimum level necessary 
to preserve peace and stability." 
  But in a statement, the NATO ministers welcomed the fact 
that 
Russia, the United States and Britain had nearly completed steps 
to "de-target" strategic nuclear weapons pointed at each other. 
  "We expressed satisfaction with this important gesture 
marking the improved strategic climate between former Cold War 
adversaries," the statement said.

  [Text] Paris, May 24 (AFP) -- The contact group trying to 
restart the Bosnian peace process will meet Wednesday [25 May] 
in Talloires, a town in the French Alps, French Foreign Minister 
Alain Juppe said Tuesday. 
  The group, which includes experts from the European Union, 
Russia, the United States and the United Nations, is attempting 
to define a common stand concerning Bosnia in order to press the 
warring factions there to end the more than two-year conflict. 
  "If the parties involved don't want peace we will act 
accordingly," Juppe said. 
  Earlier this month, foreign ministers from the contact group 
met in Geneva and united in a bid to put the peace process back 
on track, by calling for a four-month ceasefire and a resumption 
of peace talks. 
  They also urged the warring parties to reach agreement on 
the 
basis of a European plan for the ethnic division of the former 
Yugoslavia, providing 51 percent of the territory for a Bosnian 
Croat-Moslem federation and 49 percent for the Bosnian Serbs. 
  "This plan respects Bosnia's unity," Juppe said, adding that 
if it were rejected by the warring parties, France would 
consider withdrawing its peacekeeping troops from Bosnia by the 
end of the year. 
  Spain and Britain have also said they may pull their troops 
from the war-torn country if there is no breakthrough in the 
peace process. 
  Juppe said members of the contact group did not plan to wait 
for an answer to their proposal beyond mid-June when they are 
due to hold another ministry-level meeting.

  [Excerpts] Paris, May 24 (AFP) -- Bosnia's warring 
factions will meet Wednesday [25 May] in the French town of 
Talloires with a contact group trying to restart the Bosnian 
peace process, a French diplomatic source said Wednesday. 
  The source said that the Moslem-led Bosnian government would 
be represented by Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic and the Serbs 
by the speaker of their self-proclaimed parliament, Momcilo 
Krajisnic. 
  In Zagreb, radio reports said Kresimir Zubak, the top 
Bosnian 
Croat leader, planned to attend the talks. 
  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe earlier announced that 
the contact group would meet in Talloires, in the French alps, 
but he did not mention that the warring factions would attend 
the meeting. [passage omitted] 
  Krajisnik, the Bosnian Serb speaker, arrived in Geneva later 
Tuesday, according to sources close to the contact group. 
  The Geneva sources said Silajdzic and Zubak had already 
arrived in the Swiss city. 
  Diplomatic sources in Geneva said preliminary talks would be 
held later Tuesday in Talloires in preparation for the meeting 
Wednesday. 
  Before leaving Belgrade, Krajisnik was quoted by the 
Belgrade 
news agency BETA as saying that the resumption of negotiations 
on Bosnia were "hitting up against some big problems." 
  He did not specify what these were, however. 
  Krajisnik was accompanied by his his self-proclaimed Serb 
republic's "foreign minister" Aleksandar Buha. 
  The BETA agency, quoting an official communique, had said 
Krajisnik would outline the Bosnian Serb position to 
international mediators David Owen for the European Union and 
Thorvald Stoltenberg for the United Nations. 
  It said the Serb side would ask for a "final" stop to 
fighting throughout Bosnia-Hercegovina and demand to be "treated 
the same" as other parties. 
  This was taken to mean that the Bosnian Serb negotiators 
would link their participation in negotiations to lifting 
international sanctions decreed against the rump Yugoslavia in 
May 1992.

  [Excerpts] Geneva, May 24 (AFP) -- Bosnian Moslems and 
Croats will press demands for more land at a meeting of the 
warring factions Wednesday [25 May] in the French Alps near here 
with an international contact group, a Moslem delegate said. 
  Sources close to the talks said the final delegates from all 
three sides had arrived in Geneva Tuesday. [passage omitted] 
  The Bosnian Serb delegation arrived Tuesday, headed by 
Momcilo Krajisnik, the speaker of their self-proclaimed 
parliament. 
  Krajisnik said his side wanted a ceasefire as soon as 
possible and did not attach any conditions to a truce or new 
peace talks. 
  But, he insisted, referring to sanctions in effect against 
Serbia and NATO air raids against Bosnian Serbs, "we think we 
must be treated in the same way." 
  "Serbs are the only ones to be threatened ... to get bombed 
and to have sanctions imposed against them," he said, speaking 
after a meeting with international mediators Lord Owen and 
Thorvald Stoltenberg. 
  A member of the Moslem delegation who asked not to be named 
accused the superpowers Tuesday of trying to "dictate and 
impose" a solution on Bosnia-Herzegovina that would not restore 
peace. 
  He rejected a European plan for the ethnic division of 
Bosnia- Herzegovina, which the contact group backed at a meeting 
in Geneva on May 13 and urged all sides to accept. [passage 
omitted] 
  The Moslem delegate Tuesday said the Moslem and Croat 
leaders 
-- who agreed this year to form a new Moslem-Croat federation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina -- would use their own proposal made in 
Vienna earlier this month. 
  That plan gave the federation a greater chunk of land, 58 
percent of Bosnian territory, than the European plan. 
  The European plan provides 51 percent of the territory for 
the Moslem-Croat federation and 49 percent for Bosnian Serbs. 
  The Moslem delegate said the Moslems and Croats would 
present 
themselves as a "united" front at Talloires and "undertake 
discussions on the basis" of their Vienna plan. 
  Krajisnik said setting percentages for partitioning land was 
"a useless way of doing things. It must not be a precondition 
for the continuation of talks." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By Graham Brown] </F>
  [Text] Brussels, May 24 (AFP) -- The Netherlands 
criticised France and Britain here Tuesday [24 May] for 
threatening to withdraw their troops from Bosnia-Herzegovina, a 
Dutch NATO source said. 
  He quoted Dutch Defence Minister Rebus Ter Beek as saying 
that threats of unilateral withdrawal jeopardize the safety of 
other nationalities making up the United Nations Protection 
Force (UNPROFOR) in Bosnia. 
  Ter Beek made his criticism at a meeting of defence 
ministers 
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. 
  German Defence Minister Volker Ruehe said the meeting 
expressed agreement that there should be no more unilateral 
decisions or statements about troop withdrawals from Bosnia. 
  The ministers also agreed that any discussions of troop 
withdrawals should be conducted in private, and made public in 
the media only when final decisions were made. 
  Ter Beek asked British Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind to 
ensure that Britain made no more withdrawal threats. 
  Last week France, followed by Britain, said it could 
withdraw 
troops from Bosnia unless there was new progress towards peace 
there. 
  Ter Beek addressed his remarks only at Britain because 
France 
was not represented at the meeting of defence ministers, not 
being a member of NATO's integrated military structure. 
  But the Dutch source said the criticism was intended equally 
for Paris. France has about 6,800 troops in ex-Yugoslavia, and 
Britain about 3,000. The Netherlands also has about 3,000 
troops in the UNPROFOR force. 
  Ter Beek also urged a more equitable sharing of UN 
peace-keeping costs around the world, saying that the 
Netherlands was paying more than its fair share relative to its 
size. 
  He put the Dutch peace-keeping bill, mainly in Bosnia, at 
350 
million guilders (about $185 million).

  [Text] Vienna, May 24, (AFP) -- A United Nations special 
coordinator charged with the reconstruction of war-torn Sarajevo 
put the prospective repair bill at $532 million Tuesday [24 May]. 
  William Eagleton believes the money should cover a two-phase 
programme to rebuild the drinking water and public transport 
networks, restore electricity and gas supplies and rebuild 
hospitals and schools. 
  The first phase will cover a six-month period, and foresees 
using around half the total fund to deal with schemes classified 
as urgent. Restoring drinking water to the Bosnian capital 
alone is set to cost $57 million. In the transport sector, some 
$23 million have been earmarked for repairing Sarajevo airport. 
  Phase two is scheduled to last for up to two years. 
  Eagleton unveiled the scheme at the opening of a Vienna 
conference called by UN special envoy to ex-Yugoslavia Yasushi 
Akashi. The basis of the rebuilding plan was agreed by the UN 
Security Council in March in line with an accord stipulating the 
withdrawal of Serbian heavy arms from the city's environs. 
  Akashi reminded conferees from 31 countries the UN 
Protection 
Force [UNPROFOR] had already created an interim coordination 
body in early March to address the question of Sarajevo's 
reconstruction. 
  He explained Eagleton's plan had been worked out following 
close cooperation on the ground with Bosnian authorities. 
  The head of the Bosnian delegation in Vienna, Hasan 
Muratovic, reminded those present of the extent of the war 
damage in Bosnia- Herzegovina as a whole, but especially in 
Sarajevo. He stressed the importance of reestablishing 
transport links between Sarajevo and the Adriatic coast, part of 
which Serb forces continue to block. 
  Muratovic appealed to the UN Security Council to give 
unconditional guarantees of free passage between the capital and 
the coast. 
  A second conference, in New York, is due to monitor the 
scheme' progress later this year.

<F P=106> [Report by Guy Daloze: "New Prime Minister in Early July?"] </F>
  [Text] Let us dare to paint a striking scenario and 
hypothesize that, on 24 and 25 June in Corfu, Jean-Luc Dehaene 
will be appointed president of the European Commission by his 
fellow heads of government, replacing Jacques Delors. 
  Let us assume he wins out over his Netherlands colleague 
Ruud 
Lubbers, who is too widely suspected of Atlanticism and bias 
toward the United States. 
  Let us say that two weeks previously the Belgian coalition 
in 
power is rudely shaken by the results of the imminent European 
elections announced in our Friday editions by our exclusive "LA 
LIBRE BELGIQUE Marketing Unit" poll, showing the liberal union 
to be the leading force in the country, the PS [Walloon 
Socialist Party] to be in collapse, the CVP [Flemish Christian 
People's Party] not to have undergone the "Van Hecke" effect and 
now to be suffering a fresh identity crisis. 
  Let us imagine Jean-Luc Dehaene resigning from his prime 
ministerial duties in early July with a view to taking up his 
European duties on 5 January 1995. However, he knows that 
before then he must use subtle mixtures and extensive 
international contacts to appoint his enlarged team of 
commissioners. 
  For purely logical reasons, he is also aware that he will 
have to pass on the baton to his Belgian successor during the 
summer, when the 1995 budget will be drawn up, with all its 
political implications. 
<H5>  Most Likely Successor </H5>
  The party chairmen hold a meeting. Their first decision is 
not to hold a general election -- otherwise scheduled for the 
end of December 1995 -- too early, and above all not to hold it 
at the same time as the local elections due in October: The 
stakes are too different... and Christian socialists and 
socialists risk losing too many municipal citadels if the two 
types of elections are mixed. 
  Consequently, the resolution is adopted to continue with the 
same alliance for a limited period of time - say, spring 1995 - 
and on the basis of a well-defined and stabilizing program which 
must enable each individual to gain more weight. 
  The most likely successor, the CVP's Herman Van Rompuy, 
declines the offer. It is too early, his party is way down deep 
in the doldrums, and he does not (yet) feel cut out for the job. 
So everyone turns to Melchior Wathelet [deputy prime minister] 
of the PSC [Christian Socialist Party], the unhappy and unlucky 
candidate back in the winter of 1991. 
  No more "sand trap" full of treacherous little phrases, 
however: People turn to him as a symbol of "an alternative, of 
another way" and as a "great communicator." It is up to him to 
boost the prestige of the coalition. Melchior Wathelet accepts, 
but there is no question of him simply serving as a temporary 
solution: He demands a solid program from his partners. And a 
formal commitment. 
  Even if he only takes up his post for less than one year, 
(let us say nine months, because his traumatized coalition 
partners cannot be asked to do the impossible), the new 
government will have to govern the country and avoid repeated 
internal crises. 
  Political fiction? No. The scenario we have just painted is 
being considered within various party headquarters. And not 
only within the PSC.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Netherlands Will Not Send Any </F>
Troops To Rwanda Due To Major Risks Involved"] 
  [Text] The Netherlands will not be sending any troops to 
Rwanda. The security risks are regarded as being unacceptably 
high. The cabinet decided this on Friday [20 May] at the behest 
of Defense Minister Ter Beek. 
  The UN Security Council decided earlier this week to send a 
unit of 5,500 Blue Helmets to war-torn Rwanda to protect the 
refugees and the humanitarian aid workers. 
  The Rwandan rebels immediately threatened to regard the UN 
troops as enemies if they tried to form a buffer between 
themselves and the government troops. It is becoming 
increasingly clear that the UN force for Rwanda will have to 
consist primarily of troops from other African countries. 
  Informally, the Netherlands is being sounded out by the 
United Nations to send technical support troops. The government 
considered the possibility of deploying military policemen or 
logistics and transport troops -- a so-called "movement control 
unit" -- from the Army. 
  Due to the crackdown on illegal immigrants in the border 
areas of the Netherlands, however, there were no military 
policemen available. Several dozen Army troops could be 
provided, but they would be in too great a danger today. 
  Netherlanders run a particular risk in Rwanda because they 
closely resemble Belgians, it was admitted in The Hague. In 
light of the colonial past, Belgians in Rwanda and Burundi are 
in greater danger than other westerners. The only Netherlander 
in Kigali was stationed at the UNAMIR [UN Assistance Mission in 
Rwanda] observer mission headquarters and had to be evacuated 
with the Belgians. 
  Since UNAMIR was set up in Arusha in August 1993, nine 
Netherlands observers, officers and noncommissioned officers in 
the Army, have been stationed in the area along the 
Ugandan-Rwandan border. On Friday, the government decided to 
assess the need to increase the number of observers. 
  Furthermore, a study was launched to establish the need for 
military air transport for troops, foodstuffs, or medicines. 
The Air Force might be able to make a number of F-27's 
available. It is virtually out of the question that the sole 
Hercules C-130 owned by the Air Force will be used for this 
purpose. The problem is that its Netherlands crews are still 
undergoing training with the Belgian Air Force.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Netherlands and Suriname Agree </F>
On Control of Economy"] 
  [Text] Last weekend, the Netherlands and Suriname agreed on 
an "honorable" way in which the Netherlands will assess the 
developments of the Surinamese economy in the next few months. 
Depending on that assessment, the Netherlands will decide 
whether it will resume its support to the Surinamese balance of 
payments and whether it will provide funds for the creation of 
an industry fund. 
  This was stated by Surinamese President R. Venetiaan last 
Sunday [22 May] at a news conference in Amsterdam, during a 
short stay in the Netherlands. The disagreement between both 
countries concerned the question whether the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF) would be granted permission to "report" to 
the Netherlands about the reorganisation plans for the 
Surinamese economy. Cooperation Development Minister Pronk had 
requested the IMF to express such an independent opinion. 
  The disagreement on the meaning of the IMF report was not 
due 
to "childish stubborness on the part of Suriname," Venetiaan 
stated, but was a matter of "honor and national sovereignty." 
The compromise, which was reached after almost half a year of 
negotiations, holds that Suriname will admit observers from the 
IMF, but that it will not officially submit the reports and 
recommendations to the Netherlands. The Netherlands will, 
however, get the reports from the IMF later on, informally. 
  Last March, Minister Pronk had already agreed with his 
Surinamese colleague on the way in which the IMF would supervise 
the changes to the Surinamese economy. It had been agreed that 
the organization would draw up quarterly reports, with 
suggestions to gear the economy to the existing recovery plans. 
  Later on, there was political disagreement on this issue in 
Suriname. The country objects to the IMF's formal role, because 
it refuses to comply with the organization's recommendations, 
which are expected to be strict. According to Venetiaan, 
Minister Pronk hinted last Saturday that "compromises" about the 
IMF approach could lead to the recovery of Dutch support to the 
balance of payments. 
  The Surinamese president was in the Netherlands after visits 
to Indonesia, Malaysia, and China, but he refused to elaborate 
on the results of this trip. In Indonesia, there were talks 
about the large-scale tree felling projects, for which 
Indonesian businessmen were given a license. According to 
several environmental groups, the relevant developers have a bad 
reputation. 
  They fear that the Surinamese rain forest might be developed 
in the same way as parts of East Kalimantan in Indonesia. In 
spite of the strict forest legislation, the jungle has been 
irreparably damaged there in many places, because the control of 
the development failed due to corruption. Venetiaan said that 
he found no evidence of irresponsible lumbering in Indonesia. 
  Indonesia did promise Suriname's support for the training of 
forest rangers. The Netherlands has also provided money for 
that purpose.

<F P=106> [Article by John Hibbs: "Labour Aims for Mid-Way Vote </F>
Appeal"] 
  [Text] Action for growth, jobs and investment is Labour's 
priority in its European election manifesto Make Europe Work for 
You. 
  It seeks to position Labour's appeal midway between the 
unconditional federalist aspirations of the Liberal Democrats 
and a divided Tory Party. 
  The document says Labour wants Britain to take a leading 
role 
in re-shaping Europe, making its institutions more accountable. 
Its key proposals are: 
<H5>  ECONOMY </H5>
  A "practical jobs strategy," which acknowledges that growth 
and full employment will only be achieved through sustained 
investment. It calls for: 
  a. Co-ordinated monetary and fiscal policies; 
  b. Better use of the European Investment Bank; Creation of a 
European fund to generate jobs; 
  c. Development of trans-European transport and 
telecommunications networks; d. Incentives to industry to 
increase investment in research and development; implementing 
regulations to bar unfair competition; 
  e. A campaign for greater take-up of European structural 
funds by local authorities in the regions. 
  Labour supports the principle of a managed exchange rate, 
and 
also progress towards economic and monetary union, but makes it 
clear there first has to be convergence of the economic 
performance of member-states. 
<H5>  SOCIAL CHAPTER </H5>
  Labour would immediately sign the Social Chapter of the 
Maastricht Treaty. Meanwhile its MEPs [members of the European 
Parliament] would strive for a guaranteed minimum wage improved 
health and safety at work, the right to belong to a trade union, 
equal opportunities for women, and protection against 
redundancy. 
  While ruling out legislation to enforce a 35-hour week, it 
expects reductions in hours, to share work, subject to agreement 
between employers and staff. It demands greater consultation 
with unions over training, issues relating to multi-national 
companies, full-time and part-time work regulations on young 
workers and environmental measures at work. 
  Sex discrimination legislation should be strengthened, 
giving 
part-time workers the same rights as full-timers. Race 
relations laws should be enforced, outlawing harassment, 
discrimination and racial violence. A commissioner should be 
appointed for racial issues. 
<H5>  COUNTRYSIDE </H5>
  The Common Agricultural Policy should be replaced in 1996 
with a strategy "to reinvigorate the countryside." 
  The manifesto mentions incentives for farmers to manage land 
in socially and environmentally acceptable ways, promoting the 
cultivation of healthy food at prices all can afford, and 
encouraging small producers. 
  Labour wants better conditions for the transport of animals 
an end to cruel battery farming and changes to the Treaty of 
Rome, treating animals as "sentient beings." 
  It backs a joint approach to health promotion, research into 
cures for cancer and Aids, and programmes for tackling drug and 
alcohol abuse. Labour demands a ban on tobacco advertising. 
<H5>  A WIDER EUROPE </H5>
  Aid and trade agreements should help the new democracies of 
eastern Europe offering full membership when they are able to 
bear its responsibilities. 
  Labour backs the harmonisation of migration and asylum 
policies, while maintaining each nation's responsibility for 
implementing the rules. 
  It urges more open decision-making within EC institutions 
and 
greater powers for the Parliament. Qualified majority voting 
should extend to environmental and social affairs, but Britain 
should retain its veto on tax policy foreign affairs and defence 
changes to the Treaty of Rome and "other areas of key national 
interest". 
  European spending should be kept under scrutiny. Increases 
in the European aid budget should not be at the expense of 
Britain's overseas aid programme. International trade 
agreements should include clauses to promote human rights, 
combat child labour and guarantee collective bargaining.

<F P=106> [Article by Robert Shrimsley: "Key to Future Lies in Full </F>
Integration, Says Ashdown"] 
  [Text] The Cover of the Liberal Democrat manifesto bears 
the slogan "Unlocking Britain's Potential." 
  Inside, the 28-page document takes a straightforward tone. 
Britain could achieve far more if at the heart of a fully 
integrated Europe. 
  It opposes a "centralised superstate," preferring a 
streamlined Commission and a strengthened Parliament. The 
Council of Ministers would be required to take its decisions in 
public and the use of qualified majority voting would be 
extended. 
  Nevertheless, the Lib-Dems are ready to put their views to 
the test. If the 1996 inter-governmental conference proposes 
significant reforms the party will seek "popular assent for 
them." Mr Ashdown said yesterday this meant that if all parties 
remained pro-EC he would hold a referendum on any major changes . 
<H5>  SOCIAL POLlCY </H5>
  The manifesto calls for the scrapping of the Social Charter 
opt-out and says the party will try to guarantee equal rights 
for women and part-time workers. 
  It rejects however, an imposed 35-hour week while supporting 
greater employee rights. 
<H5>  EDUCATION </H5>
  It calls for the reskilling of the British workforce by 
investing in education. 
  A pre-school nursery place for every three and four-year-old 
and nore spending on books, equipment and school buildings is 
pledged. The Lib-Dems promise to fund this with an extra penny 
in the pound of income tax. 
<H5>  UNEMPLOYMENT </H5>
  The party recommends spending in investment and 
infrastructure, making full use of European social and regional 
funds. 
  These would be used to generate more private investment in 
major capital projects. 
<H5>  FINANCE </H5>
  The party would back moves towards a single currency. The 
Bank of England would become independent, making interest rate 
changes, prior to the creation of a European Central Bank. Low 
taxes are promised wherever possible. 
  Local income tax would replace the council tax. 
<H5>  ENVIRONMENT </H5>
  Green taxes are also favoured -- a Europe-wide carbon/energy 
tax should be phased in -- and there should be cross-Continent 
initiatives to tackle pollution. 
<H5>  COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY </H5>
  It should be replaced by a "Common Rural Policy," aimed at 
sustainability, diversification towards forestry and less 
intensive use of land. CAP (Common Agricultural Policy) 
payments would be redirected on environmental lines. 
<H5>  DEFENCE </H5>
  While supporting NATO, the manifesto says Europe should take 
more responsibility for its security and for world 
peace-keeping. 
<H5>  CRIME </H5>
  Europe-wide co-operation to tackle the drugs threat is 
proposed. The European Convention on Human Rights would be 
incorporated into UK law. 
<H5>  DECENTRALISATION </H5>
  The greater emphasis on Europe is counter-balanced by a 
policy of downward decentralisation with measures aimed at 
recreating communities and giving more power to local, parish 
and neighbourhood councils.

<F P=106> [Article by Roland Gribben: "BAe Merger Door Stays Open </F>
Says Weinstock"] 
  [Text] GEC [General Electric Company] yesterday attempted 
to give a merger deal with British Aerospace [BAe] another push 
by suggesting the tie-up between the two companies could lead to 
the creation of a national defence company. But Dick Evans, BAe 
chief executive, gave a cool response to the idea and said there 
were no plans for re-opening negotiations on any merger talks. 
  Lord Weinstock, GEC managing director, indicated, during an 
interview with the BBC Money Programme, he was still holding the 
merger door open and suggested the consolidation of existing 
technical and joint venture links would produce a "national 
champion" in the defence market. He said: "I think if the 
national champion or the national defence company were more 
efficient you would automatically get more protection. 
  "We would have more protection at home against imports and 
better prospects of making export sales. So I do not think 
there is any question that we could make the industry stronger 
by an amalgamation which created a single prime contractor." 
  Lord Weinstock said he would like the talks with BAe to 
resume "under certain conditions" but made it clear they could 
not proceed unless BAe was "wholeheartedly in favour" of them. 
  On the same programme Mr Evans said he was "very keen" for 
the existing relationship between the two companies to continue, 
but added: "It does not have to go to a vertically integrated 
merger." 
  Mr Evans was criticised earlier this year for going out on a 
limb in backing a GEC and BAe merger but now feels that the 
aerospace group is in a stronger position to maintain its 
defence role through joint ventures rather than a complete 
merger. 
  Robert Bauman, new chairman, is also said to be supporting 
the joint venture rather than merger route. The feeling in the 
BAe camp is that Lord Weinstock missed his chance of picking up 
the group cheaply when the share price collapsed. 
  One source said: "He was worried about black holes in the 
balance sheet but action is now being taken to fill them."

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Sinn Fein leader Martin McGuiness </F>
by unidentified correspondent on 20 May; place not specified -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] As you may have heard on "Morning 
Ireland" this morning, the chairman of Sinn Fein in the north, 
Mitchell McLaughlin, said that measurable progress was made with 
the British Government's commentary on his party's questions 
about the Downing Street Declaration. Mr. McLaughlin told RTE 
that Sinn Fein was committed to working its way round the 
clarification roadblock, and he was hoping that the answers they 
had got would succeed in that purpose. But he said the 
conditions required to render the IRA campaign redundant were 
still some way off. While our bulletin was on air, I spoke to 
the Sinn Fein leader Martin McGuinness about his response to the 
British Government's commentary. 
  [McGuinness] We believe that the peace process, necessarily 
by the nature of the thing, will be a series of small steps, and 
we believe that is far more important than grand unilateral 
gestures. We believe that small steps are actually the [word 
indistinct] substance of a developing peace process, and we will 
have to look at what the British Government has said in that 
context. I have been saying, as you're aware, for some time 
that what Republicans were looking for was a level playing 
pitch. And we will look at what the British Government has said 
in these answers and see whether or not this actually provides a 
level playing pitch. 
  [Correspondent] Well, what would you single out as advances 
in the commentary? 
  [McGuinness] Well, I wouldn't be prepared to single anything 
out at this stage, it's much too early. Sinn Fein personnel 
individually will be examining what the British Government has 
said in their reply and they will then by the nature of our 
organization [words indistinct] collective thinking on this, and 
we will then arrive at a position -- hopefully, shortly.... 
  [Correspondent, interrupting] Mitchell McLaughlin said this 
morning that measurable progress was made with this British 
Government commentary. He said that the British had recognized 
that Sinn Fein had serious and legitimate questions to ask, and 
I believe he referred to the fact that your electoral mandate 
was recognized. 
  [McGuinness] Yes. Well, I mean obviously this is very 
important from our point of view and we will look at all that 
the British Government said in their reply in the context of the 
questions which we put to the British Government, which were 
very detailed questions, which go to the heart of what we 
believe to be the problem here in the (?six counties). And 
obviously we are going to have give that [word indistinct] 
consideration and that isn't something that can be done in hours 
or days; it's going to take some time. But it will be done as 
expeditiously as we possibly can do. 
  [Correspondent] But the taoiseach [Irish Prime Minister 
Albert Reynolds] has already questioned whether or not another 
life should be put in danger, given the fact that so much effort 
has been made to open the door to Sinn Fein to come into the 
democratic political arena. 
  [McGuinness] And we have been at the heart of that movement. 
Sinn Fein has taken a very active role. In fact, I think we can 
credibly make the case that we have been the initiators of this 
process. And I'm not going to go into a history of the whole 
business, but I think we can say with some credibility that we 
were the initiators of it, and we have been trying to bring 
about a situation where (?not a single life is lost). We 
realize that there's massive tragedy here in this part of 
Ireland where we live -- (?many) soldiers have lost their lives; 
a young child is lying on its deathbed in Armagh; Catholics have 
been killed daily by Loyalist paramilitaries. And all that we 
are doing --this is our primary political objective -- is to 
attempt to bring an end to all of this, and we are trying to do 
this as constructively as we possibly can. 
  [Correspondent] But don't you recognize that that child 
would 
not be lying on that bed in Armagh if it weren't for the IRA? 
  [McGuinness] Well, I (?just) don't think anybody would lose 
their lives in the situation here in the north if it wasn't for 
the political situation which we've all been condemned to live 
in for the last 25 years. And I don't think that we can see the 
issue of violence and what people are doing as separate somehow 
from the factors which are there in the background, which have 
caused this instability and violence which afflicts our 
community [words indistinct] 
  [Correspondent] Can you give people encouragement then? Can 
you give them some hope as the result of what has transpired 
over the last 24 hours? 
  [McGuinness] Yes, I think we can. Sinn Fein is still very 
very committed to an effective peace process, but that must be a 
peace process which embraces everyone. No party must be 
excluded. And we are prepared to play a full and positive role 
in this. And we will continue with that. Of course. 
  [Correspondent] But don't you think this process could be 
speeded up at this stage? Because the longer it goes on, the 
more blood will be spilt. People are talking about something 
coming after the European elections now -- surely that's 
allowing the agony to continue too long? 
  [McGuinness] Well, I mean, even reading this morning's IRISH 
TIMES, I mean, there are people in Dublin, in the establishment 
there, who accept that because of the nature of Republicanism 
and the type of organization we are that this is by necessity 
going to take some time. Now I certainly hope that it will not 
be an overdue length of time and that we can get rid of this 
whole issue as quickly as we possibly can. And the reality is 
that we are in the middle of an election, the European 
elections, we do have a policy of consulting our membership. 
This is something that we do on a regular basis and by the 
nature of things we have to do this and this is going to cause, 
I believe, a slight delay. But hopefully it won't be too long. 
  [Correspondent] Given the fact that the British Government 
says that constitutional matters, including the Government of 
Ireland Act, can be on the table, do you feel that you can 
advise your supporters to look favorably on this commentary? 
  [McGuinness] Well, I think we will have to look at all of 
that, at everything which the British Government has said -- all 
the positive stuff and anything which may be negative -- and see 
what our opinion is at the end of that process. And I couldn't 
at this stage attempt to prejudge what the positive elements or 
negative elements are, but certainly we will give it very very 
serious consideration. And we will attempt to move the peace 
process on in a positive way -- absolutely. 
  [Correspondent] And that was the Sinn Fein leader Martin 
McGuinness speaking on the line from Northern Ireland.

<F P=106> [Interview with James Molyneux, leader of the Ulster </F>
Unionist Party, by correspondent Brendan Wright in Belfast; date 
not given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Molyneaux] I regret that [words indistinct] of the 
warning, the caution which I gave to the prime minister when he 
met the other three party leaders along with me way back three 
years ago, when I said that as long as there is ambiguity and 
uncertainty over the constitutional future of Northern Ireland 
there will be attempts to achieve a balance of terror. Very 
regrettably, that is what is now coming about. 
  [Wright] Are you saying that you always thought there was a 
certain inevitability about Loyalist paramilitary attacks in the 
south? 
  [Molyneaux] Well, in the south and in Northern Ireland, too, 
I mean, the weight of their attacks, let's face it, has been in 
Northern Ireland, not in the south. They've only had one attack 
in Dublin in the recent years, but look how many you've had in 
Northern Ireland within the last month. So it's a far, far 
bigger problem in Northern Ireland. 
  [Wright] Now, of course, you don't speak for the Loyalist 
paramilitaries, but do you have any view as to why the UDF 
[Ulster Defense Force] should have carried out this attack? 
  [Molyneaux] Well, I don't know, but it's been that pattern, 
what I say, a balance of terror. It's part of the pattern of 
the attacks in Northern Ireland. It can't be separated from 
that. It's all of a piece. 
  [Wright] And what do you think will be the effect of the 
attack in Dublin? 
  [Molyneaux] Well, I think that probably they are bound to be 
worried, as we all are worried in Belfast, by what has been 
going on up here in this end of the island, for all of these 
recent weeks particularly. I think that probably in the minds 
of people in Whitehall, the draughtsmen of various documents and 
so forth, they don't really understand the feeling of exclusion, 
alienation if you like, of people in Northern Ireland and they 
look at various documents which have been drafted by -- and I'm 
being racist here -- by Englishmen who don't have a feel for the 
situation, and when they're read over here in the Shankill Road 
they look like a sellout and then certain people tell them it's 
a sellout and that doesn't help, either. 
  [Wright] And do you think part of the reasoning behind 
carrying out this attack might well be to try and force the 
Dublin government to change their attitude towards Sinn Fein and 
the IRA? I mean, some people in the Loyalist quarters consider 
the Dublin goverment to be nothing more than messenger boys for 
Sinn Fein. 
  [Molyneaux] Well, it's -- yes, it's not just what I think 
about it, but they actually have said that that is the position. 
I mean, those who have carried out the attacks have said that 
actually in their statements when they claimed responsibility, 
if you like -- I think that's the term they tend to use -- but 
they have said that that's the object of it, and who are we to 
dispute that? 
  [Wright] At the weekend, on Friday [20 May], you called on 
Loyalist paramilitaries to cease their violence. It's only been 
a matter of a few days, but do you think your message will get 
through to them? 
  [Molyneaux] Well, I think the fact that -- and despite what 
has happened and all the regrettable things have happened 
including the bombing in Dublin -- I think despite all of that 
it is very encouraging that even as recently as this morning 
they are saying now that -- and letting it be known -- that 
their combined leadership, whatever structure it may be, are 
going to this week to be considering more carefully the 
statement I made and what lies behind that statement, namely, 
the routes which were slightly obscure in the Declaration which 
have been more clearly signposted in the clarification document, 
and it's now easier to point out to people and easier to make 
them understand that that route always was there, that it's now 
much more clearly identified.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel by Klaus-Peter </F>
Siegloch and Klaus Bresser on 24 May; in the last 15 minutes, 
Kinkel is confronted with a "surprise guest," SPD Federal 
Manager Guenther Verheugen; place not given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Siegloch] Mr. Kinkel, you are the kingmaker. 
Yesterday, your Free Democratic Party [FDP] made sure that the 
Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] 
candidate was elected president. Was it only a question of 
Herzog, or were Kohl and the coalition in Bonn also at stake. 
  [Kinkel] The presidential election is a political decision, 
and, having this in mind, we made our decision yesterday. After 
the second ballot, I recommended that my group vote for Roman 
Herzog. First, because we think he is the appropriate candidate, 
and, second -- and I said that clearly before -- we made a 
coalition statement for the CDU/CSU that is to be confirmed at 
the party congress in Rostock. We must pursue a 
straightforward, reliable course, which is why our decision was 
right. [passage omitted] 
  [Siegloch] Mr. Kinkel, the FDP seems to be envisaging a 
completely different republic. Let me quote some keywords from 
your election program: social benefits should be further cut; 
those who employ unemployed people should be permitted to pay 
lower wages in the future; at the same time, high-income earners 
should pay less tax and the highest tax rate should be cut to 
below 45 percent. Is yours not a different society than our 
current social market economy; would your plans not create a 
society in which the poorer will get poorer still and the rich 
even richer? 
  [Kinkel] We do not want the poor to get poorer. The FDP has 
demonstrated that is has the necessary social sensitivity, and I 
have done so personally in the past in my time as justice 
minister and even before that. Still, as an economics party, if 
I may put it this way, we must first make sure that the baskets 
are full. After all, we can distribute things from this basket 
only when they are full. Sometimes one gets the impression in 
this country that people do not always see it that way and that 
they would like to hand out what they have not yet earned. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Bresser] Let us assume that you again manage to get into 
the Bundestag with your elitist program. Nevertheless, you are 
no longer the third most important force in the Bundestag, and 
thus no longer the party that could create the majority or tip 
the scales. 
  [Kinkel] Who has said that? 
  [Bresser] All recent opinion polls say that a coalition 
between the CDU/CSU and the FDP will not achieve a majority in 
the next Bundestag election? 
  [Kinkel] Just wait and see. 
  [Bresser] Anyway, do you not sometimes think that you might 
be in opposition as of October? 
  [Kinkel] First of all, in the upcoming elections, and the 
Bundestag election in particular, we are campaigning for 
ourselves. We want to achieve good results for ourselves, for 
the FDP, because we think that we have a right to exist as a 
party, regardless of considerations concerning our function. 
Let me seize the opportunity and say something. A small though 
fine party, since 1949 this FDP has proved at the local, 
laender, and federal level that it can make practical policy. 
At the federal level, in particular, the FDP has made a 
decisive contribution to the reconstruction of the country after 
1945 and 1949, and, most notably, it has also made its 
contribution to unification. Contrary to others that are now 
proclaiming all kinds of vision, such as the Instead Party or 
other short-lived groups, we have proved our ability in 
practical policies. The functional element, which some people 
recently claimed we no longer had, has not disappeared. On the 
contrary, it looks as if the CDU/CSU were anxious to continue 
the coalition with us, thus hoping and thinking that we will 
succeed. As far as Mr. Scharping is concerned, I am also 
waiting for coalition statements. He has said that he cannot 
imagine cooperation with the Greens because of their program, 
which calls for resigning from NATO, giving up the Bundeswehr, 
etc. 
  [Bresser] Would you enter into a coalition with the SPD 
[Social Democratic Party of Germany] if Scharping were to be 
ahead of the CDU/CSU after the Bundestag election and a 
coalition between the SPD and the FDP had a majority? 
  [Kinkel] Mr. Bresser, I have just made a coalition statement 
in favor of the CDU/CSU, and we had a difficult poll yesterday 
in the federal convention. You cannot expect me to answer the 
question you have just asked me on your television show. 
  [Siegloch] Still, the fact is that according to all recent 
surveys you only come in fourth place. You simply have to 
acknowledge that you can no longer play the crucial role the FDP 
has in the past 30 or 40 years as you have just described, 
because you are only the fourth strongest party. 
  [Kinkel] Of course [pauses]...what do you mean place four? 
This is where we are at the moment. I am not denying that the 
Greens -- of whom you are thinking when you speak of place 
number three -- have made considerable gains, and that they have 
benefited significantly from the fact that they do not bear any 
responsibility at the federal level. In some of the laender 
they do, and there the governments that were set up together 
with the Greens are not that fantastic in practice. Regarding 
the federal level, I can see how the republic is waiting for an 
SPD/Greens government. I have noticed that in Mr. Scharping, 
how much he would be looking forward to that. But, just wait. 
Mr. Scharping has said that he would like to have the choice 
after the Bundestag election. Fine. As far as I am concerned, 
I do not worry too much about my FDP and I repeat what I said 
before -- namely, that support for us is growing. I bet that we 
will do well in the Bundestag election. [passage omitted] 
  [Bresser] After the UN debacle in Somalia, you were once 
again prepared to send German soldiers to Africa, this time to 
Rwanda. Did the Defense Ministry have to stop you from doing 
this? 
  [Kinkel] You have been misinformed. There was a telephone 
conversation between Volker Ruehe and me on the subject of 
possible deployment in Rwanda. There was talk of two UN tasks 
-- namely, setting up field hospitals and making aerial 
deliveries of supplies from Nairobi to Kigali. 
  [Bresser] Is that what you were in favor of? 
  [Kinkel] We both supported the latter task, but on two 
conditions. First, the security situation in Kigali had to be 
in order, and the warring parties had to agree. 
  [Bresser] But Mr. Ruehe had a different opinion. He said 
the military situation was confusing. According to him, the 
military situation was dangerous, so one should not go to Rwanda 
at all, regardless of with whom one goes. 
  [Kinkel] That is incorrect. Either Mr. Ruehe or you have 
misunderstood something. Just as I had in my telephone 
conversation with Mr. Ruehe, the cabinet discussed this issue at 
length, and Mr. Ruehe of course subscribed to the decision that 
we should fly to Rwanda subject to these conditions. 
  [Bresser] He said German interests are not recognizable. 
  [Kinkel] I do not know to whom he told this. In any case, 
he never said it in the cabinet. 
  [Siegloch] Bosnia is much closer than Africa. What can the 
Germans do for war-ravaged Bosnia? How can they help the 
Bosnians? And in one of the "What Now, Mr...?" series of 
programs, Chancellor Kohl announced that the Germans want to go 
to the limits of their abilities. Are you in favor of the 
deployment of German medical personnel in Bosnia? 
  [Kinkel] First of all, I would not accept what you have just 
said about Rwanda. I must protest. What is happening in Rwanda 
is the worst kind of genocide; 500,000 people have probably been 
killed there in a brutal fashion. If the world is to apply 
equal standards, it cannot and must not sit and watch. We cannot 
send any soldiers there on account of our constitutional 
situation, but the cabinet agreed that we can extend our help in 
the humanitarian sphere. As for Bosnia, we also cannot perform 
specific missions there on account of our constitutional 
situation. But even if we could, the situation is different 
because for historical reasons we would never reach a Bundestag 
majority decision in favor of such a mission. 
  [Siegloch] Sooner Rwanda than Bosnia. Is that right? 
  [Kinkel] It would probably be easier for the Bundestag to 
reach a decision concerning a mission to Rwanda because we bear 
no historical burden in that country. As I said, constitutional 
reasons prevent us from acting in both countries, but I hope the 
Constitutional Court will help us in June-July. 
  [Siegloch] Do you favor the deployment of German troops 
within the UN framework, because only in that way could you 
fulfill -- or at least come close to -- your ambition of a 
permanent seat on the UN Security Council in New York? 
  [Kinkel] That is what people suspect. There is no direct 
connection with such an ambition, but I must of course consider 
how we should shape our future relations with the United 
Nations. As for my wish to become a permanent member of the UN 
Security Council, I happen to have the support of 75-80 percent 
of the population. I would like to make it clear that this idea 
did not originate with me, but with the SPD, something that is 
also interesting to know. 
  [Bresser] But on the other hand, we are dealing with joint 
activity on a European level. Is it therefore necessary for us 
to be represented in New York as a nation? 
  [Kinkel] If it were possible for the European Union [EU] to 
be represented in New York, I have always said that we would 
agree. But this will not be possible; this is a utopian idea. 
France and Great Britain will, of course, wish to remain 
permanent members of the Security Council. I checked this 
beforehand. We would of course immediately agree to a Security 
Council seat for the EU, but this is out of the question. 
  [Siegloch] What do you tell your foreign interlocutors about 
Germany's image in the world and about Solingen, Luebeck, and 
Magdeburg? Are these merely regrettable individual incidents, 
or do you think something is once again brewing in Germany? 
  [Kinkel] In any case, I find it difficult to discuss these 
things with my foreign colleagues, because this topic plays a 
much stronger role than people in Germany think. On the one 
hand, I try to explain that these are regrettable individual 
incidents, at least in my opinion, and that we are trying to 
resolve these issues and this terrible problem at the initial 
stage and in terms of sanctions, and of course I also say that I 
am ashamed that these things are happening. But, on the other 
hand, I also say: Please be fair in judging the FRG on these 
issues. We have learned a lesson from what has happened; we 
have provided an enormous amount of humanitarian aid and effort 
to make good the damage; we have taken 400,000 refugees from the 
former Yugoslavia, more than double the number that the other 
European countries have taken; and we have exceptionally liberal 
legislation, including Article 16 of the Basic Law. Please be 
fair in judging Germany, I tell my colleagues. Above all, I tell 
them that it is one thing when the state condones or tolerates 
violations of human rights, and quite another thing when a 
liberal law-governed country like ours is not in a position to 
prevent individual occurrences of such an evil nature. We are 
doing all that we can to overcome the problem, but unfortunately 
we have not succeeded, I say. 
  [Siegloch] Another two questions before our surprise guest. 
What is your greatest foreign policy concern? That the 
situation in Russia becomes uncontrollable? 
  [Kinkel] I will reply from a somewhat broader angle. I 
think the central task of German foreign policy in the coming 
years will be to lead the transforming countries of Central and 
East Europe to our Europe on a political, economic, and security 
level. 
  [Bresser] That will isolate Russia even more. 
  [Kinkel] Naturally, in this context, the Russian question 
plays quite a decisive role. We must not dig new trenches. 
This enormous area, 50 times the size of Germany, with a 
population of 150 million, and still the second largest nuclear 
power, must not be neglected. It must be included in all the 
new structural planning. That is the great task facing German 
foreign policy since unification and since the end of the 
East-West confrontation. [passage omitted] 
  [Bresser] The last quarter hour of our program is dedicated 
to the surprise guest. Mr. Kinkel does not know who is going to 
come, but he knows him very well. Both men were proteges of 
Hans-Dietrich Genscher, but the man who is now joining us left 
the FDP in 1982, subsequently joined the SPD, and has meanwhile 
even become federal party manager, thus being Rudolf Scharping's 
first campaign manager. Welcome, Mr. Guenther Verheugen. You 
were in the FDP for 22 years, and have now been a member of the 
SPD for 12 years. Please ask questions of your former 
colleague, who is now a political opponent of yours. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Verheugen] After the attacks in Luebeck [against the 
synagogue] and what happened afterward, you pointed to the 
effects this spreading violent radicalism was having abroad. I 
think you used the word devastating. 
  [Kinkel] Yes. 
  [Verheugen] I share your view, and I think it was right of 
you to have said that. I think you were criticized for it by 
others. The question now is whether you think there is something 
the democratic parties could do together to stop these radical 
right-wing activities from spreading. You probably know I 
proposed that the democratic parties should take joint action 
against rallies of right-wing radicals. I have not yet received 
an answer from you and, unfortunately, received a negative one 
from the CDU/CSU. 
  [Kinkel] Wait a second. I fully agree with you. When we 
discussed the issue in the Executive Committee -- I am surprised 
that you did not get our answer -- I immediately said that I 
fully support your proposal. Absolutely and fully. 
  [Verheugen] This is an important point for me. I would like 
to explain to our viewers what we are talking about. We are 
talking about the fact that, whenever the Republikaner stage a 
major rally, the FDP, the Greens, and the SPD are ready to hold 
democratic rallies at the same time but in a different place to 
prevent violent scenes at the location of the Republikaner 
rallies, scenes that are familiar to us and that led to your 
judgment that such outrages had a devastating effect abroad. 
  [Kinkel] The FDP is ready to support your proposal without 
reservation. 
  [Siegloch] Gentlemen, you have now found one issue on which 
you agree. Still, this was not yet the beginning of coalition 
talks. It was a conversation with a moderate tone, not exactly 
a dispute, but I think the exchange of arguments has been 
informative. Thank you very much, and good night.

  [Text] Hamburg, Germany, May 25 (AFP) -- President-elect 
Roman Herzog has called for a "head-on fight" against the 
extreme right in Germany by the organs of the state, in an 
interview to appear Thursday [26 May]. 
  "It is above all a question of the police and legal 
authorities," Herzog, who is currently chief judge of the 
Federal Constitutional Court and was chosen Monday [23 May] as 
the next head of state, told the weekly DIE WOCHE. 
  Asked whether he believed extreme right parties and groups 
should be outlawed, he replied: "Yes, when the facts are such 
that one can be sure of upholding the case in the courts." 
  Herzog said he could not imagine neo-Nazi theories 
flourishing in Germany. "What worries me much more is that the 
crypto-Nazis, the old incorrigibles, should find an appeal and 
imitators among the younger generation." 
  Herzog, who takes office July 1, was criticised for not 
having dealt with the problem of mounting extreme right-wing 
violence in Germany in his acceptance speech Monday evening 
following his election. 
  In the DIE WOCHE interview, the president-elect called for 
determined resistance against any development on the lines of 
that in Italy to bring neo-fascist parties into government. 
  He saw no immediate danger of this, but said "the highest 
vigilance" was demanded. 
  Herzog spoke out against the revival of German nationalist 
ideas, which he believed could "no longer be a driving force for 
our people" today and which struck no chord in him personally. 
  He also dismissed the idea that reunited Germany need no 
longer feel concerned about its Nazi past. 
  Herzog did "not feel emphasis should primarily be laid upon 
past responsibility, but on what we can learn for the future", 
which for him meant "a particular need to develop barriers 
against totalitarianism". 
  "We must be ready in the future to draw conclusions from the 
atrocities of the extermination of the Jews and other 
minorities. I can for that reason absolutely not adopt this 
notion that the postwar period has ended," he said.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "No All-Clear Sounding"] </F>
  [Text] The good news first: In 1993, the number of arson 
and bomb attacks fell by 41 percent compared to the previous 
year. Nevertheless, the figures that have been now released by 
the Federal Office of Criminal Investigations [BKA] are anything 
but comforting. In a confidential study, the Wiesbaden-based 
BKA talks of a reduction "on a high level." 
  With 540 politically motivated attacks, 1993 was once again 
closer to the figures for 1991 (537 attacks) following the 
horrific year 1992 (901 attacks). A return to the reasonable 
levels of 1990, which saw "only" 128 violent attacks of this 
kind cannot be expected for the time being, say the 
criminologists. 
  The most serious crimes were committed by right-wing and 
left-wing extremists: On 29 May 1993, four young neo-Nazis set 
fire to the home of a large Turkish family in Solingen, causing 
two deaths and serious injuries to eight of the occupants. Two 
months before that, early in the morning of 27 March, the new 
Hesse prison in Wieterstadt, which cost 130 million German marks 
to build, was blown up by members of the RAF [Red Army Faction]. 
  According to BKA findings, extremist right-wing motives 
(both 
acts aimed directly at left-wing groupings and various acts 
involving hostility toward foreigners) were behind 300 of the 
540 attacks. This means that attacks carried out by right-wing 
extremists are still the main problem. 
  The extremist left carried out 150 arson and bomb attacks. 
Their targets were political opponents, the police, the state, 
and the bourgeoisie. 
  The left-wing arsonists stronghold is Berlin. In the capital 
city alone, "antifascists" and "anticapitalists" carried out 69 
attacks as part of campaigns, such as that directed against 
"Olympia 2000." The BKA has identified a further large group of 
arsonists and bombers among radical foreigners. 
  Of the 90 attacks carried out in 1993 by radical foreigners, 
the majority can be attributed to Kurds linked to the PKK 
[Workers Party of Kurdistan]. The potential for "politically 
motivated crimes committed by foreigners" remained the same as 
in 1992. 
  There was a significant decline in the number of criminal 
acts motivated by animosity toward foreigners. In new laender 
above all, the number of attacks fell by 75 percent. 
  The greatest praise was earned by the Thuringians, who were 
the most peaceful, followed by Saarland and Bavaria.

  [Text] The Defense Ministry in Bonn wants to ease the 
strict German arms control restrictions. A Defense Ministry 
strategy document envisages founding a European agency to make 
future decisions on all arms exports. 
  [Correspondent C. Meincke] The detour via Europe is intended 
to open up new sales markets for German arms products. The 
confidential Defense Ministry strategy document for the planned 
European arms agency says that the project would only make sense 
if national restrictions were lifted. However, this would also 
involve an amendment to the Maastricht Treaty, which lays down 
that production of and trade in war materiel are governed by 
national laws. Thus, in the future the agency alone should make 
decisions on arms deals. This would mean for example that the 
loose French restrictions could also be applied to Germany. 
  Since the military strategists are aware of the reluctance 
of 
the British to enter into such close cooperation, they want to 
found a small club of determined partners, which will include 
above all France. The Defense Ministry predicts that trade 
being carried out through the arms agency would cost many jobs. 
This price would however have to be paid, since in free 
competition, the highly efficient German arms industry as a 
whole would probably emerge as a net profit-maker.

  [Text] The Defense Ministry has admitted having 
incorrectly informed parliament about the procurement of the 
"Cerberus/TSPJ" Tornado defense system and problems in the 
development of the top-secret jammer and repeater jammer. 
Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) developed the project, which costs 
more than 700 million German marks [DM], with the Israeli arms 
firm Elta. "As a result of imprecise descriptions of the 
situation, it was possible at times to give the impression" that 
there is "no firm contract" beyond the delivery of the first 
series of 60 devices, the Defense Ministry admits in a 
confidential "situation note." However, what is correct is 
"that from the very beginning, there has been a commitment to 
buy 110 system units from the Israeli side." 
  Social Democratic Party Deputy Horst Jungmann in the past 
has 
criticized innumerable inconsistencies in the procurement and 
accused the ministry of "deliberate deception." However, there 
is still no end to the tricks. While the approval of another 50 
devices has so far been made dependent on "proof of their 
effectiveness in troop tests," now one only speaks of 
"integrated company and official tests" in test labs, even 
though in the budget the military pushed through a DM1-million 
test stand for testing Cerberus in the troops.

<F P=106> [Report by Michael J. Inacker: "Signal From Karlsruhe for </F>
Bundeswehr Missions Abroad"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- In the future, the Bundeswehr will be able 
to participate in international missions abroad without any 
restrictions. According to information obtained by WELT AM 
SONNTAG, it is expected that the Federal Constitutional Court 
will approve the participation of German armed forces in 
peacekeeping and peacemaking (combat) missions. 
  This assessment is based on findings by legal experts close 
to the Constitutional Court. A corresponding decision is 
expected in late June. 
  According to information obtained by WELT AM SONNTAG, this 
assessment is derived from an analysis of the course of the 
hearing at the Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe to date and the 
questions by the judges in the hearings on 19 and 20 April on 
the complaints by the Social Democratic Party [SPD] and Free 
Democratic Party Bundestag groups against German participation 
in the monitoring of the UN embargo against Serbia, the AWACS 
monitoring of the Yugoslav airspace, and the now concluded 
German Somalia mission. It is said that the way in which the 
hearings are conducted by the constitutional judges permits the 
conclusion that the issue no longer is whether a future German 
participation should be permitted, but only procedural questions. 
  The lawsuit is pending at the Second Panel of the 
Constitutional Court, to which two SPD members belong -- namely 
former Berlin Justice Senator Jutta Limbach as president and 
legal expert Ernst-Wolfgang Boeckenfoerde. 
  The juridical assessment of the expected ruling, which was 
also conveyed to the Federal Government, is based on the 
following factors: 
  -- The Constitutional Court dealt only briefly with the 
question whether the contents of the Basic Law generally permit 
Bundeswehr missions. 
  -- In contrast, the questions asked by the constitutional 
judges during the hearings on 19 and 20 April dealt almost 
exclusively with mere procedural issues. Thus, it was discussed 
heatedly whether the Federal Government can decide on a foreign 
mission on its own or whether it requires approval by the 
parliament. In particular concerning the requirement of 
approval, the court did extensive historical research on the 
development of the Basic Law in order to be able to make 
deductions about the need of parliamentary decisions for foreign 
policy actions by the state ("parliamentary reservation"). 
  However, since, as legal experts say, parliamentary 
reservations exist only for things that are basically permitted 
by the constitution, during the hearing the Constitutional Court 
obviously no longer discussed the legality of a state act as 
such but only the form of authorization. Therefore, it is to be 
assumed that, in the view of the Karlsruhe court, the Bundeswehr 
may participate in UN combat missions abroad. 
  In Bonn, however, it is expected that in its ruling, the 
Constitutional Court will set down some sort of "parliamentary 
reservation" for Bundeswehr missions abroad. 
  This reservation will probably not be a two-thirds majority, 
because this would endanger the ability of the respective 
government majority to act, but only an absolute majority, the 
so-called chancellor's majority. According to information 
obtained by WELT AM SONNTAG, conservative Social Democrats would 
welcome such a ruling by Karlsruhe, because this is the only way 
they see to change their own party's decision against UN combat 
missions.

<F P=106> [Article by Hans-Joachim Noack: "Ritchie--Each One Half of </F>
Him: About the Rivals, Roman Herzog and Johannes Rau"] 
  [Text] Ever since he has been seeking the office of federal 
president, a somewhat bizarre self-description has been attached 
to candidate Roman Herzog. It deals with single-cell organisms, 
so-called protozoa. 
  Such a minute thing, explained the chief of the Karlsruhe 
Federal Constitutional Court some time ago in conversation with 
Richard von Weizsaecker, reminds him of his career planning: "It 
lies quietly in the water; but if something happens to swim by, 
it will eat it if it appeals." 
  This crass punch line, resulting from Herzog's love of 
mockery, amused the German head of state, but evidently it also 
was food for thought for the nobleman who attaches importance to 
seriousness. At least the top jurist believes "that after this 
remark, the president is not so sure about me." He suspects his 
party friend of having leaked the remark to the press. 
  His opponent, Johannes Rau, learned of it via TV, and he is 
also mulling it over. Although the Social Democratic competitor 
for the move to Berlin's Bellevue castle avoids derogatory 
statements about the Christian Unionist, the "strange remark" 
does surprise him a bit. 
  The North Rhine-Westphalian head of government does not 
necessarily wish to question his rival's fitness for office. But 
it is "difficult to understand," as he says in his favorite 
Wuppertal pub, the general kind of feeling and thinking which 
might be concealed behind this comparison: Is a man of 
reputation allowed to make it so easy on himself? 
  These doubts are probably strengthened by the considerable 
devotion with which the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] 
representative pursues his goal. Apparently cool to the core, 
Professor Dr Roman Herzog, 60, talks his candidacy down to an 
"attractive possibility;" Johannes Rau, three years older, lives 
and suffers it. 
  Never before in the republic's presidential elections has a 
candidate more openly presented his claim than does the 
minister-president from Duesseldorf. He considers himself the 
man with the necessary power of integration ("I have the gift of 
bringing people together"), and the great majority of Germans 
sees it the same way. 
  For weeks now, hardly a day passes that Rau is not planting 
these virtues in their heads in interviews (or even at 
riflemen's festivals or boat christenings). "I want to be it," 
he summarizes his dream in the simplest sentence possible, then 
underpins it with polling figures: One only has to think of the 
numbers which the pollsters with great regularity have at the 
ready. 
  The yearning Social Democrat speaks of the "clear signals 
that also reach me;" he is inspired by the force of 
autosuggestion to which he submits gladly. Can the Federal 
Assembly really dare to "pass by" such facts? In the end, 
"perhaps the moving van will yet come," he says hopefully at a 
spring festival which his local SPD club of Katernberg is 
celebrating. 
  But this confidence is soon followed by a distressing drop 
in 
mood. He quietly laments the "cemented majority conditions" 
among the delegates. The candidate realizes that the ideas of 
the people and of people's representatives unfortunately do not 
coincide. 
  He may be especially upset by the supposed callousness with 
which the favored rival, Roman Herzog, seems to accept his big 
chance. But the widespread impression, that the rustic Bavarian 
in this competition plays only the role of an almost indifferent 
stoic, is not correct. 
  Like Johannes Rau, whose tough battle for approval by the 
electors goes much further than what his Bonn party headquarters 
is doing, in truth the Christian Democrat also strains mightily. 
The protozoa metaphor and other self-complacent utterances at 
best give information on the specific behavioral technique of 
the portly jurist. 
  Even the conservative FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE believed that 
Herzog only pretends "a certain friendly indifference," after 
the Union had just dropped its Steffen Heitmann. Perhaps 
frustration--that its political favorite had been shot 
down--flowed into this harsh portrait, but the newspaper is not 
all that far off: For years, the second choice of the CDU/CSU 
[Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union] for a 
successor to Richard von Weizsaecker has always felt himself to 
be really the first choice. 
  It is not a chief constitutional judge living in the 
Karlsruhe ivory tower who now vies for the highest office in the 
country, but a sturdy homo politicus. He knows the world and its 
wiles--and above all the laws of a media democracy. Numerous 
homey stories are proof of that. For BILD-ZEITUNG ("Washing 
dishes relaxes me wonderfully"), the master of the house even 
has himself photographed at the kitchen sink. 
  What does it matter that he reaches into the pile of dirty 
plates in a snow-white shirt and starched cuffs: The performance 
fulfills the purpose of presenting to the insufficiently 
informed public a high performer in the form of a simple, 
average citizen. 
  From the standpoint of psychological condition, he deals in 
a 
much livelier fashion with his candidacy than the more tired, 
formerly merry drinker of Pils [beer] and teller of anecdotes 
from North Rhine-Westphalia. And he also says it: If "Rau is 
certainly more popular," he "who for years had been parked in 
Karlsruhe, is probably less used up." 
  So a duel has developed subtly, in which the different 
personality images have acquired a certain importance--but the 
alternatives as to substance much less so. Just as the two 
embattled people's parties are beginning to resemble each other 
more and more, their candidates for the presidential office 
overall represent the same objectives. 
  In the case of "Brother Johannes," the son of a Pietist 
preacher, this transborder impetus is almost a characteristic. 
The 1987 candidate for the chancellorship, under the motto 
"reconciliation instead of division," cannot help himself. Again 
he sees himself as an "offering for all." 
  Roman Herzog's trend toward the political center, on the 
other hand, derives from somewhat more profane drives. Sent to 
Bonn as undersecretary by Rhineland-Palatinate 
Minister-President Helmut Kohl over two decades ago, the former 
university president initially proved to be a strongly 
conservative careerist. Later as interior minister in the 
Baden-Wuerttemberg cabinet of Lothar Spaeth, he tried to subdue 
the peace movement with riot control gas. 
  But times have changed. The societal counterforce, in the 
fall of 1983 holding out in front of the Mutlangen missile site, 
has decamped--and the roughneck from Stuttgart has learned his 
lesson. Meanwhile, the basic attitude of the Federal 
Constitutional Court's president is considered 
bourgeois-liberal, albeit not immune to relapses into rigid 
law-and-order thinking. 
  So what choice is there? Are not both--as could be heard 
regretfully here and there at the beginning of their 
candidacy--protagonists of the old FRG that passed away? Does 
the gentle Social Democrat perhaps warm the heart a little more, 
while the Christian Unionist offers himself more as the man for 
everyday life that has become grayer? 
  The office of federal president is "something so singular," 
candidate Johannes Rau points out, that basically there is only 
one question: "Who is the right one for the next 2,000 days?" 
  Thus speaks the public favorite who knows his worth. 
Encouraged by pollsters, he would like to free the decision from 
the tangled mass of tactical dodges and superficial powerplays. 
The North Rhine-Westphalian government head insinuates that, if 
things are aboveboard, the answer is practically obvious. 
  That is also the reason why he abstains from substantive 
pronouncements. Why should he "artificially puff himself up" and 
proclaim political guidelines which everyone already knows? The 
old diehard who, after all, has won an absolute majority three 
times in the republic's most populated land, believes he has 
made a sufficient impression. 
  And moreover: For many years, has he not embodied those 
characteristics which the fathers of the constitution had in 
mind when they created this office so limited in power? Even in 
hours of doubt, it makes him happy to see this confirmed. "What 
is needed," says Rau in a strange mixture of humility and pride, 
"is the bonding power which I have." 
  For the time being, Roman Herzog refrains from circulating 
such self-certainties. Naturally, he also sees the essence of 
his possible future job in working for a communal spirit--but 
somehow with less ardor. There will be days, the judge 
phantasizes drily about the work, in which he will live in the 
situation of an improviser: "What's coming up? What are you 
going to do next week?" 
  Since the beginning of the complicated nomination procedure, 
the Christian Democrat has demonstrated his inclination toward 
self-reliance. He is his own man who will no longer move into 
Villa Hammerschmidt [in Bonn], but wants to represent the new 
Germany in Berlin. 
  The Bavarian from Landshut drawn toward charismatic types, 
sees Italian Sandro Pertini as his model. Just as he, a 
socialist with patriarchal bearing, demonstrated fearlessness in 
the early 1980's, so Herzog, with conservative values, will "hit 
hard if necessary." He proves it impressively when he now, 
without many scruples, rejects dual citizenship. 
  Is this just a sterner version of populism with which he 
confronts Rau's subtler stance? Or, to give it a positive spin: 
Sometimes it appears as if the two potential heirs of Richard 
von Weizsaecker ("Ritchie") personified his virtues, each one 
half. The "red" candidate likes himself in the role of patron 
and paterfamilias who values consensus above all else; the 
"black" candidate loves the aura of the contrary, salutary 
troublemaker from whom not even the chancellor may feel safe. 
  The Duesseldorf head of government eyes this part of his 
rival with the distrust of the political professional polished 
over decades. In his cautious manner, he says that he has "a 
little bit the feeling that the Herzog program is called Herzog" 
-- in his opinion, a daring ego trip. Will he be able to last 
long in the fragile power structure into which the 
constitutional organ of the federal presidency is fitted? 
  But then he also has other moments. Still grappling with the 
fact that he quit school before getting the junior high school 
diploma, self-taught Rau is plagued by noticeable inferiority 
complexes. They force him into tendential behavior anxiously 
rooted in norms. A "German professor" (Herzog on Herzog) is 
hardly burdened by that. 
  But the Social Democrat is yet too perceptive not to know 
about the reverse side of his public assessment. "He's nice, a 
good Skat player, but offers nothing of substance...an amiable 
nonscorer," he bravely summarizes the list of critical remarks. 
  Naturally, he is hurt by such accusations. It has never been 
his business "to pour the gravy of harmony over everything"--and 
he immediately offers an example of something that certainly 
cannot be reconciled: "American Fruit and the banana pickers!" 
the minister president says emotionally. But fortunately, such 
contrasts no longer exist in our country. 
  Thus he reaches energetically into faraway worlds, while the 
situation at home worries him only conditionally. Whether the 
candidate speaks about genetic technology or nuclear energy, the 
role of the Bundeswehr or the republic within the global 
scale--he is always concerned with a possibly balanced position, 
anchored "between curse and blessing." 
  His rival Roman Herzog, accused of "liberal 
unpredictability" 
by such as Edmund Stoiber, dares to go further. Inclined toward 
intervention, he thinks out loud about this and that, supports 
plebiscites, or advocates a limit on speed. "In politics," he 
demands grumpily, one must "speak in much plainer terms." 
  This creates the impression that the highest German judge, 
in 
case he is elected, might turn to `res publica' more 
directly--an advantage of the more vigorous temperament. For 
within the scope of their understanding of the state and 
society, the rivals differ only in minor details. 
  Roman Herzog ("I am a totally undramatic person") might use 
more of a shirt-sleeve approach with his fellow citizens than 
fine-boned Rau. The Bavarian thinks the fight over the holiday 
to be sacrificed for nursing care insurance is "simply 
laughable." And he wants to be able to say that, even as federal 
president. 
  The amateur historian trained himself in this provocative 
poise through a weakness for historical dimensions, developed 
early on. Contemporary man, by immersing himself in the wide 
spaces of the respective epochs, learns to calm down--a feeling 
which he cultivates. The Protestant likes to relax in one of his 
favorite places, the Speyer cathedral. There lie the bones of 
Emperor Henry IV, highly esteemed by him; the emperor who went 
to Canossa. 
  Roman Herzog, the highly regarded jurist, at the head of his 
class since early youth--but Roman Herzog also in the pose of 
one who no longer has to prove it to himself: At age 13, he 
taught Latin to his father, an employee in a snuff factory and 
later director of a museum; at his riper age, the constitutional 
judge after work sits relaxed in front of his TV, watching 
commercials. TV chief inspector Derrick is also welcome in his 
living room. 
  In part it is the simple, archaic rules of life from which 
the coauthor of the famous Basic Law commentary, 
"Maunz-Duerig-Herzog," derives his orientation. The author 
headlined his "General Political Science" (1971) with a sentence 
from the fairy tale, Rumpelstiltskin: "I am fonder of something 
living than of all the treasures of the world!" 
  However, some of Herzog's general rules--such as his maxim, 
"Help yourself and God will help you"--bespeak a rather 
rough-and-ready pragmatism permeating even questions of faith. 
Thereby the Christian party man probably moves closer to an 
increasingly secularized country than the pious Social Democrat. 
  For Rau is certain that "this world is not living in doom: 
There comes something else"--a confidence which he does not 
associate with any work of man. That at least is demanded by the 
strict Lutheran who still sets the course within him. 
  But faith can make one strong. The mild revivalist as SPD 
functionary has managed to pursue his own cause all the more 
purposefully. He has always been determined to conquer leading 
party and government offices through embattled candidacies, if 
necessary. All these years, the former publishing house 
bookseller and journalist has been fascinated by the "political 
figure of the mayor." 
  That he also counts a head of government in this category, 
as 
its crowning point as it were, explains the remarkable 
steadfastness in his present political engagement. As one of the 
closest companions of "citizen president" Gustav Heinemann, to 
whose second-oldest granddaughter, Christina Delius, Rau is 
married, he feels himself additionally predestined. 
  Thus he would be willing to leave his beloved Wuppertal for 
the job of "citizen king" (DIE WOCHE)--and even more: For the 
sake of the desired honor, the SPD vice chairman revealed 
himself last fall as an astute tactician. "One must stabilize 
Heitmann," the candidate urged among his circle of comrades. A 
transparent trick to increase his own chances. 
  All in vain, since it now becomes painfully clearer to him 
that his career "is linked to Kohl's fate?" Up to these last 
days, Johannes Rau refuses to accept in his heart the probable 
defeat. 
  But no matter whether "the mayor" or the "catalyst" (a 
definition of Herzog) will gain the upper hand this coming 
Monday [23 May]: The seventh federal president for the first 
time in the history of the republic will be a so-called 
`later-born.' The two top candidates experienced World War 
II--which has again entered the collective consciousness in the 
fourth year of the reunited country--as children. 
  Little Johannes, 12 at that time, learned from his father, 
returned from the Soviet Union, about the atrocities by the 
Nazis, while the even younger Roman saw the catastrophe with his 
own eyes: "An endless line of concentration camp prisoners were 
marched by our house." And both experiences still have their 
effect. 
  Thus one of the most convincing assets in the political 
balance sheet of Social Democrat Rau is his tireless effort for 
reconciliation with the Jews. Because of this engagement, the 
University of Haifa bestowed on him an honorary doctorate, and 
since then he has been highly welcome, and not only in Israel. 
The much-quoted "fisher of men" is one of those who gained 
respect abroad as the "good Germans." 
  Roman Herzog is finding it more difficult when the past is 
concerned. He had been education minister under the former naval 
judge, Hans Karl Filbinger, and for years served as assistant to 
public law specialist Theodor Maunz--a jurist until his old age 
incorrigibly tied to the new Nazis. 
  How does he feel about that? Did nothing ever strike him 
when 
his father's friend, under whom he did his doctoral work, 
maintained closest contacts with Gerhard Frey's German People's 
Union? 
  Well, that's how it is, "...noticed nothing," says the 
presidential candidate and mutters a low "perverse" between 
clenched teeth; and that is all. To have to talk about the 
behavior of his colleagues in the Third Reich (and afterwards) 
annoys him visibly. 
  Does this reflect the stoicism of Roman Herzog who would 
rather pursue the larger perception, anyway? He simply likes 
"broken personalities"--those of yesterday and today. 
  The Christian party man with the cool attitude overall wants 
"not to get carried away." What will happen, he asks through a 
cloud of his cigarillo, if contrary to expectations he is not 
elected on 23 May? "Neither Rau nor I can ruin the country."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Izetbegovic Meets With Leaders of </F>
RPR-UDF and PSF Lists"] 
  [Text] Dominique Baudis and Michel Rocard, the leaders of 
the two main lists of candidates for the European elections who 
had talks with Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic yesterday, 
stood by their positions on the arms embargo on Bosnia. It is 
known that Izetbegovic has come to Paris at the invitation of 
philosopher and writer Bernard-Henri Levy, who is presenting a 
list called "Europe Begins at Sarajevo" in the elections. 
  Dominique Baudis (UDF-RPR [French Democratic Union-Rally for 
the Republic] majority) stressed the risks of lifting the 
embargo, while Socialist Michel Rocard expressed the view that 
it is the ultimate means of pressure in view of the UN 
"paralysis." 
  "I noted a series of proposals which I will submit to Prime 
Minister Balladur and Foreign Minister Juppe in the next few 
hours," Mr. Baudis said after meeting with Izetbegovic for 
almost one hour. Expressing the view that there were 
"opportunities for speeding up the peace process rather than the 
war," he said he understands "the Bosnian president's concern to 
achieve a balance of forces on the ground." "At present," he 
said, "there is an imbalance in favor of the Serbs and to the 
detriment of the Bosnians." 
<H5>  UN Resolutions </H5>
  Judging the desire to restore a balance of forces to be 
"legitimate," Baudis saw two ways of achieving it: a reduction 
in the level of armaments of the Serbs, or arms supplies to the 
Bosnians. The first [as published] option, he added, "presents 
risks of the fighting intensifying with hundreds of thousands 
more people being killed, and the fighting spreading to the 
whole Balkan region and perhaps elsewhere in Europe. There is a 
different solution," Mr. Baudis said, which consists not in 
supplying arms to the Bosnians but in "ensuring the 
implementation of the UN resolutions which involve the 
withdrawal of Serbian heavy weapons from Bosnia. I advocate the 
solution which kills least people. I prefer to see weapons 
leaving Bosnia rather than new weapons arriving there. Fewer 
weapons means fewer victims," Mr. Baudis said. 
  Mr. Rocard, for his part, said it was necessary for "the 
United Nations to implement its own resolutions and use force. 
If that does not happen," he added, "it becomes vital to allow 
the Bosnians the right to defend themselves, in other words to 
lift the embargo." He termed a question on the link between his 
stance and the European elections "insulting." 
  Brice Lalonde had a telephone conversation with the Bosnian 
president while he was holding a political meeting near les 
Saintes- Maries-de-la-Mer. According to the leader of Ecology 
Generation, "Mr. Izetbegovic knows what support we have been 
giving him for two years." 
  Yesterday, Bernard-Henri Levy said he and his friends 
planned 
to officially submit their list by the closing date of 27 May, 
"unless there is a major development -- in other words either a 
change in government policy, which must take a stance against 
the partition of Bosnia, or a major parliamentary initiative." 
According to Mr. Schwartzenberg, Izetbegovic said he was 
satisfied with the position taken by Michel Rocard, who 
"understands" the situation.

<F P=106> [Report by Annette Levy-Willard: "Izetbegovic Urges Lifting </F>
of Embargo"] 
  [Excerpt] Why did Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic 
decide to stop in Paris on Sunday evening [22 May] on his way 
back from Riyadh, where he had been on pilgrimage to Mecca? "To 
see Bernard-Henri Levy's film "Bosnia!" in which he plays an 
important role," the president's advisers consistently argue in 
order to maintain the fiction of a "private nonpolitical visit." 
  It was therefore vital for the Bosnian president to go and 
see the film, despite the late hour. So, at around 2230, when 
the Saudi plane landed at le Bourget Airport, Alija Izetbegovic, 
accompanied by the Bosnian ambassador to France, climbed into 
one of the cars placed at his disposal by the official visits 
department, crossed Paris as if it was a Le Mans race, with 
motorcycle outriders and flashing lights, and went to the 
Haute-Feuille cinema, in the Latin Quarter, where Paris' Bosnian 
community was waiting for him. 
  At the end of the film, President Izetbegovic stood up and 
addressed his compatriots in Serbo-Croat. "People have heard a 
great deal said about Bosnia," he said, "but it is much more 
important to see than to hear. This film is a very powerful 
documentary which will stir up consciences in France and abroad. 
You have just seen a painful truth but the film does not show us 
as victims. It shows the resistance of our people caught 
between the grip of Croatian fascism and Serbian fascism." 
  The Bosnian president then drew up an optimistic picture of 
the military situation on the ground: "We are now stronger and 
they are weaker. I have just visited the front lines and I 
noticed a strange strength there. Our people cannot be 
defeated. Faced with the dilemma of `fighting or dying,' we 
have chosen to live." 
  Condemning the Western countries which "intervened to impose 
an embargo on arms for Bosnia," Alija Izetbegovic is now asking 
them to stop intervening: "Let us fight," he cried. "The Serbs 
have not succeeded in turning us into criminals like them. Does 
this mean we will forgive them one day? No, we will never 
forgive what they have done to our women and children." The 
crowd in the cinema gave a long standing ovation to the 
president and philosopher Bernard-Henri Levy. 
  At the Raphael Hotel in Paris on Monday morning, the real 
purpose of the Bosnian president's flash visit to Paris could no 
longer be concealed: To give support to the campaign of the 
intellectuals, who will present a list called "Europe Begins at 
Sarajevo" in the European elections. Izetbegovic came to try to 
convince the French that the embargo should be lifted and the 
partition of Bosnia rejected. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Paris, May 24 (AFP) -- Some 68 percent of French 
people would favour French military intervention on behalf of 
Bosnia's Moslem-led government, but only in the framework of a 
joint U.S.-European operation, an opinion poll revealed Tuesday 
[24 May]. 
  Were France to take such an initiative on its own, 77 
percent 
of people would oppose it, according to a survey by the polling 
institute IFOP for publication in Wednesday's Globe-Hebdo 
magazine. 
  In all, 29 percent of 974 people questioned in the telephone 
poll said they opposed French intervention even as part of a 
joint operation. 
  If "the Europeans and Americans refused" to intervene in the 
conflict, 20 percent of those questioned said they would favour 
action by France alone. 
  A "solidarity train" was meanwhile to leave Paris for Zagreb 
stacked with packages for refugee camps in former Yugoslavia, in 
an initiative by the French humanitarian association 
Europa/l'Odyssee, reports said. 
  The Paris-Zagreb solidarity train, an idea backed by the 
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural 
Organisation, will leave Paris on June 18 and make stops in 
Geneva and Milan before arriving in Zagreb the following day. 
  During the journey, doctors, psychiatrists and humanitarian 
officials will debate the trauma of war and the "art of living 
in peace," organizers said.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "European Election Opinion Poll: </F>
Baudis at 32 Percent, Rocard at 19 Percent"] 
  [Text] According to a Louis Harris poll commissioned by LE 
JOURNAL DE DIMANCHE, the UDF-RPR [French Democratic Union-Rally 
for the Republic] election list headed by Dominique Baudis would 
win 32 percent of votes cast, down by 3.5 points. In the 
previous Louis Harris poll, Dominique Baudis' list had been 
given 35.5 percent of voting intentions. Michel Rocard's 
Socialist list has risen two points to 19 percent (from 17 
percent). Bernard Tapie's MRG [Movement of the Radical Left] 
has risen one point to 10 percent (from 9 percent), while 
Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front has risen one-half point to 
also stand at 10 percent. Next come Philippe de Villiers' 
"Other Europe" list and the PCF [French Communist Party] list of 
Francois Wurtz with 7 percent. They are followed by [former 
Defense Minister] Jean-Pierre Chevenement's "Alternative Policy" 
list, whose score remains unchanged at 4.5 percent. Brice 
Lalonde's Ecology Generation list also remains stable at 3.5 
percent, ahead of its ecologist rival, the Greens, led by 
Marie-Ann Isler-Beguin, which is down two points from 4 to 2 
percent. This poll was carried out by telephone on 19 May using 
a national sample of 1,013 people.

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Francois Leotard signed </F>
"mnk" and "hon"; place and date not given: "In Future Crises, 
the United Nations Should Rely on Organizations Such as NATO"] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [CESKY DENIK] France is 
pursuing an active policy in Bosnia-Hercegovina. Your country 
has dispatched the largest military contingent within the 
framework of the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force]. What is your 
assessment of the presence of French units in the former 
Yugoslavia from the point of view of French interests in the 
Balkans? 
  [Leotard] From the beginning, France has been pursuing a 
policy of active presence in the former Yugoslavia. This 
involvement seems natural to us: As President Mitterrand has 
said, what is happening in the former Yugoslavia "concerns us." 
The people of the former Yugoslavia are our neighbors and their 
problems -- ethnic, social -- concern Europe. 
  The stability of this complex Balkan region will partially 
depend on the outcome that this conflict will eventually cause. 
Therefore, the crisis merits not only our attention, but also 
our active involvement. This concern compels the French 
Government toward constant diplomatic efforts, the aim of which 
is a balanced and lasting peace settlement. 
  Nevertheless, the presence of French units in Bosnia and 
Croatia is not only linked to French interests in the Balkans: 
The mission of the blue helmets in Bosnia is, first and 
foremost, a humanitarian mission (accompanying convoys, 
providing an air bridge, dropping food and medicines from 
aircraft, removing mines, and renewing public services). 
  France could not stand ildly when confronted with the urgent 
needs of such a suffering people and, therefore, our military 
contingents are involved fully in these humanitarian missions, 
which always carry some risk. 
  [CESKY DENIK] At the moment, it seems that the NATO 
ultimatum 
in Sarajevo has been crowned in success. In your opinion, is it 
at all possible to supervise militarily the observance of other 
possible protection zones? 
  [Leotard] It is certainly possible to supervise militarily 
adherence to these ultimatums. This has been made clear, 
especially in Sarajevo, where the UNPROFOR units and military 
observers have not only been overseeing adherence to the 
agreement, but -- on the other hand -- have also been bringing 
the city to life. 
  This supervision, however, requires a large military 
presence. Whereas the United Nations requested 10,500 troops to 
guarantee adherence to the agreements -- which is the bare 
minimum -- the international community could only react by 
making an offer corresponding to half this number. France has 
800 more men here. Under these circumstances, the United Nations 
must work with the numbers it has at its disposal and must 
expend a great deal of effort in providing for the most pressing 
needs. 
  [CESKY DENIK] Mr. Minister, do you think that the West made 
a 
mistake in its policy toward the former Yugoslavia? 
  [Leotard] The activity of western countries in the former 
Yugoslavia could seem hesitant or put off for too long. When 
the effects of the ultimatum are considered, the question of why 
it was not made sooner is often asked. We would have made it if 
the situation earlier had met with political will, as was the 
case in February. 
  It is impossible to forget that this activity is being 
carried out within the framework of the United Nations, which is 
responsible politically for the entire operation in the former 
Yugoslavia. 
  The countries involved in Bosnia and Croatia have fulfilled 
the mandate, a mandate that was again determined by specific 
options. 
  The West's international and military organizations (the 
European Union [EU], NATO, and the Western European Union [WEU]) 
do not have to be ashamed of their activity. Seven EU members 
have troops in the former Yugoslavia, all the others are 
providing aid, sometimes considerable aid, and they are 
accepting numerous refugees. As far as the West's diplomatic 
activity is concerned, it has been conducted particularly 
forcefully with the aim of finding a real solution to long-term 
problems. 
  [CESKY DENIK] Do you think that international organizations 
like NATO or the United Nations have a chance -- following their 
experiences in Somalia and now in Bosnia -- of resolving local 
conflicts in the future? 
  [Leotard] We have to learn from the major crises of the past 
two or three years. The UN operations in Cambodia, Somalia, and 
Bosnia -- although very different -- suggest that blue helmet 
missions should, in the future, intervene closer to open 
conflicts or local clashes rather than merely uphold the 
traditional role of supervising the suspension of hostilities. 
  Then, within this framework, the international community 
must 
formulate clear political aims and the feasibility of 
supervising directly the command of the military forces in the 
area of their deployment. Undoubtedly, an important 
prerequisite for this is to ensure that, next time, the United 
Nations or the CSCE rely on the resources of military 
organizations such as NATO or the WEU, which have the 
possibility of intervening with maximum efficacy. I emphasize 
this point, for experience from Bosnia has shown us that there 
is no purely military way out of such complicated conflicts.

    [Editorial Report] Paris France-Inter Radio Network in 
French at 0620 GMT on 25 May carries a 10-minute, recorded 
interview with Defense Minister Francois Leotard by Arnette 
Ardisson. The interview is described as taking place following 
the debate on the military program in the National Assembly; the 
date and place are not given. 
  Discussing the point of holding the debate, Leotard notes 
that they are making plans for the future, and though it is 
unspectacular, the long-term is the most important thing. 
Leotard says he and Prime Minister Balladur respect the 
constitution, and the debate goes beyond party political issues. 
There is a broad consensus. 
  Ardisson asks whether Leotard would prefer unanimity in the 
assembly on the defense program, even if the Socialists insist 
the Baumel amendment on the resumption of nuclear tests is 
defeated as a price for their support. Leotard responds: "I 
think that when unanimity is artificial, it is deceptive. I am 
not looking for unanimity. We are proposing this bill, and we 
shall have this amendment." Leotard is then asked whether he 
hopes the amendment will be withdrawn. He replies: "In itself, 
it isn't an obstacle or provocative. Not at all. It says more 
or less the same thing as the president is saying, as the prime 
minister and I are saying -- namely, that at the right time we 
shall have to hold tests again. But that isn't the main thing 
in the bill. Let me remind you that we devote twice as much 
money to conventional weaponry as we do to nuclear arms. Twice 
as much. And that really is something new; we should stress 
that." Leotard goes on to say that he does hope the amendment 
is withdrawn "because it doesn't add anything, and it doesn't 
come into the area of the law. You know, the assembly more and 
more passes laws on issues that are outside its competence. This 
should be an administrative procedure. Tests really fall under 
administrative procedures -- in other words, an executive 
decision. But it is proper and good that we should talk about 
them. As far as I am concerned, as I told the assembly, I have 
provided for the necessary allocations to enable the head of 
state, today's or tomorrow's, if he deems it necessary -- and he 
is the one who has to deem it necessary -- to decide to resume 
or not to resume. My duty is to prepare the tool, to see that 
it is possible. But it is up to the president to decide -- 
today's or tomorrow's. Today's has already responded." 
  Leotard then defends French defense spending by invoking 
France's history of being invaded and its commitments abroad -- 
with 200,000 French nationals in sub-Saharan Africa and 11 
million sq. km of ocean to defend. There are 70,000 soldiers 
currently outside metropolitan France. He recalls the lesson 
learned in 1940, when the French Army found itself up against a 
modern army. 
  Ardisson asks if Leotard meant what he said about reducing 
French troops in Bosnia. Leotard answers: "I can tell you that 
what I said is exactly the case. You'll see -- I'll be only too 
glad to come and talk to you at the at the end of the year -- 
the numbers and intentions I have announced will be implemented. 
It is a French decision, corresponding to the way the crisis is 
developing: We are going to reduce our forces in Bosnia, and we 
shall regroup them in Sarajevo. This is a fact, it's a decision 
we have made, and that's it."

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Antonio Martino by Alberto </F>
Flores D'Arcais during flight from Rome to Washington on 23 may: 
"Dear Allies, Now We Want To Carry More Weight"] 
  [Excerpt] Washington -- [passage omitted] [Flores D'Arcais] 
What will you tell Secretary of State Christopher? How will 
relations between Italy and the United States change? 
  [Martino] I do not think they will change, and I can assure 
you there will be no change in our essential options. As far as 
Italy's Atlantic policy is concerned, let me say right away that 
above all there will be continuity; in fact I am convinced that 
this policy can be carried forward with substantial opposition 
support. I have already had an opportunity to discus this with 
opposition representatives. 
  [Flores D'Arcais] Two pressing problems: Bosnia and 
relations with the United Nations. What changes are there with 
respect to the past? 
  [Martino] Let me give you a specific example right away: 
Bosnia. Our position is clear-cut: Italy must be involved in 
decisionmaking processes from the outset; we cannot accept our 
exclusion. For geographical and also military reasons, Italy 
has a substantial interest in Bosnia. 
  [Flores D'Arcais] But we have been excluded from the 
"contact 
group" in the peace negotiations, which is comprised of the 
United States, Russia, Germany, France, and Britain. 
  [Martino] Our exclusion is unacceptable. 
  [Flores D'Arcais] Will you request admission to the "contact 
group"? 
  [Martino] Yes, I will state clearly that our country must be 
a member. 
  [Flores D'Arcais] Are you in favor of sending Italian Blue 
Helmets to Bosnia? 
  [Martino] I am not opposed to it, on the following 
conditions: 1) that Italy take part in the decisionmaking 
process; 2) that it takes place as a UN initiative and under 
NATO military command; 3) that it genuinely be a peacekeeping 
operation; 4) that the aim of the operation be observance of an 
agreement accepted by all the sides involved and that the 
presence there be confined to the absolute minimum necessary. I 
say this because I believe that adventurism in foreign policy is 
very dangerous. 
  [Flores D'Arcais] Croatian President Tudjman has reaffirmed 
his anxieties about border issues. 
  [Martino] And I reaffirm our position: We are not raising 
any issues about borders; let them remain as they are. We have 
no intention of regarding treaties as mere pieces of paper. 
What we do have are some bilateral problems, and we will deal 
with them. 
  [Flores D'Arcais] What are these problems? 
  [Martino] For instance, property, the possibility of 
purchasing real estate, and freedom of movement. 
  [Flores D'Arcais] Will you reconsider the Osimo Treaty? 
  [Martino] The Treaty will be observed; in fact some parts of 
it have yet to be implemented. If there are any points that 
need to be reconsidered, we will deal with them. 
  [Flores D'Arcais] When people accuse you of being 
"anti-Europeanist" you reply it is inconceivable that the son of 
Gaetano Martino could be opposed to European ideals. However, 
on some points of the Maastricht Treaty -- the single currency, 
for instance -- you disagree with the previous government's 
policies. So what is your vision of Europe? 
  [Martino] It seems to me that the Community made the mistake 
that people often make when they buy a computer. First they buy 
one, then they decide what to do with it. I think that you must 
first think what you want to do and then choose the means, 
define a program. Recently in Europe we have wondered in an 
abstract fashion which are the best institutions, and only 
afterward decided what to do with them. 
  [Flores D'Arcais] What would you like to do with the 
European 
"computer?" 
  [Martino] I would proceed from an obvious observation. A 
political institution justifies its existence on the basis of 
objectives that cannot be achieved equally effectively at 
another level of government. We have a national government with 
national objectives. Then we have Europe, which has objectives 
that cannot be pursued at the national level. 
  [Flores D'Arcais] What are these objectives? 
  [Martino] They are few, but of huge importance. The first is 
political: We must have a European foreign policy. Not in 
order to return to the old concept of European civilization, but 
in order to grant Europe a common voice. Also, we need a joint 
European defense; we must not delude ourselves that the United 
States will always take care of defending us. Of course, there 
are also economic objectives. The first -- which has been 
almost completely achieved, and whose importance is 
underestimated -- is the single market, which is a European 
asset. We cannot allow national states the possibility of 
impeding the free exchange of goods. 
  [Flores D'Arcais] Is this the point over which you differ 
most from the so-called "Eurobureaucrats?" 
  [Martino] Keep in mind that this is not a purely economic 
thing and that economic liberalism alone will not guarantee 
peace. However, the maxim "where goods do not pass, armies pass" 
applies, and it is a fact that when countries communicate more, 
there are fewer conflicts. Let me quote to you something some 
one else said: "Trade unites, politics divides." 
  [Flores D'Arcais] So are you opposed to any kind of 
intervention in the markets? 
  [Martino] Yes, because if we grant Brussels the ability to 
intervene, we will then have various "milk wars," because prices 
must be determined by the market, not by a centralized 
bureaucracy at the European level. Let me give you an example: 
There is a Community directive that even states how large the 
pea in a whistle should be. 
  [Flores D'Arcais] Is it true that you have in mind a 
Rome-London axis to set against the European policy of France 
and Germany? 
  [Martino] No, that is not the right way to consider the 
matter. I believe in the enlargement of Europe because I think 
that, just as we can no longer talk about a West Germany, it no 
longer makes any sense to talk about a West Europe -- either 
politically or economically. 
  [Flores D'Arcais] Would you open Europe's doors to the 
countries of the East, too? 
  [Martino] Yes, if we want to give the countries of the East 
the chance of opening up their markets, this is necessary. If 
we close our doors to them, we will force them into an economic 
stagnation that could lead to serious political difficulties. 
  [Flores D'Arcais] Does this include an opening up to Russia? 
  [Martino] In the future, yes. Above all, we must not give 
any of those countries the impression that anything is being 
done against anyone else. Of course, the liberalization of the 
markets of the East could in some instances disadvantage some 
industrial groups to the benefit of others. However, until 
those countries produce as much as they can, they will never 
develop. 
  [Flores D'Arcais] The next appointment is in Corfu. Will 
there be an Italian candidate for the presidency of the European 
Commission? 
  [Martino] No, partly because after 10 years of French 
presidency, we do not think that another Mediterranean 
presidency is possible. There are several candidates... 
  [Flores D'Arcais] Will you support [Leon] Brittan? 
  [Martino] We have not yet decided; we are discussing it. 
What we want is a greater and more incisive Italian presence in 
the various international bodies. For instance, the elimination 
of the deputy chairmanship of the European Bank of Research and 
Development is a blow to countries such as Italy which are major 
shareholders in the Bank. 
  [Flores D'Arcais] The Middle East: In the past Italy has 
been accused of having an excessively pro-Arab policy. 
  [Martino] I hope that the present situation will lead to a 
genuine peace. We must not criminalize anyone, and we must also 
avoid condemning the Islamic world. 
  [Flores D'Arcais] Will you be going to Israel? 
  [Martino] Yes, soon, and I would also like to visit Cairo. 
  [Flores D'Arcais] The presence of neo-fascist ministers 
worries Jerusalem in particular. 
  [Martino] I have already explained that the National 
Alliance 
minister belongs to a center government. The new electoral 
rules led to the formation of an alliance that opposed a 
left-wing bloc. Many people abroad have understood this, too. 
The major criticisms come from countries where there is an 
internal problem -- France, Belgium, sometimes Germany. 
  [Flores D'Arcais] Do you too accuse the press of having 
whipped up a campaign? 
  [Martino] What I think is that since the European elections 
are about to take place on 12 June, the presence of National 
Alliance ministers is being manipulated for domestic political 
ends. Furthermore, while the French press has been very 
critical, in other countries such as Britain or even the United 
States -- with the exception of the NEW YORK TIMES -- things 
have been different. 
  [Flores D'Arcais] What seems to worry the Americans more 
than 
this is the issue of the separation of powers. In other words, 
the Berlusconi problem. 
  [Martino] As a liberal, I have always believed that the 
greatest danger comes from concentration of power. But I do not 
think there is a problem with [Prime Minister] Berlusconi. If 
he had wanted to enter politics for the sake of his own vested 
interests, he would not have submitted himself to so much public 
exposure. Now the slightest suspicion that a decision made 
within the government sphere could benefit his private interests 
would whip up both the press and the opposition. As an 
economist, I believe that everyone must behave in accordance 
with his own interests. It is in Berlusconi's interest to 
behave extremely carefully, not to give rise to any suspicions.

  [Text] "This Italian government will be the most 
pro-Israeli in the past 20 years". These were the words with 
which Foreign Minister Antonio Martino who is currently visiting 
Washington, sought to reassure the Jewish-American community. 
  At the next G-7 meeting Martino will ask for condemnation of 
"the ongoing Arab economic boycott of Israel." 
  Martino met earlier with U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher, who said "he has a lot of faith in the government 
that resulted from the elections: we are ready to work together."

<F P=106> [Article by Umberto Brindani: "Behold Bobo: The Secret of </F>
Roberto Maroni"] 
  [Text] He is a true believer of the 
boss, a moderate, and a skilled negotiator, but there is still 
another reason for the rise of the Northern League's number 
two--one that is never mentioned. 
  "And for interior minister: Maroni," Umberto Bossi mumbled. 
"Maroni who?" the PANORAMA correspondent asked. "How do you 
spell it?" Bossi, annoyed, spelled it for him. "He is a lawyer 
from Varese and is my friend." "What is his first name?" the 
correspondent asked. "Roberto." 
  It was in late November 1991. Giulio Andreotti was prime 
minister, Vicenzo Scotti was interior minister, the DC 
[Christian Democratic Party] was still in existence, and Achille 
Occhetto headed the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left]. It was a 
century ago; the newspapers were still writing "the Leagues," 
and the real League--Bossi's League--had a total of one deputy 
and one senator: Bossi himself. In his little office in Rome, 
the boss agreed to play the role of "shadow prime minister" and 
rattled off the list of hypothetical cabinet ministers: Speroni 
for foreign affairs, Formentini for economy, Ms. Pivetti for 
immigration, Miglio for institutional reforms. It was only in 
fun, because the threshold of power seemed so far away. The 
reality is that now, two and one-half years and 178 members of 
Parliament later, it is easy to verify that Bossi was wrong 
regarding his own list. Except for one person on the list: the 
self-styled "lawyer" from Lozza, a town of 900 souls located a 
stone's throw from Varese. 
  Maroni is not a lawyer; he only has a law degree. 
Nonetheless, he is the new interior minister--a fact that needs 
to be emphasized, because it is one of those things--such as 
Fiorello being the idol of the masses or Nelson Mandela the 
president of South Africa--that is hard to believe. Since 
Wednesday 11 May, Roberto "Bobo" Maroni, 39, is married to Emi 
Macchi, has two small children, is a former employee of Avon 
Cosmetics, and is also an amateur bluesman [preceding word in 
English] and (to hear him tell it) a good soccer player--has 
been the chief at Palazzo Viminale, the ministry that has the 
secrets and the dossiers as well as 4,215 officials, 208 
prefects, and 150,000 employees (including 100,000 police). 
  No one therefore any longer ridicules, in the manner of Mino 
Martinazzoli, Maroni's scatological nickname. No one any longer 
asks, "Maroni who?" The complete "color" commentary on his 
personality has by now appeared in the political columns: his 
passion for the Hammond organ in the Distretto 51 band 
[preceding word in English] (13 members, and a rhythm and blues 
[preceding three words in English] repertoire ranging from 
Wilson Pickett to Otis Redding); the sax, in the manner of Bill 
Clinton; and the mini Olympics with his old friends from Varese. 
Maroni's political biography has also been extensively reported: 
the student marches in his youth ("But I never got into 
trouble"); his votes for Proletarian Democracy; the founding of 
Radio Varese (originally the voice of the local Left, today the 
voice of the League); the momentous meeting with Bossi in 1979; 
the memorable fiasco of the little local-dialect newspaper NORD 
OVEST (three issues, 20 copies sold); his election to the Varese 
municipal council in 1990; his election to the Chamber of 
Deputies in 1992, in which he received 30,000 votes; and his 
experience as League caucus leader in the Chamber. 
  Paradoxical as it may seem, the Maroni of the past two or 
three years is precisely the Maroni who is least well-known. But 
how in the world did this "pudgy little League fellow"--the 
gentle and likeable Bobo of the impossible negotiations (with 
Occhetto, with Mario Segni)--manage to land the one cabinet post 
that in Italy ranks second in importance only to Silvio 
Berlusconi's? Bossi wanted him there of course, to some extent 
because of his gifts of equilibrium and moderation, and to a 
great extent because of his unshakable loyalty to the boss's 
directives. But there is a secret reason for the irresistible 
rise of the "saxophone man," and a culprit as well: the press. 
  Many League leaders, encouraged by the supreme leader, have 
always harbored a dislike, verging on hatred, of newspapers and 
journalists that is unrestrained, self-confident, and almost 
ontological. Talking to the "hacks of the regime" was a sin; at 
most, you were allowed to make an occasional sarcastic remark in 
their presence. Give them an interview? Fine, but they are not 
to be trusted. The League's press secretaries served as a 
barrier to protect the boss [preceding word in English]. And as 
for its spokespersons, of what use are their statements if Bossi 
changes his mind from one day to the next? 
  But Maroni was different. As a little boy he perhaps wanted 
to be an astronaut or big league soccer player, but assuredly 
not interior minister. He knows how to play the "advocate" in 
writing (as demonstrated by the brilliant "Lombard diaries," 
published in PANORAMA). And he has a talent that is not found 
among League supporters as a whole and is perhaps a legacy of 
his leftist activism: self-ridicule, which enables him to view 
the League's menacing slogans objectively. As a result, this 
right-hand man of Bossi always enjoyed a privileged relationship 
with journalists. He spoke to the "hacks" and in return clearly 
enjoyed a growing popularity with them. All they had to do was 
dial 0337 et cetera, and he answered. He responded to them 
(without going too far); preached the Bossi doctrine; and kept 
his appointments. 
  Any journalist who has covered the League in recent years 
remembers a Maroni dressed in jeans [preceding word in English], 
preferably white; a wrinkled jacket; dreadful multicolored ties; 
and a portable phone ("My battery doesn't last long"). If you 
ran into him at the Varese city hall or in the Chamber of 
Deputies offices, he always appeared to be there by chance ("See 
what I have to do"). And at the great League festivals, 
congresses, meetings, and swearing-in ceremonies--whether he was 
there for work or pleasure--he always spent the night in the 
company of the "specialized" journalists, speculating about the 
mystery that surrounded the lineups in the 1961-62 soccer 
championships. 
  All this effort and approachability have obviously borne 
fruit in terms of image, but if that image had depended, for 
example, on the period of Maroni's activity in Varese as 
councilman in charge of road construction and maintenance, one 
would have had to shudder at the thought of his becoming 
interior minister. 
  Should the road through the Sacro Monte be closed to 
traffic? 
Maroni asks the advice of his newspaper friends, who supply him 
with a dozen ecological intellectual slogans [preceding word in 
English] of the "Breathe your mountain" type." He thanks them, 
thinks it over, and after a week comes up with this Lombard 
populist opinion: "The mountain is respected if you take the 
shuttle." 
  And there is more. In Maroni's city they tell this version 
of 
the old story of the "rotating" one-way streets. Hardly had the 
new municipal council taken office in early 1993 when it became 
necessary to reduce the levels of pollution and traffic. The new 
one-way directions were adopted, and the merchants were furious. 
Maroni adopted a posture of goodwill and agreed to meet with 
them--one at a time and one per evening--and promised each one 
that he would systematize the solution. Because Maroni is 
someone who keeps his promises, he really changed the one-way 
streets--changed them every morning, because every evening he 
was confronted by a merchant who had been angered by the changes 
made that morning. 
  The story may have been somewhat embroidered by an envious 
fellow resident, but that is "Bobo's" philosophy: Be careful not 
to displease anyone, even if it means contradicting yourself. In 
February he proclaimed: "None of the proposed cabinets includes 
any elected officials from the AN [National Alliance]. That will 
absolutely never be," and we know what happened. Two years ago 
he in fact told PANORAMA: "With someone like me as interior 
minister, all of Italy's skeletons of the past 20 years, from 
Piazza Fontana to Ustica, will be jumping out of the closets." 
Poor fellow, not even he believed it at the time. Let us hope 
this time he will have the courage not to contradict 
himself--even if he has to displease someone.

<F P=106> [Article by Giampiero Mughini: "The Volcanic Diplomat"] </F>
  [Text] Because the cabinet is an administrative structure 
that should have the balance and raw efficiency of a soccer 
team, it is surprising that a post involving intrigue and high 
diplomacy would be entrusted to a macho type whose specialty is 
smashing the adversary's defenses, to wit: my dear friend 
Giuliano Ferrara, the minister for relations with Parliament. 
  Things will be difficult this time for Big Giulio. The man 
who likes to shake up political relationships will have the task 
of managing and civilizing relations between parties and 
factions. The man who likes to put down any sacrilegious 
individual who opposes him will have to learn how to convince 
that individual gently. The man who has preached the need for a 
charismatic leader endowed with full powers will have to learn 
the art of stroking one of the most tumultuous parliaments of 
West Europe. 
  If Silvio Berlusconi did indeed place this kind of man in 
the 
wrong job, it was probably because he did not want to miss the 
opportunity to have at his side a man trained in politics and 
its techniques--training that is not possessed by many new 
cabinet ministers. 
  Giuliano is accordingly returning in person to the front 
line 
of politics, which was the passion of his youth. It was also the 
passion of his family, starting with his grandfather Mario--a 
prominent Liberal of the 1920's--and followed by his father 
Maurizio, who was one of the most volcanic and partisan 
Communist journalists in the 1950's and 1960's before becoming a 
Liberal and "rightist" Communist in the 1980's. And then there 
is his uncle Giovanni (Maurizio's brother), a Republican, who is 
certainly not the least factious member of the family. Factious, 
in the sense of a total and disruptive passion for your side 
once you have chosen that side. It is a kind of passion that 
does not allow for halfway measures or modulated tones and 
indeed demands that the scimitar mercilessly cut off hands and 
heads. That is the way Giuliano is. 
  I remember Giuliano in 1981, just after he had resigned as 
secretary of the PCI [Italian Communist Party] federation of 
Turin because he was tired of communist politics in general and 
the Piedmont PCI in particular. He had no job and no money. He 
would stroll through Piazza Navona with his handsome German 
shepherd and his close friend Giampaolo Pansa at his side. His 
friendship with Pansa subsequently ended with threats of a punch 
on the nose, just as his friendship with Saverio Vertone, one of 
his two buddies in Turin (the other was Vittorio Sermonti), 
ended in a bruising brawl. And just as I had been having 
dinner with Giuliano and Carlo Ripa of Meana--a dinner among 
friends--only a few days before the two were flaying each other 
in public with lawsuits and countersuits. I love Giuliano like a 
brother, but I know that if our views ever diverged, he would 
let the scimitar fall upon my head mercilessly. This is partly 
the product of the Communist modus operandi, one that is never 
abandoned, and partly a manifestation of the curse of the 
Ferraras. 
  Giuliano's intellectual bravado is something else again. It 
is the pridefulness of someone who does not want to row with the 
crew, and I was very pleased at the tenacity with which Giuliano 
continued to defend Bettino Craxi after Craxi had fallen into 
disgrace. As for Ferrara's independence, I recall the time when 
he proclaimed openly on British radio his disagreement with 
Craxi, who had just signed--together with Achille Occhetto--a 
document deploring the American bombs that had killed civilians 
in Iraq. To be sure, bombs are horrible and do kill innocent 
people; but the person responsible for those deaths was Saddam 
Hussayn, who had aimed his chemical missiles at Israel before 
the UN decided to take action against him. What did the 
complaint against the Americans have to do with this? And 
Giuliano said just that, boldly, his big beard pointing to the 
sky, indifferent to the curses of the pacifists. I phoned him 
immediately to congratulate him.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Solbes: `EU Is Mistaken in Its </F>
Economic Analysis for Spain'"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- Spanish Economy Minister Pedro Solbes 
Monday [16 May] described as pessimistic the economic forecasts 
for 1994 and 1995 made by the European Commission. The European 
commissioner for finance -- Denmark's Henning Christophersen -- 
presented these forecasts to the economic and finance ministers 
of the European Union [EU] yesterday. The Community's executive 
forecasts economic growth in the EU of 1.6 percent for 1994 and 
2.5 percent for 1995. 
  Solbes told the press that "Spain fundamentally disagrees 
with the European Commission with respect to economic growth, 
reduction of the public deficit, and inflation," and that this 
opinion is shared by the rest of the Twelve. 
  Christophersen estimated that Spain will have GDP growth of 
1.1 percent in 1994 and 2.3 percent in 1995, a public deficit of 
7.2 percent (1994) and 6.6 percent (1995), and an inflation rate 
of 4.8 percent this year and 4.6 percent next year. 
<H5>  1.3 Percent Still Stands </H5>
  However, the Spanish Government stands by its growth 
forecast 
of 1.3 percent for this year and between 2.3 percent and 2.6 
percent for 1995. 
  The Community's forecasts for Spain contrast with the 
optimism of the country's leading financial circles, most of 
which have revised upward their forecasts for that indicator. 
  Solbes stated that for the present the Spanish Government 
knows only the estimates issued by the Bank of Spain, and is 
awaiting the results of the national audit for the first quarter. 
  The atmosphere of economic confidence has developed in Spain 
since the provisional results for the first quarter -- which 
show that the economy grew by 0.5 percent of GDP over the first 
period of the previous year -- became known. 
  The improvement is attributed to the strong growth in 
exports, but also to a slight improvement in domestic demand. 
The Spanish minister insisted that the Commission is also 
mistaken about inflation, in setting a percentage of 4.8 percent 
for Spain, with "so emphatic an assertion that prices are not 
falling in Spain." 
  The Spanish economic authorities forecast an inflation rate 
of 4.2 percent for this year. 
  The Spanish minister maintained that "this assertion is just 
a half-truth," because underlying inflation (which does not 
include food) is falling, and wages are performing better this 
year than in the previous year. 
  Solbes specified that food prices performed very poorly in 
1993, owing mainly to the devaluation of the peseta. 
  With respect to the public deficit, the commissioner 
believes 
that Spain will end 1994 with a deficit of 7.2 percent of GDP, 
while the government forecasts 6.4 percent. 
  "This figure is quite realistic, because Social Security has 
performed better than expected. To talk about 7.2 percent makes 
no sense," Solbes said, rejecting the Commission's argument that 
the autonomous communities' enormous deficit will have a 
negative impact on the overall average. 
<H5>  Agreement on Employment </H5>
  The only point of agreement between Christophersen and 
Solbes 
concerns the unemployment figures, since they both agree that 
they will be around 22.3 percent over the next two years. 
  The Spanish minister did not rule out Spain's being able to 
create jobs with an economic growth rate of around 1.5 percent 
of GDP. 
  He pointed out that "it is possible in theory, although 
hitherto Spain has been unable to do so because of the 
rigidities of the labor market, now modified by the labor 
reform." 
  In order to revive the Community's economy, he emphasized 
that it is necessary to continue to lower long-term interest 
rates, and he even mentioned the possibility of Europe's 
departing from the U.S. model with regard to increasing interest 
rates, "because otherwise economic growth and recovery will be 
curbed."

<F P=106> [FINSKA NOTISBYRAN report: "We Must Be Self-Reliant"] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto (Center Party) 
thinks that Finns must have self-confidence if our country is to 
do well as a member of the European Union [EU]. At the Center 
Party's Europe seminar in Helsinki on Saturday [21 May] Haavisto 
said that we have to build up enough national self-confidence in 
order to be able to promote our objectives even after we become 
a member of the EU. 
  "That is what our influence is dependent on in the final 
analysis, at both the individual and national levels," Haavisto 
said. 
  According to Haavisto, EU membership would give Finland a 
new 
framework for activities in the field of foreign policy. 
Membership would increase Finnish influence and scope for 
action. He stressed that as a member Finland can pursue an 
active policy in pursuit of its own national objectives. 
According to Haavisto, in the future too the central objective 
for Finland is the strengthening of stability and security in 
northern Europe. 
  Haavisto reminded his audience that the EU countries' common 
foreign and security policy also brings with it obligations. On 
the other hand, Finland can expect solidarity from the other EU 
members at the same time as we ourselves will be able to take a 
constructive part in the EU's activities. 
  "Finland has much to contribute to the development of the 
EU's future policy. As far as the EU's relations with Russian 
and the Baltic region are concerned much is expected of Finland." 
  In a speech in Oulu later in the day Haavisto stressed the 
importance of information in the lead-up to the referendum. He 
called for information about both the negative and positive 
effects of EU membership. 
  "Only an open debate, in which we respect the right to put 
forward arguments both for and against membership, will produce 
an acceptable referendum result. Whatever the result is, it 
must not be allowed to divide our people. We Finns need 
unanimity to succeed both inside and outside the EU," Haavisto 
stressed. 
  On the eve of one of the most important decisions in 
Finland's era of independence we must have a clear view of the 
issues. 
  "The political and economic decisionmakers in Finland must 
prepare themselves for membership by building greater national 
consensus," Haavisto said.

    [Editorial Report] Shortly after returning from Brussels as 
part of the Foreign Ministry team that negotiated Finland's 
accession agreement with the European Union [EU], Esa Harmala 
was elected chairman of an occupational association that has 
publicly expressed concern about the livelihood of its 
constituency under the EU, the Farmers and Forestry Owners' 
Association (MTK). Harmala, 39 and a forest owner, had gained 
recognition as MTK's trade policy chief prior to 1991, when 
Prime Minister Esko Aho appointed him chief economic adviser. 
When negotiations began with Brussels, Aho asked him to move to 
the Foreign Ministry post. Though widely applauded in the press 
for his efforts in Brussels as the negotiator in charge of 
agricultural issues and enjoying the support of Aho and his 
farmer-oriented Center Party, Harmala's narrow margin of victory 
(37-33) over active farmer and Center Party MP Juha Korkeaoja on 
28 April was attributed by Helsinki's two leading dailies 
(HELSINGIN SANOMAT and HUFVUDSTADSBLADET editions of 29 April 
1994) to be largely due to controversy surrounding his Brussels 
role. Many MTK board members blamed Harmala for helping forge an 
agreement that will result in lower producer prices and farm 
incomes, and may eventually force them off the land. Although 
voting in the leadership board was by secret ballot, in comments 
before and after the balloting, many Harmala supporters 
emphasized they did not want their vote for him interpreted as 
supporting EU membership, according to HUFVUDSTADSBLADET 
reporter Inger Blomqvist. 
  Following approval of the entry document by the European 
Parliament on 2 May, Finnish opponents and proponents are now 
organizing for the membership referendum campaign. While the 
government has not yet set the date for the referendum, it is 
expected to be held in late September or early October, leaving 
Harmala, who will not assume his new office until late June, 
very little time to heal wounds and unify the MTK before the 
vote. 
  The mood in MTK, according to the HUFVUDSTADSBLADET article, 
is perhaps the bleakest in the history of the 80-year-old 
organization. In April last year, Prime Minister Esko Aho 
appointed then MTK Chairman Heikki Haavisto as foreign minister. 
Haavisto had served as chief of the MTK since 1976, and like 
Korkeaoja, had been a farmer, gaining great popularity among his 
constituency as a farmers' champion. As in choosing Harmala, Aho 
picked Haavisto as part of his overall strategy for overcoming 
resistance from the powerful agricultural lobby. Haavisto was 
deemed best able to assuage the powerful farmer and 
food-processing sectors while directing Finland's entry bid 
(HUFVUDSTADSBLADET editorial, 16 April 1993). While food 
industry leaders have indicated that most of their objections 
have been overcome (HUFVUDSTADSBLADET, 14 April 1994) many 
farmers -- especially those in the colder and more remote north 
-- still feel doubly betrayed with Harmala's victory, having had 
their demands for a special "Arctic Agriculture" arrangement 
largely rejected (HELSINGIN SANOMAT, 23 February 1994). 
  In the hour-long prevote discussion, Harmala said he 
understood that many farmers blamed him personally for negative 
provisions in the entry document, especially the lack of a 
"transition" regime toward open trade. At the election meeting, 
Harmala pleaded that his role as a Foreign Ministry official was 
to get the best deal possible for Finland as well as for the 
farmers, and that as their new chairman he would put their 
interests above all else (HUFVUDSTADSBLADET, 29 April 1994). He 
also reiterated the current MTK posture of delaying definitive 
announcement on the membership referendum until the details of 
the accession agreement are made clear, asserting that some of 
the provisions are "subject to interpretation." According to an 
editorial in the HELSINGIN SANOMAT of 29 April 1994, this delay 
is a clear sign that even though the entry document has been 
published and the European Parliament has given its sanction, 
the MTK may still have difficulty formulating a position 
acceptable to its membership.

  [Text] Oslo, May 25 (AFP) -- A top level Norwegian Foreign 
Ministry advisor on the Middle East was asked to become UN 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's deputy, the Foreign 
Ministry said here Wednesday [25 May]. 
  Foreign Ministry spokesman Ingvar Havnen said Butrus-Ghali 
requested Monday that Terje Roed Larsen become his deputy on 
Middle Eastern issues. 
  "Mr. Butrus-Ghali contacted us last night about this offer 
and the Norwegian government expresses its support for Larsen's 
candidacy," Havnen said. 
  Larsen, 47, has accepted the offer, the Norwegian new agency 
NTB reported from Washington. 
  He was scheduled to meet Wednesday with officials at UN 
headquarters in New York, Havnen said. 
  "We see this as a recognition of the Norwegian Government's 
role in the peace process in the Middle East," he added. 
  Larsen is head of the Oslo-based Institute of Applied Social 
Sciences, which was instrumental in setting up the first secret 
meetings between Israeli and the PLO in Norway in 1993. 
  The meetings led to the accord signed September, 13, 1993, 
granting Palestinians limited autonomy in the occupied 
territories. 
  Larsen, a sociologist, was advisor on Middle East issues to 
the late Foreign Minister Johan Joergen [Holst], one of the 
architects of the accord. 
  He is currently advisor to Larsen's successor, Bjoern Tore 
Godal.

<F P=106> [Article by Thomas Michelsen: "Committee on Constitution </F>
Grills Bildt on Balts and Volvo" -- introductory paragraph in 
boldface as published] 
  [Excerpt] What might Sweden do if the independence of 
the Baltic states was threatened again? Will we stay neutral or 
will we actively support our neighboring countries, as we did 
during Finland's Winter War? There was tough debate on those 
issues when Prime Minister Carl Bildt was questioned by the 
Committee on the Constitution on Tuesday [26 April]. 
  The starting point was a speech delivered by Bildt at the 
Foreign Policy Institute in November of last year. Kurt Ove 
Johansson (Social Democratic Party) felt that in that speech, 
the prime minister had restricted Sweden's freedom of action and 
even aroused dangerous hopes in the Baltic states. Bildt had 
aroused expectations in our vicinity that we would not be 
neutral if there were a war. 
  And above all, Kurt Ove Johansson questioned the way in 
which 
the prime minister's attention-getting speech had been prepared. 
Had Bildt consulted the rest of the government or the opposition 
parties represented on the Riksdag's Foreign Affairs Committee? 
<H5>  "Signal" </H5>
  Bildt answered that the purpose of the speech was to send a 
signal to Red-Brown revanchists in the East. And the positions 
expressed were not new: The prime minister had expressed the 
same policy in several previous speeches and articles. 
  "I hope that the European Union [EU] will react if the 
independence of the Balts is threatened. That might involve 
economic sanctions. And things like that can in no way be linked 
to strict neutrality under international law," the prime 
minister said. 
  "But what does the prime minister mean by active Swedish 
support for the Baltic states if there is a Russian invasion?" 
Johansson asked. He pointed out that 8,000 Swedish soldiers had 
participated in Finland's Winter War using weapons from Swedish 
military stores as well as aircraft. 
  "We will provide political support. That may mean 
sanctions," 
Bildt answered. "We must not let ourselves be forced to betray 
our neighbors again, as we did in 1940. But exactly what we will 
do must be decided when the time comes." 
<H5>  Heated Debate </H5>
  Kurt Ove Johansson did not think there was any popular 
support in Sweden for abandoning neutrality. In a recent public 
opinion poll, over 80 percent said they thought we should keep 
our neutrality. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Swedish News Agency article: "Clear Majority for No to EU"] </F>
  [Text] There is a clear majority against the European Union 
[EU] if the referendum were held today. This is shown by a 
survey done by IMU-Testologen. Of those questioned, 40 percent 
would vote no, 33 percent would vote yes, while 27 are unsure 
how they would vote. The survey was carried out in April at the 
request of the newspaper ARBETET. 
  Compared with an equivalent survey done in February, EU 
opponents have increased by 2 percent while the number of 
proponents declined by 1 percent. These changes do, however, 
lie within the statistical margin of error. 
  If the respondents are divided according to party sympathy, 
a 
clear change is noticed. Within the nonsocialist bloc (not 
including New Democracy), the number of yes voters has increased 
from 51 percent in February to 57 percent in April. In the 
socialist bloc the number of yes voters has decreased from 25 
percent to 21. 
  The number of opponents is about the same on both sides, 20 
percent among the nonsocialists and 21 among the socialists. 
Therefore the number of undecided voters is significantly larger 
on the socialist side. 
  Of those who voted for the EU, 21 percent thought the 
statement "Sweden should not be isolated" was decisive in their 
choice. For 18 percent the statement "necessary for export" was 
decisive, and for 17 percent the statement "serves peace in 
Europe" was. 
  Among the no voters, 33 percent thought that the statement 
"the consequences are not sufficiently determined" was decisive, 
while 24 percent said "open borders cause problems with drugs 
and violence" and 23 percent said "poorer quality of foodstuffs" 
were the most important motives. 
  The survey included 1,012 people.

<F P=106> [Article by Ewa Stenberg: "Christian Democrats Heading </F>
Toward 30th Anniversary Crisis"] 
  [Text] Now that the Christian Democratic Party (KDS) has 
grown up and become established it is time for its 30th 
anniversary crisis. When the party celebrates its anniversary 
tomorrow, it will be a profile-seeking group that gathers for 
the festivities. 
  The Christian Democrats' 30th anniversary crisis is not that 
different from those of other 30-year-olds. After being in the 
opposition and refusing to conform to established patterns, they 
are now quite settled, generally accepted, and more conservative 
than they were shortly after they began their career climb and 
are beginning to consider what the cost has been. Has the color 
faded and the soul gone out of the party? 
  For the KDS the crisis has been striking. From being an 
antiestablishment opposition party that refused to conform to 
the bloc system and asserted its own Christian dimension in 
politics, the KDS has become an established and responsible 
government party. 
<H5>  Silence Not Good </H5>
  "The KDS may have paid a little too much attention to 
stability and a good climate of cooperation in the government. 
The strategy of silence is not a political strategy, we will win 
no elections on that basis," said Riksdag member Ingvar 
Svensson, KDS party strategist and a member of the party's 
executive committee for 28 years. 
  "We should have sat in the Riksdag for three or four years 
before we entered a government coalition. That would have 
enabled the voters to see our policies for a period of time 
before we were forced to make all these compromises," said Nina 
Ekelund, who is vice chairman of the Christian Democratic Youth 
League, KDU, and a cabinet office adviser. 
  But the party's low profile was in part its own choice. To 
entice many general nonsocialist voters, the KDS needs to tone 
down its Christian profile -- cut the pious veneer, as Svensson 
put it. But when the party does this and wins the support of 
general nonsocialists voters, those who form the party's hard 
core do not really feel at home. 
  The KDS is also criticized by member groups that are 
attracted by the radical aspects of the party's message on 
solidarity with weaker and impoverished countries, trusteeship, 
and a good environment. 
  Ekelund belongs to this group, and it disturbs her that the 
KDS is increasingly toning down its radical profile to maximize 
the number of votes it gets from general nonsocialist voters. 
  "The KDS should stress the party's environmental and 
distribution policies as well as equality between women and men. 
We should be able to pursue the demand for a state policy on 
equal wages for women and men, for example," Ekelund said. 
<H5>  Ethics and Morality </H5>
  The KDS started out as a party of conservative values, and 
its political core is the defense of the family and Christian 
ethics and morality. In addition to this core the party acquired 
a radical economic policy and an environmental policy in the 
1970's and early 1980's. 
  Since the mid-1980's the party has changed course and moved 
to the right. The altered course was confirmed by the change of 
the party's name to the Christian Democratic Social Party in 
1987. 
  DN [DAGENS NYHETER] has compared the 1984 party program with 
the current one. The difference is clear. In the 1984 program, 
the KDS advocated joint rule and repudiated a right-left 
political scale. The party supported alcohol rationing and 
opposed abortion on demand. Now the KDS is part of a 
nonsocialist government that supports unrestricted abortion 
rights and has dropped the demand for alcohol rationing. 
  There was a much stronger emphasis on Christianity in the 
1984 program, and the economic policy was entirely different 
from the policy the KDS pursues now. 
  Today the KDS's economic policy is characterized by a strong 
belief in a market economy, deregulation, and privatization. Ten 
years ago the program advocated a mixed economy and state 
regulation. 
  KDS has also changed its view on the existence or 
nonexistence of the state church. One more example of the 
party's altered view of the state. 
  According to political scientist Olof Wennas, writing in the 
most recent issue of KRISTDEMOKRATISK DEBATT, the KDS is in a 
period of ideological upheaval. 
  "Equality and solidarity do not have the same place in the 
new program of principle as they did in the previous one, nor 
does the concept of brotherhood. Criticism is aimed at socialism 
and liberalism, but not at conservatism and individualism. 
Several of the fundamental ideas of classic conservatism have 
been included, for example the concept of making haste slowly," 
Wennas wrote.

<F P=106> [Article by Gun Falth: "National Criminal Police Corps </F>
Getting New Leadership"] 
  [Text] Jorgen Almblad, best known as the prosecutor in the 
Palme case, will be the new head of the National Criminal Police 
Corps. His title will be National Criminal Police chief. Not 
quite as distinguished as SAPO [Security Police] chief, which 
has the rank of commissioner. 
  But organizationally they will be on an equal footing, as 
Almblad will command a more independent National Criminal Police 
Corps. 
  "I needed only two seconds to think it over when I was asked 
this morning. This is the most exciting job one can have if one 
is interested in operational police activity," Almblad said at 
Thursday's [14 April] news conference just after he was 
appointed by the government. 
<H5>  Not Unexpected </H5>
  He said he was bowled over. However, his appointment was not 
unexpected. Since 1989 he has been the second in command at 
SAPO, in charge of counterespionage, and since Mats Borjesson's 
recent retirement he has led the entire organization. 
  DAGENS NYHETER has been informed that Almblad stated that he 
would not remain at SAPO unless he became its permanent chief. 
And last week it was not he but Anders Eriksson who was named as 
Borjesson's successor. 
  Eriksson will take over on 1 May. Almblad will leave SAPO 
the 
same day. 
  The National Criminal Police Corps, the Swedish FBI, is 
primarily known on account of its former chief, Tommy Lindstrom. 
This unconventional and unbureaucratic person performed a 
hazardous balancing act in the gray zone between prohibited and 
permitted police methods. 
  In the end it was too much of a strain for the National 
Police Board, RPS. This is illustrated by the fact that 
Lindstrom has now been suspended from his job and is under 
indictment for falsifying documents and making false statements 
under oath. Additional indictments can be expected. 
<H5>  Without Supervision </H5>
  It was against this background, among other things, that 
one-man investigator Hakan Winberg proposed that the central 
police organization be remodeled. 
  The highest police leadership had no real supervision over 
the National Criminal Police, and it was necessary to remedy 
this unsatisfactory state of affairs. The chief of the National 
Criminal Police Corps, like the head of SAPO, should have 
managerial qualifications and does not need to have experience 
in the field, in Winberg's opinion. 
  The role of the National Criminal Police Corps in providing 
operational support for police districts around the country in 
difficult crime investigations has also become less important as 
the districts themselves acquire qualified detectives. 
  At the same time serious crimes requires a central criminal 
intelligence service and international police cooperation. 
Winberg proposed that this be the main task of the National 
Criminal Police. 
  RPS did not approve the proposals. A parliamentary committee 
was appointed, after National Police Commissioner Bjorn 
Eriksson, among others, acted and made it a political issue, to 
the government's annoyance. 
  But RPS itself has already reorganized the National Criminal 
Police Corps. And it could be difficult to make changes when the 
parliamentary committee presents its proposals at the end of 
1995. 
  The reorganization is based on establishing two new 
assistant 
commissioner posts for the National Criminal Police in addition 
to the chief commissioner. The government decided to do this on 
7 April. 
<H5>  Over 300 Employees </H5>
  The three police commissioners will head the secretariat and 
the criminal intelligence and crime-fighting units respectively. 
Two police superintendents will take care of Interpol and guard 
duty. Almblad will supervise the more than 330 employees. 
  What are the qualifications that make him suitable for the 
job? Is he the operationally experienced police chief Bjorn 
Eriksson wanted and asked the government for? 
  Almblad himself says: 
  "I have been with SAPO for five years. And I have worked as 
a 
prosecutor and judge. In addition I have had international 
contacts in recent years, and that will be useful." 
  Gunno Gunnmo, the chairman of the Policemen's Union, was 
informed of Almblad's appointment only hours before it was 
announced. He is not entirely satisfied about this. 
  "We think it is important to have an advance discussion on 
the National Criminal Police Corps' organizational changes, the 
demands they place on the chief, and the extent to which these 
demands will be met by the person to be appointed," Gunnmo said.

  [Text] During this period of unease in the Balkans, cordial 
Greek-Bulgarian relations constitute a sound basis on which all 
the efforts for inter-Balkan cooperation can be built. This 
statement was made by Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias after 
meeting with his Bulgarian counterpart Stanislav Daskalov, who 
began an official visit to our country yesterday. Mr. Papoulias 
said Mr. Daskalov's visit is a big step forward in 
Greek-Bulgarian relations and noted that Bulgarian Prime 
Minister Lyuben Berov will soon visit Athens, while he himself 
has accepted an invitation by his Buglarian counterpart to visit 
Sofia. 
  One of the important problems in Greek-Bulgarian relations 
is 
the Nestos River water, and the binational committee will meet 
in the first half of June to discuss the issue, Mr. Papoulias 
said, adding the hope that progress will be made. At the 
meeting, which was held today at 1030 in the Foreign Ministry, 
the two sides also discussed bilateral cooperation on the basic 
highway routes of Alexandroupolis-Svilengrad and 
Thessaloniki-Sofia as well as the north-south Egnatia Highway. 
These are significant large projects for improving the 
infrastructure as well as a contribution to future inter-Balkan 
cooperation. 
  Finally, Mr. Papoulias said concern was expressed over the 
war in Bosnia, where the two countries' appraisals coincide that 
hostilities must stop and negotiations begin immediately. Both 
sides feel that Greek-Bulgarian friendship constitutes a firm 
basis for all developments in the Balkans. 
  Responding to a question about the Greek position on the 
Albanian issue and whether he raised the Skopje [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] issue at the meeting with 
his Bulgarian counterpart, Mr. Papoulias said he told Mr. 
Daskalov that the question of respect for the Greek minority's 
rights is the cornerstone of any development in the 
Greek-Albanian relations. The Skopje issue was also discussed; 
both Greece and Bulgaria hope this crisis will be overcome. Mr. 
Papoulias will visit New York in mid-June, where he will meet 
with Cyrus Vance. The meeting between Ambassador Khristos 
Zakharakis and Vance might prepare the ground for good results 
in his own visit, Mr. Papoulias said. 
  The Bulgarian foreign minister said that at the meeting they 
agreed on the mutual desire to develop friendly Greek-Bulgarian 
relations to the benefit of both countries as well as peace and 
stability in the Balkans. Mr. Daskalov concluded: We 
appreciate Greece's support for Bulgarian ties with European 
organizations, particularly with the European Union. We agreed 
to form various groups of experts who will work to solve 
specific problems in all sectors of bilateral cooperation.

<F P=106> [Article by Phillip Johnston: "Poll is a Chance to Stop </F>
Shift to Left, Say Tories"] 
  [Text] As befits a party that, to say the least, has found 
agreement on Europe difficult, the Conservative manifesto for 
the June 9 election charts a delicate course through the 
minefield of conflicting opinion. 
  Unlike the last campaign in 1989 -- which reflected Mrs 
Thatcher's deep ambivalence to the whole European concept -- the 
manifesto seeks to balance Mr Major's commitment to place 
Britain at the heart of Europe with a pledge to hold back the 
centralising tendencies that have become more apparent in the 
intervening five years. 
  Mr Douglas Hurd, the Foreign Secretary -- who was in Russia 
yesterday and missed the formal launch -- believes the 56-page 
manifesto. A strong Britain in a Strong Europe, sits 
comfortably with the views of 90 per cent of the parliamentary 
party. 
  It emphasises: 
  a. Prosperity, with jobs a priority; 
  b. Decentralisation, with less interference from Brussels; 
  c. Open trading, based on free markets and least 
bureaucracy; 
  d. Competitiveness, to confront the Asian challenge; 
  e. Expansion, to include former Eastern bloc countries; 
  f. Keeping a veto to protect Britain's vital national 
interests. 
  The manifesto reflects the Government's determination to 
focus the Conservative campaign on Europe and away from domestic 
issues. Mr Major said the elections were not "a trivial opinion 
poll" about Government popularity but an important opportunity 
for the country to send representatives to the European 
parliament who would halt the lurch to the Left and the 
development of what he called a "stagnant socialist swamp". 
  In the foreword, Mr Major urges voters: "You will not be 
voting for Europe: Right or Wrong? You will be voting Europe: 
Right or Left? To the Right more jobs, more prosperity in a 
wider union of free nations. To the Left, more petty 
restrictions and longer dole queues." 
  The document makes no mention of a referendum, though Mr 
Major said there would not be one on whether Britain should 
remain in Europe and he would be "astonished" if one would be 
needed after the inter-governmental conference in 1996 on the 
future shape of Europe. 
  Among the specific issues addressed by the manifesto are: 
<H5>  SOCIAL CHAPTER </H5>
  A reminder that the opt-out secured by Mr Major at 
Maastricht 
relieved British businesses of policies that would have harmed 
job prospects. 
  These included a minimum wage, compulsory works councils, 
new 
union powers, a 35-hour week and higher corporate taxes. 
<H5>  SINGLE MARKET </H5>
  The assertion that Conservatives in Europe have fought for 
the free movement of capital, freedom and choice in air and road 
transport, opening up public contracts and achieving common 
standards for professional qualifications. 
<H5>  BUREAUCRACY </H5>
  The manifesto says the Tories will press for more 
deregulation in Europe by simplifying or scrapping about one 
quarter of all EC legislation. 
  The Government would press the Commission to set up its own 
deregulation unit. 
<H5>  PARLIAMENT </H5>
  The European parliament is more powerful as a result of the 
Maastricht treaty. 
  It can veto single market, consumer protection and research 
and development legislation and block the choice of the next 
President of the Commission when M Jacques Delors steps down 
later this year. The Tories say a vote for the centre-Right 
would mean a majority against another Socialist president. 
<H5>  AGRICULTURE </H5>
  Further reforms of the Common Agriculture Policy are seen as 
a priority. It must be "simplified, made more responsive to the 
market, less bureaucratic, its costs controlled and fraud 
curbed". 
<H5>  ENVIRONMENT </H5>
  Anti-pollution directives from Brussels in recent years have 
cost billions of pounds which have or will be passed on to 
consumers in the form of higher water charges and energy costs. 
  The manifesto says that while many environmental issues 
cross 
national boundaries, others should be for individual states to 
decide. The Tories would also press for a revision of existing 
water directives to allow improvements "at a pace people can 
afford." 
<H5>  IMMIGRATION </H5>
  One of the big issues. The Tories say that while minimum 
checks should be required for movement within the EC, citizens 
of other countries should be subject to full immigration 
controls. 
  Britain also seeks a common definition of asylum. 
<H5>  DEFENCE </H5>
  NATO would remain the cornerstone of Europe's defence and 
collective security, under-pinned by a continuing American 
presence in Europe. 
<H5>  THE FUTURE </H5>
  The manifesto proposes policies for a decentralised and open 
Europe that is more accessible to its 350 million people.

  [Excerpts] Frankfurt/Main (DDP/ADN) -- Federal 
Transportation Minister Matthias Wissmann (Christian Democratic 
Union) and Federico Pena, his U.S. counterpart, signed the new 
air traffic agreement between the United States and Germany in 
Frankfurt am Main today. The accord makes possible the agreed 
cooperation between Lufthansa and the American airline United 
Airlines, which will give the German airline considerably more 
opportunities in the United States than previously. "With the 
new agreement, charter and air freight traffic will from today 
be almost totally liberalized," Wissmann stressed. 
  The agreement guarantees fair and just competition between 
the companies themselves and with rivals from other countries, 
Wissmann explained. With the agreement, the German Government 
wants to assume a leading role in bringing about free-market 
conditions in international air traffic worldwide. Every effort 
will be made jointly to win over other states to the idea of a 
new air traffic "open sky" order without restrictions. The U.S. 
transportation secretary spoke of "general interest" in the 
agreement. The agreement is not only in the interests of the 
airlines, but it will also give the customer better services and 
scope for travel, Pena stressed. [passage omitted] 
  According to Lufthansa, the most important part of the 
cooperation is the joint flights, which begin on 1 June and for 
which bookings have been taken under joint flight numbers since 
9 May. These code-sharing rights allow Lufthansa, for example, 
to offer flights to all U.S. airports, even if the passengers 
change planes and have to complete the final part of the journey 
on an American airline. In return, as of June United Airlines 
can offer domestic German Lufthansa connections under their own 
flight number. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Francois Leotard by </F>
Alexandra Schwartzbrod and Gilles Senges; place and date not 
given: "Leotard: `Foreign Operations Should Total 3.3 Billion 
Francs'"] 
  [Text]The parliamentary debate on the military 
programming law, which commits France to spending 613 billion 
francs [Fr] on equipping its Armed Forces between now and the 
year 2000, is to begin today in an atmosphere of calm that is in 
sharp contrast to the stormy debates on nuclear deterrence that 
have stirred up the political class in recent months. In an 
interview with LES ECHOS, Defense Minister Francois Leotard 
pointed out that his bill is merely the expression of choices 
which are in line with the defense white paper. He explained 
his decision to give priority to ongoing production activities 
to the detriment of research, and acknowledged that he has 
changed his position on the antimissile defense projects. From 
the industrial point of view, he affirmed that he had confidence 
in companies and wanted to leave strategic choices up to them. 
Lastly, he gave an initial estimate of the cost of France's 
foreign operations in 1994, which should total Fr3.3 billion, a 
figure which includes the scaling down of troops in the former 
Yugoslavia. He hopes that this will be financed, like last 
year, by the supplementary budget. 
  [LES ECHOS] The military programming law should be passed by 
the entire political class, including the Socialists. This lack 
of controversy, does it not show that those who accuse you of 
having postponed all the important choices, were right? 
  [Leotard] There have been and there will be debates, but the 
bill should be passed with broad approval. I understand this 
very well and I hoped for it, because when the security of our 
country is at stake, it is best to avoid party squabbling. The 
agreement of the three major political groupings would be a good 
thing. It would show that we have done our work well. Everyone 
is aware of the government's desire to make defense a priority. 
The figures included in the military programming law prove 
this, since we are increasing our investment regularly until the 
year 2000. 
  The debate will certainly continue on topics such as nuclear 
testing or certain armament programmes. However, I vigorously 
disagree with the allegation that no choices were made in the 
military programming law. First of all, I have never heard 
anyone ask for a program to be stopped. Moreover, the bill 
submitted to Parliament is the expression of choices which are 
in line with the white paper: the choice of joint Armed Forces; 
priority to production currently under way; and the 
reinforcement of conventional forces. It is true that in 1997, 
decisions will have to be made on a number of programs such as 
the NH-90 helicopter, the ATF transport plane, or the second 
aircraft carrier. However, it is not necessary, nor is it 
possible, to make these decisions before then. 
  [LES ECHOS] Have you made a choice regarding the APTGD 
(long-range precision weapon) missile? 
  [Leotard] We will make a choice this year. However, I would 
like to emphasize in this respect that we have planned to 
earmark funds for the supersonic antiship missile program, the 
successor to the Exocet, and to do so before 1997. This will 
allow us to maintain our skills in the area of ramjet engines. 
  [LES ECHOS] You have decided to give preference to ongoing 
production activities to the detriment of spending for upstream 
research. Is that not dangerous in the long term given the fact 
that the United States is doing the opposite? 
  [Leotard] Spending for research is being reduced very 
slightly as a percentage of equipment expenditure, but as this 
is increasing in volume, we end up with virtually the same 
amount in constant francs. However, this is also a choice 
because we want to emphasize production. The productivity 
efforts which we initiated must also apply to research. I am 
convinced that we can do better with the same resources and that 
this decision in no way and in no sector will compromise 
France's military research effort. There is still redundancy to 
be eliminated and rationalization to be made. And this will make 
it possible to reinforce our efforts in priority areas. I feel 
that the time has come to put the emphasis on production, 
because I feel that priority must be given to equipping the 
Armed Forces. 
  [LES ECHOS] Are you not worried about industrial research 
agencies? 
  [Leotard] Everyone knows that the armaments industry is 
experiencing tough times. It is losing jobs. I do not wish to 
embellish the reality, but we are making the best possible use 
of our resources to maintain French competence. I cannot see 
any technological skills which we would be abandoning. 
  [LES ECHOS] Yet, at the same time, you say that they are 
going to have to be shared or abandoned? 
  [Leotard] Yes, in the future. Successive defense ministers 
often found themselves faced with a sort of budgetary obstacle 
which they used to push ahead of them. My concern is to have 
France get over such obstacles without too many difficulties so 
that we can appropriately prepare for the coming century. We 
are at the end of a period in which more than 90 percent of our 
defense requirements were produced nationally. More European 
cooperation is emerging on the horizon. We are faced with an 
alternative: either cooperate, or purchase from abroad, 
something which we would like to reduce. To this end, we are 
going to spend Fr1.2 billion per year between 1995 and 2000 on 
foreign purchases, compared with Fr1.4 billion per year between 
1987 and 1994. There is no third option, since it would mean 
the multiplication of national production by each of the 
European countries. 
  [LES ECHOS] One year ago, you made a vibrant plea in favor 
of 
antimissile defense. That is one of the rare lines of action 
which has been totally ruled out. What happened? 
  [Leotard] I now have a slightly different approach to the 
problem. I have observed that in the United States and in 
Germany the debate on this issue has been marked by a great deal 
of modesty, not like the enthusiasm of the eighties. As you 
know, we are devoting considerable debate--and also money--to 
policies which provide partial solutions to the problem in the 
knowledge that France alone is not able to solve it all by 
itself. What we want is to make the Germans our partners in a 
number of research areas. Within the current context of our 
research and products, we can provide certain aspects of an 
antimissile-based defense system. Here I am thinking in 
particular of the APTGD missile, which is a weapon of 
retaliation and is therefore part of this type of thinking. The 
Helios optical observation satellites and Osiris radar are also 
being actively continued in this spirit. Space observation is 
of fundamental importance in this area. We must now look and 
see what we are politically prepared to share with others, such 
as the warning system. 
  [LES ECHOS] Are you prepared to give the larger part of the 
Osiris program to the Germans? 
  [Leotard] The Germans seem to be interested in genuine 
cooperation with us in the area of space intelligence. That is 
a good thing. In addition, there is indeed a link with the 
industrial alliance projects currently being negotiated. 
  [LES ECHOS] Is Germany, which is slashing its defense 
spending, still a reliable partner? 
  [Leotard] In any case, we are in an imbalanced relationship, 
in that we are increasing our spending when all the other 
countries are reducing it. This allows France to pull the 
others along and to keep its lead. Cooperation is, by 
definition, based on the budget decisions of others. As long as 
there is no political authority in Europe, or legal structures 
such as a European armaments agency protecting national budget 
decisions, we will have this very delicate problem. If the 
British, German, and French develop a joint strategy in the 
industrial area, they are literally saving the European defense 
industry, and that is what I am endeavoring to do. Not a week 
goes by that I do not have discussions with my German or British 
counterparts. A very strong political will must be imposed on 
the military staff and industry. 
  [LES ECHOS] Before moving on to the European stage, should 
you not first of all successfully complete the industrial 
restructuring of French firms, as your predecessor began to do? 
  [Leotard] The state certainly has responsibilities and 
resources, but it does not have heavily influence the decisions 
of businesses which themselves have been, via the market, the 
major indicator of their strategy. This does not prevent me 
from giving support to regrouping operations at European level, 
which are currently being negotiated, including operations 
between private companies. I think that the collaboration 
currently under way, provided it leads to a satisfactory 
agreement, is the basis of the European defense industry and 
complies perfectly with the interests of our national industry. 
As for relations between Aerospatiale and Dassault, I think 
that this operation is an intelligent one. It should be 
pursued. Whether or not this should be done by hacking away at 
it or throwing diktats at it, I do not know. I am not an 
ideologist. 
  [LES ECHOS] What is your strategy for Dassault? 
  [Leotard] Our duty is to make that company give some thought 
to the post-Rafale period and open up its long-term prospects: 
In other words, to push it to move closer to other industrial 
companies. Dassault is making genuine and courageous efforts to 
rationalize its plant. It too has its own corporate reason for 
being. It is a company that makes one of the best products in 
the world. 
  [LES ECHOS] As regards the rapprochement between Thomson-CSF 
[Wireless Telegraphy Company] and TCE [Thomson Consumer 
Electronics], is there still talk about going private again? 
  [Leotard] No. This rapprochement is no longer news. 
  [LES ECHOS] Are you in favor of a rapprochement between CSF 
and DASA? 
  [Leotard] If plans for a rapprochement were to take shape 
with regard to part of the activity of these two companies, I 
would look into it with the concern that it be in line with the 
highly advanced rapprochement currently emerging between 
Aerospatiale and DASA. 
  [LES ECHOS] GIAT [Industrial Group for Ground Weapons] 
Industries has announced poor results. Do you hope to see it 
recapitalized? 
  [Leotard] It will have to be. The thing that really strikes 
me, however, is that we are dragging along extremely heavy state 
structures which are no longer suited to the constraints of the 
market, with cost levels that are much too high. We must 
therefore continue down the road taken to adapt to the market. 
For GIAT Industries, this will involve pursuing efforts to 
boost productivity. Many of its production centers are still 
not in a position to produce under good conditions. We have to 
motivate employees so that the adjustment can be made with the 
fewest possible social difficulties. This is just as true for 
GIAT Industries as for other companies. 
  [LES ECHOS] Do you think you will be able to comply with 
budget restrictions this year? 
  [Leotard] I will have to make efforts like all the ministers 
due to the reduction in operating expenditure. However, do not 
forget that the Defense Ministry is the state's leading investor 
and that it is increasing its efforts throughout the military 
programming law. 
  [LES ECHOS] What is your estimate of the cost of foreign 
operations this year? 
  [Leotard] It should total Fr3.3 billion, in terms of 
remuneration and operating expenses. Nevertheless, we have to 
remain very cautious. These are only forecasts. In addition, I 
would like the prime minister to allow us to repeat what 
happened in 1993. Indeed, for the first time the additional 
spending on foreign operations was not financed by tapping into 
spending for defense equipment. The prime minister is well 
aware of this problem. 
  [LES ECHOS] You have given Army Auditor Yvon Jouan the task 
of studying weapons exports. In the coming year, do you plan to 
reform the way in which this activity is organized in France? 
  [Leotard] The system used by the CIEEMG (Interministerial 
Committee for the Study of Weapons Exports) is very strict and 
tightly controlled. I feel that this is a good thing. It does 
not leave room for unexpected increases or for attitudes that 
run counter to a political will. With regard to the system used 
by the armaments offices, I personally feel that there must be 
some rationalization along geographical, institutional, or 
structural lines. We are working on it.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Antonio Martino by Valeska </F>
von Roques and Marion Schreiber; place and date not given: "More 
European Than Our Predecessors"] 
  [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Minister, Europe is afraid of 
the F Factor in the Berlusconi government. Five cabinet members 
are believed to belong to the extreme right-wing camp; three of 
them come from the Italian Social Movement [MSI], a party that 
has never abandoned fascism. 
  [Martino] Concerns abroad were predictable and are 
understandable. The change in Italy was so radical that there 
were bound to be problems with its interpretation. But 
basically, the five ministers are members of the Alleanza 
Nazionale, which is different from the MSI, and the MSI is not 
the Fascist Party of the past. For me, the most important thing 
is that this alliance has signed our joint program, and this is 
not a program of the right-wing, but a program of the 
liberal-center. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Nonetheless, for the first time since the end 
of the war, there are fascists in a West European government. 
That was inconceivable until recently. Hasn't a taboo been 
broken now? 
  [Martino] If these people were really neofascists, I would 
not be in a government with them. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The Alleanza Nazionale clearly represents 
revanchist positions in its election program. It wants to 
revise the Peace Treaty of 1947 and the Treaty of Osimo, which 
confirmed the secession of the Eastern Adriatic region to 
Yugoslavia. We quote: "Following German reunification, Italy 
must be reunited, too, with Istria, Fiume, and Dalmatia being 
returned to Italy." 
  [Martino] Our foreign political government program has 
nothing to do with such ideas. This means, first, that borders 
will not be called into question, and, second, treaties will not 
be discarded. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Is all this really that harmless? On the very 
day the government statement was made, news broke that the MSI 
moved a draft law calling for the abolition of the ban on 
Mussolini's fascist party. 
  [Martino] That was an unfortunate initiative, but Gianfranco 
Fini promptly dissociated himself from it. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] But he also signed it. 
  [Martino] Why don't you ask him; there was talk about an 
error. For a better understanding of the new political 
situation in Italy, the world should know that we have amended 
our election law. The former system of proportional 
representation allowed political parties with extreme positions 
to acquire a strong image and thus fill niches. However, the 
system of majority representation creates overlapping alliances, 
in which radical positions are smoothed and are even punished to 
a certain extent. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] This hardly mitigates the European neighbors' 
concerns. They fear that the apparently more gentle Italian 
version of right-wing extremism could encourage aggressive 
neofascism in their own countries. 
  [Martino] Let me be very specific. In the local elections 
in December, MSI chairman Gianfranco Fini won 47 percent of the 
votes in Rome, his fellow party member Alessandra Mussolini won 
44 percent in Naples. If we as Forza Italia had not appeared in 
this situation, these right-wing groups would have offered 
themselves as the only alternative to the left-wing parties. In 
this way, we not only prevented the victory of the left, but 
also that of the extreme right wing. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Forza Italia as the savior of the fatherland? 
  [Martino] There are also positive elements of this dramatic 
change for us. I wish they were noted abroad and in particular 
in Germany. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The new government in Rome is currently 
causing different concerns among its European partners. Italy 
has traditionally always been very pro-European. Will the EC 
founding member now join those who intend to put a brake on 
European unification? 
  [Martino] I can hardly have conveyed this impression. I was 
less than three days in office, and the government had not even 
been confirmed by Parliament, when I took part in the Council 
meeting in Brussels and met with European Commission President 
Jacques Delors, whom I assured of the continuity of Italy's 
European policy. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] But you are known as a Euroskeptic. For 
instance, you took part in the meeting of the Brugge group, 
which backs Margaret Thatcher's negative attitude toward 
European unity. 
  [Martino] I admire Mrs. Thatcher for what she has done for 
the British economy. She introduced the dynamism of the free 
market economy into the antiquated economic system. I took part 
in the meetings of this Brugge group twice. At the first 
meeting in Brugge in 1989, I said amid general applause that 
exaggerated regimentation only creates discord instead of 
accord. In London, I was booed for my views on monetary policy. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Does this mean that you advocate monetary 
union? 
  [Martino] Yes, I think a common currency is desirable for 
psychological and economic reasons and as an alternative to the 
U.S. dollar on the world market. I doubt, however, that a 
common currency can be achieved step by step. For certain 
problems, there are no gradual solutions. It is, for instance, 
impossible to abolish left-hand traffic in Britain by 
introducing right-hand traffic for trucks on the first day, cars 
on the second day, and mopeds on the third day. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Gradual development has so far been the basic 
principle of European integration. 
  [Martino] Being for Europe does not mean approving every 
technical option or strategy. Even though there may be 
differences of opinion with European partners on individual 
issues, our government possibly is even more European than its 
predecessors on the great objectives. By the way, the 
conference of Messina in 1955, at which European integration was 
initiated, was chaired by a foreign minister called Martino. He 
was my father, one of the signatories of the Treaties of Rome. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Times have since changed considerably. Today, 
problems of the economy, the environment, or traffic can only be 
solved internationally. At the same time, national egoism is 
growing in all member states. How do you intend to resolve this 
contradiction? 
  [Martino] Experience has shown that trade unites, whereas 
policy divides. That is why we should not try to intervene in 
the markets by means of too many regulations. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] But environmental problems today cannot be 
solved without European regulations. 
  [Martino] These are noble ecological views. However, often 
enough, environmental protection is a pretext for protectionist 
measures. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] For countries like Spain and Portugal, the 
European environmental standards constitute progress. They 
received billions from the EU coffers for the modernization of 
old industries that are now supposed to emit fewer pollutants. 
  [Martino] European policy should be focused on the common 
great goals and go back to European values. I do not want the 
cynical characterization of an American friend to apply to us; 
he said Europe is nothing but a collection of valuable old 
property. I think rather that Europe should have a voice and 
weight in the world. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Could that be achieved with a common foreign 
and security policy? 
  [Martino] When my father was foreign minister 40 years ago, 
the attempt failed to found a European defense community; it 
failed because the French parliament refused to ratify the 
project. I still consider a common foreign and security policy 
indispensable. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Membership of Austria and three Scandinavian 
countries within the European Union [EU] is for Germany the 
first step of an EU enlargement to the East. What is your 
position? 
  [Martino] Very positive, even though such an enlargement 
will slow down the process of integration. Just as we talked 
about West Germany until recently and speak about Germany now, 
we will also speak about the EU. We will then no longer speak 
about West Europe, but about Europe as a whole. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Are you anticipating a certain German 
predominance in Europe, as the French do? 
  [Martino] Personally I do not have any problems with it. As 
for the rest, my motto is that he who predicts catastrophes will 
suffer twice -- once when he predicts them, and then when they 
take place. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Minister, we thank you for this interview.

<F P=106> [Interview with Minister of Economy and Finance Pedro Solbes </F>
by Juan Tapia and Enric Tintore -- place and date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [LA VANGUARDIA] Public 
distrust as a result of the recent corruption cases should not 
affect the economic recovery process now under way. This was 
stated this week by IMF Director General Michel Camdessus during 
his visit to Spain. Do you agree with this analysis? 
  [Solbes] Political uncertainty always affects the economy. 
It is absurd to deny it. The financial markets -- especially 
the stock exchange and the peseta -- have reacted badly at some 
junctures when it seemed that political stability in Spain could 
not be guaranteed. Right now, that danger of political 
instability has been completely surmounted, and the financial 
markets are behaving well again. 
  [LA VANGUARDIA] But do you not believe that business 
investment could reflect adversely the current atmosphere of 
political uncertainty? 
  [Solbes] Investment by large enterprises is planned well in 
advance and is normally of a long-term nature. Investment by 
small and medium enterprises may perhaps have been delayed 
somewhat. But there is no doubt that political tension adversely 
affects the economy. Therefore, each political force must face 
up to its responsibilities, and the public must know how to 
assess the conduct of each of them. 
  [LA VANGUARDIA] So do you believe there will be no further 
scandals to complicate matters again? 
  [Solbes] I cannot swear to it, but I believe that yes, there 
will be calm and confidence will be recovered. The government 
has made very important decisions to increase oversight and has 
accepted its political responsibilities, and I hope that no 
further problems will arise. 
  [LA VANGUARDIA] Have you noted any sign of an economic 
stoppage during May? 
  [Solbes] No, so far we have no information that permits us 
to believe that this has occurred. 
  [LA VANGUARDIA] Has investment now finally taken off as you 
have hinted? 
  [Solbes] Investment in capital goods is beginning to take 
off, judging by the good performance of imports. Investment in 
housing shows good prospects in light of cement consumption. On 
the other hand, investment in public works is performing more 
sluggishly than expected. 
  [LA VANGUARDIA] The Bank of Spain lowered interest rates by 
0.25 percent Friday [13 May], after the Bundesbank had done so 
by 0.50 percent Wednesday. Is there scope left for further 
falls in the short or medium term? 
  [Solbes] The key to further falls in interest rates lies in 
two things -- the other European countries lowering them and our 
being able to reduce inflation and the public deficit. But the 
remaining scope is very small, both for ourselves and for the 
countries around us. In general, the big cuts in the price of 
money have already been made. 
  [LA VANGUARDIA] Do you believe the peseta's current exchange 
rate is at the right level? 
  [Solbes] The peseta's exchange rate against the [German] 
mark 
has performed rather worse over the past few days. A few weeks 
ago, we were at 81 pesetas to the mark. I accept that we could 
reach 82 pesetas to the mark, but I do not believe the peseta's 
depreciation beyond that to be justified. 
  [LA VANGUARDIA] But a cheap peseta is what enterprises are 
demanding. The outcome of the devaluation has been very good 
for the economy, so far. 
  [Solbes] The peseta exchange rate must reflect the objective 
state of the Spanish economy, and, from that viewpoint, 
exceeding the current levels would place us on an unrealistic 
exchange rate. 
  [LA VANGUARDIA] What do you have to say about the fact that 
wages are increasing by 3.8 percent on average, in light of the 
few agreements that have been signed, whereas you advised a wage 
freeze? 
  [Solbes] I would have preferred agreements more in keeping 
with the difficult economic situation in which we find 
ourselves. However, if that percentage of increase is confirmed, 
wage increases will be less than they were last year, but with 
insufficient restraint to be able to create jobs. If there is 
no wage restraint, the danger that jobs will be lost is real. I 
deem it a good thing for everybody to realize this and behave 
reasonably. 
  [LA VANGUARDIA] Do you not believe that these 3.8-percent 
increases could jeopardize the inflation target for this year, 
especially since we still have an annual rate of around 5 
percent? 
  [Solbes] If in 1993, with high wage increases, we had an 
annual inflation rate of 4.9 percent, things should go better 
this year. The increase in wages is more moderate, and this 
must be acknowledged. 
  Inflation will perform better this year than last year, and 
I 
still expect to end it at 3.5 percent, because the wage 
increases are more moderate than in 1993; there has been no tax 
increase, and the impact of devaluation has been assimilated in 
almost all sectors except food. 
  According to the figures published Friday, underlying 
inflation went very well in April. It is true that overall 
inflation has improved by just 0.1 percent, but that was mainly 
as a result of food prices, which still show the increase caused 
by the impact of the devaluation of the peseta. We will begin 
to see an improvement in food prices from June onward, and this 
will bring inflation down to more appropriate levels. That is 
where we have the greatest scope to improve prices. 
  [LA VANGUARDIA] What is your opinion of the trade unions' 
conduct? Do you not believe that if they accept wage restraint, 
it will be in return for blocking the implementation of the 
labor reform in enterprises? 
  [Solbes] They may try to do so, but it would be a mistake. 
The country needs the reform, and not implementing it means 
opting for not creating jobs, which is an aim that the trade 
unions should share. 
  [LA VANGUARDIA] It seems that the government -- and, more 
specifically, yourself -- has lost much of the enthusiasm for 
the EC that used to characterize it years ago. Is it true that 
you now deem it impossible for Spain to adopt the European top 
speed toward a single currency? 
  [Solbes] The Community's decision on the European top speed 
will be taken in 1996. To speak now of the prospects that there 
will be at that time is premature. The European Commission's 
latest report states that only three countries fulfill the 
conditions laid down in the Maastricht Treaty. Over the past 
few years, not only has there not been greater convergence, but 
divergence between the Community's economies has increased. 
  In 1996, there will also be an additional problem -- 
deciding 
how the European Union [EU] is to proceed from the broad 
fluctuation band of the European Monetary System to the narrow 
band and the single currency. And in the face of this 
challenge, I personally, like many other European economy 
ministers, will never propose that Spain proceed to this third 
stage of monetary union if we are not really ready. 
  The third stage requires not only a healthy and sound 
economic discipline, but also entails restrictions that can only 
be satisfied if some minimum conditions are fulfilled. To 
believe that we could have an absolutely stable currency 
situation and maintain a significant inflation differential 
would be absurd. However, the decisions in 1996 will not depend 
on us alone. They will require a new reflection on the state of 
the European project. 
  [LA VANGUARDIA] So must we forgo the European top speed? 
  [Solbes] Despite all the European project's problems, what 
seems to me really important is that we make every possible 
effort to ensure that the Spanish economy's real conditions 
approach those of the other member countries. So if we achieve 
this, we will be in a better position to make the leap to the 
third stage of European Monetary Union [EMU], which is the stage 
leading to the single currency, when the time comes. Otherwise, 
if we are unable to achieve this, I would advise not entering 
this third stage. 
  [LA VANGUARDIA] In giving up, as it has done, the idea of 
reducing the public deficit to 3 percent of GDP in 1997, the 
government has also now given up the idea of adopting the top 
speed in EMU. Is this not so? 
  [Solbes] Not at all. Our public deficit clearly worsened 
with the crisis. We are not the only country in Europe -- far 
from it -- that has had this problem. The Community's average 
public deficit is 5.1 percent of GDP. Therefore there are 
several European countries with budgetary difficulties similar 
to ours. We plan to end this year with a state public deficit 
of 5.7 percent of GDP, plus the 1 percent of the deficit created 
in the autonomous communities and local administrations. The 
important thing is to change the trend in the deficit and 
continue to reduce it. 
  [LA VANGUARDIA] What is the government's aim with respect to 
next year's budget? 
  [Solbes] We have outlined the budgetary scenario for the 
next three years, and it is extremely restrictive. All the 
government ministers now have information about the future 
financial framework within which they will have to operate. 
Despite this, it is a difficult endeavor to reduce the public 
deficit from 6.7 percent to 3 percent of GDP in virtually three 
years. We seek to achieve 3 percent of GDP in 1997 but, if this 
is not possible, we will try to come as close to it as possible. 
  [LA VANGUARDIA] In that atmosphere of budgetary restriction, 
how can aid for Seat or Suzuki be found? 
  [Solbes] I see great difficulties in finding public aid for 
Volkswagen or Suzuki. The EU strictly limits direct aid. There 
is greater scope for aid for design, research, and technological 
development. The government will help as far as possible within 
the established rules. 
  [LA VANGUARDIA] The government's plan to reduce the deficit 
is very little known. What are that plan's main guidelines? 
  [Solbes] The guidelines proceed from three major assumptions 
-- keeping the broad outlines of 1994, with some corrections, 
mainly linked to wage reviews. In the public sector, officials 
will have a pay rise in 1995 that will coincide with the 
inflation forecast for that year. In 1993, officials' wages 
increased by 1.8 percent, with an inflation rate of 4.9 percent. 
This year, the rise in officials' pay has been zero, with an 
inflation rate of 3.5 percent. So public officials have already 
made a very considerable pay effort. However, in the case of 
personnel costs, we wish to continue to maintain the restrictive 
policy on hiring new personnel. We will also maintain a 
restrictive policy on expenditure on goods and services, as well 
as on transfers to public enterprises and other bodies. From 
the viewpoint of revenue, the basic idea is to keep the 
currently existing level of taxation as the average. However, 
maintaining the tax burden does not mean not making some changes. 
  [LA VANGUARDIA] How much will public expenditure increase 
next year? 
  [Solbes] I wish you had asked me how much the public deficit 
will be reduced next year, but, joking apart, my intention is 
for it to increase in nominal terms, although it should reduce 
its share in GDP. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Socialist People's Party Chairman </F>
Holger K. Nielsen by Ole Lorenzen and Rikke Andreasen; place and 
date not given] 
  [Text] The possibility of a Liberal-Conservative-Progress 
Party majority that surfaces from time to time in the opinion 
polls is due to the voters' dissatisfaction that there was no 
major change in Danish politics when Poul Nyrup Rasmussen 
(Social Democratic Party) became prime minister. 
  Therefore, it is not a good idea that the present government 
should continue after the next election even if all the four 
government parties manage to stay above the threshold for 
representation in the Folketing. This is the view of Socialist 
People's Party [SF] chairman Holger K. Nielsen. 
  According to his timetable, at 1400 today he is to start the 
debate at his party's national conference. And with the 
European Union [EU] discussion behind it, the dominant item on 
the party's agenda is the Folketing election and the situation 
after it. 
  Increasingly often in recent months, we have seen the 
government and the SF backing the laws that the Folketing has 
passed. 
  After a year out in the cold, the SF has therefore come back 
into the warm. But this does not make Holger K. Nielsen keen to 
continue along this path after the election. 
  [NIELSEN] "Nyrup is quite clearly trying to avoid situations 
where the voting split is 90-89. That is why the government 
tries to draw us in when things are tight. But this is still 
not satisfactory. 
  "I also sense that there is so much dissolution in the 
government parties that this in itself will create an impetus 
that will mean that the Christian People's Party and the Center 
Democrats will not continue in the government after the election. 
  ``So after the next election there will probably be 
negotiations with us about the shape of a government platform, 
and it seems to me totally improbable that we and the Center 
Democrats will be able to reach agreement. After all, the 
Center Democrats entered the government in order to keep us out." 
  [DET FRI AKTUELT] Is it not better that the Center Democrats 
are part of the government and are therefore tied to it, than 
that the party is outside the government and is therefore able 
to do even more somersaults? 
  [NIELSEN] "No, I am not so sure that it is. My point of 
departure is that I should defend the interests of SF voters. 
It is not our historic task to keep Poul Nyrup Rasmussen in 
power. Our task is to get as much SF policy through as 
possible. And in addition the present government is proof that 
there is not that much of an advantage in having the Center 
Democrats involved. 
  "The government's profile is becoming so changeable that 
this 
gives rise to much more concern. At bottom the four parties 
want something different. The Center Democrats have entered the 
government and lost almost all their voters to the 
nonsocialists. And those voters they have have a more obvious 
orientation toward the nonsocialists than to us. That is why I 
believe that it would have been a much, much better solution in 
January 1993 if we had gotten a purely Social Democratic 
government. 
  "It could have maneuvered quite a lot and quite effectively. 
The Center Democrats could have adopted a high profile on issues 
where they wanted to adopt a high profile without this causing 
any problems, and agreements could have been reached with us 
without this causing any problems." 
  [DET FRI AKTUELT] Is this not because the Social 
Democrats, the SF, and the Radical Liberals today have a 
majority? After the election it looks as if this will not be 
enough. 
  [NIELSEN] "There is a difference of course. But I still 
believe that a continuation of the four-party government is a 
pretty hopeless construction. Nor do I believe that they will 
all manage to stay above the threshold for representation in the 
Folketing. I also believe that the Social Democrats, the SF, 
and the Radical Liberals will attract quite a lot of votes and 
have a majority again if we state quite clearly what we want. 
There are quite a lot of stay-at-home voters in the opinion 
polls, and we should therefore not attach too much importance to 
them. A lot will happen in the election campaign." 
  In the fall of 1992 the SF made public a government program 
in the expectation that a Folketing election was on the way. It 
never came. The SF negotiated with the Social Democrats about a 
government platform after the fall of the Schluter government, 
but drew a blank. That is why it is a more cautious chairman 
who will wait until after the election before he airs his hopes. 
  [NIELSEN] "Not everywhere in the SF is there enthusiasm for 
the Radical Liberals, but I believe that people accept that a 
majority comprising the Social Democrats and the SF alone is not 
just around the corner. That is why it must be a case of the 
three parties' trying to create a base for some reforms in the 
field of green politics and in the field of increased 
democratization." 
  [DET FRI AKTUELT] Is it really the case that you want to 
have the Radical Liberals involved in putting pressure on the 
Social Democrats rather than doing so alone? 
  [Nielsen] "No, that is not the case. Despite everything the 
Radical Liberals are quite a problem in the field of economic 
policy. But there are many good prospects in a majority which 
also includes the Radical Liberals." 
  There are six topics on the agenda when the weekend's 
national conference comes to put together an election program 
for the party. 
  -- More must be done to bring down unemployment -- including 
reducing working hours to 30 hours a week. 
  -- Higher environmental levies and other green proposals 
will reduce consumption. The environment comes before growth. 
  -- Public services must be improved with more on offer for 
children and old people, and the disappearance of waiting lists 
for hospital treatment. 
  -- Economic democracy must be brought back onto the agenda 
again -- in pension funds, too. 
  -- A new security policy must be formulated, representing 
massive savings in defense. 
  -- The efforts to get the EU to pursue a different policy 
will continue. Denmark's national compromise must be adhered to. 
  [DET FRI AKTUELT] This sounds like a very expensive program. 
  [Nielsen] "Yes, but the whole thing can hold together. We 
are not so keen that taxes should be brought down the whole 
time. Also, there are still places from which money can be 
taken. It is pointless for Denmark to have the lowest gasoline 
taxes. There is also scope for introducing an advertising levy." 
  However, he is consciously low profile in his concrete 
demands on a Nyrup Rasmussen government after the election. 
  For example, it is not a demand that the SF should be 
involved in the next multiparty defense agreement. 
  "If Defense Minister Haekkerup would rather reach an 
agreement with the Conservatives, I think this will cause him 
bigger problems than being outside an agreement causes us," 
Nielsen said. 
  Nor will the tax reform of which the SF has been highly 
critical need to be recast. The necessary redistribution to 
benefit those who are worst off will be achieved in other ways. 
  The debate in Kolding over the next few days will show 
whether Holger K. Nielsen has the party with him on this.

  [Text] During this period of unease in the Balkans, cordial 
Greek-Bulgarian relations constitute a sound basis on which all 
the efforts for inter-Balkan cooperation can be built. This 
statement was made by Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias after 
meeting with his Bulgarian counterpart Stanislav Daskalov, who 
began an official visit to our country yesterday. Mr. Papoulias 
said Mr. Daskalov's visit is a big step forward in 
Greek-Bulgarian relations and noted that Bulgarian Prime 
Minister Lyuben Berov will soon visit Athens, while he himself 
has accepted an invitation by his Buglarian counterpart to visit 
Sofia. 
  One of the important problems in Greek-Bulgarian relations 
is 
the Nestos River water, and the binational committee will meet 
in the first half of June to discuss the issue, Mr. Papoulias 
said, adding the hope that progress will be made. At the 
meeting, which was held today at 1030 in the Foreign Ministry, 
the two sides also discussed bilateral cooperation on the basic 
highway routes of Alexandroupolis-Svilengrad and 
Thessaloniki-Sofia as well as the north-south Egnatia Highway. 
These are significant large projects for improving the 
infrastructure as well as a contribution to future inter-Balkan 
cooperation. 
  Finally, Mr. Papoulias said concern was expressed over the 
war in Bosnia, where the two countries' appraisals coincide that 
hostilities must stop and negotiations begin immediately. Both 
sides feel that Greek-Bulgarian friendship constitutes a firm 
basis for all developments in the Balkans. 
  Responding to a question about the Greek position on the 
Albanian issue and whether he raised the Skopje [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] issue at the meeting with 
his Bulgarian counterpart, Mr. Papoulias said he told Mr. 
Daskalov that the question of respect for the Greek minority's 
rights is the cornerstone of any development in the 
Greek-Albanian relations. The Skopje issue was also discussed; 
both Greece and Bulgaria hope this crisis will be overcome. Mr. 
Papoulias will visit New York in mid-June, where he will meet 
with Cyrus Vance. The meeting between Ambassador Khristos 
Zakharakis and Vance might prepare the ground for good results 
in his own visit, Mr. Papoulias said. 
  The Bulgarian foreign minister said that at the meeting they 
agreed on the mutual desire to develop friendly Greek-Bulgarian 
relations to the benefit of both countries as well as peace and 
stability in the Balkans. Mr. Daskalov concluded: We 
appreciate Greece's support for Bulgarian ties with European 
organizations, particularly with the European Union. We agreed 
to form various groups of experts who will work to solve 
specific problems in all sectors of bilateral cooperation.

  [Text] Talloires, France, May 26 (AFP) -- Negotiators for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina's three warring parties and an international 
contact group resumed closed-door talks here Thursday [26 May] 
to try to establish a ceasefire and work out the country's 
division. 
  There have been no official comments on progress, but a 
member of the Croat press contingent who said he had access to 
the meeting reported that the Croats and Moslems, who have 
agreed to form a federation, had dropped demands for more 
territory. 
  He said they had agreed to negotiate on the basis of a 
European Union plan backed by the contact group, which is made 
up of ther United States, Russia, five West European countries 
and representatives of the United Nations. 
  This plan would allot 51 percent of Bosnian territory to the 
Moslems and Croats and 49 percent to the Serbs. 
  The Moslems and Croats now control 30 percent of the 
republic's territory and were demanding 58 percent -- about as 
much as they held before the two-year-old war. Bosnian Serbs 
control the remaining 70 percent of the territory. 
  The talks started Wednesday in this tourist town near Lake 
Annecy in the French Alps, just over the border from Geneva. 
  Delegates include Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, 
Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic, the head of the Bosnian Croat 
community, Kresimir Zubak, and for the Serbs, the head of their 
self-proclaimed parliament, Momcilo Krajisnik. 
  The contact group is pushing for an immediate four-month 
ceasefire as a test of the commitment of the belligerents to 
reach a settlement. 
  Both France and Britain have warned they are ready to pull 
all their peacekeeping troops out of Bosnia by the end of the 
year if no serious progress is made towards restoring peace. 
  The meeting was to wind up Thursday then mostly likely 
resume 
in about 10 days at a location not yet announced to prepare a 
conference of foreign ministers around mid-June as a follow-up 
to one in Geneva on May 13.

  [Text] Talloires, France, May 26 (AFP) -- International 
negotiators were considering presenting a take-it-or-leave-it 
peace plan Thursday [26 May] to Bosnia's belligerents, who are 
balking at European proposals to carve-up the country, a 
diplomat close to the talks said. 
  The diplomat said the "contact group" of European, UN, U.S. 
and Russian negotiators were ready to try to impose a 
territorial solution on the warring parties, presumably by 
threatening to withdraw peacekeeping forces from Bosnia if the 
new plan was rejected. 
  The diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said 
closed-door negotiations which began at this French Alpine 
resort on Wednesday between the contact group and Bosnia's 
Croats, Moslems and Serbs "did not bring any new elements" 
despite earlier reports of progress. 
  "Each party is sticking to their earlier position, whereby 
the idea of considering a more authoritarian approach," the 
source said. 
  He said Wednesday's talks focussed exclusively on 
constitutional issues and the territorial carve-up of Bosnia. 
  "There was no mention of the fighting," he said. 
  The contact group held separate talks with each of the 
Bosnian delegations representing the country's Moslems, Croats 
and Serbs, the source added. 
  There have been no official comments on progress, but a 
member of the Croat press contingent who said he had access to 
the meeting reported Wednesday that the Croats and Moslems, who 
have agreed to form a federation, had dropped demands for more 
territory. 
  He said they had agreed to negotiate on the basis of a 
European Union plan backed by the contact group which would 
allot 51 percent of Bosnian territory to the Moslem-Croat 
federation and 49 percent to the Serbs. 
  The Moslems and Croats now control 30 percent of the 
republic's territory and were demanding 58 percent -- 
corresponding to the areas which had Croat and Moslem majorities 
before the two-year-old war. Bosnian Serbs control the 
remaining 70 percent of the territory. 
  France and Britain, the main providers of troops for the UN 
peacekeeping operation, have warned they might pull their 
soldiers out of Bosnia by the end of the year if no serious 
progress is made towards restoring peace. 
  The talks here were to wind up Thursday and are expected to 
resume in about 10 days at a location not yet announced to 
prepare a conference of foreign ministers around mid-June as a 
follow-up to one in Geneva on May 13.

  [Text] Paris, May 25 (AFP) -- French Defense Minister 
Francois Leotard on Wednesday [25 May] confirmed that the French 
military contingent in former Yugoslavia would be dropped by 
2,500 men by the end of the year. 
  He said it was "a French decision determined by the 
evolution 
of the crisis." 
  By the end of 1994, "we are going to drop the volume of our 
forces in Bosnia and we are going to regroup them around 
Sarajevo. This is a decision we have taken," Leotard said on 
French radio. 
  France now has 6,800 troops in former Yugoslavia, the 
backbone of the UN contingent there. A thousand of them will be 
repatriated in June from northern Krajina, a Serb-occupied Croat 
territory, while another 1,200 others are to leave the Moslem 
pocket of Bihac in northwestern Bosnia in six months, the 
Defense Ministry recently announced. 
  France, and later Britain, have both warned they would pull 
their forces out of Bosnia if there is no breakthrough in the 
peace process. Britain has about 3,000 troops in former 
Yugoslavia. 
  France on Wednesday was hosting talks by the belligerents 
and 
the international contact group trying to restart peace talks. 
They were being held in Talloires, in the French Alps, just 
across the border from Geneva. 
  Juppe warned Tuesday that "if the parties involved don't 
want 
peace we will act accordingly." 
  French Socialist Party leader Michel Rocard on Wednesday 
urged that "negotiations still be given a chance" but said they 
could only work "if there is a serious threat of air strikes" 
backing them up. 
  Rocard also voiced support for lifting the arms embargo 
against Bosnia if the lastest negotiation bid fails. 
  Given the lack of success of UN efforts to resolve the 
Bosnian crisis up to now, he said "elementary morality would 
imply that at least if we cannot protect the Bosnians, we let 
them protect themselves."

  [Text] Brussels, May 25 (AFP) -- Russian Defence Minister 
Pavel Grachev on Wednesday [25 May] proposed regular 
consultations on European and global security issues as part of 
Moscow's decision to join NATO's Partnership for Peace (PFP) 
programme. 
  In a speech to defence ministers from both the NATO 
countries 
and the former Soviet bloc, Pavel suggested the consultations be 
held regularly between political leaders, experts or military 
chiefs, as well as to look at emergency situations. 
  Grachev the previous day announced Moscow was no longer 
setting conditions to join the PFP, drawing warm praise from 
U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry earlier on Wednesday. 
  Perry said Grachev had given "an excellent presentation" to 
the NATO ministers on Tuesday on Russia's new military doctrine 
to replace the security blueprint of the defunct Soviet Union. 
  "It was a truly historic event," he said, adding that it was 
his fifth meeting with Grachev. "We've become really close 
colleagues in resolving security issues of our two countries," 
Perry said. 
  Grachev said Russia was not insisting on special political 
links with NATO as the price for signing the PFP, which has 
already been joined by 16 countries of the old Soviet bloc. 
  But he said Russia still had a list detailing its 
requirements for PFP participation, and still wanted links with 
NATO outside the Partnership.

<F P=106> [By Graham Brown] </F>
  [Text] Brussels, May 25 (AFP) -- The relief was palpable 
at NATO here Wednesday [25 May] after Russia signalled it was 
ready to join the Western alliance's programme of military 
partnership amid pledges of a new nonaggressive post-Cold War 
military doctrine. 
  Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev declared on several 
occasions on Tuesday and Wednesday that Moscow would set no 
conditions for joining the Partnership for Peace (PFP) programme. 
  However, he said Russia still wanted regular political 
consultations on European and global security with NATO on a 
regular and emergency basis. There was no immediate NATO 
response. 
  Grachev was speaking at a meeting of defence ministers from 
the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation with their counterparts 
from the former Soviet bloc. 
  U.S. Secretary of State William Perry said Grachev had given 
an "excellent presentation" on Russia's new nonaggressive 
post-Cold War military doctrine, and expressed pleasure at 
Russia's pledge to join the PFP. 
  NATO countries had been worried that Russia would present a 
list of unacceptable demands for joining the PFP, which was 
launched in January and groups the Western alliance with 
countries of the former Soviet bloc. 
  Their fears had been fuelled by months of conflicting 
statements from officials and politicians in Russia, ranging 
from support for military cooperation with the West, to outright 
chauvinistic refusal. 
  "But today we are relieved and happy," one diplomat said. 
  British Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind told journalists: 
"It is looking very good. Russia clearly wants to play a 
constructive role, working on issues of common interest." 
  A NATO official said: "Nobody here wants confrontation, 
neither NATO nor the Russians. Everybody here wants to 
cooperate with the Russians." 
  Perry confirmed that a compromise was emerging -- that 
Russia 
would not get the treaty on political relations with NATO that 
it had sought, but could bank on special cooperation on nuclear 
issues such as arms control. 
  Diplomats said this was a face-saving compromise for Russian 
leaders which would allow them to claim at home that the West 
regarded Moscow as a nuclear super-power more influential than 
its East European neighbours. 
  Grachev reiterated that Russia was not insisting on special 
political links with NATO as the price for signing the PFP, 
which has already been joined by 16 countries of the old Soviet 
bloc. 
  But he announced he would present NATO later Wednesday with 
proposals for specific Russia-NATO cooperation, involving a 
"protocol of intention or programmes specific to Russia-NATO 
cooperation." 
  Some countries, particularly the United States, say they do 
not want NATO-Russia links formalised on paper, but to evolve 
depending on Russian cooperation in the PFP programme. 
  A Polish diplomat warned that Warsaw and other East European 
countries would not accept Russian involvement in NATO decisions 
concerning their security. 
  "Our political standpoint is that there should be nothing 
about us without us," he said, citing a Polish proverb. 
  An example of what Poland would not accept, the diplomat 
said, was a proposal from Moscow for joint Russia-NATO security 
guarantees over countries such as Poland. 
  But Perry said fears that NATO and Russia might divide up 
East Europe into Cold War-style spheres of influence were 
"entirely inappropriate and misplaced."

  [Text] The former Cold War enemies, NATO and Russia, are 
working toward cooperation. The main topic of discussion at the 
NATO summit, which opened in Evere this morning [24 May], was 
what form this cooperation should take. At the beginning of the 
year, NATO launched the so-called Partnership for Peace, a form 
of close military cooperation excluding NATO membership. A 
total of 16 former East bloc countries already have accepted the 
invitation. Russia wants to accept as well, but under certain 
conditions. 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter Katelijne Hermans at the 
military 
airport at Melsbroek] Belgian Defense Minister Delcroix is 
waiting for his Russian counterpart. General Pavel Grachev will 
explain to NATO what Russia thinks about military cooperation, 
about the so-called Partnership for Peace. A total of 16 former 
East bloc countries already have accepted the invitation, but 
Russia is hesitating, demanding a special status of its own. 
Furthermore, it bothers the Russians that the Partnership for 
Peace concept originated with the Americans. So, Minister 
Grachev will present to NATO a Russian document on military 
cooperation. The two documents, the Russian and the Western, 
will have to be discussed and signed together. 
  [Grachev, in Russian, with Dutch subtitles] We will sign the 
document on the Partnership for Peace, but we first want to 
explain our vision of military cooperation. A representative of 
President Yelstin will sign the two texts in Brussels, the 
Partnership for Peace and our document on cooperation between 
Russia and NATO. 
  [Hermans] But NATO sees this slightly differently, and feels 
that Russia, like every other country, must sign the normal 
Partnership treaty. Apart from that, a special political 
dialogue can be held. 
  [Delcroix] I believe that every sensible person agrees that 
Russia cannot be compared to other countries. Russia has a 
separate tradition, a separate position, and a separate 
political and military force. We have to take this into 
account. I believe that we in NATO must begin the dialogue with 
Russia, also and perhaps especially outside the Partnership for 
Peace framework. [end recording]

<F P=106> ["fy"-signed report: "For a NATO Partnership With Russia </F>
`Without Any Adjectives'"] 
  [Excerpt] Brussels, 24 May -- The future of relations with 
Russia and the visit of Russian Defense Minister Grachev were at 
the center of the NATO defense ministers' spring summit in 
Brussels on Tuesday [24 May]. Even before the ministers met 
with Grachev in the evening, the ministers' talks mainly 
concentrated on further developments of the alliance's relations 
with Russia. Balanzino, the NATO deputy secretary general, 
chaired the meeting, as Secretary General [Manfred] Woerner had 
followed his doctor's advice not to participate. 
  Defense Minister Volker Ruehe spoke out clearly in favor of 
offering Russia a "partnership without adjectives" such as 
"strategic," "pragmatic," "cooperative," or "privileged." As 
Russia cannot become a member of NATO, the alliance must offer 
it a comprehensive partnership within and outside the 
Partnership for Peace that corresponds with its importance. 
After the first round of talks in Brussels on Tuesday, Ruehe 
reported that he agrees with U.S. Secretary of Defense Perry 
that the alliance should enter into a general foreign and 
security policy dialogue with Russia. The nuclear issues and 
proliferation of nuclear weapons should not be discussed by the 
United States and Russia alone in the future, but by Russia and 
NATO as a whole. On relations between NATO and Russia, however, 
Ruehe said it is out of the question to grant Russia a de facto 
right to veto alliance resolutions, to allow Moscow to impede 
NATO's capacity to act, or to subordinate the alliance to the 
Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). 
"Cooperative relations of partnership within and outside of 
Partnership for Peace are the key to security and stability in 
Europe," Ruehe said. Russia must be treated as a great power 
and a partner, but it must gain its neighbors' confidence by 
itself, whether they be "distant" or "near" neighbors. This 
requires acknowledging their sovereignty and the inviolability 
of their borders. It is NATO's task to give Russia as much help 
as it can in a difficult situation. But the Atlantic alliance 
must watch out for false partners. 
  Ruehe recommended that it should be made clear to Russia 
that 
its participation in the Partnership for Peace is important. 
Moscow should sign the framework agreement without additional 
conditions or changes. This includes the willingness to aim at 
a comprehensive cooperation between NATO troops and the Russian 
Armed Forces. The practical part of the Partnership for Peace 
is to focus on promoting military cooperation. Even if it is 
given the same status as the other partners, Russia has the 
possibility to acquire a position that corresponds with its 
size, importance, and potential. Outside the Partnership for 
Peace, relations should focus on the dialogue on political and 
strategic issues. In this connection it is important that the 
dialogue between NATO and Russia is transparent. If this is 
safeguarded, it will be possible to convince the partners in 
Central and East Europe of the importance of cooperating with 
Russia. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Brussels, May 26 (AFP) -- Russia is not setting any 
conditions for its membership in NATO's Partnership for Peace 
(PFP) programme, but will still await the alliance's response to 
its proposals for cooperation before signing up, Defence 
Minister Pavel Grachev said Thursday [26 May]. 
  He presented a set of propositions to the North Atlantic 
Treaty Alliance Wednesday on cooperation, notably on creating a 
mechanism for consultation on security in Europe and throughout 
the world, and on increased military and political cooperation. 
  A well-placed NATO source said Wednesday that the Russian 
minister proposed levels of participation proportional to 
Moscow's military weight, indicating an enthusiasm exceeding all 
expectations. 
  "We thought (Russia) was only prepared to dabble its toe in 
the PFP, but Grachev indicated it was ready to dive in," the 
NATO source said. 
  But Grachev also called for a formal system of consultations 
between Moscow and NATO on European and world security. 
  He reiterated Russia's wish for regular and automatic 
meetings with NATO at all political and military levels. 
  The Atlantic alliance is resisting any formal commitment to 
such consultations. 
  "NATO is not ready or willing to give any droit de regard 
(right of influence) or even worse a veto over its activities," 
NATO deputy secretary general Sergio Balanzino told a press 
conference Wednesday. 
  Balanzino, the chairman of Wednesday's meeting, suggested 
that NATO was willing to accept the evolution of a "constructive 
and substantial dialogue" if Russia embraced the military 
partnership. 
  But NATO rejected a treaty formalising bilateral relations 
with Russia, although it did not rule out a less formal 
declaration when Moscow signs the PFP.

  [Text] Paris, May 26 (AFP) -- A two-day conference of 57 
countries opened here Thursday [26 May] with the aim of defusing 
possible new wars in Europe by settling potential border 
disputes and solving the problems of minorities. 
  The conference, opened by UNESCO director general Federico 
Mayor at the organisation's headquarters here, is the brainchild 
of French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur. 
  It will aim to frame a Stability Pact which would be signed 
by the end of the year for potential new candidates to the 
European Union (EU). 
  Russia is respresented at the conference by Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev and the United States by Undersecretary of State 
for Political Affairs Peter Tarnoff. 
  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe has said the summit aims 
to settle border and minority problems between "countries with 
the vocation of entering the EU," following the collapse of the 
Soviet bloc.

  [Text] Vienna, May 26 (AFP) -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed Wednesday [25 May] that no 
plutonium was missing from a Japanese factory processing nuclear 
fuel. 
  Some 70 kilograms (154 pounds) of plutonium, enough to make 
nine nuclear bombs, had in fact accumulated as "hold-up" in dust 
form on exposed surfaces of processing areas, the IAEA said in a 
statement. 
  "The IAEA has been well aware of the presence of this 
material throughout, which has been fully declared as hold-up by 
the operator and is measured by the IAEA on a monthly basis, 
using a specially-designed system," the statement said. 
  In other respects, the Tokai-mura plant northeast of Tokyo 
was a highly-automated facility with the most advanced nuclear 
material accountancy system in existence, providing information 
to the IAEA on the movement and quantities of such material on a 
near real-time basis, the nuclear watchdog said. 
  The plant operators had decided to leave the deposited 
hold-up where it was since the plant opened in October 1988 to 
minimise radiation exposure to personnel, the IAEA said. 
  However with a view to improving the quality of the 
measurements the IAEA had urged the necessity of collecting the 
hold-up material and a schedule for this was currently being 
worked out with the Japanese authorities, the statement added. 
  The Washington-based Nuclear Control Institute, a 
nongovernmental organisation, said on May 9 that the plant 
should be closed until the problem is solved. 
  NCI president Paul Leventhal said there was no proof that 
Japan was diverting plutonium for a weapons program. But he 
asked the IAEA to closely monitor the Japanese facility. 
  A plant spokesman rebutted the demand for the shutdown on 
May 
11, saying, "There is nothing unclear about what are strictly 
residuals in the production process. We have made efforts to 
reduce them and we will." 
  Leventhal said the NCI had sent a letter to U.S. Secretary 
of 
State Warren Christopher urging him to take the matter up with 
Japan as most of the plutonium being used at the plant came from 
the United States. 
  According to press reports, the IAEA was concerned because 
the instrument monitoring the amount of plutonium in the 
production process had a margin of error between 10 and 15 
percent. 
  It means that for every 70 kilograms of plutonium counted, 
some eight kilograms, enough for a nuclear bomb, could have 
escaped detection.

  [Text] Vienna, May 26 (AFP) -- Talks between nuclear 
inspectors and North Korea on the monitoring of fuel rods and 
regular inspections of the Yongbyon nuclear reactor resumed here 
Thursday [26 May], a spokesman for the International Atomic 
Energy Agnecy (IAEA) said. He said the talks, which began 
Wednesday, were expected to continue through Friday. 
  The North Korean Government has so far refused to allow IAEA 
inspectors to monitor the refueling of its five-megawatt reactor 
at Yongbyon, the country's only nuclear power plant located 90 
kilometres (55 miles) north of the capital Pyongyang. 
  IAEA inspectors on Wednesday completed maintenance work on 
surveillance equipment installed at the plant and were allowed 
to take samples from a nuclear reprocessing plant, also at 
Yongbyon. The samples should allow the Agency to determine 
whether plutonium could have been manufactured or diverted, 
possibly for use in making nuclear bombs. 
  The inspectors, however, arrived after North Korea had begun 
refueling its Yongbyong reactor and some of the 8,000 fuel rods 
had already been removed. The IAEA charged that by starting the 
refueling before the arrival of the inspectors, North Korea was 
in violation of IAEA inspection terms and that the Agency would 
inform the UN Security Council for possible punitive sanctions. 
  The Agency added, however, that it was still possible to 
take 
samples from the spent fuel rods to determine whether plutonium 
was diverted for military purposes.

reduction of its powers to initiate legislation was proposed 
last night by Britain's European Minister, Mr David 
Heathcoat-Amory. 
  He gave the first insight into the radical reforms that 
Britain will seek at the 1996 inter-governmental conference on 
the future of Europe to try to hold back its centralising 
tendencies. 
  Mr Heathcoat-Amory suggested that instead of a flood of 
often 
unwanted legislation from Brussels, the Council of Ministers 
should agree a programme each year based on suggestions from the 
Commission and after consultations with the European parliament. 
The Commission would then oversee its implementation in member 
states. 
  He also questioned the proliferation of Commissioners, whose 
number is set to rise to 21 with the accession of four new 
countries to the EC, and urged the next President of the 
Commission after M Jacques Delors to place internal management 
and restructuring at the centre of his concerns. 
  "This is not a suggestion made to try and weaken or derail 
the European Union or to deny the Commission the powers they 
need," Mr Heathcoat-Amory said. 
  "The need is rather to recognise that the European Union has 
entered a new phase. There is now a substantial body of 
European law. The emphasis should be on simplification, respect 
for subsidiarity and ensuring compliance." 
  Mr Heathcoat-Amory, addressing the European Policy Forum in 
London, said the case for a serious review of the Commission had 
been established. Like many governments, it had caught the bug 
of over-legislation . 
  Although the Commission does not pass its own laws once it 
had made a proposal and launched a draft measure, it often 
became impossible to stop, only to amend and modify. 
  "The legislation acquires a momentum of its own... Other 
considerations, like cost, intrusiveness, effect of other 
legislation and practicality, often take a back seat," said Mr 
Heathcoat-Amory. "Too much legislation of the wrong sort can 
weaken and discredit the European Union it is designed to 
promote."

<F P=106> [Rory Watson report: "Brussels Covers Up $18 Million Golden </F>
Handshake Plan"] 
  [Text] Controversial plans to give golden handshakes to 
several hundred senior European Commission officials, at a cost 
to taxpayers of up to $18.4 million a year, have secretly been 
put on hold until after June's European parliamentary elections. 
  Senior Commission officials feared a backlash of public 
criticism at the very moment when governments are urging voters 
to take an active part in the Union to elect new members to the 
European Parliament. 
  The scheme, first mooted this month by Karel van Miert, the 
commissioner for personnel, would have opened the door for up to 
450 senior staff to retire early on 70 per cent pay. Their 
desks are needed to make room for newcomers from the four 
applicant countries due to join the Union on 1 January next year. 
  But the idea sparked off a fierce revolt from Van Miert's 
colleagues. The commissioner was told in no uncertain terms 
what the likely public relations consequences of such a move 
would be. He was told to come back by the end of July with 
other less politically and financially damaging ways of 
integrating into the Commission the new officials from Austria, 
Finland, Sweden and Norway. 
  Senior advisers representing other commissioners also raised 
serious doubts over the original estimate that 1,800 posts, 
ranging from senior administrators to secretaries and 
messengers, plus a further 900 research and linguistic staff, 
will need to be created in the three years following the arrival 
of the four in the Union. 
  One senior member of the commission staff said: "Who says we 
need this number of new officials? You cannot say just because 
a country has such a size of population it should have so many 
officials. We have to justify them in concrete terms, according 
to the tasks to be done. Also, do we really need to use costly 
golden handshakes?" 
  Golden handshakes are not new to the Union. They have been 
dangled in front of senior officials in Union institutions every 
time new countries join. 
  First used in 1973 when Britain, Ireland and Denmark became 
members, they were most recently applied in 1980 when Spain and 
Portugal entered the then European Community. 
  On previous occasions, to qualify for a guaranteed 70 per 
cent of their final salary until retirement officials had to be 
more than 55 and to have worked for the Commission, Parliament 
or Council of Ministers for at least ten years. 
  Ironically, despite the growing hostility within the 
Commission to golden handshakes, some predict pressure for the 
scheme from the European Parliament's political groups. 
  For them, it would be a simple ruse to encourage flagging 
senior staff to leave after the elections, paving the way for 
the promotion of younger colleagues. 
  Ensuring a suitable contingent of Union officials is not 
just 
a matter of national pride for governments. It also guarantees 
their influence and views are represented in the various 
institutions. With Austria and the three Scandinavian countries 
set to be net contributors to the EU (European Union) budget 
they are certain to insist on a sizeable number of 
Euro-officials. 
  The dilemma facing the Commission of satisfying these 
demands 
without unduly inflating its own staff or wasting public money 
is a direct, but unforeseen, result of the drive by EU 
government leaders to bring the four new countries into the 
Union from next year. 
  "They pushed to have these countries in the Union," said one 
official. "Now let's see if they are prepared to pay for it. 
Governments not only have to give their financial go-ahead for 
new staff posts they must also approve the special legislation 
needed for the golden handshakes." 
  Under Van Miert's scheme, half of the l,800 enlargement jobs 
would be met by creating permanent posts. Of the remainder, 
half would come through golden handshakes and the rest through 
the normal departures. 
  Nor do Commission officials believe relying on turnover 
would 
defuse the debate. "About 300 people a year leave the 
Commission. If we reserved the posts for the new applicants, it 
would mean that when nationalities left they would be replaced 
by Austrians and Scandinavians," said a senior official.

<F P=106> [Report by Philippe Engels: "The Prime Minister Has a </F>
Little Taste of Popularity"] 
  [Text] For the first time since the establishment of the 
Survey and Action L'ECHO opinion polls almost two years ago, the 
record of the Dehaene government's operation is deemed to be 
positive by a narrow majority of the managers questioned. 
  The April 1994 poll reveals that 51 percent of managers 
think 
the Dehaene government's action is "fairly positive," 46 percent 
regard it as "fairly negative," and 3 percent prefer not to give 
an opinion. Compared with December 1993, these results have 
only slightly changed, but enough to give the federal executive 
the support of the managers' "majority." 
  What should be pointed out is that after seeming to be very 
unpopular for several months, the government has gradually won 
back credibility among the economic decisionmakers. Witness the 
fact that in December 1992, after nearly one year in government, 
it only received a 28 percent favorable rating; in April 1993 
that percentage was no more than 18 percent (with a 78 percent 
unfavorable rating). The recovery, which is fairly clear, took 
shape in December 1993 after the overall plan was made official 
(46 percent favorable rating, 49 percent unfavorable rating). 
  The prime minister's personality is a contributory factor. 
To the question: "Do you have confidence in the following 
institutions to solve the current problems (federal government, 
prime minister, regional and community executives, political 
parties, European Commissions...)," Jean-Luc Dehaene enjoys the 
greatest score of confidence. Fifty-five percent of managers 
say they have confidence in him, compared to 51 percent in 
December 1993 and only 28 percent in April 1993. The federal 
government receives a 41 percent favorable rating in this sphere 
(compared to 22 percent a year ago). It is outstripped by the 
European Commission (45 percent), which has nonetheless dropped 
compared to April 1993 (50 percent). The Belgian Parliament is 
unchanged with a 31 percent favorable rating. With 12 and 8 
percent expressing confidence in them, the political parties and 
the politicians in general have gone a little further down the 
scale of perception by the economic decisionmakers. 
  In passing, we should note here that the regional and 
community governments enjoy less credibility (levels of 
confidence of 37 and 35 percent, compared to 43 and 39 percent a 
year ago). Just three out of every 10 managers think the record 
of the ministers in their region is positive, compared with a 
proportion of four out of 10 in April 1993. 
  Overall, although the federal government's popularity has 
increased a little, the economic decisionmakers have a fairly 
negative or even very negative overall judgement of political 
circles. 
  It is therefore not surprising that the current efficacy of 
our government in terms of the handling of contemporary problems 
should suffer discredit as a result. More than 60 percent of 
managers do not think that Belgium will be able to satisfy the 
Maastricht objective, aimed at reducing the overall public 
deficit to 3 percent of GDP by 1996. Compared with last 
December, this percentage has not changed (which is logical, 
because the spring budget changes were only modest adjustment 
operations). Compared with April 1993, pessimism has increased. 
  In addition, almost 100 percent (98 percent to be precise) 
of 
the sample think it likely that unemployment will increase in 
the coming months. Ninety percent expect a reduction in the 
purchasing power of cadres, 58 percent expect major social 
conflicts, 51 percent a political crisis, 31 percent an erosion 
of the Belgian franc, however only 25 percent expect an increase 
in inflation. 
  As was the case last December, more economic decisionmakers 
think that Belgium is "fairly ill-equipped" (51 percent) than 
"fairly well equipped" (45 percent) to face the near future. In 
April 1993, the proportions were reversed.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Bolkestein Expresses Doubts About </F>
`Purple' Coalition"] 
  [Text] "The subjects we have to discuss are difficult in 
themselves," Bolkestein, VVD [People's Party for Freedom and 
Democracy] leader, stated on Tuesday [24 May] evening. He was 
referrring to progress on forming a government following 
discussions with his fellow party leaders and the three 
politicians charged by the Crown to assess the feasibility of 
the various coalitions. This was the first time that Bolkestein 
had expressed any doubts regarding the chances of achieving a 
"purple" coalition [composed of the Democrats 66, D66, the Labor 
Party, PvdA, and the VVD]. He had previously refrained from 
making any judgment. 
  Bolkestein indicated that the negotiations proper have not 
yet begun. Leaving the First Chamber, where talks are being 
held, PvdA leader Kok said "we have listed all the subjects that 
need to be discussed." Bolkestein said later: "That is 
somewhat of an exaggeration on the part of Mr. Kok. There are 
subjects which we have not yet looked at." 
  The VVD leader stated that the talks are still in their 
initial phase and they have not yet gotten down to discussing 
the details. Bolkestein: "And as you know, it is in the 
details that the problems lie." When asked why the process has 
to take so long, he replied: "Because it is so difficult." He 
said that he did not know when the negotiations proper would be 
able to begin. Addressing the assembled journalists, he quoted 
an Arab saying: "It is difficult to predict anything, 
especially about the future." 
  The D66's Van Mierlo, the last of the group to leave the 
building, was rather more optimistic. He termed the talks 
"fruitful." "It is a typical example of a fruitful process." 
  Are the negotiators rather fearful of the prospect of 
beginning the negotiations proper? Van Mierlo: "No, this is a 
calm, prudent approach. Tomorrow, I believe it will be tougher. 
We are probing deeper all the time. Tomorrow we are going to 
really get down to discussing specific points rather than taking 
stock of the situation." 
  The politicians responsible for assessing the coalitions' 
feasibility drew up an agenda last Wednesday based on the 
subjects raised by the party leaders. They are now putting the 
finishing touches to a timetable covering around 20 meeting 
hours. According to this timetable, a provisional assessment of 
the situation should be made on Friday. Then they will be able 
to reply to the question as to whether there is any point in 
pursuing the attempt to form a "purple" coalition.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Slow Growth for Netherlands </F>
Economy"] 
  [Text] The growth of the Netherlands economy in the next 
few years looks set to be just above the European average, while 
Europe as a whole is going to lag behind Japan and the United 
States. These forecasts are made in the report entitled "Europe 
in 1998," published today by the Netherlands Economic Institute 
in Rotterdam. 
  The Netherlands economy will grow by 1.9 percent until 1998, 
while the European Union (EU) average will grow by 1.8 percent, 
the institute predicts. The recovery of the European economy 
thus looks set to be far from vigorous and will certainly not be 
enough to solve the unemployment problem. After 1996, growth is 
even set to fall off again, according to the institute's 
computing models. During the period 1992-1998, the United States 
and Japan should experience a 2.6 percent growth. 
  Europe must come to terms with the fact that most growth is 
going to come from Asia and the developing countries, the 
researchers write. These countries are set to experience growth 
of 6.9 percent and 4 percent, respectively, over the same 
period. The report states that it will not be enough to count 
on technological innovation alone. New products must also be 
linked to new forms of services, and at low prices. Europe must 
develop new mass consumer goods. Education, technology and, 
most importantly, the transfer of technical know-how must all be 
stimulated. As in the NAFTA countries (United States, Canada 
and the developing country Mexico), benefit must be drawn from 
the low labor costs in East Europe by closely involving the East 
European countries in the EU.

  Text] Reports that the Malaysian Government was set to end 
its ban on public contracts for British businesses were welcomed 
by the Foreign Office today. "We shall be delighted if these 
reports prove to be true," a spokesman said. 
  This followed a reported meeting between Richard Needham, 
the 
British Trade Minister, with his counterpart Rafidah Aziz in 
Kuala Lumpur. Mr. Aziz was quoted as saying: "I am confident 
that it will be lifted, but as for the timing, we cannot say." 
  The row blew up after the SUNDAY TIMES printed a story in 
February claiming a British construction company was prepared to 
offer Malaysian Premier Mohamad Mahathir a 35,000 pounds 
sterling bribe to secure a building contract. 
  This was fiercely denied by Mr. Mahathir at a time when a 
controversy was raging over 234 million pounds sterling British 
aid for the Pergau Dam, and claims that this was, wrongly, 
linked to Britain's hopes of securing a 1 billion pounds 
sterling arms deal with Malaysia. 
  Downing Street today denied a report that Mr Needham had 
handed Mr Mahathir a letter from Prime Minister John Major. 
"There was no such letter," a spokesman for No. 10 [Downing 
St.] said, "although Mr Major's office and the Malaysian Prime 
Minister's office have kept in close touch." 
  Mr. Needham is expected back in Britain some time tomorrow. 
  Malaysia imposed its damaging ban some three months ago 
after 
British newspaper reports that trade between the two countries 
was tainted by corruption. However, there were promising signs 
over the weekend when Mr Mahathir said that British media 
reporting on Malaysia had "improved". 
  "We are encouraged to see these reports coming out of 
Malaysia," the Foreign Office spokesman added. 
  There is no doubt that British business has been hit hard by 
this ban. The British Government has always said that it has no 
control over what appears in British newspapers.

<F P=106> ["C.G."-signed report: "A Stability Pact For EU Aspirants"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn, 25 May -- On Thursday and Friday [26 and 27 
May], several foreign ministers are meeting in Paris to prepare 
the ground for a "stability pact." French Prime Minister 
Balladur had suggested such a pact to help defuse border and 
minority problems that could lead to conflicts in Central and 
East Europe. Following initial doubts about the use of such a 
comprehensive stability pact for the Central and East European 
states wishing to join the European Union [EU], the EU agreed to 
the French proposal last December. Now the EU considers this to 
be one of its first "joint actions" since the Maastricht Treaty 
came into force. The pact will not take the form of an 
international legal document, but of a declaration of intent. 
Bilateral and regional negotiations are to precede the document 
and will be completed in about a year. 
  Taking part in the Paris conference will be the foreign 
ministers of the EU, Central and East European states, the 
United States, Russia, and other members of the CSCE. Prior to 
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel's departure for Paris, the Foreign 
Ministry in Bonn said on Wednesday that basically all 53 CSCE 
member states could participate in the pact. But the EU will 
first concentrate its efforts on those Central and East European 
states that can expect to join the EU in the foreseeable future. 
After the opening conference, national minority issues and 
cross-border cooperation are to be discussed at "regional 
desks." The EU and other interested countries will have to 
participate in these. The CSCE will have to fulfill a special 
task in this, the Foreign Ministry said. 
  Bonn said the Federal Government regards the French proposal 
as supporting measures to move Central, East, and southern 
European states closer to existing European structures, such as 
the EU and the Council of Europe. Balladur is right in 
considering border and minority issues as the key problem in 
European unification. The events in former Yugoslavia 
illustrate this. What will be difficult, however, is putting 
the plan into practice. So far, the ideas are still somewhat 
vague. Prime Minister Balladur is thinking of a system of 
agreements between neighboring states, like the one that was 
established in West Europe after World War II. It is a matter 
of combining individual bilateral agreements that are binding 
under international law into a "stability pact for Europe" that 
would not be legally binding as such. Germany will have the 
task of helping to achieve this during its EU presidency 
starting on 1 July. German efforts in Europe continue to 
concentrate on moving the states of Central and East Europe 
closer to the EU; the enlargement of European authorities should 
not delay this process. The "stability pact" is only part of the 
aspect. It is obvious that border and minority questions have 
to be clarified before new members can join the EU, the Foreign 
Ministry said.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Necker Calls For New Japanese </F>
Strategy"] 
  [Text] In a talk with German newsmen in Tokyo on 20 May, 
German Industry Federation [BDI] President Tyll Necker said it 
would be in Japan's well-understood own interest to "change its 
strategies." The opening of the Japanese market would be the 
appropriate way for a change of trend in the yen price increase. 
If Tokyo were unable to reduce surpluses through deregulation, 
the "only option left" would be "another revaluation of the yen 
as the price for the preservation of restrictive market 
structures," warned Necker. 
  The BDI president acknowledged that the opening process 
initiated in Japan was attributable to the pressure exerted by 
the United States, but said he was opposed to Tokyo giving 
preference to the U.S. partner. "We Europeans want to have the 
same opportunities in Japan as the United States," stressed 
Necker, adding that "Japan's political security interests no 
longer justify giving the United States privileges." 
  Necker, who is in Tokyo for talks with Prime Minister Hata 
and other government members as well as leading Japanese 
business and industry associations, also appealed to the German 
economic sector to see "Japan as an organizational center for 
the whole Far Eastern region." He said that, in this respect, 
more persuasive work had to be done in Germany. 
  Medium-sized industry in particular had to develop a 
strategy 
for Japan, said Necker. A number of such firms had already 
successfully established themselves on the Japanese market. The 
Asia-Pacific Committee of German business and industry and Bonn 
should face the challenge of the Asian market, but in so doing, 
should not only consider China, but should make use of the 
incipient liberalization of the Japanese market.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer by </F>
Rainer Hupe and Annette Littmann in his office in Frankfurt; 
date not given: "We Always Need a Bit of Good Luck"] 
  [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank 
lowered the key interest rates by half a percentage point, more 
than it has done in a long time. Did Federal Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl thank you for this nice election aid? 
  [Tietmeyer] It has nothing to do with an election aid. But 
public reaction, including from the opposition, was mostly 
favorable. By the way, compared with the past, it was not an 
unusually large step. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] It is unusual for the recent past. Despite 
the recession, you lowered the discount rate by a mere quarter 
percentage point several times. 
  [Tietmeyer] Two factors were decisive for us. On the one 
hand, the stability prospects have clearly improved, and the 
German mark is strong. On the other hand, there was too much 
liquidity by the turn of the year, which increases the money 
supply. In addition, owing to the turmoil in international 
financial markets, investors were uncertain about the further 
course of long-term interest rates and waited with their 
investment. We believe that in this situation, lowering 
short-term interest rates could help promote the formation of 
capital. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The liquidity increase was a result of tax 
policy. Capital was deducted from investment funds because of 
the increase of the capital yields tax. 
  [Tietmeyer] Right, tax policy changes initially inflated the 
money supply, and the stimulus for swift reinvestment in the 
capital market was small, given the relatively small difference 
between short- and long-term interest rates and the uncertainty 
I mentioned earlier. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Did the economic cycle play a role in your 
decision? 
  [Tietmeyer] Of course, we always also consider the economic 
situation. However, we do not pursue an anticyclical policy, 
but a longer-term stability policy oriented at the money supply. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Nonetheless, the Bundesbank is the only 
institution able to move something regarding the cycle. Fiscal 
policy is blocked because of budget deficits. In this role, you 
can certainly make policy. 
  [Tietmeyer] It is the Bundesbank's role to create stable 
conditions for growth. That is our task, and we think it is the 
best way to serve the economic cycle. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] How do you assess the current cyclical 
situation? Officials in Bonn are already talking about 
recovery. The mood there seems to be much better than the 
situation. 
  [Tietmeyer] Export orders have been increasing for some time 
now. Capacity utilization in German industry is increasing 
again, business expectations are clearly improving. These are 
important conditions for the second step of the classical German 
recovery pattern -- an increase in the domestic investment 
demand -- to follow. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Has recovery set in, or are these only initial 
signs? 
  [Tietmeyer] The first step can be seen. Now we hope that 
the domestic investment demand will increase soon. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] This is influenced by interest rates. Was 
this the reason you agreed to lower the interest rates 
substantially? 
  [Tietmeyer] The real interest rates have been relatively low 
for some time, including long-term interest rates, which are 
particularly important for investment financing. On the 
monetary side, we do not see any obstacle to economic recovery. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Are commercial banks hindering recovery? They 
have been accused time and again of failing to pass on, or pass 
on in time, interest rate cuts. 
  [Tietmeyer] In a highly competitive banking system, changes 
in refinancing conditions will be passed on -- regarding both 
debit and credit interest. Perhaps this could occasionally have 
been done faster. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] When, for instance? 
  [Tietmeyer] When we lowered our minimum reserves, it took 
some time for the markets to react. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] We have the impression that you changed your 
opinion within two weeks. You said early in May that the danger 
of inflation was not yet banned, and therefore, the Bundesbank 
had to "proceed very carefully." 
  [Tietmeyer] This impression is clearly wrong. There is no 
change in our argument. We also proceeded carefully at this 
time. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Your counterpart, Hans-Juergen Koebnick, the 
president of the Land Central Bank of Rhineland-Palatinate and 
Saarland, early this month called for clear interest rate cuts 
by at least half a percentage point. Did he and his group of 
supporters assert themselves in the Central Bank Council? 
  [Tietmeyer] There are no groups in the Central Bank Council, 
but personages with independent minds. It is in the Central 
Bank Council that opinions are formed and decisions made. In 
this case, a Central Bank Council member announced his opinion 
in advance. I prefer such discussions being held within the 
Central Bank Council. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] How much will the key interest rates have to 
be lowered for the cycle to accelerate? 
  [Tietmeyer] Our recent decision has cleared the horizon for 
the next few months. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Until after the summer recess? 
  [Tietmeyer] We are examining the situation continuously, but 
now we must wait and see how the monetary situation in our 
country is developing. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] In recent months, you revised your interest 
rate decisions almost every month. In all these cases, the 
impression was promptly created that something had to be 
improved in this respect. 
  [Tietmeyer] Revised and improved are not the correct terms. 
We took cautious steps. I cannot make a decision that applies 
indefinitely. We do think, however, that the state of affairs is 
quite acceptable in the foreseeable future. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The impression has been created that the 
Bundesbank is lacking orientation and fails to act on a 
long-term basis. 
  [Tietmeyer] This impression is wrong and is not reflected in 
the reaction of the markets. The German mark has remained 
externally strong and has internally stabilized. The rate of 
inflation is decreasing. It is now important for us to get the 
money supply expansion under control. We had to abandon the 
high interest rate level, without creating new inflationary 
dangers, and without jeopardizing the German mark in proportion 
to other currencies. We had an interest rate advance over the 
United States of more than 6 percent. This lead has meanwhile 
decreased to approximately 1 percent, without the external value 
of the German mark having been jeopardized. I consider this a 
mark of confidence. The international markets have realized that 
the Bundesbank has not changed and will not change its course. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] You personally contributed your share to 
create such uncertainty by publishing the money supply figure in 
January. It was thoughtless not to comment on the more than 20 
percent expansion. As a result, the financial markets were 
plunged in turmoil. 
  [Tietmeyer] The turmoil had begun a day earlier in the 
United States. Nonetheless, the January publication was by no 
means an excellent performance of the Bundesbank. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Will you keep to the money supply target in 
1994? Your target is between 4 and 6 percent. In each of the 
first three months, you had two-digit growth rates. 
  [Tietmeyer] We will see by the end of the year. As usual, 
we will review our annual target in the light of the information 
available in July. Even if we exceed our own annual target 
once, this does not automatically spell the danger of 
inflationary development. In the past, we also occasionally 
exceeded our target. It very much depends on how -- in the 
eighties, for instance -- the money supply grows over a 
medium-term period, and medium-term does not mean 12 months. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] If it had happened just once; 1994 would be 
the third time in a row. 
  [Tietmeyer] But the extent to which we missed the target 
differed considerably in each case. In addition, we had quite a 
number of special factors -- German unity, exchange rate 
turmoil, interventions, new tax laws, and so on. This 
substantially complicated a precise control of the money supply. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Would it then not have been better to at 
least suspend the money supply concept temporarily or find an 
entirely new concept? 
  [Tietmeyer] Definitely not. Look at the results of other 
central banks in comparison with ours. As a general tendency, 
we have always had better results. However, the money supply is 
not a robot that could tell us in any given situation what to do. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Critics have accused the Bundesbank of giving 
priority to monetary stability for too long, regardless of the 
cycle at home and in the other EU [European Union] member states 
on which high interest rates were imposed. 
  [Tietmeyer] We do not see price stability as an isolated 
factor. However, without restoring monetary stability in 
Germany, we can neither achieve longer term growth nor a longer 
term improvement in employment conditions. That is also 
important for Europe. Of course, we do not live on an island, 
but in an international community and must therefore consider 
well the repercussions of our policy on others. That is what we 
have done, even though one can always argue on the degree. 
However, I have heard no criticism of our policy from other 
European countries for some time now, and even less from my 
counterparts. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] You were lucky to be able to lower the 
interest 
rates now. If the dollar were stronger, the Bundesbank could 
not ignore the increasing U.S. interest rates. 
  [Tietmeyer] We always need a bit of good luck. But I think 
we have less a weak dollar than a stable German mark. Regarding 
the dollar, the situation is indisputably a specific one. On 
the one hand, this has something to do with the controversies 
between the United States and Japan, and on the other, with the 
discussion in the United States on whether or not there are 
longer term dangers of inflation. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Has the trade war between the United States 
and Japan shifted to the financial markets? Or can you explain 
the weakness of the dollar? 
  [Tietmeyer] I do not have a complete explanation. But it 
also seems to have something to do with the reactions of 
Japanese investors. The situation in Japan tempts people 
increasingly to keep some of their old yen holdings, or reinvest 
them in the yen. In addition, much depends on how the dispute 
between Japan and the United States will continue. Over the 
longer term, the development of external balances is important. 
There is the continuing surplus in Japan and again an 
increasing deficit in the United States, whereas our deficit is 
gradually decreasing. This is apparently also reflected in the 
exchange rates. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] You had to support the dollar again recently. 
Is new turmoil imminent in the international monetary system? 
  [Tietmeyer] We all have an interest in quiet currency 
markets. Extreme fluctuations are never good. I do not think 
there will be monetary turmoil. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The U.S. Federal Reserve Board has increased 
interest rates once again. Does this mean that further interest 
rate cuts in Germany are blocked? 
  [Tietmeyer] Our decisions depend above all on developments 
in our own country. Uncertainty in international markets has 
also interfered with the readiness for capital formation in 
Germany in recent months. The recent U.S. decision has now 
created welcome clarity. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Tietmeyer, thank you for this interview.

    [Editorial report] Munich ARD Television Network in German 
at 1958-2020 GMT on 25 May carries an interview with Social 
Democratic Party [SPD] Chairman Rudolf Scharping by Luc 
Jochimsen and Nikolaus Brender on the outcome of the 
presidential election and the SPD's political goals for the 16 
October Bundestag election. Scharping outlines the changes in 
domestic policy if the SPD were to win the majority and he were 
to become next chancellor. 
  Asked by Luc Jochimsen whether he was still disappointed at 
the outcome of the 23 May presidential election, Scharping says 
that he is, "because there can be no doubt that Johannes Rau 
would have been an excellent president for Germany." He adds, 
however, that one "has to live with defeats" in politics. The 
decision is legitimate, he says, and "like any upright democrat 
we will loyally cooperate with the new president." 
  Nikolaus Brender confronts Scharping with an earlier 
statement of his according to which the Free Democratic Party 
[FDP] would no longer be needed after the next Bundestag 
election, arguing that this was an indirect statement in favor 
of a coalition between the SPD and the Greens after the 
Bundestag election. Scharping replies: "No, on the contrary. 
In the presidential election the FDP did what it did. Yet, 
this does not mean that all doors have been closed." Scharping 
believes that on the election night "the supply of coalition 
partners will be greater than the demand, which reduces the 
price, or to put it more politely, will make negotiations 
easier." Scharping adds that "politically, things will change 
for the better in Germany only when the SPD becomes the 
strongest party; this is what we are concentrating on, while 
everything else will have to be decided after 16 October." 
  Scharping then criticizes the economic situation in Germany 
arguing that at the moment there is "a deficit of 5 million 
competitive jobs, that many young families are looking for 
affordable accommodation," and that "1 million children are 
growing up in this country with the experience of parents being 
on social welfare." Jochimsen argues that the CDU [Christian 
Democratic Union] also wants to create more jobs and build more 
apartments, but Scharping discards that, emphasizing that the 
coalition is cutting social benefits and funds for social 
housing. He says that "Helmut Kohl's government has 
dramatically reduced the funds for active labor market policy," 
thus having cut "an additional 700,000 jobs." 
  The SPD chairman is asked how he would finance his social 
program. Scharping argues that raising taxes is unimaginative, 
considering that "taxes jumped up dramatically in the past four 
years" anyway, with the main burden having been put on employed 
people. "What we want is to shift funds around in the budget 
but not raise the quota of taxes and rates, because this quota 
is indeed high enough." Funds have to be increased for "more 
economic growth, more demand, and more investments," since 
"without these three elements we will not be able to create new 
jobs" and will "not be competitive in the future." Scharping 
does not go into detail but says that high-income earners, "the 
top 20 percent of the income pyramid" would have to pay higher 
taxes. He reiterates the importance of "creating growth," 
because otherwise it would not be able to create jobs or 
consolidate the state finances. "Some 2,000 billion German 
marks [DM] in public debts, or DM65,000 for every German" are 
the absolute limit. 
  Jochimsen argues that she does not have the impression that 
people really feel it is time for a change, and she makes 
reference to U.S. President Clinton's election campaign. 
Scharping stresses that the Bundestag election campaign has not 
started yet but says that "I agree it is time for a change." He 
says that "it is a great challenge" to modernize the economy, 
seek social justice, and pursue a consistent environmental 
policy. "I am absolutely convinced" that this change will take 
place in Germany. He says that the SPD is currently standing at 
39 percent in surveys, and in the European election on 12 June 
we will see whether the SPD will manage to "convince and 
mobilize more and more people, and to make it clear that in this 
country we need more solidarity, more shared responsibility, and 
less egotism," which "as I would say, has spread terribly under 
the Kohl government." 
  Brender asks why the voters should want to change the 
government, considering that the economy is beginning to 
recover, a fact that could reduce the SPD's chances. Scharping 
asserts that the SPD's chances "have so far not decreased and 
will not decrease." He argues that as far as growing demand 
from abroad is concerned, Germany is currently "reaping the 
fruits of a better economic policy in other countries." 
Scharping says that Germany needs "a new founding era," "new 
enterprises, new investments," and a "dynamic development of the 
domestic economy." He says he is sorry that the economic 
situation does not look too good at the moment, adding that "I 
am happy about any improvement." However, "if the number of 
unemployed grows by 500,000 this year, one can hardly speak of 
economic upswing." He notes that "we are still a long way from 
recovery for everybody, and, I fear that with the policy that 
has been pursued so far we will not get recovery for all." 
  Mrs. Jochimsen refers to surveys that predict an increase 
in support for the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS] in the 
new laender and asks Rudolf Scharping why he is shying away from 
confrontation with the PDS. Scharping argues that he is not, 
noting that "for us the PDS is more than the normal political 
opponent." He adds that he is taking people in eastern Germany 
and their concerns "very seriously." "I go there a lot and talk 
to many people, and I do not just go there to turn a lever and 
open a new plant." He emphasizes that people in the new laender 
must also be aware that "each vote for the PDS may be 
understandable" as a result of the developments and 
disappointments of the past three years, "but democracy does not 
live on democracy or rage, but on the resolve to change things," 
and "anybody who votes for the PDS will strengthen the current 
situation and weaken the chances for change." Without wanting 
to discredit the party's supporters, Scharping maintains that 
the PDS is the "direct successor to the old Socialist Unity 
Party of Germany [SED], and has directly taken over the former 
SED cadres, the former assets, and many other things, and even 
the old policies." 
  Returning to the tax issue, Scharping points out that 
"German 
unification is currently financed basically by debts and by 
contributions to social security," rejecting that German 
unification be merely financed by employed people; self-employed 
people, such as dentists, politicians, and public servants, he 
says, must also contribute. Scharping says that considering the 
significant social cuts under the current government, the SPD 
would "not agree to any further reduction in social benefits." 
  Scharping speaks out in favor of "stronger direct 
participation" of the citizens in the political decisionmaking 
process, such as referendums and petitions for referendums. He 
says that this issue will be brought up in the SPD's election 
campaign, and criticizes the coalition government for 
obstructing any SPD suggestions in this direction. Scharping 
says that in his state, Rhineland-Palatinate, mayors would be 
elected directly in the future. 
  In conclusion, Scharping announces the SPD's motto for the 
future: "A just, tolerant, and peaceful Germany."

  [Text] Cologne (DDP/ADN) --The SPD [Social Democratic Party 
of Germany] and its candidate for chancellor, Rudolf Scharping, 
have lost their lead in popularity over Chancellor Helmut Kohl 
and the CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Socialist 
Union] five months before the Bundestag elections. This is the 
result of a survey carried out by the Forsa Institute for the 
"RTL- Kanzlerbarometer" program which the RTL TV channel 
published today. According to the survey, Scharping and Kohl are 
neck and neck in popularity among the voters, both at 32 
percent. Thirty-nine percent of Germans would vote CDU/CSU [if 
there were an election] this week, 40 percent would vote SPD, 8 
percent Alliance 90/Greens, 6 percent FDP [Free Democratic 
Party] and 3 percent for both the PDS [Party of Democratic 
Socialism] and the Republicans. 
  Twenty percent of Germans believe that the Union [CDU/CSU] 
is 
the best suited to solve the country's problems. Only 14 
percent have confidence in the SPD in this respect. The 
majority of Germans (62 percent), however, believe that no party 
is in a position to do so.

<F P=106> [Interview with Johannes Rau, Social Democratic Party </F>
presidential candidate, by Andrea Tarquini; place and date not 
given: "My Germany Without Hate"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- This morning at 1045, in a climate of 
tension and uncertainty, the parliament will meet in Berlin to 
elect Germany's seventh president. Chancellor Kohl's candidate, 
Roman Herzog, is still the favorite, but polemics have continued 
to rage within the coalition: The liberals, divided between 
their loyalty to the government pact and the temptation to vote 
for the opposition's popular candidate, Johannes Rau, warned 
yesterday that they would not give in to pressures. Absolute 
solidity on the part of the CDU [Christian Democratic Union] is 
not guaranteed. Against this background, both candidates are 
placing their stakes on a unitary approach, toning down 
polemical accents. Their positions would look even more similar 
if it were not for the tension resulting from the election 
campaign which is already under way in view of the October 
elections, and for several decades' history of almost bipolar 
democracy. We listened to left-wing opposition candidate 
Johannes Rau, who is the oldest of the regional 
ministers-president as well as the SPD's [Social Democratic 
Party of Germany] senior leader. 
  [Tarquini] In your opinion, what are the next president's 
priority tasks? 
  [Rau] Above all -- I believe -- trying to bring people 
together, to unite the country. Not only the citizens from the 
East and the West, I am also thinking in terms of the huge 
generation gap and of the growing dissension between social 
groups. This will be a difficult task, bearing in mind that the 
president's powers are limited. His greatest asset is the 
spoken word and, in this respect, having as I do almost 40 years 
of experience behind me can be an advantage. 
  [Tarquini] Do you believe Germany requires a new awareness 
as 
a nation? 
  [Rau] Richard von Weizsaecker said that we had to settle 
accounts, in particular, with our history, and he was not alone 
in saying this. We cannot minimize the pain we inflicted on 
other nations by offsetting it against the suffering history 
then inflicted on us. Considering the last 100 years, our 
national sense must necessarily be a bit fragile. As former 
President Gustav Heinemann once said: "If we want others to 
forget what we did to them, we must never forget ourselves." 
  [Tarquini] To what extent is extreme right-wing violence 
dangerous for German democracy? 
  [Rau] There are always a few incorrigible individuals in all 
countries: in France, England, Germany. However, we Germans 
know -- or ought to know -- better than others where 
incorrigibility leads when it becomes widespread. This is why 
we must answer the challenge sensibly. 
  [Tarquini] Is a right-wing turn currently taking place in 
Germany? 
  [Rau] Our country is facing economic problems and social 
tensions as well as their consequences. The extreme Right aims 
to win support in the hotbeds of social tension, where young 
people lack employment prospects. We must combat the causes 
that make young people receptive to such messages, but I do not 
think that extremism is stronger in our country than elsewhere. 
We need more solid barriers, because we have already been 
scalded by experience. 
  [Tarquini] In economic and demographic terms, united Germany 
is the first power in developed Europe. Should it also become 
the first political power? 
  [Rau] I believe that we should not be seeking to fulfill a 
special role in any sense. Clearly, what really matters is that 
we want a European Germany rather than a German Europe. We are 
bound for European integration, because such a large country 
right in the center of Europe will end up being perceived and 
treated as a threat unless it becomes integrated. 
  [Tarquini] Would you agree with your Army being given more 
international responsibilities? 
  [Rau] I believe that Germany must take on a greater share of 
responsibility worldwide, but it remains to be seen whether 
assuming new responsibilities can only be done by sending out 
troops. I do not think that international aid to peacekeeping 
missions can be exclusively military in nature. What I would 
like to see is the establishment of a European peace corps for 
development. 
  [Tarquini] Can a German be a patriot without becoming a 
nationalist? 
  [Rau] Yes. Despite all the tragedies in history, a natural 
relationship to the nation is necessary, and this idea cannot be 
left in the hands of extremists. A patriot is someone who loves 
his fatherland, a nationalist someone who despises other 
people's fatherlands. Being a good patriot is what I 
essentially wish to be. 
  [Tarquini] How long will it take yet for unification to be 
completed? 
  [Rau] Living conditions in the East and the West are still 
marked by differences in many fields. Forty years of division 
have left traces in people's minds and given rise to new 
prejudices. I believe we still have a long way to go before 
people learn to speak to each other without preconceived ideas, 
and learn to understand each other. An investment campaign is 
not enough. Human understanding is the real issue. If I am 
elected, this will be one of my priorities. 
  [Tarquini] Many are demanding a stronger president for 
Germany, elected by the people. Do you agree with this? 
  [Rau] I do not support an American- or French-type 
presidential system. However, if a direct election system is 
eventually introduced, it will be necessary to consider 
broadening the president's authority without thereby changing 
the balances provided for by the constitution.

Succeed Herzog"] 
  [Text] Berlin -- Former Berlin Justice Senator Jutta 
Limbach, Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], is to succeed 
Roman Herzog, Christian Democratic Union [CDU], and become the 
first female president of the Federal Constitutional Court in 
Karlsruhe. Mrs. Limbach has been chairwoman of the Second Panel 
and vice president since March upon the proposal of the SPD. 
  One day after Herzog's election as the new president, 
Wolfgang Schaeuble, chairman of the CDU/Christian Social Union 
[CSU] Bundestag group, stated in Berlin yesterday that it is a 
"tested tradition" that the highest-ranking post of the supreme 
German court is alternated among the parties. 
  The CDU then has the right to suggest a new constitutional 
judge to replace Herzog. In Bonn, jurist and former FRG Defense 
Minister Rupert Scholz was named as a potential candidate.

<F P=106> ["sm"-initialed report: "Rexrodt Reiterates Demand for </F>
Cutting Top Tax Rate"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- Federal Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt, 
of the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP], has called for 
cutting the top income tax rate and the early elimination of the 
solidarity surcharge. By the summer of this year, the Federal 
Government will present the framework of its concept for tax 
policy for the next electoral term, the minister said at the 
annual meeting of the Association of Self-Employed Professionals 
in Berlin. 
  According to the FDP official, the following points have to 
be included in the tax concept: 
  -- The elimination of the split top income tax rate. Rexrodt 
emphasized that it was necessary to return to a single income 
tax rate at a low level, "that is to say clearly beneath 50 
percent." 
  -- The splitting of the top income tax rate should only 
temporarily offset the extra burden on the trade tax until it is 
reformed. Within the framework of the trade tax reform the 
trade capital tax has to be abolished and the trade income tax 
to be reduced. 
  -- The solidarity surcharge, which, according to the plans 
of 
the coalition, will be introduced on 1 January 1995, has to be 
eliminated again at the earliest possible time. Rexrodt 
conceded that as long as it existed, no comprehensive reduction 
of the income and corporate tax were possible under the 
constitutional law. Therefore, he was in favor of putting a 
clear time limit on the surcharge even today. Otherwise this 
surcharge threatens to become a permanent instrument for 
refinancing the state without people remembering in the future 
what its original purpose was. Yet, "this cannot be had with 
the FDP," Rexrodt said. 
  -- Additional tax revenues in the wake of economic growth 
must not serve as extra room for new state spending, but must be 
used for continuing the policy of cutting taxes. 
  The economics minister drew up an optimistic picture of 
economic developments in Germany. From the current point of 
view a growth rate of 1.5 percent is possible for all of 
Germany. "This development might even turn out slightly 
better," the federal economics minister said, the reason for it 
lying in increasing orders from abroad and in a rise in orders 
for the producing industries in eastern Germany.

<F P=106> [Commentary by `gb.': "Insecurity Policy"] </F>
  [Text] The increase in key interest rates in the United 
States was accepted calmly by international financial markets on 
Wednesday [25 May]. But it takes little imagination to picture, 
within a few weeks, new excited discussions about a further hike 
in the interest rate--possibly soon--with all its concomitant 
phenomena such as temporary distortions on the international 
interest rate markets. The problem of U.S. monetary policy is in 
its concept, difficult for the outsider to understand. Hardly 
any analyst at present can recognize in the U.S. economy any 
signals of an increase in the inflation rate. For years the 
Federal Reserve in Washington has no longer attached great 
importance to intermediate targets such as the money supply. 
Instead, it has based its decisions on the course of the 
economic cycle, and lately also on the exchange rate. That, 
however, is a two-edged sword, because a monetary policy based 
on the business cycle or the exchange rate can be afflicted with 
great uncertainties. The U.S. example demonstrates well how a 
monetary policy, hardly comprehensible to outsiders, can cause 
uncertainty on the markets. This may serve as a warning to all 
those who recommend that the Bundesbank, for the sake of a 
short-lived economic effect, deviate from its policy based on 
the longer term.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Jens Eckhardt: "Fear for Jobs; U.S. Central </F>
Bank Signals Temporary Breather"] 
  [Text] After three timid quarter-percent hikes of 
short-term interest rates, the U.S. Federal Reserve--as 
expected--strongly raised both the federal funds rate and the 
discount rate by half a percentage point, as was done the last 
time five years ago. Many large banks reacted immediately by 
hiking their prime rate to which most private adjustable 
interest rate loans are linked. While the markets on Wall Street 
celebrated the interest rate raise as the last parity change for 
the time being with a strong rise in stock prices, the dollar 
remained surprisingly weak. 
  Voices warning about a return to growing unemployment are 
getting louder. Indeed, there are hardly any statistics that 
justify a hike in interest rates in the United States at a time 
when they are dropping in other countries, especially Germany. 
Neither prices nor wages are rising unduly, the overheated 
growth of the fourth quarter is already cooling off perceptibly, 
and tight industrial capacities are still not in sight. Rather, 
only Wall Street and the Federal Reserve heard dissonant 
inflation melodies, which completely upset their elegant 
interest rate and course tango of recent years. As the markets 
see it, the Federal Reserve at first moved too soon with its 
interest steps, and then not fast enough. It appears that with 
the latest move, the Fed and security markets are again in step, 
at least temporarily. 
  The consequences for the economy, however, cannot yet be 
foreseen. In the last months, the rates for long-term fixed 
mortgages rose by two full percentage points. The prime rate, 
officially the standard interest rate for short-term loans to 
major businesses, which today is of much greater importance as 
the computation basis for adjustable interest loans, climbed 
from 6 to 7.25 percent. The number of refinancings of old 
mortgages recently dropped steeply, and new real estate loans 
became so expensive that tens of thousands of home buyers were 
forced out of the market. The predictions for construction of 
new homes this year have already been corrected downward, and 
there are long faces among furniture and home appliance 
manufacturers. 
  How long the Fed will be able to pursue its course, shifted 
from "stimulative" to "economy-neutral," depends on various 
factors. About four-fifths of economic activities in the United 
States are private, the rest are governmental. In view of the 
fact that the government share, which strongly expanded in the 
1980's, has been shrinking since 1991, economic development more 
than ever depends on private enterprise, and hence especially on 
private households. These already suffer from the continued 
downsizing in many companies, and are now additionally facing 
higher loan interest rates. At the moment, nobody knows how this 
will further dampen employment. 
  Also uncomfortable is the weak reaction of the foreign 
exchange markets which assessed the value of the dollar lower, 
despite the opposite interest rate moves in Germany and the 
United States. The threat from this side, which might force the 
Fed into further interest rate hikes, has not yet been averted.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Gerd Brueggemann: "No End to the </F>
Lamentations"] 
  [Text] True, the hike in short-term U.S. interest rates by 
the Federal Reserve Board has greatly diminished the difference 
between interest rates in the United States and Germany. 
However, this does not necessarily mean that the permanent 
complaints by U.S. politicians about the Bundesbank's tight 
credit policy will now be silenced. But it would also be wrong 
to overestimate its importance. 
  In Washington, economic and financial policy measures in 
other countries are examined only seldom for their respective 
causes, but more predominantly for their effects on the U.S. 
economy. From the Washington viewpoint, that seems 
understandable. 
  Since most U.S. politicians, for reasons of reelection, are 
growth-oriented rather than stability-oriented like their German 
counterparts, high interest rates in an important target country 
for U.S. exports, such as Germany, constitute a brake for the 
U.S. economy and are thus an evil worthy of criticism. This 
attitude is essentially based on the opinion that the economic 
policy of industrial countries--for instance, within the 
framework of G-7--should best be guided by the necessities of 
U.S. economic policy. 
  The German finance ministers and presidents of the 
Bundesbank, who on innumerable occasions had to listen to such 
U.S. lamentations, when in doubt have always turned a friendly 
deaf ear and presented what they saw as right in the interest of 
their own country. That was, and probably is, the only 
appropriate reaction.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Udo Bergdoll: "Kohl's Luck With Kinkel"] </F>
  [Text] The election of Roman Herzog as federal president 
marks the end of the dream that a transition of power will come 
about automatically in Germany. Helmut Kohl is the great winner 
of 23 May. He convinced the FDP [Free Democratic Party of 
Germany] not to tip the scales in the SPD [Social Democratic 
Party of Germany] candidate's favor. That the liberals were in 
agony over that decision makes his success all the more 
impressive. 
  The chancellor, who predicted a kind of final twilight of 
the 
gods just a few months ago, is on his way to power again with 
his coalition. When it was said that he is no longer strong 
enough to keep the eastern German members within the CDU 
[Christian Democratic Union], to convince the FDP that they 
should trust in him as a life insurance, it was only rumor. 
Once again, Helmut Kohl has relied entirely on his instinct for 
power. And once again he has had a lot of luck. 
  Kohl is fortunate to have Klaus Kinkel. One of the reasons 
why Kohl got his way after the bad start he had with Steffen 
Heitmann, was that he judged the FDP correctly. The liberal 
party was torn. One-third of them wanted to see Johannes Rau as 
president; he seemed more suitable than Roman Herzog. They also 
wanted to signal that the FDP is maintaining a minimum of 
independence, that it does not let Kohl dictate their ballot 
slips in the Federal Assembly. But the majority were convinced 
that they will stand a better chance of surviving this autumn's 
elections if they commit themselves to a chancellor who just has 
to find out where he stands once again. 
  In the middle of this test, Kinkel established himself as 
party chairman. In his view, the FDP must not waver until the 
elections. He was planning the decision in Herzog's favor as a 
confirmation of the earlier coalition statement in favor of the 
CDU/CSU [Christian Social Union]. Kinkel's signal consists of 
three words: predictability, straightforwardness, reliability. 
The liberals did not vote for Herzog or Rau, but for their 
chairman's demand that they should behave in such a way that 
Kohl's coalition feels on its way up again and Scharping's 
upward trend seems to have stopped. 
  In spite of his relative strength, Kinkel has not come out 
as 
a winner on 23 May. The decision for Herzog was born out of a 
weakness. The FDP no longer feels strong enough to want 
anything itself, to enforce its own ideas about the candidate's 
personality and about the distribution of power in the republic. 
The liberals had two options before Herzog was elected. With 
the coalition statement, they kept the future with the CDU/CSU 
open. At the same time, this statement enabled them to feel 
free to indicate a different line for the presidential election. 
Kinkel decided in favor of the clear majority in the Bundestag 
group that feels closer to the coalition with the CDU/CSU than 
the party as a whole does. He turned the Bundestag group's will 
into political action cleverly and successfully. 
  But it has also become clear that Kinkel does not dare do 
something on which one of his predecessors was an expert: 
juggling with two or more balls. With Genscher as chairman, 
the FDP could have voted for Rau. In that case it would have 
been wooed by the CDU/CSU and the SPD. The FDP under Kinkel did 
not dare do such a thing. It was scared of a "sudden 
deterioration of the climate." It prefers being scolded by the 
SPD to being chided by the CDU/CSU even if it does not yet see 
itself as a liberal working group within the CDU. 
  At first glance, Kinkel's straightforwardness seems to be 
liberating. The hangover comes later. The new president's 
first speech has already irritated several of the FDP delegates 
who had voted for him. The fact that Herzog wants to represent 
Germany "in a relaxed way," that he welcomed citizens from the 
East like guests to the West and forgot the foreigners did not 
only make Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher and Hans-Dietrich Genscher 
wince. Herzog's impromptu speech, formed by the emotions of the 
moment, rhetorically plain, made the liberals feel that they are 
partly responsible. This will, all the more, make them have to 
support this president who might still need to grow into his 
office and will certainly not be the image of his predecessor, 
Richard von Weizsaecker. 
  With the decision in favor of Herzog, the dream of a 
transition of power fades, the image of Helmut Kohl's upswing 
moves to the foreground. In this republic, the chancellor is 
the one who makes decisions. In the coalition, the dog once 
again wags the tail, not the other way around -- as sometimes 
happened before. The FDP does not consider it in its interest 
to prevent the chancellor from coloring everything his way. But 
this could annoy some of the voters. 
  Will Kohl's success turn out to be a Pyrrhic victory in the 
end? This depends on whether Kinkel's hope of his loyalty to the 
chancellor being appreciated is fulfilled. On the evening of 16 
October in Bonn, the CDU/CSU and the FDP will have to get enough 
weight on the scales to be able to harvest the fruit they sowed 
in Berlin in May. For the chancellor, a cancellation of the 
twilight of the gods will not be sufficient. More than ever 
before, the FDP will determine Helmut Kohl's fate.

<F P=106> ["Rm."-attributed commentary: "A Lesson"] </F>
  [Text] The Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] is 
complaining loudly about the fact that its candidate, [Johannes] 
Rau, will not be the president, although he is more popular 
among the people than Herzog. An inappropriate complaint. If 
the Basic Law had wanted the person with more adherents among 
the people to become head of state, it would have been written 
there: The president is elected by the people. However, our 
constitution entrusted a representative body with the election, 
the Federal Assembly. If the German state wants to introduce 
the election of the president by the people, it can do so 
anytime. Those who advocate it do not want "a new republic" for 
that reason alone, as the chancellor thinks. However, what the 
Basic Law determines today is valid today. This should also be 
the guideline for criticism from a party whose candidate was 
defeated in the presidential election. 
  Losing hurts. How hard it was for Rau to get over the defeat 
in the vote is indicated by his reproach that part of the Free 
Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] was not interested in electing 
the right candidate. That can only mean that he, Rau, is the 
right candidate. Apparently, such propaganda for oneself is 
part of the last ramifications of the first presidential 
election campaign that our state went through. The parties 
struggled; but the candidates also struggled, as if the last 
vote had to be pressed out of the reservoir of voters in the 
countries. In these weeks, what the president's office requires 
and what has to be demanded of its bearer is being rehashed 
everywhere in a conformist way. However, one does not hear 
anywhere what would have to be said above all after the 
experiences of the year 1984 and again since last autumn: The 
office of president is nothing that one may strive for like a 
Bundestag mandate, a ministerial office, or a state secretary's 
post. It is not suited to be the subject of a career plan. 
Therefore, it cannot be found in books that are entitled "How To 
Work One's Way Up" or "The Road to the Top." 
  Readiness is the only thing that someone whom a party wants 
to be its candidate should have. He is to wait patiently until 
the election act in the Federal Assembly; every word in public 
that he does not speak in this time is gold, for, afterward, the 
person who has been elected will not be intoxicated with his 
victory and the person who has not been elected will not be 
depressed.

<F P=106> [Interview with Industry Minister Vito Gnutti by Giorgio </F>
Lonardi in Rome; date not given: "The Ministry Will Move"] 
  [Text] [Industry Minister] Vito Gnutti, [Budget Minister] 
Giancarlo Pagliarini, and [Finance Minister] Giulio Tremonti, 
the three economic ministers from the North, are each preparing 
to open a "branch" of their ministries in Milan. The tax office 
building in Via Manin has been chosen as the location. It is a 
beautiful building a few hundred meters from the Cerchia del 
Navigli that overlooks the municipal gardens. The news, that 
was foreshadowed yesterday by LA REPUBBLICA, was confirmed by 
Pagliarini, who is responsible for the budget. A spokesman of 
the same Pagliarini had in fact observed that it was "necessary 
for the ministry to open a branch in Milan." The reason is to 
be closer to the real economy, to the production center, and to 
the factories and offices of the North. 
  The minister was more loquacious in the lower house during 
the evening. He joked that the Budget Ministry could be 
"transferred to Lametia Terme, maybe to the former SIR [Italian 
Resins Company] headquarters." Then Pagliarini added: "In 
exchange, the Interior Ministry and the Bank of Italy could be 
moved to Milan or at the most to Como." In short, a continuous 
stream of witticism. It is an ironic mood that spills over into 
enjoyment of being provocative. "We will move out of the 
splendid building in Via Venti Settembre, that houses the Budget 
and the Treasury Ministries and transform it into a beautiful 
museum like the Louvre or the Prado. It would not even be 
necessary to move the furniture. Giancarlo Pagliarini's desk is 
already there," the minister ironically added, "it is a pity 
that there is also the chair that belonged to Cirino Pomicino." 
  Jokes apart, Pagliarini then confided that he was in favor 
of 
moving the economic ministries to the North. "However, it can 
only be a feasible project in the medium term," he specified, 
"let us say in about 10 years." As regards the people who work 
in Via Venti Settembre, "the problem can be resolved by freezing 
the turnover, and in any case by avoiding traumatic solutions." 
  Vito Gnutti, who is responsible for industry, was more 
cautious. He also began by laughing: "What do you people from 
LA REPUBBLICA do? Are you mind readers?" 
  [Lonardi] So you confirm the project. 
  [Gnutti] It is a good idea to open a branch of the economic 
ministries in the North. I willingly accept the suggestion that 
your paper made. 
  [Lonardi] So, Minister Gnutti, have you already chosen to 
house the Milan Industry, Finance, and Budget Ministries' 
offices on Via Manin? 
  [Gnutti] In my dreams there is the hypothesis of opening 
some 
offices in the North. I repeat: You have read my mind. 
However, there have been no meetings on this subject with my 
colleagues, the other ministers. 
  [Lonardi] Did you not meet Pagliarini for dinner at a 
restaurant in EUR [Rome suburb] a few evenings ago to celebrate 
the new government? 
  [Gnutti] It may seem strange, but when we meet for dinner we 
do not talk politics. 
  [Lonardi] However, you quite like the idea of opening a 
branch in the North. 
  [Gnutti] I do not deny that at all. It forms part of our 
idea of a "network capital." 
  [Lonardi] Could you explain this better. 
  [Gnutti] Federalism can be understood in various ways. There 
is no law that says that all the ministries must be in Rome. 
Therefore, they could be scattered over various regions of the 
country. 
  [Lonardi] Are you convinced that this is the best solution? 
  [Gnutti] No, I like the idea of a "network capital." This 
means that the ministries must be as close as possible to the 
people. The risk to be taken is that of decentralization. 
  [Lonardi] And then? 
  [Gnutti] On the one hand, the offices must be where the 
people need them. Even in the South clearly, in Palermo rather 
than in Naples. 
  [Lonardi] And on the other hand? 
  [Gnutti] On the other hand, there is the solution offered by 
computer science, that allows offices to be connected in a 
"network," even if they are far apart. I will shortly be 
holding a meeting on the computerization of the offices here at 
the ministry. I think that this is a very important subject. 
  [Lonardi] Let us go back to Via Manin. Do you not think that 
it is a suitable location for the Industry Ministry in the North? 
  [Gnutti] If you really want to know, the UUPPICA [Provincial 
Offices of Industry, Commerce, and Crafts] offices at every 
chamber of commerce are already a branch of the Industry 
Ministry.

<F P=106> [Interview with Innocenzo Cipolletta, director general of </F>
the General Confederation of Italian Industry, by Vittoria Siva 
in Rome; date not given: "We are Asking the Government To Free 
Up the Market"] 
  [Text] Rome -- The government is in the fullness of its 
powers: the new labor minister has already begun a dialogue 
with employers and trade unions. And immediately the debate on 
social problems -- formulas for creating new jobs, systems for 
making both hiring and firing more flexible, suggestions for 
reintroducing and increasing the wage limits, which disappeared 
25 years ago -- has been rekindled. "We will judge the 
government on the facts," Confindustria [General Confederation 
of Italian Industry] and the trade unions have repeated so far. 
Now that the scenarios are becoming clear, we will attempt to 
analyze them with Confindustria Director General Innocenzo 
Cipolletta. 
  [Siva] With regard to the Berlusconi government, 
Confindustria has moved from a position that was so independent 
as to be interpreted as diffident to "confident expectation." 
Have you changed ideas? 
  [Cipolletta] No. We remain convinced that we made the right 
choice in insisting on the association's independence. But I am 
not slow to admit that we have had certain difficulties in 
communicating effectively the meaning of this line. The country 
has a history of collateralism which has given us the habit of 
interpreting every taking of a position as a tactic. Moreover, 
in a substantially bipolar political situation, a Confindustria 
which is independent from the majority line-up has automatically 
been seen as tipping in favor of the opposition line-up. 
  [Siva] Hence the story of an old grudge between 
[Confindustria] Chairman Abete and [Prime Minister] Berlusconi 
is not true? 
  [Cipolletta] No grudge. Even if a few years ago, when 
Confindustria sounded the alarm on the perverse effects of the 
escalator clause, Berlusconi took a different position, 
considering as negative any measure which could depress 
consumption. But today I am convinced that our independence is 
an advantage which also strengthens the government's 
independence vis-a-vis Confindustria. 
  [Siva] Will it be easier or more difficult to hold a 
dialogue 
with new Labor Minister Mastella and new Industry Minister 
Gnutti? 
  [Cipolletta] It is a positive fact that they belong to a 
line-up which has based its program on principles inspired by 
liberalism: fewer shackles on corporations' activities in the 
labor market; less state presence in the economy. This is a 
philosophy which we share. And we believe that from now on there 
will be no alibis for not applying any of the liberal choices 
for which the electorate voted in the present majority. 
  [Siva] What do you think of the scant enthusiasm with which 
various government exponents judge the past cooperation between 
trade unions and enterprises? 
  [Cipolletta] The cooperation policy since the second half of 
the 1970's was essential in providing weak governments with a 
sufficiently broad basis of consensus in Parliament. Today, 
with the new parliamentary system, the government is not forced 
to share its choices. This means that the method of cooperation 
with the social partners will have to be based essentially on 
mutual information: The government will consult us and will 
then have to make its own decisions. 
  [Siva] When disputes come to a head, however, recourse to 
the 
government makes it easy for you and the trade unions. Perhaps 
in order to obtain an avalanche of early retirements. 
  [Cipolletta] I do not deny that it has made it easy for 
everyone. However, I would say that today many company crises 
have been resolved or are in the process of being solved, and 
that the social partners are more mature. If I could give a 
word of advice to the government, it would be to send out a 
message of confidence specifically on the maturity of companies 
and trade unions, beginning by saying that they need to resolve 
the problems on their own. If any of us thinks that they can 
always count on an understanding government, no one will devise 
solutions. 
  [Siva] Renewal of public and private contracts, the labor 
and 
job markets, privatizations. Which of these problems needs to 
be solved most urgently? 
  [Cipolletta] Privatizations. In recent months this process 
has been held up by obstacles of an ideological nature, either 
in the name of the defense of national interests, or in the name 
of industrial democracy, which in fact reveal the rejection of 
market rules. As to the renewal of labor contracts, the most 
difficult are those in the public sector, which are a true test 
of the government's desire for innovation. I would hope that 
the trade unions realize, after 40 years of protectionism, that 
if public workers are given increases, the administration will 
have to fire people. If then the trade unions decide to go into 
battle, with agitation in the public services, the risk for the 
country is high. 
  [Siva] And the renewal of private sector contracts? 
  [Cipolletta] In many sectors where exports are doing well, 
there will be room for a salaries policy. 
  [Siva] Do you believe that increasing the number of jobs by 
1 
million in a couple of years is credible? 
  [Cipolletta] According to Confindustria's estimates, a 1.6 
percent increase in GDP in 1994, 2.8 percent in 1995, and 3.4 
percent in 1996 could create around 700,000 new jobs. But the 
forecasts can also be higher, within a short time period, if, 
alongside the recovery of the economy, rules are enacted which 
make the labor market more flexible. If companies can hire 
people without the requirement to hold labor in any event, even 
when faced with a hole in the market, their readiness to 
increase employment will be even greater.

  [Text] Interior Minister Roberto Maroni has illustrated the 
government's plan to step up the fight against Mafia-inspired 
crime to the Chamber of Deputies. The 10 points are illustrated 
for us by Daniela Calastri: 
  [Calastri] A special group drawn from all the forces of law 
and order will collaborate with the Palermo Anti-Mafia 
Prosecutor's Office; another interforce group will take charge 
of tracking down the most dangerous wanted criminals; the 
citizens of Palermo will be able to make use of a toll free 
phone number directly linked to the police commissioner's office 
in order to give information useful to the investigators; 
supervision of the island will be reinforced by 100 men from the 
police special operations force and a similar number from the 
carabinieri; and the number of financial police will also be 
increased. These forces will join the 5,200 soldiers who are 
already in Sicily as part of the so-called Sicilian Vespers 
operation. The minister envisages that the number of men in 
this operation will rise to 7,200. In addition, the financial 
police will step up its investigations into illegal assets. 
  As far as the law on supergrasses is concerned, Minister 
Maroni said that the government would try and strike a balance 
which reinforces the demands of the judiciary for safeguards 
against evidence tampering and manipulation of supergrasses.

  [Text] "The rise in extraparliamentary right- and left-wing 
extremism is not alarming, but is giving cause for concern." 
These were the words of Chief of Police Vincenzo Parisi, 
speaking during a news conference given by Interior Minister 
Roberto Maroni. 
  "The largest grouping," he stressed, "comes from the fringes 
of the extreme left, particularly from the autonomous workers as 
well as other organizations. These groupings have 12,114 
members (included in census returns) who are spread throughout 
570 offices. The extreme right wing has a few hundred members, 
divided into three main branches, some of whom are quarrelsome 
and violent."

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Ladeiro Monteiro, former head of </F>
the Information and Security Service, by unidentified 
corrrespondent in Lisbon on 25 May--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Correspondent] Dr. Ladeiro Monteiro, is your 
conscience clear? 
  [Monteiro] Of course. I would like you to leave me alone, 
because I do not want to make any statements. 
  [Correspondent] You have come out of all this rather badly. 
Is your conscience clear that everything was normal? 
  [Monteiro]] Certainly. My conscience is clear, because I am 
certain that we acted within the law and in keeping with 
democratic rule. 
  [Correspondent] What happened in Madeira? 
  [Monteiro] What happened in Madeira was that two magistrates 
accused SIS of watching them or investigating them. As you 
know, the council.... [pauses] The government asked the 
monitoring council to look into this, and the council dismissed 
the accusation. [passage omitted] Therefore, it was not proved. 
  [Correspondent] In any case, irregularities were found in 
SIS 
work in Madeira. 
  [Monteiro] I do not want to say anything about that. What I 
find strange, very strange, is that the original issue 
disappeared while side issues have surfaced, remain there, and 
are greatly exaggerated--issues that I consider to be minor and 
that I partly blame on an unfortunate choice of words. 
  [Correspondent] But did SIS act outside the law in Madeira 
or 
not? 
  [Monteiro] I believe that in strict terms it did not. There 
may have been a linguistic slip. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] In the last eight years, did you ever feel 
that you were a tool of the government? 
  [Monteiro] Never. The government never asked anything from 
me. All SIS activities were at my initiative and are my 
responsibility. I would like you to see my resignation as 
normal, because do not forget that the post of director general 
is a temporary post that can end at any time. It is not a 
lifetime position. 
  Throughout the last eight years, the monitoring council has 
given SIS very favorable appraisals. I would go as far as to 
say it has praised SIS. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] If it were not for this affair would you 
have 
resigned? 
  [Monteiro] Obviously in view of all this, and in view of the 
accusations leveled at my former colleague in Madeira--in my 
opinion a serious man, and therefore the accusations are 
unjust--and because I believe I should give the government room 
to maneuver to defend itself against the unjust accusations 
leveled at it, I felt I should hand in my resignation. It is 
above all a matter of dignity.

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Maria Brunet: "Serra Asserts That Roldan's </F>
Lies Will Not Affect his Record"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- Deputy Prime Minister Narcis Serra stated 
yesterday that the "lies" told by former Civil Guard Director 
General Luis Roldan "can never affect my record as a 
politician." Serra attacked the People's Party for giving 
credence to the accusations leveled against him by Roldan, and 
attributed to People's Party Chairman Jose Maria Aznar -- absent 
from the session -- "a lack of political ethics and courage" for 
leveling unfounded accusations against him in connection with 
the Roldan affair. Serra made these statements in reply to 
questions from People's Party Deputies Luis Ramallo and Rogelio 
Baon on the Roldan affair at the Congress of Deputies plenary 
session. 
  For their part, the People's Party representatives took the 
view that Serra should accept political responsibility for 
Roldan's appointment as Civil Guard director general. Ramallo 
accused Serra of being "afraid" at the possibility of appearing 
before the parliamentary committee of enquiry into the affair. 
Serra said in reply that the People's Party was pursuing a 
policy of "defamation" and unproven accusations in this affair. 
<H5>  Tense Atmosphere </H5>
  Serra's appearance came during the weekly question period. 
Deputies Ramallo and Baon asked him eight questions in a tense 
atmosphere characterized by constant interruptions and booing 
and applauding of speakers. The session provided no new 
information about the Roldan affair. Ramallo emphasized that, 
in any event, the deputy prime minister had given his word and 
that this would be on record in the Congress minutes, so that if 
he were some day found to be untruthful in describing his 
relations with Roldan, he could be called to account immediately. 
  The eight questions asked by Ramallo and Baon -- the 
People's 
Party's representatives on the committee that has investigated 
Roldan's conduct in heading the Civil Guard -- sought to cast 
light on the relationship which may have existed between Roldan 
and Serra. The questions included the government's reasons for 
entrusting Roldan with the Crillon report on Mario Conde, which, 
according to Roldan, Serra had ordered. 
  The deputy prime minister did not confine himself to 
defending himself against the accusations leveled against him by 
the People's Party; he counterattacked, and aimed high, accusing 
People's Party leader Jose Maria Aznar of lacking ethics in his 
political conduct in believing and echoing statements made by a 
fugitive from justice. "Today the minutes of the session will 
reflect an act implying a lack of courage and political valor 
because of Mr. Aznar's absence." The People's Party chairman 
said in reply from Valladolid that Spain "will not progress 
through aspersions, or insults. No attention need be paid right 
now to those statements or to people who cannot keep their 
composure." 
  Rogelio Baon and Luis Ramallo took the view that the 
government in general and Serra in particular had assumed 
political responsibilities with respect to the Roldan affair by 
appointing him, accepting nonexistent academic qualifications, 
failing to monitor his conduct while in charge of the Civil 
Guard, ordering intelligence from the Civil Guard which should 
never have been made public, and, finally, allowing him to 
escape. 
  Serra replied to all these points by acknowledging the 
mistakes made in appointing Roldan and in allowing him to 
escape; two former ministers -- Corcuera and Asuncion -- had 
paid for this, he said, by having to relinquish their posts. In 
his opinion the government had therefore already assumed 
political responsibility for the affair insofar as it could be 
called to account. 
  "If what Mr. Roldan reveals what he has done so far," the 
deputy prime minister asserted, "let me tell you that I am 
absolutely at ease, because lies will never be able to affect my 
record as a politician. Second, more conclusive evidence about 
my relations with Mr. Roldan would have to be sought. They were 
those befitting a defense minister and a Civil Guard director 
general, or a deputy prime minister and a Civil Guard director 
general, basically because since I have been in the government I 
have tried to protect and defend that body's military nature. 
Hence, because the system of promotions and military positions 
was my responsibility as defense minister, I consulted with the 
former Civil Guard director general; I also consulted with him 
as deputy prime minister in connection with the measures adopted 
to guarantee security at events in 1992.

<F P=106> [Report by Mariano Guindal: "Solbes Says Foreign Investment </F>
Grew by 10 Percent in First Quarter"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- Economy Minister Pedro Solbes stated 
yesterday that direct foreign investment in Spain grew by over 
10 percent in the first quarter of the year, as compared with 
the same period during the previous year. "This means that 
people still have confidence in Spain," and that the myth of 
disinvestment caused by the departure of some multinational 
enterprises "is neither correct nor corresponds to reality," the 
minister said. 
  In statements made to Spanish National Radio, Solbes harshly 
criticized the People's Party and United Left for denying the 
figures showing a clear start of economic recovery, "simply 
because of not acknowledging that the policy which the 
government is implementing is the correct one." According to 
Solbes, growth and job creation will be gradually consolidated 
until 1,000 jobs per day are being created, which is the 
government's aim. 
  The Economics Ministry is finalizing the Plan for European 
Integration, which will be presented in Brussels in July. The 
plan contains budget projections for the next three years. 
According to these forecasts, the economy will grow by 1.3 
percent this year, 2.6 percent in 1995, and 3.5 percent in 1996. 
That is, the aim is to triple growth in three years, and this 
will make it possible to move from a zero increase in jobs to 
around 400,000 at the end of the period. 
  At the same time, the program envisions a drastic reduction 
in the public deficit, which will fall from the 6.4 percent 
forecast for the public administrations as a whole in 1994 to 
3.2 percent of GDP for the 1996-1997 fiscal year. The intent is 
to achieve this reduction without increasing the individual tax 
burden. Hence, government activity will center on cutting 
public spending: Civil Service staffing will be frozen, 
transfers to state-run businesses will be reduced, transfers to 
the autonomous communities will be stabilized, and spending on 
health and unemployment will be rationalized. 
  As far as revenue is concerned, an additional increase in 
revenue is envisioned as a result of the struggle against fraud 
and the increase in consumption, profits, and employment. 
  The plan also foresees a considerable decline in inflation 
from 3.5 percent in 1994 to 2.5 percent at the end of 1997. The 
minister acknowledges that this is a very difficult aim, since 
"lowering prices from 5 percent is almost quite ambitious." 
However, he believes that it will be reduced significantly in 
the second half of the year, when food prices fall. 
  Solbes believes that the structural reforms of the labor 
market which have been begun must be completed in order to 
defeat inflation. In fact, the second part of the integration 
plan centers mainly on these reforms in order to "be on the same 
level as the soundest economies in Europe and be able to join in 
the third stage of [monetary and economic] union." 
  In the minister's opinion, it would be a very grave mistake 
for us to join in this third stage "solely for political 
reasons, and it is essential that we achieve the economic 
conditions enabling us to take that step." He told a select 
group of diplomats at the Ortega y Gasset Foundation that 
"European unity is not being built in the way which the 
government would have liked."

  Solbes has publicly acknowledged that the aforementioned 
change is due to the disappearance of the East bloc countries, 
which has caused a fundamental change in the role played by 
Germany. 
  The minister publicly acknowledged that with the Community's 
enlargement, Spain's political influence in Europe has 
diminished, and the center of gravity has shifted from south to 
north. "The complexities which have developed are leading us 
toward a confederal Europe, although we would have preferred the 
federal formula." He explained that the government would have 
liked the creation of a common political area, yet it is 
increasingly clear that we are heading for a "Thatcher-style" 
economic option. 
  Pedro Solbes also acknowledged that "liberalism has 
triumphed 
over the more interventionist social democratic visions of 
Europe." The minister asked whether a process of integrating 
markets can be gotten under way without compensatory 
arrangements. In any event, he emphasized that Spain must be 
involved in the first stage, "and we are going to do everything 
possible to achieve this."
