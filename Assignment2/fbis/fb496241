  [Text] According to Alfredo Saenz [chairman of Banesto] 
speaking today in the Congress of Deputies, the sale of 
Banesto's stake in media companies will "generate losses." 
  Banesto's chairman confirmed that negotiations for selling 
Banesto's stake in Antena 3, Grupo Zeta, and Tele 5 are under 
way with Bankers Trust. The American bank will not be 
responsible for the sale of EL MUNDO and EPOCA. 
  According to Saenz, the Banesto corporation "does not 
correspond to what an industrial group should be" and until 
definitive data is available, its 1993 loses may amount to 
120,000 million pesetas.

<F P=106> [Report by Christina Lopes, Henrik Qvortrup, and Bent </F>
Winther: "SF Steps Up Its Opposition to NATO"] 
  [Text] With adoption at its national conference of an 
aggressive election program the Socialist People's Party [SF] 
has further distanced itself from the Social Democratic Party 
and the Radical Liberals. 
  The SF's national conference yesterday hardened the party's 
attitude to NATO, when the conference in Kolding recommended 
that the military organization be disbanded. 
  The adoption of this new position on NATO was a defeat for 
the party's Folketing caucus and for party chairman Holger K. 
Nielsen. But it is also an indication that the SF has moved 
further away from the Social Democratic Party. 
  As a result further obstacles seem to have been thrown in 
the 
path of the negotiations between the Social Democratic Party, 
the Radical Liberals, and the SF which could result from of the 
upcoming election. 
  Immediately after the national conference Holger K. Nielsen 
tried to play down the importance of the NATO decision which he 
himself had advised the delegates against. 
  "There is no suggestion of a major defeat. The NATO decision 
will not be a nonnegotiable demand as far as we are concerned," 
the SF chairman said. 
  Social Democratic spokesman Frank Jensen is not enthusiastic 
about the SF decision and the prospects it holds out for future 
cooperation. 
  "With its new decision the SF has taken a regrettable step 
away from the centrist line the party had otherwise adopted. It 
is an unwise decision," Frank Jensen told BERLINGSKE TIDENDE. 
  The NATO decision was reached after a long and at times 
bitter showdown between former SF chairman Gert Petersen (who 
recommended a "no") and the SF's member of the Defense 
Committee, Jens Thoft. 
  The national conference also gave the Folketing caucus its 
backing on a number of the forceful demands the SF leadership 
has been making: a 30-hour workweek, a tunnel to Sweden, higher 
gasoline and carbon dioxide taxes, and much more money for local 
authorities. A large number of these demands are unacceptable 
especially to the Radical Liberals whose leader, Marianne 
Jelved, has already urged moderation in BERLINGSKE TIDENDE. 
  However, leading SF members are unwilling to allow 
themselves 
to be frightened off in advance by the negative reactions from 
the other parties. 
  Holger K. Nielsen thinks it important that the three parties 
should be able to appear together as a bloc which could work as 
a counterweight to the Liberal-Conservative-Progress Party bloc.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Government's Rating Is Rising -- </F>
But Still Low"] 
  [Text] The general voter assessment of the four-party 
government under leadership of Poul Nyrup Rasmussen is still 
very reserved. However, the fall in the government's rating has 
been replaced by a rise. 
  Since 1946 the Gallup Institute has conducted a running 
popularity rating of the government at regular intervals to 
assess electorate opinion of the cabinet sitting at that time. 
The latest poll in this long series has just been completed. In 
the period from 26 April through 2 May, Gallup conducted 
telephone interviews with a representative sample of voters, 
comprising 1,002 individuals over age 18. 
  Gallup asked the following question: Do you think the 
government has done "well," "rather well," or "not well" during 
the period it has existed? 
  Each response was calculated into a score, with a reply of 
"well" assigned the value + 2, the reply "rather well" given 
+ 1, and "not well" a value of - 2. This latest survey, which 
was conducted at the end of April and the beginning of May, 
accordingly resulted in a score of - 10. This is a slight 
improvement in relation to the previous survey, which was done 
in December 1993. Then the government's rating was - 27. 
  In the small table below are seen the poll results for the 
current four-party government. For purposes of comparison, also 
included are the results from the surveys Gallup conducted on 
the last nonsocialist government, the Conservative-Liberal 
coalition. 
  The large table [not reproduced here] shows the scores since 
Hilmar Baunsgaard's Radical Liberal-Liberal-Conservative 
government at the end of the sixties. As seen from the figures, 
the dramatic fall in the government's rating has stopped for 
this time. The question is whether this result is a first 
indication of that reward that the government is expecting from 
the voters in the wake of the economic upturn or whether it is 
more a matter of the four-party coalition's rating having become 
mired in the negative part of the scale.

  [Excerpt] The government has reached agreement on a 
national subsidy package linked to the EU [European Union] 
settlement. Uninterrupted negotiations lasting 12 hours ended 
this morning at about 0500. The government's ministerial group 
on the EU also agreed that Finland will hold a referendum on 16 
October on joining the EU, that is, before Sweden and Norway. 
  According to Prime Minister Esko Aho, the main features of 
the subsidy package are in line with a proposal drafted by a 
group of officials. The costs of the first year of the subsidy 
package will be nearly 15 billion markkas, after which they will 
then fall. The domestic subsidy for agriculture will be 5.5-6 
billion markkas a year. 
  The government's ministerial group will finalize the 
decisions on the subsidy package this morning. After that, the 
parliamentary groups of the government parties will decide on 
their stand on the solution achieved and the Council of State 
will make decisions tomorrow. 
  During the night, the government also decided on a reduced 
value-added tax on foodstuffs. Instead of the planned 22 
percent, their tax base will be 17 percent for the next three 
years. From the beginning of 1998, the tax will fall to 12 
percent. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Esa Haermaelae, chairman of the Central Union of 
Agricultural Producers and Forest Owners, MTK, thinks that the 
domestic EU [European Union] subsidy for agriculture is too 
small. In the subsidy package agreed by the government the 
subsidy is about 5.5-6 billion Finnish markkas [FM]. According 
to Haermaelae, the sum is much the same as that proposed by the 
working group of officials, which the MTK calculated was FM700 
too little per hectare. The MTK chairman points out that the 
subsidy of FM15 billion to be paid out in the first year of 
membership should not be seen in its entirety as an agricultural 
subsidy, because other food producers benefit from it too. 
  The government agreed on domestic subsidies for farmers and 
the foodstuffs industry during negotiations that lasted 
throughout the night. If Finland becomes a member of the EU, 
the subsidy to be paid in the first year of membership will 
total FM15 billion, which is FM4 billion more than now. In five 
years' time, the domestic subsidy to be paid out would be about 
FM6 billion a year. The increase in the agricultural subsidy 
will be compensated to the taxpayers in such a way that a 
smaller value-added tax on food than planned will be payable; 
initially 17 percent and in three years' time 12 percent.

  [Text] Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari confirmed today 
that he had talks on arms deals during his visit to Russia, 
including the procurement of helicopters. At his news 
conference in Mikkeli, Ahtisaari rejected a statement made by 
Defense Minister Elisabeth Rehn, according to which it would be 
totally mad to cover the Russian debt with arms purchases. Ossi 
Kervinen reports. 
  [Begin recording] [Kervinen] The Defense Ministry announced 
in a press statement yesterday that the ministry has neither 
agreed nor negotiated on arms procurement from Russia to cover 
Russian debt. Today, however, the supreme commander of the 
defense forces, President Martti Ahtisaari, said that during his 
visit to Russia he had talks about possible new arms purchases, 
according to a list drawn up by the Defense Ministry. 
  [Ahtisaari] I do not remember now the contents of the list 
because there were many such matters which did not mention any 
amounts. For example, there is a requirement for helicopters, 
but the list did not say how many helicopters. They wanted to 
find out what was possibly available and suitable. 
  [Kervinen] Aimo Pajunen, chief secretary of the Defense 
Ministry, confirmed in the afternoon that the president has a 
list with him, but not a shopping list. The list, the contents 
of which Pajunen did not reveal either, emphasizes the high-tech 
areas which Finland would be willing to discuss. Generally, such 
familiarization will lead to procurement if the price and the 
quality are agreeable. 
  Regarding the helicopters, we know that the Mi-8 helicopters 
of the air force are aging. New helicopters will be needed 
sooner or later. The procurement of helicopters was taken up 
during the winter when the procurement agreements, which were 
signed with Russia in March, were prepared. A protocol was 
signed with Russia in March on this year's procurements from 
Russia. The deal, which is worth 100 million markkas, gives us 
mainly ammunition and spare parts for the land forces. At the 
same time, a protocol was signed which liquidates accounts 
receivables worth 450 million markkas of the old debt of the 
former Soviet Union. With this money, modern, light Igla air 
defense missiles will be acquired together with artillery 
equipment and ammunition. 
  Defense Minister Elisabeth Rehn said in a press interview 
yesterday that it is totally mad to cover Russia's debts by arms 
procurement when we do not even know whether we need such cheap 
arms. This statement has caused serious rancor in the defense 
forces and in Rehn's own ministry. The defense forces say that 
they have received only good and useful arms from Russia and 
also from Germany; a poor country cannot afford to buy bad 
equipment. 
  During Defense Minister Rehn's period in office, the defense 
forces appear to have received a lot of positive publicity and 
understanding. In one press interview, which also mentioned the 
dispute over appointing the chief secretary of the Defense 
Ministry, Rehn is said to have destroyed everything. What also 
makes Rehn's statement odd in the case of arms procurement is 
that she and her ministry drew up all these lists. This aspect 
was also raised by President Ahtisaari when he commented on 
Rehn's statement. 
  [Ahtisaari] Well, as a matter of fact all these proposals 
have come from Rehn's ministry, so I do not believe that 
anybody has proposed anything other than what has been proposed 
by the ministry. [end recording]

  [Text] Russian parliamentarians reject the idea of 
returning Karelia to Finland. The Diet Foreign Affairs 
Committee has had talks in Moscow with representatives of the 
Russian Duma on this issue. Diet Speaker Pertti Paasio says 
that discussions on changing the borders are perceived as 
negative and there is no willingness to hold such talks. 
According to the Duma representatives, however, there can be 
discussions on cooperation in developing Karelia. Foreign 
Ministry official Joern Donner discussed the Karelia question in 
Moscow.

  [Text] The fallout from the Chernobyl nuclear plant 
accident eight years ago is still evident in Finland. A survey 
covering southern Finland carried out by plane a few weeks ago 
revealed regions where radioactivity in the area is still 
surprisingly high. In addition, there were smaller regions, 
including Myrskylae and Kuhmoinen, where cesium 137 was found in 
quantities of 200 kilo- becquerels per square kilometer. These 
amounts are not dangerous for humans even though they are 
conspicuously high. Levels of 560 kilo-becquerels would demand 
protective measures.

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Anders Bjoerck by </F>
correspondent Titti Nylander in Brussels on 25 May; from the 
"Ekots" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] Sweden is today for the first time taking part in a 
defense ministers meeting at NATO headquarters in Brussels. The 
meeting is for countries taking part in the Partnership for 
Peace program that Sweden joined earlier this month. The other 
countries had a long list of hopes on the Swedish contributions, 
Defense Minister Anders Bjoerck says. 
  [Bjoerck] Sweden is unique, among other things because we 
have taken part in the UN peacekeeping tasks in such an active 
way. As a matter of fact, more than 60,000 Swedes have served 
as UN soldiers since the 1950s. We have had a unique experience 
in this for which we have received a lot of praise. There are 
many countries that have had no experience in this and want to 
find out how we have managed: They want to have training, 
information, and different sorts of assistance. We have of 
course offered this to them; this is our niche, our speciality. 
  [Nylander] Most of the other members in this Partnership for 
Peace cooperation agreement see this as a gateway to NATO--I am 
thinking of the countries of Central and East Europe. How is it 
going to be possible to try to convince the gathering here in 
Brussels that Sweden does not view this matter in a similar way? 
  [Bjoerck] Well, it is a matter of information and more 
information. In the plenary debate here today I made it 
absolutely clear that we intend to maintain our foreign policy, 
which is free from alliances. Our membership in NATO is not 
topical. We differ in this from many of the East European 
countries, which for different reasons are not being considered 
for NATO membership. But this must be stressed over and over 
and over again. 
  [Nylander] Russia has now announced that it will join the 
Partnership for Peace program. Do you see this as a beginning 
of a completely new security order in Europe? 
  [Bjoerck] In any case this is a good starting point for 
that. 
We were all terribly glad here today when Pavel Grachev made it 
clear that they intend to sign the Partnership for Peace 
agreement without conditions or rewards. Many had not dared to 
hope for this. If everything goes well, we will maybe be able 
to experience what I have always dreamed of, that the big and 
mighty Russia--that is what it is at least potentially--will 
start taking part in European security structures, and in the 
cooperation organizations in Europe in a considerably more 
active way than before. As a matter of fact, I think that this 
is a precondition for lasting peace and stability in Europe, 
that we have the Russians with us.

<F P=106> [Article by Tommy Oberg: "Labor Federation Will Probably </F>
Take Neutral Stand on European Union"] 
  [Text] The No to the European Union (EU) organization got 
its first major union profile yesterday. Kenth Pettersson, 
chairman of the Commercial Employees' Union, is firmly opposed 
to Swedish membership in the EU. 
  "I have not decided to take part in the campaign work. But 
it 
may be necessary to counteract the affirmative union figures who 
travel around the country on propaganda tours," he told SD 
[SVENSKA DAGBLADET]. 
<H5>  Concerned About Statements </H5>
  Anders Lindstrom, chairman of the Seamen's Union, and Sune 
Ekbage, chairman of the Papermill Workers' Union, have been on 
the side of the proponents for some time, and the day before 
yesterday they were joined by Goran Johnsson, chairman of the 
Metalworkers' Union. 
  "It concerns me that Bertil Jonsson, the chairman of the LO 
[Federation of Trade Unions], is also so outspoken in advocating 
Swedish membership. There has been no decision within the LO on 
what stand the federation will take, but in spite of this our 
chairman is working hard for a yes vote in the popular 
referendum," Pettersson criticized. 
  Therefore when the LO executive committee met on Monday [11 
April], Pettersson requested a discussion of the chairman's 
conduct with regard to the referendum before the organization 
had reached any decision. 
  "I think Jonsson should act as Stig Malm did when he was 
chairman. He did not become involved on either the yes or the no 
side," Pettersson said. 
<H5>  Commercial Union Neutral </H5>
  However the executive committee of the Commercial Employees' 
Union did not decide to oppose membership in spite of having 11 
opponents and only two proponents on the committee. It decided 
that the union should remain neutral on the referendum and leave 
members free to make up their minds individually. 
  "The question of membership is so complex and complicated 
that the union aspects represent only part of membership," 
Pettersson said and went on: 
  "The direction of economic policy, foreign policy and 
military cooperation, and a monetary union are all questions 
that everyone must take a stand on. And the leaders of the 
Commercial Employees' Union are no better qualified than anyone 
else to analyze and evaluate these questions." 
  For LO the message is that the split on the EU issue within 
the federation, which was already great, has widened even more. 
Therefore everything currently points to an LO decision to 
remain neutral on the referendum. 
<H5>  Hotel Workers' Union Opposed </H5>
  On the yes side today are the Metalworkers' Union and the 
Papermill Workers' Union. Within a short time they will probably 
be joined by some more union organizations with industrial ties. 
The Industrial Workers' Union and the Woodworkers' Union are the 
ones closest to the yes line. 
  But they are more than outweighed by the no side. The Hotel 
and Restaurant Workers' Union and the Insurance Employees' 
Unions are already there. 
  An extensive deliberation is taking place within the 
Transport Workers' Union, but the final result is expected to be 
opposition to Swedish EU membership. 
  The Construction Workers' Union will respond after they hold 
their congress in August, and the Public Employees' Union will 
take a stand in the late fall after a deliberation. 
  LO's biggest union, Municipal Employees, is currently 
leaning 
toward following the example of the Commercial Employees' Union 
and not taking a stand at all but leaving it up to the members 
without making a central recommendation. 
<H5>  Rejection Demanded </H5>
  Motions to be considered at the union congress in June call 
for the union to reject Swedish EU membership. 
  The union's executive committee has not yet responded to the 
motions. 
  The Graphic Arts Employees' Union has already decided not to 
take a central stand. The union contains both high-profile 
advocates and opponents of EU membership. 
  Thus it is virtually impossible for the LO leadership, which 
publicly applauded the negotiating results between Sweden and 
the EU, especially the future status of collective agreements, 
to bring the widely separated opinions together to form a 
consensus opinion. 
  But the LO is not the only organization that will probably 
keep quiet in the EU referendum. TCO [Central Organization of 
Salaried Employees] and SACO [Swedish Confederation of 
Professional Associations] also have no plans to reach a 
decision or issue recommendations on how their members should 
vote on the membership question. 
  Thus the central union organizations will not advocate 
Swedish EU membership prior to the referendum. 
  Individual unions can play that role. But judging from the 
Metalworkers' Union's affirmation of EU membership, the campaign 
will be low-key and defensive. 
<H5>  Discussion Urged </H5>
  The decision by the executive committee of the Metalworkers' 
Union does not mean a recommendation to its members to vote yes, 
despite the committee's approval. 
  Instead the members are urged to discuss the issue in depth 
and study the union leadership's opinions and the reasons behind 
them. 
  The industrial workers' labor colleague, SIF [Swedish Union 
of Clerical and Technical Employees in Industry], has already 
decided not to issue any central recommendations on how its 
members should vote.

<F P=106> [Article by Finnish News Service correspondent in Goteborg: </F>
"Volvo Factory for Vyborg?"] 
  [Text] The Swedish carmaker Volvo may be forced to start 
assembling automobiles in Russia. Though this has been under 
examination by the company, high import duties have given the 
issue new impetus. 
  A possible location is the harbor of Vysotsk in Vyborg; 
another is St. Petersburg, where cutbacks in the military 
industry have left many vacant facilities. 
  "We are looking at many conceivable locations for an 
assembly 
plant in Russia, but no decision has been made on production," 
says Olle Odsell, public relations chief of Volvo Cars 
International. 
  What has spurred Volvo's interest in assembling cars in 
Russia are the high import duties and other taxes that that 
country has recently imposed on imported cars. 
  "Import duties and other fees now total 146 percent of the 
invoiced price of the car," says Odsell. "In this situation it 
will be interesting to see if it would be possible to avoid at 
least some of these by putting cars together in Russia." 
  Volvo's decision is dependent on how tax and import 
regulations are going to look in Russia over the foreseeable 
future. Rumors are circulating that they are going to be lowered 
again. 
  "Only if the import duties stay at the present high level 
will it be profitable for Volvo to establish itself there," says 
Odsell. "It is more expensive to assemble them in Goteborg. 
Shipping and assembling are associated costs, plus the 
investments that would have to be made." 
<H5>  Many Aspects </H5>
  Volvo must also take other aspects into account. There are 
no 
plants in Vyborg, so everything would have to be constructed 
from the ground up. In St. Petersburg, already a year ago, Mayor 
Sobchak offered to let Volvo start production in the city's 
military plants. Labor force availability is also an important 
consideration. 
  The car model being looked at is the 940 series, and a 
diagram on capacity was presented in the [business] daily DAGENS 
INDUSTRI some time ago suggesting 10,000 units annually. 
  Volvo equipped and trained 28 authorized dealers last year 
in 
Russia, and they sold around 7,000 cars. The high import duties, 
which have more than doubled the price for a new Volvo since the 
beginning of this year, has meant that many dealers are having 
big problems in selling any cars at all. 
  Pekka Perttiniemi, chief of Volvo Cars International in 
Russia, said to DAGENS INDUSTRI: "For logical reasons we will 
locate near the border with Finland, and therefore the harbor 
Vysotsk is a better alternative. Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak wanted 
to attract us there a year ago. At that time we had no plans for 
starting up assembly operations, since we could import cars and 
sell them. St. Petersburg is still one of the alternatives we 
are studying," said Perttiniemi.

<F P=106> [Report by Andreas Khatzikiriakos] </F>
  [Text] A reliable source yesterday told O FILELEVTHEROS 
that the UN secretary general's report to the Security Council 
can only be blocked if Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas gives 
clear and positive answers on the issues of the map and 
Famagusta's fenced-off area. Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary 
general's alternate special representative in Cyprus, said: 
"There are no plans to delay submission of the report further." 
  With the entire procedure having lost a significant part of 
its credibility, however, Nicosia appears to have reservations 
about the assurances it has been given. These reservations are 
intensifying because Britain and the United States expect 
Denktas to give a positive answer by tomorrow and because, in 
case of an agreement, it is unclear if the two sides will accept 
the same things. 
  In a statement to O FILELEVTHEROS, Feissel categorically 
denied allegations that on Monday [23 May] Robert Lamb, the U.S. 
State Department's special coordinator on the Cyprus issue, made 
some proposals that concerned the Cypriot Government. Feissel 
reiterated that the substantive portion of the UN document 
cannot be changed. 
  Feissel specifically denied that: 
  a) The creation of two separate customs offices at Nicosia 
International Airport was proposed; 
  b) Access by Greek Cypriots to Famagusta will be controlled 
by Turkish Cypriot policemen in civilian clothes; 
  c) A number of countries will allow Turkish Cypriots to 
enter 
by using "Turkish Cypriot passports;" 
  d) He had agreed to Turkish Cypriot control of access to 
Famagusta; 
  e) The aircraft of the "Turkish Cypriot Airlines" will bear 
the pseudostate's emblem; 
  f) Turkish Cypriot troops will use the Dherynia-Famagusta 
road. 
  It is worth noting that an official government statement 
that 
was issued last Monday referred to two additional proposals, 
distinct from the six mentioned above, but Feissel refused to 
comment on them. Those were that both sides would make an equal 
number of flights from Nicosia International Airport and that 
troops would remain in the southern part of the fenced-off area. 
  A reliable source told O FILELEVTHEROS that the procedure 
for 
the submission of the UN secretary general's report has been set 
in motion, clarifying that "if nothing happens, the report will 
be full, complete, and detailed." 
  The same source said: "The only development that could 
prevent the report from being submitted would be an agreement on 
the confidence-building measures, something that both sides 
agree on." He added that the main issues on which the Turkish 
side must give clear answers are the map--a yes or no answer is 
required--and the issue of access. He said: "A specific 
settlement is proposed regarding access, and we want an answer 
on it." 
  For his part, Government Spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis did 
not rule out that Denktas might make some maneuver. Asked for a 
general evaluation of the situation, Kasoulidhis said: "It is 
difficult to make a general evaluation because the Turkish 
side's moves are unpredictable." 
  O FILELEVTHEROS has learned the United States has sent a 
message to the Cypriot Government which mentions that Denktas 
will accept the confidence-building measures after a meeting of 
the so-called "ministerial council" and the pseudoparliament. 
  U.S. Ambassador in Nicosia Richard Boucher yesterday said 
"the main point of the entire effort is to find an operational 
settlement that will enable both sides to use the basic changes 
stemming from the confidence-building measures." He also 
appeared to be impatient for the report to circulate, adding 
that this would prompt the Security Council to study alternative 
ways of action. Boucher also admitted that the obstacles have 
not been overcome.

  [Text] Nicosia, May 25 (CNA)--U.S. Ambassador to Cyprus 
Richard Boucher denied here Wednesday [24 May] reports in the 
Turkish Cypriot press claiming that the U.S. had made promises 
to the Turkish Cypriots in a bid to achieve agreement on a UN 
package of confidence building measures. 
  The reports alleged that U.S. State Department Special 
Coordinator on Cyprus Robert Lamb had made several promises to 
the Turkish Cypriot side in Vienna last week to gain their 
acceptance of the UN measures. 
  The reports said Lamb's promises met many Turkish Cypriot 
demands concerning the reopening of Nicosia International 
Airport and access to part of the Turkish-occupied town of 
Varosha, which will come under UN administration under the 
UN-proposed measures. 
  Boucher's denial was echoed by Government Spokesman Ioannis 
Kasoulidhis, who said at his daily press briefing the Government 
had no official confirmation of the Turkish Cypriot reports. 
  Asked to say whether Lamb had made the promises, as these 
appeared in the Turkish Cypriot press, Boucher replied "the 
reports that have appeared in the press were not true, the 
specifics of the reports are not well reported." 
  However he acknowledged the importance of issues concerning 
travelling of Turkish Cypriots and access to Varosha, issues on 
which an answer is still awaited from the Turkish side. 
  He said the Vienna talks focussed on explaining to the 
Turkish Cypriot side some points to which it objected, included 
in the UN package of measures. 
  Boucher reaffirmed that the March 21 document prepared by 
the 
UN remained "the document that is the basis for reaching 
agreement." 
  Kasoulidhis told the press that there was no official 
confirmation from the American side of the Turkish Cypriot 
reports. 
  The spokesman said the U.S. assessment of the situation 
coincided with that of the UN and stressed that the government 
had had no official confirmation from anybody of the press 
reports. 
  UN Secretary-General's resident representative in Cyprus 
Gustave Feissel denied categorically the truthfulness of the 
reports. 
  The issues of separate customs offices at Nicosia Airport, 
the use of so-called Turkish Cypriot passports, the presence of 
Turkish Cypriot police officers in civilian clothes on the 
access road to Varosha and the use of the logo of the Turkish 
Cypriot illegal regime on their aircraft are points which the 
reports claimed were promised to the Turkish Cypriot side. 
  "It has been clarified to us that no such promises were 
given 
on these issues," Kasoulidhis said. 
  "The Greek Cypriot side does not accept the presence of 
Turkish troops in the area to be unmanned, south of Varosha, 
leading to the town," Kasoulidhis added. 
  He noted that efforts were still being made on the issue of 
access to Varosha and the area of the town that is to be 
returned to UN administration, in accordance to the UN measures.

  [Text] The TRNC [Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus] 
Council of Ministers convened under President Rauf Denktas at 
1600 today in a meeting that lasted nearly two hours. In a 
statement after the meeting, Denktas said that he will meet 
Gustav Feissel, the UN secretary general's deputy special 
representative, at a luncheon tomorrow. He also said that he 
will inform the Council of Ministers on the outcome of his 
talks. Denktas asserted: 
  [Begin Denktas recording] I will inform the Council of 
Ministers on the outcome of the talks I will have with Mr. 
Feissel. Meanwhile, the political party leaders may be satisfied 
with the outcome. We may find an opportunity to decide what we 
shall do. [end recording] 
  President Denktas also replied to correspondents' questions. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Will you 
submit a new proposal? 
  [Denktas] No, I will not. However, several questions remain 
unanswered. We shall ask that they be answered so we can 
complete our assessment. 
  [Correspondent] Will Feissel hold talks with the Greek 
Cypriot leaders after he meets with you? Will he then come back 
to brief you? 
  [Denktas] No. I am not aware of what Feissel plans to do. 
We shall not have any surprises for him. He is aware of the 
issues. However, we have to discuss them in detail. 
  [Correspondent] Can you comment on the unanswered questions? 
  [Denktas] Actually, they have been answered. However, they 
are still vague. We want to have them clarified. 
  [Correspondent] Will the government's representatives, 
particularly Prime Minister Hakki Atun and Deputy Prime Minister 
Ozker Ozgur, attend your meeting with Feissel? 
  [Denktas] Yes, they will attend. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. President, are the vague issues related 
to the airports to which the Turkish Cypriot passenger aircraft 
will be allowed to fly and the passports the Turkish Cypriots 
will use when they travel abroad? 
  [Denktas] Statements have been made to the effect that we 
received many things at the Vienna talks and that progress has 
been made. Meanwhile, we have been informed that certain issues 
can be resolved. After studying the documents, we have come up 
with several questions on those matters. Therefore, we shall 
try to clarify them. 
  [Correspondent] Would the Turkish Cypriot side decide to 
give 
a definite reply if Feissel maintains a positive approach at the 
luncheon? 
  [Denktas] Well, I hope so. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by K. Kiriakidhis] </F>
  [Excerpt] Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller assured the 
British and U.S. Governments that Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf 
Denktas will finally give a positive answer on the 
confidence-building measures. 
  According to I MAKHI's information, a diplomatic source in 
Nicosia (from a country that is a permanent UN Security Council 
member) said the message has already been conveyed to the Greek 
Cypriot side to calm concerns created by the delay in the 
submission of UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's report. 
British officials believe Denktas will accept the 21 March UN 
document on the confidence-building measures and express this 
position openly. 
  During a dinner on 23 May for Greek Cypriot political 
leaders, British Deputy Foreign Secretary Tom Richardson 
revealed that at the end of the past week the Turkish side asked 
for a 10-day deadline to give Denktas the chance to "manipulate" 
his "sudden" change toward accepting the measures. The British 
official even asked the party leaders or representatives for 
their views on how the talks procedure can move to the next 
stage, that is, discussion of the substance of the Cyprus issue. 
He asked the leaders for their views on Butrus-Ghali's set of 
ideas, which the United Nations considers the basis for talks on 
the substance of the Cyprus issue. 
  According to I MAKHI, despite the assurances that the 
Cypriot 
Government received, it remains dissatisfied and disappointed 
with the supportive stance that it believes the United States is 
showing. The Greek Cypriot side believes the U.S. stance is 
encouraging Turkish intransigence and facilitating Turkish 
maneuvers. It also expresses strong concerns that Denktas will 
finally accept the confidence-building measures "with 
conditions" (something that is categorically rejected). 
  Yesterday, for the first time in public and after a week's 
delay, U.S. Ambassador in Nicosia Richard Boucher described as 
false Turkish Cypriot press reports that at the Vienna talks, 
Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department's special coordinator on 
the Cyprus issue, submitted new proposals that change the 21 
March document. I MAKHI reported yesterday that during his 
meeting with Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis the day before 
yesterday, the U.S. ambassador made the same explicit denial. 
  Speaking at the U.S. stand at the International State Fair, 
the U.S. ambassador mentioned that an effort was made in Vienna 
to understand the confidence-building measures and overcome the 
obstacles. He noted that the United States insists on 
implementing the confidence-building measures, adding that the 
ongoing efforts include studying alternative ways of action for 
accepting the package. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has said that 
it will not be beneficial for the UN secretary general to 
present a report to the UN Security Council while talks on 
confidence-building measures are continuing. Cetin departed for 
Paris to attend the opening conference of the European Stability 
Pact. 
  In a predeparture news conference at Ankara's Esenboga 
Airport, Cetin answered a question on the report by UN Secretary 
General Butrus-Ghali. He said: The report has not yet been 
published. Actually, publishing a report when talks are 
continuing may harm the negotiations. For this reason, the 
report should be published after the talks end. 
  In answer to another question, Cetin reiterated that 
President Rauf Denktas will go to Turkey over the weekend and 
meet with President Suleyman Demirel.

  [Text] Ankara, May 25 (AFP)--Turkey accused Greece 
Wednesday [25 May] of training guerrilla units in the separatist 
Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) to carry out attacks on economic, 
military and tourist targets. 
  Greek ambassador to Ankara Alexandros Philon was summoned 
May 
18 to the Turkish foreign ministry to be told of "confessions" 
made by a group of PKK members recently arrested by police in 
Istanbul, a Turkish government source told AFP. 
  The source said a group of 20 PKK militants arrived in 
Athens 
from Frankfurt last February to be trained for bomb attacks on 
targets in Ankara, Istanbul and Antalya, Turkey's main 
Mediterranean spa resort. 
  They entered Turkey by crossing the river Maritsa, which 
runs 
along the Greek-Turkish border. Turkish police had since seized 
documents relating to a series of planned attacks, the source 
added. 
  Unal Unsal, a junior minister in the foreign ministry, 
passed 
the information on to the Greek ambassador and demanded an 
explanation over what the government source called "a very 
serious development." He added that the British, German, French 
and U.S. ambassadors had also been summoned for a briefing on 
the issue. 
  Four bomb attacks, all attributed to the PKK, have been 
carried out at tourist attractions in Istanbul since March 24, 
killing two foreign tourists and injuring a total of 22 people. 
  In a related development, 14 Kurdish rebels have been killed 
in military operations since Tuesday in the provinces of Mus and 
Bingol in eastern Turkey, officials in Diyarbakir said, while 
the bodies of 28 rebels killed in recent clashes near the Iraqi, 
Iranian and Syrian borders were also reportedly recovered. 
  The latest deaths brought to at least 469 the number of 
rebels killed by security forces since May 1. Almost 2,000 
people, including 122 civilians, are believed to have died in 
unrest this year, while almost 13,000 have died in 10 years of 
conflict since the Kurds began their uprising. 
  President Suleyman Demirel called for PKK members to hand 
themselves in to the authorities, saying there was "no way out" 
for them in their battle with the state.

  [Excerpt] Unal Erkan, state of emergency region governor, 
has announced that 607 terrorists were neutralized in operations 
conducted by security forces during the month of May. Speaking 
to citizens in Bingol, Erkan remarked that the terrorist 
organization is on the verge of collapse as a result of 
successful work and that the terrorists are left with the 
options of dying or surrendering. 
  [Begin Erkan recording] Also last month, 500 terrorists were 
killed. Can an organization survive if it loses 500-600 
terrorists in one month? This is not possible in the face of 
our state and our nation. We will conclude this matter. There 
are also other schemes involved. We will be careful. [end 
recording] 
  Stressing that the organization is also serving the 
interests 
of foreign forces, Erkan noted that the pictures of the 
terrorist organization's leader with Armenian priests appeared 
in some press organs. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Ugur Sefkat: "Alliance Between the PKK and </F>
Armenians"] 
  [Text] Ankara--Concrete documentation has been compiled on 
the "cooperation between the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] 
and the Armenians." The Turkish Government has known of the 
cooperation between the PKK and the Armenians for many years, 
but the issue was consistently denied by circles supporting that 
organization. 
  It has been established that PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan 
received funds and arms from Armenia through Armenian priests in 
Lebanon. Ocalan's links with the Armenian priests have been 
documented with photographs. The intelligence units have tried 
to document the cooperation between the PKK and the Armenians 
for years. They had an opportunity to do so in Bar Ilyas in 
al-Biqa' Valley on Tuesday, 3 May. The intelligence units 
established that the priests of the Gregorian Church in Lebanon 
frequently call on Ocalan, who occasionally travels from Syria 
to the small town in al-Biqa' Valley. They took action and 
documented the most recent meeting he had with the Armenian 
priests by taking their photographs. Ocalan, considering that he 
is no longer comfortable in Syria or Lebanon, conferred with his 
guests on the possibility of moving to Armenia. The extremist 
Dachnak Party in Armenia has occasionally provided the PKK with 
funds and arms through the Armenian priests in Lebanon. 
  Most Armenians are affiliated with the Gregorian Church, 
which has close links with the Orthodox faith. Its patriarch 
lives in Echmiadzin, which is near Yerevan. The Armenians in 
Lebanon have very strong links with Echmiadzin. The church in 
Echmiadzin has significant influence with the Armenian 
Government. 
  Armenians reportedly make up a third of the PKK's 
4,000-member mountain cadre and the Armenians in Syria play an 
effective role in the organization. The commanders of the PKK's 
mountain cadres are Armenian. Officials have said that this has 
been confirmed by the many uncircumcised militants the security 
forces have discovered among the PKK members killed or captured 
in operations. 
<H5>  Orders To Kill Sakik </H5>
  The recent blows the security forces have dealt the PKK have 
created confusion among the leading members of the organization. 
PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan has instructed his militants to kill 
Muslum Durgun, alias Dr. Baran, and Semdin Sakik, alias 
Parmaksiz Zeki. Both were among the most important members of 
the PKK. Sakik was the provincial commander of what the PKK 
calls Amed Province. He has been living in a camp in Danbak, 
north of Maku in Iran, since 5 April. Ocalan ordered his 
militants to kill Sakik because he criticized his decisions. 
Regarding Sakik's case, Ocalan reportedly instructed Cemil 
Bayik, commander of the PKK Kurdish People's Liberation Army, as 
follows: "Sakik has adopted a defeatist approach. He will pay 
for it with his head. Put him before a firing squad." 
  It was Sakik who ordered a group of PKK militants to kill 33 
unarmed soldiers in Bingol Province in 1993. But his remarks to 
a group of leading PKK members in the camp in Danbak on 8 May 
prompted Ocalan to order his militants to kill him. Sakik 
reportedly said: "Insensitive parasites who have a lust for 
luxury are as dangerous as the enemy. The cause cannot be 
maintained with leaders who fail to establish the enemy's 
tactics in the war and who are unable to give accurate and 
effective instructions. A wounded man cannot see the outcome of 
an action. It is a virtue to decide to withdraw."

<F P=106> [All Names rendered in Kurdish] </F>
  [Text] Garzan/KURDISH NEWS AGENCY--The Workers Party of 
Kurdistan [PKK] and the Kurdish People's Liberation Army Command 
Headquarters in Garzan and Amed Provinces have revealed the 
number of villages burned down and the number of villagers 
killed by the state forces in their recent operations in 
southeast Turkey. The two command headquarters distributed 
leaflets to the newspapers and the people to inform them that 74 
villages and 10 farming settlements were razed, nine villages 
partly destroyed, and 36 villagers and all the men in 10 farming 
settlements have been missing for some time. The leaflets also 
expressed condolences over the dead villagers. 
  Asserting that the Turkish state's move that began 10 years 
ago to force the Kurdish people to emigrate and become a 
community without a homeland has peaked, the two command 
headquarters argued that the security forces, which are involved 
in the spring operation against the PKK, have tried to force the 
Kurdish people to agree to register as village guards, burned 
down several houses in various villages, and compelled the 
people to emigrate. The leaflets said: "The wide-ranging 
operations launched at the end of April and maintained without 
interruption have clearly indicated the objectives of the 
security forces. The Kurdish people are faced with the threat 
of being forced to emigrate from Turkey, as was the case from 
1925 to 1940. The state forces have burned down villages to 
force the people to emigrate and to stop them from going back. 
They do not fail to shoot and kill people from the villages 
after accusing them of being terrorists." 
  The leaflets stressed that the Turkish State regards the 
Kurds as a potential threat and a rebel community, and noted 
that it has moved to burn and destroy the entire region step by 
step in order to prevent them from organizing resistance against 
the security forces. They begin with the areas where the people 
rebelled against the government in the past -- that is, areas 
such as Palu and Dersim. The leaflets also noted that all rural 
areas have been declared out of bounds and the military troops 
have been ordered to shoot and kill anyone they suspect. They 
said: "The tactic in the recent operations is as follows: The 
Turkish state deploys large military units with heavy arms to 
evict the people from particular areas. Those areas are then 
pounded with bombs. The security forces predetermine the people 
who must die in the areas. They shoot and kill them during the 
operations, and evict the survivors from their villages. The 
evicted people are not allowed to go back to their property, 
which is set on fire and destroyed. The Turkish state no longer 
bothers to accuse the villagers it evicts from their homes of 
`aiding and abetting the guerrillas,' as it did in the past. 
Every Kurd who refuses to be an agent for the Turkish state; to 
serve as a member of the village guard units, which are merely 
armed bands; or to commit treachery against his community is 
regarded as a `terrorist,' selected as a target, and shot and 
killed -- regardless that they are unarmed and innocent 
villagers. Such acts of violence are occurring before the eyes 
of the world in Kurdistan in general and in Amed and Garzan 
Provinces in particular." 
  The leaflets said that 74 villages and 10 farming 
settlements 
were burned down, nine villages partly destroyed, and 36 
villagers and all of the men in 10 farming settlements reported 
missing in the recent operations. They urged the local and 
international media organs to send their representatives in 
order to verify the situation on the spot.

  [Text] The rout suffered by the PKK [Workers Party of 
Kurdistan] at the hands of the security forces in recent days 
has been admitted by Abdullah Ocalan, the leader of the 
organization. Ocalan severely warned the members of the 
organization, saying that there has been an incredible number of 
losses. 
  [Correspondent Fatih Yilmaz] According to available 
information, Ocalan said in his message to PKK field commanders 
the previous day that those responsible for the losses will be 
punished. Ocalan demanded that those not fighting voluntarily be 
dismissed from the organization, and called on the PKK to carry 
out low risk operations such as laying mines, sabotage, and 
putting up road blocks. The PKK conducted operations to lay 
mines and roadblocks yesterday. 
  In his message, PKK leader Ocalan said the losses suffered 
by 
the organization in Pulumur and Dogubeyazit are unacceptably 
high. He made the following assessment: The field commanders 
are misleading me, the information they provide does not conform 
with reality. 
  The PKK suffered huge losses during operations carried out 
by 
the security forces in the last few months. 
  Meanwhile, the mop-up operation launched by the security 
forces on Cudi Mountain is continuing. It is reported that 
major losses has been inflicted on the PKK.

  [Text] Jalal Talabani, leader of the Iraqi Patriotic Union 
of Kurdistan [PUK], has placed his hopes on Turkey in his effort 
to go to northern Iraq. Ankara gave a positive reply to 
Talabani's request to go to northern Iraq via Turkey. The 
meeting between Talabani and [Democratic party of Kurdistan 
Mas'ud] Barzani will not take place in Silopi. 
  [Correspondent Fatih Yilmaz] Talabani was abroad when the 
clashes started in northern Iraq on 2 May. When the clashes 
intensified, Talabani got as far as the Syrian capital of 
Damascus, but could not proceed to northern Iraq from there. In 
order to go to his region in northern Iraq from Damascus, 
Talabani has to pass through a region under Barzani's control. 
Talabani had said that he could go to northern Iraq on 
condition that Barzani meet him at the border. 
  As a last hope, Talabani appealed to Turkey. Ankara gave a 
positive reply to Talabani's request to go to northern Iraq via 
Turkey. It is expected that Talabani will enter Turkey in the 
next few days. Turkey supported Barzani during the clashes in 
northern Iraq. An important factor in this were the close ties 
Talabani had established with the PKK [Workers Party of 
Kurdistan]. 
  The Talabani-Barzani summit that was expected to be held in 
Silopi is now regarded as highly unlikely.

  [Text] Brussels, May 25 (AFP) -- The Commission of the 
European Union has decided to investigate a plan by the French 
Government to inject 20 billion francs (3.5 billion dollars) 
into the Air France airline, an EU spokesman said on Wednesday 
[25 May]. 
  The enquiry is a normal procedure under European treaties to 
ensure that state aid does not interfere unfairly with 
competition between companies in different countries of the 
union. 
  Air France is in severe financial difficulties. The 
Commission recently instructed France to give foreign airlines 
access to Orly airport south of Paris, effectively opening the 
French domestic market to competition. 
  Air France, and its domestic subsidiary Air Inter, saw this 
as adding to their commercial problems. 
  The Commission said that it wanted to be sure that aid for 
the restructuring of Air France would have the expected effect 
on the company and on the whole group and that the size of the 
recapitalisation was not disproportinate in relation to the 
problem, the spokesman said. 
  At the beginning of March Air France had put forward a 
recapitalisation plan requiring the state to provide 20 billion 
francs. Under the plan the company would shed 5,000 jobs 
without redundancies. The new capital would be provided in 
three portions over three years. 
  Air France, which made a loss of 8.48 billion francs (1.5 
billion dollars) in 1993, has said that it plans to freeze pay 
for three years, to reduce the number of airliners it operates 
and to reduce its purchasing programme. 
  The French Government put this plan before the Commission in 
March. The Commission, following the standard procedure, has 
now decided to open an enquiry to be sure that the aid is 
compatible with EU law. 
  The Commission wanted to be sure that the aid would be the 
last to be received by the company and would not be used to 
acquire shares in other EU airlines, the Commission said. 
  The aid must not disrupt the market on routes on which 
companies in the Air France group competed with other European 
airliners, it said. 
  The Commission hoped to reach a conclusion before the summer 
holidays because it was conscious of the urgency of the case. 
  The aid could not be paid until the investigation had been 
competed, the spokesman said. 
  The Commission is already probing Air France, under an 
enquiry begun in November, in connection with the issue of 
shares to raise 1.5 billion francs (265 million dollars) which 
were underwritten by the French state-controlled deposit 
organisation the Caisse des Depots et Consignations Francaise. 
  In Paris on Wednesday the government approved a bill which 
would enable the state to issue shares in Air France to 
employees who agreed that their pay be frozen for three years.

<F P=106> [Barbara Ruete report from Brussels] </F>
  [Excerpt] When the Russian defense minister entered the 
NATO building this morning, hopes were high that Russia would 
recognize the Western alliance as the supreme military and 
political body. However, in his speech at the NATO Cooperation 
Council, Grachev presented his vision. Russia would like to 
expand the CSCE to the supreme political body. In this 
roundabout way, the big power would again get a greater say in 
important decisions. This is categorically rejected by NATO. 
  [Begin Defense Minister Volker Ruehe recording] We see the 
CSCE as a roof, but what NATO is doing for stability in Europe 
cannot be replaced by the CSCE. I do not advocate that Russia 
become a NATO member, but I advocate that the Central and East 
European states can become NATO members. Regarding Russia, I 
advocate a broad dialogue, for instance also about issues that 
go beyond the Partnership for Peace. [end recording] [passage 
omitted] 
  [Vienna ORF Television Network in German at 1730 GMT carries 
a similar report about the NATO meeting in Brussels, where Ruehe 
is shown as saying: "I think that Russia's position is 
justified. Who could be more interested than we are in talking 
with the Russians, for instance about nonproliferation and about 
the safety of nuclear weapons?"]

was not initially planned that the FAR would have this kind of 
unit, confining itself to light infantry forces, the experience 
of participation in the UN mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina has

plans that currently being drafted by the staffs of the three 
services and that are at their final stage of completion. With 
the document approved by the defense minister on 25 January -- 
the new Strategic Concept will in turn be incorporated in the 
final Joint Strategic Plan, which, according to the Defense 
Ministry's forecasts, could be approved before the summer. 
  The Army wishes to reinforce the FAR through the Master Plan 
with equipment -- especially reconnaissance armored vehicles -- 
in order to provide it with semiheavy equipment capable of 
carrying out reconnaissance missions and equipped with a gun of 
at least 25-mm calibers. 
  The experience of the various battalions in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina has shown the need for these resources, to 
such an extent that it is stated in military circles that 
Operation Alfa Bravo has marked the rediscovery of armored. 
vehicles 
  For this reason, the FAR will have a unit comprised of two 
battalions charged with reconnaissance and protection tasks. 
The sources consulted stated that it will almost certainly be 
based in Valladolid, although Valencia was initially chosen for 
its location. Two regiments belonging to the Jarama Brigade, 
destined to become at the most a territorial defense unit -- 
that is, with personnel not exceeding 30 percent of its 
potential, in accordance with the Master Plan -- are currently 
based in Valladolid. 
  In the latest drafts of this plan it is ruled out that the 
FAMET (Army Airmobile Forces) will be completely incorporated 
into the FAR -- the main unit to be deployed in the event of a 
crisis or for participation in international missions. The 
aforementioned sources stated that only a proportion of their 
six battalions will be assigned. 
  In addition, it is confirmed that the FAR's three main units 
will be the Paratroopers Brigade, the Legionnaires Brigade, and 
the Light Airborne Brigade, although some changes in their 
deployment have been envisaged. In the case of the 
Legionnnaires Brigade, the idea of moving the 4th Corps from 
Ronda to the Viator base in Almeria seems to have been dropped. 
The military chiefs believe it would be a waste to abandon its 
current facilities there. 
  In this event, only the 3d Corps in Fuerteventura will move 
to Almeria, to be joined by an artillery group as well as a 
logistical unit. Units outside the peninsula in Ceuta and 
Melilla will remain in their current locations. 
  The idea is that, within the FAR itself, the Paratroopers 
Brigade and the Legionnaires Brigade will be the initial 
reaction group, while the Light Airborne Brigade, with bases in 
Galicia and Asturias, would be the second echelon to be deployed. 
  In addition, the FAR staff, under the command of General 
Victor Suances, will remain in charge of Operation Alfa Bravo, 
although the Cordoba Group's units belong not to that unit but 
to the Southern Operational Command and to the brigades within 
the Reaction Force.

  [Text] Government Spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis today said 
that President Glavkos Kliridhis wants an agreement on the 
confidence-building measures, because he firmly believes such an 
agreement would break the impasse on the Cyprus issue and open 
the way for a Cyprus solution. He added, however, that this 
agreement must meet the 21 March deadline of the UN document. 
  Kasoulidhis said it is important to defend Cypriot 
Hellenism's interests, adding that these are valued above all 
else. He called on Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas to 
accept the 21 March document if he wants an agreement. 
  The government spokesman said the continuing delay in 
submitting the UN secretary general's report to the Security 
Council prompted the Greek Cypriot side to protest vigorously, 
but also gave it an opportunity to clarify its position. He 
said: It is important for the United Nations, the United 
States, Britain, and anyone else who is interested to know that 
we will not accept any changes to the 21 March UN document. 
  Asked if the government considers the Vienna talks to be a 
deviation from the procedure, the spokesman said that if the 
outcome of the talks is the amending of the 21 March document 
then it certainly would be a deviation. He added, however, that 
if the outcome is that the Turkish Cypriot side is persuaded to 
accept the document as is, then it would not be a deviation. 
  Kasoulidhis said the Greek Cypriot side will not accept the 
presence of Turkish troops in the area stretching from the 
Dherynia road to the sea. The spokesman said the United Nations 
clarified to the Cypriot Government that no promises were given, 
contrary to what the Turkish Cypriot press had reported. He 
added: As Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's alternate 
special representative in Cyprus, admitted, efforts are being 
made on the issues of access and the Famagusta map.

  [Text] Turkey has welcomed the fact that the UN 
International Maritime Organization accepted the package of 
rules and proposals to enhance the safety of passages through 
the Istanbul and Canakkale Straits. 
  A Foreign Ministry statement noted that regulating the 
traffic in the straits will benefit all interested parties. The 
statement remarked that the new statute pertaining to the 
passage through the straits was prepared in line with basic 
international rules of law, which stipulate that every country 
can determine the procedures in the waters under its own 
sovereignty in order to ensure maritime safety and environmental 
protection. This statute will go into effect on 1 July 1994, 
the statement noted, adding that the new statute will continue 
to adhere meticulously to the Montreux Convention, as was the 
case in the past.

  [Excerpts] Responding to daily criticism by Bernard-Henri 
Levy and his gang, President Francois Mitterrand is standing 
firm on his Bosnia policy. [passage omitted] The president has 
taken his arguments further in a long and fascinating interview 
given to the weekly NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR. Jerome d'Orville has 
the details: 
  [d'Orville] Mitterrand has given his firm support to the 
government against [Socialist Party leader] Michel Rocard and 
against Bernard-Henri Levy and his intellectuals. To deny the 
role and the usefulness of the United Nations, he says, would be 
-- under the cover of an apparently pacifist stance -- the 
surest way of prolonging the war. Sarajevo is breathing, and so 
is Gorazde; thanks to whom? the president asks. Francois 
Mitterrand is categorical: condemning negotiation is equivalent 
to opting for war. Today, we can glimpse the chance of a 
peaceful solution, and we have to seize hold of the opportunity, 
he declares. 
  The president does not have very positive things to say 
about 
the situation in Italy either. He describes the circumstances 
in which Silvio Berlusconi came to power as dubious. It is an 
approach to democracy to which we are not accustomed, he says, 
and which seems dangerous. The time has come to say: beware -- 
danger, Mr. Mitterrand asserts, condemning the pressure put on 
public opinion by the vast information networks controlled by 
Mr. Berlusconi. 
  Asked about Algeria, the president says that France should 
welcome those people whose lives are in danger because they have 
chosen progress. 
  Finally, the president speaks of the achievements of the 
Left 
in government, achievements of which he is proud, even though 
Socialist governments have not done enough for equality of 
opportunity. Francois Mitterrand reminds readers that the Left 
has traditionally been a minority in France because conservative 
forces still control the main information networks and the major 
financial centers, and because the administration is permeated 
with their ideology.

<F P=106> [Article by Xavier Gautier: "Conference on Stability in </F>
Europe Starts in Paris Tomorrow -- A Project Limited to Central 
Europe"] 
  [Text] Explicit protection of minority rights; a law 
liberalizing the use of languages and names; a promise to settle 
"alternative" education controversies through negotiation: By 
defusing the nationalist time bomb with a whole series of 
initiatives, the new Slovak Government has probably deprived the 
"Balladur Plan" of a first success. 
  After ousting Vladimir Meciar, Jozef Moravcik's team has set 
to work to settle, in a European spirit, the fate of 1 million 
Hungarians, Ukrainians, and gypsies who share Slovak citizenship 
with the 4.5 million Slovaks of the young Danube republic. 
  "Relations between Slovakia and Hungary have recently 
relaxed," French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe was able to note 
yesterday. He sees in this the early "influence" of the 
Conference on Stability in Europe, which opens in Paris tomorrow 
for two days. The objectives of this "summit" seem fairly 
clear: Inspired by the Madrid Conference, which at the end of 
1991 provided the impetus for the Middle East peace process, 
France decided to help the Central European countries to settle 
"their problems between neighbors." Organized around general 
and bilateral issues, the UNESCO Palace meeting is aimed at 
producing a "pact for stability" by 1995. 
<H5>  Superfluous Initiatives </H5>
  According to Mr. Juppe, this conference is addressed 
exclusively at the countries which want to join the European 
Union [EU], although the 53 CSCE member states are also invited. 
Clearly, only the "new democracies," i.e., Poland, the Czech 
Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Latvia, Estonia, 
and Lithuania, to which little Slovenia was added at the last 
minute, will really be involved. 
  "It is legitimate for the EU to establish not entry 
conditions, but rules of good conduct for them," Mr. Juppe said. 
"It is natural that they should put their house in order as we 
succeeded in doing with Saarland and Alsace," European Affairs 
Minister Alain Lamassoure said at a news conference at the Quai 
d'Orsay [Foreign Ministry] yesterday. 
  The reservations of the countries concerned are well known: 
Prague is surprised to have been placed in the same category as 
other more turbulent capitals, while the Czech-Slovak partition 
served as a model. In Central Europe people are questioning the 
need to increase the number of superfluous initiatives in the 
security sphere. Have the Czech Republic, Poland, or the Baltic 
countries not all applied to join NATO? 
  Of course, the Balladur pact is a diplomatic first by the EU 
but, seen from East Europe, it looks very like a means of making 
the candidates wait patiently in the waiting room of the EU. 
  The foreign minister answered its critics rather bluntly: 
First, "we are not the applicants," he said. Second, "if a 
country participates in the conference, it is not necessarily 
because it has problems (minority or border problems), but 
because it has concerns with regard to these issues." 
  Europe will have to rely on mediators, Mr. Juppe pointed 
out. 
The "good students" of the pact will be able to play this role, 
in his view. So will the United States, which is still 
wondering what it will do in this new group. 
  Russia has declared its support. Andrey Kozyrev, its foreign 
minister, confirmed to Alain Juppe during his visit to Moscow 
his country's explicit support for the conference. This gives a 
considerable boost to a rather heavily criticized initiative. 
The Russian attitude is not free of ulterior motives. Indeed, 
the Kremlin categorically refuses to allow NATO to be 
automatically expanded to the former USSR satellites. It 
continues to give preference to the broadest possible European 
circles. 
  For want of anything better, the Central European countries 
and the former Soviet republics are obliged to cling to what 
they are being offered. Especially because the conference was 
officially stamped "European" at the Twelve's summit in December. 
<H5>  Smallest Common Denominator </H5>
  "Poland's acceptance of the project, presented by France and 
Germany in Warsaw (last November), shows that after being 
accused of being overambitious or not ambitious enough, the 
Conference on Stability has found an equilibrium," Alain Juppe 
commented optimistically. 
  In reality, the Balladur initiative has been based from the 
start on the smallest diplomatic common denominator. 
Discouraged by the fiasco of their policy in the former 
Yugoslavia, the Twelve, who have become Sixteen, deliberately 
excluded from the process the areas of greatest tension: the 
Caucasus, Bosnia, and now Crimea. 
  There is another important question: How can the Sixteen 
aspire to play a mediating role when some of them are directly 
involved in border and minority conflicts? This is true of 
Greece with regard to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, 
Albania, and Cyprus. Nowhere in the plan is Turkey mentioned, 
although it has long been a candidate for EC membership. "Other 
bodies are dealing with these problems," Alain Juppe pointed out. 
  At best, the problem of the Slovak-Hungarian Gabcikovo dam 
will be settled; and perhaps the fate of the Hungarian minority 
in Romanian Transylvania. But the conference is likely to be 
powerless to ensure respect for the agreements resulting from 
it. "It is not a military pact, but a political exercise" the 
French foreign minister said, stalling again. 
  The exercise is likely to be reduced to an attempt to 
protect 
the European club in seclusion -- "our six-month old baby" as 
Alain Juppe proudly calls it.

  [Excerpts] Paris, May 25 (AFP) -- A two-day summit of 57 
countries will be held here from Thursday [26 May] with the aim 
of defusing possible new wars in Europe by settling potential 
border disputes and solving the problems of minorities. 
  The brainchild of French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, 
the 
conference will aim to frame a Stability Pact which would be 
signed by the end of the year for potential new candidates to 
the European Union (EU). 
  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said the summit aimed to 
settle border and minority problems between "countries with the 
vocation of entering the EU," following the collapse of the 
Soviet bloc. [passage omitted] 
  Juppe said the conference, sponsored by the EU as a whole 
and 
to be held at UNESCO headquarters here, would be an "exercise in 
preventive diplomacy" for future EU members. 
  European Affairs Minister Alain Lamassoure said the union, 
while prepared to accept new members, was unwilling to take on 
board "new sources of conflict." 
  The aim was to "provide a political impetus" to handle 
good-neighbour problems "better and quicker," Juppe said. 
  On the agenda will be the big Hungarian minorities in 
Romania 
(1.6 million) and Slovakia (600,000). [passage omitted] 
  Juppe said he hoped an interim conference would be held by 
the end of the year, to be followed by a summit in the first 
since months of 1995 to sign the Stability Pact. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Patrice-Henry Desaubliaux: "Balladur Presents </F>
Military Programming Law"] 
  [Text] Drawn up by Defense Minister Francois Leotard, the 
Military Programming Law could first and foremost be entitled 
"the Balladur law." It was the prime minister who, when he took 
office at the end of March 1993, decided to make the law, 
together with the defense white paper, one of his government's 
priorities. Moreover, he did it even though certain members of 
his majority were suggesting he should wait until the next 
presidential election in 1995. It was Edouard Balladur who 
determine the main policy directions to be taken by this law. 
Above all, it was he who made three important decisions: the 
financial decision to increase investment spending in the 
defense sector by 0.5 percent per year (and by 1.5 percent as of 
1998, if the economic situation permits), despite the law 
limiting public spending; the advance decision not to tie the 
hands of the next president where nuclear defense is concerned; 
and the decision for a "mixed" army which retains the principle 
of conscription while increasing the size of the professional 
forces. 
<H5>  Role of Deterrent </H5>
  Since he bears the ultimate responsibility, Edouard Balladur 
insisted on being the first to speak in yesterday afternoon's 
debate in the National Assembly. He told the deputies that 
above and beyond the budgetary aspects of this Programming Law 
for 1995-2000 were the "major stakes" and an "ambition": "the 
role and place of France in the world." The prime minister 
explained: "It is the government's duty to give our defense 
policy the priority it deserves. As General de Gaulle stated on 
14 June 1952, `the defense of France is the state's main reason 
for being.'" 
  Mr. Balladur stressed: "Who can forget that today, for the 
first time in 50 years, French soldiers are active in fighting 
in Europe itself? The world has lost its traditional points of 
reference since the collapse of the Berlin Wall, and we have 
entered a period of uncertainty." As a result, it was necessary 
"to put a stop to a situation that is unprecedented in the Fifth 
Republic" where, for the last three years, France has not had a 
multiyear defense plan. "We have now marked a decisive turning 
point." It was therefore necessary to increase the military 
equipment budget without, however, "abandoning budget austerity." 
  With regard to deterrence, the prime minister reiterated: 
"The government will take all the measures necessary for our 
deterrent to preserve its key role in our defense strategy. The 
Military Programming Law will provide the state with the means 
of maintaining the credibility of our nuclear arsenal in the 
future. Our nuclear forces will be maintained at the level 
necessary to ensure the protection of our vital interests. A 
major, unprecedented effort will be made in the area of 
simulation and prototypes to prepare for the decisions that will 
have to be made in the coming years concerning the 
specifications of future weapons. Remember that France is not 
under any international constraints. I can assure you that this 
freedom of choice will be preserved." He left no room for 
doubt, even though he did not explicitly mention the issue of 
nuclear testing. On this issue, Francois Leotard later said: 
"Investment credits have been earmarked so that a resumption of 
nuclear testing can resume as soon as the order is given." 
  Will this double government statement calm people like 
Jacques Baumel, who wanted to amend the law to allow a 
resumption of nuclear testing? These people would like to 
respond to the president of the Republic, who not only is 
resolved not to restart nuclear testing right up to the end of 
his term, but who also "does not envision" such a decision being 
made by his successors. They would doubtless also like to see a 
more acrimonious period of cohabitation. Everyone, it seems, in 
the government and in the majority, has adopted Francois 
Leotard's point of view that the issue is not whether tests will 
recommence, but when. 
  In his speech, Edouard Balladur also insisted on what is, 
through the white paper and the programming law, "a major 
development in our defense policy, namely, our European 
commitment." Our defense force, guaranteeing the independence 
and sovereignty of our country, "is also at the disposal of 
Europe." The law will give France "the means of playing a full 
role in the emergence of a European defense policy, while 
remaining wholly aware that this will only be a gradual process 
and will not become a reality until our partners combine their 
forces with ours." 
  The role of France in European security is another issue, 
quite separate from the debate on the programming law. 
Yesterday morning, opening a seminar organized by Senator 
Pierre-Christian Taittinger, a former minister, on "The Atlantic 
Alliance and European Security," Francois Leotard called for a 
change in the Alliance's military organization, to enable "the 
major commands have a disproportionate influence on planning and 
decisionmaking." The defense minister argued that the grouping 
of multinational armed forces was "a significant step," adding 
that Europe should "be seen as an independent political and 
military force." 
  Nonetheless, it has been a struggle to get the famous Common 
Foreign and Security Policy off the ground. To inject a bit of 
dynamism, Pierre Lellouche, (RPR [Rally for the Republic]) 
deputy for the Val-d'Oise department), speaking on behalf of the 
National Assembly's European Community delegation, yesterday 
also made two proposals: the setting up of a European Security 
Council (open just to those states that want to contribute to 
the defense of the European Union) and the creation of a 
European rapid intervention force of 120,000 men from the five 
main European partner states. The European defense system would 
then be based on a structure of "variable geometry."

  [Text] Paris, May 24 (AFP) -- France reserves the right to 
resume nuclear testing, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur said on 
Tuesday [24 May], opening a debate in parliament on the 
country's military programme from 1995 until 2000. 
  Balladur said France was "not under any international 
constraints" on nuclear testing," alluding to a dispute between 
his right-wing government and socialist President Francois 
Mitterrand, who opposes a resumption of tests. 
  "I can assure you that this freedom of choice (to resume 
testing) will be preserved," Balladur said. 
  France has observed a moratorium on nuclear testing since 
April 1992, along with the United States, Russia and Britain. 
China carried out a nuclear test on October 5 last year. 
  Mitterrand, who under the constitution has sole power to 
decide on testing, said recently his successor would in any case 
be unable to order a resumption because his hands would be tied 
by the 1995 renewal of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, to 
be followed by a nuclear test ban treaty. 
  Mitterrand will step down in May 1995 and his successor is 
expected to be a conservative. 
  Balladur told parliament that the military planning bill, 
which calls for an increase in spending of 0.5 percent, urged "a 
major unprecedented effort" to simulate and miniaturise the 
nuclear weapons of the future which would guarantee "the 
credibility of our nuclear arsenal." 
  The Gaullist component of the ruling right-wing coalition, 
the Rally for the Republic (RPR), has campaigned for a 
resumption of testing, but RPR parliamentary leader Bernard Pons 
said Tuesday his government would vote for the bill. 
  Nuclear test campaigner Jacques Baumel, vice-chairman of the 
National Assembly's defence committee, would agree to withdraw 
an amendment calling for a resumption of tests in 1995 to 
acquire simulation capacity, Pons said. 
  He said an overwhelming majority of RPR MPs favoured a 
resumption of testing to develop a system of simulation, but 
that it would be up to the next president to decide. 
  Defence Minister Francois Leotard told parliament Tuesday 
that in 2000, France would have the second biggest defense 
budget in the West, after the United States, and "the biggest 
force on the European continent." 
  He said there would be nearly 580,000 soldiers and civilians 
serving in the armed forces.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Jacques Baumel Puts His Foot Down"] </F>
  [Text] In line with his credo, the Gaullist Jacques Baumel 
has decided to put his foot down. The RPR [Rally for the 
Republic] deputy chairman of the parliamentary defense committee 
on Saturday tabled an amendment to the bill for the military 
programming law for the period 1995-2000, stressing the need to 
resume nuclear testing. 
  During a televised interview on 10 May, Francois Mitterrand 
nonetheless said with regard to the resumption of nuclear 
testing: "Where such a serious issue is concerned, if Parliament 
or the government were to significantly disagree with me, I 
would ask the people to decide." The head of state did not 
specify whether this call to the people would come in the form 
of a referendum or if he would dissolve the National Assembly. 
  Jacques Baumel's amendment mentions the need for a 
"resumption of nuclear testing" to acquire the means of 
simulating tests. Before coming up for general debate, the 
amendment is to be examined this morning by the defense 
committee. The deputy explained: "I am trying to clear up the 
skillfully maintained confusion according to which a simulation 
device" such as the PALEN (Preparation of a Limitation of 
Nuclear Testing) system can be acquired "without testing." He 
recognized that no experiments could be carried out before the 
end of Francois Mitterrand's term of office. Jacques Baumel 
stressed that this delay "does not, however, mean that tests 
should not be planned for a later stage in order to preserve the 
future," and he reiterated that the planning law covered six 
years.

  [Text] Commenting on an Albanian Foreign Ministry statement 
that criticizes the Greek Government for Greek minority members' 
involvement in the Greek Secret Police and other 
unconstitutional activities as well as illegal possession of 
arms, Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said Greece is 
not willing to accept slanderous and unfounded allegations. 
Greece wants to improve Greek-Albanian relations, but that 
improvement depends on respect for the human rights of the Greek 
minority in Albania. 
  Venizelos stressed that if there is any evidence, it should 
have been presented either at the Zurich meeting between Foreign 
Ministers Karolos Papoulias and Alfred Serreqi or at the meeting 
of the Ministries of Public Order delegations in Ioannina. 
  The government appeared satisfied with the explanations made 
by the U.S. State Department, following the demarche lodge by 
Greek Ambassador in Washington Loukas Tsilas, regarding a 
statement by U.S. State Department Spokesman Michael McCurry. 
According to McCurry's statement, the U.S. Government has no 
credible evidence that it is the policy of the Albanian 
Government to suppress the Greek minority. The government 
spokesman said the Greek Government asked the State Department 
to make the explanation given to the Greek ambassador in the 
form of a public statement.

  [Text] PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] holds a firm 
lead among voters for the European Parliament election while 
support for the Political Spring [Spring] and Coalition of the 
Left and Progress [SIN] parties appears to have increased. 
  This conclusion is drawn from recent countrywide opinion 
polls conducted by MRB (on behalf of MEGA) and by ALKO (on 
behalf of ANTENNA). The results were released yesterday. 
  The MRB poll was conducted from 5 to 10 May and the ALKO 
poll 
from 9 to 17 May. 
  According to the polls the parties' percentages, excluding 
the undecided voters, are as follows:

following percentages: PASOK--34.9; ND--31.0; SPRING--5.0; 
SIN-- 4.4; KKE--4.3; Undecided--18.4. 
  According to the MRB poll, PASOK has retained 79 percent of 
voters in October's general election and lost 3.9 percent to 
SIN. Some 10.3 percent of those who voted for PASOK last October 
remain undecided. The ND has kept 84.1 percent of last 
October's voters and lost 5.3 percent of its voters to SPRING. 
Some 6.5 percent of those who voted for it last October remain 
undecided.

33.2. Their popularity has risen since the corresponding poll 
of June 1993. 
  The MRB poll also showed that 19.2 percent of all voters 
believe Konstandinos Simitis is the most suitable successor as 
PASOK's leader although 19.4 percent favor Akis Tsokhatzopoulos 
and 13.7 percent Simitis as the most probable. 
  On the popularity of political leaders based on diachronic 
evidence from March 1989 to May 1994, MRB gives the following

<F P=106> [Article by Yeoryios Pavleas, Sorbonne University professor </F>
of European Law: "Greece and the Commission"] 
  [Text] The preplanned referral of Greece to the European 
Court of Justice by the European Commission occurred in a 
climate of extraordinary tension against our country. The 
Commission's initiative is essentially not in keeping with 
procedural law based on Article 225, Paragraph 2 of the European 
Treaty, but should be seen as a political act aimed at 
pressuring our country. 
  Misusing the provisions of Articles 223, Paragraph 1B and 
225, Paragraph 2 of the [Rome] Treaty whose context is economic 
and devoid of political significance, the Commission acted 
against its identity as a keeper of legality in the 
implementation and interpretation of Community law, and 
simultaneously violated the fundamental principle of Community 
solidarity between the European Union (EU) member states. 
  The provisions of Article 223, Paragraph 1B, of the Treaty 
envision granting member states relative freedom to act 
unencumbered by the limitation of the competition rules of the 
Treaty when manufacturing or marketing war materiel, as long as 
this particular initiative is related to the defense of their 
security. 
  However, if one member state, overstepping the boundaries of 
such freedom under the pretext that it needs to defend its 
security, acts within the EU space against the competition rules 
and in a way that may hurt the interests of the other member 
states, the Commission, or another member state, has the right 
to resort to the European Court of Justice against the member 
state overstepping such boundaries. In fact, this is a very 
limited form of applying the above provisions. 
  In this specific instance, our country did not manufacture 
or 
market war materiel, neither did it hurt EU interests, since in 
principle it did not act within EU space and its initiative, 
moreover, was not economic, but eminently political. It should 
also be stressed that because of the minimal exchanges between 
the EU and Skopje, which represent only 0.50 percent of EU trade 
transactions on a yearly basis, the preconditions for the 
implementation of Articles 85, 169, and 170 of the Treaty do not 
exist. 
  The embargo imposed by the Greek Government on Skopje was 
its 
ultimate means of defense in the face of the increasing 
arrogance of the political leadership of that country, whose 
Constitution includes provisions of an irredentist nature 
betraying expansionary aims against our northern borders. In 
conjunction with Skopje's falsification of our history, the 
theft of the Veryina symbol and the name of Greek Macedonia, 
this undoubtedly and obviously created a major danger to the 
national security and territorial integrity of our country, as 
well as the risk of upsetting domestic peace and public order. 
  The Greek Government's decision was thus aimed at warding 
off 
these dangers and at safeguarding our country's historic 
heritage. 
  Consequently, our country does not belong in the "box of the 
accused." On the contrary, it should raise its voice in protest 
against the unjust and abusive behavior of an EU organ. It must 
be understood that the functioning of EU organs to threaten 
smaller member states using the "two-speed" approach--meaning 
the privileged treatment of our northern partners at the expense 
of the smaller southern partners--is contrary to the EU's 
fundamental proclamations. 
  Finally, the Commission's initiative is a serious blow to 
the 
principle of legality and Community solidarity. When viewed as a 
political act to pressure our country and favor the goals of a 
third country at the expense of our national security, it cannot 
be accepted by the European Court of Justice, because by its 
very nature it is condemned to rejection as inadmissible, 
excusatory, and altogether devoid of context and legal 
foundation.

  [Text] Paris, May 25 (AFP) -- President Francois Mitterrand 
on Wednesday [25 May] insisted he was opposed to any lifting of 
an arms embargo on ex-Yugoslavia, as pressure groups lobbied in 
France for an end to the ban voted by the UN Security Council. 
  Mitterrand, who spoke at a cabinet meeting, warned that 
allowing arms deliveries could trigger an escalation of the 
Bosnian conflict that could "go well beyond the Balkans," his 
spokesman Jean Musitelli said. 
  The French president, whose country Wednesday hosted peace 
talks by an international contact group and the belligerents in 
the Bosnian war, also said the "sole alternative to negotiation 
is war." 
  Mitterrand's own Socialist ally, Michel Rocard, who heads 
the 
French Socialist Party and the Socialist list for the June 12 
European elections, has publicly differed with the president, 
speaking out in favor of lifting the embargo. 
  A group of French intellectuals has also threatened to 
present their own list at the European elections if the 
mainstream lists do not call for allowing arms deliveries to 
Bosnian Moslem government troops. 
  Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic met with Rocard and 
other 
officials in Paris Monday to plead this cause. 
  Rocard, a presidential hopeful, Wednesday urged that 
"negotiations still be given a chance." But he said "elementary 
morality would imply that at least if we cannot protect the 
Bosnians, we let them protect themselves." 
  The talks with the international contact group on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina took place Wednesday in Talloires, a town in 
the French Alps just across the border from Geneva. 
  The meeting aimed to reach an agreement on the future 
carve-up of Bosnia-Herzegovina alongside a general four-month 
ceasefire, as a prelude to a permanent peace. 
  Earlier Wednesday, Defense Minister Francois Leotard 
confirmed that the French military contingent in former 
Yugoslavia would be dropped by 2,500 men by the end of the year. 
  France, which forms the backbone of the UN force in 
ex-Yugoslavia, now has 6,800 troops there. 
  By the end of 1994, "we are going to drop the volume of our 
forces in Bosnia and we are going to regroup them around 
Sarajevo," Leotard said on French radio. 
  France, and later Britain, have both warned they would pull 
their forces out of Bosnia if there is no breakthrough in the 
peace process. Britain has about 3,000 troops in former 
Yugoslavia.

  [Text] Geneva, May 26 (AFP) -- The next round of Bosnia 
peace talks between the republic's warring parties and the 
four-way international contact group will take place June 6 and 
7 in Talloires, southeast France, a diplomatic source said 
Thursday [26 May]. 
  Two days of talks on a ceasefire and a territorial division 
of Bosnia wound up in Talloires Thursday. The source close to 
the talks said they had made some progress. 
  "It was neither a failure nor a success, but we did not 
expect significant progress," the same source said. 
  In Talloires, a diplomat close to the talks said Thursday 
that the European, United Nations, U.S. and Russian negotiators 
were ready to try to impose a territorial solution on the 
warring parties, presumably by threatening to withdraw 
peacekeeping forces from Bosnia if the new territorial plan was 
rejected. 
  But a Croat press source earlier the Moslems and Bosnian 
Croats were ready to negotiate on the basis of the European 
Union territorial division plan, earmarking 51 percent of the 
republic for the new Moslem-Croat federation and 49 percent for 
the Bosnian Serb side.

  [Text] Paris, May 26 (AFP) -- British Foreign Secretary 
Douglas Hurd said Thursday [26 May] that Britain could not 
maintain a military presence in Bosnia forever, but declined to 
say whether London would call for an early pull-out if peace 
talks fail to make progress. 
  "It can't be an everlasting presence. It has justified 
itself up to now. We believe it will continue to justify 
itself, but we certainly have no desire to keep British troops 
indefinitely in Bosnia," he said. 
  He was responding to questions on whether Britain would 
withdraw its forces, serving under the United Nations, if peace 
talks failed to make progress. 
  Hurd had earlier held 45 minutes of talks with French Prime 
Minister Edouard Balladur on the sidelines of a two-day, 
53-delegation conference on European stability here. 
  Hurd, who also met Thursday with French counterpart Alain 
Juppe and Defence Minister Francois Leotard, said however that 
no date had been agreed by France and Britain for the withdrawal 
of their peacekeeping forces in Bosnia. 
  France has warned it would pull out half its forces by the 
end of the year if no progress in peace talks is made. 
  "We have not been so precise about dates, but we are on the 
same line, in our main objective which is to bring about a 
negotiated peace," Hurd said. 
  Other questions broached with the French involved Russia and 
the European Union, he said. 
  Speaking of the search for a successor to Jacques Delors as 
president of the European Commission, Hurd said former British 
conservative minister and current EU Trade Commissioner Sir Leon 
Brittan was the best candidate. 
  The question was touched on during talks with Balladur, he 
said.

  [Text] Brussels, May 26 (AFP) -- Russia has set no 
preconditions for joining NATO's Partnership for Peace (PFP) 
programme but wants the Alliance to respond to a series of 
proposals for cooperation before signing up, Defence Minister 
Pavel Grachev said Thursday [26 May]. 
  He presented the proposals, notably on creating a mechanism 
for consultation on security issues worldwide, and on increased 
military and political cooperation, to the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organisation Wednesday. 
  The statement, a copy of which was received by AFP Thursday, 
was headlined the "practical participation" of Russia in the 
Alliance programme. 
  It stated: "One of the goals of the partnership should be 
the formation of a collective security and stability system in 
Europe." 
  It also also cited as an issue of "special importance" 
possible cooperation over Russian-led peacekeeping operations in 
the former Soviet Union. 
  A well-placed NATO source said Wednesday that Grachev had 
proposed levels of participation proportional to Moscow's 
military weight, indicating an enthusiasm exceeding all 
expectations. 
  "We thought (Russia) was only prepared to dabble its toe in 
the PFP, but Grachev indicated it was ready to dive in," the 
NATO source said. 
  But Grachev also called for a formal system of consultations 
between Moscow and NATO on European and world security. 
  He reiterated Russia's wish for regular and automatic 
meetings with NATO at all political and military levels, 
something the Alliance has thus far resisted. 
  "NATO is not ready or willing to give any droit de regard 
(right to influence) or even worse a veto over its activities," 
NATO Deputy Secretary General Sergio Balanzino told a press 
conference Wednesday. 
  The Russian text added that the Partnership should help 
coordinate activities of NATO and other structures, notably the 
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) and the 
North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC), the document said. 
  The CSCE comprises all European countries plus the United 
States and Canada, while the NACC is the NATO body responsible 
for consultation with former Warsaw Pact countries. 
  "In principle, the CSCE and the NACC should seek to 
coordinate the efforts of NATO," and other bodies including the 
European Union and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), 
the text said. 
  Political partnership would operate via consultations on 
European and world security issues which would function "both on 
a regular and emergency basis," it stated. 
  Balanzino, the chairman of Wednesday's meeting, suggested 
that NATO was willing to accept the evolution of a "constructive 
and substantial dialogue" if Russia embraced the military 
partnership. 
  But NATO rejected a treaty formalising bilateral relations 
with Russia, although it did not rule out a less formal 
declaration when Moscow signs the PFP.

  [Text] Brussels, May 25 (AA) -- Defense Minister Mehmet 
Golhan, currently in Brussels for the NATO defense ministers 
meetings, on Tuesday [24 May] said that it should be made clear 
that Russia's policy toward the former Soviet republics is not 
approved of. 
  Stressing that developments in Russia should be carefully 
evaluated, he said that although the Soviet Union has 
disintegrated and the Warsaw Pact split up, the Russian 
Federation has not lost its importance in the view of security. 
  "The alliance should think of more practical ways to bring 
up 
responsible ties with this country," Golhan said. 
  Golhan also stressed the importance of inciting the Central 
Asian republics to join a Partnership for Peace agreement set up 
by NATO and former East-bloc countries, saying the joining of 
Russia to this agreement is a satisfactory development. 
  Defense ministers from allied countries on Tuesday welcomed 
a 
statement by Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev that Russia 
would sign up for Partnership for Peace without setting special 
conditions. 
  Golhan also said that Turkey has close historic and cultural 
ties with Balkan countries, stressing the importance it gives to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina's sovereignty, independence and territorial 
integrity. 
  He expressed Turkey's concern over a potential risk which 
results from the spreading of weapons of mass destruction, such 
as biological and chemical weapons, in its neighboring regions. 
  Golhan also said that during the NATO meetings all kinds of 
international terrorism activities were condemned and called for 
an effective antiterrorism fight which constitutes a threat to 
international relations.

  [Text] Brussels, May 26 (AFP) -- NATO Thursday [26 May] 
officially denied that Secretary General Manfred Woerner, who 
missed two North Atlantic Treaty Organisation meetings earlier 
this week through illness, was to resign his post. 
  A spokesman told reporters "the secretary general has not 
resigned and has no intention of resigning." 
  Woerner, 59, whose mandate runs out in 1996, has been 
operated on for stomach cancer three times since April 1992, and 
in early January he said he had beaten the illness. 
  However, on January 14 he was operated on for a severe 
intestinal blockage and in early May he postponed indefinitely a 
visit to the United States. 
  At the start of the week, Woerner wrote to NATO defence 
ministers explaining he would not be able to chair meetings 
Tuesday and Wednesday, for medical reasons. 
  "It was my firm intention to leave the hospital in time to 
chair the meetings. Even my doctors were hopeful that this 
would be possible. 
  "However they now advise me that the previous untimely 
interruptions of my convalescence had taken their toll and that 
another premature return might well damage the chances of a full 
recovery," he said in a letter, published by NATO Thursday. 
  However, while Woerner's post is not due to come up for 
another two years, a senior European Commission official 
suggested that the question of a possible successor to Woerner 
could be linked to the other international posts coming up in 
Europe in the next couple of years. 
  "Without being morbid, one can imagine an agreement on a 
global package including Woerner's post, the president of the 
European Commission, the secretary general of the Western 
European Union and the secretary general of the European Union's 
Council of Ministers," the official said, requesting anonymity.

<F P=106> [By Geoffrey Varley] </F>
  [Text] Paris, May 26 (AFP) -- Europe tried to lay to rest 
the ghosts of wars past on Thursday [26 May] with a Stability 
Pact intended to settle potential border disputes and solve the 
problem of minorities in central and eastern Europe. 
  But the conference on stability in Europe, brainchild of 
French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, left aside the wars in 
Bosnia and the Caucasus, concentrating on preventing conflicts 
that could regenerate from Europe's turbulent past. 
  And Europe's future relationship with Russia, which will not 
be part of the pact, appeared ill-defined as the two-day 
conference opened at UNESCO headquarters here. 
  In an opening speech, Balladur said "we must begin by 
liquidating the old quarrels, resolving the old conflicts, 
dissipating the old fears, we must stabilise our continent as 
far as borders and minority rights are concerned." 
  The prime minister said the conference's objective should be 
to sign the Stability Pact by early next year, perhaps in 
February "but perhaps it will take longer." 
  A successful outcome would help Balladur in French 
presidential elections due in May, 1995, analysts said, but the 
Stability Pact project is less ambitious than when the prime 
minister launched it a year ago. 
  It is now limited to preventing potential conflict. The war 
in Bosnia, said Balladur, "is a veritable lesson of what we must 
no longer tolerate." 
  The pact would incorporate existing good-neighbour 
agreements, such as recognition of the Oder-Neisse frontier 
between Germany and Poland, and new accords to be reached in the 
interval, Balladur said. 
  The aim of the pact was to reconcile the desire of "numerous 
countries to join the European Union with the need to preserve 
the unity of our continent and thus develop very close relations 
with Russia," the prime minister said. 
  He added that the "greater Europe of the future" should 
enjoy 
"privileged relations of partnership" with Moscow. 
  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev welcomed the 
proposed 
pact, but struck a note of caution, saying that Moscow preferred 
that border disputes and minority issues be addressed by the 
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). 
  He hailed the pact as "yet another attempt to come to grips 
seriously with the extremely dangerous signs of aggressive 
nationalism, xenophobia and ethnic and religious intolerance" in 
Europe. 
  But he added, "discussion of issues related to state borders 
as well as to national minorities should take place exclusively 
in the framework established by CSCE documents." 
  Balladur also said Thursday the future pact would be closely 
linked with the CSCE. 
  The United States is represented at the conference by 
Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Peter Tarnoff. 
  The conference is chaired by Greece in its capacity as 
current president of the EU after the union adopted Balladur's 
initiative. 
  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said this week that the 
summit aimed to settle border and minority problems between 
"countries with the vocation of entering the EU," following the 
collapse of the Soviet bloc. 
  They are six central and eastern European countries -- 
Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria and 
Romania -- and the three Baltic countries - Latvia, Lithuania 
and Estonia. Only one country that emerged from former 
Yugoslavia - Slovenia - has been invited. 
  French European Affairs Minister Alain Lamassoure said the 
EU, while prepared to accept new members, was unwilling to take 
on board "new sources of conflict." The aim was to "provide a 
political impetus" to handle good-neighbour problems "better and 
quicker," Juppe said. 
  On the agenda are the big Hungarian minorities in Romania 
(1.6 million) and Slovakia (600,000). 
  Budapest is anxious to protect their rights to autonomy, 
notably in the cultural field, while the Romanian and Slovakian 
governments are seeking Hungarian acceptance of the 
inviolability of existing frontiers. 
  The conference will also attempt to deal with the problem of 
Russian minorities in the three Baltic countries and the 
withdrawal of Russian troops. 
  The four candidate members of the EU -- Finland, Norway, 
Sweden and Austria -- are attending the Paris conference, along 
with the three neighbours of the central European Visegrad group 
-- Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine. 
  Apart from Russia and the United States, eight other states 
with a direct interest in European stability are also taking 
part -- Albania, Canada, Cyprus, Iceland, Malta, Switzerland, 
Turkey and the Vatican.

  [Text] Paris, May 27 (AFP) -- A conference to promote 
stability in Europe agreed Friday [27 May] on measures aimed at 
preventing border conflicts in eastern Europe and solving 
problems over ethnic minorities. 
  The two-day conference, which opened at UNESCO headquarters 
here on Thursday, agreed to set up two regional round tables, 
one dealing with the problems of Russian minorities in the three 
Baltic states, and the other with Hungarian minorities in 
Slovakia and Romania. 
  Accords reached at the round tables will be enshrined in a 
Stability Pact which could be signed early in 1995 and 
registered with the Conference on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe (CSCE). 
  The conference is sponsored by France and the European Union 
to defuse potential conflicts between would-be candidates to the 
European Union from eastern and central Europe.

  [Text] Paris, May 26 (AA) -- Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin 
said on Thursday [26 May] that the initiatives taken toward 
Europe's security and stability were very appropriate. 
  Speaking during European Stability Conference, Cetin 
revealed 
Turkey's views. 
  Cetin said the violence and ethnic cleaning in Bosnia has 
not 
been responded to adding that the bloodshed in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina has not ended yet. 
  Cetin said Europe is passing through a hard transition 
period. 
  `The problems created after the collapse of iron curtain 
need 
attention,' Cetin said. 
  He said the incidents happening in Bosnia today create 
dangerous examples for future `extreme nationalism, religious 
and cultural intolerance and racism which could arise again in 
various places in Europe.' 
  During his speech Cetin stressed good-neighborly relations 
and the importance of regional cooperation. 
  He said Turkey is ready to contribute to regional 
cooperation 
programs within the framework of European Stability Agreement. 
  Turkey is an associate member of European Union and aims at 
full membership.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has declared that a 
new Europe emerged with the termination of the era of separate 
blocs and it is beneficial to seek solutions for the conflicts 
in Central and Eastern European and (?Baltic) countries. Cetin 
is currently in Paris for the European Stability Pact 
conference, which aims to prevent the ethnic problems in Eastern 
European countries from causing new clashes similar to those in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Cetin replied to reporters' questions. 
  The foreign minister stated that the conference is seeking a 
kind of diplomacy that will avoid conflicts. He said that 
minority and border issues were discussed at first. Stressing 
that disputes must be resolved between neighbors, Cetin remarked 
that countries which will join the European Union [EU] must 
first solve their problems with their neighbors. Greece is such 
an example, Cetin noted, adding: It was admitted into the EU 
without resolving its problems with Turkey and these problems 
are now causing trouble for the EU. 
  Recalling that Turkey solved its problems with Bulgaria in a 
friendly manner, Cetin declared that the clashes in the Caucasus 
constitute a great loss both for the Azerbaijanis and the 
Armenians. 
  The foreign minister, who held meetings with his Russian, 
German, and British counterparts in Paris, also met with French 
Foreign Minister Alain Juppe.

  [Text] Cyprus wants to contribute as much as possible to 
improving security and stability in Europe and looks forward to 
a further strengthening of its relations with Europe, and 
particularly with the European Union. 
  This was stressed today by Foreign Minister Alekos 
Mikhailidhis during his speech at a conference on stability in 
Europe that is being held in Paris. 
  Referring to the Cyprus issue, the foreign minister stressed 
that for 20 years Cyprus has lived the tragic results of the 
lack of strong mechanisms to prevent expansionism and punish 
violations of international law. He also said that Cyprus is an 
example of a violation of borders and incitement of minority 
problems to facilitate expansionist designs.

  [Excerpt] Portuguese Foreign Minister Durao Barroso says 
there is no peace in Angola for the present, because the 
Angolans themselves are blocking the process. The foreign 
minister also says that he is pessimistic about the future of 
negotiations between UNITA [National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola] and the Luanda government: 
  [Begin Barroso recording] There was an extraordinary 
international investment in Angola; however, if the Angolans 
themselves or part of them want to continue the war, we cannot 
avoid it. We continue searching for a solution and continue 
encouraging both sides to make an effort and be more flexible. 
While there was somewhat more optimistic news in the past few 
days, we continue to be rather pessimistic about a global, 
definite solution being found for the Angolan problem. [end

  [Text] Brussels, May 25 (AFP) -- The European Union [EU] 
released ECU1 million (1.5 million dollars) for emergency aid to 
victims of Rwanda's bloodbath on Wednesday [25 May], the EU 
announced in a statement. 
  The funds went to the International Committee of the Red 
Cross (ICRC) to enable it to pursue its medical and sanitation 
activities in the capital Kigali and in the towns of Butare and 
Kibungu in the south and southeast. 
  Two Rwandan Red Cross workers were killed and five others 
badly wounded on Wednesday in Kigali when a shell landed on 
their compound in the city as rebels fought fierce artillery 
battles with the army. 
  But the ICRC said it had no plans to cut down on its staff 
or 
activities there. 
  Wednesday's contribution brings to ECU2.63 million the total 
amount of humanitarian aid given to Rwandans since the start of 
the latest ethnic clashes at the beginning of April. 
  By some estimates, the wholesale slaughter has claimed half 
a 
million lives in the Central African nation, while another 
500,000 have fled abroad and many others are displaced inside 
the country.

  [Text] Brussels, May 25 (AFP) -- The European Union [EU] 
Wednesday [25 May] issued a statement expressing full support 
for the territorial integrity of Ukraine, five days after the 
Crimean parliament adopted a separatist constitution. 
  In the statement, the EU "expresses its grave concern at the 
recent developments in the Crimean region of Ukraine." 
  "Noting that the situation has deteriorated over the past 
week and taking into consideration the decision of the Crimean 
parliament of May 20, it urges the continuation of efforts to 
find negotiated and legitimate solutions to the issue, without 
resort to confrontation or unilateral actions," the statement 
said. 
  "The EU reiterates that an escalation of the conflict would 
have severe consequences for the stability in East Europe," it 
added.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Van den Broek Wants European Union </F>
Security Council"] 
  [Text] EU Commissioner Van den Broek yesterday [24 May] 
called for the formation of a "permanent top level European 
Union (EU) Security Council". 
  The commissioner for external political relations said "this 
Security Council should supply planning and analysis at an EU 
level. This would then form the basis for the decisions taken by 
ministers in foreign and security policy fields." "The Council 
should supply means to deal with crisis situations which 
threaten the EU," Van den Broek said. 
  Van den Broek made his proposal at a seminar about the 
future 
of the EU's joint foreign and security policies. The seminar 
was organized by the Clingendael Netherlands Institute for 
International Relations. 
  "An adequate planning and analysis mechanism is," Van den 
Broek stressed, "a requirement for foreign policies which not 
only react, but also anticipate." The absence of such a 
mechanism is in his view one of the causes of the EU policies' 
failure in the former Yugoslavia. Another cause is too many 
"declarations which promise more than can be realized," the 
commissioner said. 
  Van den Broek also proposed a more effective working method 
for the so-called "troika." At present, the "troika" comprises 
the foreign ministers of the past, present, and future 
presidencies of the Council of Ministers. 
  The commissioner said that "the troika can become more 
effective if it comprises the ministers of a large and a small 
EU country and a representative of the European Commission." 
"Such a set-up can be achieved by a change in the 
classification of the EU member states," according to Van den 
Broek.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Elimination of Border Checks Strikes </F>
Fear"] 
  [Text] In Germany, Belgium, France, and the Netherlands the 
elimination of border checks at Europe's internal borders is 
anticipated with some concern. More than half of the people in 
those countries (57 percent) fear an "increase in crime in their 
country." Netherlanders and inhabitants of the former East 
Germany are most fearful, registering 66 and 67 percent, 
respectively. 
  This is the conclusion of an international survey whose 
results were presented Tuesday [24 May] in the German city of 
Gronau. The survey was commissioned by the Netherlands Police 
Academy (NPA) and the German Police Academy (PFA). 
  The same survey also showed that there is widespread support 
in the four countries for international police cooperation in 
the European Union. One striking fact is that Netherlanders in 
particular are fervent supporters of more in-depth cooperation. 
  In addition, no less than 97 percent of Netherlanders want 
information on criminals to be exchanged between international 
police bodies. The average in the four countries is 2 percent 
lower. 
  The Netherlands also favors a joint police structure, such 
as 
Europol: With 96 percent in favor, compared to an average of 92 
percent in the four countries involved in the survey. 
  A total of 80 percent of the respondents felt the police 
should be able to chase and arrest suspects across internal 
borders. That percentage puts the Netherlands squarely in the 
middle.

  [Text] Brussels, May 25 (AFP) -- A high-level European 
Union [EU] team will travel to Algiers on May 30 to call for 
respect for human rights and urge "national dialogue" between 
the government and Islamic fundamentalists, a Belgian Foreign 
Ministry spokesman said Wednesday [25 May]. 
  Greek Deputy Foreign Minister George Papandreou, whose 
country currently chairs the 12-member EU, Belgian Foreign 
Minister Willy Claes, the former chairman and a senior German 
official, representing the next country to chair the 
organisation, were mandated to make the trip by the EU at a 
meeting earlier this month. 
  The representatives will convey a "clear message calling for 
respect for human rights" addressed to all factions in the 
country, the Belgian spokesman said. 
  The EU will also express its satisfaction with a recent 
agreement concluded by Algeria and the International Monetary 
Fund on economic reforms. 
  The EU recently released a second 150 million ECUs (172 
million dollars) of an aid programme frozen since 1991.

Mock had to undergo hospital treatment yesterday. The official 
reason is a herniation of a vertebral disk. He is in an 
Innsbruck hospital. One of his closest aides told ORF

crimes was arrested in Salzburg last Friday [21 May] and taken 
into custody the following day pending trial. Dusko Cvjetkovic, 
26, is said to have directed a "paramilitary operation" as the 
leader of a unit of Bosnian Serbs in the Bosnian village of 
Kucice on 14 July 1992, a spokesman for the Salzburg Provincial

genocide, murder, and arson are being made against Cvjetkovic. 
If these accusations are confirmed in the further

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Ter Beek Wants Money From NATO for </F>
Peacekeeping Duties"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 25 May -- The Netherlands wants financial 
compensation from the other NATO member states for its 
contribution to the peacekeeping operations in Bosnia. The 
countries which are providing soldiers are currently shouldering 
too much of the financial cost of these expensive operations. 
The burden should be divided more fairly. 
  Netherlands Defense Minister Ter Beek made this demand 
yesterday [24 May] in Brussels at the NATO defense ministers' 
meeting. Ter Beek specifically referred to the use of 
Netherlands aircraft to impose the no-fly ban over Bosnia. This 
NATO operation organized under UN auspices, called "Deny 
Flight," involves the United States, the United Kingdom, and 
France, in addition to the Netherlands. These four countries are 
paying the full cost of the operation, between 75 and 80 million 
guilders a year for the Netherlands. 
  The participation of Netherlands soldiers in UN peacekeeping 
missions is paid for by the Development Cooperation Ministry. 
The Netherlands has previously agreed to pay 1.5 percent of the 
cost of all UN operations. 
  But the cost of providing troops and material for NATO 
operations is not divided among all the alliance's member 
states. The presence of forces including a liaison battalion 
and a transport battalion, and the deployment of the Air Force 
(from the northern Italian town of Villafranca to enforce the 
no-fly ban) and the Navy (from the Adriatic Sea) are costing the 
Defense Ministry nearly 140 million guilders in net extra costs. 
Ter Beek has already asked the cabinet for compensation and it 
is possible that this will be provided for in the coming budget. 
  In Brussels, Ter Beek let it be known yesterday that 
"financial solidarity" had to apply within NATO. "The 
Netherlands can not continue writing out blank cheques for 
years. The political signal has been given and now we just have 
to wait to see how it works out," it has been said in 
Netherlands circles.

  [Text] Here in the Netherlands, Justice Minister Ernst 
Hirsch Ballin has resigned. 
  His decision followed a motion of no-confidence in the 
Christian Democrat minister by the parliament in the Hague. 
Yesterday a majority of the lower house ordered the justice 
minister and Interior Minister Ed van Thijn to refrain from any 
further involvement in combatting organized crime. Parliament 
decided that the two ministers had made too many mistakes in 
that area. 
  Both the motion of no-confidence and the minister's 
resignation are unusual, since the entire cabinet has been 
outgoing since the elections of 3 May. It's not known whether 
Minister van Thijn will also resign.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Slight Rise In Foreign Trade In </F>
1993"] 
  [Text] Netherlands foreign trade seems to have increased 
slightly compared to 1992. Last year's imports were worth 235 
billion guilders and exports 258 billion guilders. In 1992, 
these figures were 236 billion and 247 billion guilders 
respectively. 
  The CBS [Central Bureau of Statistics] points out, however, 
that a comparison between the two years is difficult because 
since 1 January 1993 companies which import from or export to 
countries in the European Union [EU] no longer have to submit 
customs documents. 
  Instead, companies are now legally obliged to submit details 
of their trading activities directly to the CBS. Dutch exports 
to EU countries exceeded imports in 1993. While exports 
amounted to 191 billion guilders, imports were 144 billion 
guilders. 
  Outside the EU the balance was reversed. Exports to non-EU 
countries amounted to 67 billion guilders, compared to imports 
of 91 billion guilders. There was no change in the country's 
top three trading partners. Germany and Belgium were, as usual, 
firmly established in the top two places. For exports, France 
ranked third and for imports the United Kingdom ranked third. 
  Major increases were recorded last year in exports to China, 
Indonesia and Brazil. Ireland and China accounted for an 
increased share of imports.

  [Text] National Defense Minister Mehmet Golhan has 
declared that in addition to the civilian sectors, the National 
Defense Ministry and the Chief of the General Staff's Office are 
seriously applying measures to curb expenditures. Golhan 
returned to Turkey after attending the NATO Defense Planning 
Committee and the Nuclear Planning Group spring meetings held in 
Brussels. 
  In a statement at Ankara's Esenboga Airport, Golhan reported 
that, just like Turkey, almost all countries in the world are 
experiencing economic difficulties this year and consequently 
defense budgets are being cut. Golhan remarked that after 
improving its economy, Turkey can easily purchase the weapons 
and equipment it needs without grants or military aid. 
  Commenting on the Defense Planning Committee meetings, 
Golhan 
explained that the agreements reached regarding the 
implementation of the decisions adopted during the NATO summit 
last January as well as the situation in the former Yugoslavia 
were reviewed and the NATO force goals for 1994 were approved. 
The work to be done to prevent the proliferation of mass 
destruction weapons was also assessed, Golhan reported. 
  [Begin Golhan recording] The subject was extremely important 
for Turkey, because there are countries in our geographic region 
that want to buy these mass destruction weapons and even wish to 
possess the means to launch them. Therefore, this matter is 
being pursued with sensitivity. 
  In my speech, I mentioned these issues and declared that we 
will always make constructive contributions to the work on the 
subject. [end recording] 
  The defense minister remarked that the Nuclear Planning 
Group 
meeting focused on controlling the nuclear weapons in the world 
and removing their warheads.

civilians from eastern and southeastern Anatolia to northern 
Iraq is another tactic of the separatist terrorist organization 
PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan]. 
  Speaking at parliament's general council Mentese refused the

northern Iraq. 
  `The PKK called these people there to provide international 
support and to make propaganda but still Turkey calls these 
people back,' Mentese said. 
  He said the PKK initiated all the incidents in eastern and 
southeastern Anatolia and massacred children, women and old 
people there.

<F P=106> ["Daily" column by Yalcin Dogan: "Democratization Scandal!"] </F>
  [Excerpt] The southeast and consequently the "Kurdish 
package" has been excluded from the democratization package that 
was announced yesterday. About 20 days ago, the Social 
Democratic Populist Party [SDPP] submitted a draft to the True 
Path Party [TPP]. This draft included some rights "which were 
supposed to be granted to the Kurds." The package announced 
yesterday, however, does not incorporate these. 
  The SDPP first drafted a proposal for the democratization 
package, to which it attaches great importance and to which it 
links its very existence in the government. This draft was then 
discussed at a meeting attended by Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, 
SDPP leader Murat Karayalcin, as well as certain TPP and SDPP 
deputies. During the meeting, Ciller described the proposal as 
"very good, very appropriate" and the SDPP members were 
ecstatic. Yesterday, however, those same ecstatic SDPP members 
were very reticent. 
  What does this draft, which was reportedly "agreed upon" and 
which was suspended yesterday, actually contain? These are the 
details: 
  In the draft, the SDPP says: "The legal and de facto 
obstacles that emerge during the expression of a cultural 
identity will be eliminated." What are these obstacles? The 
draft proposes "the introduction of Kurdish education, Kurdish 
radio and television broadcasting, the elimination of the 
difficulties encountered when people use their Kurdish names, 
and the obstacles in establishing foundations." There are still 
actual obstacles in presenting names and establishing 
foundations. Moreover, the draft includes the practical 
suggestion "to begin Kurdish television broadcasting with GAP 
[Southeast Anatolia Project] TV." 
  The draft, which was approved by Ciller 20 days ago, 
provoked 
the reaction of TPP members last week and was subsequently 
rejected. 
  What does this leave us with? We are left with amendments to 
certain articles of the Constitution and various arrangements 
which are not really related to democratization, such as 
lowering the age to vote and be elected, making it easier for 
deputies to switch parties, and controlling the annulment of 
laws. 
  This is an insipid package, which does not need to be called 
a democratization package. For example, it does not grant the 
right to strike and conduct collective wage negotiations to 
civil servant unions and continues to prevent university 
teachers from joining a political party. It is merely a bunch 
of decisions necessitated by current conditions. Therefore, let 
no one attempt to publicize it as a "democratization package." 
  On the contrary, as stated in yesterday's news conference, 
"the new provincial administration law will spread the state of 
emergency conditions not only to the southeast, but to the 
entire country." This is not what we say. During yesterday's 
news conference, Ciller said the following in answer to a 
question: 
  "The provincial private administration law must be enacted 
before we can lift the state of emergency." Here, too, she 
confuses the provincial private administration and the 
provincial administration law. But, this is another matter. 
Nonetheless, the so-called democratization package acquires a 
"scandalous" nature because of the prime minister's own 
statement. Ciller links the lifting of the state of emergency 
to the enactment of the provincial administration law. In the 
text she read earlier, however, she describes the "provincial 
administration law as part of democratization." 
  In fact, the provincial administration law is the 
alternative 
to the state of emergency. Then, what is it doing in the 
democratization package? Alternatively, since when has the 
state of emergency been a part of democratization? 
  This draft law, which has been overlooked, in fact "spreads 
the state of emergency to the entire country." So much so that 
"the district official is the only ruler in the district and the 
governor is the only ruler in the province." [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Istanbul News Service--Businessman Vehbi Koc, 
citing the foreign and domestic dangers facing Turkey today, 
said, "Our country is today entering a heretofore unprecedented 
economic crisis." Discounting the need to ascribe blame for the 
present difficulty to any particular group or groups, Koc 
stressed that the effects of the "economic measures plan" 
recently announced by the Tansu Ciller government should be 
realized by the middle of 1996. Koc said, "If everyone carries 
his share of the burden in a spirit of unity and solidarity, I 
am confident that the Turkish nation will overcome this problem." 
  Koc, in a written three-page statement, issued a call for 
unity and solidarity to enable Turkey to overcome the economic 
and political crisis it finds itself in today. The 70-year-old 
Koc pointed out that he has experienced everything from the 
National Salvation Struggle under Ataturk's leadership to the 
Inonu, Bayar, and Menderes eras that culminated in single party 
regimes with military and coalition governments. Koc cited these 
as examples of hard times that Turkey had to endure. Pointing 
out that Turkey is entering another period of hard times, Koc 
said, "There is widespread devastation from the terrorism in the 
southeast. There are economic problems waiting to be solved. Our 
country is facing foreign and domestic dangers. We have been in 
economic and political turmoil for the past 10 years, but on 
similar occasions in the past we have surmounted the 
difficulties. This time, however, we have entered a heretofore 
unprecedented economic crisis." 
  Koc continued his statement by saying, "In order to resolve 
this situation, the Ciller government announced on 5 April that 
it had prepared an `economic measures plan.' This is a good 
plan, but the results will be realized gradually over a two-year 
period, provided that the plan can be put into effect 
immediately. Public opinion has not yet reached a consensus on 
how we should overcome the present crisis. There is no point in 
assigning blame for this crisis. The Ciller plan may have some 
shortcomings--the details have to be worked out--but our 
president, prime minister, party leaders, and assembly members 
must support and adopt it. The press and television must also 
contribute to this effort by pointing the public in the right 
direction. It would also be beneficial, after soliciting the 
views of the labor unions, the Turkish Union of Chambers and 
Commodity Exchanges [TOBB], and the Turkish Industrialists and 
Businessmen's Association [TUSIAD] to make the requisite foreign 
contacts in order to regain our country's prestige abroad. For 
example, what steps will be taken with regard to tax reform, 
budget reductions, state enterprise [KIT] privatization and/or 
closure, and minimization of the state's share of the economy? 
These questions require input and support from the party 
leaders. There is no possibility of success if the whole country 
is going to be taxed while the government continues to waste 
money on unprofitable state enterprises. If taxes are used to 
make up the deficits of these state enterprises, you can forget 
any possibility of success. If the plan is to be successful, the 
burdens must be borne and shared equally. There must be no 
turning back after implementation begins. If the implementation 
is equitable and all sectors are consulted, and if everyone pays 
his taxes, I am convinced that free market forces will ensure 
the success of the plan and no further sacrifices will be 
necessary. The Turkish nation is a great nation. Any sacrifice 
is justified if you believe it is for the good of the nation. If 
each one of us does his duty in a spirit of unity and 
solidarity, the Turkish nation will overcome the present 
difficulty."

  [Excerpt] Ankara (DUNYA)--The financial cost of the 
Economic Stabilization Program announced on 5 April will be 
300.7 trillion Turkish lira [TL]. This was announced yesterday 
by Social Democratic Populist Party [SHP] leader Murat 
Karayalcin during an Assembly group meeting in Ankara. 
  According to Karayalcin, the TL330.7 trillion will be 
derived 
as follows: TL70 trillion from tax reforms, TL204 trillion from 
increases, and TL58.1 trillion from other reforms. By "other 
reforms," Karayalcin stated he means the elimination of the 
nonproductive work sector, collection of back taxes, and 
avoidance of penalties. Karayalcin described the distribution of 
the total cost to the public sectors as follows: a) Wage and 
salaried sector (7.2 million people) 27.5 percent (TL91.1 
trillion), b) Agricultural sector (8.5 million people) 14.2 
percent (TL47.1 trillion), c) capital sector (8 million people) 
58.2 percent (TL192.5 trillion). 
  The breakdown of the wage and salaried sector cost is: a) 
TL16.6 trillion from tax reforms, b) TL54.9 trillion from 
increases, c) TL19.6 trillion from other reforms. The breakdown 
of the agricultural sector cost is: a) TL3.1 trillion from 
taxes, b) TL38.9 trillion from increases, c) TL7.1 trillion from 
other reforms. The breakdown of the capital sector is: a) TL90.3 
trillion from taxes, b) TL112.8 trillion from increases, (c) 
TL29.4 trillion from other reforms. 
  Karayalcin noted the following concerning the Council of 
Ministers' new TL70 trillion tax reform package issued the 
previous day: a) additional tax revenues TL13.9 trillion, b) 
additional enterprise taxes TL10.1 trillion, c) net tax credits 
TL29-30 trillion. Karayalcin said that the Council of Ministers 
had adopted the principle of deriving taxes not just from 
transportation, real estate, and other taxables, but also from 
transfers, whichever was higher. He described the distribution 
of the burden among the various sectors as unequal, but he said 
that the inequality was targeted not at any participating sector 
but at capital in general. Karayalcin thanked Motherland Party 
leader Mesut Yilmaz and Democratic Left Party leader Bulent 
Ecevit for supporting the Stabilization Program, and he asked 
for the support of his own Assembly group in order to get the 
tax reform package through the Turkish Grand National Assembly 
[TBMM]. He also stressed the need for quick approval of the 
Radio and Television bill currently on the Assembly's agenda. 
  Karayalcin further stated that the state enterprise closings 
will only take effect at the end of the year. Since there is no 
decision on firing workers, it is possible that only those who 
work at nonprofitable enterprises will lose their jobs. 
Karayalcin stressed that the government's first priority is to 
find ways to return these enterprises to profitability. Noting 
that at Zonguldak those working above the ground outnumber those 
working in the mines, Karayalcin said that efforts are being 
expedited to create new jobs for 21,000 people in the region.

<F P=106> [Article by George Jones and Richard Savill: "Major Gives </F>
Sinn Fein Two-Week Deadline"] 
  [Text] Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish 
Prime Minister, last night told Sinn Fein that they were not 
"waiting around" for a response to the Downing Street 
declaration. The warning followed the first public signs of 
dissension within the republican movement over the peace process. 
  After 90 minutes of talks at No 10, the leaders appealed for 
an end to sectarian killings by the IRA and loyalist 
paramilitaries. They said Sinn Fein could have a "couple more 
weeks" to debate its response, provided there was a cessation of 
violence. 
  But they stressed the two Governments would not delay their 
own efforts to draw up a framework for political progress in 
Northern Ireland which is likely to be considered at an 
Anglo-Irish summit in London in July. 
  Mr Reynolds said: "We are not waiting around for any more 
prevarication on either side to stop the violence. We continue 
with our own business." 
  Earlier, Mr Gerry Adams, President of Sinn Fein, had 
promised 
a response to the Downing Street clarification after the 
European elections on June 9, raising hopes that progress was 
being made towards a settlement. 
  "I am quite convinced that what is going to come out of this 
process is a peace settlement," Mr Adams told BBC Radio 4's 
Today programme. 
  But the first signs of a potential rift within Sinn Fein 
emerged yesterday when the IRISH TIMES quoted a senior 
republican source in west Belfast as saying there was no 
possibility of Sinn Fein accepting the declaration, nor of the 
IRA calling a permanent cease-fire on the basis of the 
clarification provided by the Government. 
  Mr Richard McAuley, Sinn Fein's senior press officer, later 
acknowledged that some republicans were saying things that were 
harmful and "clearly at odds with the leadership". But he 
dismissed suggestions of a split: "We are only talking about a 
small number who do not represent the views of thousands of 
members of the party." 
  However, his comments were seen as an acknowledgement that a 
fierce debate is raging within the IRA leadership over the 
declaration, with some influential figures refusing to agree to 
an end to the 25-year terrorist campaign. 
  Ulster Unionists yesterday attacked Mr Adams for 
prevaricating over the declaration while the IRA's campaign of 
violence continued. 
  Mr Ken Maginnis, the Ulster Unionist security spokesman, 
said 
that Mr Adams might be preparing "a further cynical and very 
temporary cease-fire" in order to maximise the Sinn Fein vote in 
the European elections. 
  The British Government also remains sceptical about his 
remarks, believing they are little more than "politicking" 
before the elections. 
  Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland Secretary, told the 
Cabinet yesterday that Mr Adams had not advanced the peace 
process, nor had he answered the only question concerning 
people: When would the violence end? 
  At their meeting, Mr Major and Mr Reynolds discussed closer 
co-operation on cross-border security following last week's 
loyalist attack in Dublin. 
  They said progress was being made on a framework document 
grounded in the declaration and on talks with the constitutional 
parties-and would proceed with or without Sinn Fein.

  [Text] Over to London now, where the taoiseach [Prime 
Minister Albert Reynolds] is to meet the British prime minister, 
John Major, later today. Our London correspondent, Brian 
O'Connell, asked the taoiseach for his reaction to [Sinn Fein 
President] Mr. Adams' remarks: 
  [Begin recording] [Reynolds] Well, I hope it turns out to be 
a genuine and a positive response to the situation as it is in 
the post-clarification era. At the end of the day, as far as 
both governments are concerned, what we want to hear from both 
sets of paramilitaries is a cessation of violence so that the 
talks process can get under way. 
  [O'Connell] Should he not, though, make a decision now? Why 
wait until after the European elections? What would be the 
delay? 
  [Reynolds] Well, I don't mind the delay. I don't mind a 
couple of weeks or a month, or whatever, as long as there is no 
more loss of life in the meantime. And I think the message I 
want to give to both sets of paramilitaries is that there is no 
vestige of justification for the taking of one more, single 
life. Can we stop the violence now and whatever period that 
people want to discuss and debate between themselves, that's 
fine. What we want from the paramilitaries is a cessation of 
violence to respond to the will and the wishes of the vast 
majority of the Irish and the British people, so that the talks 
process can get under way. That is the only sensible way in 
which these complex problems can be addressed and be settled in 
the end of the day. 
  [O'Connell] On the three-stranded talks process, your 
government and the British Government are in the process of 
putting together a framework or a blueprint or a document to try 
and get the parties around the table together. When can we 
expect that to be finalized? 
  [Reynolds] Well, it's always difficult to judge those things 
and they're always difficult documents to put together, but the 
ground rules have been set by the Downing Street Declaration, 
and it's a question of building on those ground rules to produce 
a framework document. We will certainly be doing our best to 
try and get it ready by the end of June or there abouts. 
  [O'Connell] There is still very little chance, though, of 
the 
unionists coming on board in any renewed three-stranded process. 
  [Reynolds] Well, I think they have a responsibility to their 
own community -- and indeed to the community at large -- to take 
a very responsible and a leadership line in this, and to point 
out to the paramilitaries that it's futile to continue taking 
loss of life, that this tit-for-tat vicious sectarian murder has 
to stop. Why not stop it now? I would hope that the community 
leaders and the political leaders in all the communities in the 
north of Ireland take that same line and try and impress upon 
the men of violence to stop now and let the people's problems be 
solved around the table. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds by </F>
presenter Jon Snow in London; from the "Channel Four" news 
program -- live] 
  [Text] [Snow] Could you characterize what you think has 
actually happened today, where are we in the process, is there 
as Ken Maginnis [Ulster Unionist Security Spokesman] seems to be 
asking, is there indeed a process? 
  [Reynolds] There are two processes going on: First of all 
there is the peace process, and both governments are both agreed 
very strongly and firmly today that we continue the search for 
peace in Ireland and that is what the vast majority of the 
people in Ireland and indeed the British people will want us to 
do. We are disappointed that violence still continues and 
escalates. We have said quite clearly to the paramilitaries on 
both sides today -- not on one side but on both sides because 
there has been vicious sectarian murders over the last number of 
weeks, and in fact Loyalist violence has to take responsibility 
for the majority of the deaths that have taken place since the 
first of January -- so we repeat our message and our call to 
both communities. I fully support James Molyneaux's [Ulster 
Unionist Leader] call for immediate cessation of loyalist 
violence, and we repeat that same message to Sinn Fein today. A 
message we want to hear from Sinn Fein is a cessation of 
violence, that is the next logical step on the road to peace. 
The Downing Street declaration represents very significant 
progress between the two governments. The clarification is off 
the agenda, nobody has anything more to say about that, the next 
logical step has to be a cessation of violence by both sets of 
paramilitaries to allow the political dialogue to commence. 
  [Snow] Well of course there are unionists who are saying 
actually that the clarification process does have something. 
There is still something to say about it -- and that is Gerry 
Adams in thanking you for getting the British Government to 
clarify -- you actually pushed the British Government to do more 
than they would want to have done. 
  [Reynolds] I don't need the thanks of anybody to do what I 
believe is right in the search for peace on this island; I have 
said that from the very start. I have given clarification at 
the very start to advance the peace process. I have said that 
if there was any renegotiation being asked for by Sinn Fein or 
anybody else I wouldn't support it at all. The questions that 
were there were responded to by the British Government, he 
[Adams] has already admitted today that there is no more 
clarification -- it's off the agenda. Quite clearly the next 
step and the next question we want answered from Sinn Fein and 
from the Republican movement and from the Loyalist 
paramilitaries is a cessation of violence, because it's quite 
clear from where we are at today that there isn't a single 
vestige of justification left for either paramilitaries to carry 
out these sectarian murders that are going on. What is the 
justification in anybody's mind, in anybody's conscience to go 
out and shoot in cold blood just because they profess a 
different religion to their own no matter which side you come 
from? It must be clear to everybody that the only way ahead for 
a solution to this problem is for all parties to get around the 
table. We are proceeding with our work behind the scenes to 
have the framework document ready. What indeed Mr. Maginnis and 
the Unionist leadership would do well is to take on their own 
responsibility of leadership and to tell their own 
paramilitaries as indeed James Molyneaux did, that the road 
ahead is by political dialogue and not by sectarian violence. 
  [Snow] Well now what is your reading of what's happening 
inside Sinn Fein, because some are saying the need for 
clarification was really something which was designed to see 
whether they could increase the number of doves, if you like, 
inside Sinn Fein who were prepared to see a peace settlement and 
outweigh the number of hawks. Some people said it was 60-40 in 
favor of the Downing Street declaration, that the clarification 
may have moved that up to 70-30, what do you think is happening? 
  [Reynolds] I have heard that as well but I have no 
information to suggest which is right or which is wrong. But 
one thing is certain from our meeting today that is there is a 
clear message gone out that no paramilitary organization is 
going to bolster or improve their position by carrying on 
violence. So I'm not in a position to answer your question 
whether it's 60 per cent or 70 percent. But I think whatever 
percentage it is we want a cessation of violence and we want it 
now. 
  [Snow] Are you optimistic that that clarificatory process 
has 
moved the argument on, and that we are in a better placed 
position to get a positive answer from Sinn Fein today than we 
were two weeks ago? 
  [Reynolds] Well I have always believed that there will be 
many blockages along the road to peace, I have always believed 
it would be a rocky road, but it's our responsibility to remove 
those road blocks out of the way. The road block of 
clarification has been removed, there maybe other difficulties 
along the way but both governments are committed to follow the 
road to peace and the search for peace, and that's what people 
want us to do. I don't know how far it has moved -- the 
percentage up or down, I am not in a position to know that, I 
don't have any information. But what I do say is that it now 
appears to everybody and every responsible person thinking about 
this that the blockages that were there have gone, the reality 
is that now is the time for a cessation of violence, that is the 
only logical step that I can think of. 
  [Snow] What happens if Sinn Fein does say no? 
  [Reynolds] We continue anyway, whether they say yes or 
whether they say no. The two governments are not going to wait 
around, waiting for paramilitaries to make up their mind. We 
are going ahead with the political process with the framework 
for the talks that can allow people to come back around the 
table. And after all it is the two Unionist parties at the 
moment who have taken a standoff position in relation to 
political dialogue. So on the one hand it's a bit disingenuous 
to talk about the two governments should get into the political 
process when the two parties that are really standing off this 
situation are the two Unionists parties, they have to examine 
their own position. 
  [Snow] One final question, at the weekend Archbishop Eames 
speaking very much for the Protestant community in the north 
talked of a real climate of fear. There are others in the 
nationalist community who in the spate of Loyalist killings talk 
of a terrible climate of fear. There is not much time to play 
with at the moment is there? This is heading for some serious 
trouble if things don't come good in really a matter of weeks? 
  [Reynolds] One would hope that it wouldn't get any worse 
than 
it is, but what the Downing Street declaration did was to 
address the fears and concerns of both communities in an 
even-handed way. The fears of uncertainty in relation to the 
possibility of being coerced into a united Ireland -- which was 
a genuine fear of the Unionist community -- that has been 
addressed quite clearly and unequivocally. The question of the 
principle of consent on which the Downing Street declaration is 
grounded was another very, very important factor and an area of 
concern to the Unionist population. Those have been answered by 
a solemn declaration of both governments. The second-class 
citizenship of the nationalist community, the fear of how they 
would be treated in future -- it was not acceptable for them to 
be treated the way they have been treated over the last 50 
years. Those fears and concerns were addressed there too, so 
there has to be an equal treatment of both communities, a parity 
of esteem in relation to both communities, those were the issues 
that were the concern. Now there will always be and always have 
been people with different vested interests to stop a peace 
process, but the two democratically elected governments are not 
going to be deterred, or be blackmailed or whatever into 
dropping a peace process in the face of some of this terrorist 
blackmail that is going on -- we are not going to do it, and the 
sooner the people realize that and get the message straight to 
them that the day is over for a cessation of violence, [as 
heard] the two governments are going to move ahead with or 
without the paramilitaries.

  [Text] Moving north now, the Sinn Fein president, Gerry 
Adams, has welcomed some aspects of the British government's 
response to his party's questions on the Downing Street 
Declaration. He said today that the peace process was moving 
forward, however slowly, but he indicated that Sinn Fein would 
not be responding comprehensively until after the European 
election. Our northern editor, David Daven-Parr, asked him how 
helpful he felt the response was from the British Government: 
  [Begin recording] [Adams] Well, I think the provision of 
clarification may in many ways be more significant even than the 
substance -- remember, for the last five months the British 
refused to provide clarification and did so in the most 
insulting and provocative language -- so I think that then they 
took 21 pages to answer. I think it's worth noting that this 
happened as a result of an initiative from Ireland which 
involved the Dublin government, ourselves and of which Mr. Hume 
was aware. So, helpful in terms of the provision; in terms of 
the answers, some responses, I think, are useful. The 
addressing of some of the core issues with the Sinn Fein 
mandate, the Government of Ireland Act, and so on. The ignoring 
of other questions is not helpful. So, a mixed bag, anyway. We 
have to take all of this into account and come at it positively. 
  [Daven-Parr] You warned in a couple of statements before the 
response that it might be a dismissive one. Were you pleasantly 
surprised when you got such a comprehensive statement? 
  [Adams] Well, I was pleased -- not on any personal level, 
because I am quite thick-skinned -- that the provocative 
language, the insulting language which was part of the 
atmospherics, I think, of building the peace process, or not, 
was absent like that we didn't have any talk about 
decontamination, we didn't have any of that arrogance. 
Excepting one issue -- where they dismiss 70 years of coercion 
of nationalists here, as an assumption not based upon reality. 
So, the general tone, notwithstanding those problems, I think 
was good. 
  [Daven-Parr] What was your reaction to the news -- you may 
have been away at the time, but no doubt you have been fully 
briefed by now -- of the loyalist attack, a potentially very, 
very serious loyalist attack on a target in Dublin, resulting in 
the death of an IRA member? 
  [Adams] Well, I think first of all that was well signalled 
in 
advance by some members of the British establishment, by some 
British politicians, and particularly the members of mainstream 
unionist leaderships. Secondly, I don't think that we can 
divorce the British involvement in previous attacks in Dublin -- 
remember, the biggest casualties in any single incident came 
from the Dublin (Monaghan) bombing, and it's an open secret that 
there was a covert British involvement in that. Thirdly, the 
loyalists with their sponsors were obviously trying to 
intimidate public opinion in the 26 counties and to intimidate 
the Dublin government. They won't intimidate us, I don't 
believe they'll intimidate the Dublin government, and they 
should not be allowed to intimidate the people of Dublin. And 
can I say that [Fine Gael leader] John Bruton's remarks on all 
of this are most inappropriate. He was more concerned with the 
conduct of the funeral yesterday, than he was with the incident 
or its circumstances. [end recording]

<F P=106> [By Chris Parkin, PA News] </F>
  [Text] Prime Minister John Major and his Irish counterpart 
Albert Reynolds began talks in Downing Street tonight to review 
the progress of the joint push for peace in Northern Ireland 
they launched together more than five months ago. 
  They met after Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams offered what 
sounded like new hope of ending the sectarian slaughter, saying 
he was convinced a settlement would come out of the peace 
process. 
  He indicated there would be a Sinn Fein response to the 
Downing Street declaration of December 15 after the June 9 
European elections. 
  However, there were the first signs today that Sinn Fein, 
the 
IRA's political wing, is suffering internal tensions over its 
approach. 
  Members critical of the leadership were accused of trying to 
damage the peace process. 
  Mr. Adams told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "I am quite 
convinced that what is going to come out of this peace process 
is a peace settlement -- I am quite convinced about it. It is a 
significant step. 
  "It is part of one of those steps which are required to 
advance the peace process. It addresses some of the core issues 
and it dismisses some of the other questions." 
  He said the fact that the British Government had responded 
to 
Sinn Fein's list of questions about the Downing Street 
declaration was in itself "very significant". 
  Meanwhile, Mr. Major and Mr. Reynolds were meeting against a 
background of continuing terrorist violence. 
  Prime aim of their discussions was to consider the reaction 
to a detailed British response a week ago to Sinn Fein's request 
for clarification of their peace declaration. 
  But persistent gun and bomb attacks in Northern Ireland and, 
last weekend, in the Irish Republic -- when Ulster Loyalist 
paramilitaries shot an IRA man in a Dublin bar -- ensured that 
security issues would remain high on the agenda for tonight's 
exchanges. 
  The two leaders were also due to assess progress made by 
officials from their two governments towards establishing a 
framework for resuming all-party cross-border talks on Ulster's 
future. Those discussions stalled near the end of 1992 after a 
series of disagreements. 
  Since then, Northern Ireland Office ministers have been 
involved in behind-the-scenes meetings with party officials in a 
bid to kick-start the talks process. 
  Meetings between officials are thought to have made advances 
towards a timetable for beginning the inter-party discussions 
again. But it is thought likely to be the end of the summer 
before meaningful talks get under way.

Air-to-Air Missiles awarded to British Aerospace in March 1992 
is proceeding well." 
  He added: "Following a recent review of the operational 
requirements of the RAF's Harrier and new European Fighter

<F P=106> [By Charles Miller, Defence Correspondent, PA News] </F>
  [Text] The Royal Navy was forced tonight to postpone the 
first launch of a Trident ballistic missile from a British 
submarine because of protests by Greenpeace, the anti-nuclear 
campaigners claimed. 
  Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind was aboard the 16,000-ton 
HMS Vanguard submerged off the coast of Florida to witness the 
historic firing of the unarmed Trident II D-5 missile. 
  But as Vanguard put its mast out of the water, Greenpeace 
activists converged on the area in inflatables, while their 
helicopter hovered overhead. 
  "One of our merchant ships Solo was in the area and we were 
able to identify Vanguard's precise position when they put up 
its mast," said a Greenpeace spokeswoman in London. 
  "We launched inflatables as well as the ship's helicopter 
and 
the test firing has had to be postponed." 
  The Ministry of Defence [MoD] said it was awaiting 
information from its vessels in the area. 
  Vanguard, first of the fleet of four Trident submarines and 
built by VSEL of Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria took missiles on 
board at the US facility at King's Bay, Georgia. 
  Britain is buying 70 US missiles, which it will arm with 
British-manufactured nuclear warheads, to replace the existing 
Polaris system gradually from the end of this year. 
  The aim of the first firing on the US range off Cape 
Canaveral was to prove that the crew could safely handle and 
operate the sophisticated missile system. 
  The US Navy has successfully test fired 55 D-5 missiles 
after 
a disastrous first firing when the missile careered out of 
control like a giant Catherine Wheel firework. 
  The MoD said later: "Due to the intrusion of a number of 
surface vessels that have sailed into the range area, the launch 
of the UK's first Trident II D-5 missile has been temporarily 
delayed." 
  Greenpeace said a US Navy helicopter was attempting to force 
its helicopter out of the area.

  Text] Reports that the Malaysian Government was set to end 
its ban on public contracts for British businesses were welcomed 
by the Foreign Office today. "We shall be delighted if these 
reports prove to be true," a spokesman said. 
  This followed a reported meeting between Richard Needham, 
the 
British Trade Minister, with his counterpart Rafidah Aziz in 
Kuala Lumpur. Mr Aziz was quoted as saying: "I am confident 
that it will be lifted, but as for the timing, we cannot say." 
  The row blew up after the Sunday Times printed a story in 
February claiming a British construction company was prepared to 
offer Malaysian Premier Mohamad Mahathir a 35,000 pounds 
sterling bribe to secure a building contract. 
  This was fiercely denied by Mr Mahathir at a time when a 
controversy was raging over 234 million pounds sterling British 
aid for the Pergau dam, and claims that this was, wrongly, 
linked to Britain's hopes of securing a 1 billion pounds 
sterling arms deal with Malaysia. 
  Downing Street today denied a report that Mr Needham had 
handed Mr Mahathir a letter from Prime Minister John Major. 
"There was no such letter," a spokesman for No. 10 [Downing 
St.] said, "although Mr Major's office and the Malaysian Prime 
Minister's office have kept in close touch." 
  Mr Needham is expected back in Britain some time tomorrow. 
  Malaysia imposed its damaging ban some three months ago 
after 
British newspaper reports that trade between the two countries 
was tainted by corruption. However, there were promising signs 
over the weekend when Mr Mahathir said that British media 
reporting on Malaysia had "improved". 
  "We are encouraged to see these reports coming out of 
Malaysia," the Foreign Office spokesman added. 
  There is no doubt that British business has been hit hard by 
this ban. The British Government has always said that it has no 
control over what appears in British newspapers.

<F P=106> [By Amanda Brown, Health Correspondent, PA News] </F>
  [Text] A leading Government health expert is insisting: 
"There is no killer bug sweeping the country." 
  Dr Diana Walford, Director of the Public Health Laboratory 
Service [PHLS], attacked the barrage of publicity over the 
flesh-eating disease necrotising fasciitis. 
  She issued a new official list which showed there had been 
15 
cases due to the disease since January 1, including four of the 
seven reported cases from the Gloucestershire area. 
  Although she did not specify how many of the cases had 
proved 
fatal, at least 10 deaths are being officially attributed to the 
disease. 
  The move, aimed at calming growing public fears of an 
epidemic, followed a top-level meeeting of public health experts 
and microbiolgisits, who have painstakingly sifted through the 
figures. 
  Dr Walford's comments came as cases continued to emerge of 
the horrifying virus which can devour flesh in hours. 
  The unofficial death toll this year rose to 13 with news of 
the case of an 85-year-old woman from Bridgend, Mid Glamorgan, 
earlier this month, but there were also reports of a 71-year-old 
woman who died in March from the bug in a Newcastle upon Tyne 
hospital. 
  Dr Walford said of the official statistics: "These low 
figures therefore confirm that necrotising fasciitis arising 
from Group A Streptococci (bacteria) remains a rare disease. 
  "The public should be reassured that there is no `killer 
bug' 
sweeping the country." 
  Earlier yesterday, Health Secretary Virginia Bottomley 
appealed for calm, insisting everything possible was being done 
to fight the bug. 
  She did not think it was necessary to make it a notifiable 
disease. 
  "The Chief Medical Officer is briefing ministers regularly. 
There is no evidence that the numbers we are seeing are 
untoward," she added. 
  Shadow health secretary David Blunkett called for the 
Government to reverse cutbacks and redundancies planned for the 
PHLS. 
  He said: Instead of acting swiftly to maximise safety and to 
allay the understandable fears of many people, the Government is 
axing the vital research designed to protect us from this type 
of threat. 
  "Virginia Bottomley cannot simply sit tight and hope that 
this outbreak is going to disappear." 
  The widow of a man killed by the flesh-eating bug received a 
letter from a hospital saying he was getting better -- three 
days after he was cremated on January 28. 
  Doreen Bargery was told by St Peter's Hospital in Cherstey, 
Surrey, that Les was making "slow but shaky progress", more than 
a week after he died. 
  Mr Fash, chief executive at St Peter's Hospital, said: "We 
did apologise to Mrs Bargery profusely at the time. Mrs Bargery 
is understandably very upset about her husband's death. 
  "We were investigating a number of points she raised about 
her husband's illness and we had kept in touch with her 
husband's case periodically."

  [Text] Political Spring Chairman Andonios Samaras has asked 
the government to stop the simple representations and bring the 
issue of Greek minority arrests in Albania to international 
human rights organizations. At the same time, he called on the 
government to exclude Albania from all financing or aid supplied 
by the European Union. 
  A statement issued by the KKE [Greek Communist Party] 
Central 
Committee Press Office stresses that there is concern over the 
fate of the Greek minority in Albania. The statement adds: 
Following the recent intervention by the United States in 
Greek-Albanian relations with its report on the issues of the 
Greek minority, nationalist and chauvinist circles have felt 
that there is freedom of action. The [Albanian President Sali] 
Berisha government has capitalized on U.S. intervention and 
support with the expansion of arrests of Greek Albanians. The 
KKE has protested the systematic attempt to spread instability 
in the Balkans and all those who support it by participating in 
or being driven to nationalist and chauvinist actions.

  [Text] Turkey recently launched a defamatory campaign 
against Greece, accusing it of training persons who carry out 
terrorist attacks in its territory. 
  This was stated by Foreign Ministry Spokesman Konstandinos 
Bikas today in response to a question on the recent charges by 
Turkey against our country. It is obvious, the Foreign Ministry 
spokesman added, that these charges are totally unfounded 
because they do not contribute to the normalization of relations 
between the two countries. Bikas concluded that Greece desires 
the normalization of relations between the two countries, which 
depends on Turkey's stance on the Cyprus issue, the respect of 
our sovereign rights in the Aegean and, of course, no more 
unfounded charges against our country. 
  An ASSOCIATED PRESS dispatch relayed today from Ismir said 
that police arrested 17 Kurdish rebels who, it said, were 
trained in Greece. In addition, the Turkish Coast Guard 
confiscated three boats with explosives and ammunition.

<F P=106> [Report by Yeoryios Karelias] </F>
  [Excerpt] What is the most interesting question about the 
12 June European Parliament elections? 
  While it may seem unusual, it is not the percentages of the 
two biggest parties, which are more or less as expected. The 
"unknown factor" is the percentage of the Political Spring 
party, which could be decisive for political developments. 
  A top government official estimates that if Andonios 
Samaras' 
party [Political Spring] gathers a percentage in the double 
digits (last October it gathered almost 5 percent), it will then 
become a regulator in political affairs. 
  There are three reasons for government concern over such a 
possibility: 
  1. It will become more difficult, if not impossible, to 
realize [Prime Minister] Andreas Papandreou's goal of jumping 
over to the Republic's Presidency. 
  2. Elections in the spring of 1995 will be inevitable, as 
Samaras has every reason to seek them. 
  23. The government will be in a very difficult position 
when it comes to accepting a compromise solution on Skopje [The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], as the reaction 
of a reinforced Political Spring cannot be ignored. 
  According to the estimates of government officials, the only 
positive point from a possible big electoral increase for 
Political Spring, is that the conservative faction will finally 
be divided and in that way unable to seek the Presidency. 
"First place for PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement in the 
European Parliament elections] is certain," they said. These 
calculations by government officials are mainly based on the 
(hypothetical) certainty that Samaras' party will cause greater 
damage to New Democracy, while PASOK will be first despite the 
"logical and natural loss" expected by a party in power. A vote 
ranging from 42 to 43 percent is considered a "good result" for 
PASOK. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [From the "Militant Comment" column: "Robert Lamb"] </F>
  [Text] It has been reported that a replacement has been 
found for Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department's special 
coordinator on the Cyprus issue. He is John Kornblum, the U.S. 
delegate to the CSCE. 
  We do not know the new coordinator, but we do hope that he 
will look at the Cyprus issue through a very different lens than 
his predecessor. Lamb repeatedly proved to be dishonest, 
unreliable, dishonorable, misleading, and deceitful. He has 
served in the position of coordinator for six months. During 
this period not only did he not help Cyprus, but on the contrary 
he harmed it. 
  Very justifiably, the Cypriot Government is strongly 
dissatisfied with Lamb's role in the Cyprus issue. In Vienna 
recently, Lamb dishonestly and deceitfully tried to make changes 
to the 21 March UN document. Therefore, we hope that the new 
U.S. coordinator will carry out his mission honestly and really 
help Cyprus resolve its persistent problem in a just manner.

  [Text] Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis today 
stressed that the Cypriot Government will not negotiate the 
confidence-building measures. He said this week was 
disappointing because the UN secretary general -- unjustifiably 
-- did not submit his report to the Security Council. The 
spokesman added: Butrus-Ghali now has the report to finalize 
and it is up to him to decide. 
  Referring to Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas' actions, 
the spokesman said they are part of his delaying tactics. He 
concluded: He is making fun of the UN secretary general and the 
Security Council.

  [Text] President Rauf Denktas said that the promise that 
changes would be made in the 21 March document, which violated 
the package of confidence-building measures to the detriment of 
the Turkish Cypriot side, has not been fulfilled. He held talks 
on developments related to the confidence-building measures 
today with U.S. Ambassador Richard Boucher and then with Gustave 
Feissel, the UN secretary general's deputy special 
representative. In a statement after his nearly two-hour 
meeting with Ambassador Boucher, Denktas drew attention to the 
difference of opinion between the UN secretary general and U.S. 
officials on the talks. Replying to a question on the 
difference of views between the UN secretary general and U.S. 
officials, Denktas said: 
  [Begin Denktas recording] We have been clearly informed [by 
UN officials] as follows: The United States is the United 
States. Its representative represents that country. We represent 
the UN secretary general. We do not interfere in what U.S. 
officials say. So, do not attach importance to what they say. 
  We are confused because we are wasting hours and days on the 
matter. We have been trying to explain our case, requests, and 
problems to the U.S. representative. On his part, he has said 
this or that. Meanwhile, Gustav Feissel has made various 
promises. However, he then crossed into south Cyprus and 
informed the Greek Cypriots that the 21 March document will not 
be changed. That is not the way to maintain the talks. 
  The United States and Feissel must make an effort to change 
the document. I mean that the document will be changed if the 
promises that have been made to us are included in the 
agreement. A promise has been made to us in that regard. 
However, it seems that everyone has forgotten that. Well, in 
that case we cannot be blamed for obstructing the talks. [end 
recording] 
  Explaining that a promise had been made to the Turkish 
Cypriot side that the 21 March document, which was added to the 
original confidence-building measures package but was rejected 
by the Turkish Cypriot side, would be changed, President Denktas 
recalled a statement by Greek Cypriot leader Glavkos Kliridhis 
that his side would object to a reduction in any point. 
Stressing that the existing confusion must be stopped, he 
asserted that the Turkish Cypriot side continues to act with 
goodwill on the package. Regarding the recent map on Maras 
[Varosha], he said that pressure is still being put on the 
Turkish Cypriot side to accept it. Denktas said: That is their 
most serious mistake. However, they are trying to force us to 
agree to it. 
  Stressing that he drew Ambassador Boucher's attention to 
Kliridhis' statements that the Greek Cypriots will reach Kyrenia 
and place the entire island under their control, Denktas said 
Kliridhis' approach, which is supported by Greece, conflicts 
with the spirit of the talks and the concept of partnership. 
  [Begin Denktas recording] Kliridhis talked about traveling 
to 
Kyrenia and placing the entire island under his control. 
Naturally, all that cannot be linked with the talks that have 
been held for so many years and with the establishment of a new 
partnership republic, which is called for by those talks. 
Kliridhis has adopted an irresponsible and dangerous approach. 
Greece has definitely played a role in it. PASOK [Panhellenic 
Socialist Movement] has adopted a resolution for a unitary state 
in Cyprus. That resolution is common knowledge. Acting in 
light of that resolution, the Greek Cypriots have decided to 
allow Greece to establish a naval base in Paphos. That, too, is 
common knowledge. Meanwhile, we are well aware of the Byzantine 
tactics the Greek Cypriots have employed to acquire 90 tanks 
from France. Greece argued that it supposedly scrapped those 
tanks. However, they can be modernized in France to be used as 
effective combat vehicles. All those preparations, statements, 
activities, and steps to join the European Union indicate that 
the Turkish Cypriot side is not being taken seriously. No one 
wishes to recognize the conditions that have compelled the 
Turkish Cypriots to establish their own state in Cyprus. 
Likewise, no one wishes to realize that the Government of the 
Cyprus Republic does not exist and that the Greek Cypriot 
Republic in south Cyprus has been misleading the world into 
believing that it represents the legal Cyprus Government. 
  I have explained those realities to Ambassador Boucher. They 
have headed the Cyprus problem in the wrong direction. They 
have done a great injustice to the Turkish Cypriots for 30 
years. No one in the world can force the Turkish Cypriots to 
accept the Greek Cypriot Administration as their government. 
[end recording] 
  Replying to a question, President Denktas said that it is 
very appropriate on the part of Ozker Ozgur, deputy prime 
minister and leader of the Republican Turkish Party, to send 
letters to him on the negotiating process. He said that Ozgur 
outlines his party's views on the confidence-building measures 
package and the negotiating process in his letters. 
  Speaking after his meeting with Denktas, Ambassador Boucher 
described the confidence-building measures package as a good 
opportunity for the two communities in Cyprus and stressed that 
it must not be missed. Asserting that his country intends to 
establish the arrangements required for reactivating the process 
on the confidence-building measures package, Ambassador Boucher 
said the opportunity for accepting the package has not yet been 
missed. He also noted that the confidence-building measures 
package must be maintained and progress must be achieved in the 
talks with the UN officials. 
  In a statement to the correspondents after his luncheon with 
Gustave Feissel, which lasted for nearly two hours, President 
Denktas said that vague points must be clarified so the Turkish 
Cypriot side can be in a position to reply to the points in the 
nondocument, dated 21 March. Asserting that another point is 
also important for the Turkish Cypriot side, Denktas said: That 
is the fact that the nondocument has been converted into a 
proposal by the UN secretary general. 
  Stressing that an opportunity has been given to the Greek 
Cypriot side to hide behind the nondocument, Denktas described 
that approach as a Byzantine design. He noted that the 
embassies of the UN permanent members in Nicosia are aware of 
the fact that almost all of the Greek Cypriot political party 
leaders have rejected the confidence-building measures package. 
  Replying to a question, Denktas said that the UN secretary 
general's report has not been deliberately postponed and noted 
that the postponement creates an opportunity for the sides to 
maintain their work. Denktas also said that certain issues have 
to be discussed and the benefits that have been promised to the 
Turkish Cypriot side have to be given a tangible form and 
outlined in writing. Denktas expressed the hope that the UN 
secretary general will maintain a balanced approach in his 
report. 
  Asserting that the Turkish Cypriot side has not arrived at 
the point where it can say yes or no, Denktas said that the 
Turkish Cypriot Council of Ministers may take up the matter if 
necessary after he returns from his visit to Turkey. 
  On his part, Gustave Feissel said the points discussed were 
those that Denktas asked to be clarified or confirmed. However, 
he declined to explain them. Feissel recalled that the Turkish 
Cypriot side has been expected to give its reply on several key 
points in the confidence-building measures package. He noted, 
however, that the expected reply was not given today. 
  Feissel also recalled that the UN secretary general's report 
is about to be published and described the present stage in the 
talks as the latest point reached in the negotiating process. 
He said that he will inform New York of the developments and 
noted that he will be in touch with President Denktas before and 
after the UN secretary general's report is published.

  [Text] President Rauf Denktas said it is important to the 
Turkish Cypriot side that it be understood that there are 
ambiguities with regard to several issues in the 
confidence-building measures package. Denktas noted that the 
Turkish Cypriot side is pleased with the recognition that there 
are still issues that must be discussed. The president met with 
Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's assistant special 
envoy to Cyprus, for approximately two hours today. 
  In a statement to the press after the meeting, Denktas 
remarked that the noted ambiguous points must be clarified if 
the Turkish Cypriot side is to decide on its response to the 21 
March nondocument document. Pointing out that there is a second 
important issue for the Turkish Cypriot side, Denktas noted that 
this consists of the fact that the nondocument document has been 
transformed into the UN secretary general's proposals. The 
Greek Cypriot side has been given the opportunity to hide behind 
this nonexistent document, Denktas noted, adding that this is a 
Byzantine trick. 
  Denktas also stated that the ambassadors to Lefkosa 
[Nicosia] 
from the UN Security Council permanent member countries are 
aware that almost none of the Greek Cypriot political party 
leaders have accepted the confidence-building measures. 
  In reply to a question, Denktas said the UN secretary 
general's report is being postponed in order to allow for the 
continuation of the work and not with ulterior motives. There 
are still aspects for discussion and benefits promised to the 
Turkish Cypriot side to be solidified and written down, Denktas 
added. He also hoped that the UN secretary general would act in 
a balanced way with regard to the report. 
  Stressing that the Turkish Cypriot side never reached the 
point of saying yes or no, Denktas declared that, if necessary, 
the Council of Ministers will discuss the issue upon his return 
from Turkey. 
  In his statement after the meeting, Feissel declared that 
some of the issues Denktas wanted clarified or confirmed were 
discussed during the meeting. Feissel did not specify of what 
these consist. He announced that he is waiting for a Turkish 
Cypriot response on a few key issues concerning the 
confidence-buidling measures and he did not receive any replies 
during today's meeting. Pointing out that the UN secretary 
general's report will soon be announced, Feissel described the 
current situation as the most advanced phase of the process and 
added that he will brief New York on the latest developments. 
Feissel concluded by saying that he will be in contact with 
Denktas both before and after the announcement of the report.

<F P=106> [Report by Ergun Goze] </F>
  [Text] Nicosia -- We obtained the Greek Cypriots' secret 
map on Nicosia International Airport, one of the key points in 
the Cyprus talks. The most conspicuous feature in this map 
submitted for the first time to the Turkish side is that it has 
allotted a very small area to the TRNC [Turkish Republic of 
Northern Cyprus]. 
  Another conspicuous point is that despite a promise to allot 
a separate customs area at the airport to the Turks, no such 
marking exists on the map. 
  The Greek Cypriots reportedly submitted their airport 
proposal quite late. Out of concern for public reaction 
directed against the Kliridhis administration for allotting a 
separate road to the Turks, the map was conveyed to the TRNC 
quietly. 
  It appears that the map, which was given to the Turkish side 
on the first day of the Muslim festival of sacrifice--as if it 
were good news--was not prepared sincerely. This is because the 
Greek Cypriots are saying that they have already built houses 
near the airport over the past 20 years, that the opening of the 
airport will bring with it noise and pollution, and that they 
will take legal action against it. 
  No one doubts that the Greek Cypriot courts will readily 
approve such cases and rule in their favor. Thus, after getting 
Varosha, the Greek Cypriots will announce some concessions and 
then take them back through the courts. 
  In view of all these developments, the notion that 
recognition of the TRNC is the only path to a solution is 
gaining strength on the Turkish side. Political observers are 
also indicating that it is now better understood how wrong it 
was to present the airport to the United Nations after its 
capture by Turkish units in 1974. [On its front page the paper 
publishes a map of Nicosia Airport with a description of the 
zones in English]

<F P=106> [Kaa Eneberg report: "Proposal for Nordic Union Raised Too </F>
Early"] 
  [Text] Ytterjarna -- A Nordic league with a common 
security policy and good relations with the European Union [EU]. 
This could be the alternative the Green Ecology Party offers 
the voters in this fall's election instead of Swedish EU 
membership. 
  The delegates, however, rejected such a proposal at the 
party's congress that ended in Ytterjarna yesterday. 
  Instead, the party executive was given the task of looking 
into deeper Nordic cooperation as one of several alternatives to 
the EU. 
  The investigation will be headed by party pioneer Asa 
Domeij. 
For personal reasons this party superstar has chosen not to 
remain on the party executive or run in the Riksdag election. 
But the party leadership was swift to seize on her promise to 
continue to work for the party. It is expected that with her at 
the head of this sensitive work there will not be much unrest in 
the party ranks. 
  One godparent of the idea of a confederation of the Nordic 
states is Armed Forces Supreme Commander Bengt Gustafsson, 
another is Johan Galtung. As an established green politician 
and EU critic, the Norwegian peace researcher had been invited 
to the congress. He outlined 10 alternatives to EU membership 
and dismissed as lunacy any suggestion that Sweden would be able 
to remain neutral as an EU member. 
  Norway's tiny Green party is as categorically EU critical as 
the Green Ecology Party, which describes itself as the only 
party in Swedish politics with 100-percent support for 
opposition to the EU. 
  Birger Schlaug, the Green Ecology Party's "mouthpiece," took 
the defeat at the party congress calmly, as did Per Gahrton, who 
heads the party's massive opposition to the EU. 
  Birger Schlaug pointed out that the idea of a Nordic league 
is by no means new and that these ideas have been given further 
nourishment by Supreme Commander Bengt Gustafsson. 
  The supreme commander's positive remarks concerning a Nordic 
defense league have irritated Prime Minister Carl Bildt. But 
Birger Schlaug said proudly that the supreme commander's remarks 
in Finland a few months ago came at the right time for the Green 
Ecology Party. Bengt Gustafsson has even been invited to a 
meeting of the party executive to expand on his remarks. 
  At what otherwise was a harmonious congress that ended here 
yesterday at the anthroposophists' impressive headquarters, the 
proposal for a Nordic league was the only notable defeat for the 
party executive. The proposal was thought to be too 
far-reaching, involving a common currency and security policy, 
for the congress' taste. 
  "There can never be any suggestion of a mini-EU. That is 
something we do not want. Instead we want a confederation of 
states in which every state retains its sovereignty and is in 
favor of increased involvement in the UN of which all countries 
are members. A certain amount of supranationality is possible, 
in the field of environmental threats that cross national 
boundaries," Per Gahrton explained. 
  Both the party's "mouthpieces," like the majority of 
delegates, were satisfied with the party congress that had 
clearly been kept in its place in order not to jeopardize the 
election campaign. Everyone is hoping, and expecting, a return 
to the Riksdag this fall on a 5.5-percent share of the vote. 
  One sign of the efforts not to create convulsions or 
personal conflicts in the party was that only a few opted to 
vote for changes to the role of the "mouthpieces." Calls for 
changes were to be found in a number of motions that had 
received the backing of the party executive. But the party 
executive had clearly become frightened and rejected these 
motions. This happened at the last minute before the congress 
so that there was time to add corrections only to some of the 
conference material. 
  One motion calling for the immediate appointment of a party 
leader received only a weak defense from its proposer, Bo 
Thunell. 
  The party executive's Ewa Larsson advocated that the party 
should retain its two "mouthpieces" using the argument that the 
party has always been a "pathfinder" and that other parties are 
now beginning to copy this model. She did not mention New 
Democracy, with its two leaders. She did mention, however, the 
more active role of Social Democrats and party secretary Mona 
Sahlin as an example of an attempt to follow in the footsteps of 
the Green Ecology Party. 
  "We are in agreement in the party and no longer have any 
personal conflicts," Birger Schlaug said by way of summing up. 
  Veteran Eva Goes chose, however, to go home halfway through 
the congress and decline reelection to the party executive 
without telling anyone other then the party election committee. 
In the past she shared the "mouthpiece" role with Birger 
Schlaug, but there has at times been open confrontation between 
the two. 
  Former "mouthpiece" Jan Axelsson tried to create a little 
more unrest by writing articles critical of Birger Schlaug's 
leadership methods and trumpeting his resignation from the party 
in a press statement. However, Eva Goes is staying. But with 
the lower profile for these two, the group of "fundamentalists" 
in the party is thought to have shrunk. 
  "I hope that not all the fundamentalists will disappear. 
They are needed. I myself am a fundamentalist, but a realistic 
one," Per Gahrton joked before leaving the congress. 
  The party congress gave its backing to a proposal that in 
the 
next parliamentary period the party should work for a 35-hour 
workweek. An allergy cleanup program was also adopted. This is 
seen as an argument against EU membership because, according to 
the party executive, it is hardly likely to meet with much 
sympathy in Brussels. 
  Using equality as an argument, a call for the formation of a 
women's organization was rejected.

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Maria Brunet: "Serra Asserts That Roldan's </F>
Lies Will Not Affect His Record"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- Deputy Prime Minister Narcis Serra stated 
yesterday that the "lies" told by former Civil Guard Director 
General Luis Roldan "can never affect my record as a 
politician." Serra attacked the People's Party for giving 
credence to the accusations leveled against him by Roldan, and 
attributed to People's Party Chairman Jose Maria Aznar -- absent 
from the session -- "a lack of political ethics and courage" for 
leveling unfounded accusations against him in connection with 
the Roldan affair. Serra made these statements in reply to 
questions from People's Party deputies Luis Ramallo and Rogelio 
Baon on the Roldan affair at the Congress of Deputies plenary 
session. 
  For their part, the People's Party representatives took the 
view that Serra should accept political responsibility for 
Roldan's appointment as Civil Guard director general. Ramallo 
accused Serra of being "afraid" at the possibility of appearing 
before the parliamentary committee of enquiry into the affair. 
Serra said in reply that the People's Party was pursuing a 
policy of "defamation" and unproven accusations in this affair. 
<H5>  Tense Atmosphere </H5>
  Serra's appearance came during the weekly question period. 
Deputies Ramallo and Baon asked him eight questions in a tense 
atmosphere characterized by constant interruptions, and booing 
and applauding of the speakers. The session provided no new 
information about the Roldan affair. Ramallo emphasized that, 
in any event, the deputy prime minister had given his word and 
that this would be on record in the Congress minutes, so that if 
he were some day found to be untruthful in describing his 
relations with Roldan, he could be called to account immediately. 
  The eight questions asked by Ramallo and Baon -- the 
People's 
Party's representatives on the committee that has investigated 
Roldan's conduct in heading the Civil Guard -- sought to cast 
light on the relationship that may have existed between Roldan 
and Serra. The questions included the government's reasons for 
entrusting Roldan with the Crillon report on Mario Conde, which, 
according to Roldan, Serra had ordered. 
  The deputy prime minister did not confine himself to 
defending himself against the accusations leveled against him by 
the People's Party; he counterattacked, and aimed high, accusing 
People's Party leader Jose Maria Aznar of lacking ethics in his 
political conduct in believing and echoing statements made by a 
fugitive from justice. "Today the minutes of the session will 
reflect an act implying a lack of courage and political valor 
because of Mr. Aznar's absence." The People's Party chairman 
said in reply from Valladolid that Spain "will not progress 
through aspersions, or insults. No attention need be paid right 
now to those statements or to people who cannot keep their 
composure." 
  Rogelio Baon and Luis Ramallo took the view that the 
government in general and Serra in particular had assumed 
political responsibilities with respect to the Roldan affair by 
appointing him, accepting nonexistent academic qualifications, 
failing to monitor his conduct while in charge of the Civil 
Guard, ordering intelligence from the Civil Guard that should 
never have been made public, and, finally, allowing him to 
escape. 
  Serra replied to all these points by acknowledging the 
mistakes made in appointing Roldan and in allowing him to 
escape; two former ministers -- Corcuera and Asuncion -- had 
paid for this, he said, by having to relinquish their posts. In 
his opinion the government had therefore already assumed 
political responsibility for the affair insofar as it could be 
called to account. 
  "If what Mr. Roldan reveals what he has done so far," the 
deputy prime minister asserted, "let me tell you that I am 
absolutely at ease, because lies will never be able to affect my 
record as a politician. Second, more conclusive evidence about 
my relations with Mr. Roldan would have to be sought. They were 
those befitting a defense minister and a Civil Guard director 
general, or a deputy prime minister and a Civil Guard director 
general, basically because since I have been in the government I 
have tried to protect and defend that body's military nature. 
Hence, because the system of promotions and military positions 
was my responsibility as defense minister, I consulted with the 
former Civil Guard director general; I also consulted with him 
as deputy prime minister in connection with the measures adopted 
to guarantee security at events in 1992."

<F P=106> [Ramon Sune report: "Serra Asserts That Roldan's </F>
Accusations Are Dictating People's Party's Political Strategy"] 
  [Text] Barcelona -- Narcis Serra asserted yesterday that 
the "People's Party's [PP] strategy seems to be dictated by Luis 
Roldan," emphasizing the lack of consistency that, in his 
opinion, characterizes the main opposition party's conduct over 
the past few days. On the one hand "they attack us for having 
trusted" the former Civil Guard director general, but on the 
other "their only arguments are those given them by somebody who 
is fleeing justice." 
  During his speech at the opening of the Spanish Socialist 
Youth (JSE) Federal Committee meeting, held in l'Hospitalet 
yesterday, the deputy prime minister acknowledged that the trust 
placed in Roldan was "a grave mistake," and reaffirmed the 
government's pledge to place the former Civil Guard chief "in 
the hands of justice." Narcis Serra, who again denied the truth 
of all the accusations leveled against him by Luis Roldan 
through statements made to the newspaper EL MUNDO, warned that 
"we will not flinch from criticizing the PP whenever it uses 
unethical methods, insults, or threatens." "We will not follow 
them on that path," he stressed, "because we will never perform 
actions that could damage the democratic institutions' 
credibility." 
  Answering journalists' questions, Narcis Serra specified 
that 
"Mr. Roldan's false assertions were the central feature of Mr. 
Aznar's speech in last week's parliamentary debate, and also of 
the questions that the PP put to me in the Congress last 
Wednesday [18 May]." The deputy prime minister expressed regret 
that the PP, "instead of preparing a strategy of political 
debate on the matters worrying citizens, on how to combat 
corruption, should formulate a strategy of using this matter for 
partisan ends and attacking the government." "It is clear," 
Serra stressed, "that there are two stances: Some of us wish to 
resolve the problem of corruption for society's sake, while 
others are using this problem as a political weapon." 
  The deputy prime minister tried to hearten the Socialist 
Youth with promises of a 12 June election victory over the 
People's Party. He also tried to convey a hopeful view of the 
current political and economic situation with the emphatic 
assertion that "we are emerging from the tunnel" of corruption 
and crisis. Serra asserted that, despite the grave existing 
difficulties, we are experiencing "an interesting time," when 
the "need to defend ethical principles in politics" is 
particularly relevant. "The present time," the Catalan 
Socialist leader said, "requires of us a political response that 
had perhaps gotten rusty because we did not need it too much." 
  Serra asserted that the government and the Socialist Party 
are "correcting past mistakes, making up for lost time, and, 
above all, laying the foundations for greater openness and 
effectiveness in the struggle against corruption." The 
consequence of all this is that "we are going to win the battle 
against the corrupt, whoever may fall, even while knowing that 
this does not interest our political opponents because for them 
the struggle is not against corruption but against the 
Socialists." 
  The deputy prime minister criticized the PP's aim of "making 
the European elections a link in its campaign to demand Felipe 
Gonzalez' departure," and took the liberty of delivering a 
warning to his political rivals: "There are two ways to attain 
power: to win a general election, or to submit and win a censure 
motion; but until this is done the European elections are just 
that -- European elections."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Aznar Will Facilitate Gonzalez </F>
Departure and Forgoes `Lifting Carpet'"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- People's Party Chairman Jose Maria Aznar 
yesterday showed himself prepared to facilitate an "intelligent 
solution" to the country's political situation, so that nobody 
-- not even Felipe Gonzalez -- would have to leave their posts 
"with their heads bowed or hidden under their wings." 
  In statements to Antena 3 Radio, Aznar emphasized that he 
has 
no interest in "looking backward or lifting carpets," but this 
did not prevent him from again accusing the Socialist government 
and its political allies of being directly responsible for 
corruption in Spain. 
  The People's Party chairman asserted that his sole concern 
is 
to offer the electorate a blueprint for Spain's future. "We 
have no other interest, either in looking backward, or in 
lifting carpets, or in the Spanish people's persisting in 
distinguishing between one another," he asserted, since his 
concern is to turn over a new leaf in Spanish democracy. Aznar 
warned that he is not prepared to accept anybody's setting his 
personal interest above general interests. 
  In addition, he stated that he does not believe in the 
existence of the so-called captive vote, and asked what message 
of hope the Spanish Socialist Workers Party can offer when it is 
constantly having recourse to the vote of fear -- an 
"irresponsible and intolerable" political strategy aimed at 
dividing the Spanish people's votes. Jose Maria Aznar did not 
rule out the possibility of submitting a censure motion against 
the government after the European elections, once the final 
results are known, and reiterated that this political action is 
not advisable right now, since he does not have the necessary 
parliamentary support. 
<H5>  Criticisms of CiU </H5>
  In this connection, he criticized CiU [Convergence and 
Union] 
for exclusively defending its particular party interests, 
without heeding those of the country or of Catalonia; a 
community in which, according to him, unemployment grew by 30 
percent over the past year. "CiU's stance is inexplicable," he 
concluded. 
  The People's Party chairman, who yesterday visited a 
rehabilitation center for drug addicts in the Madrid district of 
Barajas, stated at the end of the visit that although all the 
opinion polls give his party as the winner in the 12 June 
European elections, he does not want "the slightest 
overconfidence. We have a vital opportunity to try to emerge 
from the crisis, and it must not be missed if we wish to 
safeguard Spain's future." 
  Next, he asserted that his party does not intend to 
dismantle 
the levels of social protection achieved in Spain over the past 
few decades, although he emphasized that "they are still below 
those of the advanced countries of the European Union," and 
stated that his party aims to set under way an "open public 
administration that will not stifle social initiatives and will 
allow citizens access to education, health, and other quality 
services." 
  With respect to Deputy Prime Minister Narcis Serra's recent 
appearance in the Congress [of Deputies], Jose Maria Aznar 
asserted that "it is not through stances of entrenchment and 
rancor that Spain will move forward," but rather through a 
blueprint for the whole country that will offer it a future and 
hope, and he identified the People's Party as the only party 
that can guarantee those aims today.

<F P=106> [Luisa Palma report: "PSOE Deems Integration Promoted by </F>
Gonzalez To Have Failed"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- The PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers 
Party] remains divided into two, and the integration promoted 
since the 33d PSOE Federal Congress has not worked. The balance 
of forces between Guerraists and renewalists is virtually the 
same as before, and Alfonso Guerra currently controls 42 percent 
of the party, while the renewalists hold 58 percent. 
  This balance is also apparent in the makeup of the Federal 
Committee, which will be completed with the holding in the 
summer of the three remaining regional congresses -- the Canary 
Islands, La Rioja, and Navarre -- although these federations' 
results are not decisive as far as the distribution of forces is 
concerned. 
<H5>  Ignored </H5>
  So the failure of integration is one of the main conclusions 
that have been reached following the holding of the PSOE 
provincial and regional congresses. Renewalists and Guerraists 
have ignored the "integration efforts" made by Organization 
Secretary Cipria Ciscar, who has done his utmost to achieve this 
aim with his interventions in the federations. 
  The process of the regional and provincial congresses shows 
that Guerra dominates six federations -- Galicia, Murcia, 
Cantabria, Aragon, Extremadura, and Asturias -- while the 
renewalists have achieved ascendancy in the Balearics, 
Castilla-Leon, Catalonia, Castilla-La Mancha, and Andalusia. 
Nevertheless, the last-mentioned federation -- the PSOE's 
largest and most important -- is divided into two, as is the 
case in Madrid. Strictly speaking, integration has really 
worked only in Valencia and the Basque Country. 
  The three remaining provinces -- La Rioja, Navarre, and the 
Canary Islands --will have to be added to the renewalists' 
tally. The members of the Federal Committee, on which Alfonso 
Guerra has succeeded in "narrowing the gap" in the balance of 
forces to a substantial extent, have also been selected in this 
process. 
<H5>  Lists Committee </H5>
  This fact assumes particular importance as regards the 
future, since it is the Federal Committee that will have to 
approve the lists committee that will designate candidates for 
the 1995 municipal and autonomous community elections, as well 
as the pacts policy to be followed by the PSOE. 
  All this makes it clear that the division in the PSOE still 
exists in a ratio that is virtually the same as that estimated 
before the 33d congress, at which the renewalists' aim of 
crushing the Guerraists was not achieved. The integration 
advocated by Gonzalez has come to nothing, and the trial of 
strength between the two sectors still exists. 
  The Guerraists are satisfied at having succeeded in "holding 
on to 42 percent," while the renewalists, although emphasizing 
the victory of holding the majority in the party, criticize 
themselves somewhat for having been unable to reduce their 
rivals to a minority.

<F P=106> [Report by Mariano Guindal: "Solbes Says Foreign Investment </F>
Grew by 10 Percent in First Quarter"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- Economy Minister Pedro Solbes stated 
yesterday that direct foreign investment in Spain grew by over 
10 percent in the first quarter of the year, as compared with 
the same period during the previous year. "This means that 
people still have confidence in Spain," and that the myth of 
disinvestment caused by the departure of some multinational 
enterprises "is neither correct nor corresponds to reality," the 
minister said. 
  In statements made to Spanish National Radio, Solbes harshly 
criticized the People's Party and United Left for denying the 
figures showing a clear start of economic recovery, "simply 
because of not acknowledging that the policy that the government 
is implementing is the correct one." According to Solbes, 
growth and job creation will be gradually consolidated until 
1,000 jobs per day are being created, which is the government's 
aim. 
  The Economics Ministry is finalizing the Plan for European 
Integration, which will be presented in Brussels in July. The 
plan contains budget projections for the next three years. 
According to these forecasts, the economy will grow by 1.3 
percent this year, 2.6 percent in 1995, and 3.5 percent in 1996. 
That is, the aim is to triple growth in three years, and this 
will make it possible to move from a zero increase in jobs to 
around 400,000 at the end of the period. 
  At the same time, the program envisions a drastic reduction 
in the public deficit, which will fall from the 6.4 percent 
forecast for the public administrations as a whole in 1994 to 
3.2 percent of GDP for the 1996-97 fiscal year. The intent is 
to achieve this reduction without increasing the individual tax 
burden. Hence, government activity will center on cutting 
public spending: Civil Service staffing will be frozen, 
transfers to state-run businesses will be reduced, transfers to 
the autonomous communities will be stabilized, and spending on 
health and unemployment will be rationalized. 
  As far as revenue is concerned, an additional increase in 
revenue is envisioned as a result of the struggle against fraud 
and the increase in consumption, profits, and employment. 
  The plan also foresees a considerable decline in inflation 
from 3.5 percent in 1994 to 2.5 percent at the end of 1997. The 
minister acknowledges that this is a very difficult aim, since 
"lowering prices from 5 percent is almost quite ambitious." 
However, he believes that it will be reduced significantly in 
the second half of the year, when food prices fall. 
  Solbes believes that the structural reforms of the labor 
market that have been begun must be completed in order to defeat 
inflation. In fact, the second part of the integration plan 
centers mainly on these reforms in order to "be on the same 
level as the soundest economies in Europe and be able to join in 
the third stage of [monetary and economic] union." 
  In the minister's opinion, it would be a very grave mistake 
for us to join in this third stage "solely for political 
reasons, and it is essential that we achieve the economic 
conditions enabling us to take that step." He told a select 
group of diplomats at the Ortega y Gasset Foundation that 
"European unity is not being built in the way that the 
government would have liked." 
<H5>  Enlargement of EU </H5>
  Solbes has publicly acknowledged that the aforementioned 
change is due to the disappearance of the East bloc countries, 
which has caused a fundamental change in the role played by 
Germany. 
  The minister publicly acknowledged that with the Community's 
enlargement, Spain's political influence in Europe has 
diminished, and the center of gravity has shifted from south to 
north. "The complexities that have developed are leading us 
toward a confederal Europe, although we would have preferred the 
federal formula." He explained that the government would have 
liked the creation of a common political area, yet it is 
increasingly clear that we are heading for a "Thatcher-style" 
economic option. 
  Pedro Solbes also acknowledged that "liberalism has 
triumphed 
over the more interventionist social democratic visions of 
Europe." The minister asked whether a process of integrating 
markets can be gotten under way without compensatory 
arrangements. In any event, he emphasized that Spain must be 
involved in the first stage, "and we are going to do everything 
possible to achieve this."

<F P=106> [Report by M. Abizanda: "Army Will Reinforce Its Rapid </F>
Action Force With Armored Vehicles"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- The Army will reinforce the Rapid Action 
Force [FAR] by including a cavalry group in this unit. Although 
it was not initially planned that the FAR would have this kind 
of unit, confining itself to light infantry forces, the 
experience of participation in the UN mission in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina has shown the feasibility of including these 
new resources. 
  The FAR's final makeup will be determined following the 
approval of the Force's mission, depending on the redeployment 
plans that are currently being drafted by the three services' 
staffs and are at their final stage of completion. With the 
document approved by the defense minister 25 January -- the new 
Strategic Concept -- it will in turn be incorporated in the 
final Joint Strategic Plan, which, according to the Defense 
Ministry's forecasts, could be approved before the summer. 
  The Army wishes to reinforce the FAR through the Master Plan 
with cavalry equipment -- especially cavalry reconnaissance 
armored vehicles -- in order to provide it with semiheavy 
equipment capable of carrying out reconnaissance missions and 
equipped with a gun of at least 25mm calibers. 
  The experience of the various battalions in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina has shown the need for these resources, to 
such an extent that it is stated in military circles that 
Operation "Alfa Bravo" has marked the rediscovery of the cavalry. 
  For this reason, the FAR will have a cavalry group 
comprising 
two groups (battalions) charged with reconnaissance and 
protection tasks. The sources consulted stated that this group 
will almost certainly have its base in Valladolid, although 
Valencia was initially chosen for its location. Two cavalry 
regiments belonging to the Jarama Brigade, destined to become at 
the most a territorial defense unit -- that is, with personnel 
not exceeding 30 percent of its potential, in accordance with 
the Master Plan -- currently have their base in Valladolid. 
  In the latest drafts of this plan it is ruled out that the 
FAMET (Army Airmobile Forces) will be completely incorporated 
into the FAR -- the main unit to be deployed in the event of a 
crisis or for participation in international missions. The 
aforementioned sources stated that only a proportion of their 
six battalions will be assigned. 
  In addition, it is confirmed that the FAR's three main units 
will be the paratroopers' brigade, the legionnaires' brigade, 
and the light airborne brigade, although some changes in their 
deployment have been envisaged. In the case of the 
legionnnaires' brigade, the idea of moving the 4th Corps from 
Ronda to the Viator base in Almeria seems to have been dropped. 
The military chiefs believe that it would be a waste to abandon 
its current facilities there. 
  In this event, only the 3d Corps in Fuerteventura will move 
to Almeria, to be joined by an artillery group as well as a 
logistical unit. Units outside the peninsula in Ceuta and 
Melilla will remain in their current locations. 
  The idea is that, within the FAR itself, the paratroopers' 
brigade and the Legion will be the initial-reaction group, while 
the airborne brigade, with bases in Galicia and Asturias, would 
be the second echelon to be deployed. 
  In addition, the FAR's staff, under the command of General 
Victor Suances, remains in charge of Operation "Alfa Bravo," 
although the Cordoba Group's units belong not to that unit but 
to the Southern Operational Command and to the brigades within 
the Reaction Force.

<F P=106> [Statement by Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel at the Bundestag </F>
in Bonn -- live] 
  [Text] Madam President, ladies and gentlemen; in about two 
weeks, 225 million European Union [EU] citizens will be invited 
to go to the polls. It must be the common aim of all democrats 
and Europeans to achieve a high turnout, a clear yes in favor of 
a strong European Parliament, a democratic Europe of 
self-confident and coresponsible citizens. [applause] For this 
reason, I would like to appeal to the voters urgently: Please 
go to the polls on 12 June to help strengthen the new Europe in 
those fields that are particularly important, that is, citizens' 
rights and its parliament. [applause] Anyone wanting a Europe 
of citizens, not a Europe of technocrats, will have to vote for 
this at the voting booth, not in the pub. Anyone wanting peace 
and prosperity for us Germans in a common European future, will 
have to vote on 12 June and make it clear that for us there is 
no return to an unfortunate, nationalist past. But above all, 
and I do not hesitate to state this clearly here in the 
Bundestag, right-wing extremism must not get a chance. 
[applause] I am saying this as your foreign minister, because I 
have to deal with the nasty picture these unfortunate happenings 
in the right-wing extremist field here in Germany have generated 
abroad. And I know what I am talking about. I was the one who 
was standing at open graves in Turkey, experiencing the 
reaction. We could take this as an example here. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, we should also state more clearly what 
we owe the EU. Or does anyone believe that the explosion of our 
prosperity, our international reputation, or our reunification 
would have been possible as it has been, if we had not been a 
member of this community of free European nations? Our exports 
to the European Economic Area increased by double the amount of 
those to the rest of the world. And there is no big industrial 
country in the world that is so dependent on one single region 
as Germany is on Europe. Most people are not aware of this. 
[applause] We are not only the biggest net payers, but also 
the biggest net exporters. And the EU welcomed our people in the 
new laender immediately and with open arms, and it will support 
them with more than 30 billion German marks [DM] until 1999. 
This is an enormous sum from the structural funds destined for 
the poorer countries in the EU. One cannot say, therefore, that 
nothing comes back from this Europe, particularly to the new 
laender. On the contrary. Let me also remind you that, due to 
their cross-border connections, a lot of money is flowing to the 
new laender from the program destined for the Central and East 
European countries. I would also like to remind you that Delors 
and other members of the European Commission have repeatedly 
gone to the new laender to see the situation there and give 
specific help with reconstruction. And please do not forget the 
share that the European countries, our partners, have 
contributed in terms of direct investment in the new laender. 
This needs to be said as well. [applause] I have just come 
back from the Baltic Sea Conference in Talinn. And I can only 
tell you that the other Central and East European countries envy 
us, and they are almost forcing their way into this community. 
Things can, therefore, not be all that bad in this Union. 
  In the new European Parliament, Germany will no longer have 
81, but 99 delegates. And for the first time -- this is all too 
easily forgotten -- the citizens in the new laender will elect 
their European Parliament members direct. And I would also like 
to say, especially in my capacity as foreign minister, it befits 
us Germans to return to this Europe that has shown us a lot of 
solidarity, some things we have received from the EU and our 
partners and friends since the end of the war. [applause] 
  This does not mean that we are supposed to play the 
paymaster. Rather, it means that we should reject going a 
special German way and bring all our weight to bear in the EU. 
More than ever, it constitutes -- all the faultfinders must not 
forget this -- the hope for the future for the peoples of the 
whole of Central and East Europe. Looking at the international 
unions, no matter whether it is the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation, NAFTA, ASEAN, or what else there is in this world 
-- by the way, unions that were also established because the 
others realized that one cannot manage any longer alone as a 
nation -- looking at these unions and the picture of Europe, at 
this EU, from the outside, we see that we are envied for this 
European Community, its capacity, and what it has brought us. I 
say it once again: This EU cannot be so bad! We should refrain 
from criticizing this union all the time in an alarmist, 
faultfinding, and defeatist way to the outside, and inside it 
and -- which needs to be said -- before the election. [applause] 
  Of course, one can and may criticize this union. There are 
undesirable developments everywhere, also in Brussels. I can 
only say that many things, but not everything can be criticized 
in this Europe. Indeed, I do so myself and I witness undesirable 
developments every day. Some things that were overdone in the 
European zeal of harmonization have to be cleared out. We 
resolutely advocate that subsidiarity really results in more 
free space for the citizens and the strengthening of the cities 
and regions. In practice, however, this cannot be achieved 
overnight. 
  However, it is quite a different matter if some blame one 
while, in reality, mean the other. It is unfortunately true 
that the rejection of European integration as a whole is 
basically hidden behind some justified individual criticism. I 
was also not very happy about the difficult course of the 
negotiations for membership of the four countries of the 
European Free Trade Association. Speaking frankly, I am 
concerned when I think about the further course in taking the 
Central and East European countries into this union. Sometimes 
one plays with fire in this respect. We do not need to go to 
Bosnia to understand this. One must be struck with blindness if 
one does not realize that after its reunification, Germany needs 
its neighbors' trust in its European way of thinking more than 
ever before. [applause] 
  Ladies and gentlemen, for the first time this country is 
only 
surrounded by friends. We are the country in the EU with the 
most neighbors. It has never been the case in our history to 
surrounded only by friends. However, I also tell you that he 
who wants friends has to cultivate friends. [applause] 
  Here our special relationship with France is very important. 
It is not only the driving force behind the work of European 
unification. It is, so to speak, the pledge of what Thomas Mann 
called a European Germany. We do not want to exchange all that 
again for a twisted course that some are propagating and that 
would inevitably result again in alliances and counteralliances 
in Europe. It is the priority foreign policy task of reunified 
Germany to prevent this, because one can say one thing without 
presumption: A joint European house, which we so much like to 
talk about, can only be developed with vigorous German support. 
If there is an outstanding German responsibility to history 
after the fulfillment of our national dream, it is the 
responsibility for this structure. 
  Mr. Scharping, your criticism that we do not consistently 
advocate Delors' White Paper is simply wrong. Yes, you are, of 
course, right that the creation of jobs is at issue. However, 
because of my daily exertion, I can only tell you that we are 
really making great efforts to help translate exactly Delors' 
White Paper into reality. With the European action plan for 
growth and development, we have set the course for the creation 
of 17 million jobs in Europe by 2000 and it will be at the top 
of our agenda for the European presidency. You know exactly 
that what we need is Europe's new competitiveness in the world. 
But what we do not need are the investment programs out of 
yesterday's rag-bag because investments have to pay off and be 
privately financed. We do not want a state economy. With a 
view to what you have said, Mr. Scharping, I also ask you, of 
course: Who continues to oppose the privatization of large 
sectors of our economy? Who is calling all the time for state 
spending programs? Who is inhibiting investments here and in 
Europe? At any rate, it is not us. I think that this was 
rightly pointed out before. The criticism that we do not feel 
bound to the social market economy is wrong. For what other 
reason did the FRG Government so massively advocate the social 
protocol for the Maastricht Treaty? We do not accept these 
reproaches! [applause] 
  Ladies and gentlemen; Germany will take over the EU 
Presidency in over a month. France will succeed us. In more 
than 20 working meetings of a special working group, French 
Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and I have prepared what we intend 
to carry out jointly within a year of the troika. I think it is 
a good opportunity for us to have a chance to work together for 
a year. It is a good situation, and it is very important for 
our presidency to prepare the course to be pursued until the 
review conference in 1996. 
  Much of what is disputed among member states must be solved 
in Franco-German cooperation, and it must be solved in a way 
that is acceptable for all member states. It is a stroke of 
luck for both nations and for the whole of Europe that we have 
this close partnership. The France-German relationship must and 
will be the driving force of European integration. [applause] 
  What will be the points on which our presidency will be 
focused? First, 17 million unemployed in Europe are a problem 
that overshadows everything else. So economic growth must be 
achieved and new competitive jobs must be created. We will do 
everything in our power to push things in Europe and in our 
country. There is a ray of light and hope regarding economic 
recovery not only in Germany, but also in a number of other 
European countries. 
  The second point on which the German presidency will be 
focused will be ensuring peace, prosperity, and stability on the 
whole continent. With the European Parliament giving the 
go-ahead for the accession of Austria, Sweden, Finland, and 
Norway, the way has been paved for a larger core Europe, which 
will be able to resolutely cope with the completion of European 
integration. German and European interests cannot be divided in 
this respect. [applause] 
  Neither we nor our West European partners can in the long 
run 
be well off, if our European neighbors in the East are badly 
off. The EU's ostpolitik until the turn of the millennium must 
be based on this realization. Germany will remain an advocate 
of European, not West European, thought. This will be the 
central task of German foreign policy in the coming years. 
[applause] 
  Third, the strengthening of cooperation in internal and 
justice policy will be a touchstone of whether our citizens see 
the EU in connection with drugs and organized crime or as a gain 
in personal and professional chances in life. It is 
unacceptable that international drug traffickers and money 
launderers should be more successful than the police. 
  We must combat international crime effectively, meaning 
beyond the borders and within the European framework. If we do 
not want to lose the people's support for our Europe policy, we 
need to have concrete progress in the development of Europol and 
a common asylum, refugee, and immigration policy. 
  But, ladies and gentlemen, speaking about internal security, 
I must tell you that there is something that increasingly annoys 
me. I am annoyed at the fact that the impression has been 
created time and again that the problems we have in this area 
could be solved through the easy way of new laws. This holds 
true for the FRG and Europe. We must tell the people that this 
is the wrong conclusion. I am also annoyed at the fact that the 
impression has been created that the Federal Government, with 
its ministers and the federal chancellor, are primarily 
responsible for combating crime in this country. 
  I want to stress -- and I say so in view of my former 
activities -- that it is primarily the laender that are 
responsible for combating crime in this country, namely, the 
minister-presidents and the interior and justice ministers. 
[applause] It has relatively little to do with the legislative 
work of the federal government, but it is a problem of practical 
police work. [shouts] Yes, parliament is responsible for the 
laws, but the land parliaments are also responsible, and not 
just the Bundestag. 
  Ladies and gentlemen; in Europe today, German interests, 
like 
French, Italian, or British interests, are intertwined 
interests. We will serve them best by bringing them in line with 
those of our partners. We will be guided by this principle in 
our presidency. I tell you, Germany will be closely watched as 
to how it will carry out this first presidency for the old and 
new federal laender on behalf of Germany. 
  We must work very hard, and I promise we will do everything 
in our power to represent our country well to the outside world, 
and we will work to advance Europe. [applause]

<F P=106> ["UM/mdl."-attributed report: "Somber Prospects for Russia"] </F>
  [Text] Halle/Berlin -- Boris Yeltsin's announcements that 
he will order Russia's upswing by decree meets with skepticism 
among the economic research institutes. "This fits into the 
longstanding practice of constantly changing the tax laws," the 
German Economic Research Institute (DIW) in Berlin says. The 
fact that Russia is not making progress is primarily due to the 
failed economic policy. All positive approaches are 
"overcompensated for by escalating misdevelopments in central 
fields of economic policy." The forecasts for an economic 
upswing are, therefore, extremely restrained. Despite the 
speedy reduction of corporate taxes, there is no sufficient 
security for investors in Russia. One can hardly see any 
progress in the necessary restructuring of the Russian economy. 
The liberalization of export quotas, which has now been 
promised, is only patchwork, too, because, in the view of the 
DIW experts, all energy exports -- the main source of foreign 
currency -- are not affected by it. 
  The research institutes DIW (Berlin), IWH [Halle Economic 
Research Institute] (Halle), and IW [Institute of German 
Economics] (Kiel) have listed the consequences that Russia is 
facing because of that. Their devastating assessment of the 
situation: Indications are accumulating that mass unemployment 
is unavoidable. 
  The joint expert report judges Moscow's policy harshly. Even 
though one can still notice "reform rhetoric," in reality there 
is "no strength for the necessary structural change." The lack 
of concepts of those who guide the economy can be seen in the 
overall economic data. Thus, in 1993 the GDP declined by 12 
percent, after it had gone down by double-digit rates during 
each of the three previous years. With a drop of 16 percent 
(1992: minus 18 percent), industrial production is hit 
particularly. 
  The authors of the report criticize the fact that, 
nevertheless, private consumption increased slightly last year. 
Looking at the overall economy, one cannot speak of a decline 
in the standard of living at all. Given the collapse of the 
economic performance, the unchanged level of consumption 
logically leads to a decline in investments (most recently minus 
15 percent). This expresses an "avoidance of structural 
change." The same goes for the labor market. There, the 
unemployment rate of 5 percent does not adequately reflect the 
obsolete structures. 
  The report describes the financial markets as completely 
insufficient. The defects are the result of marked neglect in 
terms of order policy. The financial system is abused to 
preserve inefficient structures. One consequence: The illegal 
export of capital, which was estimated at at least $15 billion 
last year. At the end of 1993, foreign debts amounted to $80 
billion.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hans-Ulrich Klose, chairman of the SPD </F>
Bundestag group, by Rolf Kleine: "Is the SPD a Bad Loser, Mr. 
Klose?"] 
  [Text] [Kleine] Roman Herzog achieved a convincing 
victory in the presidential election. Why is the Social 
Democratic Party [SPD] continuing its criticism? Are the Social 
Democrats bad losers? 
  [Klose] No. The new federal president has been 
democratically elected. The discussion must now end even though 
our candidate has lost. We will cooperate loyally with the new 
president. The SPD respects the result. It reflects the 
current situation of political forces, which we have to change 
in the upcoming election. That is all. 
  [Kleine] Nevertheless, the leading SPD officials continue to 
criticize the electoral process and Roman Herzog.... 
  [Klose] We should stop it. Even though there was some 
irritation after the speech of the future president, we must now 
stop criticism. Our political opponent is Helmut Kohl and not 
Roman Herzog. 
  [Kleine] Was the SPD not too sure that its candidate would 
win the election? 
  [Klose] Due to the majority situation I was always convinced 
that we would have a fair chance as an outsider -- but not more. 
  [Kleine] SPD Chairman Scharping regards the Free Democratic 
Party [FDP] as superfluous after its recent behavior in the 
federal convention. Does this end the speculation about an 
SPD-FDP coalition after the Bundestag election? 
  [Klose] Scharping meant that in a political sense -- and he 
was being polemical. Of course we were upset about the FDP's 
behavior. Yet the next elections have to show how much the FDP 
is worth. Right now, the FDP is not in a good shape, it is a 
political lightweight. 
  [Kleine] Herzog was hardly elected when voices were raised 
in the SPD calling for a direct election of the president. Does 
the SPD now really want to change the electoral procedure? 
  [Klose] No. We will not simply change a longstanding SPD 
position two days after the election. The discussion was a 
result of the initial, understandable disappointment about the 
defeat. 
  [Kleine] The Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian 
Social Union [CSU] now has the right to nominate a new judge to 
the Federal Constitutional Court as a successor to Roman Herzog, 
and the SPD has to agree. Will you now pay back the CDU for its 
rejection of Herta Daeubler-Gmelin last year? 
  [Klose] The CDU/CSU will indeed have to ask the SPD's 
support for its candidate. We had to experience the same last 
year the other way round. In the past the CDU/CSU did not 
always accept each candidate, and we will not do so, either.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Too Much at the Restaurant Table"] </F>
  [Text] For the mayor's election in Woelfersheim in Hesse, 
the parties were offered -- without making any efforts -- a 
forum close to the citizens. At the beginning of the year, the 
local newspapers invited the local candidates of the Christian 
Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU], the Social 
Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], and the Free Democratic Party 
of Germany [FDP] for a discussion. The offer fit into the 
political trend; the dialogue with the citizens is concurrently 
recommended by politicians as an "expression of democratic 
culture." 
  In Woelfersheim, however, the dialogue became deadlocked and 
SPD politician Joachim Arnold canceled his appearance. The 
reason: The candidate of the NPD [National Democratic Party of 
Germany] was not invited, which would have turned him into a 
martyr. 
  The obvious solution, namely to invite the NPD man after 
all, 
was also rejected by Arnold. This would elevate the reputation 
of the right-wing extremist, argued the SPD candidate, who was 
later elected mayor. The FDP colleague was undecided and the 
CDU candidate would have had to hold a discussion with himself. 
The discussion was canceled. 
  Woelfersheim is everywhere. From the local associations to 
the Bonn party leaderships, the democratic politicians disagree 
among each other and among themselves about how they should deal 
with right-wing extremists. The result: They are not talking 
to them at all. 
  Only with great difficulty do politicians manage to hide 
their speechlessness in view of outbreaks of right-wing 
extremist violence as in Magdeburg or antisemitic attacks behind 
empty formulas and excuses. Germany is burning and the 
Constitutional Protection Offices and internal affairs experts 
are warning against new attacks, but politicians and policemen 
are helpless against the terrorist actions of groups of rightist 
brawlers. 
  A ghastly parallel is obvious: "It is as in the worst times 
of the SA [Nazi storm troopers]," Cornelia Schmalz-Jacobsen 
(FDP), Bonn's commissioner for foreigners, says. 
  There would have been time to take precautions. However, the 
old parties in Bonn did not use the years of hate campaigns by 
the rightists against asylum-seekers to deal jointly with the 
instigators. Instead, they used the instigation against 
foreigners as an opportunity to quarrel for years about 
restrictions to the right to asylum. 
  "Asylum-seekers' party" then-CDU Secretary General Volker 
Ruehe called the SPD, which had political problems with keeping 
persecuted foreigners out. 
  The SPD headquarters in Bonn had already presented five 
years 
ago "recommendations for dealing with the extreme Right"; the 
title: "Neither Playing Down nor Demonizing." The demand for 
"confrontation by means of arguments," because Social Democrats 
must not "back down to the Republikaner," was repeated last year 
in the "SPD 2000" reform commission. However, the "active 
dealing" (planning official Malte Ristau) with the issue is 
still missing after the many changes in leadership. 
  "The debate among the people's parties," Heidelberg 
education 
expert Micha Brumlik criticizes, has had the effect of "a mock 
fight for the benefit of the rightist populists." Because 
"young men, who tend toward violence anyway," are confirmed in 
their attitude, according to Brumlik, if politicians play up the 
asylum issue and, thus, are chiming in with the voters at the 
right fringe just to complain about the evil rightist spirit 
afterwards. The parties cannot "switch xenophobic emotions off 
and on like a lamp" (Brumlik) without consequences. 
  "The politicians should think more thoroughly about what 
they 
say and do," confirms Ingo Hasselbach, 26, former chairman of 
the East Berlin right-wing extremist National Alternative, who 
has left the neo-Nazi scene. 
  Hasselbach, the son of SED [Socialist Unity Party of 
Germany] 
journalists, who had slid into GDR neo-Nazi circles because of 
conflicts with his family, went underground last year after his 
former comrades tried to kill him. "If it is said again and 
again that the number of foreigners should be limited," he says 
now, some people might understand this as a justification for 
the attacks. 
  The attitude of the parties is characterized by election 
tactics. Munich political scientist Elmar Wiesendahl, 48, says 
that while "the seriousness of the situation indicates that the 
preservation of democratic basic values and human rights" is at 
stake, the political style continues to be characterized by 
"rivalry, tactics, and unfairness" -- "a strange atrophy of view 
and sensitivity in dealing with social challenges." 
  Even more fatal is the fact that politicians hardly counter 
even violent right-wing extremists with a militant spirit, that 
they do not spontaneously show feeling for their fellow citizens 
and compassion for the victims. Hamburg sociologist Ulrich 
Bielefeld angrily noted that politicians "do not sit too little 
but too much at the proverbial `restaurant tables.'" What would 
be needed at least as much as political arguments is personal 
dedication and a credible example. 
  The conflict with right-wing extremism is repugnant to the 
classical understanding of politics because it is basically a 
unpolitical, highly irrational movement. The opponents are so 
difficult to pin down because they do not have any clear 
political goals apart from the destruction of democracy. The 
ultimate wisdom of the neo-Nazis is, as in the past, the 
"fuehrer principle" -- so far only within the close-knit 
individual groups. However, their interlacement in a network 
has already started. 
  The weakness of rightist fanatics "to say what they stand 
for" is described in a documentation of the Duessledorf Interior 
Ministry on right-wing extremist agitation, which was presented 
in the spring. It reflects the "lack of program of the 
right-wing extremists," whose "political passions" are nurtured 
by vague enthusiasm for the Nazis and "the belief in the 
superiority of the German virtues," the study says. 
  The paradoxical fact that right-wing extremists are fighting 
brutally for their convictions without knowing what they 
actually want distinguishes them from other ideologies that are 
supported by social theories, such as Marxism. Therefore, 
sociologists Erwin K. Scheuch and Hans-Dieter Klingemann in the 
past presented the theory of a "special development" of the 
intellectual history of the radical Right, which proceeds from 
everyday stress in modern life. 
  The 1967 study, which has again become topical after such a 
long time, stresses two elements of the extremist danger: 
  -- From this viewpoint, "rigidity in thinking" is the result 
of social contradictions -- for example, tensions between 
traditional upbringing and modern industrial society, between a 
family's everyday life and the company, authorities, politics. 
The flight of confused people into a rigid system of values, 
which promises relief of internal tensions, excludes other 
systems of values as "hostile" -- a "pathological form of this 
kind of thinking." 
  -- Susceptibility of thinking results from the superficial 
political interest of many people, "for whom politics is only 
one special field." Intensified by individual or collective 
crises, individual right-wing extremist topics affect the 
awareness of "unarticulated ideas" of political life as -- often 
emotional -- "temptations." 
  Particularly susceptible to such temptations are children 
and 
young people, which is shown in the difficult situation of 
upheaval after unification. Their problems of adjustment result 
from the increased contradictions between individual hopes and a 
sad reality. 
  This has been realized by social pedagogic experts who want 
to gain trust and influence on young people through personal 
close contacts. 
  How "strenuous and exhausting" such contacts are was 
experienced by Bielefeld education scientist Klaus Hurrelmann in 
discussions with skinheads. In contrast to blocked rightist 
ideologists, one could at least talk to them. However, 
Hurrelmann admitted that he did not get the feeling that "any 
kind of consensus was achieved," even though the skins "had 
declared their readiness to talk within the framework of a 
research project," the youth researcher says. 
  Such projects are risky. This was learned by Marita 
Schieferdecker-Adolph, the commissioner for foreigners in 
Dresden. Last year, she took 19 youths, including right-wing 
extremist group functionaries, on a pedagogical trip to Israel, 
where some participants engaged in provocative behavior. 
However, the official is convinced that the attitude of some 
participants has indeed changed as a result. 
  Politics could effectively support the initiatives at the 
local and institutional level, which are often difficult to 
predict -- here the term of a state-supporting task really has a 
point. What is needed is a change in the political trend: 
steadfastness instead of populism, talking about the situation 
in Germany instead of stubborn silence. 
  Similar insights are sprouting in some politicians. Former 
SPD Federal Manager Peter Glotz calls for dealing actively with 
right-wing radicals, such as German Franz Schoenhuber, Austrian 
Joerg Haider, or French Alain de Benoist. 
  In "large debates," politicians like Schoenhuber "must be 
refuted by democratic politicians with the better arguments," 
Glotz demands. A "culture of political controversy" deserves its 
name only if it denies the enemies of democracy their influence. 
However, this is precisely what is missing: Instead of a 
culture of debate, there are only "tricks of mere symbolic 
policy." 
  Once before, after the arson attacks in Moelln, it seemed 
possible to break through the paralysis of public debate. 
Millions of protesting citizens gathered for chains of lights 
in the large cities. 
  The catchword of personal courage, of the citizens' 
interference in politics, was discovered anew at that time. 
President Richard von Weizsaecker has now again called for more 
personal courage after the riots in Magdeburg. However, the 
attempt to change the political culture from below has failed 
for the time being because of the political speechlessness from 
above. 
  In addition, one cannot counter a hard core of convinced 
militant Nazis with the cities' courage alone. Ex-Nazi 
Hasselbach says that any attempts to convince them will 
certainly bounce off such people. 
  In Hasselbach's view, democratic attempts at dissuading them 
should start, in particular, with the "endangered and still weak 
youths, potential violent criminals at the age between 13 an 
18," an age "where a democratic basic attitude without a 
inclination toward violence could still be achieved in many of 
them." However, only tough punishment helps against the 
leaders, the former Nazi thinks. 
  More teachers and criminologists resign themselves to the 
idea that counterviolence is the only language that is still 
understood by the ideologists, who are fanatically committed to 
violence. Through pressure of prosecution and the risk of being 
sentenced, they must be urged at least to do without open 
violence. Right-wing extremist thinking does not rule out 
"flexibility" and adjustment to the "requirements of everyday 
life," Scheuch and Klingemann say. 
  The message of the researchers is that the open industrial 
society can live with a group of crazies -- as long as they do 
not set buildings on fire.

<F P=106> ["Hz."-signed report: "To Jointly Combat Extremists"] </F>
  [Text] Magdeburg -- The new justice and interior ministers 
of the new laender want to cooperate to a greater extent than 
before in combating extremist violence from the Right and the 
Left, as well as organized and cross-border crime. A ministers 
conference in Magdeburg resolved on Wednesday [25 May] to 
counteract above all extreme-right violence by an increased 
exchange of information and experiences. New strategies to 
combat small extremist groups are to be jointly developed and 
evaluated. The exchange of preventive concepts is to provide 
better protection of foreigners' accommodations and 
asylum-seekers' homes. 
  The Magdeburg decision further says: The ministers "state 
their firm intention to deepen their cooperation in the 
prevention and prosecution of violent extremist criminals and 
violent criminal acts and to fully support each other mutually, 
particularly in the prevention of prepared actions or marches of 
extremist organizations." 
  Regarding cross-border crime, the conference called on the 
German Government to specify and supplement the existing and 
planned treaties with Poland and the Czech Republic. Direct 
political cooperation at the border and mutual legal assistance 
have to be facilitated and all official processes to be 
shortened. 
  Because of early signs of organized crime in the new laender 
alone, the ministers think that it is necessary "to take 
consistent action with joint strategies involving more than one 
land." In general, information and experiences also have to be 
intensively exchanged here. The public prosecutor's offices 
should be consulted in joint official meetings of police and 
customs authorities. 
  The ministers expressed concern about the different 
conclusions from the "hashish ruling" of the Federal 
Constitutional Court in the old laender. A liberalization of 
the narcotics law must be prevented as far as possible. In the 
assessment of the possession of small amounts of the drug, each 
individual case has to be examined by all means, it was stated. 
On no account must one refrain from punishment if drugs are 
consumed in schools, recreational facilities for young people, 
barracks, or other facilities where young people and children 
stay. The possession of hard drugs has to be prosecuted in any 
case. The point is to "ensure that the scourge of drugs is 
averted from the new laender," Saxony-Anhalt Interior and 
Justice Minister Walter Remmers (Christian Democratic Union) 
said.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- In the fight against right-wing 
extremism in Germany Interior Minister Manfred Kanther 
(Christian Democratic Union) intends to take greater action also 
against denials of the Third Reich's responsibility for the war 
and its atrocities. Kanther underlined today, at the 5th 
German-Jewish dialogue in Koenigswinter near Bonn, that those 
"suppressing" and "playing down" the Holocaust have to be "put 
in their place." The state must not leave it only to "major 
films and television series" to inform people and make them 
aware of German history. 
  The interior minister pointed out that the right-wing 
extremists in Germany are increasingly stirring up antisemitism 
and revisionism. Their agitation is having an effect. For 
example, instances of cemeteries being desecrated are 
continuing. Attacks on people motivated by anti-Semitism are 
also a cause for concern. 
  Kanther added that 2,232 right-wing extremist acts of 
violence were committed last year alone. Of these, 1,609 were 
xenophobic and 72 antisemitic. Overall, the number of 
antisemitic offenses rose from 562 in 1992 to 656 in 1993. 
Initial findings show that this trend is continuing in 1994, 
too. Greater efforts will therefore have to be made to combat 
this. Overall there are potentially about 8,000 people who 
"openly admit to being antisemitic". 
  The interior minister announced that the fight against 
right-wing extremism will be intensified further. The state and 
society have to take all possible steps against these "sometimes 
inhumane acts", specifically through "repressive and preventive 
measures." Possible gaps in the law have to be closed. 
  Kanther stressed that the Office for the Protection of the 
Constitution is currently conducting "extensive" investigations 
into the right-wing extremist republicans. Any further action 
against this party will depend on the results. At any event, 
incorrigible agitation and violence have to be "rigorously 
banned and punished under the law."

<F P=106> [Article by Martin Kessler and Dorothea Siems: "React </F>
Flexibly--Government and Business Join Ranks in Foreign 
Trade--Germany's Exporters Remain Skeptical"] 
  [Text] Hans Messer, former head of the Frankfurt family 
enterprise Messer Griesheim, on his most recent trip to Hungary 
had originally planned only to drop in briefly to see German 
Ambassador Otto-Raban Heinichen. He stayed longer than planned. 
  In no time at all, the head of the diplomatic mission had 
called important ministry officials and managers. The chairman 
of the foreign trade commission of the German Association of 
Chambers of Commerce (DIHT) met them the very next day. 
According to Messer, a year ago such a prompt response "would 
have been unthinkable." 
  This exceptional service is soon to become the rule. The 
chancellor and ministers, diplomats and association 
representatives, all want to help the shaken German export 
industry. While formerly the entrepreneurs of the Federal 
Republic were "always individual fighters," as Tarun Das, chief 
of the Indian Industry Association, recalls, "they now regularly 
bring along their politicians." Only rarely does a firm from 
Germany still risk the leap into a new foreign market. 
  Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt says that politicians 
must 
"actively support" German enterprises in conquering foreign 
markets. According to Helmut Kohl's chief economist, promoting 
the export industry will be at "the very top of the priority 
list" until the end of the legislative period. 
  The days are past when German politicians displayed a noble 
reserve and praised the advantages of free trade at 
international conferences. In the future, says Rainer Haungs, 
the economic spokesman of the CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic 
Union/Christian Social Union] parliamentary caucus, who himself 
has a medium-sized business, the government and associations 
"will interfere more than previously." Ludolf-Georg von 
Wartenberg, chief manager of the Federal Association of German 
Industry (BDI), summarizes the new trend, where worldwide 
competition by enterprises has long been supplanted "by 
competition of nations." 
  The secret model: the Japanese. They have always 
concentrated 
on concerted action in foreign trade. As Japan researcher 
Hanns-Guenther Hilpert of the Munich Ifo-Institute for Economic 
Research found out, Tokyo has very purposefully "supported" 
expansion of Japanese enterprises "in the growth markets in 
Southeast Asia." The result: In 1993, Japan achieved an export 
surplus of $56 billion in trade with its neighbors--more than 
with the United States. By contrast, Germany's share in global 
exports dropped from 11.3 to 10.2 percent in the past years. In 
the booming developing countries of Southeast Asia alone, the 
Japanese invested 58 billion German marks [DM] per year, the 
Germans a mere DM2 billion. 
  German corporation managers are alarmed that all trading 
nations are meanwhile re-arming. U.S. President Bill Clinton 
only recently declared exports to be the most important goal of 
foreign policy. As an internal strategy paper of the U.S. 
Department of Commerce states, "we have had good experiences due 
to aggressive government support." 
  Now the Germans want those, too. They promote foreign 
[trade] 
fairs, establish joint offices and trade centers--and travel. 
Above all, travel. 
  Last year, Rexrodt twice visited the People's Republic of 
China. Chancellor Helmut Kohl added to his Japan trip a quick 
visit to South Korea. And even Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and 
his colleague in the Environmental Ministry, Klaus Toepfer, 
promoted German enterprises abroad: Kinkel in the rising Vietnam 
market, and Toepfer during a visit to the former trade hub of 
the Near East, Lebanon. 
  Bonn also intends to support the export industry 
financially, 
much more so than to date. Thus Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl 
assured industry of support for the Asia-Pacific Commission of 
German Industry (APA) established last year. 
  As it did recently at the first international conference in 
Bangkok, APA is looking for new ways to improve the presence of 
Germans in the world's Number One growth market. Under the aegis 
of the land-owned Suedwestdeutsche Landesbank (SuedwestLB), in 
the spring of 1995 a German House will open its doors in 
Singapore, and will not only provide consultation and contacts 
to medium-sized businesses, but also offices and machine shops. 
  This new Bonn activity is surely important, and the many 
travels, congresses, and seminars are well-meant. But it is not 
yet certain by far whether the new joining of ranks between 
politics and industry will be successful. German export policy 
is still lacking sensible financing tools, and the laender are 
often competing with each other beyond the German borders. The 
enterprises themselves must "recognize their opportunities," 
says Otto Graf Lambsdorff, FDP [Free Democratic Party] economics 
spokesman. Although political pressure is appropriate, it cannot 
substitute for the lack of competitiveness. 
  The government's new activism is not even well-received by 
the enterprises. After the recent flops on large orders, such as 
those of the ICE [Intercity Express] consortium in Texas and 
South Korea and of Dasa in refurbishing the Saudi airfleet, 
German enterprises continue to feel left in the lurch, despite 
all the chancellor's and ministers' travels. An exclusive poll 
by the Ifo-Institute among 704 enterprises and managers for 
WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE showed that over half of industrial enterprises 
have a low opinion of the Federal Government's foreign trade 
policy. 
  German enterprises, be they medium-sized or on the top floor 
of German industry, demand of the government, above all, better 
financing conditions. Of the top managers polled by the 
Ifo-Institute, 70 percent plead for interest subsidies when it 
concerns the new markets in East Asia, Latin America, and India. 
  How it could work in the future was demonstrated by Siemens 
with the subway order in Canton, China. The electric/electronics 
corporation procured for its partners, short of foreign 
exchange, a loan financed half and half with German budget funds 
and via the capital market. Siemens now hopes for similarly 
favorable financing in the race for expansion of the commuter 
transport system in Shanghai. 
  Siemens managers calculate that--if low interest rates 
continue--the German export industry in 1994 alone could finance 
orders worth DM1.5 billion with cheap development aid credits. 
Upshot of the calculations: "That has a stimulating effect on 
the employment situation." 
  True, Minister Rexrodt rejects the close linking of 
development aid to export orders and hence refuses his approval 
of respective industry applications. But pressure from industry 
is growing. The top corporations are annoyed that countries such 
as Japan and France support their exporters with much more 
generous credit assistance. 
  Not only large enterprises feel the subsidy race. For 
example, a North Rhine-Westphalian machine builder had no chance 
in China with an order worth 23 million [as published] because 
the Dutch competition could offer it at half the price. The 
reason: The Chinese received 45 percent of the export value as a 
present, in the form of development aid. 
  Small businesses in particular suffer abroad from the darker 
sides of German federalism. The land rulers and their economics 
ministers not only compete with Kohl and Rexrodt, but also fight 
each other fiercely. 
  Just recently, Bavaria presented itself at the technology 
fair in Bangkok as the 13th largest export country of the world. 
Baden-Wuerttemberg's Minister President Erwin Teufel traveled 
with over 100 enterprise representatives to China--no Western 
visitor before him had ever taken along that many. Even 
Saarland's Finance Minister Hans Kasper went on a selling tour 
in the People's Republic and garnered orders worth millions for 
Saarland enterprises. Especially piquant: The Saarberg 
subsidiary Interplan, and the mining subcontractors Walter 
Becker and Preinfalk not only beat out the Japanese, but also 
the competition from North Rhine-Westphalia. 
  Such particularism, argue the members of the Asia-Pacific 
Commission of German Industry heatedly, must finally stop. In 
the future, the activity of the Federal Government, laender, and 
industry must "be bundled and implemented purposefully." 
  And if at times it does not work out, as with ICE, says 
Johannes von Thadden, head of the foreign trade chambers at 
DIHT, then "we will react quite flexibly." Since TGV has been 
beating ICE in many markets, the German Foreign Trade Chamber 
organizes purchasing seminars in Paris with the French 
manufacturer--so that German enterprises at least have a chance 
as ancillary suppliers.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Josef Joffe: "Russia -- Partner and Risk"] </F>
  [Text] Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev was not an 
easy visitor for NATO but a dilemma personified. Russia is the 
joker in the European balance of forces. Formerly, in the Cold 
War, it was Russia's power that burdened Europe; now it is its 
weakness and inner conflicts. However, no matter whether it is 
strong or weak -- Russia was and remains a factor of uncertainty. 
  Ironically, the West had an easier time in the past. No 
matter whether politics was marked by containment or detente -- 
its huge military potential made the Soviet Union the enemy, and 
every alliance planning was oriented by it. In the course of 
its history, NATO has wracked its brain over many other problems 
-- the pranks played by Charles de Gaulle or the dictatorship of 
the Greek colonels. However, what remained at the end of the 
day was always the same -- the classical problem of the balance. 
How to deter the Soviet Union or how to defend oneself against 
it if deterrence were to fail? 
  The problem now is that the Soviet Union has committed 
suicide and abandoned communism, is experimenting with the 
market economy and democracy, withdraws its troops from Germany 
1,500 km to the East, and removes approximately 2,000 warheads 
from its nuclear arsenals every year? Every reasonable person 
must want to see this process completed smoothly and end happily. 
  However, the harvest is not yet saved; there are still a lot 
of ill weeds in the furrows. One problem is the chauvinists who 
believe the country is surrounded by old and new enemies 
intending to trouble and humiliate the country. Another problem 
is the classical symptoms of a society that is caught between 
the past and the future -- attempted coups and the growing gap 
between profiteers and losers of the change. One seed that is 
not bearing fruit is the economic reform. The production 
decrease of 25 percent that was reported recently shows a 
declining economic sector. "Weimar-Russia"? The idea no longer 
is as absurd as it was two or three years ago. 
  The West does not have the power and ability to modernize 
Russia from outside. In foreign policy, a dilemma has developed 
for the West that was dramatized by Grachev's appearance at the 
NATO meeting. Russia has insisted on a special role on the 
European stage, which, at a closer look, shows fatal parallels 
with the attitude of the old Soviet Union. During the Cold War, 
Moscow always claimed a veto on the West's security policy. At 
first, Moscow did not want the West Germans to be rearmed, then 
it did not want NATO to be equipped with intermediate-range 
missiles. Today, the alliance cannot bomb Bosnia without 
specific permission from Moscow or take those Eastern European 
countries under its wings that wish to associate with NATO. 
  "Special status" is the magic formula used by Grachev and 
Yeltsin when they talk with NATO. Even if Grachev after an 
unexpected turn suddenly accepts the "Partnership for Peace" 
program "without any condition," Moscow wants to be "more equal" 
than the Eastern Europeans, and behind this is the old claim to 
the guaranteed role of big power. NATO will have to consider 
this carefully if it wants to remain a functioning alliance and 
does not want to leave the new democracies on the other side of 
the Elbe river in a drafty "Central Europe." 
  Cooperate with Russia, protect Yeltsin against his 
troublemakers at home? Yes, in any case. Open the door for 
Russia to the G-7 club of the rich industrial nations? Logic 
seems to forbid this because it would be tantamount to taking in 
the bankrupt into the group of creditors. Channel Moscow into 
NATO past the Poles, Czechs, and Hungarians? That would mean 
degrading those who are worthy of protection and privileging the 
country they fear. 
  What basically holds true is this: Diplomacy can and even 
must cover up dilemmas by all sorts of compromise formulas; its 
principle is the "both...and" formula. But in the end, there is 
still the threatening "either...or" principle. If Russia does 
in fact become a NATO member, this will be the end of the 
alliance. It may still be called "NATO," but it would be 
nothing but a mini-CSCE, a rather noncommittal association open 
to all sides and incapable of making tough decisions. 
  In Brussels, the Americans and the British have apparently 
held their own against the Germans and Spaniards who wanted to 
give the Russians ("a big power," according to German Defense 
Minister Volker Ruehe) more shining epaulets. This is better 
for NATO and better for the Eastern Central Europeans who are 
Germany's direct neighbors and do not need any discrimination 
for the benefit of Moscow. There are other means to satisfy 
Russia's status requirements, and the alliance does not have to 
give up its old identity. There are enough problems for Russia 
to demonstrate its role as a responsible big power -- in Bosnia 
or in the struggle against the spreading of weapons of mass 
destruction. Binding Russia by all sorts of measures is a 
long-term dictate of every Western policy. However, Russia's 
unpredictability and potential strength make the country not 
only a partner but also a certain risk in the wake of the Cold 
War.

  [Text] Paris, May 26 (AFP) -- Twelve percent of French 
voters would back a "Sarajevo" list of candidates protesting 
against Western policy over Bosnia if the group carries out its 
threat to stand in next month's European elections, a poll 
showed. 
  The survey by pollsters IPSOS showed 12 percent would back 
the "Europe begins at Sarajevo" list in the June 12 elections to 
the European parliament. The poll is to be published in the 
Saturday edition of the weekly LE POINT. 
  French intellectuals led by journalist and writer 
Bernard-Henri Levy have warned they will present the Sarajevo 
list if the political establishment fails to embark on a 
"ethical about-face" to place the Bosnian capital "at the heart 
of Europe." 
  According to the survey, all major French parties barring 
the 
extreme right National Front would lose votes if the threat is 
carried out. 
  The group says five conditions must be fulfilled if the 
"Sarajevo" candidates are to back down prior to the May 27 
closing date for registrations. 
  These include lifting the arms embargo to former Yugoslavia 
in favour of Bosnian Government forces -- which both France and 
Britain said Thursday they opposed -- and withdrawing a European 
plan earmarking 51 percent of the republic for the new 
Moslem-Croat federation and 49 percent for the Bosnian Serbs. 
  The IPSOS survey was carried out between May 19 and 24 among 
a representative sample of 1,000 French voters.

  [Text] In the absence of a major government or 
parliamentary initiative, the "Europe begins at Sarajevo" list 
will be submitted to the Interior Ministry on Friday. Leon 
Schwarzenberg, its leader, confirmed that yesterday. However, 
some of the intellectuals who support this list are wondering 
about the need to maintain it after Michel Rocard's statements. 
For instance, Bernard-Henri Levy thinks that in advocating the 
lifting of the embargo on arms supplies, the PSF [French 
Socialist Party] first secretary has "committed his list." 
Laurent Fabius, his predecessor as head of the PSF, expressed 
his agreement with Mr. Rocard's position, explaining that he had 
"taken a position on this basis" since August 1992. 
  On the other hand, Philippe Vasseur, secretary general of 
the 
PR [Republican Party], thinks that Dominique Baudis, leader of 
the UDF-RPR [Union for French Democracy-Rally for the Republic] 
list, "demonstrated a calm attitude" by refusing to give way to 
"a media event" in favor of lifting the embargo on arms supplies 
to Bosnia. Pierre Lellouche, RPR deputy for Val-d'Oise and 
Jacques Chirac's diplomatic adviser, also spoke out against 
lifting the embargo, adding that Bernard-Henri Levy "is not 
Malraux." Jacques Barrot, centrist vice president of the UDF 
group in the National Assembly, said that "giving way to emotion 
and trying to lift the embargo on arms sales to Bosnia would 
amount to making a threefold mistake," namely burying the hope 
of peace, creating a terrible spiral, and making an admission of 
weakness. Finally, PCF [French Communist Party] National 
Secretary Robert Hue also stated his opposition to the lifting 
of the embargo.

  [Text] Paris, May 27 (AFP) -- Italy's new Foreign Minister 
Antonio Martino rebuked French President Francois Mitterrand for 
saying that there was a risk of major changes to democracy in 
Italy under a coalition which includes neo-fascists. 
  Martino told reporters on the fringes of the Conference on 
Stability in Europe here that Mitterrand's comments about the 
presence of the neo-fascist MSI [Italian Social Movement] in 
media magnate Sivlio Berlusconi's government were "unacceptable". 
  He recalled that Mitterrand himself had in 1981 criticised 
those who carped at the presence of communists in his cabinet. 
  Berlusconi's office put out a statement Thursday [26 May] 
saying that there was nothing fearsome or equivocal about 
Berlusconi's coming to power.

aimed at ensuring its closure, the French and Russians have just 
engaged in the simulation of a large-scale disaster of the same 
type as that of Chernobyl. The objective was to test, with the 
help of the French Nuclear Protection and Safety Institute 
(IPSN), the Russian organization in the sphere of protecting 
populations and administering contaminated areas in the case of 
radioactive contamination of extensive areas. The former Soviet 
Union's experience is unique in this sphere with the nuclear 
disasters of Chelyabinsk in 1958 and Chernobyl in 1986. 
  The exercise, which required one year's preparation, was 
held 
from 21 to 25 June 1993 in the Kaluga region, a Russian 
territory already strongly affected by the effects of the 
Chernobyl explosion. The scenario and the facts are, moreover, 
directly inspired by the Ukrainian tragedy and the reaction of 
the local public authorities and the population at the time. 
Representatives of the administration, experts, representatives 
of the population and the media took part in the operation. 
They had to face the problems which arise not only immediately 
after the accident but also 16 days, then one year, and five 
years afterwards. A satellite link with the IPSN center in 
Fontenay-aux-Roses enabled French experts to participate 
directly in the operation. 
  The analysis of the results of the experiment, which was 
carried out last week, demonstrated the split which exists among 
the three main protagonists, namely the experts, the 
administration, and the media. The first complain in particular 
of not always being heeded by civil servants who, often fearing 
panic among the population and the spread of rumors, tend to do 
nothing. This response is found again in their relations with 
the media. The French and Russians were able to broadly examine 
their decisionmaking processes, and their crisis management 
techniques, an exercise which was sufficiently productive for 
the two partners to decide to repeat the experiment in summer 
1995 in Chelyabinsk, the other unfortunately famous site of the 
Soviet nuclear industry.

<F P=106> [Interview with Henri Conze, head of the General Delegation </F>
for Armaments, by Dominique Garraud; place and date not given: 
"Henri Conze: `We Were Coming Up Against a Brick Wall'"] 
  [Text] Henri Conze, who is close to Edouard Balladur, is 
head of the General Delegation for Armaments (DGA). He is 
calling for a "cultural revolution" in the arms industry to 
prevent "structural disarmament." 
  [Garraud] The government is counting on the enterprises to 
improve their productivity by 2 percent in order to successfully 
implement the Military Programming Law. Does this strike you as 
feasible? 
  [Conze] I am satisfied by this measure. What is being asked 
for is 2 percent in addition to the normal productivity 
increases by enterprises through better coordination of all the 
actions of the general staffs, the DGA, and the industrialists, 
who all have to adopt new directions. 
  This measure was necessary because we were coming up against 
a brick wall. If we had remained with the bad habits which have 
existed for decades, we were heading for structural disarmament. 
Spending on equipment between 1980 and the year 2000 has been 
virtually constant at around 100 billion francs [Fr] at the 1994 
value. What is the cost of a helicopter, a plane, a frigate in 
1980 and the year 2004? Between these two dates, the ratio is 
one to three. This means that in the year 2020, we will have 
one-third of the number of fighter planes, helicopters... We 
therefore had to get out of this structural disarmament and 
start to make an effort, launch a cultural revolution which must 
be continued. 
  [Garraud] Will this imply less sophistication in the new 
equipment, like the future NH-90 helicopter or the Rafale plane? 
  [Conze] The NH-90 will be radically reviewed in cooperation 
with our partners. With regard to the Rafale, we will make a 
new analysis of the costs. We will ask ourselves certain 
questions again to ensure that the plane corresponds as closely 
as possible to Air Force requirements, at the lowest possible 
cost. I cannot predict the answers. For decades we gave 
priority to performance at all costs. As we go into the new 
millenium, the problem is presented in different terms. 
  [Garraud] How have the industrialists reacted? 
  [Conze] It will take time for the message to be understood. 
On a fairly large number of programs now being implemented, we 
will very shortly have to make a functional analysis and an 
analysis of the value of these programs. The aim is once again 
to ask ourselves the question: Are all the functions stipulated 
for the product still valid? But the further advanced the 
program is, the more difficult it is to change it. I do not 
want to frighten anybody, but we will be faced with choices on a 
number of programs. 
  [Garraud] Some deputies of the majority think that the DGA's 
intervention in the programs is too costly... 
  [Conze] The cost of the DGA's intervention is 10 percent of 
equipment spending. Five percent is devoted to the actual 
functioning of the DGA. The other 5 percent corresponds to the 
DGA's intervention in the sphere of tests, evaluation, 
monitoring, and program expertise. It is justified by the 
advantages gained by having a capacity for opposition to 
industrialists, who are often in the position of having a 
monopoly. This does not mean that there is no need to make an 
effort to reduce this intervention cost. Henceforth the program 
directors will establish contractual relations with the DGA 
centers to see whether this intervention is necessary and 
whether, here too, productivity cannot be improved. 
  [Garraud] Some people suggest that the DGA should abandon 
its role as project manager in many programs. Are you 
considering that? 
  [Conze] We are wondering about it. Project management is 
not one of the DGA's responsibilities, but in practice it took 
this role when, 25 years ago, General de Gaulle launched major 
programs and France had neither the technologies nor the 
industrial network to implement them. Thus, the DGA often has a 
project management role in practice rather than in law: We have 
built strategic missiles, tactical missiles, and so forth. The 
project management and technological capabilities now exist in 
industry. We must continue to develop and transfer to industry 
as much know-how as possible on the equipment which they are 
manufacturing. This is not so easy. There is a happy medium to 
be found between project management responsibilities and the 
industrial policy which is the DGA's responsibility. The move 
toward less intervention by the DGA will therefore be slow.

  [Text] In lowering the interest rate by 0.5 points on 
Wednesday 11 May, the Bundesbank hit hard. True, the rise of 
long-term rates that has been taking place for many weeks 
required a gesture as significant as it is symbolic. Because the 
signal given by the Bundesbank is primarily addressed to 
financial operators, whose reaction is worrying central banks. 
This issue was discussed by the big moneymen last weekend in 
Basel. 
  Europe is faced by the grave danger of seeing its long-term 
interest rates continue to stretch at the risk of strangling the 
recovery that is beginning. The U.S. Federal Reserve has put in 
motion this dangerous movement. By deciding--quite logically--to 
raise short-term rates, which had dropped to abnormally low 
levels, its chairman, Alan Greenspan, provoked a rise in U.S. 
long-term interest rates that the fear of overheating the 
economy, and hence of the possible return of inflation, has 
accelerated. The tragedy is that this upward movement extended 
to Europe, where the situation is very different because it is 
just emerging from a deep recession. 
  How is it possible to put an end to this contagion, as 
fearsome as it is irrational? How could operators be convinced 
that it is possible, and logical, to decouple the evolution of 
the interest rates on both sides of the Atlantic? The decision 
of the Bundesbank is the most adequate. First, because it proves 
that German and European monetary authorities do not fear a 
resurgence of inflation. Secondly, because it tends to pull down 
these notorious long-term rates. 
  In this confrontation, the position of the Bank of France is 
an uncomfortable one. Indeed, for many weeks France's long-term 
interest rates rose more rapidly than Germany's. This phenomenon 
leads to questioning the efforts that have taken place over many 
decades to prove the pertinence of the so-called strong franc 
policy. One can understand the concern of the bank governor, 
Jean-Claude Trichet, about whom it must nevertheless be said 
that the recent reopening of the debate on the other economic 
policy did not help him. The problem is that this debate may 
well develop as the presidential election draws closer.

<F P=106> [Article by Frankfurt correspondent Eric Le Boucher: "German </F>
Model Holding Up"; first paragraph is LE MONDE introduction] 
  [Text] Across the Rhine, the German-style "bank-industry" 
that Credit Lyonnais claimed as its model is holding up well 
despite the impact of recession and internationalization. 
  Frankfurt--In emulation of the "German model," Jean-Yves 
Haberer dragged Credit Lyonnais into a series of investments in 
manufacturing, business, and service firms. 
  The bank's former president was not alone in the late 
1980's. 
The "bank-industry" concept was hot, as was that of the 
"bankinsurer," which called for hybridizing insurance companies 
and banks. The general idea was to find a solution that would 
allow French capitalism to finance itself while at the same time 
protecting it from possible hostile takeovers. 
  The "hard core" system of privatization, which distributed a 
strategic fraction of a company's stock among various "friendly" 
holders, was widely employed during the first cohabitation, but 
it got bad press after 1988, when it was reproached on political 
grounds for being too uniformly RPR [Rally for the Republic] in 
stripe and on economic grounds for putting too much emphasis on 
defending the existing stockholders (including the incumbent 
chairman and chief executive office) at the expense of 
developing the company's capital. 
  In short, the hard core solution exhibited the defects of 
peculiarly French "inbreeding." It provided the political 
framework for connivance among the major national firms in a 
generalized "you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours" 
arrangement that was in the final analysis fragile and in any 
case fainthearted. 
  At the same time, the Socialists, now back in the driver's 
seat, no longer wanted the state to cover the capital 
requirements of government-owned companies directly. 
<H5>  Portfolio </H5>
  Minds are turned to the "German model," which cast banks and 
a few insurance companies (including the biggest one, Allianz) 
in the central role. To compensate for a lack of capitalists 
during its industrialization, nineteenth- century Germany had 
relied on banks to mobilize savings indirectly and funnel them 
into industry. 
  The traditional involvement of financial institutions dates 
to this period. It is characterized in part by a "Hausbank" 
system under which a company relies on its bank for all of its 
transaction requirements, from the sale of shares in its stock 
to the use of overdraft facilities. Often the German bank itself 
may even acquire stock in its customer, either in the event of 
difficulties or in order to go in with it on its business. 
  This system was to be further strengthened after World War 
II. German banks, at one point dismembered by the Americans, 
were able to plead their case successfully with the help of 
Hermann Joseph Abs, the head of the biggest among them, Deutsche 
Bank. They reorganized as "universal banks," which were 
authorized to do everything at a time when U.S. banks were 
narrowly limited in scope. German universal banks may (as in 
France) open limited-service branch offices (deposit banking), 
arrange financing (investment banking), engage in insurance 
operations, and, of course, acquire shares in manufacturing or 
insurance companies. 
  It is no exaggeration to state that the power of Germany's 
financial institutions quickly became considerable. 
  Their heads cornered so many seats on industrial supervisory 
boards that a law was passed in 1965 (the Abs Act) limiting the 
number of seats that could be held by one person to 10. Today, 
banks and insurance companies still account for 10 percent of 
the seats on the supervisory boards of the country's 100 biggest 
firms. Percentage ownership is not always known, but it exceeds 
10 percent in an impressive number of cases (see table below). 
Allianz' total portfolio is valued at 185 billion marks [DM]! As 
for Deutsche Bank, its stable portfolio is worth DM25 billion, 
not including stock in banks. 
  The English-speaking world, which does not follow this model 
(or, rather, did not, since changes appear to be in the making 
in the United States), decries this influence on the country's 
economy. It sees it as a usurpation of power that is bad for the 
small investor and bad for free competition in general. The main 
arguments are as follows. Since banks would naturally prefer to 
be the ones to distribute credit to companies, they do not 
encourage them to turn to the stock market, thereby stunting its 
development. Because they are paid in commissions, they do not 
encourage corporations to declare large dividends. Because they 
can exercise their stockholding customers' voting rights in 
general stockholders' meetings, they "hog-tie" the discussions 
and decisions. In short, banks are held responsible for 
Germany's "hermetically sealed," "opaque" brand of capitalism. 
<H5>  More Banal Behavior </H5>
  Given that this closure and opaqueness do not appear to have 
harmed Germany's postwar recovery (on the contrary!), these 
causes for irritation in the English-speaking world were 
precisely what some in France, including Jean-Yves Haberer, 
admired. Hence the infatuation with the concepts of 
"bank-industry" or "bankinsurer-industry." 
  Today, the internationalization of finance, the 
"disintermediation" of the major groups (they have their own 
financial resources and need banks less and less), and the 
recession, which has triggered a series of serious setbacks, and 
compelled reappraisal or at least caution. In France, there has 
been much less talk about bank-industry since the resumption of 
privatization at breakneck speed and Credit Lyonnais' 
difficulties. Without debate or public explanation, French 
capitalism is regrouping around the "connivance" model. In 
Germany, on the other hand, banks remain loyal to the 
bank-industry concept despite some resounding failures: the 
collapse of Metallgesellschaft, which cost the lending banks 
DM3.4 billion, and the very recent bankruptcy of the Juergen 
Schneider real estate development empire. 
  True, their power over the national economy is gradually 
declining as trade barriers come down, they are themselves 
tending towards more banal behavior. "Our holdings have tended 
to diminish over the past 10 years," Peter Pietsch of 
Commerzbank says. However, while ties to big business are 
loosening to some extent, this is less true of small and 
mid-sized companies--the "Mittelstand" that constitutes the 
country's industrial strength. They remain attached to their 
Hausbaenke, even if they now call on several institutions for 
major transactions. Furthermore, stock ownership is only one of 
the tools at the disposal of German universal banks in 
maintaining their ties with industry. 
  "Our policy remains fundamentally unchanged," Peter Pietsch 
says. When problems arise, a bank increases its holdings (very 
often in conjunction with other banks), as in the case of 
Commerzbank's entry into the Karstadt distribution group during 
the economic crisis of the 1930's. In the 1970's, Deutsche Bank 
took over the Flick family's stock in Daimler-Benz to prevent it 
from falling into the hands of the Shah of Iran. Last year it 
increased its holdings in Continental Tires to 10 percent to 
counter Pirelli's attack. Dresdner Bank and Deutsche Bank will 
have to subscribe heavily to the next stock issue of 
Metallgesellschaft, which is on the verge of bankruptcy. 
  Conversely, holdings are sometimes sold. Deutsche Bank and 
Commerzbank recently each divested themselves of 15 percent of 
Karstadt's stock in order to facilitate the purchase of the 
group by its competitor, Kaufhof-Hertie. Deutsche Bank sold its 
12.8 percent interest in Suedzucker sugars in order to encourage 
restructuring in that sector. 
  Deutsche Bank's decision to reduce its stake in Daimler-Benz 
to under 25 percent is more unusual. Hilmar Kopper, the bank's 
head, "no longer wants minority control and does not want to be 
seen as having minority control. He wants to reduce his 
dependency as a stockholder," he explained to the magazine 
EUROMONEY in its January 1994 issue. He emphasizes that a 
Hausbank's power can backfire, making it more a "captive" of the 
company than vice versa. Hilmar Kopper also wants to trim his 
German portfolio and expand his European one. "I consider our 
industrial holdings necessary. They are an invaluable part of 
our assets," he says. But he wants "different-colored eggs" in 
his basket and plans to acquire an interest of "2 to 3 percent" 
in various European firms. 
<H5>  Superpower </H5>
  This policy is currently hampered by the amount of capital 
gains taxes that Deutsche Bank will have to pay on the sale of 
its investments. For the time being, the German bank officially 
owns stock in only one foreign company, Fiat. But from now on it 
will tend to become less German and more European. 
  Will France wake up when Deutsche Bank acquires 3 percent of 
Saint-Gobain, for example? Jean-Louis Beffa, the head of the 
French group, hopes it will and travels to Frankfurt regularly 
to ask Hilmar Kopper to do so. If it does, confronted with what 
will appear to be a "German superpower," the French may 
rediscover the virtues of bank-industry in a predictable panic.

  [Excerpt] Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Martino who is 
currently in Paris attending the Conference on European 
Stability, has called the remarks of French President Francois 
Mitterrand unacceptable. Mitterrand, referring to the new 
Italian Government and the figure of Silvio Berlusconi, spoke of 
a fearful inroad on democracy. Martino said that these remarks 
were isolated and were the only ones uttered by a head of state.

<F P=106> [Interview with Italian Agriculture Minister Adriana Poli </F>
Bortone by Carlo Cambi on 24 May; place not given: "Hands Off 
Our Wine" -- first paragraph is LA REPUBBLICA introduction] 
  [Text] Rome -- She is flying to Brussels to avert the 
threat of quotas looming over Italian wine. Today she meets 
with Rene Steichen, Europe's agriculture commissioner, the 
author of the plan that would eliminate almost one-fourth of our 
output. It will be a private meeting with a view to the next 
European Union Council of Ministers session on 30 May, at which 
the proposal will be officially submitted. It will be the 
European debut for Adriana Poli Bortone -- one of the National 
Alliance ministers -- in the same forum where our Community 
partners have raised several questions about the entry of 
"neo-Fascists" into the Italian Government. The new agriculture 
minister had to tackle the wine problem immediately. 
Immediately she sent Steichen a letter which described his 
proposals as "unacceptable." On the eve of her visit she 
revealed in this interview what she will say in Brussels and the 
outlines of her program. 
  [Cambi] Minister, will you repeat again today that 
Steichen's 
proposal is unacceptable? Do you not think that your political 
allegiance could hinder you, and therefore Italy, in the 
negotiations? 
  [Poli Bortone] I will tell Mr. Steichen what I have already 
written and what I repeated to him at our meeting in Greece. 
The proposal is unacceptable, period. We say "no" to the 
addition of sugar, we say "no" to quotas that would penalize 
Italy's output, and to the way in which they have been set, 
which in the case of wine is different from what has happened in 
every other sector. For Italy, the quota was set on the basis 
of the two least productive years out of seven, while in 
Germany's case it was set using the average of three harvests 
out of the six largest. This method must be rejected. In order 
to do so we have drawn up a detailed document that aims to rule 
out the addition of sugar and that intends to restore the 
balance to the mechanism for calculating surpluses. With regard 
to wine it is necessary to take the following fact into account: 
Alcoholic strength must be created in the fields, not in the 
cellars. If this principle is kept in mind, then it is possible 
to engage in discussions. As for my political allegiance, it 
must be understood that I represent the Italian Government, the 
entire country. 
  [Cambi] But the Belgian minister has said that he will 
refuse 
to shake hands with you... 
  [Poli Bortone] Everyone shook hands with me in Greece. They 
were very friendly and said that they wanted to cooperate with 
the Italian Government. Especially over wine, we have already 
reached understandings with Spain and France, which have more or 
less the same position as do we. Of course, if there are any 
obstacles, we will try to surmount them. This morning there 
were a thousand fishermen protesting outside the ministry. I 
went down to talk to them. I listened to what they had to say, 
and I will try to represent their interests within the 
Community. This, because the interests of agriculture are the 
interests of the country. 
  [Cambi] Minister, you know that your appointment has been 
regarded with skepticism. Why did you choose Agriculture? Are 
you by any chance taking evening classes to catch up? 
  [Poli Bortone] I know, but I am not as uninformed as people 
think; I have been in politics for 30 years, and moreover I have 
found an extremely professional staff here. Evening classes? I 
would like that, but I am learning fast partly thanks to the 
ministry experts. I chose Agriculture because it enables me to 
remain close to the problems of my land and my people, Puglia 
and the South. 
  [Cambi] Pardon me, but there is a contradiction there. You 
are a member of a pro-northern government; how can you protect 
the South? 
  [Poli Bortone] The contradictions are more imagined than 
real, and in any case by the protection of the South I do not 
mean the abuse of welfarism, which has caused much harm and has 
brought no benefit. What I intend to do is to promote 
agriculture, ensuring that the southern regions match the pace 
of the northern regions. I am convinced that the revitalization 
of agriculture and tourism can be a new key to the development 
of the South. 
  [Cambi] The National Alliance is a "nationalist" party, 
whereas agriculture is the most European of sectors. How can 
you keep these two things together? 
  [Poli Bortone] By trying to represent Italy's interests as 
best as I can within the Community, in the knowledge that a 
large part of agricultural policy is determined in Europe. I 
also have the regional authorities beside me. I have met with 
them and we have set a timetable for periodic meetings. I will 
be the representative of the country's interests in Brussels. 
And they must heed us. 
  [Cambi] You will face another thorny problem: milk quotas. 
What will you do about that? 
  [Poli Bortone] I will tell our partners -- as I have already 
told my Netherlands counterpart, and he seemed convinced to me 
-- that we are in compliance with regard to milk quotas. We 
have paid the fines and have come into line. They cannot 
continue accusing us. In any case, this issue is by no means 
closed. Furthermore, through administration by a commissioner 
and the transformation of AIMA [State Agency for Intervention in 
the Agricultural Market], we have proved our credibility. Let 
me return to the South for a moment. We have been accused of 
many kinds of fraud, but perhaps others commit more and worse 
frauds, many of them stemming from a welfarist vision. Well, I 
want to change this image. 
  [Cambi] But was the AIMA decree not drawn up by your 
predecessor, Alfredo Diana? 
  [Poli Bortone] I found a great deal of work begun by Diana, 
who is very competent, and I have no intention of wasting it; 
nor do I have any difficulty in admitting that I will take the 
best of it. 
  [Cambi] What does it feel like to be called a Fascist? Does 
it irritate you? 
  [Poli Bortone] I am a right-winger. I am in favor of a 
modern Right, and the National Alliance blueprint moves in the 
direction of transcending what is now a distant past. [National 
Alliance leader] Fini's speech to the lower house was very clear 
in this regard. As for my allegiance, I have never had any 
problems with anyone else, because what interests me is what 
needs to be done. I will be meeting with women of the PDS 
[Democratic Party of the Left], because one of my main efforts 
has been in the struggle against petty bureaucracy, and I know 
that they have worked hard on that. I will ask them to help. 
  [Cambi] What will you do in your first 100 days? 
  [Poli Bortone] I do not like first 100 days. I think that 
with the AIMA decree I have already achieved a pass mark in my 
first 100 days. To do things properly you need time and 
determination. I want first and foremost to raise the profile 
of agriculture, to bring young people closer to the land. To 
this end I am drawing up a plan involving education. I am sure 
that 100,000 jobs can be created. Another crucial decision is 
to make the best possible use of research institutions and to 
provide incentives to encourage the cultivation of crops 
specific to our lands.

<F P=106> [Report by "m.t.l.": "The New Foreign Ministry Team is </F>
Ready"] 
  [Text] Rome -- Antonio Martino has formed his team. The 
new foreign minister made his decisions shortly before leaving 
for the United States, but these are minor moves, at least for 
the time being, and they do not touch the fundamental structure 
of the Foreign Ministry. 
  As cabinet chief, Martino has appointed Emanuele Scammacca, 
previously ambassador to the Holy See and then "exiled" to 
represent Italy in Belgium. His deputy will be Giancarlo 
Aragona, a security policy expert and in recent years diplomatic 
adviser to the Ministry of Defense. The appointments have given 
rise to a series of remarks in the corridors about the "Messina 
lobby" which has installed itself at the Foreign Ministry. The 
minister is from Messina, as is the secretary general, 
Ferdinando Salleo (also his cousin), and Aragona, and, according 
to malevolent tongues, Scammacca too. "But what do you mean?" a 
smiling diplomat intervenes, "Scammacca is from Catania and, as 
an ambassador's son, a citizen of the world." 
  Another "heavy" appointment is in the Press Service, which 
has been entrusted to Maurizio Moreno, previously cabinet chief 
to Emilio Colombo and then coordinator of Somalia policy at the 
height of the crisis in Italy's intervention in this African 
country. Piero Francese, who was then in charge of the service, 
should become private secretary to the minister, a task which 
traditionally goes to an "outsider" to the ministry. 
  Under Salleo's leadership, the recently renewed structure of 
the general directorates remains unchanged for the time being. 
Mouths closed, for the most part, including the large number of 
civil servants detached as diplomatic advisers to the various 
ministries. With the exception of Aragona's very delicate 
posting at Defense, the others ought to remain substantially 
unchanged. 
  In particular there are no plans for changes in the office 
of 
diplomatic adviser to the prime minister's office, where 
Ambassador Sergio Vento remains for the moment, in the post to 
which he was called by Prime Minister Giuliano Amato and 
remained also under Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. Only in the coming 
months, once the new ministers' teams have been put to the test, 
could we expect rotations. At that time, something could also 
change at the Foreign Ministry.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Pact of the Left: `Everyone United </F>
in Opposition'"] 
  [Text] Rome -- Votes of confidence, budget, and 
parliamentary reforms and appointments. These are the four 
themes which have given birth to the "pact of permanent 
consultation" signed by the three parliamentary groups to which 
213 progressive deputies belong. The document, launched by the 
left-wing groups with the intention of setting up a common 
opposition on the topics of greatest importance, was presented 
yesterday at a press conference at the Chamber of Deputies by 
Luigi Berlinguer, Famiano Crucianelli, Giorgio Bogi, Gianni 
Mattioli, Diego Novelli, and Fabio Mussi. 
  The progressive deputies "commit themselves in the form of a 
permanent consultation pact aimed at common parliamentary 
behavior on questions of: votes of confidence and 
no-confidence, government finance and the budget, constitutional 
and electoral reforms, and parliamentary appointments." When it 
comes to "questions of conscience" and matters relating to 
ethical subjects and religious convictions, the pact permits 
"freedom of behavior" for each individual parliamentarian. The 
accord's signatories, freely inspired by the "joint declaration 
of intent" signed between the progressive allies at the time of 
the 27 March parliamentary elections, undertake in the document 
to "ensure the growth of, to consolidate, deepen and extend this 
unity." 
  With the "pact," the progressive deputies also undertake to 
maintain and strengthen the joint electoral committees in their 
respective constituencies, which will be linked by regional or 
constituency-level coordination committees. Additionally, 
permanent coordination bodies and working groups will be created 
in the parliamentary committees. This document shows, Luigi 
Berlinguer, PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] floor leader in 
the lower house, stated, that the progressive's united path has 
not ended, even if three distinct parliamentary groups have been 
born. We will present an opposition without adjectives, firmly, 
and without agitation. Communist Renewal floor leader 
Crucianelli presented the document as an instrument "to give 
life to a united battle by the opposition on contents, taking 
into account that an attempt is being made to set up a system," 
and indicated as the first joint engagement the national 
manifestation on schools on 29 May. For Giorgio Bogi, the pact 
is a "gesture of loyalty toward the electorate," while for 
Greens deputy Gianni Mattioli the agreement is the fruit "of a 
strong united effort coming from the periphery."

<F P=106> [Report by Claus Reitan: "The Latest Poll: 41 Percent of </F>
Austrians Still Undecided About Vote"] 
  [Excerpt] "This referendum will be the most thrilling race 
for votes that we have witnessed in the past few years. It 
might just lead to downright anxiety of the government. A 
forecast is hardly possible three weeks before voting day," 
Professor Fritz Karmasin, who is regarded as a serious opinion 
researcher, says in summarizing the views of the nation based on 
a representative poll carried out on a particularly large scale 
(2,000 personal interviews). 
  At first glance, however, the race seems to be clearly 
decided. In informal interviews in the middle of May, 50 percent 
of all interviewed Austrians voted "for Europe" and were fully 
convinced they would vote "yes." In the latest -- 
representative -- Gallup poll, only 38 percent say "no." At 
present, only 13 percent of Austrians say officially that they 
do not yet know how they will vote. 
  In an additional wave of interviews, however, Gallup 
analyzed 
in detail the certainty of Austrians about the vote. And what 
do you know? Suddenly, only 57 percent of Austrians have firmly 
decided on how they will vote on 12 June. Literally to the very 
last minute, the decision of 41 percent is open -- which is 
indicated in plain language: 
  -- At present, only 32 percent of the total population will 
"certainly" vote yes. 
  -- They are facing 25 percent who are firmly determined to 
say no. 
  -- Between them, the government and the opposition have to 
struggle for 41 percent who are more or less undecided (plus 2 
percent of the people who refused to give an answer). In 
absolute figures: 2.3 million of 5.6 million people entitled to 
vote still have to be convinced. Particularly noteworthy is 
that almost two-thirds of the undecided -- 27 percent of the 
total population --want to decide "on the vote at the last 
moment." [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] President Suleyman Demirel has stated that he 
referred back to the Assembly the bill on housing for civil 
servants because it would exacerbate already difficult 
conditions in Turkey. Demirel held a breakfast meeting with 
reporters in Isparta. [passage omitted] 
  Reacting to a 25 percent cutback of U.S. aid to Turkey, 
Demirel said claims of human rights violations and the Cyprus 
issue were given as the reasons for the aid cut. Stressing that 
there is no question of Turkey violating human rights, Demirel 
said that the same measures used against human rights violations 
in the United States are being implemented in Turkey. 
  On the Cyprus impasse, Demirel said that Turkey is not 
responsible for the stalemate.

<F P=106> [By Chris Parkin and Sian Clare] </F>
  [Text] John Major and his Irish counterpart Albert Reynolds 
today intensified the pressure on the IRA to end its campaign of 
violence immediately. They said there was no shred of 
justification for continuing the killings in Ulster. Speaking 
on the steps of Downing Street after a 90-minute discussion, the 
two leaders warned they were not "waiting around" for Sinn Fein 
to respond to last year's joint declaration. 
  Progress was being made on a framework document grounded in 
the declaration and on talks with the constitutional parties -- 
and would proceed with or without Sinn Fein. Mr Major urged the 
paramilitaries to end their campaign of violence. 
  He and Mr Reynolds shared "a disappointment that the 
violence 
continues," both the IRA violence and the loyalist violence. 
"There is no shred of justification for it whatsoever." 
  Mr Reynolds said: "There is one message quite clear that we 
want to give -- that is that neither paramilitary organisations 
are going to gain anything or bolster their position by a 
continuation of violence. "It is quite clear that the next 
logical step if the peace process is to be moved forward is to 
have a cessation of violence. "There is no single vestige of 
justification for the loss of one single life on either side in 
either community." 
  If Sinn Fein wanted a couple of weeks for further debate 
over 
the joint declaration, then neither government minded. But, he 
insisted, there must be an end to violence immediately. 
  Mr Major made clear there was no deadline for the IRA to 
respond to the declaration, but emphasised the two governments 
were not simply waiting around for Sinn Fein to reply. "There 
is no delay, there has been no delay and there will be no delay 
in continuing discussions with the constitutional parties and 
with the government of the Republic of Ireland on the framework 
document we are producing," said Mr Major. "A great deal of 
progress has been made. There's more to be done but it is not 
awaiting an answer from Sinn Fein." 
  Mr Reynolds said: "The two governments are not going to wait 
around, are not waiting around, for any more prevarication on 
either side to stop the violence. We continue with our own 
business." 
  Mr Major was questioned by reporters about Sinn Fein 
president Gerry Adams's earlier comments in which he offered 
what was interpreted by some as new hope for peace in Northern 
Ireland. 
  Mr Major said: "I see nothing new in what he had to say this 
morning. "What was quite striking was what he didn't say. He 
made no indication that he was going to give up violence." 
  Mr Adams indicated there would be a Sinn Fein response to 
the 
peace moves after the European elections on June 9. 
  "I am quite convinced that what is going to come out of this 
peace process is a peace settlement -- I am quite convinced 
about it. It is a significant step." 
  He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "It is part of one of 
those steps which are required to advance the peace process. It 
addresses some of the core issues and it dismisses some of the 
other questions." 
  The fact that the British government responded to Sinn 
Fein's 
list of questions about the declaration was "very significant". 
  Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring told a European 
conference 
in Paris today: "The time for clarification and debate is over. 
It is now time, once and for all, to stop the killing from 
whatever quarter on the island of Ireland. 
  "The people of Ireland will wait no longer." 
  Mr Reynolds said later he hoped Sinn Fein's response to the 
declaration "will be genuine and positive, and that it will lead 
to a permanent cessation of violence. 
  "That is the only logical next step if the peace process is 
to be moved forward. I do not want to see anybody killed in the 
meantime on either side." 
  He added: "What is important is that the violence by both 
sets of paramilitaries in Northern Ireland should be ended 
immediately." 
  Mr Reynolds said at the Irish Embassy in London that moves 
planned by the British and Irish governments to re-establish an 
inter-party negotiating process in Northern Ireland were being 
maintained. 
  He and Mr Major would have a full-scale summit on their 
peace 
initiative in mid-July. 
  Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat Ulster spokesman Lord Holme 
said: 
"It is urgent that the British government table proposals for 
constitutional progress in Northern Ireland based on devolution, 
power-sharing and a Bill of Rights. 
  "If Sinn Fein want to renounce violence and join the talks 
process, all well and good, but the onus is on the British 
government to take the initiative in consultation with the Irish 
government and the constitutional parties of Northern Ireland."

  [Text] According to information received by the Greek 
Foreign Ministry, more Greek minority members are being arrested 
in Delvine. Foreign Ministry spokesman Konstandinos Bikas said 
today that there is information that the Albanian authorities 
are searching for about 14 people. Four of them have already 
been arrested. 
  The Greek Government has addressed a strong warning to 
Albania to respect the Greek minority and described the Albanian 
actions as a more general policy of intimidation against the 
minority with the aim of causing panic and making people flee 
their homes. The Greek Government will use every legal means to 
protect the Greek minority, the Foreign Ministry spokesman 
stressed. He described the Albanian Government's actions as 
tactics reminiscent of times condemned by the democratic 
community. 
  Along with representations lodged by the Foreign Ministry 
with both the U.S. State Department and the Albanian Foreign 
Ministry, the Greek side has withdrawn its proposal for a 
meeting between Greek and Albanian delegations on preparations 
for a new meeting between their foreign ministers. 
  Referring to a State Department appraisal that Greek 
accusations of Albania's policy toward minority members are 
baseless, the Foreign Ministry spokesman said these appraisals 
have already been overshadowed by the new arrests in Delvine. 
  At noon today, Khristos Zakharakis, Foreign Ministry 
secretary general, and Yeoryios Angelakis, director of the 
ministry's Balkan Affairs Department, summoned U.S. Charge 
d'Affaires James Williams to the Foreign Ministry. 
  Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said a short time 
ago that following the arrest of Greeks in Albania, Foreign 
Minister Karolos Papoulias plans a telephone conversation with 
UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. It will probably take 
place today. Venizelos reiterated for the last time that Greece 
considers the improvement of Greek-Albanian relations dependent 
upon respect for the rights of the Greek minority in Albania. 
The government spokesman stressed that Greece will take all the 
necessary steps with international organizations and in the 
capitals of countries that have anything to do with the issue.

  [Excerpt] Cyprus-U.S. relations are going through a crisis 
because of the delay in the submission of UN Secretary General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali's report and the behind-the-scenes 
activities of Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department's outgoing 
special coordinator on Cyprus. 
  I MAKHI has learned that the government and the political 
leadership are furious with the U.S. role and its persistence in 
not briefing the Greek Cypriot side on the contents of the 
Vienna talks. Political circles in Nicosia are strongly 
concerned that Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas may 
"conditionally accept" the confidence-building measures. They 
stressed that one consequence of such a negative and dangerous 
development would be to shake Cyprus-U.S. relations. 
  In any case, yesterday the government explicitly reiterated 
its opposition to the current delay and warned harshly about the 
repercussions from any amendment to the 21 March UN document. 
In a meeting yesterday between Foreign Minister Alekos 
Mikhailidhis and U.S. Ambassador to Cyprus Richard Boucher which 
could be described as a protest move, the government tried to 
find out whether Lamb had actually submitted proposals (as 
mentioned in the Turkish Cypriot press) that approximate the 
negative Turkish positions. According to I MAKHI's information, 
Boucher explicitly denied that any assurances or promises were 
made to the Turkish Cypriot leader during the Vienna talks. 
  The Cypriot Government does not appear to have much faith in 
the U.S. assurances, because reports from New York speak about a 
further delay in the submission of the report (until the end of 
May, early June). After meeting the U.S. ambassador, 
Mikhailidhis stressed that "the impression that is created by 
the delay in submitting the report is that this is designed to 
serve the Turkish positions and maneuvers." He added that the 
United Nations has described the 21 March document as final, and 
that is how our side accepted it. 
  Despite relevant assurances, Boucher's remarks yesterday 
intensify concerns about U.S. activity. Asked whether 
Washington had promised anything to the Turkish side, Boucher 
specifically said: "The entire procedure for implementing the 
confidence-building measures depends on promises made to both 
sides." He added that the basic point is "to find an 
operational settlement that will enable both sides to use the 
basic changes (from the confidence-building meausres) to find a 
new way of approaching the Cyprus issue." Boucher said there is 
still a chance, stressing that the United States continues to 
support the measures. The preparation of the UN secretary 
general's report has already begun. 
  The foreign minister and Tom Richardson, British deputy 
foreign secretary, exchanged views on current developments at 
their meeting yesterday. The British official, who had earlier 
met Denktas, said he did not get the impression that the Turkish 
Cypriot leader is trying to buy time. Richardson denied that 
the United States and Britain are involved in behind-the-scenes 
activities. 
<H5>  Kasoulidhis' Statement </H5>
  Government Spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis reiterated that if 
there are any attempts to change the 21 March UN document, the 
Cypriot Government will cease to abide by it. He also said the 
Cypriot Government is angry because of the repeated delays in 
submitting Butrus-Ghali's report to the Security Council. 
  Asked whether President Glavkos Kliridhis intends to hold a 
referendum so the Cypriot people can decide if they want the 
confidence-building measures, Kasoulidhis said the president has 
not yet decided on what he will do if he is forced to pull out 
of the 21 March document. 
  Asked if the Cypriot Government will lodge a demarche with 
the U.S. about reports that during the Vienna talks Lamb 
submitted proposals for amending the 21 March document, 
Kasoulidhis said this is under consideration. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Statement by Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl at the </F>
Bundestag in Bonn -- live] 
  [Text] Madam President, ladies and gentlemen. Let me first 
draw your attention to the fact that we have agreed with the 
parliamentary groups that we will have a detailed debate on the 
objectives of Germany's European Union [EU] presidency here on 
29 June. This means that my government statement today will not 
concentrate on that topic. 
  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in just over two 
weeks, on 12 June, voters in the 12 EU member states will elect 
the new European Parliament, which will then be in office from 
1994 to 1999. These will be years full of dramatic changes, 
years that will bring decisive steps forward for the EU. This 
year's European Parliament election is of special importance, 
because the European Parliament has been given numerous new 
rights and additional powers under the Maastricht Treaty. In my 
report following the Maastricht negotiations I pointed out that 
we, the Federal Government, would have liked to extend the 
rights and strengthened the powers of the European Parliament 
even further. But during the negotiations on the Maastricht 
Treaty our position did not win a majority. I would, however, 
like to point out that we continue to aim at an expansion of the 
European Parliament's powers, particularly in view of the 1996 
conference. [applause] 
  I am confident, together with you, that Austria, Sweden, 
Finland, and Norway will very soon join the EU as new members, 
after the necessary referenda have been held in these countries. 
And they will then also be represented in the European 
Parliament. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take this 
opportunity, also in view of the enlargement negotiations, to 
thank the foreign minister very much for his enormous efforts 
during these talks. [applause] There have been one or two 
critical voices abroad, saying that the Germans were trying too 
intensely to achieve the admission of these countries. I think 
it is in line with our common policy that we wanted enlargement, 
and it is right that the foreign minister also made exceptional 
efforts on behalf of the Federal Government and myself. 
[applause] Madam President, ladies and gentlemen.... I do not 
know, you can applaud here, the enlargement is also in your 
interest.... I do not think that party politics can go so far 
as to obscure everything that is sensible here. [applause] I 
think you have a lot to catch up with regarding applause for 
colleague Kinkel. You can make up for that today. [applause] 
  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen; several days ago, on 
8 May, we remembered the end of World War II 49 years ago. At 
that time, Europe was in ruins, and the situation of the people 
in Germany was desperate. For many, it seemed to be hopeless. 
Those who experienced that time know how much we have achieved 
since then in Germany. Seen this way, the progress we have made 
on the road to European unity is a great success. The vision of 
the best people in Europe is about to materialize. One cannot 
stress clearly enough that the consistent continuation of this 
policy of European integration is of crucial importance. 
[applause] 
  There is no responsible alternative to the policy of 
European 
integration. This insight has decisively marked the policy of 
all federal governments under Konrad Adenauer, Ludwig Erhard, 
Kurt Georg Kiesinger, Willy Brandt, and Helmut Schmidt. The 
goal of firmly anchoring Germany in the process of European 
unification has determined the actions of all democratic parties 
in Germany since the war, and I am quite sure that this will 
remain so. [applause] 
  Anchoring the Federal Republic of Germany in the European 
Community was the decisive basis for the restoration of German 
unity in peace and freedom with the consent of all our 
neighbors. Without this policy in the decades preceding 
1989-90, our European neighbors would never have agreed to 
German unity. [applause] 
  In 1950 Konrad Adenauer said that a reunited Germany would 
not have lasting peace, if it were not firmly anchored in a 
united Europe. 
  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen; peace and freedom are 
not a foregone conclusion, and we have seen that they must be 
ensured anew every day. European unity is the most effective 
insurance against the reemergence of nationalism, chauvinism, 
and racism, including in our part of the continent. Seen this 
way, the success of the process of European integration is in 
the final analysis a matter of war and peace. It is the 
decisive prerequisite for peace and freedom also of the Germans 
in the 21st century. 
  We have all seen the terrible pictures from the territory of 
the former Yugoslavia. In this conflict in the former 
Yugoslavia, we have seen that the limits of possible options 
regarding the prevention and solution of crises have been 
brutally revealed. For two years now, we have seen these 
pictures every day. To a high degree, the credibility of 
European democracies is at stake, and in many countries, 
including Germany, efforts to end the conflict will not be 
considered sufficient. 
  I can only say that, if what we have started in Maastricht 
-- 
which is not nearly completed -- had been possible much earlier, 
we would have had much better opportunities to meet European 
responsibility in this respect, too. In view of these terrible 
pictures in the region, many people, including in Germany, are 
asking themselves why the European Union and NATO are not doing 
much more to end the conflict. I think we all understand these 
questions. However, we should remember how much this civil war 
is marked by hatred and irrationality -- hatred that has partly 
developed over the centuries. 
  We must stress here that the international community must 
again and again make every effort, even in almost hopeless 
situations, to bring about a comprehensive peace solution. Such 
efforts have been increased in recent weeks and months. There 
are no ready formulas for solving this conflict, but I think 
there are the beginnings of better hopes that a solution can be 
brought about. 
  However, ladies and gentlemen, we Germans should be 
particularly careful regarding advice to others. We do not have 
the moral right to demand that responsible politicians in other 
countries should do more than we ourselves can do and are ready 
to do. [applause] 
  Rather, we should make use of every opportunity to show our 
respect and sympathy to other nations' young soldiers, who risk 
their lives there, and their relatives. [applause] 
  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen; when I took over as 
federal chancellor in October 1982, the slogan of Eurosclerosis 
was the most used term in connection with European policy. Who 
would have thought at that time, following the unsuccessful 
Copenhagen summit in December 1982, that despite all the 
difficulties and many imponderables, Europe would make a 
decisive step forward 11 years later when the Maastricht Treaty 
went into effect. 
  Let us remember: Since those days, the European Community 
has undergone an unprecedented, successful development -- 
ranging from the solemn declaration of Stuttgart, to European 
Union in July 1983, the accession of Spain and Portugal on 1 
January 1986, the Single European Act, the single market 
program, and the Maastricht Treaty. 
  It was 11 years in which we gradually came closer to 
European unification. Germany and France, France and Germany 
have made a decisive contribution to this success story. With 
numerous joint initiatives, President Francois Mitterrand and I 
tried again and again to move Europe forward. We did not do it 
because of the idea we are sometimes accused of having, that is, 
that we want to advance others by hegemonic thinking; we did it 
because of the special and historical responsibility for the 
development of Europe that the French and Germans, of course, 
have to point out again and again. [applause] 
  I think that France and Germany have reason to be proud of 
these opportunities that we have made use of. Looking back at 
these years, I am pleased to take this opportunity to thank 
Hans-Dietrich Genscher for his personal contribution to the 
process of European unification. [applause] 
  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen; Europe is also 
essential for the future development of the German economy. 
European unification has had a decisive impact on the upswing 
of the German economy in these decades. European unification 
has made a key contribution to employment, growth, prosperity, 
and the inner stability of Germany. I want to cite a few 
figures to illustrate this. In 1957 German exports valued at 14 
billion German marks [DM] went to the 12 countries of today's 
EU. Last year, our exports to Europe were worth about DM300 
billion. With more than 370 million people, the future Europe 
of the 16 will be one of the most important economic areas of 
the world, in addition to NAFTA with 360 millions and the ASEAN 
area. One has to realize what this development means for the 
future of Germany in detail. Millions of jobs in Germany depend 
on our exports to the EU. Economically, we Germans benefit 
greatly from the EU. With a view to the present 12, one can say 
that we benefit most from the EU. It is clear that we have 
reached the upper limit of what we can pay to the EU. It it 
right that we, as economically the strongest country, pay most 
because we benefit most. However, it is also true that the 
future financing concept in the Community has to be oriented far 
more on per capita income of the individual countries. It is 
our objective that other member states with a comparable per 
capita income assume more financial responsibility than in the 
past. [applause] 
  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen; the mark is the most 
important currency in Europe. In the past decade, it developed 
into an anchor of stability in monetary policies. The stability 
of the mark is a great good for the Germans. The experience of 
our people in two periods of hyperinflation in this century, 
with the loss of capital assets and the profound deformation of 
the social structure of our country, has made it clear that a 
stable currency is always and above all a guarantee for 
political stability. Therefore, our course continues to be 
aimed at the stability of the mark. [applause] 
  I believe we have every reason to be happy today when we 
take 
note of the information that the rate of inflation has fallen to 
2.9 percent, that is below 3 percent. [applause] 
  In the Maastricht Treaty we succeed in having it accepted 
that the future European Central Bank will virtually correspond 
to the model of the German Bundesbank. This means that there 
will only be a joint European currency if it is as stable and of 
the same quality as the mark. We will stick to the criteria 
agreed in the Maastricht Treaty for the third stage of Economic 
and Monetary Union without any ifs and buts. I would like to 
repeat it once more [applause], we by no means want to postpone 
dates. Realistically, however, I have to say once again that 
the order must be that the stability criteria come first and the 
question of the calendar come second. This must be clearly said. 
[applause] 
  The decision in favor of Frankfurt/Main as the seat of the 
future European Central Bank is a mark of the confidence of our 
partners and friends in Europe, also for our stability policy. 
It is a great success, and it is a sign of everyday life in 
Germany that this important decision is only taken note of to a 
limited extent. 
  This decision means that in a few years, or decades, in the 
next century, Frankfurt will be the third great international 
financial center beside New York and Tokyo. Anyone who 
considers this can work out what this means for the German 
economy. [applause] 
  Ladies and gentlemen, in domestic and legal policy we can no 
longer solve the problems that we are facing on a national level 
alone. Although many people still do not want to believe this, 
we need even closer cooperation with our European neighbors. 
You will know that the Federal Government would have liked to 
go beyond what we achieved in these questions at the Maastricht 
negotiations. Back then, we did not succeed in this because of 
our partners' resistance. I am sure that now that a few years 
have passed since the signing of the Maastricht Treaty and that 
the signals and problems are emerging everywhere, the chances 
are becoming much better for including these problems to a 
greater extent. I hope very much -- and this will be our aim -- 
that 1996 will bring more comprehensive agreements. 
  What is of very great importance for our domestic security 
is 
closer European cooperation in fighting the drugs mafia, 
organized crime, and illegal arms trading. The Maastricht 
Treaty and the Schengen Agreement contain the first solutions, 
on which we will have to base our future efforts. Ladies and 
gentlemen, a few weeks ago there was a news item going around 
the world. It said that the experts expect $250 billion, yes 
billion, in dirty money from such dealings to come into Europe 
this year. No one should think that we will be able to tackle 
this problem with the traditional ways of cooperating in Europe. 
This is in no way a criticism of our own police authorities. 
It is a completely new challenge to which we will have to find 
the right answer. [applause] 
  The opening of borders, which we are all trying to achieve, 
must not lead to giving international crime more room to act. 
Let me, therefore, repeat once again that the establishing of a 
European police authority, Europol, is long overdue. It could 
be similar to an authority such as the Federal Office of 
Criminal Investigation in our country. We will do everything 
that we can to improve agreement in this respect. 
  What is also important for us and for everyone else in 
Europe 
is that we work out a common asylum policy. We want to 
distribute the burdens more evenly, as we in Germany are 
currently taking on the main influx of refugees and 
asylum-seekers. It is in our very own interest that we are 
surrounded by stable and sound economies in Central and East 
Europe. That is why we will consistently expand the European 
Union's relations with the states of Central, East, and 
southeastern Europe. At the suggestion of the Federal 
Government, we promised them clear prospects of membership at 
the European Council in Copenhagen. These will now have to be 
realized step by step. Nice words are not enough in this 
respect. We must offer these countries opportunities, even if 
it may be difficult for some people here to familiarize 
themselves with this idea. We have to offer them the 
opportunity to sell their products on our markets, our EU 
markets, under fair conditions. [applause] This also includes 
direct assistance. The FRG has been supporting the young 
democracies in Central and East Europe with enormous amounts 
both on a bilateral level, and within the European Union and the 
G-24. We took on our responsibility at an early stage and have 
made by far the greatest contribution of all the G-7 states 
toward the Central, East, and southeastern European reform 
process. Our bilateral contributions and promises to the 
successor states of the former Soviet Union had amounted to just 
under DM90 billion by the end of last year. Another DM37 
billion has been allocated to the states of Central, East, and 
southeastern Europe. And this does not include the enormous 
sums that we have paid via international organizations, the EU, 
and the G-24. Ladies and gentlemen, let me take this 
opportunity to point out once again that we have now reached the 
limit of our capacity. 
  Others who are able to do so should now commit themselves 
financially to a larger degree. [applause] We are aware that 
what we are doing can only be help for self-help. Economic aid, 
credits, advice alone cannot lead to success. No one can take 
over responsibility from these countries and successfully 
complete the reforms they have started. 
  In this context, I stress that the Federal Government has 
always emphatically pointed out the insufficient safety of 
nuclear power plants in some Central and East European 
countries. The measures that have been taken are not 
sufficient, and I am not satisfied at all with the way this 
matter is being dealt with, and at the European Council meeting 
in Korfu and at the World Economic Summit in Naples, I will 
therefore once again urge a solution to these problems. 
[applause] 
  But, ladies and gentlemen, in view of criticism voiced in 
our 
country, we must also say that every reasonable help for 
self-help is also a chance for a happy future of Germany. If 
the reforms in Russia fail -- to mention just an example -- and 
if this large country, our most important neighbor in the East, 
were to relapse into old structures, no matter whether they are 
communist structures or a military dictatorship, the 
consequences would cost the West, including Germany, much more. 
We do not want to deploy missiles again, we want there to be 
peace and freedom everywhere in these regions. [applause] 
  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen; the European economy, 
including in Germany, has passed through a far-reaching 
recession and structural crisis. We in Germany are also 
suffering from the consequences of this cyclical slow-down. 
Fortunately, the orders received and many other indicators show 
that we are now getting out of this cyclical crisis -- not only 
in the forecasts, but also in real life, where recovery has set 
in. [applause] We stand a good chance that the 1.5-percent 
growth rate of GNP predicted by the Federal Government in 
January will be achieved. Those who mocked us should at least 
tacitly admit that development is going in this direction. 
  But, ladies and gentlemen, there is not the slightest reason 
to sound the all-clear. Now that we are possibly better able to 
learn from the mistakes that were made over many years in the 
past, we must do everything to secure Germany as an industrial 
center, safeguard Germany's future, and carry out improvements. 
Much has been possible in this connection. I specifically 
mention the pay settlements, the larger chance to make the labor 
market more flexible, and many considerations to improve the 
competitiveness of Germany as an industrial and export nation. 
  We must continue this course. It is above all important for 
our most important goal to combat unemployment and preserve 
jobs. We, the Federal Government, have drawn the necessary 
conclusions by adopting the program for safeguarding Germany's 
future and the action program for more growth and employment, 
and things are developing well. However, they are only 
developing, and much remains to be done. 
  In the European framework, the Federal Government has 
actively supported the proposals contained in Commission 
President Jacques Delors' White Paper, because safeguarding 
Germany's future is inseparably linked with safeguarding 
Europe's future. 
  It is our goal to combat unemployment at the national and 
European levels. Many suggestions made by Jacques Delors 
correspond to our own goals. Let me mention just some of them: 
Increasing flexibility on the labor market, reducing ancillary 
wage costs, creating new employment opportunities, and taking 
special measures against youth and long-term unemployment. 
Translated into German conditions, this means concretely that 
we must do everything in our power to make sure that youths in 
the new laender who want to have an apprenticeship get an 
apprenticeship and good training, if they are willing and able. 
[applause] 
  Another example is the construction of trans-European 
networks in the field of transport, energy, and 
telecommunications. An outstanding example of this is the 
expansion of the East-West railroad connection. We want to 
build a fast rail connection across the continent as quickly as 
possible, from London, via Paris, Frankfurt, Berlin, Warsaw, to 
Moscow. This is also an important aim of Russian policy, as 
President Yeltsin pointed out during his recent visit to 
Germany. Ladies and gentlemen, this is not a vision of the 
future. What was possible in terms of railroad tracks at the 
end of last century must also be possible to achieve with the 
means of the late 20th century, if only we want to achieve this 
together and see the importance of such a connection. [applause] 
  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen; open markets and free 
world trade are in Germany's, and Europe's, very own interest. 
A decisive step in this direction was the successful conclusion 
of the GATT Uruguay Round at the end of last year. With this, 
we passed the most comprehensive package of the past few decades 
liberalizing world trade. We on the German side did everything 
we could to help bring this important pact about. 
  A federal Europe has been and will be the aim of Germany's 
European policy. We want unity with diversity. We do not want 
a centralized European state that makes regional, national, 
cultural traditions, and historic experiences disappear. In a 
unified Europe, in the European house that we want to build, we 
will remain Germans and French, keeping our identity. The terms 
home country, fatherland, and Europe do not mean contrast to us, 
but are the threesome of the future for us. Ladies and 
gentlemen, anyone wanting a Europe of the citizens must reject 
all tendencies toward European centralism. That is why we have 
included the principle of subsidiarity in the Maastricht Treaty; 
and this means that only those things shall and may be decided 
on a European level, in Brussels, that cannot be better decided 
on a national or regional level. I would also like to add to 
the German debate that by regional level I do not only mean the 
laender, but also our cities and municipalities. [applause] 
For me, federalism does not only mean the relationship between 
Brussels and Bonn, or between Bonn, Dusseldorf, and Munich, but 
also between Dusseldorf and Cologne, and between Munich and 
Nuremberg, to define this clearly for everyone. [applause] If 
we want to take subsidiarity seriously, this also means that we 
must be courageous enough to examine regulations and directives 
to see whether they are still appropriate. In some cases this 
may give rise to the question whether they have ever been 
appropriate. [applause] Let me add to your applause, on a 
self-critical note.... I know, you have never been spoilt with 
too much applause, but I think this morning we want to see a bit 
of common ground with regard to Europe, and I hope you agree. 
You do not have to applaud when I am saying on a self-critical 
note that many of the criticisms of Europe and Brussels have not 
been completely free of hypocrisy, because many national 
interests, including economic ones, are taken there and then 
acted out in politics. And this also needs to be said in this 
debate. [applause] 
  Plainly speaking, we must not try -- and this holds true 
for all groups, including in Germany -- to push through in 
Brussels what we cannot implement at the national level. That 
is not very fair policy. [applause] 
  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen; it is the goal of 
Germany's Europe policy to make 1994 also a year of success for 
European integration and continue the successes and experiences 
of recent years. As I said earlier, we will have a detailed and 
intensive debate. I personally will face the discussions in the 
responsible committees and bring in the Federal Government's 
proposals. What we can do we will do in the months following 1 
July when Germany takes over the presidency. 
  Let me add that it is my goal to implement or at least try 
something that we were unable to carry out in the past. We will 
try to reach agreement with our French friends on certain 
problems, so that what we start in our presidency can be 
continued in the subsequent French presidency, because everyone 
knows that the time of six months is tight for making decisions. 
We will consistently make use of every opportunity. 
  Ensuring and continuing European integration is not any 
problem, it is the fateful problem of our continent, and for 
Germany's future, it is the prerequisite for peace and freedom. 
Konrad Adenauer said in 1950 that German unity and European 
integration are two sides of the same coin. This statement has 
proved to be visionary and right in political life. We, the 
Federal Government, will contribute our share to create the 
decisive conditions for building a weather-tight European house 
and to allow future generations to live in this house in peace 
and freedom. [applause]

<F P=106> [Statement by SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping at the Bundestag </F>
in Bonn -- live] 
  [Text] Ladies and gentlemen; Europe is a success story -- 
and it has to remain one, too. This is why the decisive task 
for the next few months and years will be to consolidate the 
conditions under which Europe managed to become a success story: 
intensive cooperation for shared prosperity and joint security, 
integration of the states to guarantee peace. After all, 
European integration is the attempt -- the largely successful 
attempt -- to consolidate the vision of a peaceful continent 
after the devastating experience of two terrible fratricidal 
wars on this continent. [applause] This is why we support the 
intensification of European integration. And we also support 
the enlargement of the European Union [EU]. One will probably 
need more imagination than that of economic and monetary 
cooperation and associate membership treaties if the states of 
eastern central Europe, in particular, should be given clear 
prospects for EU accession. [applause] 
  Prague, Warsaw, and Budapest are European cities. The fact 
that the people there had to live under communism, a system that 
was forced upon them, does not justify their being seen as mere 
postcommunist states today. [applause] This idea is 
deliberately intended to build on what Czech President Vaclav 
Havel said. I also want to make clear that our behavior so far 
in West Europe as well as in Germany is regarded as insufficient 
by these countries because the lofty words from the beginning of 
a new era in 1989/90 have in many cases been absolutely 
inconsistent with the actions that followed. 
  After the end of the East-West conflict it is no longer 
enough to say what the western community of states stands 
against. This community now faces the much more interesting 
challenge to say precisely what it stands for and to act 
accordingly. [applause] 
  Ladies and gentlemen; Europe is more than a political 
vision. 
In the past few decades we attempted to promote the process of 
European integration mainly economically and also to convey it 
in an economic sense. Important as the economy is, one must not 
lose sight of the political vision of this Europe, and make sure 
that the economic conditions for integration improve. Those who 
told people in Europe for decades that European integration was 
first and foremost an economic process, primarily seeking to 
increase the prosperity of the people, are making political 
opportunities smaller than they should be, and now have to face 
the justified question of how plausible this vision actually is 
when the result is that 20 million are without work on this 
continent, 4 million of these in Germany. [applause] 
  Who would dispute, Mr. Chancellor, that Konrad Adenauer, 
Ludwig Erhard, Kurt-Georg Kiesinger, Willy Brandt, Helmut 
Schmidt, and yourself have made great efforts toward European 
integration? But looking at the past is not enough. We will 
only create enthusiasm for the European process if we get across 
a clear idea of what the economic, financial, social, and 
ecological future of this continent will look like. You have 
said little on that. And even though I accept your not giving us 
details of your EU presidency before your declaration in June, a 
declaration that gets stuck in general terms and does not say 
anything on the specific conditions under which European policy 
is conducted today and how it is to be realized by the people of 
Europe, will not be nearly sufficient. [indistinct 
interjections] 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, Germany is the country facing the 
biggest social and economic gap in the EU. That means that we 
should be particularly interested in working toward decreasing 
these economic and social gaps through our own efforts and 
common initiatives. [applause] We have the lowest growth rate 
and highest unemployment rate in Europe. And there is a reason 
for this, Ladies and Gentlemen. Reasons that are also to be 
found in policies, not just in abstract, distant statements on 
structural adjustment processes that the European and German 
economies are going through. Let me explain this by way of a few 
examples: The economic capacity in the Thuringia is 28 percent 
of the EU average. Calabria has a share of 63 percent, central 
Portugal has 36 percent. That means that with Hamburg we have 
the richest economic region in Europe, at 190 percent of the EU 
average; and at the same time we have some of the economically 
weakest regions in Europe. I am asking myself... [indistinct 
interjections] I am asking myself, how it can be explained 
against this background that the Federal Government praises the 
European Commission's White Paper on Growth and Employment, 
while at the same time trying to prevent, through its European 
policy, one concrete step being taken after the other with the 
help of this White Paper. [applause] This is the reality. You 
are saying pleasant things, and you are doing the opposite of 
what you say. [applause] We would do much better, also in 
overcoming our own problems, if we did it together with Europe. 
No national economy, no bigger national economy that is, has so 
many international links as the German economy. Seventy percent 
of our exports go to the European Economic Area, 35 percent of 
our GNP comes from exports. With these figures we are far ahead 
of the United States and Japan as far as international 
interdependence goes. That is why we must be interested in a 
closer economic cooperation in Europe. And with the U.S. 
Administration considering this White Paper to be a good 
guideline for a common industrial, growth, and employment 
policy, I am surprised that the Federal Government does very 
little, next to nothing, toward a joint European promotion of 
the proposals of this White Paper for growth, employment, and 
jobs. [applause] 
  Speaking about the contradiction between word and deed, I 
also want to say something about the financial contribution that 
you fixed at the Edinburgh summit in 1992, even though you knew 
that Germany, regarding its prosperity and its citizens' 
prosperity, no longer ranked second in the EU, but seventh. 
  Those who in such a situation fix Germany's contribution 
until 1999 and are thus responsible for payment of a sum that is 
over 3 billion German marks [DM] higher than it should be, those 
who at the same time help finance a British contribution rebate 
totaling DM1.2 billion, should at least demand higher funds from 
the EU in aid for change and reconstruction in eastern Germany. 
If you fixed it -- which I consider grossly negligent -- the 
least thing we must ask you to do is to push through a higher 
return flow in structural funds and aid for reconstruction in 
eastern Germany. [applause] 
  Since you, Mr. Chancellor, do not want us to be seen by the 
public as Europe's paymaster, since you know but did not 
mention, that this may constitute a problem for the mood toward 
Europe and its acceptance by the people, you should have the 
obligation to ensure fair financial conditions within the EU. 
  Ladies and gentlemen; Europe certainly means not just 
economics. However, people are asking themselves, since European 
integration has for decades primarily been represented in 
economic terms, why is there so much unemployment? We must 
create better investment conditions in Europe, give companies a 
stable framework for investment, do more for research and 
education in Europe, develop our common infrastructure in a 
committed way and at higher financial expense, and we must make 
sure that this Europe of the citizens and regions overcome its 
deficit of democratic anchoring. [applause] 
  I mention this latter aspect because you, Mr. Chancellor, 
are 
among those who intend to give the Council of Ministers more 
responsibilities that are now in the hands of European 
institutions. In some cases, this is not in line with the goal 
to strengthen the European institutions. 
  But let me say something in connection with investment 
conditions and the development of the infrastructure. We have 
cooperated intensively and well with France. This should remain 
so on the basis of firm friendship. There are some examples of 
sound economic cooperation in Europe, especially in the 
aerospace sector. However, I ask myself why there has been 
virtually no initiative until recently not only to expand 
existing railroad lines, but to create joint railroad systems in 
the trans-European network. [applause] 
  For example, we in Germany afford ourselves the production 
of 
the ICE [Intercity Express] train, which has the banal defect of 
being too wide and too heavy to be used elsewhere in Europe. 
Mr. Chancellor, by the way, as a central element of a common 
infrastructure, the point is not just railroad tracks, but also 
power systems, and the so-called data highways with which you 
have had major difficulties -- to put it cautiously. 
  However, if a concentrated attempt is made in the triad, in 
Japan and the United States, to modernize industry ecologically 
by cooperation between science, industry, and the government, to 
increase spending on research and technology, to improve 
educational and training opportunities, I ask myself why in your 
rather general statement, you do not mention the fact that the 
backlog in Europe and Germany must be abolished. You cannot 
speak about this because in that case, you would have to speak 
about the shortcomings of your policy. [applause] 
  It is terrifying to see that in such a country as Germany, 
which has to rely more than other countries on the quality of 
its research and technology, the faster translation of their 
results into production, and the high standard of training, we 
are making only distressingly little effort in education and 
science, and we are lagging far behind, even by European 
standards. When you talk about Germany's competitive strength as 
an economic center it would be appropriate to concede that this 
kind of education and science policy, which reduces spending on 
education and intends to cut student grants so they have to 
study longer, which no longer offers any essential future 
prospects in the area of dual training, and which has lowered 
the research and technology budget to 1.9 percent of the total 
budget and made yet another DM250 million cut this year, 
constitutes a central, long-term risk for Germany as economic 
center, a risk for which you will be held responsible. 
[applause] 
  No real collective or joint efforts are being made in this 
sphere. And the results are obvious, which I will demonstrate 
with the help of a single figure: Four of every 1,000 employees 
work in the field of research and as engineers in the EU; in the 
United States this number is eight -- exactly double -- and in 
Japan it is nine. If one looks at these figures and also at the 
developments regarding patents, one becomes aware that, unless 
we manage to improve European cooperation in the areas of 
research and technology, science, universities, and major 
research institutes, and unless we manage to translate the 
results thus received faster and jointly in Europe into 
technological and economic reality, then this continent will 
remain the part of the world where unemployment is highest and 
where growth rates are lowest. 
  Mr. Chancellor, it would be good and important for you to 
comment on this issue so that empty words and Sunday speeches on 
the undeniable achievements of the EU and the shared past do not 
create the belief here that we are living in safe conditions in 
Europe because -- particularly from the economic, technological, 
and social point of view -- we unfortunately do not. [applause] 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, apart from much closer cooperation on 
the basis of the European Commission White Paper on Growth and 
Employment, the Fight Against Unemployment, and the Preservation 
of Social Rights, it would be essential to improve cooperation 
in Europe, especially in the last field. It is correct when you 
say that some of the things that are incorporated in the 
guidelines were forced into it by the national governments, and 
that, consequently, the protest against a certain bureaucracy in 
Europe would actually have to be directed against those who are 
responsible for them in the nation states. You made a 
self-critical remark, and I would like to add another one. 
  The parties that stand behind your policy speak a lot about 
deregulation, and as far as flexibility, investments, and the 
labor markets are concerned, one cannot say much against it. 
Yet why have you obstructed regulations and guidelines -- some 
for years -- intended to help make Europe more homogeneous, to 
protect people's social rights more effectively, and why do you 
still obstruct the European Commission's desire -- to mention 
only this one example --that foreign workers on German building 
sites be paid according to the conditions of the country in 
which they work and get paid, rather that the less favorable 
working and pay conditions that are based on conditions in the 
worker's country of origin. [applause] 
  Those who talk about unemployment and the competitiveness 
of enterprises must ensure fair conditions of competition. 
Illegal employment, for example, and the blocking of such 
guidelines do not have anything to do with fair conditions of 
competition. [applause] 
  Why are you still blocking the guidelines for the so-called 
atypical working conditions, which are not so atypical? If, on 
the one hand, you advocate part-time work to reduce 
unemployment, why do you not say anything about the 10 million 
male and female temporary workers in Europe -- there are far 
more women than men -- who cannot work with social security and 
in safety because of your policy? It is high time something be 
done here [applause] because if we do not also create a Europe 
with its vision of a joint economic and strong future and of 
joint social security on such concrete questions, that is, 
including the question of codetermination in European 
enterprises, then you cannot expect acceptance, enthusiasm, and 
commitment in Europe, but this mixture of indifference and 
weariness will be final, although we need enthusiasm to cope 
with Europe's future. [applause] 
  Why are you still blocking appropriate opportunities in 
connection with the reporting on poverty? I could give many 
examples. But I still want to take up what you said in 
connection with internal security. I think that this is highly 
interesting. It was a beautiful sentence. We have to give the 
right answer to this challenge. What is it? When our highly 
esteemed chancellor makes a statement here in this house... I 
should add: our highly esteemed compatriot, because one has to 
be a little careful, Madam President... 
  [Kohl, interrupting] I would make a point by stating that we 
are not compatriots! 
  [Scharping] Since you are so narrow-minded as to call 
yourself only a Palatine, and not a Rhineland-Palatine, this is 
all right. In that case we are not compatriots. [applause] 
  This may be the case. I only wanted to point out the 
following: We have to produce the right answer to this 
challenge. Mr. Chancellor, it is not only your duty to raise 
questions or generally to use nice formulations, but to be 
specific. Therefore, I am wondering, regarding, for example, 
the fight against drug crime, which you were completely right to 
bring up as central point, why your government is still blocking 
blows against the central nervous system of this crime, that is, 
its financial profits. Why? [applause] 
  I know very well that some of you propose the protection of 
property. But how do you propose to get hold of those who sit 
in Colombia or elsewhere and are responsible for the DM250 
billion that is being channeled into Europe? How is this 
supposed to work? Do you first want to bring them to trial in 
Germany and have them sentenced before touching their property? 
I think that this is a grossly negligent policy. [applause] 
It not only goes against legal tradition of our Western 
partners, particularly the United States, but it also goes 
against the people's need for security. Thank God, so far it is 
still the case that the majority of people also associate the 
chance of greater internal security with open borders. This is 
the judgment of the majority. 
  But I predict that if you intend to continue this policy, 
you will not ensure security in Europe. [applause] 
  So, growth and employment, combating unemployment, 
preserving 
and guaranteeing social rights in Europe, improving the natural 
bases of life instead of taking environmental protection 
measures after the harm has been done -- all these are areas in 
which this Federal Government cannot achieve much in Europe, 
because you have failed in this area in your country. [applause] 
  Or do you seriously believe that Finance Minister Waigel is 
particularly credible in Europe by calling for stable finances 
in Europe but being responsible at home for the highest debt 
Germany has ever had? [applause, shouts] It may be unpleasant 
for you, but it is a fact. 
  Of course, the criteria of the Maastricht Treaty are more 
important than the timeframe. But what is the situation in 
connection with the criteria? Apart from the fact that others 
do not meet them either, you have pursued a financial policy 
that has led to a continuously increasing tax burden, especially 
for medium and normal income earners, a tax burden of over DM100 
billion for the people every year, and nonetheless, you are 
responsible for state debt totaling DM2000 billion every year -- 
DM65,000 per capita in Germany. [applause] 
  It is quite interesting for me to see that you have become 
more lively. It is an Achilles' heel for you. I understand 
very well that at the very moment we no longer speak in general 
terms, but mention the specific problems of German and European 
policy, not only the differences, but also the serious 
shortcomings of your own policy, come to light. [applause] 
  In this respect, I wish to mention one last point. I spoke 
of a perspective of the European states, which for current EU 
members must consist of deepening, and for other European 
countries, of enlargement. The chance to improve economic 
conditions, restore social justice, and ensure the protection of 
the bases of life, is not only a problem for our own country. 
It can be solved better in European concert. 
  Europe was, is, and remains the vision of a peaceful 
continent through integration and growing together. However, if 
this is to remain so, we must resist the old nationalism, which 
creates new radicalism. [applause] It is amazing that there is 
so much talk about the Europe of the citizens and regions, but 
it is a truth that the German laender had to defend their 
regional rights to be able to maintain their regional identity. 
  It is also a truth that perspectives of cooperation must be 
developed not only in economic and security policy terms, but 
that, like all our other European partners and neighbors, we in 
Germany must also think about the causes of nationalism and 
about ways to combat them. 
  I think it is regrettable that virtually nothing has been 
said in this respect. I clearly state that the participation of 
neofascists in the Italian government is an alarming signal. 
[applause] 
  I am ready to admit that, because of the necessities of 
cooperation, a federal chancellor and a foreign minister cannot 
make as tough statements as others can -- and must, in my view. 
That is why I understand that the federal chancellor and the 
foreign minister maintain a low profile, but I do not understand 
that members of the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social 
Union [CDU/CSU] do not comment as clearly on this topic as is 
every democrat's duty. [applause] I have looked very closely at 
what the Bavarian government said in this respect. 
  And, I am also saying this to you, Mr. Chancellor; it would 
be important to make it clear that humanitarianism and 
civilization have to be defended anew and fought for day after 
day. This has become obvious not only with the example of 
Yugoslavia, but also by the burning homes, the fighting 
demonstrators, the young people who chase foreigners, and many 
other things that we have experienced in Germany and other 
neighboring countries in Europe. It would be good if 
politicians were to assume a clear and unambiguous position 
here. And as a senior representative of our state, this applies 
to you, too. [applause] 
  I shall not forget these things, nor the reasons that make 
such phenomena possible in the first place: social despair and 
unemployment. How do you propose to talk to a young person in 
eastern Germany about the future when 25 percent of them have to 
join the lines of the unemployed after their vocational 
training, and when they even know that beforehand, during their 
training? If, however, you do not do anything against the 
economic and social problems in our country and on our 
continent, then you will not eradicate the roots for new 
radicalism, for violence, and for hatred against those who are 
weaker. [applause] 
  It was almost exactly a year ago that a house was set on 
fire 
in Solingen. Mr. Chancellor, I thought it was a fateful mistake 
of yours to speak sympathetically, yet to say that you would not 
attend the funeral ceremony because it would lead to 
demonstrations. [applause] 
  To leave no doubts about my party's position and my personal 
political view, I would like to add that, in our opinion, he who 
sets fire to other people's homes or puts their lives or health 
at risk is a hooligan and must be put in prison. And those 
paving the way for them must be kept out of German parliaments. 
[applause] 
  To add a conciliatory statement to the discussion of the 
past 
few days, I would like to say that it is good to know that the 
newly elected federal president has made an absolutely clear 
statement on this issue, something I would wish from you as 
well, Mr. Kohl. [applause] 
  Ladies and gentlemen, by way of summing up, I would like to 
say that I respect the efforts made by this Federal Government. 
I also respect that this federal chancellor advocates personal 
convictions, which, however, raise two questions. One question 
is what the position of his own party is, and particularly that 
of the Bavarian CSU. The second question is: Can you agree -- 
and I really consider this to be important -- that we 
politicians have the duty not to come up with nice statements, 
general declarations, or lofty words, but with concrete deeds. 
[applause] The problem of your policy is not the nice words 
that you say or the goals that you define, but the truly great 
difference between what you say and what you do in reality. If 
you do not want to face a debate on political reality, which 
makes it possible to weigh what you actually want to convey with 
your words, then you are also contributing to the people's 
disenchantment with politics, because the arbitrariness of 
concepts is often confounded with the arbitrariness of politics. 
  Ladies and gentlemen; in terms of words, the government's 
policy on Europe can scarcely be faulted, but in terms of deeds 
it is often incomplete and half-hearted, particularly where jobs 
and people's social rights are at stake, as well as our future 
competitiveness, research, technology, education, and science, 
and the preservation of the natural basis for our life, so that 
our children can have a decent future. [applause]

<F P=106> [Report by Maurizio Ricci: "Berlusconi's Anger: `No </F>
Danger'"] 
  [Text] Rome -- An angry and impassioned response followed a 
little over an hour of feverish consultations after ANSA and AGI 
press agencies relayed the AFP and Reuters reports of the 
interview French President Mitterrand granted to LA REPUBBLICA 
and four other major European newspapers. This time the subject 
of the controversy is not a confused vote by what is little more 
than an honorary body -- namely, the European Parliament; or a 
remark by a former prime minister, who is now merely a party 
leader -- namely, Michel Rocard. In the case of an incumbent 
chief of state, who is also one of the most authoritative 
political figures of the European Union -- namely, Francois 
Mitterrand -- the Berlusconi government decided to treat it as a 
diplomatic incident. 
<H5>  Spiteful Reference </H5>
  "Nothing frightening has happened in Italy," the Palazzo 
Chigi [prime minister's office] replied tersely. "The majority 
and the government that the Italian people have chosen in no way 
represent anything suspicious. Our country's media and the 
institutions operate in a context of freedom and observance of 
the law." But this time the note was not confined to a defense 
of the recent election result, and proceeds from an attack, 
using language more appropriate to a newspaper editorial than to 
a diplomatic document. "Nobody in our country would ever dream 
of passing judgment on the conditions of legitimacy in which 
public powers are exercised in the allied democracies -- even 
less for the purposes of a domestic political struggle." This 
latter was a spiteful reference -- the insinuation that the 
French chief of state spoke mainly as the leader of a Socialist 
Party defeated in the elections, divided, and in difficulties; 
and that his aim was to hit the victorious French Right of 
Edouard Balladur, much more than Berlusconi. The conclusion is 
very terse, too: "Self-control and respect for others, however, 
are virtues that demand reciprocity." 
  This was enough to make it clear that the wound inflicted by 
the interview to the traditionally cordial relations between 
Rome and Paris will be difficult to heal -- if not for French 
diplomacy, then certainly for the Elysee Palace [French 
president's office], at least until its incumbent changes next 
year. Italian diplomatic circles yesterday evening were 
wondering, entirely informally, whether the incident would have 
repercussions in the coming weeks --which will bring some 
important decisions for the future of the EC (starting with the 
appointment of Delors' successor) -- on the two countries' 
choice of alignment. Traditionally, it is Mitterrand who has 
both formulated and represented France's European policy. And 
in recent weeks the Berlusconi government has made it known that 
Italy's traditional alliance with Paris and Bonn on the policy 
of European federalism can no longer be taken for granted and 
that Rome is paying increasing attention to London and to 
Britain's ideas about the development of the European Union. 
  But this scenario has nothing to do with yesterday's 
response 
from the Palazzo Chigi. When the ANSA and AGI bulletins, 
relaying the international agency reports, reached the Palazzo 
Chigi at about 1900 hours yesterday, the ill feeling which 
emerged did not concern European policy but probably related to 
the much older issue of Berlusconi's and Fininvest's 
unsuccessful attempts to extend their presence in French 
television, frustrated (as in Britain) not only by rigid 
antitrust laws but also by the explicit mistrust of the French 
political world. Indeed, it was the thrust of Mitterrand's 
accusations and anxieties that stung. 
  Indeed, the French president shifted the focus of the 
polemics against the new Italian Government over the anxieties 
repeatedly expressed on several sides in recent weeks concerning 
the presence in it of Fascist ministers. On this point the 
French president, while standing by his earlier statements, 
seemed very prudent, ruled our any immediate threats, and 
"placed his confidence in the Italian people." 
<H5>  Unsure Ground </H5>
  But Mitterrand sank his knife into a political area in which 
the Berlusconi government feels much less secure and more 
exposed. Italian legislation on television is already much more 
accommodating to conglomerates, and Fininvest's hegemony has 
already been the subject of criticisms. Mitterrand's anxieties 
about his transfer to politics and then the government are 
rekindling the most dangerous controversies in Italy which, 
unlike those over the presence of National Alliance ministers, 
involve even the majority forces -- more openly the League, less 
explicitly the National Alliance.

<F P=106> [Article signed GGD/RHR: "No Formal Agreement With Moscow </F>
on Relations With NATO"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 25 May (BELGA) -- NATO Deputy Secretary 
General Sergio Balanzino on Wednesday [25 May] ruled out the 
signing of a formal agreement with Russia on starting 
consultations between Moscow and the Atlantic alliance. 
  Sergio Balanzino said: "A formal protocol has been ruled out 
by the Council (the North Atlantic Council, comprising the 16 
NATO countries)." He was speaking in Brussels at a news 
conference at the end of a meeting of NATO and East European 
defense ministers. 
  General Pavel Grachev, Russian defense minister, for his 
part 
stated outside the meeting that Russia would unconditionally 
join the Partnership for Peace (PFP) proposed by NATO to the 
other European countries, and essentially to its former 
adversaries of the Warsaw Pact. On Wednesday morning, however, 
he requested that a permanent mechanism be set up for 
consultation with the alliance. 
  However, Mr. Balanzino, replacing NATO Secretary General 
Woerner, who was officially absent so as not to interrupt his 
period of convalescence, said that if Russia were to join the 
PFP it would have no access or veto rights on decisions made by 
the Atlantic alliance. 
  Mr. Balanzino repeated that Moscow will also have to sign 
the 
same document as the other Partnership countries. 
  He continued: "We trust there will be no changes to the PFP 
framework document that Russia will sign. This document is 
exactly the same for everyone." 
  He did, however, accept that the great sway held by Russia 
as 
the second great power and a permanent member of the UN Security 
Council will be "taken into consideration" in the dialogue to be 
established on a "step by step" basis between the alliance and 
Moscow.

<F P=106> [Article signed GGD/MAR/RHR: "Delcroix Does Not Rule Out </F>
Automatic NATO-Russia Consultations"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 25 May (BELGA) -- Speaking on Wednesday 
[25 May], Belgian Defense Minister Leo Delcroix did not rule out 
the establishment of automatic consultations between NATO and 
Russia. He told the BRTN [Dutch-language Belgian Radio and 
Television]: "I am not `a priori' opposed to such consultations." 
  According to the Belgian minister, setting up such a 
consultation process would not be tantamount to giving Russia 
the right to veto NATO decisions. Futhermore, he added that 
these consultations could be very useful, as in the case of 
Bosnia, for example. 
  Mr. Delcroix termed "positive" the comments of Russian 
General Pavel Grachev, who participated in the meetings with 
NATO defense ministers on Tuesday and Wednesday. Delcroix said: 
"A degree of confusion has reigned in Moscow in recent weeks 
concerning Russia's membership of the `Partnership for Peace 
(PFP),' a program of increased cooperation between NATO and the 
other European countries, essentially those in the East." 
  As we recall, General Grachev stated on Tuesday evening that 
Russia would join the PFP unconditionally, but then on Wednesday 
morning requested the establishment of a permanent mechanism for 
consultation between Moscow and the Atlantic alliance. 
  Mr. Delcroix also stated that it was logical for another 
channel to be opened between NATO and Moscow, although, he 
added, "that does not mean they will have any guarantees." 
  According to the minister, it is necessary for Russia to 
first join the PFP: "We must take account of the 18 countries 
who have already joined the PFP before we can talk of forging 
closer links with Moscow." He believes that Russia could sign 
in June. 
  Mr. Delcroix added that he did not approve of Russia's 
proposal to give the CSCE priority over NATO. He stressed that 
the CSCE is too large a forum (BELGA editor's note: comprising 
52 countries from Europe, North America and Central Asia) to be 
truly functional.

  [Text] Brussels, May 25 (CTK) -- Slovak Defense Minister 
Pavol Kanis, who represents Slovakia at the current North 
Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC), today handed the 
presentation document to the Partnership for Peace plan to NATO 
Under-Secretary-General Sergio Balanzin. 
  The document contains proposals for concrete forms of 
cooperation with NATO. It stresses the need for the Slovak Army 
to attain such a degree of "compatibility and inter-operability" 
which is necessary for smooth cooperation and for Slovakia's 
later integration into the NATO military structures. 
  Slovakia is interested in cooperation particularly in the 
areas of defense planning, legislation, command and management, 
human resources management and crisis management, deployment of 
armed forces for humanitarian assistance and in the case of 
nature disasters, communications and information systems, in 
logistics and in military science and research. 
  Slovakia has been the sixth country to submit its 
presentation document in Brussels and the first former communist 
country to publish the document in full and to give it to 
journalists.

<F P=106> [EC Press Release No. IP/94/425: "EU and Kazakhstan Initial </F>
Partnership 
and Cooperation Agreement"] 
  [Text] The European Commission and the authorities of the 
Republic of Kazakhstan have initialised a Partnership and 
Cooperation Agreement between the EU and Kazakhstan. The 
agreement aims to provide a solid global framework for the 
development of deeper relations between the two parties. 
  In October 1992 the EC Council of Ministers adopted 
negotiating directives for the negotiation of partnership and 
cooperation agreements with countries of the former Soviet 
Union. In the course of 1993 and 1994, two rounds of 
negotiations with the Republic of Kazakhstan were held on the 
basis of these negotiating directives. The negotiations have now 
been concluded. 
  The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement will replace the 
Trade and Cooperation Agreement of 1989 between the EC and the 
Soviet Union as far as the Republic of Kazakhstan is concerned. 
  The agreement covers in particular the following 
areas: 

  -  political dialogue; 
  -  trade in goods; 
  -  provisions 
affecting business and investment, including labour conditions 
and establishment and operation of companies; 
  -  cross-border 
supply of services; 
  -  payments and capital; 
  -  intellectual, 
industrial and commercial property protection; 
  -  economic 
cooperation in many areas. 

  The general principles of the agreement state democratic 
values, respect for human rights and market economy principles 
as essential elements of the partnership established by the 
agreement. The general principles also state that the parties 
consider it essential for the future prosperity and stability in 
the region of the former Soviet Union that regional cooperation 
should be continued and strengthened. 
  The agreement foresees an intensive political dialogue, 
including the possibility of meetings at the highest political 
level. Trade in goods will take place on the basis of 
most-favoured-nation treatment with a general rule curbing 
quantitative restrictions in line with the Community's new 
commercial defence policy. Specific agreements will be 
negotiated in the case of coal and steel products and as regards 
trade in nuclear materials. An agreement on trade in textile 
products is already in force. 
  In terms of labour conditions the agreement calls on the 
parties to prevent discrimination between legally employed 
workers. 
  As far as conditions for the establishment and operation of 
companies are concerned, the agreement establishes a liberal 
regime with Kazakhstan offering full national treatment for 
establishment and operation of community companies. 
  The agreement stipulates with limited exceptions a free flow 
of capital payments in particular those related to trade in 
goods and direct investments. 
  The agreement provides a timetable for the rapid development 
of intellectual, industrial and commercial property protection 
in Kazakhstan equal to the level of protection in the EU. 
  In the field of economic cooperation the agreement lists 
agreed principles and areas of future possible cooperation in 
the following fields: Industrial cooperation, investment 
promotion and protection, public procurement, standards and 
conformity assessments, mining and raw materials, science and 
technology, education and training, agriculture and 
agro-industry, energy, the civil nuclear sector (including 
cooperation on the effect of the Chernobyl disaster), 
environment, transport, space, telecommunications, financial 
services, money laundering, monetary policy, regional 
development, social cooperation, tourism, small and medium sized 
enterprises, information and communication, consumer protection, 
customs, statistical cooperation, economics and drugs. 
  Cooperation in these fields may, as appropriate, be 
supported 
by technical assistance from the European Union through the 
TACIS [Technical Assistance to the Commonwealth of Independent 
States] programme, which finances moves to economic reform in 
the former USSR republics. 
  The agreement finally establishes an institutional framework 
for future cooperation, including a cooperation council that 
will meet at ministerial level once a year, as well as a 
parliamentary cooperation committee.

<F P=106> [Article signed LVE (JWI): "Stability: The Stability Pact </F>
Must Be an `Encouragement'"] 
  [Text] Paris, 26 May (BELGA) -- Belgian Foreign Minister 
Willy Claes emphasized Thursday [26 May] that the stability pact 
in Europe was meant to "encourage" the countries of Central and 
Eastern Europe to prepare to join the European Union (EU). 
  "The process leading to the stability pact must encourage 
those countries which have been offered the chance to prepare to 
join the EU by concluding reciprocal good-neighborliness 
agreements," Claes stated in a speech given to the plenary 
conference on stability in Europe, which is being held in Paris 
over a two-day period. 
  In so doing, the Belgian foreign minister was implicitly 
sweeping aside the reluctance on the part of some Central and 
Eastern European countries that could view such a pact as 
nothing more than an extra condition imposed on their entry to 
the Union. 
  "The stability pact is intended to serve as an instrument of 
dialogue (...) between the countries concerned and the EU. 
Future accession in fact necessarily presupposes close, 
constant contact between all those involved," Willy Claes 
underlined. 
  Furthermore, the Belgian foreign minister reiterated that 
the 
deepening of European construction should not be called into 
question by the EU enlargement. "If Europe has become a pole of 
stability, it is primarily because its members have concluded 
mutual political agreements," he said. 
  Consequently, the EU is calling upon the future candidates 
for accession (the three Baltic states, the four [as received] 
Visegrad countries: the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland and 
Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria -- BELGA editor's note) to settle 
their potential differences peacefully. It is also prepared "to 
play an active role in helping them to bring their friendship 
and good-neighborliness agreements to a successful conclusion," 
Willy Claes continued. 
  Meanwhile, French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur traced out 
the broad outlines of his plan, which "is clearly shaped by a 
vision of Europe that aims to reconcile the wish to join the EU, 
as harbored by many countries, with the need to maintain the 
unity of our continent and consequently develop very close 
relations with Russia," he said during his speech which opened 
the conference. Mr. Balladur also took pains to calm the fears 
of certain countries regarding borders. The negotiations that 
are supposed to lead to good-neighborliness agreements will be 
based on legal principles that are "clear and recognized by 
everyone," namely territorial integrity and the inviolability of 
borders," he affirmed. 
  "Let us be very clear about this: We want to see stable 
European borders. So let us make sure that there are no 
ulterior motives regarding them," he added.

  [Text] Paris ROMPRES, 26/5/1994 -- At the Conference on 
Stability in Europe, which commenced Thursday, 26 May, in Paris, 
with the participation of over 40 foreign ministers, Romania is 
represented by Teodor Melescanu, minister of foreign affairs. 
  Mr. Melescanu had a meeting with his French counterpart, 
Alain Juppe, and with France's minister for European affairs, 
Alain Lamassoure. This enabled the sides to approach, besides 
matters connected to the conference in progress, the calendar of 
the bilateral political relations for the year running. 
  The sides also discussed some economic projects agreed upon 
during the recent visit to Paris of Romania's President Ion 
Iliescu, and analyzed the prospect that the presidency of the 
European Union be taken over by Germany and France. 
  Also today, Foreign Minister Melescanu met with his Slovak 
counterpart, Eduard Kukan.

<F P=106> [EC Document No. DOC/IP/94/413: "Commission Adopts Its 23th </F>
Annual Competition Report -- A Comprehensive Analysis of The 
Commission Activities"] 
  [Text] Acting on a proposal from Mr. Karel van Miert the 
Commission has published its 23d annual competition report. As 
in previous years the report covers all aspects of competition 
policy: 
  - mergers 
  - state aids (art 92-94) 
  - liberalisation of regulated sectors (e.g. telecoms, air 
transport) 
  - international aspects of competition policy 
  - cartels, and other agreements between companies that 
restrict competition (art 85) 
  - abuses of dominant positions (art 86) 
  This widely circulated 380 page long report gives not only 
an 
in-depth review of the activities of the Commission during 1993 
in the field of competition policy (including all significant 
cases treated) but also sets out the general principles 
underpinning competition policy. In addition it sets out 
priorities and objectives for the future. This report will be 
the object of an active exchange of views between the Commission 
on the one hand and the Parliament, the Council, and the 
Economic and Social Committee on the other hand. 
  In view of the growing importance of the liberalisation of 
regulated sectors and of increasing competition in the service 
sectors (e.g. banking, insurance, audiovisual) where previously 
competition policy was not deeply developed, this years report 
explains in depth the link between these sectors and competition 
policy. It also explains in depth the link between competition 
policy, the internal market, industrial restructuring and the 
unemployment crisis, the Maastricht Treaty and the international 
context. 
<H5>  Statistical Overview </H5>
  A statistical analysis of the individual cases handled by 
the 
207 A-grade staff shows a positive balance. As regards art 85/6, 
  - 832 cases were finished which means that the backlog of 
old 
cases has been eliminated and only those under active 
investigation remain. Of the 1231 cases under investigation, 60 
percent (749) are notifications, 25 percent complaints (335) and 
15 percent (147) are cases where the Commission started 
investigations on its own initiative. An interesting fact is 
the growing number of complaints, a trend expected to accelerate 
as the internal market develops into a reality. 
  In line with the principle of subsidiarity, the Commission 
continued to refer cases to national courts, when they were best 
placed to treat them. 
  - for mergers 58 cases were treated. The majority (50) did 
not raise any problems and were rapidly approved. Four cases 
did not constitute mergers in the sense of the merger regulation 
but were treated under art 85/6. The remaining four cases were 
subject to an in-depth second phase investigation. Although 
there were no final negative decisions, in three cases the 
Commission was forced to impose conditions on the deals in 
question in order to prevent the creation or strengthening of 
dominant positions of the parties involved. The application of 
the merger regulation thus continues to permit the restructuring 
of EC industry required by the internal market and growing 
international competition whilst at the same time preserving the 
advantages of competition. 
  - state aid is another area where we see both an increasing 
number of complaints as well as more case involving newly 
liberalized industries and the service sector. In 1993 435 
cases were decided of which 399 were to raise no objections 
after an initial examination. The remainder (36) warranted in 
depth scrutiny because of the problems they raised. Some of 
these are still under examination although there have already 
been 19 positive decisions and 7 negative decisions. In 
addition the Commission proposed to the Council 11 decisions for 
steel in the framework of the ECSC Treaty. 
<H5>  Internal Market -- Vigilance To Make it a Reality </H5>
  1993 was a significant year for the Community and 
competition 
policy in particular: The entry into force of the internal 
market. If this is to be a success and the forecast economic 
benefits released not only do we need the legal framework (now 
largely achieved) but companies must increasingly compete. They 
must not be discouraged from competing by unfair state aids, 
state maintained monopolies or agreements between companies to 
divide up markets along traditional grounds. The effective 
enforcement of competition policy becomes critical. As markets 
are opened up anti-competitive practices (be they state inspired 
or stem from private agreements between companies) have an 
increasingly negative impact -- thus the enhanced vigilance of 
the Commission. 
  Restructuring and Crisis -- Competition's Role 
  The internal market, along with increasing international 
competition and rapid technological change, is forcing European 
Industry to restructure. This restructuring is taking place 
during unacceptably high levels of unemployment. The 
Commission's response is given in the White Paper on Growth, 
Competitiveness, and Unemployment. Restructuring and 
cooperation must be facilitated but competitive structures, 
which in themselves encourage positive adjustment must be 
maintained. This year's report explains how competition policy 
will react to the political priorities of the White Paper and 
how it can help achieve the objectives the Community has set 
itself. 
<H5>  Maastricht -- New Objectives Interact With Competition </H5>
  1993 marked the entry into force of the Maastricht Union 
Treaty. In particular the principle of subsidiarity and the 
formal inclusion of industrial, cultural and environmental 
policy goals in this Treaty will have implications for the 
application of competition policy. 
  In the case of the environment the interaction with 
competition is a two way process in that not only will be 
environmental goals influence competition policy but the 
achievement of environmentally sustainable growth, with the 
structural changes this implies, needs an active competition 
policy. 
<H5>  International Context -- A Growth Area For Competition Policy </H5>
  1993 also marked two very significant events in the 
international field: The conclusion of the GATT Uruguay Round 
and the ratification of the European Economic Space (EES) with 
the EFTA members which both have a large and direct impact on 
competition policy. They both illustrate the wider principle: 
as markets globalize and government imposed barriers are 
eliminated, it becomes imperative to eliminate anti-competitive 
agreements between companies that can split up markets or create 
barriers to entry to new markets. The EES gives a common set of 
competition rules for EU and EFTA member states. The new GATT 
round may include competition provisions. In fact this is an 
area where the Commission is already active, with agreements 
with the US and East European countries already in force or 
under negotiation. The link between globalisation of trade, 
trade policy, reduction of trade barriers and competition policy 
are examined in this years report. 
<H5>  Steel and Telecoms -- Two Major Events in 1993 </H5>
  The steel and telecoms were two major dossiers treated in 
1993. Whilst they both raise totally different issues, they 
illustrate very well the context within which competition policy 
must be applied. 
  - steel: It was clear that major restructuring and capacity 
reduction must take place with account taken of the social 
dimension, especially labour run down in high unemployment 
areas. We Must also ensure equal treatment of public and private 
steel companies. Therefore any state aid given must be 
accompanied by an appropriate capacity reduction. Italy, Spain, 
and the five new Lander were the main areas involved with state 
aids. As regards companies the Commission asked them to reduce 
capacity themselves without anti-competitive cartels which it 
will not tolerate. Whilst several decisions were made during 
1993 the problem is still an ongoing one. 
  - telecoms: This industry employs over 1m and is growing 
rapidly. An efficient telecommunication network is vital for 
the conduct of modern business as well as becoming an 
increasingly indispensable to all households. Although some 
progress had already been made to liberalise terminal equipment 
and value added services, telecoms was characterised by national 
monopolies. After an indepth study and consultation, the 
Commission put its proposals to the Council who accepted the 
need for full voice liberalization by 1998. Although many 
flanking measures still need to be undertaken before full 
liberalisation can become a reality, the acceptation of the 
principle is a major step forward. The Commission will be 
particularly vigilant to ensure a balance between on the one 
hand competition and the efficiency it will bring and on the 
other the necessity of maintaining a universal service 
affordable for all domestic customers.

<F P=106> [Lionel Barber report: "Brussels Points the Finger at </F>
Fiscal Laggards"] 
  [Text] The European Commission yesterday pointed the 
finger at EU [European Union] member states which it considers 
are not doing enough to curb budget deficits and restrain 
inflation. 
  Dropping its usual diplomatic language, the Commission 
singled out France and Denmark for lax fiscal policy along with 
more familiar laggards led by Spain, Greece, Italy, and Portugal. 
  The UK, which has introduced record tax increases to curb a 
50 billion pound budget deficit, escapes criticism on the fiscal 
side. But Mr John Major's government receives an unwelcome 
warning from Brussels about the risks of inflation. 
  The criticism appears in an update of the Commission's 
macroeconomic guidelines which are intended to serve as a 
blueprint for the EU to the end of the century and a framework 
for achieving a single currency. 
  Union heads of government approved the first version of the 
guidelines at the Brussels summit last December. The latest 
paper has been adjusted to take account of the economic recovery 
now under way in Europe. 
  Mr Henning Christophersen, the economics commissioner, 
stressed the importance of reducing budget deficits. He 
expressed concern about the recent rise in long-term interest 
rates in Europe and said measures should be taken to reduce them 
so as not to harm the recovery. The Commission paper calls for 
a "clear confirmation" in member states' 1995 budgets that 
fiscal consolidation is under way. It urged Belgium to match its 
budget targets, and called on Spain, Portugal and Greece to 
embark on long-term budget pruning. 
  The Commission also noted that in Denmark and France "it is 
important to ensure that the fiscal expansion is reversed as the 
economy gains momentum." 
  On inflation rates, the Commission says Spain, Portugal, 
Italy and Britain have yet to decline into the range set by the 
macroeconomic guidelines. Its prediction that Italy and the UK 
"are expected to approach it significantly next year" may 
irritate Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor of the exchequer, who 
has already clashed with Brussels over its lower growth forecast 
for the UK.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "European Union/Italy: Labor </F>
Eurodeputies on `Neofascist Commissioners'"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Brussels, May 22 -- Labor deputies in the 
European Parliament Sunday [22 May] threatened to spark an 
institutional crisis within the European Union [EU] should any 
Italian neofascists be named to the European Commission which is 
to be renewed in January 1995. 
  A communique released here by the Socialist group in the 
European Parliament said that the threat was contained in a 
letter that Labor leader Pauline Green had sent to British 
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd. In the letter, Green claimed 
that the Labor deputies would refuse to vote for the investiture 
of a new Commission as called for by the Maastricht Treaty, if 
Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi were to name a neofascist to 
the European Commission. The threatened move is backed by 
Labor's allies in the largest political group in the European 
Parliament, she said, and if carried out would plunge the EU 
immediately into "an unprecedented crisis." 
  The document went on to say that the Commission would be 
politically paralyzed if it did not obtain the approval of the 
only institution within the European Union which was directly 
elected. 
  Green concluded by announcing that Labor deputies and their 
Socialist allies in the European Parliament would refuse to 
cooperate with any fascist minister and would veto any attempt 
to name a neofascist as a Commission member.

<F P=106> [Leonard Doyle article: "Ever Closer Union is Looking Less </F>
Attractive to Voters"] 
  [Text] An anti-federalist mood is growing in Europe that 
could alter the balance of power in the next European 
Parliament. The irony is that the first elections under the 
"Citizenship of the Union" provisions of the Maastricht treaty 
could end up slowing the moves to "ever closer union." 
  Euro-sceptic British Tories and the growing ranks of fellow 
travellers in Europe are not about to win a numerical majority 
in the next Parliament -- far from it. But disillusionment has 
set in among a sizeable percentage of the EU's [European Union] 
255 million citizens; doubts and uncertainties about the brave 
new world of Euro-federalism are gnawing away at the electorate. 
Instead of galvanising voters for the challenges ahead, 
Maastricht has created a jagged faultline in European politics 
and the elections should tell a lot about the way people feel 
about the experiment. 
  The pain involved in ratifying Maastricht revealed how 
politicians across Europe were losing touch with voters. 
Coupled with the failure of the EU to bring peace to the former 
Yugoslavia or end the cycle of recession and unemployment, 
scepticism on the merits of Euro-federalism has taken hold. If 
voters intend to send any clear message in the elections, the 
polls suggest that it will be to dampen the ardour of the 
Euro-romantics who want to build a United States of Europe. 
More than grandiose plans for a new world power, the electorate 
seems to want jobs, economic prosperity and strict limits on 
immigration, all without diluting the power of national 
governments. 
  Voters are expected to turn out in small numbers, the most 
derisory turn-out of all being in Britain, where in 1979 only 
36.2 per cent bothered to vote. Those who do vote generally do 
so for national rather than European reasons, but even so the 
results will have EU-wide consequences. 
  In Britain, the election is bound to become a referendum on 
John Major's future, but the results could tip the balance for 
several parties in Strasbourg. 
  The Labour Party is due to increase its seats from 49 
possibly to 60, ensuring that it dominates even more the largest 
EU parliamentary group, the European Socialists. At the same 
time, the Liberal Democrats, who have never had a popularly 
elected MEP [Member of the European Parliament], are due to win 
four or five seats. They will then be an important force in the 
European liberal group. At the same time, this group is 
expected to lose seats overall as the Portuguese Social 
Democrats leave to join the European People's Party (EPP). 
Meanwhile the Italian liberals are expected to collapse and the 
German liberals, the FDP, may not even make it to the new 
Parliament. 
  In bald terms, the new parliament should have a clear 
Socialist majority, with as many as 220 members compared with 
the present 197 and an agenda that focuses on unemployment and 
the environment. Though still committed to a federal Europe, the 
Socialist group dominated by the UK Labour Party has come to 
realise that calling for more federalism is not the vote-winner 
it once was. 
  The main opposition, the European People's Party -- 
predominantly Christian Democratic and Euro-enthusiastic -- is 
expected to undergo the greatest change of all and to see its 
vision of a "federal government" for Europe watered down as 
voter scepticism works its way through the system. Just how 
strong a force the centre-right group will be depends on many 
factors. How badly the Tories do, for a start. An alliance of 
Tories, Gaullists and a new crop of Italians from the ruling 
coalition party, Forza Italia, could form an influential group 
within or around the EPP. The main objective of this would be 
to put a brake on further EU "deepening." 
  Julie Smith, author of a new study for the Royal Institute 
of 
International Affairs, "Citizen's Europe, the European Elections 
and the Role of the European Parliament," predicts that the 
coming elections "stand to alter the party balance in parliament 
very significantly". 
  In Spain, the ruling Socialists -- federalists to the bone 
-- 
are about to be trounced. Corruption scandals in the ruling 
Socialist PSOE have given a boost to the opposition Popular 
Party (PP) and the EU enlargement has caused anxieties about 
Spain's position. 
  Germany has always embraced the federal agenda but the EU 
paymaster is now facing popular doubts about the loss of 
national sovereignty and even the disappearance of the mark in a 
future monetary union. 
  In Belgium, important changes are occurring, with people 
expressing hostility to more shifts in power to the EU. They 
could send a strong message to politicians by voting for the 
extreme-right Vlaams Bloc, or for the Greens who resent the 
proliferation of EU institutions in their capital. 
  In France, the polls are expected to be a trial of strength 
before the 1995 Presidential election. The ruling centre-right 
Gaullists (the RPR) and the UDF [Union for French Democracy] 
have put up a joint list and have declared that they will sit 
together in Strasbourg in the EPP party.

<F P=106> [EC Document No. DOC/IP/94/419: "Baltic Information </F>
Infrastructure Pilot Project"] 
  [Text] Mr. Bangemann has announced today in Riga the 
launching of a pilot project, to improve the information 
infrastructure in the Baltic sates. The project constitutes a 
first success of the round table where leading industrialists of 
the European Union and the three Baltic states discussed the 
possibilities for foreign direct investment and industrial 
cooperation. 
  In the Baltic states, data networking has so far been less 
of 
a priority than voice communications in the telecom sector, and 
is hindered much by bottlenecks in the technical delivery 
systems. 
  The Baltic project will contribute to resolve some of these 
bottlenecks. It is also designed to develop some information 
services which will then be available on the network: company 
databases, exchange rate information, privatisation data. 
  Potential end-users of such information services, such as 
banks, have already shown interest to be actively involved in 
the project, and the value of the services accessible via the 
up-graded network will soon appear clearly. Since Western 
companies would be an important end-user in the view of Baltic 
business, the pilot action will include Western partners. 
  The action which starts today will receive 600,000 ECU of 
European Commission funding, for a period of 12 months. In 
April 1995, a workshop will examine the experiences made and 
ideas for future development.

<F P=106> [Nicholas Wood article: "Clarke Gives Hint That Eventual </F>
Goal is Single Currency"] 
  [Text] Britain could join a single currency without first 
re-entering the European exchange-rate mechanism, Kenneth Clarke 
said yesterday in remarks that threaten to rekindle the 
simmering Tory feud over Europe. 
  The Chancellor of the Exchequer was speaking at a 
Westminster 
press conference to launch the Conservative manifesto for the 
elections to the European Parliament. 
  A Strong Britain in a Strong Europe. Mr Clarke made it clear 
that Britain's enforced exit from the currency grid 20 months 
ago and its emasculation last summer were no barrier to a single 
currency and a central bank. 
  Eurosceptic Tories said that the Chancellor, who is on 
record 
as supporting the goal of economic and monetary union (EMU), had 
let the cat out of the bag and confirmed their fears that the 
Government is secretly planning to go for a single currency in 
the late 1990s, assuming it can then also win Commons support. 
But they declined to attack him publicly for fear of being 
accused of rocking the boat now that campaigning for the June 9 
poll is under way. 
  Mr Clarke said: "It is highly unrealistic that in present 
circumstances member states will go back to the narrow bands of 
the ERM [Exchange Rate Mechanism]. I do not think that Britain 
is likely to do so in the foreseeable future. If and when 
economic and monetary union ever comes on to the agenda again -- 
and no doubt some time it will -- I don't believe the route will 
be via the ERM." 
  Most Conservative MPs have assumed that the turmoil that 
struck the ERM last summer had dealt a fatal blow to the 
three-stage Delors time-table, under which the first countries 
could go ahead with a single currency in 1997. 
  John Major has said that the Delors timetable for EMU has 
"all the potency of a rain dance," and yesterday he was equally 
dismissive, saying that there were almost no signs that 
conditions for a single currency "are likely remotely to be 
established for a very long time indeed." 
  Tory MPs have also been reassured by the British opt-out 
from 
stage 3 of monetary union, which means that Britain could not 
join without the assent of Parliament. 
  However, the sceptics believe that, with stability returning 
to Europe's foreign exchange markets and with inflation and 
long-term interest rates low, some of the convergence criteria 
for stage 3 and a move to a single currency by 1997 -- or the 
later start of 1999 -- are being met. 
  A leading Tory sceptic said that Mr Clarke had realised that 
returning to the ERM was out of the question and that he was now 
considering leap-frogging the ERM and going straight to a single 
currency. 
  Another leading sceptic said: "We have known about this for 
18 months. They are going for a big bang. Ken Clarke would be 
very happy to see this happen and that's why Michael Portillo 
has said he would not have a single currency. Clarke does have 
a degree of candour. That's very refreshing but it does not 
mean he is right."

<F P=106> [Andrew Marr article: "Nice Package, Shame About the Sales </F>
Pitch"] 
  [Text] A little while ago, I was talking with a minister 
about the standing of Michael Heseltine. What had Michael 
actually done, asked the minister derisively. I listed some 
things and added that there was the big competitiveness White 
Paper coming. Long pause, stony stare. "I've seen it. You 
haven't," he said. 
  It wasn't so bad. "Competitiveness" is just a long word for 
hacking it. Along with "community" it has become one of those 
polysyllables no well-dressed politician can be seen without. 
But it matters more than most of what the Commons talks about. 
In their announcements, Mr Heseltine and David Hunt, the 
Employment Secretary, unveiled a series of useful proposals. 
But their political impact was minimal, bathos by the 
bucketful. It is worth asking why. 
  The recent Commons Trade and Industry Select Committee 
report 
on British manufacturing did a good job in clearing the 
intellectual ground: its recommendations were rather more 
radical than the Government could accept. Among the basic, 
simple points it made are that the old national-industrial 
strategies are futile in a world where so many companies are 
international: "Decisions concerning UK manufacturing will 
increasingly be determined by global economic forces, rather 
than UK considerations...." 
  That is, if you like, a point against the left. But the 
committee also demolished the idea that the solution for Britain 
lies in wagecutting: "The industries and firms at most immediate 
risk are lowskill, low-quality ones, including sections of UK 
manufacturing." With the extremes of picking winners and 
simplistic labour-market deregulation tossed aside, what remains 
is a relatively small area of policy, on to which politicians 
are now crowding. The heroic era in which enthusiasts for 
corporatism and ministries of technology clashed thunderously 
with privatisers and union-bashers has long passed. The debate 
has moved on. Among the remedies most frequently mentioned now 
are the need for better vocational training; "one-stop shops" 
for small exporters and small companies generally; action to 
stop business-killing late payments; and a serious look at the 
role of the financial institutions in providing support for 
manufacturing. 
  These familiar ideas formed the core of yesterday's White 
Paper. It had the air of cabinet committee battles lost, of 
grand projects overruled. But there were decent educational 
proposals -- the new general diploma to help employers to 
discover which schoolleavers have good basic skills will be 
something teachers and parents will quickly focus on. The 
recruitment of technology specialists and export counsellors to 
staff 200 offices that are planned to help small businesses 
echoes Labour manifestos but is none the worse for that In the 
detail, there is plenty of sense. 
  Rather grandly, the President of the Board of Trade chided 
Labour for not being more impressed. But the only way to make 
an impact in an area where the parties are converging is to 
surprise the country with the boldness of how you have grasped 
the agenda. And whatever yesterday's White Paper may have been, 
bold it wasn't. There was precious little new money. That does 
not necessarily translate into Kenneth Clarke stuffing his 
potential leadership rival Mr Heseltine, though such a thought 
appeals to political romantics. But the lack of funding made it 
more important for the measures to be sold with some panache. 
  Oddly, given Mr Heseltine's reputation, this modest and 
evolutionary package was woodenly undersold. There were plenty 
of "wide-ranging reviews," promises to develop this proposal 
further and earnest offers to reconsider that one. "We will be 
announcing later in the year ... We will be publishing a 
consultative document . . . Work is in hand . . ." 
  The president solemnly revealed: "We will work with the 
British Standards Institution and industry to develop BS5750 and 
product certification standards further to promote continuous 
improvement." Pericles it wasn't. After a few more minutes of 
this, the opposition benches were roaring with relieved laughter 
and a Labour spokesman was confidentially informing the press: 
"That's it. Hezza's finished." 
  He is far from finished; and this was a serious, if 
compromised and low-volume message. It had the feel of an 
interventionist surge, broken on the rocks of the Treasury, yet 
foaming still into a few crannies and rock pools. Given the 
size of the deficit, could more have been said? It would have 
been nice to see Mr Heseltine tackling with more gusto some of 
the political and cultural issues surrounding competitiveness 
policy. The importance of British commitment to the European 
Union and past failures in education are among the issues he 
would have found irresistible a few years ago. 
  Our culture is badly attuned to a world where jobs depend on 
thousands of risk-taking small businesses, many of which 
inevitably fail. We must get away from regarding bankruptcy as 
an invariable stigma: sanctimonious MPs could have done with a 
few robust home truths on those lines, too. 
  But the language of business and the language of politics 
mix 
badly. The age of grand pronouncements from government 
ministries about the future of this industry or that is over: 
bitter experience and the global market have rendered them 
redundant, even absurd. Perhaps the most important lesson is 
that industrial policy, having subsided to the level of detail 
and fine print, is no longer something that can rouse the House 
of Commons. Given its record, that may be the best news we've 
had for some time.

<F P=106> [Michael Smith article: "Minister Rules Out Nuclear </F>
Sell-off in Current Parliament"] 
  [Text] The nuclear power industry is unlikely to be 
privatised before the next election, Mr Tim Eggar, energy 
minister, said yesterday. 
  Launching a wide-ranging review of the sector's future, Mr 
Eggar said of the possible privatisation: "It would not be 
practical to do it in this parliament." 
  His comments are a significant setback to the hopes of 
Nuclear Electric, operator of nuclear power plants in England 
and Wales, which has been pressing strongly for privatisation. 
  Although Mr Eggar did not elaborate on why an early sale was 
impractical, the Department of Trade and Industry [DTI] -- where 
he is a minister -- is already preoccupied with privatisation of 
the Post Office, among other issues. 
  Privatisation of the nuclear industry would lead to a highly 
charged political debate. Tories fear the Labour party could 
make political capital of the issue in the run-up to a general 
election. 
  But Mr Eggar's dismissal of an early privatisation could 
annoy some in the Treasury, where ministers are much more 
enthusiastic about a sell-off. 
  Differences of opinion between the Treasury and DTI are 
believed to have been a factor in delaying the review, which the 
government had hoped to start last year. The DTI's review of 
the nuclear power industry will run in tandem with a Department 
of Environment inquiry, also announced yesterday, into the 
disposal of radioactive waste. 
  The preliminary results of this investigation are due to be 
announced in the summer and are likely to feed into the nuclear 
power review, which will probably last longer. 
  Environmental organisations welcomed the waste review 
yesterday, saying it would expose problems that would make the 
power industry more difficult to privatise in the long term. 
  In spite of Mr Eggar's caution, the DTI has agreed to 
consider privatisation as a key element of its review, which 
will also focus on the economic and commercial viability of new 
nuclear stations. 
  The government imposed a moratorium on building nuclear 
power 
stations other than Sizewell B in Suffolk when it excluded 
nuclear power from its plans to privatise the electricity 
industry in 1989. 
  The government said its review would not consider whether 
Sizewell B should be brought on stream as planned by Nuclear 
Electric later this year. This was a matter for "appropriate 
ministers and authorities." 
  The review will also consider nuclear waste and 
decommissioning liabilities.

<F P=106> [Michael Holman article: "Call to Improve Aid Programmes"] </F>
  [Text] An independent evaluation of international aid 
published yesterday sharply criticises tied aid, expresses 
concern that donors are failing to meet commitments to increase 
assistance, and says only 6.5 per cent of aid is spent on 
meeting the needs of the poorest. 
  Official development assistance (ODA) worth $60.4bn (40bn 
pounds) represented just over a third of the net flow of 
resources from the countries of the Development Assistance 
Committee (DAC) to developing countries in 1992, said the 
report, The Reality of Aid. Aid flows were critical in 
sub-Saharan Africa, where aid averages more than 13 per cent of 
gross national product. 
  The study, published by the London-based charity Action-aid, 
was edited by Development Initiatives, an independent 
consultancy specialising in aid and development policy. 
  The era of slowly growing aid is coming to an end, says the 
report, with the increase in real terms in aid from DAC donors 
of only 0.5 per cent between 1991 and 1992. 
  The share of humanitarian relief and peacekeeping has gone 
up 
from 2.3 per cent in 1988 to more than 7 per cent in 1991. 
  Business interests are becoming more assertive and their 
influence in the shape of aid and the countries it goes to 
appears to be increasing. This is not being matched by any 
coherent attempt to serve the needs of the poor. 
  However, the report notes that DAC measures introduced in 
1992 to improve the quality of tied aid "appear to be increasing 
accountability and having some impact." 
  Around $15bn each year has been tied to the purchase of 
goods 
and services from individual DAC members, says the report. In 
1991 this rose to nearly $18bn. 
  "This results in developing countries paying above the 
market 
rate," says the report, adding that estimates vary between 10 
and 20 per cent. 
  "This excess price is a direct subsidy to exporters in OECD 
countries amounting to more than $2bn a year -- nearly 4 per 
cent of DAC aid." 
  The volume of untied aid is unduly inflated by relief for 
bad 
debts arising out of export credit agreements which have 
originated from export promotion for domestic industry -- $1.3bn 
in 1991 or 2.2 per cent of total ODA. 
  The aid available for sustainable development is being hit 
by 
a combination of declining public expenditure budgets in the 
OECD and the increasing use of ODA to meet costs formerly borne 
by other government departments. The costs of asylum seekers 
and forgiveness for bad debts arising from commercial export 
credits counted for 5 per cent of total ODA in 1992, it says. 
Public support still far out-strips criticism of aid and its 
effectiveness, the report adds, "and the universal picture of 
aid fatigue is not borne out by opinion polls which continue to 
show that public support is founded on humanitarian concern."

<F P=106> [Michael Evans article: "Inept Clinton Blamed for West's </F>
`Strategic Arthritis'"] 
  [Text] President Clinton's fumbling and uncertain foreign 
policy was partly to blame for the Wests attack of "strategic 
arthritis last year, according to the International Institute 
for Strategic Studies. 
  "The United States, even more than usual, does not seem to 
be 
following a steady compass," the London-based group said in its 
annual review of world security issues. In one of the strongest 
indictments of Mr Clinton's failings, the report said he had 
been "blowing a very uncertain foreign-policy trumpet." The 
United States seemed to want, not security guarantees like the 
countries of Eastern Europe, but a guarantee of its own security 
policy, it said. 
  The report, published yesterday, said: "By the end of the 
year, the U.S. was insisting on no open-ended commitments, 
assurance of victory without casualties, and an exit strategy. 
These are awesome guarantees to ask for in todays uncertain 
world. It took a few American deaths during the humanitarian aid 
mission to Somalia to convince Mr Clinton that if the Somalis 
would not play the game, "it was time to gather up his marbles 
and go home. At least Somalia was left "somewhat better off." 
  In Haiti, however, the "dubious U.S. policy" had left the 
country worse off The report said Washington was guilty of an 
"extraordinary show of ineptitude." After sending a few lightly 
armed troops to back up Washington's policy of returning the 
elected President to run the country in place of "the thugs in 
the military who had deposed him, the ship carrying the American 
unit was ordered to turn round and go back. 
  The report also noted the "dangerous implications" of 
Russia's recent forays on to the world stage, particularly in 
the Balkans and former Soviet republics. Russian influence in 
helping to persuade the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina to remove 
their heavy weapons from Sarajevo had been effective. 
  It has, however, given the Russians a degree of influence in 
the former Yugoslavia that it has not had since Stalin lost 
control there in 1948. No settlement of the crisis in the area 
is possible now without Russian participation and full 
agreement. 
  More worrying than Moscow's action in Bosnia was the 
reassertion of Russian nationalist zeal towards the so-called 
"near abroad," the former Soviet republics. The term, as used 
by the Russians, indicated Moscow did not accept that the states 
which "rose from the rubble of the Soviet Union" were fully 
independent. Moscow seemed intent on ensuring that these states 
acted "only with Russian interests and desires in mind. If need 
be, it would meddle in their business," even militarily to 
ensure this outcome and the West seems willing to accept this 
state of affairs with little demur. 
  On the eve of a NATO Defence Ministers' meeting in Brussels, 
at which Pavel Grachev, the Russian Defence Minister, is 
expected to tell his Western counterparts what Moscow wants from 
the alliance, the survey said Nato governments were finding it 
difficult to choose between the demands of Russia and those of 
central and eastern Europe.

<F P=106> [Report by Lin Jenkins and Bill Frost: "Hospital Get </F>
Warning on Killer Bug"] 
  [Excerpts] The deadly bacteria that destroy tissue and 
muscle were believed to have claimed a sixth victim yesterday as 
the Department of Health circulated hospitals and health 
laboratories with details of the infection. 
  An investigation was under way last night into the death of 
a 
woman who had been thought to be cured of the streptococcal 
infection which she contracted after giving birth by Caesarean 
section. 
  The woman, in her early twenties, gave birth to a girl on 
May 
3 and spent more than a week in intensive care fighting a 
bacterial infection. 
  Doctors at St Peter's Hospital, Chertsey, Surrey, believed 
that she had recovered and on May 12 transferred her to Queen 
Marys hospital, Roehampton, to have plastic surgery and skin 
grafts to repair the damage caused by the infection, which eats 
away at tissue and muscle. 
  The woman's gynaecologist at the Surrey hospital had become 
worried when she began displaying septicaemia symptoms after the 
birth. A microbiology specialist diagnosed the onset of the 
tissue- destroying disease. 
  Hopes had been high that she would respond to treatment, but 
yesterday afternoon St Peters said she had died after being 
transferred. 
  A spokesman said: "Our consultant biologist sees maybe one 
or 
two cases a year. It is a fairly common bacteria, but it very 
rarely produces these symptoms. No further details were being 
released at the request of her family, and the case has been 
referred to the Battersea coroner. 
  John Adler, director of operation services at St Peters, 
refused to speculate on the cause of death: "We have no idea 
whether it was connected with the bacteria or not. There are 
other possible causes, and we will not know for certain until a 
post-mortem examination has been carried out." 
  All the cases have been apparently caused by strains of 
streptococcus, a bacterium usually linked to throat infections. 
Victims suffer a condition called necrotising fasciitis, in 
which the bacterium gets under the skin, causing a gangrene-like 
infection. 
  In an attempt to calm public fears about the bacterium, the 
director of the Public Health Laboratory Service communicable 
disease surveillance centre, Dr Christopher Bartlett, said 
yesterday the number of cases was within expected annual figures. 
  He added: Public anxiety should be allayed by the fact that 
we have examined all indicators of streptococcal infection in 
the country, and these are demonstrating no change in either 
numbers or patterns of infection. 
  In Parliament, Tom Sackville, junior health minister, 
rejected calls by MPs to make the condition a notifiable one, 
whereby all GPs and hospitals must report it. 
  The bacterium has claimed lives throughout the South of 
England. [passage omitted] 
  Dr Robin Stott, medical director of Lewisham Hospital NHS 
[National Health Service] Trust, said: "We are trying to put 
this in perspective and not cause more alarm. The bacteria is 
relatively trivial and responds to penicillin. 
  "Forty years ago it used to give rise to conditions which 
are 
more serious than they are today, such as kidney disease and 
rheumatic fever. The reasons for a change in potency of these 
bacteria are obscure. Occasionally and rarely this bacteria 
does cause significant life-threatening diseases which we are 
seeing now again for reasons we don't know," he said. 
  Dr Gopal Rao, consultant microbiologist at the hospital, 
said 
people displaying certain symptoms should see their doctor, and 
that GPs in the area and casualty departments were being alerted. 
  "This is a rare infection, but if someone is concerned, the 
following symptoms might be helpful: pain and tenderness in the 
limbs, accompanied by a fever in a well individual, should 
prompt the person to go to their GP," he said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams by Riccardo </F>
Orizio; place and date not given: "A Referendum in Ulster" -- 
first four paragraphs are CORRIERE DELLA SERA introduction] 
  [Text] He used to be an invisible man. Like a ghost 
without a face and without a voice, who, from one of his 25 safe 
houses in Belfast or his bomb-proof office on Falls Road, would 
terrorize Britain with the mere mention of his name, which was 
synonymous with fear, bombings, and mysteries. 
  Now Gerry Adams has come out of the shadows. The charismatic 
leader of Sinn Fein (the Northern Irish party that is in 
practice the political wing of the IRA), the man who has 
survived dozens of attacks by Protestant Unionists and the 
innumerable diplomatic traps of the oldest conflict in Europe, 
has started showing his beard and his open smile around the 
world. Like a real statesman. 
  First America, last week the Basque Country. Yesterday, he 
arrived in Italy, where he will visit Venice, then Turin, for 
the presentation of his book -- surprisingly, a narrative work. 
It is called, "The Road and Other Stories." It is all set in 
the poor and desperate streets of West Belfast, the Catholic 
ghetto of the Northern Irish capital, where Adams was born and 
where the guerrilla warfare is fiercest. 
  "To describe it as a diplomatic offensive is perhaps going 
too far," he said dismissively, persuasive, and polite. "But 
when the American Government granted me a visa, I accepted 
invitations from organizations and friends. The visit was a 
great success for Sinn Fein and for the cause of the Republican 
movement. I was invited to visit the Basque Country a year ago, 
and at last I accepted. I visited Italy in 1987 and I pledged 
to return if ever one of my books were to be translated. Of 
course, this has all happened at a rather busy time for the 
negotiations on Northern Ireland, but I could not refuse." 
  [Orizio] On 15 December 1993, there was the historic London 
and Dublin agreement on "the Northern Ireland people's right to 
self-determination." Sinn Fein asked for clarifications on 20 
points. First, London said "no," then it changed its mind. 
Yesterday evening you received a partial reply: a "yes" to a 
referendum in Ulster. Is this a victory? Does British Prime 
Minister John Major accept you as interlocutors now? 
  [Adams] Yes, of course. But relations between Sinn Fein and 
the British Government began in secret three years ago and have 
never ceased. If there were not the Maastricht Treaty to 
approve in Westminster, and therefore if a John Major with 
problems had not needed to keep his Unionist votes safe, he 
would have officially recognized us as a partner in the dialogue 
much sooner. So yesterday's acknowledgement is nothing new. 
  [Orizio] But now Major is talking openly about a referendum, 
to determine the future of Northern Ireland. This is something 
new. 
  [Adams] Before making an assessment of the substance of the 
British document, we will have to analyze its 21 pages 
thoroughly. Permit me to say, however, that a 21-page reply to 
just one of the points that we raised shows that we were right 
to want to look into the matter more thoroughly and that we were 
in good faith. Of course, we are clear about how the "right to 
self-determination" would express itself, but we believe that 
the entire people of Ireland, and not just of Northern Ireland, 
are entitled to express themselves. Be that as it may, if this 
British reply helps the dialogue to continue, it really is 
welcome. 
  [Orizio] Are Major's domestic political problems influencing 
the negotiations? 
  [Adams] Yes, and in a very negative way. Major's position is 
so precarious that the prime minister is effectively being held 
hostage by a group of members of parliament of the Tory Right, 
who are holding him for ransom precisely over the Northern 
Ireland issue. Without this problem, the negotiations would be 
much further advanced. 
  [Orizio] But there is again more shooting going on in Ulster 
than before. Why? 
  [Adams] It is the Protestant terrorists that are responsible 
for almost all these bloodthirsty incidents. The other day they 
killed two Catholic workers, 10 days ago an old lady who was 
watching television. They are trying to frighten people. But 
the worst thing is that they shoot with weapons supplied by the 
British Government, as we have proved with documentary evidence. 
These weapons came via South Africa and were brought in by a 
British agent. 
  [Orizio] The British Government, however, accuses you 
Republicans of having taken weapons from Iran, in exchange for 
the elimination of political adversaries of the Ayatollah. 
  [Adams] It also accuses us of managing a drugs racket to 
finance the struggle. It is all lies. Ridiculous stories. 
Tehran has denied it, the IRA has denied it, and the Dublin 
government has denied it. The fact is that it is all British 
propaganda. After the support gathered during my visit to 
America, London decided to respond by trying to discredit us. 
But no one in Belfast believes these things. 
  [Orizio] Leaving these accusations aside, is there a hope of 
peace now? 
  [Adams] I believe so. People want peace and the 
international climate is favorable. Dialogue has resolved two 
crises that seemed insoluble -- the Middle East and South 
Africa. Now it is up to us. The political process of dialogue 
must be started. We republicans believe in it.

  [Text] Bonn -- German and Russian military units are 
planning joint exercises. A Defense Ministry spokesman said in 
Bonn on Thursday [26 May] that a German-Russian staff exercise 
is scheduled to be held in Russia next year. There will be no 
combat units involved, just military staff units. German and 
Russian warships will meet for a joint exercise in the Baltic 
Sea before the end of this year. 
  Defense Minister Volker Ruehe plans to hold a joint exercise 
of Bundeswehr units and the Russian Army on German soil in 1996. 
The legal framework to enable this still has to be created, the 
spokesman said. 
  There are presently no laws regulating maneuvers of eastern 
troops in Germany. Details on exercises of NATO partners are 
laid down in the annex to the NATO troops charter. 
  According to the Defense Ministry, an exercise of German, 
Polish, and Danish engineering troops will be held in Denmark 
this October under the code name "Carbon Gap." Prior to that, 
in September, the German Navy will conduct exercises together 
with Polish and Danish ships in Mecklenburg Bay. 
  In 1995, an exercise involving Hungarian, German, and 
British 
units is to take place in Hungary. Polish, Danish, and German 
military units will be conducting an exercise in Poland next 
year. Once the necessary legal framework has been created, 
Danish, Polish, and German troops will hold maneuvers in Germany 
in 1996. All exercises held together with Poland and Hungary 
will be conducted within NATO's Partnership for Peace program.

  [Text] Brussels -- Germany has informed NATO that the 
operational part of the German Army in the new laender is to be 
put under the control of the Western alliance as of the 
beginning of 1995. This has emerged from alliance circles after 
the meeting of the NATO Cooperation Council in Brussels on 
Wednesday [25 May]. 
  Germany had agreed with the former victorious nations that 
its troops in the former GDR should remain outside the 
integrated NATO military structure at first. After the 
withdrawal of the Russian troops from eastern Germany, Germany 
will be free to decide. 
  The details still need to be agreed upon with NATO. Another 
open question is which locations will be available to the 
Western alliance. The number of joint maneuvers will also have 
to be decided.

  [Excerpt] Berlin -- Roman Herzog's election as the new 
federal president has led to a clear deterioration of the 
political climate between the Bonn coalition [Christian 
Democratic Union/Christian Social Union, CDU/CSU, and the Free 
Democratic Party, FDP] and the Social Democratic Party of 
Germany [SPD] opposition. One day after the new president was 
elected by the Federal Assembly, the two sides had a fierce 
exchange on the circumstances surrounding the election and the 
first speech by the new head of state. 
  SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping said that Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl and the FDP had not been trying to find the best president 
for Germany but to "protect their power." Kohl was playing 
tactical games with the presidency. The FDP has completely 
yielded to its CDU/CSU coalition partner and has ceased to be a 
political force of its own, he told journalists in Berlin on 
Tuesday [24 May]. But the SPD will cooperate loyally with 
Herzog. To make use of the impetus from the population's 
support for SPD presidential candidate Johannes Rau, the SPD 
will make the European elections the "fourth ballot" of the 
Federal Assembly. 
  The chancellor and CDU chairman sharply rejected the Social 
Democrats' accusations. The criticism of Herzog's first speech 
after his election is also "completely unacceptable" and is 
degrading to the new president's character. The SPD is proving 
to be a "bad loser." Herzog's words of thanks after the 
election were not his inaugural speech, Kohl said. It is, 
therefore, intellectually unfair to draw wrong conclusions from 
it deliberately. He is convinced that Herzog will carry out his 
duties in a convincing way. CDU/CSU Bundestag Group Chairman 
Wolfgang Schaeuble said that the SPD's criticism is incompatible 
with the dignity of the office. Respecting majority decisions 
is part of democracy. 
  FDP Chairman and Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel defended the 
FDP delegates' vote for Herzog. It was right also in view of 
the FDP's strategic line in the 1994 election year, he said in 
Berlin. He warned the SPD against taking "political revenge" on 
the FDP. Kinkel is optimistic that the party's "clarity and 
straightforwardness" in the presidential election will have a 
positive effect on the upcoming elections. CSU Secretary 
General Erwin Huber rejected the SPD's criticism of Herzog as 
undemocratic. The Social Democrats should stop their 
"propaganda" against the new head of state. 
  Scharping called upon Herzog to conduct his office in an 
absolutely impartial way and to continue the tradition of his 
highly respected predecessor, Richard von Weizsaecker. He 
criticized misleading statements on the reasons for Germany's 
division and on overcoming it: "History is neither a 
coincidence nor a miracle," Scharping said in connection with 
Herzog's statement that the division came about in 1945 "by 
coincidence" and that unity is a miracle. Other leading Social 
Democrats were also dismayed about "nationalist comments" that 
were present throughout the speech. In addition, he did not say 
a word about the recent xenophobic violence. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Mainz -- Rudolf Scharping, chairman of the Social 
Democratic Party [SPD] and minister-president of 
Rhineland-Palatinate, does not expect his criticism of Monday's 
[23 May] presidential election to do his party any harm. He did 
not advocate a direct transition to electing the head of state 
by popular vote, Scharping told journalists in Mainz on 
Wednesday. The implications that such a regulation would have 
for the constitution must be carefully examined, he said. 
  He said he considers the decision made in Berlin to be 
legitimate; but he wanted to point out that the decision was 
based on 1990 election results. Over 800 delegates to the 
Federal Assembly came from parliaments that were elected four 
years ago. The SPD chairman wants to see his fierce criticism of 
the Free Democratic Party [FDP] put in perspective. The comment 
that the FDP is superfluous as a political force of its own only 
referred to the presidential election. At the same time 
Scharping exempted the Rhineland-Palatinate FDP, and thus the 
SPD's coalition partner, from this criticism, saying that they 
have proved to be an independent liberal force in the government 
alliance.

  [Text] Stuttgart/Karlsruhe (DPA) -- During the search of 
an apartment in Baden-Wuerttemberg in early May, police seized 
what is probably 60 grams of plutonium 239. For several weeks 
the authorities in southwest Germany obviously did not have any 
idea how dangerous this find was. Only on Thursday [27 May] did 
investigations by the Land Office for Environmental Protection 
in Karlsruhe show that the material, which is in a small 
cylindrical container, is probably this kind of plutonium, the 
Environment Ministry in Stuttgart announced. 
  According to the Ministry, the amount seized is "highly 
dangerous" and is so far the largest amount found in 
Baden-Wuerttemberg. However, the amount is not sufficient to 
produce a nuclear bomb. The material probably comes from an 
East European country. The Stuttgart Land Office of Criminal 
Investigations has taken over investigations. 
  Information about the occasion, the place, and the exact 
date 
of the search was not given for "tactical reasons." In 
addition, the Ministry announced that "following initial 
suspicion, the local fire brigade did not register any 
radioactive radiation outside the container."

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The Defense Ministry in Bonn intends 
to make the export of German armament goods easier by taking the 
route via Europe. In a confidential concept for the planned 
European armament agency, it says that the project is useful 
only if the national restrictions are abolished. 
  The paper, which has been obtained by DPA, suggests giving 
up 
the passage in the Maastricht Treaty on Europe, which expressly 
leaves decisions about the production and trade with military 
materiel to the individual countries. In the future, the 
planned agency is to decide on armament deals instead. 
  For this purpose, the paper recommends treating the future 
decisions of other countries on armament deliveries in such a 
way "as if the export decision of the partner were one's own, 
even if it has not been made for one's own country." In this 
way the looser restrictions of France, for instance, would be 
applied also to German armament exports. 
  In addition, it is suggested that more restrained partners, 
such as Great Britain, be excluded. Instead of a forthcoming 
"minimal solution," Germany should join "four of five" really 
determined European partners for armament exports. Then the 
free competition would "bring a net profit to the efficient 
German armament industry as a whole." Obviously, the concept 
has not yet been coordinated with the Foreign Ministry and the 
Economics Ministry in Bonn. 
  According to the defense minister, the point is not 
loosening 
arms export regulations but "harmonizing armament efforts." In 
a statement the Defense Ministry pointed to the decision of the 
Maastricht summit in 1991, according to which a "real European 
security and defense identity" should be developed. This 
includes more intensive armament cooperation with the goal of a 
common armament agency. The concept is only a "discussion paper 
at the working level," which presents first considerations. A 
Foreign Ministry spokesman said upon inquiry that the paper is 
not known to the Ministry.

<F P=106> [Dieter Huenerkoch report: "Secret Plan for Eurofighter </F>
2000"] 
  [Text] The controversy over the high cost involved in the 
production of Eurofighter 2000 could soon take a surprising 
turn. When Bonn decides next spring whether the European 
fighter aircraft will be procured at all for the Bundeswehr, the 
price for the military aircraft may have dropped drastically. 
Experts currently estimate it at 125 million German marks [DM] 
per aircraft (production costs and costs of logistics for 
Bundeswehr). 
  It is true that the Daimler subsidiary, Deutsche Aerospace 
(DASA), and the other European producers intend to stick to 
their price of DM57 million ex factory for the fighter. They 
believe, however, they can save two-digit million amounts per 
aircraft in connection with the so-called system costs of the 
Bundeswehr, including replacement parts, maintenance, and 
repair. Industry is currently negotiating with the military on 
the privatization of replacement parts, maintenance, and repair. 
The Eurofighter 2000 producers are confident they will be able 
to fulfill such tasks at costs that would be 25-30 percent lower 
than if carried out by the Bundeswehr. 
  If agreement is reached, Dasa will transform its plant in 
Manching near Munich into a logistics center for the Luftwaffe. 
  The most difficult problem of such an option is that the 
military does not want to depend on the private sector and its 
employees in a crisis or even war. Thus a contractual agreement 
is envisaged so that in such cases the logistics center in 
Manching and the employees concerned would be placed under the 
command of the Bundeswehr. 
  The parties involved believe that such an agreement would 
have advantages for both sides. Industry would secure for 
itself permanent, additional employment, and the Bundeswehr 
would save personnel cost and above all fixed costs. As a 
result, means for investment and procurement could be set free 
-- despite the decreasing military budget. So industry would be 
the winner in a dual sense. An arms manager: "The invested 
part of the Bundeswehr's expenditures has meanwhile dropped to 
less than 20 percent. It must be the goal to increase this rate 
to 30 percent again."

  [Text] Berlin -- Dieter Schulze, 54, has been nominated as 
the official candidate to succeed Heinz-Werner Meyer, the leader 
of the German Trade Union Federation [DGB] who died two weeks 
ago. The chairmen of the individual trade unions decided at a 
special session today to present Schulte at the DGB Congress 
scheduled to take place in Berlin between 13 and 17 June as 
candidate for the chairmanship. DPA learned this from 
participants in the special session. 
  The 54-year-old official is a member of the Executive 
Committee of the Metal Workers Trade Union and responsible for 
the steel industry and for codetermination. 
  The trade union chairmen rejected a crucial vote at the DGB 
congress between Schulte and DGB Deputy Chairwoman Ursula

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "United States/Italy: `Confidence in </F>
Italian Choices', Christopher Tells Martino"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Washington, May 24 -- "We have great 
confidence in the choices of the Italian people," U.S. Secretary 
of State Warren Christopher told Italian Foreign Minister 
Antonio Martino, going into the latter's last engagement in his 
two-day visit to the U.S. capital. 
  Answering journalists' questions, Christopher said that the 
U.S. will follow with interest the democratic process in Italy. 
He stressed Italy's "great role" in Europe, saying that he 
would be talking with the new Italian foreign minister about 
Bosnia, trade issues, and the Group of Seven summit in Naples in 
July. 
  Asked what he was going to say to Christopher, Martino 
replied: "The most important thing is reaffirming that the 
general lines of our Atlantic policy will be marked by great 
continuity with the past. We aspire to continue to be a 
faithful and essential ally of American foreign policy." Asked 
what he would like to hear in reply, he said: "The recognition 
that this relationship will certainly continue in the way both 
sides want." 
  Earlier, the G-7 summit was also a key talking-point at 
Martino's meeting with U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, 
who said Italy now had the stability needed to continue on the 
road to financial and economic recovery. U.S. sources said 
Bentsen expressed appreciation, in particular, for last summer's 
inflation-pegging cost-of-labour accord, and said there was 
great U.S. investment interest in Italy, as shown by the recent 
takeover of ENI's [National Hydrocarbons Corporation] Nuovo 
Pignone. 
  Martino illustrated the government's tax-cutting and 
job-creating plans, including the projected lowering of the top 
rate to 33 percent. Bentsen noted that the U.S. top bracket is 
39.6 percent, saying that "in the past it had gone a lot lower, 
but that caused some public debt problems." One of Bentsen's 
advisors pointed to the uniformity of wages between north and 
south Italy, and Martino agreed that on this and other labour 
market flexibilty issues, Europe had much to learn from the 
United States. 
  (An earlier meeting with the American Jewish Conference was 
described as "very positive" by its president, Lester Pollack, 
who added that "we have opened a dialogue that will continue in 
the U.S. and Italy." "This is the most pro-Israeli Italian 
government in the last 20 years," he said.) 
  "The door is still open" for Italy's request to be included 
in the contact group on Bosnia (U.S., Russia, France, Britain 
and the EU [European Union] troika), Martino said after the 
meeting -- although Christopher pointed to "coordination 
difficulties" in enlarging the group. 
  As for Italy's other key request to get a greater say in 
decisions that affect her, a place on the UN Security Council, 
Martino said he had received a pledge that this would be 
examined within the ambit of UN reform. He recognised that any 
decision here "will not be quick in coming" given the timeframe 
of the projected reform. 
  Martino said he had reiterated the "unacceptable" nature of 
Italy being excluded from decisions directly affecting it: 
especially its exclusion from the Bosnian contact group. To 
Christopher's objection of "coordination difficulties," he 
replied by stressing the importance of Italian air bases in 
providing logistical support for missions. Martino stressed 
that the talking on this issue had only just begun. 
  On UN reform, the two men examined an Italian proposal for 
appointing rotating members alongside the five permanent members 
of the Security Council, and a counter-proposal for 10 permanent 
members, today's five plus Germany, Japan, and three other 
members taken from Africa, Asia and Latin America. "A solution 
of this kind, leaving Italy out, would be unacceptable for us," 
said Martino. 
  But the road to UN reform will be a long one, both men 
recognise, leaving time to assign new roles for countries like 
Italy which are among the major contributors to aid operations. 
  Bosnia and the UN -- two points on which Christopher was not 
slow to praise Italy -- were not the only issues discussed in 
the talks, which lasted about an hour. 
  Other points examined were U.S. President Bill Clinton's 
coming visit to Italy, the G-7 in Naples in July, and Italy's 
strategic role alongside the Balkans and at the crossroads of 
the Arab-Western world. 
  Martino described his earlier meeting with the Conference of 
America's 15 largest Jewish communities as "extraordinarily 
important". He said he had reiterated Italy's traditional 
friendship with Israel and its support for the Arab-Israeli 
peace process. "There were no questions on the presence of 
ministers from National Alliance in the government," he said in 
reference to the rightist section of the Berlusconi government. 
  "No one during my stay here asked me any questions on the 
so- 
called Berlusconi issue, that is the possibility of conflicts of 
interest between Berlusconi the premier and Berlusconi the 
businessman," said Martino in reply to a later question. But he 
added that the question had been raised "indirectly" by an 
editorialist at THE WASHINGTON POST, where he had a foreign 
policy interview this morning. On that occasion, he said, "I 
replied that if an entrepreneur wanted to use politics for his 
private business ends, he would not become the protagonist of 
the political scene, since as premier he would draw the 
attention of public opinion, the opposition, the press, the 
magistrature, and the head of state". 
  Asked to comment on Left Democrat No.2 Massimo D'Alema's 
image of him having to tour foreign capitals, cap in hand, to 
reassure Italy's partners about an administration containing 
ministers with a neo-fascist past, Martino replied: "Going 
round with one's cap in one's hand means asking for money. That 
is not the case, and I don't know how to do it. If D'Alema 
means I was keen to get in touch with our international 
interlocutors, that is true. But I believe it is the first duty 
of a foreign minister". 
  Asked if Bentsen had shown any concern over Italy's ability 
to put the economy and public accounts back on their feet, 
Martino said that "I am more worried on that score, to be 
frank... It's about time people were told that what has been 
said about the last two governments undertaking vigorous 
corrective measures is not true". 
  Before leaving for Rome in the early afternoon Washington 
time, Martino also had talks with National Security Advisor 
Antony Lake.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "NATO: Previti Finds `Sympathy and </F>
Encouragement'"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Brussels, May 24 -- Italian Defence Minister 
Cesare Previti said he had found nothing but "sympathy and 
encouragement" for Italy's international role -- especially its 
support for the Bosnian mission -- during his NATO debut at a 
defence ministers' get-together due to end tomorrow. 
  After transmitting his message of utmost continuity in 
Italy's foreign affairs, and its willingness to play a bigger 
role in peacekeeping operations, Previti said he had found "no 
prejudice, and no reservations, whether covert or overt", in his 
meetings here. 
  Previti echoed Foreign Minister Antonio Martino in 
Washington 
in stressing that Italy wants an "appropriate involvement" in 
political and military decision-making if it is to take on any 
larger role: a fact that was recognised by U.S. Defence 
Secretary William Perry. 
  He reiterated Italy's willingness to send peacekeepers to 
Bosnia, on three conditions -- "if the UN Security Council so 
requests, if it is a case of implementing a peace plan, and if 
all the sides in question have agreed to that plan" -- and added 
that Italy is also willing to take part in a possible aid 
operation in Rwanda "if the UN asks us, and in forms that will 
have to be agreed". 
  In talks with British Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind and 
German Defence Minister Volker Ruehe he examined industrial and 
technological cooperation. NATO's supreme European commander 
George Joulwan expressed gratitude for Italy's loan of air bases 
for operations in former Yugoslavia.

From UN"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Brussels, May 24 -- Italy remains ready to 
participate in an eventual international effort in favor of 
Rwanda but first wants to see a clear decision by the United 
Nations, Italian Defense Minister Cesare Previti said here on 
Tuesday [24 May]. 
  Speaking on the sidelines of the ministerial NATO planning 
committee, the defense minister added, "We expect to see some 
clear ideas. Foreign Minister (Antonio) Martino is sounding out 
available energies in the United Nations" for a humanitarian 
effort. 
  Italy, Previti said, stands ready to do its part as it has 
in 
the past.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Rome Willing To Join Rwanda </F>
Efforts, Previti Says"] 
  [Excerpt] (ANSA) Brussels, May 25 -- Defense Minister 
Cesare Previti on Wednesday [25 May] confirmed that Italy "is 
ready to join all necessary initiatives" taken by the United 
Nations to stop bloodshed in Rwanda but stressed that "this 
should be taken in a general sense and does not mean we will 
send paratroopers." He did not elaborate. 
  After a series of meetings with his European counterparts 
here, Previti told reporters the foreign policy of the new Rome 
government is aimed at having Italy "catch up" on all fronts, 
"diplomatic and military-humanitarian." He said Italy is still 
"available" should the UN decide to ask for Italian 
peace-keepers in Bosnia and claimed that Italian Armed Forces 
"are capable of responding to calls for peace-keeping 
operations" around the world, as they have in Somalia, 
Mozambique and Lebanon. 
  Following in the footsteps of his three predecessors, 
Previti, too, announced that the Italian Armed Forces will be 
modernized and trimmed down, becoming smaller and more 
efficient. [passage omitted]

Any Mission, Martino Says"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Washington, May 24 -- The "extremely 
important military and diplomatic implications" of an Italian 
peacekeeping mission to Rwanda "must be studied with the utmost 
care" by the Italian government before any decision is taken, 
Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Martino said at a press 
conference here. 
  Asked to comment on Defence Minister Cesare Previti's 
statement at a Brussels NATO meeting of "general willingness" 
for such a mission, Martino said "I think Previti wanted to 
stress the Italian government's concern for the orphans in 
Rwanda". 
  He added that "nothing precludes" an Italian mission, but 
pointed out that there are "risks of various kinds" attached to 
it. 
  "A decision can only be taken by the government, obviously," 
he said.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Croatia/Italy: Fears Over Borders </F>
Unjustified, Ministers Say"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Washington, May 23 -- Both Italian Foreign 
Minister Antonio Martino, here, and Defense Minister Cesare 
Preveti, in Brussels, said on Monday [23 May] that no problem 
existed regarding the borders between Italy and Croatia and that 
fears in this regard, voiced by Croatian president Franjo 
Tudjman, were unjustified. 
  During his press conference here, Foreign Minister Martino 
said "the position adopted by President Tudjman is not justified 
by any attitude or position on our part.... Italy's position is 
that we see absolutely no problem about borders. We have never 
considered treaties to be pieces of paper to be torn up. 
Bilateral questions may exist, obviously, and we hope they can 
be resolved in a friendly way on a bilateral level and which 
satisfies both sides." 
  President Tudjman had said, at the weekend, that die-hard 
Italian fascists had to give up, once and for all, any and all 
claims to coastal provinces of Croatia. 
  Asked whether the treaty of Osimo, which defined the 
Italo-Yugoslav border, could be re-opened, the Italian 
diplomatic chief recalled how Slovenia and Croatia had legally 
replaced Yugoslavia and that the treaty "must be respected and, 
in some cases, even applied." 
  The existing bilateral questions were listed by the minister 
as those regarding the real estate purchases by Italians and 
free circulation of persons. 
  (In Brussels, Defense Minister Preveti said no disputes were 
open between Italy and Croatia and that, at most, only 
adjustments needed to be made which took into account the new 
political reality.)

Luigi Scalfaro this evening sent a message of congratulations to 
the new president of the German Federal Republic, Roman Herzog, 
in which he stressed the ties of friendship between Italy and 
Germany and the tasks they must face together in the future. 
  "At the moment you have been called to fill the State's

you my most sincere and warm best wishes for the happy and 
profitable execution of the high duties which the Federal 
parliament has assigned you." 
  "I am sure that, under your guidance" the note continued, 
"the deep ties between our countries and between our peoples, 
linked by centuries of friendship and by common European and 
Atlantic ideals, will find new causes for enrichment and 
development." 
  The Italian president then added "Italy and Germany are, in 
fact, called on to give, together with the other members of the 
European Union, a fundamental contribution to the new Europe and 
a more free and just world." 
  "In the hope of soon having the occasion to meet with you" 
Scalfaro concluded, "I send a word of friendship along with the

  [Text] Tirana, May 19 (ATA) -- "The new government will 
not decrease but it will increase more the traditional Italian 
commitment to the Balkans and especially to Albania which its 
geographical vicinity and the relations' density is particularly 
close," the new Italian foreign minister, Antonio Martini, said 
in an interview with the GAZETA SHQIPTARE in his first 
commitment in the press in regard to the new Italian foreign 
policy. 
  "Italy has been committed to economically support the 
country 
which is few miles from us when it was in the most dramatic 
moment -- passing to the democratic ways of governing," Mr. 
Martini has said, mentioning the Pelican Operation [Italian 
humanitarian military operation] carried out by Italian military 
units which made a very significant contribution to release the 
difficult conditions of the Albanian population. "The 
cooperation is destined to continue in new forms taking into 
consideration the historical relations between the two 
countries," Martini emphasises. 
  The Italian foreign minister said in the interview that the 
deep change which took place in the stage of the Italian policy 
as a consequence of the last elections, represents in many 
aspects a turning point in the history of the country. Mr. 
Martini said that the Corfu meeting of the Council of Europe, to 
be held at the end of the June, will offer the most important 
opportunity for a confrontation with the EU [European Union] 
partners and where the deep views of the Italian Government on 
the European question will be expressed in a high level. 
  The Italian foreign minister, Martini, mentioned also the 
G-7 
meeting to be held on July in Napoli [Naples], which will give 
an opportunity to the Italian Government for presenting its 
program and initiatives in the interior and international aspect.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "European Union/Italy: Socialists </F>
Want Word on Neo-Fascist Ministers"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Genoa, May 19 -- The head of the European 
Parliament's Socialist caucus, Jean Pierre Cot, on Thursday [19 
May] urged the government of Silvio Berlusconi to issue a 
"formal declaration" that would clear up once and for all the 
issue of what he called "neo-Fascist ministers" in the cabinet. 
  Cot, on a brief visit to Genoa, told reporters the European 
Parliament did not intend to interfere with Italy's internal 
affairs when it approved a motion on May 4 asking the Italian 
president to make sure the new government would "remain faithful 
to the fundamental values" of the European Union [EU], referring 
indirectly to the possibility that the new executive (which had 
not been formed yet) would include ministers of the National 
Alliance, the new name given to the Italian Social Movement, 
heir to Mussolini's Fascist Party. 
  "We do not plan to put intentions on trial over the issue," 
Cot said, adding however that "contradictory statements have 
been made," referring to National Alliance leader Gianfranco 
Fini, who insists he is a "post-fascist" but has not formally 
renounced the party's historical roots and recently defined 
Mussolini as the century's greatest statesman. 
  Fini's party has five cabinet posts in the new government 
and 
on Monday [16 May] National Alliance presented, as it has done 
at the beginning of every legislature for decades, a legislative 
bill to revoke a constitutional law passed in 1948 banning the 
revival of the Fascist Party. The party later withdrew the 
bill, saying it had been mistakenly filed with the speaker's 
office by an over-zealous secretary. 
  Cot said: "The Italian government must be told: Since you 
claim you have nothing to do with the Fascist past, you must 
also say that the Fascist past has nothing to do with you." He 
warned that, "unless a political clarification is made, 
relations may become complicated." 
  Cot also made reference to statements by the new foreign 
minister, Antonio Martino, who claimed he would never have 
anything to do with a Fascist minister, noting that "while 
Martino says reassuring things, others are saying the opposite." 
  Italy, in other words, "must say it follows the anti-Fascist 
line" that is at the foundation of the EU, Cot asserted. "A 
formal declaration made by the Italian government reneging a 
past that is hateful to all may clear the air." 
  He compared the Italian situation to that of Japan, where 
the 
justice minister was forced to resign two weeks ago for having 
downplayed the Nanjing massacres of 1937. 
  According to Cot, the European Parliament is concerned about 
the issue just as it is concerned about the rise of extreme 
right-wing movements across Europe. "We are living in a time in 
which watchfulness over the values of democracy must be 
doubled," he said.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Ireland/Italy: Sinn Fein Leader </F>
Adams Visits Italy"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) London, May 18 -- The leader of Ireland's 
Sinn Fein party, Gerry Adams, left today for a five-day visit to 
Italy aimed at informing public opinion on the situation in 
Northern Ireland. 
  Sinn Fein is viewed as the political wing of the underground 
Irish Republican Army and Adams has already made similar visits, 
despite protests from London, to the United States and, last 
week, the Basque regions. 
  Adams is slated to meet in Venice with Martino Dorigo, MP 
for 
Communist Refoundation, and in Turin with another Communist MP, 
Marco Rizza, before winding up his visit Monday with a press 
conference.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Mozambique/Italy: Government </F>
Delegation in Rome"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 19 -- A Mozambique Government 
delegation led by Transport Minister Guebuza is in Rome for 
meetings with political and parliamentary figures within the 
framework of the intense relations that Rome enjoys both with 
the Maputo government and with Renamo [Mozambique National 
Resistance], the former rebel movement now in the process of 
becoming a bona fide political party. It was Guebuza who 
represented the Maputo government in the negotiations with 
Renamo that led to the signing of a peace pact in Rome in 
October of 1992. 
  The present Rome contacts are aimed at easing the 
implementation of the peace accords and the elections set for 
October 27-28 of this year in Mozambique. 
  During meetings held at the Foreign Ministry here the Maputo 
government reiterated its gratitude to Italy for its 
contribution to the pacification of the African country. 
  Italy, in fact, in addition to helping with the peace 
process, is top contributor to the United Nations fund for 
turning the former Mozambique rebel movement Renamo into a 
political party. 
  The UN special envoy to Mozambique, Aldo Ajello, only 
recently pointed out that the Italian government had given three 
donations totalling 6.28 million dollars, out of a total of 15 
million dollars donated. 
  The fund was set up in May 1993 with the aim of persuading 
Renamo to implement the peace plan signed in Rome in 1992. 
  It was initially to have 10 million dollars; this was later 
raised to 15. 
  The next biggest contributor after Italy is Holland with one 
million dollars, followed by Sweden, South Africa, Switzerland 
and Luxembourg. 
  A second fund to fund campaigns of all Mozambique parties 
for 
October elections will receive donations to the tune of some 
three million dollars, Ajello said.

With Ambassador Bartholomew"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 19 -- Italian Interior Minister 
Roberto Maroni met there Thursday [19 May] with United States 
Ambassador Reginald Bartholomew, also in view of President Bill 
Clinton's upcoming visit to Italy, and reiterated how the fight 
against organized crime was a top priority of the new 
government, headed by Premier Silvio Berlusconi. 
  A statement from the Interior Ministry added how Maroni had 
stressed "the validity and appreciation of the Italian 
government for the high level cooperation achieved in the fight 
against organized crime and drug trafficking." 
  "He then underlined" the Ministry note continued, "how one 
of 
the government's top priorities, also to enhance the confidence 
of citizens in the institutions of the democratic state, 
remained the offensive against the mafia, especially in the 
harder hit regions, which will now involve a more incisive role 
by local governments." 
  "Ambassador Bartholomew" the statement added, "renewed the 
high esteem of the FBI and DEA for the significant level of 
professionalism and specialization of Italian law enforcement 
agencies." 
  During today's meeting, the Ministry said, the minister and 
ambassador confirmed the September meeting in Washington of the 
Italian-American committee for collaboration against the mafia, 
terrorism and drug trafficking.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Maroni Responds to Senate on Mafia, </F>
Skinheads"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 18 -- Interior Minister Roberto 
Maroni went before the Senate this evening, after the confidence 
vote, to reply to queries put forward concerning recent attacks 
by the mafia in Sicily and last weekend's march in Vicenza of 
neo-Nazi skinheads. 
  Regarding the bombing by the mafia in Piana degli Albanesi, 
which saw the destruction of a home of a Left Democrat party 
official, Maroni replied how he immediately went in person to 
Sicily where he met with seventeen mayors and numerous city 
councilors and private citizens. 
  "The new and effective concept" the interior minister told 
the Senate, "is the that fight against organized crime will now 
take place through local governments which side against the 
mafia phenomenon and are no longer, as once was the case, in 
support of the mafia." 
  Turning his attention to Saturday's [14 May] march in 
Vicenza, Maroni ruled out any fault for the part of National 
Police Chief Vincenzo Parisi and argued that "the ministry 
official, in Rome, who received the request from authorities in 
Vicenza for 80 additional police officers probably did not 
notify Parisi because he underestimated the request." 
  The interior minister then went on to say how the 
participants in the demonstration had all been identified, 
thanks to television tapes, and their names forwarded to 
judicial authorities for violation of laws against fascism. 
Maroni also told the senate how the number of skinheads in 
Italy was 800, of which 300 were considered "activists."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Left Democrat's Car Burned Near </F>
Palermo"] 
  [Excerpt] (ANSA) Palermo, May 19 -- A Peugeot 205 belonging 
to a former Left Democrat mayor and now public works councillor 
at San Cipirello, about 30 km from Palermo, was found burned-out 
outside his home this morning in what police think is the latest 
in a string of intimidatory attacks in the Palermo area against 
left-wing politicians elected in December. 
  Giuseppe Italiano, who attended yesterday's local meeting 
with Interior Minister Roberto Maroni to offer a visible 
response to the wave of bombings, said "I have no shady dealings 
of any sort; I'm sure the burning of my car fits into the Mafia 
strategy of intimidating the new left-wing councils. I've 
always been in the front line in local initiatives against the 
Mafia." 
  Antonino Inzerillo, mayor of nearby San Giuseppe Jato, said 
the Mafia was pursuing "a well-defined political design, aimed 
at deterring the left-wing councils that represent change." 
"With this attack," Inzerillo added, "Cosa Nostra wants to show 
it is present and has not given up control of the territory." 
  The local Left Democrat office issued a communique saying 
that "the attack on Giuseppe Italiano, a banner of the farm 
labourers' movement in the province of Palermo, shows that the 
Mafia offensive aims to strike all the pillars of the 
progressive movement: councils, trade unions, the cooperative 
movement, and the very tradition of the popular struggle in the 
province of Palermo." It said the campaign resembled "that of 
1947-'48, when the Mafia and the bandit Salvatore Giuliano tried 
to crush the popular peasants' and workers' movement in defence 
of the interests of the dominant classes. They did not succeed 
then, and they shall not succeed now," it went on, expressing 
appreciation for Minister Maroni's visit but calling on the 
Berlusconi government to move from pledges to action and "start 
getting seriously to grips" with the Mafia problem. [passage

Mafia Links Sought"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Chieti, May 19 -- About 10 tons of T-4 
explosive, the same used in three car bombings attributed to 
Cosa Nostra, have disappeared from the deposit of an explosives 
manufacturer in Casalbordino, near this central Italian town, 
police announced Thursday [19 May]. 
  Two former executives of the plant have been arrested on 
charges of unlawful possession of explosives, police added. 
  The T-4 explosives, used to make mines, were deposited at 
the 
plant by the Brescia-based manufacturer, Valsella, in 1985. 
  The National Anti-Mafia Directorate is investigating to 
determine possible connections with the three car bombings, 
which include the May 1992 assassination of judge Giovanni 
Falcone, his wife and three bodyguards in Palermo, Sicily. The 
same explosive was used in the May 14 and July 27 1993 bombings 
in Rome and Milan, respectively. Ten people were injured in the 
Rome explosion, five were killed and 12 injured in Milan.

Withdrawn"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 20 -- The bill proposal to modify 
articles of the Constitution which ban the re-organization of 
the Fascist Party and the return of male members of the House of 
Savoy, Italy's former royal family, has been withdrawn. 
  The bill had been presented at the start of the new 
legislature by the National Alliance, born form the neo-fascist 
MSI [Italian Social Movement]. The MSI traditionally presented 
such a proposal at the start of each legislature, but its 
presentation by the National Alliance [AN] raised an outcry 
given that the National Alliance had promised that it was 
"post-fascist" when entering the government coalition. 
  The withdrawal of the request had been pre-announced by 
National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini and was presented by 
Vincenzo Trantino, of the National Alliance, also on behalf of 
the bill's original sponsors. 
  The government of Premier Silvio Berlusconi has been under 
pressure from both the Left opposition at home and its European 
partners for the presence in the executive of five ministers 
from the National Alliance branded as neo-fascist. Repeated 
calls had been made, in fact, for members of the National 
Alliance to repudiate fascist ideology. 
  The MSI, Italian Social Movement, was formed by members of 
Mussolini's end-of-the-war Italian Social Republic.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Mario Soares by unidentified </F>
reporter; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [FINANCIAL TIMES] Do you believe the European 
Parliament should be given greater powers? 
  [Soares] Yes. We must work towards the creation of a 
European constitution and true European citizenship. This will 
help ensure that the people of Europe become aware that they 
have the ability to influence their own future as Europeans. 
  [FINANCIAL TIMES] Where should the European Union [EU] place 
its greatest economic and social priorities during the next 
three or four years? 
  [Soares] The priorities are to advance to economic and 
monetary union with an effective European Monetary Institute. 
We should not forget the European social charter. Progress in 
the economic and political fields must be matched by advances in 
social affairs. 
  [FINANCIAL TIMES] Is there a danger of a two-speed Europe? 
  [Soares] This is unacceptable. I see Europe as a broad 
space for solidarity between people, regions and countries. The 
existing inequalities, aggravated by an unfavourable economic 
climate, cannot be used as an pretext for creating a two-speed 
Europe. 
  [FINANCIAL TIMES] Should the EU give priority to deepening 
integration among the 12 members or to widening it towards East 
Europe? 
  [Soares] Both policies are equally necessary. There cannot 
be true broadening without deepening. The EU should adopt 
policies aimed at eventually admitting the countries of Central 
and East Europe as full members. 
  [FINANCIAL TIMES] Are you worried that German unification 
and a shift in the EU's centre of gravity to the east and north 
could harm Portugal's interests? 
  [Soares] There is an unquestionable possibility of this 
happening. The EU should take steps to avoid this development. 
  [FINANCIAL TIMES] Will assistance for poorer EU states 
inevitably have to be cut after the expiry of the 1993-99 
package? 
  [Soares] It is important, necessary, and urgent to supply 
aid to Central and East Europe. But this should not be done at 
the price of reducing aid to southern European countries, which 
are full members of the European Union. Aid should continue for 
as long as inequalities between countries justify it. 
  [FINANCIAL TIMES] Is European monetary union in 1999 still 
practicable? 
  [Soares] Europe has lately been gripped by pessimism over 
the potential of the European project. Some voices describe it 
as utopian. I do not share this opinion. Only by pressing 
forward towards full European union, with realism and 
resolution, will we overcome our difficulties.

  [Text] Lisbon, May 23 (CTK) -- Czech Foreign Minister 
Josef Zieleniec began a two-day visit to Portugal today, the 
first visit on this level in the history of Czech-Portuguese 
relations. 
  Shortly upon his arrival he met Chairman of the Assembly of 
the Republic Antonio Moreira Barbosa de Melo to discuss the 
question of the Czech Republic's joining the European Union (EU) 
and other European structures. 
  During the talks Zieleniec presented the Czech Republic as a 
stable country, which wants through its own strength to become 
an economically and politically equal partner of European 
countries. Our foreign policy wants to dissolve the fears of the 
EU so-called south wing, to which the EU economically less 
advanced countries belong, that after being accepted to the EU 
the Czech Republic would pump money out of its funds and would 
thus restrict the development resources of these countries. 
Everything indicates that Lisbon understands this fact. 
  Portugal is the third EU country to ratify an agreement on 
the Czech Republic's associate membership of the EU. By 
ratifying the document on May 12, the Portugese parliament 
endorsed the process of the Czech Republic's integration into 
Europe. 
  The problem of the Czech Republic's succession to agreements 
signed by Portugal and the former Czechoslovakia is the second 
important point on Zieleniec's agenda. Besides an agreement on 
cultural and scientific cooperation this problem also concerns 
the economic field. An agreement on the prevention of double 
taxation between the two countries is to be signed on Tuesday.

  [Text] Lisbon, May 23 (CTK) -- Czech Foreign Minister 
Josef Zieleniec told journalists he tried to "diffuse possible 
fears" that (once in the European Union) the Czech Republic 
might "deprive the weaker countries of aid from the 
restructuring funds" in his meeting today with Portuguese 
parliamentary chairman Antonio Moreira Barbosa de Melo. 
  The Czech Republic intended to enter the EU well prepared 
and 
use up none of the funds, he said. Indeed, the Czech Republic 
wanted to become one of the richest countries in the Union and 
itself contribute to the funds, said Zieleniec, who began a 
two-day visit to Portugal today. 
  It emerged from the meeting that Portugal is prepared to 
support the Czech Republic in its efforts to join the EU, he 
said. Portugal was looking for a way into Europe for the Czech 
Republic with the understanding that results from its similar 
historical and geopolitical situation: a country of 
approximately the same size and number of inhabitants, which has 
recently shaken off a totalitarian regime, he said. 
  Pragmatically speaking, Czech admission to the EU might 
assure Portugal of an ally which would defend the joint 
interests of smaller nations in the EU, he said. 
  The agenda of Zieleniec's visit includes discussions 
tomorrow 
with Portuguese Defense Minister Jose Manuel Durao Barros and 
Premier Anibal Cavaco Silva. 
  An autumn visit to Prague by Portuguese President Maria 
Soares and Czech Trade and Industry Minister Vladimir Dlouhy's 
planned visit to Lisbon in July should contribute to the closer 
relations being fostered between Portugal and the Czech Republic.

<F P=106> [Article signed NI: "State Visit by Polish President Lech </F>
Walesa: `I Have Not Come To Beg, We Want To Do Business With 
You'"] 
  [Text] Bern, 25 May (ATS) -- Polish President Lech Walesa 
was welcomed with all due honors to Bern on Wednesday [25 May]. 
At a news conference with Otto Stich, the president of the 
Confederation, Mr. Walesa thanked Switzerland for its financial 
assistance. However, most of all, he wants to convince the Swiss 
businessmen to invest in Poland: "We want to do business with 
you and we can do it." 
  "We are close to you and we get along," said Lech Walesa, 
referring to the relationship between Poland and Switzerland. 
"We could cooperate in almost any field of activity. Poland is 
a market with 40 million people; Swiss investors with their 
skills, can only benefit from it," he added. 
  He also called on the Swiss banks to set up branches in 
Poland. The former trade unionist wants to seize the opportunity 
of a roundtable meeting with the Swiss economic circles in 
Zurich on Friday "to convince them of their interest" in working 
with his country. His arguments are also of a political nature: 
"Poland's economic success is a prerequisite for its political 
stability," he stated. In this respect, he stressed the fact 
that the West also had to invest in Russia in order to secure 
its own security. 
  On the issue of the European Union (EU), President Walesa 
thinks that Poland as well as Switzerland have to define their 
position regarding the European integration process. He 
declared that his country had applied for membership to the EU. 
"But there has to be an interest on both sides. For the time 
being, Poland is more interested in joining than Brussels is. 
It is up to us to convince them that it is in their interest," 
he said. 
<H5>  Otto Stich's Warning </H5>
  "You are here among Poland's old friends," said Mr. Stich. 
The president of the Confederation praised Mr. Walesa for being 
"the head of a state which was the first to break away from the 
economic and social order of communism in the former East Bloc." 
On the economic issue, he too thinks that private investments 
in Poland should replace the assistance from the Confederation 
in the long term. 
  Mr. Stich underlined that the substantial assistance from 
Switzerland to this country aimed at reinforcing the nascent 
democracy and he gave a warning: "In East Europe, democracy 
seems to be mixed up with market economy, or even with rapid 
enrichment. And some people -- not only in the East -- are 
dangerously inclined to temporarily restrict democratic rights 
to accelerate the economic reforms." 
  Poland receives a total of 311 million [currency not 
specified], and is by far the largest beneficiary of the 
financial assistance and the technical cooperation from 
Switzerland. In Mr. Stich's opinion, the deficit in the federal 
finances should not hinder continued assistance. 
  On Thursday Mr. and Mrs. Walesa will travel to the Canton of 
Soleure, home of President Stich. They will visit the Tadeusz 
Kosciusko Museum -- the hero of Polish liberation who spent the 
final years of his life in Soleure. The president will leave 
Switzerland on Friday after attending a roundtable meeting with 
the Swiss economic circles.

<F P=106> [Article signed NI: "Jakob Kellenberger Back From Middle </F>
East Tour"] 
  [Text] Bern, 24 May (ATS) -- State Secretary Jakob 
Kellenberger talked to the press Tuesday [23 May] about his trip 
to Egypt and Syria last week. He recalled that the peace 
process in the Middle East was still one of the priorities of 
Switzerland's foreign policy. 
  The tour was the logical follow-up to last year's visit to 
Israel and Jordan. Mr. Kellenberger repeated that Switzerland 
was prepared to step up its current support for the 
negotiations, support which is manifested in its participation 
in various multilateral negotiations (on water, refugees, arms 
control, economic development, and the environment). 
  According to the state secretary, Egypt is showing more 
optimism than Syria toward the peace process. Syria is still 
taking a hardline stance toward Israel with regard to the Golan 
Heights. Located between the two countries, the Heights were 
captured by Israel in 1967 and subsequently annexed. U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who was shuttling between 
Damascus and Jerusalem recently, feels however that Syria has 
softened its position slightly on the timetable for an Israeli 
withdrawal. 
  At the bilateral level, relations between the two countries 
and Switzerland are "good," Mr. Kellenberger said. Economically 
speaking, however, relations are more intense with Egypt. Syria 
also let it be known that it wants to attract more Swiss 
investment. In Cairo, the state secretary also discussed the 
partial reconversion of Egypt's debt to Switzerland and 
development projects in that country. An agreement to this end 
is currently being negotiated.

<F P=106> [Article signed ZC/LL: "Safety of Nuclear Plants: Lack of </F>
Personnel Within a Federal Division"] 
  [Text] Bern, 18 May (ATS) -- The main division for the 
safety of nuclear plants (DSN) suffers from a lack of personnel. 
Eduard Kiener, director of the Federal Office for Energy (OFE), 
made this statement on Wednesday evening [18 May] during the 
Rundschau program on the German-language television network. He 
added that he had already expressed this opinion before a 
parliamentary commission, but that he had not received any 
answer yet. 
  An OFE report, which has not been published so far, 
indicates 
that the DSN requires 15 to 18 additional persons. Questioned 
by journalists of the Rundschau program, Mr. Kiener said that if 
a critical event should happen, it could be said that the DSN 
does not have enough personnel. According to him, parliament is 
partly responsible for this situation because of its "personnel 
freeze" policy. 
<H5>  Beznau II </H5>
  The Rundschau program also revealed that the operation of 
the 
Beznau II Nuclear Plant has been modified, which has led to an 
increased level of radioactivity in the pressure containers of 
the reactors. [DSN director] Naegelin said this issue would be 
closely examined. There will not be any increased risk. If a 
negative result should appear, there is still time to take 
corrective measures, he added. According to Mr. Naegelin, even 
though the plant does not meet the current technical standards 
for safety, the measures taken are sufficient.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "14.7 Percent Polled in Favor of </F>
Berlusconi as King"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Milan, May 19 -- Asked if they would like to 
see Premier and Forza Italia leader Silvio Berlusconi as king of 
Italy, 14.7 percent of the 1,016 Italians questioned by Directa 
pollsters via telephone over a three-day period (May 16, 17 and 
18) said "yes." The pollsters, who questioned a sample of adult 
men and women from 95 cities and towns throughout the country, 
made the results known today. 
  Among those most in favor of Berlusconi as king were those 
living on the islands (27.8 percent) and in the south (19.2), 
persons over the age of 54 (20.1), those having little formal 
education (23.1), practicing Catholics (20.7), and housewives 
(more than one in four, while a little over half were against). 
  Among those opposed to "King Silvio" were those living in 
the 
northeast (89.7 percent), students (92.8), industrialists, 
business executives and professionals (89.3), diplomats and 
college graduates (85.2) and males, in general (79.5). 
  Out of the total polled, 74.1 percent responded, while 11.2 
percent said they had no opinion on the matter of Berlusconi as 
king.

<F P=106> [Report signed "r.r." report: "Progressive Forces Promote </F>
`Anti-Berlusconi Bill'"] 
  [Text] Rome -- It is called "Regulations on Conflicts of 
Interests," comprises a single article, and has been signed by 
more than half (41) the senators of the caucus so it can start 
to be examined within a month of its introduction to the 
committee stage. With this bill, the progressive forces brought 
into parliament the battle for observance of the principle of 
distinction between the vested interests of the owner of a 
company and the administration of public affairs. Several 
people have said that this principle has been violated or at 
least placed in jeopardy by the dual roles that Silvio 
Berlusconi adopted by becoming prime minister as well as owner 
of Fininvest. 
  The article of the bill (Pasquino's name is at the top of 
the 
list of signatories) states as follows: "A government post 
cannot be filled by someone who has a substantial share in 
either the ownership or the management of, or who in any case 
even indirectly controls, firms or companies that have reached, 
or are reaching, contracts with the state administration or with 
public agencies subject to state control, or who have received 
concessions or licenses from these same administrations or who 
acquire ownership of them." 
  This proposal does not proceed from any "punitive" 
intentions 
with respect to the government coalition, the report specifies, 
because if the government's action were to be approved, "it 
would be completely above the present justified suspicions." In 
his reply to Berlusconi [Democratic Party of the Left, PDS, 
Secretary] Achille Occhetto reaffirmed that he believes that 
this government "humiliates Italy because of the unfitness of 
the cabinet, the intrigues and maneuverings that accompanied its 
formation, and the violation of the promises made to the voters, 
as well as the stern warning issued by the president." "Our 
opposition," he continued, "will nevertheless be democratic and 
constitutional." 
  However, there are arguments on the Left about what to do in 
order to defeat the coalition led by Berlusconi in the future. 
Mayor of Venice Massimo Cacciari said in an interview with SETTE 
that he wants to "engage in politics more in earnest" and feels 
inclined to take up a possible challenge to become leader of the 
Left: "There are certain challenges that I cannot ignore. If I 
receive a challenge, I will rise to it." On the subject of the 
March elections, he said: "The defeat could very easily have 
been averted; a little expertise would have been enough." SETTE 
also recalled a remark made by Cacciari before the November 
elections, when he announced that he would withdraw from 
politics if he lost: "Failed leaders are failures." 
  After reading the press agency reports, which did not 
include 
this last remark, [PDS deputy] Fabio Mussi commented: "I 
consider it quite legitimate for him to put himself forward as a 
candidate for the PDS leadership, if not now, then perhaps `very 
soon.' If he does so, I assume he expects to receive somebody's 
votes, since only Berlusconi within Forza Italia is voteless. 
So, as an ordinary PDS member and deputy for Piombino, I will 
tell you now how I would vote: against. For the present I call 
for an end to this free-for- all, which is so debilitating for 
the PDS and the Left." There were further criticisms from 
Franco Bassanini (opposed to the idea of Luigi Spaventa as prime 
minister of a shadow cabinet) who advised Cacciari to 
concentrate on Venice, "and thus earn the qualifications on 
which to base other legitimate, but for the present untimely, 
aspirations."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Opposition Bids for Watchdog </F>
Commitees, as Government Parties Divide House Committee 
Chairmanships"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 19 -- The opposition Progressive 
Alliance, headed by the Democratic Party of the Left, and the 
former Christian Democrats of the People's Party are working to 
secure the chairs of the so-called watchdog committees and 
panels, while the government parties move to take the chairs of 
the thirteen House regular committees. 
  The bid by the opposition to chair the bicameral commission 
on the national broadcasting corporation RAI and the anti-Mafia 
commission, as well as the panels on elections and parliamentary 
immunity, received a boost here on Thursday [19 May] when House 
whips postponed any decision on the matter until next week. 
  Speaking to the press after today's meeting, Forza Italia 
whip Raffaele Della Valle said "We are open to the possibility 
that some watchdog commissions could go to the opposition and 
now think it necessary to consult with our representatives in 
the Senate and then, eventually, even with members of the 
opposition." 
  "Before defining the make-up of the panels" added Raffaele 
Valensise, of the National Alliance, "we must see what those in 
the Senate think and try to hammer out a common platform." 
  People's Party whip Beniamino Andreatta said before today's 
meeting that the RAI and anti-Mafia should go to the opposition 
"because this is how it is done in all majority democracies 
where the opposition is recognized the role of control." The 
People's Party whip went on to agree that the powers of the 
majority should be reinforced but that this should correspond 
with the reinforcement of the opposition powers of control. 
"The bottom line is this: the RAI and anti-Mafia commissions 
should go to members of the opposition. There is the problem of 
credibility.... There are some things which give rise to 
suspicion and great concern for the future. No majority 
democratic country exists where the majority crowds the control 
commissions." 
  Andreatta, however, was of a different mood coming out of 
the 
meeting which he told the press has "produced results." The 
People's Party whip went on to say how discussion did not focus 
on details but on questions of principal. "We are talking about 
organizing a majority democracy, the principal of democracy 
cannot be winner-take-all. There exists" Andreatta added, "a 
criteria of reason, of separate roles in parliament, in the 
institutions, the possibility that each performs their task." 
  Similar views were expressed by Luigi Berlinguer, the 
Progressive whip, who argued "In the absence of precise rules, 
we ask that there be a global discussion on who should chair the 
control commissions, which by logic should go to the 
opposition." Berlinguer went on to add how the government 
coalition had made no promises, but that "the outcome 
(postponement) of the meeting was a sign that discussion is 
open." 
  Meanwhile, in related developments, the government coalition 
appeared geared to take all the chairs of the regular thirteen 
House committees, with five going to Northern League, four to 
Forza Italia, three to the National Alliance and one to the 
Christian Democratic Center. 
  The National Alliance appeared in line to chair the 
committees for constitutional affairs, foreign affairs and 
financial affairs with their candidates Gustavo Selva, Mirko 
Tremaglia and Paolo Agostinacchio, respectively. 
  Forza Italia was said to be in line to chair the committees 
for culture, with Vittorio Sgarbi; justice, Tiziana Maiolo; 
budget, Silvio Liotta; and productive activities, Alessandro 
Rubino. 
  Indications are that the Northern League committee chairs 
could go to Riccardo Fragassi or Paolo Bampo for defense; 
Roberto Castelli for the environment and public works; Uber 
Anghinoni for agriculture. The League has also proposed either 
Fiorello Provera or Roberto Calderoli for social affairs and 
Marco Sartori to chair the labor committee. 
  Despite its opening to the opposition on the chairs, Forza 
Italia was said to be ready to propose Tina Lagostena and Marco 
Taradash to chair the equal opportunities and RAI commissions 
respectively.

<F P=106> ["P. Fr." report: "Micro-Achille, Mega-Massimo: The </F>
Progressives Are Fond of Venice's Mayor-Philosopher"] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- Venice progressive Mayor Massimo Cacciari 
will not stand as a candidate to lead the progressives, at least 
not for the time being. Nor will he stand as a candidate -- it 
goes without saying -- to lead the Democratic Party of the Left. 
Instead, he made an appeal to set up "an organizational 
structure, a network, and strong coordination system" at once. 
Such a structure is to represent "all the forces within the 
Left," but it must also be genuinely open "to the Catholic 
Center and to social Catholicism," that is to say, to the 
Italian Popular Party and to Mario Segni's Pact for Italy. Who 
will lead the coalition will be decided later. 
  The mayor-philosopher explained: "The choice of a leader for 
the coalition cannot be linked to the choice of a party leader. 
Starting from the grassroots and the platforms, the 
coordinating structures will put forward their proposals, as the 
need arises, concerning who should stand for the mayorship in a 
given town, who should lead a given region, and who should lead 
the national government." 
  The battle is therefore postponed or perhaps it has just 
begun. The numerous participants in the progressive convention 
organized in Rome by Micromega had to make a virtue of necessity 
and to be satisfied with comparing the new Left's various 
possible leaders, who were presented to the public at the 
convention. Among them was Cacciari, of course. [L'UNITA 
editor] Walter Veltroni, however, was there too, although he 
proudly denied having any ambitions in this respect and, from 
the platform, spoke against the "implosion" which had taken 
place on the Left following the elections, and against 
"searching for a leader in the manner of a beauty contest, with 
hundreds of opinion polls in the newspapers." Among those 
present was also Naples mayor Antonio Bassolino, in whose town 
--contrary to what happened in the north, including Venice -- 
the Left was undoubtedly not wiped out on 27 March. Making it 
clear that the Italian Communist Party tradition, to which he 
belonged, was not just the garbage imagined by most observers, 
he forcefully explained how leaders cannot be invented sitting 
at a table after a defeat, and he even displayed a certain 
fastidiousness at the very word which was on everyone's lips 
within the Left: revenge. Finally, in order to complete the 
picture of the participants in this (so far) purely imaginary 
game, two potential outsider candidates were also on display: 
Rome Mayor Francesco Rutelli and Bologna Mayor Walter Vitali, 
who -- without his knowledge -- was nominated as a candidate by 
IL MANIFESTO a few days ago. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Craxi Will Return, Attorney Says"] </F>
  [Text] (ANSA) Milan, May 18 -- Former Italian Socialist 
Party leader Bettino Craxi, who has been ordered to surrender 
his passport and other travel papers, will turn in these 
documents to the justice department here as soon as he is 
physically capable of doing so, his attorney, Salvatore Lo 
Giudice, said here on Wednesday [18 May]. 
  Yesterday, Craxi sent a medical certificate from a Tunisian 
doctor, by fax, to the justice department which stated that the 
former premier was undergoing treatment for diabetes and thus 
could not leave his holiday home on the Tunisian coast, in 
Hammamet. 
  Lo Giudici went to the justice department today to 
illustrate 
his client's position and later told the press "the justice 
department has put no ultimatum for Craxi to turn in his 
passport given that this is an executive measure." 
  Craxi's attorney then added how "the health of my client is 
my concern at the moment. Besides, Mr. Craxi has always 
demonstrated the utmost readiness to collaborate and as soon as 
he has resolved his health problems he will be at the 
disposition of the justice department here." 
  The magistrates handling the preliminary investigation into 
Craxi's alleged wrong-doings also confirmed how no further 
measures would, at present, be adopted against Craxi. "There's 
no rush" said Maurizio Grigo who also made it clear they were 
waiting for some signal of intent from Craxi's retreat in 
Hammamet. 
  In the meantime, the magistrates were said to be examining 
the various bilateral agreements between Italy and Tunisia 
should it become necessary to seek Craxi's extradition in the 
event he stay abroad to avoid arrest.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Arrigo Levi: "Keep an Eye on the World"] </F>
  [Text] Meanwhile, back in the world, a lot has been 
happening, and Italy's absence from the world, between one 
government and another, cannot go on much longer, because a lot 
of these things, indeed many of the most important things, 
directly involve us. 
  First and foremost, Europe. We have no doubt as to the 
strong personal commitment of the new foreign minister, Antonio 
Martino, who now holds the portfolio once held by his father at 
a historic moment for both Italy and Europe; and we have 
confidence in his capacity to to take account of the current 
situation, devising possible personal changes of key (of a 
Thatcherite timbre, it has been said) in a Europeanism that must 
be innate in the son of Gaetano Martino. As we see it, one fact 
stands out above all the others. 
  The European Union has proved that it can withstand displays 
of nationalist whims and tantrums from one or another of the 
major powers at any one time -- first France, then England; when 
this happens, the process of unification is impaired or slowed 
down in various ways, but it does not come to a standstill. But 
the European project, with the Maastricht Treaty as its charter, 
would suffer serious damage should there be two, and not one, of 
the major powers making up the Union rowing against the tide at 
the same time. 
  I have always maintained that we must "be understanding 
toward the English," make allowances when they flare up or dig 
their heels in, and give their insular instincts time to adjust 
to their new European destiny. But if the instinctive 
reluctance of the English were to find encouragement in another 
major power, Italy, for instance--if a "Rome-London axis" 
committed to slowing down the constitutional negotiations that 
are about to begin in preparation for the 1996 intergovernmental 
Conference were to be formed--the damage done to Europe would be 
extremely grave. 
  It would really be tempting providence to place most of the 
weight of the European project on the shoulders of Germany 
(which Germany? Kohl is still a giant, but for how much 
longer?) and of a France of an uncertain political color, as 
this project will have the difficult task of devising mechanisms 
for adjusting to the inevitable complexities of enlargement 
eastward. 
<H5>  Continuity </H5>
  Good relations between Rome and London have always been 
useful in playing down the English sense of isolation in the 
face of the great Franco-German entente, but only provided that 
Rome works hard to involve London in the European process, 
certainly not if it fosters nationalist instincts. 
  This must be the reasoning behind Italy's European policy 
commitment to "continuity," as announced by the new government. 
Italy's other, no less crucial, contribution to the European 
project is to pursue and promote our economy's compliance with 
the Maastricht criteria. This is in our own interest, even more 
than it is in the European interest. 
  If we take a look at Europe, and all the more so if we list 
our other immediate and imminent foreign policy priorities, 
starting with the Naples summit, hovering between the G-7 and 
G-8, and potential commitments, including those of a military 
nature, in the former Yugoslavia, we must stress another 
fundamental aspect. Following, among other factors, the 
revolution that has taken place in communications and 
telecommunications, foreign policy nowadays involves heads of 
government directly and forces them to take direct 
responsibility for the major decisions at their meetings. 
Suffice it to mention the fact that the G-7 summits repeatedly 
see them seated alone around a table, with their ministers and 
advisers relegated to seats against the wall or to another room. 
<H5>  Little Experience </H5>
  A head of state or government with little experience of 
international affairs, or with little interest in them -- the 
case of President Clinton is a glaring example -- weakens not 
only the action taken by his or her country but the efficiency 
of the whole international system. 
  I made similar remarks when commenting in this paper on the 
birth of the De Mita government back on 14 April 1988. I 
pointed out how the machinery of world politics made it 
essential that "every head of government assume strong personal 
responsibility." And I emphasized how this was the area in 
which De Mita, who was "deeply immersed in our domestic 
politics, but an `object of mystery' to the rest of the world," 
would face "perhaps his most difficult personal test in terms of 
both image and substance," as he would, moreover, have to "throw 
himself into a hectic round of international summits" (even 
then!). I recall that Giulio Andreotti, with all his 
experience, was appointed foreign minister. And they did not 
have the burden of the "postfascists" in the government to 
contend with. Just six years have gone by since then, but it 
feels like a century. 
  History repeats itself; and I have no different words for 
describing the challenge that new Prime Minister Silvio 
Berlusconi, another "object of mystery," will have to face over 
the next few days and weeks. Do not neglect foreign policy, Mr. 
Berlusconi; at the end of the day, this is perhaps where your 
stature as a politician will find its measure.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Paolo Mieli: "Three Questions Remain"] </F>
  [Text] It must not be considered an anomaly that yesterday 
evening's Senate session granted (with one vote more than the 
quorum and by four votes over the opposition) a vote of 
confidence in the government headed by Silvio Berlusconi, even 
though on paper it did not command a majority in that chamber. 
It is neither anomalous nor something definitive or irreversible 
which, for instance, could not be overturned when it comes to 
debating issues of great importance or constitutional 
amendments. Yesterday the Senate acknowledged the fact that, 
thanks to the winner-take-all system, the coalition led by the 
new prime minister won the elections and decided that it was 
correct to put it to the test. This, even though it lacks an 
absolute majority of seats in the chamber headed by 
Scognamiglio. Let us say at once that we consider this a display 
of wisdom. For the opposition forces, too, it is better, much 
better, to reserve their strength for fundamental matters of 
principle rather than to waste it in a hazardous venture whose 
outcome is uncertain. Furthermore, we must accustom ourselves to 
the fact that this is in the nature of a winner-take-all system: 
At least with regard to the coalition or party that is to 
govern, it is the people who decide. If something does not 
work, no recourse to bizarre parliamentary conjuring should 
normally be permitted. Unless in the case of temporary 
solutions, the only way to obviate this kind of problem is to 
hold another election. 
  The left-wing and center forces must understand the 
fundamental significance of the electoral law that they 
themselves desired: It must be the voters, the people, who 
decide not only on the balance of forces in Parliament, but also 
who should occupy the government seats and who should occupy the 
opposition seats. The only opportunity to try to reverse the 
situation is through an election. 
  Does this mean that from now on all that the Left and the 
Center can do in Parliament is to perform a mere supervisory 
role? And that it is of no consequence that the opposition 
forces in the Senate are stronger (numerically) than those of 
the government? Not at all. But this advantage must be used 
wisely, on issues of vital importance over which they are 
prepared to face an electoral challenge in the near future. 
  Thus the period in which the government coalition was able 
to 
consider it a right that the Senate grant it the majority that 
it lacksr came to an end yesterday. Now they will have to earn 
anything more. And bland reassurances will not be enough. 
  With regard to the promises made during the election 
campaign, there is not much to be said: The voters will judge 
whether or not they have been honored. However, there is 
something to be said with regard to two or three other matters. 
  First, the separation between Berlusconi the businessman (in 
the media field, moreover) and Berlusconi the politician. 
Agreed, as he himself said, the entire country will be watching 
him. But that is not enough. The prime minister must consider 
it his obligation to make it known soon whether, and if so how 
and within what timeframe he intends to separate the businessman 
from the politician. 
  Second, the presence of postfascist ministers and under 
secretaries in the government. As we have already said, we do 
not believe that a restoration of the Mussolini regime is under 
way in Italy. Not even in a more modern guise, better suited to 
the approach of the year 2000. But Berlusconi and even 
[National Alliance leader] Fini can do much more to make it 
clear to the country, and above all to the rest of the world, 
that fascism is not only something which died 50 years ago and 
about which everyone has his own opinions. Antitotalitarian 
values, which Mr. Fini, too, says he has espoused, must be truly 
alive. There must be no more little mistakes, gaffes, ambiguous 
remarks: We cannot permit ourselves for a single moment to 
yield to the "new apathy" that we have been obliged to condemn 
several times recently in these columns. 
  Last, there is the issue of guarantees -- and for the moment 
we will confine ourselves to consider those affecting parliament 
-- for those who are not part of this majority. Here too, so 
far there have been errors, gaffes, and rash remarks. Very 
well, we want to know as soon as possible the names of the 
committee chairmen on which the government majority has the 
final say and the other public appointments with respect to 
which the winners of the elections will be foregoing the 
practice of military occupation. Let this be clear: Nobody 
wants new forms of associationism, horse trading, and confusion 
between winners and losers in the 27 March elections. But since 
it is the custom in all civilized countries that the opposition 
forces can enjoy means of control, it is time for the government 
to make absolutely clear which posts it intends to grant to its 
adversaries and which to independents (chosen jointly with the 
opposition) providing guarantees of impartial conduct. 
  These three are only a few issues, but they are crucial 
ones. 
We hope that the opposition too will concentrate on them in a 
concrete and constructive manner. This means abandoning the 
pointless and wasteful daily lamentations in which it has 
recently tried in vain to drown its post-electoral 
disappointment.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "France/Italy: Berlusconi in French </F>
Poll"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Paris, May 17 -- Some 54 percent of the 
French feel that Italy's European Union [EU] partners should 
boycott the hard-right National Alliance ministers in Prime 
Minister Silvio Berlusconi's cabinet and half see the new 
premier as a "populist demagogue," but 48 percent believe the 
Berlusconi phenomenon could be repeated in France, according to 
a poll published by the French Catholic weekly, LA VIE. 
  The poll indicated that 68 percent of the sample see a 
"significant" risk of a growth in neo-fascism in Europe, and 
only 26 percent believe there is no such risk. Italy's National 
Alliance, which has five ministers in the Berlusconi government, 
was known until earlier this year as the Italian Social 
Movement, the post-war heir to Benito Mussolini's Fascist Party. 
  According to the LA VIE poll, only 28 percent of the sample 
believe the EU should impose no boycott on the Alliance 
ministers and 18 percent had no opinion, just as many as denied 
that Berlusconi is a "populist demagogue." 
  But even if many French are critical of Berlusconi's 
political style, as many as 37 percent believe he may have the 
qualities to get Italy back on the rails. Thirty percent 
disagreed with this suggestion. The poll suggested that 36 
percent of the sample believe the Berlusconi phenomenon would be 
impossible in France, while 16 percent didn't know.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "European Union: Italy Risks </F>
Missing Maastricht Deadlines"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 19 -- The new Italian minister for 
European Union affairs, Domenico Comino of the Northern League, 
voiced his concern Thursday [19 May] that Italy may not be able 
to meet the 1996 deadlines set in the Maastricht Treaty on 
European Union [EU] for economic integration. 
  In a meeting with the press to illustrate his ministerial 
game plan, Comino, 39, recalled how his position had no 
negotiation powers and thus he saw his task more of one to 
coordinate the actions of the other ministries in a European 
Union framework. 
  Comino went on to suggest adopting a "blue stamp" to be 
applied to measures taken by Parliament which are in line with 
European Union regulations and laws. In this way, he observed, 
his office would not have to dedicate 50 percent of its time 
trying to resolve conflicts between Italy and the European Union 
which much of the time are born from conflicts between laws and 
regulations more than Italy's failure to adopt EU laws. 
  The minister then went on to suggest the creation of 
"trans-national socio-economic areas" which would serve as a 
link in the European Union decision-making process during the 
initial stage, when precise projects are drawn up. 
  Comino also stressed the need for Italy to play a more 
leading role in the European Union, "a more qualified presence," 
with less emphasis on its presence in the bureaucratic apparatus. 
  Asked to comment on the reaction of Italy's European Union 
partners to the presence in the Rome executive of ministers from 
the National Alliance, the rightist party born from the 
neo-fascist MSI [Italian Social Movement], Comini replied 
"Foreign Minister Martino has already re-assured the Europeans" 
and that on this question "there has been a lot of exploitation 
by many sides."

  [Text] Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana is in Paris 
for the Conference on Stability in Europe, where representatives 
of 57 countries -- most of them foreign ministers of the 
European Union [EU], Russia, and Canada -- are meeting. The aim 
of this conference is to avoid new border and minority problems 
in Central and East European countries that plan to join the EU. 
  [Begin recording] [Solana] What means do we have at our 
disposal? We have the idea that, ultimately these countries 
will become EU members. That is a good incentive. We can also 
help them financially so some of these problems can be solved. 
This is the aim of this conference, all of it in the framework 
of the CSCE. We hope that in a year's time, that is to say in 
1995, the situation will be stable. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Baudouin Bollaert report: "Paris Conference: An Antiwar </F>
Plan for Europe"] 
  [Excerpt] The Conference [on Stability in Europe] is an 
exercise in "preventive diplomacy" intended, above all, for the 
countries of East Europe that want to join the European Union 
[EU]. Hence its limitations. 
  Fifty-seven countries or international organizations, 
including the United States and Russia, will be represented at 
the opening session of the Conference on Stability in Europe, 
which is being held at the UNESCO headquarters in Paris. This 
French initiative, the brainchild of [Prime Minister] Edouard 
Balladur, has been taken up by the EU and, according to a senior 
official at the French Foreign Ministry, constitutes "the first 
real sign of common foreign and security policy as defined at 
Maastricht." 
  With a wide variety of bodies such as the Council of Europe, 
the CSCE, NATO, the WEU [Western European Union], the North 
Atlantic Cooperation Council, and the Partnership for Peace, 
there is no shortage of organizations responsible for ensuring 
peace in continental Europe. However, now we are being asked to 
believe that they are not sufficient. Hence the idea of this 
conference, which, within one year, should lead to a stability 
pact under the auspices of the CSCE. 
  "The diplomatic response to a problem is traditionally to 
create an institution or to publish a long declaration," said 
Edouard Balladur. This time, he said, "it has been decided to 
intervene at the very source of the problem itself, by seeking 
to resolve the questions concerning minorities and borders via 
the implementation of pragmatic measures. The example of 
Yugoslavia, which demonstrates the dangers of leaving questions 
in abeyance or unresolved, is probably prominent in everybody's 
mind." 
  Consequently, according to [French Foreign Minister] Alain 
Juppe, it will be a question of proceeding with an exercise in 
"preventive diplomacy." However, by deliberately placing it 
within the perspective of the EU, the French foreign minister 
has excluded the hottest dossiers: Bosnia, Kosovo, the Crimea 
or Caucasus, etc. In short, "the plan applies precisely to the 
area where there are no problems," said one British diplomatic 
ironically. 
  This renders no less laudable the objective being sought, 
namely to ensure that the countries counted as candidate EU 
member states (Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, 
Romania, Bulgaria, Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania) establish 
relations built on trust at regional level, by signing 
reciprocal good neighborliness agreements. This is something 
that Alain Lamassoure, [French] minister delegate for European 
affairs, sums up in the following terms: "We are ready to 
welcome new members, but not new sources of conflict." After 
having adopted a final document reiterating the main principles 
of the CSCE (respect for human rights and the rights of 
minorities, etc.), the participants in the conference will have 
to have "multilateral or regional discussions" in order to try 
and settle, for instance, the fate of the Hungarian minorities 
in Romania and Slovakia, or that of the Russian minorities in 
the Baltic states. 
  "We will have to combine the strong political impetus given 
by the EU and the Paris conference with great flexibility in the 
methods of negotiation, bearing in mind the subjects treated. 
The important thing is to stipulate an obligation to achieve a 
result," says Paris. An interim conference could be scheduled 
for the end of the year to evaluate the progress being made, and 
the final conference at which the stability pact will be adopted 
could be held "during the first half, or even the first quarter, 
of 1995," said Alain Juppe. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Paris, May 27 (AFP) -- European foreign 
ministers agreed Friday [27 May] on measures aimed at preventing 
border conflicts in East Europe and solving problems over ethnic 
minorities. [passage omitted] 
  Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev, addressing fellow 
ministers, welcomed the planned pact, but warned it might 
conflict with the Conference on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe (CSCE). 
  Accords reached at the roundtables will be enshrined in a 
Stability Pact which could be signed early in 1995 and 
registered with the CSCE. [passage omitted] 
  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe denied at a press 
conference that the stability conference was duplicating 
existing organisations such as the CSCE. 
  The stability conference was "filling a vacuum" and was "not 
a CSCE mark-2, nor another Council of Europe nor a Western 
European Union," Juppe said. 
  The foreign minister said that the CSCE had not undertaken 
any action on behalf of the Hungarian minorities, for example, 
and that it was the special interest of the EU to sponsor 
efforts to solve the problems of future members. 
  Juppe hailed the conference as "a great success," but 
insisted that "the essential remains to be done" in preparing 
accords to be slotted into the Stability Pact. 
  He said the conference would disappear "within a year" when 
the pact was inaugurated. 
  One of 10 countries listed as a potential new member -- 
Slovenia -- was dropped in the final draft of potential new 
members, leaving Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, 
Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. 
  The move illustrated that some existing EU members also have 
minority problems. Officially Slovenia was removed because it 
has no association agreement with the EU, but Slovenian 
conference sources said the new Italian government had applied 
pressure on behalf of the 3,0O0-strong Slovenian minority in 
Italy agitating to recover their property in Slovenia. 
  The conference turned down a plea by Hungarian Foreign 
Minister Geza Jeszensky for direct participation by 1.6 million 
Hungarian-speakers in Romania and 600,000 in Slovakia in its 
regional roundtable. Budapest is anxious to protect their 
rights to autonomy, notably in the cultural field, while the 
Romanian and Slovakian Governments are seeking Hungarian 
acceptance of the inviolability of existing borders. 
  Kozyrev insisted the focus should be "to concentrate on 
specific steps to improve interethnic relations and to ensure 
the rights of national minorities. This is especially necessary 
for the three Baltic states -- Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania," 
he added. 
  He said discussion of border and minority issues "should 
take 
place exclusively in the framework established by CSCE 
documents." 
  But the tone of the conference was set on Thursday by 
Balladur and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. In a joint opinion 
column in the daily LE MONDE, the two leaders proposed that the 
would-be EU members be invited to attend Union summit meetings.

<F P=106> ["A.B." report: "Europe: The Conference on the Continent's </F>
Stability: Averting the Yugoslav Syndrome"] 
  [Text] The Conference on Stability in Europe started 
yesterday in Paris with the wish expressed by Prime Minister 
Edouard Balladur to make every effort to ensure that minority or 
border conflicts in East Europe do not turn into open conflicts 
as in the former Yugoslavia. 
  A little more than a year after proposing the idea in his 
general policy statement, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur opened 
the Conference on Stability in Europe in Paris yesterday, which 
has the aim of establishing a preventive diplomacy on the Old 
Continent. In a brief opening speech, Mr. Balladur argued for a 
"pragmatic and preventive diplomatic method," which he 
contrasted with the "big institutional maneuvers or arrangements 
which are often ephemeral." Although the conference, which is 
being attended by 53 delegations, seems inevitably haunted by 
the Bosnian conflict, the French prime minister expressed the 
desire to make every effort to ensure that minority or border 
conflicts in East Europe do not turn into open conflicts like 
the war in the former Yugoslavia. This war, in which Europe has 
displayed its powerlessness to restore peace, is "a real lesson 
of what we can no longer tolerate," Edouard Balladur said. 
Referring to the criticisms of those who think that the 
proposed Pact for Stability is not "ambitious enough," he said 
that "we have experienced too many good intentions in the past 
which were not followed through." Mr. Balladur recalled in this 
connection the Kellog-Briand Pact concluded after World War I to 
"outlaw war," or the "very complete range of provisions made by 
the League of Nations at the same time to deal, unsuccessfully, 
with minority questions [quotemarks as published]. The prime 
minister also argued for a "different European society," adding 
that we must "start by eliminating old quarrels, by dispelling 
old fears." He also stressed that "nobody would be made to do 
anything he did not wish to do" during the negotiations, 
implicitly rejecting the criticism that the Pact on Security 
could reopen old disputes in East Europe. The French Government 
chief reaffirmed, in this connection, the principle of 
"territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders." With 
regard to national, ethnic, and religious minorities, the rights 
of the individual must be accompanied by a "duty of loyalty" 
toward the country of which they are nationals. 
  The prime minister also addressed his remarks to Russia, 
which expressed once again yesterday its reservations about the 
Pact for Stability. This plan, he stressed several times, is 
not intended to push Moscow to the fringes. The desire of many 
Central and East European countries to join the European Union 
[EU] must go hand-in-hand with the development of "very close 
relations with Russia," he said, adding that the "future big 
Europe" should maintain "preferential partnership relations" 
with Moscow. 
  However, Russia yesterday gave a cool reception to the Pact 
for Stability in Europe at a time when Paris and Bonn are 
proposing to strengthen ties between the Twelve and the 
countries of the former Soviet bloc which want to be anchored 
more firmly in the West. 
  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said that his 
country 
gave preference to the CSCE process, which has involved all the 
continent's countries since 1975. 
  "It is clear that the process launched in Paris on the basis 
of the Twelve plus nine formula (EU and the East European 
countries likely to join it) is unique. It does not create a 
precedent for the future," Mr. Kozyrev warned. Russia has 
several times expressed its anxiety at being pushed to the 
fringes faced with the EU's power of attraction for its former 
satellites. 
  In Edouard Balladur's view, the "objective" is to see the 
Pact for Stability signed "by the beginning of next year, in 
February for instance." However, the prime minsiter took the 
precaution of adding that it might "possibly take longer." 
Indeed, in European circles, some diplomats are casting doubt 
on the ability to finalize the pact before mid-1995, and 
especially before the [French] presidential election. 
Furthermore, this is a period in which France will take over 
the presidency of the EU. Mr. Balladur also stressed that the 
proposed pact had "immediately received the president of the 
Republic's approval" and thanked Alain Juppe, his foreign 
minsiter, for the efforts he has made to ensure its success. 
  In addition, in an interview with LE MONDE, Chancellor 
Helmut 
Kohl and the French prime minister jointly suggested "inviting 
the heads of state and of government of the candidate countries 
once a year" to a meeting with the EU members to discuss 
"questions of common interest and thus extend cooperation." The 
two heads of government think that "the Union has the historical 
duty and common objective of helping the Central and East 
European countries which are implementing reforms to rejoin the 
European family." 
  This initiative aimed at involving the candidate countries 
in 
the EU's work is, it must be stressed, a German initiative. In 
practice it should result in the presence of the four members of 
the Visegrad group (Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, and Slovak 
Republic) at the next European Council meeting in Essen next 
December.

  [Text] REUTER and ATA agencies report that our Foreign 
Minister Alfred Serreqi took the floor in the Conference on 
European Stability, which is being held in Paris. Serreqi 
stressed that our country wishes to be a model of the rights of 
minorities in the Balkans. Despite the noise of the Greek 
international machine, the Greek minority in Albania enjoys full 
rights and freedoms, Serreqi stressed at the conference, 
pointing out the announcements by the Pan-European high 
commissioner regarding human rights. 
  We understand the interest and care of the Greek Government 
for the Greek minority in our country and their situation, but I 
want to avail myself of the opportunity to remind that the 
manipulations that include the Greek minority and other 
minorities in general are dangerous and unacceptable, Serreqi 
stressed. 
  Minister Serreqi called on Greece to accept the Firenze 
Protocol of 1913, which guarantees the borders of Albania. He 
stressed that a fair solution of the Albanian question 
constitutes an important issue in the Balkans. Out of 7 million 
ethnic Albanians distributed in four Balkan countries, only half 
of them live in Albania now, he stressed. Tirana fully supports 
the principle of permanence of borders, and it requests 
democratic space for Albanians in the neighboring countries, the 
minister added. 
  Diplomats consider the question of the rights of the 
Albanian 
majority in Kosova a hot target for a broader conflict in former 
Yugoslavia, Foreign Minister Serreqi stated at this conference.

<F P=106> [Interview with British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd by </F>
Jacques Duplouich; place and date not given: "Hurd: `A Good 
Concept, But Difficult To Translate Into Procedure'"] 
  [Excerpt] [Duplouich] Security and stability in Europe 
have been on the agenda in Paris since yesterday. Can they 
reasonably form the subject of a pact? 
  [Hurd] First, I would like to stress that the initiative 
taken by Mr. Balladur is positive. Of course, it is appropriate 
to examine all aspects of it. However, it must not lead to the 
creation of a new world machinery. There are already enough 
international meetings as it is. But, if it is possible to 
prevent possible antagonism in Central and East Europe through 
diplomacy, then it is worth the effort. 
  [Duplouich] Is this the right way of establishing a new 
peaceful order in Europe? 
  [Hurd] Let us look at things in practice. Look at what is 
happening in the Balkans and further east, in Crimea, for 
instance. These are dangerous situations which may deteriorate 
if no preventive action is taken. And another Bosnia could then 
appear. It is therefore reasonable to invite all those primarily 
concerned by a potential conflict to solve their differences 
before they reach a critical threshold. This is the very 
concept of the Pact for Security and Stability, and it is a good 
concept. The problem is how to translate it into procedure. 
  [Duplouich] Russia has finally agreed to sign the 
Partnership for Peace unconditionally. What is your view of 
this promise? 
  [Hurd] I warmly welcome the Russian decision. This idea of 
a partnership which will create links between Russia and NATO is 
really very ingenious. 
  [Duplouich] But is there not reason to be worried when it 
defense minister, General Grachev, publicly states: "The CIS is 
Russia!"? 
  [Hurd] I recently spoke with Gen. Pavel Grachev and I do not 
recognize this statement which is attributed to him. No, Russia 
accepts the sovereignty of its neighbors. Of course, it has a 
special interest in its relations with them, and the 
international community recognizes that. But this interest must 
be demonstrated in the sphere of international law. Andrey 
Kozyrev, my Russian counterpart, accepts, for instance, that the 
peacekeeping interventions in the neighboring states must be 
organized at the request of the states themselves and not 
unilaterally decided by Moscow. 
<H5>  No Justification for Europessimism </H5>
  [Duplouich] At present Europe is also about the renewal of 
the Strasbourg Parliament. This is an election which is being 
prepared amid virtually universal indifference. What is the 
reason for this apathy? 
  [Hurd] The European Twelve continue to enjoy a prosperity 
and stability which grateful future generations will admire. 
The Union is now emerging from the recession. I therefore see 
no justification for gloom or pessimism. 
  [Duplouich] The fact remains that the one feeling which is 
shared by the Europeans is disillusionment. 
  [Hurd] Allow me to qualify that: There is disillusionment 
with all those who promise too much in Europe's name! The 
lesson is clear: We must beware of promising too much. With 
the Maastricht Treaty, we have a good structure. We must now 
build its success brick by brick on the three pillars on which 
it rests: common foreign and security policy; cooperation on 
crime, drugs, and terrorism; implementation of subsidiarity, 
respect for strict budgetary discipline; and completion of the 
single market. Let us avoid thinking of a new structure before 
we have completed the other. 
  [Duplouich] So, is a pause vital? 
  [Hurd] One of Europe's weaknesses, when faced with 
criticism, has always been to go further, to "do more." What the 
Europeans want is not for us to do "more!" It is to do better 
what is already being done. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Doina Saiciuc dispatch from Paris] </F>
  [Text] About one and a half hours ago at the UNESCO 
headquarters in Paris, Romanian Foreign Affairs Minister Teodor 
Melescanu presented, with the precision and elegance of reason, 
Romania's position regarding the European stability pact. 
  Talking in the plenum of the inaugural conference in Paris, 
the Romanian foreign affairs minister remarked that the 
conference has the historic task of preparing the future by 
erecting the democratic stability of the continent. 
  Bucharest is convinced that this first foreign policy and 
collective security exercise performed by the European Union 
will contribute to the accomplishment of further prerequisites 
to perpetuate European integration by deepening and expanding 
it. The example set by those who laid the foundation of the 
European Community by reaching reconciliation encourages and 
stimulates the political will of the Central European countries 
in the sense of turning their good neighborliness into an 
irreversible framework of their mutual relations. 
  Ethnic diversity, the head of Romanian diplomacy also said, 
is a natural circumstance of our continent. Romania shares the 
idea that ethnic minorities are part of the assets of the 
countries. The protection of ethnic minorities can be ensured 
in a better way if the persons belonging to those minorities 
offer their loyalty to the states. Referring to certain remarks 
made yesterday in the hall of the Paris conference, Mr. 
Melescanu added that the loyalty of persons belonging to ethnic 
minorities to the states they are citizens of is, per se, an 
ample source of stability. 
  Romania also shares the almost unanimously accepted view of 
the participants in the conference in consecrating the 
intergovernmental character of this preventive diplomacy 
exercise, thus guaranteeing its viability and the success of the 
joint efforts. 
  Consultations at national level with the legitimate 
representatives of ethnic minorities cannot be anything but 
beneficial for each of the governments and each of the ethnic 
minorities. Otherwise, putting such dialogues beyond the 
boundaries of law would not only violate international rights, 
but would also act as an obstacle hindering good neighborliness. 
Luckily, the Romanian foreign affairs minister emphasized, the 
unanimous decision of the states attending the conference to 
place the pact on the basis of the principles and norms 
consecrated by the pertinent documents of the United Nations, 
the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, and the 
Council of Europe, is able to prevent such strange and singular 
pretenses [sentence as heard]. 
  Mr. Melescanu reasserted the firm will of the Romanian 
Government to contribute to the success of this initiative by 
continuing and finalizing the negotiations intended to conclude 
bilateral treaties with all neighboring countries, including 
Hungary. Romania also expresses its readiness to include in the 
stability pact the treaties already concluded by Romania with 
other states associated to the European Union as our country's 
specific contribution to the pact. Bucharest also offers to 
host a regional roundtable conference dedicated to ethnic 
minority issues, as well as a regional roundtable conference 
dedicated to issues related to the amelioration of the 
infrastructures in transportation and communications. 
  After noting that the document of the current conference is 
the result of long and laborious negotiations, the Romanian 
minister of foreign affairs stated that the delegation of our 
country is ready to accept its text. 
  The success of the initiative directly depends on the 
wisdom, 
moderation, and the respect of each country for the constructive 
spirit of the project that will begin today after the conclusion 
of the conference. The Romanians, stated Mr. Melescanu, believe 
that the time has come when the prejudices, cliches, and 
exaggeratedly emotional perceptions in the relations between 
neighboring countries that are united by a joint fate should be 
done away with.

<F P=106> [Article by French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and </F>
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl: "Preparing for Peace"] 
  [Text] Starting on 1 July this year, Germany and France 
will in succession take on the presidency of the European Union 
[EU]. They are conscious of their common responsibility within 
the EU, in particular in this period of profound changes 
throughout the continent. They intend to closely coordinate 
their action during their presidencies. 
  Following the radical upheavals which have taken place in 
Europe since 1989, the EU has a historic obligation and a common 
objective to help the states of Central and East Europe regain 
their place in the European family and to involve them in the 
process of unification which is under way. In this way, we wish 
to guarantee lasting peace and freedom in Europe. 
  At the Copenhagen summit in July 1993, the Twelve began a 
long-term process of expanding eastward, by offering a concrete 
opportunity of membership to countries which are now linked to 
the EU via association or free trade agreements. 
  To this end, these countries must fulfil a series of 
economic 
and political conditions. The EU is supporting this process in 
a very diversified fashion, ranging from commercial facilities 
to close political dialogue, and including very substantial 
technical and financial assistance. We need to be very 
conscious of the fact that these countries' path toward the EU 
will be long and difficult. It is all the more important to 
affirm to them already that they are welcome within the EU. 
This is why we are jointly suggesting that the heads of state 
and government of the countries which are seeking membership be 
invited once a year to a European Council, in order to discuss 
questions of mutual interest with the Twelve, and soon the 
Sixteen, and in this way deepen our cooperation. 
  With the same end in mind, at the proposal of Germany and 
France, the Western European Union has agreed on a status of 
associated partnership for those countries, in order to foster 
rapprochement in the area of security policy. 
  In this way we are creating ever more numerous and closer 
links between the EU and the other members of the European 
family, which have, for so long, been kept outside the process 
of unification. The Yugoslavian conflict has clearly 
demonstrated that the peace and security of our continent are 
far from being secured. The exacerbation of historical ethnic, 
religious, and cultural tensions has resulted in an atrocious 
war, expulsions, the growth of fanaticism, and the changing of 
frontiers by force. It is our duty as Europeans to do 
everything to reestablish peace in this region as soon as 
possible and to avert, once and for all, every possibility of a 
return to barbarism in Europe. 
<H5>  With the United States and Russia </H5>
  In other regions of our continent, there exist latent 
tensions resulting mainly from unresolved border and minority 
problems. We cannot ensure stability and peace in Europe if we 
do not succeed in eliminating the causes of tension and, in this 
way, forestall conflicts in an effective and lasting fashion. 
In this respect the EU assumes a particular responsibility. 
This is why, last December, the European Council in Brussels 
approved the proposal by the French prime minister to organize a 
Conference on Stability in Europe, an initiative which was 
supported by President Francois Mitterrand at the June 1993 
Council of Copenhagen. 
  This initiative is based on the observation that political 
stability is an essential precondition for ensuring economic and 
social progress as well as peace and freedom. What value would 
the free trade and association agreements with Central and East 
European countries, or indeed, their future membership of the 
EU, have, if serious political crises, provoked in particular by 
problems of boundaries or minorities, were to call this progress 
into question? 
  The initiative of the Twelve in favor of a Stability Pact is 
aimed at encouraging the signing of good neighborliness 
agreements between all Central and East European countries. Of 
course, these agreements will not settle, once and for all, all 
the problems which may continue to exist between these 
countries, but they should create a climate of trust and 
introduce means of cooperation which make it possible to resolve 
any difficulties which may arise by mutual agreement. This 
principle has been the key to reconciliation and the process of 
unification of West Europe since World War II. The relationship 
which today unites France and Germany, long considered as 
hereditary enemies, is the most striking proof of this. 
  The initiative of the Twelve does not seek to create an 
additional institution or the draw up a new version of the 
fundamental principles which we have agreed on within the 
framework of the United Nations, the CSCE, or the Council of 
Europe, whether these principles be the inviolability of 
borders, the territorial integrity of states, or the respect of 
minority rights. 
  Today, the essential priority is to have these principles 
applied without restriction in order to effectively forestall 
tensions and crises in Europe. With this initiative, the Twelve 
are proposing to their Central and East European partners a 
European framework for negotiating good neighborliness 
agreements in a climate of trust. They are able to encourag this 
movement thanks to the EU's economic and political weight. 
<H5>  Political Will of the Countries </H5>
  The Twelve have no intention to prescribe or impose 
ready-made solutions on their partners. The success of this 
project will depend on the political will of the countries 
concerned. Nobody can or wants to relieve them of this 
responsibility. They alone are in a position to find, while 
retaining entire sovereignty, the solution which best suits them 
and which at the same times serves European stability. 
  In our eyes, the participation of the United States and 
Russia is fundamental to the success of this conference. A 
close and tested partnership, such as the presence of the United 
States, is and remains essential to the security of Europe 
[sentence as published]. We are equally conscious that there 
can be no stability and effective security in Europe without 
cooperation with Russia. For this reason we wish to build a 
close partnership with this country, which is a large and 
powerful neighbor of the EU. 
  The full participation of the CSCE is equally essential to 
the success of the Conference on Stability. The conference is 
fundamentally based on the principles of this institution, and 
its instruments must be used in full to put the agreements 
reached at conference into effect. In this way the results of 
this initiative will be an integral part of the CSCE process and 
will give it a strong impetus. 
  Germany and France are resolved, with their EU partners, to 
bring to fruition this first initiative undertaken within the 
framework of the joint foreign and security policy. They will 
do everything to contribute in this way to stability, peace, and 
freedom. 
  Our objective is to call, in a year from now, a conference 
at 
which the Stability Pact will be concluded, following a process 
of establishing a network of bilateral good neighborliness 
agreements between the countries of Central and East Europe. 
This Stability Pact will provide an occasion for Europe to 
prove its determination to overcome, for good, the ancient 
division of our continent, and to ensure the peoples of Europe a 
peaceful future.

  [Text] The Conference on Stability in Europe in Paris is 
coming to an end today. In an interview with our reporter, Edo 
Zitnik, Slovene Foreign Minister Lojze Peterle assessed the 
Slovene participation at this conference as follows: 
  [Begin recording] [Peterle] First of all, I would like to 
express my satisfaction with the fact that Slovenia managed to 
win full-fledged status at this conference. I am happy that 
this conference developed in the direction of preventive 
diplomacy. 
  [Zitnik] Will Slovenia be mentioned in the group of nine 
Central European states that are the potential candidates for 
future membership in the European Union in the conference 
document issued this afternoon? 
  [Peterle] Slovenia will not be specifically mentioned in 
this group of states bearing in mind that this group primarily 
consists of the states that must resolve their minority issues 
or neighboring relations, which Slovenia does not have to do. 
This conference is not the institution at which it would be 
decided whether Slovenia will progress closer to the European 
Union or not. 
  [Zitnik] One should nevertheless point out here that, for 
example, Poland and Czechia, which do not have minority 
problems, are also mentioned in this group? 
  [Peterle] This is true. However, I do not see any danger 
for Slovenia drawing closer to the European Union in this fact. 
  [Zitnik] Did Slovenia nevertheless tried to be included in 
this group of states before the conference? 
  [Peterle] Slovenia proposed that it be mentioned, but later 
did not insist on it when it was given assurances that this 
mention does not have any special political connotations. [end

  [Text] Paris, May 27 (AFP) -- Foreign Minister Alain Juppe 
on Friday [27 May] said the coming weeks would be "decisive" and 
that France would totally revamp its policy on Bosnia by July if 
peace talks made no progress. 
  "Before the summer, the month of July, we must know if we 
are 
moving ahead or marking time. If everyone continues to refuse 
every diplomatic breakthrough, particularly a ceasfire, we must 
go ahead with a thorough review of our policy," Juppe said on 
French radio. 
  France has threatened to pull out all its 6,800 UN troops in 
former Yugoslavia, where they form the backbone of the UN 
Protection Force there. 
  British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, after a meeting here 
Thursday with Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, also said Britian 
had no desire to maintain its troops indefinitely in Bosnia. 
  Juppe said the "consequences must be weighed." 
  "While we will not be able to say that we did not foresee 
the 
threats of a military escalation and a spread of the conflict, 
we cannot indefinitely stay where we are for several years." 
  He said the deadlock in Bosnia must be broken in the 
framework of what is being proposed by an international contact 
group on Bosnia: "a ceasefire, an institutional and territorial 
arrangement within the state of Bosnia-Herzegovina and a 
reconstruction process." 
  France hosted two-days of talks between the Contact Group -- 
the European Union, Russia and the United States -- and the 
three warring sides Wednesday and Thursday in the Alpine 
hideaway of Talloires, not far from Geneva. 
  The session reached no apparent agreement, but another round 
was scheduled in the French resort town on June 6 and 7. 
  The contact group negotiators tried in vain to get the 
factions to agree to a four-month ceasefire and to accept a 
European plan for partition that would give 51 percent of 
territory to the Croat-Moslem federation and 49 percent to the 
Serbs.

<F P=106> [Article by Henrik Wilen: "Nordic Security"] </F>
  [Text] The Nordic security policy balance, which was a 
well-worn cliche in the days of the Cold War, is only a memory, 
and today there is great irresolution in Oslo, Stockholm, and 
Helsinki. 
  In NORDISK KONTAKT's special issue on security Anders Ferm, 
the editor in chief of the Malmo newspaper ARBETET, states that 
a fog hangs over the development of security policy in Europe, 
and that it will not be dispelled for several years to come. 
  It is no enviable task for Nordic politicians and military 
people to try to navigate in this fog. It is true that 
initiatives and pointers are presented at regular intervals, 
primarily by debaters who cannot directly influence policy 
content, but in the absence of clear landmarks the contributions 
to the debate often increase the confusion. 
  The people who are responsible for setting policy lines are 
lying low and contenting themselves with noting that as long as 
Norway, Sweden, and Finland stand in the European Union (EU) 
anteroom the best thing to do is wait and see. And if some of 
them venture to discuss security policy in the EU after the 
Nordic trio -- or part of it -- joins Denmark in the EU, they 
generally make a brief reference to the EU conference in 1996. 
<H5>  Security Policy Cooperation? </H5>
  As Finland is no longer bound by the VSB [Friendship, 
Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance] Pact but, like Sweden and 
Norway, has applied for EU membership, proposals on Nordic 
security policy and even military cooperation in the future are 
presented from time to time. For example, General Bengt 
Gustafsson, commander in chief of the Swedish Armed Forces, has 
called several times for increased Nordic defense cooperation. 
Gustafsson's proposals have not met with much sympathy. 
  The way things look today, concrete cooperation is 
improbable, and even if all three Nordic candidates become EU 
members, it is highly unlikely that Finland and Sweden will 
become NATO members in the near future. And the basic 
constellation will remain, as pointedly expressed by minister 
Max Jakobson, among others: Norway has NATO, Sweden has Finland, 
and Finland has a mutual border with Russia that is 1,000 
kilometers long. 
  But everything is fluid and a lot can happen in a few years. 
After the eventful fall of 1989 the opinions of all foreign and 
security policy experts have become suspect, and one analysis is 
as good as another. In any case foreign and security policy in 
the Nordic countries has undergone a quite revolutionary change 
in recent years, and now that the prime ministers have seized 
the initiative one cannot rule out the possibility that 
cooperation will cover new areas in the future. 
<H5>  Russia a Question Mark </H5>
  The big question mark in the Nordic security policy debate 
is 
Russia. The old threat scenarios are no longer relevant, of 
course -- not many people include a Russian invasion of any of 
the Nordic countries in their calculations -- but the chaotic 
situation in Russia could lead to crises, for example in the 
Baltic states, that would immediately be reflected in the 
situation in the Nordic region. 
  When Finland decided to apply for EU membership two years 
ago 
the main justifications were trade policy and economic reasons. 
Little was said about security policy, but today it is openly 
stressed that membership also has an important security policy 
dimension. And we may assume that as we approach the popular 
referendum this fall security arguments will be discussed almost 
as frequently as the future of agriculture. 
<H5>  Nonalignment Without Guarantees </H5>
  For EU membership will inevitably also lead to security 
policy ties. Pekka Visuri, a researcher at the Foreign Policy 
Institute, points out in the same issue of NORDISK KONTAKT 
mentioned above that it is questionable whether there will be 
any possibility of staying out of military policy cooperation 
within the framework of the economic and political dimension. He 
points out that the definition of "freedom from military 
alliances and an independent national defense system" used by 
Finland and Sweden will not seem particularly credible to the 
rest of the world unless it is combined with guarantees that the 
EU countries will continue to sanction this position in the 
future. 
  The debate on future Nordic security policy solutions should 
get under way in earnest. When it comes to Finland there is a 
risk that we will reach a decision in the accustomed manner, 
with no discussion worth mentioning, and explain afterward that 
what happened was for the best.
