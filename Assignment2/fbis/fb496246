<H5>  Practical Application of Multi-Color Images By Utilizing </H5>
Double Refraction 
  New reflective-type color liquid crystal panels have been 
developed by utilizing the double refractivity of liquid 
crystals and phase-contrast plates. (The anisotropy of the 
refraction index is known as double refractivity. For example, 
when the refraction index in direction of the apse line of 
liquid crystal molecules is large, the refraction index 
perpendicular to that axis is small. The double refraction index 
is the difference between both refraction indices.) These panels 
will be manufactured in the spring of 1994. A bright image can 
be obtained with the reflective type even on portions without a 
color filter. The panels are broadly divided into two types, the 
TN (twisted nematic) liquid crystal type and the STN (super 
twisted nematic) liquid crystal type. The colors in the TN 
liquid crystal type are fixed, as either background or image 
colors. In the STN liquid crystal type, the red, green, blue and 
gray within one dot can be arbitrarily changed. At the present 
time a 1/160 duty matrix image is possible. 
  More than 20 years have passed since liquid crystal panels, 
which are thin, lightweight, and energy efficient, have been put 
to practical use. Now, these panels are building a solid 
position as key devices for electronic products. The field of 
applications is beginning to spread in a number of directions, 
and the capabilities required of liquid crystal panels is varied 
as well. However, the color liquid crystal panels currently in 
use, which have internal backlighting, are not always energy 
efficient. Demands for reduced power consumption are increasing, 
especially in the fields of OA (office automation), AV 
(audio-visual), and communications; if this demand can be met, 
market share would increase dramatically. The plans for the 
reflective-type color liquid crystal panels that were recently 
developed lead us to believe that this is the most likely 
technology to meet that demand. 
<H5>  Utilizing Double Refraction of Both Liquid Crystal and </H5>
Phase-Contrast Plate 
  Double refractivity of both liquid crystal molecules and 
phase-contrast plates are utilized for colorizing. 
Phase-contrast plates, which until now were used with "color 
off" for optical coloration, are instead used with "color on." 
  The coloration methods for liquid crystal panels can be 
broadly divided into methods utilizing spectral properties and 
methods utilizing double refractivity (Figure 1). 
&lt;graphic&gt; 
&lt;capt&gt; Figure 1. Liquid Crystal Panel Coloration Methods. Now, 
the double refractivity of liquid crystals and phase-contrast 
plates are utilized. Color filters are a general method, but 
because the transmissivity of light is reduced 40 percent, it 
must be a transmitting method that uses a backlight.&lt;/graphic&gt; 

  Methods utilizing spectral properties use color filters, 
color polarizing plates, and guest-host type liquid crystals. 
The general color filter method most often used at the present 
time is a transmission method with an internal backlight. 
However, the transmissivity of the color filter is reduced 40 
percent, and the image darkens by half because the light path is 
doubled by the reflection method. Ways that ensure brightness 
even with the reflection method are color polarizing plates in 
which the polarizing plates are colored, and guest-host liquid 
crystals, but then the image colors must be fixed as a single 
color when plans are drawn up. 
  Methods utilizing double refractivity include using the 
double refractivity of only the liquid crystals, and using the 
double refractivity of both liquid crystals and phase-contrast 
plates at the same time. It is possible to colorize only by 
using the double refractivity of the liquid 
crystals,[.sup]1[/] but the image hue relies heavily on 
temperature and cell thickness. (Colors can be divided into 
three attributes; the color divisions red, green and blue are 
known as hue. In addition, color brightness (y value) 
is known as the color value, while vividness is known as chroma. 
Furthermore, color is expressed in terms of hue and chroma as 
two-dimensional coordinates.) If used together with the double 
refraction index of phase-contrast plates, this reliance is cut 
by half. From now on this combined method will be employed. 
<H5>  Changing Colors With the Phase Value of Phase-Contrast Plates </H5>
  The phenomenon of colorizing by using the double 
refractivity 
of light can be explained by polarization of light and light's 
phase difference.[.sup]2[/] Light is polarized in a straight 
line when it passes through a polarizing plate, and as the 
double refraction index increases perpendicular to the polarized 
axis due to the double refraction effect in the phase-contrast 
plate, it is polarized in an ellipse. The double refraction 
effect is greatest when the delayed phase axis of the 
phase-contrast plate is inclined 45Î toward the direction of 
polarization (Figure 2). (Footnote 3. Phase-contrast plates and 
liquid crystals have similar anisotropy of the refraction 
indices. When the refraction index of phase contrast plates 
during processing is large in the direction of elongation, the 
surface refraction index perpendicular to that direction is 
small. The axis in the direction where the refraction index is 
large is known as the delayed phase axis.) 
&lt;graphic&gt;
&lt;capt&gt; Figure 2. Two Ways to Consider the Relationship Between 
the Phase-Contrast Plate and the Polarizing Plate. In ordinary 
TN liquid crystals, "on" approximates a parallel configuration 
(a) on the polarizing plate, and "off" approximates a 
perpendicular configuration.&lt;/graphic&gt; 

  In response to the phase differences of the phase-contrast 
plate, the degree of polarization differs depending on the 
wavelength of the light, and the polarized light that 
constitutes the transmission axis emerges as a result. Colors 
can be selected; for example, blue when the phase difference 
nears 650 nm, and orange when it nears 880 nm (Figure 3). 
&lt;graphic&gt; 
&lt;capt&gt; Figure 3. Phase Differences and Light Intensity Depending 
On Differences in Wavelength. Each color can be selected by 
changing the phase difference of the phase-contrast plate. In 
response to the phase differences of the phase-contrast plate, 
the degree of polarization differs depending on the wavelength 
of the light, and as a result, the polarized light that 
constitutes the transmission axis emerges.&lt;/graphic&gt; 

  The light intensity I[.sub]par[/] that returns 
to its origin when two polarizing plates are parallel is 
proportional to the square of the value of the elliptic 
polarized light amplitude projected on the transmission axis. 
[`par' is parallel; `per' is perpendicular] 
  I[.sub]par[/] = 
1/2*I[.sub]0[/]*cos[.sup]2[/](„R[.sub]e[/]/_l_) 
(1) 
  Here, I[.sub]0[/] is the intensity of the 
incident light, R[.sub]e[/] is the phase 
difference of the phase-contrast plate, and _l_ is the light 
wavelength. 
  In contrast, the phase of I[.sub]per[/] in 
which the two polarizing plates are perpendicular, shifts 
90Î relative to I[.sub]par[/]. 
  /m/m/mI[.sub]per[/] = 
1/2*I[.sub]0[/]*sin[.sup]2[/](„R[.sub]e[/]/_l_) 
(2) 
  From these equations, I[.sub]0[/][.sup]2[/] 
= 
I[.sub]per[/][.sup]2[/]+I[.sub]par[/][.sup]2[/] 
can be derived, and because I[.sub]0[/] is 
specified as the white light intensity, the colors expressed by 
I[.sub]par[/] and I[.sub]per[/] are 
complementary. For example, when "on" and "off" have this kind 
of complementary color relationship when colorized using liquid 
crystals, the color combinations are immutably determined. 
  Liquid crystal panels are now colorized by utilizing the 
double refractivity of liquid crystals and phase-contrast plates 
together. The transmission axis of two polarizing plates are set 
parallel, and the delayed phase axis of the phase-contrast plate 
is configured to be at a 45Î angle to the transmission axis 
of the polarizing plates[.sup]3[/] (Figure 4). 
&lt;graphic&gt; 
&lt;capt&gt; Figure 4. Configuration of the Recently Developed 
Reflecting-Type TN Color Panel. Various colors can be shown by 
changing factors such as liquid crystal cell thickness and 
liquid crystal double refraction.&lt;/graphic&gt; 

  In this case, light intensity I is the value that 
optically combines the effects due to the double refraction 
index of both the liquid crystals and the phase-contrast plate. 
  I = 
1/2I[.sub]0[/][1/(1+u[.sup]2[/])*sin[.sup]2[/] 
(„(1+u[.sup]2[/])[.sup]0.5[/]/2)/ 
*(cos(„R[.sub]e[/]/2_l_) + 
u*sin(„R[.sub]e[/]/2_l_}[.sup]2[/] 
+cos[.sup]2[/](„(1=u[.sup]2[/])[.sup]0.5[/]/2 
*sin[.sup]2[/](„R[.sub]e[/]/2_l_] 
(3) 
  Here, u = 2_D_n*d/_l_, with 
_D_n representing the double refractivity of the 
liquid crystal and d representing the liquid crystal 
cell thickness. 
  The usual TN liquid crystal mode is a specific solution to 
the above equation. That is, rotary polarization in which the 
incident light is twisted 90Î occurs under conditions in 
which u = 0 when on or u = 
3[.sup]0.5[/] or 15[.sup]0.5[/] when off. As a result, 
contrast and brightness with a black-and-white image are best 
with one phase-contrast plate. With these conditions, a mutually 
complementary color relationship comes about when the voltage 
given to the liquid crystal is on and off. Therefore, even when 
color is added using the phase-contrast plates, the background 
color and display color are determined and unchangeable. 
  More color schemes are possible by selecting cell thickness 
and double refractivity of the liquid crystal materials and 
changing u. If u is moved by using a 
particular phase-contrast plate, a locus is drawn while the 
chromaticity of the color displayed changes as a result of 
double refraction. If we let two points on the locus be the 
liquid crystal's on and off conditions, then it is possible to 
arbitrarily select background and display colors. 
  Furthermore, there is only one phase-contrast plate now 
being 
used, but it is larger than two plates with different phase 
values; by staggering the delayed phase axes, the number of 
color schemes increases and a brighter display can be obtained. 
This is because a solution is obtained that brings the polarized 
light axis for each color nearer to the transmission axis as the 
change in double refraction becomes larger. 
  This tendency increases as the phase-contrast plates 
increase 
in number, but because this is balanced by a reduction in 
transmissivity, two or three plates are appropriate. Therefore 
the value of y becomes four to six, which is 
considered sufficient for practical use. Ultimately, the goal is 
to realize 10 ordinary STN monochrome liquid crystals; a 
breakthrough is needed. 
<H5>  Controlling Voltage of Color Using STN Liquid Crystals </H5>
  A wide range of colors can be displayed by substituting STN 
liquid crystals, which have large double refraction effects. 
Therefore, differences in color can be controlled by means of 
the voltage value applied to the liquid crystals. The 
arrangement of the liquid crystal molecules changes depending on 
the voltage value, and the light intensity distribution for the 
colors differs depending on the differences of the respective 
indices of double refraction (Figures 5 and 6). 
&lt;graphic&gt; 
&lt;capt&gt; Figure 5. Changes in Liquid Crystal Molecular Motion and 
Polarized Light Conditions Depending on Size of Voltage of 
Reflecting-Type STN Color Liquid Crystal Panels. Voltage 
increases towards the right. The arrangement of liquid crystal 
molecules increases as the value of the voltage increases (a). 
Consequently, the double refraction effect decreases, and the 
intensity of light differs depending on wavelength. Light 
intensity is proportional to the square of the length of the 
polarized light ellipse projected on the transmission 
axis.&lt;/graphic&gt; 

&lt;graphic&gt; 
&lt;capt&gt; Figure 6. Voltage Magnitude and Intensity for the 
Reflecting-Type STN Color Liquid Crystal Panel. Light intensity 
of each color differs depending on the magnitude of the voltage 
applied to the liquid crystals. When voltage is lowered, the 
order is blue, green and red.&lt;/graphic&gt; 

  In other words, changes in gradation with ordinary STN 
monochrome liquid crystals are manifested as color changes. 
Consequently, a multicolor display comes about because each 
respective color cannot be further divided into gradations and 
displayed. 
  Blue, green, and red can be displayed with the liquid 
crystal 
panels. These correspond to 0 grade, 3 grade, and 7 grade 
respectively with ordinary monochrome liquid crystals (Figure 7). 
&lt;graphic&gt; 
&lt;capt&gt; Figure 7. Color Display Characteristics of the 
Reflecting-Type STN Color Liquid Crystal Panel. By using pulse 
width modulation, ordinary differences in gradation become 
different colors. Blue corresponds to 0 grade, green to 3 grade, 
and red to 7 grade. The value of y which indicates 
brightness ranges from 2.1 to 3.5.&lt;/graphic&gt; 

  The magnitude of the voltage is changed by means of a 
multiplexing drive using a pulse width modulation formula. The 
value of y which indicates brightness ranges from 2 
to 3. 
  In principle, the power consumed is identical to that of the 
STN monochrome liquid crystal currently in use, and the cost is 
also the same. In addition, an active matrix drive that combines 
TFT (thin-film transistor) elements for high speed is 
theoretically possible, and development is currently underway. 
To complete the product line, preparations are being made for 
six types of reflective-type color panels in spring 1994, up to 
1/160 duty dot matrix displays (Table 1). Issues related to 
higher duties exceeding 1/160 include improving the angle of 
twist, and reducing _D_ _e_/_e_[.sub]per[/] and 
K[.sub]33[/]/K[.sub]11[/] for the liquid crystals. 
  And recently, liquid crystal panels using thin, lightweight 
plastic substrates are attracting attention. If the functions of 
the phase-contrast plates can be maintained with these 
materials, reflecting-type plastic color liquid crystal panels 
could be a reality.

<H5>  Production Equipment Competes on the Basis of COO at Semicon </H5>
Japan 
  Equipment for 16M DRAM production lines in 1994, with 
increased productivity by factors from 1.3 to 2, and 
experimental equipment to evaluate the future productivity of 
the 64M line, with increased productivity by factors from 1.5 to 
2, have appeared repeatedly. The productivity of this equipment 
has begun to be evaluated by using the COO index, which 
quantifies the economics of production lines and production 
equipment. This trend was clear at "Semicon Japan 93," where 
there were seminars on the topic of COO. The equipment that 
appeared this year for improving the 16M line does not provide 
size reduction, so their prices are unchanged. Throughput is 
being improved by shortening the conveyor time, and availability 
is being improved by reducing the number of parts. On the other 
hand, steppers for the 64M line are improving throughput while 
providing 2-to-1 size reduction. 
  Various kinds of equipment for making semiconductors have 
appeared with performance improvements by factors from 1.3 to 2 
in throughput, availability, and cost (Figures 1 and 2). 
  The 16M DRAMs have started to receive real funding in 1994. 
Attempts to improve the productivity of 0.5 Êm, 8-inch 16M 
DRAM equipment have paid off with productivity improvements by 
factors from 1.3 to 2 over the previous equipment of the same 
manufacturers. At the same time, prototype equipment to evaluate 
the productivity of 64M DRAMs, which will begin mass production 
in 1996, have made improvements by factors from 1.5 to 2. 
  Manufacturers are using the COO model to evaluate the 
economics of production lines and production equipment, 
competing on the basis of this index. (The concept of COO, which 
stands for "cost of operation," quantifies the economics of 
capital expenditures and operation of equipment. The COO model 
uses various coefficients to calculate the contributions of the 
equipment's cost, productivity, reliability, and yield over the 
mechanical life of the equipment. It can also evaluate the 
economics of an entire production line. The COO value is 
expressed as the cost in dollars per wafer.) This trend was 
clearly apparent at "Semicon Japan 93," which was held on 
December 1-3. 
&lt;graphic&gt; 
&lt;capt&gt; Figure 1. Appearance of 0.5 Êm, 8-Inch 
Production Equipment With 1.3 to 2 Times Better Efficiency. For 
4M, the COO value decreased about 20 percent every year. For a 
DRAM of the same capacity in the 16M case, a decrease of 30 
percent per year is expected. In accordance with this, equipment 
that increases productivity by 25-50 percent appears 
repeatedly.&lt;/graphic&gt; 

&lt;graphic&gt;

Equipment. The CEO value has gone down 25-50 percent for every 
type of equipment.&lt;/graphic&gt; 

<H5>  Quantification Using the Simpler CEO Index for Equipment </H5>
Manufacturers 
  This trend is the result of the great demands for lower cost 
being made on LSI manufacturers, a trend which began growing 
around 1990. 
  The cry for lower costs has been getting louder in Japan 
since around 1990. At the start of 1993, slogans such as "200 
Percent Production Efficiency" (Toshiba) and "Triple Efficiency" 
(Fujitsu) were prominent in newspapers. LSI manufacturers have 
been demonstrating how much effort they are putting into 
lowering costs, not just in their production departments but 
also in design and development. 
  So far, however, this index has only been used for entire 
production lines, and each of the individual types of equipment 
has only had a "qualitative goal" (Toshiba Semiconductor 
Production Engineering Promotion Center). It seems that Japanese 
LSI manufacturers will soon be decreasing their domestic 
purchases and "America will take the lead," not just in 
equipment technology but even in production technology, says a 
process engineer working for a manufacturer doing joint 
Japanese-American DRAM development. 
  The high productivity of Korean manufacturers has also been 
recognized, and there is now a strong danger that "Japanese LSI 
manufacturers will lose the cost war" (NEC memory department). 
It seems that Japan may fall into third place behind America and 
Korea. 
  In America, on the other hand, quantification of 
productivity 
is moving forward, centered around SEMATECH. (SEMATECH is an 
American semiconductor research organization that is a joint 
project of the public and private sectors. They have two 
programs to improve and develop equipment. The aim is to secure 
world leadership in the area of production.) The model for 
quantifying the economics of production lines and production 
equipment is COO, based on an economic evaluation model 
developed by the American company Intel. They also use a 
simplified model called CEO (Cost of Equipment Ownership), which 
concentrates on evaluating just one piece of equipment by 
omitting the yield factor. (The CEO model simplifies the COO 
model in order to evaluate just one type of equipment. In 
particular, the CEO model omits the yield factor that is not 
possible to evaluate for a single piece of equipment.) 
  Such evaluation methods have existed in the past, but only 
in 
a simple form capable of discussing the economics of investing 
in entire production lines. Such methods could not 
quantitatively evaluate the economics of individual processes 
because, unlike COO and its simplified variant CEO, they did not 
take into account the throughput and availability of each 
process and each piece of equipment, nor did they consider labor 
costs or equipment floor space. 
  At the present time, SEMI (Semiconductor Equipment and 
Materials International) is the most important world body 
concerned with equipment and raw materials, and they are making 
the COO and CEO models into standards. 
<H5>  The Three Worst Types of Equipment Are Etchers, Sputters, </H5>
and CVD 
  With the current strong push to lower costs, Japanese LSI 
manufacturers are accepting COO as a new standard of 
productivity. While simplifying their processes, they are also 
looking to equipment manufacturers to improve productivity. 
  Up through 4M, most LSI manufacturers were decreasing the 
COO 
index about 20 percent per year, for DRAMs of the same capacity. 
However, the goal has become 30 percent for 16M. Also, starting 
with 64M, the aim is to use size reduction to offset the usual 
increase in COO in going to a new generation, bringing it down 
from 50 percent to 20 percent. In reducing costs, "60 percent of 
the reduction should come from equipment improvements, working 
together with the equipment manufacturers" (Fujitsu process 
general manager). 
  This magazine conducted a survey of the Japanese LSI 
manufacturers that have performed quantitative evaluations of 
present 0.5 Êm, 8-inch production line equipment, namely, 
NEC, 
Toshiba, Mitsubishi Electric, and Fujitsu. The results make it 
clear that "the three worst types of equipment are etchers, 
sputters, and CVD [chemical vapor deposition]" (Table 1). On a 
scale from 1 to 10, these three types of equipment came in 
between 3 and 4. 
  The reason for these results is low availability. The LSI 
manufacturers all evaluate it to be below 60 percent. That means 
that these types of equipment are only working two days out of 
three. There are even examples where one day is spent wet 
washing the chamber for every hundred hours of operation. It 
would be difficult to dramatically improve the availability 
alone, so equipment manufacturers are looking for ways to 
improve the combined availability and throughput.

<H5>  [Boxed item, p 91] The 0.5 Êm 8-Inch Line Will </H5>
Produce 10,000 Wafers Per Month for Japanese LSI Manufacturers 
  For one Japanese LSI manufacturer after another, beginning 
in 
the second half of 1994 and going into 1995, the 0.5 Êm 
8-inch 
line availability will be 10,000 wafers per month (Figure A). Up 
until now the capabilities had only been several thousands of 
wafers per month. 
  At present, orders from Japanese manufacturers to equipment 
manufacturers are increasing. With regard to steppers, which 
sell more than any other type of equipment, "orders dropped by 
half during 1993, but will return to the 1992 levels in 1994" 
(Canon, Nikon). 
  Among Japanese manufacturers, Toshiba will be first in 
expanding its Yokkaichi 8-inch line to 10,000 wafers per month. 
The equipment will be installed in the second quarter of 1994, 
with the plan to achieve 10,000 wafers per month in the third 
quarter. At full production the wafer processing capability will 
be 20,000 wafers per month, although they have only decided so 
far to install three-fourths of the equipment. 
  Next will be Mitsubishi Electric and Hitachi Seisakusho. 
Mitsubishi will install equipment in their Nishijo factory in 
the third quarter, and put it into operation in the fourth 
quarter. Hitachi will install equipment in its Naka factory 
starting in early 1994, which will be capable of 20,000 wafers 
per month at full production. However, the line will only be put 
into operation in stages, so 10,000 wafers per month capability 
will not be realized until as late as the first quarter of 1995. 
NEC should also be capable of 10,000 wafers per month by the 
beginning of 1995. However, Mitsubishi Electronics of Korea will 
soon be capable of 20,000 wafers per month, so they are far 
ahead of Japan.

<H5>  The CEO Value as the Basis for Selecting Equipment </H5>
  Equipment manufacturers have responded to the strong demand 
for cost reductions from LSI manufacturers by using the CEO 
index to quantify their equipment, dividing the cost by 
throughput and availability. This trend was visible at Semicon 
Japan (Figures 3 through 6). 
  The use of the CEO index aims at the American LSI 
manufacturer market, which is moving toward CEO as a basis for 
selecting equipment for purchase. At the same time, this also 
should set up a common ground for competition in Japan, where 
evaluation standards have been less rigorous. In fact, it has 
even been said that Intel has not made purchases because the CEO 
value was not provided. 
  The equipment with higher productivity to be introduced 
starting at the end of 1993 and into 1994 falls mainly into two 
types. The first type is equipment to improve productivity by a 
factor from 1.3 to 2 for 16M, which will receive real funding in 
1994. In other words, the CEO value will decrease 25 to 50 
percent compared to earlier equipment. The second type is 
experimental equipment preceding the completion of 64M 
production equipment. Here the productivity will increase by a 
factor from 1.5 to 2, meaning that the CEO value will decrease 
30 to 50 percent. 
  In the 16M case, size reduction is not being provided, so 
the 
equipment price will be stable. This equipment improves 
throughput and availability. For example, the wafer conveyor 
time, which constitutes more than half of tact time, will be cut 
in half in order to improve throughput by a factor of 1.3. And 
availability will be improved by decreasing the number of parts 
so that periodic maintenance will need to be performed less 
frequently. 
  In the 64M case, the hope is for a breakthrough that will 
improve productivity while providing size reduction. For 
example, steppers have appeared with 2-to-1 size reduction and 
double the throughput. Unlike the case of 5-to-1 steppers, a 
great improvement is expected just by loosening the design rules. 
<H5>  Etchers: Robot Wait Time Cut by a Factor of Three </H5>
  One of the "three worst" etchers have now appeared for 16M 
that reduce the CEO value by 30 percent, from &yen;520 per wafer 
for previous equipment to &yen;400 per wafer. (SEMATECH shows 
COO and CEO values as dollars per wafer, but here we have 
converted this to yen per wafer for Japanese manufacturers.) 
  Applied Materials (AMAT) of America is selling the "P-5000 
Mark II-J Etch MxP," which lowers the CEO value by keeping the 
price the same, improving availability 10 percent, and improving 
throughput 20 percent (Figure 3). The price is about &yen;200 
million, and sales began in Japan in October. 
  The improvement in availability was achieved by reducing the 
generated particles by an order of magnitude and doubling the 
interval between maintenance. The number of particles of size 
greater than 0.3 Êm was reduced to between 0.03 and 0.05 
particles per cc. This was achieved by means such as using an 
aluminum cutting chamber with attached rounds, using the most 
appropriate blow holes for the gas supply, and switching to a 
hot wall method. The improvement in availability also includes a 
12.5 percent improvement in MTBF [mean time between failures] 
(This is the average time from the occurrence of one failure to 
the occurrence of the next failure) over earlier equipment, and 
an improvement in MTTR [mean time to repair] by 22 percent. 
(This is the average time from the occurrence of a failure until 
it is repaired.) MTBF improved because the number of parts 
within the chamber decreased. 
  Throughput was increased by decreasing the convey time, 
which 
is more than half of the tact time. The conveyor speed was 
increased by a factor of three when not waiting for a wafer. In 
the future, robots will be used that can hold two wafers 
simultaneously, and the convey speed will be made even faster. 
&lt;graphic&gt; 
&lt;capt&gt; Figure 3. An Etcher With the CEO Value Reduced by 30 
Percent. The throughput was increased 20 percent and 
availability increased 10 percent while holding the price to the 
same level as earlier equipment. Applied Materials of 
America.&lt;/graphic&gt; 

<H5>  Sputters: Cutting the CEO Value in Half to &yen;300 Per Wafer </H5>
  Two companies, Nihon Denwa Anelba and Nihon Shinku 
Technologies, are introducing 16M sputters that cut the CEO 
value in half to &yen;300 per wafer. They reduce the gas exhaust 
time and convey time, respectively. 
  The "ILD-1060," introduced by Nihon Denwa Anelba in October, 
decreased the CEO value from the &yen;600 per wafer of previous 
machines to &yen;360 per wafer. The price of about &yen;160 
million is the same as previous machines, while the availability 
has been increased 10 percent and the throughput 50 percent. 
  The improvement in availability was achieved by reducing the 
hundreds of moving parts by about 50. 
  The improvement in throughput was achieved by shortening the 
vacuum exhaust time, which according to LSI manufacturers took 
up between 40 and 50 percent of the tact time. The exhaust time 
was cut in half by performing loading and unloading 
simultaneously. This was achieved by developing robots that 
could hold two wafers simultaneously. Previous robots were 
improved, rather than developing new ones. 
  The "Z-1000" sputter introduced by Nihon Shinku reduced the 
CEO value from &yen;660 to &yen;330 per wafer. While slightly 
reducing the price to &yen;170 million, the availability was 
improved 40 percent and the throughput was improved 50 percent. 
  The improvement in availability was achieved by cutting in 
half the number of parts, which had been 4500. Sites of particle 
generation were reduced, and the area of the nonstick board 
within the chamber was reduced by an order of magnitude. 
  The improvement in throughput was due to a 40 percent 
reduction in convey time. Nihon Shinku accomplished this by 
changing from the previous belt drive method to a frog leg 
method. 
&lt;graphic&gt; 
&lt;capt&gt; Figure 4. Productivity Is Higher for a Low Pressure Method 
Than For a Collimated One. Productivity cannot be maintained 
with a collimated method because as the number of processed 
wafers increases the speed of membrane formation degrades and 
particle generation increases markedly. Nihon Shinku.&lt;/graphic&gt; 

<H5>  CVD Equipment: Close Attention Paid To Improving Throughput </H5>
  The 16M CVD equipment has appeared with a CEO value of 
&yen;400 per wafer that is reduced to 60 percent of prior 
equipment. This is CVD that works at ordinary pressures with 
TEOS for the raw material gas. 
  Canon estimates that their CVD "ATP-5800" reduces the CEO 
value to &yen;400 per wafer. They found it difficult to improve 
availability, so they increased the throughput by 60 percent. 
The price of about &yen;200 million is the same as before. They 
investigated improvements in availability by in-situ cleaning, 
but gave up on that idea because they felt that the price 
increase of &yen;10 million was not worth the small improvement 
in the CEO. 
  Throughput went up 25 points by increasing the number of 
process chambers from four to five, and 30 points more by 
changing the convey method. The rectangular shape of prior 
equipment was changed to a polygonal form, without much increase 
in the area occupied by the equipment. The convey speed was 
increased while changing from linear motion to circular motion. 
<H5>  Vertical Furnaces: First, Realize an Increase in the Number </H5>
of Charges 
  Kokusai Electric has announced two new 16M vertical 
furnaces, 
one with sales beginning in January, 1994, and the other in the 
second quarter of 1994. These reduce the CEO value over previous 
equipment by 30 percent and 50 percent, respectively, for the 
case of field oxidation. Unfortunately, however, it is the 
policy of Kokusai Electric not to announce the absolute numbers 
for the CEO values. 
  The vertical furnace "V-IIIE," with a 30 percent lower CEO 
value, increases throughput by increasing the number of charges. 
They said that the availability was already so good that it 
could have little effect on improving the CEO value. 
  The vertical furnace "V-IIIF," with a 50 percent lower CEO 
value, decreases the tact time of the V-IIIE. Kokusai Electric 
plans to invest most heavily in this product for 16M. The V-IIIE 
is available for users who need an earlier delivery date. 
  Both the V-IIIE and V-IIIF increase the number of charges 
from 100 to 150. The convey time increases, but this convey time 
is still only 10 minutes as compared with the four hours 
required for the field oxidation process, so there really is 
little effect on the tact time. The larger number of charges is 
achieved by increasing the length of the heater from 1200mm to 
1350mm and the height of the equipment from 2800mm to 3100mm. 
  The V-IIIF plans to decrease the tact time by reducing the 
process time from 4 hours to only 1.5 or 2 hours. They plan to 
produce test equipment at the beginning of 1994. 
  Kokusai Electric states that increasing the number of 
charges 
is advantageous for field oxidation and the trench flushing 
process. Kokusai Electric is investigating the CEO value 
together with LSI manufacturers (Figure 5). They have also 
quantitatively found that there is little advantage for the case 
of processes that take less time, such as the capacitor 
insulating membrane formation process. For such processes, size 
reduction is the way to improve throughput. 
&lt;graphic&gt; 
&lt;capt&gt; Figure 5. Improving CEO by Increasing the Number of 
Charges. For example, in the case of a field oxidation membrane, 
increasing the number of charges to 150 reduces the CEO value by 
30 percent. Kokusai Electric.&lt;/graphic&gt; 

<H5>  Ion Implantation/Washing: The Road to Low Cost </H5>
  For 16M, ion implantation equipment and washing equipment 
have appeared with lower costs. 
  Nihon Shinku will market the "IDZ-8800" ion implantation 
equipment that cuts the CEO in half from &yen;500 per wafer to 
&yen;250 per wafer. They have given up the parallel method of 
vertically implanting ions in the wafer surface and returned to 
the previous scan method. They returned to the scan method to 
lower the cost, because half the cost of the equipment was in 
the parts needed for parallelization. The price is &yen;200 
million. 
  Nihon Shinku developed the new equipment after 
investigations, performed together with LSI manufacturers, had 
shown that the parallel equipment is only needed 10 to 20 
percent of the time. However, LSI factories usually have a 
tendency to purchase several of the same type of equipment so 
that an equipment failure does not stop the entire line. A 
question is whether this will continue to be the case even 
without the parallel equipment. 
  The throughput has increased to 280 wafers per hour. One 
wafer is already being conveyed while another one is being 
processed. In the future, the convey time should not be a factor 
at all, and it should be possible to have 360 wafers per hour. 
  Dainippon Screen Seizo will sell washing equipment where the 
CEO value has decreased from &yen;450 per wafer to &yen;400 per 
wafer, for prices ranging from several tens of millions of yen 
to &yen;300 million. Lower prices have been achieved by reducing 
the number of parts from 125 to 50. While throughput may double 
for other types of equipment, such as etchers or CVD, washing 
equipment still has throughput to spare, so there is no way to 
improve the CEO value except through lower costs. 
<H5>  Appearance of 64M, 2-to-1 Steppers </H5>
  Experimental steppers for 64M production give a 2-to-1 
reduction ratio. 
  Some LSI manufacturers had used 5-to-1 steppers together 
with 
magnifying exposers in 4M production lines. The 16M production 
lines that invested in bubble technology went exclusively to 
5-to-1 steppers. The appearance of 2-to-1 steppers now is for 
the purpose of reducing the cost of the exposure process. Of 
course, the CEO value is much lower for magnifying exposers than 
for steppers. Therefore, some LSI manufacturers are looking for 
steppers that can be used as magnifying exposers in processes 
that have flexible design rules, such as ion implantation 
processes or bonding pad opening. Throughput is increased by 
changing the ratio from 5-to-1 to 2-to-1, increasing the 
exposure surface area, and reducing the number of shots. 
  Preliminary calculations for the new 2-to-1 steppers from 
the 
two largest companies, Nikon and Canon, show reductions in CEO 
from &yen;500 per wafer to &yen;350 per wafer and from &yen;500 
per wafer to &yen;400 per wafer, respectively. The Nikon price 
is about &yen;300 million, and the Canon price is over &yen;300 
million. Both have an exposure surface area of 50mm on a side 
and an NA of 0.3. Both companies have doubled the throughput of 
earlier equipment. The light source is i-rays. 
<H5>  Proposals for Increasing Productivity Through Process </H5>
Shortening 
  There are also sputters and vertical furnaces that aim to 
increase productivity for the 64M generation. 
  Nihon Shinku has found that low pressure sputters are more 
effective at increasing productivity than collimated methods 
(Figure 4). Beginning with 64M, they are developing high vacuum 
equipment of 10[.sup]-9[/] Torr (one Torr is 133 Pa) for 
barrier metal membrane formation. A linear beam of sputter 
particles increases the distance between the target and the 
wafer, and the sputter particles reach to the bottom of the 
hole. It is not possible to maintain productivity with a 
collimated method because as the number of processed wafers 
increases the membrane formation speed degrades and the number 
of particles generated increases markedly. 
  Kokusai Electric is pursuing research into equipment for 
processes with short processing times, such as for capacitor 
insulator membranes. They take the point of view that thin style 
CVD will be advantageous for productivity and membrane formation 
characteristics. The equipment is in the experimental stage, 
with calculations suggesting that the CEO value can be decreased 
20 to 30 percent. Generated particles are kept under control by 
using a hot wall method, raising the temperature with a heater. 
If the temperature can be maintained at a constant value even 
during conveying, then membranes that may grow on the side walls 
will not peel, so particles will not form. 
  Equipment manufacturers are also reporting that they can 
reduce CEO values by shortening their processes. For example, in 
CVD processes that form layer insulator membranes, multiple 
processes such as SOG were used for imbedding in the past, but 
now a plasma CVD method with just a single cycle has appeared 
(Figure 6). 
&lt;graphic&gt; 
&lt;capt&gt; Figure 6. Layer Insulator Membrane Processes With 
One-Cycle Imbedding. Imbedding characteristics are improved by 
using plasma TEOS membrane formation reactions with fluorinated 
gas and etching reactions with fluorinated gas at the same time. 
Such announcements were made at the Fall 1993, 54th Applied 
Physics Research Conference (Mizuno, et. al., Fall 54th Applied 
Physics Research Conference; Paper Number 28 p-X-2; September, 
1993). This is one example of a process that LSI manufacturers 
hope to be able to shorten.&lt;/graphic&gt;

  [Text] On the afternoon of 25 October, PNC held a "Report 
and Lecture Conference." In his presentation on international 
relations, PNC Assistant Chairman of the Board Mitsuo Taguchi 
made the following statement: "Last year PNC underwent 17 
percent of the total amount of inspections worldwide by the 
IAEA, which added up to 1400 man-days." Needless to say, this is 
the kind of strict international scrutiny that results from 
Japan's plutonium utilization. The number of man-days works out 
to four inspectors from foreign countries conducting 
international inspections at PNC facilities every day of the 
year. In fact, the IAEA's "eyes of non-proliferation" are 
focused more sharply on Japan than anywhere else in the world. 
  In his introductory greeting, Chairman of the Board Takao 
Ishiwatari touched on the international situation, including 
increasing concern over the problem of excess plutonium 
resulting from the dismantling of nuclear weapons accompanying 
the end of the Cold War. He said, "The FBR, fuel recycling, and 
plutonium utilization put us on a radical path of atomic energy 
development and use. We must respond to concerns raised by the 
international community." He also revealed a plan to proceed 
with international cooperative research with the U.S. and France 
on mixing and burning minor actinide series transuranium 
elements (neptunium, americium, etc.) with plutonium. In a 
sense, as a response to foreign concern over Japan's use of 
plutonium, this research will lead to utilization of "nuclear 
proliferation resistant" enhanced plutonium that is blended so 
nuclear outlaws will leave it alone. Moreover, because this 
technology also burns up the minor actinides that are normally 
present in high level waste, it may kill two birds with one 
stone by easing the burden of high level waste disposal, which 
is the greatest problem the nuclear power industry must confront. 
  As a backdrop for all this, the U.S. Department of Energy's 
budget proposal in April authorized the burning of actinides in 
the experimental breeder reactor (EBR II), and funding for the 
IFR (Integral Fast Reactor), which had been eliminated, was 
restored by a House-Senate conference committee in Congress on 
14 October. 
  In the spring of 1977, President Carter essentially put a 
halt to breeder reactor development, and although both are 
Democrats and President Clinton's non-proliferation policy must 
cope with the problem of plutonium from dismantled weapons, 
after 16 years this is, in essence, welcome news. France, on the 
other hand, remains silent. In Japan, however, informed persons 
have been deeply distressed because the Atomic Energy Commission 
has been holding hearings to revise the Long Term Plan for one 
year and three months, but the long-awaited report on FBR 
commercialization, which includes plans for the first FBR 
demonstration reactor, is still not ready for submission because 
of "evasion tactics" by some in the electric power industry. 
<H5>  Fuel Facility Automated, Remote Control Plant </H5>
  Returning to the main topic, PNC also revealed issues to be 
addressed and future prospects for technical progress through 
the cooperative development of this advanced plutonium recycling 
technology by Japan, France, and the U.S. Yoshiro Takahashi 
(Assistant Director, Development Promotion Division, PNC) 
appealed that we should change our concept of plutonium 
recycling as merely technological development intended to clean 
up the leftovers of LWR power generation and stated, "The ratio 
of isotopes in which nuclear fission occurs (fissile quantity) 
drops off only slightly even when the number of recycling passes 
is increased." "We can utilize minor actinides, which are 
elements we have thrown away in the past, as a source of fuel 
and reduce the burden on the back end (disposal of high level 
waste)," and "We must look at this from the standpoint of a 
comprehensive technology from LWR to FBR to recycling." 
  From the standpoint of fuels, Shojio Kawada (Assistant 
Director, Reprocessing Technology Development Division, PNC) 
stated, "In reprocessing we must first develop technology for 
isolating and recovering transuranium elements, and because we 
will no longer need a purification process, the overall process 
will be shortened." 
  Because of the intense radioactivity, however, operation of 
the plant must be automated, and maintenance must be performed 
by remote control. Construction of this Recycling Equipment 
Testing Facility (RETF) will begin next spring.

  [Text] Development of technology for post-reprocessing 
nuclear fuel cycle safety assurance has become the focus of 
attention for completing the system of nuclear power generation. 
On the afternoon of 25 October, the Japan Atomic Energy Research 
Institute held its 21st Conference To Report Atomic Energy 
Safety Research Results, and the majority of the five reports 
and lectures were related to this issue. This implies a shift 
away from the past, which dealt mainly with reactors. Here I 
will introduce one bit of welcome news concerning the deep 
underground disposal of high level waste. 
  In the report entitled "Movement of Radioactive Nuclides 
Deep 
Underground," Muneaki Aneo (Lab Director, Environmental Safety 
Research Department) presented results of tests conducted at an 
underground research facility in Canada's Manitoba Province in 
1987. 
  Recently the amount of water in downtown Tokyo leaking from 
rusted (oxidized) water pipes has grown too great to be ignored, 
but the environment deep underground, which is nearly oxygen 
free, is quite different. The image held by most of the general 
populace is that high level waste buried deep underground will 
come back via our underground water supplies in the not too 
distant future. This is the idea behind the movement protesting 
the plan by PNC's Storage Engineering Center for a site at the 
town of Horonobe in Hokkaido. However, the environment deep 
underground is completely different from that of the ground near 
the surface that is producing such a ridiculous amount of 
leakage in downtown Tokyo. 
  In the tests JAERI conducted at a facility 240 meters below 
the surface in Canada, the underground water that flows through 
this layer (a fissure zone) was drawn into a large, sealed steel 
box via a pipe. Inside this box were large diameter pipes packed 
with various types of rock from that layer and arranged so the 
underground water would flow through them. Several types of 
radioactive substances were introduced via the inlet pipe, and 
the distance of their movement through the rock-filled pipes was 
carefully studied. The results of these experiments are as 
follows: 


    -  Roughly 90 percent of the radioactive substances 
introduced into the underground water were absorbed by the rock; 
  -  The greater the ratio of iron and biotite in the rocks, the 
greater the absorption of radioactive substances; and 
  -  Most 
significant, among the various types of radioactive substances, 
the "lighter" the nuclides were, the faster they moved through 
the rock, and the movement of "heavier" nuclides such as 
neptunium, plutonium, americium, etc., which are found in high 
level wastes, was much, much slower (for example, iodine moves 
110 times as fast as americium). 

    This fact is important because water 200 or 300 meters 
underground flows only a few meters a year. Because it flows so 
much slower than water near the surface, it is no exaggeration 
to say that movement of radioactivity from high level waste 
through the layers of rock in underground water occurs in 
ultra-slow motion. 
  We must remember that the purpose of these tests by JAERI 
was 
to focus only on the relationship between the bedrock (a natural 
barrier) in which the high level waste will be buried and the 
movement of radioactivity that has leached into the underground 
water. We should not forget that the high level waste will be 
surrounded by a triple wall (artificial barriers) consisting of 
(1) vitrification, (2) a metal protective container, and (3) a 
buffer material (a type of clay) between the protective 
container and the bedrock that will be nearly impermeable to 
underground water. Through many years of testing and research 
PNC has obtained a perspective on sealing in radioactivity for 
more than a thousand years, and this research by JAERI further 
supports the geological disposal of high level waste.

  [Text] Nagoya Institute of Technology's Professor Yoshihiro 
Abe, et al., in cooperation with the Chubu Electric Power 
Company, has developed a new way to produce a high-temperature 
superconductor encased in metal tubing. Using a crystallized 
glass method, melted bismuth-base material is poured into a 
tube-shaped container (mold) made of an inactive metal such as 
silver, where it is solidified, formed, then reheated while 
still in the container, thereby becoming superconductive. The 
unique feature of this method is that a substance such as silver 
oxide, which releases oxygen at a high temperature and does not 
easily obstruct superconductivity is added to the startup raw 
material in advance so that superconductivity is achieved 
without supplying oxygen during the heating process. This is 
being noted as an easy method to produce superconductors with 
complex shapes, such as silver-shielded superconducting coil. 
  To make superconductors practical, they need to be formed 
into wire, coils, pipes and many other shapes, but it is very 
difficult to do this with bismuth-based materials using 
powder-pressing or sintering, the methods normally used. In 
contrast, the crystallized glass method, the target of Professor 
Abe's R&amp;D, can be used to make any shape because the startup 
raw 
material is melted at temperatures from 1000ÎC to 
1400ÎC, poured into a container with the desired shape, and 
cooled and solidified quickly. 
  However, superconductors made with this method are not 
superconductive at the solidification stage. Thus to become 
superconductive, the external container had to be removed, then 
the substance heated when air or oxygen could be supplied. To 
achieve phase 223 and other superconducting crystals, oxygen 
must be supplied to change univalent copper ions in the startup 
raw material to bivalent copper ions. It was thought, therefore, 
that superconductivity could not be achieved if the heat process 
was applied when the material was in a non-oxygen state of being 
shielded by a metal container. 
  Methods are being studied to make bismuth-base 
superconductors into wire, either by cladding the wire with 
metal or by drawing the wire while already clad. Since 
processing would be greatly simplified if the metal container 
could become the shielding material, Professor Abe, et al., 
studied ways to achieve superconductivity while the material 
remained in the metal container, and tried to resolve the oxygen 
supplying problem by adding silver oxide to the startup raw 
material. 
  The breakthrough occurred when it was found that most of the 
univalent copper ions became bivalent by the release of oxygen 
from silver oxide at high temperatures. Addition of silver oxide 
to the startup raw material to raise critical current density 
has been tried with the sintering method, but this was the first 
time that it was revealed that it was possible to achieve 
superconductivity through reheating without oxygen or in a 
vacuum by the crystallized glass method. Experiments with thin, 
long, tube-shaped containers made of silver have been 
successful, and it is hoped that this can be developed as a 
practical way to fabricate superconductors.

  [Text] The Superconductivity Research Laboratory (SRL) has 
developed a high-temperature superconducting material that can 
generate magnetic force strong enough to levitate a linear motor 
car. The new material consists of normal conducting material 
inside superconducting material, and it can maintain an 
extremely strong magnetic force of 5 Tesla (unit expressing 
strength of magnetic force) at the temperature of liquid 
nitrogen (-196ÎC). SRL will proceed with application 
research aimed at use of this material in connection with the 
linear motor car. 
  The superconducting magnet being developed by the JR Group 
for the linear motor car must be cooled with liquid helium 
(-269ÎC), but the practicality of the linear motor car would 
be raised significantly if it could be cooled with liquid 
nitrogen. 
  When a magnetic field is applied to SRL's new material while 
in a superconducting state, a "pinning effect" is manifested in 
which the line of magnetic force is captured in the conductive 
material part, which itself becomes a permanent magnet. 
Substance composition and other details will be announced at the 
beginning of 1994, when the patent application has been 
completed. 
  With materials so far, 1.2 Tesla was the maximum magnetic 
force that could be maintained when material was made into a 
permanent magnet. The magnetic force of this new material 
actually was measured at 3 Tesla, but it is said that this can 
be raised to 5 Tesla. 3 Tesla is the level of magnetic force 
needed to replace the metal superconducting magnet for the 
linear motor car being built in Yamanashi Prefecture by the 
Railway Technical Research Institute, and this is the first time 
that barrier has been overcome. 
  Conversion from metal superconducting magnet to 
high-temperature superconducting substance is as easy as 
"changing a tire." Expressing his hopes regarding the new 
material, Railway Technical Research Institute Executive 
Director Masanori Ozeki says, "If we can switch to liquid 
nitrogen cooling, the practicality of the linear motor car and 
operating cost can be improved greatly."

  [Text] High-temperature superconductivity technology for 
achieving a superconductive state at the temperature of liquid 
nitrogen (-196ÎC) instead of liquid helium (-269ÎC) is 
approaching the realm of practical application. The Tokyo 
Electric Power Company (TEPCO) and the Shikoku Electric Power 
Company (SEPCO) individually developed power storage equipment 
that use the capability to levitate objects, and the 
Superconductivity Research Laboratory (SRL), which was 
established jointly by the government and the private sector, 
test-manufactured a superconducting IC by using the 
characteristic of high frequency. Bearings and sensors also have 
been produced. The focus of high-temperature superconductors 
used to be on development of material, but gradual progress from 
research to application is being made. 
<H5>  High-Sensitivity IC Test-Manufactured by SRL </H5>
  The power storage equipment developed by TEPCO and SEPCO 
stores energy when an object levitated by high-temperature 
superconductivity is rotated rapidly. It is said that this is 
the world's first of this type. 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  A high-temperature superconducting material called MPMG, 
which was developed by SRL, was used for this equipment. 
Conductive material is mixed with high-temperature 
superconducting material, and the magnetic flux from magnets 
cannot intersect the boundary surface and is repelled. Thus it 
will be levitated by an adequately strong magnet. Repellent 
force arises even if the magnets are brought closer together, 
but if MPMG and a magnet are placed on top of each other, the 
phenomenon of "repulsion in the vertical direction but fixed in 
the horizontal direction" occurs. 
  In SEPCO's device, a permanent magnet is embedded in the 
bottom of a revolving element that is 13.5 cm tall, has a 
maximum radius of 25 cm and weighs 27.5 kg. This is placed on a 
bed on which MPMG has been deposited. When the MPMG is cooled to 
the temperature of liquid nitrogen, it becomes superconductive 
and the revolving element is levitated. 
  When charging, the electromagnetic motor increases the 
rotation of the revolving element. When discharging, the same 
motor works as a power generator. The device is rotated at high 
speed, 23,000 rpm, and it can store 102 watt-hours of electric 
power. TEPCO's device has almost the same structure and it can 
store 50 watt-hours. 
  Both companies confirmed that the devices they 
test-manufactured worked as designed. Hereafter, they will wait 
for mass-production of material with three times the magnetic 
capability, then they will conduct R&amp;D to increase size and 
raise efficiency to about 85 percent. 
  Ultimately, the goal is to build a facility that can store 
around 10,000 kWh in each area substation and create a system to 
deal with fluctuations in power demand. Superconductive power 
storage equipment loses less power than pumped storage power 
plants, and it is thought that there will be few limiting 
conditions as far as sites are concerned. 
  On the other hand, the research group led by Katsumi Suzuki, 
chief researcher of SRL's Lab 6, is the first in the world to 
test manufacture a high-temperature superconducting IC in which 
a high-frequency antenna and signal processing Josephson devices 
were integrated on one chip. Because the important parts are 
made of a low-resistance superconducting material, high-speed 
signals can be picked up with good precision. In a test, music 
from a CD player was carried by high frequency, then received by 
a superconducting IC, which performed as anticipated. 
  The developed device is composed of two antennas that can 
receive 23 gigahertz (1 gigahertz = 1 billion hertz) microwave 
and six Josephson device circuits to extract data riding on the 
radio waves. Both are made of yttrium-base high-temperature 
superconductors and they were incorporated onto a 20 square 
millimeter substrate. 
  Superconducting circuits have virtually no electric 
resistance. Their strong point is that they can operate 
adequately even in high frequency bands where normal conductors 
lose their utility because resistance is too high. 
  Application sectors include inter-satellite communications 
using 60 gigahertz microwaves and automobile collision 
prevention radar. It is said that this can also be used for 
portable phones -- to raise the sensitivity of receiving 
stations and reduce power consumption. 
  Other applications of high-temperature superconducting 
technology are the magnetic bearings co-developed by SRL and 
Nippon Seiko and magnetic sensors developed by the 
superconducting sensor research institute, which is financed by 
the government and private sector. Both appeared on the scene 
this fall. 
<H5>  Editorial Comment: Quality Upgrade of Material Contributes </H5>
to Success 
  Behind the emergence of high-temperature superconducting 
technology application is the substantial upgrading of the 
quality of materials. Ceramic-base materials are used in 
high-temperature superconducting materials, but in the early 
stages, the characteristics of ceramics -- processing 
difficulty, brittleness -- impeded development and application. 
  Today, however, it is possible to make 1-inch monocrystals 
and line up their surfaces. If high-quality materials are made 
into substrates, the microprocessing on the substrates can be 
done with existing technology. Furthermore, the weak points in 
the strong surface are being conquered. Shoji Tanaka, director 
of SRL, says that "High-temperature superconductors no longer 
have to be ceramic," thereby stressing the fact that 
high-temperature superconductors are becoming components like 
metal and semiconductors. 
  Almost all high-temperature superconductivity researchers 
have stressed development of new materials, but recently, there 
has been a lull in the push to discover materials, and some 
thought that research fervor had cooled. In the midst of this, 
the SRL was established in Japan with government and private 
funding and is working on raising the quality of materials and 
upgrading performance. It can be said that this has led to a 
series of successes. 
  It cannot be said that the phenomenon of high-temperature 
superconductivity has been fully revealed. As was the case with 
semiconducting technology, however, when good material is 
created, basic research is advanced, which in turn leads to the 
development of even more new materials. SRL Director Tanaka 
predicts that this productive cycle will occur with 
high-temperature superconductivity as well.

  [Excerpt] Here, we will introduce two research projects. 
Unlike the Chu group's approach of using super high pressure, 
this is research applying super high pressure to superconductor 
fabrication. It should be called research to discover new 
high-temperature superconductors, not just fabrication of new 
high-temperature superconductors. 
  The two research projects are from the group of Professor 
Mikio Takano of Kyoto University's Chemical Research Institute, 
inorganic materials chemical research sector III (solid state 
chemistry), and the group of Professor Jun Akimitsu of Aoyama 
Gakuin University's Department of Science and Engineering, 
Physics curriculum. Although the two come from different 
disciplines (chemistry and physics), they are both attacking the 
problem of finding high-temperature superconductors with super 
high pressure. 
<H5>  Super High Pressure Realizes the Dream of Infinitely Layered </H5>
Material 
  The Takano group achieved two very interesting results in 
1992 and 1993, which are drawing a great deal of attention. 
  In 1992, this group succeeded in fabricating an infinitely 
layered Sr(Ca)CuO[.sub]2[/] with only alkaline earth 
varieties and copper. In 1993, the group fabricated SrCuO. 
Neither are substances with exceptionally high critical 
temperature (Tc), but exceptionally high Tc was possible with 
super high pressure. Before explaining about infinitely layered 
materials, we should touch upon the relationship of Tc and the 
crystalline structure of materials in high temperature 
superconductors. 
  Superconductors discovered thus far have been copper oxides. 
For these materials to become superconductive, the existence of 
CuO[.sub]2[/] planes is essential. It was after 1988 that it 
came to be realized, albeit slowly, that the number of 
CuO[.sub]2[/] planes in crystal structure might be related to 
Tc rise. As the planes increased one by one, Tc rose. So the 
question was asked, what would happen if the number of 
CuO[.sub]2[/] planes was increased, or if CuO[.sub]2[/] 
planes were layered in unlimited number? 
  Many groups took up the challenge, but did not succeed. The 
solution was the Takano group's super high pressure fabrication 
method. The high temperature superconductor fabricated by 
applying 60,000 atmospheres was an infinite-layer material of 
only alkaline varieties and copper with extremely simple 
structure, but a Tc of 110 K was achieved in the group's 
experiments. 
  The 1993 research built on those results, and produced a 
compound with a simple structure of only SrCuO. This substance 
does not become superconductive if fabricated under normal 
pressure, but if fabricated in an environment of 60,000 
atmospheres, it becomes a high temperature superconductor. 
Figure 1 shows the structure with normal pressure fabrication 
and with high pressure fabrication. The CuO[.sub]2[/] planes, 
which play a critical role in superconductivity, show up 
remarkably in the case of high pressure fabrication. It is 
thought that the infinite-layer material discovered by the 
Takano group in 1992 is in the same family as this material. 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  Mr. Takano characterizes his research position thusly: "In 
some ways, we are isolated from information here, unlike in 
Tokyo, but this gives us the resolve to do independent research." 
  High temperature superconductivity was discovered at the end 
of 1986, when Mr. Takano was doing research on perovskite 
oxides, and he was researching super high pressure as part of 
that. He was shocked when the high temperature superconductor 
appeared because his perovskite research was focused mainly on 
iron, not copper. The sudden appearance of high temperature 
superconductivity was too alluring. 
  "One chemist handles only a few compounds in his research 
life. Of these, no substance could be more interesting than 
this," thought Takano, and resolved to take on high temperature 
superconductivity. However, he thought that "With only three of 
us in the group, we will have to use methods that no others are 
trying if we are going to achieve remarkable results," and he 
decided to put his experience with "pressure" to use as the 
starting point of his attack on superconductivity. 
  However, a co-researcher transferred out of a university 
that 
had super high pressure equipment, and the group lost access to 
such equipment. Therefore, they made arrangements with Kobe 
Steel, which was using the equipment to manufacture diamonds, 
and began the pursuit of creating superconductive material with 
high pressure. Because they used the high pressure equipment 
only when it was not being used for diamond production, it took 
a month between the time that they sent sample powder to Kobe 
Steel and got back the material fabricated under high pressure. 
Despite this, Takano's group achieved the above-mentioned result 
of infinite layers. 
  As time passed, Kobe Steel's equipment was increasingly 
dedicated to its primary task of diamond production, until 
finally, there was no time to fit in Takano's research. At the 
end of 1992, the group's own equipment worth &yen;30 million was 
installed in the chemical research laboratory. 
  The 10-ton equipment has been installed in a brick building 
that was an ammunition storehouse for the former imperial army. 
The core of this huge equipment is barely the size of a thumb. 
As shown in Figure 2, superconductors are fabricated in a gold 
capsule 3mm in diameter and 3mm in length. 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  Only 50 mg can be produced at a time. This is adequate for 
samples, but the expense -- &yen;4,000-&yen;5,000 -- is a 
problem. Furthermore, it takes four hours to make one sample, so 
a whole day's work produces only four samples. The research is 
costly in time and money. On top of that, since the use of super 
high pressure for superconductor fabrication has just started, 
"Everything is based on intuition." What should the group's 
goals be? "To be honest, you cannot get away from the 
CuO[.sub]2[/] plane. We would like to overcome that somehow." 
  It appears that, after all, the group's goal is to find a 
non-copper-base high temperature superconductor made of 
something else besides copper oxide. 
<H5>  Material Search Wizard </H5>
  Mr. Akimitsu's goal also is to find a non-copper-base high 
temperature superconductor. The Akimitsu group is large -- 10 
members. Even when we visited his lab, we saw students napping 
between the equipment, and instruments were going non-stop. 
Although many superconductivity labs tend to lose vitality, this 
one was overflowing with enthusiasm. 
  Mr. Akimitsu's quest for superconductors is well-recognized 
and he has discovered more new superconductors than one can 
count on two hands. While any researcher would feel blessed to 
discover one new superconductor in a lifetime, the Akimitsu 
group has produced one high temperature superconductor after 
another. He truly is a wizard in finding materials. 
  The materials include a neodymium-base material discovered 
in 
1988. This is a very well-known crude type superconductor that 
subsequently was developed into an electron doping type 
superconductor by a Tokyo University group. 
  More recently, there is the CO[.sub]3[/] base family of 
materials. This is a large family of over 10 in all, including a 
group called C1212-base materials that are fabricated under 
super high pressure. This group is seen to be the most promising 
in the CO[.sub]3[/]-base family. Joint research is being 
conducted on the C1212 group with Professor Nobuo Mori of Tokyo 
University's Institute for Solid State Physics, which has super 
high pressure equipment. Interesting data already seems to have 
been produced, and an announcement by Mr. Akimitsu is probably 
not far off. 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  Why is Mr. Akimitsu, a physicist, searching for materials? 
"The creation of a new material means the birth of a new law of 
physics. As a physics specialist, that is my goal." 
  Even Mr. Akimitsu says that the appearance of copper oxide 
superconductors was a shock, but his wealth of research 
experience has helped greatly in his subsequent quest. 
  At one time, Mr. Akimitsu said, with regard to the quest for 
high temperature superconductors, that they were "substances 
created by God." Recently, however, he says that predictions can 
be made on copper oxide-base materials to some extent. The quest 
for copper oxide-base superconductors has entered the mature 
stage, although, to be sure, 10 times the number of announced 
successes have been fabricated and then discarded. 
  "The quest for materials is a contest of ideas, but ideas 
are 
not enough. A new material is found only when ideas are 
multiplied by luck and tenacity." 
  That is the way Mr. Akimitsu lightly dismissed the art of 
the 
material quest, but there is no doubt that some very awesome 
effort lies behind it. "For every new material, there is a new 
law of physics." This philosophy is what directs his students 
toward the difficult task of material hunting and their research 
achievements are the energy that drive the hunt. Mr. Akimitsu 
also is turning in the ambitious direction of the quest for 
non-copper base superconductors. 
  "I think that discovering whether superconductivity is 
possible without copper will be the big game. We have to work 
hard to win it." 
  There is great interest in what short of material will 
emerge, but when asked if he has any ideas, Mr. Akimitsu says, 
"No comment." Today, when Japanese superconductivity research 
has waned, the way to rejuvenate it is fabrication of 
non-copper-base superconductors. 
  This will be a liberation from the strong fetters of copper 
oxides as well, and it will be when Mr. Akimitsu's goal, the 
birth of a new law of physics, will be realized.

  [Text] Isuzu Ceramics Research Corporation (ICRC, Fujisawa 
City, Kanagawa Prefecture), an R&amp;D subsidiary of Isuzu Motors 
Ltd., has developed an Si-N-Al-Ti-O-based structural ceramic 
material (silicon-nitrogen-aluminum-titanium-oxygen) with high 
bending strength, low thermal conductivity, and a low 
thermal-expansion coefficient. This ceramic material, a 
reaction-sintered product of a mixture of silicon nitride 
(Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/]) and aluminum titanate 
(Al[.sub]2[/]TiO[.sub]5[/]), was developed to be used for 
automotive engine components. In energetic pursuit of the 
development of ceramic-made adiabatic diesel engines, ICRC was 
trying to simultaneously achieve three desirable physical 
properties for a ceramic material to be used for the combustion 
chamber of an adiabatic engine. The properties were high 
strength, low thermal conductivity to manifest excellent 
heat-insulation capacity, and a low thermal-expansion 
coefficient to discourage the generation of thermal stress due 
to repeated heating and cooling. 
  Previously, zirconia (ZrO[.sub]2[/])-based, partially 
stabilized zirconia, and aluminum titanate 
(Al[.sub]2[/]TiO[.sub]5[/]) were used to test-produce 
combustion chambers of ceramic, adiabatic diesel engines, to 
maintain the high adiabatic nature of the chambers. However, the 
zirconia-based material had not only a large thermal-expansion 
coefficient, but also a high density of 9 g/cm[.sup]3[/]; 
whereas aluminum titanate was poor in bending strength 
(four-point bending) at 30-40 MPa. 
  After a search for new ceramics that had the desired, 
specific physical properties, ICRC zeroed in on 
reaction-sintered silicon nitride, which had a relatively low 
thermal conductivity of 16 W/m K (after correction to a solid 
portion only) bkecause of its high concentration of pores. In 
addition, according to Mr. Hidenori Kita, Chief Researcher in 
Material Research Department, ``silicon nitride was found to be 
made with wide-ranging properties depending on the type and the 
quantity of a sintering aid.'' Furthermore, reaction-sintered 
silicon nitride appeared to be a promising ceramic material with 
high bending strength. 
  ICRC tested aluminum titanate, alumina silicate 
(Al[.sub]2[/]SiO[.sub]13[/]), lanthanum oxide 
(La[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]) and cerium oxide (ceria, 
CeO[.sub]2[/]) as a potential sintering aid to be added to 
reaction-sintered silicon nitride, because these compounds had 
been known to reduce thermal conductivity. 
  One of these sintering aids was added to microfine silicon 
(Si) powder with a particle size range of 5-10 Êm, and the 
blended powder was press-molded to form a green compact, which 
was subjected to reaction-sintering by heating in a nitrogen 
(N[.sub]2[/]) atmosphere. In principle, the nitrification 
reaction proceeds from the surfaces of silicon particles inward, 
and reaction-sintered silicon nitride is produced when the 
nitrification is completed through the core of each particle. No 
shrinkage occurs during the sintering process, because the green 
compact made of silicon powder is nitrified. As a result, the 
dimensions of the sintered compact are exactly the same as that 
of the green compact. 
  Thus, it is possible to fabricate near-net-shape products by 
the above method, although the sintered compact has many pores 
because of no shrinkage. 
  The above-mentioned group of sintering aids was narrowed 
down 
to two, aluminum titanate and alumina silicate, based on their 
capabilities to drastically decrease thermal conductivity and to 
maintain strength after the oxidation treatment for densifying 
sintered compacts. Subsequently, aluminum titanate was selected 
over alumina silicate based on the bending strengths, thermal 
conductivities, and the absolute values of thermal expansion 
coefficients. 
  It was found that the thermal conductivity of the compact 
was 
lowest when 35-wt-percent aluminum titanate was added, and any 
further addition of the aid rather increased the thermal 
conductivity. It was also found that the thermal conductivity of 
the reaction-sintered compact containing 35-wt-percent aluminum 
titanate was further decreased after it was subjected to a 
post-sintering oxidation treatment. Based on experimental 
results, the maximum effect of reducing the thermal conductivity 
was achieved when the oxidation treatment was carried out at 
800ÎC. The reaction-sintered compact containing 
35-wt-percent aluminum titanate had a structure, in that 
aluminum titanate crystal-rich ceramic parts (with an average 
size of 20-30 Êm) were dispersed in a sintered cluster of 
silicon nitride crystal grains with an average size of 1 Êm. 
When this compact was oxidized at 800ÎC, titanium nitride 
(TiN), which had been formed by the nitrification of titania 
(TiO[.sub]2[/]) and is a component of the complex oxide of 
aluminum titanate, was oxidized back into titania. Since titania 
was less thermally conductive than titanium nitride, the entire 
compact became less conductive. 
  After the oxidation treatment, the aluminum titanate-rich 
core portions were found to have high concentrations of alumina 
(Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]), and the peripheral areas were 
made of a mixed phase of alumina and titania. 
  Mr. Kita conjectures that this oxidation-formed structure 
consisting of multiple layers of different compositions 
``decreases the thermal conductivity because the structure 
impedes heat flow by scattering heat-transmitting phonons.'' 
However, the heating required for the oxidation treatment tends 
to diffuse the constituent elements of the ceramics, and the 
porosity is reduced to 20+ percent, which in turn reduces the 
volume fraction of ``void'' that is supposed to function to keep 
the thermal conductivity of the entire ceramic material low. As 
a result, the thermal conductivity increases. 
  Thus, the oxidation treatment conditions were determined 
based on the balance between an advantage of lower thermal 
conductivity resulting from the multiple-layer structure and a 
disadvantage of higher thermal conductivity resulting from the 
decreased porosity. 
  Incidentally, the newly developed, reaction-sintered, 
silicon 
nitride-based ceramic material showed a bending strength 
(four-point bending) of 125 MPa, a vertical elastic modulus of 
75 GPa, and a density of 2.3 g/cm[.sup]3[/]. In addition, the 
key property of thermal conductivity of this material was 2.6 
W/m/K at room temperature, 2.3 W/m/K at 540ÎC, and 2.4 W/m/K 
at 800ÎC; its thermal expansion coefficient was excellent at 
3.1 10[.sup]-[/]6/ÎC; and its anti-heat shock strength 
was ¯538ÎC. It is conjectured that the excellent 
mechanical properties of this material, including the bending 
strength, were attained as a result of the precise size control 
for silicon nitride crystal grains to approximately 1 Êm.

  [Text] Electro-rheological (ER) fluid generally denotes all 
the fluids whose viscosities can be controlled by electric 
voltage. When such fluid is used, it is possible to see dampers 
whose damping forces can be easily changed. However, all 
previous attempts to commercialize ER fluids were unsuccessful 
because the ranges of their viscosity changes were too narrow, 
and their characteristics were unstable, in particular, with 
time. Recently, several companies in Japan have successfully 
overcome those drawbacks and improved the performance of ER 
fluids, and some of the companies have begun to develop 
applications for the fluid. 
  An ER fluid, as is, is merely a colloidal solution with 
fluidity. However, when an electrical field of several kV/mm is 
applied, the liquid loses its fluidity; in some cases, the fluid 
state is changed to nearly a solid state. When the electrical 
field is turned off, the original state is regained. ER fluids 
have that interesting property. 
  The existence of ER fluids has been known for about 40 
years, 
and proposals have been made for the use of ER fluids in 
variable-force dampers and clutches. Efforts have also been made 
in applications research. 
  Although many research-scale applications attempts have been 
made, no practical implementation was realized that would have 
an impact on the market. Previous ER fluids had many weaknesses 
in terms of implementation: the narrow ranges of viscosity 
change, the unstable characteristics, and the sedimentation of 
dispersed particles. 
  Recently, several companies in Japan have developed ER 
fluids 
with nearly implementable characteristics by overcoming the 
above-mentioned shortcomings. The new fluids are not only more 
reliable with more stable properties, but also have more 
practical features for implementation, i.e., the use of a 
non-aqueous material in the fluid to permit a wider temperature 
range of application, and the improved dispersion stability via 
more closely matched specific gravities of the dispersed phase 
and the insulating oil. Furthermore, an attempt is also under 
way to try liquid crystals for ER liquids to improve their 
performance. 
<H5>  Development of `Usable' ER Fluids by More Than 10 Companies </H5>
  At the New Materials Exhibition in May 1993, Bridgestone 
Corp. (Bridgestone) disclosed its new ER fluid containing 
micro-particles of a carbon compound and also displayed a damper 
using the ER fluid and a test-product to demonstrate 
vibration-proof mounting. By the end of 1993, Bridgestone says 
it will begin sample distribution. 
  Other companies that have announced their ER fluid 
development activities include Asahi Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. 
(ACI), Nippon Shokubai Kagaku Kogyo Co., Ltd. (Nippon Shokubai), 
Nippon Oil Co., Ltd. (Nippon Oil), Fujikura Kasei Co., Ltd. 
(Fujikura Kasei), and Nippon Mektron Co., Ltd. (Nippon Mektron, 
with main office in Tokyo). There are, however, more makers than 
listed above that are engaged in the development of an ER fluid. 
  For example, in the period from January through August 1993, 
there were more than 30 ER fluid-related patent applications 
filed and officially published. These applications were filed 
by, in addition to the companies listed above, Osaka Gas Co., 
Ltd.; Tonen Sekiyu Kagaku K.K.; Toray-Dow Corning Selicone Co., 
Ltd. (main office in Tokyo); Toyota Central Research Institute 
(main office in Nagakute Cho, Aichi Prefecture); Nissan Motor 
Co., Ltd.; Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd.; and 
Mitsubishi Chemical Industries Ltd. Perhaps, there are 
additional makers that are secretly pursuing ER fluid 
development. 
  As the level of ER fluids approaches perfection, development 
activities concerning applications and peripheral technologies 
have also begun to flourish. Bridgestone has accumulated 
technologies concerning control and power source through the 
test-production of the vibration-proof mount and the damper. 
Other ER fluid developers are working in cooperation with 
partners. 
  It has been a long time since ER fluids attracted the 
attention of mechanical engineers as the ``new mechanical 
element.'' Today, the fluids appear to have gained the status of 
being ``usable.'' 
<H5>  Smooth Actuation of Air-Pressure Cylinders with ER Fluid </H5>
  Examples of ER fluid applications will be discussed below. 
  CKD Corp., an air-pressure-device maker, jointly with Nippon 
Shokubai, is in the process of developing a technology for using 
an ER fluid to control the speed of an air-pressure cylinder 
(Fig. 3). The ER fluid was developed by Nippon Shokubai. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-03A>      Figure 3. Air-Pressure Conveying Device using ER Fluid </FIG>


  Conveying devices using air-pressure cylinders are 
lightweight and are capable of generating strong force and high 
speed. On the other hand, such devices make such sudden moves to 
start and to stop that they produce a shock in their operation; 
furthermore, it is difficult to stop them accurately in 
mid-position. According to Mr. Kazuhisa Ito, of the Development 
Department of the Air-Pressure Business Division of CKD Corp., a 
method had been developed to more precisely control air pressure 
by means of a servo valve, but ``the method was never able to 
completely overcome the shortcoming of unsmooth movement.'' 
  In contrast, the ER fluid-using air-pressure cylinder can 
move as smoothly as ``a conveying device that combines a screw 
and a servo motor,'' according to Mr. Ito. Furthermore, a system 
using the cylinder is simpler and less expensive than a system 
using a servo valve. 
  As shown in Figure 4, the system under development is 
constructed with two cylinders: one filled with an ER fluid, and 
the other being an air cylinder. The ER fluid cylinder is a part 
of a closed circuit with both cylinder ends joined through the 
electrodes. When pressure is applied to the air cylinder, the 
piston moves and pushes the ER fluid to the electrode section. 
The pushed ER fluid passes between the electrodes and returns to 
the opposite side of the piston. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-03B>      Figure 4. Combination of ER Fluid and Air Cylinders </FIG>


  A voltage is applied to the electrodes to stop the piston. 
Depending on the magnitude of the voltage, the viscosity of the 
ER fluid increases; and the flow between the electrodes is 
impeded. When sufficient voltage is applied, the flow stops 
completely and the piston comes to a halt. 
  The only function of the air pressure is the generation of 
force. The speed of the piston is controlled by the voltage to 
be applied to the electrodes. When the voltage is gradually 
increased, the piston will smoothly come to a stop. By adding a 
position sensor, the piston's position can be simply determined. 
  As discussed above, the method of using the electrode 
section 
as a flow-rate control valve that can continuously control the 
flow rate without moving parts is the typical usage of an ER 
fluid. Basically, the same idea can be applied to construct a 
vibration-proof mount and a damper (Fig. 5). Such an ER fluid 
system is simpler in structure and more reliable than a system 
using mechanical valves and hydraulic pressure. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-04A>      Figure 5. Structure of ER Vibration-Proof Mount Developed </FIG>


<H5>  Flow Impeded by Particle Chains Between Electrodes With </H5>
Change in Apparent Viscosity 
  If ER fluids are defined as ``fluids whose viscosities can 
be 
controlled by voltage,'' the ER fluids that are currently under 
development can be classified roughly into two groups. One group 
is the ``dispersion-type'' ER fluids that are dispersions of 
particles in an insulating oil. Until very recently, all ER 
fluids belonged to this group. 
  The other group is a group using liquid crystals as the ER 
fluids. Studies involving ER fluids of the second group have 
just gotten under way. Dispersion-type ER fluids have 
electrically polarizable particles dispersed in an insulation 
oil. In many cases, the insulation oil is silicone oil. The 
mechanism for viscosity change is explained in the following 
manner (Fig. 6). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-04B>      Figure 6. Mechanism for ER Effect Manifestation. Particles </FIG>


  When a voltage is applied, an induced electrical field 
between the electrodes polarizes particles that are dispersed in 
the fluid. The polarization of particles creates an attractive 
force among them, and the particle chains are formed between the 
electrodes. These chains impede the flow of the fluid, resulting 
in an ``apparent'' viscosity increase for the fluid. This 
phenomenon is called the ER effect. As the mechanism clearly 
indicates, the greater the polarization of particles, the more 
profound the ER effect. 
  Earlier ER fluids did not manifest sufficient ER effect, or 
the polarization of particles in them was too unstable to make 
the characteristics of the fluids reliable. Today, improvements 
have resulted in particles that reliably show marked ER effects 
becoming available. 
  The shear stress of a dispersion-type ER fluid can be 
expressed as a function of the shear rate, as in Figure 7(a). 
When a voltage is applied, the fluid behaves uniquely like a 
Bingham fluid by displaying a force (surrender stress) that 
fixes the electrodes at zero shear rate. 
  The magnitude of surrender stress is one of the indexes for 
the magnitude of an ER effect. Although it is different from 
fluid to fluid, surrender stress values for the newest 
dispersion-type ER fluids range from 0.5 kPa to 4 kPa. To make 
this change more understandable in a familiar sense, it is 
approximately equivalent to the change ``from milk to cheese,'' 
according to Chief Researcher Kazuya Edamura, of the Technical 
Development Department, Technical Division, Fujikura Kasei. 
  The ER effect of a dispersion-type ER fluid diminishes when 
the shear rate exceeds a certain level, because particle chains 
are broken down by shearing. As long as the shear rate remains 
low, these broken chains can recombine with adjacent chains; but 
the recombination becomes difficult as the shear rate increases. 
  The liquid crystal-type ER fluid behaves completely 
differently from the dispersion-type ER fluid. When an 
electrical field is applied, the viscosity changes for the 
liquid crystal-type as it does for the dispersion type. However, 
the liquid crystal-type literally changes its ``viscosity'' 
(Fig. 7(b)). This viscosity-changing phenomenon will not 
disappear even after the shear rate increases. As far as the 
liquid crystal-type ER fluids of today are concerned, the rates 
of viscosity change are more than one order smaller than the 
rates for the dispersion-type ER fluids. Thus, it is necessary 
to design devices so as to have a narrow distance between the 
electrodes, in order to be able to use a liquid crystal-type ER 
fluid in the same manner as a dispersion-type ER fluid. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-05A>      Figure 7. Different Characteristics of Dispersion-Type (a) </FIG>


<H5>  Attempt to Improve Total Balance With Full Manifestation of </H5>
ER Effect 
  In order to implement a dispersion-type ER fluid as a 
machine 
component, the following items, in addition to the magnitude of 
the ER effect, need to be considered: 
  (1) high level of response; 
  (2) low power consumption; 
  (3) stable dispersion after standing for long period of 
time; 
  (4) a wide range for actuation temperatures. 
  Needless to say, the fluid need not have an excellent rating 
in each and every item listed, because requirements for the 
fluid vary, depending on its application (see box below). For 
example, an automotive engine room must be able to function 
reliably up to a temperature of 120ÎC, while such a wide 
actuation temperature range may not be needed for uses in a 
factory. 
  The key consideration is to have an all-around balance 
instead of one super-excellent rating among other so-so ratings. 
A maker needs developmental skill to create this balance of 
ratings for an ER fluid, while maintaining its stable and 
significant ER effect. The particular area where the uniqueness 
of each maker is shown to be most pronounced is the method of 
securing the dispersion stability for an ER fluid. 
  When left standing undisturbed, a dispersion-type ER fluid 
loses its colloidal state because the dispersed particles 
settle. When this happens, the fluid is no longer an ER fluid. 
Thus, one needs to make such an ER fluid capable of maintaining 
the colloidal state as long as possible, and/or being readily 
redispersed even if sedimentation has taken place. 
  The basic approach to this problem is to use a surfactant to 
make particles repel each other in the absence of an electrical 
field. When coagulation of particles is prevented, sedimentation 
proceeds slowly. Also, even if sedimentation has occurred, 
particles can be redispersed easily. 
  The next approach is to make it difficult for particles 
themselves to settle. This approach can be roughly divided into 
two groups. One involves making particles as microfine as 
possible, so they will stay dispersed due to their Brownian 
motion. Nippon Mektron developed its ER fluid based on this 
idea. Takahisa Akatsuka, the associate head of the Second 
Development Department, Development Division, Nippon Mektron, 
says this: ``We see practically no sedimentation with particles 
with a diameter of 0.45 Êm.'' 
  The other involves making the specific gravity of the 
particles essentially equal to that of an insulating oil. If 
they are exactly the same, theoretically no sedimentation will 
occur. In order to use this approach, one must produce particles 
from a material with small specific gravity. As a result of this 
consideration, an organic polymer, whose specific gravity can be 
controlled with comparative ease, is used to make particles for 
an ER fluid by ACI, Nippon Oil, and Nippon Shokubai. 
  Fujikura Kasei developed an ER fluid containing spherical 
particles made of an organic polymer in whose surfaces finer 
inorganic grains were embedded (Fig. 9). The idea was to 
generate the ER effect with the inorganic grains on the particle 
surfaces and to match the specific gravity of the particle to 
that of the liquid medium by using the polymer spheres for the 
particles. The polymer spheres are total insulators that give 
the added advantage of consuming an extremely small quantity of 
electric currents. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-06A>      Figure 9. Electron Micrograph of Dispersed Particles to Be </FIG>


  However, it is still impossible to completely eradicate the 
problem of dispersion stability. It may be necessary to 
compromise to some degree. Chief Researcher Yuichi Ishino, of 
the Sixth R&amp;D Group, Second R&amp;D Division, Bridgestone, 
says 
this: ``We don't worry about slight sedimentation as long as a 
fluid has excellent redispersibility.'' 
<H5>  Aiming for Market Niche With Advantages of </H5>
Dispersion-Problem-Free Liquid Crystal-Type ER Fluids 
  No matter how hard one tries, one cannot escape the problem 
of dispersion stability if one is dealing with a dispersion-type 
fluid. Is there no homogeneous ER fluid that can solve this 
dispersion problem? Liquid crystal-type ER fluids emerged based 
on this thought. 
  Liquid crystal-type ER fluids may be either ER fluids 
low-molecular-weight liquid crystals or ER fluids using 
high-molecular-weight liquid crystals. A well-known ER fluid of 
the first group is the one developed by Nikko-Kyoseki Co., Ltd. 
(Nikko-Kyoseki). Examples of the second group are the one 
disclosed by ACI and another under development by Nippon Oil. 
  Liquid crystal-type ER fluids have several advantages, in 
addition to being free of the dispersion problem. Assistant 
Professor Shin Morishita of the Shipbuilding and Marine 
Engineering Section, Construction Department, Faculty of 
Engineering, Yokohama National University, test-produced a 
variable-attenuation-force damper (Fig. 10) by using 
low-molecular-weight liquid crystals for display. According to 
Morishita, ``the best advantage of the liquid crystal type is 
that it can be used in a high-shear-rate region where the 
dispersion type loses the ER effect.'' In addition, unlike the 
dispersion type, the liquid crystal-type behaves as a Newton 
fluid under the influence of an electrical field, i.e., the 
stress increases in proportion to the shear rate. Therefore, the 
control of a vibration-controlled damper becomes simple when a 
liquid crystal-type ER fluid is used. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-07A>      Figure 10. Variable-Attenuation-Force Damper Using Liquid </FIG>


  There are two problems with liquid crystal-type ER fluids. 
They are expensive, and their viscosities vary much less than 
that of dispersion-type ER fluids. Today, low-molecular-weight 
liquid crystals for display are sold at approximately &yen;1,500 
per g. It is unlikely that the price will come down when the 
liquid crystals begin to be used for ER fluids. 
High-molecular-weight liquid crystals cost much less, at 
approximately several tens of thousands of yen per kg. In 
contrast, a mass-produced, dispersion-type ER fluid is said to 
often be sold at a price of less than &yen;5,000 per kg. 
  Both low- and high-molecular-weight liquid crystal-type ER 
fluids currently show a viscosity change rate of approximately a 
factor of 10. However, since the base (original) viscosity of 
the high-molecular-weight liquid crystal-type is high, ``it is 
possible to obtain a shear stress of approximately 1 kPa at a 
shear rate of 400 s[.sup]-1[/] and under an electrical field 
of 5 kV/mm,'' says a spokesperson for the New Chemistry 
Laboratory, Central Research Institute, Nippon Oil. 
  Some researchers, like Mr. Hideichi Okubo, of the R&amp;D 
Planning Department, Nikko-Kyoseki, are of the opinion that 
``the small viscosity change can be supplemented by a narrower 
distance between the electrodes when the device is designed. 
This design is possible with the liquid crystal-type ER fluid 
because its particles never plug up between the electrodes. The 
narrower distance between the electrodes permits the production 
of a more compact device.'' If only a small quantity of the ER 
fluid is required for a compact device, the price will not be a 
serious problem. 
  Thus, according to Chief Researcher Akio Inoue, of the 
Technical Research Institute, ACI, ``with the advantages of 
their Newtonian behavior, being free of the problem of 
dispersion stability, and being suitable for compact devices, 
[liquid crystal-type ER fluids] are expected to gain some niche 
in application fields along with dispersion ER fluids.'' 
<H5>  Joint Development is Key for Implementation; Quick </H5>
Partnership through Information Disclosure 
  Those who are involved with ER fluids seem to be unanimous 
in 
saying that the future of ER fluids ``depends on whether or not 
appropriate application products can be discovered.'' The key to 
the development of such products for an ER fluid maker will be 
the cooperative relationship with a machine manufacturer. 
  Thus far, ER fluid development has been pursued primarily by 
each material maker alone. Even if a maker had some cooperative 
partners, the number was only a few. The reason was that each ER 
fluid maker was developing a fluid as a top-secret project, 
aiming for applications only for automobile-related markets with 
potentially a growing demand. 
  However, today, the auto industry in the midst of a severe 
recession is not expected to implement these devices 
immediately. ``Technically speaking,'' an auto maker that has 
aggressively attempted to develop an engine mount using an ER 
fluid confesses, ``we should have no difficulty implementing the 
engine mount, although it will be difficult for us to absorb its 
cost.'' 
  The technology levels of ER fluid makers each have 
advantages 
and disadvantages, and no single one offers a marked 
superiority. In other words, no one ER fluid is outstandingly 
superb. Under these circumstances, it is advantageous for an ER 
fluid maker to join forces with a machine maker capable of 
application development. It is unreasonable to assume that an ER 
fluid device can be implemented without cooperative exchange 
between an ER fluid maker and a machine maker. Therefore, an ER 
fluid maker may try to improve an ER fluid, for example, to 
match the specifications of a machine, and a machine maker may 
attempt to offset any weakness of an ER fluid with machine 
design, if necessary. 
  The quickest way to make contact with an excellent machine 
maker is to disclose information as soon as possible. 
Bridgestone announced its ER fluid technology at the 1993 New 
Materials Exposition precisely because Bridgestone ``wanted to 
openly solicit a machine maker that will be a future partner,'' 
according to Department Head Norio Goto, of the Sixth R&amp;D 
Group, 
Second R&amp;D Division, Bridgestone. As a result, says Goto, 
Bridgestone ``received inquiries from more than 200 companies. A 
few of them have already begun cooperative projects with us.'' 
In the future, other companies are expected to follow the lead 
of Bridgestone through information disclosure. 
  Chief Researcher Asahi Sugimoto, of the Machine Research 
Section, Industrial Safety Institute, Ministry of Labor, says 
this: ``Using an ER fluid, it would be easy to make an actuator 
like a muscle that is capable of making a stand while suspending 
action. It would be difficult to do so by any other method.'' 
Professor Nao Sasada at Precision Engineering Department, Chiba 
Institute of Technology, appreciates the value of ER fluids. He 
says: ``In normal machine design, viscosity is treated as a 
constant. However, the viscosity of an ER fluid is a variable, 
which may force the modification of the basic machine design 
concept.'' 
  Chief Researcher Sugimoto and Professor Sasada are two of 
the 
pioneers in ER fluid research in Japan. Apparently, ER fluid 
development has been pursued with the vague expectation 
expressed by these pioneers. It is a fact that previous ER 
fluids have never achieved a state of completion that invites 
ideas for actual applications, i.e., How are they to be used, 
and for what? Today, it appears that, when solutions are being 
found for many problems, mechanical engineers are beginning to 
question the true value of ER fluids. The fluids of ``dreams'' 
have traveled a long road to reach today's status. They ought 
not die in vain without realizing the dream. 
  [Box, pp 38, 39] 
<H5>  Potential Applications for Latest ER Fluids -- Fields </H5>
Involving Vibration As Key Factor 
  What kind of applications can be expected for the latest ER 
fluids? 
  Roughly speaking, dispersion-type ER fluids can be used for 
one of two things: for clutches by making use of a surrender 
stress generated by the fluids, or for use as a flow-control 
valve by making use of their viscosity change, as discussed 
earlier in the main text in reference to air-pressure cylinders. 
If used as a clutch, the force to be transmitted can be 
determined by the magnitude of the surrender stress. It appears 
difficult to find realistic clutch applications for today's ER 
fluids, whose surrender stress amounts to only several kPa. 
  More realistic applications should be found in the 
flow-control valve area. The currently most popular idea is to 
use the flow-control valve in the form of an ER fluid for 
dampers with variable attenuation force. Where will the 
variable-attenuation-force dampers that use an ER fluid be used? 
Basically, they will be used in the field where problematic 
vibrations need to be suppressed through the active control of a 
damper. For example, the field includes automotive devices, such 
as suspensions and vibration-proof mounts. 
  In addition, applications are possible for incorporating a 
device in industrial machines, such as conveying devices. 
Professor Junji Furusho's group at the Mechanical Control 
Engineering Department, University of Electro-Communications, is 
considering the incorporation of ER fluid devices into a robot's 
arms. While an arm is in motion, the device will not function as 
a damper, and damping occurs a moment before the motion is to 
stop. The device will help reduce vibration prior to a stop, 
improving the precision and simultaneously increasing the speed 
of position determination. 
  Needless to say, each set of specifications for an ER fluid 
is different depending on application requirements. However, 
such information has never been clarified. Therefore, material 
makers are completely confused when they say, ``We have no idea 
as to what kind of ER fluid we need to develop.'' Today, in 
order to pursue ER fluid development smoothly, one needs to (1) 
list possible applications for currently available ER fluids, 
and (2) roughly outline the specifications for an ER fluid 
required by each application. Such an attempt has already been 
initiated by the Special Research Group for ER Fluids and Their 
Applications of the Machine Element Lubrication Design Section 
of the Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers. The Special 
Research Group is expected to compile a report no earlier than 
March 1994, when the Group is to be disbanded.

  [Text] In FY94 the STA's National Aerospace Laboratory 
(Director, Kazuaki Takashima) will start developing a 
world-class, high-temperature shock wave wind tunnel which can 
create temperatures of 10,000 degrees C as well as hypersonic 
speeds of Mach 10-20. The plan is to create an environment as 
close as possible to that of atmospheric re-entry, essential for 
R&amp;D on the ``HOPE'' space shuttle and manned ``spaceplane.'' 
The 
new wind tunnel will make it possible to ascertain the micro 
phenomena of ionization and atomic state collision against 
airframes when atmospheric air is compressed under shock waves. 
The design phase is scheduled to start in FY94 and construction 
will be completed in 3 years at NAL's Kakuda Research Center. 
Japan's ``extraterrestrial'' research system will be established 
with the completion of the new wind tunnel. 
  For space shuttles such as the HOPE to re-enter the 
atmosphere and return to the earth, it is essential to develop 
structural materials and heat-resistant materials able to endure 
shock wave compression of several thousand atmospheres and 
atmospheric frictional heat. To solve these problems, NAL has 
been developing various kinds of wind tunnels. However, this is 
their first high-temperature, high-speed shock wave tunnel. 
  Only a handful are available in the world, namely Germany's 
HEG, Australia's T-3 and T-4, and the U.S. Calspan96HST. NAL's 
wind tunnel will be superior in performance to those existing 
wind tunnels. For example, a wind force of 4-8km/second and 
temperatures in the range of 3,500-10,000 degrees C will be 
produced. Impulsive force will reach 2,000 atmospheres. The wind 
tunnel is capable of testing under the molecular dissociation 
phenomenon which occurs at high temperatures (oxygen dissociates 
when the temperature goes above 2,200 degrees C, nitrogen, above 
6,000 degrees C), and the ionization (above 8,000 degrees C) 
phenomenon. The wind tunnel is 80 meters long, the compressor 
tube is 45 meters long, and the shock wave tube is 20 meters 
long. The measurement section measures 1.2 meters. The testing 
time is 2 milliseconds. 
  In order to generate a shock wave, first compressed air is 
discharged from a high-pressure gas storage vessel at 300 
meters/second. Next, helium gas in the pressure tube is led to 
the shock wave tube at 2,500 atmospheres and 3,000 degrees C. 
Finally, the gas in the shock wave tube is discharged into the 
measurement section at speeds up to Mach 20. It is a structure 
similar to a three-stage water pistol. Much attention is being 
paid to the new wind tunnel which can produce data from actual 
tests that cannot be obtained through simulation.

  [Text] The National Space Development Agency (NASDA, 
Director, Masato Yamano) has completed the design of two 
experimental vehicles, the ``hypersonic flight experiment'' 
(HYFLEX) and the ``automatic landing flight experiment'' 
(ALFLEX). Both represent progress toward future development of 
an operational space shuttle system, the ``unmanned space 
shuttle'' (HOPE), on which NASDA has been conducting R&amp;D. The 
production stage will begin in April. Two primary contractors, 
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. (in charge of HYFLEX) and 
Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd. (in charge of ALFLEX), disclosed 
that construction of both vehicles is scheduled to be completed 
by spring 1996 and delivered to NASDA. 
  Both experimental vehicles are intended for future 
development of the operational HOPE which is scheduled for 
launch in the early 21st century. The HOPE is an unmanned space 
shuttle, which under the space transportation system will serve 
as a carrier of materials from the earth to an international 
space station in earth orbit. After delivering its load, the 
shuttle will leave orbit, re-enter the atmosphere, and return to 
earth. At present, research on conceptual design and basic 
technology for the HOPE is under way. Both HYFLEX and ALFLEX are 
vehicles to examine those technologies. HYFLEX explores whether 
or not stable flight can be maintained at hypersonic speed when 
transporting as well as subsonic speed when returning to earth. 
MHI, with the collaboration of their subcontractors, has been 
conducting development and design in the areas of materials 
which can endure high temperatures during atmospheric re-entry 
and the shape of airframes which can maintain stable flight at a 
wide range of sonic velocities. 
  ALFLEX, on the other hand, is aimed at developing a system 
that will make unmanned flights from atmospheric re-entry to 
landing at a designated place. KHI has focused most of its 
development and design effort on automatic flight systems such 
as those that employ microwave guidance devices to precisely 
control flight through integrated processing and control of 
signals sent by navigation sensors using on-board computers. The 
development cost is approximately &yen;5 billion for each 
experimental vehicle, for a total of &yen;10 billion. 
  Both companies have completed verification and design on 
paper for both experimental vehicles, and therefore have moved 
on to production. HYFLEX is scheduled to be produced at MHI's 
Nagoya Aerospace System Works and ALFLEX, at KHI's Gifu Plant. 
NASDA plans to put the HYFLEX, after delivery is made by MHI, 
aboard the J-1 rocket scheduled for launch during the summer of 
1996 and fly the ALFLEX in the fall of 1996 to evaluate their 
performance.

  [Text] In the absence of gravity, many interesting 
phenomena arise. 
  Water and oil mix, for example, and a candle flame takes on 
a 
spherical shape. The obvious place to investigate such things is 
in the microgravity environment of space. Unfortunately, that is 
still an extremely expensive ``laboratory'' where few have the 
privilege to work. 
  One alternative is to conduct microgravity experiments on 
earth, taking advantage of the fact that the force of gravity 
approaches zero as an object accelerates downward. 
  In Japan, an abandoned coal mine shaft in Kamisunagawa, 
Hokkaido, has been transformed into a state-of-the art facility 
for microgravity experiments providing an unprecedented 10 
seconds of free-fall time. That is twice the duration of similar 
facilities run by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration (NASA) and the University of Bremen in Germany. 
  The successful completion of the Kamisunagawa microgravity 
experiment facility just slightly behind schedule in 1991 is the 
story of clever engineers meeting challenges as they appear. 
  The Ministry of International Trade and Industry launched 
the 
microgravity project in 1987, handing over management to the 
Agency of Industrial Science and Technology. Construction began 
in 1988, carried out by a consortium of four companies: 
Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co., Mitsui Engineering 
&amp; 
Shipbuilding Co., Mitsui Construction Co., and Toshiba Corp. 
<H5>  Overcoming Resistance </H5>
  The vertical shaft at Kamisunagawa is 710 meters deep, or 
twice the height of the Tokyo Tower. The bottom 220m of the 
shaft is equipped with an air control system, an hydraulic brake 
and an emergency stopping system. The rest of the shaft is 
available for free-fall experiments. At 490m, this is long 
enough to provide 10 seconds of time where objects experience 
one-ten-thousandth the gravity they would on the surface of the 
earth. 
  The experiments themselves are carried out inside a large 
bullet-shaped capsule which weighs 7.5 metric tons, and measures 
1.8m in diameter and 7.8m in length. 
  The capsule is not just dropped down the shaft, but shot 
down 
like a rocket. Moreover, it is not simply a matter of propelling 
a capsule down a hole in the ground. Numerous technologies had 
to be developed to speed the capsule down in a controlled manner 
that wouldn't disturb the experiments within. 
  In the free-fall facilities at NASA and Bremen University, 
the test capsule is dropped down an evacuated shaft, so air 
resistance is not a problem. But at four-times the length, it is 
far more difficult to create a vacuum at the Kamisunagawa test 
facility. Instead, the capsule must be propelled downward with 
enough force to overcome air resistance. 
  The original design called for the use of a superconducting 
maglev system, but that idea was scrapped in June of 1988 
because of cost and technical considerations. ``They told us to 
come up with an alternative by September, and we were frantic,'' 
recalls Shigeaki Oobayashi, deputy general manager of 
Ishikawajima-Harima's new business planning and promotion 
department. 
  The alternative they came up with was a type of cold-gas 
thruster system, similar to that used to control satellites in 
space. Since air resistance changes with time as the capsule 
drops, the engineers ended up placing 18 thrusters on the 
capsule, each capable of turning on and off as the occasion 
arises to ensure smooth control of the speed of the capsule. 
  Being an abandoned mine shaft, a variety of hooks, 
horizontal 
shafts and other objects remain in place. All these objects 
disrupt the air flow and make it extremely difficult to analyze 
the aerodynamics of the shaft. ``We didn't have the luxury of 
being able to make armchair calculations. It was a constant 
process of trial and error,'' Oobayashi explains. 
  To shield the experimental equipment from the vibrations of 
this ``rocket,'' the capsule is actually a pair of nested 
capsules, separated by an evacuated chamber. An extremely 
delicate balance must be maintained at all times between these 
two capsules: they must drop at exactly the same speed because 
any contact would disturb the microgravity environment of the 
inner chamber.

  [Text] Ishikawajima Harima Heavy Industries, Ltd. 
(President, Kosaku Inaba) has disclosed that they have been 
negotiating with a major French space engine manufacturer, 
Societe Europeene Propulsione (SEP, HQS in Le Ariane) Company, 
for export of the bearing cage used for the H-2 rocket engine's 
liquid hydrogen turbopump. The H-2 was launched successfully by 
Japan. At SEP's request, IHI has already shipped samples at 
cost. At present, SEP is conducting its technical evaluation. If 
this deal is successful, it will constitute Japan's first 
home-developed export in the field of space rocket components. 
  The bearing cage is the heart of the rocket engine supply 
system, which plays a supporting role in light-weight, 
high-horsepower, high-thrust turbo engines. 
  The cage was developed by IHI in cooperation with the 
National Space Development Agency (NASDA) and the National 
Aerospace Laboratory (NAL). Its value was verified during the 
successful H-2 rocket launch. It proved extremely durable and 
strong under the most severe environments, and demonstrated 
lubricity at temperatures even 250 degrees C below 0. The life 
span of the cage can be lengthened by using glass fiber 
reinforced composite material for the base material. The glass 
fiber on the surface was removed to an appropriate depth through 
melting in order to bring the steel ball and lubricating 
material into smoother contact. 
  SEP, which is in charge of a portion of production of the 
large ``Ariane'' rocket run by the European Union (EU), had 
maintained contact with IHI and showed special interest in the 
processing technology for the bearing cage since its R&amp;D 
stage. 
IHI held discussions with the Ministry of International Trade 
and Industry to be sure the cage will be limited to peaceful 
purposes, and concluded that its export will create no problems. 
Based on specifications and drawing prepared by SEP, IHI 
produced and delivered 20 sample bearing cages with the property 
test reports. SEP paid approximately &yen;20 million to cover 
the cost. SEP is currently in the process of re-examining the 
samples based on these test reports. 
  If this business deal goes through, 100 units per order, 
depending on European rocket launch schedules, are expected to 
be made. If the samples are acceptable for use, SEP is expected 
to install them aboard the ``Ariane-5'' which is scheduled for 
launch beginning in 1996.

  [Text] ``No fancy ideas. Just the execution of rock-bottom 
rationalization and the promotion of a shift toward commercial 
business...'' So commented Yutaka Hineno, a managing director 
and the general manager, the Aircraft and Special Vehicle 
division, talking about the difficulties of their 
defense-related business. The sales to the Defense Agency in 
FY92, which normally amount to about 80% of said 
division's 
total sales, drastically reduced due to the defence budget cut 
caused by the end of the Cold War, resulting in a two digit drop 
for the first time in four years. 
<H5>  Shrinking Pie </H5>
  A budget cut of 580 billion was decided last year for the 
current Mid-Term Defense Program (FY91-95) which was started 
with a total budget of &yen;22,750 billion. It was a downward 
adjustment implemented one year earlier of the schedule. Such an 
adjustment was more or less expected by defense-related 
companies. The real test is what is going to be announced in the 
next Mid-Term Defense Program, whose preparation starts next 
year. Shigeru Hatakeyama, the administrative vice-minister, 
describing the difficulty in having the budget proposal 
approved, comments, ``I have been explaining to the Ministry of 
Finance that the defense budget is stiff and stark and there is 
very little left to be shaven off. But they insist that, if 
that's the case, we should reduce the number of airplanes and 
ships to lessen the burdens of the later years of the term; I 
feel that they are not ready to give us a break yet.'' 
  As if there haven't been enough problems, the government's 
intention to increase the purchase of U.S. made equipment, not 
just because of the traditional dependency on the U.S. 
technology, but also because of its desire to improve the trade 
friction with the U.S., is becoming more conspicuous these days, 
so that the Japanese defense manufacturers may have to face a 
more difficult time in the future as they have to share the 
shrinking pie. 
  Hineno himself admits that ``the orders of tanks and 
fighters 
have reduced considerably already, and will continue to do so 
toward FY97.'' Even after that, they'll have to depend on an 
uncertain prospect that the next generation support fighter FSX, 
which is being developed, and the next generation small 
observation and reconnaissance helicopter OHX will enter the 
production periods. 
<H5>  Defense Agency Appreciates </H5>
  The Defense Agency appreciates Mitsubishi Heavy Industries 
(``MHI'') efforts and asserts, ``We are impressed with MHI's 
solid quality and technology, but also their pride and strong 
sense of responsibility as the leader of the defense industry.'' 
This confidence is shown in the delivery record; the equipment 
contract for this company for FY92 was &yen;339.3 billion 
(market share: 24.5%), a whopping lead over the second 
place 
Kawasaki Heavy Industries's &yen;113.3 billion (8.2|). 
  However, the fact that they are the giant means also that 
they will be hurt most by the defense budget cut. In the mean 
time, the focus of the technological innovation is shifting 
toward the software industry linked with electronics technology, 
as was evidenced in the ``Patriot'' missile in the Gulf War. 
Hineno avows that, ``The basis of our division is the defense 
business. The technology will keep improving itself, so that we 
will do our best to sustain and improve our defense-related 
basic technology even if it means a lot of pain to us.'' The 
Defense Agency's top brass coincide by saying, ``We know that 
the situation is not easy for them, but MHI fully understands 
that once they lose control of R&amp;D, which is the basis of the 
defense business, it would be difficult to reconstruct it.'' 
<H5>  Commercial Business is the Key </H5>
  The only key to solve this bind is the commercial business. 
The plan is to double the commercial sales to &yen;100 billion 
by FY97, while preserving the defense technology. 
  The defense business has been allowed to add up the cost 
under the Defense Agency's auditing, and they have been 
guaranteed of a certain profit unless they make an exorbitant 
error. This practice has caused this division to lose sight of a 
sharp cost awareness. ``The defense division has been treated as 
a sacred area so far, but no more. From now on, cost reduction 
shall be the top priority for them, regardless of the fact 
whether we are asked to do so by the Defense Agency or not,'' 
declares Kentaro Aikawa, the president. We heard a doubt whether 
the technologies generated in the defense business can be 
smoothly converted into the commercial business or not, because 
the cost is the top priority in the commercial business, while 
the performance of the product is the top priority. 
  As the cost reduction measures, they are already increasing 
the ratio of imported parts, rationalizing the production lines, 
and reviewing the ratio of the direct/non-direct departments. 
Also, they are evaluating the possibility of applying the 
research and production technologies generated for the missile 
guidance electronics to commercial uses. Although it is certain 
that these countermeasures won't have any impact on immediate 
terms, the slowdown in the defense business provides them a good 
chance to tighten the belt on the cost factors, and the effort 
of creating new businesses will be helpful in restructuring of 
the division. The defense division, which has always been the 
core of the company, in parallel with the prime mover division, 
is now at a major turning point.

  [Text] ``Not just because of an outlook that this depressed 
condition of defense spending will continue for sometime, it is 
essential for the Japanese aircraft industry, for the sake of 
its healthy development, to do away with the present excessive 
dependency on the defense needs, and beef up the commercial 
aircraft business side.'' So says a don of a defense-related 
organization suggesting a future direction the industry should 
take. The total sales of the Japanese aircraft manufacturing 
industry was only about &yen; 200 billion in FY93, negligibly 
small in contrast to those of the U.S. and European countries. 
<H5>  World-class Technology Level </H5>
  This is the aftereffect of the ban on any aircraft 
production 
in Japan ordered by the GHQ for a period of seven years 
following the end of WW-II. During the same period, the world 
aircraft industry entered the jet age, and a remarkable wave of 
evolutions occurred in the aircraft technology. In Japan, all 
the aircraft engineers scattered away in every direction and the 
transfusion of the tradition was held up temporarily during that 
period. 
  Nonetheless, since the restitution of aircraft production in 
1952, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. (``MHI'') has been 
trying to build up its development and manufacturing 
capabilities first through the repairs and overhauls of U.S. 
military airplanes, then gradually through fuselage production 
subcontracts from U.S. manufacturers, and finally the 
development of airplanes on orders from the Defense Agency. Not 
only MHI, but also Kawasaki Heavy Industries and 
Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries (``IHI'') learned new 
techniques and technologies through license productions from the 
U.S. manufacturers and tried to catch up with the rest of the 
world. Boeing's top management commented recently that, ``They 
have reached the world-class level more or less. In certain 
areas, they are even ahead of us,'' referring to the 
manufacturing engineering technology, which is, after all, 
Japan's forte. 
  The development of an airplane takes many years and a huge 
sum of money, particularly if it is a commercial airplane, and 
it is getting out of hands for private enterprises as the risk 
and cost of the development of a commercial airplane have become 
so enormous due to the increase in the size and the 
sophistication of the performance requirement. 
  As a result, international joint development has become a 
standard approach world-wide in order to minimize the 
development risks, and secure and expand the market. In fact, 
Japanese manufacturers are included in the negotiations for the 
development projects of large next generation jet liners and 
supersonic planes. Yutaka Hineno, a managing director and the 
general manager, the Aircraft and Special Vehicle division, 
boasts that his company is ``the world's number one when it 
comes to the fuselage production which includes aerodynamics and 
compound material technology.'' However, for the company which 
wants to be No. 1 in everything, the achilles heel of their 
aircraft production business is the engine. 
  A high ranking person of the Defense Agency said, ``Pratt 
&amp; 
Whitney, General Electric and Rolls Royce are the `Yokozuna 
(grand champions of Sumo wrestling),' and Snecma [phonetic] of 
France is an 'Ozeki (second ranking in the senior grade).' IHI, 
the Yokozuna of Japan, is probably considered a 'Maegashira 
(fifth ranking in the senior grade)' in the world ring. That 
means that MHI should probably be considered a Jyo-nidan (the 
second from the bottom of the junior grade).'' The basic 
principle of the jet engine hasn't changed for the last 50 to 60 
years. In other words, there hasn't been any technological 
breakthrough, but rather, it has been a slow process of 
evolution accumulating improvements bit by bit; therefore, the 
experience is what really counts in this area. ``It is an area 
where it is extremely difficult to catch up and surpass the 
forerunner overnight,'' according to the same person in the 
Defense Agency. 
  Hineno, upon hearing this allusive analysis, grinned and 
said, ``it is a bit too harsh for anyone to call us a Jyo-nidan, 
but we hope to join the senior grade and be able to compete with 
IHI, though san-yaku (yokozuna, ozeki and sekiwake) are out of 
reach for the time being.'' MHI chose the fuselage when 
reentering the aircraft business after WW-II, as they figured it 
was too much to pursue both the engine and the fuselage. Under 
the government's administrative guidance, it was IHI's destiny 
to find a way to become a manufacturer dedicated to the engine 
since then. 
<H5>  Expectation on YSX </H5>
  As to the future direction, Hinone stressed that, ``It has 
been agreed that our share will be increased from 5% to 
10% in 
a large engine joint development project with P&amp;W; in 
addition, 
we are hoping to be involved in the subassembly developments 
through an enhancement of our alliance with them. Also, since we 
believe that we are a part of the world-class san-yaku when it 
comes to small engine technologies, we will seek a leading role 
in the specific field based on our unique and superior 
technologies,'' suggesting that they will be after a two-tier 
policy of developing small engines as well as large engines. 
However, the scale of their commercial aircraft business is only 
a little over &yen;40 billion, or slightly less than 10% 
of the 
Aircraft and Special Vehicle division. In addition, the sharp 
yen appreciation in the recent months has caused them a 
substantial foreign exchange loss, so that a spokesman admits 
that the business is ``not necessary in red, but it is quite 
tough to make any money.'' Nonetheless, a substantial market 
growth is expected for them so that its importance is undeniable 
while the defense business is shrinking. It is quite interesting 
to see what happens in the small jetliner ``YSX'' (seating 75 
passengers) development project in which Japan is assuming the 
leadership asking overseas manufacturers to participate in the 
project, as MHI is expected to assume the leader company's role 
in the project.

<F P=106> [Article by Akihiko Tanaka, staff writer] </F>
  [Text] Technology for recycling auto parts -- leading 
environmental polluters -- has been nudged forward with the 
development of a new method for completely removing paint from 
used car bumpers. 
  Superficial as it sounds, paint removal is not something 
``green'' technology can afford to gloss over. 
  Any impurities left on polypropylene bumpers -- the primary 
kind used in Japan -- weakens the strength of the recycled 
product. At best, tinted bumpers can expect to come back to life 
as foot rests or spare-tire buckets. 
  Hence the importance of the new method developed jointly by 
Nissan Motor Co. and Mitsui Petrochemical Industries Ltd. 
  While all the major automakers have been working to develop 
recycling technology, Nissan claims it is the first to achieve 
100 percent paint removal. Nissan's method combines the use of 
an alkaline solvent with hulling technology derived from rice 
polishing. 
  First, used bumpers retrieved by Nissan-affiliated 
dealerships are sent to Mitsui Petrochemical to be crushed. The 
resulting mass is then immersed in a hot alkaline solution where 
polyester contained in the molecular structure of the paint is 
dissolved. To remove the final traces of primer, force is 
applied to the surface using the hulling technology. Other 
materials are carefully removed by filtration. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-14A>      FIGURE </FIG>

  As well as completely removing paint, this technique has the 
advantage over existing methods of being able to process bumpers 
made by other automakers and is lower in cost. 
  There are three other bumper-paint removal techniques: a 
hydrolysis method that uses pressure and high temperature, a 
compressed vibration method and the ``cyclone'' method. 
  The hydrolysis method was developed jointly by Toyota Motor 
Corp. and Toyota Central Research &amp; Development Laboratories 
Inc. In this procedure, the paint is chemically decomposed to 
form a gel, which is then fused and mixed. Hydrolysis has proved 
effective for engineering plastics with heat plasticity, but is 
difficult to use on products made by other manufacturers. What's 
more, the physical properties of the resulting products are 
reportedly inferior to those made using the Nissan technology. 
  The compressed vibration method is used by the Gifu research 
center of Ein Co. BMW Japan Corp. began recycling used cars in 
January, and is entrusting all of its bumper recycling to Ein. 
Ein's method removes 99.4 percent of the paint, but it is rather 
expensive and Japanese automakers have shied away from it. 
  The cyclone method is currently being developed by Sumitomo 
Chemical Co. This technology involves pulverizing the paint into 
units several hundred microns in size. The drawback is that it 
wastes a lot of energy and is also very expensive. 
  Even with its advantages, Nissan's technology is not 
problem-free. Profitability remains the biggest obstacle to be 
cleared. 
  At present, Nissan is using the technology to recycle only 
about 2 tons of bumpers every month, most of which are used as 
replacement bumpers for the firm's Bluebird models. The company 
reportedly needs to process about 500 tons per month to make the 
exercise profitable. For that reason, Nissan is seeking the 
cooperation of other automakers. 
  Despite the technological successes, there is still much 
ground to be made in recycling auto parts. Reprocessed bumpers 
still amount to only a drop in the bucket compared with the 
total number discarded. And while it is possible to recover used 
bumpers from dealers, there are no established channels for 
recovering heavier parts.

Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co.] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  The 1990 mid-term report of the Electric Power Industry 
Council's Supply and Demand Section says that the current power 
situation is heading toward the actualization of conditions that 
will put constraints on electric power supply and demand. 
Fearing future critical supply-and-demand stringencies if the 
situation continues as is, the report points to the introduction 
of 5,700,000 kW of electricity by 2010 from distributed sources 
centering around new energies. In this scenario, there is 
progress in the development of fuel cells, which are noted for 
being the fourth kind of electric power generation. In 
particular, there are great expectations for molten carbonate 
fuel cells (MCFCs). 
  MCFCs are now at a level where 100-kW batteries are being 
tested. The development of fuel cells requires technologies that 
have to do with carbonate chemistry, high-temperature 
structures, heat transfer and flow, electrochemistry, and metal 
and ceramic materials. This article, however, as a special 
article on liquid chemistry, introduces the principles of fuel 
cells, centering on the technology used in dealing with MCFC 
liquids, and the state of MCFC development at 
Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries. 
<H5>  2. MCFC Features </H5>
  The most important features of fuel cells are their high 
efficiency and that they are environmentally clean. 
  As with thermal power generation, fuel cells use fossil 
fuels, but in contrast to thermal power generation, which 
produces electrical energy by burning fuel to move thermal 
machinery, fuel cells convert the chemical energy of the fuel 
directly into electrical energy in an electrochemical reaction. 
For that reason fuel cells are not subject to Carnot efficiency 
limits, and, ideally, all of the free energy conversion in the 
reaction can be converted into work. The energy that can be 
converted into work by the reaction of the fuel and oxygen is 
very high -- about 80% of the energy produced by 
combustion. 
When current is produced with a fuel cell, the efficiency drops 
because of the loss due to the internal resistance, gas 
diffusion, and so forth, but even so a high power generation 
efficiency of 40-60% is obtained with a fuel cell. 
Furthermore, 
because the 700ÎC heat discharge from an MCFC can be 
utilized, the use of MCFCs in urban cogeneration (heat and 
electricity supply) systems is anticipated. In that case, the 
overall thermal efficiency can be raised to 80%. 
  Because fuel cells do not burn fuel, they generate hardly 
any 
of the atmospheric pollutants, such as oxides of nitrogens, that 
are produced when fuel is burned at high temperatures. In 
addition, by using the water that results from fuel-cell power 
generation, systems that consume hardly any water can be set up. 
Furthermore, fuel cells are not moving machines, like turbines, 
so they generate little noise. That fact points to why fuel-cell 
power plants are not subject to site restrictions in urban areas. 
<H5>  3. Principles of an MCFC </H5>
<H5>  3.1 Basic Electrode Reaction </H5>
  When two electrodes are placed in water (the electrolyte) 
and 
a current flows between them, the electrolysis reaction results 
in the generation of hydrogen gas from one electrode and oxygen 
gas from the other. In a fuel cell, however, by having the 
reaction gases flow to the electrodes instead, direct current is 
generated between the electrodes. The fuel cell will continue to 
generate power as long as the reaction gas continues to be 
supplied. Figure 1 shows the principles of an MCFC. By supplying 
oxygen (air) and carbon dioxide in the cathode (air electrode) 
passage, an electrochemical reaction occurs at the cathode and 
carbonate ions form in the electrolyte. On the other hand, fuel 
supplied in the anode (the fuel electrode) passage undergoes an 
electrochemical reaction with the carbonate ions in the 
electrolyte to produce water vapor and carbon dioxide. Supplying 
the carbon dioxide produced at the anode to the cathode side 
results in an overall reaction in which the fuel and oxygen 
react to form water and carbon dioxide gas. At that time, a 
potential difference occurs between the cathode and anode, fuel 
and oxygen are consumed in the electrochemical reaction, and 
power is generated. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-16A>      Figure 1. Principles of an MCFC </FIG>


<H5>  3.2 Basic Structure of the Fuel Cell </H5>
  Figure 2 shows the basic structure of the fuel cell. The 
main 
structural components are the anode, cathode, electrolytic plate 
(also called a tile, it is a porous ceramic soaked with 
electrolyte), and a separator. This one set is called a single 
cell. The electrolytic plate is between two separators that use 
gas seals, called wet seals, which increase the liquid-retaining 
power in a wet state. We set up a device that squeezes the 
layered cells all together so that the wet seal and the 
components make good contact with each other. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-16C>      Figure 2. Basic Structure of the Fuel Cell </FIG>


  Table 1 gives the specifications for the main components. 
Next, I will point out the features of each component.

<H5>  3.2.1 The Electrodes </H5>
  The anode is a sintered compact of nickel powder. Because it 
is a porous metal, as shown in Figure 3, creep at high 
temperatures and changes in the fine structure due to the 
sintering become problems. However, we added Cr and Al to 
prevent creep and got a good electrode that changes very little 
over time. The cathode is a porous sintered plate of nickel 
oxide. The conductivity of the material holds up sufficiently 
during use because we doped it with lithium. When the partial 
pressure of the carbon dioxide increases in the cathode gas 
atmosphere, the cathode solves out into the electrolytic plate, 
which in turn can cause an electrical short between the anode 
and cathode. To keep that from happening, we added a third 
substance to decrease the solubility of the material's surface; 
during operation, the fuel cell is run with the carbon dioxide's 
partial pressure lowered. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-16D>      Figure 3. Microscopic Photograph of Anode </FIG>


<H5>  3.2.2 The Electrolytic Plate </H5>
  The electrolytic plate is a porous sheet made of 
LiAlO[.sub]2[/] powder (the electrolyte-retaining material) 
that is soaked with a dissolved carbonate, which is the 
electrolyte. Li[.sub]2[/]CO[.sub]3[/] and 
K[.sub]2[/]CO[.sub]3[/], both of which have a melting 
point of about 490ÎC, are mainly used for the carbonate. In 
order to prevent combustion that is caused by air and fuel 
mixing in the cell and to keep the reaction gases from leaking 
outside of the cell, we made the pores of the electrolytic plate 
between the cathode and anode small, i.e., with sub-micron 
diameters, and increased the liquid-retaining power of the plate 
by means of capillary tube forces so that the pores are almost 
completely filled with electrolyte. While the electrolytic plate 
is ceramic, metal is used for the separator material. During 
heat cycling, cracks due to the thermal stress appeared in the 
electrolytic plate. To solve that, however, we increased the 
strength by mixing coarse particles and fiber into the 
electrolytic plate. The stability of the LiAlO[.sub]2[/] 
powder when it is soaked with electrolyte, which was an issue, 
is improved by controlling the surface properties of the powder 
and the phase state of the material. 
<H5>  3.2.3 The Separator </H5>
  The separator plays three roles: it separates the cathode 
gas 
from the anode gas, supplies reaction gases to all of the 
electrode surfaces, and acts as a conductor that connects the 
layers of cells. Because a molten salt is used, the surface of 
the wet seal that is wet with electrolyte and the anode passage 
are in a severely corrosive environment. For the wet seal, we 
can keep the corrosion down to a permissible range by 
aluminizing it. Of the various aluminizing methods, slurry 
coating, plating, and flame coating are methods that can be used 
for large-scale separators. The metals used in the passages and 
the diaphragm must exhibit corrosion resistance in both the 
atmospheres on the anode and cathode sides. We solved the 
corrosion problem by using nickel on the anode side and 
copper-clad stainless steel on the cathode side. 
<H5>  3.3 Electrolyte Liquid Control Technique </H5>
  A layered body of materials with different pore diameters 
achieves a balance of forces due to the capillary tube forces, 
as shown in Figure 4. The relation describing that balance in 
the fuel cell is 
<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-17A>      Equation </FIG>

  where p is the gas pressure, d is the pore diameter, _s_ 
is 
the surface tension, _r_ is the electrolyte density, h is the 
height of the liquid, _th_ is the leakage angle, a indicates 
the 
anode side, and c indicates the cathode side. A porous material 
has a pore diameter distribution, and a typical fine structure 
consisting of the basic components of the fuel cell, i.e., the 
anode, cathode, and electrolytic plate, is like that shown in 
Figure 5. The electrolyte liquid soaks in from where the pore 
diameters are small to the diameter that corresponds to the 
filling amount, then the parts where the pore diameters are 
larger than that become a gas space and do not fill up with 
electrolyte. This balance arises even in layers of porous 
materials. Figure 6 is a conceptual diagram of electrolyte 
soaking states. The electrode reaction occurs between the 
reaction gases, ions, and electrons. To bring out the 
performance of the fuel cell, the appropriate amount of 
electrolyte must soak into the electrode vacancy areas that are 
porous, and three interfaces -- between the reaction gases, the 
electron-conducting electrodes, and the ion-conducting 
electrolyte -- must form adequately. In addition, because the 
electrolyte dissipates due to leakage, corrosion, and 
vaporization during operation, the amount of that dissipation 
must be taken into account when initially filling the electrodes 
with electrolyte. The fine structure of the electrodes and the 
electrolytic plate and the amount of electrolyte are determined 
in such a way that as those functions are fulfilled.

<H5>   4. State of Development, and Topics </H5>
<H5>  4.1 Power Generation Characteristics </H5>
  Like dry batteries, the lower the voltage obtained from a 
fuel cell, the larger the current that is produced. The voltage 
increases along with an increase in the process gas pressure, so 
higher efficiency and more compact piping are considered in 
planning the operation of large-scale power plants under 
pressurized conditions. Figure 7 shows the performance of a 
10-kW stack under pressure; the stack consists of 10 layers of 
cells with 1-m[.sup]2[/] electrodes. An output of 12 kW is 
obtained with an operating pressure of 7 atmospheres and a load 
current of 1500 A. As for larger-scale fuel cells, we are now 
testing the kind of 100-kW fuel cell shown in Figure 8, which 
has 50 1-m[.sup]2[/] cell layers above and below an 
intermediate holder. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-18B>      Figure 7. Characteristics of 1-m[.sup]2[/] X 10 Cell </FIG>


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-18C>      Figure 8. 100-kW Fuel Cell </FIG>


  A fuel cell lifetime ranging from 25,000 hours to 40,000 
hours, depending on the system, is said to be cost effective. 
Now, 10,000 hours of operation can be had with a kW-class fuel 
cell stack, which offsets the cost by just a hair's breadth. 
Figure 9 shows the relationship between the rate of a fuel 
cell's deterioration and the amount of electrolyte dissipation. 
The amount of electrolyte dissipation needs to be reduced 
further to lengthen the lifetime of fuel cells. We are pouring 
our effort into increasing the carbonate-retaining power by 
reducing the average pore diameters in the fine structure of the 
electrolytic plate, and preventing carbonate loss by reducing 
the separator's wet area. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-18D>      Figure 9. Amount of Electrolyte Dissipation and </FIG>


<H5>  4.2 Production Techniques </H5>
  At first we produced the electrolytic plate by mixing the 
retaining material powder with the electrolyte powder, then 
putting that into a mold and pressing it at a temperature very 
close to that of the electrolyte's melting point. With the 
hot-press method, however, larger-scale plates were difficult to 
make. Now we make the electrolytic plates by means of a 
tape-forming method with a doctor blade, which is used in making 
ceramic sheets. The doctor blade method is a way of using a 
doctor blade to thinly coat a film with a slurry consisting of 
the material powder mixed with a solvent, binding agent, and a 
dispersing agent to get the appropriate viscosity. The doctor 
blade method makes possible the production of large-scale, thin, 
uniform electrolytic plates by means of a tape-forming device. 
(The tape made by the tape forming is called a green tape.) Now, 
1-m[.sup]2[/]-class electrolytic plates are formed 
continuously. The electrodes are made by the same method, but, 
the electrodes are baked before they are incorporated into the 
fuel cell whereas the electrolytic plate is left as a tape. 
  The component parts of the separator are made from a thin 
plate, the objective of which is to make them all compact, but 
the number of parts is large and the processing is difficult. We 
are now investigating separators that are press-formed from thin 
plates, which may enable mass production. 
<H5>  5. Conclusion </H5>
  Under the New Sunshine Project, we were commissioned by the 
New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization 
(NEDO) to develop an MCFC. We are now at the stage of testing a 
100-kW MCFC. In parallel with that effort, we are aiming for 
commercialization in our research to develop lower-cost 
separators and our investigations of a MW-class plant as an MCFC 
demonstration plant after the 100-kW tests conclude. The 
American Public Power Association in the U.S. also chose the 
MCFC from the various types of fuel cells, and the Energy 
Research Corporation has embarked on the development of a 2-MW 
MCFC. In Europe, too, development efforts have gained momentum. 
  We want to work toward reliability improvements and cost 
reduction in order to put the MCFC out in the world. Look 
forward to future developments.

  [Text] A research group led by Yoshihiro Hamagawa at Osaka 
University's Basic Engineering Department achieved a 
photoelectric transfer efficiency of 21%, the highest in 
the 
world, with a tandem-type solar cell made with layers of 
amorphous (non-crystalline) silicon and polycrystalline silicon. 
The researchers tinkered with the thickness of the 
power-generating layer, among other things, to increase the 
typical transfer efficiency by 0.7%. Having achieved an 
efficiency on par with that of single-crystal silicon, the 
group's tandem-type solar cell made with two types of relatively 
cheap silicon was a step toward making solar cells practical. 
  The group consists of Professor Yoshihiro Hamagawa,

Ma. The solar cell is a 5-mm[.sup]2[/] so-called tandem type 
of solar cell that has a power-generating layer of amorphous 
silicon on top of a power-generating layer of polycrystalline 
silicon. 
  The tandem-type solar cell can convert sunlight into 
electricity more efficiently than single-layer solar cells 
because the light that the amorphous layer cannot absorb is 
absorbed by the polycrystalline layer. 
  The research group achieved a transfer efficiency of 
20.3% 
in 1992, but this time they cut the thickness of the amorphous 
layer down to 100 nm, or one-fourth of what it was, so that more 
light can reach the lower polycrystalline layer. Even if the 
amorphous layer is thinner, its photoelectric transfer 
efficiency does not change. 
  In connection with enlarging the area, Okamoto says, ``Even 
if we make it much larger, we can realize about the same 
efficiency.'' A shortcoming of amorphous silicon is that it 
deteriorates over time, but if the amorphous layer is thin, 
deterioration becomes less of a worry. 
  Because Osaka University's tandem-type solar cell is made of 
amorphous silicon and polycrystalline silicon, it can be 
produced at a temperature around 250ÎC. The production is 
simple, too -- each substance is just crystallized into a layer. 
  Other solar cells such as those made of single-crystal 
silicon are more expensive because a high temperature close to 
1,000ÎC is needed to make them, and semiconductor 
fabricating processes are used to achieve high efficiency. ``If 
advances are made in technology for processing a polycrystalline 
layer into a film, close-to-practical tandem-type solar cells 
can be made,'' says Okamoto.

  Using single-crystal silicon, Sharp achieved an efficiency 
of 
22% with a 2-cm[.sup]2[/] solar cell, and 21% with a 
practical-sized 4-cm X 6-cm cell. A group at Australia's New 
South Wales University also achieved 23.1% with a 
2-cm[.sup]2[/] solar cell, but the fabrication process they 
use is complex. Sanyo Electric holds the record for amorphous 
silicon, 12% with a 10-cm[.sup]2[/] solar cell, and Kyocera 
holds the record for polycrystalline silicon, 16.4% with a 
15-cm[.sup]2[/] solar cell, but those efficiencies are not as 
high as that obtained with single-crystal silicon.

  [Text] On 25 January the AIST announced that ``HYCOL,'' a 
Japanese-made coal gasification test furnace, had reached 1,000 
hours of continuous operation. HYCOL is a new furnace that the 
New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization 
(NEDO) set up as a part of the New Sunshine Project at the 
Coal-Utilizing Hydrogen Production Research Association's 
operations laboratory in Sodegaura City, Chiba Prefecture. The 
furnace, which first went into operation on 14 December 1993, 
attained the record 1,000 hours of continuous operation that 
indicates good prospects for its practical application. 
  The new furnace processes 50 tons of coal per day to make 
90,000 cubic meters of gas. The gas is 32% hydrogen, 
59% 
carbon monoxide, and 9% carbon dioxide. The gas 
efficiency, 
which indicates how much coal energy is taken out as gas energy, 
is 75%. There are good prospects that with future 
improvements 
the furnace's efficiency can reach 78%. 
  Coal gasification furnaces, which produce fuel gas from 
coal, 
are attracting attention as a technology for using coal, an 
abundant resource, for low-polluting, high-efficiency electric 
power generation by means of fuel cells and the like. However, 
long-term continuous operation of coal gasification furnaces has 
been difficult because ash contained within the coal sticks to 
the furnace. That weak point of coal gasification furnaces was 
solved in the new furnace: the ash in the coal is turned into 
glass-like molten ash (slag) that is removed from the furnace. 
  A coal gasification furnace produces hydrogen gas and carbon 
monoxide from coal by mixing coal particles with a small amount 
of oxygen and then incompletely burning that mixture to break 
the carbon-hydrogen bonds and the carbon-carbon bonds that keep 
coal solid. The new furnace gasifies coal at a higher rate 
because of the special way the coal particles circle around the 
furnace. In addition, the new furnace has a feature that was 
contrived independently in Japan: burners that bring the coal 
particles and oxygen into the furnace are attached to the top 
and bottom of the furnace. 
  Coal gasification furnace technologies, such as those based 
on Texaco's method, Shell's method, and Dow's method, were 
developed overseas long before. In comparison, though, the AIST 
thinks that the HYCOL is superior to existing technologies in 
terms of gasification efficiency and the range of types of coal 
that it can handle. The AIST will continue on with research to 
make the furnace practical.

  [Text] The New Energy and Industrial Technology Development 
Organization (NEDO) will tackle the development of a 
high-performance industrial furnace and boiler that will consume 
less energy than conventional furnaces and boilers. NEDO will 
use experimental facilities that produce a phenomenon in which a 
micro-gravity environment, like that in outer space, is obtained 
when objects fall naturally, and will elucidate the basic 
mechanisms of combustion to design the high-performance 
industrial furnace and boiler. NEDO will receive grants from 
MITI and plans to invest &yen;5 billion in a seven-year effort 
starting this fiscal year. The goals are to improve upon the 
thermal efficiency of present-day industrial furnaces and 
boilers by 30% and 5%, respectively. 
  Heating furnaces, heat-processing furnaces, aluminum-melting 
furnaces, and other such industrial furnaces used today account 
for about 15% of the total energy consumption in Japan. 
Reducing that energy consumption is also viewed as important 
from the standpoint of preventing global warming. On the other 
hand, there has come to be brisk research into the details of 
combustion in micro-gravity environments, where buoyancy and 
convection effects are not felt. Consequently, NEDO decided to 
build upon these new research results and develop methods for 
increasing combustion efficiency and reducing harmful exhaust 
gases by controlling the state of the flame within the furnace. 
  The Japan Space Utilization Promotion Center will be 
commissioned to conduct basic experiments on combustion 
phenomena and to develop the control technology. In addition to 
the Hokkaido Kami-sunagawa-machi drop-test facility operated by 
the third-sector Underground Zero-Gravity Experimental Center 
(Sapporo City), NEDO will use Bremen University's drop tower in 
Germany, and France's system that uses airplanes for 
zero-gravity environment experiments. NEDO will also exchange 
information on research results. 
  The Japan Industrial Furnace Society and the Japan Society 
of 
Industrial Machinery Manufacturers will be commissioned to 
develop a test furnace and evaluate its performance. If the 
industrial furnace becomes practical and goes into widespread 
use, a rough calculation shows that it will bring about a 
5% 
reduction in Japan's total energy consumption.

  [Text] Yanmar Diesel Engine Co.'s direct-injection diesel 
engine passed the emissions criterion of the California 
Atmospheric Resources Bureau (CARB) and was approved by CARB. 
The engine keeps emissions down below the CARB standard because 
it has a smaller-diameter injection nozzle and improves the 
manner in which air is mixed with fuel. It is the first time in 
the world that a direct-injection diesel engine, in which fuel 
is directly injected into the cylinder, received approval. 
  The engine that passed the CARB criterion was the company's 
six-horsepower L70A engine, which is an improved version of the 
small, air-cooled L-A series diesel engines (3.5 - 10 
horsepower) that first appeared on the market in 1990. Starting 
with the L-A series engines, by June, Yanmar plans to get 
approval for its upright water-cooled diesel engines and 
mass-produce those that meet the emissions standards. 
  Small, general-purpose engines with less than 25 horsepower 
and engines for landscaping work will be subject to CARB's first 
set of regulations, which will go into effect in January 1995. 
After two years Yanmar aims to change all of its diesel engines 
that are subject to the regulations. The company will also 
tackle more development to deal with the even stricter second 
set of regulations CARB plans to put into effect in 1999.

  [Text] TSUKUBA -- The AIST National Institute for Resources 
and Environment developed a photocatalytic sheet that absorbs 
and decomposes air contaminants using sunlight. By simply 
placing it outdoors, the sheet draws out of the air contaminants 
such as oxides of nitrogen (NO[.sub]x[/]) and oxides of 
sulfur (SO[.sub]x[/]). Without any human intervention or the 
addition of any artificial energy, the action of sunlight 
hitting the sheet gives rise to a photochemical reaction on the 
sheet's surface. Even if the effectiveness of the catalyst 
drops, the sheet's functionality is restored by washing the 
surface. The National Institute for Resources and Environment 
thinks the sheet is suited for use on the outer walls of 
buildings and in preventing noise near freeways. 
  The sheet uses titanium oxide, a catalyst that reacts with 
NO[.sub]x[/] and sulfur dioxide (SO[.sub]2[/]). 
NO[.sub]x[/] can be recovered in the form of nitric acid. To 
prevent the production of nitrogen dioxide during the reaction 
process, the sheet is formed from titanium oxide and activated 
carbon, an absorbent, in which a porous fluororesin is 
dispersed. The ratios of catalyst, activated carbon, and 
fluororesin by weight were 3:1:6. 
  The catalyst can decompose NO[.sub]x[/] if near-infrared 
light hits the sheet with about the same strength of sunlight on 
a cloudy winter day (0.1 mW/cm[.sup]2[/]). The sheet is 
effective for NO[.sub]x[/] concentrations ranging from the 
usual 0.05 PPM in the air to high concentrations near tunnels. 
  The sheet's NO[.sub]x[/] removal rate drops to about half 
after 150 hours of use because nitric acid accumulates on the 
sheet's surface. However, a trial-produced sheet was restored 
back to its original effectiveness by washing it with water, and 
the sheet was all right after dozens of washings. Although trace 
quantities of nitric acid are present in the water after 
washing, it can be detoxified by putting some lime in the path 
of the runoff wash water. As for the titanium oxide, even if it 
is blown around in a strong wind it will not be damaged. 
  The research group roughly estimated that the sheet can 
reduce amounts of NO[.sub]x[/] by about 20% when used in the 
spaces between buildings in the center of a city. In the future, 
the group will research methods of combining materials in forms 
other than sheets, e.g., paints and tiles.

  [Text] Shikoku Research Institute (in Takamatsu City; 
Hirofumi Inoue, director), a subsidiary of Shikoku Electric 
Power Co., is tackling the development of a new 
energy-conservation system that will use large volumes of 
hydrogen gas, which are generated as a by-product in the 
production of sodium hydroxide, in fuel cells. Shikoku Electric 
Power Co. hopes that the use of that hydrogen in fuel cells will 
significantly increase the efficiency of electric power 
generation over that of power generation by burning hydrogen, 
which takes place in the dozens of sodium hydroxide plants 
around Japan. 
  Fuel cells provide a way of producing electricity by means 
of 
a process that is the reverse of water electrolysis. Because 
hydrogen and oxygen are the fuel, fuel cells are expected to 
become the next generation of clean power generation that causes 
very little environmental pollution. 
  The project involves setting up a 100-kW-output phosphate 
fuel cell in a sodium hydroxide plant in Tokushima City in 1994. 
The idea is to raise the power generation efficiency, which is 
now limited to 26% in the boiler systems that burn 
hydrogen, to 
42% or more by 1) recycling the 20% or so of 
hydrogen that is 
discharged from the fuel cell as is, without being reacted, and 
2) by using the 170Î water vapor that is produced during the 
reaction process for energy within the plant. 
  In addition, the equipment needed to produce hydrogen from 
liquefied natural gas (LNG) in the case of typical fuel cells 
can be eliminated. The new concept also has merit in that the 
fuel cell's direct current can be used as is in the electrolysis 
of salt water, the raw material. 
  If it can be demonstrated that the efficiency will increase 
as calculated with the use of that small fuel cell, Shikoku 
Research Institute will conduct studies to see whether or not 
output can be expanded to several thousands of kilowatts, and, 
in the case where all of the hydrogen produced by a plant is 
used, whether or not the system can function well. 
  The total cost of the project is about &yen;439 million. 
About two-thirds of that will come from the government's 
``Energy Conservation Subsidies'' (subsidies to cover the costs 
of developing and making practical technology for rationalizing 
energy usage). ``If we can reduce the per-kilowatt cost of the 
equipment, which is more than five times higher than that of a 
boiler, that will be enough to make the system practical,'' says 
H. Yamamoto, head of the institute's energy research department.

  [Text] On 10 November, Toyota Motor Corp. announced that it 
had developed recycling technology that efficiently separates 
and recovers steel and iron from galvanized steel scrap used in 
automobiles. The technology involves heating galvanized steel 
under a low pressure to vaporize the zinc, which has a low 
boiling point, and then solidifying and recovering it, along 
with obtaining high-purity iron. A facility for the new 
technology, which was jointly developed with Toyokin Co., went 
into operation in October at Toyokin's main plant. The 
facility's processing capacity ranges from 4,000 to 5,000 tons 
per month. This is the first recycling technology of its kind in 
the world. 
  For some time now Toyota has been using the iron scrap of 
pressed edge materials, etc., to produce casted parts 
(in-process recycling). However, because the zinc components in 
the scrap reduce the durability of the melting furnaces used in 
casting, since 1987 Toyota has been removing the zinc by means 
of shot-blast processing, which blows fine iron beads into the 
scrap. With that method, however, the zinc removal rate is only 
85%. In addition, recovering the zinc is difficult, and 
pig 
iron had to be mixed in. 
  A strong point of the new method is that scrap containing a 
large amount of impurities can be handled in a vacuum furnace, 
which requires a high degree of purity to maintain 
air-tightness. With the new method, scrap cut into massive 
pieces is heated to about 700ÎC in the vacuum furnace 
(0.0001 atmosphere) to vaporize the zinc, then that zinc is 
collected by solidifying it, and the iron is recovered by 
cooling it. 
  The zinc removal rate is 97% or more, and 
99%- and 
higher-purity zinc is recovered efficiently. The new method 
helps to lower costs because only small amounts of pig iron need 
to be mixed in.

  [Text] On 25 January Chiyoda Chemical Engineering &amp; 
Construction Co. signed a contract with Daewoo Co. of Korea 
(Seoul; Young Sou Chang, president) to expand joint sales of 
exhaust gas desulfurizers. In the future, Chiyoda CE &amp; C will 
also supply Daewoo with exhaust gas desulfurizing technology. 
Korea has begun regulating emissions of sulfur dioxides as a 
measure against acid rain and other such air pollutants. The two 
companies are looking to jointly sell desulfurizers because an 
increase in demand for that equipment is expected. This is the 
first joint-sales system ever built by a Japanese firm and a 
Korean firm. 
  In addition to Hitachi Ltd. supplying Korea's San Sung Co. 
with exhaust gas desulfurizing technology, Mitsubishi Heavy 
Industries Ltd. has a friendly relationship with Hyundai Heavy 
Industries Ltd. of Korea. Chiyoda CE &amp; C judged that it 
would be 
difficult to sell the desulfurizer on its own in Korea and 
decided to aim for sales through a joint venture. 
  Chiyoda CE &amp; C's exhaust gas desulfurization technology 
removes sulfur oxides by feeding the exhaust gas into a liquid 
in which lime is dissolved. 
  The removal rate is 90%. A total of 30 such 
desulfurizers in 
Japan, the U.S., and Germany have shown good results. 
  Although there is no desulfurization technology in Korea, 
the 
decision has been made to increase the limits on sulfur oxide 
emissions from the current level of 700 PPM to 500 PPM in 1995 
and to 270 PPM in 1999. Only three or four orders for 
desulfurizers are expected this year and will be mainly from 
coal-burning power plants that emit a lot of sulfur oxides. 
Expecting that sort of demand, the two companies will combine 
Chiyoda CE &amp; C's technology with Daewoo's business strength 
to 
sell desulfurizers to electric power companies. 
  In addition to Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries' 
transfer 
of liquefied natural gas (LNG) above-ground storage tank 
technology to San Sung Heavy Industries Ltd., other 
Japanese-Korean tie-ups include Mitsui Engineering &amp; 
Shipbuilding's effort with Hyundai Construction that is aimed at 
joint sales of a Thai fertilizer plant.

  [Text] Hitachi Chemical Co., in cooperation with its 
subsidiary, Hitachi Chemical Technoplant, developed a wastewater 
purification system that efficiently cleans up domestic 
wastewater and runs on about 40% less electricity than 
conventional systems of its kind. The system simultaneously 
performs nitrogen and BOD (biological oxygen demand, a pollution 
index) processing. Along with that, the way the system purifies 
wastewater results in a shorter process and reduces the area 
needed for installation by about 30%. With the increase in 
public resources, Hitachi Chemical sees an increase in the 
demand for the construction of water treatment facilities. The 
company will sell its system to municipalities, and aims for 
sales of about &yen;1 billion during FY94. 
  The system that was developed is a ``go-round-style 
intermittent aeration-purification tank HKN-type'' facility made 
of steel-reinforced concrete. Two computer systems, the ``DO 
controller'' and the ``sludge controller,'' automatically 
control the task called ``aeration,'' which purifies the 
nitrogen, BOD, etc., by feeding oxygen into wastewater that is 
swirled around the purification tank. The aeration can be done 
efficiently because the computers determine the amounts of 
pollutants in the water by means of sensors, and then the system 
feeds in the appropriate amount of oxygen, without wasting any. 
The running cost is low because of the 40% reduction in 
the 
amount of electric power needed. 
  The system can reduce BOD and nitrogen to below 10 PPM to 15 
PPM, respectively, and meets the strictest standards set forth 
by the Water Pollution Prevention Act. In the past, the 
construction of a tank for that level of purification 
necessitated the task of obtaining authorization and designation 
by the Ministry of Construction. The new purification tank, 
however, is the first of its kind in the industry that only 
requires general authorization and general designation, and 
thereby obviates the preliminary application work.

  [Text] The Mechanical Engineering Laboratory (MEL; 
director: Mr. Kenichi Matsuno) of the Agency of Industrial 
Science and Technology, has devised a new diesel engine capable 
of simultaneously reducing the emissions of pollution-causing 
NO[.sub]x[/] (nitrogen oxides) and particulate (black smoke). 
The engine, called a ``pre-combustion-chamber bottom-removable 
diesel engine,'' is an improved version of the pre-combustion- 
chamber injection engine that is mounted on diesel passenger 
cars. Most studies concerning minimum-pollution engines have 
attempted to decrease only one of the two pollutants mentioned 
above. In contrast, MEL's new engine is said to be able to 
reduce the emission of both pollutants. 
  Combustion in a diesel engine takes place in two different 
ways: one involves direct injection, which is used for larger 
vehicles, and the other involves pre-combustion-chamber 
injection, which is used for passenger cars. With the former, 
fuel (light oil) is directly injected into the combustion 
chambers from the connecting ports located at the cylinder 
heads; the combustion moves the pistons. 
  On the other hand, in the pre-combustion-chamber mode, a 
small chamber, called the pre-combustion chamber, is created 
outside the cylinder head, and fuel is first injected into this 
chamber to undergo ``partial combustion'' before being ejected 
into the main combustion chamber. Regardless of the combustion 
mode, black smoke is generated, although a smaller amount of 
NO[.sub]x[/] is generated by the pre-combustion-chamber mode 
than by the direct injection mode, because the mixing of fuel 
and air is more uniform. 
  The new combustion method uses the pre-combustion-chamber 
mode, except that a protrusion of about the same size as the 
connecting port between the main and pre-combustion chambers is 
installed on the top of the piston. When the piston is raised, 
the connecting port is closed, and vice versa. Thus, fuel 
injection can be controlled both over and below the piston. 
  Actually, when the piston is raised, there is a small gap 
left between the piston's protrusion and the connecting port; a 
small amount of the partially burnt fuel can be ejected into the 
main combustion chamber through the gap. 
  This ``leakage'' alleviates the sudden heat generation 
caused 
by the combustion in the pre-combustion chamber (when the piston 
is raised), suppressing the formation of NO[.sub]x[/]. On the 
other hand, the combustion in the main combustion chamber (when 
the piston is lowered) becomes more efficient to re-burn the 
black smoke formed in the pre-combustion chamber to depletion. 
  As the development project is still under way at MEL, Chief 
Researcher Akira Murakami, of MEL's Energy Department, says 
this: ``Our targets are the reduction of NO[.sub]x[/] to 
one-third, and black smoke to approximately one-half that of the 
direct-injection mode.''

  [Text] Assistant Professor Shigeru Tanaka's group at the 
Faculty of Science and Engineering, Keio University, has 
developed a device capable of continuously measuring the 
concentrations of atmosphere-polluting aldehydes in auto 
emissions. The device uses a solvent that dissolves only 
aldehydes, which are separated from exhaust gas in the form of 
liquid. With this device, it is possible to determine the 
concentrations of aldehydes to 0.01 ppm in real time. Assistant 
Professor Tanaka is looking for an avenue for commercializing 
the device as an analyzer for auto engine development. 
  Previously, aldehydes in auto exhaust were determined by 
attaching a liquid-holding container to the end of the exhaust 
pipe and removing it for aldehyde analysis after some driving. 
The method was tedious and time-consuming. 
  The newly developed device consists of a separator -- for 
absorbing only aldehydes from exhaust into a liquid -- and a 
high-speed liquid chromatographic instrument -- for analyzing 
the minute components in the liquid. The separator is a glass 
tube that is 9mm long and 25 cm in diameter and that holds a 
4mm-thick, hollow fluorine-resin pipe inside. 
  The pipe is full of pores that are several microns in 
diameter. For aldehyde analysis, an aldehyde-dissolving liquid 
flows between the glass tubing and the resin pipe, and exhaust 
gas flows inside the resin pipe. The gas diffuses through the 
pores, and only aldehydes are dissolved in the liquid. 
  In experiments, a methanol-burning car was driven on a 
dynamometer for aldehyde analysis. After six minutes of driving, 
the device was reportedly able to determine concentrations of 
formaldehyde and acetaldehyde as low as 0.01 ppm. By passing the 
solvent at a constant flow rate, the concentrations could be 
determined in real time. Assistant Professor Tanaka asserts that 
``other harmful gases, including hydrogen chloride and nitrogen 
oxides, can be analyzed by using an appropriate solvent.''

  [Text] [Nagoya] On 13 December 1993, Daido Steel Co., Ltd. 
(Daido Steel; president: Mr. Kanji Tomita), announced its 
successful development of a regenerative furnace system that can 
conserve energy and reduce emissions of CO[.sub]2[/] and 
NO[.sub]x[/] by more than 15 percent. With this development, 
Daido Steel plans to adopt what is the first regenerative system 
in Japan for the continuous steel-heating furnace at Kawasaki 
Plant (Kawasaki-ku, Kawasaki City) and, subsequently, market 
furnaces using the regenerative system. 
  The newly developed system has two burners each of which is 
made by integrating a regenerator. The two burners are 
alternately operated for combustion and exhaust recovery. The 
heat of exhaust gas is recovered with the regenerator so as to 
maintain combustion air at a high temperature. As a result, the 
combustion efficiency of the system is said to be higher than 75 
percent. The system not only conserves energy, but also reduces 
the emission of CO[.sub]2[/] and NO[.sub]x[/]. 
  The regenerative burner that Daido Steel intends to adopt at 
Kawasaki Plant is manufactured by Tokyo Gas Co., Ltd. The system 
at the plant is scheduled to be completed in March 1994 at an 
investment of &yen;90 million.

  [Text] Kiire Base (Kiire Borough, Ibusuki Gun, Kagoshima 
Prefecture), a base of Nippon Oil Co., Ltd. (Nippon Oil), in the 
Nippon Oil Group, has constructed a co-generator that burns slop 
oil recovered from ballast water and has begun operation of it. 
The base had previously been using slop oil for a boiler to heat 
tanks and pipes. This was the first time for the Nippon Oil 
Group to use slop oil as a fuel for power generation. In 
November 1993, the in-house power generator (1,000 kW), 
completed with an investment of &yen;370 million, began 
operation, and there has been no problem thus far. 
  Slop oil is recovered from sludge from ballast water and the 
bottom of oil tanks. At Kiire Base, 20,000 kl per year of 
treated slop oil are recovered. The oil had previously been used 
as boiler fuel to heat tanks and pipes for crude oil from South 
Asia that had solidified at a low temperature as a result of its 
high wax content. 
  Now the slop oil is going to be used as fuel for in-house 
power generation. The newly installed co-generator is designed 
to supply one-third of the base's power requirement and is said 
to consume 2,000 kl of slop oil. This generator will reduce the 
base's power consumption by approximately &yen;2 per kWh from 
the cost of purchased power (contracted as a large consumer). 
The application of slop oil for power generation is expected to 
be used by other oil refineries within the Nippon Oil Group.

  [Text] The Air-Conditioning Research Institute of 
Matsushita Seiko Co., Ltd. (Matsushita Seiko), has successfully 
developed a chelating resin-based NO[.sub]x[/] remover that 
was found to be highly effective in eliminating NO[.sub]2[/] 
(nitrogen dioxide), the most harmful among NO[.sub]x[/] 
(nitrogen oxides). 
  Matsushita Seiko plans, for the time being, to apply this 
NO[.sub]x[/]-removal agent to filters that will be 
incorporated in its own commercial products, including air 
cleaners, air-supply-type ventilators and heat-exchanger-type 
ventilators, to upgrade the functions of these products. 
  The developed NO[.sub]x[/] remover is based on the matrix 
of a copolymer of styrene and divinyl-benzene, which is a 
porous, polymeric, chelating resin. This matrix is derivatized 
with a special functional group that undergoes a chemical 
reaction with adsorbed NO[.sub]2[/] for removal. The agent is 
capable of effectively removing NO[.sub]2[/] at an ultra-low 
concentration (approximately 0.01 ppm) in air, and the 
effectiveness lasts approximately 30 times longer than activated 
charcoal on a unit weight basis. The resin is made in 0.8- to 
1.2mm-sized spheres, so it can easily be attached to a piece of 
urethane to produce a filter that yields little pressure loss, 
and it is easy to handle. The resin is also capable of removing 
other harmful gas components (including SO[.sub]x[/], i.e., 
sulfur oxides, and acetaldehyde). 
  In recent years, the atmospheric pollution by nitrogen 
oxides 
generated by automobiles has become a serious issue. Among 
nitrogen oxides, NO[.sub]2[/] is considered to be one of 
several causes for pediatric asthma and allergies, and the 
atmospheric concentration of NO[.sub]2[/] is known to exceed 
the environmental standard in some cases. Such outdoor air is 
causing the worsening of indoor air quality.

  [Text] On 21 December 1993, Electric Power Development Co., 
Ltd. (EPD; president: Mr. Kazuo Sugiyama), announced that a 
contract had been signed with Japan International Cooperation 
Agency (JICA) for technological cooperation concerning the 
power- development-plan survey for Vietnam. According to the 
contract, EPD, jointly with Japan Energy Economics Research 
Institute (board chairperson: Mr. Toyoaki Ikuta), will cooperate 
in drafting the power development plan in Vietnam. This is the 
first cooperative effort with Vietnam in power-source 
development. In the five years leading up to 1992, Vietnam's 
power demand showed an average annual increase of 7.3 percent, 
and the trend is expected to continue into the near future. 
Therefore, the Vietnamese government had assigned priority to 
the power-development project and had asked Japan for technical 
assistance in the project. 
  EPD is to offer its assistance from December 1993 through 
August 1995, during which time Vietnam's power-demand forecast 
will be surveyed, a power-development plan for 1996 through 2010 
will be drafted, and basic policies for executing the plan will 
be examined. Vietnam's total power-generation-facility capacity 
is estimated to be 3,057 megawatts, of which 54 percent is 
generated by hydroelectric power. With the new contract, EPD 
will be involved in cooperative efforts with 41 nations.

  [Text] The National Institute of Materials &amp; Chemical 
Research (NIMC) of the Agency of Industrial Science and 
Technology has successfully increased the alcohol combustion 
temperature by 30 percent at maximum by controlling the 
combustion state with a magnetic field. The concentration of 
oxygen at the combustion temperature was controlled because of 
the attraction of oxygen to a magnetic field. NIMC plans to 
study applications of this technology to internal-combustion 
engines including turbines, hoping to be able to eventually 
develop a universal technology for increasing combustion 
efficiency. 
  Atmospheric oxygen is a magnetic material that is attracted 
to a magnet. In contrast, atmospheric nitrogen, which accounts 
for 80 percent constituent of the atmosphere, is hardly affected 
by a magnet. Based on these facts, NIMC controlled combustion by 
burning fuel where only oxygen can be constantly supplied with 
the aid of a magnetic field created by an electromagnet or a 
permanent magnet. 
  NIMC carried out combustion experiments in air with a 
platinum catalyst and checked variations in the combustion 
temperature. A 1 x 2 cm piece of asbestos was placed between the 
N and S poles of an electromagnet, more specifically, near the 
end of the magnet where the magnetic field strength changes 
suddenly. This is the place that is said to be most suitable for 
promoting combustion with oxygen's circulation activated by the 
magnet's attraction. 
  A constant amount of fuel, butanol or gasoline, was fed to 
the asbestos piece with the attached platinum catalyst from the 
side that is within a magnetic field. Oxygen was introduced from 
the other side (no magnetic field) of the asbestos piece. The 
combustion temperature was measured at a point 70 cm away from 
the asbestos piece. 
  As a result, it was discovered that gasoline, which burned 
at 
440ÎC prior to the application of a magnetic field now 
burned at 480ÎC with the magnetic field, showing a 10 
percent increase in combustion temperature. In the case of 
butanol, a 30 percent increase in combustion temperature was 
reportedly observed. 
  At NIMC, Chief Researcher Nobuko Wakayama says, ``It appears 
possible to use a magnetic field to improve combustion 
efficiency.'' She adds that in the future, attempts will be made 
to apply the technology to chemical reactions including 
electrolysis and oxidation-reduction processes, and combustion 
under microgravity. 
  Although there had hardly been any precedent of practical 
application of a magnetic field to control chemical reactions, 
NIMC is hopeful that the technology can be effective in fuel 
consumption and diesel exhaust treatment because nitrogen oxides 
(NO[.sub]x[/]) and hydroxides, in addition to oxygen, can be 
attracted by a magnetic field.

  [Text] The research group of Assistant Professor Hisatada 
Hashimoto and Researcher Seiji Maeda at the Organic Material 
Engineering Department of the Faculty of Engineering at Tokyo 
Institute of Technology has developed a new 
temperature-difference battery using a vitreous carbon material 
for the electrodes. This battery is said to generate 
electromotive force twice as strong as that generated by 
existing temperature-difference batteries. The generation of 
greater electromotive force is attributed to the greater 
difference in the electrolytic reactions that is produced by 
using a vitreous carbon material that can convert 
temperature-difference energy into electric energy, instead of 
platinum for the battery electrodes. This new battery is 
expected to draw the attention of environmental fields, because 
it can generate electric energy from warm industrial-waste water. 
  The temperature-difference battery generates electricity by 
taking advantage of the difference in the degrees of ionization 
of an electrolyte at two temperatures. Previous 
temperature-difference batteries used platinum electrodes that 
had a low capacity for converting the temperature difference 
into electric energy. Also, some batteries used vitreous carbon 
made from either a phenolic resin or cellulose for the 
electrodes, which needed extra thickness to compensate for the 
lack of strength. With thicker electrodes, the battery's 
internal resistance increased to consume a part of the 
electromotive force. 
  For the electrodes, Assistant Professor Hashimoto's group 
used the vitreous carbon material it developed in-house. The 
material is approximately 1.5 times stronger than the vitreous 
carbon material made from cellulose. Moreover, the group added 
boron onto the surface of the new vitreous carbon to obtain 
higher voltage. 
  Actually, the new, 50-micron-thick, vitreous carbon film was 
produced by adding boron to an organic compound called 
polycarboxy-diimide and shaping the mixture into film form 
before baking at 600ÎC. The electrode is prepared by 
vapor-depositing copper on one side of this film. 
  The new battery generated electromotive force of 
approximately 3 millivolts per use, which was twice that of the 
battery with platinum electrodes. The current from this battery 
was 25 mA/m[.sup]2[/] at a temperature difference of 
20ÎC. In experiments, the group used an electrolyte that was 
comparatively poor in electric conductivity in order to confirm 
the performance of the electrode. However, the group believes 
that industrial applications of this battery are feasible if 
larger electrodes and a more conductive electrolyte are used.

  [Text] A group consisting of the National Institute for 
Resources and Environment, the Agency of Industrial Science and 
Technology, MITI, and six private corporations -- including 
Tokyo Electric Power Co., Ltd., and Nippon Steel Corp. -- has 
developed a technology for decomposing freon, which is known to 
destroy the ozone layer, and believes that the technology could 
soon be implemented. The group verified that an initially 
established target of decomposing 50 kg freon in one hour was 
achieved. The technology was also confirmed to be effective in 
the decomposition of halon. Based on the judgement that ``the 
technology can be commercialized,'' the group plans to 
commercialize the decomposition device. 
  In July 1990, the group began a research project concerning 
the use of plasma capable of breaking atoms into nuclei and 
electrons, for the purpose of decomposing freon into harmless 
materials. As a result, the group developed a 100-kW 
decomposition device that was tested for verification through 
March 1993. 
  A mixed gas of freon and steam is fed to the plasma device, 
and decomposition takes place in a plasma state at approximately 
10,000ÎC. A neutralizer (sodium hydroxide) and a fixer 
(calcium hydroxide) are added to the acidic gas formed by the 
decomposition to produce salt and fluorite. 
  In the verification tests, the group decomposed freon 113 
(which is used to clean semiconductors), freons 12 and 11 (which 
are used as refrigerator coolant), and halon 1301 (which is the 
active ingredient in fire extinguishers). 
  As a result, the different types of freon were successfully 
decomposed at the initially established target rate of 50 kg per 
hour. This rate is equivalent to the decomposition of enough 
freon for approximately 280 units of household refrigerators. 
The decomposition of freon was reliable at an efficiency of 
99.999 percent, and the decomposition products were proven to be 
harmless. Also, halon was decomposed at a rate of 53 kg per hour. 
  The group also confirmed that the total cost of decomposing 
1 
kg of freon was less than &yen;300, which included approximately 
&yen;100 for operation, including the cost of electricity, and 
additional costs for facilities and labor. 
  Based on the verification test results, the group plans to 
study the feasibility of the commercialization of the 
decomposition device in FY93 and, in the spring of 1994, begin 
to contact government and private organizations involved in 
freon recovery. 
  In February 1990, at the Montreal Protocol Second Treaty 
Nations Conference, it was decided that the so-called 
ozone-layer- destroying substances -- such as special freon, 
special halon, and trichloroethane -- would be totally banned in 
the period from year 2000 to year 2005. Subsequently, an 
increasing number of nations began to enforce the ban earlier 
than year 2000. Japan has also decided to enforce the ban by the 
end of 1995. 
  The freon decomposition technology, along with the 
development of freon substitutes, appears to have a bright 
future. In Japan, various combustion and catalytic methods are 
currently being studied, although studies are still at the basic 
research stage.

  [Text] To date, the human race has been using up fossil 
fuel as if it were an infinite energy source. Today, the end of 
the energy source has begun to appear, and the source is 
expected to dry up in the second half of the 21st century. 
Carbon dioxide (CO[.sub]2[/]), the product of fuel 
consumption, is causing the global warming trend. If 
CO[.sub]2[/] is recovered and stored on a global scale, it 
may be possible to re-utilize it as a post-fossil energy source 
by converting the gas into C-compounds with yet-to-be-developed 
efficient technology. Although the deep sea isolation and 
underground press-in methods had previously been proposed for 
the large-scale storage of CO[.sub]2[/], the Government 
Industrial Research Institute (GIRI; director: Mr. Reikichi 
Iwamoto), Osaka, of the Agency of Industrial Science and 
Technology, presented a new proposal at the October meeting of 
the Japan Society of Chemical Engineers: ``CO[.sub]2[/] 
generated by the entire world over a span of 10,000 years can be 
stored in the ice bed at the South Pole.'' The proposal, which 
can be simply implemented, drew special attention. 
<H5>  Annual Emission Close to 20 Billion Tons </H5>
  The worldwide emission of CO[.sub]2[/] amounts to nearly 
20 billion tons. Previously, the deep sea isolation method, the 
method of increasing yield or recovering crude oil from spent 
oil fields (EOR), and the method of placing the gas underground, 
such as into exhausted natural gas fields and subterranean 
aquifers, had been considered for large-scale storage of carbon 
dioxide. However, none of those methods were practical, because 
there is not enough storage capacity or there is a lack of data 
concerning the effects of CO[.sub]2[/] in sea water and in 
the ground. 
  According to the proposed deep sea isolation method, 
CO[.sub]2[/] is to be either liquified or solidified and 
isolated in the sea at depths of 3,000 meters or more. When 
CO[.sub]2[/] is dissolved in sea water, its hydrogen ion 
concentration (pH) decreases, and it can affect an ecological 
environment through diffusion. The method of pressing 
CO[.sub]2[/] into subterranean aquifers involves the 
pressurization of the gas into aquifers that are 2,000 meters or 
more deep and are salt-rich. Carboxyl ions formed as a result of 
the dissolution of CO[.sub]2[/] in water will diffuse into 
soil and rocky crevices. There is much to be studied about the 
effects of CO[.sub]2[/] in soil. The spent-oil-field EOR 
method permits the storage of only 63 billion tons of carbon 
dioxide, which would be filled up in just three years. The lack 
of storage capacity is also a problem with the storage method 
using exhausted natural gas fields, which is implemented on a 
small scale with a storage capacity of 180 billion tons, good 
for about nine years. 
<H5>  Below Sublimation Point of Dry Ice </H5>
  Chief Researcher Takako Honjo of the Energy Conversion 
Material Department of GIRI, Osaka, who is in charge of the 
South Pole ice bed storage method research project, insists that 
``the South Pole has advantages for storing a huge amount of 
carbon dioxide in a recyclable state for a long time.'' 
Calculated from the size of the ice bed, the storage capacity is 
ample for the worldwide CO[.sub]2[/] emission for 100 
centuries. Not technically difficult, the method involves 
drilling holes in the South Pole ice bed and storing 
CO[.sub]2[/] in a solid form (dry ice). It is sensible to 
utilize holes in the South Pole's ice bed which are at 
temperatures below the sublimation point of dry ice, i.e., - 
78xC. Ice can be found in the cave in the lava plateau of Mount 
Fuji, the ``Wind Cave of Fuji,'' even in the summer season. This 
is possible because the air inside the Wind Cave remains at the 
lowest temperature annually based on the principle of the 
downward cave. In the winter, cold, heavy air on the ground 
moves into the cave; in the summer, warm air cannot enter the 
cave because it is light. Despite the high, average outside air 
temperature and its wide fluctuation, the cave can selectively 
maintain a minimum air temperature. On the ice bed of the South 
Pole, the annual minimum air temperature easily reaches below 
-78xC. Therefore, if ``downward caves,'' like the Wind Cave of 
Fuji, are dug out, dry ice can be stored permanently without any 
concern whatsoever about the evaporation problem, the most 
serious problem in long-term storage of CO[.sub]2[/]. 
<H5>  Problem: How to Transport to South Pole </H5>
  Under current consideration as a model is the ice bed 
plateau 
in the interior of Antarctica. The Area has a practically 
infinite storage capacity for a worldwide CO[.sub]2[/] 
emission quantity lasting for more than 100 centuries. Moreover, 
unlike coastal ice beds, the ice bed plateau moves at an 
extremely slow rate of one meter over several tens of thousands 
years to make the movement of a facility negligible. Based on 
the experience of drilling to a depth of 700 meters through the 
ice bed at Japan's Mizuho Antarctica Base, it is technically 
quite feasible to drill 200-m- deep caves. The problem is how to 
transport recovered CO[.sub]2[/] to the South Pole. For the 
time being, tankers exclusively for CO[.sub]2[/] are being 
considered, although the state of CO[.sub]2[/], liquid or 
solid, has not yet been decided. Furthermore, such an ice-bed 
storage method, if scaled down, can be adopted in other regions. 
Thus, it is possible to see earlier implementation of this 
method in places like Greenland, where CO[.sub]2[/]-consuming 
regions are nearby.

  [Text] The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) 
will perform a broad-area acid-rain-monitoring survey and a 
program to determine the effects of air pollution in four 
Southern Chinese cities, including Liuchow (Kwansi Chuan 
Self-Governing District). In November 1993, JICA dispatched its 
first survey group to China. The group, in cooperation with the 
PRC's National Science and Technology Committee and municipal 
environmental protection bureaus, plans to draft by October 1994 
a general anti-air-pollution program (to run through fiscal year 
2005) that will monitor and control acid-rain concentrations in 
the areas. Recently, environmental cooperation between Japan and 
PRC was accelerated with the December 1993 conclusion of the 
Sino-Japanese environmental cooperation pact while Chairman 
Jieng Song of the National Science and Technology Committee, 
PRC, was visiting Japan. 
  Liuchow City was chosen as the main monitoring site because 
of the concentration of iron works and heat-and-electric power 
plants in the city. The city's industrial production ranks the 
fourth in the self-governing district and the 18th among the 190 
industrial cities in the entire nation. According to Seiji 
Kaiho, chief of the Second Social Development Survey Section of 
JICA, Liuchow's industrial activities at times ``have a 
considerable effect on the environment for residents in Hong 
Kong and the Ju River delta.'' 
  The broad-area acid-rain-monitoring survey will be carried 
out by installing three or four precision measurement 
instruments at each of a total of 16 sites: five sites in 
Liuchow, five in Gueilin (Kwansi Chuan Self-Governing District), 
two in Wuchow (Kwansi Chuan Self-Governing District), and four 
in Kwanchow (Kwanton Province). 
  In the PRC, acid rain is defined as having a pH of less than 
5.6. In 1991, rain pH of 4.29 was recorded in Liuchow, where the 
acid- rain rate was as high as 98 percent. These values were 
about the same as or higher than the other cities in the area; 
i.e., Gueilin (4.78 and 64 percent), Wuchow (3.98-4.5 and 87 
percent), and Kwanchow (4.1 and 72 percent). Thus, the 
broad-area monitoring was deemed necessary. 
  The investigation concerning air pollution will target three 
points: 
  (1) types of pollutants; 
  (2) meteorological data collection; 
  (3) measurement of emission components at factories, i.e., 
emission sources. 
  There will be 10 monitoring locations designated within 
Liuchow City.

  [Text] Tokyo Electric Power Co., Ltd. (Tokyo Electric), has 
developed a simple, convenient technology for converting the 
ozone- layer-destroying specific freon into harmless substances 
on the spot, wherever the freon was recovered from refrigerators 
or automobile air-conditioners. In FY94, Tokyo Electric plans to 
produce a test machine to do the conversion for performance 
evaluation purposes. The technology is based on the photolysis 
of freon by ultraviolet light from a mercury lamp and the 
separation of unreacted freon from chlorine gas by a gas 
separating membrane. Thus far, Tokyo Electric has been able to 
demonstrate the treatment capacity of 50 g in eight hours for an 
experimental device. The device will be scaled up with improved 
efficiency in the test machine for future commercialization. 
This device -- involving photolysis with ultraviolet light at 
normal temperature and under normal pressure -- is so simple and 
convenient with its on-the-spot conversion of freon from 
refrigerators and automobile air-conditions that it is expected 
to be implemented soon. 
  One of the specified types of freon, CFC12, is the coolant 
that is almost exclusively used for refrigerators and auto 
air-conditioners. In all likelihood, requirements in the near 
future will specify that CFC12 must be recovered from these 
cooling devices prior to their disposal and must be converted 
into safe substances at places where used refrigerators are 
collected and at automobile factories. 
  The basic segment of the new, UV-light-using 
freon-decomposition device, developed jointly by Tokyo Electric 
and Kansai New Technology Research Institute, consists simply of 
ultraviolet lamps and a gas separation membrane. Noting that the 
chlorine atoms of freon are detached by ultraviolet rays in the 
stratosphere, the joint team devised a device that separates 
chlorine atoms from freon by irradiating ultraviolet rays in a 
reaction vessel and that recovers chlorine gas by means of the 
gas separation membrane. Ultraviolet rays sever the 
carbon-chlorine bonds in a freon molecule. Carbon and fluorine, 
which remain combined, are recovered as powdery fluoro-polymers. 
  Thus far, the joint team has been able to confirm the 
decomposition of five different types of specified freon and has 
demonstrated that any freon mixture with lubricating oil can be 
handled by the device, if the oil can be separated from freon by 
taking advantage of the difference in the boiling points prior 
to the photolytic decomposition. Today, the device, which uses 
two 32-watt low-pressure mercury lamps, can be continuously 
operated to process 50 g of freon in eight hours. 
  The basic technology of the device has been essentially 
proven to be satisfactory, and the prospect is bright for 
increasing the processing capacity by combining a number of 
reactors. Tokyo Electric plans to build a pilot model with 
improved capacity through modifications that include improving 
the efficiency of ultraviolet-ray utilization by surrounding the 
reactor with reflective boards. The model is expected to be 
tested for its performances by the end of FY94 prior to 
production of a commercial-scale device. In 1992, Tokyo 
Electric, in cooperation with the Agency of Industrial Science 
and Technology, had developed a mass concentration-type device 
that could decompose freon with 10,000ÎC heat from a plasma 
torch. However, the new, more compact device, with smaller 
capacity, is expected to be commercialized soon because it can 
be conveniently handled right at the places of recovery for used 
refrigerators and car air-conditioners. 
  The joint team has thus far spent only approximately &yen;40 
million for the development of this device, which has such 
bright prospects for commercialization, by taking full advantage 
of computer chemistry for clarifying the reaction mechanisms.

  [Text] Three chemical companies -- Toagosei Chemical 
Industry Co., Ltd. (Toagosei), Kanegafuchi Chemical Industry 
Co., Ltd. (Kanegafuchi), and Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals, Inc. 
(Mitsui Toatsu) -- will embark on a joint project for developing 
a new, energy-saving electrolysis technology that is expected to 
reduce electric power costs to nearly 40 percent below the 
existing ion-exchange membrane electrolysis. The group plans to 
spend six years starting in FY93 and approximately &yen;500 
million in the context of the efficient energy utilization 
development technology-implementation subsidy system of MITI. 
Medium-sized electrolyzers will be installed in Toagosei's 
Nagoya Plant and Kanegafuchi's Takasago Plant for the project. 
This technology originated from the basic study by Professor 
Keiichi Furuya, of Yamanashi University, and was further 
developed with the assistance of the Japan Soda Industry 
Association. Essentially, the project appears to be a 
cooperative project for all soda makers in Japan. 
  Japan produces approximately 3.84 million tons per year 
(FY92) of sodium hydroxide. About 90 percent of this quantity is 
produced by the ion exchange membrane method, which had saved 
considerably more energy than the previous diaphragm process. 
However, the soda industry is still among the industries 
notorious for their energy-consumption. 
  The industry has been waiting for a new energy-saving 
electrolysis technology to be developed. The process originally 
developed by Professor Furuya lowers voltage to eliminate the 
cause for the deterioration of energy efficiency by preventing 
the generation of hydrogen, a by-product of the electrolysis. 
Hydrogen is formed at the anode, and the prevention was achieved 
by using a new gas-diffusion electrode. There will still be 
problems with the process if it is industrialized, including the 
life of this electrode. 
  Therefore, with a subsidy from MITI, the above-mentioned 
three companies will embark on the six-year project starting in 
FY93, with a budget of &yen;479 million to solve the problems of 
the new technology for industrialization. The three companies 
recently submitted to MITI a formal application for the subsidy 
and are scheduled to begin research in December 1993. Small 
electrolyzers will be installed at Toagosei's Nagoya Plant and 
Kanegafuchi's Takasago Plant to study the electrode's 
performances, confirm its life, evaluate its structure and 
materials, evaluate the materials for the construction of the 
electrolyzer, and modify or improve them as much as possible. 
Based on the results of the studies, the group will design a 
1.2-m-tall, medium-sized electrolyzer and will optimize the 
production method for the gas-diffusion electrode. Engineering 
data will be gathered with the medium-sized electrolyzer for the 
industrialization of the technology. 
  According to MITI, in FY92, Japan's soda industry consumed 
9,780 megakilowatt-hours of electric power. When the new 
electrolysis technology is developed, the power consumption is 
expected to be reduced by approximately 36 percent. Furthermore, 
this gas-diffusion electrode is said to be broadly applicable in 
the electrochemical industry, including for high-performance 
cells such as fuel cells and for electroplating processes.

  [Text] For the first time in Japan, a ``solid electrolyte 
fuel cell'' has been successfully operated, by Electric Power 
Development Co., Ltd. (EPD). The cell, which is under joint 
development with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. (MHI), was in 
operation for an accumulated total time of 3,000 hours. The 
1-kW-output fuel cell is being test-operated at Wakamatsu 
General Office (Kitakyushu City) of EPD. The cell was 
inspected after 500 hours of initial test-operation, which had 
begun in June 1993, and, subsequently, the test operation was 
resumed for a period of 2,500 hours. 
  Generally speaking, in order to commercially operate a fuel 
cell for a profit, an output of 200 kW or more and continuous 
operation for 40,000 hours are said to be the requirements for a 
dispersion-type power source. Therefore, it is difficult to 
commercialize a cell under development in the early stage. EPD 
plans to develop a 10-kW-output cell prior to its full-scale 
attempt at commercialization. 
  A fuel cell generates electricity from the reaction of 
hydrogen with oxygen, which is the reverse of water 
electrolysis. The type of fuel cell depends upon the type of 
electrolyte necessary for the reaction. For example, stabilized 
zirconia is used for the solid electrolyte type. Power 
generation efficiency as high as 50-60 percent can be expected 
if the fuel cell, with a high internal reaction temperature of 
900-1,000ÎC, is combined into a composite power-generation 
system with either a gas or steam turbine using high-temperature 
exhaust gas. 
  EPD is using hydrogen as the fuel for the test operation, 
although coal gas can also be used. EPD will continue the 
development of a power source to replace thermally generated 
power by combining the gasification technology with its 
negligible impact on the environment.

  [Text] Nippon Oil Co., Ltd. (Nippon Oil), and Niigata 
Engineering Co., Ltd. (Niigata Engineering), have jointly 
developed a sewage treatment system that uses a reaction tower 
instead of an activated sludge tank. The tower is packed with a 
microbial catalyst sealed in polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) for sewage 
processing. The tower is more advantageous as a sewage treatment 
facility in highly populated areas because of the comparatively 
smaller area required for installation and the much smaller 
amount of odor that is generated. Thus, the new facility should 
cost less in real estate, and the overall business expenses for 
the facility should be the same as or slightly less than those 
for the existing system. The commercialization of the new system 
is planned in FY96. 
  A pilot plant with a processing capacity of 100 tons per day 
will be installed at the Kanazawa Sewage Treatment Plant in 
Yokohama City, and its operation will be monitored through March 
1995. Although a sludge tank similar to a swimming pool is used 
in the existing sewage treatment facility, the newly developed 
system uses a 1.8-m diameter, 8-m tall reaction tower in which 
sewage is treated by agitation with air pumped from the bottom 
of the tower in order to promote contact between the sewage and 
the catalyst. 
  The catalyst, which had been developed by Nippon Oil, is a 
microbe, capable of decomposing organic matter, that is embedded 
in special PVA. One piece is a rubbery, 7 x 7 x 4mm rectangular 
parallelopiped. It has a fine mesh-like internal structure in 
which microbes can be arranged densely and uniformly. Compared 
with that of the sludge tank, the microbial density is more than 
five times greater, to enable the treatment in the limited space 
inside the tower. 
  Thus, the land requirement for a sewage treatment plant is 
reduced by the area occupied by the tank. The pilot plant, 
including attachments such as pumps, will be constructed on a 
37.5-m[.sup]2[/] area. On a commercial scale, a new facility 
is said to occupy only one-third to one-sixth the area an 
existing plant occupies. The reaction tower exhausts gas from 
its top, so as to prevent odor from spreading over the 
neighborhood. 
  In the past, attempts were made to increase the density of 
microbes to reduce the size of the sludge tank although this is 
the first plant to use a tower instead of a tank. If favorable 
results are obtained with the pilot plant, the joint team plans 
to sell the new system to municipalities as a small-scale sewage 
treatment facility. 
  Since FY91, the seventh-generation's five-year sewage water 
upgrading plan has been under way, with a total cost of 
&yen;16.5 trillion, including the sewage treatment system budget.

  [Text] [Tsukuba] Nippon Paper Co., Ltd. (Nippon Paper), has 
discovered a bacteria strain capable of efficient decomposition 
of lignin, a component of wood, and has developed a pulp 
bleaching technology with the bacteria. Nippon Paper claims that 
the new technology produces whiter regenerated paper than that 
produced by the usual method. Thus, the new technology is 
expected to replace the existing method of using chlorine-based 
bleaching agent that is the potential source for harmful 
substances, including dioxin, and the unpleasant odor. 
  Lignin is a polymer contained in the ligneous parts of plant 
and is also a colored component in pulp production. The research 
group at Nippon Paper sought lignin-digestible bacteria from 
whitish, putrefied trees and certain groups of mushrooms. 
  As a result, the group was able to isolate a strain of 
bacteria that was highly capable of discoloring pulp in agar 
media. When unbleached pulp (whiteness of 51 percent) that had 
been treated with oxygen and alkali was treated with the 
bacteria for one week at 30ÎC, the whiteness of pulp 
improved to more than 80 percent. 
  Although some lignin-decomposing bacteria had been known in 
the past, this particular strain discovered by Nippon Paper was 
found to be more capable of bleaching than any of the previously 
known bacteria strains. Nippon Paper will try to grow variants 
from this strain and achieve a pulp whiteness of 88-90 percent, 
which is equivalent to the whiteness of high-quality paper. 
  Today, pulp is being bleached with a large quantity of a 
chlorine-based chemical at a high temperature. This process has 
become an environmental pollution problem because, at such a 
high temperature, the chlorine-based chemical produces harmful 
substances including dioxin. Therefore, the technology using a 
microorganism is expected not only to alleviate environmental 
pollution, but also to reduce the cost of the pulp bleaching 
process.

  [Text] [Sendai] Tohoku Electric Power Co., Ltd. (Tohoku 
Electric), in cooperation with Professor Heiji Enomoto of Tohoku 
University, has developed a waste plastic recycling technology 
that uses a hydrothermal reaction. Plastic materials and water 
were placed in a pressurized vessel and were decomposed at a 
high temperature and under high pressure to a gasoline or 
grease-like, oily substance that was recovered. Compared to the 
existing plastic decomposition technology, the new technology 
does not require a catalyst, but uses only water for 
decomposition. In addition, the new technology permits the 
choice of decomposition products, which include light oil and 
grease. The technology appears to be promising for paving the 
way for effective recycling of plastic materials, which form a 
large part of wastes. 
  The new technology uses ``supercritical water'' at a 
temperature above 374ÎC and under a pressure greater than 
22.1 MPa. Unlike ordinary water, supercritical water can break 
down plastics by being readily ionizable and miscible with oil. 
  Tohoku Electric placed polyethylene and water together in 
the 
pressure vessel, heated them to 400ÎC, and confirmed the 
decomposition of polyethylene to oil containing paraffin and 
olefin after a reaction time of one to three hours. By changing 
the quantity of water, as well as the reaction temperature and 
time, Tohoku Electric was able to change the nature of the oil 
product, whose appearance ranged from gasoline to grease. It is 
also claimed that only aromatic compounds can be recovered. 
  Polyethylene is one of the plastic materials that are most 
difficult to decompose. The new ``hydrothermal reaction'' 
technology is said to be also capable of decomposing other 
plastic materials, such as polyester and polystyrene. The 
reaction produces only oil and water, but essentially no harmful 
by-products. Therefore, the technology is free of environmental 
problems, and the water can be re-used repeatedly in the process. 
  Previously, the so-called pyrolysis method had been studied 
to be used for plastic recycling. However, this method had 
several disadvantages, including the need for a catalyst, the 
slow rate of processing, the generation of by-products including 
cokes, and control difficulty.

  [Text] In FY94, the Agency of Natural Resources and Energy 
(ANRE) will embark on the construction of a treatment plant for 
waste oil and oil-containing sludge from gasoline stations. This 
measure was necessitated by the July 1993 revised ``waste 
treatment law'' that specifically regulates the treatment of 
gasoline station wastes. In the private sector, Ishiyagawa Plant 
of Kobe Petroleum Business Co-op Union had been treating 
gasoline station wastes without government subsidy. 
  The ANRE's treatment plant for spent oil and oil-containing 
sludge from gasoline stations will be built by providing a 
subsidy of &yen;200 million (two-thirds) in FY94 to the 
Prefectural Petroleum Commerce Co-op Federation, which will pay 
the remaining one-third. Initially, only one plant is planned, 
and it is to be modeled after the Ishiyagawa Plant of Kobe 
Petroleum Business Co-op Union. 
  This particular plant, constructed on a 3,205-sq m lot at a 
cost of approximately &yen;300 million and in operation since 
1974, is capable of treating 550 kl of spent oil and 100 tons of 
oil-containing sludge per month. Spent oil is preheated to 
130ÎC, dewatered in a flushing tower, and sent to a 
stationary separation tank, where the sludge sinks to the 
bottom. Oil recovered from this process is converted into heavy 
oil, which is used as fuel for public bath houses and 
greenhouses. 
  Oil-containing sludge, together with the sludge separated 
from spent oil, is sent to an incinerator for separation of the 
oil component from the aqueous component. Processed sludge is 
disposed of at reclaimed dumping sites in Kobe City. Processed 
spent oil, which may be classified as between A and B heavy oil 
grades and which has a low sulfur content of 0.6 percent, can be 
re-used. 
  According to a recent survey by ANRE, the majority of 
gasoline stations paid the processor for spent oil processing; 
approximately 50 percent of the total spent oil was stored in 
drums. The same trend was also seen for oil-containing sludge. 
Therefore, the construction of more treatment facilities is 
desired not only by regulators, but also by petroleum dealers, 
who are concerned about their waste disposal.

  [Text] The LP Gas Promotion Center, Inc. (board 
chairperson: Kazuo Okita) and Fuji Electric Co., Ltd. (Fuji 
Electric), have jointly developed a 100-kW-output, phosphoric 
acid-type, pilot fuel cell that uses butane as fuel. A 
precious-metal catalyst was used in the new cell to eliminate 
the previously inherent problem of short life for a modifying 
catalyst when burning butane. The new butane-burning fuel cell, 
if commercialized, is expected to become a popular 
dispersion-type power-source for factories, because butane is 
cheap and has been widely used as an industrial fuel. 
  The pilot fuel cell is in its last stage of construction at 
Chiba Plant (Ichihara City) of Fuji Electric and is expected to 
be completed by the end of 1993. In the cell, butane is first 
desulfurized in a fuel modifier and decomposed to hydrogen and 
carbon dioxide. This hydrogen undergoes reaction with oxygen 
taken in from the outside to generate direct current, which will 
be converted into alternate current by a converter. 
  During the period from January to March 1994, the fuel cell 
will be evaluated at Chiba Plant to see if it performs as 
designed. The cell's generation efficiency is expected to be 
approximately 40 percent, which is comparable to that of fuel 
cells that use natural or propane gas. The cost of the entire 
development is estimated to be approximately &yen;550 million. 
  In FY94, the test fuel cell will be moved to Niigata 
Terminal, which is the liquid petroleum gas (LPG) import-base 
for Nippon Petroleum Gas Co., Ltd. (Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo; 
president: Naoaki Nakano), a subsidiary of Nippon Oil Co., Ltd., 
for further evaluation of its operation. The generated 
electricity will be used at the base. It is anticipated that the 
cell will be in operation for 2,000 to 2,500 hours per year. 
  Although butane is cheaper than propane by about 10 percent, 
butane, when used for a fuel cell, has tended to quickly 
deactivate the catalyst in the modification step to generate 
hydrogen. 
  If a fuel cell can use butane, it can also use propane. 
Therefore, if commercialized, the new fuel cell is expected to 
grab a large market share. 
  Electric energy is generated by a fuel cell by the mechanism 
that is a reverse of the electrolysis of water. Fuel cells are 
promising power sources for urban areas because of little or no 
adverse impact, including air pollution of the environment. 
  There are three types of fuel cells. Among them, the 
phosphoric acid type is at the most advanced stage of 
development. Other studies concerning this type are currently 
being undertaken with natural gas, petroleum, methanol and coal 
as fuel.

  [Text] In 1995, Toyota Motor Corp. (Toyota) (president: Mr. 
Tatsuro Toyoda) will install a new, double-structured exhaust 
pipe on each and every export vehicle and nonexport vehicle made 
at Toyota's overseas plants in Europe and the United States in 
order to cope with the trend of stiffer exhaust gas regulations. 
The new exhaust pipe is said to be capable of removing 
hydrocarbons (HC) and nitrogen oxides (NO[.sub]x[/]) from the 
exhaust more efficiently than before. Accordingly, Futaba 
Industries Co., Ltd. (Futaba; president: Mr. Masahiko Umemura), 
a muffler maker in the family of Toyota companies, and Sango 
Co., Ltd. (Sango) (Miyoshi-cho, Nishikamo-gun, Aichi Prefecture; 
president: Mr. Kozo Tsunekawa) are getting ready to produce the 
exhaust pipe. 
  An exhaust pipe, previously of single-wall construction, is 
a 
pipe that connects the exhaust manifold and the catalytic 
converter. Toyota developed the double-wall exhaust pipe to 
improve thermal efficiency by minimizing heat radiation with an 
air layer between the inner and outer pipes and by reducing heat 
loss with the thinner inner pipe wall. Thus, the temperature of 
the catalyst can be raised faster immediately after the start of 
an engine, when more harmful substances are emitted, and the 
high temperature is maintained to increase the efficiency of 
removing HC and NO[.sub]x[/]. 
  Environmental regulations concerning automobile exhaust are 
constantly becoming tighter in Europe and the United States; in 
particular, the exhaust gas regulations in the state of 
California, which are considered the most stringent in the 
world, will mandate the sale of low-emission vehicles around 
1997. Thus, Toyota plans to start installing the new exhaust 
pipes to be manufactured by Futaba on the 1995 export car, ES300 
(Japanese name: Windham). 
  At the same time, Sango will license its production 
technology to (Arvin)-Sango Corp., the joint venture company in 
the United States, where the new exhaust pipes will be 
manufactured for installation on the new model, Avalon, to be 
produced at TMM, Toyota's U.S. plant in Kentucky. It is also 
planned that Futaba will license its technology to Walker Corp. 
(U.S.) for the production of the new exhaust pipes in the United 
States. 
  In the fall of 1995, exhaust gas regulations for passenger 
cars will be tightened in Europe. Thus, the new exhaust pipe 
will be installed on the Carina (Japanese name: Corona), 
manufactured in the U.K., and on Japanese-made cars to be 
exported to Europe. Toyota is likely to expand the adoption of 
the new exhaust pipe to domestic cars to cope with a similar 
trend in Japan, after assessing the development in Europe and 
the United States.

  [Text] Sony (Norio Oga, Chairman) succeeded in developing 
the world's first continuous wave oscillation [CW] room 
temperature blue semiconductor laser. The Sony research group 
announced this result at the commencement of a meeting of the 
Applied Physics Society on 28 March at Meiji University in 
Tama-ku, Kawasaki. According to the announcement, Sony succeeded 
in the continuous oscillation of a 489.9 nanometer blue (range) 
laser at a room temperature of 23ÎC. The development of a 
blue (bandwidth) laser was the main goal because blue was the 
only one of the three primary colors--red, green, and blue--that 
remained [to be achieved in a room temperature CW semiconductor 
laser]. Up until now, this laser was the target in a fierce 
development contest carried on primarily between the United 
States and Japan but, with this achievement, Sony has charged 
ahead to take the lead. When the laser is put to practical use 
[commercialized] it can be expected that there will be a 
widespread sphere of applications, including high-capacity 
optical recording equipment, high-performance color printers, 
full-color three- dimensional displays, etc. 
  For semiconductor lasers, room temperature continuous 
oscillation is only the first step toward practical application. 
It has always been the plaintive wish to achieve blue (range) 
room temperature oscillation ever since the 1970s when, using a 
double-hetero structure, the first room temperature CW 
semiconductor laser was achieved. 
  This time, Sony used a II-VI group 
zinc-magnesium-sulfur-selenium quaternary compound as a cladding 
layer to confine the light and, by exerting their ingenuity, the 
Sony researchers succeeded in the lowering of the resistance. 
The threshold current value obtained during room temperature 
continuous oscillation was 93 milliamperes at 6.3 volts. Ever 
since the 3-M company in the United States used a II-VI group 
compound not including magnesium to achieve room temperature 
pulsed oscillation with a 525 nanometer blue-green color, the 
II-VI group suddenly was in the limelight and research 
organizations of the world became engaged in fierce competition 
for development. By including magnesium in the quaternary 
compound in independent research, Sony reported room temperature 
pulsed oscillation of a blue laser in May 1993 and room 
temperature continuous oscillation of a blue-green laser in July 
1993, thereby reversing the leading role in this field. 
  When it is put to practical use [commercialized], the blue 
semiconductor laser, because of its short wavelength 
characteristic, will lead to the realization of a drastic 
advancement in optical recording density as well as medical 
uses, metrology, full-color three-dimensional displays, etc.

<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  In the past, the ashing machines used in mass production 
operations were primarily of the batch processing type capable 
of processing numerous wafers at the same time. However, 
recently, semiconductor manufacturers have been using batch-type 
ashing machines and/or single-wafer ashing machines, depending 
on the process involved, as a means of maximizing efficiency. 
  This is the result of the problems encountered in trying to 
rely solely on batch-type ashing machines to remove the 
photoresist used in masks for high energy ion implantations 
during the diffusion process now that wafers are getting larger 
in diameter and manufacturers are switching from specific CFC 
agents to halogen-type gases in the etching process as a means 
of eliminating CFCs from that process altogether. 
  The manufacturers of ashing machines are carrying out 
development work aimed at responding to these new requirements, 
and in practically every case, they are focusing on single-wafer 
ashing machines capable of accurately controlling process 
conditions. Although single-wafer ashing machines offer the best 
processing and status control for individual wafers, they suffer 
from low throughput when processing wafers that are not capable 
of being processed at high temperatures. 
  In this report, we study techniques for high-speed ashing 
with the goal in mind of enhancing the throughput of 
single-wafer ashing machines. 
<H5>  High-speed Ashing </H5>
  The ashing rate is largely dependent on the temperature of 
the substrate during processing. Heating the stage that the 
substrate is loaded on to 200xC or higher enables an ashing 
throughput rate of between 2-3fm/minute. However, since there 
are those substrates that cannot be subjected to such high 
temperatures, the definition of high-speed ashing will differ 
for different types of substrates. 
  That is, as long as the substrate undergoing the 
single-wafer 
ashing process does not contain metal, such as aluminum 
conductors, conventional processing can be readily applied since 
the substrate can be processed at high temperatures, and 
throughput will be higher than that for batch-type ashing 
machines. However, when the substrate contains aluminum or other 
metal conductors, the task is to see how far reaction efficiency 
can be raised while maintaining the actual temperature of the 
substrate at under 200xC. And in the case of the resist used in 
ion implantation masks, the task is to strip the resist from the 
surface without bursting the hardened surface layer, and to see 
how much processing time can be shortened in the process. 
  Whatever the situation, the key is to facilitate the control 
of the actual temperature of the substrate while seeing how 
efficiently the reaction can be advanced. And it must be a 
process for which charge-up and irradiation damage, and 
contamination are minimal. 
  The following is a list of the capabilities that must be 
developed to realize each of these requirements. 
  Those capabilities related to the plasma source are as 
follows: 
  [1] The ability to supply stably and with high efficiency 
active species (primarily neutral particles) to the substrate to 
achieve a high rate of processing and process repeatability; 
  [2] The ability to confine to a certain extent charged 
particles to the plasma generation region without the use of 
grid electrodes or magnetic fields so as to achieve a high rate 
of processing with low damage; 
  [3] A heating system that readily controls the actual 
temperature of the substrate and a means of eliminating thermal 
factors other than the heat of reaction. 
  Those capabilities that will have to be developed for 
processing substrates containing aluminum conductors and other 
metals are as follows: 
  [1] The ability to achieve a practical ashing rate (goal is 
more than 2.0fm/min for 8-inch wafers) at the mass production 
level while maintaining the actual temperature of the substrate 
at under 200xC during the separate oxygen plasma processes; 
  [2] The ability to clear each of the target values in the 
various damage evaluations (non-volatile memory evaluation, and 
BT and other contamination evaluations). 
  And the capabilities needed to remove the resist used on 
high-concentration ion implantation masks are as follows: 
  [1] The ability to strip at high speeds the resist from the 
hardened surface layer with minimal ion collision (ion dose); 
  [2] The ability to process at high speed and with little 
damage the internal unaltered layer after stripping the resist 
from the surface layer; 
  [3] The ability to achieve homogeneity (in-plane) of less 
than q5%. 
  Development items related to other processes are as 
foillows: 
  [1] The ability to remove polymers following various etching 
processes utilizing halogen gas; 
  [2] The development of conveyance mechanisms that will make 
it possible to get the most out of process performance. 
  Although the thinking at the various ashing machine 
manufacturers differs as to how to accomplish it, they are all 
studying ways to create processes and hardware capable of 
satisfying the above-described requirements for single-wafer 
ashing machines. 
<H5>  Current State of High-speed Ashing </H5>
  Figure 1 shows a diagram of a basic ashing machine chamber. 
The process data put forth below gives characteristic data 
obtained from Tokyo Oka Kogyo's new single-wafer ashing machine 
``TCA-3822'' as reference values. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-36A>      Figure 1. Diagram of TCA-3822 Plasma Chamber </FIG>


  It was initially assumed that a high ashing rate 
(2.0fm/min.) 
with low damage could be achieved using an oxygen plasma alone 
while maintaining actual substrate temperature at under 200xC if 
we established a reaction system comprised primarily of neutral 
particles (radicals and oxygen atoms in a normal state) and 
carried out process control using the hardware. 
  However, we found that a high ashing rate could not be 
achieved with a reaction system comprised solely of pure neutral 
paticles, and that minute amounts of oxygen ions would also be 
required. We also realized that to keep damage to the minimum, 
it would also be necessary to distribute this minute amount of 
oxygen ions (and electrons) uniformly on the surface of the 
substrate. 
  Based on these discoveries, we (Tokyo Oka Kogyo) took the 
measures discussed below, and by so doing, reached the 
conclusion that a practical ashing rate of around 2.0fm/min. can 
be achieved even when substrate temperature is held to below 
200xC. 
  First of all, in addition to efficiently supplying active 
species (mostly neutral particles), we also adopted a large 
capacity (3.0slm) high-speed evacuation structure capable of 
evacuating the reaction-producing gases in a short period of 
time. 
  Next, we developed a plasma source capable of stable 
discharge under a wide range of pressures. 
  We are designing an electrode structure that will enable the 
direction of the high frequency field of the new plasma source 
we developed to remain constantly fixed, and by comparing ashing 
operations using this new electrode with those using our own 
conventional electrodes, we are steadily improving discharge 
stability. Improved discharge stability suppresses the effects 
of the process parameters, and makes it possible to achieve wide 
process margins. Furthermore, emission spectrum comparisons of 
the reaction region showed that even if high output is applied, 
the oxygen ion dose is roughly 1/5-1/8 or less of the 
conventional dosage. We have also been able to confirm the 
outstanding effects of stable discharge on the confinability of 
charged particles in the plasma generation region1). 
  Figure 2 shows the results of comparisons of emission 
spectrum data obtained using the company's conventional 
electrode and the new electrode we recently developed. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-37A>      Figure 2. Comparison of Emission Spectrum Data </FIG>


  Thirdly, we controlled process conditions in the downstream 
region (transport process) so that the traces of oxygen ions and 
electrons that reached the substrate without completely 
vanishing cannot cause a large potential distribution. 
  By taking the above-described measures, we were able to 
achieve an ashing rate of better than 1.8fm/min on 8-inch 
wafers, which was close to our goal of 2.0fm/min., and in-plane 
homogeneity of less than q5%. 
  The actual temperature of the silicon substrate during this 
ashing process was less than 200xC. Figure 3 shows related 
measurement data. This data was obtained by applying resist to a 
special temperature measurement substrate with a thermocouple 
embedded directly into it, and measuring the substrate 
temperature during the ashing process. The temperature of the 
substrate rose during the ashing process as a result of the heat 
of reaction, but dropped again as soon as the ashing process was 
complete. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-37B>      Figure 3. Temperature of Si Substrate (Under 200xC) </FIG>


  Figure 4 shows measurement data on a substrate whose 
temperature was held to less than 250xC during ashing. This 
process achieved an ashing rate of less than 4.0fm/min. and 
in-plane homogeneity of under q8%, indicating that it would be 
beneficial for ashing processes where processing temperatures 
are not restricted very much. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-37C>      Figure 4. Temperature of Si Substrate (Under 250xC) </FIG>


  Next, Figure 5 provides data on plasma damage measured using 
the SCA method. This method measured as Qox values the amount of 
surface charge increase resulting from plasma processing. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-38A>      Figure 5. Plasma Damage Measured Using the SCA Method </FIG>


  This data indicated that the new high-speed single-wafer 
ashing machine exhibited smaller damage values than the coaxial 
batch ashing machine so widely used in mass production 
operations at present (the high-speed single-wafer ashing 
machine also achieved very favorable results when subjected to 
evaluation methods using non-volatile memory.). 
  Next, a physical reaction accompanied by ion collision is 
essential to the high-speed stripping of resist used in 
high-concentration ion implantation masks. And damage should be 
slight if the process can control, uniformly and to the lowest 
limits, the ion energy irradiated on the wafer separate from the 
plasma generation mechanism. 
  There have been a lot of papers written in recent years on 
the removal of dopant that accumulates on substrates in the form 
of oxides following the removal of ion implantation resist2). In 
tests carried out by Tokyo Oka Kogyo, we were able to confirm 
that after-treatment or post-processing using plasma directly 
following the ashing process was effective against inorganic 
residue (See Figure 6). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-38B>      Figure 6. Plasma Post-processing Directly Following Ashing </FIG>


  In addition, from the standpoint of improving total 
throughput, to include derating wet-stripping processes, we will 
talk briefly about sidewall removal following dry etching. 
  The residue left following metal etching in particular, 
because it contains metals among its constituents, is difficult 
to remove completely using dry-stripping processes involving 
oxygen alone, giving rise to studies aimed at adding a gas 
process (right now, this residue is being removed by the 
combined use of an alkaline solvent in the wet-stripping 
process.)3). 
  The development task is to determine how much the 
``roughness'' and ``cracking'' in the bed caused by an 
additional gas process can be held in check, and how well 
processing can be achieved with ordinary cleaning without using 
alkaline solvents. The target is a completely dry-stripping 
process. 
<H5>  Conclusions </H5>
  Future ashing machines will be required to achieve faster 
total processing times, which means it will be necessary to 
develop high-speed processing capabilities that include the 
development of processes that meet all requirements and 
improving the hardware aspects of these processes, such as 
shortening conveyance and stand-by times. 
  Ashing machine manufacturers will have to be persistent in 
their development operations, and the development of rational 
machines will be an absolute condition for accurately meeting 
users' needs. Here at Tokyo Oka Kogyo, we intend to strengthen 
our development and commercialization efforts even further to 
enable the provision of more advanced machines that meet our 
customers' expectations.

  In the development of 0.25 Êm LSI, several SEM makers 
are 
introducing technology to measure circuit lines with high 
precision reaching 5nm. The technology is urgently needed, and 
each maker plans to incorporate it in its equipment. Since the 
problem of SEM surfaced through questionnaires conducted by 
SEMI, it was clear that SEM technology was urgently needed after 
0.35 Êm. In 0.35 Êm, 0.25 Êm technology will be 
incorporated. Each SEM maker will seek short term measurement 
for improvement, and will reduce the charge-up contamination. 
Some makers might attempt to lower voltage acceleration to less 
than 500 volts. In view of stability, this time mainly the TFE 
model electron gun will be employed for SEM. 
  Aiming at less than 5nm precision rendering measurement 
needed for manufacture of 0.25 Êm LSI represented by 256 
MDRAM, SEM makers will install technology for high precision 
measurement within 1994 (see figure 1 and figure 2.) Because low 
voltage is increasingly demanded, it is essential to reduce 
inconsistent measurement of line width, and improvement in high 
precision is urgently needed (see figure 3).

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-42A>      Figure 3. In Transistor, Influence From Inconsistent Gate </FIG>


  In order to improve the development of the technology, it is 
essential to understand the present status of measurement 
technology. For the purpose of standardizing the equipment, the 
SEMI Standardization Committee, which is the international 
organization for LSI manufacturers and material makers, 
distributed a questionnaires in Japan, U.S., and Europe between 
1992 and 1993. As a result, it was realized that even the 
existing technology of EB measurement will not be adequate to 
interface with high precision measurement (details will be 
discussed later). 
<H5>  Improvement For Rendering High Precision Measurement </H5>
Urgently Needed 
  It is said that in the era of 0.25 Êm, low 1 volt 
devices 
will be needed as notebook type personal computers and portable 
cellular phones are in great demand. Thus, it is necessary to 
reduce the tolerance level from 10% to ``5%'' in 
circuit line 
width (Engineer at NEC's R&amp;D Center - ULSI Devices). 
  In order to reduce the production of inconsistent line 
widths, lithography and etching processes must be controlled 
with high precision. And the problem of this kind ``will be 
solved by employing new processing technology'' (Process 
Engineer at Hitachi's R&amp;D Center). However ``improvement for 
precise measurement is rather urgently needed'' (Process 
Engineer at NEC's R&amp;D Center - ULSI Devices). In order to 
guarantee 5% tolerance of line width, high precision 
measurement of less than 5 nm must be obtained. 
<H5>  By Reducing Charge Up And Contamination, Measurement </H5>
Rendering 5 nm Is Sought 
  SEM makers have been working on the development of precision 
measurement with emphasis placed on (1) consistency for short 
term; and (2) consistency for mid term, in order to respond the 
needs of LSI makers. Within the year, SEM will be incorporated. 
<H5>  Consistency For Short Term Improved by Reduction Of Charge-Up </H5>
  For the developing site, the objective of (1) short term 
rendering measurement with about 30 repetition must be improved. 
For this reason, SEM makers have developed the technology in 
which line width is variably changed with a short period of 
time, and reduced (1) charge up and (2) pattern contamination. 
At present, especially Topcon of the EB Business Group is trying 
to reduce charge up which largely influences the quality of the 
image and processing. 
  For example Topcon succeeded in reducing the charge up by 
lowering the accelerating voltage to less than 500 V with 
secondary main power equipment. Since secondary electrons are 
captured from the very surface of the wafer, pattern edge 
necessary at the time of measurement and detailed image at the 
bottom surface of the pattern are obtained. Within the year, 
Topcon said, ``the development will achieve 3nm resolution and 
5nm (3 sigma) rendering measurement.'' 
  In order not to reduce the resolution even with low 
acceleration, a 500V/mm electrical field in the pattern part, 
and 1,000 gauss magnetic field are added, and the secondary 
electron beam coming from the bottom of pattern was collected 
efficiently. Also even with a low acceleration voltage, 
electromagnetic lens aberration is reduced to 1/5th. 
  On the other hand, a new comer, Nikon, came up with a new 
and 
unique method of employing electrically conductive gas in the 
chamber, and ``this is effective for reduction of charge up'' 
(Nikon SEM designer). Even with 3 kV, a relatively high 
acceleration voltage, charge up can be prevented, beam diameter 
can be narrowed to about 10 nm, and 5 nm resolution can be 
achieved. By improving the electromagnetic lens, they aim to 
achieve 5 nm rendering measurement. 
<H5>  Problem Of Pattern Contamination Suddenly Surfaced </H5>
  Pattern contamination also will influence the precision of 
rendering measurement. Traditionally, it was thought that 
distortion of direction of secondary electron beam by charge up 
causes this problem. However, because always line widths tend to 
increase regardless of negative or positive electrical load, it 
was pointed out that the problem is not because of distortion by 
observational electrons, but it is due to the formation of a 
wide pattern by contamination. 
  Hitachi is tackling the problem based on the notion that 
degassing from the wafer, and contaminants coming from a reverse 
direction, from the exhaust system are the cause. So, the 
problem is being solved by looking at the reduction of exhaust 
resistance, pump material, and structural design. From 
experience in the development of ultra high particle 
decomposition SEM that is quite sensitive to contamination, ``we 
know how to solve this problem'' (Hitachi). Hitachi is confident 
that it can solve this problem and indicates that the problem 
will be solved using the currently installed equipment. 
<H5>  Shifted To Radiation Model By Thermal Field Emission </H5>
  In a mass production line in which measurement is frequently 
done, the objective described in (2) above, mid term, about a 
day of rendering precision will become a problem. Quite a few 
LSI makers say that the problem is caused by cold field emission 
(CFE) from the electric gun. A flashing operation that cleans 
the surface of the electron gun with a large current may lower 
the consistency of measurement. At present, Hitachi's ``S-6000 
Series'' which has an 80% of market share in SEM, employs 
this 
CFE type. Each LSI maker now is considering the employment of 
thermal field emission (TFE) which does not require flashing. 
  Since the CFE model produces minimal spreading of the 
electron beam, it is advantageous for high resolution. Although 
at present this point is indisputable, at the time before and 
after flashing, the measured value fluctuates, and ``precision 
is lowered'' (process engineer at a major LSI maker). On the 
other hand, the TFE model is disadvantageous because of low 
resolution. 
  However it is said by SEM makers that employ TFE, that by 
improving the electromagnetic lens, resolution was ``improved 
more than that of CFE model.'' ``If data compatibility is 
disregarded, the model can be used right a way,'' said a major 
LSI maker which has a mass production line using the CFE model. 
  Responding to the needs of LSI makers, Hitachi finally plans 
to market TFE from 1994. Hitachi says, ``resolution has not yet 
reached the level of CFE,'' so the company will manufacture two 
models in parallel. However, for consistency level, ``main 
equipment will be shifted to TFE'' said Hitachi pointing to 
competitors.

  [Text] ``SEMI Standard Metrology Committee'' conducted 
questionnaires between June 1992, and December 1993 in Japan, 
Europe and U.S., to obtain the current status of precision 
measurement in LSI circuit lines (see table 1). 
  In order to maintain the secrecy of a person who responded 
to 
the questions, and to eliminate the presupposition, no name was 
required. In order to collect lively responses, quite a few 
descriptive responses were included. The survey using a real 
sample was conducted in 1992 by the U.S. SEMI, and although the 
real sample was not presented this time, an opinion about 
whether such a survey in Japan is possible or not was requested 
from the participants.

  Note: The purpose of the survey was to learn about solutions 
for future technology by defining the current measurement 
problems. Responses were returned from 64 departments (including 
multiple responses from a single company) such as LSI makers, 
equipment makers, material makers, and national organizations. 
As for regions, the numbers are: 44 from Japan; 14 from North 
America; and 6 from Europe. Sixty-four percent of responses are 
in regard to wafer measurment which makes up the major response. 
After studying the survey, wafer measurement became the focus of 
this discussion leaving the problem of the mask. The majority of 
responses were distributed as follows: 47% are from LSI 
related 
makers; 31% are from concerns in experimental 
productions; and 
11% are from the concerns in mass production. As for the 
equipment methodology, 56% employ the EB method, and 
35% 
employ the optical method leaving the EB method with a good 
lead. Eighty percent of EB method use is in development and 
experimental production. On the other hand, 68% of the 
optical 
application is used for research and development. And it is used 
widely in mass production. For price and ease of use, the 
optical method is still popular in mass production sites. 
  After collecting data from LSI makers, it became apparent 
that the present measurement capacity is not satisfactory, 
although EB will lead over the optical method (see figure 4). It 
was also clear that for the improvement in high precision and 
aspect ratio that: 
  (1) resolution including image contrast; 
  (2) rendering measurement; 
  (3) wafer charge up; 
  (4) measurement tolerance between equipment; 
  (5) improved throughput are needed (see table 2).

  Also the study made clear the environment in which 
measurement takes place and its methods are providing useful 
information (see figures 5 - 7). In addition, it was clear that 
there is a need to establish standardization including absolute 
dimension measurement (see figure 8).

<H5>  Importance Of Resolution, Precision And Reliability </H5>
  The problem of the EB method is divided into two problems. 
The first problem is to secure high resolution and precision 
measurement since minuteness and aspect ratios will become 
further advanced. The second problem is to obtain the easiness 
of measurement and reliability. 
  In the first problem, low image contrast as the pattern 
aspect ratio becomes high, and unstable image formation are 
important topics to study. These problems will fall in (1), (2) 
and (3) mentioned the above. Already the current equipment has a 
problem of measurement even if the EB method is employed, and a 
technological breakthrough is expected. 
  Especially in precision, there is a problem of rendering the 
measurement consistent with resolution. The technology extended 
to observation SEM is not solving the problem. The importance of 
developing a unique measurement technology is beginning to be 
realized by the makers. Therefore, improvement of 
electromagnetic lens, and for example, technology that was 
developed for stepper in order to improve the stage of static 
precision will be necessary. 
  The problem of charge up will become serious after 0.35 
Êm. 
Although the problem is at present resolved by the control of 
voltage acceleration, as pattern increases its minuteness, the 
problem will become more severe. A technology comparable to the 
optical method which can manipulate and reduce charge-up will be 
needed. 
  The second problem will fall in (4) and (5) described the 
above. Especially the problem of absolute base for measurement 
is surfacing. Deviation of dimension measurement between 
equipment is still a problem. However the problem may be solved 
by each maker employing a certain measurement base. At present, 
a sample of absolute measurement is conducted at the MITI's 
industrial technology measurement research center. 
  Also there are quite a few places in the equipment which 
require maintenance and this will influence throughput. From now 
on, automatic adjustment will increase the operational 
efficiency, and improvement on easy to use interface functions 
for users is essential. 
<H5>  In EB Method, Linear Approximation Mainly Employed </H5>
  In the questionnaire, in order to clarify the problem of 
measurement, the current measurement environment and method were 
investigated. In terms of measurement environment, it was clear 
that there are some differences between the method employed by 
Japan and the method employed by the U.S. and Europe (see figure 
5). In order to establish high precision and stable equipment, 
standardization of environment will become important. Also, in 
terms of the measurement method, measuring the bottom of the 
pattern with linear approximation by the EB method is common 
(see figure 6). 
  First of all in the measurement environment, for set up 
temperature 60% answered 23ÎC in Japan, but in the 
U.S. and 
Europe the value was 2 to 3Îless. Also in Japan, there are 
quite a few cases where the control is done with +/- 1 to 
2ÎC. In the U.S. and Europe control tends to be more 
stringent than that. Compared to temperature, humidity has a 
wide distribution. A range from 50% with a variation of + 
or - 
10% is quite common, but the control range is more or less 
stringent. 
  Thus, the equipment environment differs greatly 
geographically, and the auxiliary function to correct equipment 
will be needed in the system. Also it is necessary to guarantee 
that with a wide range of temperature and humidity, that 
auxiliary functions will not be placed in the process line. As 
the equipment environment is standardized, establishing the 
guaranteed range, looking at the practical situation, is the way 
to promote performance improvement and price reduction. 
  Next, status of use looking at the rendering measurement at 
the site, measurement position, algorithm for determining the 
measurement, and pattern formation will be discussed. 
  In rendering the measurement, by the experiment in which EB 
method and optical method are employed and distributed in the 
center of 15 nm and 30 nm with 3 (sigma), it was clear that EB 
method is superior to the optical method. In measurement 
position, the bottom pattern is 58% which is quite high 
in the 
case where the EB method is employed. In optical method, the 
threshold value is 63%. 
  This is because in the EB method, with the second generation 
electrons from the bottom of the pattern or part of pattern, and 
also the intensity ratio of reflection electrons, image contrast 
is determined, it is considered that detection of bottom pattern 
is easy. On the other hand, in the optical method, dispersion of 
light intensity at the edge is strong, and from the threshold 
value at the edge part, it is necessary to measure empirically 
the bottom dimension. 
  Since the algorithm to determine the measurement point will 
influence the precision of measurement, the makers as well as 
users must apply their various know-how. The reason why linear 
approximation is used, is that the method is simple and it can 
capture the bottom pattern. Also the threshold value is used 
with extension of the optical method. 
  Adjustment of equipment is important to maintain the 
precision measurement for a long time, and 92%, a total 
of 48 
people responded excluding the response of no comments, answered 
that they are employing some method of adjustment (see figure 
7). The frequency of adjustment is once a day or once a week, 
and most of users are doing it by themselves. For adjustment, a 
sample base is used, which is frequently made by the users 
themselves. 
<H5>  Base For Absolute Dimension Is Urgently Needed </H5>
  In addition to the current situation of measurement, the 
questionnaire included questions about the future 
standardization of dimension measurement. Some 85% 
excluding no 
comment, responded that absolute measurement is necessary (see 
figure 8). The importance of this is because of the need for 
compatibility of measurement between businesses such as 
production lines, research centers, and mass production plants, 
and data compatibility outside of companies such as the data 
used at academic presentations. 
  The deviation of design rules is reaching the level of 
influencing characteristics of LSIs. Absolute dimensional 
measurement is urgently needed after the 0.35 Êm LSI to 
increase the stability and efficiency of production and for the 
research and development of terminal devices.

  [Text] NEC has developed a RISC model MPU which operates at 
500 MHz. The product is a technology driver chip which 
incorporates new element technology in order to achieve a high 
speed architecture. NEC's developed architecture divides a 
pipeline. Each pipeline executes multiple commands 
simultaneously, and pipelines are further divided as processing 
time increases which accomplishes high speed processing. As for 
the element technology, from circuit and layout design, a high 
speed processor, high speed cache memory, high speed clock 
signal circuit, high speed clock signal distribution circuit, 
and a low noise and high speed interface circuit were developed. 
Low noise and high density standard cell layout were also 
developed. Thus a CMOS with 500 MHz, 0.4 Êm, and triple layer 
Al circuitry was developed. 
  The developed 32-bit RISC model MPU operates at 500 MHz. The 
developed MPU is a CMOS with 0.4 Êm triple layer Al 
circuitry. 
It is a technology driver chip which incorporates new element 
technology in order to come up with a high speed architecture. 
The product is named ``GALLOP (GHz-clock Applicable Logic and 
Layout Octpipeline Processor.'' 
  The high speed architecture which operates at 500 MHz 
divides 
the pipelines. Each pipeline executes multiple commands 
simultaneously, depending on the calculation time. The 32-bit 
data path is organized with eight pipeline levels. 
<H5>  New Technology Is Incorporated In Architecture, Circuit, And </H5>

  Previously NEC had developed a high speed processor operable 
at 200 MHz which was introduced initially, and next a 250 MHz, 
and then 300 MHz model (see figure 1). The ``SSSP (Super 
High-Speed Signal Processor)'' is the high speed signal 
processor that was developed in 1989. It placed a 16-bit 
arithmetic processor operating at 200 MHz on board. After that, 
``VSP3 (Video Signal Parallel Pipelined Processor)'' was 
developed and operated at 300 MHz. Those devices were made using 
bi-CMOS technology. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-50A>      Figure 1. RISC Model MPU High Frequency Trend </FIG>

  For example, Alpha by DEC uses 0.75 Êm CMOS. 
Additionally, 
with 1 Êm multi-crystal Si emitter ECL bi-polar process, a 
32-bit MPU can be operated with 115 W and 300 MHz. MPU high 
speed is realized by using a RISC architecture. To achieve this 
high performance, a technology to produce a high speed clock is 
most important. 
&lt;annot&gt; Key: 1. Operational Frequency (MHz); 2. The developed 
product introduced this time; 3. Year of Introduction.&lt;/graphic&gt; 

  However, it is essential from now on to establish high speed 
CMOS technology in order to make a low voltage and low cost 
devices. For this reason, a RISC chip operable at 500 MHz was 
developed for the purpose of determining the speed limit of CMOS 
technology and establishing element technology which is 
indispensable for future high speed MPUs. 
  The developed high speed architecture incorporates the basic 
features of RISC that can process multiple commands 
simultaneously, and additionally pipelines are divided when the 
time to calculate is too long. At a concrete level, computing 
element that takes a longer time, instruction cache, and data 
cache are organized in two levels of pipeline. The register file 
that takes a short computing time is in the first level 
pipeline. As a result, data path is organized with 8 levels of 
pipeline (see figure 2). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-50B>      Figure 2. Developed RISC Architecture </FIG>


<H5>  Also Employs High Frequency Speed Internally </H5>
  As an architecture consideration, the external interface 
executes at a lower frequency than the internal frequency. 
Although the internal clock is 500 MHz, external clock can be 
lowered to 62.5 - 250 MHz. Since the chip packaging and printed 
circuit board have longer wiring and have large load and 
inductance, the solution to transmit a high frequency signal was 
studied. The 62.5 - 250 MHz external signal was twice, four 
times, and eight times propagated in PLL (Phase Locked Loop) 
circuit. Adjusting to the internal high speed, the instruction 
cache and data cache have 1 K byte capacity. 
  Discussion of the circuit technology developed in element 
and 
layout technology follows next. The topics include: computing 
element; cache memory; clock signal generator; clock signal 
distributor circuit; interface circuit; and standard cell layout. 
<H5>  Computing Element: Two Levels Of Pipeline Organization </H5>
  Since the computation occur at 500 MHz, a pipeline that runs 
at 2 ns is organized with two levels. The reason why the 
pipeline stage is divided into two levels is because of 
difficulty of processing addition calculations with one clock 
cycle of 2 ns in one level. 
  In a 32-bit processor, adder, barrel shifter, and logic 
processor are placed on board as an element technology. As an 
adder, BLC (Binary Look ahead Carry) that has a good reputation 
for video processing, and as a barrel shifter, a transfer gate 
model selector are employed. 
<H5>  Cache: Two Levels Same As Computing Element </H5>
  Since cache memory operates at 500 MHz, the same as the 
computing element, a 2 ns pipeline stage is organized with two 
levels. At one level, address decode is performed, and at the 
second level, signal is read and amplified, and a 22 bit tag 
memory is compared with the address. In order to realize 2 ns 
high speed, as for the element technology in cache memory, the 
address decoder, pipeline register, and comparater are generated 
by dynamic circuit design. As a result, the register part is 
made small to 100 ps, which is 1/4th smaller than the 
traditional register. And comparater speed is enhanced by 
30%. 
  Cache memory uses 4 words as one block, date write is done 
by 
the write-back method, and the rewriting algorithm employs a 
direct mapping method. Rewriting is processed by a bus circuit 
control with one block unit. 
<H5>  Clock Generator Circuit: Low Jitter PLL Developed </H5>
  In order to maintain stable operation at 500 MHz, a low 
jitter PLL circuit was developed. The PLL circuit consists of a 
Phase Detector which detects the phase shift, Loop Filter which 
converts the result of the phase shift to voltage, Voltage 
Controlled Oscillator which controls oscillation frequency by 
the loop filter output voltage, and a Counter which divides the 
output oscillation signal. 
  In order for the loop filter to run stably at 500 MHz, a 
differential amplifier was employed. By this, PLL circuit 
frequency stability was improved greatly. Traditionally a loop 
filter used the invertor which is placed on the video processor 
board. Because of this, with relation to the threshold value of 
MOS transistor, a deadband existed, and the frequency was 
shifted greatly. This time because a differential amplifier was 
employed which eliminated deadband, high stability was realized. 
From circuit simulations, it was verified that jitter was 
controlled to 15%. Offset problems caused by the 
differential 
amplifier were solved by feedback. Also for a counter, a dynamic 
circuit was employed and 1 GHz operation was realized. 
<H5>  Clock Distribution Circuit: Skew Was Reduced By Shortening </H5>
The Layer 
  In order for the clock signal distribution circuit to run at 
500 MHz, for the clock signal phase difference, the short 
circuit method by which each layer level was shortened to reduce 
clock skew was employed. The driver was distributed like a tree, 
and then the driver output of each layer level was short 
circuited, and skew correction was added (see figure 3). If the 
distance between the clock driver is 4mm and input skew is 0.2 
ns, then output skew can be reduced by half, 0.1 ns, by the 
short circuit of each driver distance. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-51A>      Figure 3. Developed Clock Tree Layer Short Circuit </FIG>


  On the other hand, for a part of memory and random logic, 
the 
driver can not be laid out like a tree. In that case, the clock 
signal was supplied by using a large driver. At some point in 
the output buffer to supply the clock, capacity to adjust skew 
was installed, and by laser trimming, delay time was sensitively 
adjusted. 
<H5>  Interface Circuit: Low Noise With 1V Oscillation Width </H5>
  In the interface circuit, a maximum 250 MHz external clock 
signal can be transmitted. Moreover, the circuit that eliminates 
nose generated by the interface circuit by itself was developed. 
That consists of an input buffer circuit and an output buffer 
circuit (see figure 4). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-52A>      Figure 4. Input and Output Buffer Circuit Developed forFigure 4. Input and Output Buffer Circuit Developed for </FIG>


  The input circuit buffer is configured with the combination 
of a variable invertor circuit. Noise was controlled by terminal 
resistors placed at the input terminals and connector terminals. 
Terminal resistors are organized with 4 nMOSUs which have 
different channel widths and are connected with parallel. An 
externally supplied 4 bit signal turns these four nMOSUs on and 
off. When the input buffer circuit characteristics are changed, 
noise can be controlled by adjusting resistor values at the 
terminal resistors. Reflection caused by improper adjustment of 
impedance at bonding wires and packaging will also be eliminated 
by the terminal resistors. 
  However, if the terminal resistor is built-in, chip power 
consumption becomes larger. To solve this problem, signal 
oscillation width in the input and output buffer circuit is 
controlled to a low, 0 - 1V. At 0V, power is not consumed. 
However if the reference terminal is lowered to 0.5V, then it 
will cause a problem by being influenced from the ground 
potential difference. For this problem, power source wiring was 
strengthened at the layout design, and the fluctuation of 
electrical potential was controlled. 
  Output signal level at output buffer circuit is determined 
by 
ratio between pMOS on-resistor and terminal resistor. 
  On the other hand, in the output buffer circuit, a 
momentarily large current will flow when multiple circuits are 
operated simultaneously. To solve this problem, the circuit is 
divided in two groups, and the current peak was distributed over 
two levels. For layers having different clock trees, the time 
difference was maintained, so that the clock signal is given to 
the register. The peak time difference is about 0.4 ns, and it 
is not a problem practically. Delay time of both input buffer 
circuit and output buffer circuit are quite small, 0.3 ns. 
  The interface circuit has a function to adjust phase shift 
with an external system. That is a synchronous interface 
circuit. By including a circuit to control interface delay time, 
system skew is reduced. 
<H5>  Layout: About 50% High Density Achieved </H5>
  In layout design, transistor density was increased by 
50%, 
and new standard cell layout which intensely controls noise in 
the power source was developed (see figure 5). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-53A>      Figure 5. Developed High Density, Low Noise Layout </FIG>


  A simple method to achieve a high speed CMOS circuit is to 
use a short channel length transistor. In addition, if the 
wiring is minute, then capacity will be larger. Thus improvement 
of transistor drive capacity is needed. For this reason, if 
transistor width is increased, then transistor density is 
lowered at the time of layout, wiring length is increased and 
wiring capacity gets larger. To solve this dilemma, a high 
density layout was developed this time. 
  High density was achieved by using the first level Al pole, 
and wiring between cells was connected by a second and third 
level Al. In the traditional layout, a region to connect at the 
outside of a cell is necessary, but this time the layout does 
not require that region. Second level Al is passed through at 
the top of the cell, and 17 lines at the second level Al are 
passed through at the cell 48 Êm in height. 
  This time using a standard cell, a 32-bit adder was laid 
out, 
and 10,210 transistors per mm[.sup]2[/] were integrated, 
which is 50% more than the traditional model. 
<H5>  Layout: Low Noise With Stack Model Wiring </H5>
  Low noise was achieved by the development of a stack model 
power source wiring layout. First, in order to supply a stable 
power source, impedance was controlled, and the principle, 
Rnoise must be shut off at the closest point to where the noise 
is generatedS was followed. Impedance was controlled at the 
merging layer of the first level Al and the second level Al. 
That is because the area and resistance of power source wiring 
and connecting wiring can be made small. 
  The reduction of noise was achieved by the stack model power 
source wiring, in which large area of nMOS is established under 
the power source wiring. The nMOS formed by using a polyside 
layer becomes a bypass condenser, about 0.027 ÊF, which 
functionally controls noise. The peripheral area of PLL circuit 
is covered by stack model power source wiring, and shielded from 
the digital circuit that would be a source of other noise. In 
addition, to avoid the influence of noise, the power source for 
the digital circuit and the power source for the PLL circuit are 
separated. 
<H5>  PLL Circuit Establishes Independent Power Source Pad </H5>
  In the developed overall chip layout, the database is placed 
on the right side, and the data cache and instruction cache are 
placed on the left side. The register file is placed on the data 
path. Two cache memories are divided into blocks of cache body 
and a tag part in order to make the layout area small. 
  The control circuit and PLL circuit placed on the right side 
of the data path are surrounded by 200-240 Êm width power 
source wiring and connecting wiring. The PLL circuit that uses 
an analog signal is surrounded by stack model power source 
wiring and also an independent power source pad is placed there. 
The pad around the chip is spaced 140 Êm horizontally, and 
150 
Êm vertically, and 180 pieces are laid out.

  [Text] Mitsubishi Electric Corporation's Optical Microwave 
Device Laboratory has developed a high selectivity ratio etching 
technology that can be applied to dimensions as small as 0.1fm 
for the purpose of precisely controlling the element current 
required for high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) 
performance on an indium-phosphorus (InP) substrate. They 
incorporated this technology with with one for growing an 
aluminum-indium-arsenide (AlInAs)/indium-gallium-arsenide 
(InGaAs) crystal on an InP substrate, and succeeded in 
developing a high-performance, low-noise InP-based millimeter 
wave (60GHz) HEMT that achieves a noise index of 0.9dB and a 
gain of 7.0dB at 60GHz. The frequency bands of high density 
telecommunications transmissions are converting to millimeter 
waves from microwaves. The HEMT used in the receiving components 
of telecommunications equipment impact the overall performance 
of telecommunications systems, and the HEMT recently developed 
by MELCO should be capable of responding to the low-noise, 
high-gain requirements of the millimeter wave band. 
  The focus of this development project was twofold: 1) to 
optimize the AlInAs/InGaAs growth conditions on the InP 
substrate, and 2) to develop an etching technology with a high 
selectivity ratio. 
  An InGaAs single crystal suitable for high-speed, low-noise 
HEMT can be grown better on an InP substrate than on a GaAs 
substrate, and in order to achieve a low-noise, high-gain HEMT, 
must feature high electron carrier concentration and high 
electron mobility in the operating layer. In their recent 
development project, MELCO utilized molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) 
to optimize growth conditions for the lattice-conforming 
AlGaAs/InGaAs epitaxial layer, and used this layer to create a 
HEMT. This approach enabled them to enhance carrier 
concentration by roughly two-fold and mobility by approximately 
1.5-fold over conventional GaAs-substrate HEMT.

  Also, in order to realize a high-performance HEMT, it is 
necessary to form a recess (groove) in the substrate crystal by 
etching only that portion of the n-InGaAs contact layer required 
to form an electrode in the top layer of i-AlInAs. But because 
this layer is extremely thin, measuring just several hundred 
thick, a high precision etching technology was needed to 
determine element current. MELCO therefore concentrated on the 
AlInAs layer oxidation reaction portion of the etching process, 
and by optimizing the compounding ingredients and ratios of the 
etching agent, developed a technology capable of selectively 
etching only the n-InGaAs layer to form a 0.15fm gate electrode. 
This new etching technology made it possible to control the HEMT 
current value, and reduced current dispersion by 1/5. 
  To enhance HEMT performance, it is essential to lower 
capacity and enlarge effective cross section by shortening the 
gate length and reducing the contact area of the crystal 
surface, thereby reducing gate resistance. By optimizing 
epitaxial layer growth conditions, developing a high selectivity 
ratio etching technology and utilizing 0.15fm T-gate electrode 
formation techniques, MELCO was able to form a HEMT with a 
world-leading noise index of 0.9dB and gain of 7.0dB at 60GHz.

  [Text] In the ULSI multi interlayer wiring process, it has 
been realized again that leveling the interlayer insulating film 
is an important aspect of the technology. Traditionally, in 
exposure of wiring pattern on insulation film, level differences 
occur making it necessary to estimate the focus depth. Or in 
some situations, highly complicated techniques such as phase 
shift or the grazing incidence method were necessary. Leveling 
the interlayer insulating film was allowing some margin in 
achieving the goals of exposure technology. 
  For leveling the interlayer insulating film, several 
technologies such as automatic CVD leveling or CVD leveling by 
bias ECR used in TEOS-O[.sub]3[/] have been suggested and 
used actively. However, none of the technologies has yet come up 
with the complete leveling which can interface with high 
precision and integration. This is because the technology in CVD 
and etching do not principally have the capability of 
controlling the formation in a direction perpendicular to a 
convex and recessed surface. On the other hand the mechanical 
grinding discussed here has a possibility of easily realizing 
complete surface leveling. The principle is simply based on the 
selective polishing of the convex area, since efficiency of 
polishing depends on the contact pressure with grinding granules 
and contact time, that is, the selection ratio with a recessed 
area is quite high. Grinding technology for insulating films is 
not only applied to the interlayer, but also applied for element 
separation in poly-Si deposition, contact, bare hole, and metal 
film grinding in LSI processing. However, LSI process technology 
is dry, and it is based on low particle density technology. Thus 
there is a problem of employing technology used for wet grinding 
with fine granules. Also since the grinding is not for simple 
leveling traditionally practiced in Si baseboard, there are 
practical problems that occur in grinding the convex and 
recessed surface with several kinds of patterns. In this report, 
a grinding pad that will solve the problem that occurs in 
leveling the interlayer insulating film, and practical examples 
of grinding equipment are discussed. 
<H5>  High Precision Grinding Technology For Leveling Interlayer </H5>
Insulating Film 
  1. Grinding Pad 
  In early LSI production, grinding for leveling the 
interlayer 
has used a pad with abrasive material, and equipment that was 
used with traditional Si baseboards. In order to avoid defects 
or scratches in grinding the Si crystal baseboard, a soft pad 
was used. If this method is applied to an interlayer film with 
recessed and convex areas, the pad is pressed with pressure, so 
that the recessed area as well as the convex area which is the 
necessary part to grind are affected. Therefore leveling is not 
achieved effectively as seen in figure 1. In order to achieve 
leveling effectively, some thickness of insulating film on metal 
wiring must be secured. The initial film thickness is quite 
large, and grinding takes considerable time. On the other hand, 
if a harder pad is used, as seen in figure 2, because selective 
grinding of the convex area rather than the recessed area is 
emphasized, then because of the difference in Si baseboard curve 
and the thickness of the baseboard, the interlayer insulating 
film after grinding is not consistent, and the wiring pattern 
will be partially exposed. From these observations, it became 
apparent that uniform grinding must be based on the curved area 
and thickness of the Si baseboard, that is, the surface to 
receive the grinding. Figure 3 shows a high performance pad 
configuration that will be required for grinding. The small 
divided area is a hard resin, and each small area is supported 
by a flexible body, and high performance can be obtained. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-55A>      Figure 1. Grinding By Soft Pad </FIG>



<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-55B>      Figure 2. Grinding By Hard Pad </FIG>



<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-56A>      Figure 3. Grinding By The Suggested New Pad </FIG>


  In order to reduce the inconsistent and ineffective grinding 
by abrasive material, it is important that good consistency 
should be achieved by the exchange of pads, not by a complex 
technique. 
  2. Abrasive Material 
  The reason why the CMP (Chemical Mechanical Polishing) is 
used in naming the grinding of interlayer insulating film of 
SiO[.sub]2[/] is not clear. However, in the grinding of 
ECR-CVD film which is very close to heat oxide film in quality, 
it has been found that by changing the grinding fluid to pH 
7-11, grinding performance is doubled as seen in figure 4. Since 
the film surface will not change even when the film is dipped in 
pH 11 mild alkaline fluid for long time, it is apparent that the 
combined effect of chemistry and machinery will have some impact 
on the grinding mechanism. Basically, SiO[.sub]2[/] group 
film becomes quite active for bonding to OH baseboard when 
pressure and temperature are increased, and it resolves well 
with water. There is another conceivable method in which the 
surface that is activated by machine with fine granules is 
bonded with the OH baseboard producing a surface with different 
characteristics that will be ground mechanically with abrasive 
material. Also, mutual reaction of both abrasive material and 
grinding surface can be considered. Especially since some 
granules such as CeO[.sub]2[/] have high performance in 
grinding, and it is projected that strong bonding with the 
surface granules of interlayer of CeO[.sub]2[/] and 
SiO[.sub]2[/] exists. Therefore bonding between granule 
material and surface characteristics will contribute to the 
efficiency of grinding. But also it is necessary to consider 
that cleaning after grinding in this process will become quite 
difficult. For abrasive material, in order not to cause 
mechanical damage, a soft material equivalent to that of the 
interlayer insulation film, consistent in granule diameter, with 
good dispersion in mild alkaline solution, and low metal 
impurity content is desired. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-56B>      Figure 4. Grinding Fluid pH Value and Grinding Speed </FIG>


  3. Grinding Equipment 
  Even when a pad which is suitable for leveling of the 
interlayer and overall leveling of the Si baseboard is used, 
unless the equipment can perform with consistency and can grind 
with high throughput, as a manufacturing technology, it is 
meaningless. Figure 5 shows equipment for a single piece 
operation, and figure 6 shows equipment for a batch operation. 
Both models are different from the regular grinding base which 
is usually installed in the lower part, and supports the Si 
baseboard in the upper part. The base unit for grinding is 
installed at a precision rotating table, at the side of the Si 
base support, avoiding the grinding base (pad) which enables set 
up conditions to be easily changed. Although it is 
disadvantageous to supply abrasive material on the grinding 
surface, it reduced the occurrence of grinding granules stacked 
and filled in the surface of pad. Also, since the surface of the 
Si baseboard is upward, and the supporting table is high 
precision, it makes it advantageous to determine the end point 
after completion of grinding. Figure 6 shows the batch model 
which can process 5 baseboards at one time. While the small 
tables supporting the Si baseboards are rotated, the large table 
by the rotation of each small table is made to rotate. For this 
reason, the average efficiency for processing 5 baseboards which 
move in relation to the positions in the grinding equipment and 
grinding base, is quite high. And within batch processing and 
between batch processing are maintained quite uniformly. Also 
the table for Si baseboards is installed with high precision and 
durability, so that the grinding operation is stable even with 
high rotation and high load and it can be expected to have good 
leveling throughput. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-56C>      Figure 5. Single Piece High Precision Grinding Equipment </FIG>



<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-57A>      Figure 6. Five-Piece Batch Model Si Baseboard Grinding </FIG>


  4. Examples of Grinding Leveling Interlayer Insulating 
Film 
  Examples of grinding are demonstrated here by using the 
grinding pad shown in figure 3 and the equipment shown in figure 
5. The pattern is made for this example, and on 3-100 Êm Al 
wiring, with ECR-CVD, and a1.8 Êm SiO[.sub]2[/] film is 
formed. With bias CVD by ECR it is possible to deposit in a 
narrow space and in fine wiring lines, as shown in figure 7. At 
the time of CVD, good leveling is achieved and only a triangular 
convex region is left. Figure 8 shows an example of leveling the 
insulating film with a pattern: (a) is the example of hard and 
soft layers of grinding pad. In the region of wiring width of 3 
Êm, grinding progresses quite faster than with a 100 Êm 
wide 
pattern, and the Al wiring part is exposed when a wide area is 
ground to a certain level of thickness of the interlayer 
insulating film. On the other hand (b) is the example of 
grinding in the image of figure 3. Level differences for both is 
less than 0.05 Êm and leveling is achieved without any 
dependence on pattern density. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-57B>      Figure 7. Cross Section Of Interlayer Insulating Film </FIG>



<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-58A>      Figure 8. Pattern Formation After Grinding </FIG>


  On the other hand figure 9 is the result of measurement 
along 
four lines of formation before and after grinding the Si 
baseboard. Although the overall baseboard has 5-6 Êm size 
large convex and recessed areas, about 1 Êm grinding amount 
is 
obtained in all directions, and it shows that the pad in figure 
3 is effective in realizing leveling of both the convex and 
recessed areas, and global leveling (uniform leveling in overall 
baseboard) is achieved. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-59A>      Figure 9. Cross Section Of Wafer Before and After Grinding </FIG>


  In grinding by the batch method (5 pieces) in figure 6, 
after 
0.5 Êm grinding, between batches, film thickness distribution 
is +/- 3%, and batch distribution is +/- 5%. 
  Cleaning after grinding the baseboard is important since it 
will influence the decision to employ a leveling grinding 
process. In the mass production type grinding equipment shown in 
figure 6, a scrubber is attached which can clean 5 pieces right 
after the grinding, and unloaded wet pieces are transferred to 
the connected cleaning equipment. The dedicated cleaning 
equipment includes a mega-sonic shower operated at both sides 
simultaneously, a scrubber operated at both sides 
simultaneously, a front and back separate scrubbing shower, and 
a drying station. Over 0.2 Êm particles are realized with 
less 
than 20 pieces within the baseboard. 
<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  For the technology of leveling the multiple interlayer 
insulating film in LSIs, developed examples including pads for 
the grinding operation, abrasive materials, and grinding 
equipment, which are not dependent on the inconsistent pattern 
or size, large or small, enable the entire surface to be 
leveled. A unique configuration and method are employed 
considering the formation and material that are different from 
the traditional Si crystal baseboard. The objective is about to 
be realized. Furthermore, responding to the suggestions of new 
device organizations and processes, higher precision and higher 
performance are our goals.

Headquarters] 
  [Text] Hitachi has demonstrated the cost effectiveness of 
electron beam (EB) direct-writers in mass production of 
large-scale integrated (LSI) circuits. After evaluating with a 
cost-of-ownership (COO) model, which formulated facility 
investments and cost-effectiveness of their operations into 
equations, the above conclusion was reached to dispel the 
prejudice of LSI manufacturers that ``EB direct writers are too 
expensive to be used in mass production of LSI circuits.'' 
According to this evaluation, DRAMs and ASICs [application 
specific ICs] can be manufactured cheaper by hybrid usage of EB 
direct writers and steppers than using steppers only. 
  The evaluation led to the following conclusions. Hybrid 
usage 
of steppers and EB direct writers, which are based on the 
cell-projection technology, will be more cost effective for the 
production of memories smaller than 0.25 micron. Also, the cost 
of masks for steppers will unexpectedly increase for the 
production of many varieties but small quantities of ASICs 
smaller than 0.5 micron, and hence EB direct writers will become 
more cost effective. 
<H5>  [Introduction] </H5>
  We have shown that memory chips smaller than 0.25 micron and 
ASICs smaller than 0.5 micron can be manufactured cheaper by 
hybrid usage of EB direct writers and steppers than using 
steppers only. Also, we have confirmed that, to reduce the 
manufacturing cost of LSI circuits, it is more effective to 
improve throughput and MTBF [mean time between failure] rather 
than reducing the price of EB direct writers. These conclusions 
were obtained[.sup]1[/] through comparisons and evaluations 
using an American COO model (Footnote 1) based on a cost of 
ownership concept, which formulates facility investments and 
cost-effectiveness of operations into equations. 
  Footnote 1. Formulas were mostly based on the COO model used 
by SEMATECH of the United States, but a model recognized by an 
academic society was used for portions specific to EB writers. 
Mostly published data were used in the formulas. We asked for 
the opinion of domestic manufacturers of LSI circuits and masks 
other than Hitachi on the data on phase-shift masks, the KrF and 
ArF excimer technology and on the data specific to EB writers 
for comparison. 
  First, we briefly outline the COO model and the way EB 
writers are used. Then, we show that hybrid usage of EB direct 
writers and steppers are cost effective (a) in the mass 
production of DRAMs and (b) in the large variety but small 
quantity production of ASICs. Finally, we describe the 
effectiveness of mask writers. 
<H5>  Discussions Held on a Common Ground </H5>
  A COO model uses equations to evaluate cost-effectiveness 
based on the expenses of a certain equipment until its useful 
life is reached. These expenses are calculated from the 
equipment price, its productivity, reliability and yield. A COO 
model derives the cost of each wafer manufactured. 
  The purpose of deriving such a COO value is to establish a 
common ground for discussions between users and manufacturers by 
unifying the evaluation standards for cost-effectiveness of 
equipment and materials. The COO value can also be used as a 
guideline for setting priorities in improving equipment or 
selecting targets for cost reduction. 
  In the past, there was no unified model and the users and 
manufacturers of an equipment used different methods to evaluate 
the cost-effectiveness of the equipment. Hence sometimes they 
failed to obtain an appropriate evaluation depending on what the 
users wanted. However, the evaluation standards now can be 
unified by using a COO model and its results, thus opening the 
opportunity of discussing on a common ground (Footnote 2). 
  Footnote 2. One of the advantages of a COO model is that the 
model can highlight problems inherent in an equipment or a 
manufacturing line by changing evaluation parameters. For 
instance, a model can identify the required balance between the 
reliability and the price of an equipment, response to 
manufacturing 8-inch wafers including the effect of the 
equipment price, the relation between the depreciation of an 
equipment and investment effectiveness, and the relation between 
the appropriate number of equipment and the size of clean rooms. 
<H5>  Three Ways to Use [EB Writers] </H5>
  The usage of EB writers is divided into three broad 
categories (Table 1): 
  (1) All layers are directly written by an EB writer; 
  (2) Hybrid usage with steppers (Footnote 3); 
  (3) Used only for making masks. 



  Table 1. Usage of EB writers. The usage of EB writers is divided into three 
broad categories. The host materials mentioned in the table are those for 
optical exposure. 

Usage of EB writers         Objects to be        Amount to be      Methods to 
                            written              manufactured      be

Memory       Large amount   Steppers, 
                            excimers, X-rays 


  In the conventional mix-and-match method (Editor's Footnote 
1) among steppers, such as the g-line and i-line, high precision 
steppers were used for critical layers but low-cost, high-speed 
equipment were used for noncritical layers. As a result, 
production cost was reduced. However, when the design rule is 
shorter than 0.35 micron, difficulties remain in the overlapping 
precision between steppers and the compensation for distorted 
images. These difficulties can be solved by using method (2) in 
which steppers are used for noncritical layers and EB direct 
writers for critical layers. 
  Editor's Footnote 1: The method to mix-and-match steppers 
has 
aggressively been adopted by Hitachi. Few other companies use 
this method. 
  In deriving a COO value, we have used the COO model 
developed 
by SEMATECH of the United States. We have adopted the standard 
values used by SEMATECH as input data. For fair comparisons, we 
asked for advice from other LSI and mask manufacturers on input 
data for steppers, such as phase-shift masks and the KrF and ArF 
excimer technology. All amounts were expressed in dollars, using 
an exchange rate of &yen;100 to $1. 
  The obtained results conclude that hybrid usage of EB direct 
writers, which are based on the cell-projection technology, is 
cost-effective in manufacturing memory [chips with rules] under 
0.25 micron, and EB direct writers are cost-effective in 
manufacturing ASICs [with rules] under 0.5 micron. The actual 
calculations of the COO values were carried out for mass 
production of DRAMs, large variety but small quantity production 
of ASICs, and for fabrication of masks. 
<H5>  Hybrid Usage Is Cost-Effective for DRAMs </H5>
  First of all, our study has clearly indicated that hybrid 
usage is cost-effective for mass production of DRAMs (Figure 1). 
The reason for this conclusion is that the price of an EB writer 
does not change much even when very fine patterns are written, 
while the price of a stepper rises sharply. Another reason is 
that the cost of fabricating masks for phase shift masks and KrF 
excimer masks increases because auxiliary masks are needed. The 
basic parameters for hybrid usage are listed in Tables 2 and 3. 
The COO values to manufacture DRAMs with 0.35 micron or smaller 
[rules] using steppers rapidly increase, and the development 
cost for steppers will increase to control the rising production 
cost. In contrast, hybrid usage of EB writer based on the 
cell-projection technology[.sup]6[/] is somewhat more 
cost-effective than using only steppers. We assumed in our 
calculation that optical exposure is possible down to 0.18 
micron. In practice, however, [the development of] KrF excimer 
stepper has not been completed and it is true that the outlook 
for ArF-based laser technology is uncertain.

<H5>  Mask Cost Is Reduced for Large Variety, Small Production LSIs </H5>
  Hybrid usage is cost-effective also for ASICs manufactured 
in 
small quantities but in large varieties, because of the 
increased cost of masks to match the increased type of products. 
A COO value for ASICs varies according to the quantity and type 
of products, and we have used cases for the production of 50,000 
and 1,000 units per months, and 60, 120 and 240 types of 
products. The basic parameters are the same as those listed in 
Table 3 for the case of 0.8-0.35 micron. 
  The variation of the COO value according to the type and 
quantity of products is shown in Figure 2. With steppers, the 
COO value barely changes even when the production quantity of a 
given device varies. On the contrary, the type of products 
affects the COO value very much; when the type of products 
doubles the COO value also nearly doubles. From the figure, we 
see that the COO value of an EB writer rises in proportion to 
the production quantity, but the rise is small. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-63A>      Figure 2. COO values as a function of the product types. </FIG>


  Next, we illustrate in Figure 3 what should be the target of 
an equipment manufacturer in trying to reduce its equipment 
cost. Even if the equipment cost is reduced, its COO value 
sharply increases when the throughput and MTBF [mean time 
between failures] is reduced (Table 4). One cannot develop an 
equipment without considering its throughput and MTBF. These 
items are more important than reducing the price of an equipment 
(Editor's Footnote 2). 
  Editor's Footnote 2: The research arm of Hitachi has 
requested that the equipment price be under ``&yen;300 million'' 
in the future. (See a related article in the September 1993 
issue of this magazine, pp. 54-59.)

<H5>  Improving MTBF Is Important in Fabricating Masks </H5>
  Although this is not a comparison to using a stepper, 
improving the MTBF is important in mask fabrication to gain 
better economy in the COO value of mask writers. Our calculation 
shows that the COO value can be reduced by maintaining the MTBF 
if the rising equipment price is controlled. 
  The production quantity was assumed to be one wafer per lot, 
and the equipment price and the MTBF were assumed to rise in 
fabricating phase-shift masks. On the other hand, we also have 
studied the case in which the rising price of an EB writer is 
controlled and a decrease in the MTBF is prevented as part of a 
company-wide effort (Table 5). The results for different 
generations of memory chips are illustrated in Figure 4.

  In our evaluation, we used 5-magnification reticles, but it 
becomes difficult to produce two pieces of 256M or 1G [memory 
chips] with 5-magnification reticles. For this reason, 
4-magnification reticles are being considered to prevent a 
decrease in throughput. In either case, however, the decisive 
factor in mask fabrication is how to prevent a decrease in 
throughput. 
<H5>  Unified Evaluation Standards for Cost-Effectiveness of </H5>
Investments and Operations of Equipment 
  The cost of ownership (COO) is a modeling concept for 
evaluation standards for the cost-effectiveness of facility 
investments and operations at the management level. SEMATECH of 
the United States is leading the development of the model. 
<H5>  Background and History </H5>
  The COO model originated from Intel Corporation of the 
United 
States in mid-eighties.[.sup]2[/] The Intel model was 
developed to serve as a quantitative evaluation standard for 
businesses in purchasing equipment. Later, this model was 
transferred to SEMATECH and has contributed to the construction 
of a model for the total production system. In 1991, the first 
article on COO was reported by R. Carnes and M. Su.[.sup]3[/] 
  Their COO analysis software was distributed to more than 600 
member companies of SEMATECH. Some LSI manufacturers are already 
using the model as an effective evaluation means to select 
equipment manufacturers. In addition, better training methods 
are being developed to understand the content of the COO model 
and to eliminate the differences between member companies, while 
SEMI [Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International] is 
standardizing the model.[.sup]4[/] 



<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-65A>      Figure A-1. Concept for COO calculation. Input parameters </FIG>


  Items listed in Figure A-1 are used in calculating the COO 
value. The ultimate goal is to form steps shown in Figure A-2 as 
the total-cost model and incorporate it into the COO analysis. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-65B>      Figure A-2. Total-cost model. The final goal is to form </FIG>


<H5>  Computational Method of the COO Model Proposed by SEMATECH </H5>
  The cost per wafer, $COO, is calculated from SEMATECH's COO 
model according to the following equation[.sup]3[/]: 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-65C>      EQUATION </FIG>


  Here, $F are the fixed costs, which include the cost of 
acquiring equipment, transportation cost, startup cost, 
installation cost and facility cost; $V are the variable costs, 
which include the cost of chemicals, gas, water and electricity, 
materials cost, labor cost (operating cost, technical fees, 
etc.), repair cost and the cost of consumables; L is the 
equipment life (depreciation life, technical life, usage life); 
TPT is the throughput (wafers/hour); Y(TPT) is the average yield 
of the equipment that affect throughput (throughput yield); U is 
the utilization rate (according to the definition E10-92 by 
SEMI, actual production time/effective time); and $Y are the 
yield loss costs. 
  This model accepts a wide range of input parameters. The 
model includes fixed costs ($F), such as the depreciation of the 
cost of acquiring equipment and facility cost. All depreciation 
periods are five years. Some of the input parameters are closely 
tied to production lines which must be clearly separated from 
the financial parts. 
<H5>  Equipment Yield and Yield Loss Costs </H5>
  The yield loss costs caused by defects are related to the 
average number of defects per wafer, the cost of scrapping 
defective wafers and the number of defective chips per wafer 
according to the following equation: 
  $Y=[W(TPT)x$P]+[W(D)x$T], 
  where W(TPT) is the number of defective wafers based on the 
throughput yield, W(D) is the number of defective wafers based 
on the defect limiting yield (losses beyond the limits of the 
defect density), $P is the cost of a wafer at the processing 
stage, and $T is the cost of test wafers. 
  The value of W(D) in the yield model is determined from the 
following equation: 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-65D>      EQUATION </FIG>


  Here, R is the number of wafers inserted per week, D is the 
physical defect density, L is the equipment life (week), A is 
the chip size (cm[.sup]2[/]), and P(f) is the loss 
probability. This probability, P(f), is the fraction of the 
critical pattern size within a chip area expressed as follows: 
  P(f)=X(m)[.sup]2[/]/[W(W+P)], 
  where X(m) is the minimum defect size, W is the minimum line 
width of the minimum gap between lines (micron), and P is the 
pitch (micron). These parameters depend on the process, the 
device type and the wafer diameter. 
<H5>  Production Utilization Rate </H5>
  The COO model is based on the total cost per wafer at the 
actual production time. In Figure B, we present the guidelines 
for the equipment status and time for E10-92 at 
SEMI.[.sup]5[/] According to the figure, the production 
utilization rate U is given by: 
  U=1-(SM+USM+TEST+TA+STBY)/168, 
  where SM is the scheduled maintenance time (hour/week); USM 
is the unscheduled maintenance time (hour/week); TEST is the 
production testing time (hour/week); TA is the total time 
(hour/week) for temporary assistance, such as an unexpected 
stopping of equipment that can be recovered in less than six 
minutes by human intervention; and STBY is the time needed for 
preparation. The following items are included in the scheduled 
and unscheduled maintenance time: MTBF which stands for the 
production time/number of failures; MTTR [maximum time to 
repair] which stands for the total repair time/number of 
failures; MTBA [mean time between assistance] which stands for 
the production time/number of [maintenance] assistance; and MTTA 
[mean time to accomplish] which stands for the average time for 
performing assistance. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-66A>      Figure B. Equipment status and time. </FIG>


  Throughput is an important component in a COO model. 
Throughput is affected by the MTBF, MTTR, MTBA, MTTA and the 
production testing time. For instance, the throughput for and EB 
[writer] is calculated from the above parameters and the time 
for job setup, the time for loading and unloading of a wafer, 
stage transfer time, alignment time and the number of shots. 
  The maintenance cost is small, but plays an important role 
in 
the total wafer cost. The costs for which most attention should 
be paid are unscheduled maintenances, service contracts, spare 
parts, tests not covered under warranty and labor costs for 
repairs.

  [Text] The Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute (JAERI, 
Director, Shozo Shimomura) announced on the 3rd that they have 
developed a slightly enriched uranium fuel which generates the 
same neutrons as 45% intermediately enriched uranium 
fuel. It 
is called a silicide fuel (silica uranium dispersed aluminum 
alloy = 4.8 grams/cm[.sup]3[/] uranium density) with 20% 
enrichment [.sup]235[/]U. The 26 day-operation of the JAERI's 
Japan Material Test Reactor (JMTR) using the new fuel 
reconfirmed its applicability. Up to now, above 90% 
enriched 
fuels have been used in test/research reactors, but, as a result 
of the international nuclear fuel cycle evaluation, and in line 
with nonproliferation policy, the world is moving toward reduced 
enrichment of less than 20%. This latest research 
achievement 
is in line with this worldwide target, making the latest efforts 
by the JMTR for slight enrichment 19th in the world, while 
achieving the world's highest neutron flux 
(4x10[.sup]14[/]/second/cm[.sup]2[/]). This accomplishment 
will boost efforts for slight enrichment of fuels for test and 
research reactors throughout the world. 
  JAERI has been working on the slight enrichment program 
since 
1977. In 1986, they developed a 45% enriched fuel through 
converting a 93% enriched [.sup]235[/]U fuel to 
intermediately enriched uranium fuel. 
  The newly developed fuel achieved 20% enrichment 
based on 
this first stage fuel development. The silicide fuel was formed 
through compression of a mixture of uranium and silicon alloy 
and aluminum powders. Aluminum alloy was used as a coating 
material. Cadmium wire 0.3mm in diameter was placed on the side 
of the fuel elements in order to control excess reactivity at 
the onset of the operation. 
  [.sup]235[/]U of each fuel element indicates 310-410 grams 
of intermediately enriched uranium fuel. JAERI had conducted 
tests using 2 fuel elements from 24 October 1993 to 20 December 
1993, reconfirming their applicability. 
  This time, 50 megawatts thermal output was achieved using 
slightly enriched uranium fuels for all 27 fuel elements. JAERI 
claims that the number of nuclear reactor operation 
interruptions will be reduced by lengthening the past 12-day 
continuous operation to 26 days. 
  Of all nuclear research reactors of above 1 megawatt output 
worldwide, approximately 60 -- excluding those in the former 
Soviet Union -- require slightly enriched fuels; 18 reactors 
have been modified to use slightly enriched fuels. JAERI has 
developed the world's first slightly enriched fuel with a high 
neutron flux density, essential for materials testing.

  [Text] The Agency of International Science and Technology's 
[AIST] Electrotechnical Laboratory (Sotaro Tomiyama, Laboratory 
Chief) established technology to directly observe atoms and 
molecules inside a vacuum. This technology uses laser radiation 
to ionize atoms and molecules, which exist in very small amounts 
in a vacuum, so that the distribution of atoms and molecules in 
space can be detected by imagery. This is the world's first such 
detection device. Combined with ``atom counting'' technology, 
this device enables the counting of atoms one by one. This makes 
it possible to measure the molecular density in an ultrahigh 
vacuum which, up until this time, has been impossible. They 
believe they can play a role in the development of new 
functional elements, recording elements, and information 
elements--the results of atomcraft, which builds up atoms one on 
top of the other. 
  This technology is one of the achievements of a project 
called ``the study related to ultrahigh vacuum generation, 
measurement, and utilization'' using science and technology 
promotion funds. This is a pioneering success by the surface 
control research laboratory of the ETL's ultimate technology 
department. This laboratory has been taking on the challenge of 
creating technology to count gaseous molecules and atoms one by 
one. 
  At present, the technology has advanced to a point where it 
can create an ultrahigh vacuum with a pressure of 
10[.sup]-11[/] pascals, which is that of the environment of 
an artificial satellite in geostationary orbit in space. This 
means that the number of molecules per cubic centimeter is about 
1,000. Therefore, it is necessary to measure precisely an 
ultrahigh vacuum in this state. In particular, it is essential 
to know the absolute number of molecules (gaseous molecular 
density) for the manipulation of molecules and atoms in the 
submicron world. 
  For that reason, it is essential to have the technology to 
know the volume of the space and to detect 100 percent of the 
atoms and molecules in the space. The laboratory has already 
ionized atoms and molecules by striking them with a laser 
radiation-source and established technology for counting the 
generated ions. However, this technology could only count the 
number of atoms and molecules, and could not know the volume of 
space in which the ions were being generated, so it was not 
possible to measure the density (the number of atoms per unit 
space). 
  The developed technology is a detection system that can 
directly observe the ionization sphere made by the laser 
radiation source. It is the first technology to make it possible 
to observe, by video imagery, the ion generation sphere. 
  The laser used for ionization is a picosecond pulse YAG 
laser 
operatingat the second harmonic generation level (wavelength of 
532 nanometers and pulse width of 35 picoseconds). This laser 
radiation was focused into the vacuum by a lens and 100 percent 
of the atoms and molecules [within the focal area] were ionized 
by it. The laboratory has succeeded in directly measuring 
hydrogen molecules within an ultrahigh vacuum.

<F P=106> [Article by Satoshi Isaka: ``Opponents Want To Limit Life of </F>
Nuclear Treaty; Current Pact Viewed as Unequal, Outmoded''] 
  [Text] The problem of North Korea, coupled with Japan's 
active policy of using plutonium for domestic energy production, 
has created an outburst of Western speculation about the 
possibility of a nuclear Japan. As a result, one might conclude 
that all Japanese have become enthusiastic supporters of the 
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as a way to dispel what many 
view as totally unfounded suspicions. 
  That, however, is not entirely the case. Although the 
Japanese government has firmly maintained its support for 
extending the treaty indefinitely beyond 1995, when it is due 
for renewal, other influential people --including scientists, 
some lawmakers and the mayors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki -- argue 
that the pact should not be extended without correcting what 
they feel are its gross inequalities. 
  The treaty was established in 1970 to prevent additional 
countries from acquiring or developing nuclear weapons. But 
Japanese critics say Tokyo should make its support for extension 
of the pact conditional on more efforts by existing nuclear 
powers to shrink or eliminate their own nuclear arsenals. 
  ``If you want to build a truly effective non-proliferation 
regime, the real question will be how to let countries like 
India, Pakistan and Israel into the system,'' said Kumao Kaneko, 
a professor of international relations at Tokai University and a 
former director of the Foreign Ministry's nuclear energy 
division. The three countries have so far refused to sign the 
treaty. 
<H5>  Doubly Unfair </H5>
  He is not alone in sympathizing with such nations, which 
have 
resisted international pressure to join the treaty on the ground 
that the declared nuclear powers -- China, France, Russia, the 
UK and the U.S. -- have not done enough to cut their own atomic 
weapons, as required by Article 6 of the treaty. 
  The current pact is doubly unfair, developing nations 
contend, because unlike other signatories, the five declared 
nuclear powers are under no obligation to accept international 
inspections of their nuclear facilities. And it is practically 
impossible to rectify this situation because the consent of all 
five is needed to amend the treaty, critics point out. 
  ``The veto power of the five nations is clearly a problem,'' 
Ryukichi Imai, who represented Japan at a disarmament conference 
in Geneva, told a recent international forum in Tokyo. 
  Looking back over the past 25 years, some important but 
unexpected developments, such as the breakup of the Soviet 
Union, have occurred, which demonstrate the treaty's inadequacy, 
he said adding, ``You cannot guarantee that similar things will 
never happen in the next 25 years.'' 
  Imai thus objects to an indefinite extension of the treaty. 
Instead, he said: ``We can extend it by another 25 years. After 
that, we can take another look at the system.'' 
  Annette Schaper, a nuclear physicist at Germany's Peace 
Research Institute Frankfurt, agreed. ``The extension of the 
treaty should be ... linked to nuclear disarmament,'' she said 
at the Tokyo forum. 
  Even some Japanese government officials are resentful of the 
existing regime's shortcomings. In fact, one of the main reasons 
that the government failed to clarify its stance over extension 
of the treaty by the time of the G-7 summit last July in Tokyo 
-- which initially stirred overseas speculation about Japan's 
nuclear intentions -- was that many Japanese officials had 
difficulty with the tendency of the declared nuclear powers to 
stress non-proliferation while showing relative indifference to 
nuclear disarmament and security guarantees for non-nuclear 
states. 
<H5>  Classic Dilemma </H5>
  To the Japanese officials, the issue of strengthening the 
treaty poses a classic dilemma of making a transition from an 
imperfect to perfect world. 
  ``I very much understand the sentiment of those developing 
nations who complain about the (treaty's) unfairness,'' said 
Akira Hayashi, director general for arms control and scientific 
affairs at the Foreign Ministry. 
  However, if Japan makes its support for extension of the 
pact 
conditional on nuclear disarmament, this would encourage other 
nations to harden their stance against the existing agreement, 
he said. ``This would undermine the chances of even extending 
the treaty for a short period. And it is better to have an 
imperfect regime than no regime at all.''

  [Text] A MITI-backed project to promote the free 
international exchange of manufacturing technology may be 
finally getting off the ground with plans to step up research 
and funding. 
  The idea of making more effective and efficient use of 
elementary manufacturing technology by sharing it as a global 
asset was first put forward in 1989 by Professor Hiroyuki 
Yoshikawa, president of the University of Tokyo. 
  When the Ministry of International Trade and Industry threw 
its weight behind the idea, however, other countries were 
skeptical. Industrial know-how has long been Japan's powerbase. 
With the country's economy looking unstoppable at the time, 
other countries suspected Japan would have the most to gain from 
the pooling of manufacturing secrets into an international data 
base. 
<H5>  Changing Attitudes </H5>
  Recently, however, the project, known as Intelligent 
Manufacturing System (IMS) Plan, is winning more acceptance, its 
supporters say. The ending of the Cold War has made the 
international community more open to ideas such as 
``technoglobalism.'' 
  Intensified competition in the business world is also 
working 
to promote the exchange of production know-how. Rival 
corporations are increasingly forming transnational alliances, 
sometimes manufacturing products under their competitor's brand 
name. 
  In January, the International Steering Committee, a 
private-sector body which governs the project, urged all 
participating companies and research institutes from member 
countries to step up their studies on ways to implement IMS. It 
has set a 10-year goal to have the system up and running. 
  Participating in the project are private corporations and 
institutes from Japan, the U.S., Europe, Canada and Australia. 
MITI has earmarked more than &yen;1.25 billion ($11.9 million) 
in 1994 budget for research fees connected with IMS. 
<H5>  Time, Money Saver </H5>
  Under the plan, it is envisioned that product designers 
could 
access a data base to find necessary elementary manufacturing 
technologies. This would allow them to build effective 
applications in a shorter amount of time. 
  The scheme would also give product designers access to 
information obtained from point-of-sales surveys by other 
manufacturers. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-71A>      FIGURE </FIG>


  The prime benefit of the plan is that it would save money 
wasted by companies on reinventing technologies that already 
exist. Furthermore, the establishment of IMS would make it 
easier to implement environment maintenance systems such as 
recycling as part of manufacturing technologies. 
  For the past two years, participants in the project have 
carried out preliminary research on topics including 
systematization of knowledge, environmentally friendly 
processing industries and concurrent engineering for 
international production. 
  Fully 142 facilities, comprised of 87 corporations and 55 
universities from participating countries, have played a part in 
the research. Japan took the lead in researching the 
systemization of knowledge with 19 corporations, nine 
universities and national research organizations taking part. 
  Because IMS would create international cooperative research 
on an unprecedented scale, one of the main topics of the 
preliminary research was how to deal with intellectual property 
rights, including patents generated from IMS projects. 
  The studies so far have suggested creating three types of 
regulations to protect the integrity of the system. Some 
regulations would be compulsory throughout the entire system, 
other regulations would be recommended for implementing in 
cooperative agreements and still other regulations would be 
permissible depending on the desires of the participants. 
  Preliminary agreements have determined that a partner could 
share research results with a third party without gaining 
permission from the other partner. Furthermore, a partner in 
cooperative research will be able to use research results in 
commercial applications without compensating the other partner. 
  However, a company can agree to pay fees to non-profit 
research facilities when using results in commercial 
applications. An agreement was also reached to draw a 
distinction between academic use and commercial use of patents 
held by individual researchers and only charge royalties on 
commercial uses.

  [Text]The rates for digital dedicated circuits in Japan and 
the United States were classified into long distance and local 
and compared. The result is Japan's prices are overwhelmingly 
costlier. Although the rates in Japan were less than one-half 
when compared at the initiation of service, several differences 
exist with the U.S. These rate differences cannot frustrate the 
realization of a multimedia society in which high-speed, 
high-capacity circuits will be in common use. 
  Charges for NTT's high-speed digital transmission services 
were cut on February 1 of this year. The rates were decreased to 
less than half the rate level at the initiation of service. 
Nevertheless, the gap with the U.S. is huge. Therefore, we will 
compare the two countries to evaluate the current situation. 
Elements other than rates such as the communication quality were 
not considered to be targets of this comparison. 
<H5>  A Large Gap Exists between Japan and the U.S. Despite the </H5>
Rate Cut 
  Starting with the conclusion, we can say that although the 
rate calculation methods differ in the two countries, Japan's 
rates are several times higher. 
  Figure 1 compares the rates of NTT's 1.5 Mbits/second 
high-speed digital dedicated circuit to those of the Terrestrial 
1.5M (T1) service of AT&amp;T, a long distance telephone company 
in 
the U.S. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-72A>      Figure 1. Comparison of 1.5 Mbits/second Services in Japan </FIG>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  It was noted beforehand that comparing the two services of 
NTT and AT&amp;T on the same graph is not strictly correct. In 
contrast to NTT's offering end-to-end service, AT&amp;T's service 
target is only the relay portion. Therefore, the methods for 
calculating rates differ.[.sup]1[/] 
  Only the relay portion offered by AT&amp;T is shown in 
Figure 1. 
The circuit access charge that varies with the users' conditions 
is not considered. In fact, the access charge is about several 
hundred dollars. Nonetheless, when this point is considered, 
Japan's dedicated circuit rate is very high. (An example is 
explained later.) 
  The results are almost identical at other speeds. For 
example, a comparison at 64 kbits/second is shown in Figure 2. 
The disparity is about the same as in the 1.5 Mbits/second case. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-73B>      Figure 2. Comparison at 64 kbits/second. The comparison </FIG>


<H5>  Comparison of 1.5M between Tokyo-Osaka and NY-LA: The </H5>
Distance Is One-Tenth But the Rate Is Doubled 
  As a concrete example of rate calculations including the 
access charge, we will present an example using the 1.5 
Mbits/second circuit between New York and Los Angeles which are 
separated by about 2,500 miles (about 4,000 km) (Figure 3). In 
this example, the monthly fee is about $12,500 (about 1.32 
million yen). The distances of the access circuits were each 2 
miles in both New York and Los Angeles. The access charges used 
are determined by each local telephone company, NYNEX and 
Pacific Bell. Since rate is determined by each local telephone 
company, rates differ for the same distance. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-74A>      Figure 3. Calculation Method for Long Distance Dedicated </FIG>



  It is a bit forced to select the Tokyo-Osaka route (408 km) 
as the Japanese example corresponding to the New York-Los 
Angeles route in business activities, but the circuit usage rate 
at the same speed is 2.7 million yen. Compared to the New 
York-Los Angeles route, the distance is one tenth, but the rate 
is almost double. 
<H5>  A Shorter Distance But 4 to 5 Times More Expensive </H5>
  In Japan the charge calculation method does not change for 
short distances from several kilometers to several tens of 
kilometers. Only rates corresponding to distance divisions are 
determined. While in the U.S., if confined to within the service 
area of the local telephone company, the rate structure of the 
local telephone company is used[.sup]2[/]. For example, the 
rates for the New York Metro LATA (Local Access and Transport 
Area: region provided service by the same telephone company) of 
NYNEX in the U.S. adds basic rates and measured rates between 
the user and the central office and between central offices 
(Table 2). 



  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Table 2 Monthly Rates of NYNEX's Superpath (1.5 Mbits/second)                | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|                         |Basic Rate               |Measured Rate (per mile) | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Interoffice Rate         |$115                     |$30/mile                 | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Access Charge (one end)  |$210                     |$5/0.25 mile             | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Rates were effective 1 October 1993 in the New York Metro LATA.              | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Based on a survey by the United Communications Group in the U.S.             | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  In this case the access condition is not fixed, thus, a 
comparison on the same graph is difficult. Figure 4 was graphed 
when the distance of the access circuit is 0 and only the 
interoffice distance is changed. A large gap is evident. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-75A>      Figure 4. Comparison at Local Distances (1.5 </FIG>



  For a comparison of realistic conditions, we will calculate 
an example between Marunouchi and Shinjuku in Tokyo (Figure 5). 
The distance between NTT's Marunouchi office and Shinjuku office 
is 6.5 km. The users at both ends are 400m from the Marunouchi 
office and the Shinjuku office. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-76A>      Figure 5. Example Calculation of Dedicated Circuit Rates </FIG>


  In NTT's rate calculation method, a rate of &yen;33,700 is 
applied up to a distance division of 15 km. In contrast, the 
rate of NYNEX in the U.S. is adapted to each case. The rate 
($695 = &yen;73,000) is the combination of the rate between the 
two offices ($265, corresponding to part A in Figure 5) and the 
rate based on the distance from the office to the user's 
residence ($215 on one end, part B in Figure 5). Japanese rates 
are 4 to 5 times higher. 
<H5>  Considering the Causes </H5>
  The gap between rates in Japan and the U.S. is confirmed by 
NTT. The Dedicated Services Division stated ``We are aware of 
the problem. People within the company have pointed out the need 
for further reductions.'' Firstly, what is the cause of this gap? 
  One reason is NTT's internal rate structure. Historically, 
NTT has had high earnings services and low earnings services. 
Dedicated services have high rates relative to costs. When we 
look at the profit rate in which ordinary profit and loss were 
classified by the business income for different work (telephone, 
telegraph, dedicated services) at NTT in 1992, the profit rate 
for suburban calls (subscriber telephone) is 59.8% and 
that for 
dedicated services is 14.6%; both are in double digits. 
Considering the rate system with respect to costs, the rates of 
both services should be further reduced. However, while services 
with high earnings decrease in price, there is the fear that low 
profit services, like the current rate for intracity calls of 
&yen;10 for 3 minutes, will experience price increases. If the 
rates for users of dedicated circuits fall rapidly, placing the 
burden on users who make many station-to-station calls would be 
pursued. Also, there is the high probability that NCC (new 
first-time communications commercial customers), who increase 
earnings in dedicated circuits, will receive a heavy blow. 
  Another reason may be the difference in costs to provide 
communication services in Japan and in the U.S. According to the 
NTT Special Services Promotion Department, ``There are elements 
that cannot be explained only by the difference in the 
relationship between costs and rates in each service. Ideas 
about networks also differ in Japan and the U.S.'' Specifically, 
there are the amount of backup circuits and the refined 
monitoring system. In addition, because the depth at which 
cables are buried is set in Japan, the road construction costs 
are 10 times higher than in the U.S. 
  One telecommunication analyst gave one reason for high rates 
as ``the manufacturer's protection policy followed in the past 
by NTT.'' During the training period of the manufacturer, the 
equipment used by NTT (Nippon Telegraph and Telephone) was 
purchased at high prices from domestic manufacturers. This had 
the effect of a high level of R&amp;D strength at the 
manufacturer. 
However, when NTT was privatized, procuring domestically or 
overseas without distinction became possible. If manufacturer 
protection is carried out, the danger of pushing up 
telecommunication costs is exhibited. 
  In realizing a multimedia society focused on transmitting 
images, a premise is the ability to inexpensively use 
high-speed, large capacity circuits. But high rates will become 
a major obstacle. Of course, to secure lower prices, a review of 
the old framework will be involved. In reforming the framework 
in rate theory, a wider range of view must be assembled. 
Footnotes 
  1. Dedicated Circuit Calculation Methods in Japan and the 
U.S. 
  NTT uses a rate table corresponding to the 24 distance 
divisions. In principle, the rate is determined based on the 
distance to the MA (message area, unit of individual charging 
area) the user belongs to. However, at short distances within an 
MA, the distance between the receiving offices is applied. While 
in the U.S., the relay circuits provided by long distance 
telephone companies like AT&amp;T and the access circuits 
provided 
by the local telephone companies must be combined. 
  The rate of each circuit consists of the basic monthly rate 
and the special rate corresponding to distance. 
  2. Rate Structure of Local Telephone Companies 
  Local telephone companies in the United States have 
different 
rates for end-to-end services such as the access circuits of 
long distance telephone companies.

Chinese governments signed a memorandum on cooperation in which 
China will receive and use directly data from the Japanese Earth 
Resources Satellite-1 (JERS-1), which conducts land survey and 
environmental monitoring mainly for the purpose of searching out 
resources. The signing parties were the National Aerospace 
Development Agency of Japan (NASDA) and the Chinese Academy of

  [Text] The Society of Japanese Aerospace Companies, Inc. 
(SJAC), announced the results of its survey of aircraft 
procurements made by the Defense Agency during the period of 
FY90 through FY94 (based on the budget request amounts). 
According to the survey, although the procurement amount in FY90 
consisted of &yen;355.3 billion from domestic suppliers and 
&yen;4.2 billion from overseas suppliers, the latter being only 
about 1% of the total amount, the percentage of 
procurement 
from overseas gradually increased as a result of the need to 
correct the Japan-U.S. trade imbalance; in FY93, the domestic 
procurement was cut to &yen;189.4 billion, or about half of what 
it was previously, and the overseas procurement was sharply 
increased to &yen;117.3 billion, accounting for about one-third 
of the total amount. The overseas procurement in FY94 is 
expected to remain at a high level of &yen;113.9 billion. 
  All defense-related manufacturers here are quite concerned 
about the sharp increase in the share of the overseas 
procurement in addition to the general tendency of defense 
budget reduction. 
  While the total aircraft procurement in FY90, mainly 
consisting of the frontal equipment, was &yen;359.5 billion, 
that figure dropped to about &yen;270 billion in FY91 and FY92 
as a result of the end of the Cold War. The amount increased in 
FY93 and FY94 because of the fact that the procurement of two 
AWACS [airborne warning and control system] (about &yen;55 
billion) was included. It continued to grow in FY93, rising to 
&yen;306.7 billion, and it is expected to be about &yen;337.1 in 
FY94; however, it is still lower than FY90. 
  Domestic procurement also dropped from its peak in FY90 to 
&yen;189.4 billion, or about half of the peak value, in FY93. In 
FY94, however, it is expected to recover to &yen;223.2 billion. 
  Overseas procurement, however, sharply increased to 
38.2% in 
FY93 and 33.8% in FY94, from 1.2% in FY90. There 
is a 
difference of night and day between the trends in the domestic 
and overseas procurements.

on the results of these tests, plans to market its utilization 
to electric power companies and other potential customers. 
  The CWM that was transported consists of 70% finely 
powdered 
coal and 30% water with a small amount of additives. The 
advantages of CWM are that it can be transported in tankers just 
like heavy oil, and because CWM can be stored in tanks after 
unloading, it is easier to protect the environment than with 
conventional coal. 
  Ube Industries plans to produce the CWM in New South Wales, 
Australia, and ship it to Japan. Many times in the past Ube 
Industries has manufactured CWM and actually used it in 
combustion tests to get an idea of its practicality, but the 
remaining problem was whether CWM could withstand long-distance 
transport from Australia. 
  For the Ube-Singapore round-trip CWM transport test, which 
was a longer distance than one-way transport from Australia, Ube 
Industries obtained the cooperation of Nippon Yusen, Nissho 
Iwai, and Tsurumi Transportation (Minato-ku, Tokyo). 
Two-thousand tons of CWM were carried about 20 days while the 
effect on quality of the rolling of the ship's hull and the heat 
of tropical temperatures was studied. As a result, Ube 
Industries concluded that long-distance transport is feasible 
with modifications to heavy oil tankers. 
  Ube Industries announced, ``With the completion of these 
transport tests, we have overcome the technical problems for the 
practical application of CWM,'' and the company will now work 
toward its utilization in Japan. CWM produced in China is 
already used in part as a fuel source at thermal power plants, 
but Ube Industries will market its Australian product as a 
stable supply of CWM. If business talks bring favorable results, 
Ube Industries will build a plant at Newcastle in New South 
Wales.

  [Text] On 14 February the development of a fuel cell 
prototype vessel was approved under Shipbuilding-Related 
Expenditures in negotiations over the FY94 national budget plan 
that are aimed at reviving the Ministry of Transportation. The 
MOT will proceed with design and development of a prototype ship 
in a four-year project to study whether fuel cells, which have 
high heat efficiency and burn clean, can be used to replace 
current diesel and gas turbine engines for ship propulsion. 
  In the initial year, &yen;200 million in the national budget 
has been approved under the category ``R&amp;D Expenditures for 
Next-Generation Ships.'' The original budget, as announced 
unofficially, included no funds for this project. This project 
calls for companies in the private sector to bear an equal 
amount of the costs, which brings the total expenditures for the 
project to &yen;400 million. 
  In fuel cells hydrogen and oxygen are reacted to provide 
electrical energy. Electric power generating systems approaching 
practical application include the phosphoric acid type and the 
molten carbonate type. The MOT will conduct research on the 
properties of a ship carrying a power generating system fueled 
by liquified natural gas (LNG) and methanol, and develop a 
prototype vessel. 
  In the same category of R&amp;D Expenditures for 
Next-Generation 
Ships, &yen;673 million was approved in the original budget plan 
for R&amp;D expenditures for the Techno Super Liner (TSL). FY94 
will 
be the final year of this project, and two types of experimental 
vessels will be completed. 
  In other Shipbuilding-Related Expenditures, &yen;164 million 
was approved for Environmental Preservation, somewhat less than 
the requested &yen;175 million. This breaks down to &yen;45 
million for countermeasures against exhaust gases such as 
nitrogen oxides (NO[.sub]x[/]) and &yen;119 million to 
protect against oil spills. Each of these expenditures will 
subsidize one-half of a government undertaking, so the amounts 
actually spent on these projects will be doubled. 
  In addition, the government raised the ceiling on the ratio 
of loans from open [sic] banks for marine shipping companies to 
aid in compliance with International Maritime Organization (IMO) 
double-hulled tanker regulations. In the past the ratio had been 
either 50% or 60%, but now it has been revised to 
60% 
uniformly.

  [Text] Tokyo Gas Company has developed a co-generation 
system that saves space and realizes low costs by directly 
inputting waste heat into the heat exchanger. Previous 
co-generation systems used waste heat to produce cold water for 
air coolers by employing a hot-water-powered absorption 
refrigerator, but in small-scale operations the temperature of 
the waste heat was so low that efficiency was poor for such a 
large piece of equipment. This new system not only takes up 
30% 
less space than previous equipment from Tokyo Gas, but also 
costs about 10% less. Tokyo Gas will install the new 
system at 
its Energy Technology Research Institute in Minato-ku, Tokyo, 
and begin demonstration testing by August. 
  In previous co-generation systems a hot-water-powered 
absorption refrigerator that used waste heat emerging from gas 
turbines and gas engines at 80-90ÎC was combined with a 
gas-powered absorption water-cooler in a two-tiered system for 
generating cool air. In the new system, the waste heat is 
recovered by the heat exchanger directly and inserted into the 
gas-powered absorption water-cooler cycle. The hot water in this 
cycle heats the refrigerant and produces cool air through the 
action of evaporation. Tokyo Gas says it was possible to improve 
the performance of the heat exchanger, and thus enable direct 
connection with the cooling water. 
  Because the new heat exchanger is much smaller than the 
hot-water-powered absorption refrigerator, it is possible to 
make the whole system more compact. Normally, co-generation 
plants are installed in areas with limited space such as 
basements and rooftops, so making the unit more compact offers 
considerable advantages. 
  In terms of cost, the new system offers almost no change in 
operating costs such as gas consumption, but the cost of the 
unit itself will be about 10% lower than before. Because 
the 
system has been simplified, maintenance costs are also expected 
to be lower. As far as the old systems are concerned, for a 
plant on the scale of 100 tons refrigeration, an additional 
investment of about &yen;1 million to add the new heat exchanger 
will allow the hot-water-powered absorption refrigerator to be 
eliminated, just like in the new systems. 
  Tokyo Gas has replaced the 50 tons refrigeration-class 
co-generation system at its Technology Research Institute with 
the new type, continued performance testing, and confirmed its 
stability. Therefore, Tokyo Gas plans to install a large 
demonstration system and attempt to bring performance to an even 
higher level. The system is expected to appear on the general 
market next spring.

  [Text] On 1 February Tokyo Gas Co. announced that in 
cooperation with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries it has developed 
the world's first solid polymer electric fuel cell System 
(SPEFC) that uses city gas for fuel, and it has successfully 
generated 50 kW of power. Tokyo Gas will continue testing and 
research with the goal of practical application by summer 1996. 
In theory, it will be possible for a household to generate its 
own electricity from the city gas supplied to each home. 
  The fuel cell system consists of a hydrogen dissociation 
type 
reformer that directly manufactures very pure hydrogen from city 
gas (natural gas) and a solid polymer fuel cell manufactured by 
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. The system generates electricity by 
using the very pure hydrogen as fuel. By developing the reformer 
that produces hydrogen from city gas, Tokyo Gas has cleared the 
path toward practical application of a fuel cell system that 
runs on city gas. 
  The newly developed hydrogen dissociation type reformer 
produces hydrogen by: 
  1) Using steam pyrolysis to dissociate city gas, the main 
component of which is methane, 
  2) Using a palladium film to extract only the hydrogen from 
the resulting mix of hydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon 
dioxide, 
  3) Burning off the remaining substances. 
  The key point in the technology is the fact that researchers 
were able to dramatically increase the efficiency of obtaining 
hydrogen by reducing the thickness of the palladium film through 
which the hydrogen passes to one-fifth its original thickness. 
  The problem in the past has been that a carbon monoxide 
converter and a hydrogen purifier were needed to obtain very 
pure hydrogen, which made the equipment bulky. The reformer, on 
the other hand, is 28 cm in diameter and 1 meter high, which 
makes the system five to ten times smaller. Tokyo Gas is aiming 
for practical application in the 21st century of this new fuel 
cell system that simply uses city gas.

  [Text] Mitsumura Printing has developed a low cost and high 
precision color filter for printing. Manufacturing cost of color 
layers is half that of the pigment dispersion method. 
Previously, color printing was done one color at time, but this 
new method can print three colors at once. It is said that this 
method reduces print defects caused by particles. Sample 
shipments will start from the summer of 1994, and the company 
will actively sell to TFT panel makers. 
  It is expected that the color filter printing method will 
reduce manufacturing cost since it does not require a 
lithography process. On the other hand, since the resolution is 
low, it was thought that this printing method was not suitable 
for high resolution TFT panels. The color filter printing method 
that Mitsumura Printing has developed this time increased the 
resolution, and even some panel makers are saying, ``it changes 
the concept of printing.'' 
  In traditional printing methods, flattening and the 
formation of direct lines were not fully satisfactory. In 
addition, there was a frequent problem of defects caused by 
particles. The main reason for the defects is because each color 
is printed separately and dries, and then next color is layered 
on the dried print. The layered part becomes dense in the film, 
so that it is difficult to flatten the surface. Furthermore 
since a roller is used to transfer ink, the edge becomes wavy. 
<H5>  Print Three Colors Simultaneously Leaving Gap </H5>
  The new method uses offset printing, three colors are 
printed simultaneously. For this reason manufacturing cost is 
reduced (see figure 1), and high resolution printing is 
improved. On each of RGB print boards, a roller shaped blanket 
body is rotated, and three colors of ink are transferred onto 
the surface of one blanket (see figure 2). At this time, a 10 
Êm gap is spaced between each color. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-025L-16A>      Figure 1. Cost Comparison In Color Area Using Color Filter </FIG>



<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-025L-17A>      Figure 2. Color Filter Manufacturing Process In Each Method </FIG>


  This blanket is pressed hard to the glass baseboard, 
rotated, and each color is transferred. At the same time 
following the blanket, a second roller is rotated, which presses 
and spreads each color onto the baseboard, and flattens. Ink 
pressed from the top is packed, filling the gap, so ``flattening 
and edge linearity are improved.'' said the R&amp;D manager of 
Mitsumura Printing. Flatness and direct line formation are 
improved to less than 0.15 Êm and 5 Êm respectively 
which is 
less than half that produced by the traditional method (see 
table 1 and figure 3).

  Also, the flat board made by A1 was corrected, and 
dimensional precision was improved. It is said that correction 
is possible between 5-50 Êm. At present the printing method 
employed by Toppan Printing Company which is a competitor, has 
difficulty with correction since the board is glass, and 
manufacturing cost is higher by 2 digits. Moreover, simultaneous 
three color printing is, Rprincipally difficult since ink gets 
mixed,S said the manager of R&amp;D at Mitsumura Printing. 
<H5>  Production Capacity Increased By 25% </H5>
  From calculations, a 25% improvement in production 
line 
capacity is estimated by using 3 color simultaneous printing. 
Improved operation idling and efficiency result from reducing 
the printing machines from three units to one unit, and particle 
generation as well as machine failure in the overall process are 
reduced. 
  However, the number of rollers per unit increases three 
times, and tack time per piece will be longer. By Mitsumura 
Printing's estimate, if one color operation is involved, 
operational efficiency is 50%, idling is 65%, and 
tack time is 
30 seconds; and if the three color operation is employed, the 
values are 60%, 75%, and 60 seconds respectively.

  [Text] 
<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  Active matrix LCD displays (AM-LCD) that utilize amorphous 
silicon thin film transistors as switching elements have become 
the mainstream in flat panel color displays and are now used in 
a variety of products. They not only have replaced the 
traditional CRT, but have also found a home in many other 
products such as in portable instruments and games. The size of 
the market in personal computers and other office automation 
equipment is especially large, and because this equipment also 
requires displays with a high level of performance, we can say 
that the main technology in this field has been built around the 
AM-LCD. 
  When we look at product trends, right now the main items are 
8-10 inch diagonal VGA class displays like those in notebook 
computers, but it is clear that we are headed for the XGA and 
engineering workstations (EWS) in the future, and that means 
large (14-20 inch), displays with greater resolution. 
  In making this kind of large, high-resolution display, the 
key point is how much we can increase the pixel numerical 
aperture. In the case of EWS, the area per pixel is small due to 
the high resolution, and obtaining sufficient numerical aperture 
has been an inherent problem. On the other hand, with products 
oriented toward light weight and lengthy battery use such as 
notebook computers, increasing the numerical aperture has the 
advantage of reducing power consumption of the backlight, which 
reduces the load on the battery. One of the main factors that 
determines the size of the numerical aperture is TFT 
performance, and improvement in TFT performance directly leads 
to improved picture quality in displays. 
  In this article I will discuss the high mobility TFT and 
self-aligned TFT as two approaches to future 
technology.[.sup]1-3[/] 
<H5>  Demand for High Performance with a-Si TFT </H5>
  When the a-Si TFT is used in an AM-LCD, two major items are 
required for TFT performance: 
  (1) the field effect mobility (Ê[.sub]FE[/]) must be 
sufficiently large, and 
  (2) the parasitic capacitance (C[.sub]gs[/]) from gate 
signal overlap must be sufficiently small. 
  From the standpoint of physical properties, the electron 
mobility a-Si is not very large, so we cannot reasonably expect 
a large Ê[.sub]FE[/] when it is used as a TFT. 
  Figure 1 shows the change in Ê[.sub]FE[/] values as 
reported up till now at SID-related conferences.[.sup]4[/] 
During the initial period of a-Si TFT development from 
1982-1985, the Ê[.sub]FE[/] values were 0.15-0.3 
cm[.sup]2[/]/Vs. After 1985 silicon nitride (SiN) came into 
use as the gate insulating film, and this greatly improved 
Ê[.sub]FE[/] to the point that values surpassing 1 
cm[.sup]2[/]/Vs were obtained in the laboratory. At about the 
same time, in 1986, the 3-inch diagonal mini-TV appeared on the 
market as the first TFT-LCD commercial product. Ten-inch 
displays for personal computers appeared on the market in 1991, 
and on the mass production level, the actual range for 
Ê[.sub]FE[/] values is now about 0.3-0.6 cm[.sup]2[/]/Vs 
for VGA displays. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-025L-19B>      Figure 1 Changes in a-Si TFT Field Effect Mobility </FIG>


  However, these values are hardly sufficient for large, 
high-resolution displays. As shown in Fig. 1, even better values 
are required for XGA and EWS level displays. 
  Figure 2 shows a block diagram of a pixel pattern and 
equivalent circuitry. Here, numerical aperture is defined as the 
ratio of the area of light that can be transmitted to the total 
area occupied by a single pixel. In actual practice, a color 
filter substrate is placed opposite the pixel pattern shown in 
Fig. 2, and the numerical aperture is ultimately determined by 
the openings in the black matrix on the color filter substrate. 
There are three ways to increase the numerical aperture, as 
clearly shown in the drawing: (1) make the gate wire or data 
wire thinner, (2) make the TFT smaller, or (3) make the storage 
capacity (C[.sub]s[/]) smaller. Because (1) involves the 
selection of low-resistance wiring material, I will discuss (2) 
and (3) in this article. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-025L-20A>      Figure 2 Pixel Pattern Block Diagram and Electrically Equivalent Circuits </FIG>

  In TFT-LCD design it is desirable to make the TFT dimensions 
as small as possible, but to obtain sufficient write current 
with a small Ê[.sub]FE[/] value, we must increase the TFT 
channel width (W). When we increase W, the TFT area also 
increases, and that increases C[.sub]gs[/] at the same time. 
This has a major impact. In other words, when the gate pulse 
(pulse peak V[.sub]g[/]) reaches its OFF-state potential, the 
punch through voltage (_D_V) becomes very large. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-025L-19A>      Equation </FIG>

  In this formula, C[.sub]LC[/] is the liquid crystal 
capacitance. _D_V is a factor in degradation of screen quality 
such as burning in and flicker, and we place it below the design 
value, which is compensated by C[.sub]s[/] capacitance. When 
we increase W, C[.sub]gs[/] increases, so we must make 
C[.sub]s[/] larger. In other words, the area of the 
C[.sub]s[/] member becomes larger, and this reduces the 
numerical aperture. For these reasons, a TFT with a large 
Ê[.sub]FE[/] or a sufficiently small C[.sub]gs[/], in 
other words a high performance TFT, is needed. 
  Two approaches appear promising for resolving this problem. 
One is an attempt to increase Ê[.sub]FE[/] by improving the 
film quality of the a-Si or the gate insulation, and the other 
is an attempt to reduce C[.sub]gs[/] by structure with a 
self-aligned TFT. 
<H5>  Increasing TFT Mobility </H5>
  The semiconductor active layer material a-Si and the gate 
insulating material SiN are manufactured by PE-CVD using 
SiH[.sub]4[/] or SiH[.sub]4[/] + NH[.sub]3[/] as raw 
material gases. Attempts have been made to improve TFT 
properties by increasing the quality if the a-Si and SiN layers, 
and by purifying the a-Si/SiN interface that forms the channel. 
Table 1 shows the main methods that have been used and the 
results.

  Making the a-Si layer using hot CVD has been suggested as 
one 
way to improve the quality of a-Si. Hot CVD makes use of the 
thermal decomposition reaction of the raw material gases, so 
compared with PE-CVD it inherently avoids damage due to charged 
particles, etc., and we can expect an increase in mobility. The 
problem lies in the fact that the film-forming temperature 
exceeds 600ÎC, so this method is not suitable for the LCD 
process, which uses a glass substrate. Ahn and 
coworkers[.sup]5[/] attempted to reduce the film-forming 
temperature by using a high order silane 
(Si[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]6[/]) as the raw material gas. They 
manufactured a TFT with a substrate temperature of 500ÎC and 
obtained a Ê[.sub]FE[/] of 1.7 cm[.sup]2[/]/Vs. 
  Next it is necessary to look at the method for forming the 
interface between the a-Si and the SiN gate insulating film. In 
monocrystalline Si MOSFETs, a distinct improvement in properties 
as well as stability and control were obtained by forming a 
clean Si/SiO interface by the thermal oxidation of Si in bulk 
silicon. 
  With the a-Si TFTs, however, the a-Si is formed on the SiN 
gate insulating film by PE-CVD. Therefore the purity of the 
interface is determined by the degree of vacuum during film 
forming and the plasma conditions during a-Si growth. Following 
the example of monocrystalline silicon, if an interface can also 
be formed within bulk a-Si, a controlled, clean interface should 
result. Yamamoto and coworkers[.sup]6[/] made an attempt by 
direct nitrification of the a-Si surface with an ammonia 
(NH[.sub]3[/]) plasma and subsequent deposition with SiN. 
More specifically, by using both the direct photoexcitation of 
NH[.sub]3[/] and plasma-excited H[.sub]2[/] radicals, they 
avoided damage from charged particle collisions. In the 
subsequent SiN deposition, they formed a coplanar TFT by direct 
photoexcitation of Si[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]6[/] and 
NH[.sub]3[/] plasma excitation. As a result, they obtained a 
large Ê[.sub]FE[/] value of 5.3 cm[.sup]2[/]/Vs. 
  Recently poly-Si film-forming technology at low temperatures 
of 300ÎC or less has received particular notice. For 
example, there are Êc-Si forming by plasma CVD and a CVD 
method that uses atomic hydrogen. Mori and 
coworkers[.sup]7[/] created a prototype TFT using poly-Si 
manufactured by PE-CVD with a 
SiF[.sub]4[/]/SiH[.sub]2[/]/H[.sub]2[/] gas mixture, 
and they obtained a Ê[.sub]FE[/] value of 10.1 
cm[.sup]2[/]/Vs. 
  There have also been active attempts to use poly-Si. Many 
manufacturing methods have been considered, but typical methods 
involve heat treatment for solid phase crystallization of 
reduced pressure CVD a-Si, recrystallization of a-Si by laser 
and so forth. In the case of reduced pressure and solid phase 
crystallization, high temperature film forming at 600ÎC or 
more or a lengthy heat treatment is required, and a high-priced 
quartz substrate must be used, so it is not suitable for the 
large TFT-LCD glass substrate process. On the other hand, 
recrystallization by laser has a wide range of applications, and 
because a huge Ê[.sub]FE[/] value of 329 cm[.sup]2[/]/Vs 
has been reported[.sup]8[/], it appears to be the most 
promising technique for the future. 
<H5>  Self-Aligned a-Si TFT </H5>
  Figure 3 compares three types of TFT structures that employ 
self-alignment methods to reduce C[.sub]gs[/]. Fig. 3(a) is a 
conventional TFT, with a channel length L and a gate source 
overlap length _D_L. The minimum value for _D_L is 
determined by 
the overlap precision of the mask during the photolithography 
process, and it is normally 3-4 Êm. In Fig. 3(b), the pattern 
in the SiN protective layer on top of the a-Si is made 
self-aligned at the gate electrode by exposing the resist of the 
gate pattern through a mask from the underside of the glass 
substrate. This enables a precision of 0.5-1.0 Êm for the 
gate 
source overlap _D_L[.sub]s[/], so C[.sub]gs[/] becomes 
smaller. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-025L-21A>      Figure 3 Cross Sections of a-Si TFT Structures </FIG>


  In the structures in Fig. 3(a) and 3(b) the source drain 
electrode overlaps above the SiN protective film, and the 
channel length L of the a-Si layer, which is the path for the 
current, cannot be made any smaller when we consider the margin 
in the photolithography process for this area. The value for L 
must be 10-12 Êm. 
  On the other hand, in the structure shown in Fig. 3(c), the 
n+ type a-Si layer, which is an ohmic contact layer, is made 
self-aligned by ion implantation through a mask of the SiN 
protective layer pattern instead of by PE-CVD as was done in the 
past. The SiN pattern is also made self-aligned by using low 
resistance metallic silicide for the source drain 
electrode.[.sup]9[/] The silicide layer, for example Cr or Mo 
silicide, is formed on top of the a-Si, and after a heat 
treatment at about 200ÎC, an unreacted metallic layer is 
easily formed by etching removal. With this (c) structure, the 
channel length (L[.sub]s[/]) can be made distinctly smaller 
because it can be determined by the minimum processing 
dimensions of the photolithography process. Naturally, with this 
design W is reduced, C[.sub]gs[/]becomes smaller, and as a 
result C[.sub]s[/] is reduced. 
  Figure 4 shows the results of simulations of the dependence 
of field effect mobility on numerical aperture.[.sup]2[/] The 
model device here is a 13.8 inch diagonal EWS (1152 x 3 x 900 
mm). For TFT dimensions we used L=12 Êm, _D_L=4 Êm, 
_D_L[.sub]s[/]=0.5 Êm, and L[.sub]s[/]=9 Êm. The 
numerical aperture is strongly dependent on the structure of the 
TFT, and the field effect mobility Ê[.sub]FE[/] is as well. 
In the case of the self-aligned TFT (c), a relatively large 
numerical aperture was obtained even when the Ê[.sub]FE[/] 
was small. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-025L-22A>      Figure 4. Simulation of Dependence of Field Effect </FIG>


  If we assume a practical level of, let us say, 35% 
for an 
EWS numerical aperture, with the conventional TFT we need a 
Ê[.sub]FE[/] of 1.25 cm[.sup]2[/]/Vs. As I have already 
shown in Fig. 1, this is almost impossible to realize with an 
a-Si TFT. With the self-aligned TFT (b), we need a 
Ê[.sub]FE[/] of 0.8 cm[.sup]2[/]/Vs. On the other hand, 
with self-aligned TFT (c), the Ê[.sub]FE[/] is 0.5 
cm[.sup]2[/]/Vs, which is sufficient for design, so its 
effect is quite outstanding. Therefore, we can say that the 
self-aligned TFT (c) makes maximum use of the qualities of the 
a-Si TFT, and it is a structure that shows great promise for the 
future. 
  In the self-aligned TFT (c), the n+ a-Si layer of the source 
drain is formed by ion implantation. Normally, a mass separation 
type of ion implantation device is used to dope crystal 
semiconductors, but such a device is ill suited to perform 
implantation in a reasonably short period of time on a substrate 
as large as 360x465 mm, for example, for the TFT-LCD. Based on 
the simplicity of the structure of the apparatus, implantation 
will be more suitably performed by the large-caliber ion beam of 
a non-mass separation type of device that uses a plasma of 
dopant gas. However, when a gas source such as PH[.sub]3[/]is 
used, extraneous elements in addition to the phosphorous, such 
as the hydrogen, will be implanted at the same time. Research is 
continuing on problems such as what kind of effect the behavior 
of these extraneous elements will have on TFT properties, how to 
optimize the profile of the implanted phosphorus, and what is 
the best structure for the apparatus. 
<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  One trend in a-Si TFT technology is toward larger size and 
higher resolution for AM-LCDs. More specifically, from the 
standpoint of device performance, improvement of TFT properties 
will be the key technology. 
  In this article I have described (1) new techniques for 
making a-Si and SiN materials and a-Si/SiN interface control 
techniques, and (2) self-aligned TFT structures and ion doping 
techniques as the essential techniques for improving the 
performance of TFT properties. Naturally, these apply to all 
TFT-LCDs and are not limited only to large, high resolution 
models. 
  Of course, research in this area has only begun to scratch 
the surface, but we hope that our efforts will have a major 
impact on the field, and we have great expectations for TFT-LCDs 
as next-generation technology.

<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  Current TFT-LCD issues include making them larger, giving 
them higher resolution, more colors, and lower power 
consumption, making them lighter and thinner, and applying them 
in multimedia. The LSI driver holds an important key to solving 
all these problems. 
  With this in mind, in this article I discuss the importance 
of the LSI driver in the LCD display system, present LSI driver 
technology, and future trends with special reference to LSI 
drivers for TFT-LCDs in the rapidly developing field of office 
automation. 
<H5>  Present TFT-LCDs and LSI Drivers </H5>
  1. LCD Driver Circuits for Personal Computers 
  The largest number of TFT-LCDs mass produced for personal 
computers are 8-12 inch diagonal panels with 640x400 or 640x480 
pixels, and they are mainly used in notebook and laptop 
computers. Based on the number of scan lines, in mainstream 
displays the gate bus line scan time is 30-40 Ês, the LSI 
driver has 8-16 levels, and there are 4096 colors in the 
display. The main drive methods include one that uses an 8-16 
level digital driver (multi-level driver), and one that drives a 
liquid crystal with a low cost 5 V output driver (8-16 levels) 
by altering the common voltage in opposite phase to the pixel 
voltage (the common inversion drive method).[.sup]1[/] 
  Moreover, multi-level display methods include the frame rate 
control method (abbreviated FRC below) and the dither 
method.[.sup]2[/] Of particular interest is the development 
of the 5 V output, 64 level LSI driver that enables the 
realization of 256 levels when combined with FRC. The reduction 
in picture quality, which is the shortcoming of combining the 5 
V output driver and the common inversion drive method appears to 
have been overcome as well by a new drive method[.sup]3[/] in 
which the driver oscillates. 
  2. LCD Driver Circuits for Workstations (WS) 
  This class of displays has a much higher number of pixels 
than personal computer displays, with more than 4096 display 
colors and more than 800,000 pixels, so the driver must work 
much faster. For example, there are dot clocks of more than 100 
MHz, and because the pixel signal cannot be input directly into 
the driver at present, phase expansion must be used to reduce 
the speed of the pixel signal clock to match the operating speed 
of the driver.[.sup]4[/] For applications that mostly deal 
with text, this is possible with the number of levels created by 
combining FRC with a digital driver, but to utilize current 
workstations to their full potential, at least 64-256 levels are 
required. 
  For engineering workstation (EWS) applications the operating 
frequency of the LSI driver reaches 50 MHz, and it is practical 
to expand to two phases to convey digital data to the LSI 
driver. However, 48 (8x3x2) input pins are needed to carry 8-bit 
data, so this is not practical from an installation standpoint. 
Therefore, development is underway to use phase expansion with 
analog drivers that obtain a sufficient output accuracy and have 
20 mV or less in output voltage fluctuation.[.sup]5[/] 
<H5>  Present LSI Drivers </H5>
  1. Present LSI Driver Device Technology 
  When we build an AC drive for a TFT-LCD using LSI driver 
output, we need an output amplitude of about 12 V, and the 5 V 
series control logic must be about 12 MHz at the personal 
computer level. From a structural standpoint we need as much 
commonality as we can get between the high-voltage and 
low-voltage CMOS in the LSI driver device, and we need a device 
formed by a consolidation process built under optimal conditions 
on the same substrate. 
  Figure 1 shows an example of a device made by the 
consolidation process. For the high-voltage CMOS it is necessary 
to make the gate oxide film thicker than the gate voltage's 
insulation withstand voltage, and we need a low-concentration 
offset layer to mitigate the gate and drain field concentration, 
which results in a complex structure. A high-concentration guard 
ring layer is also needed to achieve high-voltage CMOS element 
isolation. Therefore, consolidation is much more complex than 
the low-voltage CMOS process alone, and higher manufacturing 
costs are unavoidable. Because the mutual conductance 
gm drops and parasitic capacitance increases when we 
make a high-voltage CMOS, it is not possible to obtain high 
speed and high accuracy with a high-voltage CMOS analog circuit. 
Making the voltage higher also increases the design rule, and 
this is disadvantageous from the standpoint of integration. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-025L-24A>      Figure 1 Structure of LSI Driver Device </FIG>


  Moreover, when heat diffusion is used to obtain the 
high-voltage CMOS withstand voltage after the ion implantation 
process of the V[.sub]T[/] (threshold voltage) control gate, 
V[.sub]T[/] control becomes poor, and this limits low-voltage 
CMOS miniaturization. In current 20 V class LSI drivers, the 
high-voltage CMOS design rule is about 4-8 Êm, and the 
low-voltage CMOS design rule is about 1.2-3 Êm. For 5 V LSI 
drivers, a VLSI low-voltage process is used with a design rule 
of about 0.8-1.5 Êm. Table 1 compares the consolidation 
process and the low-voltage process.

  2. Current LSI Drivers 
  As shown in Figure 2, LSI data drivers can be divided into 
digital drivers and analog drivers. Digital drivers input 
digital multi-level data, and analog drivers input analog 
multi-level data. The number of output pins for both is a 
relatively large 120-192. 



<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-025L-25A>      Figure 2 Block Diagrams of Digital and Analog </FIG>


   (1) Digital Drivers 
  Digital drivers store multi-level data for one horizontal 
time frame in data memory at a high speed. When the next 
horizontal time frame begins, the output circuit is activated. 
As far as operation is concerned, within one horizontal time 
frame the driver needs to drive a TFT-LCD within about 30 Ês 
for a personal computer and within about 15 Ês for an EWS. 
Therefore, high speed is easily achieved. However, as the number 
of levels increases, the number of input pins also increases, 
which is a drawback. 
  A. 8 Level Drivers 
  The 8-16 level, multi-level drivers, which are the digital 
drivers most often manufactured, have an analog switch for each 
level in the output circuit, and they select a voltage source, 
supplied from the outside, for each level. Because the circuit 
construction is simple, high-voltage LSI drivers can be easily 
built, and those with an operating frequency of 15-20 MHz have 
been made into commercial products. Moreover, a special _g_ 
correction circuit is not needed because _g_ correction can be 
performed merely by adjusting the voltage sources of the 
different levels. Moreover, the driver itself does not require 
an analog circuit, so its low power consumption is an advantage. 
However, because the number of analog switches for the output 
circuit and voltage sources for the levels increase as the 
number of levels increases, the chip size of the LSI driver 
becomes huge and wiring the voltage sources for the levels on 
the LCD module becomes a problem. Therefore, its upper limit is 
about 16 levels. 
  B. 64 Level Drivers 
  Right now, there is active development of 5 V, 64 level LSI 
drivers that contain a D/C converter for the output circuit, and 
they utilize a 0.8-1.5 Êm VLSI low-voltage process. In the 
past, adequate drivers could not be made with the high-voltage 
process, but with the adoption of the miniature VLSI low-voltage 
CMOS process, it has become possible to construct a highly 
integrated D/A converter with high accuracy and low power 
consumption. By incorporating the D/A converter into the output 
circuit, a voltage source is not needed for each level, but the 
driver must have a _g_ correction circuit. If a correction is 
not made inside the LSI driver with a non-linear D/A, a D/A 
converter with about two bits more than the gradation data is 
needed. Therefore, many of the 64 level drivers now under 
development employ the method of supplementing with 3 bits 
between two voltage sources from among the 9 external voltage 
sources for the levels (Fig. 3). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-025L-26A>      Figure 3. _g_ Correction Method for 64 Level </FIG>


  In terms of physical properties, the drivers under 
development have an output deviation of +/-20 mV, an operating 
frequency of 20-35 MHz, and a power consumption of about 30 mW. 
  (2) Analog Drivers 
  Analog drivers keep analog multi-level data in an output S/H 
(sample and hold) circuit by sampling pulses and make their 
output through an analog amp. Therefore, in principle they are 
full color, and their circuitry is simple, but it is difficult 
to obtain a high accuracy analog amp and high speed/high 
accuracy S/H circuits with a high-voltage CMOS. 
  In the past, among the analog drivers for general use, those 
used mainly in commercial televisions had an output deviation of 
about +/-50 mV, an operating frequency of 5-15 MHz, and a power 
consumption of about 200 mW. At NEC, however, we have developed 
a dynamic range, 15 V analog driver for EWS with an output 
deviation of +/-20 mV, an operating frequency of 15 MHz, and a 
power consumption of 100 mW through improvements in the 
consolidation process (high-voltage CMOS). One example is shown 
below (Figure 4). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-025L-27A>      Figure 4 Example of EWS Analog Driver </FIG>


  A. Number of Input Ports 
  The analog signal coming into the driver directly enters the 
S/H circuit, but because the S/H circuit control signal passes 
through a 5 V control circuit, a dispersion in the 5 V control 
circuit is necessary as a sampling dynamic margin. Based on the 
sampling circuit, we can figure that this value will be several 
ns, and the sampling time will be about 15 MHz. Therefore, we 
chose 12 (RGBx4) as the number of analog input ports for the EWS. 
  B. Analog Amp 
  We encounter special difficulties with the analog amp at the 
output stage in terms of power consumption and accuracy. With 
power consumption, the TFT-LCD load capacitance of 100-200 pF 
becomes a problem. At the loaded drive stage, if we consider the 
source follower, to obtain a through rate of 1 V/Ês, we need 
a 
constant current source such that 200 pF x 1 V/Ês = 200 
ÊA. 
When we reach a power source voltage of 15 V and 192 output 
pins, we already have surpassed 500 mW. For the output stage 
analog amp, past methods include allowing a large current flow 
only at the instant when the current of the constant current 
source of the loaded driver stage source follower charges and 
discharges its load, or raising the output to the power source 
voltage and then driving it only in the direction taken by the 
analog amp drive current. The former does not lower power 
consumption sufficiently, and with the latter drive time is 
shortened, and a large current is stored in the panel when a 
large load capacitance is raised to the power source voltage. 
Therefore, we lowered power consumption by employing a 
pseudo-push/pull operation by combining an analog amp to handle 
the drive current during buildup and another analog amp to 
handle the drive current during trail off. 
  In terms of accuracy, we encountered particular difficulty 
in 
constructing the high-voltage CMOS. The bonding depth of the 
offset layers required for high voltage tends to deviate due to 
heat dispersion. Therefore, the channel length formed between 
two offset layers also tends to deviate, which often results in 
V[.sub]T[/] deviation. The offset deviation in the CMOS 
differential amp is dependent on V[.sub]T[/] deviation, so 
this results in an offset deviation of several tens of mV. We 
attempted to reduce V[.sub]T[/] deviation without lowering 
the withstand voltage by reducing this thermal hysteresis as 
much as possible to increase the accuracy of the high-voltage 
CMOS analog circuit. 
  C. S/H Circuit 
  Analog drivers require a high speed, high accuracy S/H 
circuit. Generally, the S/H circuits used with analog drivers 
are basic, non-feedback S/H circuits consisting of an analog 
switch and a hold capacitor. They are simple circuits in which 
high speeds can be easily obtained without increasing chip size. 
This type of S/H circuit corrects the feed-through voltage of 
the analog switch, which is the cause of error voltage, with a 
dummy switch half the width of the analog switch gate. In 
principle, however, this does not provide sufficient correction, 
and with a high-voltage CMOS the gm is low, so we 
must not only increase the channel width, but it is also 
extremely difficult to obtain high speed and high accuracy 
because the gate voltage is so large. To solve these problems we 
have reduced the surface area of the high-voltage CMOS gate and 
lowered the feed-through voltage to obtain the same 
gm by improving our consolidation process 
(high-voltage CMOS) described above. 
  D. Analog Input Chip Selection 
  In the past the analog input capacity of an analog driver 
has 
been about 1 pF/pin, but with the EWS we have 1280 pF, and there 
is a heavy burden on the peripheral circuits, so it is very 
difficult to convey a high-speed, accurate analog signal to the 
LSI driver. Because it is impossible to realize a high-speed, 
high accuracy, high-voltage CMOS analog amp, we could not place 
the analog amp in the analog input area, and input capacitance 
of the output S/H circuit appears in the analog input. We have 
reduced the analog input capacitance to 100 pF when ten drivers 
(192 output) are used by setting ON only the analog input of the 
chip that performs sampling, and by using analog input chip 
selection functions. 
<H5>  Future Trends in LSI Drivers </H5>
  We can expect the 64 level 5 V digital driver that uses 
0.8-1.5 Êm CMOS technology to bring about a diversification 
of 
the TFT-LCD through drive methods such as common inverse drive. 
However, when we make drivers more accurate, and make larger, 
more accurate TFT-LCDs, the peripheral circuit power will 
increase even if the TFT-LCDs themselves consume less power. We 
can manage to reduce the load on the peripheral circuits when we 
make high-voltage CMOS 64 level digital drivers that consume 
less power, and we can do this by improving the consolidation 
process (improving processes that reduce the causes of 
high-voltage CMOS deviations) and improving the circuitry. 
  We can expect wide use of analog drivers as well in 
applications that utilize analog input and theoretical full 
color properties; for example, in television, in the full color 
EWS, and in analog interfaces that require CRT compatibility. 
There is a report of a 5 V LSI driver that incorporates a 
high-speed amp for analog input and uses 5 V miniature process 
analog technology.[.sup]6[/] This greatly reduces the 
capacitance of analog input. Right now the mainstream number for 
driver output is 192, but in the future we can expect S-VGA 
applications with an output of 240 and a slimming down in the 
external dimensions of the driver. 
  The key points in using LSI drivers are the power 
consumption 
of the total system and the cost. Therefore, depending on the 
application we can expect system optimization that chooses 
between digital and analog drivers and between high-voltage LSI 
drivers and 5 V LSI drivers.

  [Text] The annual meeting of the Japan Atomic Industrial 
Forum Inc. (JAIF) (Chairman, Takashi Mukaibo) held in Hiroshima 
ended on 15th. During the three-day conference, it became 
obvious that Japan and Europe are anxious and the United States 
is critical toward commercial use of plutonium. Both Japanese 
and European officials involved in nuclear power activities 
countered with evidence of inadequate non-proliferation measures 
in the U.S. The JAIF emphasized non-proliferation issues 
through the meeting which was held at the site where the first 
atomic bomb was dropped. The meeting also produced reassurance 
of `cooperation' between Japan and Europe in the use of 
plutonium, an issue which has become critical with the 
achievement of criticality at the prototype `Monju' fast breeder 
reactor. 
  The meeting featured a session on `Nuclear Power Generation 
and Plutonium' during which the pros and cons of the commercial 
use of plutonium were vigorously debated. 
  C. E. Paine, a senior staff member of the American Natural 
Resources Protection Association stated, `It is a fact that 
nuclear bombs can be produced with plutonium generated by 
nuclear reactors.' He objected to the separation of plutonium 
from spent nuclear fuel by saying, `If plutonium stockpiles 
increase, it is difficult for nuclear inspectors to keep up with 
their job.' 
  On the other hand, Atomic Energy Bureau' s Nuclear Fuel 
Division Director Yasutaka Moriguchi of the Science and 
Technology Agency, criticized the direct disposal of spent fuel 
by the U.S. saying, `Plutonium mines will be created.' 
  Cogema Vice President J. L. Rikoh [phonetic] from France was 
obviously displeased with the U.S. Government and said, `If the 
U.S. does not like the separation of plutonium, they should stop 
exporting uranium. 
  Belgium nuclear fuel company Cynatom [phonetic]'s Special 
Advisor P. Felbeek [phonetic] indicated inadequate U.S. 
non-proliferation measures saying, `Japan and Europe are not the 
cause for concern. The problem lies in the United States which 
lacks definite safety measures for its militarily used 
plutonium.' He insisted that the plutonium gained as a result 
of dismantling nuclear weapons `should be mixed with uranium 
fuel and burned in reactors, from the economic perspective.' 
  Mitsubishi Materials Vice President Isami Akimoto said, 
`there are neither facilities nor personnel left in the U.S.' 
even if they wanted to burn the plutonium obtained through 
dismantling of nuclear weapons. He also stated, `The 
traditional policy of the U.S. for elimination of plutonium for 
use in peaceful nuclear power generation has failed.' 
  In response to these comments, U.S. Nuclear Management 
Research Insistute Director P. Rebensol [phonetic] (general 
participant), who opposes the use of plutonium by Japan 
proposed, It is not necessary to use plutonium if enriched 
uranium obtained through dismantling of nuclear weapons is 
reserved for later use. However, Tokyo Electric Power Company 
Vice President Makoto Ikegame arugued, `Uranium is a buyers' 
market. Therefore, it is not necessary to create reserves. It 
is not even worth considering such a proposal unless there is 
some specific measure planned (after the uranium researve is 
used).' 
  STA' s Moriguchi also opposed the uranium reserve proposal 
saying, `It represents short sighted thinking.' Differences in 
focus between Japan, where plutonium has a place in their 
long-term energy strategy, and the U.S., which is most concerned 
with the negative impact of what they consider the immediate 
threat of nuclear proliferation, were obvious. 
  Hiroshima Declaration of Non-Proliferation Treaty 
  On the 15th, the final day of their annual meeting, the JAIF 
adopted the `Hiroshima Declaration' which appeals for the 
elimination of nuclear weapons. The declaration included the 
statement that `indefinite extension without any general future 
perspective on the elimination of nuclear weapons is 
problematic' for extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) 
. The declaration contrasted with the Japanese Government' s 
position in support of indefinite extension of the NPT. It may 
have some impact on future discussions of the NPT extension 
issue. 
  During the press conference after the meeting, JAIF Chairman 
Takashi Mukaibo said, `Our main objective is to eliminate all 
nuclear weapons. We cannot agree to indefinite extension of the 
NPT while those who own nuclear weapons do not eliminate them.' 
  Former Prime Minister Hosokawa supported indefinite 
extension 
of the NPT at the UN General Session in September 1993. He 
obviously tried to eradicate the `groundless suspicion' of Japan 
owning nuclear arms. The JAIF reiterated their demand that 
nuclear weapon owning countries eliminate them.

  [Text] Nuclear Power Reactor Bureau Director Ermakov of 
Russia' s Ministry of Atomic Energy attended the annual meeting 
of the Japan Atomic Industrial Forum Inc. held 13-15 April 1994 
in Hiroshima. During a NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN press interview on 
the 13th, he disclosed that Russia is planning to request 
Japanese cooperation in the development of an advanced reactor. 
Russia wants to use the plutonium obtained through dismantling 
nuclear weapons for fuel. Russia soon will propose a 
cooperative arrangement through formal channels of the 
Japan-Russia Atomic Energy Agreement. 
  The cooperation request includes development of the 
800,000kW 
output ``BN-800'' fast breeder reactor. At present, its 
construction is temporarily on hold. They want to modify the 
existing core originally designed for fuel breeding to that for 
burning plutonium and long-life transuranium. They intend to 
process the plutonium produced through dismantling nuclear 
weapons in a way that will destroy it as it is burned as fuel. 
  Bureau Director Ermakov said, `They would like to promote 
development of the reactor as an international project along the 
lines of the International Tokamak Experimental Research.'

  [Text] It has been revealed that the plutonium-related 
project Japan was planning to promote at the International 
Science and Technology Center (in Moscow) has been halted due to 
the objection expressed by the U.S. The Center was created by 
four major countries, Japan, US, Europe, and Russia to prevent 
the outflow to other countries of scientists and engineers who 
had been involved in the development of mass destruction weapons 
in the former Soviet Union. It appears that the U.S. intends to 
put a stop to the plutonium research effort of Japan and Russia. 
This may cause considerable difficulty for Japan which is 
promoting plutonium research on a global scale. 
  The United States is objecting to two subjects of the 
research: 
  1) development of advanced fast reactors that use lead 
instead of sodium coolant; 
  2) research on group partition of radioactive waste. 
  Japan proposed these topics in response to requests from the 
Russians. The Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute is leading 
the research cooperation efforts. 
  The Board of Directors of the International Science and 
Technology Center met for the first time in Moscow on 17-18 
March 1994. The U.S. Government informed the Japanese 
Government just prior to the meeting of their ``objection to 
adopt a project that promotes the use of plutonium in Russia.'' 
  The reasons reported for their objections include: 
  1) fear of sloppy management of nuclear materials in Russia; 
  2) plutonium-related projects violate U.S. non-proliferation 
policy. 
  In response to their objections, the Japanese side stated, 
``it would be inappropriate not to adopt all of the 
plutonium-related projects because the Center' s objective is to 
prevent scientists and engineers who have been involved in 
plutonium developments from leaving the country.'' 
  There was no official discussion held during the Beard of 
Directors' meeting in March, but the projects in question were 
kept on hold. On the other hand, 23 projects (valued at $12 
million) including nuclear power safety technology which is not 
directly related with plutonium use, were confirmed for the 
first phase. Additional projects are supposed to be selected at 
the next Board of Directors meeting in June 1994. The Japanese 
government, in the mean time, will discuss with the U.S. side 
the validity of the plutonium-related projects. Some government 
sources are saying that a portion of the projects may have to be 
revised in order to proceed with the projects smoothly. 
<H5>  Greatly Cautious Toward Japan-Russia Cooperation </H5>
  [Commentary] This latest U.S. pressure on project selection 
at the International Science and Technology Center seems to have 
been motivated by deep-rooted American caution over Japan' s 
involvement with technologies related to mass destruction 
weapons as well as differences between the two countries' 
positions on the use of plutonium. 
  The Center has been established to provide research 
opportunities for peaceful purposes and to encourage those 
scientists and engineers who were involved in the development of 
nuclear weapons and missiles to switch jobs. It is only natural 
that doubts may arise about the possibility that weapons-related 
information flowing from those experts in the course of 
cooperation on plutonium-related projects with Japan. 
  On the other hand, Russia is eager to use plutonium for 
non-military purposes and is very eager to cooperate with Japan. 
  The U.S. does not interfere with Japan using plutonium in 
Japan. But it would oppose more active use of plutonium through 
cooperation between Japan and Russia. 
  Japan has offered to invest $20 million, almost 1/3 of the 
total funding for the International Science and Technology 
Center. Japan is eager to absorb the fruits of Russian research 
on fast reactors and plutonium. Those involved in promoting the 
project may become highly frustrated if they are unable to 
select research subjects freely because of US objections.

  [Text] The Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute (JAERI) 
has begun the `ROSA-AP600' program in which safety experiments 
will be conducted for the U.S.'s next generation AP60() light 
water reactor. The JAERI, in collaboration with the U.S. Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission (NRC) , will conduct experiments 
simulating accidents using JAERI' s large-scale test facility 
(LSTF) . They will continue for one year to collect the basic 
data necessary to meet AP600 design qualifications. 
  The LSTF can simulate the functions of a pressurized water 
reactor (PWR) of 1. 1 millionkW output. The height and position 
of the equipment are almost the same as an actual PWR, but the 
volume is 1/48 that of an actual PWR. It can examine what 
occurs in the reactor at the time of the accident by simulating 
the coolant' s flow rates in the reactor. 
  The UPS. asked the JAERI in 1992 to make safety evaluations 
of the AP600 using their high performance LSTF, the world' s 
largest such facility. In response to the request, the JAERI 
modified the LSTF to conform to the structure of the gravity 
injection-type emergency core cooling system (ECCS) of the AP600 
and finally began experimenting. 
  The first experiment conducted on the 14th confirmed that 
the 
ECCS operated properly to cool down the core by simulating 
conditions under which a 2.5 cm diameter hole would develop in a 
pipe in the reactor. To collect comprehensive data, one test 
per month will be conducted hereafter by simulating conditions 
created by damage of much larger scale.

<F P=106> [Article by Shinichi Kawarada, Director, Nuclear Power Back </F>
End Promotion Office, Science and Technology Agency] 
  [Excerpt] 
<H5>  1. Foreword </H5>
  In this article, I will discuss policy trends and future 
developments concerning disposal of high level radioactive waste 
(HLW), which is of particular interest recently to the nation. 
My own personal opinions have been incorporated into this 
presentation. 
<H5>  2. Characteristics of HLW and Amount Generated </H5>
  In Japan, HLW refers to waste liquid that has been separated 
in the process of extracting uranium and plutonium in the 
reprocessing of spent fuel. In other countries, however, HLW may 
refer to the spent fuel itself. That is, in Japan and France, 
nuclear fuel is recycled to make the most effective use of 
resources, but in countries such as the United States, Canada 
and Sweden, HLW refers to the spent fuel itself. 
  In comparing the two, it is found that after processing, the 
former type of HLW is more compact and contains less 
radioactivity. Also, in terms of the period of continuing 
radioactivity, which depends mainly on the amount of TRU 
(transuranic) nuclides in the HLW, the former type of HLW allows 
more rational control of radioactive waste and is more 
appropriate from the viewpoint of environmental protection. 
  The amount of HLW generated is extremely small compared to 
other non-specific waste (if half of the electricity one 
Japanese uses in a lifetime (80 years) is generated by nuclear 
energy, the amount of HLW created in the process is about the 
size of three golf balls). On the other hand, HLW is extremely 
radioactive because it contains a large amount of fission 
products, and it generates heat. Also, while small in volume, it 
includes TRU nuclides with very long half-life. 
  At present, the only HLW generated in Japan is at the Tokai 
Reprocessing Plant of the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel 
Development Corporation (PNC); and 516 cubic meters had been 
generated as of the end of March 1993. This is stored safely in 
tanks at the plant. Furthermore, Japan Nuclear Fuel is building 
a commercial reprocessing plant in Rokkasho-Mura, Aomori 
Prefecture, and from the year 2000, HLW is expected to be 
generated from operation of that plant. Also, the electric power 
companies currently have contracted with Great Britain and 
France for spent fuel reprocessing services and the uranium and 
plutonium recovered from the reprocessing, along with the HLW, 
is to be returned to Japan. 
  The forecasted volume of HLW that will be generated in the 
future takes all of these factors into consideration and will be 
changed substantially by the reprocessing plans and the scale of 
nuclear power generation in the future, but it is thought that 
the volume will be 40,000 to 50,000 vitrified units of HLW in 
the 2030s to 2040s, when disposal sites are expected to be in 
operation. 
  Consequently, measures that deal with these characteristics 
must be taken to dispose of this volume of HLW. This means 
solidifying HLW, which is generated in the form of waste liquid, 
into a safe form; cooling the solidified HLW until it is in a 
disposable state; and disposing of the HLW in a form that can be 
isolated for a long time so that it does not affect the human 
living environment. 
<H5>  3. Basic HLW Disposal Policy </H5>

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-025L-32A>      Figure 1:  HLW Storage </FIG>

  Japan's basic measures to deal with HLW liquid generated in 
spent fuel reprocessing includes (a) solidifying HLW into a 
stable form (glass), (b) storing it for 30 to 50 years for 
cooling and (3) disposing of it in deep strata several hundred 
meters underground (geologic disposal). Many foreign countries 
use the same disposal method. 
  The following are the general steps to be taken to implement 
the basic measures: 
  (a) Establish the technology to vitrify the HLW liquid; 
  (b) decide on a storage facility site and build a facility 
where the vitrified HLW can be stored; 
  (c) carry out R&amp;D to establish technologies needed for 
disposal, and along with this, decide on a disposal site and 
safely dispose of the HLW. 
  First, vitrification technology is in actual use in France 
and Great Britain. In Japan, cold test operation is underway at 
the vitrification technology development facility (TVF) in PNC's 
Tokai Works, and hot test operation using real liquid waste is 
scheduled for FY94. Thus vitrification technology can be 
considered as established for all intents and purposes. 
  Two storage facilities are being planned. One is for storage 
of vitrified HLW generated at PNC's Tokai Reprocessing Plant. 
This will be one of the functions of the ``Storage Engineering 
Center'' that PNC plans to build in Horonobe-Machi, Hokkaido, at 
the invitation of that town. However, the siting has not gone 
smoothly, due to opposition to the town's invitation by the 
Hokkaido governor and legislature. 
  The second storage facility is for vitrified HLW that will 
be 
returned from Great Britain and France, as mentioned earlier. 
This facility already is under construction at the Japan Nuclear 
Fuel site in Rokkasho-Mura, Aomori Prefecture. 
  As for HLW disposal, on 28 August 1992, the experts' group 
on 
radioactive waste of the Japan Atomic Energy Commission (JAEC) 
released a report entitled ``Concerning HLW Countermeasures'' 
that described a concrete vision of how to proceed with HLW 
countermeasures, which had not necessarily been clear until that 
point. In particular, the report made clear the steps, timetable 
and each organization's role and share of responsibility for 
disposal as a whole. As head of the office that served as the 
secretariat that compiled the report, I was most keenly aware 
that the report had to unveil before the Japanese people and 
gain their understanding and cooperation for HLW disposal. To do 
so, the report had to be highly transparent and include in 
concrete terms the policies that should be taken and the 
timetable that should be followed to achieve appropriate and 
safe disposal of HLW in the future. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-025L-34A>      HLW Disposal Flow </FIG>



  In accordance with the long-term plan for development and 
use 
of nuclear energy, which was set forth by the JAEC (in June 
1987), the steps prior to implementation of geologic disposal of 
HLW are to proceed in four phases: ``Selection of effective 
strata (phase 1);'' ``selection of prospective disposal site 
(phase 2);'' ``demonstration of disposal technology at the 
prospective disposal site (phase 3);'' and ``construction, 
operation and shutdown of the disposal facility (phase 4).'' 
  At present we are in phase 2. Scheduled for this phase are: 
R&amp;D aimed at establishing disposal technology; and on the 
other 
hand, selection of the prospective disposal site by the disposal 
project's primary implementer (to be formed at an appropriate 
date), based on overall consideration of such factors as the 
results of R&amp;D, social conditions and regional conditions. 
  However, the way phase 2 was set up gave the mistaken 
impression that the results of R&amp;D will be directly linked to 
the process of selecting the prospective disposal site, and it 
is believed that this was one hindrance to the siting of the 
R&amp;D 
facility, which is not really directly related to the disposal 
site selection process. For this reason, the two were described 
separately in the report, to make it clear that disposal and 
R&amp;D 
are to be advanced concurrently. 
  In the future, instead of explaining things in a conceptual 
manner in terms of the four phases, we want to explain things 
concretely by showing individual processes. This will ensure 
that there will be no misunderstanding. 
<H5>  4. HLW Disposal Implementation </H5>

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-025L-36A>      Figure 3: Steps in HLW Geologic Disposal </FIG>


  What must be considered when carrying out the disposal is 
when, where and how to carry out the disposal project. 
  ``Industrial waste'' generated during industrial activity 
normally is processed and and disposed of by the parties that 
create the waste in accordance with the ``law concerning waste 
processing and cleanup,'' which states the principle that the 
waste creator is responsible for disposal. In the case of HLW, 
however, due to the length of time needed for disposal and the 
safety requirements, the national government must play a certain 
role in addition to the electric power companies (the waste 
creators). This is clearly a more active government 
responsibility regarding ``industrial waste'' than set forth in 
the abovementioned law. 
  To implement the disposal project smoothly and without 
confusion, the first thing to do is clarify the work shares of 
the government and the private sector. 
  The following is the disposal project framework, in the 
order 
given in the report. 
<H5>  (1) Government and Private Sector Workshares </H5>
  Certainly, the government and private sector must work as 
one 
in carrying out the necessary measures for disposal, but this 
will not be effective if responsibilities and roles are not 
clear. 
  The national government, the electric power companies and 
PNC 
are the three parties involved, and the report separates their 
roles as follows: 
  (a) The national government is responsible for appropriate 
and complete disposal, and it also will draw up the policies 
needed to advance the disposal project smoothly. 
  (b) The electric power companies are called upon to cover 
the 
cost of disposal and also to carry out a role in the R&amp;D 
stage 
that fully reflects their responsibility as the HLW creator. 
  (c) For the present, PNC will be called upon to implement 
steadily surveys of the geological environment and R&amp;D. 
  PNC's role is easy to understand because it involves R&amp;D 
without direct involvement in the disposal itself. There may be 
those who are not quite sure about the relationship between the 
government and the electric power companies, however, and I want 
to supplement the above with some of my own observations. 
  The electric power companies naturally must take 
responsibility as the waste creators, but as stated earlier, in 
view of the work involved in HLW disposal, the long-term nature 
of the disposal and other circumstances, the relationship was 
set up in this way because it was desirable that, in addition to 
the responsibility of the electric power companies as the waste 
creators, the government also bear responsibility for 
``appropriate'' and ``complete'' disposal and for drawing up 
measures such as new legal measures and regional promotion 
measures if needed to proceed smoothly with the disposal project. 
  You may be wondering exactly what ``appropriate'' and 
``complete'' involve. I believe that they include the following: 
  ``Appropriate'' probably involves ensuring that the form and 
method of disposal are appropriate and safe. Thus in terms of 
form, ``geologic disposal'' is stated as government policy and 
in terms of method, the government has indicated that its policy 
is to carry out R&amp;D to ensure that the methods used for 
geologic 
disposal are appropriate and safe, and has designated PNC and 
the primary research organization that will take the lead in 
carrying out the R&amp;D. Incidentally, final assurance of safety 
probably will be through safety inspections by the government. 
  ``Complete'' means that the disposal will be carried out 
thoroughly over what is expected to be a long period of time. 
That is why the government must be responsible for guaranteeing 
the permanence of the primary implementer of the disposal and 
for providing the systems needed to carry out disposal 
thoroughly, with cooperation and understanding from the people. 
<H5>  (2) Timing and Form of Primary Disposal Implementer </H5>
  It has been customary for the waste creator itself to 
dispose 
of the waste (this is actually the case for ``industrial 
waste''), or for the waste creator to contract a waste expert to 
do it. However, things are not that simple in the case of HLW. 
There certainly are no nuclear waste disposal firms, nor will 
there be in the near future. 
  Thus an appropriate primary implementer must be formed based 
on the shared roles of the government and the electric power 
companies, as pointed out in Part (1) above. 
  Although there are some who believe that this primary 
implementer should be formed immediately, the report takes the 
view that right now, time should be used to make steady advances 
in R&amp;D on geologic disposal and in gaining the understanding 
of 
the Japanese people. It maintains that, taking various 
circumstances into consideration, the primary implementer should 
be formed around the year 2000. 
  The report maintains that further study is needed regarding 
the form of the primary implementer. The study should consider 
such requirements as guaranteeing permanent disposal, 
responsibility of the waste creators and application of the 
results of R&amp;D. 
  The report also expresses the thinking that the time has 
come 
to begin to really address disposal measures, and points out 
that it is desirable for the consultative committee on HLW 
measures promotion (formed in October 1992; composed of three 
members: the government (director-general of the Science and 
Technology Agency's Atomic Energy Bureau and the 
director-general of MITI's Agency of Natural Resources and 
Energy), the chairman of the Federation of Electric Power 
Companies, and the president of PNC) to begin a study 
immediately on the composition of the primary implementer, and 
for a preparatory organization to be formed as soon as possible. 
<H5>  (3) Establishment of High Level Project Promotion </H5>
Preparatory Committee 
  Based on the above recommendation, the consultative 
committee 
on HLW measures promotion carried out intense studies aimed at 
immediate formation of a preparatory body, then established a 
high level project promotion preparatory committee on 29 May 
1993. The preparatory committee is subordinate to the 
consultative committee, and has its own secretariat. 
  The preparatory committee will not become the primary 
implementer automatically. JAEC will review the results of the 
preparatory committee's studies from a comprehensive viewpoint 
and based on that, the primary implementer will be established. 
  As for the administrative composition of the preparatory 
committee, JAEC member Hayashi was appointed the committee 
chairman and there are nine other members, including a secretary 
general (as of 1 July 1993). 
<H5>  (4) Steps Leading to Disposal </H5>
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  Of the series of steps and procedures leading to disposal, 
the most important and difficult probably is selection of the 
disposal site. Selection is to be done by the primary 
implementer, then approved by the government. 
  The Japanese people probably are most concerned about three 
points: When will the primary implementer make the selection and 
where will it be; how will the decision be made; and how will 
the people be involved in the selection process. 
  The report naturally does not give the name of the site, 
which is completely undecided. It does not give a selection date 
because there are undetermined factors. Regarding the selection 
procedures, however, the report states that the primary 
implementer will explain the disposal project to the local 
government of the area around the prospective site and get its 
approval. Emphasis is given to getting prior approval from the 
local residents. In other words, the the step of government 
approval of the disposal site will not be taken if local 
approval has not been received. Underlying this thinking is the 
hope that this will dispel the suspicions of the local 
residents, which arose when the deep strata research facility 
(to be discussed later) was sited, that the facility would 
gradually be converted into the disposal site. 
  The report states that once the site is set, the primary 
implementer will survey the features of the site to determine 
its appropriateness and also will validate the disposal 
technology. The report also gives a rough timetable for the 
disposal project, with the aim of beginning operation of the 
disposal site from the 2030s, or the mid-2040s at the latest. 
  The operation commencement date was set by assuming that the 
primary implementer will be formed around the year 2000, and 
then considering factors such as the time needed for steady 
implementation of the disposal steps, future reprocessing 
programs and other nuclear energy development, and the fact that 
the vitrified HLW returning from Great Britain and France will 
be stored 30 to 50 years for cooling. 
  When will the disposal site be selected? There are various 
undetermined factors, but around 2010 to 2015 was presumed in 
terms of the schedule given in the report. 
<H5>  5. Disposal Site Control </H5>
  Japan has chosen geologic disposal as the method for 
disposing of HLW, as have other countries that are proceeding 
with nuclear energy development. The reason is that the geologic 
disposal concept is based on safe disposal that does not rely on 
future generations to be responsible for maintaining the 
soundness of the disposal system. In other words, geologic 
disposal is a concept that does not rely on international, 
systematic control to ensure safety after the site is shut down 
(i.e., the hole that has been dug is filled back up and returned 
to its original state). 
  On the other hand, the people are very uneasy about the fact 
that geologic disposal removes the HLW from human control. 
  Recognizing this, the report maintains that introducing the 
idea of a control system for monitoring and maintaining records 
after shutdown of the disposal site would be one effective way 
to gain the understanding of the Japanese people. That is why 
studies from a technological viewpoint should continue on the 
significance, content and timeframe of a control system. 
  The word ``control'' has various meanings when referring to 
HLW. This has caused some confusion, which needs to be 
straightened out. 
  One case is when ``control'' is used in the sense of 
permanent storage, either above or below ground, of vitrified 
HLW. Some people think that this is good from the viewpoint of 
getting the understanding and concurrence of the people, but the 
policy has been not to use that method because it is not 
desirable to burden future generations and because geologic 
disposal, which even goes as far as refilling the disposal site, 
is more appropriate from the viewpoint of ensuring safety for an 
extremely long time. 
  A second meaning is ``control'' from the time that a site 
for 
geologic disposal is opened to the time it is refilled. The 
period of this control is estimated to be from 10 to 100 years. 
The effect on the surrounding environment by the HLW that has 
been firmly fixed into underground strata can be checked 
adequately during that period, and if there is any problem, it 
is even possible to withdraw the HLW. Moreover, since shutdown 
of the disposal site is done after a full check on whether 
safety can be assured for an extremely long time, it is 
inconceivable that trouble would arise after shutdown. 
  A third meaning is ``control'' after shutdown of the 
disposal 
site. This is the ``control'' that is mentioned in the report. 
The concept of geologic disposal is that safety after shutdown 
of the disposal site will not depend on a control system after 
the shutdown. Thus control after shutdown is not required to 
ensure safety. However, because there probably are those who 
feel uneasy about not having any controls after the shutdown, it 
has been maintained that future study is needed on what sort of 
control system would be appropriate in terms of gaining the 
people's understanding. At that time, it will be necessary to 
consider the will and the attitude of the people, and 
thereafter, a sociological approach will be important. Thus one 
possible approach would be to carry out a question-and-answer 
survey. 
<H5>  6. R&amp;D Implementation </H5>
  Progress in R&amp;D creates a foundation for disposal 
implementation, and steady implementation of R&amp;D and wide 
knowledge about its progress is extremely important in order to 
gain the people's understanding and cooperation for geologic 
disposal. Furthermore, since R&amp;D extends over a long period 
of 
time, the government must render judgments on the adequacy of 
R&amp;D at every stage of new discovery. 
  PNC has been the primary research institution conducting 
R&amp;D 
related to geologic disposal, and last September, it compiled 
and published its R&amp;D achievements in the ``technical report 
of 
HLW geologic disposal R&amp;D'' (first report). The majority 
reaction of the parties involved was that progress so far has 
been good in that the R&amp;D results have clarified the 
technological base for work to be done to ensure the safety of 
geologic disposal, and that henceforth, emphasis should be on 
investigative research on conditions in the geological 
environment and, if possible, data should be provided concerning 
actual deep underground strata in specific locations. 
  JAEC confirmed the progress achieved in each of three 
research areas --investigative research on conditions in the 
geological environment, R&amp;D on disposal technology and 
performance assessment research -- and it expressed praise for 
the overall soundness of the research. This was provided in a 
report entitled `` concerning the state of progress of HLW 
disposal R&amp;D.'' 
  The conclusion, in a nutshell, was that the R&amp;D 
described in 
this technological report was advancing in an appropriate, 
steady manner and that it could be concluded at this stage to be 
generally sound. JAEC also listed the geologic disposal R&amp;D 
issues to be addressed in the future in each of the 
abovementioned three research areas and further pointed out the 
importance of a deep strata research facility as a matter shared 
by the three disciplines. 
  The second report is scheduled to be compiled before the 
year 
2000. Even the timing of this report is considered very 
significant, and JAEC will set up an evaluation committee to 
assess it. 
  A matter of interest to many of the concerned parties is 
whether the results of research at the deep strata research 
facility can be included in the second report. No definite 
outlook can be given at this time because it greatly depends on 
progress in the siting of the ``storage engineering center'' 
project. PNC has been working on this after getting an 
invitation from Horonobe-Machi in Hokkaido. Even if substantial 
progress was to be made soon on the siting and the decision to 
build the deep strata research facility were to be made, a 
preliminary survey requiring about two years would be necessary. 
Considering such time restraints, it is doubtful that much 
significant data could be contributed to the report. 
  Nevertheless, even if that data will not be ready, the plan 
is to have measurements of the artificial barrier virtually 
completed by that time. Data also can be expected from on-site 
testing being conducted in Kamaishi City, Iwate Prefecture, and 
the ``geologic disposal basic research facility'' in PNC's Tokai 
Works that has been operating on a full scale since October 
1993. Thus the report will have fairly substantive content. 
<H5>  7. Deep Strata Research Facility </H5>
  The most important and urgent task that needs to be carried 
out in R&amp;D concerning geologic disposal, from the viewpoint 
of 
disposal of vitrified HLW, is to acquire physical and chemical 
data on what sort of environment actually exists in the deep 
underground strata, especially the characteristics of base rock 
and the nature and flow of ground water. To do this, a deep 
strata research facility needs to be established as soon as 
possible. 
  Advance consideration also should be given to opening up the 
facility to all who are interested and making it possible for 
people to observe the actual deep strata. 
  PNC is supposed to establish this research facility, but as 
stated earlier, the ``storage engineering center'' project which 
includes the deep strata research facility and is slated to be 
built in Horonobe-Machi, Hokkaido, is opposed by the governor 
and legislature of Hokkaido. 
  The main reason for the opposition is the suspicion that 
once 
the siting of the ``storage engineering center'' is approved, 
the surrounding area automatically will become the final 
disposal site. 
  To dispel this suspicion, the report states clearly the 
government's policy that ``planning of the deep strata research 
facility and the disposal site will be clearly separate.'' I.e., 
the deep strata research facility will not automatically become 
the disposal site. Also, as mentioned earlier, the primary 
implementer must get prior approval from the local residents 
when selecting the disposal site. Thus if the primary 
implementer should at some point in time approach the local 
residents about converting the deep strata research facility 
into a disposal site, and if this was rejected, it would be 
impossible to establish the disposal site there. I therefore am 
confident that this suspicion can be laid to rest. 
  The report also states that the geological features of Japan 
make it desirable to have multiple deep strata research 
facilities. The geological features of Japan can be divided into 
two broad categories: sedimentary rock base and crystalline rock 
base. Since the actual disposal site has not be decided, at 
least one research for each of these types of rock base must be 
established. The Horonobe area has sedimentary rock-based 
strata, so another research facility must be established in 
another area for crystalline rock-based deep strata. 
<H5>  8. Covering Disposal Cost and Regional Co-Existence </H5>
  The report states that in terms of the principle that the 
waste creators should bear a fair share of the disposal cost, 
ensuring funds to cover the cost should begin at an early date. 
It also points out that the time has come to estimate the 
rational cost as soon as possible and, based on that estimate, 
draw up concrete plans for ensuring funds to cover the cost. 
Total cost of disposal, based on estimates by other countries 
for their disposal projects, probably will be around several 
trillion yen at current prices. 
  When the concrete cost becomes clear, an image of the 
disposal site will be formed, and this will contribute to 
increasing the people's awareness of the necessity of the 
disposal undertaking. 
  When addressing regional co-existence, the report separates 
the disposal site from the deep strata research facility. 
  First, with regard to the prospective disposal site, the 
report says that the various surveys will take a long time and 
will be followed by a long period of construction and operation 
of the disposal site, and it therefore would be desirable to 
conduct studies on how to proceed with regional promotion in 
accordance with the actual state of the disposal site, including 
system improvements. The report then points out that the studies 
should cover the creation of a new regional promotion system, 
not just improvement of the existing system, which is based on 
the three principles of power resources. 
  The report also says that a study of a regional promotion 
plan for the deep strata research facility is needed as well, 
and that from the viewpoint of effective use of underground 
space, multiple use of the facility should be studied as well. 
<H5>  9. [omitted] </H5>
<H5>  10. Future Topics </H5>
  The government has worked actively on the development and 
use 
of nuclear energy, but it is a fact that it has encountered all 
sorts of criticism in the course of doing so. Regardless of this 
criticism, a record of safe operation of nuclear power plants 
has been built, and this has become a part of our lives. 
  Until now, there was a great deal of criticism about the 
safety of nuclear power generation, but criticism recently has 
focused on the nuclear fuel recycling policy and the radioactive 
waste disposal policy. It is believed that there are two main 
reasons for this. One is the domestic reason: the emphasis of 
nuclear energy related undertakings is shifting from nuclear 
power generation to the nuclear fuel cycle. The other is the 
international reason: with the breakdown of the cold war 
structure, attention has focused on the issue of dismantling of 
nuclear weapons and the extraction of plutonium, which has 
arisen because of reduction of U.S. and Russian nuclear 
arsenals, and on the related issue of pollution by nuclear 
weapon manufacturing facilities. 
  Plutonium use is not the subject of this article, so I will 
not go into it in detail. Nevertheless, as long as nuclear power 
generation is carried out, plutonium and other actinides 
inevitably will be generated in the reactors, nuclear fission of 
some of the plutonium takes place in the reactors and, as part 
of fuel, constantly contributes to the generation of electric 
power. The plutonium problem cannot be ignored so long as 
nuclear power generation is promoted. It is important to accept 
this fact and consider how to deal with this problem in the 
future. 
  Much of the recent criticism about radioactive waste is on 
HLW disposal, which has become the focus of interest with 
progress on the nuclear fuel cycle undertaking in Rokkasho-Mura, 
Aomori Prefecture. The criticism is that we should not proceed 
with the nuclear fuel cycle undertaking when there are no clear 
prospects for the final HLW disposal site. While it is true that 
the final disposal site is totally undecided, not one country in 
the world that is pursuing nuclear energy development and use 
has set up or started building a final disposal site. However, 
it is essential, naturally, to clearly establish a plan of the 
processes and steps leading to construction and operation of a 
final site. 
  Aware of the above, the report sets forth a future path, 
based on the progress made so far on HLW countermeasures and 
points that have been reconsidered. 
  Consequently, henceforth it is crucial that policies 
following this path be implemented steadily. Specific policies 
that should be taken first of all are: 
  (a) The high level project promotion preparatory committee 
should carry out full-scale public relations activities 
concerning the soundness and safety of HLW disposal; 
  (b) steady progress should be made on R&amp;D to ensure that 
geologic disposal will be sound and safe. 
  It is especially important to put maximum effort into 
establishing the deep strata research facility at an early date 
because it can contribute greatly not only to advancement of 
R&amp;D 
but also to public relations activities. In this connection, the 
``storage engineering center'' must be realized at an early date. 
  The contents of the project can be divided into the 
functions 
of temporary storage of the vitrified HLW units and the 
functions of the deep strata research facility, but since these 
two are packaged together, there is concern that the center 
automatically will become the disposal site in the future. There 
also is suspicion based on a variety of past circumstances. 
  That is why a proposal by the local government of 
Horonobe-Machi is considered one way to deal with the situation. 
  That is, go ahead and build the deep strata research 
facility 
because it will be a cold plant that will not handle radioactive 
materials, but hold storage related facilities as a matter for 
further deliberation. Once even a part of the research begins, 
many researchers and technicians will be assigned to the area, 
there will be a greater relationship of trust with the local 
residents, and emotional opposition arising from distrust will 
disappear gradually. Once that happens, I think that the 
people's understanding can be attained regarding storage related 
facilities as well. 
  Incidentally, another deep strata research facility must be 
set up in a crystalline rock-based area. Efforts must be made to 
realize this quickly as well. 
  Also, legal measures needed when implementing the disposal 
project must be considered as a medium to long-term issue. New 
legal measures have not been drawn up in order to proceed with 
individual projects such as the reprocessing enterprise and 
low-level radioactive waste burial. In the case of HLW disposal, 
however, considering not only its uniqueness and difficulties 
but also the situation in France, the perception of most of the 
parties concerned is that new legal measures are needed. 
  Consideration must be given to the fact there there is a 
difference in attitude and awareness about laws between the 
Japanese and the people of France and other western countries, 
and careful consideration must be given to whether the so-called 
method of procedural laws, in which siting procedures are 
prescribed by law, would be suitable in Japan. Nevertheless, 
legal status should be given at least to such things as the 
primary implementer and regional promotion policies, and legal 
measures in some form need to be studied. 
<H5>  11. In Conclusion </H5>
  Needless to say, a stable supply of energy is essential to 
realizing, maintaining and developing comfortable living 
conditions for the people. From the viewpoint of a stable 
supply, realizing that goal must be premised on reducing as much 
as possible dependence on oil and increasing energy demand [as 
in text] in the future. The only way to achieve this is to 
endeavor to conserve energy and actively advance the development 
and use of reliable alternatives to oil. It is not realistic to 
expect substantial amounts of energy from solar and other new 
forms of energy. That is why development and use of nuclear 
energy as an alternative to oil is being promoted as a realistic 
policy. 
  However, it is a fact that the image of nuclear energy, 
which 
was so bright in the early stages of research, has faded and 
holds little attraction for the young scientists that will be 
responsible for R&amp;D in the future. 
  Burnishing that image by ensuring that a high level of 
technological development has been perfected in the field of 
nuclear energy is a task for those of us who are promoting 
development and use of nuclear energy. I believe that the 
following should be carried out simultaneously to carry out that 
task. 
  First, We should steadily carry out the measures needed for 
appropriate disposal of HLW so that the burden is not left to 
future generations. 
  Second, We should promote R&amp;D on (a) technologies aimed 
at 
making resources out of useful substances in HLW and (b) 
technologies to reduce the half-life or convert TRU elements 
into non-radioactive nuclides by using nuclear reactors or 
accelerators. In the latter category, the Japan Atomic Energy 
Research Institute (JAERI) and PNC are conducting R&amp;D on 
``nuclide separation/annihilation processing.'' Japan has 
advocated this in the OECD/NEA, and is proceeding with 
international cooperation and exchange of information. 
  Parties involved in nuclear energy must address these issues 
actively and work to gain greater trust in the development and 
use of nuclear energy by finding and enhancing the benefits it 
offers.

  [Excerpt] Scientific Solution for Geologic Disposal: R&amp;D 
<H5>  1. High Level Waste </H5>
<H5>  (1) Vitrification </H5>
  The vitrification method adopted in Japan is the LFCM 
(liquid 
fed ceramic melter) method, in which high-level radioactive 
waste (HLW) and the raw material for boro-silicated glass are 
melted in a melting furnace made of fire-resistant ceramic 
material. 
  The high-temperature glass that fuses the radioactive waste 
is poured into stainless steel canisters and when the glass is 
cooled and solidified, covers are welded on. These are 
transferred to vitrified unit holding cells, and deposited 
there. The vitrified units manufactured at the Power Reactor and 
Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation (PNC) vitrification 
technology development facility, where hot testing is scheduled 
to begin in FY94, each weighs about 300 kg and has a capacity of 
about 110 l. This is the volume of HLW generated from 
1 ton of spent fuel. Figure 2 shows the vitrification process 
and Photograph 1 [omitted] shows vitrified units. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-025L-40A>      Figure 2: Vitrification Process </FIG>


<H5>  (2) Vitrified Unit Characteristics </H5>
  Radioactivity: Included in vitrified units are 
fission products (FP) and actinide elements. The majority of FP, 
such as cesium-137 and strontium-90, have relatively short 
half-lives, high radiation levels; and emit beta rays and gamma 
rays. 
  These FP are the main cause of heating of vitrified units. 
Most actinides such as plutonium and americium have long 
half-lives and emit alpha rays. Table 1 is an example of 
solidified glass composition. The change in the radioactivity of 
vitrified units over time is shown in Figure 3. In the first 
stage after solidification (several hundred years after removal 
from a nuclear reactor), radioactivity by FP is dominant. These 
FP decay, and after 1,000 years, radioactivity has been reduced 
to several thousandths the level at time of vitrification. 
Thereafter, low-level radioactivity, mainly by actinides, 
continues to decay but remains for a long period of time.

  Heat Value: One of the characteristics of the 
vitrified units is that the decaying of FP creates heat, and 
this must be taken into consideration when disposal in deep 
strata is carried out. Figure 4 shows the results of analysis of 
the change over time in heat volume of vitrified units, using 
the ORIGEN 2 fuel burnup calculation code. The analysis was 
premised on cooling for 3 years after extraction from the 
nuclear reactor, cooling for 1 year as HLW liquid after 
reprocessing, and an interim storage period of 30 years after 
vitrification. After about 150 years, heat volume is 100 W per 
unit. The above is a factor when measures for geologic disposal 
of HLW are considered.

<H5>  2. Ensuring Safety of Geologic Disposal </H5>
  In using nuclear energy, our generation receives its 
benefits 
and at the same time, we are creating HLW. We believe that our 
generation must be responsible for coming up with appropriate 
countermeasures to ensure that this HLW does not affect human 
beings and their environment in the future. The method of 
controlling HLW by long-term storage above ground passes on to 
future generations the burden of continuing to be responsible 
for safe control. Therefore, Japan and other countries of the 
world think that geologic disposal is a realistic method by 
which the generation that receives the benefits of nuclear 
energy can achieve permanent safe control of the HLW. 
<H5>  (1) Geologic Disposal Concept </H5>
  The concept of geologic disposal is one in which HLW is 
buried in base rock deep underground so that it will not affect 
human beings and their environment. This concept has been 
studied internationally since the 1950s, and today, the 
countries that are studying HLW disposal unanimously agree that 
geologic disposal is the most rational and achievable disposal 
method, and are proceeding with R&amp;D on this problem This is 
because, when compared with the earth's surface, the area deep 
underground is much less affected by glacial activity, erosion 
and other natural factors as well has human activity, and it is 
therefore projected that waste can be safely preserved there for 
a long period of time without continuous human intervention (see 
Figure 5). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-025L-42A>      Figure 4: Change Over Time of Vitrified </FIG>


  In trying to guarantee safe geologic disposal, it is 
important to bury the HLW in a stable stratum to prevent 
pyrogenic activity, earthquake/faults, or upheaval/erosion from 
bringing the HLW into direct proximity to human beings (the 
proximity scenario), and at the same time to prevent 
radionuclides from flowing into ground water from the waste and 
being carried to the biosphere by the ground water and affecting 
human beings (the ground water scenario). As a mechanism to 
guarantee safety, a multiple barrier system is being studied, in 
which multiple man-made layers for safety and protection 
(artificial barrier) and a variety of strata that already are 
available to provide safety and protection (natural barrier) are 
combined. 
  The idea of guaranteeing safety against the ground water 
scenario through the multiple barrier system is based on the 
following three requirements (see Figure 6). 
  (a) Limit the possibility of contact between the vitrified 
unit and ground water to an adequately low level (prevention of 
contact with ground water). 
  (b) Even if there is contact between the vitrified unit and 
ground water, make it difficult for nuclides in the vitrified 
unit to elute, and even if they do, make it difficult for the 
nuclides to be moved to the biosphere (prevention of elution and 
movement). 
  (c) Even if nuclides elute and are moved, ensure that they 
decay adequately in the course of passing through the geological 
environment to the human environment, and that the concentration 
of nuclides becomes low enough not to affect the human 
environment significantly. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-025L-43A>      Figure 5: HLW Countermeasures Goals </FIG>

 &lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

<H5>  (2) Composition and Function of Multiple Barrier System </H5>
  Based on the multiple barrier system concept, the HLW 
(vitrified) is sealed in a container that is very strong called 
``overpacking'', then buried, and the surrounding area is filled 
with a claylike buffer material that has low water permeability. 
In this case, the artificial barrier is composed of the 
vitrified unit, the overpacking and the buffer material. 
  The vitrified unit does not easily dissolve in ground water 
and functions to stop radionuclides from flowing into ground 
water. 
  The overpacking physically protects the vitrified unit from 
ground pressure far below the surface, and also prevents contact 
between the vitrified unit and ground water. Carbon steel, 
titanium and copper are promising candidates for the overpacking 
material. Carbon steel is the most promising because it is 
relatively easy to assess corrosive behavior, it is easy to 
satisfy conditions such as mechanical hardness and 
processability, and it can be expected to make the surrounding 
chemical atmosphere reducible. 
  The low water permeability of the buffer material filling 
the 
space outside the overpacking prevents the movement of ground 
water. It also adsorbs radionuclides and slows down their 
movement while radioactivity decays. It also is expected to 
provide chemical buffering (alter and maintain the ground water 
in a state that will make nuclide dissolving more difficult) and 
physical buffering (modification of surrounding base rock), A 
promising candidate for the buffer material is a clay called 
bentonite, which has low water permeability, high swelling and 
high adsorption. 
  Radionuclides that move from the artificial barrier into the 
stratum are slowed down even more because the movement of the 
ground water is slow and because they are adsorbed into rock and 
minerals. Radioactivity decays to a substantial degree during 
this movement. The ground water also is expected to disperse and 
dilute the radionuclides. 
<H5>  3. Progression in R&amp;D </H5>
  The goal of R&amp;D on geologic disposal is to contribute 
to the 
establishment of geologic disposal technology by scientific and 
technical clarification of the effectiveness of the multiple 
barrier system, which combines artificial and natural barriers. 
PNC is leading the R&amp;D, with cooperation from the 
universities, 
R&amp;D institutions and the private sector, in three research 
areas 
(especially performance assessment research, but also including 
disposal technology R&amp;D and investigative research on 
conditions 
in the geological environment), in accordance with the JAEC's 
paper on ``priority items and progression of R&amp;D on HLW 
geologic 
disposal,'' which was unveiled on December 1989. 
  The unique feature of R&amp;D on geologic disposal is that 
its 
purpose is to grasp a variety of phenomena in the deep 
underground region, including long-term chemical reactions and 
hydrographic movement of substances, and to prove that safe 
geologic disposal can be ensured into the distant future, not by 
verification through direct experience, but by estimated 
measurements taken by scientific means. 
  For this reason, performance assessment research is 
emphasized in R&amp;D on geologic disposal. Under this research 
category, the chemical and physical rules that control the 
various phenomena are found and used as a basis for developing 
an analytical model; and the validity of the model is confirmed, 
then data with high reliability is collected to clarify 
theoretically and scientifically the mechanism for ensuring 
long-term safety of the multiple barrier system. 
  Under technical development [as in text; should be research 
and development] of disposal technology, engineering studies 
concerning design and execution of the artificial barrier and 
disposal facility are being carried out in response to progress 
in the performance assessment research with the goal of 
revealing specific technological methods to ensure the 
performance required of the artificial barrier and the disposal 
facility. 
  Under investigative research on conditions in the geological 
environment, investigative research is underway to provide the 
understanding of the conditions in Japan's geological 
environment that is needed for the performance assessment; to 
confirm the applicability of methods and equipment to 
investigation of the geological environment; and to clarify the 
methods for appropriate assessment of the region. 
  The coverage of this R&amp;D is divided broadly into 
crystalline 
rock and sedimentary rock R&amp;D because they are 
representative of 
Japan's varied geological environment and because the geological 
environment for geologic disposal has not been specified at 
present. 
  Development of scientific methods to make future predictions 
and other long-term research issues are included in R&amp;D on 
geologic disposal. Thus the R&amp;D is expected to take more 
than a 
decade, and its advancement will be characterized by periodic 
compilation of results and active provision of information. 
These results will be evaluated at the national level to gain 
broad approval of geologic disposal from all sectors. 
  As part of this, in September 1992, PNC compiled the first 
set of research results, which were achieved up to FY91, and 
published them as the ``FY91 technical report on geologic 
disposal'' (see Reference). This was reported to the national 
level (JAEC) as well. In response, in July 1993, JAEC judged 
that geologic disposal R&amp;D was adequate on the whole and was 
proceeding appropriately and steadily; and listed future R&amp;D 
topics. 
  This first compilation was characterized by the revelation 
of 
the various types of knowledge about functions of the multiple 
barrier system and a statement of the prospects for technical 
effectiveness of geologic disposal. In particular, it was 
revealed that substantial retardation of the movement of 
nuclides can be expected by the near field (artificial barrier 
and its surrounding rock base). On this basis, it was decided 
that the emphasis of research would be on the ``near field,'' 
and the plan is to quantify the artificial barrier in order to 
get a quantitative grasp of the near field, and carry out the 
second compilation before the year 2000. Based on the results of 
that stage of R&amp;D, the functions to be expected from the far 
field (natural barrier) will be defined, and a quantitative 
grasp of the natural barrier's functions will be sought. These 
are the steps set out for achieving an evaluation of the overall 
performance of the multiple barrier system.

<H5>  1. Confidence that Near Field Is Adequate </H5>
  In a document entitled ``state of progress on HLW geologic 
disposal R&amp;D,'' which was issued in July 1993, JAEC judged 
that 
R&amp;D had proceeded appropriately and steadily and was 
adequate at 
this stage, and listed the following as future topics for 
geologic disposal R&amp;D: 
<H5>  (1) Investigative Research on Geological Environment </H5>
Conditions 
  a. From the viewpoint of geologic disposal, give further 
emphasis to geological environment conditions which are 
important in ensuring long-term safety; and provide more highly 
reliable data concerning the deep underground region and improve 
and develop investigative technology and equipment to accomplish 
this. 
  b. Further investigate and evaluate the effects of natural 
phenomena on the multiple barrier system. c. Develop 
evaluation methods and technology for region-specific natural 
phenomena. d. Study the effects on the geological 
environment of large-scale human activities. 
<H5>  (2) Disposal Technology R&amp;D </H5>
  a. Put emphasis on developing a more reliable artificial 
barrier.b. Study new materials for overpacking and 
buffer.c. Carry out large-scale testing of execution 
methods.d. Improve technologies for comprehensive analysis, 
investigation and execution of design, construction and 
operation of the disposal site.e. Conduct tests based on 
hypothesized situations that are even greater threats to safety 
and study long-term safety of mine passageways and other 
cavities. 
<H5>  (3) Performance Evaluation Research </H5>
  a. Improve near field performance evaluation and multiple 
barrier system reliability.b. Improve and develop analytical 
models and methods and confirm their adequacy; and ensure 
reliability of data.c. Expand the database.d. Carry out 
natural analog research. 
<H5>  (4) Common Research Topics and Future Procedures </H5>
  a. To achieve more reliable research results, enhance 
research facilities and equipment and train personnel.b. The 
deep strata research facility is an important and useful 
facility that will serve as a common research base.c. Conduct 
an evaluative study of research policies through the national 
assessment of PNC's second compilation of research results.d. 
Activate relevant private sector technological capability and 
cooperation from various institutions and universities.e. 
Efficiently promote international cooperation. 
  Future R&amp;D will develop in accordance with the above 
listed 
topics and philosophy set forth by JAEC. 
  PNC plans to issue the second compilation before the year 
2000. It is to cover crystalline rock and sedimentary rock 
without specifying regions or rock varieties, with the goal of 
quantifying near field functions (including quantification of 
the artificial barrier) and a summary evaluation of far field 
functions. 
  This is because, as stated in an earlier section, it is 
clearly important that substantial prevention of movement of 
nuclides can be expected in the natural barrier that surrounds 
and is a short distance (several tens of meters) from the 
artificial barrier. 
  Functions of the near field can be clarified further through 
the results of laboratory tests and on-site tests. The next 
section summarizes the tests that will be carried out as part of 
this. 
<H5>  2. Research Provides Scientific Verification </H5>
  A new research facility for further advancement of geologic 
disposal R&amp;D has been built at PNC's Tokai Works. This is the 
``geologic disposal basic research facility,'' an above-ground 
facility where research will be conducted on the technological 
base of geologic disposal, which includes consolidation of the 
results achieved through PNC's geologic disposal R&amp;D. 
  The following is a summary of the research plan. 
<H5>  (1) Research Facility Goals and Features </H5>
  The goal of research at this facility is to focus on the 
ground water influencing process, one of the variety of 
hypothetical influencing processes in geologic disposal, and to 
analyze and evaluate the behavior of the multiple barrier system 
vis-a-vis ground water. (Photograph 3 [omitted] shows the 
building exterior.) 
  The facility's features are as follows:a. It is a cold 
facility that does not use radioactive substances.b. It has 
atmosphere control equipment.c. Tests ranging from basic 
tests to large-scale tests can be conducted.d. Various types 
of phenomena can be simulated. 
<H5>  (2) Research Facility Outline </H5>
  The facility is composed of a research building with four 
floors above ground and a test building with one floor above 
ground. The research building is equipped with analytical 
research equipment for computer simulations, etc., and equipment 
for quantitative analyses. The equipment in the test building 
can be divided into two main categories. The first can be called 
equipment to test changes in the near field chemical 
environment. It is composed of two testing devices that collect 
data on chemical action in the ground water and artificial 
barrier under conditions in the deep underground environment. 
The other can be called equipment to test near field composite 
phenomena. It is composed of four testing devices that are used 
to conduct research on ground water flow under conditions in the 
deep underground environment and research on composite phenomena 
of simultaneous action of ground pressure and heat from the 
waste. (Photograph 4 [omitted] and Table 9 are summaries of the 
test equipment.)

<H5>  3. Accumulation of Deep Strata Data </H5>
  PNC is conducting a variety of tests, using existing 
cavities, to accumulate data on deep strata. The following are 
the primary goals:a. Acquire data concerning the geological 
characteristics of the deep underground region.b. Gain 
understanding of deep underground region phenomena and establish 
methods for creating models for these phenomena.c. Improve 
and establish survey testing technology (survey testing methods, 
survey measuring equipment, etc.). 
  At this point, we will introduce the content of the strata 
scientific research being conducted by PNC at a mine in Kamaishi 
and the Chubu Works. 
<H5>  3.1 On-Site Testing at Kamaishi Mine </H5>
  On-site testing at the mine in Kamaishi is being conducted 
on 
the Kurihashi granodiorite fissured base rock, mainly using a 
250 m level passageway (600 m below ground level), to gain an 
understanding of geological features and depth dependency of 
phenomena, to get a detailed grasp of the characteristics and 
mechanism of formation of the so-called slack zone around the 
passageway, and to confirm the appropriateness of existing 
survey technology. With the above as the focus, the research is 
being carried out on the five items described below. 
<H5>  (1) Understanding Dynamic, Hydraulic, Geochemical Features </H5>
and Geological Structure of Base Rock in Deep Region 
  Gain an understanding of deep region geological features in 
crystalline rock and acquire the following basic information 
concerning the conditions of the test site that are required in 
order to analyze the results from carrying out (2) through (5) 
below: 
  (a) geological structure surrounding the on-site testing 
location (Photograph 5 [omitted]); 
  (b) by-depth dynamic characteristics of deep region base 
rock; 
  (c) by-depth hydraulic characteristics and geochemical 
characteristics of deep region base rock, and changes in these 
characteristics over time. 
<H5>  (2) Evaluation of Region Affected by Excavation in Deep </H5>
Region Base Rock 
  Create a model of the excavation effect mechanism and gain 
an 
understanding of the three-dimensional distribution of the 
region affected by boring a new passageway and measuring and 
assessing its effect (slack zone) on the base rock. 
<H5>  (3) Research Concerning Hydraulic/Substance Movement in </H5>
Single Fracture in Crystalline Rock 
  Proceed with research on the following items to understand 
the retardation of substance movement in a single fracture, the 
basic unit of the movement path. This is the first thing that 
needs to be understood to evaluate substance movement in 
crystalline rock. 

  -  Establish geological and geochemical investigative methods 
to understand substance movement in fractures. 
  -  Understand substance movement retardation in fractures 
through 
laboratory and on-site testing. 
  -  Confirm adequacy of existing models as regards substance 
movement in fractures. 

  To evaluate substance movement by ground water in 
crystalline 
rock, it is also important to understand substance movement 
characteristics that prescribe dispersion and transport by 
water, such as fissure structure and porosity of the fissured 
medium. Conducting hydraulic tests and non-adsorptiveness tracer 
tests on a rock formation of a fixed scale at the Kamaishi 
on-site test location will provide an understanding of substance 
movement characteristics, such as fissure structure and porosity 
of the fissured medium, of the site of the substance movement by 
ground water. 
<H5>  (4) Artificial Barrier Testing </H5>
  a. Testing of application of grouting technology on the 
fracture zone: 
  To contribute to the assessment of stability and 
waterproofing effect of clay-based grout, clarify the long-term 
stability of grout and the relationship between width and other 
characteristics of fissure shape and processing conditions 
(injection pressure, viscosity) on the one hand and grout 
stability, waterproofing effect and depth of grout immersion on 
the other. 
  b. Testing of clay filling in base rock: 
  Gain knowledge on the following items to contribute to 
understanding bentonite swelling, change in water content and 
heterogeneity due to penetration by ground water through 
fractures in the on-site base rock: 

  -  Heat conductivity of clay and base rock. 
  -  Effect of pressure from clay swelling on surrounding base 
rock. 

<H5>  (5) Earthquake Testing and Research </H5>
  Observe earthquake motion in the Kamaishi mine to accumulate 
knowledge concerning diminution of earthquake motion 
underground, and along with this, develop methods to create a 
model to simulate earthquake motion. Through model analysis, 
predict the behavior of underground cavities during earthquakes 
and assess their aseismatic capacity. Monitor hydraulic 
characteristics and changes in water quality during earthquakes 
and apply this to prediction of changes in hydraulic conditions 
and geochemical environment. The four items below are the 
specific goals: 
  a. Generalize and create formulas for rate of diminution 
underground of earthquake motionb. Build optimum model that 
simulates earthquake motion in deep underground regionsc. 
Confirm through simulation the stability of underground cavities 
during earthquakesd. Confirm whether earthquakes cause 
changes in underground water pressure, quality or amount of 
gushing, and study the change mechanisms. 
<H5>  3.2 Chubu Works </H5>
  Investigative testing and research at the Chubu Works is 
being conducted in the Tono uranium mine and the surrounding 
region. This region is composed of sedimentary rock covering 
granite rock. Research on the four items given below will be 
conducted in two phases (first phase: through FY96; second 
phase: FY97-2003). 
<H5>  (1) Base Rock Dynamic, Heat Characteristics Research </H5>
  The goal of this research is to study heterogeneous 
sedimentary base rock and grasp the dynamic characteristics of 
this base rock between the surface and the deep regions, and to 
establish methods to quantify and evaluate the effects of 
excavation and long-term reaction to it. 
  The first phase will consist of the following: 
  (a) Using a survey passageway in the Tono mine, study 
mechanical and smooth blasting excavation methods and the 
difference in their effects. 
  (b) In the survey passageway, conduct tests on the effects 
of 
excavation, consisting of excavating a passage that intersects a 
fault, and study the effects of a large-scale, non-continuous 
surface. 
  (c) Develop survey methods that can quantify the physical 
properties of base rock within a slack zone. 
  (d) Observe long-term displacement in base rock and acquire 
data necessary to grasp long-term base rock behavior. 
  (e) Study the applicability of existing analytical methods. 
  The second phase will consist of the following: 
  (a) Based on the measurements acquired in the first phase, 
conduct base rock behavior analysis and create a model; and 
modify and improve analytical methods. 
  (b) Validate these modeling and analytical methods by 
application to different base rock conditions. 
  (c) Based on long-term observation data accumulated in the 
first phase, modify models for long-term behavior prediction. 
<H5>  (2) Research on Flow of Ground Water in Deep Underground </H5>
Region 
  The goal of this research is to develop rational 
investigative technologies and evaluation methods to apply to 
the hydraulic environment between the surface and the deep 
underground region of a given location. 
  In the area surrounding the Tono mine, the following will be 
carried out: 
  (a) Conduct hydraulic surveys in surface strata, mid-strata 
(sedimentary rock) and deep strata (granite bedrock); and ground 
water flow analysis based on the results of these surveys. 
  (b) Verify ground water flow model for this region. 
  (c) Develop ground water survey equipment usable at a depth 
of 1,000 meters, which is needed to investigate the 
characteristics of deep region ground water (Photograph 6 
[omitted]). 
  (d) Optimize the hydraulic survey and analysis system and 
define the scope of evaluation. 
  (e) Establish technology for rational investigation of 
hydraulic characteristics between the ground surface and deep 
regions, over a broad area. 
<H5>  (3) Research on Geochemical Characteristics of Ground Water </H5>
in Deep Region 
  The goal of this research is to grasp the geochemical 
characteristics of ground water in the deep region and water 
formation mechanisms, and to establish geochemical models for 
prediction and evaluation of future changes. 
  In the first phase, a 8km x 7km area will be used to (a) 
grasp the geochemical characteristics of ground water and 
analyze its formation mechanism; and (b) develop investigative 
technologies and equipment for geochemical model building and 
establish evaluation methods. 
<H5>  (4) Research on Substance Movement and Settlement in </H5>
Geological Environment 
  The goal of this research is to grasp the mechanisms of 
substance movement and settlement in the geological environment, 
establish substance movement models for grasping future changes, 
and establish technologies for rational investigation of 
substance movement and settlement in the geological environment. 
  In the first phase, laboratory and on-site testing will be 
used to grasp the characteristics of the microscopic (mineral 
scale to outcrop scale) geological medium (path of movement) 
that regulate substance movement and the mechanism and process 
of substance settlement. 
  Investigation of geological medium characteristics (movement 
path) will include (a) extraction of composition and structure 
of rock that could be the movement path in sedimentary rock; (b) 
building of conceptual model for movement path in the 
microscopic scale; and (c) grasping of matrix diffusion and 
other mechanisms of movement and settlement, or settlement 
alone. To accomplish this, substance movement testing under 
atmospheric control will be conducted to (a) grasp the behavior 
of substances at the border between solid and liquid, (b) reveal 
substance sorption and settlement mechanisms, and (c) carry out 
sorption/desorption tests using natural rack and ground water. 
  Based on results from these tests, (a) a model of the 
structure of the movement path and a model of chemical reactions 
on the path will be built and (b) to validate these models, the 
distribution of uranium and uranium series nuclides in the 
geological environment will be inspected and analyzed. 
  In the second phase, the following will be carried out: (a) 
Comprehensive evaluation of the mechanisms of substance movement 
and settlement in the macroscopic (ore deposit scale) geological 
environment; and (b) provision and analysis of historical data 
(concerning geographical and hydraulic changes in the past) and 
ore deposit science data in order to verify macroscopic 
substance movement and settlement mechanisms. 
<H5>  4. International Cooperation </H5>
  Various forms of research have been conducted in other 
countries concerning the effectiveness of the multiple barrier 
system in geologic disposal, and they include some in which 
Japan has participated as joint international undertakings. 
  International cooperation is important for (a) sharing of 
the 
principle of safety, (b) improving the reliability of technology 
and evaluation methods, and (c) efficient use of facilities and 
increasing of data. 
  Here we will present a summary of the contents of 
international co-research concerning HLW geologic disposal and 
underground strata science and technology, which PNC is carrying 
out at present. 
<H5>  (1) United States </H5>
  From 1993 to 1996, under a technical cooperation agreement 
with the Department of Energy (DOE), PNC and the Lawrence 
Berkeley Laboratory (LBL) are developing a model for substance 
movement in heterogeneous media that takes into consideration 
effect of scale and fault structure, with the goal of a 
composite revelation of radionuclide movement in underground 
strata. 
<H5>  (2) Canada </H5>
  Since 1986, at the Whiteshell [phonetic spelling] 
underground 
research facility of Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL), PNC 
has been conducting on-site tracer tests using multiple sample 
gimlet holes, with the goal of developing and establishing 
methods for investigation and analysis of hydraulic and nuclide 
movement characteristics covering the shatter zone in 
crystalline rock. 
<H5>  (3) Switzerland </H5>
  Since 1989, joint on-site testing is being carried out at 
the 
Grimzel [phonetic spelling] base rock research center of the 
radioactive waste disposal national cooperative (NAGRA) with the 
goal of revealing the hydraulics of ground water in a single 
fissure in crystalline rock, and developing methods for 
evaluation of radionuclide movement and developing a nuclide 
movement model. The results of this research will be reflected 
in verification of the Japanese model and on-site testing of 
crystalline rock in Japan. 
  Also, in view of the geologic disposal concept shared by 
Japan and Switzerland, the two countries are exchanging 
information and are evaluating each other's research. 
<H5>  (4) Sweden </H5>
  From 1991 to 1994, PNC is participating in a project at the 
underground research facility (HRL) of Sweden's nuclear fuel 
waste control company (SKB), and has carried out a variety of 
on-site testing of crystalline rock. The goal of the project is 
to develop technology to grasp with precision the geologic 
environment of the deep underground region, which will be the 
geologic disposal site, and develop methods to predict changes 
to the geological environment caused by excavation. 
  Along with construction of the underground research 
facility, 
whose main feature is a slanting shaft extending from the 
surface to 500 meters underground, the on-site testing will be 
carried out in stages in each area --geological, ground water 
hydraulic and ground water geochemical tests -- with the goal of 
developing and establishing methods to grasp (predict) the 
geological environment through a repetition of the process of: 
Prediction -assessment of predicted results - method 
modification. 
<H5>  (5) France </H5>
  Since 1991, PNC has been participating in information 
exchange and joint research, mainly on the theme of the 
geochemistry of radionuclides, at the Fontenay-au-Rose [phonetic 
spelling] research institute of the Atomic Energy Agency of 
France (CEA). 
<H5>  (6) Great Britain </H5>
  Since 1993, PNC has been conducting joint research with AEA 
Technology (AEA), focusing on development and modification of a 
database on thermodynamics and acquisition of data concerning 
adsorption mechanisms at the Harwell [phonetic spelling] 
Research Institute, and information exchange. 
<H5>  (7) OECD/NEA and Other Joint International Projects </H5>
  Thus far, PNC has participated in a project at Sweden's 
Stripa [phonetic spelling] mine with the goal of developing 
geological environment evaluation technology and methods, 
verifying the applicability of ground water flowpath hermetic 
sealing technology and other disposal technologies, and 
conducting comparative studies of ground water flow assessment 
models; and in the alligator river analog project, which was 
implemented in Australia's Kungalaulan [phonetic spelling] ore 
deposit with the goal of elucidating the mechanisms of nuclide 
behavior in a geological environment. PNC also is participating 
in INTRAVAL, with the goal of validating nuclide movement 
models, and in DECOVALEX (secretariat run by SKI of Sweden), 
with the goal of developing and validating a heat-water-stress 
compound model. 
  Hereafter, for the reasons given earlier, it will become 
increasingly important for Japan to take a leadership role in 
international cooperation projects.

  [Text] This paper describes superconductive small 
antennas composed of helical coil elements and quarter-wave 
matching circuits. We obtained a high efficiency of 70% by 
using a 5OO MHz band one-element antenna with _l_/40 element. 
We 
also realized a unidirectional radiation pattern and a higher 
radiation efficiency than an equivalent Cu antenna by using a 
900 MHz band two-element superdirective antenna with a _l_/20 
element and a _l_/11 element spacing. We confirm that the use 
of 
superconductors and the present design principle are very 
effective for realizing of highly efficient small antennas. 
<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  Highly efficient small antennas are required for use as 
environmental monitors, which can detect long wavelength radio 
waves sensitively. However, the radiation resistance is very low 
in electrically small antennas, which have elements whose length 
is shorter than their wavelength. The radiation resistance of 
superdirective allay antennas, which have element spacings 
shorter than their wavelength, are also very low. Consequently, 
the loss resistance is relatively high and the radiation 
efficiency is very low when these small antennas are made of 
normal conductors. However, if a superconductor is used to 
fabricate small antennas, high efficiency can be maintained. 
Therefore, small antennas made of metal superconductors, such as 
lead, have been studied.[.sup]1,2[/] Although these antennas 
exhibited a lower antenna loss than equivalent antennas made of 
normal conductors, it was difficult to achieve a high absolute 
gain because they required the use of a cooling system with 
metal insulators, and this caused a decrease in antenna gain. 
  Since the discovery of high temperature superconductors 
(HTS), such as YBaCuO (YBCO) and BiSrCaCuO (BSCCO), many 
superconductive small antennas have been 
developed[.sup]3-5[/] because they only require simple 
cooling systems. This paper proposes small antennas made with 
HTS, which are composed of helical elements and quarter-wave 
matching circuits and a feed network.[.sup]6-9[/] The 
properties of these antennas are also described. 
<H5>  Antenna Structure </H5>
  Figure 1 (a) and (b) show the equivalent circuits of a 
one-element (a) and a two-element (b) antenna. 
I[.sub]n[/][.sup]e[/] (= 
_x_[.sub]n[/]I[.sub]0[/]exp(j¯[.sub]n[/]) where 
_x_[.sub]n[/], I[.sub]0[/], ¯[.sub]n[/] are real 
numbers) and R[.sub]n[/][.sup]in[/], are, respectively, 
the excitation currents and input resistance of the n-th element 
(n = 1, 2) which is self- resonating at a designed frequency. 
Z[.sub]cn[/][.sup]d[/], _a_[.sub]n[/][.sup]d[/] and 
L[.sub]n[/][.sup]d[/] are the characteristic impedance, 
attenuation constant and length of the matching circuit, 
respectively. Z[.sub]cn[/][.sup]d[/], 
_a_[.sub]n[/][.sup]d[/] and L[.sub]n[/][.sup]d[/] 
are attenuation constant and length of delay lines, 
respectively. Z[.sub]c[/][.sup]f[/] is the characteristic 
impedance of a feed line. The antenna is composed of a feed 
network which is composed of a feed line and delay lines, 
matching circuits and helical elements. Since 
R[.sub]n[/][.sup]in[/] values are generally much lower 
than Z[.sub]c[/][.sup]f[/] values, it is essential to 
match these impedances. _l_/4 matching circuits are used in 
these antennas, because they are easily formed using brittle 
sintered HTS. Self-resonant helical coils are used for the 
radiators,[.sup]10[/] because only the resistance (real part 
of the impedance) can be matched with a _l_/4 matching circuit. 
In order to adjust each I[.sub]n[/][.sup]e[/] to its 
designed value, Z[.sub]cn[/][.sup]m[/] and 
L[.sub]n[/][.sup]m[/] are determined while 
L[.sub]n[/][.sup]m[/] fixed at a quarter of an effective 
wavelength on a parallel line. Figure 2 shows the antennas made 
of HTS materials. Antennas A and B are 500 MHz band one-element 
antennas with elements which are _l_/40 in length and antenna C 
is a 900 MHz-band two- element end-fire superdirective array 
antenna with _l_/20 length element and a _l_/11 element 
spacing. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-025L-52A>      Figure 1. Equivalent Circuits of Antennas </FIG>


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-025L-52B>      Figure 2. Photograph of Antennas </FIG>


<H5>  2. One-Element Small Antenna </H5>
<H5>  2.1 Design and Fabrication </H5>
  The helical elements of antennas A and B in Figure 2 were 
designed to resonate at 500 MHz by using the moment 
method.[.sup]11[/] The directive gain of the radiators was 
calculated at 0.5 dBi. Figure 3 shows the loss at a helical 
element (_z_) as a function of element length (L[.sup]e[/]). 
When the surface resistance (R[.sub]s[/]) is large, 
_z_[.sup]e[/] increases rapidly as L[.sup]e[/] decreases. 
The elements of antennas A and B were made of sintered BSCCO, 
whose surface resistance was about 0.5 m_O_ at 500 MHz at 77 
K.[.sup]12[/] The _z_[.sup]r[/] values are therefore 
calculated to be about 0.4 dB in these elements. The input 
resistance of the element is calculated to be 0.37 _O_. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-025L-53A>      Figure 3. Element Loss _z_[.sub]e[/], as a Function of </FIG>


  The matching circuit of antenna A was made of two Cu bars 
and 
a dielectric sheet (teflon) was placed between them. A parallel 
meander line made of EuBaCuO thin-films[.sup]13[/] was used 
for the matching circuit of antenna B in order to reduce the 
antenna size. The element and the matching circuit of both 
antennas were joined using silver paste. The loss of the Cu 
matching circuit of antenna A is not so high because the 
parallel line has a relatively large cross section.[.sup]7[/] 
By connecting the parallel line of the matching circuit to the 
microstripline of the feed network, the microstriplineworks as a 
balun (converter from balanced mode to unbalanced 
mode).[.sup]6[/] 
<H5>  2.2 Results and Discussion </H5>
  Figure 4 shows the actual gain of antenna A as a function of 
frequency. The gain of an equivalent Cu antenna is also shown in 
this figure for comparison. The actual gain of antenna A was 
-1.2 dBi at 80 K and 488 MHz and was 7.8 dB and 6.2 dB higher 
than the actual gain of the equivalent Cu antenna at room 
temperature (R.T.) and 77 K, respectively. This value 
corresponds to 70% of the radiation efficiency, and it is 
also 
very high compared with those of previously reported 
superconductive small antennas. The actual gain of antenna B was 
-4.5 dBi at 80 K and 469 MHz, and this value was 9.6 dB and 5.4 
dB higher than that of the equivalent Cu antenna at R.T. and 70 
K, respectively. This enabled us to confirm that these 
superconductive small antennas are more effective in realizing 
high-gain than a Cu small antenna. The relatively lower gain in 
antenna B is attributed to the loss at the joint between the 
helical element and the matching circuit. We believe that the 
gain will be improved by improving the joining method. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-025L-53B>      Figure 4. Actual Gain of the Antennas </FIG>


<H5>  3. Superdirective Array Antenna </H5>
<H5>  3.1 Design and Fabrication </H5>
  In a two-element array antenna, the excitation current for 
each element, which leads to results in maximum gain, should be 
determined by solving the following of differential equations; 
  partialG[.sub]d[/]/partial 
I[.sub]n[/][.sup]r[/] = 0 (n = 1,2) 
  where G[.sub]d[/] is the directive gain of an antenna. If 
we assume that the resonant frequency is 900 MHz and the element 
spacing (d[.sub]e[/]) is 30 mm, relations between excitation 
currents (I[.sub]1[/], I[.sub]2[/]) of _x_[.sub]1[/] = 
_x_[.sub]2[/] and ¯[.sub]2[/] - ¯[.sub]1[/] = 
165.6Î are obtained.[.sup]2[/] The self- and 
mutual-impedances (Z[.sub]mn[/] n, m = 1, 2) of the elements 
are calculated by the moment method. The input impedances 
Z[.sub]n[/][.sup]in[/] (= 
R[.sub]n[/][.sup]in[/]+jX[.sub]n[/][.sup]in[/]) of 
the elements are computed by using Z[.sub]nm[/] and 
I[.sub]m[/]. In this antenna, we can theoretically expect a 
directive gain of 6.2 dBi, which is 5.3 dB higher than that of a 
one element antenna, and a front- to-back ratio of 7.9 dB in the 
radiation pattern. 
  Figure 5 shows the loss at the element of a 900 MHz band 
two-element array antenna as a function of d[.sub]e[/]. When 
R[.sup]s[/] is large, _z_[.sup]e[/] increases rapidly as 
d[.sub]e[/] decreases. As with antennas A and B the elements 
of antenna C were made of BSCCO. Since the surface resistance of 
BSCCO at 900 MHz and 80 K is 2 m_O_,[.sup]12[/] the loss was 
calculated at about 2.5 dB. The input resistance of each 
element, R[.sub]1[/][.sup]in[/] and 
R[.sub]2[/][.sup]in[/], was calculated at 2.0 _O_ and 
-1.66 _O_, respectively. The negative value of 
R[.sub]2[/][.sup]in[/] indicates that the element draws 
radiated power from the other element which has a positive 
R[.sub]1[/][.sup]in[/]. This is due to the strong mutual 
coupling between two elements placed closely each 
other.[.sup]14[/] Therefore, in order to obtain a theoretical 
antennagain, the power received at the negative 
R[.sub]2[/][.sup]in[/] element must be fed back to the 
positive R[.sub]1[/][.sup]in[/] element through the feed 
network. In order to realize the above feedback mechanism, the 
feed network must fulfill the following conditions; 
  (1) The difference in line length from the elements to the 
branch point must be equal to the phase difference between the 
excitation currents (¯[.sub]2[/]-¯[.sub]1[/]). 
  (2) The total line length between positive- and negative- 
R[.sup]in[/] elements via the branch point must also 
correspond to ¯[.sub]2[/]-¯[.sub]1[/] +/-„.

  Consequently, L[.sub]n[/][.sup]d[/] is determined 
uniquely, and this is a particular feature of the superdirective 
array antenna.[.sup]9[/] The matching circuit of antenna C 
was made of sintered BSCCO, and the feed network was made using 
a conventional printed circuit board (_e_[.sub]r[/] = 10.2). 
The elements, the matching circuits and the feed network were 
joined together with silver paste. 
<H5>  3.2 Results and Discussion </H5>
  The actual gain of antenna C was -4.2 dBi at 910 MHz and 80 
K. Its gain was 5.4 dB and 4.0 dB higher than that of an 
equivalent Cu antenna at R.T. and 77 K, respectively. We 
therefore confirm that the superconductive small antenna 
exhibits a higher gain than a Cu antenna. Figure 6 shows the 
designed and measured radiation pattern of antenna C. Although 
unexpected radiations, which perhaps emanated from the feed 
system, were observed around _P_ = 205Î, a unidirectional 
radiation pattern and front-to-back ratio of 6.8 dB were 
confirmed for the antenna. The fact that the actual gain of 
antenna C was lower than the designed value seemed to result 
mainly from ohmic losses in the Cu lines and silver paste 
joints, and unwanted radiation. The gain should be improved by 
changing the feed network from normal conductors to 
superconductors.

<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  We proposed a design principle for superconductive small 
antennas with quarter-wavelength parallel line matching circuits 
and helical coil elements and/or a feed network. On the basis of 
this concept, we fabricated a 500 MHz-band one element antenna 
with a 0.025 _l_ radiator and 900 MHz band two-element end-fire 
superdirective array antenna with a 0.09 _l_ radiator spacing 
and 0.05 _l_ radiator length. These antennas exhibited a higher 
efficiency than an equivalent Cu antenna. We confirmed that the 
superconductor and the present antenna structures can be used to 
realize highly efficient small antennas.

  [Text] Olympus Optical Co., Ltd. and Professor Naomasa 
Nakajima of Faculty of Engineering at the University of Tokyo 
jointly developed a basic technology to fabricate freely three 
dimensional ceramic or metal micro parts. It was considered a 
difficult process. Desired three dimensional shapes are formed 
by first mixing ceramic or metal fine powders with photosenstive 
liquid polymers, irradiating laser beams for solidification, and 
then heating to evaporate the polymers. With wider selection of 
materials and structures, much more flexible designs and 
manufacturing can be available for micro machines, thus its 
R&amp;D 
is expected to make a big boost. 
  The new technology employs the `photoforming method.' 
Ceramic 
or metal powders are mixed as much as possible with ultraviolet 
sensitive liguid polymers. Then, optical beam is irradiated 
using the design measurement data of the parts intended for 
production. 
  The laser beam is irradiated through the glass window 
located 
at the bottom of the container to solidify the mixture in the 
small space between the substrate, which is immersed in the 
liquid, and the bottom of the container. When the 
solidification takes place as the substrate is being pulled up 
slowly, the desired three dimensional parts containing plastics 
are built. When heated at 300-500Î C, the plastic 
evaporates, leaving the metal or ceramics behind. Then it is 
sintered at high temperatures of above 1000Î C. 
  The research group conducted an experiment by mixing 2 kinds 
(averaging 0.25 microns and 3 microns in particle diameter) of 
oxide aluminum powders with ultraviolet sensitive polymer and 
irradiating helium/cadmium laser beams for solidification. At 
the time of mixing, ultrasonic vibration was applied for the 
liquid mixture for several hours, so that oxide aluminum will 
avoid coagulation and be evenly dispersed in the polymer. 
  As a result, they discovered that the smaller the particle 
sizes are and the more the amount of oxide aluminum is contained 
in the liquid mixture before irradiation, the higher the 
viscosity. Laser beam irradiation produced the parts with high 
precision-only a few microns discrepencies. 
  The research group will acquire the optimum processing 
condition based on the basic data collected through these 
experiments, so that they can evaporate polymers and start 
producing ceramic or metal micro parts for actual use. 
<H5>  Production of Micro Machine Parts Using Composite Materials </H5>
  [Commentary] The new technology is quite useful for the 
production of micro parts by improving conventional methods. 
However, there are still problems to be overcome before it 
proves to be practically useful. 
  Parts for micro machines were at first produced using 
silicon 
substrates, a part of the semiconductor processing technology. 
Gears and motors were produced instead of transistors, but 
those parts had to be flat. Later, the LIGA process using x-ray 
which has shorter wave length than ultraviolet for the light 
source was introduced, theyreby the depth of the structure of 
the parts was much improved. However, this method also was 
limitted to use light exposure for producing parts, therefore, 
it was difficult to build perfectly three dimensional structures. 
  The photoforming method is free of such limitation and able 
to produce combination of multiple parts all at once. R&amp;D on 
this method is at present actively under way. Due to the base 
material of plastics, it was considered impossible to make 
ceramic or metal parts which are superior in strength and 
resistance. 
  The new technology can use either plastic, metal, or 
ceramics 
and has an advantage of being able to use the photoforming 
method. Research on evaporation of polymers out of the 
solidified parts will continue, focusing on the heating 
condition and the parts design in order to accomplish high 
precision measurement. 
  Actually, evaporation of the polymers is not necessarily 
required. Polymer ceramic or polymer metal composite materials, 
which are much stronger than pure plastic parts, can be 
adequately useful.

  [Text] Plans for a joint R&amp;D project intended to promote 
the commercialization of photoforming equipment and photo 
sensitive polymers are under way. Photoforming system and 
polymer manufacturers will join with photoforming equipment 
users to conduct research designed to improve photoforming and 
to lower the cost of photoforming systems. The project is a part 
of the `R&amp;D Program for Basic Technology To Aid Knowledge 
Collection for Small To Medium Sized Enterprises' run by the 
Small to Medium Sized Enterprise Corporation. Official 
selection of participants is scheduled for June. Candidates from 
polymer manufacturers include Japan Synthetic Rubber Co., Ltd., 
Sanyo Chemical Industries, Ltd., Nippon Kayaku Co., Ltd., 
DuPont, and Ciba-Geigy. 
  Photoforming equipment is designed to build thin plastic 
parts from photosensitive liquid polymers using CAD data derived 
from three-dimensional models. Horizontal layers of the parts 
are formed one on top of another while solidification through 
laser irradiation takes place to finally form three-dimensional 
objects. Photoforming equipment has the advantage of not 
requiring dies to make three-dimensional objects. However, 
because of the high cost of equipment and poor strength and 
precision of polymers, the applications are limited at present 
to industrial design models. The equipment currently costs about 
500 million yen. Only 2-3 units have been sold in Japan in FY93. 
  The project, which is supposed to take off soon, will 
include 
research and development intended to lower the cost of 
photoforming equipment and to improve the performance of 
polymers. Developers will try to reduce costs to about 200 
million yen per unit including the cost of lasers, an important 
component of theequipment, and software that slices the CAD data 
just like CT scanning. 
  On the other hand, R&amp;D on photosensitive ploymers will 
include better understanding of photosetting mechanism theory 
and high performance polymers with high shock resistance and 
high prescision. Development of high performance polymers is 
the key to wide marketability and general purpose photoforming 
equipment. 
  Candidates for participation in the project other than 
polymer makers include NEC Corporation. Toshiba Corporation, and 
Ushio Inc. for development of lasers, Teijin Seiki Co., Ltd. and 
Sony for scanner development, and Seamet [phonetic] and Deemec 
[phonetic] for photoforming equipment. Among equipement users, 
small to medium sized plastic works companies intend soon to 
form a consortium before joining the project. 
  The project is scheduled to last four years. The Small to 
Medium Sized Enterprise Corporation has allocated it &yen;180 
million under the FY94 budget.

  [Text] Denken Engineering has marketed a compact desktop 
photoforming system, the ``Desk Modeler,'' (trade name) which 
can create three-dimensional models of three-dimensional shapes 
simply on an Apple Macintosh computer. The software was 
developed by Systems Nakashima in collaboration withthe CRC 
Research Institute. It is a ``three-dimensional copier 
machine'', according to Hironao Kubo of Systems Nakashima, 
because the low cost, compact system can produce plastic models 
from three-dimansional shapes created on the monitor. 
  The system now is able to produce an actual model from 
shapes 
created on the Macintosh. Traditionally, only two-dimensional 
forms could be produced through the use of CAD (computeraided 
design). 
  The shapes can be easily created using free-form surface 
modeling software, ``MACSURF.'' Shapes designed by ``MACSURF'' 
can be produced directly through the photoforming control 
software, ``Model Bridge.'' Model Bridge was developed 
especially for this system, and designed for transfer to the 
``SLP-4000'' compact photoforming system which produces plastic 
three-dimensional models. 
  The SLP-4000 was developed by Denken Engineering as a 
``desktop size forming machine,'' according to the New Operation 
Promotion Office Manager Shoji Hiura of Denken Engineering. 
600mm[.sup]3[/], the machine is capable of forming objects 
200mmxl50mmxl50mm in size. It costs &yen;4.98 million. 
  The entire system costs a total of &yen;7.68 million, 
including the SLP-4000 (4.98 million yen), the software 
MACSURF'(&yen;1 million), and the software that controls 
forming (&yen;1.7 million). The cost of this system is below 
1/10 that of a large conventional industrial photoforming system.

  [Text] New diamond is being considered as the ultimate 
material for application in the field of electronics. Plans to 
develop new diamond materials and eventually to establish its 
application technology are moving along steadily. Both industry 
and academic groups have active R&amp;D programs both on 
substances 
already available, such as diamonds and DLC (diamond-like 
carbons), and on new substances such as nanotubes and 
fullerenes. They have even tried to operate transistors and 
fabricate several passive devices using those materials. But all 
of this is still in the initial stages of development. 
Therefore, a national-scale project is being promoted for a 
wide area of new diamond R&amp;D that will cover areas from basic 
research to application in electronics and optics. 
  Diamonds have high heat resistance. a high energy gap, high 
strength, as well as desirable optical and magnetic properties. 
In recent years, diamonds are being vigorously applied not only 
in wear-resistant products because of its extreme hardness. but 
also in electronics and optics. 
  Under these circumstances, the `New Diamond Forum,' a new 
diamond R&amp;D group, in December 1993 established the `New 
Diamond 
Technology Research Group' to study potential diamond 
applications for power electronics and disaster prevention 
systems. 
  Abroad, meanwhile, the U.S, Department of Defense is funding 
studies of silicon carbide device application and research on 
diamond electronic devices, packaging and optical components. 
The European Community is also focusing research on new diamond 
development. 
  Progress in new diamond development abroad has stimulated 
Japanese industry to demand promotion of a national project in 
Japan. 
  Specifically, the project calls for application of diamonds 
in ultimate performance electronics materials through 
development of fabrication technology for new substances and new 
materials, property control, and development of evaluation 
technology. 
  Possible applications include various environmentally 
durable 
electronic components, oil drilling tools, and new functional 
catalysts. They also will contribute to the safety of the 
global environment and provide solutions to energy problems.

<F P=106> [Article by Shuzo Kanzaki, GIRI, Nagoya, and Hideaki </F>
Matsubara, Japan Fine Ceramics Center] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  Attempts to use ceramics as high-temperature structural 
materials were accelerated by the oil crises of the 1970s. 
Government projects in the United States and West Germany began 
one after the other with the goal of developing a ceramic gas 
turbine engine. In Japan as well, the Fine Ceramics Project was 
initiated in 1981 under the system of R&amp;D Projects of Basic 
Technologies for Future Industries in order to establish R&amp;D 
technology for the manufacture and processing, evaluation, 
design, and use of silicon nitride and silicon carbide ceramics. 
Although projects overseas placed their emphasis on the 
development of systems, the major feature of the project in 
Japan was that its chief objective was material development. We 
clearly remember that this not only had a major impact on 
foreign R&amp;D thereafter, but it was also the impetus behind 
the 
development of ceramic fibers in Japan. In March 1993, after 12 
years, R&amp;D on the Fine Ceramics Project drew to a close. 
During 
the course of this project steady advances were made in 
technical development of ceramics for structural use. Material 
properties were dramatically improved through advances in the 
development of highly pure raw material powders, forming and 
sintering technology, and technology for controlling the 
microstructure of sintered bodies. For example, silicon nitride 
material was realized with a compressive strength surpassing 1 
GPa or fracture toughness surpassing 10 MPa m[.sup]1/2[/]. 
Moreover, Weibull strength coefficients greater than 20 have 
become commonplace. 
  Recently, however, it has become clear that we are facing 
energy and environmental problems on a global scale, and when we 
look at prospects for technological development in the 21st 
Century, the most important challenge we will face is the 
transition from the environmentally destructive technologies of 
the past and their consumption of mass quantities of natural 
resources to sophisticated, energy-saving, clean technologies of 
the future that will enable the conservation and effective 
utilization of natural resources. The materials used in these 
new systems must be especially safe and reliable, both in terms 
of thermal and mechanical properties and in terms of 
functionality, under much harsher environments than in the past. 
We believe previous methods of developing ceramics, which mostly 
set out to enhance a single function, are severely limited if we 
are to satisfy these high-level demands on materials in terms of 
mechanical and other functions. 
  Several years ago, after considerable discussion Japan's 
universities, national research institutes and ceramics-related 
companies decided to pursue a new concept in materials 
development that would enable researchers to create multiple 
functions in the same material. Thus, preliminary research on 
``Hierarchical Structure Controlled Fused Inorganic Materials'' 
was initiated under the system of R&amp;D Projects of Basic 
Technologies for Future Industries to study the potential for 
creating future projects through experimental verification of 
this new concept of Hierarchical Structure Control. In this 
article we will introduce this concept and details of research, 
as well as discuss the direction of research projects in the 
future. 
<H5>  2. Structure Control of Ceramics </H5>
  2.1 Classification of Structure 
  We can say that all materials, not just ceramics, have 
something in common: their unique functions (properties) are 
intimately related to their structures (organization). 
Therefore, we can say that the true course of materials 
development research is to express stable functions and new 
functions as well by meticulously controlling the structure of 
the material. Therefore, we will begin our discussion with the 
question of how to look at the structure of ceramics. 
  Generally when we think about the structure of inorganic 
materials like ceramics, we consider electron orbitals, chemical 
bonds, crystal structure, lattice defects, particle boundaries, 
dispersed particles, porosity, fibers, crystal grains, layers, 
and so on. These are referred to as structural elements. To 
actually describe material structure, it is necessary to talk 
about the state of these structural elements. However, the 
methods of expression are quite varied, depending on the 
structural elements themselves and on the researchers, so 
definitive descriptions are not easily obtained. Therefore, one 
method we can employ for clarity is to classify the structural 
elements using a kind of measuring scale; in other words, to 
arrange the structural elements in a hierarchy. 
  Figure 1 shows one way of classifying structures in ceramics 
and their control methods. As ways of classifying the structural 
elements (arranging them in a hierarchy) we have chosen size, 
shape, distribution, arrangement, and orientation. We believe 
the easiest measure to understand in this hierarchical 
arrangement of material structure is size. However, when it 
comes to the problem of ``controlling ceramics structure,'' 
elements of electron theory such as electron orbitals and 
chemical bonds do not come into play. Therefore, when we look at 
ceramics structure in terms of control and what is controllable, 
we are dealing with the atomic/molecular level or larger. As a 
result, we decided to classify size into four levels or 
hierarchies--(1) ultra-ultra-micro, (2) ultra-micro, (3) micro, 
and (4) macro--to clarify structure. In this diagram we have 
expressed schematically which levels the various structural 
elements belong to. We have also placed the various structure 
control methods on the levels at which they are mainly 
performed, and we have indicated with arrows where the other 
measures such as shape and distribution must be taken into 
account in the size hierarchy. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-025L-05A>      Figure 1. Classification of Ceramics Structure and Control </FIG>


  2.2 Structure Control in the Past 
  Let us look at previous types of ceramics from the 
standpoint 
of structure control. First, in the case of single unit 
(monolithic) ceramics for structural use, we have been able to 
create sophisticated materials with quite uniform crystal grain 
microstructures at the micro level by experimenting with 
sintering conditions and minute amounts of additives. Moreover, 
research has been conducted recently on composite ceramics using 
dispersed particles, whiskers and long fibers, and we are 
discovering that these are promising materials in terms of 
strength and toughness. In the case of functional ceramics, 
structural control such as expression of functions inherent in 
the characteristic crystal and electron structures of materials, 
and control of grain boundary structure is being performed on a 
lower hierarchical level than with structural materials. 
Regardless of whether they are structural or functional, 
however, we can say that with previous types of ceramics we have 
mainly controlled structure on a single level. 
  The outstanding feature of structure control on a single 
level is that a specific function can be expressed to the 
greatest extent possible. Structure control on a single level is 
limited, however, because it is extremely difficult to express 
multiple functions simultaneously. Materials that can withstand 
use in harsh environments must be heat resistant, corrosion 
resistant, and strong, as well as reliable and durable. 
Furthermore, these properties must all be in balance (harmony). 
It is extremely difficult to obtain both balance and high-level 
properties with structure control at a single level, so to 
overcome this we must perform structure control across multiple 
levels simultaneously. 
<H5>  3. Hierarchical Structure Control </H5>
  3.1 Concept 
  If we attempt to describe hierarchical structure control as 
simply as possible, we can say that it is ``controlling the 
structures (structural elements) at two or more levels in the 
same material.'' 
  Figure 2 shows an example of hierarchical structure control. 
Here, if we describe the desired structure control beginning 
with the level of greatest size, the material's interior is 
reinforced by short fibers (orientation is also controlled) and 
long fibers, and a structure control layer is formed on the 
surface of the material (micro-/macro-level). In addition, 
particles are dispersed at the matrix grain boundaries and 
within the grains (ultra-ultra-micro level), and distribution 
control on the atomic level (ultra-ultra-micro level) is carried 
out in the matrix. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-025L-06A>      Figure 2. Model of Hierarchical Structure Control </FIG>


  We will explain functions that are expressed by hierarchical 
structure control using the schematic drawing in Figure 3. If we 
look at strength and toughness as examples, because structural 
uniformity is required to increase strength, and structural 
non-uniformity is required to increase toughness, it has been 
very difficult to obtain both of these properties using the 
single level structure control of the past. Recently, however, a 
control technique called nanocomposite has been created in which 
nanoparticles are dispersed inside microparticles as in (b). 
Related research has begun on techniques to control crystal 
grain orientation as in (a). As a result, the possibility has 
emerged for a material like (d) that is both strong and tough 
through hierarchical structure control that is performed by 
employing these two control techniques simultaneously. In 
addition, it will also be possible to realize mechanical and 
other properties at the same time. For example, we can express 
magnetic properties as in (c) by structure control on the 
ultra-ultra-micro level. With past methods in which magnetic 
particles were dispersed that were the same size or larger than 
the matrix particles, strength dropped considerably (due to 
increase in defect size). However, if we use the control 
technique of nanoparticle dispersion as in (b), we can expect a 
very strong, magnetic material with a structure like (e). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-025L-06B>      Figure 3 Schematic Diagram of Hierarchical Structure </FIG>


  3.2 Examples of Hierarchical Structure Control 
Research 
  Recently, there have been several examples of research 
conducted both in Japan and overseas that could be called the 
beginnings of hierarchical structure control. Here we would like 
to show some examples of the preliminary research mentioned 
above. 
  Figure 4 shows an example of a material using 
Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/], a typical oxide ceramic, as a 
base. When highly pure alumina is sintered, a material is 
obtained with the fine, uniform structure shown in (a). As shown 
in (c), for alumina this sintered body is very strong, but it 
has a low fracture toughness. On the other hand, structure 
control can be performed to obtain the material shown in (b) by 
adding a trace amount of SiO[.sub]2[/] (ultra-ultra-micro 
level) to highly pure alumina under a gel-sol process and 
growing the Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] grains in plates while 
precipitating 
La[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]-11Al[.sub]2[/]O3 (micro 
level) in the plate phase at the same time. As a result, a 
material that is both very strong and very tough is obtained. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-025L-07A>      Figure 4 Example of Hierarchical Structure Control of </FIG>


  In previous Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] materials, those 
with microparticles were very strong but not very tough, whereas 
coarser materials were ordinarily very tough but not very 
strong. As shown in Figure 5, however, if we synthesize short, 
thick, rod-shaped monocrystalline 
_b_-Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] particles beforehand and add 
them in trace amounts, the sintered material has very small 
maximum defect dimensions, is very strong, and also has 
excellent toughness. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-025L-07B>      Figure. 5 Example of Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] </FIG>


  Figure 6 shows an example of SiC material. In the structure 
in (a), TiC grains were dispersed (micro level), and some of the 
dispersed Ti grains were replaced with W (ultra-micro level). As 
we can see from the comparison of the mechanical properties of 
various SiC-based materials shown in (b), with SiC-(Ti,W)C a 
harmony of mechanical properties is present that cannot be 
obtained in other materials. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-025L-08A>      Figure 6 Example of Hierarchical Structure Control of SiC </FIG>


  Naturally, these cases are results of initial or preliminary 
research on the concept of developing materials using 
hierarchical structure control. Unless we plan for 
wider-ranging, more sophisticated developments in the future in 
terms of structures and materials, material design must be based 
only on structure, function, or process. Below, we would like to 
consider the material design techniques where hierarchical 
structure control is likely to be most effective. 
  First calculations that predict the crystal structure and 
basic properties of chemical compounds are important. More 
specifically, these are calculations from basic formulas on the 
atomic/molecular or electron level that use molecular dynamics, 
molecular orbital theory and so on. Moreover, when we 
investigate new or complex series of materials, there are many 
instances in which we cannot come up with an experimental phase 
diagram, so a technique to predict the experimental phase 
diagram is needed. As far as the synthetic process is concerned, 
there are also many phenomena on which it would be useful to 
conduct computation experiments. If we take the sintering 
process for example, this can be done with the process of cavity 
elimination, movement of particle boundaries, particle growth 
and so on. Figure 7 shows a multiple phase particle growth 
simulation by the Monte Carlo method that includes a single 
phase and particle dispersion. It clearly shows that particle 
growth is suppressed by particle dispersion. If these kinds of 
methods can be developed further, it will be possible to predict 
controls for particle arrangement, crystal orientation and so 
on. Simulation techniques are related as well to evaluation and 
analysis techniques, and they can be used to predict fracturing, 
deformation, environmental degradation and so on. In addition, 
it is possible to anticipate optimal material structures for 
various properties by the analysis of computational results. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-025L-08B>      nnot&gt; Figure 7. Monte Carlo Simulation of Particle Growth </FIG>


  Needless to say, to make these prediction techniques 
effective for hierarchical structural control, we need holistic 
associations among the various simulation techniques and 
verification by model experiments. 
  4.2 Evaluation and Analysis Techniques 
  Support technology for hierarchical structure control must 
be 
approached from the standpoint of evaluation techniques. What we 
need is not the evaluation techniques of the past that were 
created for evaluation in general, but evaluation and analysis 
techniques that are directly connected to materials development. 
One important initiative is a technique for evaluating and 
analyzing dynamic behavior and mechanisms such as fracturing and 
structure formation. In-situ evaluation techniques that can 
capture constantly changing structures or properties will be 
extremely effective as support technologies for hierarchical 
structure control. 
  Another important initiative is evaluation and analysis 
technology that is closely related to material design. Figure 8 
shows an example of such research. First, in (a) a material was 
designed in which the Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] matrix is 
reinforced by the SiC-series fibers, and at the same time, some 
of the fibers or matrix phase is replaced by an electrically 
conductive ceramic. In (b) we see the results of material when 
some of the fibers are replaced by graphite fibers, and in (c) 
we see results when part of the matrix is replaced by a 
Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/]-TiN continuous phase. Thanks to 
the reinforcement by long fibers, we can see that these 
materials not only exhibit non-linear fracturing, but also a 
change in electrical resistance in response to localized 
fractures. More specifically, with the material in (c) we can 
detect a major change in electrical resistance at relatively 
early stages of deformation. By measuring the residual 
resistance in the material after adding and removing an electric 
charge, we can detect the extent of cumulative deformation 
(damage). Thus, the design and development of materials that are 
easy to evaluate or whose degradation behavior can be predicted 
and detected as needed will be very effective in improving the 
reliability of ceramics. The wide variety of properties of 
ceramics--electrical, magnetic, piezoelectric, dielectric, 
acoustic, optical, and chemical--can be widely utilized for 
detecting material fracturing, damage, wear, property 
degradation, corrosion by the environment and so on. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-025L-09A>      Figure 8. Design and Evaluation of Fracture-Detection </FIG>


<H5>  5. Spread of Hierarchical Structure Control Techniques </H5>
  Compared with materials such as metals and polymers, 
ceramics 
have a diversity of bonding forms, crystal structures, 
microstructures and so on, so the functions that each substance 
or material exhibits are also quite diverse. With hierarchical 
structure controlled ceramics we can expect effects such as 
presence of multiple functions (coexistence), which is difficult 
to achieve with other materials, and mutual enhancement of 
functions (synergy). Therefore, we would like to use the 
expression ``synergy ceramics'' to describe the image of 
materials that have undergone hierarchical structure control 
(hierarchical structure controlled fused inorganic materials). 
In so doing, we include the idea that we would like to see more 
material development that breaks down previous barriers and 
boundaries between structural and functional materials. 
  Figure 9 (not reproduced) is a conceptual drawing of the 
spread of synergy ceramics. Properties such as strength, 
toughness, heat resistance and the like are balanced with 
sophistication by hierarchical structure control. Moreover, 
materials that realize multiple functionality such as combined 
electromagnetic and chemical functions can be expected to find a 
wide range of applications in many fields. We can expect them to 
solve major energy and environmental problems as materials with 
the kind of high reliability not normally found in functional 
materials. 
<H5>  6. Conclusion </H5>
  Recent R&amp;D in ceramics has developed a reputation both 
at 
home and abroad as having become rather lethargic. However, that 
does not alter the basic fact that ceramics hold tremendous 
potential as advanced materials. As is the case with all 
materials, in charting a course in ceramics material development 
it is important to consider diverse phenomena and events from 
new points of view and break new ground. 
  The preliminary research to present experimental 
verification 
of the potential of hierarchical structure control draws to a 
close this year, and the ``Synergy Ceramics'' Project is 
scheduled to start anew in 1994. Based on the unique concept of 
hierarchical structure control, this will correspond to a 
national ceramics project involving the cooperation of industry, 
government and academia as we move toward the 21st Century. We 
must recognize once more the importance of the role Japan will 
play in the future. 
  The details presented in this article are not necessarily 
complete and certainly will be widely discussed in the future. 
We welcome the opinions and comments of our coworkers in this 
field.

  [Text] The Science and Technology Agency' s National 
Aerospace Laboratory has completed construction of a large 
supersonic wind tunnel and has begun test runs. The wind tunnel 
is to be used for thermal/aero-dynamic tests during development 
of the Japanese `HOPE' space shuttle experimental plane. 
Official tests will start in FY95. 
  The new wind tunnel is I27cm in diameter, twice as big as 
that which the NAL currently owns. The new wind tunnel is 
capable of creating a steady wind speed of Mach 10 only, while 
the old wind tunnel can produce Mach 5 to 11, but the new system 
can operate 5 times a day, enabling 2.5 time more experiments 
than before. 
  This is one of the largest wind tunnels in the world, 
measuring up to those in operation in the U.S., costing a total 
of about 3.5 billion yen. 
  The wind tunnel has at one end an air pressure storage 
facility capable of producing 200 atmospheres of pressure, and a 
large vacuum vessel at the other end. A heater, nozzle, and 
measurement chamber are located between the two ends. When high 
pressure air flows into the vacuum measurement chamber through 
the nozzle, the air in the nozzle expands under adiabatic 
conditions and accelerates its speed to generate an air current 
of Mach 10. 
  Thermal/aero-dynamic data for high velocity flight vehicles 
is often calculated through numerical simulations using 
computers nowadays. However, it is most effective to confirm 
such calculations through wind tunnel tests using scale models. 
The NAL believes that the new wind tunnel will be `useful for 
the development of space shuttles.

  [Text] The Science and Technology Agency' s National 
Aerospace Laboratory (NAL) announced on the 26th that they have 
successfully combustion tested their scramjet engine. An 
advanced engine, the scramjet is supposed to be installed in the 
manned space shuttle spaceplane' which is hoped to be operated 
commercially in the 21st century. Combustion time for the test 
model without coolant lasted only 6 seconds, but it was the 
first successful combution test in Japan. It is considered a 
big step forward toward the development of spaceplanes. 
  The test was conducted on 12 Apr 94 at the Ramjet Engine 
Test 
facility at NAL' s Kakuda Research Center (Kakuda City, Miyagi 
Prefecture) 
  The research engine used for the test consisted of a 
specially shaped copper alloy tube with a front air inlet 25cm 
in height, 2Ocm in width, and 2m in length. It was ignited 
under air flow equivalent to Mach 4 flight and a low pressure 
environment equivalent to altitude of 20km. Proper combustion 
of hydrogen fuel for 6 seconds was confirmed. 
  The scramjet is intended to fly at Mach 4-20 hypersonic 
speeds at high altitudes. It has a simple structure that 
requires no fans and turbines to compress air like conventional 
jet engines. Instead, air is shoved into the duct under wind 
pressure during flight at hypersonic speed and compressed by the 
forward motion of the engine. The air then passes through a 
diffuser and is mixed with hydrogen fuel and burned. Exhaust 
gases issue from the rear opening giving it thrust. 
  The engine used this time is intended to fly at lower speeds 
without coolant, NAL is planning to conduct combustion tests on 
a high speed water cooled engine prototype next fall. 
  Spaceplanes with scramjets take off from airports and return 
to earth after space flight. Every industrialized country is 
working toward their development.

  [Text] The Defense Agency disclosed that Mitsubishi Heavy 
Industries, as well as Kawasaki Heavy Industries, made 
presentations seeking the prime contractor status for UH-X, the 
next-generation multi-purpose helicopter for the Ground 
Self-Defense Force (GSDF), slated to be purchased in the next 
Mid-Term Defense Program (1996-2000). The agency will initiate 
the selection work immediately and pick the prime contractor by 
the end of FY93 so that its procurement can be included in the 
Defense Agency budget of FY95. 
  UH-X is a successor to UH-1H, which GFD is currently using 
for personnel transport and rescue operations. In addition to 
UH-X, there is another successor to UH-1H -- UH-1J. 
  UH-1J is a modification of UH-1H and is already being 
manufactured by Fuji Heavy Industries, the prime contractor 
under license from Bell Helicopter. The Defense Agency purchased 
12 units in FY91 and 13 each in FY92 and FY93 and will purchase 
14 units each in FY94 and FY95, according to the current 
Mid-Term Defense Program. 
  On the other hand, UH-X will be a larger helicopter than UH- 
1J, with improved performance including a higher load-carrying 
capacity and improved range. 
  Although the details of the presentations of the two 
companies have not been disclosed, UH-X is going to have a range 
of 1,300 km, which is about three times that of UH-1J. In 
addition to substantial increases in the maximum engine output 
and the personnel carrying capacity, equipment is also generally 
upgraded according to the Defense Agency's request standard. 
  Mitsubishi Heavy is proposing to meet the required 
specification by modifying the rescue helicopter, UH-60J, which 
has been manufactured and delivered to the Maritime Self-Defense 
Force and the Air Self-Defense Force under a manufacturing 
license from Sikorsky (U.S.); while Kawasaki Heavy is proposing 
to do the same, modifying the Cougar, a military helicopter made 
by Eurocopter of France. 
  The production is scheduled to start in FY95, the last year 
of the current Mid-Term Defense Program, to be delivered in 
FY98. Although the procurement quantity is unknown at this time, 
as the budget for the next Mid-Term Defense Program has not been 
prepared yet, it is expected that the procurement of several 
units will be included in the FY95 budget.

  [Text] In the second modified budget to be submitted by the 
cabinet to the Diet on 30 November, the Science and Technology 
Agency (STA) included the expedited construction plans for two 
key projects -- SPring-8, a large radiating light facility, 
which is being constructed in the Harima Science Park City in 
Hyogo Prefecture, and the Communications and Broadcasting 
Engineering Test Satellite (COMETS), which is scheduled to be 
launched in FY96. 
  Both projects are being accelerated in the belief that they 
will contribute to the enrichment of the citizen's life, which 
is one of Prime Minister Hosokawa's key slogans. The STA 
modification budget is expected to run up to &yen;16.1 billion. 
  The budget for the radiating light facility includes about 
&yen;7 billion in electron beam accelerator construction costs. 
The facility is being constructed through a joint effort of the 
Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute (JAERI) and the Institute 
of Physical and Chemical Research (IPCR). It will accelerate 
electron beams to a speed close to the speed of light with a 
linear accelerator and a synchrotron, and the resulting 
radiating light that will be generated when the electron orbit 
is bent will be taken out as a beam line to be used for 
materials experiments and medical diagnoses. 
  STA included &yen;7 billion for the expedited construction 
of 
said facility even in the first modified budget and is going to 
allocate &yen;12.7 billion for the same purpose in the 
preliminary budget request for the next year. The modification 
budget this time will make sure at least a portion of it becomes 
usable in FY97. About &yen;6.2 billion has been budgeted for the 
development of COMETS to expedite the manufacture of the 
engineering model and the actual unit. The development of this 
satellite, intended for television broadcasting, was started in 
FY90.

<H5>  Two-Ton Class Satellite in Geostationary Orbit </H5>
  The H2 launch vehicle, which Japanese space technology 
groups 
have waited so long for, is finally going to liftoff in February 
1994. It will be the first flight of the launcher, a vehicle 
that is based completely on the domestically developed 
technologies for the purpose of launching large geostationary 
satellites. 
  All the Japanese launch vehicles in the past, beginning with 
the N1, which was developed in 1974, and going to the N2 and H1, 
which were used for launching communications, broadcasting, 
weather, and earth-observation satellites were developed on the 
basis of the Delta rocket technology imported from the United 
States. The successful second-stage liquid oxygen/liquid 
hydrogen engine, LE5, and the stable platform-type 
inertial-guidance technology applied in the H1 launch vehicle 
helped Japanese satellite-launching technology rise to the 
highest level of the world. 
  As for the H2 launch vehicle, the research and development 
of 
the first-stage LOX/LH rocket engine, LE7, has been successfully 
completed; the inaugural launching this time will be the final 
confirmation of the development. The H2 is 49 meters high, 
weighs 260 tons when fully equipped for launching a 
geostationary satellite, and is capable of launching a two-ton 
satellite into geostationary orbit. 
  The main features of the H2 launch vehicle are the latest 
technologies employed in the first-stage engine, LE7, and the 
inertial-guidance system. The LE7 is a two-stage 
combustion-cycle high-pressure engine (main combustion chamber 
pressure: 130 atm). 
<H5>  LE7 -- Low-Pressure Design </H5>
  The two most well-known LOX/LH high-pressure 
high-performance 
rocket engines based on the same cycle as LE7 are the SSME (200 
atm), the main engine of the U.S. Space Shuttle, and the RD-120 
(166 atm), the main engine of Energiya, Russia's giant rocket. 
The ED-170, the engine of Energiya's SL-17/K-1 auxiliary rocket, 
consumes liquid oxygen and kerosine as fuels, and its combustion 
pressure is 250 atm. The SL-16, one of the launch vehicles that 
Russia is planning to use as its entry vehicle into the world 
commercial-satellite business, is equipped with the RD-170 in 
the first stage and the RD-120 in the second stage. 
  The SSME of the United States was originally developed to be 
re-used (the original plan was to use it 50 times), on the same 
level as aircraft engines; in reality, however, it requires 
substantial repairs each time. Since it is a high-pressure 
engine, both the oxygen and hydrogen systems consist of two 
system, i.e., low-pressure and high-pressure pump systems. 
Because of the inherent problems of high-pressure oxygen-pump 
system, the SSME is plagued with low reliability. Since the 
Japanese LE7 is designed to operate at a much lower combustion 
pressure, it has not experienced such problems. 
<H5>  Laser Gyro </H5>
  Russia's RD-170 uses the highest combustion pressure in the 
world; consequently, it is attracting the attention of engine 
builders all over the world. Although hot engine spots of the 
SSME and LE7 are cooled by hydrogen, such spots in the RD-170 
are cooled by oxygen, which may well be the new direction in the 
future. 
  The strap-down method used in the H2 for the guidance and 
navigational system is the latest technology. Different from the 
platform method, in which the local level is maintained in the 
vehicle irrespective of the motion of the vehicle, the 
strap-down method uses the onboard computer to calculate the 
attitude, position, and velocity vector of the vehicle to guide 
it to the target. Since it does not have any mechanical moving 
parts, a high reliability is expected to be achieved. The H2 is 
also equipped with a laser gyro, a Japanese cutting-edge 
electronics technology. 
  The H2 launch vehicle will gain for Japan the status of a 
full-fledged player in the world's commercial satellite business 
when it succeeds in launching Engineering Test Satellite 6 in 
the summer of 1994. The test launching in February 1994 is the 
first step toward that goal to bring about a successful launch.

  [Text] Tests are officially under way on the thermal 
structural model of the Advanced Earth Observing Satellite 
(ADEOS), which is being developed with Mitsubishi Electric Corp. 
serving as the prime contractor for the National Aerospace 
Development Agency of Japan (NASDA). 
  The functional performance checks of the ADEOS satellite 
with 
various sensors and electrical systems carried on board have 
already been confirmed using the engineering model (test model 
No. 1). The purpose of the thermal structural model is to check 
whether the satellite can withstand harsh changes in the space 
environment by testing the model in a simulated environment. 
  Various tests are scheduled to be completed by the end of 
FY93, and the manufacture of the actual satellite (to be 
launched) will start in the autumn of next year if the test 
results are good, to be ready for the first launch scheduled in 
February 1996. 
  ADEOS is intended for obtaining global-scale observation 
data 
on environmental changes such as global warming, destruction of 
the ozone layer, receding of tropical rain forests, occurrence 
of abnormal weather, etc., in order to contribute to and help 
the international earth environment observation. It also employs 
innovations such as data relays between satellites, which will 
be an essential factor in the earth observation system of the 
next generation, in order to improve space advancement 
technology itself. This research and development of this 
satellite started in the early '90s, and the total investment is 
expected to reach &yen;80 billion. 
  Eight different kinds of sensors are carried on ADEOS in 
order to observe the land and sea areas, as well as the 
atmosphere. The sensors have been developed by manufacturers 
involved in space activities such as Mitsubishi, Toshiba, and 
NEC. 
  The tests using the thermal structure model will be 
conducted 
at NASDA's Tsukuba Space Center. They are to verify whether the 
satellite itself can function as specified in a space 
environment whose temperatures range from 200ÎC to 
-200ÎC and whether the command system can withstand the 
vacuum that is simulated by the test facility.

  [Text] They do not live on Mars or any other planet. They 
live among us. The calls for help issuing from their throats 
deafen our ears. Yet, we do nothing to rescue them even though 
we can. Rather we definitely can rescue them. 
  Their hearts beat with their love for the land on which they 
have grown up and into which their roots strike deeply, defying 
all the endeavors to uproot them. 
  They defy despair. A blow that does not kill them makes them 
cling to the soil more tenaciously. They muster whatever 
strength they continue to have and they move forward pace by 
pace, defying the despair toward which they are led by the 
occupation policies and by kinsmen's negligence, which is even 
more painful and which has surpassed all bounds and exceeded all 
imagination. Their will is the strong rock, which stands as a 
firm barrier in the face of all endeavors to break their sacred 
bond with the land. This land, whose soil has been mixed with 
the sweat of their brow, is everything to them. It is the air 
they breathe and the blood that runs in their veins and gives 
them life. It is the forefathers' will, and it is the homeland 
over which they dream of establishing their sovereignty, as all 
other simple peoples do. These people are the Palestinian 
farmers who live under harsh and difficult circumstances, which 
no other sector could endure, especially in light of the 
negligence and of injustice to which they are subjected by all 
the sides that are supposed to aid them, to help alleviate their 
hardship, and to curtail the immense losses they incur every 
season, particularly since they constitute more than 30 percent 
of the West Bank and Gaza Strip population! 
  What is the real condition of the Palestinian agricultural 
sector today? What are the most significant obstacles facing 
this sector, almost dealing it fatal blows? 
  Why is this sector subjected more than other sectors to 
immense losses in most, not to say all, seasons right before the 
eyes and within earshot of the people concerned who have 
undertaken to protect and support it? 
  Moreover, what do farmers themselves say about the real 
conditions under which they live and the losses they incur? 
  Finally, how do farmers see the future of agriculture in the 
occupied territories, and is there hope that these conditions 
will improve? 
  This is what AL-BAYADIR AL-SIYASI will show in this 
investigative report through which we dot the i's and cross the 
t's with utter objectivity and without allowing ourselves to be 
carried away by our imagination in the issue of Palestinian 
farmers and the future of Palestinian agriculture in the 
occupied territories. 
<H5>  Facts and Pains </H5>
  A most significant problem that encounters a journalist when 
he is gathering the material necessary for this or that report, 
especially in the occupied territories, is the scarcity of 
accurate figures and statistics on cultivated acreage, for 
example; on the number of workers in this sector; on the annual 
yield of this or that basic crop on which our farmer relies 
fundamentally; on the irrigated acreage and the volume of water 
needed to irrigate this acreage; and on dryland farming acreage. 
Such figures and statistics are scarce despite the presence of 
hundreds, not to say thousands, of agricultural associations and 
organizations that have been founded in the occupied territories 
to serve this sector in the first place, to attend to its 
affairs, and to deal with its problems. But it seems that those 
in charge of this sector do not, very regrettably, take the 
trouble to conduct the necessary studies in this regard. If they 
conduct a few such studies, they rely for their data on studies 
conducted by the other [Israeli] side, which always distorts the 
facts, especially in connection with land issues. Moreover, it 
is almost impossible to get the data from government 
agricultural offices that have such data because of laws that 
prohibit officials from dealing with the press. Fortunate is the 
journalist who manages to interview the press spokesman for one 
of these offices, after a pursuit of several months at least. In 
most cases, it is impossible to get such an interview for a 
variety of reasons, some of which we ourselves create and some 
beyond our control. 
  Like the Palestinian people's other sectors, the Palestinian 
agricultural sector has been targeted primarily since the start 
of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. This 
sector has encountered a great degree of harassment and 
pressures. Obstacles have been placed in the path of its 
development through dozens of military directives that have 
sought to diminish and wipe out this sector, especially since it 
signifies a lot. Before anything else, this sector signifies the 
land over which the struggle revolves between two peoples, each 
of whom tries to assert its historical right to this land. 
<H5>  Objective Is Disengagement </H5>
  Since the start of occupation, the authorities have employed 
numerous means to break the strong bond between the Palestinian 
and his land, to which he clings as he clings to life. Thousands 
of arable dunums of land have been used for settlement, 
military, and public purposes. The area of land seized by Israel 
since 1967 is 2.2 million dunums, i.e., 40 percent of the West 
Bank land, which has a total area of 5.5 million dunums. This is 
in addition to thousands of other dunums that have been 
confiscated and on which no accurate statistics are available. 
The latest such act was the announcement made just a few days 
after conclusion of the declaration of principles in Washington 
about the confiscation of 5,000 dunums to establish natural 
protectorates in the West Bank! 
  Moreover, the authorities have prevented farmers from 
drilling artesian wells to irrigate crops so as to ensure that 
the cultivated area does not expand and to prevent the 
reclamation of new lands after the water necessary for 
irrigation becomes available. These authorities have employed as 
pretext in this regard the Jordanian law, which they use 
whenever it serves their interests. This law prohibits, 
according to their allegation, drilling artesian wells for 
irrigation purposes in order to preserve underground water 
resources and to ensure that large quantities of this water are 
not pumped out, thus increasing water salinity and making water 
unfit for drinking. 
  The authorities also resorted to other means to besiege this 
sector and to cause it to despair, considering that they have 
inundated Palestinian markets with Israeli agricultural 
products, thus pitting domestic Palestinian production in an 
unfair competition against the developed Israeli product. These 
authorities then proceeded to ban the entry of Palestinian 
production to Israeli markets. In most years, they have also 
banned the export of the surplus exceeding the domestic market's 
need to the Arab markets, especially to Jordan. 
<H5>  Occupation Is Not Only Reason </H5>
  The more intelligent means to which the authorities have 
resorted since the start of the occupation is to open the 
various sectors of Israeli work to Palestinian farmers at very 
tempting wages. At times, farmers working in these sectors 
collected in one month wages exceeding their entire annual 
income from farming. Thus numerous small farmers were encouraged 
to abandon the land and to go to work in Israel. This, in turn, 
made it easier for the authorities to confiscate vast areas of 
land on the pretext that they are not exploited and cultivated. 
  To tell the truth, occupation is not the only reason why the 
Palestinian agricultural condition has slipped to this level of 
misery. The occupation charted its policy and our Palestinian 
institutions have, very regrettably, implemented this policy by 
neglecting this sector, by denying farmers financing that 
enables them to continue to exploit and cultivate the land, and 
by diverting funds allocated to aid this sector to the wrong 
circles, even though agricultural institutions have proliferated 
greatly in the occupied territories recently. It is well known 
that in any country, the purpose of the presence of such 
institutions is to serve the farmers and to look for markets to 
sell their products, especially when there are no markets that 
ensure that agricultural production is sold at good prices that 
yield a good return for the farmer, as is the case with 
Palestinian farmers today. Their purpose is also to protect land 
and crops and to enlighten farmers and educate them of the 
necessity of clinging to and utilizing their land that is faced 
with danger if it is abandoned. But in the occupied territories, 
these institutions have a different idea and their services are 
confined to certain people who do not need aid in the first 
place and who may be as far as can be from agriculture. 
Meanwhile, small farmers suffer the worst hardship. One should 
also note that dozens of these associations are no more than ink 
on paper and a bank account number. 
  One may wonder: What is the role of the agriculture offices 
that proliferate the West Bank? Very regrettably, they are in no 
better a position than numerous other national institutions that 
are supposed to spread awareness among farmers; to offer them 
guidance and help them; to supply them with the pesticides they 
need to fight maladies and diseases that devastate their crops; 
and to make field visits so as to familiarize themselves with 
the farmers' conditions and to acquaint them with modern farming 
methods. However, rarely do these offices take the trouble to 
distribute an educational leaflet on modern agriculture or on 
fighting diseases that destroy crops--which have spread greatly 
and in mysterious ways recently. In some seasons, the cost of 
pesticides and remedies used in agriculture is more than the 
farmer's returns, because pesticide prices are high and because 
the remedies are adulterated at times. 
<H5>  Farmer Is Victim </H5>
  There are dozens of examples of negligence of the 
agricultural sector, including the case of farmer 'Abdallah 
'Awdah al-Rujub from Dura. Al-Rujub has been knocking on the 
doors of agricultural institutions and loan institutions for 
four years in an effort to save his 10-dunum farm, but to no 
avail. Al-Rujub's cultivated acreage has shrunk to less than 
three dunums because he has been unable to secure the funds 
needed to improve the farm and to enlarge his well, which would 
irrigate many times this acreage if he could realize his dreams 
to deepen and broaden the well and to secure the necessary 
modern irrigation equipment. Al-Rujub has obtained part of this 
equipment at the expense of his children's sustenance, in the 
hope that somebody will help him complete this good project. 
  "I have an existing project," says al-Rujub, "and it 
consists 
of 10 dunums of land which contain a spring. In the past, I 
exploited just about one-half dunum according to the traditional 
farming method of basin cultivation. Three years ago, I enlarged 
the spring, making it 20 meters long, five meters wide, and two 
meters deep. Using drip and sprinkler irritation, I then 
cultivated nearly five dunums. I later tried to develop the 
project and to enlarge the spring site even more because water 
volume increases in winter. I wanted to exploit that [extra] 
water to cultivate the remaining acreage in the summer. The cost 
was estimated at the time at 9,000 Jordanian dinars. Had the sum 
been secured, I would have been able to employ 10 people in this 
project in return for a very little investment." 
<H5>  Evident Discrimination in Loans </H5>
  Al-Rujub went on to add, "I have been knocking at the doors 
of all associations and institutions for four years, most 
significantly the Economic Development Association. Very 
regrettably, when I met with one of this association's officials 
and explained the project to him, he said the association grants 
loans for industrial purposes only, not for agriculture, keeping 
in mind that the association has advanced loans for the purchase 
of cattle and sheep. I am fully confident that if I had asked 
the man for an industrial loan, he would have told me that they 
give loans to agricultural projects only. This was not the only 
request I made. Initially, I sent a registered letter to the 
association. Then I delivered another letter by hand to the 
secretary six months later. To date, I have not received any 
response. Why? 
  "I wonder: Why they do not help me with a loan that I can 
repay within a short period--perhaps no more than one year--from 
the yield of the same land for which the loan is to be 
exploited? Am I not an Arab Palestinian citizen who continues to 
make sacrifices to this day? Are they fair in their loans, or do 
they discriminate between one citizen and another? I wonder: 
What are the criteria on which they base their loan 
distribution? This is not the first time. Previously, I planted 
1,000 olive trees in mountainous land that I reclaimed with 
bulldozers at my own expense. Nobody offered me any loan or 
assistance. 
  "This is not an individual issue. It is an issue experienced 
by the major part of the Palestinian agricultural sector as a 
result of neglect by these institutions and of evident 
discrimination in the loan and aid policies at a time when lands 
are being confiscated hysterically. Is it not the duty of these 
institutions, which abound in the occupied territories, to 
devote attention to the land and to encourage the citizen to 
exploit it? Is it not their duty to support and aid farmers and 
to protect the land? I raise these questions in the hope that we 
will find somebody to answer them. 
  "I say very frankly that if, on top of the circumstances 
that 
are beyond our control, the current condition persists and if 
this negligence continues, then say good-bye to agriculture and, 
consequently, to the land. Everybody will have to be then tasked 
for what he has done, and we will have to content ourselves with 
`sheep and cattle' and with imaginary projects. 
  "The losses we incur are great and grievous losses. Yet, we 
persevere, and we continue to work the land in the hope that 
conditions and circumstances will improve and that some of these 
losses will be recouped. The Palestinian parties concerned are 
supposed to compensate us for these losses, if they are truly 
concerned with the land and if their goal is to defend and 
liberate the land!" 
<H5>  Constant Loss </H5>
  Describing the current conditions under which farmers live 
and the constant losses they incur, Farmer Muhammad 
'Abd-al-Hamid Muhsin has said: 
  "The truth is that agriculture and agricultural work are no 
longer profitable under these circumstances in which loss has 
become the main characteristic distinguishing this sector. This 
is the result of scarcity of rain this season and of greatly 
reduced prices, compared to higher planting, fertilizer, seed, 
and irrigation water costs. When the crop is taken to market, it 
is sold at very cheap prices, because supply is greater than 
demand. This is the result of lack of farming policies and of 
sound agricultural planning among farmers, the majority of whom 
focus on one crop in most seasons. 
  "This year, farmers who rely on dryland farming have 
suffered 
a hard blow as a result of scarce rainfall. The blow will be 
even harder for farmers who rely on irrigated farming next 
summer, because underground irrigation water volume will be very 
small when compared with previous years." 
  Muhsin went on to add, "This season is bad. Very 
regrettably, 
the farmer alone will incur a big loss because of the absence of 
a national government and because of negligence by agricultural 
associations and other institutions that are not concerned with 
the agricultural sector, unlike the Israeli farmer who is 
protected by the government that compensates him for his losses 
and secures for him whatever he needs! 
  "I believe that agriculture's future is dark, especially if 
favoritism persists in the departments concerned and if the 
Palestinian agricultural sector continues to be treated as it is 
treated currently, at a time when it is experiencing great 
hardship and when it stands alone without finding anybody to 
support it in its numerous ordeals." 
  Another farmer has said, "This sector has been facing big 
problems, especially since the Palestinian associations 
concerned have focused on the industrial sector exclusively, 
thus inflicting a great injustice on the agricultural sector, 
which employs more than 30 percent of the occupied territories' 
inhabitants who rely basically on agriculture to secure their 
families' livelihood. 
  "There is nobody to protect the Palestinian farmer or to 
compensate him in these seasons in which he has suffered immense 
losses because of low prices, high cost, and strong competition 
by Israeli products, which invade all domestic markets, whereas 
Israeli markets are banned to our products. The objective is to 
deal the Palestinian farmer a blow and to protect the Israeli 
farmer who lives under conditions that are greatly different 
from ours." 
<H5>  Marj Bin 'Amir Is Sad This Year </H5>
  Farmer Yusuf 'Uraydi from 'Arrabah has said that rain 
scarcity in Marj Bin 'Amir will have a very negative impact on 
summer crops this year. 'Uraydi's opinion is shared by farmer 
'Azmi Abu-al-Rabb, a member of the Jalbun Agricultural 
Association's Executive Council, who has said, "This year, the 
season will be bad because of rain scarcity. Numerous farmers in 
Jalbun village have re-seeded because the major part of the seed 
has rotted. Should the drought continue, God forbid, it will be 
catastrophic for farmers, especially in the absence of a 
government that cares for and aids them." Abu-al-Rabb added, 
"The Israeli Government has declared some parts of its 
agricultural areas drought-stricken lands. This declaration will 
aid the Israeli farmer, whereas the Palestinian farmer finds 
nobody to aid or care for him!" 
  Farmer Ramzi Sha'ban from al-Jalamah and farmer Hazim 
Shallash from Kafra'i focused their statements on the blow 
suffered by the agricultural sector this year as a result of 
rain scarcity and drought. 
<H5>  In Conclusion </H5>
  This is the painful reality under which the Palestinian 
agricultural sector lives these days. This sector has no gleam 
of hope that conditions will improve in the near future, and it 
displays great fear of a dark future, especially since 
negligence and injustice have left their imprints on it. 
Negligence and injustice have been tantamount to a hard blow 
dealt this sector, which has been fighting for decades the 
policy to break the bond between man and land and the attempt to 
drive man away from his land through confiscation, inducements, 
or successive blows. The result is immense losses incurred by 
the Palestinian farmer alone. There is nobody to care for this 
farmer him or to aid him farmer and help him overcome the 
obstacles and march forth on his path! 
  This sector's future will be truly dark, especially if the 
injustice inflicted on the farmers persists, as farmers say, and 
if the current policies, which inevitably mean the destruction 
of agriculture and abandonment of the land, continue in the 
future.

<F P=106> [Article by 'Abd-al-Rahim Qawsini: "Visions on Future of </F>
Press Freedom Under Coming Palestinian Authority"] 
  [Text] What is the future of press freedom in the coming 
phase when Palestinians take over the reigns of government? 
  Is there fear that the move will be from the Israeli 
military 
censor to a Palestinian censor controlling our domestic press? 
  These are notions and questions that occur to the mind of 
the 
occupied territories' press workers who hope that the coming 
phase will be a phase of openness and free expression that 
compensates Palestinians for the deprivation they have endured 
in the preceding phase. Here, I will record the visions and 
expectations of a number of specialists and workers in the 
Palestinian press. 
  Journalist Majid 'Aruri, from Sanabil Press Bureau in 
Ramallah, believes that the Palestinian press has been 
restricted, even before the arrival of autonomy. In addition to 
the Israeli military censor's control, Palestinian organizations 
have experienced control over most of the press publications 
issued in the occupied territories. The Palestinian journalist 
has not been able to offer press analyses and reports 
conflicting with the tendencies of the existing political 
organizations. The other papers (AL-QUDS and AL-NAHAR) have been 
characterized by their neutral presentation, which imposes 
restrictions on any critical press material, especially material 
addressed to the official circles. Despite the liberalism it has 
displayed in the past two years, AL-NAHAR does not allow any 
articles it publishes to criticize Jordan. 
  Therefore, any paper controlled by the party that finances 
it 
during the occupation era will continue to experience the same 
problem under the autonomous authority, which will also take 
control of censorship and of issuing permits to publish papers. 
Thus, autonomy will employ its authority to prevent the 
emergence of any voices that criticize autonomy. This task will 
be easy in the absence of a press union body capable of 
confronting this policy. The union body (i.e., the Journalists 
League) is controlled and dominated by the tendency supporting 
self-rule, even though it incorporates other parties. However, 
these parties' role is ineffective and not influential. 
  Journalist 'Ali Jiddah from AL-QUDS newspaper has said: 
  "Very regrettably, I say that in the coming phase, the 
Palestinian press will not be in a better condition than its 
current condition, not to say that it will be in a more 
difficult condition. I say this by virtue of my full awareness 
of the Palestinian forces' miserable history of democratic 
action. Moreover, the coming government will focus its efforts 
on cementing and entrenching the mainstays of its rule, which 
necessarily means that it will try to curb the voice and echo of 
the forces that are likely to pose a threat to this government 
and to its authority. 
  "I assert that this is what will happen in the future, 
especially since the statements of some Palestinian officials 
point in this direction. I will particularly note Hakam 
Bal'awi's statements on how the opposition will be dealt with in 
the future." 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Sattar Qasim, from the Political Science Section 
of al-Najah University, has said: 
  "Future press freedom is tied to the Gaza-Jericho accord, 
i.e., it is tied to the degree of freedom permitted by the 
accord. Freedom is restricted by the provisions of the accord. 
For example, it isn't permissible to incite against Israel. The 
Palestinian government will have to respect this tendency. Else, 
it will violate the accord. 
  "Therefore, there will be a Palestinian censor. If one 
doesn't exist, Israel will insist on his presence, keeping in 
mind that a Palestinian censor is operating now while the 
occupation exercises its own censorship. So, how will the 
situation be in case a government overseeing daily life is 
established!" 
  Journalist Hani al-'Isawi from Jerusalem has said: 
  "I don't believe that there will be an independent 
Palestinian government if the accord is implemented. What will 
be there is a civil administration controlled by the occupation. 
At best, it will be the authority of one individual who 
establishes laws compatible with his interests and plans. This 
is why one cannot talk about any form of freedom under the 
canopy of a self-rule like the rule projected currently. 
  "I believe that the current military censor watches press 
material from the security angle. But if there is press under 
self-rule, it will be a yellow press, i.e., government press 
solely. It is feared that whoever violates this [rule] will be 
pursued. Therefore, there will be no need for a special press 
censor, because all agencies under autonomy will be in the 
service of government propaganda solely." 
  Journalist Ghazi Bani 'Awdah has said: 
  "I don't believe that press conditions under the self-rule 
government will be fundamentally different from the current 
conditions. All signs indicate in one way or another that 
oppression and persecution will be the lot of any voice or pen 
that writes about real issues and that doesn't sing the praises 
of autonomy and doesn't applaud the cardboard feats and 
accomplishments of the coming leadership. Let us learn a lesson 
from the recent expulsion of Hijazi, a journalist, from FILASTIN 
AL-THAWRAH and from numerous other incidents. 
  "As for censorship, there is no doubt that the coming 
Palestinian authority's censor will `capably' replace the 
Israeli censor, even though materials affected by this `censor's 
scissors' will be different at times from materials affected 
under the occupation." 
  Journalist Amin Abu-Wardah from AL-QUDS PRESS AGENCY 
believes 
that "the Palestinian people's hardship in all fields dictates 
that any authority that takes control of the reigns avoid 
whatever can touch the wounds of all Palestinian people and 
whatever undermines the sanctity of the individual who has taken 
part in the ceaseless struggle to attain his rights and who has 
made great sacrifices for these rights. 
  "This is why I expect, optimistically, great openness in the 
press. But there is a founded fear of the future because of the 
numerous experiences of the Arab world where authoritarianism 
prevails despite all the raised slogans that have been proved to 
be a failure by reality. However, it is my hope that the 
Palestinian experiment will be distinguished by giving the 
opportunity to everybody to express his positions and opinions 
democratically."

<F P=106> [Article by APS: "`Good Prospects' for Cooperation With </F>
Japan"] 
  [Text] Economic relations between Algeria and Japan are 
destined to "grow stronger" and "expand" following the visit to 
Tokyo last week of Algeria's economic affairs minister, Mr. 
Mourad Benachenhou, sources close to the ministry said yesterday. 
  "There are good prospects for strengthening and increasing 
the volume of trade between Algeria and Japan," sources said, 
adding that the Japanese side "reacted favorably and 
sympathetically to Algeria's commitment" to move toward a market 
economy. 
  The purpose of Mr. Benachenhou's visit was to "inform 
top-level Japanese officials of the substance of the new 
economic policy decided by the Algerian Government as part of 
the transition to a market economy," said ministry sources, 
without divulging more specifics. 
  The minister held talks "in an atmosphere of frankness and 
professionalism" with the Japanese minister for industry and 
international commerce, the deputy foreign affairs minister for 
international economic relations, the directors general of 
Eximbank [Export-Import Bank] and the Overseas Economic 
Cooperation Fund, the vice president of Keidanren (employers' 
association), and other Japanese economic leaders. 
  Additional meetings were planned by the two sides and should 
take place "in the near future," sources added. 
  Japan, which after France is Algeria's biggest creditor, has 
made commitments to participate in diverse investment projects 
in Algeria, including the vast program to renovate Algeria's 
natural gas facilities, to the tune of credits totaling close to 
$1.5 billion, it was noted. 
  Algeria is preparing to conclude a temporary "standby" 
agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), to be 
followed by a three-year "expanded adjustment accord" to support 
an easing of the debt service burden, which at its current level 
of $9 billion will consume more than 97 percent of hydrocarbon 
exchange earnings this year. 
  Admitting for the first time that Algeria could no longer 
meet its essential needs without a reduction in payments on its 
external debt, which now totals close to $26 billion, 
authorities last December asked for a "multilateral debt 
restructuring" without the strict conditionality that generally 
accompanies conventional reschedulings. 
  The standby accord must be accompanied by 
balance-of-payments 
support financing on the order of several hundred millions of 
dollars, said IMF director-general Michel Camdessus on 25 
February, at the conclusion of a 24-hour visit to Algeria. 
  The accord should also facilitate unblocking remaining 
tranches of certain multilateral lines of credit, including 1992 
European Community credit lines totaling 400 million ECU 
[European currency units] (about $500 million). 
  During the negotiations that began last September between 
the 
IMF and Algerian authorities, the latter announced they had 
appealed to the Group of Seven (G-7)--the seven major industrial 
nations, including Japan--to support their request for special 
treatment in view of Algeria's severe economic, political, and 
social problems. 
  Following the example of France, which Mr. Benachenhou 
visited before Tokyo, the principal partners responded favorably 
to that request with statements of good intentions--but they 
conditioned any concrete support to conclusion of an accord 
between Algeria and the IMF.

<F P=106> [Article by R.N.: "Denunciations of a Barbarous Crime"; </F>
first 4 paragraphs are ALGER REPUBLICAIN introduction] 
  [Text]The assassination of world-renowned dramatist 
Abdelkader Alloula has deeply affected everyone who ever crossed 
his path or knew him, directly or through his works. 
  A number of condolence messages and statements, 
denouncing the barbarous crime and the crusade of hatred, which 
the fundamentalists are waging against Algeria and its citizens, 
have been received by our editorial department. Most are from 
anonymous citizens, like the young people of Tizi-Ouzou (Said 
and Mouloud) who in their message of condolence call on 
democrats and republicans to form a "united front against 
fascist, fundamentalist barbarism..." 
  Two women's associations, RAFD [Algerian Rally of Women 
for Democracy] and AFEPEC [Women's Association for Personal 
Growth and Exercise of Citizenship], also made their views 
known. 
  The only political party to speak out, in a long 
statement from which we reprint extensive extracts below, was 
the Ettahaddi movement--faithful as ever to its 
antifundamentalist position and its struggle for republican 
values. 
<H5>  A Citizen Reacts [Article by Farida Ramse] </H5>
  Abdelkader Alloula is gone. A man of culture, an Algerian of 
talent and integrity, is with us no more. Another name has been 
added to the grim roster of the victims of terrorism. Another 
chapter of Algeria's history is written in blood. But our 
politicians remain indifferent and do nothing to stop the 
terrorism. And what does it mean, the silence of the 
politicians, the absence of initiatives? Are the politicians 
completely powerless to change the situation? What exactly have 
they done? With every passing day, more men and women are 
shamefully assassinated by villainous outlaws; not even children 
are spared. The Algerian people are groaning in agony. Fear and 
terror reign in the streets, homes, and schools. 
  No, no, no! Too much, it's too much! How can we tolerate the 
wholesale slaughter of innocents at the hands of blind 
fundamentalism? We have never really mourned our dead: We have 
mourned only our own weaknesses. 
  But the majority of Algeria's citizens, myself included, 
have expressed firm resolve to put an end to these terrorists 
and to proclaim loud and forcefully, to their supposed 
protector, that a policy driven by terrorism is unacceptable. 
They have argued, time and again, that these terrorist tactics 
are a distortion of authentic Islam and have openly condemned 
the extremists, whose narrow economic and political interests 
are so thinly veiled. 
  The Algerian people have suffered enough. They bear the 
scars 
of crimes perpetrated by those who were their adversary in the 
past and remain their enemy today. The people aspire for peace, 
in justice and freedom. To realize that hope, they are calling 
on all patriots to insist that the regime put an end to all 
efforts to destroy national unity, unmask the destabilizers 
trying to exploit civil turmoil, and put an end to the massacre 
of Algeria and Algerians. 
<H5>  Ettahaddi Movement </H5>
  The slender thread of hope for the survival of our brother 
Abdelkader Alloula has been severed. One of the nation's 
irreplaceable cultural and artistic treasures has been shattered. 
  This is what fundamentalism is really about, for nothing but 
violence and extremism can result from its totalitarian, 
obscurantist ideology. No so-called tactical concessions, no 
conciliatory gestures, no rhetoric of appeasement will change 
its fascist, dictatorial, and warlike character. 
  Honorable, patriotic Algerians will not forget that at a 
time 
when assassinations are taking the lives of its writers and 
poets, of thinkers and scientists, of white-collar and 
blue-collar workers, of men and women who reject fundamentalist 
oppression and terror, almost the entire political class and 
certain coteries within the regime are behaving with 
ever-increasing cowardice and irresponsibility in their efforts 
to absolve and rehabilitate the Islamist parties and their 
criminal leaders. 
  Algerian patriots will not forget the work and struggle of 
Abdelkader Alloula. They will honor his memory and that of those 
before him who gave their lives for the preservation of the 
state and the defense of democratic, republican, and progressive 
values. 
  The Ettahaddi movement calls on the population of Oran and 
the surrounding region, indeed on all Algerian men and women who 
want their children to have a future of dignity and freedom, to 
make the funeral services for A. Alloula a great occasion of 
mobilization against fundamentalist terrorism, its instigators, 
and its protectors. It is still waiting for the authorities to 
quit shirking their responsibility. Algiers, 14 March 1994.

<F P=106> [Unattributed letter to President Zeroual: "Avoiding Drift"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Mr. President: 
  On this date, 8 March, on the eve of aid, we are greatly 
distressed to see our country sinking into chaos. Our distress 
increases with every passing day before the resurgence of 
hideous terrorist acts, the assassination of Algeria's most 
promising children. These ignoble acts have become even more 
prevalent since the enacting of conciliatory measures and the 
calls for dialogue with those who are digging the grave of a 
modern and republican Algeria: those who want to seize power, 
all power, to impose on us their vision of a fundamentalist 
society and engulf the country in fire and blood. 
  Far from helping to extricate our country from the crisis, 
these measures and these appeals have succeeded only in 
confusing the women and men who are struggling to create a 
resolutely modern society and whose hopes must not be 
disappointed. These measures have succeeded only in encouraging 
the enemies of Algeria to deepen the climate of terror and 
insecurity. 
  Mr. President, the "cult of bloodshed" continues to drain 
Algeria's lifeblood and mutilate its families. In their 
organized and murderous insanity, the forces of terrorism are 
attacking the children, the womenfolk, who have always been 
singled out as special targets by totalitarian fundamentalism. 
Mr. President, in every way from the infamous Family Code to 
physical liquidation--and including intimidation, threats, rape, 
and abduction--flesh-and-blood women are being subjected to the 
horrors of a diabolic cycle of barbarism. 
  Mr. President, women refuse to be sacrificed yet again on 
the 
altar of a suicidal policy or a pact with the devil. The real 
interlocutors in a dialogue about the future of modern Algeria 
should be the women and men who believe in it, who are fighting 
with their bare hands to keep this country from falling under 
the sway of an Islamist dictatorship. [passage omitted]

Combined   Offensive: Commander `Dismissed'

<F P=106> [Article by D.A.: "Combined Forces in Action"] </F>
  [Text] An offensive by the combined forces of the security 
services--chiefly the Army--is now being visibly confirmed in 
the field. Just about everywhere, but especially in the zones 
most affected by terrorism (Batna, Lakhdaria, Jijel, Bel Abbes, 
Blida, Constantine, and so on), those forces are currently 
applying very strong pressure. According to our sources, that 
pressure is making itself clearly felt in the pockets of 
terrorism thanks to a general redeployment using every means 
including aviation, helicopters, and semiheavy weapons. 
  In recent days, for example, a large contingent of ANP 
[People's National Army] special forces occupied the Aures 
Mountains, where they wiped out a great many escapees from 
Lambese. Those same special forces have energetically gotten the 
situation under control over vast areas, particularly around 
Ksar El Boukhari, Medea, Ain Defla, Chlef, and Blida, which have 
literally been gone over with a fine-tooth comb. It should be 
pointed out that the Army's special forces consist of paratroops 
from the Biskra Airborne School. They are seasoned elite troops, 
one battalion of which can easily rival the equivalent of 10 
conventional armed battalions. 
  The same sources say that the merciless counteroffensive 
being conducted by the combined forces actually began the very 
next day after the march on 22 March. But the permanent presence 
of the state and the organization in stages of general 
offensives in the field are in fact the result of decisions made 
at meetings by the Army High Command several weeks ago, as 
reported by our newspaper around the end of Ramadan. 
  What seems completely new in the antiterrorist struggle is 
the fact that now, as our sources point out, the security forces 
are using proven methods for dismantling armed groups. It will 
be noted, for example, that false roadblocks have been taken by 
surprise and their perpetrators killed thanks to infiltration by 
the security services, whose members mix with the public as 
ordinary bus passengers. 
  Tracking down terrorists has become a matter of seconds, so 
to speak, for the ANP special forces in simultaneous action with 
the police and the Gendarmerie. General Betchine's recent 
appointment as minister-adviser to the office of the president 
means, naturally, that Betchine is responsible in particular for 
coordination of the security services at the highest level in 
that simultaneous action. 
  Especially since Gen. Betchine has had a long career in the 
ANP and, before that, in the ALN [National Liberation Army]. 
Besides being perfectly aware of what is going on, he is also 
known as a hard-liner and an intransigent nationalist who was 
unhesitatingly among the few key figures to tell Chadli 
Bendjedid directly that he should not legalize the FIS [Islamic 
Salvation Front]. 
  In what is apparently a new direction being taken in 
antiterrorist action, this regaining of control over the 
security situation also relies on active participation by the 
public. 
  Feeling concerned, citizens have recently stepped in by 
reporting the exact layout of the land and of hiding places 
known to them as places where terrorists could be taking refuge. 
Significant results have thus been achieved in this 
antiterrorist struggle, both in the bush and in the cities, and 
it seems that the official figures on the casualties suffered by 
terrorism are far from reflecting reality. Apparently they 
reflect partial counts, with the correct figures being 
considerably higher. 
  The fact remains that this operation to regain control has 
given rise to news reports of all kinds. In Mitidja, for 
example, on the day after the "curfew" imposed by the 
terrorists, there was a persistent rumor to the effect that the 
commander of the 1st Military Region had been dismissed because 
a garrison city (29 barracks) like Blida had inexplicably fallen 
into the hands of the terrorists. 
  That report has been neither denied nor confirmed, although 
it now seems certain that Blida and its region are completely 
under control from the security standpoint. In other words, 
communication is still not the government's strong point.

<F P=106> [Article by M. Abderrahmane: "Does the FIS Still Count in </F>
the Field?"; first paragraph is EL WATAN introduction] 
  [Text] The threats contained in the latest communique 
from the GIA [Armed Islamic Group] and directed at Hamas 
[Islamic Society Movement] and Nahdah are more than eloquent. 
After accusing them of being either hypocrites or "mukhabarat," 
the spokesman in Bonn promises a violent death for their leaders 
as well as any leaders of the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] who 
might have the poor judgment to hold discussions with the 
government. Are those threats the reason why the FIS has not 
lived up to the terms of its deal with the government? 
  The communique dated from Bonn accuses Nahnah's party of 
being in fact a tool of the regime because delegations 
consisting of Hamas cadres held press conferences in Europe and 
the Middle East regarding the situation in Algeria to deny the 
existence of any holy war and say that those claiming to be war 
veterans were simpleminded. 
  According to the GIA, those trips were sponsored in 
collaboration with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a 
circumstance that does not enhance Nahnah's image among the 
armed groups already accusing him of collaboration with the 
"junta" because he showed too much zeal for the dialogue 
initiated by the CDN [National Dialogue Commission]. 
  So following the contract that Said Makhloufi put out on 
Abdallah Djaballah, the armed groups have now issued a new 
sentence, this one against an Islamist leader because of his 
receptiveness to a political solution. The communique reiterates 
rejection of all dialogue with the government by denouncing any 
member of the FIS "Majlis Echoura" [advisory council] who takes 
part in such an initiative. 
  Is that the real reason for the failure of the arrangement 
between Zeroual and the imprisoned Islamist leaders? According 
to the office of the president, Abassi and Benhadj delegated 
Djeddi and Boukhamkham to talk to the group leaders and achieve 
a cease-fire, that being the main condition for holding new 
elections as soon as possible. 
  One month after the release of those two members of the 
"Majlis Echoura," there has been no tangible result to encourage 
supporters of that initiative. Even worse, Boukhamkham is said 
to have delivered certain inflammatory sermons encouraging armed 
action and supporting certain group leaders whose barbarity has 
seriously eroded convictions among the rank and file. 
  There are two possible explanations for the lack of desire 
on 
the part of the FIS leaders to keep their promise. The first has 
to do with what the "boarders" at Blida Prison really want. Do 
they want calm to be restored as long as they are in prison? The 
content of the letter sent by Ali Benhadj to Chebouti, in which 
he promised to place himself at the latter's disposal upon being 
released from prison--a letter that got his lawyer Touati a 
three-year prison term for smuggling it out--stuns those who 
think there is a difference between the FIS' politicians and its 
armed branch, whether that be the MIA [Armed Islamic Movement], 
the HDI [Haraket addawla al islamiya], or even the GIA. 
  That multiplication of acronyms, which serves only to 
appease 
leadership ambitions and conceal sometimes bloody internal 
struggles and squabbling among cliques, must not make us lose 
sight of the fact that the methods, strategy, and objectives are 
the same. Rejection of any idea of dialogue with the government, 
rejection of any possible truce before the pure and simple 
abdication of all those governing today, and trials for everyone 
who participated in one way or another in interrupting the 
electoral process are constants in every communication from the 
armed groups, whether over the illegal radio station Wafa, in 
the publications they issue in Europe thanks to their 
intermediaries there, or the posters they put up on the walls of 
mosques. What is the reason for the promise made to Zeroual to 
halt terrorist acts--a promise implying tacit agreement to 
participate in dialogue? Does it mean that the minister of 
defense possesses a sufficiently persuasive gift of gab to make 
Abassi and Benhadj go back on their word somewhere? The reasons 
for all this might be found in the things that have been 
successively left unsaid. Beginning with the CDN, which had 
managed to convince everyone that the FIS would participate 
through Hachani, for just a few hours, in the opening session of 
the national conference, thus spicing up a meeting that was 
promising to be dull. And also the office of the president, 
which first contradicts remarks made by the party leaders and 
then confirms them in a statement by its spokesman. There is no 
assurance that the story of the meeting between Zeroual and the 
shaykhs will someday be written. 
  The second explanation for what the office of the president 
discreetly calls "nonimplementation of the promises made to 
date" may be that the FIS leaders are in fact incapable of 
controlling armed groups that deny them any authority over young 
and bloodthirsty amirs who suffer no doubts. 
  However, there is still that murderous sound bite by Abassi 
in his heyday, when he told the crowds astounded by laser 
technology that: "I will turn my men loose on your tanks, and 
they will eat them!" His statement showed that he already had 
troops prepared for any eventuality and able to go from civil 
disobedience to armed insurrection and that that army was simply 
waiting for word from him--in other words, that he had 
sufficient influence over the "Afghans" and the people he had 
sent to join the pro-Iranian Lebanese Hezbollah in the Bekaa 
Valley--and, last, that Chebouti was being exhibited at 
political rallies by the FIS president as a postmortem surety 
for armed Islamism in Algeria as incarnated by the Bouyali 
symbol. All those factors tend to prove that Abassi and Benhadj 
have influence over the armed groups, but there is a discrepancy 
between what someone like Makhloufi or Redjam says and the 
promise by the FIS leaders as announced by Bensalah during the 
national conference and confirmed a few days later by Mihoubi in 
the statement by the office of the president. 
  Does this indicate a tactical division of labor between 
Islamist politicians and the Islamist military or--as is more 
likely--an undeclared challenge to the authority of the shaykhs? 
Beyond all those questions about whether Abassi and Benhadj are 
capable of halting the terrorist acts, there is another question 
that is of the greatest interest to observers: what are they 
going to be offered in return?

<F P=106> [Article by Rachid Drif: "The Morals of the GIA"] </F>
  [Text] The files of the security services are overflowing 
with photographs that would have seemed surrealistic in other 
times. Dozens and dozens of photographs from investigations that 
will certainly never be made public. Pictures that no newspaper 
will ever publish. Men by the dozen decapitated, their throats 
slit like animals, covered with knife wounds, and with 
terrifying looks on their faces. Soldiers, police officers, 
government employees, foreigners, and citizens with their 
throats slit or their heads cut off to glorify religion and be 
absolved of past sins. It is "jihad": holy war seen by the amirs 
of the GIA [Armed Islamic Group] as a way of saving the Algerian 
people from worse calamities--a way of remaining faithful to the 
principles of the leaders of the Islamic Front and obeying the 
new scholars of religion who issue fatwas without ever dirtying 
their own hands. 
  It is those anonymous dead, whose names are being added 
every 
day to quickly forgotten lists, whom many Algerians--passive 
accomplices--know nothing about. 
<H5>  Islamists and the "Junta" </H5>
  Cherrati Yekhlef, the imam of El Harrach and founding member 
of the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] who is now in prison, is 
still awaiting trial. He was one of the few influential members 
of Abassi's party to have issued communiques calling for calm 
during the confrontations in June 1991. 
  After the second round of balloting in the legislative 
elections was suspended early in 1992, he circulated, through 
the party's channels, one of the first fatwas authorizing a holy 
war using every means, including murder. Members of the FIS took 
the imam's "opinion" to be a party directive, and crime was 
therefore legalized by religion: by Islam. 
  Later, gang leaders such as Allal and Layada surrounded 
themselves with young muftis trained in Algerian schools. Those 
muftis authorized robbery, the murder of relatives and 
Islamists, and then a special rite: the slitting of throats. 
  Religion therefore justified organized crime without 
interference. No known Islamist and no imam, whether a member of 
the FIS or an accredited TV preacher, would denounce the murder 
of innocents and terrorism openly, the exceptions being Shaykh 
Zebda, who was threatened by the armed groups, and then Nahnah 
following the murder of Shaykh Bouslimani. 
<H5>  New Amir </H5>
  Sayeh Attia became the GIA's new leader following the death 
of Si Ahmed Murad, better known as Djaafar El Afghani. Attia was 
born in Ouled Hellal in Medea, his stronghold, in 1956. He is 
one of the 100 or so Islamist activists whose names appear on a 
list included by the National Gendarmerie in a rather unusual 
report. While cross checking general intelligence, the 
investigators--analysts from Darak--noticed something 
distinctive about many former FIS elected officials, leaders of 
armed groups, and virulent Islamists often living outside their 
native regions. They were the sons of harkis [Algerians who 
fought for France prior to Algeria's independence], and a list 
of them has been published in the newspaper EL WATAN. 
  Attia, alias "El Khan," alias "Younes," conducted his first 
big "operation" in March 1993. It was an attack on the Boughzoul 
barracks, and 18 soldiers were killed. Some of them had their 
throats slit. In Tamezguida, 12 Croats were murdered the same 
way, while the Muslims in the group were spared. 
  In Theniet El Had, the governor of Tissemsilt was murdered 
and part of his escort massacred. Attia was wounded during the 
shoot-out by police and gendarmes at the rear of the procession 
who had time to respond to the attack. He was later reported 
dead. To carry out the attack, he had requested assistance from 
two amirs in the GIA, Boukabous in Kedaria near Bouira and 
Kouider Benyahia, son of the "bachagha" of Abadia. The two amirs 
showed up with their respective groups. 
  Attia asserted his leadership and was in contact with 
Djaafar 
El Afghani, who covered the Algiers region while he stayed 
active in his native Medea. He married a 14-year-old girl whose 
father was sheltering the group from Tamezguida. The father was 
later arrested. After Djaafar's death, he became the national 
amir and took over the GIA. According to reliable sources, he 
recently sent emissaries to the leaders of the armed movement 
asking them to swear allegiance to him--the "baiaa" due the amir 
according to religious tradition. Three Islamists were 
contacted: Said Mekhloufi, former editor in chief of the FIS 
bimonthly EL MOUNQUID and head of Chebouti's former MIA [Armed 
Islamic Movement]; Redjam, boss of the front's emergency unit 
that was established in June 1991; and Moussa Kraouche, the 
Algerian Brotherhood's spokesman in France and a close associate 
of Rabah Kebir. They were the "heavyweight" groups in the 
underground FIS, fundamentalism, and the "djazzara". "General" 
Chebouti was not on the list, and his name no longer appears at 
all. 
  There are two opposing theories about him. A few months ago, 
a terrorist was arrested who said that the former follower of 
Bouyali had been seriously wounded, had died from his injuries, 
and had been buried by his next of kin. His grave cannot be 
found. But the security services are not ruling out the 
possibility that he is lying low for awhile and that he has left 
Algeria like Hattab, the man behind Merbah's murder. 
<H5>  From Jijel to Lambese </H5>
  The principal organizer of the escape from Batna Prison, a 
man named Messaoudi, was recently killed. The former head of the 
FIS Executive Bureau and amir of Zana El Beida (between Batna 
and Setif), he and his group had apparently organized the 
operation to free known activists and above all to rescue 
another, extremely dangerous amir. And in fact, the 65 prisoners 
on death row and the numerous prisoners serving life sentences 
did include members of the group headed by Hocine Abderrahim, 
who had made preparations for the attack on the airport; members 
of the group headed by Meliani and Lahrani, who both led the 
attack on "L'Amiraute"; and men convicted in connection with the 
Ksar El Hirane incident, in which five gendarmes had had their 
throats slit. 
  The amir whom the group was intent on freeing was Saoudi 
Mabrouk, who had been active in Kadiria near Bouira. Saoudi had 
lost his legs during an armed encounter, and the nurse who was 
taking care of him at Lambese was taken away by the armed group. 
Condemned to death three times, Saoudi had belonged to one of 
the most dangerous terrorist groups and was responsible for the 
murder of a Gendarmerie squad leader and of police officers in 
Lakhdaria during the events of June 1991 and for the theft of 
several hundred kilograms of explosives in Jijel in 1990. 
  The group responsible for the job in Jijel was one of the 
first MIA groups to be set up following the Mustapha Bouyali 
era. Its members have all made the headlines: Hattab, who has 
been a fugitive for four years; Allam, alias "Amir Nouh," who 
was condemned to death and executed; Bouabdellah, who escaped 
while being transferred from Serkadji to Lambese; Seddiki, a 
serial killer who escaped from the Blida Prison and was then 
killed; and Assameur, head of Tekfir Oua El-Hidjra. 
  Escapees from Lambese Prison were killed in Boumerdes and 
the 
Algiers region. As for the prisoners under a death sentence, 
they seem to have been taken in by Messaoudi's group before he 
was killed. They belong to various varieties and generations of 
Islamist terrorism and are a big danger because they can provide 
a link between tiny groups that have not been in contact with 
each other and have been operating independently.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Mohamed Lamine: "Despair"] </F>
  [Text] Are Algerians--government, citizens, and political 
parties--really aware of the drama being experienced by their 
country? Are they aware of the extent of the tragedy that is 
being joined to their daily lives and claiming so very many 
victims? Are they aware that Algeria is marching resolutely down 
the road to ruin and that we all--all of us without 
exception--share responsibility for the slow death eating away 
at a nation and country that nonetheless has what it takes to 
experience a far happier fate? 
  People are dying in Algeria today for nothing. Most of the 
time, they do not even know why they are dying. Or rather, they 
do not know why they are being murdered, because crime in our 
country has exceeded all possible and imaginary limits of horror. 
  Why must Algerians be sacrificed on the altar of rancor, 
hatred, political ambition, lack of education, and ignorance? 
Why should a girl who does not want to wear the hijab lose her 
life on the pretext that she is not conforming to Koranic law 
when big traffickers and the completely corrupt are 
hypocritically using the precepts of Islam to enrich themselves 
without being disturbed in any way? It must be said that Algeria 
has become the country of every danger with its series of 
murders, attacks, and political intrigues. 
  Some influential circles are doing everything they can to 
increase the deterioration and maintain a situation verging on 
explosion. 
  In the fog and the anarchy, big interests are being 
preserved, and the people, who are suffering and cannot raise 
their heads, must be made aware of it. Otherwise, how can one 
explain the fact that practically everyone is talking about 
"dialogue" at a time when an Algerian is dying from murderous 
bullets on every street corner? 
  The picture is already very dark, and every day it is 
growing 
a little more apocalyptic. At this rate, Algeria is becoming 
more and more like Sudan and Afghanistan. The fall into hell 
seems to be planned. 
  But try telling that to the supporters of "the Islamic 
state." They are bent on using force and terror to try to impose 
a plan for society that is clearly out of step with the 
aspirations of Algerians. 
  As though wearing the hijab would enable Algeria to solve 
all 
its problems.

<F P=106> [Article by Salim Ghazi: "Where Is the State?"; first </F>
paragraph is EL WATAN introduction] 
  [Text] Blida seems to be completely in the grip of 
fundamentalist terror. Panic-stricken citizens have telephoned 
us to say that the atmosphere there is "very heavy"--and that 
most of the girls have started wearing the hijab to "avoid 
problems." 
  One mother told us that "here we feel the presence of the 
terrorists, who look just like everyone else, more than we do 
that of the state." 
  On what does she base such a definite assertion? "I see it 
in 
the faces of my children. My daughter is terrified by the 
thought that if she does not wear the hijab, she will be 
attacked. You know, we are a family of practicing Muslims, and 
we do not need to prove it or to be given lessons in Islam by 
anyone. The only thing is that the atmosphere is one of 
insecurity. One is afraid, and people go along with it." 
  That feeling is shared by other citizens who have the clear 
impression that "they have been abandoned to the fundamentalists 
in the absence of authority." The state is absent, there is no 
authority! Those words are frequently heard on people's lips, 
and not just in Blida, which today is completely helpless. With 
the return of the "leaflets" posted just about everywhere and 
the incendiary sermons being preached in certain mosques, there 
is certainly sufficient cause for the citizens to panic, 
especially since the terrorists' threats are followed by action. 
  Recently, however, it has been noticed in Blida that the 
military have "repartitioned" the city following the removal of 
roadblocks from strategic locations--no one knows exactly why 
they were removed. "Those roadblocks--that military 
presence--won people's trust and deterred the terrorists just a 
tiny bit." 
  "It was precisely when they disappeared that fundamentalist 
arrogance regained ground. This is not right, because the 
citizens have no way to defend themselves from the terrorist 
threat," we were told by an official who does not know what to 
do next in the face of the fear that has taken hold of his two 
children, a boy and a girl. "They have become the stakes for 
people who want to make the situation diabolical, but how long 
is this going to go on?" 
  But Blida is not alone. There are reportedly "hot" 
neighborhoods on the outskirts of Algiers that are experiencing 
the same distress, perhaps with more intensity. In Cherarba, for 
example, the fundamentalists have pushed their zeal to the point 
of forbidding the citizens to listen to the radio or watch TV. 
  There again, leaflets are posted announcing that wearing the 
hijab is compulsory, but also calling for the murder of 
intellectuals. "They want to rule our lives. They are the ones 
giving the orders, and soon they will be coming into homes to 
say what we must or must not eat. As far as educated individuals 
are concerned, it is natural that the fundamentalists would want 
to kill them: when one is ignorant and uneducated, one gets 
frustrated in the presence of those who possess knowledge. 
  "So to lessen one's frustration, one must kill them, and 
that 
is what is happening." The person who told us that feels an 
anger that he has trouble controlling. A family man with five 
children, he lives in a modest three-room apartment. 
  He is furious at "not being able to do anything" about the 
gang of bastards that is able to terrorize defenseless people 
because it is armed. "Do we have to arm ourselves now to defend 
ourselves and save the country from this fundamentalist plague?" 
he asks. 
  That is a question running through the minds of many 
Algerians who have had enough of standing by helplessly in the 
face of the current carnage. "They kill, they burn our fathers, 
brothers, mothers, and children, and we say nothing. This is 
unbearable; Algerians are not made that way, and they must not 
be buried too soon." 
  So what is to be done in the face of that panic in the 
population, which does not understand why the authority of the 
state is no longer exercised severely and in a more powerful 
manner? 
  It is true that the security services are doing all they can 
to protect the citizens and leaving many victims behind, but 
people have the feeling that there has been a sort of 
"slackening off" in the antiterrorist struggle or that the plan 
of action as organized has become insufficient in the face of 
the rising fundamentalist peril. "There are no longer any 
patrols or police sweeps. What is happening?" one girl asked us. 
  On that subject, it should be recalled that a second 
security 
plan was to have gone into effect two or three months ago, but 
that it has been delayed for unknown reasons. 
  Among other things, it called for constant police sweeps in 
"hot" neighborhoods, the massive presence of security forces in 
the streets, the interrogation of anyone suspected of complicity 
with terrorist fundamentalists (Afghan uniforms), and, above 
all, the use of security agents recently trained for 
antiterrorist operations. 
  Incidentally, the month of Ramadan has been exploited to the 
hilt by the fundamentalists, who have launched an all-out "holy 
war." 
  A fatwa was even issued exempting the terrorists from the 
obligation to fast. The month has been a bloody one, a fact that 
has not been lost on the authorities. They will soon introduce 
new security measures to reassure the citizens. The few days 
left before Aid are likely to be very hard on everyone. We must 
remain vigilant.

<F P=106> [Article by Salim Ghazi: "Terrorism: The Women It Kills"; </F>
first paragraph is EL WATAN introduction] 
  [Text] At a time when all the women in the world are 
celebrating their day on 8 March, Algerian women are unable to 
dry their tears or separate themselves from the bereavement they 
have been feeling for over two years. Murderous bullets snatch 
husbands, sons, brothers, or fathers from them in the daily 
violence. In Algeria today, as in Kabul, Afghanistan, women 
cannot properly celebrate their day because dozens of their 
sisters are being raped and killed by terrorists. 
  The list of victims is a long one, and the story of their 
tragedies is terrifying. Since the criminal attack that took the 
life of Mrs. Bougtache and her husband, a police captain, in 
Algiers' Notre Dame de l'Afrique district on 17 November 1992, 
the list of women being killed every day by murderous bullets 
has been growing steadily longer. 
  On 1 April of last year, in the very center of the main 
thoroughfare in Belouizdad, a 30-year-old dressmaker named Zahia 
was kidnapped from her home by a group of armed individuals. 
Some time thereafter, her kidnappers let her go after having 
subjected her to the worst humiliations. Six days later, 
terrorists struck violently in Eucalyptus. A girl employed in 
the company benefit office at the DGSN [Directorate General of 
National Security] was killed in front of her home. Named Karima 
Belhadj, she was only 17 years old. She had been engaged for 
over a year and was planning to be married within a few months. 
  On 18 May of the same year, this time in Bouira in the Maala 
region, an armed group consisting of about 10 individuals broke 
into the home of an imam. Unable to find the person they were 
looking for, the terrorists collectively raped the imam's wife. 
Despite the trauma, the woman told her husband about the horror 
she had just experienced. He immediately lodged a complaint. At 
0200 on 7 July 1993, a group of armed individuals broke down the 
door of a house located in the village of Benkhellil in Boufarik 
that belonged to Saheb Oubelaid and his wife Rachida. After 
killing the husband, the criminals pursued his wife Rachida, who 
had fled with her three small daughters through the emergency 
exit in an attempt to get help from the neighbors, and shot her 
several times in the head in front of her children. 
  A month later, this time in the locality of El Attaf (Ain 
Defla Governorate), the terrorists killed Mrs. Haddad Oum El 
Kheir, a 39-year-old fortune-teller. The victim was five months 
pregnant. On 12 August, another woman, 50-year-old businesswoman 
Allel Aouicha, was killed by an armed group inside her home in 
the locality of Ouled Slama in Blida Governorate. 
  Also recalled is the horror experienced by the family of 
police officer Zermani Redouane in Haouch Gros in the Boufarik 
region last 13 July. A group of about 20 terrorists armed with 
Kalashnikovs and dressed in combat uniforms came looking for the 
police officer. They turned heavy fire on the members of his 
family, killing the mother immediately and seriously wounding 
the two sisters, aged 24 and 20 years. In the locality of Mendaz 
near Relizane on 5 December, two sisters, B. Fadela and B. 
Fatma, were kidnapped from their home in front of family members 
by a group of armed individuals. 
  They were released a few days later after being raped and 
undergoing the worst cruelty. Ten days later in Kherrouba in 
Boumerdes Governorate, an elderly clairvoyant--60 years of 
age--was mistreated and raped before having her throat slit by 
armed terrorists. In Meftah and Larbaa, two cleaning 
women--Meloufi Aicha, 40, and Mansour Yamna, 36--were killed at 
point-blank range by terrorists using sawed-off shotguns. On 25 
December, the mother of a police officer was beaten to death by 
terrorists. She was about 50 years old. On the 28th of that same 
month, another woman, 40-year-old Ikhlef Fadela, had her throat 
slit in Bouira. 
  This year, the terrorists are increasing their ferocity and 
stepping up their murders of women. Last 5 January, for example, 
the sister of a police officer was kidnapped from her home in 
front of family members by a group of armed men in the locality 
of Ain Lahdjar, Ain Temouchent Governorate. She was released a 
few days later after being mistreated and raped. Four days 
later, Mrs. Bouchelaghem Aicha, 47, the mother of nine children, 
had her throat slit by individuals in Sidi Moussa (Blida). 
  On the 23d of the same month, Mrs. Diroueche Mimouna, a 
28-year-old mother of five children, was decapitated in front of 
her family at her home in Frenda, Tiaret Governorate. On the 
same day, this time at the Bouziane estate in Douaouda, Tipaza 
Governorate, a group of terrorists set fire to the home of Mrs. 
Maameri Fatma, the mother of four children. 
  On 4 February, 80-year-old Garmit Kheira was killed by 
bullets to the head after refusing to turn over her savings to 
10 or so armed individuals who had broken into her house at 
night. In Bourouba on the 17th of that same month, terrorists 
used shotguns to kill a mother, 50-year-old H. Cherifa, and her 
25-year-old daughter. 
  In Sidi Bel Abbes the next day, Mrs. Boudjar Keltoum, 94, 
had 
her throat slit by 10 terrorists. Twenty-four hours later in 
that same governorate, a girl named T. Naima was kidnapped and 
then released after being mistreated and raped. On the 21st of 
the same month, when a police officer they wanted to kill could 
not be found at home, three armed terrorists raped his sister in 
the terrified presence of her father at his home in Senia 
(Oran). Three days later, the 72-year-old mother of the DEC 
[expansion not given] in Bordj Emir Khaled had her throat slit. 
In Medea the next day, another woman, 73-year-old Lounis Safia, 
met the same fate. And in Sidi Bel Abbes that day, two sisters, 
G.M. and G.Z., aged 15 and 12 years, respectively, were 
kidnapped and raped before being released in the Tighalimet 
Forest. 
  In Algiers two days later, the principal of a CEM [College 
of 
Intermediate Studies], Mrs. Meziane Zhor, 54, the mother of 
three children, was killed by three bullets fired by terrorists 
in her office. In Gue de Constantine that same day, the wife of 
customs official Hami Boubakr was killed along with her husband 
inside their vehicle a few meters from their home. 
  Bengana Katia, a 17-year-old lycee student, died when she 
was 
shot by a terrorist in Meftah, Blida Governorate. On 3 March, an 
old lady, 69-year-old Hadjou Samia, had her throat slit in 
Tlemcen, while in Blida, Mrs. Bernarbia nee Tebeni Barkahoum, 
44, was killed by a group of criminals who intercepted her while 
she was driving home in her vehicle. 
  Foreign women are not spared, either. Last 5 December, Mrs. 
Ayadi Larissa, a Russian national aged 55 years, was also shot 
to death in Diar El Afia in Algiers. On the 18th of that same 
month, a Frenchwoman married to an Algerian, Meme Afri, was 
killed a few dozen meters from the French Consulate in Algiers, 
where she worked.

<F P=106> [Article by L.H.: "The Reverse Side of Fear"] </F>
  [Text] A huge crowd paid a final tribute yesterday to Ahmed 
and Rabah Asselah at the Higher School of Fine Arts, then 
accompanied them to their last resting place at the Garidi 
Cemetery in Kouba. There were several thousand close relatives, 
friends, students, artists, film makers, theater people, 
writers, journalists, academics, and people of all occupations 
and conditions. The Garidi Cemetery could not hold them all. 
  Sadness furrowed faces that we had previously seen only as 
friendly and welcoming. Weariness could be seen on their 
shoulders. "At every funeral we ask ourselves the same question: 
who will be next?" said one of them. Another person replied: 
"You don't have to ask that question anymore; he is among us 
here!" 
  "As in the case of Tahar Djaout, Belkhenchir, Boucebsi, and 
so many others, targets are chosen on the basis of integrity, 
goodness, modesty, and freedom of thought. Along with the 
bullet's physical impact, the desired psychological impact is 
discouragement, fear, and dispersal. But it is the opposite that 
is being produced." All around us, determination could be seen 
in the hardening faces and the looks exchanged. 
  "We are paying a high price for the freedom to think when we 
pay with the lives of the best among us. History will recall 
that our freedom to meet was exercised first in cemeteries and, 
especially, on a day in March when the stupendous artist Mohamed 
Racim and his wife were murdered," said one intellectual. 
  "It's like shooting clay pigeons!" said one academic. 
  "We are not going to remain defenseless. Fear currently 
exists in only one camp. There is no way that it is going to 
stay there forever. Arm yourselves!" 
  His neighbor corrected him: "Let us arm ourselves!" 
  Ahmed Asselah, a discreet and peaceable man, was not sparing 
in the encouragement he gave artists through his presence at 
previews of art exhibits, photographic exhibits, theatrical and 
movie premieres, musical concerts, and other types of 
entertainment. And everyone from that world had come to pay 
their last respects. But there were also people who had known 
him only by name and others who had not heard of him before he 
was killed but who came to pay him tribute in a show of 
solidarity.

<F P=106> [Article by Mohamed Lamine: "Blida: Terrorism in Daily </F>
Life"--first paragraph is EL WATAN introduction] 
  [Text] For two days Blida has been under the total 
"supervision" of security forces that laid siege to the city in 
order to thwart terrorist designs. Checks and "roundups" have 
become more frequent, and residents have the impression that the 
state is trying to regain control. 
  Is Blida a unique city in Algeria? Here is a city, formerly 
known for its tolerance, which is a victim of intolerance and 
fundamentalism. Here is a city that was one of the beacons of 
nationalism and today is home to certain huge fortunes that have 
become the main sources financing terrorism. 
  To walk around Blida today is to be plunged into a 
nightmare. 
The "city of the roses" is no longer what it once was. Anguish 
and fear can be read on people's faces. For the past several 
months in this city, terrorists have been imposing their law as 
nowhere else, taking advantage of a certain passivity on the 
part of residents, even of complicity by some of them. "Habitual 
criminals," in the expression used by someone who knows the life 
of the city well, have decided that women must wear the veil so 
the women of Blida, with some rare exceptions, obey. It is true 
that they merely wear a scarf over their heads without adding 
the other "ingredients" that would make "Islamic women" of them. 
  This is not the first time Blida has succumbed to the 
fundamentalists' blackmail. 
  For the past month and a half, the city has been without 
newspapers because a letter sent from heaven only knows where 
forbade tobacconists from selling newspapers. These tobacconists 
have not even tried to fight back and obeyed this "order" with 
extraordinary ease. 
  The Moorish baths are, for the most part, closed to women 
because, in the name of Islam, certain individuals decided that 
they do not have the right to use them. 
  Nor have women's hairdressers escaped this exaggerated 
machismo on the part of the fundamentalists. All of them closed 
then suddenly reopened, letting people wonder about the 
fundamentalists' sudden "change of heart." 
  In Blida meat costs 350 Algerian dinars [DA] whereas 
everywhere [else] the armed groups have tried to impose a price 
of DA150 Algerian, unsuccessfully, it needs to be mentioned. Is 
this because certain wholesale meat dealers in the area, people 
wondered, supply funds for terrorism and because the terrorists 
thus cannot saw off the branch of the tree on which they are 
sitting? 
  "Blida is on its knees; the city has been taken hostage by 
the terrorists," a leading figure in the city told us angrily. 
The city is in the grip of criminal groups. These past few 
months the presence of security forces was weak. However, Blida 
has the reputation of being a garrison city. Has the state 
surrendered in the face of the terror imposed by these 
adventurers? 
  Why is there this absence of reaction on the part of the 
civilian authorities and the military command in charge of the 
area? The latter had every reason to make a show of strength 
especially inasmuch as, according to good sources, ambushes were 
sprung on military convoys traveling the road between Chrea and 
Blida, a road that has come under the absolute control of the 
fundamentalists for some time. 
  Is it because these responsibilities were not assumed in a 
normal fashion? According to our sources, certain high-level 
officials responsible for running the city do not even live 
there and barely spend three days out of seven there. 
  This slackening off has resulted in grumblings. There has 
even been talk of grousing among officers who do not understand 
why there is no response when the state has the means to 
liquidate the terrorist phenomenon.

<F P=106> [Article by M.G.: "Republic Organizes To Combat </F>
Fundamentalist `Hydra'"] 
  [Text] The idea of the need to establish a citizens' 
committee for the defense of the republic has gathered more 
momentum since the big popular demonstration that followed the 
assassination of dramatist Abdelkader Alloula. The citizens' 
group that was formed at the meeting last Thursday was a 
committee to prepare for the day-long regional rally scheduled 
for 22 March at T.R.O. Square. 
  Various work groups have been set up to this end, to make 
contact with well-known personalities, associations, and union 
leaders and raise funds to support the event. 
  At a preliminary meeting marked by lively discussion, the 
platform adopted could be summed up as defending the republic 
against the threat of a fundamentalist "parallel state" and 
pressuring state institutions to meet their responsibility to 
defend the citizenry. 
  "Before we are forced to the dreadful point of taking up 
arms," one participant emphasized. 
  Their actions will be aimed at building bridges between the 
elites, prominent defenders of republicanism, and the mass of 
ordinary citizens. 
  There were many proposals to issue calls for international 
action. In that context, the role of the press and intellectuals 
was underscored. 
  Some participants undertook to make contacts with a view to 
reestablishing the committee of intellectuals. 
  To stop the killings, which have become increasingly 
commonplace, to combat attitudes of denial, and to alleviate 
citizen fears, the committee decided at this meeting to make 
contact with numerous leaders of voluntary associations--UNEP 
[National Union of Public Entrepreneurs], UGTA [General Union of 
Algerian Workers], etc.--with a view to collective action and 
mobilizing maximum support from the republican sector. Attention 
was drawn to the fact that many ordinary citizens are demanding 
reprisals for the actions of the fundamentalists. 
  In that regard, several people in attendance proposed a 
national strike, to give republican forces the chance to make 
their voices heard and demand action from the state. 
  On another front, speakers proposed 26 March, when schools 
reopen around the country, as a day for protest against 
mandatory wearing of the hijab, and denunciation of certain 
headmasters and school administrators who acting out of fear 
have forced students to wear the hijab. 
  A working group was created to follow through on the 
necessary actions. Underlined was the need for teachers in 
cooperation with parents of students to take charge of their own 
lives. 
  Finally, the citizens' committee will urge people to start 
preparing for the 22 March regional demonstration in Oran. 
  The idea of a news release is also being developed. 
  The birth of this committee is one contribution from the 
ranks of the republicans. There will doubtless be others in the 
coming days.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Fuel and Tobacco Products: </F>
Increases"] 
  [Text] The prices for fuel at the pump increased by more 
than 20 percent on average starting Monday evening, 7 March. 
  A liter of "super" gas went from 6.50 dinars[DA] to DA8.50 
Algerian and a liter of "regular" gas from DA6.00 Algerian to 
DA7.00 Algerian, while a liter of gas oil (mazout) doubled, 
going from DA3.00 Algerian to DA6.00 Algerian. 
  NAFTAL, the petroleum products distribution company, has so 
far not provided an explanation for these increases, even if 
they had been expected, given the general context of inflation 
and deficit in the national budget. The increase in the prices 
of fuel is not part of NAFTAL's jurisdiction but rather the 
government's, which thought, when the last increase went into 
effect one year ago, that the prices for fuel were among the 
lowest in the world and that we were still far from a "true 
price," all the more so since Algeria, an exporter of crude oil, 
imports certain refined products. 
  For a long time the authorities hesitated to impose the 
principle of truth in prices for fuels all of a sudden owing 
mainly to surcharges for transport and development that result 
from them, further deepening company deficits, not to mention 
repercussions on mass transit fares and thus on overall 
purchasing power. [sentence as published] 
  With respect to the energy sector, an increase in production 
and distribution costs has been seen for some time, while at the 
same time calls by gas station owners for an increase in benefit 
margins, among other things, have been growing. 
  About two weeks ago a movement by service station managers, 
who are asking that this margin be multiplied by a factor of at 
least four, threatened to paralyze the country, but a call to 
strike received only little notice. The rise in pump prices 
should help provide the beginnings of a solution in the 
stand-off between NAFTAL and private managers that has lasted 
several years, it is thought. 
  An increase on the same scale of prices for tobacco products 
also took effect beginning 7 March. Indeed prices for tobacco 
products should increase by more than 10 percent on average, the 
National Tobacco and Matches Company (SNTA) announced yesterday. 
  The SNTA explained this increase citing "new measures aimed 
at increasing benefit margins with respect to production and 
wholesale and retail distribution." 
  The same increase, on the same scale, goes back one year.

<F P=106> [Article signed "K.M.": "Sonatrach: Strategic Redeployment"] </F>
  [Text] With the recent implementation of the new 
organizational scheme for its general management (see EL WATAN's 
issue No. 1049 dated Saturday, 12 March 1994), the national 
company Sonatrach [National Company for the Transport and 
Marketing of Hydrocarbons] has seriously initiated the first 
phase of three of its modernization plan. 
  This modernization process was explained by Mr. Abdelhak 
Bouhafs, Sonatrach's director-general, at a conference, which he 
gave in December 1993. 
  The first stage, covering the years 1992-95, aims at making 
Sonatrach an Algerian petroleum and industrial group having its 
hydrocarbon activity in every direction. This stage aims to 
strengthen the company's basic technical skills and seek 
excellence in these skills. 
  The second stage, which overlaps the first, goes from 1992 
to 
the year 2000. The aim is to make Sonatrach an Algerian and 
international petroleum and industrial group throughout the 
energy field, in chemistry, and associated services. 
  Last the third stage, which will kick off the third 
millennium, should see Sonatrach turn into an Algerian and 
international petroleum group that is integrated and diversified 
in the new skills that have emerged out of the proximity of 
skills such as services, the farm-produce industry, etc. 
According to Mr. Bouhafs, four major phenomena arising from an 
analysis of the worldwide hydrocarbons economy argue in favor of 
such a modernization. 
  He first cited a return to integration, with an upwards 
return by Western companies and a downward expansion of 
activities by producing countries. Second, he noted the more 
pronounced breaking up of the market and the preeminence of 
stock market phenomena in the setting of international prices 
for the resource, resulting in their instability and their 
decrease in real terms. The third phenomenon related to the 
major technological expansion of international companies and 
their refocusing on the hydrocarbon industry. 
  Last, Mr. Bouhafs mentioned an affirmation of the role of a 
relatively recent player in the petroleum world, the petroleum 
group that had emerged from the producing countries. This 
development of the worldwide hydrocarbon industry convinced 
Sonatrach's leaders that an increase in petroleum receipts would 
be more the result of efficiency on the part of the petroleum 
group which, according to Mr. Bouhafs, will have to be different 
from Sonatrach's current organization in its technological 
development and structural and managerial reinforcement. In this 
spirit, the Sonatrach group will be built around three areas of 
responsibility: 


    -  The group level, in which the general management will 
play the role of an industrial holding company. 
  -  The operational 
activities branches level, which is responsible for activity 
management and development. 
  -  The operational base unit level. 
  At the same time these organizational measures are being 
carried out, Sonatrach is continuing with its development plan 
begun in 1992 and that should make it possible, as of 1996, to 
double exports of natural gas, substantially increase GPL 
[expansion not given] and condensate production, and slow down 
the rate at which the production of crude oil is declining. 
  At his 22 December conference, Mr. Bouhafs wondered whether 
the oil market would come up to the expectations of Algerians 
who will have made very major investments to develop and 
modernize their petroleum and especially their gas industry. He 
replied as follows to his own question: "It is widely recognized 
that forecast analysts are influenced by economic conditions to 
the detriment of a prospective move. The last two decades have 
illustrated the implications of such a move: in the 1970's, it 
was the source of investments in the development of costly 
nonconventional energy sources and of excessive diversification 
strategies for the activities and skills of oil companies." 
  "These strategies and programs were abandoned several years 
later, with diametrically opposed goals: now the emphasis has 
been put on technology to improve the use of conventional 
petroleum and gas and generalize their use. (...) This reminder 
allows us not to ignore economic conditions but to generalize 
them. In other words, where we are concerned, we should pursue 
our petroleum and gas development plan."

<F P=106> [Article by Abida Allouache: "A Few Facts About Today's </F>
Algerian"] 
  [Text] Statistics paint a confusing picture of contemporary 
Algerians. They spend more money on food than clothing and 
medical care, but the great majority live in their own homes, 
and overcrowding has reached critical proportions. Most 
Algerians have potable water, electricity, refrigerators, 
kitchen ranges, and black-and-white televisions. While the rate 
of demographic growth remains high, it is beginning to come down 
a little. But do not jump to hasty conclusions: It is not 
because people are having fewer children, but because they marry 
later in life. Marriage is an endangered institution! Housing is 
in terribly short supply, and working women, although highly 
skilled, are a marginal factor in the work force. 
  "A statistical portrait of the typical Algerian" would have 
been too presumptuous a title for this report. First of all, 
because statistics in Algeria are not all that reliable. The 
record of recent development planning shows statistics have not 
always been properly taken into account either. 
  As the country moves toward a market economy, statistics are 
an indispensable foundation for implementation of any serious 
structural adjustment plan. 
  About the best one can say is that thanks to ONS [National 
Office of Statistics], some statistics do exist. They paint a 
sort of picture of the typical Algerian, and it is not 
altogether a portrait of underdevelopment! 
  The first stereotype that must be jettisoned concerns 
demographic growth rate: Algeria, which had an abysmal record in 
this area, with one of the highest growth rates in the world, 
has been making efforts. Whereas in 1985 growth was 3.1 percent, 
the rate had fallen to 2.4 percent by 1992. Could this represent 
the effects of the economic recession that has hit Algerians so 
hard? No, the statistics seem to point rather to a trend toward 
marrying later in life. Indeed, the figures show a veritable 
crisis for marriage as an institution here, with people marrying 
later and later (the average age now is almost 30) in a country 
and society that has always favored early marriage. Today, it is 
not unusual to find single women in their late thirties. 
  The most commonly advanced explanation for this phenomenon 
is the housing problem. Young couples that are married 
legally--on paper, that is--sometimes divorce with the marriage 
never having been consummated because the couple was unable to 
find lodgings. 
  A wilaya-by-wilaya breakdown of marriage statistics for 1992 
shows Algiers led with 13,466, followed by Setif with 6,957, 
while at the bottom end Illize had 77 and Tindouf only 100! It 
would be a mistake to deduce from this that people marry less in 
the South. We suspect rather that the nomadic lifestyle in the 
south is less conducive to scrupulous recording of vital 
statistics. 
  At all events, more marriages were recorded for 1992 
(159,380) than for 1985 (123,688). 
<H5>  800,000 Births </H5>
  Birthrates in Algeria have changed greatly over the last 20 
years. The adjusted fertility rate, or average number of births 
per woman, was 4.5 in 1990. But the absolute number of births 
remains very high at more than 800,000 per year. As for the 
decline in rate of natural population increase, it is too early 
to claim victory. The rate was 2.43 in 1992 compared to 2.41 in 
1991. We will have to wait for figures from the following years 
(1993-94) to see whether the downward trend is going to 
continue, stabilize, or reverse. 
  As of 1 January 1993, total population was 26,600,000. Mean 
projections are 27.3 million for 1994 and 31.5 million for the 
year 2000. (There are low, medium, and high projections.) 
  As for the age structure of the population, 55 percent are 
under 20; the youthfulness of the population is a factor not 
taken into account by those who criticize us for our growth 
rates! Crude mortality is only six deaths per 1,000 population. 
  According to a 1992 ONS national manpower survey of 11,300 
households from all parts of the country, there are 6,221,000 
persons in the labor market, representing 23.4 percent of the 
population. But there are only 364,344 working women--just 5 
percent of all Algerian women. By contrast, 41.4 percent of the 
male population is in the labor market. 
  The figures show women are still marginal factors in the 
labor market, notwithstanding statements or views to the 
contrary in certain misogynous circles. Another surprising fact 
about working women in Algeria is their high level of 
qualification: 22.22 percent of women workers are highly 
skilled, compared to 5.67 percent of the men. This spectacular 
reversal is also apparent in breakdowns by occupational 
category: 47.5 percent of the women are in liberal and 
quasi-liberal professions, compared to 10.74 percent of the men. 
The same thing is true for white-collar personnel: 23.33 percent 
of the women, compared to 9.76 percent of the men. Some 35 
percent of male workers are uneducated or illiterate, compared 
to only 14 percent of the females. 
  So much for the stupid argument that working women encumber 
positions that should go to unemployed males. At any rate, 
generally speaking, a close examination of the job market shows 
that in any given sector the proportion of women employed is 
very small compared to the total. 
<H5>  Employment Low </H5>
  In absolute terms, the number employed grew by more than 4.4 
percent between 1991 and 1992, in other words by 260,000, 
including persons working at home or satisfying their national 
service obligation. Job-holders represent 76 percent of the 
country's work force but only 17.8 percent of total population! 
In other words, only one-fifth of the population is working, so 
that for every employed person in the country there are more 
than five others not working. Despite the youth and structure of 
Algeria's population, the rate of employment thus remains very 
low. 
  The total number unemployed is 1,480,000, 83 percent of whom 
are younger than age 30. While unemployment undeniably hits 
young people hardest, our judgment about these figures must be 
tempered somewhat by the fact that a large part of the country's 
actual economic activity is in the informal or black-market 
sector. And many young people are involved in it. Trade in 
contraband food and cigarettes will doubtless continue to grow, 
and not just because of unemployment. Most young people involved 
in contraband earn a much better livelihood than they would if 
employed in white-collar jobs, for which moreover they lack the 
academic credentials. According to statistics, however, 92 
percent of the jobless are being taken care of by family or 
parents. Long live family solidarity and the extended family! In 
other parts of the world, the jobless are being retrained--or if 
not, they huddle shamefacedly on the margins and try to fade 
into the woodwork. Here, a goodly number of unemployed youth 
strut about in the most stylish jeans and basketball shoes, 
cigarette dangling from their lips, just "hanging out" as 
professional fashion plates--something of a national pastime for 
males. 
  Far be it from us to downplay the anguish of unemployment, 
but we must also recognize that if a survey were ever made of 
the number of hours employees actually spend on the job, one 
would find few Algerians actually work as much as 50 percent of 
their scheduled hours. 
  Whether it is a matter of conditioned reflexes or firmly 
established behavior patterns, most Algerians are not 
disciplined or efficient workers. And this is true at every 
level, starting at the top. Leveling down and mediocrity have 
taken an incalculable toll. Why such negative attitudes? Sure, 
the "system" has a lot to do with it. But that is a story in 
itself! 
  To return to our remarks at the beginning, with statistics 
from the 1992 manpower survey we can paint a portrait of the 
typical Algerian household. 
  Get ready for some surprises: The typical household is in 
owned, not rented, lodgings (64 percent), generally 
single-family housing (a category that includes traditional 
houses). When all types of housing are considered, the most 
typical domicile has three rooms (30 percent), while only 18 
percent are single-room units. Eighty-nine percent of households 
have electricity, 69 percent have potable water, and 65 percent 
are connected to sewer systems. 
<H5>  High Occupancy </H5>
  Some 84.51 percent of households have a kitchen, but only 35 
percent have a bathroom. Among household durables, refrigerators 
are found in the largest number of households (76.8 percent), an 
oven in 69 percent, and a kitchen range in 53 percent. Color 
television is becoming more and more common, now being found in 
32 percent of households. About 62 percent of households have 
black-and-white television. Some type of heating is found in 
57.4 percent of households. Sewing machines are found more 
frequently (22 percent of households) than knitting machines. 
There is an automobile in 17.3 percent of Algerian households. 
  Telephones (20 percent) and parabolic antennas (13.4 
percent) 
are still relatively uncommon in Algerian households. 
  About 5.55 percent of households were described as living in 
substandard housing in 1992, compared to 9.3 percent in 1977. 
Some 16 percent of housing units were rental, and 19 percent 
were rent free. 
  The per-room occupancy rate was 2.65 in 1987, and is close 
to 
3.0 now. According to international standards, overcrowding is 
acceptable when per-room occupancy is less than 2.0 and critical 
when the rate is 2.1 to 3.3; beyond that, overcrowding is 
unacceptable. In Algeria, therefore, residential overcrowding is 
now at a critical level! 
  It is interesting to note that Algerians spend more for food 
than clothing, rent, utilities, and medical care. According to 
the decennial consumption survey for 1988, our typical citizen 
spends 44 percent of his household income on food, 11.5 percent 
for clothing and shoes, and 11.49 percent for transportation and 
communication. Housing and other rental expenses take 5.6 
percent; education, cultural activities, and leisure together 
only come to 6.5 percent. A relatively small share, 3.3 percent, 
goes for hygiene and health, much less than is spent on 
furniture (6.8 percent). Average per capita expenses in 1988 
came to 8,873 Algerian dinars [DA], so that a five-person 
household spent DA40,000. With devaluation of the dinar and 
soaring inflation, you can imagine what the figures will be for 
1994. The ravages must be tremendous!

<F P=106> [Article by Khaled Mahrez: "1994: Tough Year for Algeria"; </F>
first paragraph is EL WATAN introduction] 
  [Text] The first two months of the year were all it 
took to convince Algerian officials to tone down the optimistic 
forecasts they had made at the start of the year regarding 
revenues from hydrocarbon exports. 
  Abdelhak Bouhafs, director general of Sonatrach [National 
Company for the Transport and Marketing of Hydrocarbons], 
announced on National Radio's Network 3 the day before yesterday 
that revenues from hydrocarbon exports this year were expected 
to be on the order of $8 billion, based on an average price of 
$15 per barrel of Algerian crude. 
  That forecast is down sharply from the definitely more 
optimistic figures set by the government in drawing up the 1994 
budget, when it was expecting an average price of $18 per barrel 
and, therefore, export revenues on the order of $9.5 billion. 
That revision of revenue forecasts for 1994 will drastically 
alter the government's calculations and make it necessary to 
draft a supplementary budget to put the state's accounts back in 
balance and hold the budget deficit at the 125 billion dinars 
originally established. 
  Above all, such a level of revenues is going to complicate 
Algeria's financial situation with respect to the rest of the 
world. It had been expected that export revenues would at least 
cover reimbursement of the debts falling due this year ($9.5 
billion). Now that revenues of $8 billion are being expected, 
Algeria finds itself in a very tight spot as far as its foreign 
partners are concerned, especially since the government is 
engaged in tough negotiations with the IMF to obtain new payment 
facilities in exchange for adopting a program to adjust its 
economy. 
  But at the end of last December, during a lecture before an 
audience of diplomats and journalists at the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, Bouhafs had professed optimism regarding an improvement 
in crude oil prices on world markets. 
  At the moment, however, the fact remains that while the 
prospect of a standby credit agreement with the IMF for a few 
hundred million dollars to be used during a transitional 
period--the figure of $800 million is being 
mentioned--represents only a relative injection of fresh money, 
it gives reason to hope for gestures of good will from Algeria's 
creditors. 
  Algeria will then have to negotiate with its "bankers." 
  The fact is that the European capitals have stated, and are 
continuing to state, that they are willing to help Algeria 
provided that it reaches an agreement with the IMF. 
  But that should in no way keep us from taking advantage of 
this breathing spell granted by the IMF to put in place a number 
of mechanisms of a social nature--an unemployment fund and 
unemployment insurance, among other things--since doing so would 
make the effects of the structural adjustment more bearable for 
the most underprivileged.

<F P=106> [Article by Nassim Kouba: "Lowering of Customs </F>
Duties"--first paragraph is LIBERTE introduction] 
  [Text] Mr. Khelifi, director of the Information and 
Documentation Center of the General Directorate for Customs, 
explains the new measures. A package of changes that should 
allow customs to fully play its role in the country's economy 
and simplify procedures for users.... 
  Cognizant of the vital importance of lowering customs 
duties, 
the customs services have opted for new customs clearance 
procedures for users. Elimination of the compensatory tax under 
the new "customs code" should give the system more flexibility. 
  That tax is, first of all, fiscal, duty based, and covers 
unpaid imports. In fiscal terms, the new system will eliminate 
the compensatory tax per se and integrate its provisions 
respecting certain classes of goods into the "customs code," 
customs tariffs, the "turnover tax" (TCA), or the excise tax 
code. 
  The measure providing for integration of the compensatory 
tax 
affects tobaccos and beers. It will also affect domestic 
consumption duties (wines, alcoholic beverages, lubricants), 
surety duties on all items made of precious metals, value-added 
tax on certain products and merchandise not subject to specific 
fiscal measures, and finally customs duties. 
  In this optic, and as a stimulus to the country's productive 
apparatus, a reduction of the tax burden is planned for imports 
of raw materials and semimanufactures, to "oxygenate" 
enterprises and give them the ability to safeguard resources 
needed for economic recovery. 
  Along the same lines, and the better to support domestic 
production, a hike in customs duty rates for products made in 
Algeria will be effected. This modification will also include 
substitution of a specific tax over and above the compensatory 
tax for certain nonessential and luxury products to be listed in 
an executive decree. 
  The move to give the regulations (customs code) greater 
flexibility entails elimination of all obstacles to users and 
makes for better harmonization with international norms, so the 
state is not left to bear the burden by itself. The second 
measure, which is customs-related, will cover updating of 
previous duty thresholds. 
  Its first objective is to increase exemptions from duties 
and 
taxes on changes of residence and on nonresidents; authorized 
ceilings will be raised from 800,000 Algerian dinars[DA] to 1 
million for students and trainees, and to DA1.5 million for 
other nonresident nationals. Also, the maximum value of objects 
in the possession of travelers that may be summarily confiscated 
upon discovery is increased from DA1,000 to DA30,000. These 
so-called trivial items consist of perishable goods and clothing 
articles that customs may give to hospitals and hospices. 
  The old law basically forced travelers to appear in court 
for 
any merchandise exceeding DA1,000 in value, which created an 
enormous caseload for customs officials. The reduction of 
caseload should spare the customs service a great many headaches. 
  The second part of this package will give customs a more 
powerful deterrent against unlawful capital exports and give 
Treasury increased powers to recapture duties. This measure 
would contribute to the fight against unlawful capital flight. 
  It involves extension of the obligatory security deposit, 
hitherto required only for temporary importation of materials 
and equipment for transformation, repair, etc., and for 
temporary exports. 
  This measure was needed owing to constant abuses in this 
domain, with users failing to live up to the terms of their 
declarations. Up to now people enjoyed the use of duties and 
taxes belonging to the state. In effect, the state was 
supporting "one-way inflation." In some cases, products were 
never repatriated; in others, materials themselves were never 
returned. By way of example, some trawlers whose owners had made 
claims for temporary reimbursement never returned to the country. 
  In some cases, trawlers that had been granted temporary 
reimbursement were operating outside Algeria's territorial 
waters without there being any means of monitoring to stop these 
practices. However, this measure will not be applied 
universally, since enterprises of respectable financial standing 
will be allowed to post unsecured bond. 
  Utilization of banking products to execute discount 
settlements under the new customs regime is another example of 
meeting the customs service's concern for increased efficiency 
in handling customs duties. 
  A first new product has already been introduced. This is 
interest on duty credit and delayed interest. Use of this 
product allows the state to avoid bearing real losses due to 
high rates of inflation. It is an effective contribution that 
will help resorb inflation by having everyone contribute. 
  In addition to eliminating unfair competition against banks 
and contributing to better instrumentalization of the market 
economy, the new procedures provide incentives for importers to 
move merchandise out of depot sites more quickly. 
  With regard to disputes over vehicles seized at the border 
in 
cases where they were used for purposes of fraud, the customs 
administration announces it will no longer confiscate vehicles 
automatically, so as not to inconvenience ordinary citizens. 
  Risks of vehicle depreciation, the cumbersomeness of 
bureaucratic procedures, and the desire of the customs service 
to spare citizens unnecessary problems were the principal 
motives behind revision of this statute. 
  The third measure, as previously noted, has to do with 
unpaid 
imports. The first point relates to revision of the list of 
items that cannot be imported or exported. 
  This involves only products capable of effecting the 
Algerian 
market as a whole. It was decided to give domestic enterprises 
the opportunity to get organized before the country makes the 
transition to a market economy. 
  Also, to ensure the country has an adequate food supply, 
exports of food staples have been suspended. The unofficial 
exchange rate, notably vis-a-vis Morocco (1 dirham to 8 Algerian 
dirhams), is a factor that encourages outflow of foodstuffs from 
the country. [sentence as published] 
  Harmonization of customs laws and regulations should help 
protect the domestic economy and achieve a balance between 
taxation and social protection. But it remains to be seen how 
they will work in practice.

<F P=106> [Interviews with Muhammad 'Abd-al-Muhsin Salih, NDP general </F>
secretary and local council head for Asyut Governorate; Husam 
al-Kilani, People's Assembly member for Dayrut; Jamil 
Abu-'Aqrab, People's Assembly member for Abu Tij; Shaykh Ramadan 
Haykal, chief Awqaf Ministry officer in Asyut; and Ahmad Qasim, 
Education Ministry undersecretary in Asyut; by Ahmad Musa and 
Hisham al-Zayni in Asyut, Dayrut, and Abu Tij; place and date 
not given: "Terrorism in Asyut--How Long? They Defend Their 
Negligence!"--first two paragraphs are AL-AHRAM introduction] 
  [Text] Observers of the present situation in Asyut find the 
police alone in confronting the darkness-loving bats of 
terrorism. It is a tremendous weight to bear. The security 
apparatus alone will never be enough to clear Asyut's soil of 
the roots of terrorism or to dry up its well-springs of deluded 
youths, especially among students and teachers. Where are the 
political parties--particularly the majority ruling National 
[Democratic] Party (NDP), with its cadres, parliamentary 
deputies, and People's Assembly members? What role are the 
Education and Awqaf Ministries and preachers playing in training 
mosque imams to counter terrorist ideas? Many other questions 
need to be asked in order to advance the confrontation with 
terrorism, so that all the forces of the people participate in 
it. 
  To begin, we raised the following questions with Muhammad 
'Abd-al-Muhsin Salih, the NDP general secretary and local 
council head for Asyut Governorate: How do the terrorists commit 
their crimes in broad daylight and then disappear? Where are the 
members of 49 local councils, who in Asyut number in the 
thousands? 
  [Salih] Unfortunately no one in the media mentions the 
positive things that the People's Assembly, local councils, and 
the party are doing. Many years ago--in 1987 to be exact--we 
organized the Islamic Meeting Place for Youth. We were able to 
recruit 4,000 students to stand against the extremist currents 
in the university, though these currents had the upper hand and 
strong influence. We expanded to set up 10 associations for 
students from the different governorates. We went to the Student 
Union, which was under extremist control, and battled them in 
1988 and 1989. At present, we have penetrated the walls of the 
university by winning all 40 seats. The clashes with the police 
began when the extremists took to the streets. Their remnants 
have gone into hideouts and the areas of random development. 
  [AL-AHRAM] Then why are incidents of terrorism increasing in 
Asyut? 
  [Salih] The terrorist Islamic Group still has all its 
strength and organizations in al-Minya and Sawhaj; there is no 
confrontation there. It is clear that a mutual understanding is 
evolving in those two governorates about not carrying out 
incidents of violence. As a result, elements of these groups 
flee to commit their crimes in the territory of Asyut, the place 
closest to the two governorates to the north and south. There 
must be cooperation between the groups in the three 
governorates. The Asyut elements direct, harbor, and aid those 
who come to them from the north and south. Their centers of 
operation are the towns of Dayrut, Sidfa, Abu Tij, and recently 
al-Badari. What happened in the center of the city last December 
with the assassination of Brigadier General Muhammad Tu'aymah 
was a reaction to the storming of al-Rahmah Mosque. These are 
the full facts. 
<H5>  Settling Scores </H5>
  [AL-AHRAM] Where is the role of the party and the people's 
assemblies? Why are they absent from the scene? 
  [Salih] The first party secretariat at the national level 
organized a conference last April to study the reasons for 
extremism and propose solutions. Participants included all 
political forces and parties--except the Labor Party--the 
professional associations, the ulema, and intellectuals. Its 
most important recommendation was to form committees for 
reconciliation and education. Their mission would be to move 
among the clans and tribes in 242 villages, because the Islamic 
Group has concentrated on the clans in enlisting its members, 
especially in Dayrut. I admit that the police are battling an 
unknown foe. It was necessary to penetrate these groups and 
reach the second- and third-rank members who were going to 
penetrate the schools. We have resisted them in the elementary 
schools throughout the past two years. 
  We carry no weapons in our confrontation with them, but we 
have turned over numerous repentant leaders of these groups to 
the police. We reached 30 persons and handed them over to State 
Security. Members of the party and the local councils were on 
the scene only 10 minutes after the recent crime in Sidfa and 
transported the victims. We are helping the police. The role of 
politicians and grass-roots figures in Asyut is being denied in 
order to settle scores. Our role now goes beyond the city 
limits. We have committees working in all the cities, towns, 
villages, and hamlets. They provide the security apparatus with 
information. I can reveal some of these secrets. The dens that 
the police stormed in al-Ma'sarah, al-Zawiyah al-Hamra', and 
al-Sayyidah Zaynab were stormed because of instructions and 
clues that came from Asyut. In general, most of the perpetrators 
of the incidents in Asyut were from outside. This confirms that 
it is a governorate that expels terrorism, as evidenced by the 
fact that most of the Islamic Group leaders whom the police 
apprehended in Imbabah, Alexandria, Damanhur, Cairo, and 
al-Minya had fled Asyut in the wake of our activity against them. 
  [AL-AHRAM] People say you began dialogue with some terrorist 
leaders, including Salah Rajab. Is it true? 
  [Salih] The dialogue began in 1992. I received a telephone 
call from the Islamic Group after the police took control of 
al-Rahmah Mosque in Asyut. They asked me for a dialogue. State 
Security did not refuse. I sat with them from 1700 until 1900 in 
continuous talks. The goal was to stop the violence for two 
months in return for certain demands. After these sessions they 
said they would submit the matter by various ways to "their 
brother leaders" who were in prison. They asked for a week's 
delay. However, it stretched on for 22 days, during which the 
incidents erupted. This led to a halt to the dialogue, 
particularly as we had asked them to lay down their arms 
immediately. Incidentally, we are going to reshape party 
formations in any area where individuals prove not to have 
cooperated with information in the fight against terrorists. We 
have begun with the youth secretariat by appointing new 
assistant secretaries. We will combat any passivity. We are now 
inventorying the extremists in every home and monitoring their 
movements in order to confront them. I should say that there are 
about 12 terrorist military wing members in Asyut, in addition 
to between 50 and 200 of the second rank. 
<H5>  Handing Over Terrorist Leaders </H5>
  Leaving Muhammad 'Abd-al-Muhsin Salih, we went to Dayrut, 
one 
of the constant focal points of violence, where we met Husam 
al-Kilani, People's Assembly member in Dayrut. 
  [Al-Kilani] The charge that we have not played a role on the 
scene is wrong. I intervened in 1983 to break up the first 
discussion group held in al-Rahman Mosque. We went with the 
police to break up the gathering after meeting the group's amir 
at the time, Salah Rajab. I published announcements in the 
newspapers asking the members of these groups to repent and turn 
themselves in. I succeeded in handing over more than 150 members 
in Dayrut, foremost among them the amir of Dayrut, Khalid Sa'd. 
  [AL-AHRAM] Why is the violence in Dayrut greater than in the 
other cities of Asyut [governorate]? 
  [Al-Kilani] Social problems and material conditions lead 
young people to join the terrorist groups. 
  [AL-AHRAM] What role have you played in confronting these 
problems? 
  [Al-Kilani] Thirteen months ago I called for a project to 
help 17,000 graduates, 7,000 of them from Dayrut. We made a 
thorough study of 10,000 feddans of desert that could be 
irrigated and farmed. Such projects serve young people who have 
been waiting 10 years for government employment. The Islamic 
Group is trying to enlist these needy youths. They join the 
groups in return for money from which they can pay personal 
expenses! 
  We were not slow to help illiteracy. Many of the guardians 
of 
members of the groups would come to hand over their sons through 
me. Our role as People's Assembly members makes for double 
responsibility between the people of my constituency and 
security officials. I have asked the latter to open the Dayrut 
youth center to young people and move the concentration of 
armored vehicles away from it. This in fact took place a few 
days ago. Nowadays, Dayrut is undisturbed by the terrorist 
operations that flared up two years ago. 
<H5>  Trust Required </H5>
  We went to Jamil Abu-'Aqrab, the People's Assembly member in 
Abu Tij, and asked him: 
  [AL-AHRAM] The charge leveled against you is that you did 
not 
help to apprehend your cousin 'Abd-al-Hamid, the leader of the 
terrorist groups' military wing, when he was charged with the 
assassination of Major General al-Shimi last year. 
  [Abu-'Aqrab] If I see 'Abd-al-Hamid, I will hand him over to 
the police. I will not cover up any person, however close his 
kinship, who disrupts the peace and is a tool to threaten the 
regime. The accused is a fugitive who has not been present in 
the city since the crime in which he participated. Our 
relationship with him is in the name of his grandfather; he is 
not my cousin. All the same, he is a germ that shall be rooted 
out of our family. I am revealing no secret if I say that if he 
got hold of me he would kill me! 
  [AL-AHRAM] But in general you are not among those who are 
helping the police. 
  [Abu-'Aqrab] I think I am one of the members of parliament 
who spend most of their time helping the police, providing them 
with advice and needed information from our various sources. 
  [AL-AHRAM] A dispute is said to have occurred between you 
and 
the governor of Asyut because of your not cooperating with the 
police. 
  [Abu-'Aqrab] Our relations with Governor Samih al-Sa'id are 
good. There is full understanding on all matters. All People's 
Assembly and Consultative Council members feel they are backing 
the police with all the information they possess. None of them 
has ever hesitated in the face of requests by police officers 
involving search for a person, access to his home, or the places 
to which he may have escaped. We are calling for more trust 
between the two sides. 
<H5>  Sympathy with Islamic Group </H5>
  We went to Shaykh Ramadan Haykal, the chief officer of the 
Awqaf [Ministry] in Asyut. 
  [AL-AHRAM] What role has the Awqaf [Ministry] played in 
heading off the extremist current in Asyut? 
  [Haykal] Our role is to immunize people against extremism. 
We 
therefore hold periodic meetings with the people. The ulema meet 
every Monday with people in the mosques to inform them about 
true religion. I don't deny that people at first were 
sympathetic with the Islamic Group. However, after they 
discovered that what they were doing had a purely political goal 
apart from Islam, they broke with them. The Awqaf [Ministry] 
sets down a monthly plan of subjects to be raised in the Friday 
sermon for each town and city. This is done through a weekly 
meeting with the ulema and preachers to agree on the sermon. For 
example, preachers had to deal from the pulpit with the recent 
events in Sidfa and Abu Tij. This is completely different from 
the Friday sermon in other mosques in other cities. 
  We are not hostile to Muslim young people. It is in their 
interest to listen to us, because we know better than they about 
the Koran and Prophetic tradition. Unfortunately, the Islamic 
Group does not listen to what the ulema say. Indeed, when the 
minister of awqaf comes to us, they boycott his meetings. I 
don't know why. 
  [AL-AHRAM] How did the Awqaf Ministry leave al-Rahmah Mosque 
to the control of the extremist groups? 
  [Haykal] Before we speak about al-Rahmah Mosque, we must 
know 
how the Islamic Group took control of it. At first the Islamic 
Group concentrated in the mosque of the Islamic Law Association 
(Abu Bakr al-Siddiq). This mosque, with its lecture hall and 
student lodging, is one of the largest Islamic complexes. Being 
near the university, it became one of the most important centers 
for the Islamic Group. They used to spread out all along the 
road leading from the mosque to the university and took to 
carrying on their activities and meetings inside the Law 
Association [mosque]. When the imam assigned by Awqaf tried to 
carry out his mission, he collided with the Islamic Group. A 
fight broke out between him and the Islamic Group. The Awqaf 
called on police officers for assistance, and the Association's 
mosque was taken back after bloodshed. So they fled and took 
over the privately built al-Rahmah Mosque after expelling its 
imam. When we turned to the police, they told us to leave them 
alone! 
  [AL-AHRAM] Finally, Shaykh Ramadan Haykal told us: 
  [Haykal] Religious education plays no role in the schools. 
The religion class is peripheral. The teacher present in the 
school is not an example for the students--and religion is 
behavior. I am asking for a religious guide in every school to 
whom students can turn to ask about any unclear points in 
religion. The Egyptian people are genuinely religious, as shown 
by the fact that when a child sees his father pray, he does 
likewise. 
  [AL-AHRAM] Education and educational policy in Asyut are in 
the prisoner's dock. Where is the role of learning? Is there 
commitment? Do the schools lack social workers to serve as 
psychological and social analysts to protect against extremism? 
We placed all these questions before Ahmad Qasim, the Education 
Ministry's undersecretary in Asyut, who leveled with us. 
  [Qasim] Asyut witnessed a series of strikes at Asyut 
University in the late seventies. The movement was very active 
in the faculties of education and medicine. The movement abated 
under the pressure of expulsion and rustication, but the 
activities can still be found in the university. Then they 
infiltrated into the schools; they were not from within. We 
therefore assigned a security official in all schools--a teacher 
to notify ministry provincial headquarters of everything 
happening in the school and therefore the people to arrest in 
terrorist incidents, whether they were students or teachers. 
They have not carried on their activities or propaganda in 
school, or we should have known and taken steps against them. I 
have instructed school principals of the need to inform me 
immediately of any violations, even by teachers. Last year it 
happened that two teachers insulted each other during the 
morning line-up. I accordingly took the legal step of transfer. 
  [AL-AHRAM] On what bases are teachers chosen for the job? 
  [Qasim] The school must approve the teacher's honesty and 
integrity. Then the National Security Investigation Bureau is 
informed, so that it can investigate his affiliations and 
determine his suitability; for teachers educate and spread 
values among an entire generation. 
  [AL-AHRAM] Does the ministry's provincial apparatus lack 
social workers? 
  [Qasim] Society has three enemies: poverty, ignorance, and 
disease. These blights must be cured by a comprehensive 
development plan. Since we suffer from these problems, the 
largest possible number of social workers must be provided in 
the schools. Strangely, Asyut's schools suffer an 80 percent 
shortage of social workers. This is the most important element 
in my plan against terrorism and extremism. I also face a 
shortage in the category of social resources and a shortage of 
1,500 teachers in science in addition to my requirements. 
  [AL-AHRAM] How is education playing a role in overcoming the 
rise of terrorism? 
  [Qasim] After the revolution, instances of blood vengeance 
were largely overcome. Intensive meetings were held between 
Azharites, the police, and influential figures in the country, 
and they laid out an overall strategy to treat this social 
custom. In order for there to be similar cooperation in treating 
the phenomenon of terrorism in Asyut, we are asking for the 
following educational plan: reducing class size; abolishing 
double sessions; and splitting up schools with over 3,000 
students. Also, police personnel should cooperate with 
administrations and schools. Security posts should be set up in 
the large schools, staffed by police officers, retired officers, 
or soldiers. Every preparatory and secondary school must be 
provided with a soldier for protection. 
  [Box, p 3] 
<H5>  Illiteracy Plays Role </H5>
  There are 545,000 students in Asyut Governorate and 1,219 
schools with 62,000 employees. Nevertheless, there is a high 
drop-out rate. Fathers merely pay a 5-pound fine if their 
children do not attend primary school, so that they can use them 
to till the ground or do farm work in return for wages that help 
support them. 
  [Box, p 3] 
<H5>  Asyut's Mosques </H5>
  There are 955 mosques with imams and ulema in Asyut. There 
are 1,650 privately built mosques to which preachers for the 
Friday service have been assigned. There are still 300 small 
mosques not under the auspices of the Awqaf Ministry or included 
in its plan. 
  This year, 300 private mosques were joined to the Awqaf 
Ministry. The ministry plays a limited social role through alms 
(zakah) and contributions. It regularly gives about 
100,000 pounds a month to 8,000 individuals throughout the 
governorate.

<F P=106> [Article by Hamdi Rizq: "Asyut: Crisis Between Governor and </F>
NDP"] 
  [Text] In Asyut there is no single reality on which people 
agree. People say that there has been a sharp disagreement 
between the NDP's [National Democratic Party] group of 26 and 
the region's governor, Major General Samih al-Sa'id, in a 
scenario that repeated the crisis of the current interior 
minister, Major General Hasan al-Alfi, with the same group 
before he took over the ministry last April. 
  People are also talking about how the Asyut police now have 
a 
list of the most notorious families involved in supporting 
terrorism, especially the Abu-Sayf family of al-Qusiyah and the 
Abu-'Aqrab family of Abu Tij. Secret reports now call for 
disarming these families of their licensed and unlicensed 
weapons. Implementation actually began in al-Qusiyah among the 
members of the Abu-Sayf family. 
  On the basis of unnamed sources, people hint that the NDP 
still has failed to confront terrorism, despite its village 
grass roots organizations known as committees of 20. Some people 
react to these with ridicule; others ignore them, regardless of 
the stress that the party's secretary, Muhammad 'Abd-al-Muhsin, 
places on them. 
  People in Asyut talk of these and many other things as they 
sit at the Majestic Cafe across from the station. What is not 
talked about there or at the Lu'lu'ah Cafe is anything related 
to the terrorist groups--their number, their spread, their 
various weapons, their recent entry into the university and 
enlistment of a number of its students, and the explosion in 
Bank Square and the Badr Tourist Hotel during the last week of 
Ramadan. 
  Here in Asyut the fire is not only under the ashes; it is on 
top of them and around them, as shown by the mounted patrols, 
the nighttime and daytime ambushes deployed everywhere, and the 
search and investigate operations that allow no one to pass 
without an identity card to serve as a permit. Everyone is 
subject to suspicion until someone higher up intervenes to 
release him. 
  No sooner did suspicious cases begin to increase in the city 
of Asyut, neighboring villages, and the 11 district centers, 
than NDP members began to intervene in every village and hamlet 
to free suspects. They had two motives. First, most suspects 
were from these families, related to these families, or had 
rallied under their banner. Second, primary elections for the 
People's Assembly were close; and these measures, though largely 
successful in preventing terrorists from entering populous 
cities and in keeping them and their activities on the 
outskirts, would have a negative effect on the popularity of 
each member in his constituency if he were unable to have his 
constituents released from police hands immediately. 
  This was how the split developed between many district 
police 
officers in the villages and NDP members from the People's 
Assembly, the Consultative Council, and the local council. It 
was not unusual to find a member of the People's Assembly 
sitting with his family to have suspects released and brought 
back to the villages they had left. 
  Some of them approached Governor Samih al-Sa'id, asking him 
to soften these measures, especially as the security chief was 
also busy with his security plans on which he would make not the 
slightest concession, given last month's rise in terrorist 
operations. These included the recent Sidfa incident and the 
attack on a police car, with the response that killed six 
terrorists. The governor told us that the measure was necessary 
to tighten control and that he was fully satisfied with it and 
in agreement with the security chief on the matter. The measure 
had led to positive results that Asyut citizens now could see in 
the streets. The Interior Ministry in Cairo knew about it and 
had not objected. 
  The other cause of the split was that the governor was 
widely 
reported to have accused NDP members publicly at several 
meetings--despite his good relations with them at funerals, 
weddings, and so forth--of being passive and not having done 
anything against terrorism. Both Siraj Abu-Sayf, the People's 
Assembly member from al-Qusiyah, and Muhammad Ahmad Husayn from 
Asyut stated this. The two are on opposite sides, but both agree 
that the governor is accusing the members of being passive: "We 
ought to have grabbed a machine gun and run after the terrorists 
who are challenging the police! Are we stronger, or are the 
police, with all their weapons and equipment? Our role is to 
educate and help; entering a war with terrorism is another 
responsibility." 
  Perhaps it was the governor's most recent accusation--for 
his 
part, he has utterly denied it, claiming it was a mere 
difference of opinion, nothing to spoil friendship, and that 
they were united against terrorism--that opened wide the door to 
the rumor of a split between the governor and the NDP's 
so-called group of 26. Furthermore, the governor proclaimed this 
accusation in a public meeting with members during the 'Id 
al-Fitr vacation. All of them reacted badly, particularly since 
the governor repeated the charges in his private meetings. He 
even accused Siraj Abu-Sayf of passivity, greatly incensing 
Abu-Sayf, who is now talking to officials in Cairo to discuss 
the matter and settle the disagreement. He asks everyone he 
meets, "What shall I do? Am I to fight terrorism with my own 
hands?" 
  All the NDP members say they are working against terrorism. 
According to Mahmud Abu-'Aqrab, the NDP's youth secretary in Abu 
Tij, the party's 20-member base committees are touring villages, 
alerting the people, and asking them to cooperate. "But not all 
our services to security or to the public are announced in the 
newspapers, lest they become a target for terrorism." 
  The governor told AL-MUSAWWAR in a recorded interview that 
they are trying to portray the situation between him and the 
People's Assembly members as a repeat scenario of the previous 
crisis of Major General Hasan al-Alfi. "However, there is 
absolutely no disagreement. The charges have absolutely no 
truth. I deny it in the press and to everyone. We are in 
complete agreement." 
<H5>  Denial of the Denial </H5>
  The sole fact in the case is that security chief Majdi 
al-Basyuni issued an order for 'Abd-al-Ma'bud Khalifah Abu-Sayf, 
Rushdi Khalifah, Hisham Salih, and Khalid Mursi Salih to 
surrender their weapons as soon as they received the 
notification. They were given 10 days, which ended last 
Sunday--the time these lines were written. 
  According to our information, the first has a semi-automatic 
German pistol. The second has a German pistol and rifle. The 
last has a German pistol. The third has a pistol. Rushdi turned 
in his gun, but the three others are awaiting the results of 
efforts by family head Siraj Abu-Sayf with officials in Cairo, 
particularly as all these guns are licensed and details about 
them are known to the Interior Ministry and State Security 
offices in Asyut. 
  Perhaps this was the beginning of a campaign to collect guns 
from families in Asyut. Major General 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Hilali 
had already collected 60 guns from the Abu-'Aqrab family in a 
single campaign. Strangely, the weapons were returned to the 
family after al-Hilali was removed and transferred on orders 
from Cairo. 
  No one answered our question about why these two families in 
particular. However, there is information that the dangerous 
extremist Murtada Muhammad Khalifah Abu-Sayf comes from the 
Abu-Sayf family. He was on the list of suspects in the events of 
1981. From the second family comes the leader of the military 
wing in Abu Tij, 'Abd-al-Hamid Abu-'Aqrab, who assassinated 
Major General al-Shimi in one of the most serious terrorist 
incidents ever to occur in Asyut. The former has fled to Saudi 
Arabia; the second is still in the center of Asyut. 
  Siraj Abu-Sayf told AL-MUSAWWAR: "We expelled this terrorist 
long ago. Everyone knows that he has lived outside the country 
for more than six years. Are they holding the Abu-Sayf family, 
which has lost two members as victims to terrorist incidents, 
accountable for a man outside Egypt who has not been proved 
guilty of the recent actions? The opposition is the cause of all 
this. The governor listens to them and keeps repeating after 
them that Siraj Abu-Sayf is uncooperative. I am more cooperative 
than any person in Asyut. If police officers, men, and 
detectives now are afraid of terrorism, are we to stand against 
it? My area is completely secure. It is they who are doing 
this--first of all the governor. I won't keep quiet about it. I 
will turn the world upside down. Instead of honoring us, they 
came to take our guns. So how are we to fight terrorism and ward 
off those guys?" 
  He continued: "What's strange is that the MP's [members of 
Parliament] are afraid to talk lest people say, `Are you going 
to cause trouble with every governor?' Fine, and what the 
opposition keeps saying, about there being a repaying of old 
accounts with Minister al-Alfi--how are we to reply to it? I am 
in Cairo. The MP's telephoned me from Asyut and said, `We are 
with you all the way.' I am going to talk to all the officials 
until the problem is resolved and the weapons come back to our 
home. What happened was unreasonable." 
  Mahmud Abu-'Aqrab, the spokesman for the family that is the 
other party to the case, told us: "We turned in more than six 
extremists, including the emir of Abu Tij itself. What more can 
we do? Al-Hilali charged us with concealing 'Abd-al-Hamid 
Abu-'Aqrab. He knows we were the first people who became targets 
of his group. It got so bad that I was shot at in the town. We 
politicians can do nothing but talk, educate, and move the 
masses. If you tell me to pick up a gun and fight terrorism, 
then you are advocating civil war in Asyut. Furthermore, 
'Abd-al-Hamid was on the streets, not hiding in his home. All 
the terrorists are known by name--yet who has taken them? If I 
picked up a rifle, I'd be a terrorist! 
  "Accusing us of terrorism is shameful. We are sacrificing 
ourselves for the country. Everyone is doing it. Shall I or my 
family agree to sacrifice our entire history because of one 
fellow who is an extremist? As for the matter of the 60 guns, 
they were all licensed. They cost one-half million pounds. 
Ninety percent of us are farmers. How can we guard our farms and 
livestock? The rifles are for guarding, not terrorism. They 
can't be smuggled out for terrorism." 
<H5>  Witness for the Prosecution </H5>
  Muhammad Ahmad Husayn is a People's Assembly member for 
Asyut. People classify him as being by himself, apart from the 
26. If the latter choose the right, he chooses the left without 
a thought. He strongly rejected moving through the NDP when they 
contacted him to begin moving at the village level--the ones 
that the governor indicated in his noisy meeting on the second 
day of the holiday, or, as people call it, "the problem 
meeting." Husayn's argument is that such moves serve no purpose 
or goal, especially if they come from executives and if 
executives or even popular figures prepare them. Before any such 
moves, the NDP must be cleaned up. "I said in the most recent 
meeting that the NDP first must be cleansed from inside from 
drug traffickers and previous offenders. Corrupt people are not 
going to fight terrorism. I told the governor to clean up the 
party." 
  The governor told AL-MUSAWWAR that he was responsible for 
NDP 
members and that the party secretary consulted him about 
options. As an example of this coordination, he told us how the 
two together had tried to settle the al-Badari People's Assembly 
seat on the Murad household in an unopposed election as a kind 
of honor to the memory of the late Murad Husayn, the holder of 
the now vacant seat. The governor added that he was completely 
satisfied with these choices because they were in no way 
deficient. The matter had been submitted to everyone: anyone who 
found something wrong should hasten to set it right. 
  The information being handed about is that improper choices 
have been made in the party and that with some village-level 
party secretaries no consideration was given to good behavior, 
ethics, or reputation. One of them in the village of Naj' Sabu' 
is accused of wiretapping the telephone booth in the village, 
like another in the village of Rifa, a third in al-Zawiyah, and 
so on. Is this what Ahmad Husayn has in mind when he speaks 
about cleaning up the party? Perhaps. We repeat that in Asyut 
there is no single reality on which people agree. 
  The chasm between the governor and the NDP members is 
widening--if it is indeed the case that during Samih al-Sa'id's 
entire year in Asyut, Siraj Abu-Sayf has entered al-Sa'id's 
office only three times, after which he decided not to enter 
[again] because the governor was always busy for hours. 
Similarly, Hamid Hisham from Abnub has threatened never to enter 
the governor's office during his tenure in Asyut. Jamil 
Abu-'Aqrab has asked only to be given equal treatment with the 
journalists who go in and out of the governor's office. 
  In fact, while I was interviewing the governor for 
AL-MUSAWWAR, I noticed on his desk two envelopes packed with 
papers from Husam al-Kilani from Dayrut and from another member 
that the two wanted signed. The governor pointed to the 
envelopes and said, "These are requests from [parliamentary] 
deputies. Where are the disagreements about which they are 
talking?" 
  The same scenario that happened with al-Alfi. This time the 
members are not speaking openly about it to the press, but they 
are speaking critically in private sessions. However, when they 
are confronted with it, they deny it. In sessions with the 
governor they turn into butter and honey, and it's "All's well; 
the grass roots committees are working according to your 
excellency's plan." Nevertheless, the split is apparent. There 
is no one in all Asyut who cannot see it. 
<H5>  The Islamic Group? </H5>
  All this is happening now on the bright side of the picture 
in Asyut. As for the hidden side--we mean the 
extremists--according to our exclusive information there are at 
highest estimate no more than 40 extremists to be found in the 
11 districts. Each works in his district without a single link 
or central planning. In particular, the Islamic Group has have 
not yet settled the question of their amir after the recent 
death of Tharwat Hajjaj in Cairo. A virtual struggle is now 
taking place. On one side is the faction of Rif'at Zaydan 
'Abdallah. His police dossier says that he was born on 2 July 
1970 on the 'Abd-al-Baqi estate in Dayrut district. He is a 
student at the Commercial Art Institute. His father was an 
al-Sharqiyah peasant from the village of Bani Yahya, but they 
fled the village because of a vendetta, his father and uncle 
having been accused of killing their cousin, the 
government-employed night watchman. He is among the 11 dangerous 
terrorists whom the Interior Ministry publicized after the 
attempted assassination of Minister Safwat al-Sharif. 
  The other faction--relatively newer--is led by a face 
completely new on the Asyut scene: Najih Mahmud 'Abd-al-Latif. 
He is 35 years old and from Tall Zaydan on al-Badari Island. He 
is thought to be the leader of that area, which is still 
difficult for the police, given his long experience in military 
work. He was a major, but was discharged for belonging to the 
extremist groups. People say that his entry into the terrorist 
team lies behind the recent upsurge in terrorist actions and 
that he was primarily responsible for the 23 February attack on 
al-Badari Island's police detachment, which killed a police car 
driver, Ahmad Hajjaj, and wounded six other members of the 
detachment. The attack made off from the island with 12 
Kalashnikov rifles, a Carl Gustav machine gun, and eight 
assorted guns. The case is now under investigation by the 
al-Badari prosecutor. 
  The rest of the terrorist list includes Salih 'Id 
'Abd-al-'Azim Khalil, alias "al-Sadat." He was born in 1971 in 
the village of Bani Qurrah and holds a vocational secondary 
diploma. His brother, 'Atif 'Id, 30 years old, holds an 
agricultural diploma and lives in the same village. Ahmad Sanusi 
Hilal Jr., 25 years old, holds a bachelor of law degree and is 
from the village of 'Arab al-Jahmah. He is considered by far the 
most dangerous. Police believe that he is probably responsible 
for the Dayr al-Muharraq incident. Mukhtar Husayn Kamil 
Farajallah is from al-Qusiyah. 'Adil Fawzi 'Abd-al-Sami' is from 
Bani Qurrah. Sa'd Muhammad 'Abd-al-Rahim is an expelled high 
school student from the village of Mir. Hasan Khalifah 'Uthman 
is from al-Qusiyah. These ten persons are now moving freely in 
al-Badari, Sidfa (where operations are being led by Najih 
'Abd-al-Latif), and al-Qusiyah (where Ahmad Sanusi is active). 
  Apart from these three districts, we can say that the police 
are now in control of all areas. However, two new developments 
on the scene require a change in security plans. 
  First, the Islamic Group recently have begun to summon their 
members from nearby governorates--from Mallawi in al-Minya, the 
oases in the New Valley, and Tima in Sawhaj. In the recent train 
incident the police ascertained that one of the most important 
suspects was from the village of Salamun in Tima district of 
Sawhaj governorate. Also, the person who engaged the police on 2 
January in the Ibrahim Mosque in the town of Sahil Salim was 
'Abd-al-Hamid Muhammad Hasan 'Abd-al-Majid from Mallawi in 
al-Minya governorate. This somewhat complicates matters now for 
the police and requires that ambushes be set up on the borders 
of Asyut, with increased vigilance, especially at night, because 
the overland linkage of Middle Egypt's governorates makes things 
difficult. Samih al-Sa'id, the governor of Asyut, has therefore 
stressed that the governorates of Sawhaj, al-Minya, and Asyut 
should be proclaimed a single sector in which security plans are 
jointly implemented to prevent the Islamic Group from moving 
freely around Asyut. 
  Second, the Islamic Group have again tried to enter the 
university. Two students were involved in the attempt to bomb 
Bank Square in the heart of Asyut and in leaving an explosive 
parcel in front of the Badr Tourist Hotel. Their arrest within 
24 hours aborted the two operations, but it did not abort moves 
by student members of the Islamic Group in the university, who 
attempted to carry out a strike in support of the two students. 
The university president, Raja'i al-Tahlawi, responded by 
expelling four students for inciting the unsuccessful strike. 
  Finally, a number of facts remain to be mentioned: 
  First, all the differences between the governor and the NDP, 
which certain persons known by name in Asyut are feeding, will 
benefit only the extremists in the end. Therefore a degree of 
clarity and frankness is needed between the two sides. Polite 
visits to funerals and weddings will not be enough to bury the 
causes of the conflict soon; neither will attempts at denial by 
all sides. 
  Second, harassing certain families for reasons known to 
everyone and attempting to drag the police into the problem will 
completely alienate those families from the ranks confronting 
terrorism. If these families do not give their support, they 
will stand neutral; which is extremely dangerous, particularly 
since the decisions have not paid attention to the principle 
that equality in wrong is justice. 
  Third, terrorism is limited to the numerical level of the 
Islamic Group. However, those active on the scene not only have 
considerable fighting experience, but are good at moving. The 
entry of persons from al-Minya, Sawhaj, and the New Valley will 
prolong the battle. It will have to be decisively resolved by 
security integration at the level of all these governorates--the 
one-sector policy that the governor of Asyut stressed. 
  Fourth, Asyut University's current policy of forbidding 
those 
who are the source [of evil] must continue. The picture must be 
clarified as soon as any measures are taken, so as to contain 
any student sympathy with the extremists. 
  The final fact is that in Asyut there is no single reality 
on 
which people agree. This is what a thorough reading of this 
report confirms.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Mahmud Sharif, minister of local </F>
administration, by Majdi Abd-al-Ghani; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] 
  [Sharif] We should all believe that the defendant is 
innocent 
until he/she is condemned. The verdict is the right of the 
appropriate court only. Personally, I say that local leaders are 
honest and, on the whole, make those decisions that serve 
citizens' interests and solve their problems. I appeal to my 
colleagues in the press not to rush in making accusations until 
all investigations are done and judges announce their verdict. 
  When dealing with building violations, we encounter numerous 
and lengthy obstacles. In the latest governors' council meeting, 
we decided to control these obstacles...and eliminate those 
negative trends that put limitations on fighting obstacles. 
These obstacles are: 
  First: As demolishing buildings is an administrative 
resolution, it could only be resolved in administrative courts. 
In the past, those committing building violations could file 
complaints in different kinds of courts in order to be 
acquitted. This process delayed the decision to execute 
demolition resolutions. 
  As the phrase "security does not permit" was an obstacle 
that 
governors and district heads faced and which stopped the 
demolition of buildings for years, I made an agreement with the 
minister of interior to the effect that this phrase no longer be 
used with regard to building violations that have to be reviewed 
by security personnel before they execute their demolition. 
Major General Hasan al-Alfi, minister of interior, promised 
that, starting at the present time, this phrase would no longer 
be used as an obstacle. 
  Moreover, building violations will be changed from 
violations 
to felonies that would be punishable by law. This means that 
culprits, besides paying fines, will receive prison sentences. 
  [Abd-al-Ghani] Where were the local councils during the past 
years when buildings were being erected? How is it that those 
councils have now reappeared demanding--with raised 
voices--quick trials for district heads and district engineers? 
  [Sharif] True, local councils are considered the primary 
instruments for the supervision of district heads' resolutions 
and any permits issued or actions executed by district offices 
which effect the people. Local councils should have spoken up, 
posed questions, and investigated building violations, because 
these councils hold monthly conferences with district heads and 
question them about every big issue as well as every detail 
related to all matters that concern the district. The councils 
should have completely performed their duty with regard to these 
issues. 
  [Abd-al-Ghani] Does this mean that the Local Councils Law 
will be changed? 
  [Sharif] Yes. We will consider seriously the idea that the 
members of local councils take part in both inspection patrols, 
together with district engineers, in order to detect building 
violations, and in reporting these violations. Therefore, local 
councils would be carrying full responsibility with regard to 
building violations, and subsequently, for the people's benefit, 
will play a role in fighting corruption and negligence. 
  [Abd-al-Ghani] What are the bases for nominating local 
leaders? How could this nomination be regularly supervised and 
monitored? 
  [Sharif] In order to nominate local leaders, we have started 
resorting to press ads, in which we allow all government 
officers who have reached either grade-level one, or the 
grade-level of general director, who wish to be promoted to the 
grade-level of under-secretary, to apply for posts of local 
leaders. I attend, in person, the interviews of applicants. 
Those who are selected are required to attend a course in local 
administration and then do some field research. The candidate is 
then given a trial period before he/she resumes the leadership 
post. Subsequently, all through the period when the candidate is 
in office, he/she is placed under our daily supervision and 
monitoring in order to assess his/her adaptability with regard 
to decisionmaking. 
  [Abd-al-Ghani] Why are local leaders left in their posts for 
long periods? Because of their many acquaintances across the 
years, when they have to find solutions for peoples' problems or 
attend to peoples' interests, are they not subjected to 
embarrassment? 
  [Sharif] A resolution has been issued that does not allow 
any 
local leaders, however successful they may have been and though 
they may have had many achievements, to remain in office more 
than five years. This is so that this local leadership would not 
feel embarrassed when dealing with problems and interests of 
those acquaintances whom it might have known for a long time. 
Another reason for this resolution is to renew the leadership, 
in action and in thought, at the local district level. 
  [Abd-al-Ghani] Some hypocrites address the governor as: "Mr. 
Minister Governor." Similarly, some media personnel in the 
governorate write big sign-posts that are placed on the 
Governor's desk having as a title: "The Minister Governor." 
Which of these is right and which is wrong?! 
  [Sharif] A governor should not be addressed as "Mr. Minister 
Governor." The financial status of a governor is the same as 
that of a minister. However, this fact does not mean that a 
governor should be addressed by the title "minister." Therefore, 
governors should not allow anyone to address them by this title, 
because this kind of address reflects flattery and hypocrisy. 
Personally, I do not allow that. All the ministry's 
correspondence with governors does not include this title. 
Governors should observe this regulation and put it into effect 
immediately. 
  [Abd-al-Ghani] How powerful is a governor's endorsement? I 
pose this question because citizens believe that this 
endorsement is the right path to heaven! 
  [Sharif] A governor's endorsement is one that gives the okay 
for execution; it is completely valid. However, a governor 
endorses only those documents that he is empowered to endorse. 
For example, according to local government regulations, a 
governor has the right to allot a percentage of public housing 
at his discretion. However, a governor would first endorse the 
allotment of houses for the rest of the cases before he endorses 
allotments for any special cases. 
<H5>  No to the Oral! </H5>
  [Abd-al-Ghani] What about an oral endorsement that a 
governor 
gives to his subordinates either over the telephone or by 
meeting with them? 
  [Sharif] On the one hand, an oral endorsement is sound and 
needs quick action if it is given for the general benefit, such 
as when the governor gives oral instructions or gives those 
instructions over the telephone in order to repair a damaged 
road or a burst water pipe. On the other hand, the endorsement 
is unsound if it is given by an employee, and the governor does 
not carry responsibility for it; this latter case would be 
unsound according to the work plan and its legal and sound 
venues. In addition, in case the endorsement carries any 
responsibility, the governor must endorse it instantly. 
  [Abd-al-Ghani] Because some previous district heads made 
some 
mistakes, a big number of current district heads have started to 
refer documents that need endorsement to the legal department 
for getting their view in fear of making the same mistakes made 
by their predessecors. What do you think is the solution? 
  [Sharif] I do not deny this truth. However, the local 
leadership should have confidence in its resolutions--and in its 
honesty. This state of affairs has delayed the issuing of 
building permits; currently, this delay has been overcome. 
Self-confidence and confidence in one's country provide district 
heads with complete validity to make the right decisions. 
  [Abd-al-Ghani] Has the cleaning organization for Cairo and 
al-Gizah achieved its goals? 
  [Sharif] Yes. Since the state provided equipment worth 3 
billion pounds, the cleaning organization for Cairo and al-Gizah 
has achieved its goal. Private cleaning (the private sector) has 
a good future in this activity. Resolutions will be issued to 
encourage such companies. Shortly, the door will be opened for 
private sector companies to contribute to other aspects of 
public services such as garbadge collection, its sorting, and 
classification. 
  [Abd-al-Ghani] In case a citizen fails to get what he/she is 
entitled to get from either the district head or the engineers, 
what does the citizen do and to whom does he/she have recourse? 
  [Sharif] Currently, I do not believe that this situation 
will 
occur because, the law is clear and provides every citizen with 
his/her entitlement. However, should this situation occur, the 
Governor's office is opened; governors hold weekly conferences 
with citizens. No citizen will find any difficulty in solving 
his/her problems.

<F P=106> [Article by Hasan al-Chalabi, professor of international law </F>
and chairman of the Constitution Committee in the Iraqi National 
Congress] 
  [Text] The aggression and invasions, as well as the abuse 
of security, human rights, and neighbors performed by Saddam 
Husayn's regime, have placed the Iraqi people and neighboring 
countries in the same ditch. Therefore, the continuing of this 
regime not only causes a threat to Iraq's future, but also to 
the security of the whole region. Also, therefore, ending this 
regime is of vital interest to Iraqis and to the region and its 
countries, as well as to world peace. 
  In spite of this state of affairs, since Saddam Husayn 
became 
responsible for Iraq and its destiny, the Iraqi people have 
received very little help and support from their neighbors 
throughout all the difficult times and calamities that they have 
faced. Had this treacherous and suppressive rule been related to 
the rule of the people only and thus considered as a case of 
Iraq's private affairs and its national autonomy, then there 
would have been a justification for the passiveness. But, there 
is no excuse for Iraq's neighbors; they can provide no 
justification for only being spectators regarding what is 
happening in Iraq--around them--at the time when the Iraqi 
regime has become a threat, not to Iraq alone, but, to all 
countries in the region. 
  The Iraqi regime has placed Iraqis under injustice and 
displacement and robbed them of their essential, as well as 
their most vital rights, such as the right to life, food, 
freedom, dignity, and security. Meanwhile, the neighbors around 
them are silent and see what is happening without offering the 
Iraqi people any help or coming to their rescue. The duty of 
these neighbors dictates that, in such circumstances, they 
should have interfered. However, people living in these 
neighboring countries are different from other neighbors. Though 
the Security Council's Resolution No. 688 verifies that the 
world became aware of Iraq's plight following Iraq's popular 
uprising, the surrounding neighbors remained silent viewers of 
what was befalling Iraq; the neighboring sister-country made no 
move to help or to come to the rescue of Iraq. Similarly, the 
Arab League showed no feeling for either the calamities or the 
disasters that were befalling Iraq. Besides, Iraq's neighbors 
reacted very strangely toward the Iraqi opposition when it 
started to show any practical action to rescue Iraq. Controversy 
arose among the neighbors regarding the Iraqi opposition's 
resolution, when, in the aftermath of the Iraqi invasion of 
Kuwait, it started to perform some coordinated work. It tried to 
control and reach its goals once under the guise of what was 
referred to as favoring enrollment in those branches of the 
opposition that did not carry much weight inside Iraq in lieu of 
those branches that carried much weight, and another time by 
giving either the veto or the right of rejection, with regard to 
its resolutions, to some, not to all branches. This situation 
robbed it of its independence and rendered it unable to 
accomplish the simplest of its missions. 
  This state of affairs was very apparent during the 
opposition's conference that convened in Beirut in March 1991, 
coinciding with the popular uprising against Saddam's regime. 
Those attending the conference--instead of doing what their 
responsibility and duty indicated they should do, such as 
attempting to support the uprising inside Iraq--were busy 
passing around slogans, repeating statements, and racing to 
appear on TV shows and other performances. In another incident, 
when the Iraqi opposition tried to acquire what was needed with 
regard to the independence of its resolutions and plans at the 
Vienna conference, the neighbors marked it as being an American 
agent and as having fallen under the control of the United 
States. If fairness had prevailed, the question of dealing with 
the international factor should have been considered before 
marking the opposition with this accusation so that it would 
have been clear that the Iraqi opposition was doing nothing more 
than other Arab sides when they called on the United States to 
be a guardian and partner in resolving the Middle East dispute. 
Because the Iraqi opposition is in basic need of support coming 
from the United States and the other great international powers, 
it has accepted this aid in ways that do not negatively impact 
Iraq's national and autonomous rights and do not give up any of 
Iraq's national interests. Subsequently, the famous Security 
Council Resolution No. 688 was passed and later on--within the 
Iraqi National Congress--the Iraqi opposition obtained political 
and diplomatic endorsement from the highest levels in the United 
States, Britain, and France. This endorsement represents an 
admission that the opposition is a democratic and multi-lateral 
alternative to Saddam Husayn's regime. It is beyond 
comprehension to consider this admission as both an attack 
directed to the Congress's nationalism and as a belittling of 
its legitimacy. 
  The Western-style military protection that currently exists 
in northern Iraq from within which the Iraqi opposition is 
working to secure liberation--both in essence and in reality--is 
not different from any of the disengagement forces or 
international security forces deployed in more than one area in 
the Arab world. Why should there be two standards of judgment: 
wherein protecting Iraqi Kurdistan from Saddam's regime is 
considered sinful, military protection in other areas is not? 
  When the results of elections for the Congress's structure 
were announced, the neighboring countries stated that these 
structures were not democratic; they were ethnic and sectorial: 
as if this had been done within the framework of either a state 
or a stable government. What is the stand of those who proclaim 
this state of affairs with regard to distinguishing between the 
status of a revolution and that of a state? What would be their 
stand on the preceding cases of constitutional and 
internationally known governments in contemporary Arab and 
non-Arab history which have been legitimized and, though not 
based on elections by the people, were allowed to practice their 
different functions? In order not to elaborate further on this 
topic, it could be said that the revolution jurisprudence is 
based on a coordinated democracy, while that of a state is based 
on a numerical one, where general elections are possible. 
  When it became clear that the Congress encompassed only the 
most prominent of most of the Iraqi opposition powers, it was 
declared in the neighboring countries that it was not 
representative of the opposition because it did not encompass 
all of its branches. This means that unanimity is both possible 
and necessary only for the Iraqi opposition. However, it is a 
known fact that unanimity is very difficult even when it is 
related to jurisprudence; it would be even more difficult to 
achieve, within the prevailing circumstances, when it relates to 
politics. So, in the case of the Iraqi opposition, it would have 
been crucial that the Congress include all of the Iraqi 
opposition parties, which number about 100. In other instances, 
however, it was considered enough to host a tea party in a 
London hotel, have 10 or 15 persons invited, and declare war? 
  Currently, however, the Iraqi National Congress has become a 
reality on Iraqi soil and has an effective presence inside Iraq; 
it has also gained international recognition as has been 
portrayed in the latest message of Mr. Clinton, the American 
President, to congressional leaders (AL-HAYAH, 2 February 1994). 
Ron Neumann, director of the Northern Gulf bureau at the 
American State Department, sent a report to the leaders of the 
Iraqi National Congress in Salah-al-Din, in which he stated: 
"The fact that the Congress is still functioning two years after 
its establishment makes us hope that there are Iraqi 
personalities from the opposition, who, though they have 
different tendencies, yet, after many years, can work together 
for the first time and continue to do so under difficult 
circumstances. We do not want to exaggerate their power; 
meanwhile, others should not exaggerate their weakness. We will 
continue the policy of giving strong support to the National 
Congress and will urge others to do the same." Mr. Neumann 
further clarified that President Bill Clinton's administration 
"approves of the establishment in Baghdad of a democratic 
government that represents all Iraqis and is capable of 
coexisting peacefully with the people and its neighbors." He 
further stated that "the United States is ready to cooperate 
with a replacement government as long as this new government 
abides by the United Nations resolutions." Neumann also asserted 
that the Western allied countries were very successful in 
protecting the Kurds. He added saying: "The United States played 
a leading role in this endeavor. Despite this success, this 
issue is not resolved, and our efforts will continue." He 
further made a clarification by saying: "Washington does not 
have a separate policy for Kurdistan, but has an overall policy 
for Iraq." 
  In view of all these circumstances, it is probable that the 
neighbors will change their stand vis-a-vis the Congress. We 
therefore hope that the neighbors will end their boycott of the 
Congress and accept those necessary relations that will 
safeguard the interests of all concerned parties. Those 
opposition members who are residing inside a neighboring country 
could move to the homeland, where their efforts could become 
both useful and important. Currently, because this opposition 
has no homeland, it remains just a name and a slogan. The most 
important of the Congress's achievements is its success in 
moving the opposition to the Iraqi homeland and transforming the 
region that has been liberated from Saddam Husayn's rule into a 
base for it, thus becoming a reality as well as acquiring an 
identity. 
  When a dialogue is opened with the Congress, those parties 
that carry the Arabs' worries--inside and outside of the Arab 
world--will realize that the Congress is sharing--truthfully and 
deeply--these worries. These parties will also realize that the 
federation that the Congress advocates, which is proposed for 
Iraq, aims to neither separate nor divide, but to group and form 
a powerful and precious unity. They will further comprehend that 
the Congress does not aim to make one party dominate another, 
but that it advocates and works for the establishment of a state 
that will provide equality, justice, and liberty for all. The 
Congress's intentions, aims, goals, and wishes are to liberate 
Iraq form the regime of injustice and treachery and develop it 
on the bases of values, faith, and rationality. The recognition 
of the opposition therefore denotes the recognition of the new 
unity of Iraq--both as a nation and as a people. Therefore, when 
there is reference to communication between the Congress and the 
neighbors, the intention is to bring about the necessary 
coordination between existing conditions in northern Iraq and 
all the neighboring parties surrounding it. This coordination 
aims to alleviate any threat that these neighbors fear might 
arise from the circumstances in northern Iraq and might either 
harm them or harm their interests. All fears, doubts and reasons 
for strain could be alleviated if there is communication and 
consultation between the Congress and these parties. 
  It is most probable that had this kind of coordination taken 
place at the right time, the bloody encounters and shelling that 
caused a number of deaths and a lot of damage would not have 
taken place. Besides, had this coordination taken place, there 
would not have been an empty seat in the tripartite meetings 
that were held from time to time in a neighboring country and 
dealt with Iraqi affairs and worries. How could a country's 
affairs be discussed in the absence of its people? It is 
understandable that those who held such meetings did not invite 
members of the dominating regime to their meetings, yet, what 
reasons could hinder the invitation of the Iraqi people, 
represented by the liberation movement, to these meetings? Is 
inviting the representatives of the people not a required 
legitimate action and one that serves the interests of both the 
Iraqi people and the neighbors?

<F P=106> [Article by Dr. Mordecai Wertheimer: "Russia Returns to the </F>
Middle East"] 
  [Text] Despite Yitzhaq Rabin's declaration in Washington 
that his "shopping basket" during his current visit contains 
only one item, "the pursuit of peace," it turns out that the 
issue of Russia's return to the Middle East political arena took 
up a considerable portion of the talks held by the prime 
minister with the U.S. President and with Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher. In a joint press conference held by Clinton 
and Rabin at the conclusion of their talks, the President 
referred to the issue of Russia's return to the Middle East and 
noted, "We will be able to evaluate her intentions in the coming 
days and weeks by her behavior." What that remark means is that 
the American Government as well as the Government of Israel is 
concerned by signs of active involvement on the part of Russia 
in the peace process, a factor that has thus far not been taken 
into consideration. 
  Last Friday the Security Council voted to pass a resolution 
condemning what happened in Hebron on 25 February. The draft 
resolution also contains a mention of Jerusalem as a part of 
"the occupied territories," as was forcefully demanded by the 
PLO. The United States conducted tireless negotiations over the 
last three weeks with Yasir 'Arafat aimed at linking the passage 
of this resolution with a PLO promise to resume negotiations 
with Israel. Despite Yasir 'Arafat's refusal to bow to American 
pleas on the issue of linkage between the UN resolution and the 
resumption of the talks--and his contemptuous behavior toward 
the American delegation headed by Dennis Ross, who came to 
Tunis--the Americans agreed to bring the resolution up for 
Security Council passage on Friday, in its original draft. It 
turns out that one of the main reasons for the American 
agreement stems from Russian pressure not to further delay the 
passage of the resolution. The Russians even threatened that 
they would act on the matter with or without U.S. agreement, and 
they would not care if the United States were to "veto" the 
resolution. From the Russian point of view, such a "veto" would 
be helpful in their attempts to persuade the Arabs, and 
especially the PLO, that they are returning to the Middle East 
arena with the same mission that they performed in the past as 
the principal supporter of the Arabs in the Arab-Israeli 
conflict. 
<H5>  U.S. Persuasion </H5>
  At the end of the week, senior U.S. sources confirmed that 
they had made a supreme effort to prevent Yasir 'Arafat from 
contacts and negotiations with the Russians on the issue of the 
"peace process" without prior coordination with the United 
States. This was after it was made clear to the Americans that 
the surprise visit of the Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev to Jerusalem and Tunis and the invitation of Rabin and 
Yasir 'Arafat to visit Moscow in the month of April were not 
simply a "diplomatic gesture," but augured a Russian political 
turnaround from her position over the last five years during 
which she dealt mainly with her own internal affairs and was 
only a figurehead on the issue of the peace process. 
  As usual, Yasir 'Arafat felt that this was another golden 
opportunity for him to demand a "price" from the Americans for 
his agreement to delay his cementing of closer ties with the 
Russians. He accomplished that first and foremost with his 
demand that the Security Council pass its resolution of 
condemnation without obliging him to simultaneously announce the 
resumption of talks with Israel. The fact that the United States 
was forced to agree to this demand by 'Arafat clearly reflects 
the renewal of the Russian presence in the Middle East--a 
presence that, from here on out, will demand different table 
rules from those that have prevailed thus far, while the United 
States has been the dominant factor in the Middle East since the 
convening of the Madrid conference at the end of 1991. 
  This Sunday Russia gave another sign of her new policy. When 
delegations from Israel and the United States rushed to Tunis to 
try to persuade Yasir 'Arafat to return to the negotiating 
table, Russia announced that she was sending her representative 
Victor Pozobulkov, the director of the Middle East department in 
the Russian Foreign Ministry, to act as a counterbalance to 
Dennis Ross, the senior American emissary. 
  From the American and Israeli reactions, it seems that this 
change in Russian policy has caught both the United States and 
Israel off guard. In some sense it might be said that their 
reactions to the change proved that they were not only caught 
off guard but that they have been left in a real funk. The fact 
is that 80 members of the U.S. Senate appealed late last week to 
President Clinton to "veto" the Security Council resolution 
should it contain the paragraph calling Jerusalem a part of the 
occupied territories. All of the Jewish organizations in the 
United States, led by AIPAC [American Israel Public Affairs 
Committee], the Israeli lobby organization in Washington, were 
also urgently called to Washington to clearly and firmly express 
their demand that the United States "veto" the Security Council 
resolution. 
  Steve Grossman, the president of AIPAC, met last week for 
this purpose with President Clinton and let him know that U.S. 
Jewry would consider passage of a resolution mentioning 
Jerusalem as "occupied territory" to be a very serious matter. 
Despite the appeals of Senate and House members and the Jewish 
organizations, the U.S. representative at the Security Council 
voted for the resolution while abstaining from two of its 
paragraphs, the paragraph mentioning Jerusalem as occupied 
territory and the paragraph implying that the Security Council 
recognizes Palestinian sovereignty over Judea, Samaria, and 
Gaza. The instruction by the White House to its representative 
on the Security Council to vote as she did is more indicative of 
confusion in this case than careful forethought. 
<H5>  The Invitation to Moscow </H5>
  When Yitzhaq Rabin, during his visit last week to 
Washington, 
was asked about his reaction to his invitation and 'Arafat's to 
visit Moscow in the month of April, he answered that he really 
did not expect it from the Russians, but he accepted the 
invitation. On the matter of the U.N. Security Council 
resolution, the prime minister stated that the inclusion of 
Jerusalem as occupied territory is something Israel rejects, 
"but if it is a matter of one item in the entire process, then 
it is not so bad." Rabin thought that the Americans would insist 
that their vote for the resolution would be conditioned on PLO 
agreement to renew the talks and on implementation of the "Gaza 
and Jericho First" plan. In fact it turned out that the Russian 
pressure caused the U.S. President to change the stand he had 
announced to the Israeli prime minister 48 hours earlier. And 
the United States allowed the resolution to pass without 
"vetoing" it, as she had threatened to do for three weeks. 
  When Shim'on Peres initiated his secret talks in Oslo a year 
ago, containing his "big plan of deception" centered on an 
agreement to "the declaration of principles" with the PLO, he 
based it on the global state of affairs. In that view of things, 
the world had undergone far-reaching changes over the last few 
years. The Soviet Union had disappeared and the Russia that had 
taken her place was not and would not be a superpower. He also 
pointed out that the Berlin Wall had fallen, that the people of 
Eastern Europe had been liberated from the Communist yoke, and 
that from now on hegemony in the world would be exclusively 
American. Since--according to this view of things on the part of 
the Israeli prime minister--the period of conflicts in the world 
was over and peace would soon prevail, Israel had to hurry to 
join in the "new world order" by signing peace treaties with the 
PLO and with Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon at any price. Shim'on 
Peres even loudly and publicly mocked the positions of the Likud 
and his partner in the national unity government, Yitzhaq 
Shamir, who he felt had closed their eyes to the changes that 
had occurred in the global political order and were stubbornly 
clinging to their position that Israel must not agree to any 
accommodation that would deviate from the Camp David accords, 
and certainly not conduct negotiations with the PLO terrorist 
organization. Now the turnaround in the Russian position comes 
as a slap in the face to the Israeli prime minister, proving his 
"vision" faulty and demonstrating the entire structure he built 
to be a house of cards about to collapse. 
<H5>  The Changes in Russian Policy </H5>
  The Russians did not announce the change in their foreign 
policy indirectly or in a roundabout way. They did it in the 
most direct and public fashion. Over the last two weeks the 
Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev has distributed to the world's 
newspapers lots of articles, in which he outlines the new 
Russian foreign policy. There is no doubt that Kozyrev is not 
doing this on his own initiative, but with the authorization and 
encouragement of the Russian president, Boris Yeltsin. In 
articles published in THE NEW YORK TIMES and THE WASHINGTON 
TIMES last week, he sets down Russia's new foreign policy 
principles. At the center of the Russian Government's plan is 
the principle that Russia will no longer concede exclusive 
American hegemony in the world. The Russians say that they were 
and remain a "superpower" just as they were before the collapse 
of the Soviet Union, and accordingly the Americans and the rest 
of the world have to deal with Russia. Still, there is a 
substantive change in the new Russian policy as opposed to that 
of the "Cold War" period, and it is the Russian willingness to 
establish "cooperation" between the two superpowers, the United 
States and Russia. Such cooperation requires the Americans not 
to make unilateral decisions on issues and in areas in which the 
Russians have their own interests. 
  Andrey Kozyrev even lays out the strategic goals of the new 
Russian policy and refers specifically to the present peace 
process when he says, "In the Middle East, our efforts will be 
focused on our continuing role as partners with the United 
States in the peace process and in realizing the aspirations of 
the Palestinian people. We will strive for extensive economic 
cooperation with the Arab states with the aim of attracting 
their financial resources for Russian economic development in 
its modern era and for strengthening the Russian position in 
world trade, including weapons trade." The wording of this 
paragraph of the Russian plan shows that their strategic 
decision is to return full force to the Middle East. 
Furthermore, they stress their desire to return to active 
involvement in the Middle East in all areas, so that the 
possibility of the Russians returning to their function as Arab 
"patron" is very real. If this Russian plan is, in fact, 
implemented, there is no doubt that it will have many 
implications for what is termed the "peace process." 
  If the Israeli Government indeed sees itself responsible for 
the future and security of the State of Israel, it must quickly 
come to grips with this turnaround in Russian policy in the 
Middle East and change its strategy and tactics to meet the new 
challenges that she is thereby faced with. The government's 
running amok after the PLO and its desire to hand over control 
of Judea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip as fast as possible to the 
terrorist organization only shows that the government of the 
left still has not come to understand the change that is taking 
place in the international order in the Middle East as a result 
of Russia's return to the region.

  [Text] The annexation of East Jerusalem to Israel a few 
weeks after the Six-Day War was accomplished unilaterally. No 
country recognized this annexation--just as no country 
recognized the annexation of the Golan 14 years ago--and no UN 
framework gave it its blessing. Legally, these annexations are 
no more valid than the annexation of the West Bank to 
Transjordan in 1950, given the reservations of the entire world 
(except for Britain and Pakistan). Politically, the powers 
recognized over the years that there was no point in an 
immediate clash over Jerusalem, lest it frustrate at the outset 
any Israeli-Arab negotiation. This problem was therefore left 
for the end of the bargaining, but we should not make the 
mistake of confusing this with acceptance of the Israeli course 
of action. 
  In one sense, there has even been something of a retreat in 
Israel's bargaining power with the recognition of the PLO and 
the separation of the discussion over the future of the 
territories from the discussions with Jordan--since the previous 
argument that Jordan, as annexer of the West Bank, had no 
advantage over Israel with regard to the partition resolution of 
1947 is no longer valid when it comes to a permanent agreement 
with the Palestinian entity. 
  The preinterim agreement known as "Gaza and Jericho First" 
is 
again supposed to postpone discussion of Jerusalem to the time 
of the final agreement. The UN condemnation in the wake of the 
Hebron slaughter does not change the timetable, but only serves 
to remind us of Jerusalem's controversial status in 
international eyes. There is no substantive change in the 
situation: The annexation goes unrecognized but also does not 
constitute a basis for a claim of compensation against Israel. 
This is not a pleasant situation for Israel, knowing that the 
day of reckoning is yet to come, but it is also no pretext for 
ridiculous shouts of crisis by the opponents of the Rabin 
government. In the period of the Begin and Shamir governments, 
the political situation of Jerusalem was no better, just the 
contrary--their stubborn policy threatened to bring Israel into 
conflict with her worldwide supporters to such an extent that 
control of Jerusalem itself would emerge from that confrontation 
injured and bruised. 
  No one should delude himself with the idea that the status 
of 
Jerusalem in the final agreement will be identical to the 
present situation. Certainly there will be various changes, both 
in terms of the connection of the eastern part of the city with 
the Palestinian entity (Israel, after all, is not interested in 
the citizenship of hundreds of thousands of Jerusalem Arabs) and 
in terms of supervision over the Christian and Muslim holy 
places. An enlightened policy would be working even now to 
consolidate a complex balance of appropriate authorities for the 
non-Jewish quarters of the city, in cooperation with Muslim 
bodies (Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt and, perhaps, even a 
non-Arab state like Turkey) and others (the Vatican). 
  A pilot test of this balance could be conducted in miniature 
at other sites of religious significance in the territories--in 
Nablus, in Bethlehem and, above all, in Hebron. The idea of the 
Palestinian police force in Hebron is not harmful, even if it is 
not particularly helpful, as long as the Jewish settlers in 
Hebron (and those on their way from Qiryat Arba' to the Cave of 
the Patriarchs) constitute the "time bomb" that Yitzhaq Rabin 
warned about, since the first clash between those settlers and 
the Palestinian policemen is likely to end in human and 
political disaster. The principal significance of this suggested 
police force and of the condemnation in the United Nations is to 
supply a pretext to the Palestinians to do what it is worthwhile 
for them to do in any case--come back to substantive talks with 
Israel in order to win in good time the first slice of the 
autonomy administration in the territories. Following this slice 
there will be others, along with Israeli accords with Syria, 
Lebanon, and Jordan. Jerusalem's turn will be late, but will 
also come to pass--and as Baruch Goldstein certainly also 
understood, what happens in Hebron at the beginning will happen 
in Jerusalem at the end.

<F P=106> [Article by Dani Rubinshteyn: "Either the Settlers or the </F>
Palestinians"] 
  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's decision not to 
evacuate the settlers (for the moment?) from the center of 
Hebron forces the government to maneuver between other 
proposals: to agree to an international presence in the city, 
the nature of which would be a topic for prolonged negotiation; 
or to muster Palestinian policemen to be placed in the city, 
when it is not yet clear whether they will be fully subordinate 
to the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]. 
  In the talks now under way in Tunis, General Amnon Shahaq 
and 
Director-General Uri Savir will probably raise other 
suggestions, the common denominator of which would be insistence 
on what has become hallowed principle in Israeli policy--not one 
settler will be evacuated from his home, even if that home is 
sheer stupidity (in Rabin's words), no matter what the price. 
  This principle has important implications even now in 
Hebron. 
"The end of the week will mark one month since the slaughter and 
the victims continue to pay the price," according to Palestinian 
publications referring to the curfew, that, at the time of this 
writing, has still not been lifted from the city's inhabitants. 
  In fact, the IDF is not strict about the curfew in 
neighborhoods removed from the center of Hebron, but even in 
them there are no classes, most of the services are stopped, and 
few residents go to work. Occasionally the IDF removed the 
curfew for a couple of hours to allow for food shopping, but 
even then the center of the old city remained shut down. Last 
week the military governor of Hebron told the heads of the Arab 
community that the main highway serving the center of town, 
which passes by Bet Hadassah, was closed to Arab traffic. 
  Hashim al-Natshe, the head of the Hebron Chamber of 
Commerce, 
tried to appeal that decision to the governor, and, according to 
him, the governor told him: "this is a final decision and there 
will be no debate about it." The decision will be very hard on 
the lives of the city's Arabs since this street connects 
Hebron's western and northern neighborhoods with the southern 
neighborhoods, and thus now, in their view, makes it a divided 
city. 
  One of the street's residents, Maher Shahada, said (in the 
paper AL-QUDS) that homes in the area have become intolerable 
and that the Arabs will be forced to leave. Other residents also 
believe that the curfew on the old part of the city, adjacent to 
the Jewish homes, will continue for a long time. Businesses 
there have long been dying because of continuous friction with 
the settlers, and those who can will do everything possible to 
move to more distant neighborhoods. 
  The measures taken by the IDF commanders in Hebron are 
understandable. They, like everyone else, fear Arab reprisals, 
and they must provide the settlers a minimum of security and the 
ability to travel. The only way to do this is to impose limits 
on the Arabs and try to create a breach between the Arabs and 
the Jews in the center of town. 
  In other words, because it is clear to everyone that there 
is 
no going back to the uncertain coexistence that previously 
existed in the center of Hebron between settlers and Arabs, the 
decision not to evacuate the Jews means that the Arabs have to 
be evacuated. While the East Jerusalem newspapers describe the 
increasing pressure on thousands of their Arab neighbors by the 
Hebron settlers to leave the area, they also stressed at the end 
of the week reports of two new Jewish families that just arrived 
to settle in the heart of the Arab city. 
  Palestinian spokesmen like Faisal al-Husayni and Hanan 
Ashrawi said after the Security Council resolution that now the 
international resolutions, declarations, and various agreements 
do not much matter to them; what matters is what happens in the 
field. At the offices of the Palestinian delegation in East 
Jerusalem they pointed to the fact that despite the 
announcements of despair among the settlers, some of whom want 
to leave, just the opposite kind of work is going on in the 
territories, which testifies to a strengthening of the 
settlements. 
  In Ma'ale Adumim, in Ari'el, and in other places, 
accelerated 
construction continues. In the most ultra-Orthodox settlement, 
west of Bethlehem, they are starting to build (according to an 
announcement by the Housing Ministry) 470 new housing units. In 
al-Jib (ancient Giv'on), which is north of Jerusalem, the Duqa 
family complained that tractors ran over 12 dunams of their 
olive plantings in order to expand the settlement of Giv'at 
Ze'ev. In areas east of the Jerusalem-Ramallah highway, 
construction of a new Jewish neighborhood is now being completed. 
  A member of the delegation, Rasan al-Hatib, noted a while 
back that the concession made by the Palestinians for the Gush 
Qatif security arrangement actually triples the area of the 
Israeli settlements in the center of the Strip. Hebron is the 
most trenchant example, but from the point of view of most of 
the Palestinian community, it signals that the settlements 
remaining in the territories will prevent any hope of reaching 
an agreement.

<F P=106> [Article by Nadav Shragai: "Tel Rumayda--a Caravan Site </F>
Whose Inhabitants Have Often Challenged the Army"] 
  [Text] The clarifications made last week by IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces] commanders on the West Bank with regard to 
"sizes, weights, and capacities of each of the caravans in Tel 
Rumayda" increased the fears of the settlers in Hebron of 
evacuation, on instructions from the political echelon. 
  Tel Rumayda is the only settlement site in Hebron where the 
inhabitants live in temporary structures. In the rest of the 
enclaves the settlers live in new or rehabilated permanent 
homes, in the synagogue of Abraham our father, in Bet Hadassah, 
or in Bet Romano. 
  At the beginning of the eighties, the settlers in Hebron 
waged a stubborn struggle aimed at settling on the grounds of 
Tel Rumayda, south of the Arab heart of Hebron. This struggle 
has seen endless confrontations with the residents of Hebron as 
well as with the military administration. Once Arab fruit trees 
were uprooted. Other times the settlers tried to fence in 
territory, of which the legal ownership was unclear. Thus it 
happened that on several occasions the IDF soldiers removed the 
fences, and the settlers came back and refenced them. 
  Most of the land on the Tel was purchased by the Jewish 
community in Hebron 150 years ago. Today only a few plots remain 
under Jewish ownership. In 1984 the government authorized 
several families to settle in temporary structures on one of the 
plots. Today seven settler families live on that very spot. 
Settlement on the rest of the plots was held up by the national 
unity government in the mid-eighties. 
  On the western part of the Tel is the ancient Jewish 
cemetery 
in which many generations of Jews were buried, among them rabbis 
and cabalists. The Israeli Government prohibited burials there 
in the first years after the Six-Day War. But in 1975, when the 
boy Avraham Yedidia Nahshon died in Qiryat Arba', his mother 
buried him in the ancient cemetery. 
  The victims of the 1929 riots are buried in another section. 
The cemetery was destroyed by the Arabs after the Jordanian 
conquest and was rebuilt by the Jews of Qiryat Arba'. In 1976, 
remnants of Torah scrolls were laid to rest there that had been 
torn up and desecrated by Arabs in the Cave of the Patriarchs. 
Their location is marked today by a monument in the form of a 
Torah scroll. 
  In a pamphlet put out by No'am Arnon on behalf of the Hebron 
academy, he describes "the large and impressive ancient walls 
from the period of the patriarchs," located on the southeastern 
part of the Tel. "These walls were excavated in archaeological 
digs in the sixties. Further digs conducted on the Tel in recent 
years exposed various finds from the Canaanite period and parts 
of the city from the time of the First and Second Commonwealth. 
On the eastern slopes of the Tel is Ayn Jidira (`the fountain of 
Abraham'), that constituted a water supply source for the 
ancient city. On the top of the Tel is Dir al Arba'in, an 
ancient Crusader fortress, with a beautiful view of the `Hebron 
Valley' and the entire city. On this spot there are Jewish 
traditions noting the graves of Jesse, the father of King David 
and Ruth, the mother of the Davidian dynasty."

<F P=106> [Article by David Shaham: "For Our Future, Not Under </F>
Pressure"] 
  [Text] Begin knew how to say it in Latin: Agreements must 
be honored. When this maxim is rephrased in a different form by 
the present prime minister it makes one nervous. And not only 
because, as a learned colleague noted here last week, he has 
already stated that: "no date (in the agreement) is holy," and 
whoever starts out on that tack would be forced to agree that no 
paragraph in the agreement is holy, but because of something 
much more important--something connected with a basic 
understanding of what an agreement is. 
  First of all, a basic principle in any agreement is that the 
parties to an agreement can agree to nullify all its obligations 
or add to them. There is no restriction in any agreement on 
coming to an additional agreement. Beyond that, what must be 
honored in an agreement is the obligation that you take upon 
yourself. You can cancel your obligation only if the other side 
agrees. But you can always add an obligation that you did not 
take upon yourself in the agreement or nullify a right that you 
have. It is only necessary that the other side not see injury to 
itself in the additional obligation that you take upon yourself. 
  Instead of talking theory, let us take a simple example: You 
agreed to sell an apartment. The agreement says you will hand it 
over empty. For some reason you decide to leave the air 
conditioner and the gas range. Have you broken the agreement? 
No. You are not required to leave the air conditioner and the 
gas range, you simply may do so. On condition that the purchaser 
does not object. 
  Let us consider some examples. Let us talk about Hebron and 
the settlements, and about Rabin. The agreement says that the 
settlements will remain in place until the end of the transition 
period. The Palestinians are obligated not to demand their 
removal before the end of this period. But is it an obligation 
on the part of Rabin not to remove any settlements? Of course 
not. Rabin can dismantle any settlement he wants. True, the 
Palestinians, perhaps, cannot demand it (i.e., they can always 
make demands but are not entitled to have them fulfilled), but 
the prime minister can decide to move them for his own reasons. 
And if Rabin wants to move them and thinks it important to do 
so--he should not say there is an agreement and he cannot move 
them. 
  One more bit of advice for Rabin: Do not say you have to 
move 
the Jews from Hebron because it is impossible to protect them. 
That is not true. It is possible to surround them with a tank 
battalion 24 hours a day and send select vehicle patrols between 
the tanks. It is possible, but is it worthwhile? Does this 
presence justify the price? Is it justified? 
  After all, Rabin himself called the settlement in the heart 
of Hebron "stupid" and said it is a "time bomb." Even before the 
elections he dared to say that many other settlements were 
"political." So, stupid things should be abolished. The time 
bomb must be dismantled on time. The settlement that was set up 
for political reasons can be moved for political reasons. There 
is no need to be confused by the crocodile tears of those who 
cry "transfer" and their demagogy. Transfer is when you take a 
people and send them out of their land to a foreign country. A 
political decision about Jews who were settled in the heart of 
Hebron for political reasons (the chief reason among them--to 
prevent any possibility of peace based on territorial 
compromise) being moved to another place, a place within their 
own homeland, is not transfer. It is simply the correction of a 
political mistake, the correction of a stupid act, the 
dismantling of the time bomb. 
  Returning the Jews from the center of Hebron to somewhere 
else in Israel is not a violation of the agreement with the 
Palestinians. Do the Palestinians object to such a measure? If 
not, it is consonant with the agreement. True, Rabin is not 
obligated to the Palestinians to do it, but he is obligated to 
us; to use an expression with a little more pathos--to the 
future of our children and grandchildren. 
  So enough talk about the moving of Jews from the center of 
Hebron being contrary to the agreement. Gad Ya'aqobi also should 
not say it abroad where they simply laugh at him. Rabin has to 
do it now, not within the framework of negotiations with the 
Palestinians, as a concession under pressure (by doing so we can 
teach them that what is not accomplished by force is stronger), 
but by an independent sovereign decision of an independent 
sovereign state. Not because the Palestinians demand it, but 
because it is good for the Jews.

<F P=106> [Article by Dr. Ya'aqov Katz: "Whither Religious Zionism"] </F>
  [Text] Since the beginning of modern Zionism and, more 
particularly, since the rise of the State of Israel, religious 
Zionism has worked closely with secular Zionism. Mizrahi, 
Hapo'el Hamizrahi, and the National Religious Party [NRP] viewed 
the close ties to the secular Zionist parties as a vital 
commandment to advance the central needs of the state and the 
nation. Despite the differences of opinion on certain matters, 
especially in the religious realm, the NRP was willing to 
compromise with the secular Zionist parties in order to 
establish a constructive national partnership. Even when the NRP 
did not get satisfaction in religious legislation, it continued 
to cooperate with secular Zionism, fully aware that this 
partnership was vital and necessary for the construction of 
government institutions and an exclusively Jewish way of life in 
the State of Israel. 
  The NRP, therefore, cooperated with governments headed by 
Mapai [forerunner of Labor], headed by the Labor Party, headed 
by Likud, and headed by the National Unity government, as well. 
The NRP representatives believed that active partnership with 
the governments of Israel would increase understanding among the 
Zionist camps and strengthen national life in the State of 
Israel. The NRP was able to exert influence in fateful courses 
of events such as on embarking on the various wars, on decisions 
having to do with settlement in all parts of the Land of Israel, 
on central educational, ethical, and social issues, and on the 
Jewish flavor of the State of Israel. Certainly not all Israeli 
governments were happy with the policy lines adopted by the NRP 
in various areas, and occasionally real or imagined crises arose 
between the ruling secular parties and the NRP, but most of the 
time the NRP was a full and wanted partner in all Israeli 
governments and was able to express the desires of the 
national-religious community with pride and resolve from its 
seat in the various Israeli governments. 
  Since the 1992 elections, it turns out that the NRP is no 
longer a desired partner. The secular parties that make up the 
present coalition--Labor, RATZ [Citizens Rights Movement], 
Shinui, and MAPAM [United Workers Party]--have adopted an 
ideological line that collides head on with that of the NRP, 
representing the national-religious community. The parties in 
the government coalition espouse the rights of the 
individual--as opposed to the approach of the NRP, which 
espouses an approach calling for realization of the obligations 
of the individual to people and country. The rights of the 
individual, according to the coalition parties, are divorced 
entirely from his obligations to community and country, while 
the NRP avers that the individual's rights flow directly from 
the fulfillment of his obligations to state and community. The 
contempt that the coalition parties display toward traditional 
religious and social-ethical values stirs up the 
national-religious community and its representatives. A 
significant abyss has opened between the values that serve the 
coalition parties and those that characterize the NRP as a party 
representing the national-religious community. It is now clear 
that anyone who is concerned about all that is dear to the 
national-religious community cannot work together politically 
with the secular parties that make up the present government 
coalition. 
  It may be that the time has come for the national-religious 
community and its political representatives in the NRP to do 
some soul searching to find out whether it is preferable in the 
present situation to exchange the historic partnership with the 
secular Zionist parties for a partnership with the 
ultra-Orthodox parties that are considered non-Zionist and even 
anti-Zionist. It turns out that on purely religious issues there 
is almost full agreement between the NRP and SHAS [Torah 
Observing Sephardim] and Agudat Israel. On educational, 
socioeconomic, and ethical issues there is close proximity 
between the national-religious community and the ultra-Orthodox 
community. 
  The sharp disagreement that exists between the 
national-religious community and the ultra-Orthodox community 
centers on the governmental character of the State of Israel. 
There is also disagreement on central government prerogatives 
such as military service and the drafting of seminary students 
into the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]. These are substantive, 
ethical disagreements, but the sharp disagreements existing 
between the national-religious community and the secular 
community are no less sharp or relevant to the Jewish nature of 
the country. It may be that in serious, rational, principled 
negotiations between the NRP and the ultra-Orthodox parties it 
will be possible to bridge the gap on various governmental 
issues, which would facilitate close cooperation between the 
religious parties to the point of establishing a broad religious 
front. 
  The present emergency requires new thinking and new creative 
measures to produce a unified ethical, social-religious front 
that can stand up to the erosion in education, in values, and in 
the Jewish nature of the country. It is worthwhile to examine 
the possibility of cooperation with the ultra-Orthodox, who show 
greater understanding of the needs of the national religious 
community in terms of settler image and the settlements in all 
parts of the Land of Israel. Recently it turns out that a not 
insignificant number of ultra-Orthodox have participated 
actively in the demonstrations against submission to the Arab 
demands and in support for settlement on the Golan and in Judea, 
Samaria, and the Gaza Strip. It is incumbent upon the NRP 
leaders to open regular channels for negotiation with the 
ultra-Orthodox parties in order to achieve a unified front that 
will stand tall against the secular coalition parties that are 
endangering the ethical, national, and Jewish fortitude of the 
people of Israel in the State of Israel.

<F P=106> [Interview with First Lieutenant Khalid 'Abd-al-Karim Salih, </F>
brother of Kordofan Province Governor, by Muhammad Ahmad 
al-Hasan; date and place not given] 
  [Text] First Lieutenant Khalid 'Abd-al-Karim Salih, 
according to his words, worked "until his conscience awakened" 
as chief of the security and followup branch of the government 
of Kordofan Province, Sudan. He was also the personal guard of 
Kordofan's governor, his younger brother. But he left Sudan 
recently and declared at a press conference in Switzerland, 
where he has applied for political asylum, that he does not wish 
to return to Sudan under the current government. He talked about 
the tragedies he saw in Kordofan and offered a comprehensive and 
detailed personal report on the massacres that have taken away 
the lives of thousands of Nubians. 
  AL-MAJALLAH has contacted lst Lt. Khalid 'Abd-al-Karim Salih 
and conducted the following interview with him: 
  [Al-Hasan] How did you get out of Sudan? 
  [Salih] I left in the company of my sick mother who went for 
treatment in Jordan. When she recovered, thank God, I arranged 
for her to return to Sudan and I headed for Switzerland in 
search of political asylum. At a press conference there, I said 
everything to satisfy my conscience, exposing the ethnic 
extermination and purge campaign launched by the Sudanese regime 
against Nubia's citizens. 
  [Al-Hasan] Your talk about the regime's actions against 
Nubians was based on reports with which you familiarized 
yourself by virtue of your position as security branch chief. 
Did you personally see mass extermination or villages burned in 
the Nuba Mountains? 
  [Salih] We made visits to the field with the governor after 
the operations, and we saw the villages that were burned to the 
ground and the corpses. 
  [Al-Hasan] How many burned villages and how many corpses did 
you see? 
  [Salih] Nearly 200 villages in the Tolshi Mountains and the 
number of corpses ranged from 20 to 150 [per village]. 
  [Al-Hasan] Considering that you are familiar with the 
reports 
on the extermination operations, what is your estimate of the 
number of people claimed as victims of the campaign during your 
presence in the service? 
  [Salih] The reports aren't interested in those annihilated 
but in losses suffered by the army and civil defense. Most of 
the reports call for more military reinforcements to carry out 
these brutal acts. 
  [Al-Hasan] So, how were you able to estimate the number of 
Nubians killed at 60-70,000 people when you were in charge of 
the province security, as you have said in your report to the 
Sudanese Human Rights Organization? 
  [Salih] We received reports at the rate of two reports a 
month. Each report indicated that the number of victims ranged 
from 3-4,000. The reports mentioned no [exact] numbers. So, I 
estimated that the lives annihilated during the seven months of 
my control of the security branch amounted to these numbers. 
  [Al-Hasan] Why hasn't the army objected to these operations, 
keeping in mind that a large number of NCO's are from Nubia? 
  [Salih] As of the first moments of the coup, the Front 
[National Islamic Front (NIF)] cadres began to liquidate the 
armed forces officers and to plant their own men in the military 
intelligence. These cadres started dismissing members of the 
regular forces on mere suspicion. Thus, trust among officers 
has, to a large degree, been lost. Most of these operations are 
carried out by officers chosen from the NIF and from its Popular 
Defense Forces. 
  [Al-Hasan] Were you a member of al-Turabi's front and were 
you chosen for the mission on this basis? 
  [Salih] No, I haven't been a member of the NIF 
organizations. 
  [Al-Hasan] Were you chosen for this task because you are the 
governor's brother? Is the governor himself from the NIF? 
  [Salih] I don't believe that I was chosen just because I am 
the governor's brother but because of the security capability I 
displayed. I was moved from the position of security official in 
Khartoum North to Port Sudan because the regime feared that 
forces loyal to Lieutenant General Fathi in Port Sudan would 
stage a military coup or that a military landing would be staged 
in that province. I believe that my security activity was 
excellent, thus qualifying me to be transferred to Kordofan 
Province. 
  [Al-Hasan] From your security experience, do you believe 
that 
your brother, the governor, was one of the Front's military 
cadres prior to the coup and that he has a role in the schemes 
that are implemented by the Front in the Nuba Mountains? 
  [Salih] This is an extremely embarrassing question. People 
can judge my brother by his actions. All I know about my brother 
prior to the coup is that he was extremely religious. 
  [Al-Hasan] Didn't it occur to you to broach this human 
tragedy with him? 
  [Salih] I did. He said to me that the orders came down from 
the top and that he was powerless to confront them. Lieutenant 
General al-Bashir had visited Kurdufan and proclaimed its 
governor the province prince of jihad [holy war] and himself, 
i.e., al-Bashir, the imam of jihad. Al-Bashir also declared 
1992-93 the year of jihad in Kordofan. 
  [Al-Hasan] How could jihad be declared against the Nubian 
tribes when statistics show that 40 percent of them are Muslim 
and 40 percent animist, and that Christians among them don't 
exceed 20 percent? 
  [Salih] This is something that perplexes me too. I was 
surprised when I saw that their harsh treatment made no 
distinction between Muslim and Christian. I felt tortured when I 
saw children separated from their families and turned over to 
the Islamic Call authorities, even though the children were 
Muslim in the first place. I was pained to see the children's 
families sent to government production [crop?] collection sites 
under those oppressive conditions and in that disgraceful manner.

<F P=106> [Article by Jamal Khashuqji in London: "Accusations Against </F>
Al-Nahdah of Buying Arms and Smuggling Them Into Algeria"] 
  [Text] Is the Tunisian al-Nahdah movement buying arms? This 
controversial question is currently being asked in Western 
intelligence and political circles. Defacto inquiries are being 
made of al-Nahdah's exiled leadership in Paris and London 
concerning this subject. 
  Informed Tunisian sources confirm that Tunisian parties 
purchased arms from merchants in several European capitals, 
particularly in Brussels and Paris, and that these parties 
presented themselves as or intimated their affiliation with the 
outlawed "al-Nahdah Islamic movement" in Tunisia. The arms were 
bought in small quantities and were directed to a third party. 
  However, al-Nahdah's leadershiip firmly denies that they 
purchased arms for the purpose of smuggling them into Tunisia 
and asserted that their movement is political and would never 
resort to violence under any circumstances. 
  One al-Nahdah member who asked that his name be withheld 
said 
that the Sudan expelled a group of Tunisians who adopted the 
policy of "al-jihad," and said that the expulsion took place at 
the request of al-Nahdah, which does not want to bear the 
responsibility for such a trend. 
  The same source indicates that the operation to smuggle arms 
from Tunisia to the Kabylie region of Algeria is for the purpose 
of arming the groups supporting the extremist Berber leader Said 
Saadi, leader of the Rally for Culture and Democracy. Two weeks 
ago in the French newspaper LE FIGARO, Saadi called for arming 
the opposition to the Islamists and forming militias to confront 
the supporters of the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front]. 
  These statements caused an uproar in Algeria; commenting 
from 
abroad, Rabih Kebir, president of the FIS executive council, 
characterized Saadi's remarks as "an open invitation to civil 
war." 
  The al-Nahdah leadership confirmed that the source of these 
weapons was not the Tunisian army's arsenal, rather that they 
were purchased abroad with the knowledge of the security 
agencies in Tunisia in order to achieve two goals: "Firstly, to 
preoccupy Algeria with a civil war when the FIS takes power and 
[secondly,] to implicate al-Nahdah with the charge of purchasing 
the arms." However, Tunisian official sources are insisting that 
al-Nahdah is purchasing arms to use them in terrorist operations 
inside Tunisia.

  [Text] Barely a few hours had passed following the 
"compulsory embrace" between 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid in Amman on 20 February 1994 when battles erupted between 
the North Yemen Army and South Yemen Army, thus giving rise to 
questions on how serious the two sides are about implementing 
the "covenant and accord document," which had been signed by 
Yemeni figures under the sponsorship of King Husayn, and on 
whether there really is a reasonable mechanism for 
implementation. 
  A very resentful Jordanian official has said to AL-WATAN 
AL-'ARABI, "Why, then, did they come to us? Why all those 
arrangements, debates, and mutual visits? Moreover, why did that 
throng of 300 Yemenis representing all of Yemen's tribes, 
parties, institutions, and intellectuals come to us? Why did the 
security and military situation erupt even before the ink used 
by 37 officials to sign the covenant and accord document could 
dry up?" Another official was more realistic and less emotional. 
He said, "It isn't like this. The document isn't a cease-fire 
declaration. It isn't even a declaration of unity. The document 
is a timetable to disengage in the political and economic clash. 
Don't forget that this is the first time in Yemen's modern 
history in which all Yemenis with all their factions have agreed 
to such a broad dialogue. An opportunity must be given to people 
to overcome the obstacles and implement the accord." 
<H5>  Struggle Is Dominant </H5>
  Regardless of what the two officials have said in their 
contradictory assessments, struggle for power and for the 
distribution of positions and wealth continues to dominate 
Yemen's map. Those who scrutinized the face of President 'Ali 
Salih and of Vice President 'Ali Salih al-Bid when they were 
sitting to the right and left of King Husayn during the 
accord-signing ceremony at Raghadan Palace, Amman, were able to 
pick up signs of tension and of dissatisfaction. Even though the 
spontaneous address which 'Ali Salih delivered, (and in which he 
thanked Yasir 'Arafat and the United States!), did not betray 
his fear that the document would face difficulty in 
implementation, 'Ali Salim al-Bid was so frank and so reserved 
that spectators expected him to upturn the table and end the 
party suddenly! Al-Bid declared that he had reservations because 
accords had been previously signed but not implemented. He then 
proceeded to talk about the YSP [Yemeni Socialist Party] martyrs 
who have fallen in the mutual assassinations between North and 
South. Al-Bid went on to list the names of those assassinated, 
and the audience imagined he was about to abandon the microphone 
and depart from the hall. But al-Bid found the right way out 
when he went on to add, "But Yemen is dearer than all of these 
people." 
  From that moment, there has been strengthened belief that it 
will be extremely difficult to implement the document and that 
the path is not strewn with roses but planted with mines. A few 
hours later, 'Ali al-Bid's fears came true when the first battle 
erupted in a border area between units of the Southern Unity 
[al-Wahdah] Brigade and the Northern Giants [al-'Amaliqah] 
Brigade. Sanaa said that the YSP fabricated the confrontation to 
reinforce its presence in al-Mukalla Province, whereas Aden said 
that Colonel 'Ali Muhsin al-Ahmar, commander of the First 
Armored Division and President 'Ali Salih's half-brother, was 
behind igniting the confrontation because of his opposition to 
the covenant. On the following day, a broader and more serious 
confrontation erupted. Thus, the chain of battles and of people 
killed and wounded started. 
<H5>  Far From Modern State </H5>
  A member of the Yemeni delegation in Amman said to AL-WATAN 
AL-'ARABI, "We are tribal and we are still very far from the 
modern state. Even I who sit with you here am tribal despite the 
fact that I have studied in Europe. I talk about dialogue and 
democracy and I defend the counter opinion. But when the moment 
of truth comes, the tribal spark ignites within me and I forget 
all I have studied." When we asked him if he expects the Amman 
accord to fail, he said, "There are dozens of agreements which 
haven't been implemented. We agreed previously. But the 
difficulty has always been in implementation. Despite this, the 
Amman accord is the most important to date. It has a timetable 
and it has dealt with numerous details that weren't tackled by 
past accords. We hope that whenever things get dark--and they 
are dark in our country most of the time--we will seek guidance 
from this accord!" 
<H5>  This Is How Battles Erupted </H5>
  Why did battles erupt and how do Northerners and Southerners 
view the covenant? A Yemeni delegation member who requested that 
his identity not be revealed has said, "Decades of division, 
colonialism, tribal rivalries, backwardness, and poverty make it 
impossible to move to a modern democratic state as fast as 
intellectuals wish. It is a matter of legacy and of entrenched 
concepts. What more than this massive arrival of Yemenis in 
Amman would one ask for? But then the response to those who seek 
unity has been a war declaration." He went on to add, "One must 
acknowledge that our centers of power are infiltrated. There are 
secret hands that strike from time to time and there are divided 
loyalties. Moreover, the mentality of the Northerners who put 
tribe above any party or social consideration is different from 
the mentality of the Southerners who have had contact with the 
British and the Soviets, who have been educated, and many of 
whom have become politicized Marxists." 
  We asked him: "As a Southerner, what is your viewpoint?" 
  He responded, "Frankly, President 'Ali Salih controls most 
of 
the political and military positions through the tribe. His 
immediate family rules Yemen. This condition doesn't please me 
and doesn't please our people in the South. We are more educated 
and more capable of management. Yet, our share of power isn't 
compatible with our capabilities. It is true that the 
Northerners exceed us in numbers. But even by this criterion, we 
are done an injustice." 
  But what about the oil factor? He responded, "You are aware 
that there are vast oil stores in the Southern territories. The 
discovery of this wealth has stirred a sense of injustice among 
our kinsmen, and they constantly wonder if unity with the North 
is in their interest or not. They say that the North, which 
dominates the decisionmaking, is capable of exploiting and 
devouring the South's oil, and they demand a fair distribution 
of wealth." 
  So, you aren't against unity? "No, not at all. We are only 
opposed to concentrating influence in the hands of certain 
people to the exclusion of others. We are against the North's 
devouring of the South. We want an equal unity, not a unity of 
annexation. However, people have to be educated and persuaded of 
the benefit of unity. We are a single people. Our tribes are the 
same and our roots are the same. But we are like two brothers, 
each of whom has grown up in a different environment. When the 
two meet, this environment makes each brother seem to be the 
antithesis of the other." 
  But the document gives you more than what you have had, 
doesn't it? In response, he said, "Even though the document 
seeks to increase the South's share of power, which is our 
right, it doesn't meet all our demands. Despite this, we have 
accepted it. However, the percentage of Northerners who reject 
it is higher than the percentage of Southerners who reject it. 
The reason is that the document takes away some power and some 
influence from the Northerners. The centers of power in Sanaa 
seek to dominate Aden completely. This is what made al-Bid stay 
in retreat in the South for six months." 
  Do you expect the battles to continue? Another Yemeni 
delegation member said, "The situation is very tense and people 
in both parts are very afraid. There are true efforts to defuse 
the situation. But it is very difficult to tell whether these 
efforts will succeed. The issue depends on how sincerely the two 
sides have accepted the covenant and accord and how able they 
are to implement it."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Dangerous to Maintenance of Peace"] </F>
  [Text] India has strongly objected to the U.S. offer to 
provide F-16 planes to Pakistan. Mr. Krishnan Srinivasan, Indian 
foreign secretary, has made it clear to U.S. Deputy Secretary of 
State Robin Raphel that provision of these planes to Pakistan 
will increase tension in this region and endanger security here. 
Prime Minister Narasimha Rao has already said the same thing to 
the U.S. senators visiting India recently. History proves that 
whenever the United States provided large-scale weapon aid to 
Pakistan, these were used against India. Whenever Pakistan 
received weapons in large quantity by becoming member of the 
SEATO and CENTO military pacts, it started its conspiracy to 
take over Kashmir. At that time, the United States had assured 
us that Pakistan will not use those weapons against India. 
Pakistan did not pay heed to it and attacked India using Sabre 
jets and Patten tanks. It is not possible that the U.S. 
politicians are not aware of this fact. Robin Raphel should not 
have any problem in proving this through her government 
documents. Now that the United States is suspending Pressler 
amendment for one year and providing F-16 planes to Pakistan, we 
cannot deny the creation of a very dangerous situation. 
  Robin Raphel told India's foreign secretary that the United 
States wants to initiate the process to resolve the problems 
between the two countries and welcomes the talks held between he 
two countries last January. So far so good, however, the United 
States is thinking about suspending the Pressler amendment for a 
short period. This will disrupt the power balance not only 
between India and Pakistan but in the whole of South Asia. While 
the United States is talking about maintaining peace in this 
region, its actions will only create military rivalry and 
conflict here. It appears that the U.S. government is trying 
everything to keep both India and Pakistan happy. It tried to 
remove the tension created by a statement issued earlier by 
sending the deputy secretary here and, at the same time, 
loosened the Pressler amendment to satisfy Pakistan. It is not 
difficult to see how this political ploy of Clinton 
administration is giving a conflicting message. Republican 
Senator Larry Pressler has expressed serious concern over this 
decision of the Clinton administration. He also met President 
Clinton to question him about the proposal to give exemption 
under this law. 
  There is no doubt that if the Pressler amendment is 
suspended, Pakistan will get 71 F-16 planes, three submarines 
for its navy, and the destructive planes P-3 Orion. This will 
naturally increase Pakistan's military might. Not only its air 
force but also it navy will become significantly stronger. The 
step the United States is taking by suspending Pressler 
amendment for one year in order to comply with the older arms 
deal with Pakistan will greatly increase Pakistan's military 
power, which in turn will directly endanger India's security. As 
Prime Minister Narasimha Rao has said, this will trigger a new 
weapons race and India will have to rethink its defense policy. 
The United States is also the world's largest arms dealer. The 
Clinton administration is forced to consider suspending the 
Pressler amendment for a short time under pressure from the 
company that manufactures F-16 planes. In this context, he has 
to write a letter assuring that Pakistan does not have an atomic 
bomb. How will this be done? That is an interesting subject. The 
reason is that for the last several years there have been talks 
about Pakistan having nuclear bombs. This news was published in 
prominent American newspapers. The Pakistani prime minister has 
admitted that her country is not without a nuclear program. That 
is why the Pressler amendment was imposed on Pakistan. This law 
can be suspended only by sacrificing a declared policy and 
principles for trade profits and selfish reasons.

  [Except] The United States has proposed to Pakistan that it 
should sign the NPT in exchange for receiving 38 F-16 fighter 
planes. However, the Pakistani rulers have rejected this 
proposal and have asked for some clarification which perhaps 
will be given during the U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strob 
Talbot's visit to Islamabad. Pakistan's foreign minister, Sardar 
Asif Ali, maintains that his country will not sign that 
agreement unilaterally, and that the United States is aware that 
Pakistan will accept the NPT only when India is willing to sign 
it along with Pakistan. The truth is that both India and 
Pakistan have very different reasons for not signing the NPT. 
India has made it clear that its nuclear program is for peaceful 
purposes and it has no desire to make nuclear weapons. As for 
the NPT, it mostly protects the interests of nations that 
already have huge arsenals of nuclear weapons. Therefore, it is 
impossible for India to sign such a biased document. Meanwhile, 
Pakistan has avoided signing the NPT considering India a major 
danger to itself. In the context of the new U.S. proposal tied 
to the supply of F-16 planes, Pakistan has repeated the same old 
rhetoric that it cannot jeopardize its security just to get 38 
F-16 planes. 
  The fact is that the Pakistani rulers have tied their 
nuclear 
program to the resolution of the Jammu-Kashmir issue. They say 
that this issue has endangered the peace and stability of this 
region, and they do not want to tie their hands by signing the 
NPT while this issue is not resolved. This attitude of Pakistani 
rulers has unmasked their unholy designs to the whole world. It 
is avoiding signing the NPT by joining it to the Kashmir issue, 
and is secretly attaining nuclear capability with Chinese help. 
It has also been learned that Pakistan has the capability to 
make 12 bombs as powerful as were dropped on Hiroshima. It is 
not possible that the Clinton administration is not aware of it. 
Islamabad has joined its nuclear program with terrorist 
activities and all these activities are aimed against India. The 
U.S. government had at one time proposed including Pakistan in 
the list of terrorist nations based on this report. However, he 
United States changed its plan saying that Pakistan's attitude 
has changed and it was expected that Pakistan will improve. 
However, instead of improving its attitude, Pakistan has 
increased anti-India activities and is fully involved in making 
nuclear weapons. We feel pity for the U.S. government which, 
instead of putting pressure on Pakistan to stop this program, 
has announced through one of its senior officials in Washington 
that if Pakistan suspends its nuclear program the United States 
will provide it with 38 F-16 planes costing $658 million. This 
is a paradox and shows the sly tricks of the nation that calls 
itself the greatest power in the world. It tells Pakistan to 
stop its nuclear program and at the same time offers to provide 
it with the dangerous F-16 war planes. 
  Does not the Clinton administration know that if it provides 
F-16 planes in its efforts to stop nuclear proliferation in 
South Asia to end the danger of a nuclear war, then no one can 
stop the tension and weapon race in this region? India has 
insisted this to be the case repeatedly. Recently Home Minister 
Chavan informed the U.S. senators visiting New Delhi about 
India's fear that supplying Pakistan with F-16 planes despite 
the Pressler amendment will only increase tension in this region 
while we need to reduce it. If this still does not make sense to 
the American mind then its policy about South Asia becomes 
suspect. One reason for this belief and why this fear was 
strengthened is the advice given by the U.S. print media to 
India that it should support Clinton government's proposal under 
which it is giving F-16 planes to Pakistan in order to make it 
suspend its nuclear program. India's refusal to agree with this 
proposal and remaining adamant on its stand will be interpreted 
as hegemonic instead of desiring stability in the sub-continent.

<F P=106> [Article by Chitra Subrahmanyam: "Ultimately, What Is Behind </F>
American and European Sympathy for Laborers?"; all quotation 
marks as published]] 
  [Text] Geneva, 28 March. Full preparations have been made 
to declare India's cheap labor to be an unfair business 
practice. India has been in a position to make profits when 
competing with the Western nations because of the cheap labor 
here. Formal signing of the GATT will take place in Morocco on 
15 April. However, right before this, the United States and 
allies have expanded the sphere of the world trade agreement and 
have started a major campaign to include labor rates, the 
environment, human rights and other such issues in it. In the 
end, India's position will be greatly weakened when these issues 
are included in this agreement. 
  The Parliament is starting a special two day session on 
Tuesday to approve GATT. Meanwhile, the United States and the 
European group, especially France, have started to say that 
these new issues are related to trade. They maintain that strict 
rules are necessary to make sure that developing countries "do 
not take unnecessary advantage." Meanwhile, the developing 
nations say that the United States, by forcing issues that are 
not related to trade into this agreement, is endangering 
multi-national trade. 
  The diplomats say that this powerful campaign to expand 
GATT's sphere and establish strict trade policies is just an 
effort to hide the protectionalism practices of the richer 
nations. The United States and France are expressing rare 
agreement and saying that the time has come to give priority to 
the rights of laborers. Both countries are using cheap labor as 
an excuse to attack the developing countries and the 
export-based economies. The United States wants to add a 
paragraph to have the World Trade Organization (WTO) show its 
commitment to the "accepted level of labor." The WTO will 
replace GATT after the signing in Morocco. 
  This issue will be discussed in Brussels on Wednesday. Leon 
Briton, European Union's trade representative, will present a 
report that day requesting the WTO to pay attention to right to 
form unions, child and prison labor, and other social issues. 
The French authorities claim that this issue was discussed under 
employment during the G-7 nations meeting summit conference. 
This issue will top the agenda that Mickey Cantor, the U.S. 
trade negotiator, and Gerald Languet, the French negotiator, 
will discuss in Marrakech. Both these officials are going to 
demand that the WTO should have the right to investigate this 
problem soon. Peter Southerland, the executive director of GATT, 
told the participants in Geneva that he objects involving in 
trade the issues that the Western nations call "dumping the 
social garbage." However, a U.S. official said last week that 
President Clinton is committed to make the labor rights part of 
the WTO and it will be the duty of the U.S. trade representative 
to make sure that this goal is achieved. The official did admit 
that not all agree on this issue, however, he expressed the hope 
that consensus will be reached by the middle of April. 
  Developing nations say that the United States adds whatever 
it wants to GATT. These countries want that issues related to 
labor be discussed in the International Labor Organization. 
However, the Western nations say that the International Labor 
Organization is an ineffective shop where all they do is have 
some discussions. Therefore, these issues should be taken care 
of in the WTO. After the appeals to establish standards for 
labor, the United States has threatened China for not protecting 
human rights and Indonesia for not protecting labor rights. 
India can be its next target. 
  The present turmoil is reminding the diplomats of the 
"Montreal Syndrome." In 1988, the midterm analysis of the 
Uruguay Round was done in Montreal, and the whole agenda on 
trade was changed according to the demands of the United States 
and European countries. At that time, the U.S. strategy was to 
reduce the agenda of the issues that were not agreed upon 
earlier or in Montreal. 
  These issues were Trade-related Intellectual Property Rights 
(TRIPS), Trade-related Import Methods (TRIMS), and services. 
Strong pressures was put on developing nations there. Even worse 
was that they were given threats of unilateral action against 
them under the Super-301 and Special-301. 
  India was pressured using the intellectual property rights. 
The United States ignored the talks to be held in Geneva and 
raised this issue with India in 1989. The discussion was limited 
to the fact that GATT officials have access to Indian 
politicians and bureaucrats. After Montreal, as the result of 
the discussions in Geneva, solid rules and regulations about 
intellectual property rights were added. All this had nothing to 
do with GATT, and there was no provision in its original 
announcement about it. Meanwhile, the developing nations were 
left reviewing the new areas that were included under the 
pretext of their being "related to trade." 
  After India had bowed down under U.S. pressure, the Indian 
delegate said on 8 April 1989, "We have provided an opportunity 
for multi-party approach, therefore, the decision on the 
conclusion of these talks must be made by the ministers from the 
Uruguay round. We will be satisfied if no decision is made 
before that." The results of the April 1989 meeting were 
disastrous for India. Instead of getting any benefits, India 
kept trying to reduce its losses. 
  The United States is pulling the same trick again. It is 
trying to force a decision using the pretext of the labor issue. 
India is insisting again that no decision should be forced 
without full discussions. Both are using the same language, and 
India's representatives are the same. One can assume what the 
result will be.

  [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 16--The external affairs minister, 
Mr Dinesh Singh, yesterday urged for Indo-U.S. co-operation 
against terrorism during his meeting with the U.S. Senator, Mr 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, here. 
  While providing the Senator an account of the present 
situation in Kashmir, Mr Dinesh Singh provided details about 
Pakistani aid being provided to terrorists in Kashmir. 
  While urging for the need for the two large democracies to 
cooperate against terrorism and promotion of peace, Mr Dinesh 
Singh told the visiting U.S. Senator that it was also necessary 
for Pakistan to desist from supporting terrorism if it was 
serious about normalising relations. 
  During discussions which otherwise focused on bilateral 
relations, both the leaders felt that economic relationship was 
being strengthened by the day and that this was a happy 
development that should be taken even further. Mr Moynihan 
observed that there had indeed been great increase in the United 
States' economic engagement with India which augurs well for the 
future. 
  The minister of state for external affairs, Mr Salman 
Khursheed, said today Indo-U.S. relations were "alike and close" 
though, inevitably, there were differences on many issues. 
  Speaking at a meeting of the Indo-U.S. sub-commission on 
education and culture, he said the differences sometimes became 
sharper and acute, but would not come in the way of the growing 
strong and mature relations between the two nations. 
  Mr Khursheed said with the liberalisation of the Indian 
economy, new channels of co-operation had opened up between 
India and the United States. India provided a vast market of 250 
million middle-class people. India and China would play an 
important and active role in the world economies. Globalisation 
of economy could help forge strong bonds of friendship. 
  Referring to the shortage of funds being faced by the 
commission, Mr Khursheed said this had to be remedied since the 
body greatly helped to develop strong "cultural and educational 
bonds between the two nations." At the same time, he expressed 
apprehensions about invasion of foreign culture. The commission 
should play an active role in avoiding a clash of cultures. 
  He said the United States offered vast opening to India in 
science and technology, professional management and other fields. 
  In his speech, Mr Moynihan stressed the need for upgrading 
the Indo-U.S. relations in all spheres since some described the 
two countries as "estranged democracies." 
  He said non-resident Indians in the United States were 
playing an active part in commercial and political activities. 
  Meanwhile, the former foreign secretary, Mr J.N. Dixit, 
today 
said Indo-U.S. relations were passing through a difficult patch 
which could last up to two years.

<F P=106> [Article by Radhe Shyam Yadav: "Should the Prime Minister Go </F>
to America?"] 
  [Text] We are so accommodating of the United States that 
questions about our lack of pride are raised even in U.S. Senate 
committees. However, our foreign ministry and the Parliamentary 
committees dealing with foreign affairs never pay any heed to 
it. Recently, the Assistant Secretary for South Asian Affairs, 
Robin Raphel, was grilled in a U.S. Senate sub-committee as to 
why the Clinton Administration has not appointed an ambassador 
to India. However, this question was never raised in the Indian 
political and administrative circles. The Clinton Administration 
has not appointed an ambassador to India after more than one 
year in office. Despite this, Our ambassador is also making 
plans for Prime Minister Narasimha Rao's visit to the United 
States. When all this is happening, the question arises as to 
whether India's prime minister should visit that country. 
  Several important persons, including four former foreign 
secretaries, have reacted in support of and in opposition to the 
visit. Two of them support an immediate visit by the prime 
minister (so that misunderstandings and miscommunications are 
removed and an atmosphere of friendship and cooperation is 
created). The other side says that it is the United States that 
has stained the relations (and is not willing to appoint an 
ambassador soon). Why should the Indian prime minister visit the 
U.S. before the Clinton administration makes the first move? 
This is especially true when the Clinton administration does not 
recognize Kashmir's joining India as complete and final and 
calls it disputed territory. In such a political climate, Prime 
Minister Narasimha Rao's visiting the United States would mean 
that India has knelt down to the United States because of its 
kind deeds done through the World Bank and India has no 
alternative but to play the U.S. game of keeping India and 
Pakistan at odds with each other. Is it necessary for India to 
inform the United States, the rest of the world, and, most of 
all, Pakistan about this submission? If it is not necessary, 
then how can the Indian prime minister visit the United States 
before a U.S. ambassador is appointed to India? Such a step is 
taken only by countries that are economically and politically 
slaves. 
  It is true that the United States has invested more money in 
India than any other country and has provided technology to 
India in many areas. At the same time, it is also true that it 
has been regularly encouraging Pakistan to sink its teeth into 
India's heels. The U.S. President's comment on Kashmir in the 
United Nations, reference to human rights violations in Punjab 
and Kashmir, and U.S. officials' declaring Kashmir a disputed 
region are actions which cue the Pakistani government (and its 
intelligence agency--Interservices Intelligence) [ISI] and the 
terrorists and separatists in Kashmir and Punjab to accelerate 
their activities against India. These hints are followed up. The 
groups active in this region and Benazir and her government in 
Pakistan accelerate their activities against India. Therefore, 
the Indian prime minister's visit to the United States in the 
midst of the U.S. government's anti-India activities is nothing 
but an insult to our country and its people. 
  There was a time when governments formed by the opposition 
parties used to be involved in such actions. When the government 
of a coalition of opposition parties was formed, its cabinet 
members began to dash to the United States (and then-U.S. friend 
China's capital, Beijing). No Congress Party government has 
taken a step in the past that embarrassed our nation. We do 
remember Indira Gandhi's visit to the United States when she was 
allowed to meet with Reagan only after she was checked with a 
metal detector for security reasons. (This insult was meted out 
perhaps to avenge her for her actions that broke up Pakistan in 
1971). However, at that time, Indira Gandhi needed the 
President's support because she wanted to borrow money from the 
World Bank. However, at this time when India's foreign exchange 
reserve is satisfactory and India has also agreed to the Dunkel 
proposals, Prime Minister Narasimha Rao has no such exigencies 
that are forcing him to visit the United States. It is not 
appropriate to try to improve relations when the United States 
is involved in damaging Indo-United States relations by putting 
on different kinds of pressures. 
  In addition, this tension in the relationship did not occur 
suddenly. The U.S. government has been creating this tension 
methodically. Its goals are to have India sign the NPT 
[Nonproliferation Treaty] after it has agreed to the Dunkel 
proposals, and to stop it from having better relations with 
China and Iran. The United States does tolerate India's 
relations with Russia to a level where it is in a position to 
help India make progress in science and technology. For example, 
the United States is not only worried but also alarmed by 
India's progress in its space program, energy projects, defense 
implements such as rockets, tanks, radars, fighter planes, and 
naval vessels. Additionally, if India is able to make economic 
progress independently, the United States will not be able to 
control its huge market. Therefore, it is important for the 
United States to control India's scientific progress and 
economic development through the World Bank. When this plan is 
transparent, is it appropriate for the U.S. government to hint 
to India that it show its willingness to make this plan 
successful?

  [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 11--Belgium has asked Pakistan not 
to globalise the Kashmir issue and hailed India's six-point 
proposal to Islamabad for initiating a peace process between the 
two countries at the bilateral level, report agencies. 
  The Belgian foreign minister, Mr Willy Claes, during his 
talks with the external affairs minister, Mr Dinesh Singh, in 
Brussels, said it was not appropriate for Pakistan to 
internationalise the Kashmir issue. He stressed the need for the 
two countries to resolve the issue bilaterally through 
discussions, an official release said here today. 
  Mr Claes said the European union was keen to develop closer 
links with Asia, especially India. 
  He said India's six-point confidence-building proposals to 
Pakistan could mark the beginning of the peace process. 
  The Belgian minister said the problem of fundamentalism and 
terrorism posed a threat to the European union also. The EU had 
an interest in the stability of the Asian region, he added. 
  Mr Singh referred to Pakistan's instigation of terrorist 
activities in Jammu and Kashmir and its attempts to 
internationalise the Kashmir issue in various international fora 
through false propaganda on human rights. 
  Mr Singh was assisted in the talks by the foreign secretary, 
Mr K. Srinivasan, and other senior officials. 
  Mr Singh also expressed India's commitment to strengthening 
friendly ties with Belgium, both in the bilateral field and in 
the wider context of relations with the EU. 
  In a related development, India has regretted Pakistan's 
raising of the Kashmir issue at the non-aligned movement (NAM) 
foreign ministers' meeting in Jakarta. 
  Exercising the right of reply at the meeting yesterday, the 
minister of state for external affairs, Mr R.L. Bhatia, said it 
was a "well-known fact that the problems of Kashmir, which is an 
integral part of India, is a result of terrorism actively 
sponsored by Pakistan." 
  The Pakistani foreign minister raised the Kashmir issue and 
contended that the security of small states had been threatened 
and the right to self-determination was being denied to the 
people. 
  In Kashmir valley, meanwhile, a militant-sponsored bandh 
paralysed normal life today even as the security forces shot 
dead four Pakistan-trained militants and arrested seven others 
since yesterday evening. 
  A huge cache of arms, ammunition and explosives were 
recovered from the arrested militants. 
  The main building of the district police line in Doda 
district of the Jammu region was gutted in a fire. The building 
was damaged in the incident and some store items were also 
gutted. However, the armoury was saved from much damage, an 
official spokesman told reporters here today. 
  A complete bandh was observed in the valley today in 
response 
to the call given by the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front 
(JKLF) to observe the tenth death anniversary of its founder, 
Maqbul Bhat, as "third option day" today. 
  Maqbul Bhat was hanged to death in Tihar jail on this day in 
1984 on the charge of murder of a police official. 
  In Srinagar and rest of the valley, all shops and business 
establishments remained closed and transport was also off the 
roads. 
  The summer capital wore a deserted look with only a large 
number of security forces present on the roads and security 
vehicles plying. 
  In view of the bandh call and the JKLF's plan to hold 
demonstrations, the authorities deployed additional forces on 
the main streets and in sensitive areas. 
  Four Pakistan-returned militants including a self-styled 
company commander of a militant outfit were killed by the 
security forces in two separate encounters at Bomai and Sangrama 
in Baramulla district yesterday evening, the official spokesman 
said. 
  He said three improvised explosive devices and an 
anti-personnel mine were detected by the security forces during 
search operations at Anantnag district. The explosive devices 
were later defused.

  [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 12--The visiting French Senate 
delegation says it is "convinced that dialogue (between India 
and Pakistan on Kashmir) is necessary and the exclusive (only) 
way to approach a solution." 
  This was stated by the delegation's leader, Mr. Xavier de 
Villepin, at a press conference here soon after the team had a 
meeting with the Prime Minister Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, here on 
Friday. 
  The influential French Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs, 
Defence and the Armed Forces is to report its observations on 
the Indian position with respect to Kashmir, human rights and 
terrorism, besides non-proliferation and security-related 
issues, to the French Government. 
  Mr. de Villepin said he delivered a letter to Mr. Rao from 
the French Prime Minister, Mr. Edouard Balladur, in which the 
French leader had suggested "across-the-border" intensified 
cooperation with India in the political, economic and cultural 
fields. 
  In response to questions, Mr. de Villepin said "We also have 
respect for India's policy on Kashmir. We have no reason to 
criticise the position. We will objectively report what we have 
seen here. In France we are very concerned with human rights, 
but we are against terrorism in the world. France has also 
suffered on account of terrorism." 
  Answering another question, Mr. de Villepin said, "After 
being briefed by the Prime Minister we understand the situation 
much better than before and appreciate the risks and dangers 
involved, should the dialogue process suffer." 
  At their "cordial" meeting, the Prime Minister, reportedly 
stressed the overriding value of continuing dialogue with 
Pakistan in dealing with all contentions bilateral issues, 
including Kashmir. No development should be permitted to 
intervene that could hurt the nascent process of dialogue that 
commenced only last month, he said. In the context of the 
publicised Pakistani intention to bring forward an anti-India 
resolution on Kashmir at the U.N. Commission on Human Rights 
(UNCHR) in Geneva. 
  In this context it is noteworthy that the French Foreign 
Minister, Mr. Alain Juppe, told his Pakistani counterpart, Mr. 
Asif Ali, who was in Paris on a private visit about a week ago 
to canvass support for his country's proposed resolution on 
Kashmir, that any resolution would be worth considering and 
supporting if it furthered the prospects of ongoing dialogue. 
  When the resolution comes up for voting, members of the 
European Union (EU) are expected to take a common position, 
rather than individual country stances. The French view attains 
significance in this overall framework. 
  EU sources here also suggest that member countries have not 
been impressed by a Pakistani note accompanying a copy of its 
proposed resolution being circulated among the 53 members of the 
UNCHR. The note is remarkable for suggesting that India is 
impervious to the human rights situation in the Kashmir Valley. 
"This does not ring true," sources observed. 
  Delegation sources later said they did not appreciate the 
idea of the kind of resolution Pakistan was proposing at a time 
such as this as it could distract from ongoing discussions to 
solve a very intricate problem. 
  "Just look at the Middle East. It is a great lesson. Where 
would we all be if the dialogue between the contending parties 
had broken down?" a Senate Committee source observed. 
  Mr. de Villepin said cooperation between France and India 
could cover a wide field including defence, high-tech areas such 
as satellites, telecom and electronics, and agro-business and 
vaccine development, covering commercial arrangements in both 
public and private sectors.

<F P=106> [Article by K.K. Katyal: "Stabilizing Ties With China"] </F>
  [Text] It is a measure of stability of the Sino-Indian 
relations that there was no undue despair over the limited 
progress by their experts, at their meeting last week to sort 
out differences over the expansion of confidence building 
measures [CBMs] along the border. On the contrary, the headlines 
on the conclusion of their two days' discussions were based on a 
positive but general comment of the Foreign Office 
spokesman--that both sides had adopted a "constructive and 
forward-looking approach." He need not have taken shelter behind 
these cliches. The slow advance in the negotiations on sensitive 
matters, connected with the advanced stage of the CBMs, is 
unlikely to cause a misunderstanding. On the contrary, there is 
the danger of avoidable suspicion if official remarks are seen 
as glossing over specifics. 
  The experts, a mixed group of diplomats and military 
personnel, met as a follow-up of the agreement, reached during 
the Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao's visit to China in 
September last year, through which the two sides formalised 
their resolve to maintain peace and tranquillity along the Line 
of Control. The agreement, it was stated then, had established a 
framework, but details were to be settled in keeping with the 
principle of "mutual and equal security." The "depth, timing and 
nature" of the reduction of forces--to cite one measure--were to 
be settled through mutual discussions. Going by official 
statements (and also what was left unstated) at the time of Mr. 
Rao's visit, the experts were to sort out differences on the 
alignment of the LAC [Line of Actual Control], reducing the 
military forces along it and the modalities for re-deployment, 
so as to end the eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation (in some 
cases). The last task would also involve relocation of border 
posts. 
  This is not an easy job, complicated as much by the 
background of confrontation as by the terrain where equality in 
the depth of withdrawal could confer unequal advantages on the 
two sides. The negotiations, therefore, were bound to be hard 
and tough and even the next round may not be final. This should 
not cause dismay, much less alarm. On the contrary, it is a 
matter of satisfaction that persisting differences are contained 
within the framework for negotiations and do not disturb either 
the peace in the border region or the CBMs, already in place. 
The two sides may not have yet pulled out troops in conformity 
with a mutually agreed plan but were known to have effected 
withdrawal on the basis of their respective, independent 
assessments. 
  The steps already taken or intended to be taken (subject to 
the mutual agreement) are no flash-in-pan affair but are 
anchored in the political understanding borne out of contacts at 
various levels, from the top downward. It had been an 
incremental process that promoted amity not only on 
border-related issues but in most of the bilateral field. The 
border has been tension-free now for years and even those 
Western correspondents, who specialised in predicting conflict 
and hostilities in the late Eighties on the strength of the 
flimsiest of pointers, have not predicted a clash. The contacts 
between the commanders and other related steps involved the 
military forces in the institutionalised arrangement to maintain 
peace in the border areas. It worked well and was gradually 
expanded. What is now being attempted is a further expansion, 
based on a firmer basis. 
  The progress and the positive results achieved in this case 
encouraged New Delhi to suggest an identical arrangement to 
Pakistan to stabilise the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir. 
This was the subject-matter of one of the six proposals, 
conveyed to Islamabad last month for a smooth working 
arrangement. The most comprehensive document, it was virtually 
in the form of a draft agreement, based as it was on the 
parallel with the Sino-Indian border. The LAC in Jammu and 
Kashmir, as a matter of fact, is already demarcated, with the 
two sides committed to respecting it under the Shimla Agreement. 
The fact that there are no ambiguities about it should have been 
an advantage but, in the context of distrust and acrimony, the 
deadlock persists. 
  The involvement of the military establishments in the 
Sino-Indian contacts is comparatively a recent development. The 
interaction began in the late Eighties but picked up in the 
aftermath of the positive process set in motion in December 1988 
by the China visit of the then Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi. It 
got a new impetus in 1992 by the Beijing trip of the Defence 
Minister of the day, Mr. Sharad Pawar. Mr. Pawar's move, itself, 
followed contacts at other levels--the 1990 visit to China of a 
team of the National Defence College and a return trip here by a 
delegation of the Chinese National Defence University. Recently, 
the military exchanges got a new spurt--with a visit by the 
Chinese Vice Chief of the Army Staff here after a gap of some 30 
years and calls for the Chinese naval ships at Bombay after four 
decades. 
  This is a matter of satisfaction, but not of euphoria. There 
are certain features of China's policies which cannot but cause 
worry here. China, as is known, had been of crucial help to 
Pakistan by providing it nuclear know-how. But for it, 
Islamabad, perhaps, would not have achieved the present level of 
development of its nuclear capability. Recently Chinese supplies 
of M-11 missiles to Pakistan not only caused nervousness here 
but also attracted the notice of the United States--it was 
regarded a violation of the Missile Technology Control Regime 
(MTCR), to which Beijing is a party. China, of course, does not 
see anything unusual in it--this and other supplies are 
described as commercial deals, and as the Chinese Ambassador in 
New Delhi, Mr. Ruisheng Cheng, said the other day, India could 
be a buyer of the military hardware if it desired. 
  China's nuclear capability--and its leaps forward--could not 
but be a source of discomfort to India. The installation of 
nuclear weapons in Tibet merely demonstrated the meaning of the 
Chinese programme for India. It could not be directed at major 
powers in the West. The other nations which should be worried 
are Japan and the ASEAN [Association of South East Asian 
Nations] countries. But, surprisingly, both China, a nuclear 
power, and, Japan a non-nuclear power are signatories to the 
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT] and often lecture India 
on the virtues of acceding to the treaty. Logically, Japan 
should have a better appreciation of India's concerns but, 
perhaps because of pressures from Washington and others in the 
industrialised world, it echoes their exhortations to New Delhi. 
The ASEAN members have big economic stakes in China in the wake 
of its gigantic reform and liberalisation processes. This tends 
to submerge the concerns over Beijing's nuclear policies and 
related matters. But, in their heart of hearts, there is a 
desire to balance a forward-looking China with some other 
power--India could be one--now that the United States has 
curtailed its presence in the region. 
  The bilateral relations between countries are seldom a 
black-or-white affair, but a mix of the positive and the 
negative, the comforting and the worrisome. The Sino-Indian ties 
are no exception, and if there are incongruities in the 
different elements of the total relationship, it should be taken 
as a normal feature. 
  The mutually conflicting strands manifest themselves in 
varied forms. Take the case of India and its stand on the NPT. 
When pressured by the Western nations to accede to the treaty or 
accept its regional variant, India pleads its inability to do so 
because of its security concerns. New Delhi wants them to take 
into account the China factor. And they turn round and say: "But 
haven't you normalised your relations with China? Have you not 
agreed to maintain peace and tranquillity along the border?" 
  Not long ago, Pakistan-China relationship was India's major 
worry. Because of their shared antipathy to India, the two 
countries found several convergence points in their 
neighbourhood policies. Pakistan achieved a major success by 
securing China's public support on the Kashmir and other 
problems with India. Beijing did not mince words in backing the 
demand for a plebiscite in Jammu and Kashmir. Also, other 
neighbours like Nepal made full use of the China card against 
India. No such voices emanate from Beijing now. China supports 
the idea of a solution of Kashmir and other issues through 
direct, bilateral discussions between India and Pakistan. It 
sees no other role for itself--certainly not as a mediator. 
During her recent visit to Beijing, the Pakistan Prime Minister, 
Ms. Benazir Bhutto, failed to secure China's support on these 
matters. But otherwise Sino-Pakistan warmth remains undiminished. 
  And what about the United States and China? With all the 
talk 
against the human rights record of China, the United States has 
not hesitated in forging close trade ties with it. It is a new, 
pragmatic pattern--and Sino-Indian ties fit into it with several 
pluses--but with some minuses.

<F P=106> [Article by Radhanath Chaturvedi: "India and China: </F>
Extending the Hand of Friendship to Each other"] 
  [Text] Some recent incidents seem to hint that the chasm 
created between India and China during the 1962 confrontation is 
becoming narrower now. One of the indicators of this change is 
China's reaction to the Pakistani resolution in the UN Human 
Rights Commission [UNHRC] meeting in Geneva. 
  Pakistan is so agitated over the Jammu-Kashmir issue that it 
raises it at every international platform and is always 
defeated. It brought this issue up in the form of a resolution 
in the UNHRC meeting in Geneva. Pakistan first suggested that an 
international task force be sent to Kashmir for investigating 
human rights violations there and that a report be presented in 
the 49th session of the United Nations. Later, it amended this 
resolution and demanded that the situation related to human 
rights violations be investigated and India be asked to protect 
human rights there. It did not mention India in the first draft, 
however, the finger was clearly pointed towards India. India was 
mentioned by name in the amended resolution. 
  There are 53 members on this commission and China is one of 
them. Usually, China supports Pakistan against India, however, 
this time China said when the resolution was introduced that if 
Pakistan insisted on a vote then it would not participate in the 
vote. This is a new development. Also, when Prime Minister 
Benazir Bhutto went to Beijing on official visit, she had asked 
the Chinese leaders to support Pakistan openly over the 
Jammu-Kashmir issue. China had expressed disagreement over the 
proposal which was made public in the communication published 
after the Pakistani prime minister's visit. 
  After the fall of the Soviet Union, no major world power is 
left to support India at the international level over the 
Jammu-Kashmir issue. The U.S. attitude is known to all. Against 
this background, the Chinese attitude from the Indian 
perspective was very welcome, and still is. 
  An even more important fact than these two developments is 
the meeting of military officials and diplomats from India and 
China to discuss the border-related differences between the two 
countries. Although no decisions were made in this meeting held 
in New Delhi, the atmosphere lacked tension and the attitude on 
every issue was cooperative and productive. In this meeting, 
discussion centered around such topics as making some changes in 
the Line of Control in the northeastern region, changing sites 
of some military posts, reducing the number of soldiers, and 
starting and increasing trade across the border. It is clear 
that some of these problems are so old that these cannot be 
resolved in a single meeting. Therefore, one or two more 
meetings will be held. The next meeting following the diplomatic 
protocol should be held in Beijing, and will take place soon. 
  The series of these meeting started after Prime Minister 
Narasimha Rao's visit to China in September 1993. However, the 
efforts to improve relations began in the early 80s. In December 
1988, then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi visited China. The 
groundwork he created for goodwill was further enhanced by 
Defense Minister Sharad Pawar's visit to China. A deputation 
from the National Defense College visited China in 1990. On 
their invitation, a representative group from the Chinese 
National Defense University came to visit India. At that time, 
military deputations were encouraged to visit each other. The 
vice commander of the Chinese army visited India after about 
three decades. After about 40 years, a Chinese naval ship docked 
at an Indian port in Bombay. 
  All these remind one of the days when India and China had 
come into contact at the Bandug Conference [1954]. Both 
countries had jointly expressed faith in the Panchashila 
principles. This relationship was poisoned with Zhou Enlai's 
demand to have Aksai Chin, forcible occupation of Tibet, India's 
silent acceptance, and finally the war on the northeastern 
border in 1962. The final episode destroyed the late Krishna 
Menon's dream of friendship between the two nations, and killed 
the first Prime Minister Nehru. Mr. Nehru was greatly hurt by 
the Chinese attack and could not bear it. It took 20-25 years to 
dissolve the bitterness that was created in 1962. 
  It is true that India can take a sigh of relief at the 
indications of both countries coming together. However, there is 
no reason to stop worrying and become complacent. 
  The main reason for India's worry is the Chinese progress in 
the area of nuclear technology for weapons. Secondly, China is 
still supplying weapons to Pakistan. China's recent sale of 11 
missiles to Pakistan has shaken us up. Even worse than this is 
China's attitude about trade. The United States used to supply 
weapon to Pakistan in the past. The mention of Star warplanes 
was often made in this context. However, the United States was 
upset at Pakistan's efforts at making nuclear bombs. It began to 
lose interest in Pakistan and restricted supply of weapons to an 
extent. China came forward at such an opportunity and started 
to supply missiles and other weapons. These missiles cannot be 
used against any country except India. China considers the sale 
of these missiles to be purely a business deal. When India 
expressed its concern, a Chinese government spokesman said that 
India can also purchase these missiles and other weapons from 
China if it so desires. It is willing to supply these to India 
also. This situation definitely causes concern. It puts a 
question mark on the efforts China has made to improve relations. 
  As for the border dispute, this is a major issue for India. 
India has seas on three sides. Except for Pakistan and China, 
there are friendly nations on our borders. There is no military 
danger from other countries. However the same cannot be said of 
China. The country, with over one billion in population is 3,000 
miles long and 2,500 miles wide. Its borders meet with 11 other 
countries. These countries are: North Korea, some regions of the 
former Soviet Union, Mongolia, Afghanistan, Nepal, India, 
Bhutan, Burma. Laos, and Vietnam. Pakistan has also joined as a 
neighbor of China now because China has taken over 2,000 square 
miles of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. 
  There are very few countries with which China does not have 
border-related disputes. It disagrees with North Korea over the 
border in the Chang Chai mountains. Its border problems with the 
former Soviet Union is well known. There is disagreement with 
Myanmar over some areas in Yennan province. China has such 
economic, military and trade relations with Vietnam and Laos, 
and they have so much open travel among the three countries that 
it is not known where one country's border begins or ends. China 
disagrees with Nepal over Mount Everest. China says that Mount 
Everest is in China [Tibet] and Nepal says it is in Nepal. The 
groups that come to climb the Everest get permission from the 
Nepalese government. China has disputes with Mongolia also. 
Thus, involvement in border disputes has become a part of 
China's political life style. 
  If we can leave the border dispute alone and give some time 
for it to be resolved, the efforts that India and China are 
making to normalize their relations should continue. It appears 
very possible that these will continue and both countries will 
continue to have close ties.

  [Text] Colombo, Feb. 10--The Indian High Commissioner in 
Sri Lanka, Mr. Nareshwar Dayal, has protested to the Sri Lankan 
Foreign Ministry against the activities of the Pakistan High 
Commission on the Kashmir issue. 
  Indian High Commission sources said "It is not in the 
diplomatic norms to announce public screening of films or 
propaganda material against a third country. And we have brought 
this to the notice of Colombo. The Government of India thinks it 
wise to ignore the rest of the routine propaganda that Islamabad 
has always whipped up. Let us see how things develop from here." 
  More than anything else, the concern of New Delhi seems to 
be 
to prevent Colombo from becoming another point for infiltration 
by Pakistani agents. India has expressed concern over the 
`infiltration' through Kathmandu and more recently from Dhaka, 
of persons suspected to be trained by Pakistan's Inter-Services 
Intelligence Agency. 
  High Commission sources say there are standing instructions 
that visas should not be given to third country nationals here 
for visiting India, without verifying the reasons and their 
antecedents from the mission in their country of origin. 
However, recently a group of Afghans landed in Madras with 
forged visas obtained through operators in Colombo. This was 
detected by the Immigration authorities. 
  The Foreign Ministry here has also been asked to step up the 
drive against these `agencies' which issue bogus passports and 
visas. It has come to notice that many Sri Lankans themselves 
have more than one passport obtained through these `operators' 
and they use a different one for each visit. 
  Recently, the U.S. Embassy too faced a problem, when 
advertisements appeared in the local press about a lottery for 
the issue of green cards. The Embassy promptly issued a counter 
advertisement appealing to the people not to be misled by any 
agency or operator. 
  Such agencies have become the order of the day and when 
travel has become so popular, they establish contacts with the 
embassies to obtain even a legal, visa through a short-cut. 
  The Indian High Commission in Colombo issues over 400 visas 
a 
day to all categories of travellers. A majority of Sri Lankans 
visiting India, are either pilgrims or patients, according to 
High Commission sources.

<F P=106> [Article by Avinash Singh] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, 14 April. Having failed to achieve the 
desired results with the Sikh boys in forging an alliance with 
the Kashmiri militants under its K2 (Kashmir Khalistan) plan, so 
that their respective "freedom movements" could be guided to its 
logical conclusions Inter-Services Intelligence [ISI] of 
Pakistan with the assistance of Jehad Council is now trying its 
hands at Ahmadiya youth. [sentence as published] 
  While one of the Ahmadiya boys Zubair Ahmed, reported to be 
an activist of Babbar Khalsa, was shot dead at Qadian in 
Gurdaspur district, the international headquarters of the 
community some time back a couple of others have been nabbed by 
security agencies in Srinagar and Delhi in recent weeks. 
  The "arrests" have revealed that members of the Ahmadiya 
community were being recruited for dual purpose--reviving 
terrorism in Punjab and fomenting more trouble in Kashmir. 
Besides furthering the K2 ambition that got a battering in 
Punjab, the new recruitment is also aimed at bringing a bad name 
to the Ahmadiyas, a hated lot in Pakistan. 
  Ahmadiyas are the followers of London-based religious chief 
Mirza Tahir Ahmad, the fourth generation of Khalifatul-Masih. 
Ahmadiyas have over the years been complaining of persecution 
in Pakistan where they are not treated as Muslims. As per the 
diktats of Islam there cannot be any Prophet after Prophet 
Mohammad, Muslims in Pakistan contend. Ahmadiyas, however, 
claim that they are true Muslims. They say that Mirza Tahir 
Ahmad is a "man of God", who "was born to bring comfort to 
fellow human beings." 
  It is understood that olive branch being held out to 
Ahmadiya 
youth while exhorting them to take to the gun is that once they 
proved their loyalty to Islam by joining the "Jehad" they could 
claim parity to other Muslim sects. 
  The brain behind this move is none other than Maj Gen-[Major 
General] designate Imtiaz, who is heading the Jehad Council. 
Interestingly, Brigadier Imtiaz was earlier heading the Kashmir 
cell of the ISI and was also the key functionary of the Joint 
Command Coordination Cell (JCC), later rechristened as the Jehad 
Council. The Major General-designate is currently being assisted 
by Col. Sadiq in Sialkot and Major Javed in Muzaffarabad. 
  Recent interrogation reports have disclosed that one Ayaz 
Ahmad was the first boy from the Ahmadiya community to be 
trained in Pakistan occupied Kashmir by the ISI sleuths sometime 
last year. He was sent to the Valley later to establish contact 
with youngsters from his clan and motivate them into joining the 
struggle for liberation of Kashmiris from the "shackles of 
India". 
  Ayaz escaped security dragnet twice in Kashmir and moved to 
the national capital where he took up the assignment of 
preparing fake passports and travel documents for ISI contacts 
and make their lodging arrangements in old Delhi area. These 
contacts started arriving in India by Samjhota Express after 
large number of them got killed while crossing the Line of 
Control (LOC) around November last year. 
  Another Ahmadiya boy active in Punjab has been identified as 
Habib Ahmad. Habib is operating for Babbar Khasla, an 
organisation for which his late younger brother Zubair was 
working. He has been making frequent trips to Kashmir with a 
view to establish fresh contact with the militants in the Valley 
in a bid to provide a fresh lease of life to the K2 plan. 
  Questioning of the arrested extremists have confirmed that 
Khalistani protagonists like Daljit Singh Bittoo of the Sikh 
Students Federation and Lakhbir Singh Rode (Khalistan Commando 
Force) are currently in Sialkot and were closely in touch with 
the Kashmiri militants. They are in the care of Col. Sadiq, who 
was earlier based in Multan. 
  Another votary of Khalistan Wassan Singh Zaffarwal, as per 
latest reports, was spotted in Muzaffrabad recently. He is 
believed to be closely associated with Major Javed, one of the 
very few to have direct access to Jehad Council chief Imtiaz.

<F P=106> [Article by K.K. Katyal] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 4--The recent episode of the 
Pakistan High Commissioner, Mr. Riaz Khokhar, not being allowed 
to go to Calcutta because of insufficient notice to the 
authorities has brought to light the treatment of Indian and 
Pakistani diplomats in each other's capital and the need to 
remove the current restrictions altogether both here and in 
Islamabad. 
  The restrictive regime was first introduced by Pakistan when 
it prescribed a seven-day notice by the Indian High Commissioner 
in Islamabad for going out of the city. The then envoy there, 
Mr. S.K. Singh, was the first to feel the pinch of the 
restraint--when he wanted to go to Peshawar to see the ailing 
Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan (regarded in India as one of the 
architects of Independence). Two years later, New Delhi slapped 
similar restrictions on a reciprocal basis. In practice, there 
have been instances of the two Governments waiving the 
requirement, but the restriction remained--and was intended to 
apply to various categories of diplomats (and, perhaps, their 
spouses also). 
  Recently, Mr. Khokhar sought permission to go to Calcutta 
but 
it was turned down on the ground that he had [not] given five 
days' notice. The authorities in the Home Ministry, responsible 
for processing such cases, could have taken a lenient view--as 
they had done in the case of Mrs. Khokhar earlier. They, 
however, stuck to the norms of reciprocity. 
  Such cases are bound to arise as long as the restrictive 
regime is in place. Why should there be curbs on Indians in 
Islamabad or Pakistanis in New Delhi, when the rest of the 
diplomatic corps in the two capitals is free to move about in 
the entire length and breadth of their host countries after a 
simple intimation? These curbs are not the only irritants, there 
being frequent complaints of shadowing by the minions of 
security agencies. 
  It was to rectify this situation that, in August 1992, the 
foreign secretaries of the two countries, Mr. J.N. Dixit and Mr. 
Shahryar Khan, agreed on a code of conduct, laying down do's and 
don'ts for the treatment of one country's diplomats in the 
other's capital. 
  The immediate provocation was provided by an unpleasant 
episode in Islamabad where a senior Indian diplomat was beaten 
up by the intelligence personnel. The code committed the two 
sides to avoiding "intrusive surveillance" and other forms of 
harassment of diplomats. It enjoined upon the concerned agencies 
to spare the families of the diplomatic and consular personnel. 
It sought to ensure the safety of the staff and their families 
and respect for the rights of the diplomats to receive guests. 
The two sides reaffirmed their faith in the Vienna Conventions 
of 1961 and 1963, committing themselves to respecting the 
dignity of the diplomatic personnel and inviolability of 
official vehicles. 
  The code was expected to create a new climate and make 
unsavoury cases things of the past. It was not destined to be 
that way. Not long after, Pakistan drastically pruned the staff 
of the Indian consulate in Karachi, as the press campaign 
referred to it as a nest of espionage. New Delhi paid Islamabad 
back in kind. 
  Indo-Pakistan ties are far from normal but their missions 
could be used as vehicles for bringing about improvements. If 
the diplomatic channels get clogged, efforts at other levels to 
establish reasonably smooth working relationship would be doomed 
to failure.

  [Text] New Delhi, February 9--India is appointing a senior 
diplomat, Mr Madhav Mangalmurti, presently ambassador to 
Switzerland, as the first ambassador to South Africa. 
  The Indian diplomatic mission in South Africa is being set 
up 
well ahead of the first free elections in the country slated for 
April. 
  The pace of mutual co-operation between the two countries 
has 
been quickened since the signing of the historic protocol for 
diplomatic ties during the recent visit of the South African 
foreign minister, Mr R.F. Botha, to New Delhi. 
  In the last few months, India has not only established a 
direct air link with South Africa but has also set up a cultural 
centre in Johannesburg. Last month, the minister of state for 
external affairs, Mr Salman Khursheed, paid an official visit to 
South Africa and met leaders of all the major political parties 
there.

<F P=106> [Article by Thomas Abraham: "Dinesh Briefs European Union </F>
Leaders"] 
  [Text] Brussels, Feb. 9--The External Affairs Minister, Mr. 
Dinesh Singh, made a forceful presentation of India's 
perceptions on the causes for the problems in Kashmir at his 
meeting with the troika of European Union Ministers here on 
Tuesday night and was in turn told that the E.U. had been 
telling Pakistan not to support terrorism. 
  "I told them that if Pakistan stops supporting terrorism, 
then we could hold elections and the people of Jammu and Kashmir 
would be able to form their own Government," he said in an 
interview to THE HINDU after the meeting. 
  "I explained that Pakistan does not raise the issue of human 
rights in international fora for the sake of human rights, but 
only wants to internationalise the issue," he said. 
  With the possibility of a Pakistani attempt to introduce a 
resolution in the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, it was 
important for India to get a sympathetic hearing from the 
Europeans, and yesterday's meeting appears to have been an 
important step in this process. "I think they absorbed whatever 
I said, and they will keep it in mind whatever decision they 
take on the resolution," Mr. Dinesh Singh said. 
  A meeting with the Belgian Foreign Minister, Mr. Willy 
Claes, 
this morning was also cause for satisfaction. The Belgian 
Minister reportedly affirmed that India and Pakistan should sort 
out their problems bilaterally indicating that his country was 
against internationalising the issue. 
  At yesterday's meeting with the troika, Mr. Singh, who is 
still frail from his recent illness and finds it difficult to 
speak for a long time, shook off all traces of tiredness, and 
made a spirited defence of India's position on Kashmir. He urged 
the Europeans to think of the human rights of the victims of 
terrorist action, too. 
<H5>  Balanced Approach </H5>
  Kashmir and human rights were bound to figure in the talks, 
but the Indian side drew some satisfaction from the relatively 
mild and balanced way in which the Europeans addressed the 
issues. The Greek Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Mr. T. 
Pangalos, representing the Presidency of the European Union, 
said that Europe was concerned about what was happening in 
Kashmir, and stressed the need for restraint on the part of the 
security forces. But he balanced this by stating that Europe 
would continue to urge Pakistan to restrain its support for 
terrorism. He pointed out that no country, not even in Europe, 
had a perfect human rights record. 
  The visit to Kashmir by E.U. Ambassadors based in Delhi came 
in for favourable notice, but Mr. Pangalos urged greater access 
for non-Governmental organisations. The Minister welcomed the 
resumption of the dialogue at the Foreign Secretary level 
between India and Pakistan and urged that efforts be made to see 
that it continued. 
  India also probed the E.U. on its ideas about the expansion 
of the U.N. Security Council, a question which is receiving 
increasing attention in New Delhi. The Indian delegation was 
informed that there was no clear consensus within the E.U. 
itself on the form and content of expansion. India made it clear 
that it would be unhappy if expansion was restricted only to the 
two current front-runners (Germany and Japan), and pointed out 
that it would be unwise to rush a decision on the expansion. 
<H5>  India Pleased </H5>
  The Indian delegation has been pleased with the outcome of 
the meeting for several reasons. Firstly, it allowed India to 
get a hearing at the ministerial level in the E.U. and put 
forward its views on various issues. Secondly, it also provided 
the opportunity for a dialogue between the Foreign Secretary, 
Mr. K. Srinivasan, and his counterparts from the Belgian, Greek 
and German Foreign Ministries. They discussed a number of 
substantial issues including the NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty], 
European restrictions on sale of dual use technology, illegal 
immigration, terrorism and drug trafficking. 
  The Foreign Secretary or Political Director level talks as 
they are known were significant for the detail in which two 
related issues of importance to India, the NPT and dual use 
technology restrictions were discussed. As far as the NPT was 
concerned, the Europeans, as expected, urged India to consider 
signing the Treaty. 
  India has been worried about the E.U. making a list of 
countries to which the sale of sensitive dual use technology 
would be banned. The Indian delegation urged that the country 
should not be put on the list, and said that the Government was 
willing to certify end use of imports for civlian use. 
  The meeting was not expected to lead to any concrete 
declarations, but was only meant to carry the process of 
political consultation forward. It has done this and also laid 
the steps for further dialogue. The two sides have agreed on 
regular meetings at the official level on illegal immigration, 
terrorism, and drug trafficking, an outcome India is pleased 
with. 
  The first real results of the meeting will, however, be felt 
only in the weeks and months ahead, as Europe takes positions on 
the Pakistani resolution on Kashmir in Geneva and similar issues.

<F P=106> [Article by K.K. Katyal] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 10--For the first time, India has 
given a firm schedule to the International Commission of the Red 
Cross (ICRC) to go to Jammu and Kashmir. Its survey team could 
visit the State, the ICRC has been told, anytime after March 20, 
while any one from its side could go there for preliminary 
purposes right now. 
  As a matter of fact, the Indian authorities offered to 
arrange an immediate visit to Kashmir by the ICRC 
representative, Mr. Jean Mich Elli Monod, who was here this week 
for a workshop in Hyderabad. Mr. Monod, however, wanted to go 
back to the headquarters in Geneva for consultations. 
  India also suggested that the Hyderabad workshop, in which 
Mr. Monod and other representatives of the ICRC and the 
commanders of the paramilitary forces took part, could be made 
an on-going process. During the discussions the ICRC 
representatives explained the norms that needed to be followed 
in regard to the treatment of detenus and related matters while 
the Indian side detailed the practices observed by the 
paramilitary forces. 
  India's decision to give immediate access to the ICRC to 
Jammu and Kashmir is the culmination of a process that began 
more than a year ago, with its request for permission to send a 
survey team to the State. However, a decision was delayed as the 
exchange of views between the two sides got prolonged. During 
this period, representatives of the Amnesty International 
visited India. 
  The present relaxation is to be seen in the context of the 
discussions that began early in 1993. 
  At another level, India of late stepped up its diplomatic 
contacts to meet an immediate situation, created by Pakistan's 
move for a resolution at the U.N. Human Rights Commission at 
Geneva. The diplomats from some 45 out of the 53 
member-countries of the U.N. Commission were briefed last month 
by the then Foreign Secretary, Mr. J.N. Dixit. They also met the 
Home Secretary, Mr. N.N. Vohra, in two batches. The detailed 
accounts of the havoc wrought by the terrorists in Jammu and 
Kashmir and their links with the outfits in the 
Pakistan-occupied part of the State were supplemented with video 
presentations. This was besides the visits of the Civil Aviation 
Minister, Mr. Ghulam Nabi Azad, and the Minister of State for 
External Affairs, Mr. R.L. Bhatia, to the Muslim countries to 
put the record straight on Kashmir-related issues. The other 
Minister of State for External Affairs, Mr. Salman Khursheed, is 
due to brief the Delhi-based envoys next week. 
  Significant move: In a significant move, India has 
invited the member-nations of the U.N. Commission, including the 
Muslim countries, to send their envoys to Jammu and Kashmir. 
  Mr. A.B. Vajpayee, Leader of the Opposition in the Lok 
Sabha, 
who, along with the Finance Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, had 
gone to Geneva earlier this month, will undertake another trip 
there this weekend, while Mr. Khursheed will join him later. 
They will be there at the time of the possible Pakistani action 
to move a resolution on alleged human rights violations in Jammu 
and Kashmir. 
  The text of the draft resolution, circulated by Pakistan, is 
as follows: "The Commission on Human Rights: Recognising the 
need for the universal promotion and protection of fundamental 
human rights as defined in the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights and other instruments, covenants and declarations on 
human rights. 
  Noting the persistent and well-documented reports of massive 
human rights violations in Jammu and Kashmir, (1) Reaffirms the 
fundamental human rights of the people of Jammu and Kashmir; (2) 
Expresses grave concern at the gross and consistent violations 
of the human rights of the people of Jammu and Kashmir; (3) 
Decides to send a fact-finding mission to Jammu and Kashmir to 
investigate and report on the human rights situation there to 
the 49th Session of the U.N. General Assembly; (4) Decides to 
consider the situation of human rights in Jammu and Kashmir at 
its 51st Session."

  [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 7--Any move of the type, 
contemplated by Pakistan at the U.N. Human Rights Commission, 
for the despatch of a fact-finding commission to Jammu and 
Kashmir would be totally unacceptable to India, a senior 
External Affairs Ministry official said today. 
  India had launched a major diplomatic operation to counter 
Pakistan's plan and, as such, there could have been no ambiguity 
about New Delhi's stand. But a categorical statement was 
considered necessary to reinforce the argument about the 
futility of such a move. 
  At this stage, a clear picture of the measure of support--or 
opposition--to Pakistan's move is not available. But there are 
two significant indications--Russia will oppose the resolution 
and China will remain neutral. 
  The points made by the official were known, too, but a 
reiteration was intended to convey a message, loud and clear. 
The draft resolution, circulated by the Pakistan Government 
among some diplomats in Islamabad, contained its version of the 
situation in Jammu and Kashmir, with an overdrawn picture of 
excesses by the security forces and alleged repressive measures 
by the State administration, and called for a visit there of a 
fact-finding mission. This was also the purport of the 
resolution Islamabad wanted to move at the U.N., (but was not 
pressed in the absence of assurances of adequate support). 
  India, according to the official, was opposed to the 
proposed 
Pakistani move because of its dubious character. There was 
nothing to be investigated, he said, as Jammu and Kashmir was 
not a closed State, and a large number of visitors, including 
tourists, jurists and media personnel, had been there. The 
Government would be prepared, according to him, to discuss the 
plan for visit to the State by any group provided its purpose is 
transparent and objective honourable. 
  The draft resolution, in his view, had a political purpose 
(behind the cloak of human rights)--to maximise the advantage 
gained by Pakistan through its instigation and support of 
terrorist violence in the Kashmir Valley. "We oppose the 
resolution in letter and spirit," he said. The resolution was 
seen as marking a deviation from the Shimla Agreement, that 
committed the two sides to a bilateral approach, and running 
counter to the process, that had begun with the resumption of 
the Foreign Secretary-level dialogue. India, he stressed, was 
for continuing negotiations as was evident from its action in 
submitting six proposals to Pakistan for a smooth working 
relationship. 
  Pakistan had embarked upon a major diplomatic drive to 
secure 
support for its move. It had sent formal notes, held extensive 
briefing sessions, despatched special envoys to various 
capitals. It had sought to make full use of the sensitivities of 
the industrialised countries on the human rights issue.

<F P=106> [Article by Kumar Ananda: "Arjun Singh's Opposition to GATT </F>
is beginning to be Apparent"] 
  [Text] New Delhi, 31 March. Human Resources Minister Arjun 
Singh is not satisfied with his own government over the General 
Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT). He wrote a letter to 
Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherji about a week ago. He expressed 
his concerns over GATT in this letter. This letter was not 
circulated. However, he was not ready to respond to the 
opposition's allegations although he was the chairman of the 
cabinet sub-committee on GATT. Yesterday, Janata Dal's Nitish 
Kumar took a shot at him for his failure to speak on behalf of 
the government. It is believed that there is very little 
possibility of this issue being discussed in the 4 April 
Congress Working Committee meeting. 
  According to some sources, Parliamentary Affairs Minister 
Vidyacharan Shukla wrote a letter to some senior cabinet members 
asking them to give a time and date to present the government's 
side on GATT. Arjun Singh did not think it necessary to respond 
to this letter. Secondly, he was in the Lok Sabha for a long 
time during the first day of discussion on 29th March. However, 
he was missing the next day. Since the Congress Party had not 
issued a whip on this debate, there is not basis for a 
disciplinary action against Arjun Singh. Also, he was asked to 
speak for the government, but was not ordered to do so. 
  Those close to Arjun Singh call it their leader's opposition 
on principle. They argue that half of the Congress legislators 
were not present during the debate. They consider their absence 
as a disagreement with GATT and agreement with Arjun Singh. As 
for the letter written to Pranab Mukherji, Arjun Singh had 
supported making the government's stand transparent on GATT. 
This letter also mentioned the decision of the cabinet 
sub-committee. The sub-committee had talked with the 
representatives from different areas including trade and 
business about their reactions to GATT. It suggested having 
detailed discussion on various proposals included in GATT. Arjun 
Singh had asked in this letter to invite opposition leaders and 
discuss this with them. Arjun Singh says that efforts should be 
made to get the political parties and the nation in confidence 
on this issue. However, despite repeated requests, the 
government did have detailed discussions on it in the Parliament. 
  These lines written by Arjun Singh can be seen as a part of 
the incident related to George Fernandes, the leader of 
anti-GATT group. Fernandes had a long talk with Arjun Singh on 
14 February expressing his concerns over GATT. In this talk held 
at Arjun Singh's residence, George Fernandes had informed him of 
all the dangers. According to George Fernandes, Arjun Singh had 
not said any thing, but his expression showed agreement with 
him. Fernandes suggested that the effect of this conversation 
did not allow his conscience to defend the government. 
  The issue of one-person-one-position and Arjun Singh writing 
several letters to the Party President Narasimha Rao over the 
Ayodhya and the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] issues are 
considered his challenging for leadership. However, the vidhan 
sabha elections in the six states stopped this exchange of 
letters. Now the opposition appears to be united in opposition 
to GATT as it never was during the Rao administration. The BJP 
and the non-BJP parties had divided over the Ayodhya issue. 
However, the whole opposition has risen against the government 
over the GATT issue. Perhaps, that is why Arjun Singh is 
encouraged. However, the Rao camp does not appear to be in a 
mood to give much attention to his letter. Mr. Rao's supporters 
say that a person who is in the government and is playing the 
role of opposition cannot be taken seriously. If Arjun Singh had 
such strong feelings then he should have first resigned from the 
cabinet. 
  Secondly, there is a danger in the way Arjun Singh had put a 
question mark on Narasimha Rao's leadership by writing letters 
repeatedly over the Ayodhya issue. The whole opposition is 
accusing the government of selling the country and mortgaging 
the nation's sovereignty. The government and the ruling party 
want to counter the opposition's propaganda by holding rallies, 
meetings, and debates. However, when a senior leader of the 
government and ruling party makes his fears public over the GATT 
issue, the opposition definitely will gain strength. How much 
support will Arjun Singh get within the Congress Party? This is 
a matter for conjecture.

<F P=106> [Article by Thomas Abraham: "Come to the Table, Islamabad </F>
Told Again"] 
  [Text] Geneva, Feb. 3--The Finance Minister, Dr. Manmohan 
Singh, addressing the U.N. Commission on Human Rights today, 
called on the world community to wake up to the dangers posed by 
terrorism, and asked for its understanding of the problems that 
India faced from terrorism. 
  At a press conference later, Dr. Singh, renewed the 
Government's call to Pakistan for a dialogue on Kashmir, stating 
that this was the "only course open" to restore peace. 
  At the Commission's conference, he declared: "As we see it, 
our struggle against terrorism is part of a worldwide struggle 
to promote the rule of law as against the rule of the gun." He 
appealed to the world for "sympathy, understanding and support 
in our struggle against terrorism," and warned that the "world 
community must wake up before it is too late. 
  Speaking two days after the Pakistani Prime Minister, Ms. 
Benazir Bhutto's attack on the Indian policy on Kashmir, Dr. 
Singh focussed on the impact that Pakistani aid to Kashmiri 
separatism was having on India. "It is terrorism of unparalleled 
ferocity that we have been seeing in some parts of India. The 
sponsorship of terrorist violence from abroad, in blatant 
pursuit of territorial gains, seeks to destroy our secular, 
democratic, pluralistic civil order. The goal has been pursued 
with ruthlessness at the cost of thousands of lives...the misery 
inflicted by terrorists on peaceful citizens should be obvious 
from the fact that nearly 30,000 Indian citizens, both Hindu and 
Muslim, have had to flee their homes to other parts of India and 
have become refugees in their own homeland." 
  Admits losses of security forces: Significantly, 
Dr. Singh acknowledged lapses on the part of the security 
forces. "It is not the claim of the Government of India, indeed 
no country and no Government can make such a claim, that no 
human rights violations ever occur in our territory. We are 
conscious that some abberations on the part of the law-enforcing 
authorities can and do take place particularly in confronting 
terrorism. We have no desire to put these aberrations under the 
carpet. We do, however, claim that we have an unswerving 
commitment to human rights and that we have in our legal system 
an effective remedial framework, as well as a strong tradition 
of punishing human rights violations wherever they are found to 
occur." 
  Red Cross may be allowed: He also announced a 
further relaxation of the Government's earlier position of not 
letting foreign observers and human rights organisations into 
Jammu and Kashmir. The International Commission of Jurists has 
been the first international organisation to receive permission 
to go to Kashmir, and the International Committee of the Red 
Cross might be the next allowed in. Modalities of visits by the 
Red Cross were being discussed. 
  Dr. Singh only made a brief reference to Ms. Bhutto's 
speech, 
when he said, "It is most unfortunate that the distinguished 
Prime Minister of Pakistan, for whom we have great respect and 
regard, has used this forum to convey a wholly erroneous view of 
the state of affairs in the Indian State of Jammu and 
Kashmir...it is our sincere hope that this forum will not be 
used to politicise the human rights issues." 
  At the press conference, Dr. Singh, firmly ruled out the 
Pakistani suggestion for an independent team of outside 
investigators to look into whether Pakistan was sponsoring 
terrorism. "This is not something that requires proof. There are 
any number of reports, including from the U.S. Congress that 
documents this," he said.

  [Text] New Delhi, February 4--The supreme court today 
issued contempt notices to the eight top-ranking leaders of the 
BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] and its like-minded Hindu 
organisations for their alleged involvement in the demolition of 
the Babri mosque over a year ago despite the court's order to 
protect the disputed structure at Ayodhya. 
  Taking cognisance of the petition filed by Mr Mohammad Aslam 
alias Bhure seeking contempt of court action against the BJP 
leaders, including Mr L.K. Advani and others, the chief justice, 
Mr Justice M.N. Venkatachaliah, and Mr Justice S. Mohan, granted 
three weeks to the alleged contemnors to show cause why [they] 
should not be hauled up for violating its orders passed on 
November 15, 1991. 
  In a brief order, the court directed that notices be issued 
to the BJP president, Mr Advani, the former president, Dr Murli 
Manohar Joshi, the BJP MP [member of Parliament], Ms Uma 
Bharati, the Bajrang Dal chief and MP, Mr Vinay Katiyar, the 
Shiv Sena MP, Mr Moreshwar Save, the VHP [Vishwa Hindu Parishad] 
general secretary, Mr Ashok Singhal, the joint general 
secretary, Acharya Giriraj Kishore, and the organisation's 
fire-brand, Sadhvi Rithambra. 
  Already, the then chief minister of Uttar Pradesh Mr Kalyan 
Singh, his close aides, including the then district magistrate 
and police chief of Ayodhya, had been summoned before the apex 
court and were facing contempt of court proceedings. These 
proceedings related to the violation of the court's order 
against construction of the concrete platform at the state of 
the disputed structure and also for their inaction in protecting 
the mosque later in December. 
  As an aftermath of the demolition, riots engulfed the 
country, leaving behind several killed and property worth crores 
destroyed. 
  Mr Aslam's counsel, Mr M.M. Kashyap, had submitted that on a 
call given by the VHP, the Bajrang Dal, the RSS [Rashtriya 
Swayamsevak Sangh] and the BJP in November, kar sewaks had 
started converging at the disputed structure site for the sole 
purpose to construct the Ram temple there. He had expressed the 
apprehension and sought the court's protection for the over 
four-century-old mosque. 
  However, on December 6, two years ago, these kar sewaks from 
20 states, who had been trained earlier in the demolition task 
at a camp in the outskirts of Ahmadabad, "jumped on the Babri 
mosque" and demolished it amid provocative speeches made by the 
pro-temple leaders. The then president of the BJP, Dr Joshi, or 
Mr Advani did not stop the kar sewaks, the petitioner said. 
  During their "rath yatra," Dr Joshi and Mr Advani had 
mobilised the kar sewaks to execute the "task plan of 
demolishing the mosque," Mr Advani had also made inflammatory 
speeches during the "rath yatra."

<F P=106> [Article by Alok Mehta: "Arjun Singh's Disapproval of Prime </F>
Minister Rao Continues"; all quotations marks as published] 
  [Text] New Delhi, 31 March. Despite attaining a clear 
majority in the Lok Sabha and having a marginal victory in the 
vidhan sabha elections, central minister Arjun Singh's rebel 
attitude against Prime Minister Narasimha Rao's policies and 
leadership has not changed. The latest proof of this attitude is 
Mr. Singh's opposition to the government policies related to 
GATT and refusing to speak in the defense of the government on 
this subject in the Parliament. 
  After the division of the Janata Dal and the results of the 
Lok Sabha elections, Mr. Rao's supporters have been saying for 
the last 3-4 months that Mr. Arjun Singh had met with Mr. Rao 
and yielded to him politically. Mr. Singh's group getting an 
important victory in Madhya Pradesh and agreement of the two 
leaders over several public programs are also being considered 
as good signs. However, Mr. Singh has once again given the 
impression of his going in an opposing direction to the Congress 
Party now that the Narasimha Rao government is once again on 
trial like in 1992. Interestingly, the leadership of the 
five-member cabinet sub-committee formed according to the prime 
minister's wishes to respond to the political attacks on GATT by 
the opposition was given to Arjun Singh. However, instead of 
protecting it, he ``drove a nail in the bosom of the strong 
government.'' In addition to Mr. Singh, Finance Minister Dr. 
Manmohan Singh, Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherji, Agriculture 
Minister Balram Jakhad, and Science Minister Ramlakahn Singh 
Yadav are members of this sub-committee. 
  Mr. Singh started to touch on the sensitive issues related 
to 
the GATT agreement in the first two meetings of the 
sub-committee and created new problems for Dr. Manmohan Singh 
and Pranab Mukherji. Mr. Singh showed his agreement with the 
views of the opposition and expressed the fear that by signing 
the new GATT agreement we were mortgaging our freedom. "This 
decision is like inviting the East India Company again," he 
said. We cannot play the role of the last ruler before the 
British empire began. Pranab Mukherji and Dr. Manmohan Singh 
tried to explain each issue and said that the government has not 
ignored India's interests. Every step is being taken very 
carefully. However, Mr. Singh was not satisfied. As the result 
of this, the other four ministers started to kold separate 
discussions. 
  During that time, on the prime minister's advice, 
Parliamentary Minister Vidyacharan Shukla, while acting as the 
leader of the Congress Parliamentary group, asked Arjun Singh, 
Pranab Mukherji, Dr. Manmohan Singh, and Balram Jakhad to write 
a letter in defense of GATT. The remaining three ministers kept 
the order of the party leadership in mind and tried their best 
to defend the government's stand. However, Mr. Singh sent an 
oral message saying that he was not ready to defend the 
government on this subject. The political circles consider this 
action of ignoring the responsibilities as a member of the 
central cabinet and disregarding party leadership's directive 
very significant. 
  Arjun Singh's supporters claim that Mr. Singh took this step 
after a lot of thought. In December 1992, Mr. Singh had 
expressed open disagreement with the central cabinet's policies 
before the disputed structure was torn down and had left for 
Ayodhya. Now, by staying out of the GATT agreement, Mr. Singh 
can determine a new political equation.

  [Text] New Delhi, March 7. The Information and Broadcasting 
Minister, Mr. K.P. Singh Deo, today ruled out privatisation of 
any channel on Doordarshan. 
  Replying to supplementaries during question hour, he said 
the 
issue involved was selling television time to private parties. 
"There is no question of privatisation of any channel." 
  Several members expressed concern over the "cultural 
invasion" that was taking place in the country and urged the 
Government to take all necessary steps to preserve, protect and 
enrich our cultural heritage. 
  The Minister said if Parliament felt it was warranted, the 
All India Radio and Doordarshan code could be reviewed. 
  The code was approved by Parliament in 1977. 
  While admitting that there has been a cultural invasion, he 
said special endeavours were being made to bring out the Indian 
identity on Doordarshan. 
  Mr. Singh Deo, however, stated that the programmes telecast 
on Doordarshan were not in violation of any stipulated 
guidelines. -- PTI

  [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 12--The Communist Party of India 
(CPI), has demanded that immediate steps be taken to initiate a 
political process in Jammu and Kashmir so that people of the 
state can regain their confidence. 
  Briefing newspersons on the issues discussed at the National 
Council of the CPI which met here from February 8 to 10, the 
party General Secretary, Mr Indrajit Gupta, said to start with, 
the government should convene an all-party meet at the national 
level to discuss the question of `political freedom', and pave 
the way for a dialogue with the various political forces in the 
State. 
  He said the National Council also wanted the problem to be 
resolved within the framework of the Constitution while 
preserving the special status of the region under Article 370 
and respecting the desire of the people to safeguard their 
identity. 
  Referring to the external pressure with regard to Kashmir, 
Mr 
Gupta said India should take all possible steps to rebuff the 
United States' anti-Kashmir stand. The evil designs of the 
United States against peace and amity in the sub-continent, must 
be frustrated. 
  Charging the government with procrastination and lacking in 
a 
clear cut policy on Kashmir, he said the Kashmir administration 
was not responding to the people's urges as it was treating the 
problem merely as a law and order one. Instead of creating a 
favourable condition for initiating a political process in the 
State, the Narasimha Rao Government was relying only on 
administrative measures, he said. 
  Mr Gupta also opined that the leaders of both the Communist 
Party of India (Marxist) and the CPI should "sit together and 
talk of the possibilities of a merger." These two parties, he 
said, had a special relationship which had to be developed, 
although there were differences on some questions. The two 
should also seriously consider the question of the unity of mass 
organisations like the trade unions, rural organisations and 
students' organisations. 
  "Both of us together can and should give a new turn to the 
nation's politics," he said, adding that the Left parties have 
planned an intensive nation-wide campaign in February and March 
and also a march to the Parliament on April 5 to protest against 
the economic policies of the Rao government.

<F P=106> [Article by Chandra Bhushan: "The Bihari Babu Against Lalu"] </F>
  [Text] The Bihar Vidhan Sabha election scheduled for 
January next year is expected to be interesting. Not only 
because Chief Minister Lalu Prasad Yadav will go through a real 
test of fire, but also because of the rumors floating around 
that the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] will run film star and BJP 
member Shatrughna Sinha for the position of chief minister. 
  If true, the next election definitely will be very 
interesting. The central BJP leadership has belatedly learned 
the fact that the popularity of a Bihari Babu can be cashed in 
on only in Bihar. He was embarrassed when he ran against Rajesh 
Khanna for the New Delhi Lok Sabha seat. 
  Despite numerous efforts by Tarakant Jha and the present 
state party president, Kailashpati Misra, the BJP could not 
achieve the position in that state that it should have. Yes, the 
BJP is in good position in the southern part of the state 
because of businessmen and industrialists there. However, 
because of the activities of some extremists and the Naxalites, 
the political atmosphere here is not as favorable to the BJP as 
it was in the past. Lalu Prasad organized an tribal conference 
in Patna recently to take the initiative in attracting their 
vote bank. According to some sources, Lalu had promised the 
tribals all kind of support from the Janata Dal. It means that 
the Janata Dal can also win a good number of seats in southern 
Bihar this time. Thus, southern Bihar will not be easy to win 
for the BJP. Political observers believe that Lalu is also 
expected to benefit from the breach in the Jharkhand Mukti 
Morcha [JMM]. 
  Most of the BJP members elected to the vidhan sabha are from 
southern Bihar. Meanwhile, the BJP got a major jolt when Inder 
Singh Namdhari, who was considered one of its strong pillars, 
left the party and formed a new party of his own. Later, 
Namdhari joined the Janata Dal. The Janata Dal made a crack in a 
BJP known for its unity. However, one of its candidates did win 
the election for a Rajya Sabha seat. This is a good omen, but 
cannot be called a solid base. 
  Major efforts were made to strengthen the BJP in this state 
last year. The right atmosphere was created by the rathyatra 
[procession]. Murli Manohar Joshi, Kalyan Singh, and other major 
leaders had attracted huge crowds and made speeches to get 
support for the BJP. It is noteworthy that huge crowds had 
attended these meetings. It seemed at that time that the BJP 
would succeed in forming the government in Bihar. However, 
Bihar, notorious for caste-related politics, has taken the wind 
out of the BJP sail here. Although Tarakant Jha was replaced 
with Kailashpati Misra as president of the state BJP, the BJP 
still could not get additional support in Bihar. 
  Now that the politics here are being made more caste-based 
by 
calling for rallies of various caste groups, what will the BJP 
do? Is it finding itself helpless or is it planning a new 
strategy? While reviewing answers to such questions, it was 
learned that movie star Shatrughna Sinha would be especially 
useful in Bihar. That is why when the question of appointing a 
new member to the BJP working committee came up, Lal Krishna 
Advani's favorite man Yashwant Sinha, who had deserted the 
Samajwadi Janata Party and joined the BJP, was considered to be 
the front runner. However, Murli Manohar Joshi insisted on 
appointing Sinha to this position. Sinha thus was given an 
honorable position in the party by making him a member of the 
working committee. It can be easily assumed that he will be 
asked to play a major role in Bihar's politics. The BJP knows 
that if there is anyone who can make the party strong in this 
state then it is Shatrughna Sinha. 
  There are solid reasons behind this line of thought. The 
first reason is that only Sinha can counter the popularity that 
Lalu Prasad has gained in this state. He is popular in the whole 
state. That fact that his popularity is mostly because of the 
his movie star glamour rather than of his political involvement 
is a separate issue. The truth is that Shatrughna Sinha is a 
heavy weight compared to Lalu Prasad when it comes to attracting 
crowds. Second, the caste issue is so prevalent in the state 
that the next government should be that of the Janata Dal. 
Lalu's image is mostly that of a Dalit leader. Sinha has 
established himself among all the caste and religious groups as 
a movie star. If the BJP announced that Shatrughna Sinha will be 
the chief minister in a BJP government, the BJP would definitely 
win the next election. 
  If the BJP gives more publicity to Kailashpati Misra or 
Tarakant Jha, it will suffer on two fronts. First, both are 
Brahmans and it will not take much time to establish a negative 
environment for them in this caste-oriented state. Second, 
neither of these leaders have access to the rural population of 
the state. Well-educated persons also do not know them very 
well. The same is not true of Sinha. Although the Biharis' craze 
for him is related to movies, the people are aware of his 
political savvy from some of his public meetings. 
  Anyhow, Shatrughna Sinha is seeing a green flag from the BJP 
high command and has decided to join Bihari politics. In a 
recent public meeting in Buxar, he had said that the 
caste-related mentality in Bihar is a way of life there, but the 
people have also learned that the reason for their backwardness 
is the caste system. At the same time, Sinha encouraged regional 
politics by asking the people to say "we are Biharis" in the 
same tune as they say "we are Indians." This makes it possible 
that the people will be attracted to him.

Digvijay These Days"; all quotation marks as published] 
  [Text] Bhopal, 16 March. The first 100 days of Chief 
Minister Digvijay Singh, who had filled Madhya Pradesh with his 
promises and declarations, are not enough to evaluate his 
effectiveness. However, it appears that the chief minister who 
rides on the shoulders of the masses is busy, but everything 
around him is in a mess. He had the image of a macho chief 
minister when he arrived in this state. Even after innumerable 
efforts, they have failed to change his image to that of the 
sole leader of the state. Instead, Digvijay Singh has the image 
of a servant in this state of three super chief ministers--Arjun 
Singh, Kamal Nath, and Madhavrao Scindia. 
  Digvijay Singh was the candidate from the Arjun Singh camp 
last December when the leader of the Congress legislative group 
was elected. In the power struggle between the Arjun Singh and 
Shukla groups that climaxed at the polling booth, Digvijay Singh 
defeated Shyamacharan Shukla and became the chief minister from 
the Arjun Singh camp and from the Arjun Singh political family. 
However, during the first 100 days, the roles of the main 
characters in the state political drama have changed. The most 
interesting and shrewd scene is that in which the chief minister 
is in the Arjun Singh camp as are his most eloquent detractors. 
  The political wild game hunt of these two Thakurs [warrior 
caste] has not only thrown the remaining factions of the 
Congress Party in the background, but also has put a question 
mark on their political existence. The names of followers of 
Madhavrao Scindia and Ram Charan Shukla can be counted in the 
latest episode. 
  Digvijay Singh is a `Macho chief minister' because throngs 
of 
people surround him seeking his help until 2:00 am. He puts one 
hand on one person's shoulder, listens to a second person, 
respond to a third person, and smiles at the fourth person. 
Members of the Congress Party arrive from all over the state. 
They have submitted more than 50,000 requests for transfers and 
new jobs and have made Digvijay Singh feel that he is the super 
leader sitting at the peak of his popularity. It is surprising 
that Digvijay Singh is using this crowd as a standard to measure 
his popularity. This style can work for the state Congress 
president, however, it does not work for someone in the role of 
[state] Congress president and chief minister. Digvijay Singh 
has been mostly the state Congress president during his first 
100 days. Perhaps, during the next few months he will emerge as 
the real chief minister. 
  Amidst all kinds of assumptions, Digvijay Singh is trying to 
maneuvour maintaining a balance between Arjun Singh and Kamal 
Nath. He does not want to defy or anger either of these leaders. 
In this game of keeping balance, Digvijay Singh appears to be 
alternately leaning towards the camp that puts more pressure on 
him at a given time. 
  Still, the change that is visible is Digvijay Singh's 
efforts 
to stay away from Arjun Singh, the human resources minister at 
the Center. 
  Only time will tell how many leaders in his own camp and 
from 
other groups will support Digvijay Singh. If we review the 
visits by state Congress leaders, especially Central Human 
Resources Minister Arjun Singh and Central Forests and 
Environment Minister Kamalnath, then we can see the increasing 
warmth between Kamalnath and Digvijay Singh. Digvijay Singh has 
publicly declared that Kamalnath played an important role in his 
election to the chief minister's position. He has not given a 
similar statement about Arjun Singh. The relationship between 
Arjun Singh and Digvijay Singh has been seen to be both hot and 
cold. These state leaders occupying central government positions 
have only strengthened their power bases instead of empowering 
the chief minister. Their agenda, speeches, and methods have 
divided the Congress workers. They are also creating doubts. 
Five Congress (I) power bases in the state, with varying degrees 
of influence, are present. These power groups are led by Arjun 
Singh, Kamal Nath, V.C. Shukla, Madhavrao Scindia, and 
Shyamacharan Shukla. 
  As for the Shukla brothers, the state government will not 
try 
to openly oppose V.C. Shukla because of his position. However, 
central Water Resources Minister V.C. Shukla is quiet. The 
former Chief Minister Shyamacharan Shukla is waiting for an 
opportunity. 
  The group that is baffled most is that of Arjun Singh's 
supporters inside and outside of the government. They had 
considered Digvijay Singh a foot soldier in Arjun Singh's camp 
at one time. One cabinet member who had gone to see Arjun Singh 
off at the airport on 14 March after his visit to Moni Baba 
[holy man] said, "How long will he be able to run the government 
without the support of King Arjun Singh?" This is the most 
complicated issue in the state politics now. Madhya Pradesh is 
the umbilical cord from which Arjun Singh acquires strength just 
like some mythological characters. The supporters of Arjun Singh 
cannot stop expressing their feelings seeing the decline in his 
prominence in that state for the first time. Important leaders 
believe that a power struggle is going on between Arjun Singh 
and Digvijay Singh. If we look closely, Arjun Singh, Digvijay 
Singh, and Kamal Nath have basically the same views, but are 
telling different things to the prime minister and the party 
president. 
  Another major change has been noticed in Arjun Singh's 
supporters. They appear to have fully submitted to the prime 
minister. It could be that this change was forced on them. He is 
the same person who used to mentioned the prime minister as a 
villain during the Surajkund conference. He drools when showing 
respect for him now. 
  It should be remembered that in addition to these challenges 
from within the Congress (I) Party, there is the challenge of 
the Bharatiya Janata Party [BJP]. The first Vidhan Sabha 
election held after Digvijay Singh became the chief minister was 
for the Satna seat. The election for this seat was held later 
because of an Election Commission order. The chief minister was 
so impressed with his own proclamations that he announced before 
the voting that, "the people will give me their mandate in 
Satna." The opposite happened; the BJP won. The second major 
challenge is the Rajgarh Lok Sabha seat. The atmosphere is now 
getting heated up after the march of former Chief Minister 
Sunderlal Patwa and responding march by the chief minister's 
brother Lakshman Singh. 
  The first 100 days of Digvijay Singh's rule have hurt the 
people more than the party according to one interpretation. Some 
leaders within the Congress (I) Party and the cabinet have 
emerged who are speaking the language of Bahujan Samaj Party's 
[BSP] Kanshi Ram. These attacks made from public platforms, 
however, were mostly because of political pressure. These 
attacks are made sometimes [in a bid] for the the presidency of 
Madhya Pradesh Congress Party, and sometimes just to undermine 
the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh. The effect of this on the 
people is such as never seen before. The fact that Chief 
Minister Digvijay Singh never forgets to pay homage to Kanshi 
Ram during this visits to Delhi is entirely another matter. 
  This has made the Congress members who have never practiced 
the politics of casteism before restless. They practiced 
politics keeping the state in mind. Except for a few districts, 
there is emphasis on castes as is in Uttar Pradesh. The BSP was 
active in the 1989 vidhan sabha elections, however, it could not 
make its presence known until the 1993 election. However, the 
BSP did not achieve the success that the Congress and the BJP 
were afraid of before the elections. The BSP leaders now have 
the excuse to use their party as a threat. This has led to the 
rise of caste sentiments in many districts, including Vindhya 
Pradesh, Chhattis Garh, and Bilaspur. 
  The chief minister of the state had started to add the issue 
of caste to every announcement from the beginning. He has 
softened now that he was accused of using the caste issue as a 
weapon. These accusations are still being levied. Some ministers 
and Congress leaders seem to be in a competition to give the 
most instigating speech. They target the high caste people 
directly or indirectly. 
  The latest example of is of Tanwant Singh Kir, minister of 
administration in Digvijay Singh's cabinet. There was a 
divisional conference of Ujjain division's sanitary workers on 6 
March. A part of Mr. Kir's speech in that conference went like 
this: "The scheduled castes and the backward groups have not 
taken over the responsibility of cleaning and picking up trash. 
Now, whoever makes the mess will have to clean up. In the 
future, 20 percent of the jobs for sanitary workers will be 
reserved for high caste people. Both God and I like the sanitary 
workers. The high caste people, the traders, and the Brahmans 
just do not understand it all. All citizens have equal right for 
upward mobility. I will not allow any discrimination and bias 
against these castes." 
  There was a sharp reaction to Mr. Kir's speech both inside 
and outside of the Vidhan Sabha. The turmoil inside was so 
intense that Chairman Srinivas had to cancel the assembly 
activities and remove the verbal assaults from the proceedings. 
That day, former Chief Minister Kailash Joshi was seen to be 
upset when coming down the stairs of the Vidhan Sabha. He said, 
"How did he become a cabinet member? What kind of language does 
he use?" 
  It was Arjun Singh who started this new practice of 
providing 
or demanding positions based on caste in Madhya Pradesh. On the 
evening of 5th December, the election heat was sharp in both the 
election camps--Shukla's and Arjun Singh's. Digvijay Singh 
proposed his name with the help of Kamal Nath in Arjun Singh's 
camp. At that time, Arjun Singh's "dummy" candidate Subhash 
Yadav had to withdraw. However, when Arjun Singh stood up to 
speak in the legislators' meeting, Sushil Kumar Shinde, party 
supervisor for elections, stopped him from speaking. Arjun Singh 
left the meeting in anger. He issued a statement from his 
residence 15 minutes later. He said that the world would not 
have come to an end if he had had the opportunity to speak to 
the legislators. He wanted a Harijan or tribal to be elected to 
the state's leadership. All he wanted was to make an appeal. It 
is important to remember that in 1980 when Shivbhanu Singh 
Solanki ( a tribal) had more votes in the Congress legislative 
group, Arjun Singh had become the chief minister by usurping 
Solanki's votes with the support of Kamal Nath. The population 
of tribals and Harijans in the state was the same at that time. 
  Later, central Human Resources Minister Arjun Singh came to 
Bhopal on 4 January 1994. He said that he was still firm on the 
opinion he had given at the time of election of the legislative 
leader. He wanted one of the tribals to be elected leader. 
According to knowledgeable circles, Mr. Singh wanted the leader 
of the state Congress Party to be of the same group and from his 
own camp. Thus, Ajit Mukherji emerged as the choice and he went 
around the state giving statements asking for first being 
elected chief minister and later, the state party president. 
  Interestingly, except for some of Digvijay Singh's cabinet 
members, the Congress members viewed this demand differently. 
Most of them belonged to Arjun Singh's camp and had lost in the 
election. All the coalitions that were either stagnant or 
defunct suddenly became revitalized and there began a series of 
conventions. On 4th January, Arjun Singh requested Governor 
Mohammed Shafi Qureshi in the presence of Digvijay Singh on the 
platform to decide on enlarging the Baba Saheb Ambedkar National 
Institute of Social Sciences. The work on this institute had 
been discontinued since 1984 and Arjun Singh could have made 
work possible by giving a grant before 4th January. He had 
announced a grant of five million rupees for this purpose. 
  Another statement was issued after Digvijay Singh was 
elected 
chief minister on the advice of Arvind Netam, central minister 
of state for agriculture. In the statement issued on 5th 
January, he said that the demand to elect a chief minister from 
scheduled castes, tribals, or backward groups was not honored. 
Parasram Bhardwaj, president of the Joint Legislative Council, 
said from Bhillai that in addition to administrative positions, 
the scheduled castes and tribals have not gotten proper 
representation in public service programs, municipal committees, 
and other places. 
  Because of this pressure, two deputy chief ministers, 
Subhash 
Yadav and Pyare Lal Kanwar, were appointed for the first time. 
Subhash Yadav's speech made in the Yadav group's meeting in 
Indore on 26 January was also discussed. Mr. Jogi said on 1 
February in the scheduled castes and tribal groups' meeting in 
Bhopal, "We will fight only over burning issues. We will not 
make any more requests, it will be the higher caste people who 
will do that now. Reservation of quotas is our right. We will 
pass this quota to 15 percent of the people. We will not 
tolerate those leaders who were elected with our votes any 
more." Mr. Jogi told the reporters after the conference that he 
thought just like Kanshi Ram, however, they were on different 
platforms. His efforts won 25 cabinet positions and two deputy 
chief minister positions. 
  It was Jamuna Devi, the minister for welfare of women, who 
put a stop to Ajit Jogi's statements. She said that, "Ajit Jogi 
who is talking about scheduled castes and tribals, should first 
look at himself and tell us who he is. What has he contributed 
to the party? Ajit Jogi's statements and actions were making the 
government and the chief minister unstable. Ajit Jogi appears to 
be a subversive politician. He started to oppose the state 
government with a conference in Bhopal and such action is 
intolerable." Jamuna Devi demanded expulsion of Ajit Jogi from 
Congress and action against the cabinet members who took part in 
that convention. 
  Thus continued the routine of caste-based politics. On 4th 
February in Bhopal's Ravinder Bhawan, a backward-classes meeting 
was held. They demanded in this meeting that the president of 
the state's Congress Party should be a backward class member, a 
tribal, or from a scheduled caste. In addition to that, they 
demanded that 50 percent of positions in the Congress 
organization, public programs, and municipal committees should 
be reserved for these groups. Rajmani Patel, the president of 
this organization, is a former cabinet member and belongs to 
Arjun Singh's camp. Similarly, Bansilal Dharitlehre, another 
former cabinet member, has also demanded that the presidency of 
state's Congress Party should be given to a member of these 
groups. Mr. Dharitlehre himself is also a candidate for this 
position. 
  The caste equation that is changing the the face of the 
Madhya Pradesh Congress Party does not appear to stop here. 
There is no opposition to it within the party, and no one has 
the courage to come forward to oppose it. However, a statement 
issued by Kamal Nath from Tikamgarh is of significance. He 
announced in his speech during the closing ceremonies of the 
Amar Singh Rathaur volleyball tournament that it does not matter 
whether the president of the Congress Party is from a backward 
group, that person must be qualified for the position, and then 
he added, "We do not want to make Madhya Pradesh another Uttar 
Pradesh."
